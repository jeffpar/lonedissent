ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP A.

LACOVARA, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

10

Thank you.

MR.

LACOVARA:

Mr.

Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether an employer that

11

12

has been held responsible for paying back pay under the employ­

13

ment discrimination statutes because of the wage differential

14

among various categories of- employees may serve a claim for con­

15

tribution against the labor unions that, according to the com­

16

plaint in the case, regularly bargained for and indeed demanded

17

the preservation of that dif ferent, i a! .

18

There are a number of issues that are briefed exten­

19

sively by the parties and by the various amici curiae who have

20

supported one side or the other.

21

noon I would like to touch upon three major themes.

22
23
24

25

In my argument this after­
They' are,

in sum, first., that this is not an implied right of action
case and that the discussion about the extent to which the
Court should be implying rights of action where there is con­
gressional

silence is not. an apt controversy here.
3

1

2

This is a question of developing a remedy to allocate
liability that already exists under developed legal, doctrines.

3

Secondly --

4

QUESTION:

I'm not so clear I see the distinction

5

for what you're saying.

6

developing a remedy for allocating liability, I mean, you could

7

pretty much describe implied cause of action that way, couldn't

8

you?

9

MR.

LACOVARA:

I mean, to say that it's a way of

I think there are two fundamental

10

aspects of the implied right cf action cases, as this Court

11

hais been debating them over the past few terms that distinguish

12

them from this case.

13

in Cannon, for example, makes clear, the implied right of aatic n

14

cases involve an effort to invite the courts to create statu­

15

tory liability, monetary liability, where Congress has not

16

explicitly fastened liability on the: defendant.

17

those cases, as Justice Powell points out, necessarily involve

18

assertion of federal question jurisdiction over disputes that

19

would not otherwise be assigned by Congress to the jurisdictior.

20

21
22
23
24

25

As Justice Powell's dissenting opinion

Secondly,

of the federal courts.
As I'll explain in this case, Justice Rehnquist,
what we have here is a claim that turns upon sl premise'that
Congress has already created the financial liability for
unions, that Northwest is seeking to shaire.

So far it has beer

ordered to pay the exclusive portion of the liability.

4

1

So this is not a case in which new liability is being created.

2

Secondly, this kind of allocation

3

QUESTION:

I wonder if that's a valid distinction,

4

because it has not expressly created liability on the part of

5

the union to the company.

6
7

8
9

MR.

LACOVARA:

But i1 has created liability tc the

employees, and that's the -QUESTION:

Then, isn't it like Cannon and the

other cases that the question was whether the particular plain­

10

tiff could get recovery, not whether the defendant might be

11

liable to somebody else?

12

MR.

13

QUESTION:

14

15

LA00VARA:

But, Your Honor, as I will explain --

And most of those cases assume that

there's some legal duty owed by the; defendant, to somebody.
MR.

LACOVARA:

Yes; what we have here, though, is a

16

situation in which, if both defendants had been sued together

17

-- that is, if the employer and the union had been joined in a

18

suit, or if the employer had been sued alone and had impleaded

19

20

21
22
23
24

25

the unions, there seems to be little question that under case
law that this Court has developed as well as cases In the lower1
federal courts, that there would have been a right of alloca­
tion of that liability.

That's what the lower courts have

held rather consistently, and

Justice White’s opinions for the

Heinz v. Anchor Motor Freight -I'm sorry?

Heinz v. Anchor Motor Freight Lines.
Yes.

These are cases in which the

Court has already said -QUESTION:

One of the more popular decisions.

MR. LACOVARA:

I think it's an excellent decision.

These are decisions, though, in which the Court has already
said that where one or’ both concurrent tortfeasors are sued,
the courts have a federal common law responsibility to develop
remedies that will fairly allocate the liability according to
the relative degrees of fault.

That assumes that there is

existing liability under some doctrine of law.
6

I shall attempt

1

to demonstrate that in this kind of case liability for unions

2

for the conduct alleged here is clear under Title VII.

3

disputes that the unions have that Tille VII liability.

4

also attempt to demonstrate and, I hope, persuade the Court,

5

that unions also have liability for conduct that violates the

6

Equal Protection Act.
QUESTION:

MR. LACOVARA:

No one

Equal Pay Act?
Excuse me, the-. Equal Pay Act, for

conduct that violates their own independent duties under the
Equal Pay Act.
So, that's the first point.

Conceptually, I think

12

that Cort v. Ash and its progeny in the debate over implied

13

rights of actions does not really focus the Court on the pro­

14

per set of cases.

15

QUESTION:

Well, the Equal Pay Act specifically

16

makes employer's liable and says nothing about unions' lia­

17

bility, does it not?

18

MR. LACOVARA:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. LACOVARA:

That's correct.

And whereas Title VII makes both liable?
Yes.

It's explicit.

I shall attempt

21

to explain as we lay out in our briefs, in some detail, why we

22

think, as correctly understood, that Congress did intend under

23

the Equal Pay Act to permit direct suits by employees from

24

union violations.

25

But in any event, that is not relevant to

Northwest's contribution claim, because any union conduct that
7

1

violates the Equal Pay Act’s bar on unions causing employers
2

to discriminate by paying unequal wages, constitutes also a
3

violation of Title VI] and a violation of the union's duty of
4

fair representation.

And under either of those two duties,

5

unions would have financial liability for that misconduct.
6

And it is a settled principle of contribution that the Govern­
7

ment itself acknowledges in its amicus brief that contribution
8

may be asserted by one wrongdoer against another

even when

9

the source of their misconduct and financial liability is
10

different:

one, for example, arising under statute; another

1 1

arising

and this is, again, to repair to Justice White's

12

opinions for the Courts in those two cases -- the: situation in
13

which the Union's breach is a breach of its federal common
14

law duty of fair representation.

Our position is, in

accordance with traditional law, that a contribution suit is a

This violation stems from the contract

between the union and Northwest ..Airlines , is it not so?
MR.

LACOVARA:

Yes, sir.

In fact, that's an essen­

tial ingredient in the facts of the case here.

We have

alleged that at all times from the late 1940s up through the
Laffey lawsuit, the: underlying class action that was brought
only aga.inst Northwest, each of these two unions in turn
represented all of the cabin attendants employed by Northwest,
the highe:r paid five percent who were pursers and were
9

1

virtually all male, and the lower paid categories, the female-

2

stewardesses, the male stewards, and flight service attendants.

3

And we allege that at each round of bargaining the union came

4

to the table and demanded the perpetuation, and indeed, the

5

enlargement of that differentia].

Well, the Equal Pay Act is applicable

only if one gender is paid otherwise from another gender for

QUESTION:

That's correct.

It doesn't have anything to do with

differentials between two different jobs?
MR.

There has to be a determination that

one job is occupied by people of one sex and the other is

14

occupied by people of another; that's correct.

QUESTION:

And that's all that's covered by the

Equal Pay Act, isn't it?

3

MR.

LACOVARA:

Yes, that's right.

But as you know

4

the Bennett Amendment to Title VII was intended to make the two

5

statutes congruent so that any conduct that violates the Equal

6

Pay Act necessarily violates Title VII.

7

QUESTION:

The employer, however, is the one who

8

pays the wages or the salaries and do you only have to prove

9

that the union violated one of these statutes to prove some

10

kind of loss by the employee because of the union conduct?
MR.

11

LACOVARA:

The case law7 is fairly uniform on

12

that, Justice White, and i.t is to the effect that Title VII

13

expressly imposes an independent duty on the unions to root

LACOVARA:

This is what federal courts have

This is not a novel issue.
13

This has been lil.iga.ted

many times, and what the courts look to is, for example, the
origin of the disputed provision, the incentive for it, for
its retention, the efforts that may have been made by one or

the other of the parties to eliminate it.

that it is undisputed that in 19 6 6 Noi’thwest proposed to elimi­

MR. LA CO VARA..
QUESTION:

We don't know.

In which event you may not sue.

MR. LACOVARA:
QUESTION:

It may involve that.

Pardon me?

In which event, if it's too tough, you

may not sue.
MR. LACOVARA:

There's no doubt that the contribu­

17

tion claimant has the burden of proof on that, and if it's too
18

complicated and the stakes are not sufficiently high, an em­
19

ployer may not assert a contribution claim..

All we're trying

20

to demonstrate is that we have the right to get through the
21

courthouse door.

My answer to Justice Brennan and you, Jus­

22

tice Rehnquist, is that this case is not necessarily, this
23

type of case is not necessarily any more complicated than an
24

underlying employment discrimination case or many of the other

kinds of cases.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

19

21

Very well.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
By this action Northwest is asking for contribution
for its liability in Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, a liability
that arose not under the common law but under two specific
federal statutes, Title VII and the Equal Pay Act.
23

1

Neither of those statutes provide a right of contri­

2

bution, and the issue is whether despite the absence of a

3

provision for contribution in those statutes this Court can

nevertheless recognize Northwest's claim.

Court has broad remedial powers to remedy violations of Title

I think this goes back to the:

10

question that the Chief Justice ashed of Mr. Le.covara, what

1 1

is the recognized legal right which Northwest possesses, which

12

it claims has been violated, and for which it is asking this

13

Court to impose a remedy?
To use the terminology employed this last year by

But as Mr. Lacovara

has acknowledged this afternoon, it is a claim which has as
its principal component the establishment of the union's
liabilities under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act.

That lia­

bility has never been determined.
I have heard again this afternoon, as I've heard in
24

the briefs, that the unions are clearly equally liable with

Northwest for the violations here.

that either of these unions violated either of these statutes.

plaintiff's option.

situation, but what generally happens in these type of cases

17

-- for example, this is an example of the type of situation

18

I have in mind: many of these Title VII cases are class actions

19

and the plaintiff may be suing not only on its own behalf but

20

on behalf of a large class many of whom maybe union workers;

union members.

MR. M0LD0F:

What I would say, under that circum­

stance, what bars this suit is the fact that nobody has bee.n
able to establish the union's liability under Title VII by
the explici.t procedures Thai

Congress placed in the statute

for establishing such liabilities.
QUESTION:

You mean, exclusive in the sense that the

only person who is permitted to claim that the union violated
the Act is the employee?

That's one half of the equation.

And can, then -- each one of them is

to the two defendants, I am going tc order you to share the

MR. MOLDOF:

The federal courts have the authority

20

at that point -- in fact, Congress provided a procedure for

21

the federal courts which is entirely consistent with the

22

charging requirement.

The court's power to fashion remedies

which is created by 706(g) of the statute provides that once
a court finds that a respondent has intentionally violated the
statute, the court can order appropriate remedies.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,

14

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. WALLACE:

17

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In 1942 this Court in Solo Electric Company v.

18

Jefferson Electric Company, in a unanimous opinion by Chief

19

Justice Stone observed, and I'm quoting now from page 173

20

of Volume 317:

21

"When a federal statute condemns an act as unlaw­

22

ful., the extent arid nature of the legal consequences of

23

the condemnation, though left by the statute to judi­

24

25

cial determination, are nevertheless federal questions,
the answers to which are to be derived from the statute
42

1

and the federal policy which it has adopted."

2

This observation serves as a reminder that in many

3

fields there would be no federal law and no federal rights if

4

Congress had not legislated in the exercise of its commerce

5

power.

6

law would govern labor relations or the field of fair employ­

7

ment practices in the private sector.

into this field must therefore flow from the pertinent federal
statutes themselves, expressly or by implication.

QUESTION:

say why except you just think this is a better position?
MR. WALLACE:

vides no authority for a, suit for contribution by' the employ^er

12

MR. WALLACE:

Is that it?

That is our position, that neither

dards to whether there's an implied remedy for contribution,

15

would support a remedy for contribution, 'that it wouldn't be

of either statute for reasons that we've set out in our brief,

Then the result, Mr. Wallace, depends on

the fortuity of whether the plaintiffs bring some suit against
both the union and the employer’, or whether the employer’
doesn't ever get around to bringing the union into the case.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, we don't think the employer has

a right to bring the union into the case at an earlier stage
either, if the union has not been charged.

whether there's a private remedy against unions under the

The Commission,

This is from the Commission's brief in the

5

that the Commission believes that in certain circumstances an
