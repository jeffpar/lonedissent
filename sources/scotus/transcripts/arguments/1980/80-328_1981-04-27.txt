MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

3

in New York v. Belton.

4

whenever you're ready.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. HARVEY:

7

11
12

This case involves the legality of a search conducted
by a police officer of a jacket belonging to the respondent and
the admissibility of the evidence — in this case, cocaine -which was obtained from that jacket.
The basic issue boils down essentially'to whether or

13

Court:

Mr. Harvey, I think you may proceed

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. HARVEY, ESQ.,

5

8

We will hear arguments next

not the search was permissible as a search incident to a lawful
arrest which was one of the several well-recognized exceptions

15

to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment.
16

By way, just

very

briefly,

of background of the

17

case and how it got here.

The respondent moved to suppress the

18

cocaine at the trial level;

that

.motion

was denied after a

19

hearing.

The evidence was held admissible; the respondent sub­

20

sequently pled guilty and appealed the case to the New York
21

State intermediate appellate court, which unanimously held that
22
the search was proper of the jacket in this case, as a search
23

incident to a lawful arrest.
24

The respondent further appealed to the New York Court
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

3

1

of Appeals which in a divided opinion reversed the appellate

2

court, lower appellate court, and held that the officer had in

3

effect reduced the jacket to his exclusive control when he, if

4

you will, picked it up, and therefore a warrant was at that time

5

necessary under the law.

6

The facts in this case, if I could very briefly run

7

through them -- I think they're very important, and they're pret

8

ty much — well, they're not in dispute by either counsel for the

9

respondent or myself, but I’d like to go through, and start out by

10

11
12
13
14

saying that it was on April 9, 1978, that the Trooper Nicot in
this case, a state

policeman, was patrolling the New York

State Thruway, an interstate highway, and he spotted the respon­
dent's vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed on the highway.
QUESTION:

What time of day was this?

MR. HARVEY:

Mid-morning, Your Honor.

And he pulled

15

over the vehicle.

There were four male occupants, two in the

16

back and two in the front.

When he went up to the window --

17

it was rolled down by the driver; he went to the driver's side
18

— he smelled fresh burning marijuana and observed on the floor
19

a Supergold stamped container which he knew from his training to
20
be a container that normally contains marijuana.

At that point

21

in time,he directed all four occupants to leave the vehicle,
22
which was a two-door vehicle.

They got out of the vehicle.

He

23

at that point in time retrieved the Supergold container, which
24

did contain marijuana, in fact, and some four or five "roaches"
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

4

1

or burned marijuana cigarettes in the ashtray of the front por­

2

tion of the vehicle.

3

At that point in time he again patted down or searched

4

further all of the four occupants of the vehicle, read them

5

their Miranda rights, placed them under arrest for possession

6

of marijuana.

7

the motor vehicle there on the expressway.

8

went back into the vehicle and on the back seat there were lying

9

five jackets.

12

13

The officer then

He picked up the jacket involved in this particular

10

11

At this time we had four defendants outside of

case and he took ahold of it, went through it, and found cocaine
in an unzippered pocket as well as a $20 bill and cocaine in a
zippered pocket.

Not that that makes any difference.

And he

then asked each of the four defendants, at this point, occupants
14

of that vehicle, as to who owned this particular jacket.
15

QUESTION:

You say there were five jackets?

16

MR. HARVEY:

I believe that's correct, Your Honor.

17

There were only four people in the car, Your Honor, but there -18

pardon?
19

QUESTION:

Five jackets?

20
MR. HARVEY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I believe

21

that's what the -- as I recall the record.

And none of these --

22
QUESTION:

Did he search the others, too?

23

MR. HARVEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

None of the occupants

24

admitted to this'jacket belonging to them.

So he then placed

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

5

1

each and every one of the occupants under arrest for possession

2

of cocaine, obviously a more serious offense.

3

dant --

4
5
6

QUESTION:

And the defen­

At trial did they disclaim any ownership?

Or any move to suppress?
MR. HARVEY:

Okay, Your Honor, in the jacket, in --

7

the defendant in this case, the Respondent, now Belton — he

8

had an ID card.

9

Shield card with his name on it.

10

11
12
13
14
15

I believe it was either a Blue Cross or Blue
And I handled the case at the

grand jury, and each of the other occupants pointed the finger
at the respondent in this case, Your Honor.

And there was never

any disavowal of the ownership of that jacket.
QUESTION:
MR. HARVEY:

But the ID card also was in this jacket?
That's correct. In the respondent's name.

That's correct, Your Honor.

Now, it's the position of myself

that in this particular case Chimel v. California governs in
16
17

that this was a proper arrest and a search.

There's no question

about the lawfulness of the stop, and there:'s no question of the
18

leadup to the arrest for the possession of marijuana, that
19

this was a lawful stop and a lawful search incident to arrest.
20

Now, Chimel, of course, pointed out you can certainly
21

search the arrestee, in this case, four arrestees, and that you
22
can also search the area under the immediate control of the
23

arrestees, and that has been construed to mean the area from
24

which an arresteee may gain, or might gain, access to a weapon

Did he secure them in any way when they

were standing —
MR. HARVEY:

There were no other officers present.

He was alone

No, Your Honor, they were in no way

secured.
QUESTION:
MR. HARVEY:

Just stood outside the car -- ?
They were outside of the vehicle, out­

side of their particular vehicle, Your Honor.

He did indicate

that he, :if you will, he segregated them outside the car, spread
them out a little bit, outside the vehicle.

That was the extent

as to what he did.
15

MR. HARVEY:

He couldn't secure because he didn't

16

have but one pair of handcuffs.
17

MR. HARVEY:

Exactly, Your Honor.

We believe that

18

under the Chimel case that we have to ask ourselves, under
19

these circumstances could any one of these arrestees or occu­
20

pants of this vehicle approach that vehicle, rush or overpower
21

the officer, and of course obtain the evidence which was on, in
22

the back seat, in the jackets, in this particular case?

Now,

23

these jackets, we certainly can presume, were shed at some point
24

in time by the occupants.

QUESTION: Did you say it was a two-door vehicle?

MR. HARVEY:

MR. HARVEY:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Then did he have to get in it and —
Yes.

Your Honor, he had to bend, push

and bend in.

At this point in time he was certainly indisposed

they could

Being a two-door vehicle, Your Honor,

have certainly -- my position is more that they

could have overpowered the officer and put him in a situation
where they could have obtained the evidence and taken out the
jackets in this particular case.

And I believe that that's why

the search certainly is proper under Chimel, because I believe
15

he could have been overpowered by any one of the arrestees.
16

This is not a case of one arrestee -17

QUESTION:

And why did

the

New

York

Court

of

18

Appeals say it was not?
19

MR. HARVEY:

Okay.

Your Honor, the Court of Appeals,

20
the court below in this particular case, took the position that
21

when Trooper Nicot placed these four occupants of the vehicle
22

under arrest, that there was some magic in the officer with
23

these four occupants of the vehicle, placed under arrest, that
24

automatically they were subservient to each and every command

QUESTION:

11

With four people in the car?
That's correct, Your Honor.
Mr. Harvey, Judge Gabrielli in his dissent

makes some point of the fact that under your state procedural
12

rules the New York Court of Appeals cannot make new findings of
13

fact where the Supreme Court and the Appellate Division have
14

made concurrent findings.

Is that —

15

MR. HARVEY:

That's the law.

That's a correct state­

16

ment of the law, Your Honor.

And in fact, they did that in this

17

particular case by finding the exclusive control of the scene
18

of the jacket in the officer at this point in time.

To me,

19

that was incorrect.
20

QUESTION:

Do we have any review of that issue when th e

21

highest court in the state has,, even if they have distorted their

own law?

Can we correct the errors of the New York Court of

Appeals on error in construing state law?

No, but don't we have to take the facts as

the New York Court of Appeals said they decided the case?
MR. HARVEY:

I submit, Your Honor, that the fact that

15

this Court should consider are the facts set forth in the record of
16

the hearing in this particular case at the initial trial court
17

below.
18

QUESTION:

Do you have any authority for that?

Any­

19

thing in this Court that's ever suggested we do that?
20
MR. HARVEY:

We don't have any, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

There isn't any.

22

MR. HARVEY:

Now, in the respondent's brief, he makes

23

much ado about the lack of concern of the officer for his

safety.

10

Ultimately he did, Your Honor.

And drove them all -- ?
Took them to the police station, and ul­

timately to the magistrate, in that particular area, that's cor­
rect , Your Honor.

This Court in Robinson stated that it's not

certainly necessary for the officer to calculate at the scene,
to consider whether or not a weapon may be present, but rather
the arrest itself automatically triggers, if you will, the
search incident to that arrest, which includes the area of the
arrestee, as I stated before, as well as the person of the

16

arrestee.

In Robinson, of course, it was the person of the

17

arrestee from which the cigarette container was obtained.
18

To say that the -- as I stated before -- that the
19

officer had the exclusive control of the jacket at the time
20

that he picked the same up, I think the Solicitor General in
21

his brief points out that such a construction of exclusive
22

control of this standard would in effect render

Chimel mean­

23

ingless in terms of searching of portable items in the area

of the particular arrestee, as existed in this particular case. |

There was no clear view of the cocaine

the jacket and obtained the cocaine, the powdery substance •'
therefrom.
QUESTION:

Mr. Harvey, can I ask you just one question

15

about the authority for the search?

There were two offenses

16

that had been committed, one by the driver in speeding, and

then secondly all four, presumably, were in possession of mari18

MR. HARVEY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

speeding offense, would you still say there would be authority

But here you're dealing with basically two

separate doctrines, aren't you,

the Robinson doctrine of

searching as a result of a custodial arrest and the Chimel
doctrine of how broad an area surrounding the arrestee can you
search in order to make sure that he doesn't either destroy
evidence or pull a gun on you?
MR. HARVEY:

14

That's correct, Your Honor.

We're inter­

weaving, certainly, the two circumstances, the two cases.

One,

15

of course, Chimel, is aimed at primarily the obtaining of the
16

weapon or the destructible evidence.

The other is the, cer­

QUESTION:

You find in the trunk of the

pocket.

I guess you would concede that you couldn't search,

23

under our cases, you couldn't search the briefcase?

21

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
22

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
23

MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

24

Court:
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

Respondent has asserted in his brief that we wholly

2

disagree with the arguments of the state, and I just wanted to

3

begin by making the point that we do not disagree with the

4

state in its arguments that this was within the Chimel scope,

5

focusing on the facts of the case and the reasonableness of the

6

officer's actions under the particular facts of the case.
We think that, however, that that kind of inquiry

7
8

which is amply — the state's position is amply supported, if it

9

be made in this case, is not an inquiry that needs to be made.
Our argument addresses, then, the question of whether

10

11

a valid search incident to an arrest can be justified solely by
reference to the spatial limitations; that is, whether it comes

12
13

within the Chimel scope, and the temporal limitations during
the arrest process.

We were concerned about the exclusive con­

14

trol notion which both the New York Court of Appeals in this
15

case and the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in the Benson case,
16

in which we have a cert, petition pending, have imported from
17

Chadwick, where I think it had quite a different meaning and
18

intention, into this situation.
19

Our argument in this case, contrary to what respondent
20
has suggested in his brief, is not intended to undermine either
21

thoroughly, as he says, or in any way, Chimel, or Chadwick, or
22

Sanders.

It doesn't call the validity of those decisions into

23

question at all.

The permissible scope of the search of the

24

person of an arrestee incident

to arrest has been settled in

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

24

1

2

Robinson and that scope is broad indeed.
This case concerns the aspect of a search incident

3

doctrine involving a search of containers or items of some kind

4

that are nearby but not on the person or being worn by the ar­

5

rested individual.

6

like the items on the person should be subject to the same test

7

for a valid search incident to arrest as long as the search is

8
9
10

11

And our position is that such nearby items

made during the period of the arrest.

We would not contend,

with respect to a separate container that may have been seized,
that the Edwards principle that a search incident to arrest can
occur later, would be applicable to such containers.
Now, the first question in analyzing the case is whe­

12

ther, when the officer went and seized respondent's jacket, the
13

jacket was at that time within the spatial area defined by this
14

Court's opinion in Chimel.
15

QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, is this an argument that because

16

the jacket was capable of being worn, we ought to treat its search
17

as we would treat one if he were wearing the jacket?
18

MR. FREY:

No, no, it would not have to be a jacket.

19

It could be a shopping bag or some other item.

It's not because

it was capable of being worn, but

was

20
because

delineated from case to case, and this Court has not had very

much occasion to do so.

But I would note that if the arrested

individual is standing unsecured outside his automobile, I think

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

3
4

We'll resume there at one

o'clock.

5

(Recess)

6

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

7

MR. FREY:

Mr. Frey, you may continue,

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I think when

8

the Court recessed I was discussing the spatial limitations, the

9

limitations of the Chimel test.

10

11

And it is our view, and I

think Adams v. Williams is precedent for this, that the interior
of a .car is within the spatial grabbing area for a person who
is standing right outside the car at the time of arrest.

But

12
13

the decision of the court of appeals here and of the 8th Circuit
in our Benson seems to go beyond that and suggests that even

14

though an item is seized from within the Chimel area, there is a
15

separate inquiry whether at the time it is searched it is within
16

the exclusive control of the officer searching it.

And that

17

test, which as far as I know, is novel to our jurisprudence
18

prior to Chadwick, comes from certain language that was used in
19

Chadwick, and I think in a quite different context.
20

There are several difficulties that we perceive with
21

the exclusive control notion that has been used by the lower
22

court in several of these cases.

First, I would make the point

23

that it runs afoul of the holding in Adams v. Williams, which
24

was a case where, according to the record

that was the appendix]

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

in this Court, Williams had been arrested.

2

waited until additional officers arrived on the scene, at which

3

point the car was searched.

4

sis in the Court's opinion, but the Court did uphold the search

5

of the car and the seizure of the heroin found in the car as

6

incident to Williams' arrest.

7

The officer then

Now, it was not a subject of analy­

The same is true in Draper where, I assume,at the time

8

the zipper bag was searched it was within the exclusive control

9

of the officer in this sense.

10

11

12
13
14
15
16

And the problem with the exclu­

sive control test, the way it's being used, is that it essen­
tially eliminates searches of any item that is capable of being
picked up and carried away by the officer as incident to arrest.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Frey, you wouldn't contend that

the cases from this Court that you have referred to are kind of
a unified whole easily applicable by any lower court or any
policeman, would you?
MR. FREY:

I would say that in the area of search

17

incident to arrest the cases to date have been reasonably con­
18

sistent, and it seems to me that —
19

QUESTION:

Up until they were unsettled by Chadwick

20

21

MR. FREY:

Well, I don't think that Chadwick — Chad­

22

wick apparently has been the source; Sanders, I don't think, has
23

anything to do with search incident to arrest, but Chadwick has
24

been the source of some confusion for the lower courts, but I
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

29

1

don't think it's any inconsistency in this Court's treatment of

2

the subject that has prompted that.

3
4

QUESTION:

Well, there was no claim in Chadwick, was

there, that that was a search incidental to arrest?

5

MR. FREY:

We did not make that claim; no.

6

QUESTION:

I didn't think so.

7
8

9
10

11
12
13
14

That wasn't an issue

before the Court.
MR. FREY:

No, but it was a point that was discussed

in the Court's opinion, and in just a second I will get to what
the Court said about it because I think it is important.

But I

wanted to make the point first that the nature of a search of an
item, a parcel, a jacket, a purse, or something like that, in
order to be searched it really has to be within the control of
the officer. Presumably the officer and the arrested individual
are not having a tug of war over the item.

So in the sense that

15

in Benson and in this case the court seemed to have used exclu­
16

sive control, it totally eliminates search incident to arrest of
17

items that are not on the person of the individual.
18

QUESTION:

I take it you will take some note of the

19

fact that in Chadwick the search was not at the time or place
20
of the arrest but long after?
21

MR. FREY:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

I was just coming

22

to that point.

What was omitted in the discussion of Chadwick

23

is the language that immediately preceded the exclusive control
24

language in which the Court said that the potential danger

case which was argued earlier today, where the question is whe­

irrelevant or at least not very significant when we are talking
about a search incident to arrest, because the search incident

to arrest is not justified by probable cause.

There is no ques­

I think the Court made the point in a foot­

note in Chadwick that when you are dealing with a type of search

like an inventory search, which is not justified.by probable

cause., cases dealing with the warrant requirement are not really

apposite.

The argument is particularly inappropriate, it seems

If -- I suppose what you're driving at is

that, conceivably, the officer might have said to the four of
them, you get in your car, and don't get more than two car
lengths ahead of me and go to the station?
MR. FREY:

That is one of the important reasons for

the search incident, when you have a number of items like this.
The officer may have to know what disposition can be appropri­
ately made, which ones of them are dangerous, might — you know,
he has to locate weapons or --

Is that your point?

MR. FREY:

That would be a risk, yes.

I mean, that's

17

one of the reasons why you permit the search incident to arrest
18

is that you have these items of property that are in the area
19

of the arrested individual and as part of the process of stabil­

I would like to begin with what I think is a critical

2

point.

3

very clearly pointed out that at no time, at any time in this

4

5

grabbable reach of these individuals.

6

to that effect by the trial court, there was never a finding to

MR. CAMBRIA:

the car.

11
12

There was never a finding

That's correct.

They started off and

the sequence of events were as indicated by Mr. Harvey except
for one thing left out.

They were taken out and first patted

15

down.

The officer then went back into the car and discovered

16

a small quantity of marijuana.

Then he went out and thoroughly

17

searched them and spread them out, and he said, at the back of
18

the car.

He then went into the car and patted the jacket down

19

first, and indicated that he felt nothing that would indicate
20
a weapon at all.

And the point made by the court of appeals,

21

which I think has to be emphasized, is that the record simply
22

does not support a Chimel exception which it is certainly the
23

burden of the petitioners to support from the record.
24

QUESTION:

Well, do you read it as saying that there's

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

36

1

nothing that could possibly support that exception because in

2

fact they were outside the car?

3

MR. CAMBRIA:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. CAMBRIA:

Yes, and that's the proof.

That was

conceded here, that they were outside the car.
QUESTION:

8
9

I mean, is that the way you read your couht

of appeals?

6
7

In fact, they were outside the car --

And you argue in agreement that therefore

the exception cannot apply under this set of facts?
MR. CAMBRIA:

10

It does not apply under Chimel.

If I

might, Chimel indicated that it's not everything in a room, to
11

use Justice Stewart's language, not everything in a room which
12

would be subject to search, only those things in the examples
13

used were, perhaps, a gun in front of the individual; perhaps a
14

drawer in front of the individual; but certainly not the entire
15

room.

That was the Rabinowitz standard, which was rejected by

16

this Court 12 years ago in Chimel.

And that's the point that

17

happens here.

We have to bear deference to the officer's de­

18

scription of the event and to the ringside seat that he had of
19

the event, where he indicates that there was no reason for him
20

whatsoever to draw his gun; he felt absolutely no danger to
21
22
23
24

himself, which is one of the twin prongs of Chimel.
QUESTION:

Maybe he's a fast-draw policeman and there­

fore didn't have to draw it.
MR. CAMBRIA:

I might indicate that when the question

there was just no need for that at any time.

MR. CAMBRIA:

13

I think that we have to deal with the

record the way it exists.

And under the record the way it exists

the car acted as a barrier between these individuals and the
jacket which was on the back seat at the time, and not as an
open area.

For example, it's not even as good as being in the

open room described in Chimel, where the Court said you couldn't
search all of the various drawers.

It's better, in this situa­

14

tion, because the cubicle in which the officer was is different
15

than where the individuals were standing.

There was, in fact, a

barrier created here, and to demonstrate -17

The point that I think again, the

appellate division here, and, I submit, the Government is
attempting to say by citing Adams v. Williams and the other
cases, that we should scrap- Chimel, that we should adopt the

5

Robinson standard for the area, as opposed to what it stands for
6

which is the person.

Robinson says that we find that the arrest

7

itself is enough of an intrusion so that those matters imme­
8

diately associated with the body are subsumed in the invasion of
9

privacy.

MR. CAMBRIA:

3

that those areas traditionally do not enjoy the expectation of

privacy that private receptacles do.

in Opperman.

Opperman, the glove compartment or the trunk or the common areas

7

of the car, the car, since it's highly regulated, since it is

8

an area with windows and so on, does not enjoy the same expecta­

9

tion of privacy as their''private garments.

11

So that if we're talking about, specifically,

QUESTION:

10

That's what the court said

But Opperman was an inventory search of an

abandoned car. Isn't that somewhat different from this?
MR. CAMBRIA:

I think that if we then go to inventory,

12
13

we're talking of something other than the Fourth Amendment.
We're talking of something that certainly wasn't done here, and

14

something that under Opperman could be done.

The question would

15

then be, how far could you go with the inventory?

Would it be

16

enough to simply list the jacket without going into the pocket?
17

Each pocket was zippered.

The testimony is, one was .in fact .

18

They were all closed.

The testimony was one was

19

zippered and had to be opened.

QUESTION:

The purpose of an inventory

search is in

21

part, at least, to protect the officers from claims of possible

theft or disappearance of the materials, so they would go into

not?

QUESTION:

Well, what good would it do them to make an

inventory search if they didn't look in the pockets?
MR. CAMBRIA:

5

My recollection of Opperman is that it

6

depends upon their local rules and regulations as to what they

7

can do and what they can't do in the inventory situation.

8

in this case, I think that it bears emphasis that the officer

9

did exactly what this Court indicated in Sanders and in Chadwick

13

15

should be done, and that is, he took the jacket with him.

stated clearly, I had it in my possession. This was after the

QUESTION:

Mr. Cambria, there, never was any finding in

this case, was there, that there was probable cause to search
the jacket?
MR. CAMBRIA:

No.

16

QUESTION:

And the claim is that it should be searched

17

just incident to arrest, whether there is probable cause or not?
18

MR. CAMBRIA:

That

But even if there were, assuming

the same as Sanders, it was considered by this

Court in the footnote, as indicated to be dicta by the Government,
but the fact remains that the individuals in Sanders were there
in close proximity to this unlocked attache case, and the same
argument could have been made with regard to that case.

But it

12

wasn't made.

And I submit it wasn't made because it wasn't sup­

13

ported by the record in that case. Like in this case, there is
14

absolutely no pronouncement at all that these materials were
15

within the grabbable reach of these individuals.

If we try to

16

uphold this on Adams v. Williams, which I think is totally irre­
17

levant to this consideration for this reason:

in Adams v. Wil­

18

liams there is probable cause to believe, as a result of a
19

reliable tip, that there is an armed and dangerous individual
20

seated in an automobile, and the officer approaches the indi­
21

vidual, asks him to get out; he doesn't get out, he rolls the
22

window down.

The officer reaches in, pats in the area, and

23

finds a weapon -- immediately finds a weapon.
24

Then he takes him

out and searches -- no containers -- searches the common

QUESTION:

had patted down this jacket, which he did, and he had discovered

that he could search it, would you?

QUESTION:

That's -- yes.

Is it not?
Yes.

And the only issue is whether or not the

search and seizure were within the permissible scope of a search
and seizure incident to that lawful custodial arrest?
MR. CAMBRIA:

Yes.

And I think that it is. It falls

into two categories. As to the petitioners, it falls into whe­
ther or not it comes within Chimel, which is grabbable reach.
As to the Government, it falls within whether or not you are

12

going to expand Robinson and in effect subsume Chimel by saying,
13

as long as you're arrested, the police have the right to search
14

the area, whether or not the materials in the area are within
15

the grabbable reach of the individual.
16

QUESTION:

Now, did Chimel speak in terms of "grabba­

17

ble reach" or "reach"?
18

MR. CAMBRIA:

Yes.

It said —

19

QUESTION:

Or was the emphasis on plain view, first?

20

MR. CAMBRIA:

No.

The emphasis, I believe, Your Honor,

21

with all due respect, was the area immediately associated with
22

the arrestee into which he could reach.
23

QUESTION:
24

And in plain view?

MR. CAMBRIA:

But —

No, there wasn't -- I do not believe

there was a mention of plain view.

don't know whether it's within reach, grabbable or otherwise,

No, I might indicate that in Chimel

arrested?

Does that in fact cause a breach of your privacy?

If so, is it just incidental to search the matters around you?
That was what was rejected by the court of appeals below be­
cause that was the finding of the appellate division here.

15

There has never been a finding that these materials came within
16

the Chimel grabbable reach.

As a matter of fact, the --

Is this within the permissible geographic

-y and seizure.

MR. CAMBRIA:

What I am suggesting is that we should

not -- and the Court has not, in the past -- adopted

a

place

or area requirement, but has in fact employed this grabbable
reach element.

And if we take the precedent of this Court sim­

ply from the Chimel standpoint, it's not only not established
by the petitioners in this case, it's not even remotely estab­
lished by the facts in this case, since, as indicated, the
officer did something that would show that by following the
procedure here, he's certainly not deprived of any law enforce­

18

ment activity, because he in fact took the jacket with him;
19

had the people to such a degree of control that they first
20

stopped at the police barracks, then they went on to the court;
21

the same individuals are with him.

He had it, as he said, in

22
his possession and secured.

So we're not in any way attempting

23

to frustrate law enforcement.

We're simply saying when you're

24

not within the Chimel confines, then you have it in your
25
North American Reporting

51

1

possession; take it to a magistrate.

2
3

QUESTION:

Well, the issue is whether or not this was

within the Chimel confines.
MR. CAMBRIA:

4

That's the only issue before us.

Yes.

And I think that that is true

5

unless we were to attempt to argue the Government's version,

6

which is, forget about Chimel.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. CAMBRIA:

9

QUESTION:-

10

11
12
13

Mr. Cambria, may I ask you a question?
Yes, sir, Justice Powell.

If this jacket had been on the seat beside

the driver, it would have been reachable before the driver got
out of the: car.

Under the right to search incident to arrest,

if the driver was still sitting at the steering wheel the officer
I take it could then have searched the jacket,

if it lay on

the seat beside him.
14

MR. CAMBRIA:

At the time of arrest the occupant was

15

outside of the car.
16

QUESTION:

I know.

But my question assumed he was --

17

MR. CAMBRIA:

If it was within his grabbable reach,

18

under Chimel, I think that I would be foolish to argue, other­
19

wise .
20

QUESTION:

So that the difference really is whether

21

or not the officer asked for the jacket before or after the
22
driver stepped out of the car?
23

MR. CAMBRIA:

No, I don't think that that's the dif­

24

ference.

I think the difference is that at the time the people ;

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

52

1

were placed under arrest and again, recognizing the two bases

2

for Chimel, was there a basis for believing destruction of evi­

3

dence or a danger to the officer?

4

the jacket being within the grabbable reach of the arrestee?

5

That was the actual issue.

6

And was that manifested by

Because the Court has never said that for any type of

7

arrest, when it's not within the Chimel reach, that you can

8

simply search the entire area, search all of the possessions,

9

or even the car, for that matter.

10

11
12
13
14

So what I'm indicating is,

the critical time, as this Court has repeatedly said and most
recently in Sanders is

at the time of the arrest and at the

time of the search; that's when we measure the facts.

And as

I'm indicating,, here when we measure the facts, as the court
below obviously interpreted the record -- and the record itself
is clear, the state has not carried their burden.

15

QUESTION:

Do you not draw any distinction between a

16

residence, a home, and an automobile?
17

MR. CAMBRIA:

I don't think that there is a distinc­

18

tion between articles within an automobile and articles in a
19

residence, or articles anywhere else,

if they are private re­

20

ceptacles, and I don't think there's much argument here that
21

these are not, then the question is, as it was in Sanders and
22

the other cases, that we don't give up the privacy simply be­
23

cause they happened to be in an automobile or because they're
24

somewhere else.
25

1

QUESTION:

What do you do with our Edwards case then,

2

which said that although the search took place an hour and a

3

half after the arrest or two hours after the arrest, since it

4

could have been done at the time of the arrest, it was good at

5

two hours afterwards?
MR. CAMBRIA:

6

I think that there is a vast difference

7

between Edwards and this case, because in Mr. Edwards' situation

8

we're talking about his clothes, which were totally immediately

9

associated with him because he was wearing them.

10

11
12

13
14
15
16

therefore, a great jeopardy that the

There was,

paint flakes which were

on the clothes could have been destroyed by him, which was the
very evidence that they were attempting to preserve in the case.
So there was a vast difference between this case and that case.
In that case, if we take one of the two forks of Chimel, which
is preservation of evidence immediately associated with the
person, Edwards falls directly within that.

If we take my case,

where the material is immediately associated with the police
17

officer and at no time after the arrest and search associated
18

with my client, then we have none of the two-pronged basis for
19

Chimel.
20
QUESTION:

You certainly have the temporal disparity

21

in Edwards that you do not have here and that you don't have in
22

Chimel.
23

MR. CAMBRIA:

Well, I don't think we have a temporal

24

difference in Edwards since, one

is he was wearing the garment,

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

54

1

it was always in danger of having whatever evidence was con­

2

tained on it being destroyed.

3

search, no matter what had happened, until you separated the

4

individual from the clothing.

5

QUESTION:

6

So it was a contemporaneous

Well, so then it makes no difference when

the person is arrested?
MR. CAMBRIA:

7

No, it would make a difference under

8

Preston, certainly.

9

that's not involved here but. one that was involved in Preston,

10

11
12
13

That would be an additional factor, one

which was also involved in Edwards.

I mean, I would say that

that is another ground upon which to invalidate a search and
seizure,

if there's a temporal variation, difference; which

we don't have.
QUESTION:

Except in Edwards, it was held that it

14

would not invalidate it.
15

MR. CAMBRIA:

No, it did not invalidate it, and I

16

submit, because of several unique factors.

One was, apparently

17

they didn't have any clothes for the man until sometime -- it
18

was late at night, and they had taken him down to the cell;
19

that was their normal procedure to do that. And again, the evi­
20

dence was apparently clinging to his very outer garments at all
21

times, and they -- at least the way I read that case — acted
22

as quickly as possible under the circumstances.

So the time was

23

really not a factor because it was a constant jeopardy, whereas,
24

certainly, here there is nothing like that at all.

QUESTION:

the officer had the

Mr. Cambria, maybe this is too trivial a

4

question, but you have used the term "grabbable reach" repeat­

5

edly.

6

MR. CAMBRIA:

QUESTION:

8

area than a just plain reach?

10

11
12
13

Is a grabbable reach a greater or a lesser

MR. CAMBRIA:

9

Yes.

Well, I think that grabbable reach, in

the sense of being able to reach the materials, that's the way
I interpret Chimel; readily reach the materials immediately.
The words are used, immediately, ready at reach, ready to hand,
are some of the other words that have been used, which I think
is much different than this situation, but there's never been

14

a claim, by proof, that any of this was ready to hand, at any
15

time.

And of course, that's the way the court of appeals saw

16

it below, and it is my contention that based upon the record
17

that we have here, not very — pardon me?
18

QUESTION:

Well, have we got to go through the record

19

to find out if it was reachable or not?
20

MR. CAMBRIA:

I think that the record certainly shows

21

in all ways and fashions that it was not, and there is no affir­
22

mative proof that it was.
23

QUESTION:

Was there any findings?

24

MR. CAMBRIA:

Never.

There was never any findings in

10

11
12

Well, I think that — it seems to me

that in this particular case you couldn't make a judgment of
fact, that the Court would not be in a position to make a judg­
ment of fact as opposed to a judgment of law based upon the
record as found by the highest court of the State of New York.
QUESTION:

13
14

If there was no finding, we are entitled to make our

Well, if the Court of Appeals of New York

said, this was not within grabbable reach —
MR. CAMBRIA:

It did.

15

QUESTION:

Whereabouts in the record?

16

MR. CAMBRIA:

The opinion was to the effect that ift the

17

last footnote of the chief judge.'s opinion he said, we search the
18

record in vain in an attempt to find the facts which support,
19

the dissenting justice is Gabrielli, his statement that this was
20

ready to hand or within their reach.

It isn't there; nowhere.

21

QUESTION:

Well, do you regard that as a finding of

22

fact?
23

MR. CAMBRIA:

Yes.

I think that when it appears in a

24

majority opinion and they -- as perhaps this Court in its
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

57

1

majority opinion in talking of certain things mentioned in dis­

2

sents, when you say, we have in essence construed the record and

3

we find no proof whatsoever that this is within the grabbable

4

reach, I think that's a finding of fact. Because on the other

5

hand, if they would have found to the contrary, then I feel they

6

would have been bound by Chimel, and they have discussed Chimel,

clearly, and said that it simply did not come within the confine

of Chimel.

Mr. Cambria, I take it that when you arrest

someone in connection with a car, if you want to go beyond your
grabbable reach range, you'll have to rely on the automobile
search, the automobile theory, which requires probable cause to
believe that where you are searching you may find what you're

14

searching for?
15

MR. CAMBRIA:

And then only as to those items listed

16

by this Court in Opperman, which would be items immediately
17

associated with a car:

trunk, glove compartment, wheel wells,

18

fender wells, and so on.
19

QUESTION:

Well, I think you also have to have proba­

20

ble cause to believe you're going to find something in those
21

areas.
22

MR. CAMBRIA:

No question about it.

I think there's

23

no doubt about it.

There has to be a pleading situation, plus

24

there has to be the limited expectation of privacy as to the

1

areas being searched, and certainly not packages which are with­

2

in the car itself.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Cambria, when you -- as I understand

4

the facts here, after the officer stopped the car, the driver

5

rolled down the left window of the car, and the officer when

6

he went into the back seat was on one side of the car and the

7

four individuals were on the other side.

8

side or the right side of the car?
MR. CAMBRIA:

9

Were they on the left

No, the only testimony here is that he

10

took the individuals out to the rear of the car,

n

split them up and patted them all down.

12

He went back into the

car, found some minor —
QUESTION:

13

Which door did he go in, do you know?

MR. CAMBRIA:

14
15

that he first

He, I believe, indicated the driver's

door.
QUESTION:

16

He went in the driver's door? I see.

MR. CAMBRIA:

17

QUESTION:

Then he came back out --

But if the window was open, I suppose it's

18

conceivable, even though they're outside the car, they could
19

have reached in and grabbed the jacket.
20
MR. CAMBRIA:

However, the record doesn't support

21

that.

The record has them at the back of the vehicle and in no

22

way supports going into the car.
23

QUESTION:

I see.

24

MR. CAMBRIA:

No way -- in fact, the officer puts

25
North American Reporting

himself hack into the car.

2

3

QUESTION:

I thought the four individuals were sepa­

rated from one another.

4

MR. CAMBRIA:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. CAMBRIA:

7

10

11
12

13
14

Are they all behind the car?
That's what the record states, Your

Honor, yes.
QUESTION:

8

9

That's so.

Mr. Cambria, let me go back to the footnote

that you have referred to in Chief Judge Cooke's opinion, at
A-81 of the Appendix.

He says, "One searches the record in vair

for support of the dissenter's claim that at the time of arrest ■
the point'from which the predicate for;the warrantless search
is measured -- 'the jackets were within reach of the four sus­
pects and had not yet been reduced to the exclusive control of
the officer.'

(dissenting opinion...)."

15
Then he goes on, "Indeed, the facts, as found at the
16
suppression hearing and affirmed by the Appellate Division, were
17
to the effect that the jacket was searched after the defendant
18
was removed from the vehicle and then placed under arrest."
19
MR. CAMBRIA:

Yes.

20

QUESTION:

Now, that suggests more the exclusive con­

21

trol type of thing that the Government is arguing against, rathe|r
22
than the grabbable reach thing.
23
MR. CAMBRIA:

I think, in this case, that the court

24
of appeals

decision can be read to say, since it was in the

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

60

1

exclusive control of the officer and it was not within the grab-

2

bable reach of the defendants, then it doesn't fit within the

3

Chimel doctrine.

4

stands for, by saying, we have it in the police officer's posses

5

sion which, under Chadwick and Sanders, he should therefore take

6

it down to and have the magistrate examine it.

7

And I think that's exactly what that footnote

QUESTION:,

So you agree with the United States, I

8

gather, if the court of appeals, if the opinion below is read as

9

establishing a control test, you don't defend that?

10

n
12
13
14
15
16

MR. CAMBRIA:

That established a control — if there

would have been testimony in this case that the material was
within the grabbable reach of the individuals, it would be a
different case.
QUESTION:

Well, I know.

But if a man is carrying his

jacket when he gets out of the car and they arrest him and the
officer takes his jacket from him, then it's under the complete
control of the officer.

17

MR. CAMBRIA:

Of the officer.

18

QUESTION:

Now, if the court below meant that you

19

couldn't search that jacket, you do not defend that view?
20

MR. CAMBRIA:

I see this — I see no reason to defend

21

it on this record.

I believe that it could be defended under

22

Chadwick and Sanders, but I do not see the reason to do it here.
23

QUESTION:

Neither Chadwick nor Sanders involved, and

24

I think you'll agree with this, a claim that the search was

I submit that it wasn't made because

that the various arguments -MR. CAMBRIA:

case.

That it was not a valid argument.

— would'not have been valid.

MR. CAMBRIA:

11
12

Well, the opinions of the court indicate

We are in a better position than.that

There we have the arrestees standing by the trunk at the

time, two of them, and this unlocked briefcase is pulled out of
an open trunk, at that time.

My case is entirely different than

14

that.

We have people outside and he's inside, and so on.

And

15

so that's why.

But I say this, Sanders and Chadwick are in­

16

volved to the degree that we have to deal with the Government's
17

argument which is, just the arrest alone gives you the area or
18

the zone of search.

I say it does not because under Chadwick

19

and Sanders we have a privacy expectation in these articles.
20

The petitioner's case, of course, deals with Chimel
21

squarely.

And as I've indicated, the record does not support

22

their claim at all.
23

No, it was not raised, and it finds no

One of the clarifications I might make

is that it was after the time of the discovery of the cocaine

that the officer then said, whose jacket is

MR. CAMBRIA:
