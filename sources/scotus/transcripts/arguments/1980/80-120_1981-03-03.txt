MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

next in St. Martin's Evangelical Church v. South Dakota.
Mr. Schilling, I think you may now proceed whenever

you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD THOMAS SCHILLING, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MR. SCHILLING:

8
9

We'll hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We suggest that the primary question before the

10
11

Court is whether churches that operate elementary and secon­

12

dary schools are exempt from the Federal Unemployment Tax Act.

13

which is known as FUTA, as that Act is applied by the States.

14

If the Court should find that these schools are

15

not, these churches are not exempt, then we have a second

16

question, and that is whether coverage under FUTA would vio­

17

late either or both of the religion clauses of the First

18

Amendment.

19

The petitioners are St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran

20

Church, which is separately incorporated under South Dakota

21

law, and it operates an elementary day school.

22

petitioner, Northwestern Lutheran Academy, is owned and oper­

23

ated by the Wisconsin Synod, and it is a four-year prepara­

24

tory school for entrance into one of the Synod colleges In

25

preparation for either the teaching or the preaching ministry.
3

The other

1

It should be noted that all teachers are regarded as

2

ministers of the Wisconsin Synod.

3

appeals referee in the original administrative hearing.

4

They have equal status with their preaching minister counter­

5

parts and voting rights on doctrinal matters in the church.

6

Now, neither of these schools that we're talking about are

7

separately incorporated.

8
9

This was found by the

Prior to 1970 the Federal Unemployment Tax Act
did not cover nonprofit or tax-exempt organizations.

In

10

1970, however, Congress required the states to cover non­

11

profit corporations and when it did this it created a

12

Section 3309(b) which specifically exempted from coverage

13

certain nonprofit employers or services.

14

section, 3309(b)(1) has two parts, the subsection (a) which

15

exempts those in the employ of a church, convention, or

16

association of churches; and subsection (b) exempts those

17

in the employ of an organization which is operated primarily

18

for religious purposes and, which is not an issue here,

19

which organization is operated, supervised, controlled, or

20

principally supported by a church, convention, or association

21

of churches.

22

Now, the first

Subsection (2) deals with their ministers and mem­

23

bers of religious orders.

Subsection (3) exempted those in

24

the employ of elementary and secondary schools.

25

exemptions are not pertinent to our case.
4

The other

In 1976 Congress again amended FUTA effective in

1

2

1978, requiring primarily coverage of state and local em­

3

ployees, agricultural workers, and domestic workers.

4

Congress did this it eliminated that elementary and secondary

5

school exclusion, and this is where the controversy begins.

6
7

QUESTION:

Suppose there had never been that third

exception?

8

MR. SCHILLING:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

12

not?
MR. SCHILLING:

14

MR. SCHILLING:

17
18
19

20
21

I think it had no effect on paro­

chial schools.
QUESTION:

16

I think that third exception was --

Do you think it is just superfluous or

13

15

And wher.

It did on nonparochial?
It did on other nonprofit schools,

and perhaps it had an effect on public schools.
QUESTION:

But it was never needed to exempt the

kinds of schools Involved in this case?
MR. SCHILLING:

That's our position, yes,

Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Although that was never the view of the

Service, I guess?

22

MR. SCHILLING:

23

Department after repeal.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. SCHILLING:

That was not the view of the Labor

Or before.
Well, I think, before, Mr. Justice,
5

1

it never had occasion to arise, and I don’t think the Secre­

2

tary of Labor --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. SCHILLING:

5

Didn't they issue exemptions?

exemption is automatic,

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SCHILLING:

8

to get it.

Mr. Justice.

I mean, if --

So you never have to -You don't apply or do anything

It's there and you use it.
QUESTION:

9

No, you don't get an exemption, the

So you never knew why the tax wasn't

10

collected from religious schools?

11

ones of the exemptions was being applied?
MR. SCHILLING:

12

You didn't know which

That's correct.

Well, after this

13

exemption, this elementary and secondary school exemption

14

was removed; it seems that the State bases its argument on

15

repeal of this subsection (3).

16

as it remains is clear, and that the statute controls, and

17

that legislative history or intent is really not an issue.
QUESTION:

18
19

Are you talking about the South Dakota

statute?
MR. SCHILLING:

20
21

We maintain that the statute

I'm talking about the South Dakota

statute, which is a mirror Image of the federal statute.
QUESTION:

22

But if the South Dakota Supreme Court

23

has construed the South Dakota statute, aren't we bound by

24

that?

25

MR. SCHILLING:

I don't think so, Mr. Justice,
6

1

because the South Dakota statute is so closely interwoven

2

with the federal statute, and --

3

QUESTION:

That question bothered me, in reading

4

the briefs in this case, and the only discussion of it I founc

5

was in Footnote 2 of the Government's amicus brief which is

6

rather short; it may be correct.

7

parties —

8

this doesn't involve purely a question of state law.

9

But you don't -- none of the

don't discuss that question, whether or not

MR. SCHILLING:

Well, I suggest, Mr. Justice, that

10

it does not because the penalties to the states, if they don't

11

comply, are so severe --

12
13

QUESTION:

But the State Supreme Court seemed to be

talking about the South Dakota law, didn't it?

14

MR. SCHILLING:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Mr. Justice, I think --

It sets it out on page A-3 of its

opinion, and that's the one it discusses.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that because of the

18

interaction with the federal law and the question in the

19

case, that that alters the usual rule that we won't reexamine

20

a state court's interpretation of its own statutes?

21

MR. SCHILLING:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I

22

think that the jurisdiction of course is there with the con­

23

stitutional question we've raised, but I think the Court also,

24

without the constitutional question, has jurisdiction to

25

decide this question, because of the
7

interrelationship

1

between the state statute and the federal statute.
QUESTION:

2

You're saying, then, it's like the

3

Zacchini v. Scripps case we decided two or three years ago

4

where we felt that the state court might have decided this

5

case differently had they not been under a misapprehension as

6

to federal law?
MR. SCHILLING:

7

8

I think that's correct, yes;

Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

9

Well, suppose we ruled that the federal

10

law didn't intend to subject religious schools to this tax?

1 1

Suppose we just ruled that?

12

them in South Dakota, until the Legislature acted.
MR. 'SCHILLING:

13

You would still be subject to

We think this Court has power,

14

Mr. Justice, to overrule and reverse the South Dakota

15

Supreme Court -QUESTION:

16
17

Dakota statute.

This Court lacks the power to do that.

QUESTION:

18

Well, not as to the meaning of a South

Until the Supreme Court changed its mind,

19

the South Dakota statute would continue to mean exactly what

20

it meant.

21

QUESTION:

Well, unless, under cases like Zacchini

22

or Benguet Consolidated Mines, we were to vacate and remand

23

for reconsideration free of any misapprehension the state

24

court might have had about the federal law question involved.

25

MR, SCHILLING:

If you did not want to get to the
8

1

constitutional question, yes, Mr. Justice.

2

really think you have to get to the constitutional question.
QUESTION:

3

And we don't

Well, the point of it is that if your

4

state supreme court construed the state statute in reliance

5

on an understanding of federal law that we say was erroneous,

6

and we send it back, we couldn't change it from your state

7

supreme court; but we could send it back to them, that's the

8

suggestion, and let them reconsider their interpretation of

9

the state statute in light of what we've said about the

10

federal question.
MR. SCHILLING:

11

12

Brennan.

13

not follow or wish --

That might be correct, Mr. Justice

And I think we'd have to come back if they would

14

QUESTION:

Well, we might have another case.

15

MR. SCHILLING:

And we'd have another case.

Because

16

we do have the constitutional issue.

I think that the South

17

Dakota Supreme Court's interpretation was so heavily reliant

18

on what the Secretary of Labor suggests and so heavily

19

reliant on what the federal statute said, because they kept

20

using the 3309 provisions, that I still think that that would

21

be our position, that this Court does have jurisdiction aside

22

from the constitutional question.

23

But our position under the statute, whether it be

24

South Dakota or the federal statute, is that these churches

25

are exempt either under subsection (a) because the services
9

1

performed are in the employ of a church, convention, or asso­

2

ciation of churches.

3

subsection (b) because the services are for an organization

4

which is operated primarily for religious purposes.

5

gument primarily is based on the statute.

We also think they might be exempt under

I will first discuss (a).

6

Our ar­

I think under subsection

7

(a) we have to define the simple language, "service performed

8

in the employ of a church."

9

what the word "church" means.

And I think we have to define
Now, the South Dakota appeals

10

referee defined the word "church" very narrowly.

11

that the word "church" meant an individual house of worship,

12

as has been interpreted to him to mean by the Secretary of

13

Labor.

14

We think the appeals referee is wrong --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SCHILLING:

He said

And the Department of Labor.
-- and the Department of Labor is

17

wrong, because a building can't employ somebody.

18

that the facts show that the school operated by St. Martin

19

church is not separately incorporated, it's not a legal enti­

20

ty, the members of the church congregation control its opera­

21

tion; and, number three, the school is completely financed by

22

the church.

23

paid by the church.

24

25

I think

If the tax is going to be paid, it's going to be

Likewise Northwestern Lutheran Academy is not
separately incorporated.

Its control is by the Synod, and
10

1

its principal source of support is from the Synod.

2

look at the common dictionary meaning of the word "church"

3

it refers to a body or organization of religious believers,

4

and that's, I think, the definition that we should use.

5

I think it's interesting that when Congress recodified the

6

Internal Revenue Code in 1954, it stated that the term should

7

be all-inclusive, and should be interpreted to include other

8

organizations which as integral parts of the church are en­

9

gaged in carrying out the church's functions, whether indi­

11

I think there are two excellent briefs by the

12

Catholic Conference arid' by the Lutheran Church-Missouri

13

Synod

14

to time Congress has used these same words-, ".church, conven­

15

tion,- or association of churches," and of course it's our

16

position that when Congress did this it kept the same meaning.

17

We think Congress intended a broad and a general meaning.

From time

18

Now, when Congress recodified the Code in 1954, the

19

words "or religious order" were also in the statute they were

talking about.

22

limit and confuse this broad definition that they Intended.

23

And those words "or religious order" were

The United States as amicus curiae implies that

24

church schools are not exempt under this section because

25

they're not a church.

Well, I don't think that's the issue.
11

I think the issue is whether these church schools,

1

2

or the services performed in these church schools which are

3

not separately incorporated, are performing services in the

4

employ of the church.
QUESTION:

5

Are you saying that they are essentially

6

the same, substantially the same as the Sunday School classes

7

or summer school classes held traditionally at Lutheran

8

churches and others?
MR. SCHILLING:

9
10

that the school is a basic part of the church's mission.
QUESTION:

In other words, it's an implement of the

church?

MR. SCHILLING:

QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I think

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

Is it governed by state rules?

Does it

Aren't they different?

MR. SCHILLING:

6

Yes, they do.

Well, Sunday Schools are not a re­

quirement of compulsory school attendance.
QUESTION:

9

A preschool --

Well, I mean, you said in answer to the

10

Chief Justice that it was just the same as the Sunday School.

11

You didn't really mean that, did you?
MR. SCHILLING:

12

I meant, insofar as the inculca­

13

tion of religious doctrine goes, I did.

14

quirements of education, I did not.

15

state requirements and certification is one that might very

well get to this Court some day.

Insofar as state re­

I think this question of

The state has police power to require

attendance at primary school, does it not?

MR. SCHILLING:

QUESTION:

Yes, it does.

It could not, under the religion clauses,

You referred to the Synod, and according

7

to your brief the membership of the Synod is the churches

themselves rather than church officials, is that correct?
MR. SCHILLING:

QUESTION:

11

MR. SCHILLING:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SCHILLING:

14

QUESTION:

15

In the Lutheran organization?
That is correct.

The dictionary meaning includes both.

So

That's correct, Mr. Justice.
the Synod is an assembly or a

group of Lutheran churches, not of people?
MR. SCHILLING:

16
17

That is correct.

That's correct.

The membership

are the churches.
QUESTION:

18

Mr. Schilling, maybe I'm laboring the

19

point, but the referee found, as I remember, that the primary

20

purpose of the school was education rather than religious

21

training.

Do you dispute that finding?
MR. SCHILLING:

22

Yes, I do dispute that finding

23

The referee found that religion is inculcated in everything

24

they teach, but then he said that the primary purpose was

25

education.

The word "primary" means fundamentally, in the
14

1

first place, or of first importance.

2

that the reason that churches provide

3

that's

4

strictly to inculcate religious beliefs.

doctrine and for extending its doctrine, and its constitution

These schools do perform the same educa­

10

tional function that public schools do insofar as the general

11

education that is needed by a child, doesn't it?

12

MR. SCHILLING:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

They do; yes, Mr. Justice.

But, certainly, logically, they wouldn't

even exist if they didn't have some function beyond that.
MR. SCHILLING:

That is correct.

Their function

16

beyond that is to inculcate the religious doctrine into every­

17

thing they teach, and I think that was recognized by this

18

Court in the establishment cases in the early '70s.

19

QUESTION:

Well, is it any different in this situa­

20

tion from the schools of the Roman Catholic churches and

21

others that we have dealt with?

22

MR. SCHILLING:

I think the situation insofar as

23

Roman Catholic schools or Baptist schools is all the same.

24

I think the statute that we're talking about, if we're talking

25

about the federal statute, is so broad that no matter what the

say they were similar, though.■
MR. SCHILLING:

Well, I think they're pretty simi­

16

lar, insofar as their -- similar insofar as their inculcating

17

of religious doctrine.

18

QUESTION:

And I gather from what you've just said,

19

or said a few moments ago, that you don't think that the

20

question of whether the church is a separate corporation is a

21

dispositive question?

22

MR. SCHILLING:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. SCHILLING:

25

QUESTION:

I don't, Your Honor.

In this case they are not.
I don't think the fact --

I say, in this case they are not, and
16

1

you rather emphasized that in your statement of the facts.
MR. SCHILLING:

2

We emphasized the fact that they

3

are not, because in our case, of course, we have that fact.

4

But I think, if you read Congress's statement, which also

5

appears in the conferee statement when they recodified the

6

Code, they used the term, that whether they're carrying out

7

the function of the church, where there are separate corpo­

8

rations "or otherwise."

9

tion of church, convention, or association of churches, they

10

were all-inclusive, no matter what the organizational struc­

11

ture of a particular religious body is.
QUESTION:

12

So I think under this broad defini­

So even though something were:incorpo­

13

rated separately as a school, albeit a parochial school,

14

that would not be a dispositive question in your submission?

positive question.

I don't think that would be a dis­

Why are the institutions of higher

learning that are religious covered?
MR. SCHILLING:

19

Why are they covered?

I think

20

there's a difference between elementary schools and secondary

21

schools.
QUESTION:

22

Well, how about for purposes of the

23

statute?

Why wouldn't an institution of higher learning that

24

is controlled by a church, why wouldn't it fall within sub­

25

section (a) or (b)?

18

MR. SCHILLING:

2

Then that was repealed in 1970.

At which time they created this subsection (3).
QUESTION:

3

How did you know that colleges were

4

exempt under that section rather than under the church sec­

5

tion?
MR. SCHILLING:

6

They were never exempt.

Because

7

Congress did not provide an exemption for them unless they

8

could come in under (1); they could come in as primarily

9

religious.

I think Congress, when it spoke -- when Congress

10

came out in the '69-'70, when they brought these various non­

11

profit organizations in, specifically said in its reports

12

that a separately incorporated organization like an orphanage

13

or a home for the aged would not be covered.

14

cally said that, in these reports, that institutions of higher

15

education were meant to be covered unless they were seminaries

16

or novitiates or something like that.

17

QUESTION:

And it specifi­

Would your argument be different if the

18

exemption that was repealed had exempted the. employees of

19

church-related and other private schools?

20
21

22
23

MR. SCHILLING:

I think our exemption would still

come back under 3309(b)(1), either -(a) or -(b).
QUESTION:

Even though Congress had thought that it

was repealing the exemption for those people?

24

MR. SCHILLING:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Well, it seems to me that under the
19

1

plain

language of (l)(a) at least, to be exempt, the employ­

2

ment has to be of the church, or convention, or association of

3

churches, not of a separate corporation.

MR. SCHILLING:

13

MR. SCHILLING:

14

QUESTION:

That's right.

But it would

be dispositive of whether

15

or not there were a separate corporation, wouldn't it?

16

And if the employment were by a school, then (l)(a) wouldn't

cover it.

MR. SCHILLING:

MR.SCHILLING:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

It might then come under (l)(b).

It might or might not come under (l)(b).
That's right, Mr. Justice.

So the corporate organization is disposi­

tive, at least with respect to (l)(a).
MR. SCHILLING:

Isn't it?

I don't think so, because when

24

Congress defined the words "church, convention, or association

25

of churches," it used that language, "separate corporation
20

1

or otherwise" in its definition.

2

QUESTION:

Well, I'm looking at the statute, which

is what Congress enacted.

churches.

MR. SCHILLING:

MR. SNYDER:

Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the

Court:
24

1

Amici curiae, the States of Alabama and Nevada,

2

submit that in order to resolve this case the Court need look

3

no further than the plain language of 26 U.S.C. Section

4

3309(b)(1), Subsection (a).

5

The uncontradicted facts before this Court demon­

6

strate that employees of church schools such as petitioners

7

are "in the employ of a church, or convention, or association

8

of churches," and thus fit squarely within the statutory

9

exemption provided by Congress.

10

The question that was raised earlier concerning the

11

basis for federal jurisdiction, or this Court's jurisdiction

12

over the statutory interpretation here, I think is answered

13

by two factors.

14

Supreme Court decision makes it clear they are relying solely

15

on their understanding of congressional intent and the meaning

16

of the federal statute.

17

petitioner's appendix, in the opinion there, "the threshold

18

issue is congressional intent."

19

that opinion is clear, that they are relying on their under­

20

standing of the Secretary of Labor's interpretation and of the

21

interpretation of the federal statute.

22

Number one, a review of the South Dakota

They state at page A-5 of the

Under those circumstances, there are a number of

23

cases from this Court that stand for the proposition that

24

an erroneous understanding of federal law which is introduced

25

into a state court decision is properly the subject of federal
25

1

review even though the state court could choose voluntarily

2

to read its own statute differently; where it states that it

3

is relying on its understanding of federal law, this Court

4

can correct such a misapprehension.

5

I think one of the best cases for that proposition

6

is Standard Oil Company v. Johnson, which is cited at

7

316 US 481.

8

that it will review an interpretation of the California high­

9

Court in the decision that's under review.

stipulated as a matter of fact that in our states all of the

14

Catholic, Lutheran, and fundamental Baptist church schools

15

have no legal existence separate from their respective churche s.

In those schools church officials such as the pastor or the

17

priest hire and fire all the employees of the school.

18

officials discipline and control the work of the employees.

I don't believe it is.

under the Secretary's interpretation many of these schools

12

since they are in the same building perhaps would be exempt.

But we submit that reliance upon what building the school is

MR. MEIERHENRY:

But I think, as you watch the

legislative history of 1970, they specifically approach

schools, and then in 1978 they specifically said that schools,

18

whether they're public, private, or parochial schools, would

not have an exemption.

20

Act was passed for the benefit of employees, of people who

21

are hired by others, whether they're hired by schools, or

22

whatever, and that these were exemptions.

23

in the intent of Congress, as they have consistently broadened

unemployment coverage, was to narrow the scope of exceptions.

And when they looked at the schools, they said, if we just

Literally?
No, I would say, not.

Because the

individual, as the records show here, the individual is paid

by the church, but they're employed by the school with their

separate board to oversee -- which is within the church, but

15

it's a separate board which hires a principal and eventually

runs the school, the entity.

And in that regard, I want to talk about the monetary effect -

the Court:
Until the Attorney General of the State of South

19

20

Dakota arose and addressed the question of the coverage of the

21

statute that's involved here, I had not heard a word today

22

about the purposes for which the statute that is being con­

Congress.

QUESTION:

But it's not simply a remedial statute -Well, aren't most statutes remedial?

Aren't they intended to remedy something?
MR. SULLIVAN:

4

I think that's right, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, and that's always bothered me, about how you dis­

6

We have a statute that goes to the very subsistence

16

time of the Great Depression suffered unemployment, and the

17

result of this unemployment, after a protracted time, was that

18

they were forced to accept charity.

19

a judgment of our society that people should not have to

accept charity, that they should be able to participate in an

the day when they may become unemployed.

This statute represents

then there wouldn't be any exceptions at all.

That's true, Mr. Chief Justice.

15

MR. SULLIVAN:

That's right.

And the people who are

exempted are exempted for specific reasons.

17

exempted because of the problems that may arise in the case

18

of ministers, also for the reason that ministers generally

19

aren't laid off but belong to a church who continue to employ

20

them and may not suffer the same --

But the inquiry in number (1) is, who are you
Isn't it?

MR. SULLIVAN:

That's right, Mr. Justice.
56

And I'm

reaching and I will reach that.
QUESTION:

2

Number (1) doesn't ask at all, what are

3

your duties?

But who are you employed by?

4

on the other hand, asks exclusively, what do you do?
MR. SULLIVAN:

5

And Number (2),

Well, I think I might subscribe to

6

Mr. Justice Stevens' slight differentiation in the way he

7

has put that, because I have the sense that it would be

8

helpful to me, but I'm not quite sure I understand the dis­

9

tinction.

10

However, I think in construing this particular

statute, something has been overlooked here.
QUESTION:

11

If you'd read the laundry case of a few

12

days ago you'd find that'it's a very dangerous thing on which

13

to rely.
MR. SULLIVAN:

14

I think what needs to be pointed out

15

here is that this construction of "church," first of all, is

16

not as irrational as it sounds on its face when put in the

17

argument that a building can employ anybody.

18

the Secretary has given.to it is as a house of worship,

19

meaning the core religious establishment, and in that sense -QUESTION:

20

The construction

According to the Secretary, does a per­

21

son, in order to be exempt from the Unemployment Tax Act,

22

have to be not only employed by that house of worship but

23

carry out his duties in that house of worship, his employment

24

duties ?

25

MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, I would think that in most
57

1

cases

2

QUESTION:

No, in most cases that question perhaps

3

needn't be asked, but I'm asking it.

4

what's the Secretary's point of view?

5

6

MR. SULLIVAN:

Not for most cases, but

Well, I think that it would be,

that the person --

7

QUESTION:

Well, he both has to be employed by --

8

that is his salary has to be paid by the house of worship,

9

and his employment duties have to be within the house of

10

worship, is that it?

11

12

MR. SULLIVAN:

Because that

would exclude, obviously --

13
14

No, that's not it.

QUESTION:

It seems to me it would exclude people

who are literally covered by the statute.

15

MR. SULLIVAN:

That's correct, and I would say

16

that the source, the analogy

17

relying here, is the similar problem that's been worked out

18

in the Fair Labor Standards Act cases, where we have, the

19

statutory language says, employed by an establishment.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SULLIVAN:

on

which the Secretary is

Right.
The establishment, in that case,

22

refers to a physical or geographical location from which a

23

person may go out to work in some other place, but where he

24

is based.

25

local office of General Motors and his employer may be

And in that case, the establishment may be the

58

General Motors, but he is employed by the establishment for

the purposes of the Act, and employed by the church, we sub­

Well, I would assume in that case,

Mr. Justice Marshall, that Hogate's Restaurant paid the

10

janitor, and that consequently we wouldn't have a problem

11

for purposes of this statute.

12

QUESTION:

13
14

Except in our church we called him a

sexton, and you'd better not call him a janitor.
MR. SULLIVAN:

The other point that I would make

15

about the Secretary's construction of the first exemption is

16

that this exemption is not something, that this construction

17

is not something that the Secretary has dreamed up out of

18

whole cloth as a result of these amendments.

19

exemption, this exemption as construed, was construed by the

20

Secretary in 1970 at the time that nonprofit organizations

21

became subject to the Act and it's not a recent development.

22

Congress amended the Act in 1976 knowing that this

23
24

25

This is an

is the way the Secretary of Labor had construed the Act.
QUESTION:

Does the Secretary take the position

that an employee of a seminary, religious seminary, is not
59

1

within

-(b),'-(1)(b)?
MR. SULLIVAN:

2

The Secretary's position is that any

3

employee of a religious seminary would not be subject to

4

coverage of the Act.

5

QUESTION:

Because of (1)(b)?

6

MR. SULLIVAN:

That's correct.

And that is, I

7

think, based in the legislative history of the 1970 amend­

8

ments.

9

in another statute for the coverage of the same people who

I would also point out that in 1974 Congress provided

10

are being covered here, and consequently petitioners' argu­

11

ment asked the Court to believe not only that Congress was

12

unaware of what the Secretary's construction of the exemptions

13

had been, but also that Congress, without saying a word,

14

intended to withdraw coverage that it had already provided.

15

And it seems to .me that's quite an assumption, 'given the

16

remedial purposes of the. statute.

17

And third, petitioners' argument asks that the Court

18

believe that Congress was simply in error as to the number of

19

people who would be covered by this statute.

20

important to note that before lunch the statement was made

21

that in this chart that the Senate Finance Committee, I be­

22

lieve, staff prepared, that it simply said, "242,000

23

employees" against the category, "nonprofit organizations."

24

The fact of the matter is that that makes perfect sense be­

25

cause of all nonprofit organizations, and the various ways
60

I think it's

1

that they could have their coverage changed.

2

schools that were in issue at that time, and so that all of

3

those employees had to be school employees.

naturally be much, much lower.

SULLIVAN:

18

It's not something that was published

I would finally like to point out that both Congress

19

and the Secretary have seen the need here for a bright line

20

test.

21

a very subjective inquiry would be necessitated by reading

22

the (b) exemption of the statute as applicable to parochial

23

schools.

There's

5

QUESTION:

And that's a very bright line.

6

MR. SULLIVAN:

I think there's been a lot of talk

7

about parochial schools as if they were marbles, and that

8

they were all alike.

9

are all church schools organized in the same way?

And the question was asked this morning,
And the

10

answer was, yes.

11

for me that all denominations organize their church schools

12

in the same way.

13

on whether the particular doctrines which the organization

14

espouses allow it to incorporate is ludicrous.

15

one of the problems that Congress was concerned with, it's

16

one of the reasons that the Secretary has adopted the con­

17

struction that he has, to say that schools are schools, and

18

they're going to be subject to coverage of the Act.

19

20
21

Well, I defy anybody to produce evidence

To make an organization's exemption depend

QUESTION:

But seminaries are schools, and yet

they were not subject to the coverage of the Act.
MR. SULLIVAN:

And Sunday Schools are schools, and

22

they're not subject to the Act.

23

is the proper analogy.

24

25

And that's

QUESTION:

And we would say that that

62

MR. SULLIVAN:
to that.

3

Again, I cannot speak authoritatively

I wouldn't know the answer to that.
QUESTION:

If you can't answer that I think I can

4

take judicial notice of the fact that generally speaking in

5

this country, in all faiths, Sunday School teachers are

6

volunteers.

7

MR. SULLIVAN:

I would just close with one example

8

that follows up on something that the Chief Justice said this

9

morning.

And that is, suppose that we have an archdiocesan,

10

a school owned by the

11

of Washington, and he decides that he will close all arch­

12

diocesan schools where the enrollment falls below 200 students

13

for three years running.

14

that they want to maintain a parochial school for their

15

children and they go to the Archbishop and they say, if you

16

give us the building we will run the school.

17

they run the school, they continue to have the same teachers --
