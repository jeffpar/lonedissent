ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. KIRK BROWN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

We'll hear arguments

BROWN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
In my argument today I will address the petitioners.

1 1

Mr. Robert Parratt and Mr. Francis Lugenbill, as the defen­

12

dants.

13

are the positions they originally occupied in this action.

I will refer to Mr. Taylor as the plaintiff.

These

As a bit of factual background, in April, 1975, the

14
15

plaintiff was housed in a penal institution in the State of

16

Nebraska of which Mr. Parratt was the warden and Mr. Lugenbill

17

was the supervisor of the hobby counter, which is an internal

18

organism which provides hobby goods for inmates at that insti­

19

tution .

20

The plaintiff ordered hobby material while he was a

21

prisoner; money was deducted from his inmate account to pay

22

the vendor for those goods.

23

plaintiff violated the disciplinary rule and was placed in

24

disciplinary segregation.

25

the plaintiff was still on disciplinary segregation and was

counter, and the material was held at the hobby counter for

MR. BROWN:

Do I agree that it was against prison

14

answers to the interrogatories filed by defendant

15

and defendant Lugenbill, they indicate that those signatures

16

were affixed as part of their clerical duties.

17

this poses some problems at this point in time, particularly

18

in view of the fact that this case was resolved against us on

19

a motion for summary judgment.

20

does appear to be some question with regard to that particu­

21

lar aspect of the case.

No, I do not.

plaintiff against these defendants.

12

The plaintiff during this entire course .of conduct

13

never filed a claim under the Nebraska Tort Claims Act for

14

return of the value of these materials, which, it is unques­

15

tioned, were lost at the institution.

16

I would like to address two questions which are

17

raised by our brief today in oral argument.

18

whether the existence of a state-created remedy for property

19

loss caused by the negligence of state employees provides ade­

20

quate legal process under the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process

21

Clause.

22

gence in the context of a property loss case can create per­

23

sonal liability under Section 1983.

24
25

First of all,

Second, I would like to discuss whether simple negli­

Mr. Justice Douglas in Monroe v. Pape set out three
basic purposes for the enactment of Section 1983.
5

Number one

1

was to override unconstitutional state laws.

Number two was

2

to provide a remedy where state laws were inadequate.

3

three was to provide a remedy where an adequate state law was

4

not in fact available to a plaintiff.

Number

None of these goals are furthered by imposing•lia­

5
6

bility on these defendants.

7

presented, and there is no showing on this record that an ade­

8

quate. state remedy is1 not in fact available to a plaintiff

9

under these circumstances.
QUESTION:

10

There is no state law question

How would your argument change If the

11

inmate said, you've lost my property, and the answer Is, yes,

12

we have.

13

says, well, aren't you going to either replace it or pay me

14

for it?

And they say, no, absolutely not.

15

remedy?

Not that we know of.

16

We did it negligently, but we lost it.

MR. BROWN:

And he

Do I have any

If that were the case, then I think

17

what you've got is a problem of denying the inmate, if in

18

fact that was within the power of the people, denying him

19

the access to his remedy.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Yes, it's no longer just a piece of

negligence, is it?
MR. BROWN:

No.

I think you have to characterize

23

the case entirely different.

One way, it would be similar to.

24

at that point, infringing on that inmate's right to access

25

to the courts.
6

QUESTION:

1

Well, suppose Texas law just hasn't got

2

any, there isn't any -- or Nebraska law, there just isn't any

3

remedy, internal remedy under the state law.

4

cials are perfectly correct.

We just -- there just isn't any

5

remedy as far as we know of.

And we're not going to pay you,

6

and we're not going to replace the property.
QUESTION:

7

8

But that's no longer negligence.

That's

a willful deprivation of his property, isn't it?

Exactly.

They either are going to give

him a remedy or it's going to be that, isn't it?

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BROWN:

Yes.
Well, but I think the thing that you

13

would -- I guess I would urge that type of situation be eval­

14

uated in the context not so much of imposing personal lia­

15

bility on these persons.

16

an institution and, not by his personal participation, but

17

certainly property is lost on occasion in these institutions.

18

I don't know that you have a situation where the inmate comes

19

to him and says, I want to be paid, you lost my property.

20

And the warden says, in this case, yes, I know we lost your

21

property.

grounds for some interpretation in a declaratory or

injunctive sense as to whether or not the inmate has been

respect to that.
QUESTION:

4

At least you wouldn't be making the same

5

argument here if that had happened.

6

-- what would you think about a 1983 action on those very

7

facts which you just -- ?

You wouldn't be making

On those facts I would move directly to

my second argument regarding the basis of the negligence.

But it does seem --

But why?

It isn't negligence any longer.

They just say, we're not going to pay you,

8

1

MR. BROWN:

Well, if you've got the problem of what

2

is protected -- and I think you have to look at this in the

3

context, it seems to me, of personal liability, and just what

4

exactly the authority of these defendants is with respect to

5

repayment of these types of losses.

6

is that the Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment, does not

7

prohibit property deprivations.

8

9
10

Our position basically

It only requires that a legal

It is the process and not the property which is con­
stitutionally protected and constitutionally significant.

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Brown, I'm not clear on your posi­

12

tion with respect to whether or not there is a process in

13

Nebraska.

14

MR. BROWN:

15

QUESTION:

Our position is -First you imply that they failed to make

16

a claim under the Nebraska Claims Act and then you said the

17

burden is on them to demonstrate the absence of the Claims

18

Act, I guess.

19

or not there is a state remedy?

20

Well, what is your position on this, whether

MR. BROWN:

Our position is that a state remedy

21

exists and that if the plaintiff is to make out a case that he

22

has been denied property without due process of law, he not

23

only needs to show that he has lost his property but that by

24

some mechanism he has been denied due process of law, that

25

that loss has occurred to him without some type of adequate
9

1

process, whatever process might be found to be due him under

2

those circumstances.
QUESTION:

3

Well, is it -- as a matter of fact, I

4

guess, you should be the expert on what Nebraska law is, here.

5

Is there a state procedure by which he could recover the mone­

6

tary equivalent of the value of his hobby?
MR.

7

BROWN:

The Nebraska State Tort Claims Act

8

regularly considers and regularly pays, where deemed appro­

9

priate, claims for property lost, property damage, this type

10

of thing, of the inmates of our state institutions.

11

QUESTION:

I see.

12

QUESTION:

And the inmate has to bring an action in

13

Court?
MR. BROWN:

14

The inmate initially files a claim

15

with the State Tort Claims Board.

16

tively --

QUESTION:

18

MR. BROWN:

That claim is administra­

That's your administrative agency.
-- is administratively reviewed.

The

19

claim at that point is either determined, the department

20

against whom it occurred, and then, if the inmate is not satis­

21

fied with the result of that, he may appeal that directly to

22

our district court.

23

QUESTION:

24

rather than a trial, de novo?

25

MR. BROWN:

And that is -- but that is an appeal

Well, the trial would go de novo.
10

There is no record created in front of the Board.

I don't believe he does; no.
And what does he have to prove in dis­

MR. BROWN:

13

In district court he would have to

14

prove that there was negligence on the part of the State of

15

Nebraska, or one of the employees of the State of Nebraska.

16

Simple negligence would suffice at that stage of the pro­

QUESTION:

MR. BROWN:

17

QUESTION:

I would answer -I mean, is that the way you understand

it?

19

MR. BROWN:

20

QUESTION:

21

Contrary to the obligation of the State

not to take his property without compensating him, is that it:

16

18

It was claimed that he was denied his

property without due process of law.

14
15

What constitutional deprivation is

That's my understanding of it; yes.
But there was in effect an eminent do­

main case rather than a denial of due process?

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. BROWN:

They are different.
Well, I guess in my evaluation of this,

24

we aren't talking about an eminent domain case, because that

25

is where the element of intent comes in.
13

And under these

1

circumstances, where there is no intentional taking, there is

2

certainly no opportunity to provide this man a pre-loss pro­

3

cess, whatever would be determined to be appropriate in that

4

taking, as in an eminent domain case where you could go in

5

and establish the value before the property is:taken.

6

opportunity simply isn't presented unless you have at least,

I would guess, at least a reckless or a wanton and willful --

8

you can argue in that span whether or not there is some

9

intellectual functioning -QUESTION:

10

That

But your answer to his claim consistently

1 1

has been and it still is here that there is no denial of due

MR. BROWN:

19

QUESTION:

That's correct.
So you're really saying that as long as

it,

there's been no denial

That's our position; yes.
And that would be true whether the claim

20

were a deprivation of property without due process of law, or

21

a taking of property without compensation.

22

MR. BROWN:

23

QUESTION:

24

25

That's correct.
But here he seeks also $1,000 damages

and also $1,000 punitive damages.
MR. BROWN:

That's correct.

MR. BROWN:

No, he could not get that in the claims

threshold.

MR. BROWN:

that's one of our serious concerns.

Why didn't we get it out

Our position is, even if we took the position -- or

17

if we are finally informed that this type of thing does

18

establish a constitutional violation, we are still faced with

I take it they proceed pro se normally

MR. BROWN:

He certainly has the opportunity to

QUESTION:

But may I ask about the adequate --

20

you're saying that's an adequate procedure, basically?

21

three years ago we had a case involving the procedure that

22

must be followed in shutting off electricity, when the

23

billing procedure is bad,

in effect, you had.to advise the person of his rights in order

25

to have the process adequate.

by a utility.

Two or

And the Court held,

Is there any procedure for
16

1

2

advising the inmates as to the existence of this procedure?
MR. BROWN:

At the present time there were.

3

I think if you look at the record, if you look at Exhibit B

4

on the plaintiff's complaint, it indicates that at least in

5

Janauary, 1976, that he was aware of this state procedure.

6

Now, I do not know and the record does not indicate how he

7

came to be aware, but the second exhibit to his complaint is,

8

I need the numbers on my checks so I can file my state claim.

9

Apparently he was aware of it.

Now, why at that point " -

10

having been provided that information he did not go forward

1 1

and file the claim, that's an answer I don't have.

12

and I do know from my personal contact with the system in the

13

last two years when I've worked with it, that they are regu­

14

larly informed, that if they have a problem like this, this

15

is the manner in which they can seek redress, is to proceed

16

through that type of mechanism.

17
18

QUESTION:

But --

General Brown, does Nebraska still have

the common law of torts practised in your courts?

19

MR. BROWN:

QUESTION:

I believe they do; yes.
Would a common law

23

MR. BROWN:

I guess that would be another portion

24

of our argument.

On these particular facts I have some ser­

25

ious questions as to whether liability could have been

What's the differ­

ence between you and the prisoner, in those circumstances?
MR. BROWN:

The difference, I suspect, basically,

24

between the driver, between a correctional officer operating

25

that vehicle, Is more pradtical than legal, though I am not
18

1

certain whether I can answer your question or not, because I

2

have some concern as to whether or not the tort claim proce­

3

dure might forestall that type of action against someone func­

4

tioning as a state employee.
QUESTION:

5

I'm simply not certain on that.

You think as a matter of state law it's

6

possible that the injured party might be relegated to the

7

administrative proceeding?
MR. BROWN:

8
9

I simply don't have an answer but I

certainly -- I guess from the State defense standpoint,

10

that would be an issue I would certainly want to look into

11

before I could give you a definite answer on that.

Certainly.

He's not fore­

stalled from any remedy whatsoever.
QUESTION:

concede that?

18
19

There

I simply --

16
17

You say he has one remedy or the other,

To compensate him for his personal

injuries?
MR. BROWN:

Right.

Moving on to the negligence

23

question, we think it must be viewed in the narrow context

24

of this case, and that is whether Section 1983 prohibits the

25

unintentional deprivation of property by persons acting under
19

1

color of state law, and whether such acts would create per­

2

sonal liability?

3

Section 1983, cases of this Court interpreting Section 1983,

4

or the logic, purpose and public policy of that Act, support

5

liability in this instance.

We do not believe that the language of

There is no evidence that these defendants directly

6
7

caused or personally participated in the loss of this property

8

Rizzo v..Goode rejected liability without an affirmative parti­

9

cipation by the defendants even in an equitable action.

And

10

I think we have to realize that the burden of proof, what

11

needs to be proved to obtain equitable or injunctive release,

12

or declaratory relief, under this Act, is not as stringent as

13

should be or what has been imposed to obtain personal lia­

14

bility .
QUESTION:

15
16

Parratt was the superintendent of the

correctional facility?
MR. BROWN:

17

Yes, chief executive officer; technically

18

the warden of that particular institution.

19

in

20

stop a pattern of clearly unconstitutional conduct by subor­

21

dinates could be enjoined under Section 1983, but in that

22

case there was no evidence that defendants knew that there

23

was a problem and that liability was then rejected.

24

we have a similar situation here.

25

this record that there was a general failure with the system,

Baker

Justice Blackmun

that that reckless failure to

20

We think

There's no indication on

and there's no question as to whether these men particularly

2

participated in it.

So I think we've got a problem there.

QUESTION:

Mr. Brown, if a prison guard stole an

4

article of personal property from an inmate, what remedy woulc

5

he have?

6

MR. BROWN:

7

QUESTION:

What remedy would the inmate have?
Yes.

The guard had stolen an item of

8

personal property from the inmate's -- cell.

9

took, if you allow transistor radios, that he took his radio

10
11

Let's say he

or took three books or whatever, stole them.
MR. BROWN:

Well, I think, first of all, what you

12

have is an entirely different case than you have here.

13

you're dealing with is an intentional act --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. BROWN:

What

Right.
-- and it's not our position that

16

that type of act implicates the same problems we see with

17

negligence.

18

QUESTION:

Well, does Nebraska have an action for

19

conversion or the equivalent of the old common law conversion:

20

Wouldn't that be a remedy against him?

21

MR. BROWN:

I would think it would be, not to men­

would not necessarily aid the

23

inmate, but certainly we would, I think that would fall under

our criminal laws as well.

But we're not talking about inten­

1

what now?
QUESTION: You seem to be conceding that, in my brother

2
3

Powell's example, that would be a constitutional deprivation?
MR. BROWN:

4

I'm basically saying that it presents a

5

much closer case because we're dealing with an intentional

6

act.

7

I guess I'm not -QUESTION:

Well, why is it a closer case under your

8

first argument?

9

is this remedy in the claim procedure --

10

I don't think it is.

MR. BROWN:

Certainly.

You'd still say, there

That's correct under the

11

first argument, but I guess our position is that our second

12

argument could form an independent basis, even in the absence

13

-- certainly not all states have established the types of

14

procedures we're talking about here.

15

QUESTION:

16

blend two different thoughts.

17

arguing, well, they really don't have any proof of negligence.

18

And alternatively you seem to be arguing, even if there were

19

negligence, that 1983 would not provide a remedy.

20

quite sure whether you're arguing both; I think you are.

21

MR. BROWN:

But your second argument seems to me to
You on the one hand seem to be

I'm not

Well, okay, under these facts, I think

22

I'm placed in a rather awkward position.

23

basically, is that even if there was proof of negligence,

24

that it does not constitute a violation of Section 1983.

25

What we argued in our brief is that we don't even believe,
22

Our position,

1

on this record, there is evidence of negligence.

2

those are two distinct questions too.

3

permit me -QUESTION:

5

If the Court would

Are you prepared to assume negligence

for your 1983 argument?
MR. BROWN:

But I think

For those purposes, yes.

I'd like, if

I could, to reserve the rest of my time.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

QUESTION:

23

What difference would it make for the

purposes of your case if you point that out?

24

MR. COLLERAN:

25

QUESTION:

The facts, Your Honor?

Yes.
23

1

MR. COLLERAN:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR.

If they weren't in violation -- ?

If it wasn't intentional?

COLLERAN:

Well, I think, first of all, there

4

is some evidence of intent.

5

that, I think the key is, Your Honor, is that they acted —

6

there ^ was. an' established institutional procedure which they

7

violated, and I suspect that if there had been no institu­

8

tional procedures and if they had simply left Mr. Taylor's

9

property to the wind or whoever grabbed it when it came to

10

But aside from that, I think

the institution, that there would be no difference.

11

But I'm just saying that I think the facts are

12

different than as related by the Attorney General's office

13

this morning, and they're considerably different.

14

I think the Attorney General's represented -- well,

15

as I stated, I think that they can be broken into three dif­

16

ferent categories, the first being the institutional procedure

17

that was in effect at all time pertinent hereto, and this was

18

set forth in the stipulated facts of the grievance supervisor

19

or officer prepared by the Attorney General's office, at his

20

suggestion, at a hearing on a motion for default judgment in

21

this particular case, filed on behalf of the respondent for

22

their failure to answer interrogatories.

23

And the grievance procedure was, as stipulated to,

24

that

25

institution addressed to.an inmate, at the central mail room,

normal

procedure

when

a

24

package is received at the

1

it is either that the package is delivered to the inmate's cel]

2

where he signs the package receipt, or the inmate is notified

3

to pick the package up at the hobby center and to personally

4

receipt for it.

5

from this practice are only made in exceptional circumstances,

6

and there is no record of there being any exceptional circum­

7

stance in this case, which seems to me to be an entirely

8

different case from that as represented to the Court this

9

morning by the Attorney General's office.
QUESTION:

10
1 1

And then it goes on to say that deviations

It's an exceptional circumstance because

he was in isolation.
MR. COLLERAN:

Well, there again,' Your Honor, the

17

not in the record, and I know for a fact because I have repre­

18

sented Mr. Taylor since 1973, in this and another litigation,

19

that Mr. Taylor spent time in the adjustment center at his owr

20

choosing from time to time because he felt the need to be in

21

the adjustment center for security reasons. There is nothing,

22

absolutely nothing in the record that would indicate that he

23

was there because of a disciplinary problem that --

24
25

There was nothing in the record to indicate that he

QUESTION:

He was transferred to the

The reason he was transferred there is

It doesn't matter why, but the fact that

he was in the adjustment center would be an unusual

25

1

circumstance and probably explains why he wasn't available to

2

sign for the package.

3

MR. COLLERAN:

I don't think so, Your Honor, not on

4

the facts of this case, because the facts of this case, the

5

supervisor's indicated that the fact that he was in the ad­

6

justment center was not an exceptional circumstance and did

7

not justify the conduct in this case.

8
9

QUESTION:

In the present posture of the case, at

least, we can assume negligence --

10

MR. COLLERAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. COLLERAN:

13

QUESTION:

14

All right.

On the part of the defendants.
I think there was.

At least for the purpose of the first

two issues, that have been the only issues argued here.

15

MR. COLLERAN:

16

QUESTION:

Okay.

Well,

Can we assume negligence on a -- resolvec

17

on a motion for summary judgment?

18

MR. COLLERAN:

Yes, I think we can, Judge.

I think

19

that -- Your Honor -- in this particular case, particularly,

20

I think that we have a situation where the property comes to dhe

21

institution after he has paid for it and ordered it in accor­

22

dance with institutional procedures.

23

tody when it comes to the mail room to be examined, and when

24

he goes to get the property later on it's not there.

25

reason that it's not there is because the institutional
26

It is taken into cus­

And the

1

procedures were violated, and the reason that the institu­

2

tional procedures were violated are set forth in the answers

3

to interrogatories filed on October 12, 1976, by the warden

4

and by the supervisor of the hobby center.
They set forth an'institutional procedure that is

5

6

totally foreign to what actually should have been going on

7

out there.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, now we're arguing about whether

or not there was or was not negligence as --

10

MR. COLLERAN:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

Quite properly, In response to my brother

12

Rehnquist's question.

13

General in his first two arguments that he made orally here,

14

the only two that he made orally, both assume negligence.

15

Now, in his brief, there also is contested whether, the ques­

16

tion of whether or not there was or was not negligence.

17

I don't believe we took this case to decide that.

18

But it seemed to me that the Attorney

MR. COLLERAN:

All right.

Well, I didn't understanc

19

the Attorney General's office to be that.

20

saying in effect that they were in conformance with institu­

21

tional procedures and therefore were not negligent.

22

I thought he1 was

But assuming, if we can assume, at least, some

23

negligence -- and I think that the conduct on the behalf of

24

the petitioners goes far further than just simple negligence,

25

if we can categorize it.

I think that to suggest in this
27

1

particular case that Mr. Taylor should have proceeded under

2

the State Tort Claims Act in Nebraska, frankly I find a little

3

bit shocking.

Before you get to the time you were ap­

information he needs for filing the small claims form.
MR. COLLERAN:

Correct.

That's an entirely differ­

12

ent procedure than the Nebraska Tort Claims Act.

tried to pursue the small claims court, which is the county

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

I didn't

QUESTION:

Why did he not do that?

Does the record

tell us anything about that?
MR. COLLERAN:

Why he did not pursue the Tort

Claims Act?
QUESTION:

Yes.

It seems to me, if he can get $32

8

back by filing an administrative proceeding, surely that's

9

better and more desirable than coming all the way up here?

10

MR. COLLERAN:

1 1

QUESTION:

12
13

Well,--

If not for him, at least for a lot of

other people.
MR. COLLERAN:

Well,

I think that there are several

14

deficiencies with the Nebraska Tort Claims Act, some of which

15

have been alluded to by this Court today.

16

course, is that there is no right to a trial by jury.

17
18

QUESTION:

The first, of

Well, but do you need a trial by jury in

this matter?

19

MR. COLLERAN:

20

QUESTION:

Well, but the Attorney General --

I'm talking about this specific case.

21

What is there to explain to us, if there in fact is the

22

remedy that your opponent has represented exists, how is it

23

that he wouldn't pursue it?

24

are no fees available for counsel?

25

MR. COLLERAN:

Is It just the fact that there

Oh, I think that's part of it.
31

1

I think, first of all, that he did try to pursue the grievance

2

procedures out at the institution and was denied those.

3

I sort of assumed that he was -- I can't speak for him, but

4

I assume he was probably getting a little frustrated with the

5

system and he thought he could get relief in federal court.

6

But there is no provision for attorney's fees and there is no

7

provision for the appointment of counsel, which means in

8

every instance for Mr. Taylor and those similarly situated,

9

he's going to be going it alone against the considerable re­

10

sources of the State of Nebraska.

MR. COLLERAN:

That was stipulated to by the

22

Attorney General's office.

And that, I would like to also

23

indicate, that we did not seek punitive damages in this case

24

of $1,000.

seeking was our compensatory damages in the amount of $23.50.

We abandoned that claim.

The only thing we were

MR. COLLERAN:

It is in the complaint.
It is in the complaint, but we've

abandoned that.

4

QUESTION:

But you didn't abandon $792?

5

MR. COLLERAN:

No, I did not, Your Honor.

I think

6

that under the Civil Rights Act I'm entitled to an attorney's

7

fee.

The prevailing party is entitled to attorneys' fees.
QUESTION:

8
9

Which you couldn't get under the other

one.
MR. COLLERAN:

10

Which we could not get, and I think

11

that that is a very important provision of this Act, because,

12

again, Mr. Taylor would have been forced to proceed pro se

13

under the State Tort Claims Act.
QUESTION:

14
15

That's

all he got was $25, right?
MR. COLLERAN:

16
17

Well, he only got the $25 back.

If he'd been successful; yes, that's

correct.
QUESTION:

18

Well, I mean, his judgment, that's all

19

he got?

He got the same thing he would have gotten through

20

the administrative machinery.

MR. COLLERAN:

MR. COLLERAN:

Didn't he?

No, I disagree with that.

MR. COLLERAN:

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

The only difference between what he coulc

8

have gotten under the administrative machinery and what he

did get here was zero.
MR. COLLERAN:

10
11

Well, that's a considerable differ­

ence, I think, to my client.

13

MR. COLLERAN:

14

Is that correct?

Zero?

He didn't get anything more.

I'm afraid I don't understand Your

Honor's question.
QUESTION:

15

Well, the answer is that the only addi­

16

tional money obtained in this action as to

17

to what he could have gotten in the other action was counsel's

That's my question.

probably correct.

21

I think, since Monroe v. Pape that Section 1983 is supposedly

22

to be an addition to a state remedy that a state might have

23

provided.

24

that the Administrative Procedures Act of the Tort Claims

25

Act would have been available, or a successful remedy to him.

But, again, you know, this Court has held,

It is a theoretical remedy, much the same as was discussed in

Monroe and in a line of cases since that time.

to suggest, if we take Mr. Taylor and say, all right, for a

4

Fourteenth Amendment case you have to go under the State Tort

14

No, I don't think so, Your Honor,

not at all.

15

QUESTION:

Why not?

16

MR. COLLERAN:

I think that the thrust of Section

17

1983, or the color-of-state-law provision, is the misuse of

18

power.

19

involving a state employee does not mean that there has been

20

misuse of power.

And simply because we have an automobile accident

causing an injury to the plaintiff.

25

MR. COLLERAN:

There's

Well, that's correct, for the

Fourteenth Amendment.

For Section 1983 it requires a misuse

of state power.

It's a very simple question.

high degree of negligence, Your Honor.

MR. COLLERAN:

Yes, it is.

Then what's the difference between that

That's a high degree of negligence, isn't it?

I think that

QUESTION:

Well, let me see -- I gather your posi­

tion is that 1983 requires both a violation of the Constitu­

4

tion and a violation under the color of state law.

5

MR. COLLERAN:

QUESTION:

That is correct.

And you say here there’s a violation unde r

That’s correct.

There is no --

under these facts that you've just given me, there's no way

that I can say that there has been a misuse of state power.

MR. COLLERAN:

Under color of state law sim­

Well, as I understand

Section 1983,

23

I think, as I understand Section 1983, one of the purposes

24

for its creation was the misuse of state power, and it seems

25

to me the distinguishing feature here in this particular case
38

1

is, we have the warden, who is the chief administrative offi­

2

cial of the institution, and we have the individual who is

3

charged with the responsibility of protecting the respondent's

4

property taken into custody, and they are in effect violating

5

an affirmative duty placed upon them by the institution

6

itself, by ignoring --

7

QUESTION:

Well, what's that got to do, really,

8

with whether or not there's a constitutional violation?

9

there couldn't be a constitutional violation in this case

10

And

unless the state or its agencies were the defendants --

11

MR. COLLERAN:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

Because the Constitution prohibits only

13

a state depriving somebody of property without due process of

14

law, or taking somebody's property without compensation.

15

doesn't prohibit a private party from doing so.

16

MR. COLLERAN:

I agree.

It

Maybe I didn't understand

the thrust bf Justice Rehnquist's question.
QUESTION:

Where in this litigation was the talk of

the existence of a state tort claims act raised?
MR. COLLERAN:

It was raised for the first time at

21

the application for rehearing in the 8th Circuit Court of

22

Appeals, and this, as I started to say, before was -- that was

23

a year ago, this time, which means that it was three years

24

after the statute of limitations had run on the respondent

25

in this claim.
39

QUESTION:

1

2

has it?

This lawsuit really hasn't been tried,

It went off in summary judgment?

3

MR. COLLERAN:

4

QUESTION:

5

That's correct, Your Honor.

Is the existence of the State Tort Claims

Act an affirmative defense on the part of the defendants?
MR. COLLERAN:

6

Well, I don't know that it is under

7

the

Nebraska law an affirmative defense, but the Attorney

8

General's office is charged with the administration of pro­

9

cessing the Tort Claims Act, and it seems to me that for the

10

year and some six months that they had notice of this claim,

1 1

Mr. Taylor claiming that he had been deprived of a constitu­

12

tional right, that they could have either raised that in their

13

pleadings or have told him in some other communication that

14

they felt that he was in the wrong court under the wrong law.
QUESTION:

15
16
17

Well, it certainly was not raised in the

pleadings.
MR. COLLERAN:

It certainly was not raised in the

18

pleadings; it was not raised at any time in the trial court.

19

It was not raised at any time in their brief.

40

I should

HR. COLLERAN:

1

Well, yes; that's correct.

I guess

2

it's our position, Justice Blackmun, that at this point in

3

time, it does seem to me that the State having raised it for

4

the first time in its application for rehearing, it's a little

5

tardy.

6

There's a two-year statute of limitations which expired, as

7

I indicated before, prior to the time that I was appointed

8

counsel in this case.

9

The statute of limitations has run on Mr. Taylor now.

QUESTION:

Suppose there had been ample notice to

10

him from the very outset about the tort claims procedure,

11

and he just ignored it?

12

MR. COLLERAN:

I think that under the state of the

13

law in 1975, and as I understand the law even today, that

14

that would have -- it was his choice of forum.

15

allegation of a federally protected or constitutional right

16

he thinks he's been deprived of.

17

QUESTION:

He has an

Yes, but the argument on the other side

18

is not that exhaustion of administrative remedies is con­

19

trolling. It's a question of whether there can be a violation

20

of the Due Process Clause for depriving somebody of property

21

if you stand ready to pay him for it.

22

procedure in place and if he knew about it, if they had given

23

him ample notice of it and he just ignored it?

24

25

MR. COLLERAN:

And if there is that

Well, they didn't given him ample

notice, and to the extent that he was aware of the procedures,
41

1

the grievance procedures at the institution, he did pursue

2

those, and got nowhere.

3

QUESTION:

Why isn't the same principle applicable

4

with respect to the small claims court proceeding as in your

5

responding:to Justice White's question?

6

he needed something to'file in the small claims court?

7

apparently was no obstacle to his filing there.

8

wouldn't have had a lawyer there, but most small claims courts

9

operate with no lawyer on either side, as I understand it.

10

MR. COLLERAN:

He filed -- he said
There

You said he

That is correct, and that is true in

1 1

Nebraska as well, Your Honor, and I'm just saying that in this

12

case, the only thing I know about his small claims applicatior

13

is mentioned in the tag end of his complaint, and he said

14

that he tried it and was dismissed summarily out, twice.

15

I attempted to run down the records of it, and they had no

16

trace of them, so I really don't know what went on In small

claims court.

No, I did not; it was a pro se com­

thetical that you have just set forth.

QUESTION:

You think that's immediately and clearly

different from your case?
MR. COLLERAN:

I think it is.

I think that here

the individual ordered the property and in accordance with

20

institutional procedures relied upon those procedures and was

21

denied that property when it got to the institution.

22
23
24

25

QUESTION:

If you're entitled to money, that's not

a deprivation of property if it's withheld from you?
MR. COLLERAN:

Yes, I think it is. I think it would

be a deprivation, and assuming that there were some procedural
44

1

violations and there were allegations of negligence, then

2

that may well set forth a. Section 1983 action.
QUESTION:

Mr. Colleran, you say Mr. Parratt was

he was warden and responsible for the administration of the

institution, I take it?

8

MR. COLLERAN:

9

Concededly, he had nothing to do with the misdelivery

No, I think that there is more in­

volvement on the warden's part than that, Your Honor.

I think

10

that, as I noted earlier, he was charged with the responsi- i

1 1

bility of administering this procedure.

12

tering a procedure that was worse than no procedure at all.

13

He testified under oath in his answers to interrogatories tha1

14

he felt the institutional procedure was that anyone who hap­

pened to be around, in effect, to receipt for an inmate's

16

property, could do so.

17

in a position where he could not supervise those under his

18

control, he could not correct the incorrect application of

19

the institutional procedures, and he could not supervise the

45

1

Do you think you still could hold him liable for money

damages ?

3

MR. COLLERAN:

I think that if he made the institu­

4

tional procedures available to those charged with the direct

5

administration of this and saw to it that they got those

6

procedures, and perhaps instructed them that they should be

7

read and they should be thoroughly familiar with them, then

8

there would be a more tenuous connection with the warden in

in this case.

QUESTION:

How about the Governor of Nebraska who

appoints the warden?

12

MR. COLLERAN:

procedures.

I guess, in summing up,

I would say that -- and I recognize that this Court in Rizzo

has held that respondeat superior is not viable under Section

Doesn't the State have an obli­

MR. COLLERAN:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

I

think there's an important difference in simply property dis­

orders property through the United States mails in reliance

upon an institutional procedure, that he will be able to take

that property and pays for it and relies upon it, and then

finds when he gets out, the property has disappeared

MR. BROWN:

18

I made that argument because I know that

19

certain of the district court have employed that argument.

20

I felt it was

I don't have any personal belief in the strength of that

22

argument.

Court was obliged when granting summary judgment to review

all the pleadings on file and just ask the Court to review

Quite frankly,

With regard to any factual dispute, I would simply

And finally, I would like to say that with

regard to the question of negligence and whether simple

negligence itself forms a cause of action under 1983, that

I think the interest shown by amicus on behalf of the

5

petitioners here, along with petitioners themselves, indicates

6

a strong desire for some guidance from this Court on that

question.

us some sense of where we stand on that question.

And I would ask the Court if possible to provide

Finally, I think that if the penal systems of this

country are to improve, and I think we all desire that they

11

do, we'll need qualified, intelligent, and reasonable people

12

to run them.

potential for liability that actually no reasonable person

15

would want to work in that area.

Could the

State of Nebraska in its

17

Constitution, from Federal Constitution, just abolish its

18

hobby program totally?
MR. BROWN:

19

I would suspect this would be one of

20

the potentials.

21

whether or not we want to carry on that type of activity, if

22

in fact our administrators are going to be held personally

23

liable for the loss of this type of material, when --

24

25

We would have to evaluate administratively

QUESTION:
losses?

Are you indicating there are a lot of

Certainly, you wouldn't reevaluate because of a
53

1

$23 loss, would you?

2

MR. BROWN:

We wouldn't want to reevaluate, but

3

certainly it would have to play a part in our thinking with

4

regard to any material we allow to be introduced into the

5

institution that is not constitutionally mandated.

6

ply saying that would have to be weighed in our consideration.
QUESTION:

Would I be correct in assuming that

8

you've already done something to correct somebody from

9

stealing people's property?
MR. BROWN:

Well, we thought we had a system at

that time, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

13

That system has basically been con­

Well, my final question is, why didn't

14

you tell this man that he could get his remedy by the claims

MR. BROWN:

formed.

My understanding is that he was in­

I was not personally involved at that point in time.

18

QUESTION:

I see.

Okay, if you don't know.

19

QUESTION:

It's true there's $23.50 involved here,

20

but is it reasonable to assume that a good many thousands of

21

dollars have been expended in professional time, printing

22

costs, legal proceedings?

23

MR. BROWN:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's very reasonable to assume.
Could I ask you If you think the Court

of Appeals was given an adequate opportunity to consider
54

1

your suggestion that there was a procedure available to

2

have this property paid for?
MR. BROWN:

3

Mr. Colleran is right in the fact that

4

that issue was initially raised in our motion for rehearing,

5

but I think, as it relates to such a basic issue,'that they

6

did have an opportunity to consider it.

7

have any indication that they did.
QUESTION:

8

Certainly we don’t

But is there anything in the record to

9

indicate that this man was aware of the possibilities of this

10

procedure within the time limits that the procedure requires?
MR. BROWN:

11

Well, I would point out to the Court,

12

first of all -- well, let me answer -- with the exception of

13

the Exhibit B, which I referred to earlier, which may or may

14

not relate to the State claims now «- or to the State tort

15

diaims, whether it

16

know that that is distinguished, that’s the only -QUESTION:

17
18
19

relates to our small claims, and I don’t

That was only when the complaint was

filed?
MR. BROWN:

Right.

My understanding is that’s the

20

only thing in the record that would indicate his awareness

21

of the situation one way or the other.

22

the Court, however, that under Section 81A,227(2) of the

23

Nebraska Act, it also provides for a waiver of the statute of

24

limitations under the Claims Act, if in fact the claimant

25

has initially gone to an Improper forum.
55

I would point out to

Now that is couched

i

1

in terms of a state forum, but I think, as was pointed out

2

earlier, that they might take a lenient view of that, that

3

situation, in the case of a proceeding to --

QUESTION:

Does the record show what the conversa­

5

tion was when he found out his property was lost?

6

ever ask people to replace it or to pay for it?

7

MR. BROWN:

Did he

The record -- I will grant you, the

8

record in this case is very scanty.

9

understand it indicates that he contacted a Mr. Rybolt, who

The record as I would

10

is one of the three parties whose sworn material is before

11

the Court, who was the grievance officer, to look into the

12

matter, and that searches were made to see if the material

13

could be found.

14

QUESTION:

Otherwise, the State just shrugged its

15

shoulders?

16

gest that they would pay for it or replace it?

17

For prison people?

MR. BROWN:

They didn't purport to sug­

There simply is no showing on this

18

record as to what happened, and I question the propriety of

19

really informing you beyond that because, first of all, I was

20

not personally involved in it.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. BROWN:

Yes; all right.

Thank you.

And I think we ought to stick to what

23

is on

24

question of where the burden falls as to -- inform.

25

Apparently, from the record, Mr. Taylor was aware that some

But again, it seems to me, you have the

the record is not very elaborate.
