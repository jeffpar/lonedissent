MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN J. O'NEILL, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. O'NEILL:

8

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is, has the practice of the

1 1

Connecticut Board of Pardons in granting relief to inmates

12

serving what we call straight life sentences in Connecticut

13

-- that is, sentences with no court-imposed minimum term --

14

and relief to the extent that the minimum term set by statute

15

is reduced, thereby accelerating the inmates' eligibility to

16

appear before the Connecticut Board of Parole, giving inmates

17

serving such sentences a due process right to the extent that

18

the Board of Pardons must give written explanations of ad­

19

verse decisions when they deny such relief.

20

This is the second occasion upon which we have come

21

to this Court, the parties in this case have come to this

22

Court on the issue of what, if any, kind of a written state­

23

ment is required

24

relief to a so-called lifer in

when

the

of

Pardons denies pardon

Connecticut.

The first occasion followed a decision in January
3

1

of 1979 by a panel of the 2nd Circuit which analogized pardons;

2

to parole, and held

3

reasons for denial of parole are part of the due process re­

15

order of the 2nd Circuit but there was no oral argument.

16

Although concluding that the applicable Connecticut statute,

17

Section 18-26 of the Connecticut General Statutes, offered

18

only the mere hope of pardon, that it does not create a legi­

19

timate expectation of freedom, and hence does not implicate

20

due process -- and in this regard the panel concluded that

21

Section 18-26 contains neither a presumption in favor of

22

pardon nor a list of factors to be considered by the Board of

23

Pardons, and in fact that the statute gave the Board unfet­

24

tered discretion.

25

In June of 1979 this Court

The same panel of the 2nd Circuit, the same
Parties briefed it.by

Diespite these conclusions, the court upon

4

1

reconsideration, affirmed its earlier conclusion, as the

2

consistent issuance of pardons to inmates serving so-called

3

straight life sentences in Connecticut has given inmates serv­

4

ing such sentences a protected liberty interest in the

5

pardons process.
QUESTION:

6

When you say, "consistent issuance

7

of pardons," Mr. O'Neill, the testimony was, what, 75, 85,

8

90 percent?

9

It was not straight across the board?

MR. O'NEILL:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. O'NEILL:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. O'NEILL:

That's correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

What was the average time, Mr. O'Neill?
The average time?

Of service?
The testimony on average time came from

14

the same witness who testified.on the percentage of pardons, Mr

15

Gates, who was then Chairman of the Connecticut Board of

16

Parole.

17

His testimony was somewhere between 14 and 17 years.
QUESTION:

For about 75 percent, is it, of those

18

sentenced under these sentences?

19

MR. O'NEILL:

I think the fairest statement of the

20

testimony is that it's somewhat more than 7 5 percent ,■ I think

21

is

the fairest --

QUESTION:

In that sense, there was a pattern,

was there?

In that sense --

And that was

MR. O'NEILL:

Well, following the -- Mr. Gates is

a very knowledgeable man and he has been around in the cor­

10

rections area in Connecticut for decades — following the

1 1

decision of the 2nd Circuit and before this Court granted

12

certiorari, we did embark upon a process of reviewing the

13

minutes of the Board's meetings for the past five or six

14

years, I believe, to see if we could put together some kind

15

of a pattern, but we really didn't get all that deeply into

16

it when this Court granted certiorari, and we stopped.

17

One thing that interested me in that search is that I don't

18

know that all inmates serving life sentences apply for

19

pardons .

20

but I wonder if All inmates serving life sentences’ do in fact

23

We get frequent applications from -the same inmate,

Following the ordering of the filing of the records,

as the Court has indicated, the 2nd Circuit remanded to the

25

district court to determine how many years a lifer must serve

before the probability of a pardon becomes so significant as

2

to give rise to a protected liberty interest.

3

or conclusion of the 2nd Circuit that the consistent issuance

of pardons -- again, from the facts in the record, somewhere

around 75 percent -- and it's also referred to as the

In Board of Regents v. Roth, relied upon by the
majority of this Court in Greenholtz, this Court held In

10

part that the Fourteenth Amendment's procedural protection of

1 1

property is the safeguard of the security of interest that a

12

person has already acquired in specific benefits.

13

It further held that to have a property interest in

14

a benefit a person clearly must have more than an abstract

15

need or desire for it, he must have more than a unilateral

16

expectation of it, he must instead have a legitimate claim of

17

entitlement to it.

18

tion of property to protect those claims upon which people

19

rely in their daily lives, reliance that must not be arbi­

20

trarily undermined.

21

It is a purpose of the ancient institu­

In the Leis case, Leis v. Flynt, this Court further

22

held that a claim of entitlement under state law to be

23

enforceable must be derived from statute or legal rule or

24

through a mutually explicit understanding.

25

no statute, legal rule, for a mutually explicit understanding

such that lifers in Connecticut have a protected or a legiti­

In Roth itself there was at least a suggestion that

4

most of the teachers hired on a yearly basis were in fact

5

rehired, and yet that suggestion was not deemed significant

6

enough to give the teacher a

thus invoking due process.

8

the dissenting opinions, there was detailed reference to

9

parole statistics around the country which showed, in part:

10

that the history of New York was that 7 5 percent of persons

11

eligible for parole were in fact paroled, and that the figure

12

went as high as 92 percent in other states around the country;

13

that the figures nationally show that some 70 percent of

14

inmates released to the community were in fact released to

15

the community via the parole process.

16

of this Court held that there was no legitimate claim of

17

entitlement.

18

legitimate claim of entitlement,
Indeed, in Greenholtz itself, in

And yet, the majority

Indeed, even other panels of the 2nd Circuit have

19

in Pugliese and Boothe acknowledged that high percentages of

20

parole releases do not give somebody a legitimate claim of

21

entitlement.

22

this issue, at least in the 2nd Circuit.

23

I seem to be the only attorney who has lost

In short, even if the Connecticut Board of Pardons

24

may be generous in the exercise of its authorities, its

25

record such as it appears can hardly be interpreted as
8

1

conveying the message to an inmate serving a life sentence

2

that he has something that he can rely on, that he has some­

3

thing that will not be taken away from him unless he does

4

something about it, or unless certain conditions can be estab­

5

lished, which are the grounds upon which such a legitimate

6

claim of entitlement must be premised.

7

Further, in Schick v. Reed, this Court dealt with

8

the authority of the United States Constitution of the

9

President to grant pardons.

In Schick the Court characterizec

13

the sentence which conditions which -- which themselves are

14

constitutionally unobjectionable.

and held that the President's pardoning power was

15

Since the pardoning process is plenary, it would

16

seem to be conditioned only upon constitutionally unobjec­

17

tionable reasons.

18

pardon, similarly, is plenary, provided pardons are not

19

denied, or pardon relief is not denied for constitutionally

20

impermissible reasons.

MR. O'NEILL:

QUESTION:

What is this Board?

How is it appointed,

and how many members does it have?
MR. O'NEILL:

It has five members, one of whom by

10

statute must be a Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court.

11

They are appointed by the Governor with the approval of one

of the branches of the Connecticut Legislature.

There is a turnover.

MR. O'NEILL:

Each governor could conceivably have

The reason is that they in effect

Something like our practice of not

giving reasons for why we deny certiorari?
MR.

O'NEILL:

We don't claim to be a court or to

8

have judicial powers, but it is along those lines, Your

9

Honor; yes.

And as indicated in the majority opinion in

10

Greenholtz, that these are motions and considerations and

1 1

decisions which don't readily lend themselves to a statement

12

of reasons.

13
14

15

QUESTION:

Is there a statute that says that they

don't have to give the reasons?
MR.

O'NEILL:

The statute says nothing on it.

As

16

a matter of fact, the 2nd Circuit said the statute gives them

17

unfettered discretion.

QUESTION:

MR.

I still want to know what the reason is

why you couldn't give a reason?

There is no reason, right?

And I'm

11

asking you, finally, for the last time, a reason for not

MR. O'NEILL:

The reason would simply be to the

14

inmate, you haven't shown us why we should extend that act of

clemency.

That is the reason, that is the

thought process that the Board goes through.

MR. O'NEILL:

would be no problem in giving a reason?
Well, he's testified that administra­

tively, if one devised a form with four or five patented

answers, it would be no great problem to check two or three

2

boxes on that printed form, but I think he also testified

3

that in his mind that wouldn't tell the inmate much of any­

Mr. O'Neill, I gather that in a fairly

large number of cases the Board does act favorably to the
request for shortening the sentence?

MR. O'NEILL:

12

QUESTION:

13

In reducing the minimum term.

Yes.

And when it does that, does it give

a statement of reasons?

14

MR. O'NEILL:

15

QUESTION:

No, it does not.

It just acts without explanation, either

16

granting or -- well what -- and there's an issue in this

case, or at least there's a question in the case as to -- if

18

there is some kind of a liberty interest at some point in

QUESTION:

Mr.

O'Neill, do you think the President

in the case like Schick v. Reed could be required to give a

statement of his reasons for denying or granting a pardon?

10

MR. O'NEILL:

1 1

QUESTION:

Or any governor, where there is still

12

executive clemency?

Incidentally, do you have any vestige

13

MR. O'NEILL:

No, I do not, Your Honor.

Not, really.

I believe there is some

authority in the Governor of the State of Connecticut to

16

grant temporary reprieves in capital cases, but nothing along

Is there any

MR. O'NEILL:

There are a multitude of attitudes

and philosophies and guidelines and goals that the individual

members of the Board use, some of which are really hard to

define, as this Court, as a majority of this Court noted in

Greenholtz.

QUESTION:

These are all cases in which the Legis­

lature has provided a mandatory minimum sentence and in 75

MR. O'NEILL:

How do cases get before the Board?
The inmate must apply.

How does he know that?
I believe it's in the record ,• Your

16

Honor.

I know the only -- it's in the record that the only

17

requirement is that he must serve a year of his sentence

18

before he can apply.
QUESTION:

19

After that he can apply -But how does he even know he can apply?

20

Has the Board issued any rules about how you're supposed to

21

proceed?

22

MR. O'NEILL:

Yes, there are rules.

They're not in

23

the record, but it is well known to the inmates at Somers.

24

The Board sits there four or five times a year, and it's

25

well known.
20

Well, does the Board -- has the Board

MR. O'NEILL:

MR. O'NEILL:

A form is provided. Whether it's the

15

16

Corrections.

QUESTION:

Yes, and do they -- and the form says,

18

please give reasons why, or does it say, does it ask some

19

specific questions that it wants answers to?

20

MR. O'NEILL:

I'm looking for a form now.

It pro­

21

vides for the name of the inmate, his age, where he was born,

22

what his crime was, where he was convicted and sentenced,

23

has he earned commutation of credit on his sentence, number

24

of times he has applied for the sentence, and concludes by

25

saying that he claims consideration, because.
21

And then, on

1

this form, there is

2

QUESTION:

3

So, it doesn't indicate at all any of

the reasons that might be relevant to the Board?

4

MR. O'NEILL:

No, but it gives the inmate a large

box to state why the Board should give him some relief.

And again, that is the way the Board looks at it.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

Very well.

MR. SIZNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The issue in this case is whether the Court of

for a few life inmates in Connecticut.

of inmates which at the time this action was brought in

And the reason that I

QUESTION:

Well, the real question in this case is

24

whether or not the Constitution requires the Board to give

25

reasons for its failure to grant a pardon.
22

1

MR. WIZNER:

That's right, Justice Stewart.

And

2

the answer to this question must be found in the practices of

3

the Connecticut Board of Pardons because the Connecticut

4

statute does not contain the "shall - unless"

5

the Nebraska statute, which was at issue in Greenholtz.

6

language

of

So the real issue, I think, is whether or not in

7

the absence of a statute which contains such "shall - unless"

8

language a state board may by consistent practice over an

9

extended period of time establish a practice rooted in the

10

implementation of a state statute which creates an entitle­

11

ment .

12

QUESTION:

Didn't the Greenholtz opinion for the

13

Court emphasize the key to it was the language of the Nebraska

14

statute?

15

MR. WIZNER:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WIZNER:

Yes,

it did, Your Honor.

What's that got to do with its practice?
Mr.

Chief Justice, if I may respond

18

to that, this Court as you well know,

19

that in that case the Nebraska statute by its terms created

20

an entitlement.

21

sary in future cases, the Court said, will have to be decided

22

on a case-by-case basis.

23

in Greenholtz stated

Whether or not such language would be neces­

The 2nd Circuit, the circuit from which we come

24

with this case, has already had occasion,

25

to consider Greenholtz, and has held that in the absence of

23

several occasions,

1

any other evidence, if you have a purely discretionary statute:

2

such as the one we have here, no entitlement is created and

3

no legitimate claim of entitlement is created.

4

is that the Connecticut Board of Pardons has structured the

But if after this decision they started

wholly different, I take it.

20

MR. WIZNER:

It would be and we think they can do

21

that.

22

at least 75 and perhaps 90 percent of inmates, permitting them

23

to apply every year, the testimony from the Pardon Board

We think that as long as they are granting relief to

reliable factfinding will take place, a procedure which we

3

don't claim entitlement to, incidentally.

4

QUESTION:

Well, on the basis of that argument,

5

could not an equally plausible argument be made that since

6

you're granting 70 percent in the past, you must grant 70

7

percent this year?

MR. WIZNER:

8
9

I want in on that 70 percent.
No, Your Honor.

And that is not our

claim in this Court and was not our claim below.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. WIZNER:

But isn't it equally plausible?
With all respect, Your Honor, I think

12

it is not equally plausible.

13

is that when relief is granted this consistently, it impli­

14

cates a liberty interest and creates a legitimate claim of

15

entitlement, a claim of entitlement to have applications for

16

sentence reduction on the part of these inmates fairly con­

17

sidered.

18

painted itself into a corner as Justice Rehnquist suggests

19

and obligated itself to grant pardons to life inmates into

20

the future.

given to them during the first 13 years of their sentence.

At the point where they reached 20 years, the five years of

By reducing the lifer sentence to 20 years at some

of those five years.

That automatically reduces him to 15

years.

So that Mr. Gates's testimony of somewhere between

1 1

14 and 17 years has quite a rational basis.

12

Board is doing in these cases is saying that lifers should

13

have the benefit, as a rule, of good time just as all other

14

inmates do, and the reason that they're doing it is so that

15

lifers won't feel totally frustrated that they have no oppor­

16

tunity for ever getting released.

MR. WIZNER:

That's not the only offense, and

say that for this reason you must get more than you get out

23

MR. WIZNER:

The reason why you must get more is,

24

first of all, when the appellate court is reviewing a deci­

25

sion of the trial court, it is deciding several things, but
38

1

above all it is looking at a conviction fora crime in a crimi­

I am not here asking for the release

MR. WIZNER:

You tell me why it isn't.
I will tell you why it isn't.

5

I wouldn't be here today if the Connecticut Board of Pardons

were not granting relief to almost 90 percent of the members

7

of the class I represent.

QUESTION: Well, then, is not the petition, doesn't

it function as a direction to the Board, on your submission,

10

that you must give me a reason why you do not release me,

1 1

or else release me?
MR. WIZNER:

12

That's what you're asking for.
I'm not seeking release.

I'm assuming

13

that the Board of Pardons has a reason for not releasing my

14

clients.

15

in that sense it's like an order to show cause.

16

that 90 percent of my clients are getting it, ten percent

17

are not getting it.

18

show us why it is that they're not getting it.

19

a reason which explains why they haven't gotten it and it's

not based on constitutionally impermissible grounds.

MR. WIZNER:

No, it doesn't.
And why not?
It doesn't, Justice Stevens, although

assuming it would favor a rule which required trial judges
44

to give statements of reasons for sentences, the Legislature

in the case of sentencing has created outer bounds for sen­

tencing .

4

QUESTION:

That's right.

Here we’ve got outer

bounds too.
MR. WIZNER:

And here we have outer bounds too,

7

but we have an agency which has limited its own bounds, it has

8

structured the exercise of its discretion by acting in a

9

certain way over and over and over again.

10

QUESTION:

Trial judges do this too.

Some judges

11

give certain sentences in certain kinds of crimes, but they

12

just don't bother to say so.

argument wrong, but is there really a principal distinction

15

between what you're asking us to hold for this part of the

part of the sentencing process

Supposing, following up on Justice

Stevens' question, that a particular judge has a reputation

for being very severe on narcotics cases and generally sen­

tences to the maximum authorized by law in those cases, say

12

in 90 percent of the cases that come before him, but in ten

percent he doesn't.

14

that ten percent has a right to go to some court and claim,

judge as to why he of the ten percent was singled out, whereas

18

90 percent were not?

19

MR. WIZNER:

Now, do you think that one, a member of

There might well be such a reason in

20

that case and the analogy I think of, Justice Rehnquist, is

21

the draft evasion cases where appellate courts held that

22

where judges automatically sentenced draft evaders to the

23

five-year maximum sentence under the statute, the cases had

24

to be remanded to the trial courts so that the trial judge

25

would exercise discretion in determining what sentence should
46

1

be applied to the particular offender.

2

QUESTION:

Did this Court ever hold that?

3

MR. WIZNER:

Not to my knowledge, Your Honor. It's a

4

good rationale, though, I think, and one that I would urge

5

upon the Court.

6

matically without considering the individual characteristics

7

of offenders were to impose the maximum sentence for a partic­

8

ular crime, I would think that that kind of practice should

9

be subject to appellate review.

If the trial judge consistently and syste­

I would think that, perhaps

10

tion of the sentence.

13

QUESTION:

But how would you know that discretion

14

was being exercised unless you had a statement of reasons?

15

Just a remand, and then the judge simply imposes the same

16

sentence again without saying anything more?

17

MR. WIZNER:

I think a sentencing judge who is

by a panel of three judges.

That is correct.

MR. WIZNER:

Well, that's what I wanted to know.
That's another reason why the Pardon

my clients, but certainly they could do that.

4

QUESTION:

No, no.

5

QUESTION:

You're not asking for a hearing, as I

6

understand it?

7

MR. WIZNER:

8

QUESTION:

9

10
1 1

You're not.

We are not.
If the Court should create a liberty

interest, would it not follow that these inmates would be
entitled to a hearing as well as a statement of reasons?
MR. WIZNER:

I hesitate to argue against myself,

12

but I do not think so, Justice Powell.

I think the process

13

that's due in this situation is a statement of reasons.

14

I don't think that, in view of the very broad discretion that

15

the Legislature has given the Pardon Board and the fact that

16

it is in effect commuting sentences validly imposed, that a

17

full hearing is not necessary.

18

Board of Pardons now does give a full hearing with a right

19

to counsel, with a right to produce witnesses, with a right

20

to examine the prison file, and they even invite the State's

21

Attorney from the county in which the individual defendant

22

has been convicted to come and state his view.

23

one of the grounds why pardon, sentence commutation applica­

24

tions are denied, is when a State's Attorney vehemently

25

opposes it because of communications he might have received

However, the Connecticut

52

And indeed

1

from the victim's family or for other reasons.
QUESTION:

2

I understand that the liberty interest

3

you are asserting in this case would not even require that

4

the Board hold a meeting.
MR. WIZNER:

5

Is that correct?

I think that's true, except that --

6

I hesitate to say that it's true, again because of the

7

consistency with which relief has been granted.

8

a situation as we do here where more than three-quarters and

9

perhaps as many as 90 percent of a particular small defined

If you have

10

class of inmates are getting relief, then it may be that they

11

have to have something more than just some superficial state­

12

ment of reasons when they are singled out for denial of that

13

relief.

14

That is not the system we have now.

The system we

15

have now is that the Connecticut Board of Pardons grants

16

these kinds of hearings to anybody who applies to it, so I

17

have to assume that I'm operating within a system in which

18

anybody after he's served one year of a sentence may apply

19

for a sentence commutation and that the Board as a matter of

20

practice, deeply rooted practice over a period of some three

21

decades, has singled out one class of inmates to give a

22

very high level of relief to.

23

QUESTION:

Isn't it true your 90 percent figure :

24

is a. little'bit misleading because in any set of applicants

25

in one day, 90 percent of those don't’ get relief on that day?
53

MR. WIZNER:

1

That's right.

Our -- I want to be

2

very clear about what I'm saying about that, Justice Stevens.

3

Of persons convicted of murder or related crimes and serving

4

life sentences under a statute that was repealed in 1971,

5

sometime during the first 20 years of their life sentence

6

75 to 90 percent of them will have their sentences reduced

7

by the Connecticut Board of Pardons, and that's all that I'm

8

saying.
