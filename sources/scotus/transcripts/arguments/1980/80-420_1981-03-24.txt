ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERALD PRICE FAHRINGER, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

MR. FAHRINGER:

7

8

We'll hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please

the Court:

9

This case is here on certiorari to the Supreme

10

Court of Ohio.

1 1

case which is of constitutional dimension and,‘I believe, one

12

of first impression, is bound to carry implications and give

13

directions far beyond the boundaries of this case.

14

simple question, as I view it, is this:

15

in a criminal case makes out a prima facie case of selective

16

prosecution, is it sufficient for the prosecutor to simply

17

deny those allegations and suggest or intimate that this was

18

a test case?

19

The resolution, the question, posed by this

MR.

FAHRINGER:

Why is this a final judg­

Well, Your Honor,

I believe under

4

that Section -- and I'm not sure if it is a final judgment or

5

decree, but under that Section you've invoked your power in

6

First Amendment cases, which this is, as the Government

7

acknowledges in their brief, on a number of occasions because

8

of the importance of the issue.

of those cases.

We have the power to interpret the statutory language.
MR.

FAHRINGER:

Your Honor, I just am of the view

that, as the cases relied upon in the amicus brief where

4

1

they indicate you have

done this before, where there has not

2

been a final judgment,

is -- we are a good candidate for that

3

type of disposition.

The facts to

be introduced to the Court in a rather

5

summary fashion -- I know you are aware of them, but I'd

6

like to just simply highlight.

8

Hustler Magazine was the only magazine prosecuted, although

9

there were many other magazines similar to it, comparable to

In the hearing conducted in

10

it, and in one point, the prosecution even conceded more

1 1

explicit than Hustler.

12

We also established that at least, at the very

13

least, the investigation was launched because of a political

14

cartoon which disparaged the President of the United States

15

and a member of his Cabinet and Governor Rockefeller.

16

the very most, the prosecutor conceded during the hearing

17

that it was one of the reasons why the prosecution was ini­

18

tiated, even though he said later on that upon examination

19

of the magazine --

20

QUESTION:

And at

On the practical side of things,

21

Mr. Fahringer, what does a prosecutor do when he's going to

22

test a statute?

23

or the strongest, the strongest defendant or the most vul­

24

nerable defendant?

25

Does he pick out the weakest case in sight

MR. FAHRINGER:

Absolutely not.

He would pick the

strongest, Your Honor.

What did the highest court of the state

say about this issue?
MR. FAHRINGER:

8

Well, Your Honor, they said -- and

9

this brings us to a very important issue in this case -- they

10

said we did not make out a prima facie case and that we had --

11

QUESTION:

Are we not bound by that?

12

MR. FAHRINGER:

I don't believe you are, Your

13

Honor.

14

seem to me, and we urge it in the second branch of our brief,

15

that you are bound by the trial judge's findings.

16

law is well established that great weight is given to his

17

findings.

If we were bound by anything in this case, it would

You mean the trial court prevails over

the highest court of the state?
MR. FAHRINGER:

Well, Your Honor, I believe the

21

judge who hears the witnesses, observes the witnesses, has

22

been in the past, been given great deference on fact-finding

23

issues, and all I'm suggesting to Your Honor is that in this

24

case where he heard the witnesses testify and was present and

was able to observe their demeanor, he is in a better positior.

I believe you have the power to go to the trial

Well, but the very fact that he was in

dissent means that the majority didn't agree with him.
MR. FAHRINGER:

13

No question about it, Your Honor.

14

What I'm impressed by with Judge Brown is the authorities

15

that he assembled in his dissent from the highest court of

16

Ohio indicating that we have traditionally in this state on

17

matters of credibility given weight to the trial judge's

18

disposition because of his unique position to make that

judgment.

20

this case, you know, has to go off on.that issue. It seems to

me that we clearly made out a prima facie case here no matter

What is your federal constitutional

claim?
MR. FAHRINGER:

Our federal constitutional claim

4

is we've been denied equal protection here under the Four­

5

teenth Amendment, because we were singled out --

6

QUESTION:

It isn't a matter of due process?

7

MR. FAHRINGER:

Well, I think it is in terms of the

a

burden of proof it's

9

I think the two rights coincide.

a

matter of due process, Your Honor.
Our substantive right is

10

one of equal protection.

11

or not when the Supreme Court of Ohio says, after having made

12

out the case we did in the lower court, that we were obliged

13

to bring forward the officials to show that they were or

14

were not going to prosecute the other magazines.

15

QUESTION:

Our due process claim is whether

Do you have some equal protection cases

16

where we've in the name of making a constitutional judgment

17

made our own judgment of the•historical'facts?

18

MR. FAHRINGER:

Well, Your Honor, what I think we

19

have here is, we have a long line of cases from this Court

20

where you have given great weight to the findings --

21

22
23

QUESTION:

Of district courts, maybe, but this

comes from a state court, as Justice Rehnquist says.
MR. FAHRINGER:

Well, Your Honor, forgive me, but

24

I don't believe there should be any difference in this Court

25

in judging the

factfinding process of a district court or of
8

1

a state trial court.
QUESTION:

2

Well, but, Congress may have suggested

3

that there should be.

All we can review in the state court

4

proceedings is questions of violations of federal or consti­

5

tutional rights.
MR. FAHRINGER:

6

Well, Your Honor, let me just say

7

this.

8

is that the wrong rule was applied here and I'd like to

9

address that.

10

Depending on your disposition on that issue, my view

It seems to me that when you have a case of this

11

kind where a monopoly of the evidence exists with the

12

Government, as in the prosecutorial vindictiveness cases and

13

in the exclusion of cognizable minority groups from juries,

14

this Court has said, dealing both with state cases and with

15

federal cases, that a different rule has to be applied.

16

Obviously in these cases the defendant is placed at a dis­

17

tinct disadvantage in terms of trying to -- we never had any

18

expectation for one moment in this case that my cross-examina­

19

tion would cause Mr. Taylor to break down and say, yes, yes,

20

I did it, this was the selected prosecution.

21

that has come to this Court or has come to the circuit courts

22

under selected prosecution, it is understandable that the

23

prosecutor who bears the responsibility for this act has taker,

24

a defensive posture and has explained away the reason if -- it

25

seems to me, if this case were to survive, every single
9

In every case

1

selected prosecution case in the country could be defeated

2

by the prosecutor saying, we decided this was a test case.
QUESTION:

3
4

Is it possible to have a test case that's

not selective?
MR. FAHRINGER:

5

Of course, Your Honor.

Of course.

6

As a matter of fact, I welcome that question.

In Atlanta,

7

Georgia, in the cases cited in the prosecutor's brief, where

8

they did exactly the same thing, they made a judgment in

9

Atlanta, Georgia -- this case reached the 5th Circuit -- they

10

made it a judgment that they were going to proceed against

1 1

the so-called sophisticated men's magazines, to put it as

12

gracefully as I can, and there they went after five or six.

13

And many of those, Your Honor, were out-of-state. As a

14

matter of fact, they were all out-of-state there and they

15

used their extradition powers to bring all of those publishers

16

into the state and they prosecuted Penthouse, they prosecuted

17

Hustler, they prosecuted Playboy, they prosecuted Club magazine

18

and a number of others.

19

QUESTION:

I said, my question was, where you have

20

a one single, a test case, isn't that obviously a selective

21

case?

22
23

MR. FAHRINGER:

Absolutely.

There's no question

about it, Your Honor.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. FAHRINGER:

What's wrong with it?
Well, what is wrong with it is,
10

1

here, Your Honor, I think it is inherently suspect.

2

look at the facts.

3

ledges that he stated on public television, that this case is

4

being prosecuted because of the political cartoon.

5

that the initial investigation was launched by the cartoon

6

because of the complaints that were made against it.

7

Let's

They acknowledge, the prosecutor acknow­

We know

Now, it seems to me more than coincidental at that

8

point, after Hustler has been in that community for two years

9

they had 550 obscenity prosecutions, not one has ever in­

10

volved a sophisticated men's magazine, and all of a sudden,

1 1

coincidentally with that, they made a judgment that we are

12
13

going to proceed against Hustler on obscenity grounds.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that by putting one

14

political cartoon in an otherwise pornographic publication,

15

the publisher insulates himself from prosecution under the

16

First Amendment?

17

MR. FAHRINGER:

18

QUESTION:

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

Then what's the significance of the

political cartoon that you mentioned?
MR. FAHRINGER:

Because that's what inspired the

prosecution, Your Honor, I say in all deference to the Court.
QUESTION:

Did the highest court of Ohio say some­

thing about that?
MR. FAHRINGER:

No, Your Honor, what the highest

court of Ohio said was this:

it is conceded that Hustler
11

1

was selected so under the
QUESTION:

2

Of course, as Justice Marshall just sug­

3

gested, the prosecutor always selects, and you have conceded

4

that if he knows his business he's going to select the

5

strongest case for the prosecution and the most vulnerable

6

defendant.

Is that not -- ?
MR. FAHRINGER:

7

Your Honor, I welcome that question

8

because I think that goes to the very heart of the issue here

9

and let me deal with it.

It seems to me under the well-

10

established law we have to satisfy two branches of the test

11

that has been fixed by this Court and other courts.

12

that we've been singled out.

13

14

other magazines.

Now, the hard part of the case is, did they

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. FAHRINGER:

19

QUESTION:

We have prima

What's the impermissible reason here?
The cartoon.

Then we come back to the proposition that

20

by printing one political cartoon the publisher's going to

21

be insulated from prosecution.

22

MR. FAHRINGER:

No, no, Your Honor, I'm not sug­

23

gesting that and let me try to make myself clear to you.

24

I'm not saying that the magazine can be salvaged on obscenity

25

grounds, because of that cartoon.
12

What I'm saying is, where

1

it is clear from the evidence that at least the investigation

2

was initiated by that cartoon, this Court has to take a hard

3

look at a retraction of that and at the hearing when obviously

4

you have an issue now, in an adversary forum, where the

5

prosecutor comes in and says, well, that really wasn't our

6

reason, but we decided to make a test case of this.
The other thing I would urge upon this Court is,

7

8

otherwise it seems to me the doctrine of selective prosecu­

9

tion will become a myth.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Fahringer, what in your opinion, if

1 1

you had to pick one case from this Court on the question of

12

selective prosecution, is the closest one that supports you?
MR. FAHRINGER:

13
14

that question by saying that the rule that I would like to -QUESTION:

15
16

No, I'm not asking you to -- I've asked

you for the case.
MR. FAHRINGER:

17
18

Your Honor, I would like to answer

I'm sorry.

I was going to do that.

I think the Falk case out of the 7th Circuit.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. FAHRINGER:

From this Court, I asked.
Judge, there is no case directly in point

21

in this Court-.

What you have done is, in’this Court, under Yick Wo,

22

Oyler, and Two Guys, you have established the substantive

23

rules.

24

saying is that you have never addressed "what I consider to be the

25

primary issue, the procedure, the implementing of the rule.

And I didn't mean to evade your question.

13

What I'm

After you announced the rule in exclusion of cognize

1

2

ble groups from minorities, you had a substantive principle.

3

In Castaneda you then had to decide how you were going to

4

implicate this, because what had happened is, jury commis­

5

sioners were coming into courts and saying, we never had any

6

intent to exclude Mexicans or blacks, and yet, in what I

7

consider to be a critically important footnote in Castaneda,

8

Footnote No. 19, the Court said, and the language is important

9

enough that I'd just recite it to you, it's very short.

10

What you said is, "This is not to say, of course, that a sim­

11

ple protestation from a commissioner that, racial considera­

12

tions played no part in the selection would be enough.

13

kind of testimony has been found insufficient in several

14

cases.

15

tion that officials discharge their sworn duties to rebut

16

the case of discrimination."

17

stance, plaintiffs who have shown a discrimination against a

18

cognizable minority group.

19

like the prosecutor does here and says, we never intended

20

that, and that it's not our purpose to discriminate against

21

Mexicans.

22

circumstances of those cases, we are going to require a

23

heavier burden of proof and they will have to produce more.

Do you think the prosecutor was preju­

MR. FAHRINGER:

QUESTION:

6

Beg your pardon?

Do you consider the prosecutor as being

prejudiced against your client?
MR. FAHRINGER:

I can't say that in good conscience,

7

Your Honor, but what I can --

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, what's the whole argument?

All

the argument you're saying is where they're prejudiced against

10

a group of people.

This prosecutor was prejudiced against

1 1

a group of people or an individual.

12

MR. FARHINGER:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. FAHRINGER:

Well, Your Honor, I think --

Is he?
Well, to the extent that he was

15

very much offended by the cartoon, yes, he would be prejudicec

16

against my client.

I have no --

Well, if so, which section of the Consti­

tution protects it? .
MR. FAHRINGER:

Well, what protects us is, Your

Honor, the First Amendment, in terms of the -QUESTION:

You said you were relying on the Four­

teenth Amendment.
MR. FAHRINGER:

Well, I am, Your Honor, but what
15

1

you have is, it seems to me, is a coalescence of the Four­

2

teenth Amendment on equal protection but the impermissible

3

basis for prosecuting us is the First Amendment.
QUESTION:

4

We --

Won't that be a matter of the merits of

5

the trial?

You'll have a defense under the First and Four­

6

teenth Amendments on the merits at the trial, of the prose­

7

cution.

8

isn't:-- in a system of adversary criminal justice such as we

9

have, entrusting so much unreviewable and uncontrollable dis­

And then, since I've already interrupted you, why

10

cretion to a prosecutor, why isn't, as the Chief Justice and

11

my brother Marshall have suggested -- '.why isn't any prosecu­

12

tion a selective prosecution?

13

MR. FAHRINGER:

14

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, I --

And I must say this, the great discre­

15

tion, unreviewable and uncontrollable, that we confide in

16

prosecutors under our system shocks our brothers in conti­

17

nental Europe, for example.
MR. FAHRINGER:

18

We do it.

Well, Your Honor, I could only

19

answer that by saying that then, what you're really saying is

20

that the doctrine of selective prosecution should be abol­

21

ished .

22

QUESTION:

No, no.

Yick Wo was something -- Yick Wc

23

involved a statute or an ordinance in San Francisco, I guess

24

it was, that on its face applied to all laundries but in

25

practical fact it applied only to Chinese laundries.
16

MR. FAHRINGER:

2

QUESTION:

3

Yes, that's right.

And that's not this kind of a case, is

it?
MR. FAHRINGER:

4

No, but, Your Honor, if I may, if

5

it please you, we have growing up beneath you in the circuit

6

courts Falk, you know; Steele, where they went after draft

7

protesters.

8

tors came in and said, look, we're making a test case of this,

they said, but you've picked a man here because he was very

here in this very city where they occupied the halls of

Congress and they had never prosecuted anybody that had

were critical of the Administration, you said that this was

In the Crowthers case

We didn't say it.
I'm sorry.

I beg your pardon.

19

I didn't mean to suggest you did but I would hope you would

20

have.

QUESTION:

What about

the

22

familiar with that, Mr. Fahringer?

23

MR. FAHRINGER:

QUESTION:

Rico

Statute?

Are you

Yes.

Supposing the Government seeing the

statute passed for the first time and charged with the duty
17

1

to enforce it picks out the biggest group of mobsters that

2

it can in the country and goes after them rather than a group

3

of smaller mobsters, would you say that was a selective

4

prosecution?

5

MR. FAHRINGER:

Well, Your Honor, it would be

6

selective but it might be justifiable.

In other words, they

7

may not have used an impermissible standard.

8

gesting in this case, and I wanted to reach this with the

9

Court because I think it's terribly important, you understand

What I'm sug­

10

that what we are faced here in this case, which I think pre­

1 1

sents a terrible threat to the whole doctrine of selective

12

prosecution, is a situation without one single bit of corro­

13

borative evidence, without any criteria at all, without any

14

suggestion that we had a meeting and we decided to go against

15

Hustler without any proof

16

and then we made a decision that Hustler was the worst maga­

17

zine, without a memorandum, without a report or anything.

18

After this claim is brought, and after Hustler is the only

19

magazine, a prosecutor simply takes the stand -- and I hope

20

my comments don't lack diplomacy, but I would be a coward if

21

I didn't say this -- a prosecutor takes the stand and simply

22

says, well -- he never, incidentally, never in the hearing

23

has he uttered the word, test case.

24

considering maybe going after the other magazines once the

25

Hustler prosecution was concluded.

that we collected other magazines

18

What he says is, we were

Now, you may find that

1

2

that implies he's talking about a test case.
But I come back to this issue and I challenge my

3

brothers to answer this.

4

of this case right now, would you all agree with me that

5

any selective prosecution claim could be defeated, could

6

be defeated by simply the prosecutor taking the stand and

7

saying, this is a test case?

If this were the law in the context

You mean, right this minute?

Yes, sir.
I would think that would --

Would that solve the problem?
I do not believe it would solve

the problem, Your Honor, but I think it would --

Would that end your case?

MR. FARHINGER:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

Why not?

MR. FAHRINGER:

Your Honor, I think that would add

greatly to their case load.
QUESTION:

So there's nothing that the Government

can do now but turn your man loose.
MR. FAHRINGER:

Your Honor, I think the posture

12

we're in here is that the facts are fairly well fixed.

13

I think our concern always is what they do in retrospect can

14

be interpreted in terms of simply trying to defeat the claim

15

but, Your Honor, I would be the first to admit to you and

16

acknowledge that if right after the Flynt prosecution they

17

had gone out, even after the claim had been brought to their

18

attention, and charged five or six other men's magazines, it

19

would well be that we wouldn't be in this court today.

The doctrine of selective prosecu­

Obviously,

In the first place, Yick Wo v. Hopkins

dearly.

14

It was an ordinance that was deliberately passed,

I understand that, Your Honor, but

what I'm saying is -QUESTION:

That doesn't help you.

Now what case

helps you on selective prosecution?
MR. FAHRINGER:

Well, I think, Your Honor, I was

20

going to say, in response to Judge Rehnquist's question, the

21

case of Blackledge v. Perry, which is a prosecutorial vindic­

22

tiveness case, but is in the close neighborhood of what we're

23

talking about here.

24

went further than the circuits did in Falk, Steele, Crowthers,

25

and Berrios by holding that due process is violated where

And the Court there said, this Court

21

1

there is prosecutorial opportunity for vindictiveness, even

2

when there is no evidence that the prosecutor acted in bad

faith or maliciously.

4

very close situation where you have prosecutorial vindictive­

5

ness rather than selectivity, and I see them closely allied,

6

this Court recognizing the difficulty of proof that the

7

defendant has, says in those cases if there's appearance of

8

vindictiveness, an opportunity for vindictiveness, then a

9

very heavy burden shifts to the Government to come forward --

What I am urging by analogy is, in a

What would happen if in a hypothetical

case a prosecutor prosecuted a man for murder with 86 eye­

witnesses, but it was shown that they were bitter enemies,

the prosecutor and the man involved?

14

MR. FAHRINGER:

Would that man go free?

Well, no, Your Honor, because, first

of all, he's the only one that has committed the murder so

he hasn't been selected

MR. FAHRINGER:

Well, what I'm saying is, Your

Honor, I assume he'd been properly connected with the murder

21

but secondly, it would seem to me that we would have to

22

evaluate whether it was for an impermissible or unconstitu­

25

What we're saying here in this case is --

Well, we don't know yet whether this

He had the authority to bring prosecutions, I thought.
MR. FAHRINGER:

Well, but at the end he said he

didn't, Your Honor. 1 Now, t find that an inconsistency.

19

remember, in the beginning he says he's in charge but at the

20

very end he said, well, he had to-check with his superiors about

21

the other magazines.

22

in -- I consider this terribly important procedurally -- the

Now, for some reason the Supreme Court

inquired of them.

QUESTION:

Well, what would you ask them?

3

MR. FAHRINGER:

Well, what I would do is, I would

4

say, has there been any consideration given to these Cither

5

magazines ?
QUESTION:

6

Well, he already told you, no, on that.

7

There was no consideration of prosecuting anybody but Hustler

8

as I understand it.
MR. FAHRINGER:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

But, Your Honor, what he said --

And the reason they picked Hustler was

that Hustler, they say, had a head office in Ohio.

12

MR. FAHRINGER:

13

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor --

Don't you have to at least address the

14

question of whether that's an adequate justification for

15

selecting them out?
MR. FAHRINGER:

16
17

I don't believe it is, Your Honor.

Because --

18

QUESTION:

Why not?

19

MR. FAHRINGER:

-- as they concede in their brief,

20

they were mistaken when they said they couldn't bring people

21

in from out of state.

22

fact, Section -- I believe it is 2903 of the State of Ohio

23

Laws says

24

can extradite for misdemeanors, so that he was mistaken in

25

that assumption, so he could have gone after all of the

The extradition law, as a matter of

2963.01 through 2963.29 provides that they

25

1

sophisticated men's magazines and brought all of the people

2

in from out of state.

3

it seems to me the very least we're entitled to is some

4

corroboration of a meeting, of a discussion about evaluating

5

these other magazines and the purchase of those magazines.

6

The police officers went out and got Penthouse and these

7

other magazines and brought them in,

8

said, we made a decision that Hustler is the magazine we're

9

going to go after, then it would seem to me they may well

1 1
12

But, Your Honor, the point I make is,

Judge, I don't believe --

What law, what case ever said that he's

got to articulate his reasons?
MR. FAHRINGER:

16

Well, I read that into -- again,

17

Your Honor, I'm very impressed with the Falk decision out of

18

the 7th Circuit where they say that once, in a First Amendment

19

case, once a prima facie case is made out, the evidence must

20

be compelling and that the Government has a heavy burden. And

21

I think that implies more than just a categorical denial:

22

we did no wrong, that we did what we thought was right.

23

And, Your Honor, it would seem to me, again --

24

25

QUESTION:
case?

Do you read Falk as a constitutional

It was a federal prosecution.
26

Do you read Falk as a

1

constitutional holding?

2

MR. FAHRINGER:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. FAHRINGER:

Yes, I do.

You do.
I don't think, Your Honor, in this

5

area where you involve both the First Amendment and the Four­

6

teenth Amendment, that it makes any difference whether we're

7

in the federal jurisdiction or in the state jurisdiction.

8

I would see this Court handing down a rule that would cover

9

selective prosecution both in state courts and in federal

10

courts.

11

this note at the risk of being repetitive.

12

My time is about expired, but let me just end on

I think the matter the Court should be the most

13

concerned about is, if this selective prosecution were to be

14

sustained on the record that is below, then It seems to me

15

we will have done irreparable damage to that doctrine if it

16

is to survive and remain viable, because basically what

17

could happen in any selective prosecution across the country,

18

a prosecutor could simply come in and say, one, we never in­

19

tended to discriminate against this defendant; and we may go

20

after some of the other defendants later on; and, number three.,

21

we view this as a test case.

22

we run a terrible risk of every single selective prosecution

23

being defeated and that the doctrine will be relegated to

24

a legal museum.

25

If that's the situation, then

Thank you very much.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE A. TAYLOR, ESQ.,

1

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

2

MR. TAYLOR:

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I first would like to make a comment on jurisdic­

5

6

tion.

Usually the state prosecutors who appear in the federal

7

courts, whether it be this Court or district courts, commonly i n

8

1983 actions, the state is usually in reluctance to submit to

9

federal jurisdiction.

However,

I think that the procedural

10

aspect of this case makes it different than other types of

1 1

cases where this Court has determined whether or not the

12

finality rule is subject to an exception bringing a case up

13

here that's interlocutory in nature or whether there are fur­

14

ther proceedings which can be happening in the lower court

15

on remand.

16

prosecutor's appeal.

17

brother and his wife here against their will, as it were.

18

There should be a distinction made by this Court in determin­

19

ing jurisdiction between cases where the prosecutor

21

cution, as it is in double jeopardy.

22

The difference is that in this case we have a

25

leave of court, from the Court of Appeals, and then it can go
28

We have to ask

1

2

further up to the Supreme Court of the state.
One of the requirements of 1257 is that it be a

3

final judgment or a decree of the highest court of the state.

4

Therefore, when you talk about a final decree, the Supreme

5

Court of Ohio has, in effect, taken a ruling which in the

6

trial court level applied only to Larry Flynt and his brother

7

and his wife, and it has broadened it into a statewide policy

8

cementing in stone the rule of law in Ohio, as the Supreme

9

Court of Ohio sees your decisions on selective enforcement.

10
1 1

They have in effect made it for everybody.
QUESTION:

12

distinction, does it?

13

MR. TAYLOR:

1257 certainly doesn't make any such

No, and I reluctantly have to say, not

14

that I agree that the Court should have taken the case.

15

Generally the Court

22

Government has the jurisdiction usually.

23

should supervise all state court rulings

But because of the rulings this Court has made

14

power to do that.

15

MR. TAYLOR

16

QUESTION:

Curry

We don't have any

Not an exception to the rule.
The rule gives us jurisdiction only from

17

final judgments of the highest courts of the state in which

18

the decision was made, and therefore the Cox case and the

19

other cases on which you rely simply said that the judgment

20

was final, within the meaning of the rule, within the meaning

21

of the statute.

22

haven't got any power to do that.

23

It wasn't an exception to the statute.

MR. TAYLOR:

We

Well, by exception, this Court has

24

discussed it as if it were an exception by saying, even thougl

25

we have discussed finality in terms of nothing further to
30

1

happen in the trial court, we have on occasion said that when

2

something further happens in the trial court but it is of

3

no practical significance to the issue decided, that is in

4

effect a final judgment.
QUESTION:

This Court is here to decide cases and

controversies, not to make policy.
MR. TAYLOR:

But our Supreme Court has already made

20

policy, but because

a

prosecutor has the right to appeal,

21

if this Court does not review the Supreme Court of Ohio's

22

case and Larry Flynt is acquitted or we don't prosecute him

23

or something happens, then that ruling'still applies'to every­

24

body else in the --

25

QUESTION:

Isn't that true of every single common
31

1

law jurisdiction in this country, 49 states, that a judgment

2

of the highest court of a state, although it's cast in terms

3

of A versus B, it lays down a rule of law that's applicable

4

to all parties similarly situated.
MR. TAYLOR:

5

Yes, Your Honor, it generally does.

6

I just meant to comment on jurisdiction only because I feel

7

that this Court's, you know, decisions in some of those cases

8

has made the finality rule broad enough to include what we

9

have here.

We have a case where there are further proceed­

10

ings but that's First Amendment and there are lots of cases

11

of this Court -- I'm not saying this Court has or does not

12

or should keep this case or not, but I feel there's a much’

13

broader distinction.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Taylor, at the trial that follows

15

-- assume that the trial does take place in this case, may

the defendants again argue that the prosecution should be

17

terminated because he was selected out for an impermissible

MR. TAYLOR:

that my position is that this Court -QUESTION:

dant is convicted, you're not suggesting that under Ohio law

20

he can't present on appeal to the Court of Appeals --

No, he must.

22

preserve his objection and --

So he can -- the issue of selective

prosecution, if we dismiss this case, could survive and be

MR. TAYLOR:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

by the Supreme Court of Ohio.

Well, but it's been decided in this case

MR. TAYLOR:

Yes, and that's why -- your cases

5

6

cutting down waste, would decide that issue now.

9

QUESTION:

The other

But if, even though the Supreme Court of

Ohio were to adhere to its previous ruling, as it would be

10

expected to do, opposing counsel could certainly preserve

1 1

the point and again petition for certiorari with a final

12

judgment if he's convicted.

13
14

15

QUESTION:

Which he could have done in Cox, of

course, the same thing.
MR. TAYLOR:

That's correct, and that's what I

16

mean, Cox and the other cases, I think that, you know, not­

17

withstanding the way you arrived at them, have carved out

18

the situation which I find myself in. And what I meant to ask

19

the Court is that you take note that by saying that you can

20

supervisorily decide whether the Supreme Court of Ohio cor­

21

rectly announced the law, and that should not be construed

22

by this Court or other courts that that gives the defendant

23

a correlative right to a pretrial collateral appeal if he

24

loses his motion to dismiss.

25

you have to stand trial because you were not selectively

And if the trial judge says, no,

34

1

enforced, that should not give rise to an appeal by him be­

2

fore trial, such as was just decided by the 9th Circuit in

3

the U.S. v. Wilson case, just last month.

4

Circuit has extended this Court's decision in Abney, which

5

said that double jeopardy in a pretrial appeal to vindictive

6

prosecutions, and now they've said vindictive prosecutions

7

are the same as selective prosecutions.

8

Court should be wary of the distinction and that's the only

9

point I meant to make on jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

10

And the U.S. 9th

And I think this

Well, didn't we in our MacDonald say that

speedy trial claims were not governed even within the federal

12

system by Abney?
MR. TAYLOR:

13

Yes, and I think that we are closer to

-- the defendant's losing his motion at trial is governed

15

by that case rather than Abney.

17

the significance of that claim.

defendant's right to a pretrial appeal.

22

tion, I wish that it'd take a distinction between when a

23

prosecutor has the right to appeal, and your merely supervis­

24

ing whether or not the Supreme Court of Ohio made the correct

25

decision.

Abney was decided because of

prosecution cases give rise to a direct appeal or a right of

Now, as far as the merits of the case which is,

4

I think, the real allegation before us, the motive of the

5

prosecutor, I think, is important when it's clear on the facts

6

of the record that the prosecutor's vindictive.

prosecutor in Cameron v. Johnson, for instance, had enforced

8

the need for the anti-picketing statute that was passed while

9

the people were picketing the courthouse and he had picked

What prompted the going after one of

Did they get complaints about any issues

MR. TAYLOR

'76, issue,

the Bicentennial issue, and it was just -- if it had been the

10

July, '75, issue, it might not have raised the stink, but it

11

did because it had a picture on the cover of a girl's bikini

12

made out of a flag and that issue probably just caused more --

it was more visible, so people complained about it, and they

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you very much.

Mr. Levander.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW ■ J. LEVANDER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. LEVANDER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it 'please the Court:
I would like primarily to address the merits of

12

petitioners' selective prosecution claim.

13

out in our amicus curiae brief, we believe that the Court

14

lacks jurisdiction under Section 1257 to hear this case.

15

But, as we pointed

This case is different than Cox Broadcasting and

16

some other cases.

17

sion in San Diego Electric and the long run of cases including

18

Alvez, Republic Gas Company, Radio Station WOW, Cox Broad­

19

casting dictum, which say that where there are other federal

20

issues pending to be determined on the remand, then it would

21

be highly inappropriate for this Court to take jurisdiction

22

of the case which could come back again after all the federal

23

issues had been decided, as has been pointed out in Mr. Justice

24

Rehnquist's comments, the

25

produce other federal questions if petitioners are convicted.

This case falls into this morning's deci­

decision

45

below, the trial, will

1

Of course, if they are acquitted, this Court will hever have

2

to reach the selective prosecution claim, and for those rea­

3

sons we believe that the decision is not final within the

4

meaning of 1257.

5

Now, I would like to make one other point, or two

6

other points.

7

casting and Miami Herald which have stretched the concept

8

of

9

I think, that there was a pressing First Amendment issue

finality

First, some of the decisions like Cox Broad­

to

some

extent, have done so on the basis,

10

which affected

1 1

public as a whole, and there really are no other federal

12

issues to be decided, and therefore it was imperative that

13

the decision be made at that time.

14

the

lot

of

the press as a whole, of the

A selective prosecution claim, and petitioners'

15

selective prosecution claim, is by definition very different.

16

It only affects historical fact and these petitioners, by

17

definition it is not affecting the other members of the press

18

because under their claim the State of Ohio has failed to

19

prosecute other members of the press.

20

you know, clearly inappropriate for the Court to try to

21

stretch the jurisdictional provisions, and I think that the

22

Court should dismiss the writ.

23

Therefore, it seems,

My brother did point out one other matter of great

24

concern on the jurisdictional issue to us, and that is

25

the 9th Circuit's recent decision in Wilson.
46

That decision

1

held that a district court's denial of a selective prosecu­

2

tion claim prior to trial was immediately appealable by the

3

defendant.

4

nal justice system because any defendant can come in and make

5

a selective prosecution claim, and if he's denied a hearing

6

or he's denied on the merits, then he can simply take an

7

appeal.

It's much different than Abney double jeopardy

8

claims.

Also, the Equal Protection Clause does not have the

9

history --

10
1 1
12

Now, that is going to cause havoc with the crimi­

QUESTION:

Is the Government going to try to bring

Wilson here?
MR. LEVANDER: It really can't, Your Honor, because

13

we prevailed on the merits in the case, after they had

14

reached the -- but in deciding this jurisdictional issue,

15

I urge the Court to be very aware of this problem and if

16

the Court would like we'd be willing to submit a post-argument

17

brief in short order on this point, if it would be of any

18

use to the Court.

19

Turning to the merits, the trial court held as a

20

matter of law that where there's a test case, where there is

21

one defendant among similarly situated other defendants, and

22

a prosecution is brought only against the one, that that is

23

legally insufficient.

24

as the Ohio Supreme Court noted in a footnote at the end of

25

its opinion, that there were no ‘factual findings by the

Thebe

were ■ no

47

factual findings,

1

trial court about bad faith, bad motives, cartoons, anything.

2

It simply stated that it was legally insufficient to have

3

a test case.

4

Now, my brother, Mr. Fahringer, has sort of waffled

5

on this point this morning but in his reply brief at page 5

6

he concedes now, begrudgingly, that a test case Is an appro­

7

priate prosecutorial stratagem.

8

warranted by this Court's decisions in Mackay Telegraph,

9

Moog Industries, and Universal-Rundle Corp., which are all

10
11

That concession is well

cited in the briefs, as well as many other cases.
Where there are numerous defendants similarly

12

situated and a prosecutor lacks resources to prosecute all

13

or where the law is of some question, whether the law Is to

14

be applied to a particular kind of situation or a particular

15

kind of defendant --

16

QUESTION:

In that situation, could he select his

17

defendant because of the cartoon he published?

18

view on that?

19

20
21

22

MR. LEVANDER:

No.

What is your

I think he could select him

randomly, and the courts have so held.
QUESTION:

All right, but could he do it because

of the cartoon?

23

MR. LEVANDER:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. LEVANDER:

He could not select --

You agree he could not do that?
If the cartoon is constitutionally
48

1

protected and he was doing it because he was punishing him

2

for an exercise of constitutional right, we would agree, that

3

would be inappropriate.

4

QUESTION:

Well, that's not the question.

MR. LEVANDER:

That's not the question here because

here, it seems to me, the evidence is unequivocal as to what

happened.

9

some of them focused on the magazine as a whole.

There were complaints made about the July Hustler

Some of those complaints focused on the cartoon,
But even

10

assuming that every complaint focused on the cartoon, and

11

that spurred an investigation, it is simply irrelevant in an

12

equal protection case to apply the -QUESTION:

13

Let me ask you one other question.

Let's

14

assume that it was not the sole reason but that's the only

15

distinguishing factor from all other magazines and it was one

16

of the reasons.

Would that be permissible?

17

MR. LEVANDER:

18

QUESTION:

I believe it would be If --

It would be if it was one reason, but

19

as long as you have some other reason, why then it's a test

20

case?

21

MR. LEVANDER:

That's exactly right.

In the

22

Court's equal protection cases, Mt. Healthy v. Boyle, Justice

23

Powell's opinion for the Court in Bakke, in Arlington Heights

24

footnote 21, the Court has repeatedly stated that where In an

25

equal protection case the moving party, here petitioners,
49

1

have established that invidious or intentionally discrimina­

2

tory reason is the motivating cause for a particular kind of

3

state action -- and we don't have that here; we have not

4

established that -- then the burden shifts to the state to

5

show that the invidious factor is not the but-for clause,

6

so that is the test.

Here I don't believe that we get to

7

the but-for problem.

If we do I think

was

made

on various rational

10

factors, including his view that Hustler was more obscene,

11

the fact that it was a more notorious violator of the law,

12

the fact that it was in-state, and even if you could get extra

13

dition over these other out-of-state publishers, there was

14

no need for Cleveland to expend that additional amount of

15

money in bringing a test case to pick the most difficult to

16

prosecute.

17

can pick the strongest case and he can pick the easiest case

18

for himself.

That's entirely appropriate.

QUESTION:

19

20

As the Chief Justice has said, earlier today, he

He can also, can't he, can't he pick one

he just doesn't like?

21

MR. LEVANDER:

Well, then the question goes to --

24

And he's going to pick

Or, in this case, the one that offends

the prosecutor the most?

3

MR. LEVANDER:

4

QUESTION:

Well, certainly where --

Or where -- going to pick the one that

5

he's had the most protests about?

6

MR. LEVANDER:

That is entirely appropriate, because

7

it is an aim of criminal law not only to punish but to deter.

8

And insofar as the particular defendant has the most notoriety

9

and therefore the effect of a conviction will be most telling

10

on a future compliance, certainly picking out the most

1 1

notorious offender is perfectly appropriate.

12

cases like tax cases, for example, where there's a protester

13

who has willfully violated the laws, his public statements

14

will facilitate the prosecution.
QUESTION:

15

And in certain

Well, if he says, in my next campaign

16

I'll get farther if I go after this magazine rather than

17

another?

18

MR. LEVANDER:

Well, one would hope that the prose­

cutorial decisionmaking was not made on --

20

QUESTION: That isn' t what I asked you, what about that?

21

QUESTION:

Would you apply the same standard in

22

tax cases and regulatory cases that you would in cases in­

23

volving publications, magazines and newspapers?

24

MR. LEVANDER:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, I --

Is there the same breadth of discretion
51

1

in the prosecutor to prosecute newspapers if he doesn't like

2

their editorial point of view, for example?
MR. LEVANDER:

3
4

Well, that's -- there's an obvious

First Amendment defense there,,..
QUESTION:

Under your answers, as I understand It,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERALD PRICE FAHRINGER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS -- REBUTTAL
54

MR. FAHRINGER:

1

I wanted to bring to the Court's

2

attention what the trial judge said at the very end of the

3

case.

4

the testimony and must search that testimony objectively in

5

relationship to the constitutional guidelines established

6

by a series of previous judicial decisions on the discrimina­

7

tory prosecution question in this court's decision that the

8

testimony supports the allegation of the defendant."

"For purpose of this motion the court is limited by

9

So I believe, Your Honors, that language can be

10

interpreted, albeit a very short decision, that the judge

1 1

did make a finding, a fact finding decision that the testi­

12

mony in general supported our claim.

The Supreme Court of Ohio didn't agree

with him.

18

That's true, Your Honor.

That's the decision that's binding on

us, isn't it?
MR. FAHRINGER:

Well, Your Honor, I would like to

19

repeat it again, and I apologize for disagreeing with you,

20

that I think in the dissent when they say, we have always

21

given great weight to the trier of the fact, and this Court

22

too has given great weight to the trier of the fact in the

23

past, I think that should be done here.

24
25

Last, let me just say this.

If it is part of the

reason, if the First Amendment implications are part of the
55

1

reasons for prosecuting the magazine, then it seems to me

2

there has to be a much more in-depth inquiry than we had here

3

as to whether or not this is a test case or not.

4

concession is made that it is part of the reason why we

5

went after this magazine, then I don't think it's sufficient

6

simply to label it a test case but that there should be some

7

corroboration of its being a test case.
