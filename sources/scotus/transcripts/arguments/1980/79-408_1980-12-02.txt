ZARWELL:

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

of this case, Illinois v. Milwaukee, is a federal question

That federal ]aw controls the

rights and obligations of dischargers to interstate waters,
where the-, same are called into question in an interstate dispute,
arid such federal law controls tc the exclusion of state law.

The stage was set for the question of the

His exact language was:

Here Justice Douglas, speaking for a unanimous

"New federal laws and new

federal regulations may in time preempt the: field of federal
common law of nuisance." And we have the citation at page 7 of
our brief.
In this frame of reference, the present federal Water
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 19 7 2, modified in 19 7 7 by
the Clear Water Act -- the two I will speak of as the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act, was adopted.
QUESTION:

Do you, think that

Congress in the exer­

23

cise of its legislative function could say that there shall be
24

neither federal common lav.7 in this area, nor federal
25

4

statutory

1

law5 but state law shall govern?

2

MR.

ZARWELL:

No, Your Honor, I do not believe that

3

Congress would have that power constitutionally under the

4

federal system that we have, because that would then lead the

5

states to legislate one against the other in an area where

6

there is a paramount federal interest.

7

8

QUESTION:

But, even though Congress said, there is

no paramount federal interest?

9

MR.

ZARWELL:

Well, whether Congress said so or not,

10

I think this Court has held several times in this type of a

11

controversy be.tween states, either in apportionment of waters

12

or utilization of waters or, I submit, the pollution of waters

13

this is a paramount federal interest where you have interstate

14

waters.

15

QUESTION:

Well, but in the cases involving the

16

allocation of water’s, it was more or less a question where

17

this Court had to derive some system of law because of its

18

jurisdiction, wasn't it?

jurisdiction cases.

MR.

ZARWELE:

That's the scope of your original

submit that whether it. be state against state or state against
citizen, or citizen against state, or citizen against citizen,
where v?e are crossing the: boundaries and a state has a particu

HR. ZARWELL: No, Your Honor, I'm not leading it in

that precise way.

And it was in this frame of reference that the Fed­
eral Water Pollution Control Acts were written.

And because

of the Federa.1 Water Pollution Control Act, the courts are no
longer free to walk into the area and operate as they were be­
fore those enactments and fashion their own remedies, their
own law, in relationship to interstate water pollution, but
rather are controlled by the congressional Act and the regula­
tions adopted thereunder, to the extent that they exist.
6

1

QUESTION:

Do you think that the preemption analysis

2

which would be applied in deciding whether federal statutory

3

law7 preempted federal common law is the same kind of analysis

4

as the Court has applied in other situations not dealing with

5

water, as to whether a congressional statute preempted a state

6

statute?

7

MR. ZARWELL:

It’s the same kind of a preemption, I

8

believe, but here we're dealing, because we're in the same

9

sovereign and the legislature is dealing with something on a

10

policy level, where the courts are dealing with it in the ab­

1 1

sence of legislation, I think that the legislation of Congress

12

controls the activity and the conduct of the courts in a

13

different way than a total displacement that you would have,

14

congressional act as against State enactment.

IS

We are here primarily because, as we view it, the

16

courts below have not followed the mandates of Congress in the

17

regulations in connection with the suit brought by Illinois

18

against these defendants.

19

on and analyzed in considering the question of the effect of

20

21
22
23
24

25

Two sections of the Act are relied

the; Act on other law in the: general sense.

Those sections

are Section 505(e), which in essence permits access tc other
law:; and the 505 (e) section is written in terms of, in essence,
permitting persons to have access to the law that is out
there, common law, statutory law7, whatever law is there from
time to time.

And Congress has specifically said that

7

1

2

litigants may have access to the law that is there, in 505(e).
However, Congress did not say in 505(e) or in any

3

other portion of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act that

4

we are preserving and establishing the law that exists at the

5

time of the adoption of this Act as being the rights, remedies,

6

and the law available to any litigant choosing to avail

7

himself, herself, or itself of that particular body of law.

8

Rather, 505(e) says, you shall have access to the

9

lav.- that may be there as we read it.

Then, there is another

10

section that also deals with the type of area that we're look­

11

ing at, were state lav; involved.

12

argument, that we have reached in the various briefs.

13

Section 510.

14

the1, states have sovereign rights over water pollution dis­

15

charges, etc., within the confines of the particular state.

16

Section 510 preserves that right to the states.

17

And it's one of the areas of

510 does preserve something.

That is

It recognizes that

To the extent that the states control discharges

18

within their own geographica] sovereignty, where they are. deal-'

19

ing with something that they have a right to deal with, this

20

has been preserved by the congressional Act at Section 510,

21

and that continues on

22

that the Congress engrafted on the rights of the states, and

23
24

25

with one very important consideration

that is, the states may not legislate a lesser control than
Congress does under the Act, or that is adopted in the regula­
tions under the Act, federally.
8

1

QUESTI ON:

So that if all of this had taken place

2

in one state, say, in the State of Wisconsin, Wisconsin could

3

have

4

law of nuisance?

5

required

higher standards either by statute or by the

MR. ZARWELL:

Absolutely.

No question but what

7

geographical area and can create both statutory and common law-

8

related material.

QUEST?ON:

MR. ZARWELL:

Your Honor.

13

state.

14

15
16

But your argument's going to be, I take

We don't have to reach that argument,

But I be:lieve that is true, within a particular

QUESTION:

Well, no: no, I mean, in this case, par­

ticular- case?
MR. ZARWELL:

In this case we don't have to reach it

17

because of the fact that the discharges are being challenged

18

by Illinois across the state lines and we're in an interstate

19

body of water.

20

QUESTION:

That’s what I mean.

In this case -- well,

21

I said, federal common law.

22

Court has no business imposing higher standards?

23
24

25

MR. ZARWELL:

Yes.

And you're going to say that the

We are saying here that the Act,

the regulations adopted under the Act, and the permits issued
under the Act have totally controlled this precise situation.
9

1

QUESTION:

So that there may not be a resort to a

2

body of federal lav; that would have been available had the Act

3

not been passed?

4

MR. ZARWELL:

That is correct, Your Honor.

5

again going back to the earlier question of the Court,

6

Wisconsin would be able to impose --

7

8
9

QUESTION:

I understand that.

However,

That isn't involved

in this case?
MR. ZARWELL:

Right.

Again, that is the impact

10

of 505 and 510 and those are the two sections that are most

1 1

commonly referred to in both the briefs of the plaintiffs and

12

the defendants in these cases.

13

QUESTION:

You would not suggest., I take it, that

14

Congress could p>reempt the original jurisdiction of this Court

15

in an area of this kind, would you?

16

MR. ZARWELL:

No, sir, I would not so suggest.

17

Under the enactments of Congress one of the things that is

18

prevalent throughout the various portions of the enactment and

19

one of the things that we have referred to at some length in

20

our brief is the question of costs, and the relevance of cost

21

to the type of imposition that may be imposed upon various

22

discharges in various areas.

23

insofa.r as the regulatory agency, the EPA, is concerned, and

24

25

Congress has explicitly said,

the various state agenci.es operating under the federal system,
that one of the things they must look at is cost a.nd look at
10

1

cost effective systems and see what the relationship is be­

2

tween the cost that's being expended to procure a particular

3

level of effluent, as against what would be required to reach

4

a higher level of effluent.

5

QUESTION:

Let me pursue the point I was just rais­

6

ing that you responded to.

Suppose this Court had appointed

7

this particular district judge as the special master retaining

8

original jurisdiction and he had conducted exactly the hearings

9

which he had conducted here, and came out with precisely what

10

we have now.

1 1

question the validity of that action?

12

13
14

15

I take it, as a natural extension, you would not

MR. ZARWELL:

of this Court to take it..
QUESTION:

Well, you might be arguing here on the

original jurisdiction case, you mean?

16

MR. ZARWELL:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ZARWELL:

19

20

21
22
23
24

25

I would not question the jurisdiction

Yes.

You might be challenging his findings?
But I would challenge the results that

came out, whether it. be from the -QUESTION:

The results, but not the power?

MR. ZARWELL:
QUESTION:

That is 'correct, Your Honor.

Well , you certainly would argue, if it

were to your adva.nta.ge, I take it, that, the master appointed
in an original jurisdiction case by this Court was obligated
to follow an Act of Congress if that Act was applicable,
11

1

wouldn't you?

2

MR. ZARWELL:

3

QUESTION:

If it applied.

4

QUESTION:

If

That is correct, Your Honor.

.it

applied

under

a

statutory

5

lav standard and not any common law standard, that would govern

6

both, the special master and this .Court, wouldn't it?

.7

7

MR. ZARWELL:

8

QUESTION:

9

10

That is correct, Your Honor

In other words, you'd be making the same

argument as you're making here.
MR. ZARWELL:

That is correct.

I would suggest that

1 1

in the situation such as that, at the very least, if this

12

Court were tc exercise its original jurisdiction in that type

13

of case and if it were not to look at the totality of the

14

statutory and regulatory system that is out there, it should

15

at least refer to the EPA and the systems under it and under

16

the statute to get the facts found rather than going to a

17

district court master.

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

25

QUESTION:

But doesn't it get down to a question of

congressional intent?

When Congress enacted the statute, did

it mean that the statutory ,standards, whatever they be, should
displace any federal common law 'standard?
MR. ZARWELL:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly --

And if they can't say that the statute

is to be re.ad that way, then I gather that the common law
standards are not displaced?
12

.

1

MR. ZARWELL:

That is correct.

Now, when Congress

2

acts in a particular area, so as to completely dispose of that

3

area -- all we're dealing with here is point-source discharges

4

-- all point-source discharges are covered by the congressional

5

enactment.

6

the administrative agency for control; again, no exceptions.

7

There isn't any place, for a court to step in and operate.
QUESTION:

8
9

10

There are no exceptions, and they are referred to

Well, it wouldn't have taken Congress very

many words to achieve the result you're arguing for, to write
into the statute a clear, unequivocal statement, would it?
MR. ZARWELL:

1 1

It wouldn't have taken any particular

12

expertise or difficulty to do so, but I believe they have done

13

so.

14

every point source, it doesn't leave any room for anyone else

15

to operate.

16

don't apply common law to it under the federal system.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose Congress in legislating

as to every point source, however, had said, "except with
respect tc certain pollutants"?

That's not legislating with

respect to them.
MR. ZARWELL:

If Congress had definitely left some

pollutants open and some areas where it was not 'legislating,
the courts would have the opportunity to go into that area..
13

1

QUESTION:

So, if in this case there are some dis­

2

charges that are not forbidden by the statute, or by regula­

3

tions , may — certainly the state

15
16

ZARWELL:

ZARWELL:

Not in this particular instance, no,

sir.
QUESTION:

Well, why may not a court insist that

those overflows be stopped?
14

1

MR. ZARWELL:

2

Because the regulatory agency under

the statute has dealt with that particular --

3

QUESTION:

4

Well, you're saying they've in a sense

decided that no one else should stop the overflows either?

5

MR. ZARWELL:

6

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Except that they have authorized these

7

individual states within their own boundaries to adopt more

8

stringent standards?
MR. ZARWELL:

9

Oh, absolutely.

The states could

10

control much more, severely any one of the discharges in any

1 1

one of the areas, as long as it's within the sovereignty of

12

that state, within its own political jurisdiction.

13

problem here is that Congress has said, so far as point-source

14

discharges are concerned, this is the way they will be handled

15

and every one of them will be handled this way.

16
17

QUESTION:

!

20

of the effluent above that.
QUESTION:

And states can raise the level
But they cannot decrease it.

So Congress has not. entirely preempted

the lawmaking function with respect to any particular point?
MR. ZARWELL:

It has clearly not preempted state

25

15

1

activity in these areas and has expressly said that the states

2

do have the right to act in this area, and that is Section 510

3

of the Act.

4

5

QUESTION:

Hasn't it also said common law remedies

shall survive?
MR. ZARWELL:

6

No, it doesn't say common law remedies

7

8

ferring tc, and in that section all it says is that the people

11

"Nothing in this section shall restrict

14

MR. ZARWELL:

15

QUESTION:

Precisely.

Now, if that statute had not been passed

16

and if Illinois had a right under common law without the

17

statute, doesn't this say that right survives?

MR. ZARWELL:

I don't believe so, Your Honor, be­

cause, again, at the time of the adoption of the statute

nothing will restrict the right which it had

but it doesn't say that that right is going to remain, that is
that the common law i.s going to stay the law.
or that statutory lav; that's in existence at the time of the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH V. KARAGANIS, ESQ.,

5

7

If I could reserve

:

briefs filed before this Court, one wonders why the State of

10

Illinois has been doing what it’s been doing for the last ten

1 1

years.

12

Court gave us two very distinct remedies.

13

recognition by this Court in the case of Ohio v. Wyandotte

14

Chemicals that a state has the right, to apply its statutory

15

and common law to abate the tortious conduct cf a nonresident

16

when that conduct causes injury within the forum state.

17

is Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemical, which, I might add, sustained

18

the case law that had been developing for more than 100 years

QUESTION:

22

We were before this Court ten years ago after this

What do you think the status of that case

is now?
MR. KARAGANIS:
is still good law.

The status of that case, Your Honor,

We think that was an 8-1 decision, Justice

Douglas in his dissent wanting to take the case as an original

jurisdiction case.

QUESTION:

Well, we're going to get tc your second

remedy.

4

MR. KARAGANIS :

It I may, Your Honor, the: case has

5

not been overruled by this Court.

6

than that, Your Honor, the Ohio v. Wyandotte case, similar to,

7

as we have emphasi zed several times, such famous cases as The

8

Salton Sea Cases.

So is your

That this is not a. federal question?

MR. KARAGANIS:

15

what is your suggestion

No, Your Honor.

We went back to the

16

district court after this Court told us what tc do in Illinois

17

v. Milwaukee, and did exactly what these twro cases told us to

18

do

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

We filed a three-count complaint, one is based on the

federal common law enunciated by this Court in Illinois v.
Milwaukee.

The second wa.s based on our state statute which is

a long-arm statute exactly designed to deal with the situation
of tortious conduct on coming across astate line, as well as our
state common law.

It was a three-count, complaint.

The federal district court in hearing the evidence
which I'll get to, found liability on al]
22

three counts.

1

Not only federal common 3.aw, but also state common law and

2

state statutes.

3

Milwaukee is, is that ILlinois v. Milwaukee preempted all state

4

law, so that when the; Congress got around to saving all state

5

law7, there wasn't any state law to save.

I must say, Your Honor, that the argument in

It saved, certainly saved state law with­

in its own boundaries.
MR. KAR/vGANIS:

Except, Your Honor, that since The

12

Salton Sea cases there are a variety of cases where torts

13

across state lines -- the examples go back into the 19th

14

century, where torts across state lines, where, if the; injury
occurs in the victimized state, that state has authorily to
apply its law and to exercise in personam jurisdiction.

MR. KARAGANIS:

Your Honor, when you talk about occu

5

occupation of the field, not only as tc the -QUESTION:

6

I don't mean as to the facts of this

7

particular case, but I mean, if one were to conclude that

8

Congress in the Water Act of 1977 had occupied the field, so

9

to speak, except as to the specific exceptions, would that

10

be a preemption?
MR. KARAGANIS:

1 1

I don't believe so, Your Honor,

12

unless they explicitly stated so.

13

hold that Congress by regulating in this field and saying,

14

we're intending to cover, we intend to cover all of the areas

15

of water pollution; if you hold that that prevents the federa.l

16

government or anybody else who has sta.ndi.ng to invoke federal

24

For this reason;

if you

common law, from ever pursuing federal common law, you are
then preventing primarily the Federal Government -- because we
feel we. still have state remedies -- primarily the Federal
Government from evex1 dealing wi.th a pollution situation, or
indeed, as the Government has pointed out in its amicus brief,
a variety of situations, which either Congress could not have
foreseen or because: the regulatory structure, has not been able
to meet.

Now, we're not as concerned about that because we

do feel that for 2 00 years it has been recognized that a state.

QUESTION:

All right.

And -- well, your argument is

3

that it permits the state courts to adjudicate claims based on

4

5

MR. KARAGANIS:

Yes, Your Honor, and I might add,

when I say state courts -- and this is part of the consti­

16

as I'm concerned with respect to the law applied.

17

Your Honor, that if we were up here on a state claim, a state

The interpretation of that, minimum technology-based

It said, look,

that 1965 Federal Water Pollution Control Act gave us some

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. LEVANDER, ESQ.,

6

Very well.

Mr. Levander.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. LEVANDER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The primary issue in this case, from the Government's;

10

point, of view, is whether the Clean Water Act preempts the

1 1

federal common law of nuisance,that this Court recognized and

12

applied i.n this very case eight years ago.

13

as I'1] point cut in a moment, as Mr. Justice Brennan has said,

14

is a1 question of congressional intent.

15

And that question,

Now, at the outset I would life to point cut that

16

petitioners in this case in the Court of Appeals expressly

17

conceded that the Clean Water A^ct does not preempt federal

18

common law of nuisance.

19

tion respectfully to page A7 of that act,, where the Court cf

20
21

22
23
24

25

And I would point Your Honors* atten­

Appeals notes this concession.
In any event, that concession is well warranted, in
the Government's view.

As the Chief Justice has pointed out,

it is very simple for Congress to put into an act an intent tc
preempt and it did so in Section 312(f) with regard to a very
select kind

of regulations.
37

1

QUESTION:

Well, we've held in many cases, have we.

2

not, that where Congress has occupied the field, even though

3

it has not expressly said we intend to preempt state law,

4

state law is nonetheless preempted?

5

MR.

LEVANDER:

State law?

That is correct.

But

6

when one does that, that is a. reflection of the Court's find­

7

ing that the application of state law would interfere with

8

congressional design and therefore it must have been Congress's

9

intent to preempt.
Now, in this case, we have several provisions of the

10
11

statute which reflect quite an opposite intent in our view.

12

First, as wa.s mentioned before, we. have Section 505 (e), which

13

specifica]ly says that people who have rights under the common

14

law and other sta.tutes still have those rights.
Second, we have Section 510 which says that the

15
16

states may impose stricter requirements.

17

their argument suggested that the statute clearly was the end-

18

all-and-be-a.ll for federal

19

Section 511.

20
21

22
23
24

25

Now, petitioners in

lav.7, but they neglect to mention

Section 511 of the Act says that other federal

law may impose higher requirements, and that nothing in the
Act is intended to restrict or limit those other federal bodies

of 1aw.
Now, the legislative history of the Act shows that
Congress was fully aware of and focused on federal common law
of nuisance, and that it intended to preserve the rights and
38

1

remedies under that body of law.

2

language in both the reports emphasizing that the Section

3

505(e) makes clear that compliance with the Act is not a de­

4

fense to nuisance actions or other kinds of actions.

and if you go to the decision, they say the

my understanding of what my brother has just

said, from Maine, this Act, passage of this Act will not
affect the counts of the Reserve Mining suit under the Refuse
Act, under the old Pollution Control Act, and of ether law,
that is, the common lav;.
So, another piece of legislative history which is not:
explored fully in the briefs occurs in a House debate in which
Representative Dingell, who is a sponsor of the Act in the
House, refers with approval, and quotes from a report issued
before the enactment of the Clean Water Avct, but which was not
issued in conjunction with the Clean Water Act.

Congress focused, and it said what it intended

QUESTION:

Are you relying on a quote from a single

member of the House of Representatives on the floor of the
House in reference to another report as being a .statement of
the will of Congress?
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, first of all, we have the spon­

sor in the Senate and Senator Hart in particular who focused
on the federal common law nuisance cl.aim and said that the
Act would not affect it.

That's, it seems to me, a fairly

23

focused discussion.

Second, we have, the statement in the

24

Senate report accompanying the Act which says that, compliance
25

40

1

with the Act will not be a defense to other kinds of actions.

2

And third,

5

was therefore, as petitioners initially suggest in their

briefs, completely unaware of the federal common law of nui­

Congress, and the report suggests that they were aware of

Now, the Section 505(e), the savings clause, is

10
11

part of a pattern of congressional enactment, I might point

12

out.

13

similar savings clause appears and this, in our view, is indie

ative of continuing congressional intent to preserve these

common law remedies.

16

legislation which is now pending in Congress and which may be

enacted very shortly and of which the Court should be aware,

18
19

22
23
24

And I would point out to the Court

and that is the so-called "superfund” legislation which has
passed the Senate as S. 1480.
Now, Section 107(i) and -(j) of that bill, which is

Now, in the last, couple minutes I wish to address,

if I might, the claims that there are lots of adequate reme­

13

the doctrines of primary jurisdiction and exhaustion of ad­

But there is no such regulation regarding pathogens.

16

Now, all the remedies that are suggested at pages

19

situation.

20

25

There is no way for them to enforce their own

QUESTION:

Is it your position that what the Court

did with respect to the pollution standards here is incon­
sistent with your view of preemption?
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, we have not taken any position

on the remedy in this case.

A few comments on that last colloquy.

The comment

here of counsel is that there is no regulation of pathogens.
This completely disregards EPA's own affidavit and one of the
things that they are directing, the effluent limitations'that
they impose.

One of the things they are directing those

effluent limitations toward is the elimination of pathogens in
the procedures that

reduce those effluent levels.

Likewise, so far as the Court of Appeals reversing
the level of the required effluent standards imposed by the
district court, this was on the basis of a lack of proof of
