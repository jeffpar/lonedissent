Mr. Kovar, I think probably you may now proceed

We'll hear arguments

MR. KOVAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We are here asking that defendants be given the

right, short of complete capitulation to extricate themselves

from the burdens of unwarranted and costly litigation.

believe that Rule 68, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, pro­

We

In this regard, we note Mr. Justice Stewart's

8

admonition in the Christiansburg case, in which he noted that

9

many defendants are small, mid-size employers, and that the

20

expense of defending even a frivolous claim may become a

2

strong disincentive to the exercise of their legal rights.

22

We submit that the public policy with respect to

23

Title VII actions does indeed ask that it be easier to bring

meritorious suits.

Title VII actions that there should be a diminishment of

extent, emphasize that it was a Title VII lawsuit, but do you
think or do you not that that makes any difference with
respect to the meaning of Rule 68?
MR. KOVAR:
Your Honor.

I think that Rule 68 is clear on its face, and

QUESTION:

And whatever it means, it means the same

thing in any federal lawsuit.

15

I think it does not make any difference,

that it has no exceptions --

know the parties to some extent and the amici to a greater

Rule 68 provides a realistic access to such freedom.

Stewart.

QUESTION:

What do you think the Rule 1

18

may be, if any; does the concept of Rule 1 pervade all of the

19

rules ?

20

MR. KOVAR:

I think indeed it does, Mr. Chief

21

Justice, and as I understand it, Rule 1 says that all the

22

rules shall be construed to secure the just, speedy and inex­

23

pensive determination of every action.

24

QUESTION:

Do you think that embraces the idea that

good faith offers are -- that an offer must be a bona fide

MR. KOVAR:

or a bona fide offer or a genuine offer or a reasonable offer
has absolutely no application under Rule 68, any more than
it has application as to what is a reasonable ransom request
for a kidnapped child or Iranian hostages.

MR. KOVAR:

yes, Your Honor.

determination and the definition of what is reasonable.

QUESTION:

Would you say a bad faith offer was

2

just?
3

HR. KOVAR:

I don't think there's any such thing

4

as a bad faith offer, Yo.ur Honor.

If we are offering judgment to

5

a plaintiff, our motivation is no more important than is the
6

motivation of the plaintiff in determining whether an action

7

is vexatious.
8

QUESTION:

Well I thought your point was, Mr. Kovar,

9

that by definition any offer that is higher than what the
10

plaintiff eventually gets, is reasonable.

of the qualities, that a May 12 offer of judgment certainly
is speedier than a June 12, 1978 judgment.
it should be inexpensive.

And Rule 1 says

The very time involved in the

litigation as distinguished from the offer of judgment which
was made in May of '77, would indicate that it would have been
far less expensive for the offer of judgment to have prevailed
in the clear reading, as we believe it clear, of Rule 68 to
have prevailed.

We can take notice that here today, November
6

1

12, 1980, a good deal of time and a good deal of money have
2

gone under the bridge in this matter.

this case, this was a Title VII case but there were two counts
to it.

One was the Title VII, the second was the libel and

slander.

That second count was dismissed on motion of defen­

dant for summary judgment prior to the trial without objection
by the counsel for the plaintiff, due to the fact I submit,
that in deposition plaintiff admitted she had no evidence
whatsoever as to any libel or slander statements by the
defendant.
As to the first count, the Title VII count which
did go to trial, respondent by its briefs would have this
Court believe that there was a close question of liability.
For example, at page 13 of the brief, it was stated, "as the
District Court observed, Ms. August at least had presented a
prima facie case."

And at page 21 of the brief, the respon­

dent's counsel notes, "in this case, the District Court noted
that Ms. August's evidence unrebutted would have been suffic­
ient to support her claim."

And the Court of Appeals supported

the lower court opinion.
I think a reading of the District Court's opinion
and the Circuit Court's opinion as to the merits would find

24

that that was not the case; that the lower court, the trial

25

court itself, found that by cross-examination of the plaintiff
7

and plaintiff's witnesses, there was equal evidence, equal

number of cases, where blacks were favored or whites were

disfavored.

So, to that extent she made a prima

MR. KOVAR:

I don't believe, Your Honor, with all

15

due respect, that that would create a prima facie case; that,

16

the mere fact that an adverse employment decision affected

17

a member of a protected minority does not, in my opinion,

create a prima facie case.

MR. KOVAR:

25

from private.

QUESTION:

It involves the Constitution, not Title VII.

QUESTION:

Does it have anything to do with it?

MR. KOVAR:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

I did

note, however, that the Seventh Circuit said in its decision

6

on the merits, that the plaintiff offered some proof which

7

suggested discrimination, but the evidence was superficial,

8

incomplete, inadequate or otherwise defective.

9
10

Your Honor, that that is not a finding by the Seventh Cir­
cuit that there was even a prima facie case.

11

Now we've called for these corrections to be noted in

13

of the vagaries of

against the plaintiffs come

MR. KOVAR:

to?

No sir, we do not, there was never

QUESTION:

I mean, it's probably several thousand

MR. KOVAR:
QUESTION:

Yes, I think there's -Do you know, for example, whether you are

seeking attorneys fees?

16

MR. KOVAR:

17

QUESTION:

I do not know that.
But you would take the position, I take

18

it, that as a matter of statutory law you would be entitled

19

to ask for them as costs under the Title VII case; to that

20

extent, this may be a different Title VII factor may make a

21

difference have.

22

MR. KOVAR:

Well I believe that I've seen the number

23

of 40, I've seen the number of 75 different pieces of liti­

24

gation which called for the possibility of attorneys fees as

25

being imposed in certain actions.

And in any of those, yes,
10

1

I would say, and including Title VII, I would say that the
2

possibility of asking for attorneys fees as part of costs is
3

a realistic possibility.

reasonable.

provides that type of condition.

19

ment finally received; that, by definition is a reasonable
offer of judgment.

As a matter of fact, the District Court

quoted from the Perkins case, stating that the defendant may
offer what is really due and put the burden of costs on the
plaintiff.

When in this case what was really due was nothing

and the trial court found and said that it had no difficulty
finding that the plaintiff was entitled to nothing.
QUESTION:

In this respect, you don't have to defend

the idea of a $1.00 offer, do you?

You offered how much,

again?

MR. KOVAR:

QUESTION:

22

MR. KOVAR:

QUESTION:

24

MR. KOVAR:

And as I indicated earlier,

it is our position that if the offer made exceeds the judg­

18

I submit that there is nothing in Rule 68 which

$450.00 -$450.00.
-- plus costs.
-- plus costs, so that -That's correct, Your Honor.

In terms

of reaching the extreme, we don't have that situation here.
11

1

But I think from the point of view of the application of the
2

rule that the definition of what is reasonable comes in the
3

end result.

The rule says that if the offer

exceeds that

4

which is received then the rule applies and the mandatory
5

cross-shifting applies.
6

QUESTION:

Mr. Kovar --

7

MR. KOVAR:

Yes, Mr. Justice?

8

QUESTION:

-- what, in your offer, what did the

9

term costs include?

MR. KOVAR:

QUESTION:

15

MR. KOVAR:

20

25

No, Your Honor.

We included cos ts other

attorneys fees.
QUESTION:

In round figures, would you give us some

idea of what the costs would mean, $10, $50, $100?

18
19

Did it include attorneys fees up to

than attorneys fees because we said the $450 would include

16
17

Well it included --

that point?

13
14

What did you mean by costs?

MR. KOVAR:
some

At that point there were of course

filing fees and there was one, I believe, one depo­

sition .
QUESTION:
MR. KOVAR:

So that, as I understand that -Whatever costs

the Court might attribute

in those, would include the additional costs .
QUESTION:

There is an assertion here that counsel

spent up to the time of your offer some 39 hours, and that her
12

1

hourly rate was $50.

I take it you questioned that?

2

MR. KOVAR:

It's not in the record, Your Honor, we

3

did -- we did very much question the inclusion of that in
4

the presentation to this Court.
5

The fact of the matter is, however, that the value
6
7

8

of

the attorney services in an action such as this could have

been on a contingent basis and one-third of zero, I submit is
zero.

9
10

11
12
13
14

QUESTION:

not a Title VII action, but simply a personal injury action,
and not a contingent fee action, an attorney could have put
in 1,000 hours, thinking that he had a real blockbuster of
a lawsuit and declined your tender, and gotten a defense ver­
dict from the jury.

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Well and also, I take it, if this were

MR. KOVAR:
quite possible.

That's quite possible, Your Honor; that's

And it is possible that a Title VII counsel

knows full well that recovery may be zero, and zero attorneys
fees.

And regardless of the number of hours put in the matter,

that at that point the attorney certainly has a right to
determine, along with his or her client, that $450 will
suffice to cover attorneys fees as well as whatever division
is going to be made for the party himself or herself.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kovar, let me interrupt.

to follow through on one other thing, too.

I'd like

Do you have any

comment about Robert Dodge's remarks back in 1938, which as I
13

1

read them, had to do with the restriction of Rule 68 to the
2

situation where there is a verdict for the plaintiff and not
3

a verdict for the defendant?
4

MR. KOVAR:

Well my comment, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

5

would be that that certainly is one of the situations in which
6

the rule would apply. That under most state laws, not all,

7

all legal actions -- the prevailing party did.get costs.

So

8

that the application of the rule would not be required where
9

the plaintiff was victorious.

But as indicated in our reply

10

brief, our brief review of the later Title VII cases, indi­
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

cates that the trial courts in their discretion all too often
do not award costs to a prevailing defendant

and that the

discretion called for under Rule 54(d) is not exercised in
favor of the prevailing party in all too many cases.

We

find -QUESTION:

Well if the

discretion is not exercised

the prevailing party is awarded costs, isn't he, under Rule 54?
MR. KOVAR:

Yes, the rule says of course, the pre­

vailing party should receive costs except -QUESTION:
MR. KOVAR:

Except where otherwise ordered.
Yes.

And to that extent where the Court

exercises its discretion and denies the costs tO' the prevailing
party, and that seems to be happening all too often in our
opinion, in Title VII actions; Rule 68 has an even greater
application and a greater need for defendants.
14

But of course,

1

in state actions, both before and since, in equitable actions,
2

whether they were for money alone or for other equitable con­
3

siderations or equitable relief, there is the exercise of
4

discretion in determining where costs would fall, existed both
5

before and after the rule.
6
7

QUESTION:

Mr. Kovar, I take it from your answer that

you don't buy the Dodge remark?

8

MR. KOVAR:

I do not.

9

QUESTION:
10

11

12
13
14

of Rule 68, if a defendant, defense bar routinely made a $10
settlement offer in every case, that would have the effect of
taking away the discretion of the judge under Rule 54 if the
defense had ultimately prevailed?

17
18
19
20

21
22
23
24
25

And that would really be

a sound practice for the defense bar to do that routinely then?

15
16

Is it not correct that under your view

MR. KOVAR:

I believe that's correct, Your Honor.

If

it did happen routinely and if that meant that the Court was
relieved of part of the congestion which now faces it, it would
be a benefit not only to the public but to the judiciary as
well.
QUESTION:

If that is a correct reading of the rule,

how do you explain the fact that it’s taken so long for the
defense bar to realize that rule was there, and had that
potential benefit?
MR. KOVAR:
stand, Your Honor.

That I think is very difficult to under­
The -- and it may very well be -15

finally obtained by the offeree, in accordance with Mr.
Justice Blackmun's suggestion a moment ago.

5
6
7
8
9

10
11

I suppose it's possible that they read

MR. KOVAR:

Or it may well be that they relied upon

the courts, the federal courts, following Rule 54(d) rather
than exercising discretion and denying costs to the prevailing
defendant.

And only now seeing that that discretion has been

exercised more and more, that they find need of some other way
of protecting themselves and fortunately have found Rule 68.
We have submitted and we believe that the lower courts;

12

erred in at

13

rule is clearly mandatory, that the word must means must, and

14

does not permit or allow for a revision or a rewriting of that

15

determination; that the drafters of the rules made it quite

16

clear when they wanted to use the word may, when they wanted

17

to permit discussion, they did so, with clarity, with ease,

18

and on many, many occasions.

19

least

three respects.

We believe that the

Only on a few occasions in the drafting of those

20

rules did they use the word must.

21

cases that in all of those cases where the word must has been

22

used and it has come up for review, must has been construed to

23

mean just that; the mandatory term of must.

24

ourts below attempted to rewrite Rule 68 and we submit that

25

the courts below had no such authority.

And it is our view of the

16

We say that the

1

And finally, we submit that what the Court did,
2

below, was to equate Rule 68 with Rule 54(d), making the two
3

of them basically the same, permitting for discretion to be
4

exercised in either case.

We noted in our briefs to this

5

Court that under Rule 54(d), the Seventh Circuit has indicated
6

that that discretion should be very sparingly exercised and
7

that there should be a clear explication as to why costs were
8

being denied a prevailing defendant and indicated that it
9

was a form of penalty.

And we felt that it was relevant

10

because the Seventh Circuit had equated the two rules to look
11

to the standards that that court itself had applied, when
12

discretion was exercised under 54(d) and denying costs.
13

It is our belief, Your Honor, that the rule is
14

clear on its face.

That it does not permit a rewriting or a

15

conditioning, and we note in that respect that this Court had
16

cause to look at, I believe, Rule 23, when it came to class
17

actions and it said in the Eisen case, we're not going to
18

rewrite the rules for certain classes of plaintiffs as dis­
19

tinguished from others; that if there is a notice provision, th
20

notice provision applies and that we don't look to the pocket21

22

book of the plaintiffs to determine whether this rule is going
to apply to this class as distinguished from that class.

And

23

we note also, in the General Telephone case, that this Court
24

made it quite clear that it was not saying that the rules do
25

not apply to EEOC actions and Title VII actions, that the -17

1

that all it was saying in that case was that an EEOC action
2
was not a class action.
3

QUESTION:

I take it that what you're saying is

4

that if the system wants a good faith component in the rule,
5

the rule should be rewritten?
6

MR. KOVAR:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Because

7

to put a good faith requirement or condition
8

into

it seems

to me, to leave it unclear to both parties as to what has

9

happened; there is no clear reason why a plaintiff should
10

11
12

realistically assess his or her claim at that point and know full
well that there is still a determination later on as to whether
somebody determines that was a good faith offer or not.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. SUSAN M. VANCE, ESQ.,

19

21

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

18

Very well.

MS. VANCE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a Title VII case, it does make a difference
that that is true. To allow Rule 6 8 to operate in this case
would undercut the intent of Congress to promote vigorous
enforcement of Title VII.
18

1

5

This is a complex case.

Title VII is a complex

statute, and litigation under Title VII is routinely complex.
This is noted in the amicus brief filed on behalf of the
defendant.

This Title VII claim is an equitable claim.

The

key in this case is not money damages, but that Ms. August

6

wanted her job back, she wanted the seniority that she had

7

lost when she was terminated by Delta Air Lines after four

8

years, she wanted the back pay that she was entitled to after

9

she had been terminated, and she wanted to be made whole by

10

being awarded her attorneys fees and costs.

11

QUESTION:

Ms. Vance, am I to understand that, by

12

your emphasis on the fact that this was a Title VII action,

In this case --

And that Rule 68 is what, simply inap­

of Rule 68 is applicable only

That is correct.

That is what my argu­

ment is .
QUESTION:

But your proceeding is an action in the

federal courts, is it not?
19

MS. VANCE:

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

So how do you get around the provision

3

of Rule 1, that these rules shall apply to all suits in the
4

federal courts?
5

MS. VANCE:

These rules shall apply to all suits

in federal courts, but I submit that in the application of

7

those rules, it was not the intent that the cost

MS. VANCE:

I understand that.

If Rule 68 applies,

it is -- it is Ms. August's position that the offer

QUESTION:

Did you argue below that 68 did not apply

15

to Title VII actions?

MS. VANCE:

I don't believe we did, Your Honor.

That it does not apply, even though you

MS. VANCE:

I raised it in my brief, Your Honor, yes

I believe it further supports the argument.

And at the

Appellate Court level, we did raise arguments of public policy
and the fact that Title VII cannot be undercut by Rule 68,
and I believe that's incorporated in this argument that I am
making now.
This case was not a simple case.
22

This case lasted

1

25 days.

At the end of ten days of plaintiff's case, a

2

directed verdict motion by the defendant was not granted by
3

the District Court.

The defendant proceeded to spend approx­

4

imately 8 to 10 days presenting their case and after that, the

plaintiff rebutted.
QUESTION:

Well what if this had been an anti-trust

case, that took you exactly the same amount of time, 25 days,
and it consumed exactly the amount of time in attorneys fees?
Would you say there that Rule 68 didn't apply?
MS. VANCE:

No, I would think that Rule 68 would

apply, but I think the question of whether the offer of $450
-- whether that offer was reasonable would have to be raised.
And if the plaintiff had not prevailed, I don't think Rule 68
would have applied.
The same standard as addressed by Christiansburg in
the award of attorneys fees applies in this case, and that is
whether the litigation brought by the plaintiff was frivolous,
unreasonable or groundless.

This Court, just as recently as

Monday, addressed the underlying policy of Title VII in Hughes

20

case, saying that we should not undercut Title VII by allowing

21

an award against the plaintiff that will substantially inter­

22

fere with their ability to bring this kind of lawsuit.

23
24
25

In this

case, there were numerous incidences where black flight atten­
dants were dealt with more harshly than white flight attendants
The lower court said that standing on rebuttal the evidence

would have raised the necessary inference of racial bias .

2

that's not a prima facie case then I don't know what one is.

Ms. August would void all the public policy embodied in Title
VII and close the door on all but the airtight cases, a pro­
position this Court rejected, in Christiansburg in 1978.

it still doesn't apply in this case.

If

The operative sentence in the rule reads that if a
judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable
than the offer, the offeree must pay the cost incurred after
the making of the offer.

Ms. August didn't obtain anything.

Her complaint was dismissed with prejudice after 25 days of
trial.
QUESTION:

So you say a take nothing judgment then

is not a judgment less favorable?
MS. VANCE:

That is correct, Your Honor.

She didn't

obtain anything.

21

the entire sentence, and not just the words must, like Delta

22

would have us do, but if you read the entire sentence, the

23
24
25

The common sense of that phrase, if you read

meaning of the sentence is that the plaintiff must prevail.
If you look at the advisory committee notes you see a refer­
ence to three state statutes:

Minnesota, Montana and New York.
24

1
2
3
4

That's all it said in the advisory committee notes, and I
submit that that means that those statutes and the case law
underlying them was incorporated as a reference to tell us
what to do with Rule 68.

5

QUESTION:

But would it make any sense, so far as

6

the drafters of Rule 68 are concerned, to say that if the

7

plaintiff prays for $10,000 in damages and gets only $8,000

8
9
10

in damages and has been offered that amount previously, then
the defendant gets costs; but if the plaintiff gets nothing,
the defendant is not allowed costs?

11

MS. VANCE:

You see what would happen if you allowed

12

the rule to operate that way, is it will totally destroy any

13

of the discretion contained in Rule 54(d) with respect to the

14

defendants that prevail.

15

meant to operate, not in a vacuum -- Rule 68 isn't a rule that s

16

totally unrelated to any other rule.

designed, even if you look at how the rules are set out, Rule

18

is made by a statute or a rule, prevailing parties as of

course will be awarded their costs in the discretion of the

court.

instance where

the party brought an action and continued in the action and
ultimately won something, but took up the time of the Court
to determine the relief that they were entitled to, when they
could have solved that problem themselves. What; it is, Rule
68 operates when there's admitted liability, or when lia­
bility is found.
QUESTION:

But Rule 54 allows the District Court

to disallow costs to the prevailing party in its discretion.

14
15

Because Rule 68 applies to where a party

prevails but wins less than the offer. If an

Well then why do you need Rule 54, if

MS. VANCE:
does allow that.

16

For special reasons, that's right.

It

And that is done under special circumstances.

QUESTION:

So without 68 at all,

the District Court

17

could have disallowed costs here, if -- finding that the pre­

18

vailing party for any number of reasons, was not entitled to

19

them.

20

MS. VANCE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

But in

21

this case, Ms. August didn't prevail, and the costs are being

22

sought by the prevailing party from her.

23

wants to do is to be able to make a nominal offer, even

24

25

that they won't have to worry about whether or not they will

And what Delta

If you use the

rules the way they want to use the rules

a penny won't be enough if the plaintiff bringing the case

doesn't win anything.

QUESTION:
is

a

Well if there's--suppose this

class action and there are 100 thousand people in

the class, an offer of a penny to each of those 100 thousand

people is not an insubstantial amount of money.

Then, Your Honor, I submit that the

In this case, the Court didn't have any trouble
deciding, none of the four judges had any difficulty at all
deciding that the $450 offer is not worthy of review by the
plaintiff.

If you look at the general provisions in the state

practice, before -- before Rule 68 was enacted, the general
rule is that losing parties pay the winning parties' costs.
Statutes, like Rule 68, were enacted to prevent abuse of this
rule.

These statutes are the only explanatory reference in

the advisory committee notes and should be incorporated.

The same harmonioi.

that had been working since 1862, since the Civil

War, was the statutory scheme that was adopted in the Federal
Rules.

There was no reason that it should work any differently

27

than it had before and if you look at the case law that's
2

under those statutes, you'll see that -- there is not one
3

reported case where the defendant, where the prevailing -4

won something.

If you look at the disparity between those figures

to figure out

how much relief should be awarded and that's

what the rule

was designed to do, was to cut out the time that

the Courts were going to spend when liability was known.

In

any case, if the purpose of Rule 68 is to be served, the
purpose being to encourage settlements and to avoid protracted
litigation, offers have to be reasonable.
that Delta's offer was not reasonable.

Four judges found

The burden isn't just

on the plaintiff to be realistic when they're litigating, and
when you make

as Delta here

is suggesting, there is no additional risk to

them.

In fact, what there is, is the security -- if the rule

is going to operate the way they suggest -- in knowing that
your costs are ultimately covered.

of litigation are already going to clearly be incurred by the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. ELINOR H. STILLMAN, ESQ.,

23

AS AMICI CURIAE

24
25

Very well.

MRS. STILLMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
30

1

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and

2

the United States are participating in this case because it is

3

a Title VII case and because we think the purposes of Title

4

VII would be undermined if Rule 68 were permitted to operate

5

as petitioner asserts it should operate.

6

We have not argued that Rule 68 doesn't apply in

7

Title VII actions, although we would certainly urge the Court

8

as one of the amici has,to -- if it assumed that Rule 68

9

applied in Title VII actions, to limit its decision and not

10

decide the question of class actions at this time.

11

QUESTION:

12

MRS. STILLMAN:

13

QUESTION:

Isn't it your argument -It presents a difficult problem --

--though, Mrs. Stillman, that Rule 68

14

means something different in Title VII actions from what it

15

does in ordinary federal lawsuits, in other federal lawsuits-?

16

MRS. STILLMAN:

Your Honor, we made three arguments

17

in our brief, and as to two of those arguments, we think they

18

would apply to any type of civil action.

19

QUESTION:

20

MRS. STILLMAN:

21

The first argument, whether we think the rule does

22

In the federal court?

not apply where the offeree does not finally obtain a judgment.

23

QUESTION:

24

MRS. STILLMAN:

25

In the federal court, yes.

Yes.
We think this is plain from its

language, and by the way, I would also like to point out that
31

1

2
3
4
5

I think it's plain from the language of the original rule in
1938, which was somewhat changed in 1946, -- this is not in
our brief, but is the result of recent enlightenment -- the
original rule said "if the adverse party fails to obtain a
judgment more favorable than that offered, he shall not

6

recover costs in the District Court from the time of

7

offer, but shall pay them from that time."

8

there of the drafters was they were assuming that otherwise

9

he would have recovered his costs and this comes straight out cf

the

The clear premise

10

of the state practice and those three state statutes that were

11

cited by the drafters, that generally the prevailing party

12

recovered costs and this was a rule to prevent that from

13

happening, where the prevailing plaintiff had turned down a

14

reasonable offer.

15

prevent someone from prolonging litigation when a reasonable

16

offer was made to them.

17

What the rule is designed to do is to

The rule will never work if defendants are permitted,

18

as they have candidly announced here, that will be the routine

19

practice of the defense bar, if they come in and make one

20

penny offer served with the complaint -- served with the answer,

21

I suppose -- it can only have two results:

22

the party will turn down the offer because it's patently un­

23

reasonable and who would want to accept such an offer; the other

24

thing is that in the other possible result that is in those

25

cases where the plaintiff is in very precarious financial
32

one result is,

1
2

situation, typical Title VII cases, those are the ones on whom
the rule might exert pressure to accept even an unreasonable
offer, for fear of being socked with costs, with defense
costs at a later time.

QUESTION:

Why do you need Rule 54(d)?

Why did the drafters of the Federal Rules

of Civil Procedure speak in Rule 54(d) that the prevailing
party shall be awarded his costs unless the court otherwise
directs, if your interpretation of Rule 68 is correct?

12
13

Mrs. Stillman, why do you need Rule 54(d)

MRS. STILLMAN:

I suppose that they wanted greater

certainty with respect to offers of judgment and to confine --

answer is that it wouldn't cover this case.

MRS. STILLMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

That is the

answer.

But wouldn't Rule 54(d) cover the water­

front, so to speak, if you are right?

10

is that they don't like the way Rule 54(d) has been applied
recently by District Courts.

And so they want to misuse

Rule 68, to repair what they think is an
Rule 54(d).

incorrect use of

I think that's really what's going on here.

I

don't see that Rule 54 -- Rule 68 becomes unnecessary if
Rule 54(d) applies, because in the rule

-- in Rule 54(d) the

prevailing party ordinarily recovers his costs unless the
Court directs otherwise. What Rule 68 will do is reverse that
presumption, really; when the losing defendant shows that he
made a reasonable offer.

11

QUESTION:

And that's the effect of Rule 68.

But that's on the assumption that the

12

Plaintiff -- that 68 is limited to the cases where the Plain­

13

tiff has won something, but not all.

14

MRS. STILLMAN:

15
16

QUESTION:

That's right.

If you're wrong on that assumption, that

doesn't explain why 54(d) doesn't cover everything.

That's right.

MRS. STILLMAN:

Well we don't think we're wrong

that assumption.

QUESTION:

What I had in mind, in my question to

construction of Rule 68 -- have special force in Title VII

If a

offer?

No, Your Honor.

We don't think so.

Because we think that -- I'm relying here on, I suppose,

common sense.

said the purpose of the rule was and the purpose -- I mean,

9

what everyone understood the purpose of the rule to be, which

10

was to encourage judgment -- to encourage settlements. And it

wouldn't encourage settlements to allow defendants to make

unreasonable offers.

Then by hypothesis, any offer that was higher

MRS. STILLMAN:

I'm not sure I want to concede that,

attempting to change the scope of the judgment.
QUESTION:

So you're changing your answer?

MRS. STILLMAN: Yes.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MRS. STILLMAN:

I would finally emphasize that we do

think that a Rule 68 offer, if the Court needs to reach this
ground, a Rule 68 offer in the Title VII case does not comply
with the requirements of the rule if it does not include an
offer of attorneys fees because in a Title VII case, by def­
inition costs includes attorneys fees.

And the rules , the

it as part of costs.

4

QUESTION: Well it said $450 which shall be deemed

to include attorneys fees.
6

MRS. STILLMAN:

We don't think that complies with

7

the rule, because the rule says you have to make an offer and
8

then you have to offer to pay costs then accrued; and you
9

can't limit what accrued costs are.
10

QUESTION:

But you

can't be sure that the costs that

the parties arranged between themselves as to attorneys fees

I'm entitled to recover attorneys fees.

That doesn't

mean you would be entitled to recover $25,000, does it?
MRS. STILLMAN:

No, Your Honor, this would operate

just in the way -- in the same way the taxable items of costs
under Section 1920 would operate.

It may be that certain
40

1

events have occurred, but the parties have incurred certain

expenses for photocopying, for example, and they might say

ORAL REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. ALLEN KOVAR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. KOVAR:

17

QUESTION:

Thank you, Your Honor.
May I ask you a question at the outset?

18

MR. KOVAR:

22

Honor.
QUESTION:

Was that because you didn't look at the

record or because it wasn't there when you made the offer?
MR. KOVAR:

It was not my understanding that it was

available as a matter of open record, Your Honor.

until counsel announced this morning.
QUESTION:
MR. KOVAR:

That's not the rule in Virginia.
I'm afraid I'm unacquainted with that,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. KOVAR:

You're not professing surprise, are you?
I am not professing surprise that there

was a contingent arrangement between counsel and pldintiff;
I assumed that, but I was unaware of what the arrangement was
until this morning.
I think that one of the things that we should point
out here is that in attempting to argue that Rule 68 applies
only where the plaintiff prevails ignores, I think, two things:
one, the language of the rule speaks in terms of obtaining
judgment, and judgment under the rules is merely defined as a

20

decree in any order from which an appeal lies.

21

may be for someone, a judgment may be against someone, but all

22

parties to an action receive that judgment at the end of the

23

case from which judgment they may appeal if they so desire.

24

I see nothing in the rules and in the definition

judgment, which would indicate that the judgment must be for

We submit that the offer specifically
We said, as I recall, $450 which shall

include attorneys fees together with all costs accrued to
date.

We believe that we followed the wording of the rule

specifically.

We did, however, say that the one element, the

potential element of cost which a Court may include in its
44

1

discretion under 706(k), namely, attorneys fees, be a deter­

2

mined portion determined by the plaintiffs themselves, of the

3

$450 offered.

4
5

QUESTION:

So your $450 of costs, except for attor­

neys fees, were to be covered in addition to the $450?

6

MR. KOVAR:

That's correct, Your Honor.

7

And if there were a contingency arrangement in

8

effect then, and that was a one-third basis, then the plaintiff

9

would have said to plaintiff's counsel, all right, you are

10

entitled to one-third of that under our fee arrangement.
MR. KOVAR:

11

I think, going beyond the plain meaning

12

of the words, hwoever, I would like to point out, it simply

13

is absured in my opinion to say that a defendant who is totally

14

innocent has no right to the application of Rule 68.
Counsel, on several occasions, counsel for plaintiff

15
16

has made the point that what we are seeking is security in know

17

ing that our costs are going to be covered.

18

we know that we are completely innocent?

discretion.

That took away any possibility of certainty in

making an offer of judgment, one wouldn't have the faintest
idea whether it was going to prevail or not, because it would
depend upon subsequent court determination as to reasonableness
or good faith or genuineness.
If we know for a certainty that our offer will
protect us, if that offer is greater than the judgment ulti­
mately prevailed, an innocent defendant has some protection
under the rules which under plaintiff's contentions, would
not obtain.

We say, Your Honor, that the rule as we construe

11

it, does consistently apply with Rule 54(d) and does completely

fulfill the requirements of Rule 1.
