ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD BREINDEL, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MR. BREINDEL:

10

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This is a case which involves the very difficult anc.

1 1

complex interplay of our federal antitrust laws which promote

12

competition, our federal labor laws which tend to stifle

13

competition, and a labor exemption which attempts to accommo­

14

date these conflicting laws.

15

There is very little dispute over the basic opera­

16

tive facts here.

Equity is a union whose 23,000 members

17

include virtually every actor who is allowed to appear on the

18

legitimate stage in the United States.

19

atrical agents located in New York City.

20

tors who belong to Actors' Equity.

21

pendent contractors, the petitioners as agents perform ser­

22

vices and in effect work for the actors who are members of

23

Actor's Equity. All of the petitioners are regulated and

24

licensed as employment agencies under New York State law.

All are members of NATR,, the National Association of Talent

the maximum commissions which Equity agents may charge, they

The rules were last revised in

Equity and TARA's franchise rules provide that Equity

Agents may not charge commissions on a scale job,

23

they may not charge commission on a chorus job, and they may

24

not charge commission on rehearsal pay.

25

QUESTION:

I gather then that if an agent all year
4

1

long never got a job for any of his clients above scale he

2

wouldn't make anything?

3

MR. BREINDEL:

4

QUESTION:

5

6

That's correct, Your Honor.

And that isn't very likely, though, is

it?
MR. BREINDEL:

It isn't very likely because most

7

of the agents will also place actors in non-Equity jobs, but

8

there are many petitioners

9

scale jobs; scale jobs predominate over non-scale jobs.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. BREINDEL:

who place a lot of actors in

So, why will agents do that for nothing?
Well, they will do it for nothing

12

because the actors are their clients, they want to accommodate

13

these actors, they hope that maybe some day an actor will be­

14

come a star.

15
16
17

But the basic reason they do it for nothing is -

QUESTION: And then he'll be paid a good deal above
scale and he could make up to ten percent?
MR. BREINDEL:

If he stays with him.

But the basic

18

reason why agents will get actors scale jobs is they don't

19

set out to get an actor a scale job.

20

and they say, I have a terrific actor for you.

21

says, all right, but I'm only going to pay you scale.

22

the agent has now gotten the producer interested; he's going

23

to allow his client, the actor, to have the opportunity to

24

work for scale, even though the agent in his own self interest

25

tried to get the actor above scale.

QUESTION:

MR.

9

QUESTION:

Do producers ever pay agents?

BREINDEL:

By whom?

10

MR. BREINDEL:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR.

13
14

It's strictly prohibited.

By the Equity's --

Under state law or by -- or both?

BREINDEL:

Well, I believe it’s prohibited by

Equity's rules and by-laws.
QUESTION:

That's because it necessarily would fol­

15

low that if they weren't paying the agent maybe they would

16

have paid the actor?

17

MR.

BREINDEL:

Well, I think the basic reason is the re's

18

no need for producers to pay agents.

19

on the producers'

The agents are knocking

door.

Equity has collective bargaining agreements with

21

all theatrical producers who employ Equity members.

22

has collective bargaining agreements with nine separate groups

23

of producers.

24

25

which governs wages and working conditions on Broadway.

Thus it

is free to negotiate a wage above the minimum set forth in a

Mr. Breindel, before you get to that,

18

am I correct in thinking the Court of Appeals made no finding

19

as to whether this conduct was a violation of the Antitrust

20

Act?

21

MR. BREINDEL:;

22

QUESTION:

That's correct.

It simply went directly to

the labor

23

exemption without determining whether the conduct would be

24

actionable under the antitrust laws?

25

MR. BREINDEL:

That is correct.
7

Both the Court of

1

Appeals and the district court reached only one issue and

2

that was the applicability of the statutory labor exemption.

3

Under Carroll, independent contractors such as the theatrical

4

agents in this case are part of the union's labor group if

5

there is present a job or wage competition

6

economic interrelationship affecting

7

interest between the union member and the actor.

8

or

some other

a legitimate union

Prior to this Court's decision in Carroll, no court

9

had ever held that a non-union member was a part of a labor

10

group unless the non-union member was in a wage or job com­

11

petition, or performed basically the same function as the

12

union member.

13

that a non-union member who was not in a wage or job competi­

14

tion could be part of the union's labor group.

15
16
17

In Carroll, for the first time, the Court held

QUESTION:

Could you prevail without our overruling

MR. BREINDEL:

I believe so.

It's our position

that Carroll is a very unique decision which should be con­

the very diverse nature of the club date music employers.

4

These employers generally hire bands for non-commercial pur­

6

This is apparently due to

A typical club date employer is the father of the

7

bride who hires a band for his daughter's wedding.

8

viously impossible for the AFM to negotiate a collective bar­

9

gaining agreement with a group as diverse as fathers of the

It's ob­

10

bride.

Because there was no collective bargaining agreement

1 1

in Carroll, the union in order to insure that its musician

12

members got scale wages unilaterally mandated scale wages.

13

Now, in Carroll, in order to provide that agents

14

would then not book jobs for union members at less than scale,

15

they had to regulate the agents.

16

employers, the fathers of the bride, did not pay the union

17

member musicians directly.

18

Equity where Equity producers directly play Equity actors.

19

In Carroll the club date

This is unlike the situation of

In Carroll the club date employers paid the orches­

20

tra leaders who often function also as booking agents.

21

Accordingly, if the agents were not regulated by the union,

22

there was no assurance that the agents would pay scale or any

23

other wages over to the union members.

24

predicated its regulation of agents upon two very specific

25

findings of fact, and I quote them:
9

The Carroll Court

"The booking agent

1

regulations were adopted because of experience that (1) many

2

booking agents charged exorbitant fees to members, and (2)

3

booked engagements for musicians at wages which were below

4

union scale."

This is from page 113.

Here, as I previously noted, it is impossible for a

5

6

theatrical agent to book a job for an Equity member at less

7

than scale because of Equity's collective bargaining agree­

8

ment.

9

the advent of collective bargaining agreements any theatrical

Thus, Equity has not even attempted to prove that since

10

agent ever booked a job for any Equity member at less than

11

scale.

12

QUESTION:

But if you're right, it would mean that

13

the agent would be free and the actor would be free to let

14

the agent collect, say, ten percent of a scale wage as a com­

15

mission?

16

MR. BREINDEL:

17

QUESTION:

18

That's correct.

And that means that the actor is getting

less than scale?

19

MR. BREINDEL:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. BREINDEL:

I don't believe --

He's netting less than scale?
Well, he may be -- one way of looking

22

at it, he's netting less than scale, but what happens is,

23

an Equity producer pays an actor.

24

He has disposable income.

25

his doctor, he can pay his grocer, and he may even pay his

The actor cashes his check.

He can pay his landlord, he can pay

agent, but it's coming out of disposable income. Now -QUESTION:

3

cent, anyway?
MR. BREINDEL:

4

5

And he can't pay him more'than ten per­

Not under New York State law which

governs each and every petitioner in this action.
The crux of Carroll, I think, is illustrated by the

6
7

AFM's licensing agreement in Carroll.

The AFM's licensing

8

agreement in Carroll restricted booking agents from booking

9

jobs for union members at less than scale wage.

If there was

10

a collective bargaining agreement in Carroll, as we have in

11

Equity, that provision in that licensing regulation would be

12

totally useless, and unnecessary.

13

finding of fact that agents charged exorbitant commissions,

14

I first note that in Carroll the AFM permitted the booking

15

agents to charge a commission of 15 percent.

16

no evidence that any theatrical agent ever charged an actor

17

a commission of 15 percent, nor is there any evidence that a

18

theatrical agent ever charged an actor a commission in excess

19

of ten percent.

With respect to the Carrol]

Now, there's

Unlike the situation in Carroll, our agents are

20

21

all regulated and licensed as employment agencies by New York

22

State law, and as such they cannot charge more than ten per­

23

cent.

24

25

I must stress that in Carroll -QUESTION:

Is it rather they are licensed under the

general New York law of regulating kickbacks by employment
11

1

agencies ?
MR. BREINDEL:

2

No, Your Honor, there is a specific

3

law which licenses employment agencies which has very speci­

4

fic provisions dealing with the actual employment agencies.
QUESTION:

5

Well, is it a type of law such as that

6

that was originally invalidated in the '20s by the case of

7

Ribnik

v. McBride --

8

MR. BREINDEL:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Yes, it is.

And then later, of that case being later

overruled by the Olson case?
MR. BREINDEL:

It is, precisely.

In Carroll, again,

12

I must stress that the agency regulations were predicated

13

solely upon the effect that agents had upon the union member

14

scale wages.

15

Carroll court did not in any way rely on such arguments as

16

agents control access to employment, or that it's necessary

17

to regulate agents' commissions to eliminate wage competition

18

between union members.

19

justify their pervasive and exhaustive regulation of agents.

20

They say agents control access to employment, they say that

21

the prohibition of commissions on scale jobs is necessary to

22

prevent invasion of union-negotiated minimums, and they say

23

that the regulation of agents' commissions is--necessary some­

24

how to eliminate wage competition among union members.

25

Contrary to the union's arguments here, the

The unions offer three reasons to

Taken separately or collectively, these reasons do
12

1

not justify Equity's exhaustive regulation of agents.

Assum­

2

ing that it is the agents rather than the producers who con­

3

trol access to employment and recognizing that agents admit­

4

tedly have greater access to most employers than do most

5

actors, that circumstance just does not justify the existence

6

of Equity's pervasive franchising system because it's not

7

intimately related to wages, hours, or working conditions,

8

which are the subject of numerous collective bargaining agree­

9

ments.

The unions have not cited any case in which it was

10

held that a union is justified in imposing restraints of

1 1

trade upon independent business persons simply because those

12

business persons have greater access to potential employers

13

than union members.

14

Virtually every employment agency exists in business

15

because that employment agency has greater access to an

16

employer than the applicant does.

17

ment agencies who place dishwashers, who place corporate

18

executives, who place lawyers.

19

treated any differently than any applicant who gets a job from

20

an employment agency which is licensed and regulated?

21

This is true for employ­

Why should a union member be

Finally, in this connection, I would note, it's the

22

unions who control access to the employment of agents.

23

regulation of agents' commissions is not necessary to prevent

24

wage competition among union members.

25

argument made by the unions below and there was no such
13

The

Now, there was no such

1

finding by the district court.

2

Appeals here held that the union, Equity, could not eliminate

3

wage competition without regulating agents' commissions.

There was absolutely no finding of fact in the record to jus­

5

tify that conclusion.

And there

Well, what if there were proof like

that?
MR.

BREINDEL:

If there was proof like that, it

13

might support the Court of Appeals's conclusion that it's

necessary to regulate agents' commissions.

15
16

QUESTION:

You mean its conclusion that this is

within the exemption?

17

MR.

BREINDEL:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

You mean, if there was evidence that

19

there was competition among actors in the sense that one, some:

20

actors would offer agents five percent, and others eight per

cent, and.others nine percent, and others ten percent?

that the kind of competition you're talking about?

the elimination of wage competition -QUESTION:

5

Well, then, you should argue that even

6

if the Court of Appeals was correct, their conclusion doesn't

7

follow?

8

MR. BREINDEL:

That is correct, Your Honor, and it

9

doesn't follow, because the elimination of wage competition,

10

which is a traditional union labor objective, is the kind of

1 1

elimination of competition between union members involved In

12

dealing with employers, not union members competing for the

13

services of people such as actors who perform services in

14

turn for the union members.

15

sider what would happen if the franchising system was struck.

16

I submit that what would happen would be, actors would contin­

17

ue to pay agents their traditional ten percent commission per­

18

mitted by New York State law.

19

dence, the actors then wanted to compete for an agent's

20

services, they would have to compete by offering the agent a

21

commission in excess of ten percent, which is simply not

22

allowable under New York State law.

23

QUESTION:

No,

The Court of Appeals did not con­

If, despite the lack of evi­

were offering them ten percent when

24

they get paid according to scale.

25

MR. BREINDEL:

That's correct.
15

QUESTION:

1

And isn't it almost inevitable that that

2

would happen, that the agents would begin collecting commis­

3

sions when their clients were being paid scale?
MR. BREINDEL:

4

5

Your Honor, for this reason.
QUESTION:

6
7

The agents --

That's what you're complaining about,

so I assume -MR. BREINDEL:

8
9

I don't know If it's inevitable,

Well, the agents are now obtaining

scale jobs for union members without any commission whatso­

10

ever, so it's reasonable to assume that they might, if the

1 1

prohibition was struck, they might obtain scale jobs for

12

actors at the commission less than ten percent.

13

do it for nothing, it stands to reason that they can do it

14

for something less than ten percent.
QUESTION:

15

If they can

Don't we have to presume that if you pre­

16

vail some, at least some agents will start collecting some

17

commissions when their clients work for scale?

18

MR. BREINDEL:

19

QUESTION:

I think that's a fair presumption.

It seems to me it's inevitable.

Now, if

20

that happens, it seems to me there's going to be more money

flowing into agents' pockets and more competition for these

22

jobs.

MR. BREINDEL:

That's not only suggested,

QUESTION:

Well, of course, you are the plaintiff

5

in the case and presumably, unless you can point to some

6

federal law that the defendants have violated, you ought not

to prevail, and even if you win here on the labor exemption

argument, the case still would have to go back to find out

9

whether the practices were a violation of the antitrust laws.

Do you see any parallel

with the union shop structure in the labor field generally?

20

MR. BREINDEL:

Not really. The union shop structure

21

pertains to a very legitimate traditional union labor objec­

22

tive.

That is, getting and keeping more jobs for union mem­

23

bers.

The franchise agreement which, for example, fixes the

prices and commissions that agents may charge, simply goes

totally beyond that.

The imposition of franchise fees

similarly does.

Thank

16

19

I'll save the rest of my time for rebuttal.

MR. LURIE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and Members of the

Court:
Equity is a union of approximately 23,000 members.

21

They work throughout the country, not just in New York State,

22

and they are engaged, or seeking employment, throughout the

23

country in the legitimate theater. At any one time the over­

MR. LURIE:

9

It may be that it is true in some in­

stances, and I would suppose that if there were a union in a

10

similar position where the actors could only get jobs through

1 1

certain specific employment agencies, that the union would

MR. LURIE:

What they have done, if Your Honor

please, is limit commissions to ten percent.
26

That is not all

1

that we do in this situation.

2

have limited commissions to ten percent, it would seem to me

that that's no reason why the union should not utilize its

best efforts to see to it that the actors do not have to pay

In addition, if Your

Honor please, these agents operate not just in New York City,

15

although the bulk of them are in New York City and some of

16

them are in Los Angeles, but they operate throughout the

17

country, and there is no evidence in this record which indi­

' ■

Would it be legal If the agreement

1

provided that the costs of operating the hiring hall be paid

MR. LURIE:

3

Well, I think that the National Labor

4

Relations Board has often ruled in this matter that if the

5

employers contribute toward the hiring hall an amount which

6

relates, or, for example, an employee, those hiring halls

7

have to be without discrimination and any individual theoreti­

8

cally can walk in and be sent out, and he can be charged a

9

fee commensurate with the cost of operating his share of the

10
11
12
13

hiring.
QUESTION:

Well, is the $200 initiation fee and the

$60 annual fee in your view somewhat comparable to that?
MR. LURIE:

Well, if Your Honor please, absolutely.

14

I mean, the circuit court in this case, the Court of Appeals

15

in this case found that although there was no evidence in the

16

record as to the cost of the operation, that there was one

17

full-time employee and other people involved, “.and that as

18

$12,000 was the total that was paid by the agents, that it

19

clearly was commensurate with the cost of the operation.

QUESTION:

Mr. Lurie, would your theory make it

appropriate for a union to franchise acting teachers?
MR. LURIE:

No, it would not, if Your Honor please.

23

If Your Honor pleases, I had that question come up the other

24

day in a different way.

25

in New York who cast for various theaters, like the Public

and those casting agents have been giving courses, they are

5

in order to get jobs in the theaters where these people cast,

6

you have to take the course of the casting agent.

7

8

that?

And there has been a

So we can tell our members, you may not go to those

courses if you don't want to, and we will possibly discipline

11

you for going to those courses, but you have no right to take

any action against the casting directors.
QUESTION:

13
14

Would you say disciplining your members

meant imposition of a fine such as -MR. LURIE: If Your Honor please, disciplining our men

moment.

disciplinary action.

But I think you could take any usual, normal union
We could fine them, and indeed in this
30

1

case, in the case at bar, it is quite clear that when we were

2

having a dispute with the agents about the rules that we were

3

going to promulgate, we informed our members -- and by the

4

way, this is the -- there is a finding in this case by the

5

district court, not disturbed by the Court of Appeals, that

6

there is no combination between this union and the producers

7

in an effort to enforce this system.

8

10
1 1

12

There is also a finding in district court that there
is no conspiracy between TARA and the union.

And by the way,

if I may say to the Court -QUESTION:

Isn't there -- the agents who are fran­

chised don't insist that the union not deal with other agents?

13

MR. LURIE:

14

QUESTION:

The agency agreement does say, but we -Yes, so there is an agreement, whether

15

you call it a conspiracy or not, that they won't deal with

16

other agents who won't pay the franchise fee.

17

MR. LURIE:

There is an agreement, if Your Honor

18

please, but let me say, number one, that there is no evidence

19

in this case that anybody or any agent who is prepared to

20

meet and conform with the regulations cannot be licensed.

21

QUESTION:

Would you think it would be different

22

for purposes of the exemption if it were otherwise, that

23

the union simply made an agreement with a group of agents not

24

to deal with anybody else, even if they were willing to live

25

up to all the rules?
31

1

MR. LURIE:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. LURIE:

Well, let me say that -But is it any different?
Yes* I would think that that would chanj;

4

the situation.

I don't think that situation could ever come

5

about because it is the interest of Equity to have as many

6

agents as possible, and have as many members represented by

7

agents.

8

QUESTION:

But that isn't this case, is it?

9

QUESTION:

Welly that can't be true, because if

10

that were true you'd allow commissions on scale, for people

1 1

that have been on a scale.

12

MR. LURIE:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. LURIE:

Well, I suppose that it is possible.

There is certainly no evidence -QUESTION:

17
18

Because isn't it inevitably true that

when you don't allow that to happen, there are fewer agents?

15
16

Well, if Your Honor --

So it is not in your interest to maximize

the number of agents.
MR. LURIE:

19

If Your Honor please, there is no evi­

20

dence in this case that I know of that any agent has ever beer

21

denied access -- has not come into the agency business because

22

of that, or that any agent has ever dropped out because of

23

that.

24

25

QUESTION:

Well, but isn't it simple economics, as

I suggested to your learned opponent, that if you cut off one
32

1

major source of income into the industry, namely, commissions

2

on people who work at scale, and lots of people work at scale,

3

don't they?

4

and obviously there'll be fewer agents.

There'll be less money available to pay agents

MR. LURIE:

that.

15

some correlation between what you postulated, and I would say

that logic probably supports it, there is no evidence to

is that you have a perfect legal right to suppress competi­

25

MR. LURIE:

I thought your argument

say we didn't have a right to do this.

and protecting them from abuses.

Mr. Lurie, before you sit down, just as

a matter of personal curiosity, how old a union is Equity?
MR. LURIE:

4

Equity was formed around the turn of

5

the century.

It's about -- I think it was 1914 -- around --

6

that's not the turn -- around 1914, there was a group called

7

the White Rats who organized the union.

actors who -- actors had been terribly depressed.

Very well.

the situation faced by all of the theatrical unions is roughly

the same.

in which there are many more competitors for jobs than there

7

are jobs, and where the traditional pattern is that there is

8

an intermediary between the purchaser of labor and those peo­

9

ple who are offering themselves for employment.

It is a situation in which work is intermittent,

QUESTION:

The Court in that instance ad­

Mr. Gold, what about the fact in Carroll

that the orchestra leaders there actually played as musicians

MR. GOLD:

14

Do you regard that as a distinction of

For the purpose here we think it is irre­

15

levant because Carroll concerned many issues and one issue

16

was the extent to which you could, to which the union could

17

regulate the orchestra leaders.

18

to which you could regulate booking agents and that booking

4

What about the emphasis that your brother

5

Breindel puts on the collective bargaining agreement between

6

the producers and Equity?

7

in Carroll.
MR. GOLD:

8
9

We had nothing like that, of course ,

That point is treated in the brief of the

union, and the record in the Carroll case shows that there

10

were collective agreements in the steady engagement field

1 1

in Carroll, and that was covered by musicians' booking agents'

12

rules just as the rest of the engagements were covered.

13

QUESTION:

And Carroll made no distinction?

14

MR. GOLD:

And Carroll made absolutely no distinc­

15

tion.

16

We believe that every one of the efforts that the petitioners

17

make to distinguish Carroll fail.

This was the point that was at issue in this case.

18

QUESTION:

What about the fee?

19

MR. GOLD:

Well, my view on the fee is that if the

20

rest of the system were in any way suspect that might not

21

stand, but if we are correct that the whole point and purpose

22

of the system is employee protective, we certainly believe

23

that the fee which barely covers the cost of the system would

24

be lawful.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Rehnquist --

5

QUESTION:

That certainly wasn't covered by Carroll.

6

MR. GOLD: No, I would agree entirely. But the question

7

was raised as to whether in a hiring hall situation the

8

employer pays. The norm is that the employer pays.
QUESTION:

9

10

When you say, if this system were sus­

pect, the presence of the fee might render it -MR. GOLD:

11

No, no, Your Honor, I didn't mean to

12

say that.

13

otherwise no good, and I was trying to defend the charging of

14

the fee for a system which was otherwise not in the labor

15

exemption, I don't think I could succeed on that point stand­

16

ing alone.

17

and purpose of the system isn't proper under Carroll and

18

within the labor exemption, I don't believe that the fact that

19

the cost of the system is shared by the union and the employer

20

invalidates the system or even invalidates that one provision

21

any more than I believe that a perfectly lawful hiring hall

22

could possibly be invalidated under the long-standing practice

23

that it's the employer who pays the cost of the hall either

24

in whole or in part.

25

What I meant to say was that if the system were

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, I'm just curious.

Here we

12

anybody who will, but we just won't deal with anybody who

13

won't -- who

to -- we'll deal with them if they have a satisfactory scale.

as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in Hutcheson and as Mr. Justic e

3

Powell said in Connell, the basic task here is harmonizing

4

these two different systems,

5

together in a way that makes sense, and the basic point that

6

we think has emerged from all of that jurisprudence is that

7

if the union is regulating the matter of direct and immediate

8

concern and its employees' job market, that is within the

9

labor exemption, obviously.
QUESTION:

10

reading these series of laws

Well, do you say the same, Mr. Gold, if

11

access was limited here, if only a selected group of agents

were franchised?
MR. GOLD:

determine what the meaning of the labor exemption is.

not absolutely plain that the labor exemption permits unions

to do absolutely anything.

we would possibly

The point though is that if we are operating to
42

1

advance a direct and immediate interest, it appears to us

2

that the fact that there is an effect on a business market

3

cannot be sufficient to invalidate our system because if

4

that's true, then there's nothing left of Congress's determi­

5

nation that the labor market can be regulated in this way.

6

There'll always be an effect.

7

QUESTION:

The Jewel Tea --

Mr. Gold, before you sit down, you touche d

8

upon this distinction between focusing on the labor market

9

and on the other hand, on the product market.

Has this

10

Court ever in so many words up to this point made that dis­

1 1

tinction in focus?

12

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

I can think of at least two occa­

13

sions on which it's been made, one of which was alluded to

14

from the bench.

15

has been the theme on which I've been addressing variations.

16

I also --

17

Mr. Justice White's opinion in Jewel Tea

QUESTION:

Does his opinion really make that dis­

18

tinction?

19

right, within the exemption, if it's the least restrictive

20

possibility, as I read it.

21

He said even in the product market it's still all

MR. GOLD:

I read his opinion to say, if the issue

22

is of direct and immediate union concern, and there the

23

direct and immediate union labor market concern was the desire

24

of those employees not to work at night; the fact that there

25

is also an effect on the product market is not sufficient.
43

1

And then the contrast is if you regulate the product market

2

directly with the hope that you will get some benefit even­

3

tually, and the example would be that given in Pennington,

4

where the union hoped to regulate the product market in terms

5

of who would enter and who would not in the hope that even­

6

tually it could get higher wages.
The example I just gave is an instance, and Allen

7

8

Bradley would be another, where the union is outside the

9

labor exemption.

We believe the test for determining when

10

it's inside the labor exemption is basically that I've just ar

1 1

ticulated, that the fact that there's a consequential effect or at

12

effect on the product market is not enough to defeat the exemption.

13

QUESTION:

14

QUESTION: -- there's recent academic commentary to

this effect that seems to be emerging.

tary doesn't do the opinions justice, necessarily --

that that's'important. After all, the exemption --

The question, I guess, then, is whether

MR. GOLD:

Well, you're going to have, in effect --

4

we make an argument, it's point two of our amicus brief,

5

that an agent because he deals in the services of employees

6

doesn't really have a product market in the classic sense.

7

But as Jewel Tea shows, you can regulate in the labor market

8

and that has an effect on the product market as well; they

9

intersect and we think the exemption, our labor exemption

10

does not require that we show that there's no effect on the

11

product market, because if we had to show that we really

12

have to defend ourselves on the merits against the antitrust

claim.

there's no restraint on trade.
