MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Turner, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY RICHARD W. TURNER

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. TURNER:

7

8

We'll hear arguments next

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it

please the Court:
This is a Longshoremen’s ’and Harbor Workers' Act

9

10

case involving a rather narrow issue but one that is important

1 1

in that there is a complete division of authority between two

12

circuits on exactly the same narrow issue.

13

If I may for a moment try to explain the issue in,

14

I think, simple language, the question is, does the language

15

of the statute have its plain meaning or does the language

16

need interpretation?

17

in Sections 8(c)(1) through -(19), are they exhaustive or are

18

they only a minimum schedule?

19

injured in the course of employment and having sustained a

20
21

22
23
24

25

Do the schedules that are promulgated

Is a workman who is admittedly

permanent partial disability according to the schedule, is he
limited to what the schedule says?

Or if he can prove loss of

earnings beyond that point, can he then have more compensation
awarded him?

I think that is the issue before the Court; that

is the point on which the two circuits have completely dis­
agreed .
4

1

Th'fe

5th Circuit in the case of Williams vs . Donovan

2

in 1966 in a per curiam opinion one paragraph long agreed com­

3

pletely with the district court that the statute meant exactly

4

what it said and that no court, no deputy commissioner, had a

5

right to give any more than the schedules called for.

6

When we now come to the United States Court of

7

Appeals for the District of Columbia, they decided the oppo­

8

site of that.

9

meaningless unless the man's injury and damage is less than or

They decided that in effect the schedule is

10

equal to the schedule, that if he can show more than that, ther

1 1

this is one of the so-called other cases, 8(c)(21) of the Act.

12

And we submit that this is not an "other" case.

13

clearly one of scheduled injury.

14

the Act, the plain language of the Act, compel a finding that

15

those schedules are exhaustive and not minimal.

QUESTION:

The case is

We think that the history of

Mr. Turner, did the Court of Appeals in

this case in your view hold that the schedule provided a
minimum that was payable in any event?
MR. TURNER:

I think so, sir.

They certainly say

that any man who can prove more loss of earnings than the
schedule, calls for is. Entitled to claim it and it must be paid.
QUESTION:

But, in any event, he's -- if he can

prove nothing at all except theextent of his permanent
partial and that it's covered by the schedule, he gets what
the schedule gives?

8

10

He is entitled to a

decision.

3

5

Absolutely, sir.

Oh, yes.
Because two

arguments are made here, as

you know, by your opponents.
MR. TURNER:

Yes.

They say -- one of them says the

Government -QUESTION:

One of them says there's a minimum, the

other says it's an alternative.
MR. TURNER:
it's a minimal.

That's right, sir.

The other one says

We say that it is neither an alternative nor

is it a minimal schedule.
QUESTION:
MR. TURNER
QUESTION:

But it's exclusive; that's your point.
Sir?
Your point is that it's exclusive.

20

MR. TURNER

Yes, sir.

21

QUESTION:

And the Court of Appeals, you think, said

22

that the schedule provided a minimum?
23

MR. TURNER:

That's correct, sir.

24

QUESTION:

That will go in any event.

25

6

1

MR. TURNER:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. TURNER:

4

They say that —
That's what I thought.
-- in any event, if the man can prove

more, he can obtain more.

5

QUESTION:

But he always gets the scheduled payment?

6

MR. TURNER:

He always must get the scheduled.

This

7

statute is 50 years old and there never has been any deviation

8

from that point of view, that, no matter how little the man

9

was injured, he was entitled to the full amount that the sched­

10

ule called for.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. TURNER:

13
14

15

16

17
18
19

20
21

Even though he had no loss of earnings?
Even though he had no loss of earnings.

Let's say that he completely lost a finger and the doctor
bandaged it up and sent him back to work two days later, he
still would get the entire amount called for by the schedules.
But he could not, under the old administrative procedures whict
were done by deputy commissioners and finally United States
Court of Appeals, which was the system then, he could not get
more than that.

As a matter of fact, all of these cases of

so-called schedule

injuries are normally completely disposed

of at a very informal level.

Such as the case of this one

where a man has his operating surgeon say that he had a five
22

percent disability, another examining physician says he has
23

20 percent disability, but only of the leg; there was no other
24

part of the body involved, there was no other attempt to give
25

7

1

any other rating.

2

simply a claims examiner at the informal level.

3

examiner would have looked at it and said, your doctor says

4

five, his doctor says 20, I think you should have 15.

5

neither side would be completely satisfied but both of them

6

would go away and the case would be done and forever gone.

Normally, this man would have gone before
The claims

And

If this Act, if this case is now affirmed here by

7

8

this Court, then that will no longer happen, because the claims

9

examiner, he hears it informally, , will

have

no

schedule with

10

which to work.

1 1

this man do in the future, what has he done in the past?
QUESTION:

12

13
14

He will have to try to find out how much can

You mean the schedule will be the starting

point ?
MR. TURNER:

Yes, sir, only the starting point.

15

Because, obviously, everyone is going to make his claim for as

16

much as he can; no one goes in and says, I want just the

17

minimum, but whatever I can get.

19

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Turner, it isn't

simply

that it will

be the starting point, because even under the Court of Appeals
view would he not have to choose between the schedule and this
alternative approach?
MR. TURNER:

That's my understanding, sir, that you

would not have to choose.
QUESTION:

And if it happened and it's the case you

supposed earlier, if he lost a finger but he kept the same
8

1

job, then he'd use the schedule, wouldn't he?

2

MR. TURNER:

3

QUESTION:

4

That's correct, sir.
And he wouldn't even try the other ap­

proach ?
MR. TURNER:

5

Then he wouldn't even try, but to use

6

a more extreme case -- use this one, in which the man has had

7

this minor injury to the leg, a minor operation.

8

go back to playing football or other athletic events every

9

day in a short time after such an injury.

Ball players

This man decided

10

that he couldn't, or he wouldn't, do all of the work that he

1 1

had to do in his job.

12

He was a cable splicer

13

power company.

14

climbs in and out of manholes, he climbs ladders.

15

17

And his job was admittedly a heavy one.

He does heavy work.

But he

decided that he couldn't do all of this, so for that reason,
because he decided that he couldn't do it, then the company
could not allow him to be promoted along with the other men
who were doing all of their job.

They could not allow him to

work overtime, which pays time-and-a-half and double time on
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.
that.

They simply couldn't allow

So because of that fact, the lack of one or two regular

promotions that other men got, the lack of working overtime,
this man showed an actual loss of earnings, compared to other
men similarly situated.
Now, the administrative law judge who heard this case

25

9

1

is bound by decisions of the Benefits Review Board.

2

quently he decided that because of this loss of earnings he

3

would decide it, not under the schedule of losses, or

4

8 (c) ( 2 ),(19) , but under 8(c) (.21) which is the other cases provi­

5

sion of the Act.

6

this case should then be decided under, that point, and the

7

man got an award for permanent partial disability based not on

8

his actual wages at the time of injury, as 8(c)(2),(19) says,

9

but under his so-called work -- his loss of earning

And he decided that this man then should,

10

under 8(c)(21).

QUESTION:

It provides

What, as a practical matter, is the dif­

ference in the amount of the award?
HR. TURNER:

Well, the amount to this man, sir,

could amount to a hundred and some thousand dollars.
QUESTION:
MR. TURNER:

And under the schedule?
And under the schedule at the full 20

percent it would be some $ 12,000-$13,000.

There is a great

deal of difference.
This case has particular importance, by the way, to
the District of Columbia itself, I think.

The District of

Columbia -- I suppose this Court can take judicial notice that
the newspapers are full of its efforts to write its own
workmen's compensation act, businesses being squeezed by

24

the onerous burden of the Longshore Act are simply moving out
25

10

of the District of Columbia.

suburban districts.

That is correct, sir.

They have not.

As a matter of fact, I don't believe they have faced the exact
question.
QUESTION: Well, there aren't -- in typical state

workmen's compensation statutes, schedules of the kind involvec

-- there is a trend in that way.

Well, sir, Professor Larson in his

But that has nothing to do with the issue

here -MR. TURNER:

It has nothing to do.

The issue here

is a congresional statute and the state cases.
QUESTION:
MR. TURNER:

And you do have a schedule here?
Yes, sir.

QUESTION: And the trend in the state cases is
25

11

1

initiative by the legislature abolishing the schedule.

2

MR. TURNER:

I would like to call the Court's atten­

3

tion to the fact that the New York Legislature in 1970 modified

4

their Act to give it just this exact change.

5

court, prior to that time, had followed the schedules very

6

strictly.

7

scheduled losses and the "other cases."

8

New York Legislature felt it was time to make this change, the

9

Legislature did it and not the courts.

They

The New York

had maintained this dichotomy between the
But in 1972 when the

And this, of course, is our position here that if

10
1 1

there is to be a change in this Act, then the Congress should

12

do it and not the Benefits Review Board, which was constituted

13

in 1972 by an amendment to this Act.
QUESTION:

14

15

Employees Compensation Act?

16

MR. TURNER:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Congress has don^ this with the Federal

Yes, sir.
But it hasn't done it with the longshore­

men?
MR. TURNER:

That's correct, sir.

The Congress

20

amended the Federal Employees Compensation Act in 1949, I be­

21

lieve, so that when an employee had a serious loss of arm,

22

leg, and so forth, then he could after he had exhausted the

23

schedule come in and show that fact.

24

25

QUESTION:

But, although that's been on the books a

long time -12

1

HR. TURNER:

2

QUESTION:

1949 , sir.
The Congress has never done anything to

3

the Longshoremen's Act although the Longshoremen's Act has

4

been modified?
MR. TURNER:

5

That's correct, on other respects.

6

On five different occasions the Longshore Act has been amended.

7

Now, certainly the Congress knew not only that they had amendec

8
9

10

1 1

12

the Act in 1949 but they again amended it in 19-- -- I forget
the exact date, it may be 1970 that the Federal Employees
Compensation Act was again amended to more liberalize the
alternative position, to go forward with a showing of a
greater loss.

QUESTION:

13
14

Mr. Turner, how long have private employer s

in the District been subject to the Longshore Act?
MR. TURNER:

15

16

It was amended twice.

1936, I believe.

It's been a long,

long time.
QUESTION:

It seems a little incongruous.

QUESTION:

But it's just a statute?

17

18

MR. TURNER:

Sir?

19

QUESTION:

It's just a statute?

20

MR. TURNER:

Yes, sir, it was the Congress simply

21

adopted the Longshore Act to be the Workers'

Compensation

22

Act for the District of Columbia.
23

QUESTION:

Even though there isn't a longshoreman

24

or a boat handler -25

13

MR. TURNER:

1

That's right, sir.

This Act was made

2

for longshoremen and not for piano players or something here

3

in the District of Columbia.

4

because it is applicable to all employers in the District of

5

Columbia.

But those are all covered now

The Benefits Review Board when they affirmed the

6
7

opinion of the administrative law judge in this case pulled

8

themselves up by their own bootstraps by citing two of their

9

own opinions.

They first had decided a case of Mason against

10

Old Dominion Stevedoring Corporation, which is found at

11

1 B.R.B.S. 357.

12
13
14

15

could no longer work as a longshoreman.

18
19

20

In that case an

administrative law judge decided that despite the fact that he
had a 25 percent disability of the hand, that he had a 75
percent loss of earning capacity and gave it to him.
The Board in that case approved the opinion and order

16
17

And Mason was a man who injured his hand and

of the administrative law judge and said that they were not
constrained to follow Williams v. Donovan, which provided a
maximum recovery where the injury could be shown to extend
beyond that period.
Now, to support their decision in the Mason case,

21

the Board cited American Mutual Insurance Company against
22

Jones.

Now, that is a District of Columbia case involving,

23

again, an injury to a man's hand.

But the man was elderly,

24

he was uneducated, he was untrainable, and it had nothing to
25

14

1

do with the schedules, it was decided under Section 8(a) of

2

the Act, which defines permanent, total disabiity.

3

nothing to do with the schedules.

4

case as their authority for disapproving of Williams v.

5

Donovan, which was exactly on all fours.

It had

But they cited the Jones

The other case that the Board cited of their own

6
7

making was Longo v. Universal Terminal and Storing Corporation.

8

Now, that was a hearing loss case in which a longshoreman lost

9

the hearing in one of his ears.

But because of that he was

10

unable to go back to longshoring work.

1 1

with an uneducated man who could do nothing else and the

12

stevedoring company had not provided him with any other job,

13

nor had it shown that any other job was available.

14

fore the administrative law judge decided that he was per­

15

manently, totally disabled and properly so.

16

to do with the schedule despite the fact that he had a sched­

17

uled loss.

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

Again we were dealing

And there­

And it has nothing

He was permanently, totally disabled.

He couldn't

work; he didn't have a job.
Now, those two cases, as I say, were the authority
for the ALJ in my case and the Board itself in my case decid­
ing that the schedule was not applicable but that the man coulc
obtain more compensation than called for by the schedules.
The schedules, of course, called for a definite
payment based on the weekly wage being earned at the time of
the injury, and for a definite period.

25

15

1

The Longshore Act since its adoption in 1927 has been

2

amended on several occasions, as before mentioned.

3

"other case" provision in it has never been changed.

4

has always been an "other case" provision.

5

Congress was aware of all of the changes.

6

But the
There

And certainly

Now, if -- no question by anyone has been raised

7

that it is within the power of Congress to promulgate such a

8

statutory scheme for the compensation of workers.

9

has not been challenged since the case of Flamm v. Hughes,

10

That power

which is 329 F2d 378, a 2nd Circuit case in 1964.

1 1

The recent case of Bloomer against Liberty Mutual

12

decided by this present Court on March 3, 1980, was decided

13

on a different issue, but the Court there held, if I under­

14

stand it correct, that the Act means what it plainly says.

15

Now, although the Act provides for some elections or options

16

for both worker and employer, nowhere does the Act provide

17

that a person may or may not take under the schedule.

to, be admitted back to the administrative law judge for a

has sustained.

2

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Mr. Turner, before you sit down, just

3

because I didn't quite follow you, the Longo case, I under­

4

stand, was that they held a total disability and therefore

5

that really isn't in point?
MR. TURNER:

7

QUESTION:

9

MR. TURNER:

11

12

The Longo case

was - -

8

10

That's correct,, sir.

QUDSTION:

That's hearing loss.
-- a hearing loss case.
But what about Mason?

If Mason in your

view was incorrectly decided, is that right?
MR. TURNER:

That's correct, sir.

It was incor­

13

rectly decided because the man had a 25 percent disability of

14

the hand, but the administrative law judge decided that he

15

had 75 percent disability.

16

decided that that administrative law judge was correct and

17

that they were

18

which is of course a case on all fours with ours here before

19

this Court.

20

And the Board, the Appellate Board,

not constrained to follow Williams v. Donovan,

QUESTION:

And they allowed relief under the

all-other-cases language?
QUESTION:

All-other-cases language.

MR. TURNER:

Well, they didn't say that.

They said

they relied on the case of American Mutual Insurance Company
against Jones, which of course was again a total permanent
17

1

disability and had no bearing on the-schedule.

HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT BY MRS. ELINOR H. STILLMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT

4

MRS. STILLMAN:

5

6
7

Mrs. Stillman.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The essential purpose of the Longshoremen's and

8

Harbor Workers' Compensation Act is to compensate employees

9

for disability, that is to say, loss of wage-earning capacity.

10

Petitioner is contending in this case that this statute should

1 1

be construed to deny an employee who has suffered a substantial

12

disability -- that is to say, a substantial loss of wage­

13

earning capacity -- deny him the right to recover compensation

14

in proportion to that actual loss.

Construction urged by Petitioner would also lead to
a number of totally irrational results, most notably the right
of an employee judged to have suffered temporary partial
disability to recover more than a employee judged to have suf­
fered permanent partial disability.
Because the construction that Petitioner is urging
in this case is thus counter to the essential and central
purpose of the Act and would lead to results which cannot
readily be imputed to Congress, we say, as this Court said in

23

the case of Baltimore and Philadelphia Steamboat Company v.
24

Norton, nothing less than compelling language would justify
25

18

1

such a construction of the Act, and we don't think that that

2

compelling language is present in this case.
QUESTION:

4

You make a distinction between compelling

language and plain language?
MRS. STILLMAN:

We don't think, we don't concede

that the plain language compels the result that Petitioner is

Is

there a distinction between compelling language and plain

MRS. STILLMAN:

I would concede that perhaps the
We would say that neither is present

in this case.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Stillman, how do you explain away

the two words in (21), "other cases"?
MRS.

STILLMAN:

We would say that other cases mean

simply cases not determined under the schedule, and we would
say that if Congress had intended to enact a statute with
provisions that were contrary to its central purpose of com­
pensating employees for disability, what they would have used

20

was some term such as "cases arising from injuries other than
21

those listed on the schedule," or some statement to the effect
22

that "this shall be exclusive of the schedule."

There.'s

23

nothing there and we just think that this is putting too much
24

pressure on the words, "other cases."

Certainly this individual who

his is not an "other case."
MRS. STILLMAN:

7

Your Honor, we would concede that

8

there are several permissible readings of the term "other

9

cases" here, and we think in choosing between those permissi­

10

ble reasons you should choose the reading that is consonant

1 1

with the purposes of the statute and we believe that that's our

12

reading of "other cases."
I think perhaps one thing I should do here at the

13
14

outset is to explain to the Court that there is not an incon­

15

sistency between the approach, the way in which we've briefed

16

this issue, and the way in which Respondent Mr. Cross has

17

briefed it.
QUESTION:

Your Honor, we would — let me ex­

We believe that there is an election here,

But this is the way we understand the Act to

The employee who suffers an injury that is listed on
20

1

the schedules is permitted if he wishes to simply rest on the

2

schedule.

That is, not to seek to prove any loss of wage

earnings.

He can simply rest on the schedule, show his im­

pairment, and receive a benefit for that as provided on the

5

schedule.

We believe that if an employee understands that he
is going to have disability, that is, loss of wage-earning
capacity in excess of what is on the schedule, he may then
prove that under 8(c)(21).
QUESTION:

So there is no inconsistency between

your positions?
MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

There's no inconsistency, Your Honor.

Now, each of you says that the schedule

is a minimum, recoverable in any event without any proof what­
soever of loss of earnings?
MRS. STILLMAN:

That's correct, but I want to explain

16

one further thing in the way this would operate because this

and an "other case"?

he can always get the schedule.

MRS. STILLMAN:

He can but he hasn't sought to

It is a scheduled

MRS. STILLMAN:

he could always get the minimum.

Act was passed in 1927, amended in '49.

He asked you, how

many years was it construed the other way?
MRS. STILLMAN:

Well, if -- actually, until

Williams v. Donovan, we know of no situation in which the case
even arose, so it can't be said to have been construed at all
before then.

And, in Williams v. Donovan, it looks to us,

reading the briefs -- and we'd be willing to -- well, I'd
submit to the Court if the Court wished — that the only
25

1

question raised to the 5th Circuit was the man was claiming

2

permanent total.

3

we approve the reasoning of the' District Court, and so the

4

decision in that sense can be read.

Now, the 5th Circuit said in broad language,

The Sokolowski case tells us two things.

It was

decided in 1933, six years after the passage of the Longshore­

3

men's Act.

4

Appeal interpreted other cases in the way the Petitioner is

5

urging that it be interpreted here.

6

1930 the New York Industrial Board, because they were over­

7

turning an award of the New York Industrial Board, interpreted

8

it our way.

9

the Chairman of the Board at that time was Frances Perkins,

It tells us that in 1933 the New York Court of

statute.

12

Now, unfortunately, the legislative history of the

13

statute -- we combed it and couldn't find anything that bears

14

directly on this point, so we don't know whether she ever gave

15

them her view or whether her view in 1927 was identical to her
view in 1930.

commissioners took during these years if they faced precisely

this case.

But even if they had taken -- I should in all can­

10

dor admit that there's a footnote in the Government's brief in

1 1

Williams v. Donovan which suggests -- it's sort of an aside --

that they might have taken Petitioner's position here but that

MRS. STILLMAN:

Yes.

Well, what's ambiguous about that?
Excuse me?

What's ambiguous about that?
Well, I would say as to that, we

8

don't have any official ruling from the agency that we know

9

of during that time, and even if the agency, what constituted

10

that agency had taken a different view, we would say this,

1 1

that an agency is not disqualified from changing its mind.

12

And if it does, the Court is reviewing the decision that's

13

before it and it still does not construe the statute de novo,

14

it still construes the statute in the light of the agency's

15

understanding of that statute.
Now, we have consistent rulings of the Benefits

16

17

Review Board since 1975 that this is the way it should be con­

18

strued, and they're the ones that have directly faced this

19

situation.

20
21

22
23
24

25

And they have good reasons for that.

The irra­

tional result that I've mentioned; also, their -- in terms of
a policy argument, I'll put here, because I think this is an
answer to their contention that this would add to litigation
under the Act -- if a man's facing substantial loss of wage­
earning capacity with a schedule injury, he is faced with the
gross undercompensation that would result in this case.

Mr. Cross faces a loss.

he would be entitled to either $3,000 if his disability is

If a man is faced with that he's not going to have

12

that you might get in permitting this kind of litigation

13

under 8(c)(21).
QUESTION:

It's going to be litiga­

Mrs. Stillman, is this a two-way street?

15

For instance, if under Subsection (7) or Subsection (6) a per­

16

son lost a thumb and got this schedule compensation of 75

17

weeks,

18

weeks and say, look, this man is being overcompensated?

19

could the employer come back in at the end of 40

MRS. STILLMAN:

No.

The employer may not do that.

20

There does not have to be any showing of rates or any capacity

21

under the statute.

22
23
24

25

But that's not unfair because the schedule

also compensates impairment.

The man is going to have a

lifelong injury and it's not unfair that he be compensated for
that as well as any loss of wage-earning capacity.
He's also being denied any tort suit or negligence
31

1

suit he might have against the employer, because this is our

2

first remedy.

3

QUESTION:

Then "in other cases," just in your read­

4

ing, simply means in any case in which the employee chooses

5

to go outside the schedule?
MRS. STILLMAN:

6

Yes.

--

For the reasons that I

have stated we think the Benefits Review Board correctly inter­

preted the Act here and therefore we think that the decision

25

Very.well, Mrs. Stillman.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
I think that a couple of the comments made by
counsel should be addressed specifically.
Firstly, the counsel for Pepco raises the specter of
athletes who are operated on in the same manner in which
Mr. Cross was operated on and then return to work.
playing football.

That is,

And Mr. Turner goes on to say that this

man decided he could not do it.
The facts of the case are clear and a reading of the
32

1

transcript will show that it was the doctors who prohibited

2

Mr. Cross from returning to his full duties.

3

fact, not his doctors but Pepco's doctors, Pepco's in-house

4

doctors and Pepco's consulting doctors.

5

should not be overlooked.
Mr. Turner also mentions

13

As a matter of

And it's a point that

the fact, rather:than

speculate with respect to the damages that Mr. Cross might have
suffered as a result of the injury to his knee, that his exclu­
sive remedy should be under the schedule.

Rather than specu­

late as to the damages, I think a review of Petitioner's brief
at page 48a will demonstrate clearly that an in-depth analysis
was conducted by the administrative law judge in order to de­
termine what Mr. Cross's actual wage-earning losses were.
What the administrative law judge did was to review

14

Mr. Cross's wages for three full years prior to his injury and
15
16

for the year following his injury.
QUESTION:

Well, that's what a jury is expected to

17

do, I suppose, in a personal injury suit.

But this is a

18

Compensation Act where you have a schedule of disabilities.
19

MR. SCHERR:

Your Honor, we never claimed under the

20

schedule.

When I say "we," I have represented Mr. Cross since

21

he first came in my office and we filed this claim.
22

We never claimed that his loss was the removal of
23

the medial meniscus of his left knee, we never claimed that
24

the fact that he limped was his problem.
25

33

We claimed that he

1

sustained a loss of over $6,000 per year in wages.

2

his loss.

3

and in oral argument -- that Mr. Cross wants over $130,000.

4

That's not speculation.

5

not because he's greedy or venal, but because his actual loss,

6

not projected, but actual loss based u.pon what he earned before

7

and what

Now, Mr. Turner tells us that -- both in his brief

That's true.

He wants over $130,000,

he can earn now, is in excess of $200,000 a year.
QUESTION:

8

That’s

But hasn't this been true for a long time

9

under workmen's compensation acts for 50, 75 years, that the

10

schedule awards sometimes are higher and sometimes are lower

that what they might get from a jury.
MR. SCHERR:

12

14

15

16

decidewhat the federal statute

19

compensate the injury.

Our position is clear.

The injury is, in this case as in all

cases, where there's a loss of earnings, the loss of earnings.
A review of the legislative history shows us at
least that H.E. 21 was in the original statute and then it was
amended before it was enacted to include the schedule.
Our position is that Congress meant to say that

20

21

means.

The federal statute, the purpose of the federal statute is to

17

18

It's for this Court, Your Honor, to

where there is a wage-earning loss, the employee can claim
for that wage-earning loss, because that, after all, is his

22

injury.

Where there's no wage-earning loss but a correspond­

23

ing anatomical loss, then the employer get to share in that
24

loss.

That is, I as an attorney, if I as an employee of a

25

while I was on the job, I can continue earning a living

$10,000 a year. Under Pepco's reading of the statute the em­

1 1

ployee get 100 percent schedule disability for the loss of a

12

hand and nothing to reflect what are actual wage-earning losses

13

Another anomaly that comes up under the Pepco's

14

reading of the statute is, take Terry Cross.

15

circumstances, don't change a fact except that rather than

16

the injury to his right knee which caused Pepco's doctors to

17

deny him his work, his injury was to his back, a foot and a

18

half higher up and then a little bit around to the right.

25

Exactly the same

Under those circumstances there would be no question that he
would be entitled to two-thirds the difference under what
Pepco would like to believe is the only reason to have the
"other cases" provision in the statute.
That can't be true.

It can't be that if Terry Cross

loses $6,000 a year because of his knee, he gets a total of
$3,000 as Mr. Turner advocated at the administrative hearing
35

1

below was that if Terry Cross had the exact same wage-earning

2

loss because of an injury to his back, he gets $130,000 for

3

the rest of his life.
And it should be noted again that the $130,000

4

5

that Terry Cross has been awarded, and which award has been

6

affirmed, is not a windfall for Mr. Cross.

7

addition to what he otherwise would have made.

8

compensates him to the extent of two-thirds the difference

9

of what he would have made had he not been injured.

This is not in
This merely

Further, it is our position that the congressional

10
11

intent is clear from a reading of the entire Section (8), and

12

that is with respect to permanent total disability, temporary

13

partial disability, and temporary total disability, as well as

14

permanent partial disability, in every case Congress has seen

15

fit to award the employee a percentage of the difference of his

16

actual loss.

17

Sections 8(c)(1) through -(19).
And as we submit, it is an afterthought of Congress

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

The only exception is the so-called schedule,

that even if there is no actual wageearning loss, that an
employee should receive some compensation for his anatomical
losses with whatever suffering is occasioned by that anatomical
loss.

And it is not meant to be exclusive, it is meant to be

a minimum, it is meant to be one arm of an alternative
that the employee can take either the schedule loss as a
minimum or alternatively he can take under the unscheduled

25

loss, if he can in fact prove as Mr. Cross can and has proven
36

1

in this case that his actual earning loss is far greater than

2

what he would receive under the schedule loss provisions.

QUESTION:

But if he attempts to prove a case of

4

a leg's loss exceeding the scheduled amount and fails to prove

5

it, he just fails to prove it.

MR. SCHERR:

He's in any event is going to

That's correct, Your Honor.

That is

correct.
QUESTION:

So you're suggesting that any case like

10

this is at least potentially two kinds of cases.

1 1

an anatomical loss, certainly, within the schedule and if

12

there had been wage losses, it's a wage loss case too.

13

MR. SCHERR:

Yes, sir.

One, it's

I think the Court should

14

note that in the eight years since the minimums were removed

15

in 1972, only five cases have been decided by the Benefits

QUESTION:

MR.SCHERR:

Yes, sir, five cases, the ones that I

named.

QUESTION:

We don't know how many thousands of cases

there have been decided by whoever those cases are appealed

conference to an administrative law judge in which case there's

Is it more likely that there are only

five lawyers who thought of this argument?

1

MR. SCHERR:

I thank you for the compliment, Your

2

Honor, but I think that the plain reading of the entire statute

3

would make it clear that the purpose of the statute is to

4

compensate employees for actual loss of wages and not for the

5

Benefits Review Board or the administrative law judges to

6

slavishly follow a schedule and say, a. knee - $3,000, despite

the fact that your actual wage-earning loss which loss occurs

And I believe that the Longshoremen and

types of injuries to allow him to continue to work, not have
to claim permanent and total disability, have the employer
supplement the difference between what he was earning before
the injury and after the injury by two-thirds, and be consonant
with the intent of Congress and the meaning of the Act.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Turner?
MR. TURNER:

If I may, Your Honor, please?

ORAL ARGUMENT BY RICHARD W. TURNER
24

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL
25

40

1

MR. TURNER:

Let me first of all call the Court's

2

attention to at least one of the cases mentioned by Mr. Scherr,

3

the case of Collins against Todd Shipyards Corporation, in

4

which the Board itself shows a very divided opinion.

5

Chief Judge Smith of the Board has written a bitter dissent in

6

that case, so that certainly in my humble judgment no court

7

need bow to the expertise of the administrative law judges in

8

a case such as this, which is a pure question of law.

9

The

Now, they couldn't tell you how many cases or how

10

cases were decided prior to this but my own experience tells me

1 1

that thousands and thousands of cases were decided by deputy

12

commissioners when there was a dispute at the informal con­

13

ference level; thousands of them were decided and decided under

14

the schedules.

15

16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

There was never any question.

When it got to

the district, United States District Court, the case was
Williams v. Donovan and the United States District Court
decided as a matter of law that the schedules were appropriate
and were exclusive.

They were mutually exclusive, the sched­

ules and the so-called "other" cases department.
The schedules treat all persons the same; no matter
who he is or how much he earns the schedules are complete in
and of themselves, but it is obvious that they could not take
into effect every possible injury that a man might suffer
or a woman might suffer.

I don't know whether there are women

longshoremen or not.
25

41

1

It's not possible.

They have heart attack cases,

2

they have brain injury cases.

It is just simply impossible.

3

There must be a schedule to allow the employer to have a

4

definite liability and to have the employee obtain prompt and

5

certain compensation.

6

Thank you.
