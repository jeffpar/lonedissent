MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

in Allstate Insurance Company against Lavinia Hague.

Mr. Nolan, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK M. NOLAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. NOLAN:

11

My name is Mark Nolan.

I represent Allstate Insur­

ance Company who appears today as Petitioner on writ of certio­
rari to the Minnesota Supreme Court.
The judicial trail that leads us here today began when

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Mr. Ralph Hague -- it began when that representative began a

QUESTION:

A Minnesota representative?

16

MR. NOLAN:

Pardon?

17

QUESTION:

A Minnesota representative?

18

MR. NOLAN:

A Minnesota representative.

19

QUESTION:

Was there ever a probate in Wisconsin?

20

MR. NOLAN:

The record is unclear but I think we can

21

presume that there was, because at the time of the incident
22

they resided there and they owned a home there.

23

25

QUESTION:

What was the purpose of the Minnesota pro­

bate?

1
MR. NOLAN:

I think -- perhaps I could answer this --

2
QUESTION:

Perhaps we could ask your opponent on this

3

one.
4

MR. NOLAN:
5
6
7

I think it's best to ask my opponent.

I think it was to -- that the actual statute in Minnesota is to
appoint a trustee to bring a wrongful death action.

I think

what they did is they appointed a representative out of a

8

probate to bring the wrongful death action, or to do all things

9

necessary.

10

It's indicated in their brief, at any rate, that this

11

action is the main asset of that Minnesota estate, as indicated

12

on page 11 of their brief.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

That's why I asked whether there was a

Wisconsin probate.
MR. NOLAN:

Yes.

That also indicates that there was

16

a Wisconsin probate, that this is the main asset of whatever is

17

in the Minnesota estate.

18
19
20

21

22
23

At any rate, we're here today because Minnesota chose
its law to say that the representative could "stack" three
coverage -- three uninsured motorist coverages that appeared in
Mr. Hague's Wisconsin insurance policy.

Our position is that

Minnesota's choosing of its law in this instance is repugnant
to Article 4, Section 1 of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of
the Constitution $ the Fourteenth Amendment section 1:> Due Pro­

24

cess, and the line of cases which have interpreted those
25

4

1

sections as they apply to choice of law.
2

Now, in order that you know where I'm going, just in
3

6
7

case it may not always appear clear, let me give you a brief
table of contents as to how I intend to proceed here.
through the facts because they're brief and important.

I will gc
I'll

break out what contacts go to each state quantitatively, then
qualitatively.

I'll discuss those briefly in terms of this

Court's decisions on choice of law.

9

pate that by counsel's argument in that this Court will have a

And then, because I antici­

10

larger, an interest in the bigger picture of choice of law,

11

I'll discuss briefly in restatement, and more importantly,

12

Professor Leflar's article because it's somewhat representative

13

of what people are saying in choice of law today, and it seems

14

to be what the Minnesota Court relied on more than cases of this

15

Court .
QUESTION:

16

Well, before you get into that let me ask a

17

question or two.

18

Wisconsin than they are in Minnesota, or is there any differ­

19

Are insurance rates of Allstate higher in

ence?
MR. NOLAN:

20

I don't know, and the record doesn't re­

flect .
21

QUESTION:

What happens when a policy is issued, for

22
instance, in the District of Columbia, where automobiles almost
23

daily cross over into Virginia and Maryland?

Do they take into

24

account experience in those states as well as in the District,
25
5

1

and are rates affected?
2

MR. NOLAN:

I don't know the answer to that, but

3

Minnesota courts seem to indicate that they are and they seem
4

to make the admission that they are.

They did in the case of

5

Bolgrean v. Stich, wherein they indicated that the insuror is
6
7

interested in the Minnesota risk as opposed to another state’s
risk.

other facts being the same, would you be here?

MR. NOLAN:

And the accident took place on the, just
By "barely," I mean within five

It was a bordering -- yes, it was a bor­

17

dering state. But I think that in conflicts of law, the state

18

line is very important and must be honored.
QUESTION:

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

isn't it?

Well, it's like any other line-drawing,

You have a line or you don't have a line?
MR. NOLAN:

That's right.

And it's especially impor­

tant here in terms of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.
Briefly, the facts of this case are that on July 1,
1974, Mr. Hague resided with his family in Wisconsin.

He had

traveled for 15 years to work in Minnesota but he resided in
6

1

Wisconsin with his family.
2
3
4
5

6
7

On that date he was riding as a

passenger on his son's motorcycle when it was struck in the rear
by another Wisconsin resident.

Mr. Hague, the son, and the per­

son hitting him were Wisconsin residents; the accident took
place on a Wisconsin road.

Neither his son, whose cycle he was

on, nor the person who hit him, had insurance.

Therefore, any

insurance available in wrongful death action came from

8

Mr. Hague's, or would come from Mr. Hague's uninsured motorist

9

coverage.

10

In Wisconsin you can stack that; in Minnesota you can­

11

not.

12

1976, approximately two years after this accident, Mrs. Hague

13

moved to Minnesota and began this action; contemporaneously

14

with moving here she was appointed the representative.

15

capacity as plaintiff is as a representative.

16

Two years later Mrs. Hague -- two years later, I mean in

The contacts in that setting are these.

Her

The contacts

17

in Minnesota, that the Minnesota court felt significant, were,

18

number one, that Mr. Hague had traveled to Minnesota for some

19
20

15 years prior to this accident; that Allstate did business in
the State of Minnesota; that Mrs. Hague at the time she began
this action was a resident of the State of Minnesota; and that

21

now Minnesota had some interest in the heirs of this estate.
22
23

The contacts with the State of Wisconsin are that
with regard to the occurrence, it involved three Wisconsin resi­

24

dents , it took place on Wisconsin roads which presumably are
25

7

1

regulated by the State of Wisconsin.
2
The action before you is a contract declaratory judg­
3

ment action.

This contract was applied for, written, and

4

delivered in the State of Wisconsin;
5
6
7
8
9

most importantly, written

to conform with Wisconsin's law which had $15,000 worth of
minimum coverage.

That is why this particular type of coverage

was written and all the premiums on this insurance policy were at
all times paid from the State of Wisconsin.
Looking at those contacts qualitatively, the Minnesota

10

contacts, the fact that Minnesota does, or Allstate does busi­

11

ness in the State of Minnesota is important to jurisdiction but

12

it does not give Minnesota an interest as to what Allstate does

13

with contracts in Wisconsin.

14

be in somewhat the same situation as in Savchuk v. Rush, where

15

they tried to tie some significance to State Farm being in all

16

50 states and Justice White dismissed that as not being a sig­

17

nificant test for jurisdiction purposes.

18
19
20
21

It's -- if that were true, you'd

The other tests that Mr. -- or one other test, that
Mr. Hague drove to Minnesota, has really nothing to do with
either this transaction, in that the transaction was written
to comply with the Wisconsin statutes as a Wisconsin risk.

It

has nothing to do with this occurrence because there's no -22
there is agreement on all sides that Mr. Hague was not going to
23

work, coming from work, having anything to do with work at the
24

time he was injured.
25

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Nolan, you referred to Savchuk and I

2
think Volkswagen is probably along the same lines.

That really

3

is the exercise of judicial jurisdiction -4

MR. NOLAN:
5

7

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- over a party.

What you're talking about

is the Home Insurance, Delta Pine line that raises -- that say
even if you have judicial jurisdiction, the Due Process Clause or

8

the Full Faith and Credit Clause limits the right of one state

9

to wholly impose its laws even on a party that conceivably is

10

11

before it for jurisdictional purposes.
MR. NOLAN:

That's correct.

I think that along

12

those lines I think that choice of law cases have not had as

13

much exposure as jurisdiction cases, but I think we would argue

14

that they're perhaps more important in that jurisdiction estab­

15

lishes a convenience test, where you can hale a person into

16

court, where choice of law really decides what is going to be

17

the ultimate outcome, the disposition of matters.

18

bit like saying that jurisdiction may decide where a person is

19

20
21

It's a little

going to be hung, but choice of law would decide whether he is
going to be hung.
QUESTION:

Did the policy have any provision as to

which law would apply?
22
MR. NOLAN:

No it had no -- no clause in it.

23

QUESTION:

That would have been an easy way out for

24

Allstate, wouldn't it?

MR. NOLAN

QUESTION:

20

No.

In terms of those -- the cases that --

11

19

There was no problem in getting

ahold of Allstate in Wisconsin?

6

16

As to both states and both parties, they

were equally accessible; right?

5

10

Yes, it would.

MR. NOLAN

Pardon?
Wouldn't go as far as Alaska, would it?
You mean, this case?

No.

If I could per-

haps survey the cases, those cases in which this Court has said
that a forum court cannot apply its own law, the ones that I

21

think are most pertinent are Dick v. Home Insurance, Yates v.
22
23

John Hancock, Delta Pine; those would support our position.
In both of those, this Court reversed a forum court that applied

24

its own law because it said that the contacts were either too
25

10

1

slight or casual; or that, in Yates, by applying the Georgia
2

jury, letting the matter go to the jury, did not give full faith
3

and credit to New York's law.
4

Those -- more importantly, I should probably distin­
5
6
7
8

guish those cases which, in which you have let the forum court
apply its own law over the contracting, the state of contract­
ing.

The two that are the most prominent are Watson and Clay.

Now, those are distinguished from this case.

9

First of all, Watson.

In Watson you allowed direct

10

action in Louisiana.

11

resident of Louisiana and the Louisiana court applied its direct

12

action statute without regard to the policy of insurance which

13

was made and delivered in another state, which indicated you

14

could not do that.

15

Louisiana to do that and in so doing recognized that Louisiana

16

had a significant contact in interest with this, with the mat­

17

ter under consideration because the person at the time they were

18

injured was a resident of Louisiana and the injury took place in

19
20
21

22
23

Louisiana.

The injury took place in Louisiana to a

This Court said that was all right for

Neither of those things happened in Minnesota.
With regard to Clay, Clay was -- is perhaps somewhat

analogous in that we're talking about an ambulatory contract.
It was a contract on personal property.
in Illinois.

I think it was drawn

Mr. Clay, after it was made and drawn in Illinois,

moved to Florida, lived there for two years, paid insurance
24

premiums from there, and then after that time the loss occurred.
25

11

1

Florida applied its law to nullify a contract provision in that
2
Illinois contract which would have limited actions to a certain
3

period of time which had now expired, in order to give its resi­
4

dent the right to recover on this insurance policy.
5

That case came up to this Court twice, but finally
6
this Court indicated that because Mr.

Clay had moved to

7

Wisconsin, in that the loss took place in -- or not Wisconsin,
8

Florida; and the loss took place in Florida; and presumably that

9

the company accepted premiums from Florida for that two years;
10
11

that not only did Florida have an interest in this matter,
but it didn't upset anybody's justified

expectations because

12

the premiums came and everybody knew the risk had moved to

13

Florida.

14

That did not happen in this case.

In this case all

15

of the contacts which this Court has previously indicated would

16

lean toward the choice of that state's laws are in Wisconsin.

17

With regard to Professor Leflar's discussion, I think

18

perhaps we should touch upon it because it seems this has be­

19

come a favorite of law review articles and this Minnesota

20

Supreme Court certainly gave that more weight and credence than

21

they did the decisions of this Court.

22

Professor Leflar indicates a five-stage test to

23

deciding choice of law:

24

of governmental order, simplification of judicial task, govern­

25

predictability of results, maintenance

mental interest, and better rule of law.
12

Now, Minnesota somehow

1

applied that test and got to their law.

I think that if you

2

really look at what Professor Leflar has indicated, number one,
3

Minnesota did that without looking to the constitutional safe­
4

guards, and that's why we're here today.
5

6
7

But even if you were just to look at Professor Leflar's
test as it applies to the fact that now we have to look at the
interests of the states and we have a more fluid society, that

8

sort of approach, it still leans to Wisconsin.

9

predictability of results, his first test, very important in a

In other words,

10

contract dispute.

11

right -- this is very similar to the justified expectations

12

test of the restatement -- people have a right to have, unless

13

there is some substantial overriding interest of an opposing

14

state, they have a right to have the law of the state they

15

intended to have, but in --

16

This is a contract dispute.

QUESTION:

People have the

Minnesota is free to adopt Professor

17

Leflar's test whether we think it is a wise one or not, unless

18

it somehow offends the Constitution.

19
20

21

22
23

MR. NOLAN:

Exactly.

And not only -- the only point

that I raise it today is because the Minnesota court seems to
say that there is some -- we should be more interest-oriented
in interest analysis in these types of choice of law.

I am

saying that even if they wanted to take that approach, they
could apply Leflar and they still should have ended up with

24

Wisconsin law.
25

13

1

QUESTION:

This brings me back to my rate question.

2
Had this policy been issued to a Minnesota decedent or a
3

Minnesota resident, would the policy be any different than the
4

one that was issued to the decedent?
5
6

MR. NOLAN:
different,

7

9

you mean?
QUESTION:

8

Would the wording of the policy be any

Or the rate be any different?

MR. NOLAN:

I personally do not know, but, again, the

Minnesota court indicated in their opinion, they seem to con­

10

cede that it would.

11

decision, they indicate that Wisconsin has

12

est in keeping insurance premiums low.

13

In other words, I think on page 49 of their

QUESTION:

a

legitimate inter­

Well, sometimes policies do vary from state

14

to state, and I -- but I wondered whether this record showed

15

anything on that.

16

thing about it.

I take it it doesn't.

MR. NOLAN:

17

It doesn't show any­

No, the record was submitted on stipulated

18

facts and it did not include that and the Minnesota Supreme

19

Court did not ask for that, but they -- I think the law of the

20

case would presume that they felt it would make a difference.
QUESTION:

21

22
23
24

If it did, if Minnesota rates were higher,

that would have been a factor in your favor had it been in the
record.
MR. NOLAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

Would the, would such an element as the

25

14

1
age in which one state sold intoxicating liquors to persons have
2

some bearing on rates?

That is, if one state had 18 years and

3

the other state had 21 years, are those the kinds of factors
4

that enter into the ratemaking process?
5
6
7

MR. NOLAN:

I frankly do not know.

To the extent that

it could be shown that more accidents occur because of that and
if it could be shown that states do write to the total risk of

8

that state -- in other words, how many claims are brought, it

9

would.

10

QUESTION:

On the basis of massive information on the

11

subject, couldn't any court take judicial notice that intoxi­

12

cating liquors have a very serious effect on automobile acci­

13

dents ?

14

MR. NOLAN:

Yes, I think -- yes.

I think they could,

15

Your Honor, and I think in the same respect in Justice Blackmun's

16

case they could also take judicial notice that it would likely

17

make the premium higher in the State of Minnesota if Minnesota

18

has a policy which in essence gives out more benefits on the

19
20
21

same insurance contract language.
QUESTION:

Mr. Nolan, if you would help me with the

other -- I was thinking about the contractual aspect of this for
a moment. CoulJ you help me with this concept of stacking that's

22
kind of at the bottom of this, I must confess I didn't think
23

about it enough before argument.

What that means, I gather, is

24

that the victim who has a policy, has an uninsured motorist
25

15

1

clause in it and has two policies may recover on both policies.
2

Is that the way it --

3

MR. NOLAN:

4
5

QUESTION:

Right.
And there was -- or are there three poli­

cies here?

6

MR. NOLAN:

7

QUESTION:

Three policies here.
And you're saying that in Wisconsin he

8

could only recover on one because Wisconsin in effect as a mat­

9

ter of law imposes a condition in the contract that says, even

0

if you take out three or four more policies with uninsured

11
2

motorist clauses in them, they don't mean what they appear to
say?

3

MR. NOLAN:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. NOLAN:

6

QUESTION:

7
8
9
20

But -- well, it's -Is that what it is?
They don't quite phrase it that way.
I know, but I'm just -- that's, I'm just

trying to see what kind of obligation is being changed here by
Minnesota.
MR. NOLAN:

Minnesota -- take the -- in both con­

tracts, I think it's safe to say, whether it was written in
Minnesota, it would merely say that under this coverage you have

2

uninsured motorist coverage of X amount, $15,000 in this case,
22

on one vehicle.

It was three coverages.

23

on one person, it was three coverages -24

QUESTION:

I see.

25

16

Not three coverages

1

MR. NOLAN:

-- on three separate vehicles.

And Wis­

2
consin would say, you may take the coverage from one vehicle and
3

apply it.

Minnesota would say, you may take the coverage from

4

all three vehicles for which you've paid a premium and stack it
5

6
7

so as to -QUESTION:

It's a question of whether.the policy shoul d

be construed as limited to the vehicle described in that policy

8

or without saying anything pick up other vehicles and additional

9

coverage, then?

10

MR. NOLAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. NOLAN:

QUESTION:

I think that you said the other way around.

14

Mr. Nolan, a good many states, I think, re­

20

I see.
That's right.

quire uninsured motorist insurance.

16

18

That's right.

That's correct.
Do either of these states require it as a

matter of law for policies written in them?
MR. NOLAN:

I believe they do.

There is — my only

hesitation is that at various times in the middle '70s there was
differences, I think, between the two states as to whether you

21
had to offer it as opposed to whether you had to get a rejec­
22
tion of it, of the option.

And I'm not sure of the distinction

23

between the two states in that regard.

But in --

24

QUESTION:

Do you know whether they were different?

25

17

1
I think you are saying you don't know whether they had it.
2

MR. NOLAN:

I don't know with regard to that, to the

3

part of whether in Wisconsin and Minnesota at the same time the
4

law was that you had to reject uninsured motorist or you got it
5

as opposed to just having to make it available.

6

QUESTION:

Wouldn't that appear from the statutes of

7

the two states or from the regulations of the insurance commis­

8

sioners ?

9

MR. NOLAN:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. NOLAN:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, it would.
It'd be a matter of record somewhere?
It would be a matter of record.
In this case, of course, the uninsured

24

Professor Leflar is really a contacts test.
25

18

His two most

important tests, maintenance of interstate order in governmental

interest, are at the heart of the contacts tests.

In other words

in terms of maintenance of interstate order, if Minnesota is to

apply their law on the fragile contacts that they have with this
case,

then, in essence, they are chipping away at the sove­

reignty of Wisconsin to make laws and to judicially interpret
those laws.

They're giving it no credence, they're not re­

specting that sovereignty.
With regard to his test of governmental interest, you

10

don't have significant governmental interest if you don't have

11

contacts with the matter, significant contacts, with either the

12

transaction or the occurrence.

13

upon two very dangerous contacts to deem them significant.

14

By that I mean that two of the four that they even talked about

15

as being contacts, the fact that at the time the action was com­

16

menced and the fact that at the time the action was commenced

17

they were now concerned'with the heirs

the type of contacts which may be developed voluntarily, will­
fully, after the occurrence giving rise to the dispute.
In other words, if you're going to have a rule that's
going to be predictable, and to not promote forum shopping, you
really have to -- perhaps the case will arise where you cannot
disregard an after-acquired contact, but you have to look very

24

closely at those, and in most instances just freeze the facts

Would the case be any different if the

Would that be a same case?

5

MR. LOWENFELD:
6
7

8
9

If I could make a somewhat roundabout

answer to your question, Justice Stevens, I think it's worth
putting this whole question of uninsured motorist insurance in
context a little bit.

Just let me back up for a moment.

It starts out in about the mid-60s.

In many states

10

there is a drive for compulsory insurance and the insurance

11

industry resists.

12

insurance, and the insurance industry resists.

13

say, they recognized the problem of the uncompensated traffic

14

victim and they say, here's what we'll do:

15

policy, and then later some states required it, but we'll offer

16

a policy that says the motor vehicle owner and members of his

17

household, as defined in one of those small print clauses, but

18

basically that's right -- will be covered for accidents arising

19

where the fault is that of the uninsured motorist.

20

21

22
23
24
25

In other states there's a drive for no-fault

words, it's a kind of hybrid.

And what they

we'll offer a

In other

It's first-party coverage but

it's tort; it's negligence, it's not a non-fault coverage.
Well,, now, what happens is, it works both ways.
You are covered, yourself, and your members of your family,
wherever you may be, in -- it doesn't have to be your own car,
and also occupants of your car are covered.
27

So it happens all

1
the time that, let's say, Mr. A has insurance, including this

2
insurance.

He then is driving as a passenger in Mr. B's car

3

when X, the uninsured motorist, negligently runs into them.
4

So A is covered under his own policy, for which he's paid a
5

6

premium, and he's covered as an occupant under B's policy.

Now,

then the question is, what does the coverage say?

7

The insurance companies try to make so-called other

8

insurance clauses.

9

the National Insurance Bureau, which was followed in this policy

And there is a standard clause put out by

10

and seems to be in all the textbooks and in nearly all the

11

policies.

12

Apparently, if they'd said that, the insurance commissioners

13

wouldn't have permitted it.

14

say, if there are two policies, one of them is excess to the

15

other and you don't get more than the total limit.

16

It didn't quite say there shall never be stacking.

But what they tried to do is to

Now, then, the stacking cases came up and I was

17

astounded -- if you look at Professor Widiss's book on unin­

18

sured motorist insurance, which came out in 1969 -- there's a

19

20

1980 supplement -- it's about 400 pages of mostly cases.
this has come up in the last few years.

All

Interestingly enough,

about a third of the cases seem to involve Allstate.

So they're

21

very fully aware of this.

There's no unexpected there.: ,. And the

22
majority of states so far -- it's a little hard to have an exact
23

rule, because not all of the cases involve the highest court of
24

the state -- and there are different kinds of stacking.
25

28

1
There's the guy in the other fellow's car, and there's also the
2
fellow who has more than one policy, or more than one car on the:
3

policy.
4

The majority of states that have faced this problem
5
6
7

have said, we will permit recovery on each policy since, after
all, a premium has been paid on each policy.

And there's no

windfall, since there is actual -- it only goes up to the

8

provable damages.

9

that sinks and you could recover $4,000 on a $2,000 boat.

It's not like having two policies on a boat

10

That's not this at all.

11

or death up to your provable damages.

12

52-year-old man who was earning about $15,000 and had children,

13

so there's no issue here, that he's being somehow given a wind­

14

fall.

15

This is recovery for accidental injury
In our case we had a

Now, if I may get back -- a somewhat longwinded

16

answer to your question -- if they had absolutely said, no

17

stacking, I think the Wisconsin insurance commissioner would

18

probably have said, no.

19

missioner would have said no.

20
21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Probably the Minnesota insurance com­
They --

Let me rephrase the question.

Say that's

what the contract said and Wisconsin insurance commissioner
said, that's okay.
MR. LOWENFELD:
you look at the policy.

Well, it's kind of interesting, if
For instance, the -- Wisconsin, as we

know, has direct action statutes.

Blackmun -- the rate's probably higher in Wisconsin rather than
lower.

And the policy says

no one can sue the insurance com­

pany except for injuries in Wisconsin.
Now, you know that's not going to stand up.

If a

Wisconsin driver comes -QUESTION:

The express language I'm suggesting is

spelled it out more or less as they had in the Home Insurance

12

Company case on the time problem.

13

case control in that hypothetical?

14

MR. LOWENFELD:

And that was express, and the parties

Would not the Home Insurance

Well, it's possible.

Courts all

15

around the country, and Minnesota is a good example, have

16

found ways around a variety of these clauses.

17

say they're ambiguous.

18

Justice Stevens, they might say it's against public policy.

19

I'm not certain.

20
21

22
23
24
25

Sometimes they

If it were unambiguous, as you suggest,

But certainly it would be a stronger case for

Allstate than this one.
QUESTION:

Well, Home Insurance was the case of a

state court that tried to find a way around a policy and it was
reversed by this Court, wasn't it?
MR. LOWENFELD:

That's right.

But if you notice,

several things are very different about Home Insurance and
30

1

this case.
2
3
4
5

Perhaps the most important one for our present pur­

poses is.v that under the present rulings of this Court there
would have been no jurisdiction in Home Insurance.

Home Insur­

ance against Dick is really the grandfather of Seider and Roth,
and Rush and Savchuk, and all of those cases.

It was a quasi-

6

in-rem action brought by taxing the alleged res, which was the

7

obligation to reinsure,

8

9

the actual insuror, had no connection whatever.

10

11
12

of a New York company that was doing

That is to say, Anglo-Mejicana, which was
That's one

point.
Second, there was a choice of law clause.

It said,

this policy will be governed by the Commercial Code of Mexico.

3

And third, as I already said, it specifically said, the follow­

4

ing rivers are the only ones covered by this policy.

5

are the three differences.

6
7
8
9
20
21

22
23
24

So those

And I guess it is right, that if we had that again,
that probably still is arbitrary action.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lowenfeld, I think what I'm trying to

get at is whether the issue is affected at all by the clarity
and certainty of the obligation that was created in the other
state, whether it depends to a certain extent on a construe in
that state's law as opposed to giving effect to a very plainly
assumed obligation by parties who negotiate a contract.

Is

that relevant at all?
MR. LOWENFELD:

I think it's relevant, but I don't

25

31

1

think, Justice Stevens, that it is conclusive.
2

3
4
5

Because, one,

it's understood that this is nationwide, in fact, continental­
wide, all of North America, policy.

Second, that the insurance

company itself does business -- in fact, I think it's the
fourth largest insuror with over 200,000 policies -- in Minne­

6

sota.

7

in the Watson case by Justice Frankfurter, in which he has a

8

kind of alternative argument to the one used by Justice Black.

9

He says the insurance company knew all about this.

If you recall, for example, the quite interesting opinior.

It came

10

into Louisiana, it took advantage of the privilege of doing

11

business there, and it's bound by the laws.
I think that same argument applies to Allstate in

12

13

this case.

14

Supreme Court had then said in the present case, Hague against

15

Allstate is different from Van Tassel against Horace Mann,

16

which is the principal case in which they in Minnesota said, we

17

apply stacking.

18

clause, because the anti-stacking clauses are unambiguous in

19
20
21

22

So that if -- in other words, if the Minnesota

It's different because there is a choice of law

contrast to the other case -- here they're the same.

If it had

made all those points, I think that is an appropriate way for
the Minnesota Supreme Court to do.

If it had still said, no,

because what we're concerned with is protection, is the role of
the accident compensation system.

And we have our widow, we

23

have an estate that we are concerned with.

And if it had said

24

that, that doesn't strike me as arbitrary action of the kind
25
32

1

that this Court ought to interfere with.
2
3
4
5

6
7

8
9

This Court is not, I

think, a court of errors and appeals on the choice of law theo­
ries.

Contrary to what Mr. Nolan said, we're not asking you

here to say, we agree with Minnesota Supreme Court's construc­
tion of Leflar.

We're simply saying it doesn't rise to the

dignity of the kind of arbitrary action that this Court sits;
to exclude.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, you have emphasized

two factors, primarily:

the presence of the will in Minnesota

10

and the fact that the decedent was employed in Minnesota.

11

I think it was Justice White who asked you what the effect would

12

have been if she had, the widow had remained in Wisconsin.

13

My question is whether your case would be substantially weakened

14

or you would have no case at all if decedent had not been em­

15

ployed in Minnesota?

16
17
18
19

20

MR. LOWENFELD:

Well, Justice Powell, I think the --

I raised the issue of employment because the Minnesota Supreme
Court raised it.

If you look at the purposes of the accident

compensation system -- and of course, this is a hybrid between
tort and contract, as I already suggested -- the more important
issue is whether the widow and heiress becomes a public charge

21

or whether there is a fund available to pay for her.

So I

22

think the employment though relevant .is less critical than the
23

residence of the lady, provided, and I -- just to repeat what
24

I said to Justice Rehnquist, provided there's no suggestion of
25

33

1

manipulation or deliberate forum shopping, something like that.
2

QUESTION:

What if the results were to be the same in

3

both states?

Then what happens to your argument about the

4

widow becoming a public charge?
5

6

MR. LOWENFELD:

You mean, if Minnesota also now says

stacking is foolish?

7

QUESTION:

No, if the financial result was precisely

8

the same in both states?

9

MR. LOWENFELD:

Well, I suppose then there is no con­

10

flict of laws.

11

may well be the situation, since, interestingly enough, the

12

Wisconsin court in the Nelson case, which said, we don't have

13

stacking here, said, that's because this accident happened be­

14

fore the statute was amended and then the statute was amended

15

and they said, well, we make no finding as to how that would

16

come out.

17

Wisconsin would come out the same way but we don't have to worry

18

about that; we don't want to hold a hearing on how Wisconsin

19
20

21

And in fact, as we suggest in our brief, that

And Minnesota Supreme Court said, it's possible that

would judge this, we're just going to apply our own law.
Now, let me just briefly, if I may, come back to the
question of what line

should be drawn.

I've already suggested

that this Court ought to be reluctant to get into the question
22
23

of a particular contact or a particular interest, whether it's
residence or the place of the accident or the domicile of the --

24

of a particular party, whether it's plaintiff or defendant.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll resume there at 1

2

o'clock.
3

MR. LOWENFELD:

All right.

Thank you.

4

(Recess)

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
continue.

7

You have seven minutes remaining.
MR. LOWENFELD:

8

Mr. Lowenfeld, you may

Thank you very much.

As I was saying at the lunch break, the position that

9

we take is that this Court does not sit to decide between one

10

theory of conflict of laws and another, whether it's contacts

11

analysis or interests analysis, the first restatement, the

12

second restatement, Professor Leflar, or some other professor;

13

that what it sits to oversee is, and only is, the question of

14

arbitrary action.
I'd like, perhaps, in the few minutes I have remain­

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

ing -QUESTION:

I'd like to be sure about what, you mean,

because there's really no Federal constitutional question for
us to decide in choice of law cases, unless there's some alleged
arbitrary action, denial of due process, and that's all?
MR. LOWENFELD:

That's entirely my position, Justice

Brennan; yes.
22
23

QUESTION:

Does that not, to a degree -- or, I'll put

it, does it to a degree put jurisdiction and choice of law in
24

logic-tight compartments?
25

35

1

HR. LOWENFELD:
2
3
4
5

Well, that's an interesting way,

Mr. Chief Justice, to put that question.

Of course, we've had

this series of cases now -- four of them in four years -- in
which the jurisdiction has been challenged and state court
action has been struck down.

It's interesting that Justice

6

Brennan in each of those cases said, why is that so if choice of

7

law would be permissible?

8

prepared to strike down certain cases of arbitrary reaching out.

9
0

And the majority has said, no, we are

I think it turns out that some of the cases that
you've had in the jurisdiction area -- Rush and Savchuk in par­

11

ticular is a good example; perhaps Kulko as well -- the Court

2

might have come down the other way, but the difficulty, if it

3

had come down -- that is to say, struck them down on choice of

4

law rather than on jurisdictional grounds -- but if you had done

5

that, it would have opened up a very large area of fine-line

6

drawing, weighing this against that, and it would have involved

7

this Court telling the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, Minnesota,

8

California, et cetera, how to decide cases.
QUESTION:

9

Of course, by the same token, you could

say we told them how to decide them on the basis of jurisdic­
20

tion .
21

MR. LOWENFELD:

No, I don't think so, Justice

22

Rehnquist.

I think what you told them in those cases is, don't

23

decide this case; it ought to be adjudicated somewhere else, or
24

dismissed -- as in Volkswagen -- dismiss the following parties
25

36

1

from the case, and then you can go ahead with other parties.
2
3
4
5

That's exactly the difference.

And it seems to me that in terms

of a vibrant Federal system, it's easier to draw lines and it's
less intrusive into the work of the state judiciary to say, you
may not hear this case at all, than to say, you can hear it but

6

you'll only decide it in a certain way.

7

started with Hanson against Denckla and then kept up in these

8

four cases that you've had in the last four years now.

9

QUESTION:

I think that was

Is it possible that -- I'll put it another

10

way -- which do you think will be advanced by the approach you

11

suggest, hands off, by this Court?

12

Is

13

it

Federalism or parochialism?

parochialism?
MR. LOWENFELD:

I would say -- I would say federalism

14

and a certain amount of experimentation.

15

the difficulty with setting down rules in the choice of law

16

area, it's a little bit like the criminal procedure cases.

17

Since you have no Federal statute, you only, your only criteri­

18
19

If you think about

on is a due process criterion if you lay down a certain rule.
For example, the issue must vest at the date of impact, or the
following are minimum contacts, and so forth.

It will turn out

20

that neither the lower Federal courts nor the state courts nor
21

state legislatures nor Congress, no one can make any changes.
22

And that, it seems to me, it would be very unfortunate for the
23

development of federalism.

It's no accident, Mr. Chief Justice,

24

that the conflict of laws has really been in the forefront of
25

37

1
2
3
4

experimentation in the whole area of accident compensation.
That is, we've had, for example, the series of guest statute
cases that I'm sure you're familiar with, many in New York, some
in California and elsewhere.

5

And the result over time, though the conflict theories

6

have tended to vary with the different professors and the dif­

7

ferent judges, in the end we've had a reduction in guest stat­

8

utes; we've had a reduction in wrongful death limitations; a

9

variety of these kind of quirky state rules have tended to go.

10

In other words, conflict of laws has been an engine of law re­

11

form generally and I think it would be very unfortunate if this

12

Court were to stop that.

I think that's what Professor Freund

3

meant in his essay about Chief Justice Stone, which is cited in

4

our brief.

5
6

case in which he warned against returning to the "ice age" of
conflict of laws.
I think altogether a dynamic federalism, Mr. Chief

7
8
9

It's what Chief Judge Kaufman meant in the Pearson

Justice, would be furthered by a statement that the Court will
come in only at a certain time, only when there's really arbi­
trary action, not by an attempt to draw particular rules of this

20

kind here.
21

QUESTION:

But you don't think thatwe should say that

22

just because a state court has jurisdiction -- obvious jurisdic­
23

tion, no one questions it -- that it may apply its own law?
24

MR. LOWENFELD:

I'm not sure whether you should say

25

38

1

that or not, Mr. Justice White.
2
3
4

QUESTION:

I think --

Would you find the application of that rule

arbitrary in some circumstances, if there's acknowledged juris­
diction, everybody agrees there's jurisdiction?

5

MR. LOWENFELD:

I would put the statement slightly

6

differently.

7

vigilance that you've exercised in the last few years on judi­

8

cial jurisdiction, on reaching out by state courts, you will not

9

find the kind of arbitrary action, the kind of parochialism --

10

as the Chief Justice suggested -- that you need to worry about.

11

I'm not quite sure I would put -- but if you did put it the way

12

you've said, I don't think that would be a tragedy.

13

it's a slight, subtle difference.

I would say that if you exercised the kind of

QUESTION:

14

I think

Mr. Lowenfeld, would you say that a statute

15

would be

16

passed a statute that said, in all cases tried in Minnesota

17

courts the Minnesota judges shall apply Minnesota law?

18
19

unconstitutional that -- say the State of Minnesota

MR. LOWENFELD:

I think I could certainly conceive of

situations where, as applied, that such a statute would be
unconstitutional.

Yes; for example, if in our case Mrs. Hague

20

had remained in Wisconsin or had moved to New York but had hired
21

Minnesota counsel and then were applying that kind of statute,
22

that would seem to me arbitrary action; yes.
23

I think my time is out.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK M. NOLAN
2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

3

5

MR. NOLAN:

If I might respond and rebut quickly and

briefly, I would like to answer Justice White's question by
pointing out the ludicrousness of it.

6

Allstate could be sued in all 50 states, all 50 states,

7

for the purposes of a declaratory judgment action, an action

8

directly against the insurance company.

9

in all 50 states.

You would not want any of those 50 states to

10

be able to choose their law.

11

question, no.

I would say, in answer to your

The courts cannot choose their law.

QUESTION:

12

You could sue Allstate

When you say, ludicrousness,

you

mean

13

the ludicrousness of the result, not the ludicrousness of the

14

question?

15

MR. NOLAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

That is so.
But where do you find the word "ludicrous"

in the Constitution?
MR. NOLAN:

18

QUESTION:

19

Where I find -What's a -- what would Allstate be deprived

of if sued in Hawaii on this cause of action by a resident of
20

Minnesota?
21

MR. NOLAN:

Allstate would be deprived of due process

22

and in this particular instance Wisconsin would -23

QUESTION:

How?

How is that?

24

MR. NOLAN:

-- be deprived of full faith and credit.

25

40

1
QUESTION:

Why would it be deprived of due process?

2
MR. NOLAN:

Because there are no contacts --

Please tell me if Dick does -- why, what

4

deprivation is that?

There are no contacts with the State of

Hawaii that gives them any interest over the State of, over
Allstate's interest in writing this contract in conformity with
Wisconsin's law.
QUESTION:

Well, would it be all right to be sued

there in Hawaii as long as it applied Wisconsin's laws?
MR. NOLAN:

I think they could.

I think somebody

might raise a motion of forum non conveniens.
QUESTION:

But y.ou --

Well, suppose it was denied?

It would

still be -MR. NOLAN:

Then I think the result should be that

they could hear the case but they should apply Wisconsin's law.
QUESTION:

Well, what interest has Hawaii got in

hearing that case?
MR. NOLAN:

I don't think they have any interest and I

would wonder why they would do it.

But they could -- I guess

what I'm saying is that you're telling me to assume that the
jurisdiction is okay?
QUESTION:
MR. NOLAN:
QUESTION:

I am.
What should be the choice of law?
I am; yes, I am.

Yes I am; yes.

Okay.

MR. NOLAN:

Rather than just dismiss the case?
Well, the -- what they really -- you've

told me -- I said that I would bring the motion for forum non

They should dismiss the case.

8

assume that's denied.

Then you've said,

15

law as opposed to New York's law and in that court this case

16

indicated the choice of law was a Full Faith and Credit issue

17

in addition to due process, and additionally indicated that that

18

after-acquired fact of her moving to Georgia was not enough

19

20

That is a case very

After the death

Georgia applied their

contact with Georgia to give them any interest to apply their
law.
The same is true of Mrs. Hague moving to Minnesota

21

after this instance.

Full Faith and Credit does go to not only

22

acts but to judicial proceedings.

What has happened here,

23

there's the judicial proceeding of Wisconsin has said, no
24

stacking; Nelson is the case.

No stacking; to give full faith

25

42

1

and credit to that, you must apply Wisconsin's law.
2
Additionally, there's been a hint that there's no con­
3

flict at issue, both in the argument and in the brief.

There

4

definitely is a conflict of law.
5
6
7
8
9

The Minnesota court's recog­

nized that the Nelson case in Wisconsin said, no stacking.
It wasn't raised in argument but it is raised in their brief
that an amendment was added to the statute after that decision.
That amendment has nothing to do with giving arguments to
stacking, as -- without getting off on a tangent, it provides

10

arguments for not allowing a setoff for med. pay and uninsured

11

motorist coverage.

12

amendment did not change the statute.

As the Minnesota court recognized, that
There is a conflict.

13

The last issue that I should address is, this Court

14

should hear these cases, should make a determination in these

15

cases.

16

abdicate its role as the protector of the Constitution in

17

letting courts just experiment and go to this better rule of

law test without paying attention to the Constitution.

Is there always one answer to these ques­

tions ?

I would say that would be a closer case.

No, there isn't; that's -I mean, could it -- aren't there some cases

in which either -- the law of either state could be applied
without violating the Constitution?
MR. NOLAN:

Yes.

And in that -- if that were true

12

then, if you got to that threshold, then better rule of law

13

might be a way of resolving that, that dilemma.

14

don't get to that threshold, if you don't cross the constitu­

QUESTION:

Well, in Justice White's hypothetical,

would the Full Faith and Credit -- in Justice White's hypotheti­
cal, would the Full Faith and Credit Clause be involved?
MR. NOLAN:

To the extent that -- you're saying --

I guess, if it would -20

QUESTION:

As I understand your argument in this case

21

you do rely on the Full Faith and Credit Clause?

MR. NOLAN:

In the Federal Constitution?

MR. NOLAN:

13

What would you -- you mean, what would

you turn to as the --

10

12

What would you have to turn to then?

But these cases do differ.
Yes.

I think that both Due Process and
