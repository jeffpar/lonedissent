ORAL ARGUMENT OF JASON W. KELLAHIN, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS MERRION AND BAYLESS
MR. KELLAHIN:

7

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the 10th Circuit

10

and involves the power of an Indian tribe to tax non-Indians

1 1

locally on the Indian Reservation.

12

The facts of the case are quite simple.

The Jica-

13

rilla Apache Tribe is an Indian tribe occupying an Executive

14

Order Indian reservation located in the northwestern portion

15

of the State of New Mexico.

16

Reorganization Act and in 1968 it adopted a constitution which

17

purported to confer on the Tribal Council authority to impose

18

a tax on non-Indians.

19

It is organized under the Indian

It must be remembered that petitioners here were on

20

the Indian Reservation under valid oil and gas leases issued

21

pursuant to federal law,

22

approved by the Secretary of the Interior.

23

leases dated back to the early 1950s, long before the adoptior

24

of the Jicarillas' severance tax.

25

signed on behalf of the Tribe, and
Some of these

district court and the district court held the tribal ordi­

2

nance imposing a severance tax on oil and gas severed, saved,

3

and removed from tribal lands, which was adopted in 1976, the

4

district court held that ordinance unconstitutional, illegal,

5

invalid, and void, and restrained the Tribe from -enforcing it.

6

The court of appeals in a five-to-two decision re­

7

versed, holding that the power to tax was an attribute of

8

inherent tribal sovereignty, since no treaty or Act of Con­

9

gress authorized it.

They held that it did not violate the

10

Commerce Clause and that the power to tax had not been pre­

1 1

empted by the Federal Government.

12

That raises these questions here:

did the Jicarilia

13

Apache Tribe retain as an attribute of its inherent sovereign­

14

ty the power to impose a severance tax on oil and gas extracted

15

from trust property on its reservation?

16

the Tribe of such power by permitting the state to impose a

17

tax on this same production, and by adopting a pervasive sys­

18

tem of federal regulation of oil and gas production and sale

19

on reservation lands?

20
21

QUESTION:

Mr. Kellahin, is the Jicarilia Tribe a

treaty tribe?

22

MR. KELLAHIN:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Has Congress divested

No, sir.

There is no treaty involved.

And it was not within the boundaries of

■the United States until the Mexican cession?
MR. KELLAHIN:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

MR. KELLAHIN:

That is correct.

Circuit.

In connection with this situation I would like to

16
17

discuss the issue of tribal sovereignty and my colleague will

18

discuss federal preemption and the Commerce Clause issues in

19

this case.

20

The 10th Circuit opinion recognized the case pre­

21

sented an-.issue that had not -been -passed upon by this Gourt and

22

pointed out that this case presents the bald issue of an

23

Indian tribe's taxing power without benefit of reservations

24

of authority in a treaty, since no treaty or Act of Congress

25

authorizes the exercise of such taxing power.
5

The court then

1

reached the conclusion that the right to tax was an inherent

2

aspect of the tribal sovereignty, and with that background

3

it is necessary to address the nature of this sovereignty.

4

As I said, these petitioners were already on the

5

reservation under valid oil and gas leases issued pursuant to

6

Act of Congress.

7

which the petitioners could enter the reservation and the

8

conditions that would permit them to remain.

9

was not reserved as a condition of the leases.

The leases stated the conditions under

The power to tax

So what we have here is a unilateral modification

10
1 1

of a contract by way of taxation which the 10th Circuit

12

upheld.

13

10th Circuit has had a long and somewhat troublesome history

14

and an examination of the cases, especially.the most recent,

15

shows that the Court does not recognize the broad definition

16

of inherent sovereignty that was relied on by the 10th Cir­

17

cuit and supported by respondents in this case.

18

tribal sovereignty has been restricted

19

dependent status, and the most recent case to address this

20

issue was Montana v. United States, which was decided on

21

March 24.

The concept of Indian sovereignty relied on by the

Rather,

by the tribes'

22

Montana v. United States clarifies the scope and

23

extent of tribal sovereignty and makes it abundantly clear

24

that sovereignty extends only to the right of Indian tribes

25

to make their own laws and be governed by them,
6

1

to protect the integrity of their tribal lands from encroach­

2

ment, and to protect their tribal government from outside

interference.

5

6

States it was held that the exercise of tribal power beyond

8

tribe is inconsistent with their dependent status, and so

cannot survive without the express delegation of authority

1 1

tribal authority to try non-Indians for criminal offenses as

12

was found in Oliphant extends as well to the civil jurisdic­

13

tion, and in discussing the extent of civil jurisdiction re­

14

tained by the tribes, this Court touched on the very issue

15

that is raised in this case.

16

The case clearly holds that the same lack of

It pointed out that the Indian tribes retained

17

inherent sovereign power to exercise some forms of civil juris

18

diction over non-Indians. The Court then explained, however,

19

that a tribe may regulate through taxation, licensing, or

20

other means the activities of nonmembers who enter into con­

21

sensual relationships with the tribe or its members through

22

commercial dealings, contracts, leases or other arrangements.

23

In support of this conclusion the Court cited

24

Williams v. Lee, Morris v. Hitchcock, Buster v. Wright, and

25

Washington v. the Confederated Tribes of the Colville
7

1

Indian Reservation.

Both Morris v. Hitchcock and Buster v.

2

Wright were relied on by the 10th Circuit in its conclusion

3

that the tribe had inherent sovereignty to impose this tax.

4

However, these were both clearly cases based on the right of

5

the tribes to exclude nonmembers and to attach conditions on

6

their right to enter onto the reservations.
This was reasserted in the Court's decision in

7

8

Colville.

In the recent Montana opinion it was pointed out

9

that the tribe can impose conditions on those who might choose

10

to enter the reservation lands, the Indian-owned lands, and

1 1

hunt and fish by imposing fees or establishing bag limits.

19

Petitioners entered into a consensual relation­
A contract which imposed the conditions

Taxation was no part of that contract, nor did

20

the petitioners ever consent to taxation of that production.

21

In Colville the Court in upholding the right of the tribe to

22

impose a tax on nonmembers coming onto the reservation to

23

purchase cigarettes cited an opinion by Solicitor Marigold in

24

1934 where the Solicitor pointed out that except where

25

Congress has provided otherwise the power of taxation may be
8

1

exercised over nonmembers so far as such' nonmembers may

2

accept privileges of trade, residence, and so forth, to which

3

taxes may be attached as conditions.

4
5

QUESTION:

Colville dealt with a treaty tribe, did

it not?
MR. KELLAHIN:

6

Yes, sir.

That is' correct.

And the

7

Court found in the Colville case that the treaty did permit

Act, it has the same right to exclude nonmembers from tribal

13

own them.

those who come onto the reservation to buy cigarettes are

free to go elsewhere and avoid the taxation.

read to recognize inherent tribal power to exclude non-Indians

In response to questioning I may have left the

inference that I considered the Colville Tribe a treaty

That of

course is not the case.

They reside on an Executive Order

12

15

Now, very briefly, I would say that after a tribe

has negotiated for, obtained, and its guardian has approved

17

oil and gas leases which set forth the rents and the royalties

18

to be paid to the tribe, it: cannot rationally be contended

the Court:
I represent the petitioners in No.

80-15.

Our argu­

12

ment will be that the Commerce Clause will not permit this

13

new tribal severance tax and that Congress in 1927 by enacting

14

25 United States Code Section 398(c) preempted any power of

15

the tribe to impose the tax.

16

QUESTION:

In your Commerce Clause argument, the first

17

part of your argument, counsel, I take it that would apply to

18

a state as well as to a tribe?

19

MR. COONEY:

Yes, Your Honor, we submit that the

20

negative implications of the Commerce Clause restrain the

21

powers of Indian tribes who would attempt to impose the powers

22

of taxation or regulation over commerce similar to those cur­

23

rently imposed by states or municipalities.

QUESTION:

Haven't severance taxes on extraction of

minerals from the ground long been a source of income for

states?

and other Indian reservations.

Yes.

New Mexico, for example, has im­

posed severance taxes.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. COONEY:

Don't most of the western states?
Most of the western states.

Our Com­

10

merce Clause argument, Your Honor, rests not so much on the

1 1

fact that a severance tax exists but that this Jicarilla

12

severance tax is discriminatory, that it is imposed by the

13

fashion in which it is drafted directly upon commerce, and

14

that it imposes in addition with the tax imposed by the state

15

a multiple burden upon commerce.

16

ity of a severance tax per se, but simply submit that the

17

Jicarilla Tribe may not impose such a tax in this case because

18

Congress has- divested that power, and that in addition when

19

added to the state tax it creates a multiple burden. -

QUESTION:

When they negotiated the lease, COULD THE

tribe have written in the provision for the functional equiva­

QUESTION: What you're suggesting is , the tribe is trying
to collect a royalty and these other factors and then another
14

1

royalty in the guise or the form of the tax?
MR. COONEY:

3

Precisely, .Mr. Chief Justice.

That

is exactly what the tribe is attempting here to do.
QUESTION:

4

Well, what's the discriminatory -- give

5

me your discrimination argument, who does it discriminate

against?
MR. COONEY:

7

It discriminates against any oil and

9

Jicarilla Reservation.

10

QUESTION: ' Is there any?

1 1

MR. COONEY:

There is none at the present.

You mean, it might take its royalty in

It might take its -And then use the gas for its own pur­

poses, maybe?
MR. COONEY:

Or it might sell that'gas to other

20

industries, such as it plans to do on the reservation. And it

21

might also permit producers to locate on the reservation --

22
23
24
25

-QUESTION:

But right now there's no discriminatior

no actual discrimination that you can identify?
MR. COONEY:

None at the present time.

Under the

Nippert case, Your Honor, we believe that the potential for
15

1

discrimination is certainly to be considered by the Court in

2

passing upon the merits of the tax.

3

freely that the tax ordinance here could be amended easily

4

to apply only to severance of all oil and gas which is pro­

5

duced on the reservation --

6

QUESTION:

We also admit quite

And I suppose that if the tribe wanted

7

to take its royalty in kind and sell it or use it and it cost

8

any money, they might get some, they could even get congres­

9

10

case on discrimination.

1 1

MR. COONEY:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. COONEY: As it's presently drafted, we have a case

19

according to the length of the pipeline facilities on the

20

nor to the volume of business conducted there.

None on discrimination.
But I agree, maybe on some other ground.

This tax is not a tax on severance

It is a tax only on transportation or

22

this tax taxes directly an integral portion of commerce and

which is severed on the reservation.
QUESTION:

Then you're saying that in effect the

state could not impose this tax either?
MR. COONEY:

No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we're

5

saying that the state has the power granted by Congress to

6

impose the tax that it now imposes, which applies to the

7

severance of all oil and gas within the

8

and not just to oil and gas within the State of New Mexico

9

that is then transported or sold off the state --

10
11

12

QUESTION:

What authorization

State of New Mexico

is that that the

State of New Mexico must rely on to impose a tax of -- ?
MR. COONEY:

Your Honor, the state might have that

13

authorization absent specific congressional authorization but

14

by the 1927 Act, 25 United States Code, Section 398(c), the

15

states specifically were granted the authority to tax the

16

entire production of oil and gas on Executive Order reserva­

17

tions, including even the Indians' royalty share.

18
19

20

QUESTION:

Well, then we're not talking about taxes

levied by states that, are not on Indian reservations?
MR. COONEY:

We're talking about here the validity

21

of the Jicarilla tax' that is levied on production on the

22

reservation-when added to the state tax that is also imposed

23

on the severance of oil and gas on the reservation.

24
25

QUESTION:

But 398(c) doesn't purport to bear on

the simple state-producer relationship independent of its
17

1

relationship to the Indians, does it?
MR. COONEY:

2

That brings us to the contention of the

2

to tax or regulate commerce, when they seek to tax or regulate

production of oil and gas on Indian reservations.

4

that notion is rooted in 19th century concepts of Indian

tribes as separate nations wholly removed from the Union and

20

It affects the abilityof the producers to produce in paying

23

The tribal tax, therefore, implicates the state

You don't draw any distinction between

MR. NORDHAUS:

has never drawn the distinction between the powers and rights

of tribes on Executive Order reservations -- on reservations

25

which are created by Act of Congress, or by Executive Order

There has never been a distinction except in

debates in the Congress before the enactment of the '27 Act;

and I'll go into this.
But this tax pertains only to production on tribal

lands.

It does not pertain to any production on non-Indian

The compromise pertained to permits that had been

nevertheless, it is clear that the Jicarilla Apache Tribal

20

MR. NORDHAUS:

Well, I think from the old cases of

21

this Court and of the courts since 1302, they could anticipate

22

that Indian governments that were required to furnish govern­

can't survive.

the contract could certainly have taken that into account in

3

MR. NORDHAUS:

On that argument, Your Honor, that is

4

premised on the point that taxes are consensual, that taxes

5

may not be levied by a sovereign government unless the tax­

6

payer consents to the imposition of the tax and the.rate of

7

the tax, and that would indicate that a sovereign government

8

-- and I'm saying that the tribes have this sovereignty --

9

that a sovereign government needs the consent of each taxpayer

10

to levy a tax.

11

courts have held with respect to Indian taxes.

12

And that is not what this Court and other

In Buster v.’ Wright, a tax was imposed on business

13

19

MR. NORDHAUS.:.

Your Honor, that again is, doesn't

20

really reach the question of the sovereign power to tax.

21

I am saying that until that power is divested, and unless that

22

power to tax is inconsistent with the status of the tribe --

23

which we say it is not, because it has been recognized over a

24

long period of years -- then the tribe has this power.

If I may begin at the end, and by the end I mean

8

last week's decision in the Montana Crow Tribe case, the

9

teaching of that case, as we understand it, is that the

10

territorial sovereignty of Indian tribes is somewhat more

1 1

limited than that of states, that Indian tribes cannot regu­

12

late the activities of non-Indians on non-Indian land when

13

there is no involvement of Indians and when there is no sub­

14

stantial effect on vital tribal interests.

15

But the Court was at pains to point out that on the

16

other hand, so much is left of the inherent sovereignty of

17

Indian tribes that they may regulate through taxation and

18

other means those activities of non-Indians even on non-Indiar

19

land, the Court expressly pointed out, when there is a rela­

20

tionship with the Indians through contract or commercial

21

dealings or in other ways; or when, independently of such

22

consensual’dealings between Indians and non-Indians, the

23

activity of the non-Indians on the non-Indian land substan­

24

tially affects vital tribal interests.

25

This case, it seems to us, squarely falls under bott
35

of these principles, indicating what still survives of Indian

2

sovereignty.

long term, and operations which continue over a long term.

Here we're dealing with a continuing relation­

The

activities there affect that land, in a permanent way, as

effects.

quire, and which in practice do involve a local work force,

10

so there is a direct involvement of tribal members with the

1 1

operations of the lessees.

12

tribal roads and the activities of the lessees implicate

13

tribal services not only for the maintenance of such roads but

14

also police and fire protection and all the other benefits

of an estabished government within the reservation

I have not, Your Honor.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

MR. CLAIBORNE:

No, but it does indicate a very

important fact which is that the power to impose the taxes

which were mentioned in that case are sovereign powers and

not landowners' powers or a power to forbid entry or to con­

MR. CLAIBORNE:

I'm sorry, Mr. Justice

That wasn’t the holding of the case?
No, but I take it it was a considers d

dictum in the case.

It very plainly holds that even on non-

13

Indian land, on fee-owned land, there in proper circumstances

14

is the tribal power of taxation.

15

reign power since by definition the tribe is not the landlord

16

and by definition the tribe cannot prevent access to a man's

a sovereign power.

And that principle surely is

Do you think that 393(c) was inpliedly

repealed by later Indian legislation by Congress?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

5

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we have taker,

6

no position with respect to the argument that the 1938 Act

7

inpliedly repealed the state power to tax under the '27 Act.

8

The court of appeal expressly avoided any decision on that

9

issue and it is not presented to this Court.

It is fair to

10

say that the Government has argued for implied repeal in

1 1

other cases in other courts but we have no occasion to take

12

a firm position on that matter here.

13

in our argument today on any implied repeal of the '27 Act.

14

On the contrary, we concede for the purposes of the case that

15

the State of New Mexico does have power pursuant to this

16

'27 Act to impose its own severance tax, but it hardly follows

17

that the '27 Act sub silentio withdrew any power which the

18

tribe had as a matter of its own sovereignty to impose a

One final word on the 1927 legislation.

1

It is said

2

that there was a carefully crafted compromise in which the

3

Indians somehow without it being mentioned lost their power

4

of taxation.
There is not a word in that history to suggest that.

5

6

that was the intent or result of the legislation.

7

Stevens wondered why the tribes had not before very recent

8

times imposed such taxes, although their reservations had

9

been mined for some years before.

Mr. Justice

I would answer that the

10

tribes were not alerted to their prerogatives in the '20s and

11

'30s -- and, indeed, in the '40s and '50s -- and only recently

12

have come to recognize what was rightly theirs.
The same remark could be made of the cigarette.taxes

Morris v. Hitchcock of course itself involved a

tribal tax on cattle grazing' on an Indian reservation. Buster'

24

v. Wright, cited with approval in the two most recent deci­

25

sions of this Court, involved a tax on the privilege of doing
40

1

business by lot owners in towns who owned their own land and

2

whose town government had expressly been given the power to

3

tax as well, to tax that very privilege.

4

therefore, is a case in which there was a town tax and an

5

Indian tax, and no power to remove, and yet the' court of

6

appeal sustained the tax and this Court has in both Colville

7

and Montana

9

cited that decision.

QUESTION:

8

Buster v. Wright,

Mr. Claiborne, do you think there's any

limit to the rate of tax that the tribe can impose?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, then, subject to the approval

of the .Secretary, and that approval is a serious insurance

20

that the tax rate will not be out of all bounds with the ■

21

benefits conferred with the interests of the tribe and with

22

what the traffic will bear.

23

And finally, of course, there is a congressional

24

oversight over tribal taxation, as we say there is with

25

respect to state severance taxes.
41

We have argued, or filed a

1

brief in the next case in which we suggest that there is no

2

occasion for a court to determine what a maximum rate of a

3

severance tax is, but that Congress is free, and should the

4

privilege be abused, no doubt will intervene to set a limit.

So here.

QUESTION:

So they construe it as a severance tax,

don't they?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

They construe it as a severance

tax, and they construe the words "sold or transported off

21

the reservation" to mean sold on the reservation, or trans­

22

ported without sale, when the pipeline is also the extractor,

Do you think the court of appeals con­

MR. CLAIBORNE:

QUESTION:

It's clear that they --

At least they didn't think it was paid

7

-- it certainly wasn't paid by a pipeline, and they didn't

8

think it was paid for transportation or for sale?

9

MR. CLAIBORNE:

I refer Your Honor to page 155 of

10

the Joint Appendix, which makes clear how the court of appeals

1 1

construed this act.

12

QUESTION:

13
14

And that, I take it, is your answer to

at least one of the arguments of your opposition?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Yes.

And I would say that the

tribe is in the best position to construe its own ordinance

and they have so construed it in all courts.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. COONEY, ESO., ON BEHALF OF
THE PETITIONERS AMOCO AND MARATHON -- REBUTTAL
MR. COONEY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Your Honors, we think the significance of Section

24

110 of the Natural Gas Policy Act is merely in recognizing

25

the impact of severance taxes' on production, and that if
43

1

those severance taxes are not allowed to be passed through

2

production is impacted.

3

impact of the tribal tax on the state severance tax.

4

Congress specifically left the question of validity of this

5

tribal severance tax to this Court.

6

That's precisely our point of the

There is no record to support Mr. Nordhaus's claims

7

concerning the cost of tribal services to the lessees.

8

matter of fact, the record that is before the Court shows

9

that the royalty revenue to the tribe more than supports the

10

11

As a

entire tribal government.
Thirdly, while there was no mention of tribal

12

severance taxation in the debates preceding the '27 Act,

13

likewise there was no mention of tribal authority over pur­

14

chasers of alienated lands in the allotment

acts considered

15

by this Court in the Montana case last week.

But we think

16

just as that authority could not have survived the allotment

17

acts, likewise tribal severance taxation could not have sur­

18

vived the 1927 statute.

19

20
21

22

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
The case is submitted.

(Whereupon, at 1:52 o'clock p.m. the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
