PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

first this morning, in Number 79-1344; Michael M. against the

4

Superior Court of Sonoma County, California.

5

you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY F. JILKA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

8

MR. JILKA:

9

it please the Court:

10

Now, Mr. Jilka,

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

My name is Gregory Jilka.

I am one of the attorneys

1 1

for Michael M., a 17-year old California youth who comes before

12

this Court seeking reversal of the judgment of the Supreme

13

Court of California, a judgment which upheld the validity,

14

15
16

17

18
19

20
21

the constitutional validity of California Penal Code Section
261.5, on equal protection grounds.
In oral argument this morning, I propose first to
outline the issue in its procedural posture; secondly, to
discuss the purposes and to assert the purposes of the statute
and thirdly, to discuss the so-called pregnancy prevention
rationale and as to whether or not it really diminishes the
criminal culpability of the female.
At issue in this case is the right of California
to prosecute my client, Michael, for violation of the statute.
The statute provides, and I quote, it prohibits "an act of
sexual intercourse accomplished with a female not the wife of
3

-

-

1

the perpetrator, where the female is under the age of 18

2

years."

3

The operative facts in this case are simply that

4

Michael stands accused of the crime.

5

of the crime and comes before this Court clothed with the

6

presumption of innocence.

7

pending the decision of the Court in this case.

He is currently awaiting trial,

Both California and the United States, as amicus on

8
9

He has not been convicted

behalf of California, have suggested to this Court that Michael

10

is guilty of a crime of which he is not charged; that crime is

1 1

forcible rape.

12

case is unsupported by any judicial finding and is immaterial

13

to the issues presented.

14

cate

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

What was the charge?

I mean, could the

charge possibly embrace forcible as well as statutory?
MR. JILKA:

17

18

And, in my opinion, tends to obfus­

the issue.
QUESTION:

15
16

The suggestion that force existed in this

No, Justice Rehnquist, it could not.

The information which is contained in the appendix is the
charging

document and it clearly states that Michael is

charged with violation of the statute and the elements are
simply that he participated in an act of sexual intercourse
with a female who was under the age of 18.

Forcible rape would

not be a lesser included offense.
QUESTION:

So, as

you

say,

the

suggestion

that force was used is irrelevant because the issue before us
_4_

1

is the constitutional validity of the statute on its face --

2

MR. JILKA:

QUESTION:

MR. JILKA:

MR. JILKA:

9

QUESTION:

1 1

12

13
14
15
16

17
18
19

So it's equally

Well, Your Honor, I -He was not -- I mean, if you're right on

the first --

8

10

-- is that correct?

irrelevant that Michael was 17 years old?

5

7

That's correct, Your Honor.

MR. JILKA:

That's correct, Your Honor.
-- the second follows.
I do believe, however, that we have

fairly presented a limited constitutional question on the
applicability of the statute as applied

to a 17 and a half

year old female who is charged with sexual intercourse with a
16 and a half year old.
QUESTION:
MR. JILKA:

Yes?
I feel that those facts are fairly before

the Court because -QUESTION:
MR. JILKA:
certainly is.

I thought that Michael was a male?
Yes,

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

He is, he

Those facts were alleged in the petition for

20

writ of mandate, and were admitted by the State of California.
21

QUESTION:

Well if we're going to get into the facts

22

of this particular case, then the -- and if this is a question
23

of the constitutionality of the statute as applied, then both
24

the matter that you've been discussing and the age of your
25
-

5

-

1

client are, perhaps, relevant.

2

But if the issue is the constitutional validity of

3

this statute on its face, then neither the alleged facts of

4

this episode, nor the age of the Defendant, are really rele­

5

vant, are they?

6
7

MR. JILKA:

the facial issue of constitutionality goes.
QUESTION:

8
9

10

15

Could he have been charged -- well,

was he charged with a felony?
MR. JILKA:

Yes, Your Honor.

He was charged with a

felony.
QUESTION:

13
14

Counsel, could I ask you a question about

the California situation?

1 1

12

That is correct, Your Honor, as far as

Could he have been charged for a misde­

meanor?
MR. JILKA:

Yes, Your Honor, this statute could have

16

been charged as a misdemeanor in the discretion of the district

17

attorney, the prosecuting authority.

18

If convicted, Michael --

19

QUESTION:

20

21
22
23
24

Mr. Jilka, could I interrupt again,

because I'm always -MR. JILKA:
QUESTION:
constitutionality

Certainly.
-- somewhat puzzled when we talk about
as applied or on the face, the case arises

out of -- doesn't it really involve a test of the legal suffic­
iency or constitutionality of the specific complaint filed

25
-

6-

1

against this man?

2

MR. JILKA:

3

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
So, don't we have to take as true, for

4

purposes of decision, whatever facts are alleged therein?

5

Assuming that --

6

MR. JILKA:

7

QUESTION -- they will prove those and that they will

8

10
1 1

12

13
14

15
16

17

Yes, Your Honor, that's a fair statement.

not have to prove anything not alleged therein?
MR. JILKA:

That's true.

I would, however, point

out that what happened at the trial court was not in the
nature of a demurrer, but it was a motion to dismiss, at which
evidence was presented and primarily the evidence which was
presented was the age of Michael.
QUESTION:

So --

Well that is not -- the age is not in

the complaint itself?
MR. JILKA:

That's correct, it is not part of the

complaint, but it is certainly a matter of record.
If convicted, Michael's conviction would be pred­

18

icated on the existence of essentially four facts.

First of

19

all, that Michael is a male; secondly, that he simply partici­
20

pated in an act of sexual intercourse, that Sharon, his
21

partner, was under the age of 18 years, and fourth, that
22

Michael and Sharon were not married.
23

QUESTION:

Counsel, I am troubled, as apparently

24

some of my colleagues are, by the rather abstract question
25
-

7

-

1

that's presented.

2

information is denied, the case goes to trial.

3
4

5

6

9

10
1 1

And we have

testimony and a verdict, or judges' findings, and it goes on,
up through appeal to the state system and we get it here with
a specific batch of facts, so to speak.

You are simply

challenging the statute on its face?
MR. JILKA:

7

8

Ordinarily, if a motion to dismiss and

Rehnquist.

That's essentially correct, Justice

The California Supreme Court, in exercise of its

original and discretionary jurisdiction, issued an alternative
writ to call that issue before it and decided that very
issue of the facial constitutionality of the statute.

So

when the case comes here, fortunately or unfortunately, it's
12

really without a record below or a very, very limited record.
13

QUESTION:

And all the California Supreme Court said

14

was that, on its face this statute is constitutional?
15

MR. JILKA:

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe

that's an

16

accurate synopsis of the California Supreme Court's opinion.
17

The statute, California Penal Code Section 261.5,
18

embodies and reflects the traditional sexual stereotypes.
19

Because only the male can violate the statute, it is presumed
20

that he is the passionate aggressor, and similarly, conversely,
21

that the female is the helpless victim who needs the pater­
22

nalistic protection of the state and the protection of the
23

statute.

Neither California nor the United States have even

24

attempted to refute that the statute is cast in terms of the
25

1

traditional and outmoded sex roles.
QUESTION:

2
3
4

that isn't outmoded, isn't it, and that is that women can
have children and men can't?
HR. JILKA:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. JILKA:

7

QUESTION:

8
9

10

11

Well, but there -- there is one thing

Yes, Your Honor,

that's certainly true.

Women can become pregnant and men can't?
That is absolutely true, of course.
Is it your basic -- since I've already

interrupted you, is it your basic contention that California
could have enacted a law such as this, if it applied not only
to both men and women, but to people of all ages, victims of
all ages?

12

MR. JILKA:

No, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

Why not?

14

MR. JILKA:

As far as the age criteria goes, that's

15

not challenged.

What we're challenging is the discrimination

16

between males and females.
17

QUESTION:

Well, then is it -- is it your submission

18

that California could have enacted a law such as this if it
19

had applied to victims of both sexes?
20

MR. JILKA:

That's correct.

21

QUESTION:

Under 17?

22

MR. JILKA:

That's correct.

23

QUESTION:

Although the next claim would be that

24

it was unconstitutional for California to do that for people
25

1

2

under 17, when it didn’t do it for people over 17?
MR. JILKA:

That's -- that certainly could be made,

3

Your Honor.

4

because the discrimination --

5

QUESTION:

6
7

8
9

10
1 1

12

13
14

15

I think that that would be a much different case

It would be a different case, but it would

be a constitutional challenge, wouldn't it?
MR. JILKA:

It could be, it certainly could be.

In that case, there would not be discrimination, of course,
on the basis of sex.
QUESTION:

So it's your claim that California, having

-- cannot enact this for the protection of women alone; that if
it- enacts this, it has to go the whole hog and enact it for the
protection of all people of either sex under 17 years old?
MR. JILKA:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And I

believe that has been done in varying forms by at least 37 of
the states.

16

QUESTION:

Wouldn't it follow that a state that

17

passed a law to protect the purchasers of automobiles would
18

have to pass a law to protect the purchasers of dishwashers?
19

MR. JILKA:

Well no, Your Honor, I don't believe so.

20

Certainly not.
21

QUESTION:

Well isn't that pretty much what your

22

argument is?
MR. JILKA:

No, Your Honor.

In this case we're talk­

ing about classifications on the basis of sex, which perpetuate
-

10

-

1

2
3

we feel, the traditional stereotypes.
QUESTION:

Because

California, if it tries to protect

females, must protect males also?

4

MR. JILKA:

5

QUESTION: That the constitution requires it to do so?

6

MR. JILKA:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Then, that would be true of forcible rape

8
9

10
1 1

12

13
14

15
16

Similarly situated males, yes --

Yes, Your Honor, that is our contention.

as well as statutory rape?
MR. JILKA:

Well that certainly could be one of the

logical conclusions of the invalidity of the statute that's
challenged.

I think that, when force is involved, there cer­

tainly is a much different situation before the Court.

But

that's -- that argument has certainly been made, and I believe,
in a recent

Tulane

Law

School

Law

Review

article

that that very hypothesis is set forward.
QUESTION:

Is that right?

MR. JILKA:

That's right.

17

But I do not believe

18

that this Court's invalidation of the statute would necessarily
19

force the conclusion that all forcible rape laws are gender
20

neutral, or must be gender neutral.
21

In fact, in California, the forcible rape law is
22

gender neutral, ironically enough, and so are all of the other
23

statutes that are designed to prevent the sexual exploitation
24

of California citizens.

QUESTION:

this California statute as aiders and abettors?
MR. JILKA:

QUESTION:

6

MR. JILKA:

8
9

10
1 1

12

Yes, that's correct.

As a racial

minority --

5

7

Can women be guilty of the offense under

Accessories?
Yes, that's right, that's right, they

could, certainly, but not as a principal.
QUESTION:

Can the state -- can a state constitu­

tionally make it a criminal act for a woman of, let us say, 30,
to seduce a young boy of 14 or 15?
MR. JILKA:

I would certainly say that that's within

the realm of the state's legitimate concern --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. JILKA:

Most states do, do they not?
Yes, in one form or another; for example,

15

in California, it is a very minor offense, it's contributing

16

to the delinquency of a minor, it's a misdemeanor.

17

Michael, because -- simply because of his sex, now is facing

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

a felony charge.

Whereas

If the sex roles were reversed around, if it

were an older male or a male of any age and a female, there's
heightened criminal penalties.
QUESTION:

You may have answered this before, but if

he had been charged with a misdemeanor instead of a felony,
would you be here?
MR. JILKA:

I don't know.

The procedure that was

utilized in the Supreme Court of California, exercising its
-

12

-

1

original jurisdiction is predicated in the statute and I

2

just don't know if the California Supreme Court would have

3

taken this case had it been in a lower level court; that's

4

problematic.
QUESTION:

5

6
7

8
9

10
1 1

12

Mr. Jilka, can I pursue a question that

Mr. Justice Stewart asked you about washing machines and cars?
Did you focus entirely on protection of the victim being
sex neutral or are you also focusing at all on the punishment?
In other words, are you in effect arguing that it would be
unconstitutional to have a statute that said it's unlawful for
men to steal cars but there is no prohibition against women
stealing cars?
MR. JILKA:

I think that would follow, Your Honor;

13

certainly.
14

QUESTION:

That's more, that's your position?

QUESTION:

But you told us that women can be guilty

15
16

of violating this statute?
17

MR. JILKA:

As an aider and abettor, that's true.

QUESTION:

And California, does -- does California

18
19

generally treat aiders and abettors the same as principals, as
20

far as sentences go?
21

MR. JILKA:

I guess I could not, in honesty, answer

that question.
QUESTION:

Do you know the federal criminal law

generally does?
-

13

-

MR. JILKA:

1

Yes, well, the penalties that are

2

prescribed are the same for aiders and abettors as for the

3

principals, certainly, if thdt's your question, yes.
I would point out to the case, a new Eighth Circuit

4

5

opinion in a case called Navedo v. Preisser, which was de­

6

cided on September 22nd of this year, in which the Eighth

7

Circuit invalidated the Iowa statutory rape law.

8

a different statutory rape law than California, certainly, but

9

I think that some of the reasoning certainly applies here.
In considering the pregnancy --

10
1 1

12

13
14

QUESTION:

That case is not in your brief, I gather?

MR. JILKA:

No, Your Honor, it's a recent case; it

was after the brief, it was decided September 22nd, 1980, in
the Eighth Circuit.
QUESTION:

15

MR. JILKA:

16

17

That was

What's the style of it, the citation?
Navedo, N-a-v-e-d-o v. Preisser, and I

could provide the Court with the case number.
QUESTION:

18

MR. JILKA:

Will you do that?
I certainly will, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

Preisser?

20

MR. JILKA:

Yes, it's P-r-e-i-s-s-e-r, is the second

21

name.

The first is Navedo, N-a-v-e-d-o.

MR. JILKA:

QUESTION:

10

MR. JILKA:

11

QUESTION:

I don't believe so, Your Honor -Why not?
Well because, -What's the discrimination if both the

12

male and the female can be punished equally and there can't be

13

a crime unless they are both liable for some kind of punish­

14

ment?
MR. JILKA:

15

Well a male and a female can be punished

16

equally only if the female aids and abets the male in perform­

17

ing an act of sexual intercourse with a female under the age

MR. JILKA:

4

QUESTION:

5

That's certainly correct.
And you're not challenging that?
That's correct.
If it's voluntary, then don't you, by

hypothesis, have an aiding and abetting situation?
MR. JILKA:

6

I suppose so, Your Honor.

However, I

would represent to the Court that in practice, that the victim,

the purported victim is never charged with a crime.

Oh, I would certainly agree with that,

There are -- we estimate that there are probably

more -QUESTION:
MR. JILKA:
QUESTION:

So that's no answer, in other words.
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
So your answer to my brother Stevens was

really no answer to his question.
QUESTION: Moreover I imagine that in these states

19

that have sex neutral statutes like this, probably most of the
20

prosecutions are males anyway.
21

MR. JILKA: I don't know that to be true,

Your Honor,

22

but that certainly could be.
23

I suppose the point that I was trying to make was
24

that the engaging in sexual conduct -- sexual intercourse

for

1

a male and a female is basically the same act, a mutual

2

for a male under the same circumstances it's a felony, but

3

for the female to participate, it is not.

4

believe that a female can and would be charged as an aider and

5

abettor, a female so-called victim.
QUESTION:

6

And I do not

There is a case in the federal system that

7

said

could be guilty of conspiracy of her own -- to carrying on

9

her own transportation in interstate commerce for immoral

1 1

that

act;

the so-called victim in a Mann Act prosecution,

purposes; wouldn't the same principal apply?
MR. JILKA:

I don't believe that it has been applied

12

Your Honor, and I -- in California, Your Honor -- and I don't

13

have the case authority for that, I certainly wish I did.

14

But I believe that to be the case, that the female is in

15

practice and in law not considered to be culpable as an aider

16

and abettor. That is the female victim, excuse me.

17

QUESTION:

Would your case still survive if Cali­

18

fornia had a statute that, contributing to the delinquency of

19

a minor boy was a felony?

24

25

MR. JILKA:
QUESTION:
MR. JILKA:

It may, it may.
When?

What doubt do you have about it?

Well the doubt that I would have would

be if the substantive elements of the crime were identical and
the purposes were identical, then arguably there would be no
discrimination against males, or there would be no unequal

17

-

1

2

treatment of the sexes, but that is not the case -QUESTION:

If the range of sentences were the

3

same for both the present statute and the one I hypothesized

4

would there by any difference?

5

MR. JILKA:

If the sentences were the same and

6

the substantive elements of the crime were the same, I think

7

that we would have great difficulty with an equal protection

8

tack -- I agree.

9

I would point out to the Court that the California

10

case law resoundingly demonstrates that the motivation for

11

the enactment

12

of young girls and not the pregnancy prevention rationale.

13

I would point out the cases cited at pages 25 and 26 of the

brief of the Petitioner.

But once, in a case, discrimination on

the basis of sex is made out, then the burden shifts to the

at the same material and come to a different conclusion.
19

MR. JILKA:

Well not exactly, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

20

The most recent California Supreme Court case is only 1964,
21

it's not an old case.

The most recent Court of Appeals case is

MR. JILKA:

QUESTION:

Regardless of the original purpose or the

present purpose or whatever this California Supreme Court said
about its purpose, the duty of this Court is to look at the
statute and its impact and, depending upon, as I say, the
level of so-called scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause
to decide whether or not the statute is rationally based.
Isn’t that about it?

22

MR. JILKA:

Well, essentially, Your Honor, I believe

there is language in the Court's opinions in the past that do
delve into the purposes of the statutes and whether or not

Is there any legislative history of this

Most states have no legislative history

of the kind that we find in the Congress, generally, isn't
that so?
MR. JILKA:
QUESTION:

That is my understanding.
So does that have some connection with

the general proposition that if there is any rational basis
which the Court can see for the legislation, then there is an
obligation to sustain it?
MR. JILKA:

Well I think as a general proposition

that that is certainly correct.

However, because discrimina­

18

tion in this case is based upon sex that the burden is on the
19

government to make out the claimed justification.

Of course,

20

our argument here is that this is based on heightened scrutiny

because of the disparate effect that this has on California

But as I understood your answer to one of

my earlier questions, you don't attack this statute on the

That is correct.

not?

MR. JILKA:

That is correct.

if we accept the purpose of the statute as announced by the

State Supreme Court in this case? Justice Mosk didn't seem to

think so.

If

it please the Court, I'd like to --

22

25

I think that it would be impossible

the classification of the statute is substantially related to
that purpose because it's quite overinclusive -- it punishes
conduct which cannot result in pregnancy.
QUESTION:
MR. JILKA:

Well, what if it is overinclusive?
Well the test, as I understand it, is

that the classifications

have

to be substantially related.

In

this case, sex, the male gender is essentially used as a

proxy for culpability, and we contend that that's an imperfect

There is a weak congruence.

to the consequences rather than the reason for the conduct and

bility .

MR. JILKA:

Certainly, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but

is hazardous that is not hazardous for females.

7

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

8

10
11

12

13
14

15
16

MR, KRIEGLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I am Deputy Attorney General Sandy R. Kriegler,
appearing today on behalf of the people of the State of Cali­
fornia, real party in interest.
I would like to discuss the constitutionality of
California Penal Code Section 261.5, in light of the tests
set forth by this Court for gender based classifications, in
Craig v. Boren.
Under Craig v. Boren, classifications based upon

17

gender are constitutional if they serve important governmental
18

objectives, and if the classification scheme is substantially
19

related to the achievement of those objectives.

This Court

20

has recognized that classifications based upon gender are not
21

invalid, per se.

Indeed, where the sexes are not similarly

22

situated or in those situations where society imposes special
23

burdens upon females, different treatment is allowed.
24

We believe that the classification under the statute
25
-

27

-

1

before the Court today is based upon physiological differences

2

which do not reflect the type of invidious discrimination

3

which the Equal Protection Clause prohibits.

4

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Kriegler, do prosecutors in California

always press these as felonies?

6

MR. KRIEGLER:

7

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

Well, where is the line of distinction?

8

Here you have two young people about the same age, one year

9

and 18 days apart, and you press it as a felony?
MR. KRIEGLER:

10

I believe it was pressed as a felony

11

in this case due to the particular facts involved.

12

particular facts are revealed in the appendix -QUESTION:

13

And these

Well I read the appendix thoroughly and

14

I would say the particular facts would seem to cut the other

15

way.
MR. KRIEGLER:

16

Well Your Honor, the prosecutor

17

obviously disagreed based upon the fact that the victim clearly

18

testified, under oath at the preliminary hearing, that she

19

submitted to the act of intercourse only after being slugged

20
21

22
23
24

25

in the face 2 to 3 times with sufficient force to leave bruises
We believe that this case, while it is not perhaps sufficient
to constitute a forcible rape, or at least the prosecutor who
filed the charges did not feel so, it certainly approached
that.

And it was above the level of

consensual intercourse,

that one might normally expect to be involved in a situation
-

28

-

1

involving two minors.

2
3
4

5

6

Certainly,

the use of force, I feel, was the crucial

factor in the prosecutor's decision to file this case as a
felony.

I would point out, however, to the Court that the

case was originally filed in Juvenile Court, and the Peti­
tioner was found unfit for treatment under the Juvenile Court

7

law and then it came to adult court.

8

was not even as a felony, it was under our Juvenile Court law

9

under which there are no felonies or misdemeanors;

10

So the initial filing

it is not a

criminal branch of our judiciary.

1 1

We believe that the important governmental interests

12

served by Penal Code Section 261.5 are the deterrence of teen­

13

age pregnancy, the prevention of physical injury to minor

14

females from sexual intercourse.

15

QUESTION:

Mr.

Kriegler, would either of those

16

purposes be served any less well by a statute that was entirely

17

neutral that applied to the female as well as the male?

18

MR. KRIEGLER:

Absolutely, Your Honor, particularly

19

in this case.

If our statute were gender neutral in this case,

20

the victim, Sharon, would be, at least on the face of the

21

statute, subject to prosecution.

22

secution, first of ail,

If she were subject to pro­

she would be less likely to report the

incident, because to do so would be to incriminate herself.

Also, she might be less anxious to commit

it, too, wouldn't she?

Did you say she was not a willing par­

10

MR. KRIEGLER:

11

QUESTION:

12

She was not a willing participant.

Well doesn't the Appendix show that

she began the intimacies?
MR. KRIEGLER:

13

Your Honor, she engaged in a certain

14

amount of kissing, apparently, from the record, with the

Defendant.

objected to and sustained.
MR. KRIEGLER:

that he used in the preliminary hearing.

20

that she did not wish to go further and proceed to an act of

21

intercourse.

22

of the potential pregnancy, she was not willing to engage in

the act, at least as far as the record that's before this

MR. KRIEGLER:

QUESTION:

When you say the record may show, doesn't

the record actually show that she rode around in the police
car to pick him out on the street?
MR. KRIEGLER:
QUESTION:

Doesn't the record show that?

MR. KRIEGLER:
QUESTION:

That --

Yes, Your Honor.

Well you don't go around looking for

9

people that you know, do you? You go to their home or where
10

ever they are to pick them out.
11

MR. KRIEGLER:

Well all I'm saying is, she may have

12

been familiar with the individual, I don't know that she was
13

a personal friend or a close aquaintance -14

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Kriegler, if the issue before

15

us is the constitutional validity on its face of this Cali­
16

fornia legislation, what in the world do the facts of this
17

case have to do with it?
18

MR. KRIEGLER:

Well we believe the statute is con­

19

stitutional on its face for the reasons set forth by the
20

California Supreme Court.

It is Petitioner who has come

21

before this Court urging that the statute is unconstitutional
22

as applied to him because he is also a minor.

That is the only

23

reason that the as-applied argument is being made.
24

But If the facts have any relevancy at

to prosecute on a felony or a misdemeanor, isn't that

And that issue is not before us.

MR. KRIEGLER:

6

We agree.

Only the constitution­

And our only point would

7

be'that insofar as Petitioner is pursuing the argument that

8

the statute is unconstitutional as applied to him as a 17-year

9

old, he cannot have it both ways; he cannot straddle the fence

10

and say it's unconstitutional to apply this to me as a minor,

11

on the other hand ignoring the specific conduct that he engaged

12

in -QUESTION:

13

Well why not?

It's perfectly apparent

14

on the face of the statute that it would apply to a consensual

15

act between 17-year olds.

That is not the facts before this

The statute on its face applies to all forms of -QUESTION:

But do you not defend the constitution­

ality of the statute as applied to a consensual act between
two 17-year olds of opposite sexes who are equally culpable?
QUESTION:

Yes, you do.

MR. KRIEGLER:
QUESTION:

Yes, we certainly do.

They why do we have to argue about any­

thing else?
MR. KRIEGLER:

Because it's important to point out,
-

32

-

1

3

in this case, the two 17-year olds were not equally culpable.
QUESTION:

Well why is it important if you're

defending the statute --

How do we know that?

-- instead of the prosecution?

-- and there's been no trial and no

9

You're just --

finding of fact, so we don't know whether that's true or not.
MR. KRIEGLER:
has been no trial.

That is correct, Your Honor, there

However, whether the parties are engaged

10

in the type of conduct that occurred in this case or as Your

11

Honor suggests, whether we view the statute on its face, we

12

submit that the statute is nonetheless constitutional because

13

it serves these two important governmental interests that I

14

have mentioned and --

15

QUESTION:

You say that the reason it serves it

16

better than a sex neutral statute is that after the act has

17

been committed, then there's a greater likelihood that it

18

will be reported by the female?

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

MR. KRIEGLER:
QUESTION:

Right --

But in terms of the deterrence of the

conduct itself, is it not clear that if the penalty applied
to both, there would be less likelihood of the risk-creating
conduct taking place?

Right.

I don't think that necessarily follows

it be rational for a parent to

MR. KRIEGLER:

isn't it?

But it takes two participants every time

the act is performed, doesn't it?

MR. KRIEGLER:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, it does, it certainly does.

And if it's consensual, why should one

be punished and not the other one?
MR. KRIEGLER:

One should be punished because the

California legislature has determined that the female bears
these extraordinary risks from the act of intercourse; because

Has the legislature reasonably concluded

6

that those risks have been sufficient to deter females from

7

voluntarily engaging in this kind of conduct?

8
9

MR. KRIEGLER:

Well, the question of deterrence is

one that is very difficult to answer; we don't know how many

10

people have or have not been deterred by the existence of this

1 1

statute, or any other statute.

12

QUESTION:

Not very many have.

13

The point is, must be, I think, that

Yes, it is, Mr. Justice Stewart.

Well, Mr. Attorney General, the first

statute was passed in 1850, right?

And it applied to girls 10 years old,

right?

MR. KRIEGLER:

5

QUESTION:

6

Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall.

That is correct.

Is there any literature that shows that

there was a rash of pregnancies among 9 year olds in 1850?

7

MR. KRIEGLER:

No.

We are quite confident that the

8

statute as originally enacted in 1950 was intended to prevent

9

physical injury to minor females, 9 year olds certainly, at

10

that time --

you answer.
MR. KRIEGLER:

Fine.

The statute, Mr. Justice

Marshall, was amended incrementally, at three stages:

concrete legislative history to support the reasoning for

points I would like to make in regard to the question of

legislative intent, if I might?

3

QUESTION:

Sure.

4

MR. KRIEGLER:

In 1967, California passed its Thera­

5

peutic Abortion Act, and that is cited in our brief.

6

that of course was well prior to the time that this Court

7

enunciated the rule that abortions were constitutionally man­

8

dated -- must be made available.

9

And

In that act, the one category of victim that was

10

specifically named as being unconditionally eligible for

11

abortion was statutory rape victims under our former statutory

12

rape law; California Penal Code Section 261 Subdivision 1.

13

Because that particular category of victim under Section 261

14

Subdivision 1, was specifically singled out as being eligible

15

for abortion, we believe that it's very clear at least at that

16

time, the legislature perceived the purpose of the statutory

17

rape law, at least in part, as being intended to deter teenage

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

pregnancies.
QUESTION:

Did it change its statute?

MR. KRIEGLER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Subsequently the

statute was repealed -QUESTION:

Subsequently?

MR. KRIEGLER:

Yes, in 1970, as a matter of fact,

the present edition of the statute, Penal Code Section 261.5,
was enacted, it was taken out of the former rape section, and

25
-

37

-

1

it was called unlawful sexual intercourse.

2

since that occurred three years after the legislative defer-

ration of -- the connection between statutory rape and teenage
pregnancy -QUESTION:

Three years later?

Yes, Your Honor.

It wasn't the same legislature, either.

MR. KRIEGLER:

8
9

We believe that

No, Your Honor, it was not the same

But certainly, I think, that is the most recent

indication, at least at that time, of what the legislatures'
10

thinking was in regards to the purpose of the statutory rape
1 1

law.

I would also point --

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Kriegler, really, I don't -- I either

13

didn't understand in reading your briefs, or your opponent's
14

briefs, why you run away from the idea that the purpose of
15

this statute is to protect the chastity of minor females and
16

don't face up to the fact that your opponent argues that
17

California is constitutionally prohibited from passing such
18

legislation unless it also protects -- legislation to protect
19

the chastity of minor males.
20

MR. KRIEGLER:

Well first of all --

21

QUESTION:

That's the argument.

22

MR. KRIEGLER:

I don't think that is the intent of

23

the legislature in this case.

First of all, because there's --

MR. KRIEGLER:

Well,

there's no chastity requirement in our statute, number one.
QUESTION:

Well why then, all these statistics on

the great rise in pregnancies of unmarried teenagers, 12-13-14
years old, if that wasn't related to the legislatures' purpose?
MR. KRIEGLER:

Well, certainly there is a direct

correlation between the frequency of intercourse today and the
resulting pregnancies; I don't think there's any dispute
about that.
My point is -QUESTION:

According to the opinion of others I thoug ht

that California's position was that the California legislature
12

has a right to try to protect minor children, females, from the
13

whole range of consequences of this kind of conduct?
14

MR. KRIEGLER:

That is correct, and we also protect

15

minor males.

I don't want to leave this Court with the false--

16

QUESTION:

Well in this case, you protect only

17

females, because it applies only when females are victims.

MR. KRIEGLER:

Because of --

QUESTION:

But the argument is that California is

20

constitutionally disabled from enacting any such legislation
21

and that it is constitutionally required to protect also minor
22

males, if it protects minor females.

Now that's a very odd

23

argument, and you haven't done it at all.
24

MR. KRIEGLER:

Well, our response is that California

Then Mr. Justice Stewart is suggesting

you should face up to that, and I'm wondering whether, in
facing up to that, you are contending there is a distinction

morality of the act, depending on the sex of

QUESTION:

California legislature determined to

3

protect the chastity of minor females, not of all people of

4

all ages, or of both sexes, and your opponent's argument is

5

that California is constitutionally required, if it protects

6

minor females to at least protect minor males.

7

have here the question of whether it also is constitutionally

8

required to protect the chastity of males and females of all

9

ages but that would be the next case.

don't

You certainly must argue -- you certainly

1 1

must argue that the consequences, apart from any moral issue,

the consequences socially, economically and in various other

No.

Thank you, Mr. Justice White.

Well, now, go ahead and make it now, if

you are ready to.

MR. KRIEGLER:

Once the statutory purposes of

deterring these teenage pregnancies, and as Mr. Chief Justice

QUESTION:

Is it your argument that there would be

less of a deterrent if it was also unlawful for the female to
engage in sexual intercourse at this age; that that would be
a lesser deterrent to pregnancy?

The consequences are medically disastrous

I think there would be a problem

involved in it, and I started to answer, I think, the same
question a little bit earlier and I didn't quite get to com­

12

plete my answer.

First --

13

QUESTION:

Enforcement problem, you've identified

14

that.
15

MR. KRIEGLER:

Well, it even goes beyond the prob­

16

lem of reporting.

If the statute were gender neutral, the

17

female would be culpable also as an aider and abettor, or a
18

principal, in this case.

That creates problems of who is the

19

state going to prosecute; the male or the female?

Well that's

20

a judgment call on the part of prosecutors.

You start getting

21

into the question of is this particular case a discriminatory
22

prosecution?

So we have a hearing in which this minor female

23

who is supposed to be protected by the statute, goes through
24

all the facts again and we decide whether it's a discriminatory
25
-

42

-

1

prosecution or not.

2

should be protected under the statute, that creates another

3

problem in California, because she, as an accomplice or an

4

aider or abettor, must have her testimony corroborated under

5

California Penal Code Section 111.1.

6

her testimony standing by itself won't be sufficient to con­

7

stitute

8

law.

But even if we were to say that she

These acts are, by and large, committed in privacy.

This would be a very substantial problem for the state of

1 1

statute.

13

majority of these cases, the perpetrator is the adult -- is

14

an adult.

15

that it's a very rare case indeed that a minor male is pro­

16

secuted.

Perhaps only one -QUESTION:

But in terms of the actual conduct you

18

seek to deter, you don't have statistics about that, do you?

19

I mean, isn't there a large volume of conduct in which the

20
21

22
23
24

25

participants are both young persons?
HR. KRIEGLER:

I'm sure there is, Your Honor, yes.

I don't think we can deny that fact.
QUESTION:

And you think that you would not be as

equally effective in deterring that conduct if you also imposed
a penalty on the female for engaging in it?

You may have a

rational basis for the prohibition, but you have to justify
why do we make it just as to one and not the other?
MR. KRIEGLER:

Well I think it goes beyond the

10

enforcement problems. There I come back to our original point,
1 1

the statute is based upon deterring the particular harmful -12

QUESTION:

Let me give you an example which I've

13

reflected on.

Supposing you had a law that made it reckless

14

driving to drive on a motorcycle at excessive rate of speed.
15

And you said well, if a person doesn't wear a helmet, he'll
16

suffer greater harm if he has an accident, so we will exclude
17

people who do not wear helmets from the prohibition against
18

reckless driving.

Under your rationale that would be a per­

19

fectly reasonable exclusion, is that not right?
20

MR. KRIEGLER:

I — I —

21

QUESTION:

Because they suffer a greater risk of

22

harm, therefore you don't need to deter them with legal sanc­

tions ?
24

MR. KRIEGLER:

Well, I don't think that necessarily

25

- 44-

1

follows.
QUESTION:

And that's your argument about the female;

she suffers a greater risk of harm, and therefore, she should

4

not be deterred.

5

young she is, that she should not do this.

6

She should know intelligently, no matter how

MR. KRIEGLER:

Well, this statute, Your Honor, is

7

consistent with all of the California laws which prohibit

8

sexual offenses with minors, whether they be male or females.

9

Under California law where the minor is protected from acts

10

involving lewd or lascivious conduct, or annoying or molesting

1 1

that child or other acts of sex perversion, it matters not

12

whether the minor who engages in those acts with the adult

13

counterpart is acting consensually or not.

14

there for the protection of that particular individual, because

15

of the consequences of the act.

16

the act is consensual or not; the severe consequences to the

17

minor victim in all of our California statutes, are recognized,

18

because the minors are not treated as being culpable for the

19

crime that's committed.

When the female in this case is properly viewed as
the victim and is properly viewed as suffering disparate
consequences from the act of intercourse, none of which what­
ever are borne by the male who engages in the act of inter­
course, we believe that the statute does not contain -QUESTION:

MR. KRIEGLER:

Well I think that's pretty tenuous,

particularly in this case, where, you know, we have a minor
male participant.
QUESTION:

I really -Could I ask you -- could I ask you,

suppose a young man, a teenager, is on trial under this statute
and he's tried before the judge, and he defends on the ground
that the statute as applied to him is unconstitutional because
in this case the woman was the aggressor, and that he surely
-

46

-

shouldn't be punished in those circumstances and the judge
1

finds yes, the woman was the aggressor, and is much more culp­

able and blameworthy in the case, but nevertheless says this

statute requires it and this statute is constitutional.

I

suppose you must defend the statute, even in those circum­
5

stances?
6

MR. KRIEGLER:

Yes, we would, for the same reasons

that I stated previously.

But I would like to point out, and

8

emphasize this fact most strongly to the Court, after all the
9

research that has been done in this case, Petitioner has yet
10

to cite to a single instance where the statute has been applied
11

in an unfair manner as suggested by Mr. Justice White's ques­

as applied, but on its face, and nothing else.

13

We're not dealing with this case of the statute

MR. KRIEGLER:

Correct, Your Honor.

We would strongly

urge this Court to recognize the severe consequences that

15

befall only the teenage female participant in an act of inter­

16

course, regardless of the age of the male participant.

17

with the Court being aware, as it is, of the consequences of

18

teenage pregnancy, I don't need to remind the Court certainly

19

of the statements made in earlier cases.

20
