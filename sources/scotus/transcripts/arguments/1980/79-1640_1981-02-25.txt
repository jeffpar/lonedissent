Borough of Mount Ephraim.

Mr. Levy, I think you may proceed whenever you are

MR. LEVY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The appellant in this matter is a business enter­
prise that commenced its business in the Borough of Mount

12

Ephraim in 1973.

13

that was in effect.

14

We will hear arguments

At that time there was a zoning ordinance
The business of the appellant was that

it sold at retail books, magazines, and films, and at the

15

same time it operated an enterprise that is referred to as

16

a peepshow operation.

17

booths which have a projector and a screen upon which images

18

can be seen.

QUESTION:

These are booths which are individual

Is this what is euphemistically called

an adult bookstore?
MR.

LEVY:

Euphemistically, realistically, and

directly, sir, it's called an adult bookstore.
In 1976, some three years after it began this
operation, it attempted to expand that operation by having
the equivalent of film, or in the same location as the film,

Ephraim in Burlington?

4

MR. LEVY:

Pardon, sir?

5

QUESTION:

What county is Mount Ephraim in?

6

I

should know --

7

MR. LEVY:

This is in Camden County, Judge.

8

QUESTION:

Oh, is it in Camden?

9

MR. LEVY:

It's in Camden County, sir.

10

QUESTION:

Where?

11

MR. LEVY:

It is to the south, and, I believe, to

12

South of the city?

the east of the city.

13

QUESTION:

Small?

14

MR. LEVY:

It's on the Black Horse Pike on the way

15

to Atlantic City from the Camden-Philadelphia area.

16

QUESTION:

And a very small borough, isn't it?

17

MR. LEVY:

It's a small borough.

It's about 17

18

miles, I would estimate, from the city of Camden and from the

19

river which divides Pennsylvania from New Jersey.

20
21

QUESTION:
Mount Ephraim?

22

Would you tell us a little more about

How's it zoned and so on?

MR. LEVY:

It's zoned, if I understand, sir, in

23

two zones.

24

both multifamily and single family in a residential zone,

25

and then it has a commercial zone.

It has a residential zone and it provides for

The Black Horse Pike,

1

which is the main artery between Camden and Atlantic City,

cuts right through the borough.

of the Black Horse Pike you have a commercial zone, and then

the balance of the community is residential, either multi-

5

or single-family.

For 250 feet on each side

It does not have any zone that provides
It's solely commercial.

QUESTION:

Commercial or, and residential?

MR. LEVY:

And/or residential.

And what's its population?

MR. LEVY:

May I call on my --

MR. FISHMAN:

Less than 5,000 people, Your Honor.

And do the residents live and work --

MR. LEVY:

Do they work in the commu­

I think that they would have to go

17

beyond the borough of Mount Ephraim in order to provide

18

sufficient occupations for the --

19

QUESTION:

Except, of course, for your

client and

20

others similarly situated, who run commercial establishments

21

in the community?

22

MR. LEVY-

That's right.

There are, along the

23

entire length of the Black Horse Pike, on both sides, it is

24

commercially occupied and active.

25

MR. LEVY:

I would think not.

I think that maybe :

It is certainly, I think --

5

QUESTION:

But not now?

6

MR. LEVY:

-- more suburban than it is urban.

7

QUESTION:

What sort of commercial establishments

8

are permitted?

Are there motion picture theaters and -- ?

MR. LEVY:

9

There is a motion picture theater.

10

There are restaurants.

There are car showrooms, used car

11

showrooms.

12

discount-type stores that can be found within the community.

There are basically supermarket-type as well as

13

QUESTION:

And taverns?

14

MR. LEVY:

Taverns?

15

QUESTION:

Restaurants?

16

MR. LEVY:

There are taverns, there are restaurants

Yes.

17

with liquor licenses, and within some of those there is the

18

live entertainment about which we had some colloquy in the

19

lower courts.

20

At the time that we went ahead and we put in the

21

peepshow operation we did it on the strength of the content

22

of the zoning ordinance.

23

said that there was no objection at all to what has now been

24

determined to be other than live entertainment.

25

then confronted with the fact that live entertainment is not

Now, an ad hoc determination has obviously been

10
11

made that commercial live entertainment across the board is

12

not a permitted use, but somehow or other commercial non-live

13

entertainment, which includes the motion picture theater,

14

which includes the fact that we have been providing in the

15

peepshow booths a nonlive type of operation.
Now, to carry on the anomaly of this, if we were to

16
17

go along with what has been proposed to us, it is not possible

18

for me to show a young lady dancing alive, nude or otherwise,

19

but that I could have taken a videotape of that earlier in

20

the morning and I could present the exact same performance on

21

videotape in the same booth.
Now, the question became, and I think it's a

22
23

threshold question, do we have a First Amendment situation

24

here?

25

we are proposing specifically, and with respect to all other

not in and of itself immediately then set forth that there

is no First Amendment issue?

Because if we do, then the fact that there is a

What we have here is a zoning issue, but it's a

zoning issue where in the very terms of that zoning ordi­

finally a total prohibition of

form of communication.

The ordinance in question is the one that

appears on page 3 of your brief, is it?
MR. LEVY:

Yes, sir, at 99-15B, I believe, is its

designation.
QUESTION:

All right.

Then it's 99-15B, -B(l).

15

And then follows by saying "all uses not expressly permitted

16

are prohibited."

17

MR. LEVY:

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

And I suppose "dinners" means "diners,"

19

doesn't it?

20

breakfast and lunch.

21

I don't see flower stores, for example.

22

I suppose

MR. LEVY:

that these restaurants can serve
But, for example -- well, let's see.
Are they prohibited?

If that is to be interpreted as it's

23

presently being interpreted, I would Imagine that if you had

dead flowers they would be permitted, but live ones, because

25

they are live entertainment -8

QUESTION:
"flowers."

But on the sixth line it refers to

I suppose that would cover florists.

5

QUESTION:

Moving picture theaters?

6

MR. LEVY:

No, sir.

QUESTION:

Is there one in the city?

MR. LEVY:

There is one.

Nurseries, but

not florists.

Well, nurseries is here.

Are they here?

It's right on the Black

Horse Pike and would be just somewhat to the east of our
location.

11

QUESTION:

Are newsstands here?

12

MR. LEVY:

I do not see them here.

13

QUESTION:

Bookstores?

14

MR. LEVY:

Books are allowed to be sold -- between

15

Yes, books are.

gifts and stationery

16

QUESTION:

Yes .

17

QUESTION:

What is your contention that is defec-

18

tive in this zoning ordinance or in this conviction of your

19

client?

20

MR. LEVY:

I've had the problem from the outset,

21

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I cannot literally come here and say

22

to you that this ordinance is defective as it's written.

23

As it's written, there doesn't seem to be a defect.

24

is being interpreted and applied, there seems to be an

25

infringement on First Amendment rights by setting forth
9

As it

1

that everything that's not expressly permitted here, they

2

are literally then coming forth and saying, that bookstores

3

or means of live communication offerings are not permitted.

4

Therefore I am in a quandary because I can't say to you that

5

this is defective and therefore has to be declared invalid,

6

but I must say that if this is the springboard for the posi­

7

tion they've taken, that there has to be a curbing on the

8

interpretation that is being placed.

9

tion I stress, because the building inspector, who may be

The ad hoc determina­

10

the source of our original complaints, changes.

11

to time officials do change and the next one may come along

12

and read it even more severely and now say, from this text,

13

even nonlive entertainment is going to be prohibited.

14
15

QUESTION:

Well,

the

From time

courts of New Jersey have

interpreted this ordinance to forbid what you want to do.

16

MR. LEVY:

Exactly.

17

QUESTION:

So it's been officially interpreted and

18
19

applied to you, your client.
MR. LEVY:

If the lack of any issue ever reaching

20

a court with respect to what we do in this location is the

21

equivalent of having approved what we're doing, it may well

22

be that if they're sustained with this ordinance on the basis

23

of live, that they

24

of this ordinance now attack nonlive.

25

QUESTION:

can

come back tomorrow and on the basis

Are you attacking this ordinance on its

1

face, or as applied to you?
HR. LEVY:

2

As applied to us, and as applied

3

across the board.

4

citizen with respect to any ordinance that either as written

5

or applied would have any sort of effect of restraint on

6

First Amendment rights.
QUESTION:

7

I feel that we do have standing just as a

Well, it's been applied to you because

8

you're wanting to show what the courts of New Jersey have

9

held to be live entertainment, and that is banned by this

10

ordinance.

11

MR. LEVY:

That's correct.

12

QUESTION:

And so, as applied to you, you're

13

claiming that the ordinance is unconstitutional.
MR. LEVY:

14

15

There is no question that we are arguing

about its application to us.
QUESTION:

16

And then you also say, I suppose, that

17

you're entitled because it's a First Amendment case to say

18

that because it also bans bookstores, that the ordinance is

19

invalid?

20

MR. LEVY:

No, it doesn't ban bookstores.

21

QUESTION:

Well, I mean -- well, you mean as

MR. LEVY:

As applied, as we look at this ordinance,

22
23

applied?

24

the fair warning that we would normally be entitled to when

25

we are beginning to use our enterprise, I look at this
11

1

ordinance and I realize that for three years I've been

2

allowed to offer --

3

QUESTION:

How"do you know it doesn't ban book­

MR. LEVY:

Because it specifically sets forth that

4

stores?

5

6

as a permitted use there are books.

On page 3.

7

QUESTION:

I see.

8

QUESTION:

Well, do you contend that a town such

9
10

All right.

as Mount Ephraim could not totally ban any commercial enter­
prise?

11

MR. LEVY:

No.

What happens is this:

were we to

12

have an ordinance before us that deals with the desire to

13

form a noncommercial entity, I would have some difficulty

14

setting forth that there has been an infringement upon our

15

rights.

16

prise, then I think the burden is on the community to justify

17

the elimination of some and the propagation or fostering of

18

others.

19

One is, can they do it?

20

zoning ordinances.

21

than that which is the regulation of freedom of speech.

22

And therefore this is an omnibus-type zoning ordinance.

23

concept is to develop the community, and therefore it is not

24

directed toward the regulation of freedom of speech.

25

The moment the door is open to commercial enter­

And we do have some rules that will set that forth.
Yes, they are empowered to enact

Secondly, that it must be a purpose other

The third aspect, however, the moment they open
12

The

1

that unit to commercial enterprises, is there a substantial,

2

compelling reason that's being advanced by the enactment of

3

this ordinance and is there any other way in which that could

4

have been accomplished,

5

other than by the total ban?

6

when we look around the entire country and we realize that

7

live entertainment is basically the rule, not the exception,

8

it is obvious that in the light of regulation there are less

9

stringent methods of coping and curbing live entertainment,

10

the furthering of that purpose,
And actually, in this instance,

not its total ban.
And if we get into the question again where

11
12

a community wants to restrict something and allow others,

13

into time, place, and manner, I submit that there must be

14

the existence of that which is going to be regulated, and if

15

it doesn't exist then there can't be any implication of time,

16

place, or manner.
QUESTION:

17

Well, you can say it's a time, place,

18

and manner provision in the sense that it permits entertain­

19

ment in certain ways, but it doesn't permit live entertain­

20

ment .

21

MR. LEVY:

All right.

Let's submit that if it were

22

to set forth that, if they had given us the benefit of an

23

enactment, where time, place, and manner sets forth, no live,

24

at least under those circumstances we could begin to question

25

why there is the restriction on live as opposed to
13

1

2

nonrestriction of anything else.
QUESTION:

I don't know why you

aren't in a posi­

3

tion to make that argument now, because that's why your

4

operation is in trouble on account of the ordinance, because

5

it is live entertainment according to the authorities.

6

MR. LEVY:

According to their reading of it.

They

7

claim that there is a restriction on live entertainment.

8

We have set it forth, we have set forth in our due process

9

an equal protection of the law argument here that there is

10

no rational distinction that has been set forth and if there

11

be the ability to rationally distinguish between live and

12

nonlive entertainment, we must note the compelling force

13

that led to that distinction to see if it's furthered.

14

is more inimical to the purposes of zoning than if we can

15

show the same performance on film and can't show it alive?

16

What

Now, if we get into the questions that arose in

17

something like California v. LaRue, where there at least

18

were hearings and there was a full setting forth of what it

19

is that was the concern of the community and what they wanted

20

to eliminate --

21
22

QUESTION:

That wasn't a First Amendment case,

really, was it?

23

QUESTION:

That was the 21st Amendment.

24

MR. LEVY:

Yes, but isn't -- well, it was First

25

Amendment, but then it was also -14

1

QUESTION:

No, it

MR. LEVY:

-- one that dealt with the 21st Amend-

QUESTION:

The 21st Amendment was what controlled

MR. LEVY:

Well, what happened is that it originally

ment.

4
5

6

LaRue.

7

got up before the court, I think it started, at least the

8

people who were affected basically by LaRue -- were

9

in terms of First Amendment -- and we found now that there

10

was an interplay between the First and the 21st Amendment.

1 1

And then we found out --

12

QUESTION:

talking

I would think that LaRue reflects the

13

idea that a state may prohibit the sale of salted peanuts or

14

potato chips in a bar if it wants to.

15

MR. LEVY:

All right.

I have no problem with that,

16

but I think before we get to that point, Mr.

17

we have a situation as to whether or not the reasoning that

18

was utilized in LaRue is the type of reasoning that would be

19

required, necessary, and essential in the event that a

20

distinction was going to be drawn between the live enter­

21

tainment and the nonlive entertainment.

22

quences, what is it that is trying to be avoided by drawing

23

that distinction?

24

All communities have a problem with traffic.

25

couldn't possibly generate the traffic of a supermarket.

Chief Justice,

What are the conse­

Is it going to be a question of traffic?

15

In fact we

That's why we have traffic rules, that's why we

1

2

have policemen, and we don't come along and ban all super­

3

markets because it creates a problem.

It's possible no matter1

4

where that there could be unruliness.

We don't ban every

5

type of activity where unruliness may follow.

6

that we form other means of curbing, the less restrictive

7

manner of achieving the purpose that's involved In the enact­

8

ment and the doctrine of any zoning ordinance.

What we do is

And this is implicit where there is a First Amend­

9
10

ment or a fundamental right, that these must be adhered to;

11

they must be within the contemplation of the community.

12

Here, through four courts, we have yet to hear any substan­

13

tial, compelling, or any other type of interest to be fur­

14

thered by the restriction on live entertainment.
And therefore I submit that time, place, and manner

15
16

has not been able to be brought into this matter because

17

there is no item that's recognized as being worthy, or the

18

object of regulation.

19

then we can't begin to talk about its regulation in time,

20

place, and manner.
QUESTION:

21

Unless we have live entertainment,

I gather, Mr. Levy, that what, the key

22

to Judge Deighan's opinion is that one sentence, is it, at

23

page 12a:

24

use in any establishment, regardless to whether there is a

25

relationship to nude entertainment."

"Live entertainment is simply not a permitted

16

This is the key to it,

1

isn't it?

2

MR. LEVY:

Yes, and what he did is, he --

3

QUESTION:

Just across the board barred any live

4
5

6
7

entertainment, clothed or unclothed.
MR. LEVY:

As a consequence of a zoning ordinance,

both of the judges did that.
QUESTION:

And I gather, at least we've had cases

8

that indicate that live entertainment often has communicative

9

aspects that are protected by the First Amendment. The

10
1 1

play "Hair" -- I've forgotten the name of the case -MR. LEVY:

They do.

What'it also means is that

12

across the board live entertainment is not deemed to be non­

13

protected under the First Amendment.

14

Salem Inn cases the fact that under certain circumstances it

15

may well be, but we haven't even been given the opportunity

16

of determining whether in our situation, are we entitled to

17

that protection?

18

that may thereafter take from us that protection?

19

been told across the board, from the very outset, no way;

20

you can't do it.

21

and it is given a presumption of validity; that's it.

We have in the Doran v.

And is there anything at all that we do
We have

Because we have the power to enact zoning

22

And throughout all of the documents submitted

23

throughout all o.f the courts including this one, we have

24

emphasized that this is not a First Amendment case; it's a

25

zoning case.

But I submit that it's a combination of the two.
17

1

It's a zoning case which does impinge upon First Amendment

2

freedoms and therefore the community now has the burden of

3

establishing the necessity for banning totally and would

equally have had the

sort of interest which it was attempting to further and --

would become necessary -QUESTION:

MR. LEVY:

motion pictures, which I thought it did, but you told us

15

there is in fact a motion picture theater on this street,

such an ordinance would be unconstitutional?

MR. LEVY:

QUESTION:

You have the right to do that as a de­

fense to a criminal prosecution?
MR. LEVY:

What I do is, I attempt to challenge

7

the validity of the statute in the criminal prosecution, and

8

therefore contain it within that.

9

QUESTION:

I have made my --

So then in a criminal trial the prose­

10

cutor has the burden of setting forth the factual justifica­

11

tion for the ordinance?

12

MR. LEVY:

He has that burden.

I challenge the

13

validity of the statute and I feel that, presumptively, the

14

moment that there is a challenge and that I can show the Court

15

that there is a First Amendment right involved, that it now

16

becomes the obligation on the burden of proof of the community

17

to justify that cutting back on what would be a presumptive,

18

protected right.

19

QUESTION:

The issue would be the same if it were a

20

motion picture theater or if it's a place where they have

21

live entertainment?

22

MR. LEVY:

I would say it's exactly the same wher­

23

ever there's a First Amendment issue involved.

24

must support and substantiate its cutting back, its restraint.

25

QUESTION:

The community

But didn't you agree that a community
19

1

could zone out entirely commercial uses and make it entirely

2

residential?
MR. LEVY:

3

I have said that, and if that were part

4

of the

unspoken part of Mr. Justice Stevens' question, then

5

I would have answered it the same way.

6

question to say that they were going to only rule out motion

7

picture theaters.

9

and I think it might meet all of the 0'Brien problems.

I understood his

I believe, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that a

I

10

think it has the right to make that sort of an enactment.

11

I think there's a purpose that would be served.

12

could set forth that that purpose would be furthered by the

13

fact that we eliminate all commerce.

14

who are delivering, we don't want any of those things, and

15

that it possibly is the most least restrictive method of

16

coping with that.

I think you

We don't want trucks

But the moment they open the door to discount stores

17
18

and gasoline stations -- by the way, if you look at this

19

ordinance, it's strange; it doesn't even allow gasoline

20

stations as a permitted use.

21

QUESTION:

How about newspapers?

22

MR. LEVY:

It's not listed here, unless it's an

23

accessory use to books or stationery, which are both allowed.

24

But then you'd have to make a quality judgment of accessory

25

use.

But I submit that if they wanted to eliminate all
20

1

commerce, that that would be then necessary that they elimi­

2

nate all commerce.

that purpose will be furthered by the total ban may well be

18

something that we have to think about in terms of that which

19

preceded the enactment and then further, whether or not there's an

20

other less restrictive manner in which that type of purpose

21

can be served.

could they prevent us from bringing in our form of commerce?

8
9

But once the

Now, there have been some other suggestions as to
what it is that we might be able to do here.

You have to

10

understand that at the time that we became aware of the in­

11

terpretation of this ordinance, it was as a consequence of

12

being served with criminal process, so we were already in

13

the courts.

14

I think would violate both Freedman and Blount.

15

just no way at all that we can get a speedy determination

16

and the burden of proof is not cast upon the community.

17

A suggestion that we go ahead and get a variance
There is

In a variance we take on all of the burdens of

18

showing that we will not in any way transgress what it is is

19

the purpose of the enactment of the zoning ordinance and that

20

we won't be violating health, welfare, morals, and the rest.

21

There is a further suggestion in the documents that have been

22

presented to you, that we have a right to go into chancery

23

and that we can get a restraining order.

24

is that that rule in chancery deals with civil cases and we

25

were already in a criminal case.
22

And what happens

1

or not courts will begin to in any way enjoin pending crimi­

sented with process, there was really nothing that we could

12

do except go along with the process, fight it in the criminal

13

court, raise all of the constitutional questions, and then

14

discover that the local court said, if it's nude dancing

15

-- not live entertainment, by the way -- if it's nude dancing,

16

it's not protected speech at all.

17

So that at the time that we were pre­

Then we get into the county court, which is an

18

appeal

19

that the court says, well, there are First Amendment guaran­

20

tees involved in dancing, but they don't apply in this case.

21

And why not?

22

at all.

23

basically for the opinion of the judge in the county court,

24

but without any elaboration or without any clarification.

25

The Supreme Court refuses our petition for certification,

but

issue of First Amendment.
QUESTION:

3

Let me go back to what you had said

4

before.

Do I understand you to say that the municipality

5

could not ban all filling stations?

6

MR. LEVY:

7

QUESTION: They could, couldn't they?

8

MR. LEVY:

I say it could.

9

QUESTION:

Then they could ban all grocery stores?

10

MR. LEVY:

It could, but again subject to challenge

11

12
13

No, I didn't say that at all.

I'm saying --

as to the basis upon which there is this -QUESTION:

Just because they don't want any filling

stations, they don't want any grocery stores.

14

MR. LEVY:

And if they --

15

QUESTION:

And they could ban all liquor establish-

16

ments, couldn't they?

17

MR. LEVY:

And if they did, sir --

18

QUESTION:

But you say they can't ban a theater?

19

MR. LEVY:

NO, what I've said is that --

20

QUESTION:

Of the kind you've got here?

21

MR. LEVY:

My answer with respect to the theater

22

was that if they, they cannot ban a theater if there are

23

other commercial uses without being subject to a challenge.

24

That could be a First Amendment challenge.

25

there can be an attempt to ban other commercial enterprise
24

I submit that

1

which is not protected by one of the first ten amendments.

2

But that again, that type of banning would be subject to some

3

form of review, and if there were an equivalent use in terms

4

of whatever it be, traffic, congregation of people, litter­

5

ing, whatever it is that may be their concern, if there is a

6

comparable use that is being allowed, then there would have

7

to be a question, either equal protection of the law, or

8

any other aspect that would then allow them to make that

9

distinction.

A ration would have to come from them as to

10

why there is that distinction, so that we don't have gasoline

1 1

stations, but that we could have coalyards, and that I could

12

go down and fill up my car with coal and take it home for my

13

stove.

14

And I think that in each instance there is power,

15

but that the power does not mean that there is then a neces­

16

sity for an abdication of objection on the part of those who

17

are affected by it.

18

And when we went into the question of a fundamental

19

right where there is First Amendment, the requirement on the

20

part of the state is not only brought to bear sooner but it's

21

a deeper problem that they have.

And I think the

aiding your argument?
MR. LEVY:

8

Well, in Belle Terre what we have is,

ordinance, or there

that there would be

that there could be a preventation of anyone who was not a

right the preservation of the family and in East Cleveland,

2

forth that that would violate the recognized fundamental

Of course, as my brother White earlier

said, what we have before us is the ordinance as construed

1 1

by the New Jersey courts.

12

MR. FISHMAN:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And the ordinance doesn't even seem to

14

allow moving picture theaters, but there is one in town,

15

we've been told.

16
17
18

MR. FISHMAN:

That moving picture theater, Your

Honor, would be a nonconforming use -QUESTION:

But in any event, we've been told that

19

whatever this ordinance may seem on its face to say, what it

20

does do is permit moving pictures and an adult bookstore but

21

not live entertainment.

22

MR. FISHMAN:

23

QUESTION:

Isn't that correct?
That's correct.

It is correct from --

And therefore that's the ordinance as it

comes to us, just as though it were written in so many words,

And what this is is a

It Is not -I didn't understand that to be the rea­

21

soning of Judge Deighan, which is the only full-dress opinion

22

we seem to have in this case.

23

MR. FISHMAN:

Judge Deighan's rationale as I under­

24

stand it is, he found that appellants' live entertainment

25

was First Amendment protected, but was nonetheless subject to
29

1

the reasonable exercise of the zoning power of the Borough

2

of Mount Ephraim.

3

we're dealing here with a, well, Mr. Abrams indicated that

perhaps there would be a community small enough and sleepy

enough -- I think I represent that community.

6

7

it has less than 2,000 homes.

It exists on the periphery of

not only in Camden County but in Philadelphia County and in

1 1

It's got three zones, or one or two, basically, distinction,

13

defined that commercial zone by listing those uses which we

14

permit.

15

to establish a retail sales zone, the ordinance provides retai 1

16

stores such as, but not limited to, and then it lists a lot

17

of things.
So there is no -- when you talk about, can you have

20

Of course.

And we have

And in case there be any doubt about our attempting

21

We have a true bedroom community here.

The answer is yes.

Can you have a gift shop?

Even if they're not in there.
QUESTION:

The answer is --

Well, flowers are- mentioned, as

was

brought to my attention.
MR.

FISHMAN:

The answer is clearly yes.

You can

have all of those things.
QUESTION: Then it says, all uses not expressly

30

1

permitted are prohibited.

2
3

MR. FISHMAN:

That's correct.

That's a separate

provision of the ordinance.

4

QUESTION:

It' your point, let me just be sure I

5

understand your point.

6

establishments, even if not expressly mentioned, would be

7

permitted because these retails that are listed are illustra­

8

tive of the total rather than -- ?

9

MR. FISHMAN:

Your point is that certain retail

Absolutely.

For example, there is

10

nothing in the ordinance which gives the appellant the right

1 1

specifically to sell films.

12

distinguish between selling records, selling books, selling

13

films.

14

we never moved against the sale of films, and we can't move,

15

in my opinion, at least, against the way in which those

16

films are sold.

17

Entertainment is afforded through --

18

But surely the Borough couldn't

This is a zone to sell things to the community.

So

But this is not an entertainment zone.

QUESTION:

I was under the impression that when a

19

customer viewed one of these films, he had to put a coin in

20

the viewing --

21

MR. FISHMAN:

22

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Well, that's a little different from the

23

record sales, or you're just doing it to see if you want to

24

buy it.

25

MR. FISHMAN:

I don't think the Borough could

prohibit the record shop from charging the customer a dime

2

or a quarter to listen to the record even if he was going to

buy it.

business.

I don't think that the Borough has a right to get

This matter arises in the context of a criminal

6
7

prosecution where the burden is clearly on the state beyond

8

a reasonable doubt, and we couldn't pick what we considered

9

to be close situations.
QUESTION:

10

But the peepshow is more a matter of

11

consumption than being on consignment or return in ten days

12

and you get your money back.
MR. FISHMAN:

13

I don't think any of that is involved.

14

What is involved is that if you view a film in a peepshow,

15

you can then come down and purchase that film.
QUESTION:

16
17
18

And once you -

You don't get to view it for nothing,

do you?
MR. FISHMAN:

No. You pay money for that viewing.

19

I don't see, however, where that makes any constitutional

20

significance at all.

21

about the appellants' argument, it seems as though everyone

22

is willing to concede that in a residential zone the outlaw­

23

ing or prohibition of any of the matters that

24

talking about now is permissible, and yet the appellant would

25

have you believe that commercial is an all-or-nothing

Additionally, what I fail to appreciate

32

we've been

proposition, and I don't really understand that argument.

2

Certainly, if some rational basis for distinguish­

3

ing between commercial uses can be found, then a classifica­

4

tion based upon this kind of commercial or that kind of

5

commercial has got to be as constitutionally sound as a

6

classification based upon residential -- .
QUESTION:

7

8

But, you do agree, or don't you, that

the ordinance bans all live entertainment?
MR. FISHMAN:

I agree that the ordinance prohibits

10

the utilization of land and structures in the commercial

11

zone --

QUESTION:

13

MR. FISHMAN:

14

And, of course, I take it that live en­

MR. FISHMAN:

QUESTION:

-- for any live entertainment,

Shakespeare --

That's correct.

So there is no live entertainment in the

Borough?
MR. FISHMAN:

20

That's incorrect.

21

a lot of examples have been raised as to whether or not you

can have Christmas carols at the office

QUESTION:

7

That's correct.

In the city?
That's correct.

And so it would ban a play, any kind of

a play, for example?
MR. FISHMAN:

It would ban a theater.

It would not

necessarily ban a play.

8

QUESTION:

Well, it would ban a commercial theater.

9

MR. FISHMAN:

10

QUESTION:

1 1

MR. FISHMAN:

12

QUESTION:

Correct.

Or a circus.
Correct.

And it would ban any kind of commercial

13

live entertainment, any kind of live entertainment for which

14

a fee is charged for profit, profit-making -- ?

15

MR. FISHMAN:

At the point that the structure or

16

land ceases to be an office or a home and becomes either a

17

theater or an opera house or a concert hall or a sports

18

arena or whatever, at that point it offends the zoning ordi­

19

nance because this ordinance is created as a retail sales

20

zone to satisfy the immediate needs --

21

QUESTION:

Now, what's your justification for saying

22

that the ordinance is valid even though it forbids any,

23

although it forbids among other things a commercial theater

24

with a live cast?

25

MR. FISHMAN:

You're asking for a compelling
34

1

state interest?

2

QUESTION:

3

your justification.

4

you have to show a compelling interest.

5

Yes.

What is your -- well, I'm asking

I don't know whether you concede that

MR. FISHMAN:

I didn't think I

do because I don't

6

really think this is a First Amendment case, but I'll be

7

privileged to respond to the question.

8

I think that a compelling state interest --

9

QUESTION:

Well, you would agree that live enter­

10

tainment in some forms, at least, is entitled to First

11

Amendment protection?

12

MR. FISHMAN:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. FISHMAN:

15

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

Like a theater?
Absolutely.

Would you also agree that the Borough of

16

Mount Ephraim is entitled to prohibit, say, a rock concert

17

that is apt to draw 50,000 people from Philadelphia and

18

Atlantic City because of the congestion problems involved,

19

even though it does involve live entertainment?

20

MR. FISHMAN:

Certainly; and has.

At least, and has

21

if they're going to utilize the land or structures of the

22

Borough of Mount Ephraim, it has.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

But without all of that crowd, could you

have live entertainment in the existing movie theater?
MR. FISHMAN:

I don't think you could -- no, you

1

cannot, Your Honor, you cannot.
QUESTION:

Would it not be?

I'm sorry, sir.
The high school play --

At the moment that the structure in

which it is being performed ceases to become a high school

9

and becomes something other than that.
QUESTION:

10

No, no, I asked about your existing

11

motion picture theater.

12

it would bar a play in the motion picture theater.

13

MR. FISHMAN:

QUESTION:

15

You answered my brother Marshall that

Yes, it does --

It would bar the high school putting on

its play in the -- ?

16

MR. FISHMAN:

17

QUESTION:

Perhaps not on a one-time basis, but -

Well, that is certainly not the way I

18

read, and I gather that's as my brother Stewart suggested

19

to you early, that's what we have to take as the reach of

20

this ordinance, what Judge Deighan -- is that the way you pro­

21

nounce it?

22

MR. FISHMAN:

23

QUESTION:

"Deegan."

The way, that sentence I read your col­

24

league earlier, that it does not grant any kind of live

25

entertainment.
36

QUESTION:

1

2

And what is your -- you were going to

suggest to me what the justification was for that.
MR. FISHMAN:

3

Well, I think there are several

4

justifications.

5

compelling state interest.

6

compatible uses into zones and the blending of compatible

7

zones into a comprehensive zoning ordinance is as has been

8

said by this Court the most essential function performed

9

by local government because it's in that way that the quality

10

One is that zoning in and of itself is a
I think that the combining of

of life in these communities can be preserved.
Officially, the devotion of the limited amount of

11

12

commercial space that a town like the Borough of Mount

13

Ephraim has to the satisfaction of immediate needs of the

14

residents of a borough is certainly a compelling state

15

interest.

16

omitted uses of live entertainment, like traffic, crowds,

17

parking, trash, demands for medical and police facilities,

18

the avoidance of these things for a Borough like Mount

19

Ephraim is a compelling state interest.

20

levels I think a compelling state interest has been shown.

21

The avoidance of those problems

Well, do you think that covers the situa­

22

tion. if the owner of the motion picture theater says, by the

23

way, I would -- three nights a week are going to be movies

24

and three nights a week are going to be plays?

25

MR. FISHMAN:

You have to appreciate, Your Honor,
37

1

that that movie

QUESTION:

That, you would say, movies are all

3

right and plays are not, or not?

4

MR. FISHMAN:

5

is

and I don't think that that movie would be a permissible

use were it to move into town today.

You have to appreciate that that movie

QUESTION:

use in our borough, Your Honor.

It

I suppose it also precedes the song,

"New York Throughway's Closed, Man."

11

MR. FISHMAN:

12

QUESTION:

I'm at a loss, Your Honor.

Well, what about -- does the ordinance

13

ban the showing in this store that we have here, this adult

14

bookstore, of movies?

15

MR. FISHMAN:

No, because that is -- at least,

16

it coufd be argued and it probably would be argued that that

17

is the method by which they choose to sell their movies.

18

In that way it would become an accessory use to their sale

19

of films, which is clearly permitted, even though not speci­

20

fically mentioned, under the phrase, "Retail stores such as

21

...but not limited to..."

22

QUESTION:

Additionally, --

Mr. Fishman, let me ask one other ques­

23

tion about the motion picture theater.

24

a nonconforming use, meaning that it was in existence before

25

You're saying this is

MR. FISHMAN:

QUESTION:

The motion picture theater.

MR. FISHMAN:

5

QUESTION:
the --

MR. FISHMAN:

8

QUESTION:

10

This motion picture, or a movie?

No, no, I'm talking about the theater,

7

9

Does that

mean that

4

6

Are we discussing the movie, sir?

Yes, sir.

Does that mean that if someone else

wanted to open a motion picture theater that would be pro­
hibited by the ordinance?

11

MR. FISHMAN:

12

QUESTION:

I believe so, sir.

So that in a way this is like, the

13

same case as if this is the second -- this is an application

14

to -- I mean, it's not application, but if it were, to be a

15

second place of entertainment within the area?
MR. FISHMAN:

16

Yes, it could be so viewed.

And

17

the first place, of course, didn't get there because we just

18

didn't close our eyes and permit it to come in in the face

19

of the ordinance, it got there before the ordinance, and our

20

ordinance has a saving nonconforming use provision across

21

the board.

22

QUESTION:

In other words, if they had had vaude­

23

ville in that motion picture theater before the ordinance was

24

passed, presumably they could continue to have it then?

25

That would be an exception to the live entertainment?
39

MR. FISHMAN:

1

2

I think so, although that's not pre­

sent at all.
QUESTION:

3

Well, we didn't even know about the

4

motion picture theater until you told us about it.

5

even in the record.
MR. FISHMAN:

it exists.

I understand this, Your Honor, but

I think Mr. Levy was questioned about that in

QUESTION:

Well, if a -- could there be a dinner

10

theater that didn't have a live play but which showed movies

1 1

in connection with their restaurant operation?

12

MR. FISHMAN:

No, sir.

No, sir.

A movie in a

13

dinner theater, I don't think would be an accessory use.

14

There are only three --

15

QUESTION:

You're really saying that since it's

16

not permitted there's no entertainment of any kind permitted

17

in the Borough commercially?

18

MR. FISHMAN:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. FISHMAN:

The land of the Borough

Whether it's live or not live?
That's correct.

The Borough of Mount

21

Ephraim has created a commercial zone to satisfy the immediate

22

needs of the residents.

23

come home at night and you forgot to buy your bread, your

24

milk, your gift --

25

QUESTION:

It's a bedroom community.

If you

Do you think that's the way your
40

1

New Jersey courts construed this ordinance as banning all

2

entertainment rather than just all live entertainment?
MR. FISHMAN:

3

I think so, sir.

We proceeded on the

4

theory of live entertainment in the municipal court because

5

we wanted as narrow an imposition as possible.
QUESTION:

6

But I know, Mr. Fishman, but don't we

7

have to -- the only opiion, as Justice Stewart reminded you

8

earlier, is the county court opinion, isn't it?

9

MR. FISHMAN:

10
1 1

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And that's all we know about what the

meaning of this ordinance that has been --

12

MR. FISHMAN:

13

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

14

That is correct.

You have some remaining time.

15

MR. FISHMAN:

Thank you.

16

(Recess)

17

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

18

21

Mr. Fishman, you may

continue.

19

20

We'll resume at 1 o'clock.

MR. FISHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
It is submitted by the Borough of Mount Ephraim

22

that this ordinance passes every constitutional test developec

23

under the First Amendment.

24

that clearly the ordinance is within the power of government

25

and clearly is unrelated to the suppression of expression.

We passed the O'Brien test, in

41

1

These points are actually conceded by the appellant.

The

2

appellant, however, denies that we advance a significant

3

governmental interest or that the ordinance is sufficiently

4

narrow so as to not impinge upon the First Amendment any more

5

than is necessary.

6

cant governmental interest, as I've said before, because

7

zoning in and of itself is not just a significant governmental

8

interest but perhaps the most essential governmental interest

9

served by any local community.

We submit that we do advance a signifi­

10

In addition, what we have really striven to do in

11

this matter is devote the limited amount of commercial land

12

which fronts on this main highway through the Borough of

13

Mount Ephraim to satisfy the immediate needs of the residents

14

of the Borough of Mount Ephraim, and in so doing we contend

15

that we advance a significant governmental interest.

16

QUESTION:

Mr.

Fishman, how many prosecutions under

17

this ordinance have there been?

18

MR. FISHMAN:

19

all I would know of, Your Honor.

That I' ve handled, only one, and that's
%

20

QUESTION:

21

MR.

This is the only one?

FISHMAN:

This is the only attempt at entertain­

22

ment that has ever come into the town of Mount Ephraim that

23

I am aware of, and I've been its prosecutor for a number of

24

years, sir.

25

QUESTION:

There have never any other noncon-

forming uses?
42

1

MR. FISHMAN:

There are three restaurants in the

2

town that offer music with the meal.

3

found that that music with a meal is an accessory use and

4

in addition to that a hearing was held on the issue of selec­

5

tive enforcement, which was the only testimony ever taken

6

in this matter, and at that hearing everyone testified that

7

those uses predated any ordinance that anyone could remember.

8

So that they would be the only live entertainment in the

9

town, and they would be there by virtue of the nonconforming

10

use, and also --

tainment; that is correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Or any entertainment, conforming or

nonconforming.
MR. FISHMAN:

Well, we don't ban entertainment.

17

What we do is we regulate the use of buildings and structures

18

within the town.

If someone wanted, for example --

QUESTION:

That is absolutely

This zone has been created in order to

You can't sell entertainment under the

zoning ordinance?
43

MR. FISHMAN:

1

That's correct.

Entertainment is

2

accommodated throughout the County of Camden; specifically,

3

live nude entertainment is accommodated throughout the

4

county of Camden, and it has to be remembered that the tradi­

5

tional concepts of zoning -- one of the cases cited in my

6

brief is Village of Valley View v. Proffett.

7

case the court said that traditional concepts of zoning

8

envision a community as a self-contained unit containing

9

its own -- or, a municipality as a self-contained unit, and

And in that

10

containing its own residential, commercial, and industrial

11

areas.

12

Mount Ephraim, like Valley View, is on the peri­

13

phery of a huge metropolitan center and it is not a self-

14

contained unit, it is, as they said in that case, merely an

15

adventitious fragment of the social and economic whole,

16

and as such what is really at issue here is whether the

17

Borough of Mount Ephraim or any such small residential commu­

18

nity has the right and the power to determine its character,

19

what it's going to look like in the future.

20

We have a town in Mount Ephraim called Tavestock.

According to the 1980 census figures, Tavestock has four homes

45

1

I maintained initially that this really -- I sub­

2

mit that there are really no constitutional issues presented

3

in this matter.

4

I say that because it would seem to me of neces­

5

sity that before a content-neutral zoning ordinance, clearly

6

valid on its face, can be held to implicate First Amendment

7

principles, there must of necessity be some type of a con­

8

stitutional showing that the use is not accommodated else­

9

where in the community at large, and there should also be

10

some obligation to establish that the proposed site of this

11

use is at least reasonably suitable to accommodate the use.

12

There's been no showing; the record is barren with

respect to that.

constitutionally permissible uses.

And in so doing you are

If there is anything that does not lend itself to

homogenization at the national level, it's zoning.

have decisions like, let's not put the drainage ditch here

Court should not interfere with.

MR. FISHMAN:

I think that's probably accurate.

What we're trying to achieve here is to create a.commercial zon o

to satisfy the immediate needs of the residents of the Borough of

6

Mount.Ephraim and that's what we've done, or that's what we've

striven to do, and to engraft upon that definition all

8

constitutionally protected uses would bring about bizarre

results.

illustration that Justice Marshall just gave.

1 1

Certainly newspapers are constitutionally protected, but

12

that doesn't mean that you can put up the large newspaper

factories that are necessary to create, the printing presses

14

that are necessary to create a newspaper in any place.

are some places where that use is inappropriate.

22

throughout Burlington County and Camden County as well.
