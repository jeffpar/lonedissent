ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. NELSON, ESQ.,

5

8

We'll hear- arguments next

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The petitioner is a Vermont convict who is in prison,
not in Vermont, but in the United States Penitentiary in Terre
Haute, Indiana.

He challenges his incarceration by the United

States and asks his return to the custody of Vermont.
The case involves two statutes, two federal statutes,
and turns on the construction of one of them.

Section 4001(a)

of Title 18 guarantees that no citizen shall be imprisoned by
15

the United States except pursuant to an act of Congress.
16

Section 5003(a) of the same title authorizes the Attorney Gen­
17

eral to accept custody of state prisoners when the Director of
18

the Bureau of Prisons certifies that proper and adequate treat­
19

ment facilities and personnel are available.

The question is

20
the construction of that section.
21

QUESTION:

What was Mr. Howe convicted of?

22

MR. NELSON:

He was convicted of first degree murder.

23

QUESTION:

And do you have any answer of your own as

24

to what would be the proper and suitable correctional treatment
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

3

1

for him?
MR. NELSON:

2

Well, I think that the 2nd Circuit's view

3

is reasonable, that his incarceration is not for treatment at

4

all but simply for deterrence.
QUESTION:

5
6

think that it must be treatment of some sort?
MR. NELSON:

7
8

9
10

11

Well, do you think -- in other words, you

Yes.

We feel that the statute permits

inmates to come into the federal system for purposes of treat­
ment .
QUESTION:

What if the Vermont penal authorities de­

cide that no amount of treatment can ever rehabilitate this
person, that

he's simply got to be locked up for a good long

12

time in order to keep him from doing it again.
13
MR. NELSON:

Well, they are certainly entitled to

14
that and then Mr. Howe is their problem.

Then Mr. Howe must be

15
dealt with as many difficult correctional problems must be
16
dealt with by the state.

There are options other than sending

17
him to the federal system.
18
QUESTION:

But you say the federal system has no right

19
to receive him under these circumstances.
20

MR. NELSON:

That's right.

Except for treatment needs

21

QUESTION:

Did I hear you correctly to either say or

22
imply that there is some legal obligation to treat him?
23
MR. NELSON:

I think there is an obligation to treat

24
him so long as he is in the federal system.

1

QUESTION:

Why do you make it any different when it's

2

in federal custody as a surrogate for the state, than when he is

3

in the state custody with the state doing it on its own behalf?
MR. NELSON:

4

Well, a prisoner committed to state custo

5

dy is simply committed to the Commissioner of Corrections or to

6

the prison system for whatever purpose imprisonment may serve.

7

The same is true of a prisoner' committed' to federal prison.

8

is simply committed to a penal or correctional institution.
QUESTION:

9

11

That is, after a federal criminal trial.

MR. NELSON:

10

'.He

After a federal criminal trial; precisely.

A state prisoner in federal prison is there under a narrower
statute, the statute at issue here, one which permits incarcera­

12
13

tion when there are adequate and proper treatment facilities
available.

14

QUESTION:

Would it be your submission that absent

15

this statute there would be no authority to receive a state pri­
16
soner at all?
17

MR. NELSON:

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

Why would that be?

19

MR. NELSON:

That would be because of Section 4001 of

20

Title 18, which prohibits imprisonment except pursuant to an
21
act of Congress.

That would prohibit imprisonment by executive

22

order or by executive arrangement, such as the contract which
23

was made in this case.
24

QUESTION:

But 5003 isn't limited to treatment.

25
North American Reporting

It says, "Custody, care, subsistence, education, treatment,

and training," doesn't it?

QUESTION:

That's correct.
It doesn't, it isn't limited to'treatment?
No, it's not.
Well, I was waiting for you to say it.
Pardon?
I was waiting for you to say it.

You kept

just using the one word, "treatment."
MR. NELSON:

Well, let's look at the face of 5003.

It's at page 2 of our brief.

Subsection (a) contains two

clauses; grammatically, it's an independent clause. The indepen­
12

dent clause, as Your Honor points out, permits the Attorney
13

General to contract with appropriate officials of a state for
14

the custody, care, subsistence, education, treatment, and
15

training of inmates.

That's just about everything, the full

16

range of penological purposes, as one circuit- court has put it.
17

That's one thing that that section does.

The other

18

thing it does is it limits that power to cases where the Direc­
19

tor of the Bureau of Prisons certifies that adequate and proper
20

treatment facilities and personnel are available.
21

QUESTION:

Was that done in this case?

22

MR. NELSON:

No, it wasn't.

There was a certification

23

that facilities were available at federal prisons.

We think

24

there's a difference between dead space in a prison -25

QUESTION:

Well, couldn't that be facilities for

MR. NELSON:

Well, that's not the Government's posi­

tion and it's not the state's position, and --

QUESTION:

6

MR. NELSON:

Answer my question; it's my question.
I don't think that the Bureau --no, I

7

don't think it could be construed as that.

8

intend it as a certification, specifically, treatment facilia

9

ties; simply, facilities generally.

10

11

QUESTION:

The Bureau did not

Looking at the same subsection (a) that

you've just been reading from, the Attorney General may,
"is hereby authorized to contract with the proper officials of
a state or a territory for the custody" of a person "when the
Director shall certify that proper and adequate treatment facil­
ities and personnel are available."
Now, if you contract for the custody of a person, it

16

doesn't take a whole lot in the way of trained personnel other
17

than guards, does it?
18

MR. NELSON:

Justice Rehnquist, we agree that this

19

statute is talking about transfers of inmates to federal pri­
20

sons, and clearly custody is involved.

The question is, when

21

may those transfers occur?

Must they be, may they be at any

22

time for any purpose, or for no purpose at all, as in an intra­
23

state transfer situation?

That's the respondent's view.

Our

24

view is that it can occur only in cases of treatment needs where
25

there are treatment facilities available in the federal prison

system.

this statute by the House committee which passed it.

4

that the section was limited to inmates with treatment needs.

In the Senate the same view was expressed, although perhaps not

quite so clearly.

11

It said

Senator McCarran,. asked What'.the bill would

to federal prison in certain circumstances in a limited category
of cases.

Neither of those sources indicates that this statute

gave the Attorney General a blank check to accept any state
inmates for any purpose.
QUESTION:

12
13

Our view is supported by the construction placed on

The language of Subsection (a) does outline

the purposes for which the Attorney General may receive them
and it's custody, care, subsistence, education, treatment, and

14

training.
15

MR. NELSON:

That's correct.

If I invite someone to

16

dinner, I am undertaking to give him a table to eat it on, a
17

chair to sit on, a light to eat it by.
18

QUESTION:

Not necessarily.

Suppose it's a brunch

19

out in the back yard?
20
QUESTION:

How about a luau?

QUESTION:

Why do you say there is such a rigidity in

21
22

it?
23

MR. NELSON:

Well, I guess I should take that back.

24

I would undertake to provide

the incidentals.

Well, what if you invite him for custody?

3

MR. NELSON:

4

Inmates here are not invited for custody.

That's -- they're invited for treatment.
QUESTION:

5

Well, but the reading of the statute, it

seems to me, it's particularly phrased in the -- with the "and" as

7

it is, would include custody as a separate facet.
MR. NELSON:

10
11

You're really sitting on that first certi­

fication?
MR. NELSON:

12
13

All these are incidentals, necessary

We think that's crucial.

We think that's

crucial.
QUESTION:

And we don't have to get beyond that?

14

MR. NELSON:

Well, the only way the statute could work

15

is if it had something like the broad custody, care, subsist­
16

ence, education clause in it, otherwise the Federal Government
17

would only be in charge of the treatment aspects and everything
18

else would be up in the air.

There would be no authorization

19

for general custody.
20

May I refer the Court to another, to two sections of
21

the Youth Corrections Act, Sections 512 and 513 of the YCA.
22

This statute, incidentally, is right next door to the Youth
23

Corrections Act.

The Youth Corrections Act permits placements

24

of youth offenders in treatment facilities; precisely the same

language used in 5003(a) is used in Section 512 of the Youth

Corrections Act.

in part, after 512 of the Youth Corrections Act.

It's clear that 5003(a) was modeled after 512,

QUESTION:

4

Mr. Nelson, it's entirely a different ques­

5

tion.

6

don't raise any challenge, do you, to the power of the Vermont

7

authorities to enter into contracts for the placement of people

8

in their custody elsewhere?

9

10
11

I just want to get something straight in my mind.

MR. NELSON:

You

No, this case solely concerns the power

of the Federal Government to accept custody.
QUESTION:

So, if there's any -- you're suggesting,

though, is if Vermont had entered into a contract, say, with
12
13

New Hampshire, for New Hampshire to take over while they re­
modeled their prisons or something like that, that your client

14

could attack the New Hampshire authority to accept the prisoners ?
15

MR. NELSON:

No, no, we're not claiming that.

16

QUESTION:

Well, how do you get standing to attack the

17

Attorney General's authority to spend federal funds in housing
18

your client?
19

MR. NELSON:

We assert a right not to be incarcerated

20
by the United States Government.
21

QUESTION:

Well, but isn't it arguable, at least,

22

that you're really being incarcerated by the State of Vermont
23

and they in effect have entered into a contract to have the
24

Federal Government perform that state function

for them during

a temporary period?

HR. NELSON:

No, I don't think that’s arguable.

It

may be arguable that --

4

QUESTION:

But in the first question about Vermont

5

and New Hampshire, it seems to me you're suggesting you could

6

not challenge New Hampshire's custody.
QUESTION:

don't you?
MR. NELSON:

QUESTION:

10

MR. NELSON:

11

QUESTION:

12
13
14

You assert a right under 18 U.S.C. 4001(a),

That’s correct.
Because of that statute.
That statute.
The question is whether you're being de­

tained by the United States, within the meaning of that statute,
or whether he was still being detained by Vermont.

Because I

suppose Vermont could any time it wanted to say to the United
15

States, we've decided to let this man go free.
16

MR. NELSON:

Even by -- by contract they could; yes.

17

QUESTION:

So that who is the detaining authority?

18

Is it the state or the Federal Government?
19

MR. NELSON:

The detaining authority is the Federal

20

Government.

He is clearly under federal detention.

There may

21

be a question of whether he is in custody in a legal sense of
22

the state or of the Federal Government, but I don't think that
23

there's

a

serious

question that he is, in a real sense in

24

federal detention, that he is imprisoned or detained by the

is he in?
MR. NELSON

In a legal sense, perhaps, he's in

Vermont's custody.
QUESTION:

Well, are we interested in any sense other

than a legal sense?
MR. NELSON

Yes, I think in the sense intended, in a

real sense, in a sense intended by 4001, he is imprisoned by
15

the United States.

The question is whether that imprisonment

16

is authorized by an act of Congress.
17

QUESTION:

Is it legal?

18

MR. NELSON

We say it's not.

19

QUESTION:

So he's not in the legal custody of anybody

20
That's a lovely position.

I know a lot of prisoners would love

21

that position.
22

MR. NELSON:

He's not demanding freedom, Your Honor.

23

He's asking his return to Vermont custody.

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that almost a case of damnum

Why is your client going to be better off

being imprisoned in the state penitentiary in New Hampshire
than he is in the federal penitentiary at Terre Haute?

15

MR. NELSON:

For one thing, he'd be closer to home.

16

For another thing, I don't think that the question really is
17

whether the inmate is better off.

He's asking, I'm advocating

18

his desire to be returned to Vermont and the question is whether
19

he has a legal right to that relief.
20

QUESTION:

Well, he wouldn't' be seeing" much of

21

Vermont, would he?
22

QUESTION:

Does the record show whether he has rela­

23

tives in Vermont?

9

He is parolable, technically, right now.

10

11

Another consideration, of course, is
Mr. Howe is sentenced to life impri­

Life imprisonment in Vermont is actually zero to life.
It's difficult if not

impossible to work out any kind of even beginnings of a parole
plan from Terre Haute.
QUESTION:

How can --

Are not the records at the federal prison

12
13

maintained on the conduct and behavior of the prisoner and all
of the factors that go into whether a prisoner is going to be

14

eligible for parole?
15

MR. NELSON:

Certainly.

And that would be available

16

to the Vermont Parole Board.
17

QUESTION:

Is there anything in the Vermont Constitu­

18

tion or statutes that requires, that Vermont prisoners convicted
19

in Vermont courts be kept in custody within the boundaries of
20
the state?
21

MR. NELSON:

No.

22

QUESTION:

Then,

they,

theoretically, they could

23

send them to Devil's Island if they wanted to, couldn't they,

if there were such a place now?

1

MR. NELSON:

2

QUESTION:

Under constitutional restraints, yes.
That's why you focus on the power of the

3

Federal Government to receive rather than the power of the Ver­

4

mont court to transfer?
MR. NELSON:

5

That's correct.

We see a clear right in

6

federal law against federal imprisonment which is not authorized

by statute.
QUESTION:

10
11

What can 5003 mean if it doen't mean that

the federal system will help absorb -- say -- prisoners on re­
quest and use its unused capacity?

What else was that statute

passed for?
MR. NELSON:

Well, I think the legislative history

12

shows that it was passed for inmates with specialized needs,
13

treatment needs.

That it was limited to cases of inmates in

14

need of treatment.

The legislative history defines --

15

QUESTION:

What does the language of the statute tell

16

us?

If the language is clear, we don't need to worry about the

17

legislative history, do we?
18

MR. NELSON:

That's true, that's true.

And we think

19

that the language of of the statute is pretty clear.

Let's

20
play dumb for a minute, read "treatment facilities and person­
21

nel."

What does that mean?

The core meaning of that phrase is

22

I think, hospitals or

mental institutions of some sort.

23

I think that's -24

QUESTION:

Well, but the core of this statute, if you

25
North American Reportinq

want to talk about the core of it, is that the Federal Govern­

mean, was that a euphemism for "prison"?

Did it

The only way that this

statute can be construed as a general blanket authorization to
take state inmates to help the states out with their prison

15

problems, for whatever reason, is to read treatment facilities
16

and personnel as a euphemism for federal prison.

I think there

17

are compelling reasons not to read it that way.

I think -- as

18

I said, I think it has a core meaning of mental hospitals,

physical hospitals.

It means something broader than --

What don't they -- I mean, I don't think that

treatment facilities and personnel can mean prison industries

12

Treatment appears twice in this statute, first in the phrase
"treatment facilities" and second in the list of items con­
tracted for.

If it means custody, essentially, in its appear­

thing very different in the second appearance in the statute.
In the second appearance it's different from custody,

So the reading of

the statute that the respondents propose requires that treatment
15

be given two radically different meanings within one sentence.
16

And it requires also that we presume Congress was using a jar­
17

gon or technical usage when there is no indication that it was.
18

In fact, the Court, if it is of a mind to, can read Title 18 of
19

the Code from cover to cover and not find a single instance
20

where "treatment facilities" is used as a euphemism for prison,

to mean that this institution does not have a medical unit, for

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. BARBARA E. ETKIND, ESQ.,
19

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENTS
20
MS. ETKIND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

21

Court:
22

The primary issue presented by this case is whether
23

a state prisoner is ineligible for transfer to federal custody
24

under 18 U.S.C.

5003 unless

he

has a need for specialized

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

22

1

treatment that is available in the federal prison system.

2

is

3

that Section 5003 is not so limited.

4

statutory requirements are met and any state prisoner regardless

5

of treatment needs may be transferred from state to federal

6

custody once a contract has been entered into between the state

7

and federal governments, and once the Director of the Federal

Bureau of Prisons has certified that facilities in federal

Rather', in our view, the

On behalf of the United States I

shall explain how.'the "language of the statute, its legislative
history, and its consistent administrative application require
that construction.

The Attorney General of the State of

12

Vermont will discuss the state's vital interest in having this
13

statute construed in the manner we urge.
14

Preliminarily, in response to Justice Marshall's ques­
15

tion, we would

say

that our certification saying that

16

facilities in federal institutions are available would imply
17

that treatment facilities are also available, because what we
18

have in the federal system are in fact treatment facilities;
19

they are available.
20

Also, with respect to

the

question regarding trans­

21

fer under the Interstate Correctional Compact, not only could
22

he be transferred to New Hampshire, in which case he could be
23

visited more easily, he could also be transferred presumably to
24

Colorado, in which case it would be even more difficult for his

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

23

1

family to visit him, yet he would assert no challenge to that

2

type of transfer.

3

There is no suggestion in the statutory language that

4

the federal prison system's authority to assume custody of a

5

state prisoner is conditioned on the prisoner's need for spe­

6

cialized treatment available in the federal system.

of treatment but equally for the purposes of custody, care,

subsistence, education, and training of state prisoners.
QUESTION:

11
12

The plain

But why then does the statute require that

the Director shall certify that proper and adequate treatment
facilities and personnel be available?
MS. ETKIND:

14

that.

Well, there are a couple of answers to

One is that the description of treatment facilities is

15

merely, the use of "treatment facilities" is merely a correct
16

description of the federal facilities, the federal prisons,
17

because what we have are treatment facilities.
18

To be sure, other federal statutes refer to prisons as
19

penal and correctional, institutions, but: those provisions were
20

passed, not only were passed by Congresses other than that
21

which passed 5003, but they concern the operation and manage­
22

ment of federal prisons as institutional entities rather than th=
23

slots within them that may be available for the housing of
24

state prisoners.

And finally, even if the phrase, "treatment

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

24

1

facilities" were intended to refer to something narrower than

2

the typical facilities that we provide for all federal prison­

3

ers, Section 5003 still requires no more than a certification

4

that facilities are available, presumably in the case that the

5

prisoner would need them.

6

suggests that the Director must make an individualized determi^-

7

nation in the case of each potential state transferee that he

needs specialized treatment

MS. ETKIND:

Well, that's the argument on the merits,

but there's a threshold question about whether or not there is

a right of action to bring the lawsuit such as the one that

was brought here, which was not habeas corpus.
25
North American Reporting

25

1

MS. ETKIND:

Right.

And while we would assert that

2

there is no private right of action, we have not pressed that

3

because most of these cases have come up under habeas and

there certainly would be a right if the petitioner is right in

the way he construes the statute, then there would be a remedy

in habeas.

Habeas has been used in cases in

which -QUESTION:

But the normal remedy of habeas corpus,

12

the normal request, is for release.
13

MS. ETKIND:

The normal request is for release, but it

14

has been employed in cases in which the prisoner is complaining
15

that he's in the wrong place.
16

QUESTION:

That he's detained illegally?

17

MS. ETKIND:

Yes.

In the wrong place.

He should be

18

somewhere else.

And in fact, in the 7th Circuit, where we have

19

lost this issue, the remedy is that the court orders that the
20
prisoner will be returned to the state’s.authority and if not
21

the writ will issue and he will be released.
22

QUESTION:

It would seem to me that 4001(a), the

23

purpose of that section must have been to give a citizen who
24

is detained by the United States not pursuant to an act of
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

26

1

Congress a remedy.

2

What else would

MS. ETKIND:

4001(a) do?

Well, the legislative history of 4001(a)

3

is very specific.

4

the repeal of the emergency, the Internal Security Act, a

5

provision that allowed citizens to be rounded up and detained

6

if there was just probable cause to believe that they were,

7

engaged in some sort of illegal activity without conviction.

8

And the legislative history makes quite clear that 4001 was

9

enacted in order to provide that citizens would not have to be

10

afraid of that.
QUESTION:

11
12
13
14

That statute was passed in connection with

Well, in other words, what you're saying is

that a citizen who is detained by the United States not pursuant
to an act of Congress ought to have a remedy in court to get
out?
MS. ETKIND:

That's what petitioner is saying.

15

QUESTION:

What?

16

MS. ETKIND:

That's what the petitioner --

17

QUESTION:

Well, that's what you're telling me too.

18

Because you're saying these people were detained under this
19

internal security legislation and this was to change that and
20

give them a remedy for. it.
21

MS. ETKIND:

Well, but when we look to see whether a

22

private right of action is available we look at more than the
23

language of the statute itself.
24

QUESTION:

No, but the first thing we look air, what group

25
North American Reporting

27

1

does it confer a benefit on?

2

sons?

3

persons who are imprisoned except pursuant to an act of Congress

4

imprisoned by the United States without any act of Congress au­

5

thorizing it.

And there sure is a special class defined in 4001(a),

MS. ETKIND: Except that the legislative'history makes clepr

11

Is there a special class of per­

that the persons for whomithey were concerned and to'whom they wanted
to -give a right of action were those that were being detained'without
/

conviction only upon a probable cause of engaging in some sort of illegal
activity.

We’ve addressed that in our brief, I believe it’s

page 25, Note 13.
Section 5003 does not provide, as petitioner would

12

have it, that no state prisoner may be transferred to the
13

federal prison

system unless the Director certifies that he

14

is in need of specialized treatment available in the federal
15

system.

Rather, the only condition imposed under Section

16

5003(a)'s broad authority to contract, apart from the reimburseme|nt
17

requirement, is that the Director have certified that proper
18

and adequate treatment facilities and personnel are available.
19

That certification nowhere requires that an individualized
20
determination of treatment need and available federal resources
21

be made with respect to each potential state transferee.
22

QUESTION:

Let’s assume that a state, a given state,

23

not Vermont, had a provision in its criminal statutes governing
24

its institutions, that any prisoners on coming in would be
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

28

examined and classified, and if they were found to have particu­

2

lar problems, for example, alcoholism and emotional disorders,

then the statute would provide in that state, shall receive

treatment for such condition.

someone that treatment was available?

that situation, they would not be complying with th’e state

statute.

In other words, absent

Now, could that prisoner be

in that case there might be an expectation created by state law.
QUESTION:

11

MS. ETKIND:

12

QUESTION:

13

Well, the Congress in passing 5003 -Did not use that.
I would think must be assumed to have taken

into account that perhaps some states do require some kind of
14

treatment.

And, of course, it's well known that all the federal

15

prisons do provide some forms of treatment.

Would you think

16

that might have been in the contemplation of Congress in
17

drafting that?
18

MS. ETKIND:

No, no, I don't think so.

To go to the

19

legislative history, what Congress's basic underlying motive,
20

intent, was, was to match the needs of the states with the
21

surpluses of the Federal Government, whatever they might be at
22

that time.

The requests that the Bureau of Prisons had

been

23

getting was for space in the federal system for juveniles and
24

for drug addicts, and we had that space available and so we
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

29

1

determined to make that available.

2

intent of Congress was not to limit it in that way, it was just

3

to make what we had available to the states.

But in a gross sense the

Although we view the statutory language as unambiguous

4
5

resort to the legislative history demonstrates, as I said, that

6

the intent was to match the states' needs with federal surpluses

7

The petitioner’s construction would frustrate that intent by

8

preventing the Federal Government, even when it has the neces­

9

sary surpluses, from meeting the urgent needs of the state cor­

10

11

...

rectional system.

,

t

The Bureau's construction of Section 5003

has permitted it to accept custody of nearly 172 New Mexico
prisoners who were displaced by the massive disruption in that

12

state's penitentiary on February 2 and 3, 1980.

Similarly,

13

pursuant to its broad construction of. Section 5003 , the Bureau
14

assumed custody of 111 Idaho state prisoners after riots occur­
15

red in that state's maximum security facility on July 23, 1980.
16

And more recently, the United States District Court for the
17

District of Maryland ordered the Maryland prison system to
18

transfer 100 of its inmates to the federal system in order to
19

partially relieve the state system's overcrowding problem.
20
None of those emergency relocations would be possible
21

under petitioner's cramped construction of the statute, nor
22

would the federal system be authorized to afford protective
23

custody to a state prisoner who was in danger from his fellow
24

state inmates or to accept custody of any state prisoner
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

30

1

regardless of how much he could benefit from or indeed desires

2

certain aspects of federal incarceration, unless such a prisoner

3

was otherwise in need of specialized treatment available in the

4

federal system.

5

As the court below put it, adopting petitioner's view

6

of the statute would mean that a wholly incorrigible prisoner

7

or on the other hand a fully rehabilitated prisoner incarcerated

8

not for treatment but solely for purposes of deterrence could.not

9

be transferred from state to federal custody solely to take

10

advantage of training and educational opportunities available

11

only at federal facilities.

12
13
14
15

QUESTION:

But, of course, you would agree, would

you not, that prior to 1952, when this statute was passed, that
was the situation?

There was no statutory authorization to

help the states out in these situations.
MS. ETKIND:

Well, I'm not sure that at that time

16

the Executive Branch could have entered into those contracts with
17

the states because 4001 was not passed until 1971, so I don't
18

think there would have been anything to stop the Federal
19

Government from doing it.
20

QUESTION:

Do you think that the Executive Department

21

would have the power to do it if it weren't for 4001?
22

MS. ETKIND:

Yes, I believe so.

I don't think it

23

needs 5003 except for 4001.

other way to solve these emergency problems, because I assume

11

there were problems from time to time where state facilities

14
15

got into trouble.

Presumably they contracted with other states,

I suppose.
MS. ETKIND:

That may have been, but I also think that

the overcrowding problems that the states have been having have
been escalating; I don't know at what stage they were --

16

QUESTION:

Well, there's nothing in the legislative

17

history of this statute that suggests it was enacted to handle
18

the overcrowding problem, is there?
19

MS. ETKIND:

No, there isn't specifically, but as I

20

mentioned before, I think the gist of it is that if the Federal
21

Government has a surplus and a state has a need, then those
22

should be matched.

Certainly, the Congress --

Contemporaneously with the enactment of

this statute.
MS. ETKIND:

times.

13

I think it

As of mid-December, 1980, the entire federal system

was slightly short of its rated physical capacity.

And to the

extent that such surplus federal facilities can be used to alle­
viate the state's problems, be they lack of maximum security
facilities, lack of treatment programs, or overcrowding in
general, we submit that the purposes of 18 U.S.C.

5003 would

14

be furthered.

And this shows that from the enactment of Section

15

5003 to the present, the Bureau of Prisons consistently has
16

maintained the view that we urge here, that there are no limi­
17

tations on the purposes for which state prisoners may be trans­
18

ferred to the federal system, that simple custody is a suffi­
19

cient reason.

Indeed, in its first annual report after the

20
passage of Section 5003 in 1952, the Bureau suggested as exam­
21

ples of situations in which the transfer provision might be em­
22

ployed, those in which "a state may wish to transfer a vicious,
23

intractable offender who cannot be handled readily in its own

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. EASTON, JR., ESQ.,
15

ON BEHALF OF THE STATE RESPONDENT
16

MR. EASTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

17

please the Court:
18

I think above all else this case is not merely a case
19

of statutory construction but it involves the ability of
20
Vermont and similar states to provide a dignified and humane
21

approach to dealing with those who run afoul of the law.
22

Maybe stated differently, the question is, may Vermont continue
23

to operate a community-based correction system where offenders,
24

more than 95 percent of those housed in Vermont, where they
25

have the right to be integrated back into the community.

2

must we return to the conditions that existed in 1974, when we

3

decided to close down the maximum security prison, when we were

4

spending a full 25 percent of our resources on two percent of

5

those incarcerated?

6

QUESTION:

Or

I think that's really the issue.
Mr. Easton, I take it nobody disputes the

statement in the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the 2nd
Circuit that Vermont, as contemplated in the agreement in 1975,
closed its only maximum security prison?
MR. EASTON:

10

QUESTION:

11

That's not in dispute, Justice Rehnquist.
You do have agreements with other states,

don't you?
12

MR. EASTON:

That is correct.

We are participants

13

in not only the New England compact but also the national
14

compact.

We have made agreements with the New England states

15

and most of the other states in the country.
16

QUESTION:

Which would allow Vermont to carry on its

17

present regimes -18

MR. EASTON:

That is true.

19

QUESTION:

Even though the federal prison system were

20

not available to you.
21

MR. EASTON:

One of the considerations, though,

22
Justice Stewart, is that just looking at the other New England
23

states, most of those states, they themselves have the same
24

problems that Vermont has, overcrowding, lack of humane

25

But New Hampshire, for example, I think,

MR. EASTON:

That it does, and we have a compact with

them.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn't that extend also to some of

8

your educational facilities?

Doesn't Vermont have an agreement

9

with Maine that Vermont law students can go to Maine, the

10

University of Maine Law School, whereas University of Maine

n

residents can go to the University of Vermont Medical School?

12

13
14

MR. EASTON:

Certainly it exists in veterinary school

and, I believe, medical school.

I'm not sure if it exists in

law schools too.
QUESTION:

Vermont has its own law school now.

15
MR. EASTON:

It does.

16
QUESTION:

But it's not state-sponsored.

17
MR. EASTON:

That's correct.

It's a private institu­

18
tion. I. guess the thrust of my argument is that the Federal' Bureau
19
of Prisons, which has been described as, in fact, I think, in
20

one of the Lono opinions as one of the best penal systems in
21

the world, that having that available to us for the five percent
22

of those prisoners who need the facilities enables us to have a
23
community-based correction system to care for the remaining
24
95 percent of those who can be integrated back into our

We're talking, in a state like Vermont, of a very

I suppose the legal question is, say we

agree with you, that it’d be a very good idea for the Federal
Government to take over a large portion of these state respon­
sibilities, but the question is whether Congress has authorized
it, isn't it?
MR. EASTON:

14

We're not unmindful of the fact that if

there's an entitlement, that then under the federal statute that
15

we have to meet that entitlement for Mr. Howe.

We’re saying

16

here, though., that there is no special entitlement that he is
17

entitled to, and therefore we shouldn't get bogged down on that
18

issue.

There is no special constitutional or statutory entitle­

19

ment that he deserves, and so to accept his argument that he's
20

got to have some specialized treatment, then that hampers the
21

ability of Vermont to properly administer its correctional
22

system, and I think this Court has long held that such a -23

QUESTION:

24

His argument is that he has a right to stay in the Vermont

1

system unless the federal system offers something that Vermont

2

does not offer in the way of special treatment.

3

MR. EASTON:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, I think the court below found -The Federal.Government' isn't just going into the

5

business of making their facilities available on a wholesale

6

basis.

7

MR. EASTON:

As the court below found, Justice Stevens,

8

even if some of the same activities and programs were available

9

in Vermont, they're less accessible to Mr. Howe because of his

10

11
12
13
14

need for maximum security incarceration.

We literally do not

have the ability on the long-term basis to house a prisoner of
this sort, and so therefore, while there may be some programs
that are parallel from our system into the federal system, for
a prisoner who is there on a long-term basis, who presents a
maximum security risk, as Mr. Howe did, then they're far less

15

accessible.

I think it’s interesting, it's contained in the

16

petition of certiorari in Hawaii v. Mederios, the finding of
17

the magistrate in Illinois who said the states are literally
18

faced with the unenviable position of having, if the returned
19

prisoners like this are returned to the states, then they're
20

placed in conditions that literally are inhumane and they'd be
21

making arguments for Eighth Amendment freedom, or the states
22

have to release them.

So, it puts us in a very untenable posi­

23

tion if we do not have the freedom and flexibility to contract
24

with the Federal Government for this type of prisoner.

QUESTION:

I take it that your friend's position

2

would be the same if the federal institution to which the trans­

3

fer was made were 200 yards away from your closed institution

4

in Vermont.

Do you assume that that's the case?

5

MR. EASTON:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. EASTON:

Well, petitioner's counsel said he wants

to be in Vermont, but the statute which he challenges --

10

11

It isn't the out-of-state factor, it's the

transfer to a federal institution.

8

9

I do, Your Honor, and also --

QUESTION:

That's a little sweeping for the argument,

QUESTION:

Well, it might have been the motivation

perhaps.

12

13

for his lawsuit.
MR. EASTON:

I think, perhaps.

14
QUESTION:

But his legal claim would be the same, as

15
the Chief Justice suggests, if the federal facility were 200
16
yards away from the state facility.
17
MR. EASTON:

I think, regardless of where the federal

18
facility is -19
QUESTION:

Yes; the issue is the same.

20

MR. EASTON:

That's correct. What I want to impress

21

upon the Court here is that there has been no finding by any of
22

the courts below that there is any constitutional right here,
23

.

nor is there any statutory right.

So absent that, I think it's

24
very important that the state administration -25

1

QUESTION:

Well, the claim certainly is that there's

2

a statutory right not to be in the custody of the Federal

3

Government.

4

of this prisoner by the Federal Government.

Their claim is that the statute forbids custody

MR. EASTON:

5

Perhaps I stated it wrong.

Let me say,

6

Justice White, that the issue is whether there is any entitle­

7

ment, despite the claim, whether the statute gives him any

8

entitlement.

QUESTION:

9
10

n
12
13
14
15

And we suggest that --

he says that

Well, you can call it what you want to, but

my custody by the United States is illegal.

And

he's making what's equivalent to a habeas corpus claim, which
is a classic claim under habeas corpus, that this custody is
illegal.
MR. EASTON:

First of all, he's not of course chal­

lenging Vermont's statute, he's challenging the federal statute
and the federal statute has been found to say that

we're

16

talking about care and custody and subsistence and education and
17

treatment and training, and he is challenging the treatment
18

aspect, trying to give that a primacy that it doesn'tdeserve.
19

QUESTION:

But Mr. Attorney General, actually, basi­

20

cally, as my brother White suggests, he's challenging his de­
21
tention by the federal authorities as illegal in violation of
22

the laws of the United States, isn't he?
23

MR. EASTON:

He has to.

However --

24

QUESTION:

Does that have anything to do with whether

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

40

1

he has an entitlement?

2

MR. EASTON:

He has to have some basis on which to

3

challenge his custody, and he's challenging the basis in the

4

statute under 5003.

5

QUESTION:

Yes, his challenge is that laws of the

6

United States expressly say you can't do this, you cannot

7

deliver me to a federal authority.
MR. EASTON:

8
9

5003 --

10

11

QUESTION:

He's invoking 5003.

QUESTION:

No, no -- no, no.

MR. EASTON:

12
13

He's attacking 5003 and his attack on

I'm sorry.

He's invoking it and

attacking the concept of treatment, suggesting that —
QUESTION:

14

He's claiming it under 4001 that the

Federal Government may not have custody of this prisoner unless
15

there is some other law that authorizes it.
16

MR. EASTON:

And then we get to 5003, which he

17

invokes, as Justice Stewart suggests -18

QUESTION:

His claim isn't on 5003; his claim is on

19

4001.
20

MR. EASTON:

Okay.

21

QUESTION:

It's illegal; this custody is illegal under

22

4001.
23

MR. EASTON:

Then he gets to 5003, piggy-backing, and

24

saying that under 5003 he's got to receive some specialized
25

treatment.

2

QUESTION:

No, it's the Government that's relying on

4

QUESTION:

No, he is.

5

MR. EASTON:

3

5003 .

Well, I think Justice White, in his ques­

6

tion that he presents, that he himself is saying that there's

7

got to be a finding under 5003.
QUESTION:

8
9

on the term "treatment" in 5003(a).
MR. EASTON:

10

11
12
13

I thought his entire argument was focusing

I believe that, is correct, as his counsel

stated, that it involves the construction of that statute.

And

he is suggesting that the word "treatment" in that statute be
given some sort of primacy that the court below found it not
necessary to give.

14

QUESTION:

Well, then, the case should be dismissed

15

for failure to state a federal question, to raise a federal
16

question within the jurisdiction of the Court under 1346.
17

MR. EASTON:

Now that it's here before this Court, I

18

think it would be helpful for the Court to dispose of it to
19

avoid this very troublesome situation that exists in the
20

circuits where the 7th Circuit has ruled one way and the 1st,
21

2nd, 3rd, and 10th Circuits -- because otherwise the states
22

will be —
23

QUESTION:

What would you say if he filed a petition

for habeas corpus against the federals?

Of course, you may not

even be in the case.

2

MR. EASTON:

QUESTION:

That's true.

He's entitled --

And saying that, basing it on 4001 saying,

4

my custody is illegal under 4001.

5

come back and say, sorry but it's authorized under 5003, as

6

a defensive matter.
MR. EASTON:

7

The United States would

What would happen is, I think we'd get in

8

that position that Justice Marshall suggested earlier, is that

9

we would have the prisoner trying to wander back and forth

10

between the two systems and that's the result -QUESTION:

11

MR. EASTON:

And hoping to get lost.
Exactly.

That's the result we want to

12

avoid by construing this statute, 5003(a), not to give him some
13

special entitlement to treatment.
14

QUESTION:

Your friend, I think, if I recall correctly,

15

conceded that there was nothing in Vermont law, including its
16

Constitution, to prohibit Vermont from having its penal insti­
17

tutions in another state.

Now --

18

MR. EASTON:

That's correct.

There's no challenge

19

to that.
20

QUESTION:

Hasn't the State of Vermont made this

21

federal facility its prison by making a contract under 5003,
22

making it a surrogate prison?
23

MR. EASTON:

Well, I think that we haven't gone that

24

far but we have integrated the Vermont system as part of our
25

North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

corrections philosophy, so that those who need the entitlements

which Vermont statutes give them, if offered by the federal

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. NELSON, ESQ.,

MR. NELSON:

Suppose

the universi­

ties, set up a private, nonprofit corporation to do better than
most of the penal institutions do, much like setting up the
postal corporation outside of the old system, do you say that
Vermont could not incarcerate its prisoners in that kind of an
institution?
MR. NELSON:
QUESTION:

Out of the state?
Anywhere.

Two hundred yards down the road

18

or 2,000 miles away in Alaska, or 3,000 miles.
19

MR. NELSON:

I can't point to anything in Vermont law

20

which would prohibit that but I don't feel confident in saying
21

that it would be authorized either.

It seems fishy, on the

22

face of it.

It's not -- the statutes which empower the Vermont

23

Commissioner of Corrections to incarcerate people speak of
24

incarceration generally within the state.

A particular statute

25
North American Reporting

44

1

was passed to permit incarceration in the federal system as a

2

reciprocal act to 5003.

statute to designate another agent to incarcerate its prisoners,

then the Vermont reciprocal statute would not have been neces­

12
13

it's even reasonable.

In the first

In this case we don't think

The circuit reached its decision, the

circuit said that it was construing the statute as it did, not
quite at face value.

The district court reached the decision

it did, indications in the legislative history to the contrary
notwithstanding.

Both of these sources, as well as the context

14

of other statutes in which 5003 sits, indicate that the agency's
15

current interpretation is simply not reasonable, not merely
16

that it's not preferable.
17

Secondly, the agency interpretation has varied.

The

18

original agency interpretation, after all, was a letter sub­
19

mitted to the judiciary committees of both House and Senate
20
stating that federal facilities were needed for specialized
21

cases, that there were requests received for specialized cases.
22

This, I think, is an agency interpretation made directly to a
23

house of Congress.
24

The formal agency interpretation of this statute is
