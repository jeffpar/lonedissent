PROCEEDINGS
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments next

in United States v. Turkette.
Mr. Levy, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK I. LEVY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LEVY;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the

10

United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

11

dent was convicted by a jury on eight counts of substantive

12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

Respon­

drug and mail fraud offenses and on one count of conspiracy
under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
In brief, the evidence at trial, the sufficiency
of which was not challenged, showed the Respondent organized
and headed a criminal association that engaged in a continuing
course of illegal activities for

profit.

The Turkette group

was in existence for more than a two-year period and was
involved in numerous offenses, including the theft and dis­
tribution of drugs, the commission and facilitation of mail

20

fraud by arson and other means, and the bribery of police
21

officers and witnesses to protect these illegal activities.
22

The group operated in a highly structured and so­
23

phisticated manner, in which different individuals performed
24

specific assigned roles to further the group's venture.

The questions presented by our petition are whether
2

7

the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act excludes
wholly illegitimate enterprises like Respondent's from the
scope of its coverage, and if so, whether automatic reversal
of Respondent's otherwise valid, non-RICO convictions
required on grounds of misjoinder.
QUESTION:

Well the First Circuit theory really was

8

that these people were so totally illegal that they had to

9

be acquitted,

10

11
12

13
14

wasn't it?

MR. LEVY:

I think that's correct.

And the Court

below stands alone in reaching that anomalous result.
QUESTION:

Or was it that they were so well organ­

ized in their enterprise that -MR. LEVY:

I believe the holding of the Court below

15

was that enterprises that are entirely and completely illegal

16

are not within the scope of the principal anti-racketeering

17

statute in the federal criminal code.

18

an anomalous result, and every other Court of Appeals to

19

consider the issue has concluded that RICO is not restricted

20
21
22
23
24
25

That strikes us as

to legitimate enterprises, but applies to illegitimate enter­
prises as well.
Nothing in the language of the statute distinguishes
between legitimate and illegitimate enterprises.

On the

contrary, the definition of enterprise states without qual­
ification that enterprise includes any group of individuals
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

associated in fact.

Similarly, the substantive provisions

2

of RICO draw no distinction between legitimate and illegit­
3
4
5
6

imate enterprises, but refer broadly to any enterprise.
Congress specifically reinforced the sweep of the statute

by providing that the provisions of RICO shall be liberally
construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.

7
8

9

And

In addition, despite the existence of an extensive
definitional section for the key terms used in RICO, the
statute offers no guidance whatever for defining the words

10

legitimate and illegitimate the Respondent and amici seek

11

to

insert into the statute.

12

QUESTION:

Under the First Circuit theory, on which

13

side of the line would fall an enterprise that had an appar­

14

ently legitimate front, that is? a truck line, or whatever, but

15

was --

MR. LEVY:

Well, I think that's difficult to --

extortion and loan sharking.

20

case take us?
MR. LEVY:

21

Where would the First Circuit

I don't think one knows with certainty,

22

because the meaning of the terms legitimate and illegitimate

23

are by no means self evident, and neither the statute nor the

24
25

legislative history offer any guidance on the meaning of those
terms.

Simply because Congress didn't have that concept in

mind.

3

it, it's impossible to know what are the salient considerations
or the proportion of legal and illegal activities --

4
5

QUESTION:

8

9

You think that's irrelevant?

What the

proportion is?

6

7

In your hypothetical, for example, as I understand

MR. LEVY:

We do, because we think both "legitimate"

and "illegitimate" are within the statute.

And we think

that the introduction of such an indefinite term as legitimate
enterprise would complicate and protract RICO trials, and

10

would lead to distinctions according to degree of legitimacy

11

that are entirely unrelated to Congress' purpose to eradicate

12

organized crime.

14

QUESTION:

has to be an enterprise.
MR. LEVY:

15
16

QUESTION:

21
22
23
24
25

And enterprise is defined in the

statute how, where is it?
MR. LEVY:

19
20

It is common ground that there has to

be an enterprise.

17
18

In any event, it's common ground there

Relevant here, enterprise is defined as

an entity consisting of a group of individuals associated in
fact.

That's the statutory definition of enterprise under

which this prosecution was brought.
QUESTION:

A corporation would be an enterprise.

MR. LEVY:

A corporation would also be an enterprise.

QUESTION:

Or a corporate association.

QUESTION:

Where is the statutory definition?

MR. LEVY:

It's in Section 1961(4) which is re­

printed in our Appendix to the petition.

5

QUESTION:

Thank you.

6

QUESTION: Well Mr. Levy, is there a difference

7

between an illegal 'enterprise and the coverage under the

8

Act of a group of persons who commit a pattern of racketeering

9

activities, that is two predicate acts, is there a difference

10

between the two?
MR. LEVY:

11

Well, if I understand the question cor­

12

rectly

I believe there is.

13

as in this case, a group of individuals associated in fact.
QUESTION:

14

An enterprise is an entity

Well no, what I'm trying to get at is

15

what distinguishes a group of persons who commit a pattern

16

of racketeering activities, that is, two predicate acts

17

from an illegal enterprise?
MR. LEVY:

18
19

20
21
22
23
24
25

The enterprise is an entity looking to

the common meaning of the word associate, and Congress used
the word associate in the definition of entity, we think that
means that the group of individuals had to join together
to form a confederacy or a union for some common purpose or
overall objective.
means.

We think that's what the word associate

Therefore, if there were simply two predicate acts,

that were unrelated to an enterprise, or simply isolated

11

one person could infiltrate another individual, I mean, if

12

you couldn't be prosecuted for your own activities you could

subvert an individual proprietorship of another.

14

MR. LEVY:

You might be able to, and that might

15

fall within either subsections (a) or (b), depending on the

16

method of infiltration.

17

QUESTION:

Kind of like the aliens?

18

MR. LEVY:

I'm sorry?

19

QUESTION:

After your answers to my colleagues'

20
21

questions, I get back to the question I asked you, Mr. Levy.
If an individual may be an enterprise and a group of persons
who commit 3- pattern of activities, that is, two

22
23
24
25

predicate acts, may also be an enterprise, then how -- what
is the difference between them and an illegal enterprise?
MR. LEVY:

The fact that a group of individuals

GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

/

1

commit two illegal acts does not ipso facto establish a
2
3
4
5

violation of the statute.

The two illegal acts, the pattern

of racketeering activity have to occur in a conduct of an
enterprise.

The word "enterprise " , the term is defined in

Section 1961(4).

6

QUESTION:

Well I know, but you've already told

7

us an individual may be an enterprise, a group of persons

8

committing two predicate acts may be an enterprise.

9

MR. LEVY:

They may be, but they are not necessarily.

10

QUESTION:

Well then I still ask you what -- how are

either

Aren't they illegal enterprises?

of those distinguished from "an illegal enterprise"?

MR. LEVY:

Perhaps I didn't understand the question.

QUESTION:

Well of course, what I'm getting at is,

the First Circuit as I read their opinion, had the idea that
to include an illegal enterprise within 1962(c) would make
that section internally redundant.
MR. LEVY: That was the suggestion of the First
Circuit, that's correct.
QUESTION:

What I'm just trying to find out is
North American Reporting

is that idea wholly without merit?
HR. LEVY:

We believe it is without merit; that

there is nothing that makes the provisions redundant or

internally inconsistent.

requirement that there be certain criminal acts.

had in mind, that the government's proof in a particular case

will be much the same to show the pattern element of the

offense and to show the enterprise element of the offense; the

11

fact that people commit a series of offenses together may

12

be a grounds for the jury to infer that they had joined

13

together to form an association in fact that would satisfy the

14

requirement of an enterprise.

15
16
17
18
19

But the fact that the government's proof may be
the same on those two issues does not make them any less
separate and distinct issues.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, while I have you inter­

rupted, Mr. Levy, looking at 1961(4), what's the meaning of
"union or group of individuals associated in fact although

20

not a legal entity."

What's that supposed to mean?

21

MR. LEVY:

Well I think the second clause of 1961(4)

22

was designed to expand the reach of the word enterprise to

include entities that are not in contemplation of law a

QUESTION:

Well, it's not that they wished them to be

immune from prosecution, but they -- Congress might rationally
have thought entirely illegitimate businesses are already

I don't doubt that Congress could have

It wouldn't have been totally irrational

10

for Congress to say well, since those are covered by existing

11

laws, the new law will try to reach something else.

MR. LEVY:

By definition, any prosecution under RICO

has to involve the violation of some other statutes.

And because of its primary concern, and

the legislative history is certainly replete with this, that
the primary concern of Congress -- this doesn't totally undercut
your argument at all -- was, the Infiltration of legitimate
business by organized crime.
MR. LEVY:

Nobody doubts that that was a principal

21

concern of Congress.

But it was by no means the exclusive

22

concern, and the legislative history doesn't indicate it was.
23

And the

dant need be a member of an organized crime or organized

12

criminal activity, much as in Culbert, the Court held that

13

the Hobbs Act was not limited in that way.

14

The statutory statement of findings in the legis­

lative history of RICO plainly revealed Congress' awareness

16

of and concern over organized crime's wholly illegal activities,

17

and nothing suggests that Congress intended these activities

18
19
20
21

to be left outside the scope of the statute by confining the
term enterprise to legitimate enterprises.
Moreover on several occasions, Congress indicated
that RICO would apply to illegitimate enterprises.

For

example, in the Senate Report, in discussing the civil pro­

visions of RICO, Congress referred to state cases in which
civil remedies had been used against illegal gambling and

24

prostitution businesses.

Similarly, Senator McClellan, the

principal sponsor of the legislation, explained that RICO
would apply to the counterfeit phonograph record business, to
the illicit

prescription drug industry and to stolen and

operations.
In the same vein, Congressman Poff, the sponsor of

the bill in the House observed that truck hijacking operations

would be subject to RICO; again an indication that Congress

Congress also recognized that illegal activities
constitute the economic foundation of organized crime and

provide the money and power used to infiltrate and corrupt

legitimate businesses, labor unions and government offices.

Thus even if the sole purpose of the statute were to pre­

to the redundancy of the statute about applying the criminal

that would also be a victim of a takeover by a larger illegal

MR. WALL:

Well, the reason that analogy is helpful

is that if we follow the Elliott definition and say that

history to support that very narrow reading?
MR. WALL:

Yes sir.

The whole, everything in the

legislative history.

Title 10.

They specifically went after

another aspect of organized crime, that's precisely the point

8

I'm making, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION:

What's collection of unlawful debt?

10

MR. WALL:

A gambling debt, I assume.

QUESTION:

Or usurious debts?

MR. WALL:

Or usurious, yes sir.

variety of criminal behavior?

I mean, this whole part that

we're talking about isn't for the benefit of the victims.
QUESTION:

It was to create criminal offenses.

MR. WALL:

It's to create a criminal -- a -- to focus

in on the protection of the victim; that's precisely the
purpose of 1962.
QUESTION:

But 1962 also makes criminal some conduct,

20
does it not?
21

MR. WALL:

It certainly does.

And it said, this

22
particular type of activity, this depredation that's taking
23

place on legitimate businesses, is serious enough that we're
24

making this drastic criminal penalties.

QUESTION:

Traditionally?

MR. WALL:

Yes sir.

QUESTION:

Previously, I understood you to say

15
16
17
18
19

that the term enterprise was just a one-way street, applied
only to one of the two, that is, victim or criminal actor,
you said it couldn't apply to the criminal actor?

Doesn't

1962(c) explicitly apply to the criminal actor and the victim;
20

or neither one?
21

MR. WALL:

Well, 1962(c) applies, I suggest, to

22

protect the victim; it prevents corruption or spoiling of
23

a legitimate business or a front business, as was suggested
24

by one of the questions, supposing there's an apparently

Who is the victim?

QUESTION:

Let's suppose something less.

Let's

suppose that if some group, one or 21 people, set up a
specialty of collecting illegal debts.

That is, usurious

debts, gambling debts, any other kind, and that's all they do.
You say they are not covered?

8

MR. WALL:

I say they are not covered.

9

QUESTION:

You mean, they can't be prosecuted under

10

this statute?

11

MR. WALL:

Under this particular statute, RICO, it

12

was not designed, it's -- it was not designed, and doesn't

13

make internal sense, and it destroys the traditional con­

14

spiracy and joinder rules if it is applied to that --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WALL: I suggest, Mr. Chief Justice Burger,

17

most respectfully, it destroys them.
QUESTION:

19

22

25

And it changes --

Isn't this one of the broadest nets that

Congress has ever thrown out to catch criminal activity?
MR. WALL:

20
21

Destroys them or supplements them?

It Is probably -- well, I suggest, it

may -- it is, .the Organized Crime Control Act is a very broad
net.

However, Congress did not set up RICO to get all possible

criminal activity, and they did not intend this body of lawyers
as Mr. Justice Rehnquist said in Alvarez, this body of
lawyers did not intend, when they passed RICO, to change the

rules of conspiracy, to change Kotteakos, and to change the
rules of joinder.

And if they did intend to do it, which

they didn't, but if they tried to, I suggest it would be
unconstitutional and this Court would have much to say about
that.

6

Members of the Court, it has been suggested that

7

even if this Court 'does agree with our view of the scope of

8

RICO, that my client should nevertheless have the First

9

Circuit reversal, the change, because there was harmless error

10

And our argument is, of course, that there was not harmless

11

error, that he was joined with other defendants he should

12

not have been, and that he was joined in a number of criminal

13

charges against him, that without the RICO expansion of con-

14

spiracy vehicle he could never have been tried together for.

15

QUESTION:

Did you ever seek a severance?

16

MR. WALL:

Yes sir.

17

QUESTION:

In the trial court?

18

MR. WALL:

Yes sir.

19

20

I represented Vargas at the

trial court, Your Honor, but as the First Circuit points out,
severances were sought by this defendant as well as Vargas,
and there were 'many written and oral requests, every few days

21
22

in this almost seven-week trial.

23

QUESTION:

Was the denial of severance appealed?

MR. WALL:

Well, you mean, an interlocutory appeal?

24

No sir.

It was appealed, the denial of severance, was appealed.

1

QUESTION:

After conviction?

2

MR. WALL:

Yes sir.

3

QUESTION:

What about the sentences?

On the sub­

4

stantive counts, didn't he not get sentences concurrent

5

with the sentence under the RICO count?

6

MR. WALL:

He did, Mr. Justice.

7

QUESTION:.

But he had -- how was he prejudiced?

8

The sentences under the substantive counts stand, don't

9

they?
MR. WALL:

10

11
12
13
14

They do, except for this.

The First

Circuit reversed because once the legally improper conspiracy
count is out, there is no basis, no legal basis for having
joined all these crimes.

And they cited McElroy v. The United

States -QUESTION:

The reversal gave them a new trial, does

MR. WALL:

It would get them a new trial.

QUESTION:

Gave them a new trial.

MR, WALL:

Yes sir.

QUESTION:

Just on the substantive counts, I gather?

MR. WALL:

That's correct.

15

it?
16
17
18
19
20

I suggest finally to this

21

Court, that the principles of severance enunciated in McElroy
22

and the language in Kotteakos which supports it, suggests that
23

he was damaged by going to trial in all these cases.

For

24

instance, Vargas was found not guilty by the jury on three of
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

40

1

the mail fraud counts.

Another defendant was found not

guilty of bribery in the police bribing count.

I'm suggesting

that to have gone to trial with all these crimes confounds
the defendant.

I'm suggesting he may well have, had a

5

good defense, say, to one or more of the arson or bribery

6

counts, and might have wanted to testify but was not able to

7

because of the drug charge.

8
9

QUESTION:

Did the United States urge harmless

error in the Court of Appeals?

10

MR. WALL:

Yes sir.

11

QUESTION:

And

12

MR. WALL:

Absolutely.

13

QUESTION:

But they held as a matter of law that

decided if against them?

14

reversal was required, regardless of whether it was harmless

15

error or not, didn't they?
MR. WALL:

16
17
18
19

Except for this:

I suggest the

intima­

tion is, and the fact is, that in these circumstances there's
certain error that is not harmless and never can be with this
illegal theory, never can be harmless.
And if I might take a moment just to remind all of

20

us that in Kotteakos, the Court of Appeals had said that
21

there was no prejudice, especially since guilt was manifest
22

and to reverse the conviction would be a miscarriage of jus­
23

tice.

But this Court, speaking in Kotteakos, said technical,

24

my foot, they said, what may be technical for one is substantia
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

41

1
2
3
4
5

for another. What .minor and unimportant in one setting, crucial
in another.
Moreover, lawyers know if others do not, that what
may seem technical may embody a great tradition of justice or
a necessity for drawing lines somewhere between great areas

6

of law, that in other words, one cannot always segregate the

7

technique from the 'substance, or the form from the reality.

8

I'm suggesting also, members of this Court, that in your

9

decision in Dunn that living, wonderful principle of our law

10

was.again upheld where the Court of Appeals in the Tenth Circuit

11

said, it's obvious there was a variant, sure, but the guy lied

12

under oath, even if it was in the lawyer's office, so let the

13

conviction stand.

14

Oh no, this Court, in a unanimous opinion written

15

by Chief Justice -- or rather, I'm sorry, by Mr. Justice

16

Marshall, stated:

17

same verdict had the prosecution built its case properly.

18
19

20
21

the jury well -- may well have reached the
But

the offense was not so defined, and appellate courts are not
free to revise the basis on which a Defendant is convicted
simply because the same result would likely obtain on retrial.
I suggest to the Court that in conjunction with the
principles enunciated in Kotteakos, and in Dunn, and in McElroy

22
23

and in King in the First Circuit, that the First Circuit
decision should stand.

Thank you.

MR. LEVY:
Justice.

ORAL REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK I. LEVY, ESQ.,

5
6

I only have two brief points, Mr. Chief

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LEVY:

First, Mr. Wall has argued that under the

7

statute, the enterprise must be the victim rather than the

8

means of the commission of the pattern of racketeering activity.

9

Nothing in the statute suggests or requires that, and indeed

10

the fallacy may be shown by the Ninth Circuit's decision in

11

the Zemek case cited in our reply brief, where the owner of

12

a tavern advanced his tavern business through extortion and

13

murder of his competitors.

14

a tavern and that was advanced rather than being the victim

15
16
17
18
19

20

In that case, the enterprise was

of the racketeering activity.
Second, in this case, there were legitimate businesses
that were harmed by Respondent's conduct.

Particularly the

drugstores that were burglarized and the insurance companies
that were defrauded were clearly harmed and that illustrates
how the application of RICO to an entirely illegitimate enter­
prise can serve to protect legitimate businesses from the

21

ill effects of racketeering.

Thank you.

22

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

23

The case is submitted.
24
25

(Whereupon, at 2;43 o'clock p.m. the case in the
above matter was submitted.)
