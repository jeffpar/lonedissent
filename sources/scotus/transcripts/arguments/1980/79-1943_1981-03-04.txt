ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE SACHS, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS IN NO. 79-1943

8

MR. SACHS:

9

it please the Court:

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

This matter involves consolidated matters arising

11

from the 3rd Circuit on appeal from and certiorari to the

12

3rd Circuit.

13

matter, and with the Court's permission I'll address the

14

203(a) issue of ERISA and Mr. Gettis will then address the

15

preemption question.

16

I'm of counsel in the Alessi v. Raybestos

The 3rd Circuit decided in this matter that not­

17

withstanding the very broad nonforfeitability guarantees in

18

Section 203(a) of the Pension Reform Act with respect to nor­

19

mal retirement benefits, that a workmen's compensation offset

20

provision in a retirement plan did not violate that statute.

21

The decision and analysis of the 3rd Circuit has

22

been disagreed with by at least one other circuit, the 6th,

23

and by at least seven district courts.

24

fully suggest that the 3rd Circuit paid excessive attention

25

to form and indeed to the form of a regulation whose nature
3

And I will respect­

1

the intended beneficiary, the IRS, does not agree with.

2

The fact of the matter in this situation is that

3

normal retirement benefits earned over the life careers,

4

working careers of the affected individuals, have indeed

5

been forfeited, and that is seen very directly by looking at

6

the facts.
QUESTION:

7

Let me ask you a question, if I may.

8

This ERISA statute does give authority to the Treasury

9

Department to issue regulations, does it not?

10

MR. SACHS:

11

QUESTION:

12

Yes, Your Honor, it does.
It is not just a question of adminis­

tering an act?

13

MR. SACHS:

No, that is correct.

There is certain

14

administrative authority with respect to Treasury; there is

15

certain administrative authority with respect to the Depart­

16

ment of Labor.

17

tive or rule-making authority which the 3rd Circuit conceived

18

to be applicable and which the Internal Revenue Service re­

19

nounces.

20

tive rule-making authority which the 3rd Circuit found.

21

Treasury purports to find that authority in an interpretive

22

basis.

23

the statute in question and indeed the argument made by the

24

Government brief here is contrary to the argument which it

25

made below.

But there is none of the kind of administra­

The Internal Revenue Service does not claim legisla­

19

plans, General Motors and Raybestos-Manhattan cut off the

20

pensions.

21

They in fact

They did so for several years, and then
They made an application for partial

This was for a

The pensions ceased at that point, in

an effort at

22

recoupment by both companies of an amount equivalent to the

23

workers' compensation awards.

24

under a plan which is plainly conditioning the benefits upon

25

forbearance from filing that workers comp, claim.

They did so in the case of GM

5

If the individuals in the GM plan

1

had not filed fox

2

workers' compensation, they would have continued to receive

3

their pension, and indeed had they filed their application

4

for workers' compensation within two years after they had re­

5

tired, under the plan itself GM could not have claimed an

6

offset.

7

first place, filing for workers' comp, cut off the pension;

8

in the second place, if that claim were not filed within two

9

years, the pension was cut off.

So there was a double condition here:

In the Raybestos plan

had always supposed to be part of the Treasury Department.

23

MR. SACHS:

24

QUESTION:

25

Not merely workers'

Yes, Your Honor.
So that, isn't it rather unlikely that

the Administrator of ERISA for Treasury would be at odds with
6

1

the Administrator of the IRS?
MR. SACHS:

2

I'm not suggesting a disparity of views

3

as between Treasury and IRS.

4

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

5

6

I did not mean to suggest that,

I thought you had said that the IRS took

a different view?
MR. SACHS:

7

Oh, I am saying that, sir, with respect

8

to the specific elements that are part of the offset In the

9

Raybestos plan. The Treasury rulings, pre-ERISA, which had

10

been invoked by the various defendants here and the various

11

amici supporting their position don't go so far as to permit

12

what Raybestos has done and claimed here, as part of this

13

plan.

14

IRS, we sought to suggest in the briefs and other

15

courts have recognized, has drawn absolutely irrational lines

16

as to what kind of offset is permitted or what kind of offset

17

is not permitted, and all I was meaning to suggest, Your

18

Honor, in my last comment, is that there are elements within

19

the Raybestos plan which don't satisfy even the irrational

20

standards of Treasury, as those had been enunciated in a

21

variety of Treasury rulings.

22

The point I seek to make here is that the reality

23

which is confronted here is that each of these individuals

24

who received a normal retirement benefit on account of age

25

and service suddenly had that benefit divested.
7

I should

Your Honor, there is no question that

the union was aware of that, but Your Honor's question was

23

related to the length and duration of these clauses, and my

response is that they came into the contracts in 1970 vir­

25

Well, I understand.

It seems to me

4

you're making sort of an equitable argument when we really

5

have a rather dry statutory question.

MR. SACHS:

Well, the equitable argument is rele­

7

vant, Your Honor, because of the congressional purpose, and

8

that is the key, I would respectfully submit.

9

this is not --

QUESTION:

Congress said

You'd make the same argument, even if

11

this had been in the plan for 40 years and everybody knew

about it, it seems to me.

I would certainly be making that argument.

15

point because there is a claim of reliance, there is a claim

16

on contractual provisions, as though that could somehow over­

17

come the statute.

18

point, additionally, that I wanted to make is that the work­

19

men's compensation benefits which was awarded under New Jersey

20

law had no relationship to wage loss, was not dependent on

21

wage loss, and in fact it would have been paid and could have

22

been paid had the claim been made while these men were still

23

working and had not retired.

25

But I make the

So that we ought to dismiss from the picture any
suggestion here that they are somehow receiving workmen's

ceived.

3

fit was earned.

4

Mr. Justice Stevens, Congress said in enacting this statute

5

that we are deaing here with reform.

6

called a pension reform act; this is a broad remedial statute.

7

And what Congress wanted to do, and the debates make abso­

8

lutely clear it wanted to do, was inject notions of equity,

9

so that workers'

10

These are different benefits.

The retirement bene­

But, directly responsive to your question,

That's why this is

legitimate expectations could be realized.

And there were two particular areas in the matter

1 1

of vesting that we're talking about, in addition to the other

12

remedies this statute was designed to achieve which are per­

13

tinent here.

14

When we're talking about vesting, what Congress

15

wanted to assure is, one, that when the time for retirement

16

came, there would be money in the coffers to pay the pension.

17

And that's what this Court dealt with in Nachman.

18

thing Congress wanted to do was to make sure that the small

19

print would not take away what the employee anticipated over

20

his working career he was in fact going to receive.

21

that is why, based upon the findings of Congress, that

22

workers with long years of service and significant periods of

23

service were losing the retirement benefits on which they

24

had planned for a working career lifetime.

25

And the other

And

Congress enunciated an extraordinarily broad rule
10

1

in Section 203(a).

It's stated that all is forbidden except

2

which we permit with respect to normal retirement benefits.

3

203(a) says that a worker is entitled, and coupling this with

4

definitions in (3), part 19, of the Act, "a worker is entitled

5

to an unconditional right to fulfillment of his normal retire­

6

ment benefit when he reaches normal retirement age and when

7

he attains any of the alternative minimum mandatory vesting

8

schedules of the Act."
Now, when Congress intended exceptions it said what

9
10

it wanted to do.

11

which it was willing to recognize, and this is not one of

12

them.

13

compensation, never; never in this Act, never before this Act,

14

never in any pre-ERISA history has Congress ever acknowledged

15

the euphemism which is used by the defendants that this has

16

something to do with integration,

17

the 3rd Circuit was, unfortunately, taken.

18
19

20

And in 203(a)(3) it stated the exceptions

Congress did not permit any exception for workers'

Your contention, then, is that the regu­

specific exceptions to 203(a), which are enumerated, and

which have nothing to do with this.

narrow argument that the Court of Appeals made?

10

They argue there's

What's

wrong with that argument?
MR. SACHS:

1 1

Your Honor, if I may, not merely

12

evidence; the statute does speak explicitly to social security

13

in 206(b) of ERISA and in 401(a)(15) of the Tax Code, which

14

was added by ERISA, Congress agonized about integration of socic 1

15

security benefits. Congress didn't see this as a solution, it

16

saw it as a problem, that of social security benefits.

17

the compromise which Congress reached in enacting ERISA was

18

to say for the moment, we'll freeze social security levels of

19

integration so that if they go up, you can't cut down the

20

amount of pension which is otherwise going to be payable.

21

And

But the point, Your Honor, is they addressed social

22

security as such, explicitly legislated on social security

23

as such.

24

were claiming that if you can't fix social security under one

25

of the sections to 203(a), it can't stand.

The 3rd Circuit somehow had the notion that we

As part of that analysis, Congress in permitting

18

considered adoption of this statute, they were very much con­

20

But they also recognized that there were cost factors as to

social security, and the compromise is what I have indicated.

The point I simply want to conclude with is that Con­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARC C. GETTIS, ESQ.,

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 80-193
MR. GETTIS:

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This Court is now in possession of a handful of

5

6

briefs from respondent, appellant, and various amici, all of

7

which briefs cite the same legislative history and quote the

8

same statements from Senators Williams and Javits and Repre­

9

sentative Dent regarding the broad nature of preemption under

10

Section 514 of ERISA.
Petitioners herein

1 1

have never contended otherwise.

12

We've agreed all along that Section 514 does provide for broac

13

preemption.

14

of these briefs virtually ignore the existence of Section

4(b)(3) of ERISA.

laws.

MR. GETTIS:

We do contend that this is unauthorized

7

MR. GETTIS:

9

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, are you refer­

What I was just --

You're addressing the preemption act?
Yes, but I do concur that that regula­

tion is invalid and unauthorized.

I'm suggesting that the

10

statute itself permits state regulation of workers' compensa­

1 1

tion, and this Court has recognized that the employment rela­

12

tionship, including workers' compensation, which protects

13

against injury suffered in the course of employment, is a

14

traditional area of state interest.
A number of cases have been cited standing for the

15
16

proposition of broad preemption.

17

of the 3rd Circuit below, no case has held a state workers'

18

compensation statute preempted.

19

and one court of appeals, the 9th Circuit, has recognized

20

workers' compensation laws of states as an exception to the

21

preemption doctrine of ERISA.

22

But other than the decision

In fact, one district court

The focus of the inquiry under 4(b)(3) should not

23

be, as our adversaries suggest, whether a plan is exempt under

24

Your Honor, that's quoted at page 19

state court has ordered a pensioner's pension benefits to be

8

garnished or severed to satisfy that worker's obligations

9

under state laws, either support obligations or community

10

property laws.

11

and the 9th Circuit, have held that such state laws are not

preempted under ERISA, that these laws only marginally affect

pension plans and are within an area of strong state interest.

18

We agree with our adversaries' contention that

ERISA preemption is intended to assist in the congressional

goal of providing for uniform regulation of pension plans, but

Even if this Court should find that Section 203

QUESTION:

What petitioners are con­

Well, the preemption does not apply to

7

plans maintained solely for the purpose of complying with

8

state -- which is not this plan.

9

MR. GETTIS:

That Is not this plan.

What we suggest

10

is that the inquiry is not whether the plan is a 4(b)(3)

11

plan, but rather to the underlying workers' compensation law.

12

In other words, if a plan is maintained to comply for workers'

13

compensation purposes and that plan is exempt under ERISA, it

14

must follow that the underlying workers' compensation law

15

enacted by the state with which that plan, for which it was

16

created, must not be preempted.

17

not possible that the underlying state statute is not exempt.

18

QUESTION:

I don't follow the argument.

What it

seems to me that the statute says is that a workmen's comp,

MR. GETTIS:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. GETTIS:

That is true, Mr. Justice Stevens.
That's all it really says.
Well, we suggest that in 4(b)(3)

24

Congress has shown an intent to allow states to regulate

25

certain areas, traditionally within state regulation, not to
22

1

regulate pensions but to regulate these particular areas, and

should that regulation "relate to pension plans," that will

not invalidate the state statute.

That evidence exists in Section 401(a)(15) of the

21

22

Code and Section 206(b) of ERISA.

Contrary to the petitioners'

23

and appellants' argument, those sections do not authorize

24

social security or railroad retirement benefit integration.

25

They

merely describe a limitation upon that integration,
25

1

a limitation, moreover, which was neither new to ERISA -- on

2

the contrary, the legislative history makes clear that the

3

two sections merely codified with a slight extension the pre­

4

existing IRS administrative practice on limiting social

security integration.
Now, Section 203(a) requires that the employee's

6
7

right to his normal retirement benefit be nonforfeitable.

It

8

does not say what that normal retirement benefit is to be.

9

Neither does the Section 3(19) definition of nonforfeitable.

10

It merely refers to the benefit under the plan, as does the

1 1

Section 3(22) definition of normal retirement benefit.

If he's retired and wasn't working he

No, sir, no I did not.

I did not mean

to say that.

MR. REICH:

That's what I understood you to say.
I said he may get disability retirement

he retires.

for its employees, the employer faces two competing interests.

4

The employees want the employer to agree to pay them and to

assure them some level of monthly income during retirement.

The employer as a businessman is willing to incur some level

7

of retirement costs for his employees but no more.

QUESTION:

Mr. Casey, how do you -- do you have an

answer to Mr. Gettis's argument based on 4(b)(3)?
MR. CASEY:

Your Honor, Mr. Gettis basically argues

6

that ERISA does not preempt and includes express relief from

7

preemption for any state law related to retirement plans so

8

long as it is part of the workers' compensation statute.

9

This simply misstates the statute.

The statute relieves from

10

all the coverage provisions of ERISA, including the vesting

11

funding, any plan that's maintained solely to comply with the

12

workers' compensation law.

13

As Mr. Gettis stated and it has always been agreed,

14

that these plans simply are not maintained solely to comply

15

with the workers' compensation law.

16

statute directly prohibits a private plan from providing a

17

benefit during retirement integrated with other benefits the

18

private employer pays at the same time, concurrently, period­

19

ically, with that retirement income.

20

these private retirement plans and directly regulates the

21

terms and conditions of the retirement plans.

I suggest to you that by this Act everything has

13

changed.

In the first place, those practices which are

sought to be escalated here into justification for continua­

Now, it's been suggested to you that nothing has

doesn't appear in the plan, but it's the euphemism which now

19

permeates all the briefs -- 401(a)(5) says that the difference

20

may be permitted "because of any retirement benefits created

21

under state,or federal law."

22

Now, the U.S. brief to the 3rd Circuit acknowledged

23

that the word retirement had to be read into the regulation

24

it was relying on.

9

In fact, we demonstrated in

in the light of the argument made that there is a misquotation

10

in the appellees' brief, I'm sure inadvertent.

But if you

1 1

will look at page 26 of the brief of appellees, which talks

12

about the alleged change, fact that there is no change, the

13

sentence reads, purporting to quote from the committee report:
"Moreover, the conferees intend that the anti-

14
15

discrimination rules of present law are not to be

16

changed."
The legislative history, at 3 Legislative History

17
18

4544, inserts after the word "law" the phrase, "in areas

19

other than the vesting schedule."

20

read:

21

So the sentence should

"Moreover, the conferees intend that the anti-

22

discrimination rules of present law in areas other

23

than the vesting schedule are not to be changed."
