ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT G. HARBISON, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

7

MR. HARBISON:

8

10

11

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Kent Harbison and I represent the peti­
tioners in this case, those Minnesota officials charged with
the responsibility of managing the annual Minnesota State Fair.

12

The question before this Court is whether that State Fair, con­
13

sistent with the First Amendment, may enforce a rule that essen­
14

tially provides that all those persons or organizations who
15

participate in the annual affair who desire to sell products,
16

solicit monetary donations, or distribute literature or any
17

other materials, whether it be flags, flowers, or whatever, may
18

do so, but only from rented booths or similar fixed locations
19

on the ground.
20

This case began in August of 1977 when the respon­
21

dents, the Krishna Society, commenced a lawsuit in the state
22

district court and obtained a temporary restraining order from
23

that court enjoining the fair from enforcing that rule as it
24

applies to them during that year's fair.

The restraining order,

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

3

1

however, also enjoined the Krishnas themselves from selling any

2

of these items that I've mentioned on a peripatetic basis

3

throughout the fairgrounds.

4

restraining order was to say, the state fair cannot require

5

these respondents to engage in these activities

6
7

only at a

booth, but they must be permitted to do it throughout the fair­
grounds .
QUESTION:

8

9

In other words, the effect of that

Mr. Harbison, does the record show what

happened in succeeding years?
MR. HARBISON:

10

QUESTION:

11

' 78 ,

'79 ,

Since that restraining order?

You spoke of the 1977 fair.

What about

'80?

12

MR. HARBISON:

Your Honor, the restraining order ap­

13

plied to the '77 fair.

In 1978, just before the 1978 fair,

14

the state district court granted summary judgment in favor of
15

the state fair.

Therefore, the booth rule was applied during

16

the 1978 fair because the state had received a favorable deci­
17

sion.

That was then appealed by the respondents to the Minne­

18

sota Supreme Court which reversed that decision in a 5-to-3
19

opinion.

That decision did not come down until, as I recall it,

20

just before the 1980 fair.

This court then accepted the case to

21

review it in January of this year.
22

QUESTION:

Well, let me ask specifically, did the

23

Krishna group have a booth in '78,

'79, or '80, arid did they solic it

24

at all on the grounds during those years?
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

4

1

MR. HARBISON:

Your Honor, they did not have a booth

2

and the record doesn't indicate whether or not they solicited

3

during the '78 or '79 or '80 fairs, in part because the record,

4

the trial court record was closed at that time.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Harbison, following up on Justice

6

Blackmun's question,

7

the bottom of the page you make the statement, "in fact, even

8

under current state fair policy, Krishnas could proselytize

9

among and speak with fairgoers and then direct interested donors

10
11
12
13
14

at pages 35 and 36 of your brief,

at

or purchasers to their booth."
Now, does that represent a change in the regulation or
does that represent your definition of proselytize as opposed
to solicit?

The words "proselytize" and "solicit" have been

used kind of interchangeably and confusingly, given all the
court opinions and briefs in the case.

15

MR. HARBISON:

I'll attempt to see if I can add some

16

definition to that.

The policy has always been, not just at

17

that time or even now, under the booth rule -- and that's the
18

rule we're talking about here -- that the state fair would not
19

try to prevent anyone from engaging in oral conversations, and
20

the phrase "proselytizing," the way

I've intended to use it in

21

the brief and I think the way the Minnesota Supreme Court viewed
22

it, meant the practice of talking to someone and trying to con­
23

vert them to a particular group's religious or political beliefs.
24

That statement on pages 35 and 36 is not meant to indicate that
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

5

1

that's somehow a change of policy.

2

ways been under the booth rule.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. HARBISON:

5

QUESTION:

That's the way it has al­

That is, other fairgoers could -- ?
Anyone, Your Honor.

In fact --

Or anybody inside the premises could try tc

6

convince anybody else of the wisdom of his religious or other

7

ideological beliefs and direct such a person to the Krishna

8

booth?

9
10

11
12
13

MR. HARBISON:

Exactly right, Your Honor.

In fact,

the only prerequisite to gaining entrance to access inside the
fairgrounds is the payment of a customary admission fee.
the only prerequisite.

That's

Once a person gets into the fairgrounds,

the booth rule has no relationship to them whatsoever so long
as they engage in the activities you're describing.

14

QUESTION:

So long as they don't try to collect money

15

or sell something?
16

MR. HARBISON:

So long as they don't try to collect

17

money or sell things or distribute things in that connection.
18

QUESTION:

Well, but, it does prevent the distribu­

19

tion of any piece of paper?

If the man -- if one of the solici­

20

tors makes a speech to somebody, which you say he can do, but
21

then says, here's a copy of what I said, he may not do that?
22

MR. HARBISON:

That he may not distribute literature

23

or any other kinds of materials.
24

QUESTION:

Yes, all right.

25
North American Heportinq

MR. HARBISON:

1

And part of the reason as indicated

2

in this case, the record shows that with respect to these

3

respondents -- and I think they indicate this in paragraph 11

4

of the stipulation -- that they don't merely want to just dis­

5

tribute the flowers and the books and the magazines and the

6
7
8

buttons or whatever it may be, but indeed, they want to collect
money for them.

accompanies that sort of activity.
I'd like to give the Court a little bit of a factual

9
10

So there is always the monetary exchange that

outline of what the fair is like and the types of crowds and
congestion that we're describing in our brief.

The fair is helc

11

every year for a 12-day period in a permanently enclosed fair­
12

grounds occupying about 125 acres in St. Paul, Minnesota.
13

QUESTION:

How many acres of that are actually devotee

14

to booths?
15

MR. HARBISON:

Your Honor, only about 40 to 45 of

16

those acres, or about one-third of that area, comprises that
17

part of the fairgrounds where most of the booth operations and
18

the fairgoing traffic occurs.

The rest of it is parking lots

19

and storage facilities and so forth.
20

QUESTION:
21
22
23
24

What else is there?

An athletic field?

Or a racetrack, anything like that?
MR. HARBISON:

There's a racetrack, Your Honor.

There's a racetrack that's connected with the grandstand that
-- I don't think the record indicates -- but it seats several

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

7

1

2
3
4
5

thousand people.

There are in an average year more than 1.3

million people who attend this 12-day event and I emphasize it's
not merely just a location, but it is an event that the state
stages for a limited period each year.

That breaks down to

about 115,000 people per day during the week in this 40-to-45
acre area, and approximately 160,000 people per day on weekends.

6

And as I said, the only requirement for those people

7

to get into the fairgrounds is if they pay the customary admis­
8
9

sion fee.
QUESTION:

Has it always been that size, or was it

10

expanded after the automobile age came along?
11

MR. HARBISON:

Your Honor, I personally don't know

12

that and I don't think the record indicates that but my under­
13

standing is that the Minnesota State Fair has for many years
14

been among the top two or three state fairs in the country in
15

terms of size and number of fairgoers.

The booth rule that

16

we're talking about is an inherent inseparable part of the
17

state fair, and that's in part because the state fair has a
18

system called the space rental system.
19

20
21
22
23
24

And under that the

state fair enters into lease agreements with all these organiza­
tions and people who desire to sell and solicit and distribute
materials.

Under these lease agreements these people and

organizations are required to conduct these activities at a
booth that requires them to post an identification sign that
clearly in some manner informs the fairgoing public as to who

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

8

1

they are or at least gives them some idea of the nature of the

2

booth operation.

3

QUESTION:

When you speak of the booths, are you in­

4

cluding under that term the halls and areas where they have

5

farm machinery and other machinery?
MR. HARBISON:

6

Yes, Your Honor.

The booth rule in a

7

sense is somewhat of a misnomer in that we're not talking only

8

about little stands and booths but I am using the term to mean

9

fixed locations generally.

10

11

sometimes it's a location known as Machinery Hill that perhaps
Your Honor is referring to.
QUESTION:

12
13
14
15

Sometimes it's Inside buildings,

Is the statement in your joint appendix at

A-49 - A-52 listing all the organizations, the Seventh Day
Adventists, the Lutheran Council, Abortion Rights Council, the
American Association for Retired Persons, et cetera, are those
all people who have rented booths?

16

MR. HARBISON:

Your Honor, these are all organizations

17

that have rented booths for a number of years from the state
18

fair.

In fact, there are approximately 1,400 booth operations

19

on the fairgrounds during the period covered by this case, and
20

these organizations that you're referring to, Your Honor, repre­
21

sent at least 40 of the organizations who at the time were con­
22

sidered to qualify probably as religious or political or news
23

media type organizations.

I think under the respondents'

24

current proposal In their brief, that this be expanded to
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

9

1

include charitable and noncommercial organizations as well.

2

I think it's likely that a significant number, in

3

addition to these, of the 1,400

4

under that definition, whatever the definition may be.

5

booth operators would

qualify

But the rule, again, doesn't have any effect whatso­

6

ever on the ability or the right of anyone to engage in some

7

communications or proselytizing, however you want to phrase it.

8

It relates primarily to the distribution and the monetary ac­

9

tivities.

The respondents in this case are a religious organi­

10

zation

11

That consists of a number of aspects, singing, dancing, chant­

12
13
14
15
16
17
18

whose members engage in an activity known as Sankirtan.

ing, selling not only books but other tokens, and soliciting
donations.
The first aspects of that, the first three, the sing­
ing, dancing, and chanting, the respondents don't claim or aren t
pressing this Court or any other court that we're aware of as
covered by their First Amendment arguments.

In other words,

they're not -- perhaps they would be covered by it, I suppose,
but they're not pressing those claims.

We're only worried

19

about the latter three.
20

QUESTION:

Suppose the American Legion Drum and Bugle

21

Corps wanted to have a parade through the streets and through
22

the area to stimulate patriotic reactions, could they do that
23

under these regulations?
24

MR. HARBISON:

Your Honor, they would not be able to

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

10

1

do that, I think.

2

rule but because of the state fair management's inherent respon­

3

sibility, as this Court recognized in Cox v. New Hampshire,

4

which involved public streets, the responsibility to maintain

5

some order so that they're not overlapping parades, if you will.

6

And I suggest that in this case there is even more evidence thar

7

there was in Cox v. New Hampshire that that sort of conflict

8

would be posed.

9

gation, in fact, to the public to control that sort of activity.

And not only so much because of the booth

The state fair would have a right and an obli­

have to be done in an orderly fashion so that there would be

13
14

16
17
18

It just means it would

some order in an already crowded area, 40 to 45 acres, which on a
typical day. would

have

between 100,000 and 200,000 people.

I'd like to mention one more factual point here,
I think that is of interest to this case, and that is, after
the 1977 restraining order, there were about 17 or 18 members
of ISKCON or Krishnas who did participate in the fair and
engage in these activities outside the confines of a booth.
That was consistent with the restraining order.

What was not

19

consistent, however, was the fact that they did sell, they did
20

engage in sales.

The restraining order basically said that if

21

you wish to sell something you still have to do that from a
22

booth, but the other aspects of the booth rule we enjoin -23

the court, meaning "we" -- enjoin as to the Krishnas.
24

In addition, the record shows that even just during
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

11

1

this five or six-day period when these sales and solicitations

2

were taking place, the Krishnas represented -- I should say, mis'

3

represented themselves to the potential donors and purchasers,

4

indicating that they represented something called the Division

5

of Natural Resources, and schools for needy and handicapped

6

children, drug treatment programs, and indeed the state fair it­

7

self.

8

took place with respect to donors who were minors.

9

And there is also evidence that these sorts of things

It's been suggested by the respondents that this booth

10

rule is a totally preclusive regulation, and it strikes me that

11

if that were the case it would be virtually Impossible ever to

12
13
14
15
16
17

have any sort of regulations that weren't preclusive in some
way, and it would be impossible to apply the balancing test, the
reasonable time, place, and manner test, because there was al­
ways going to be some preclusion.

In fact, I refer the'Court

to the alternative suggested by the Minnesota Supreme Court and
by the respondents themselves as alleging, allegedly, less
restrictive alternatives.

They themselves involve some preclu­

18

sive aspects and again, the booth rule, not only does and
19

doesn't do what I've already discussed, but it doesn't give
20

the state fair or any state official any discretion whatsoever
21

to determine whether or not someone shall abide by the rule or
22

whether they shall not.

It's applied nondiscriminatorily on

23

its face, and as applied it has absolutely no relationship to
24

the ideology or the content of anyone's political or religious
25
North American Heportinq
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

12

1

beliefs.

2

proselytizing or oral conversations at all.

And as I said, it doesn't prohibit any sort of oral

3

One of the things at this stage of the case that I

4

think is critical is that the respondents have now abandoned

5

what I believe to be the basis, the key basis, for the Minne­

6

sota Supreme Court's decision.

7

making a claim that they are entitled to a single exemption

8

from the booth rule because of some unique status that they have

9

because of this practice of Sankirtan.
QUESTION:

10

11

14
15
16

You mean they've abandoned the Sankirtan

argument, do you think?
MR. HARBISON:

12
13

That is, they're no longer

It may be overstating it to say they

have totally abandoned it.

It sounds to me in their brief now

as if they're making some sort of an alternative argument.
But what sticks out to me, Your Honor, is the fact that I think
they are recognizing that those aspects of Sankirtan that in­
volve religious solicitations or whatever are no different than

17

those of any other political or religious organization.
18

QUESTION:

Well, at

page 47 of their brief they

19

say, "Respondents seek no unique treatment within this category.1'
20
I would take that to mean that they would agree that
21

other organizations should be treated the same as they should.
22

MR. HARBISON:

Exactly, Your Honor, and that's my

23

point.
24

QUESTION:

Or a candidate for a political office?

sales and

monetary exchanges and distributions of materials.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, your justifications have

been, as I recall it, safety and the prevention of fraudulent
practices.

On the latter, prevention of fraudulent practices,

how does a prohibition against distribution of literature fur­

I'm not speaking now of the fund raising

16

but the distribution of -17

QUESTION:

23

MR. HARBISON:

this case there is still some relevance regarding the control

on fraudulent practices.

and even the stipulation, again, in paragraph 11, the Respon­

6

it's not

11

just a pure distribution activity.
Well, I don't quite -- how does that make

it fraudulent?
MR. HARBISON:

9
10

They want to get money

Now, whether that call that a sale or a donation,

QUESTION:

7

Because if you look at the record,

Because of the fact that there is

money involved, Your Honor, and the record already indicates
that they have in getting this money have represented them­
selves to be agents of organizations for which they are not.

12
13

And beyond that, with respect -QUESTION:

Couldn't they do that in a booth?

14

MR. HARBISON:

Your Honor, they could do that In a

15

booth and we don't mean to suggest that deceptive sales don't
16

take place at booths, they surely do.

But what the booth

17

rule does is provide some accountability, some control of the
18

fair, because the booth operators have a contract with the
19

fair, the fair knows who the owners and operators of the booth
20

are, they know where they're located, the booths must have iden­
21

tification signs identifying who they are and what their pur­
22

poses are.
23

QUESTION:

Well, I gather, Mr. Harbison, your answer

24

to me is that prevention of deceptive practices in connection

He just wants to hand out something with his picture on

MR. HARBISON:

I think, Your Honor, it's still possi­

3

ble to have that but beyond that there are other public purposes
4

that this booth rule serves. And in fact, the Minnesota Supreme
5

Court expressly found that even the public purpose, the govern­
6

mental interest of providing order and in traffic control and
7

minimizing congestion in an already crowded place is a substan­

tial governmental interest that is significantly furthered by
9

the booth rule.

QUESTION:

Is there any -- ?

Well, I think -- we know that, we recognize that,

Your Honor.

But what I'm saying is, to the extent that happens,

and we acknowledge it, the state fair is more able to control
that sort of thing at a booth because they know who the people
are.

But, if one has a roving solicitor or vendor walking

religious record and it turns out to be something totally dif­
11

ferent, or any other example, by the time that the purchaser
12

or the donor is aware of that, there's no way you can do any­
13

thing about it.

Now, it might be a little bit easier to pick

14

out somebody in this kind of a crowd if they somehow appeared
15

unique, but the indications are that these roving vendors and
16

solicitors look pretty much like everyone else.
17

QUESTION:

Mr. Harbison, I understand what you're

18

saying when the money changes hand.
19
20
21

22
23
24

But part of the attack on

the rule is an overbreadth attack, that it's overbroad because
it covers the handout of written material even though these
people want to get money for it.

How do you defend the prohi­

bition if you don't rely on littering?

How do you defend the

prohibition of handing out material for no money?
MR. HARBISON:

With respect to the overbreadth attack

25

17

1

even, it seems to me, under this Court's decisions such as -in

matically be applied and in fact, I think, the phrase, "sub­

QUESTION:

Well, let's assume for the moment -- I mean,

one argument you make is there should be no overbreadth analy­
sis. But assume for a moment we were going to say, yes, we'll
look at it under overbreadth.

Do you defend the rule to --

say, the plaintiffs here just wanted to hand out leaflets like
a political candidate.

Do you defend the rule as applied just

to that and, if so, why, if it's not based on littering?
MR. HARBISON:

Well, Your Honor, that is just one com­

12

ponent of it.

But beyond that --

13

QUESTION:

I

want

to

know what your justification

14

for that component is.
15

MR. HARBISON:

Our argument is that it -- especially

16

in contrast with the way the fairgrounds and the fair is set up
17

now, if you have someone walking around the fairgrounds handing
18

out materials -- and I think that it would be very difficult to
19

start drawing lines between the kinds of things that would be
20

distributed, but it seems to me that if you had that sort of
21
22

activity going on with not just the Krishnas but 10 or 20 or 30
representatives from perhaps 30 to 60 or 70 groups, that inevi­

23

tably is going to draw more attention and going to cause or
24

create more or less moving pockets or moving congested crowds,

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

18

1

because of the fact that someone is doing something unique on

2

the fairgrounds, especially giving something away free, I think

3

that's going to --

QUESTION:

respect to that, that those fairgoers may not know that right
away until they actually get up there and receive it, but if all
of a sudden the crowd becomes aware of the fact that dozens of
people are walking around passing out materials and they're
going to inevitably be attracted by that.

QUESTION:

Whereas, they wouldn' t

That's how --

Well, you — I take it that if the county

officer who is running for office puts a sign on his back, vote
14

for me, with his picture on, or'on his hat, on his straw
15

hat, you'd let him do that, and you'd let him stop people and
16

try them into voting for him.

And it might even be that it

17

would be simpler to let him pass out a card rather than to
18

try to buttonhole people and talk to them.
19

MR, HARBISON:

Your Honor, that sort of thing, to my

20

knowledge of the record, hasn't happened, and my point would
21

be that the booth rule doesn't have to be perfect.

What it has

22

to be is a reasonable attempt to accommodate a number of con­
23

flicting interests.
24

QUESTION:

So, In short, your answer to my brother

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

19

1

Stevens, I gather, is you justify it on the basis of crowd con­

2

trol or traffic control.

3

MR. HARBISON:

Is that it?
Yes, Your Honor.

It is also related,

4

I would think, to the protection of the fairgoers' rights of

5

privacy themselves, particularly when we're talking about the

6

7
8
9
10

11

potential of dozens or maybe several hundred solicitors.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, Mr. Harbison, when did the

Krishnas first request booth space at this fair?
MR. HARBISON:

Your Honor, I don't recall if the re­

cord indicates that, but to my knowledge it was sometime in
May or June of 1977.
QUESTION:

And was this after this booth rule had

12

first been promulgated?
13

MR. HARBISON:

Your Honor, this booth rule has been

14

in existence since 1966, at least, and that's before the
15

Krishnas were even in this country,
16

QUESTION:

So that at least its promulgation had

17

nothing to do with the arrival of the Krishnas?
18

MR. HARBISON:

Absolutely nothing.

In fact, Your

19

Honor, they did not apply for booth space.

They were informed

20

that the booth rule existed and they informed the fair that
21

they didn't feel they had to submit to it.
22

I'd like to make one comment about another argument
23

that's raised in the respondents' brief, and that is that the
24

primary purpose, despite what I've just gone through on these

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

20

1

other purposes, the primary purpose of this rule is alleged to

2

be to insulate potentially receptive listeners or audiences

3

from all communications.

4

step. - That is just plain wrong.

5

there is implicit in that some sort of improper motivation and

6

I think the comment I just made about when the booth rule was

7

enacted cuts against that.

8

respect to that context, the only difference between a booth

9

operator and a roving vendor is the ability to pursue and follow

0

First, it seems to me that

But, the only difference with

an unwilling audience or listener

or purchaser or donor.

A booth operator cannot go after a fairgoer who walks

11
2

They have to take some affirmative

by the booth and declines the sales pitch or the solicitation.
QUESTION:

3

Does the record show whether barkers are

permitted outside of the booths or inside the booths?
4

MR. HARBISON:

It doesn't show, Your Honor.

But I

5

would think that under the booth rule it's pretty clear that
6

whether they're standing in front of it or behind it they've
7

got to stay generally In that location.
8

QUESTION:

Who owns the fairgrounds?

9

MR. HARBISON:

The State of Minnesota does, Your

20

Honor.
2

QUESTION:

Is this a -- and the booth rule Involves

22

the charge of rentals for the booths, doesn't it?
23

MR. HARBISON:

Yes, Your Honor.

24

QUESTION;

Is this a revenue raising measure of

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

21

1

any consequence?
MR, HARBISON:

2

This is, Your Honor.

The record is

3

pretty much silent on that but to my knowledge the state fair

4

does not even receive a legislative appropriation from the State

5

of Minnesota.

QUESTION: Self-supporting?

6

MR. HARBISON:

7
8

-- sustaining, self-supporting enter­

prise .
QUESTION:

9
10

It's a self --

And how much is raised by these booth

rentals ?
MR. HARBISON:

Your Honor, I don't know and the

11

record doesn't indicate that.

I am sure the total gross

12

revenues -- and I don't know how it would be broken down, would
13

be well over a million dollars.
14

I'd like to emphasize one final point here and then
15

reserve some time for rebuttal, and that is that it seems to me
16

that the booth rule does not prohibit booth operators from
17

talking to fairgoers as they walk around, or trying to sell then
18

something or solicit donations.

Roving solicitors simply have

19

moving booths, that's all it is.

But the booth operator doesn't

20

have the advantage to follow, pursue, harass, however

you'd

21

like to characterize it, fairgoers who aren't interested.
22

And I

submit that's not enough of a justification.

23

The alternatives to the booth rule that are alleged
24

to be less restrictive are both unworkable and I suspect

25
North American Heportinij
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

22

1

constitutionally suspect because they would turn what is now a

2

a non-content-directed rule into a regulation that inherently

3

is going to require the state fair to look into the content and

4

the religious basis of the organizations.

5

that the state fair could do this by registering all organiza­

6

tions who are charitable or noncommercial, whomever they may be.
The problem with that is, how does the fair determine

7
8

9

10
11

They're suggesting

that?

That sounds to me like the kind of regulation this Court

struck down in Cantwell v. Connecticut.

I don't think the state

fair, even if they're qualified, would constitutionally be able
to do that.

The numerical limitations that have been suggested,

the requirement to wear identification badges, sound nice in
12

the abstract but in practice they wouldn't work; the state fair
13

would have no way to guarantee that they were being complied
14

with.

What we have here is not an attempt to suppress communi­

15

cation but an attempt by the state fair along this less re­
16

strictive continuum to draw the line.
17

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

If you wish to save any

18

rebuttal time, this is the time to do it.

21

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE, ESQ.,
22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
23

MR. TRIBE:
24

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

23

The state in this case seeks to expel from the open

1
2

and public areas of the state fair and to corral in these fixed

3

booths, which indeed, as Mr. Harbison points out, are sometimes

4

inside buildings, exercises of speech, press, and religion,

5

which clearly lie at the very core of the First Amendment.
Now, I think a number of the questions that have been

6
7
8

9

10
11

12

directed to Mr. Harbison expose in a way that perhaps the
record and the briefs alone would not have done quite so drama­
tically the sweep and breadth of this rule.

Mr. Justice White

asked, what about a politician walking around with information
on a sign?

And Mr. Harbison says, perhaps that would be allowed.

But it appears, in the stipulated facts, as one might expect,
since a rule against exhibiting or distributing literature can

13

hardly draw much of a line between what you wear on your back
14

and what you put in your palm and what you hand to someone, it
15

appears that that might not be allowed at all.
16

QUESTION:

Do we have to decide that issue here?

17

MR. TRIBE:

I think we needn't urge this Court to

18

reach that issue, but it does make clear how broad the rule is.
19

QUESTION:

When someone puts one of these boards on

20

back and front like advertising for a restaurant, then we'll
21

decide that case.
22

MR. TRIBE:

Well, the overbreadth position that we

23

take here, Mr, Chief Justice, we think is well founded in the
24

Schaumberg case itself.

That is, we are dealing here with

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

24

1

activity that is hardly at the periphery of the First Amendment.

2

We're dealing here with core

3

buting literature, and the fact that the law does reach that

4

far is- one of the reasons that this Court should strike it

5

down.
QUESTION:

6

First Amendment activity, distri­

But aren't there going to be a large number

7

of people, as suggested in Justice Todd's dissent, at A-73 of

8

the Joint Appendix, who are going to be able to make the same

9

claim as your clients, that they should be able to freely roam

10

11

12
13

and proselytize?

And he comments there that under the existing

rule fair officials cannot arbitrarily determine that some
exhibitors are free to roam the fair grounds while others are
not.
MR. TRIBE:

14

No, it's not arbitrary.

It's simply a

flat exclusion, and I think that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the
15

dissent below rightly pointed out that we were not claiming
16

any special treatment.

Others would potentially be eligible

17

to seek exemption.

But as this

Court last month said in

18

Thomas v. Indiana Review Board, simply conjuring up an unmanage­
19

able number of requests for exemptions without proof in the
20

record that it would indeed be unmanageable through some neutra?
21

feeling on numbers, is not a permissible basis for suppressing
22

protected

activity.

23

QUESTION:

But when you have it in the record, all

24

that list of people who have previously paid for booths?
25
North American Hepnrtinij
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

25

1

presumably all of them would do the same thing your clients

2

have done.
MR. TRIBE:

3

I'm afraid, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I can't

4

share that presumption.

5

the heat of a Minnesota State Fair hoping to attract attention

6

is not an obviously pleasant alternative to a nicely rented,

7

probably air-conditioned booth.

The business of wandering around in

QUESTION:

I thought that Minnesota was a cool state.

MR. TRIBE:

Well, I guess that the decision will not

turn on the temperature of Minnesota in the summer.
QUESTION:

gest

Mr. Tribe, did I understand you just to sug­

that you've abandoned the uniqueness, Sankirtan argument?

12

MR. TRIBE:

13

No, we certainly haven't abandoned the

argument that the claim is stronger here, nor did we argue be­
14

low, which is suggested by some notion of abandonment, that a
15

special exemption was warranted.

As Justice Todd pointed out

16

in

his dissent, on page 72 --

17

QUESTION:

Your position now is not that you're en­

18

titled to special consideration based on the Sankirtan argument,
19

is that right?
20

MR. TRIBE:

That's correct.

We think that that makes

21

the claim even more dramatic, but we believe that it would not
22

be principled to limit the exemption just to one religious group.
23

QUESTION:

While I have you interrupted, do you agree

24

with your colleague that this booth rule has nothing to do with

MR. TRIBE:

The language of the rule, we agree, pre­

3

dates their arrival, but it's interesting to note that the rule

4

on its face says nothing about solicitation.

5

interpreted to encompass solicitation now.

6

doesn't itself illuminate the question of why the rule has been

7

broadened to deal with solicitation.

8

9
10

11

It's simply been
And the record

In light of the problem

suggested, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, by your question, about the
degree to which one is genuinely free in the State Fair of
Minnesota under this rule, looked at on its face, to wander
around and proselytize orally.
We are assured by the Attorney General of Minnesota

12
13

that one could quite freely indicate verbally, as long as one
didn't have a sign on or hand out anything, that one repre­

14

sented a certain religion which was in need of funds, that
15

there was a booth back there, that contributions might be made
16

at the booth.

I am at a loss to know where the line is ever

17

going to be drawn between that and solicitation.
18

QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, I read recently, and I wouldn't

19

want to vouch for what I read in the newspaper, but it suggestec
20

that there were 153 religious organizations in the State of
21

California alone that would qualify under this category.

Now

22

assume that's very high.

Could we take judicial notice, do

23

you think, that there must be at least 100 religious organiza­
24

tions in the United States

that could avail themselves of what

25

North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

27

1

2

you are urging?
MR. TRIBE:

I am certain you could, Mr. Chief Justice.

3

And if you added political and charitable organizations, there

4

might be more still.

5

ral's representation and attempt to paint the chaos at its

6

worst, that perhaps there would be a thousand

7

and solicitors and distributors in an area where there are over

8

115,000 visitors a day, even if we assume at worst that one out

9

of 100 people is trying to persuade someone else to give money

10

11
12
13
14

But even if you take the Attorney Gene­

proselytizers

to a fledgling religion or to a rising candidacy, it seems to
me the proposition that that in itself is the sort of specter
the state can shut down protected speech and religious exercise
to avoid will be consistent with the judgments of this Court.
QUESTION:

That to me isn't a specter.

I mean, the

primary purpose of state fairs in their origin was pie contests
15

and corn contests and so forth.
16

MR. TRIBE:

So it isn't all that bad.

17

QUESTION:

What?

18

MR. TRIBE:

So it isn't all that bad if all this

19

should materialize, I suppose.
20

QUESTION:

Well, if you have all of these roving

21

groups around the pedestrian malls, they will come to take over
22

the state fair and the kind of agricultural aspect of the thing
23

will totally disappear.
24

MR. TRIBE:

But I'm curious why that hasn't happened

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

28

1

in state fair after state fair where the lower courts have

2

ruled at the behest of the Krishna Consciousness group that it

3

was unconstitutional to ban solicitation and distribution.
QUESTION:

4
5

What about the New York district court

ruling?
MR. TRIBE:

6

Well, it is true that the New York dis­

7

trict court ruling now pending in this Court seeking certiorari

8

before judgment has gone the other way, but in the majority of

9

cases, in the 1+th Circuit',1 in the 7th Circuit,'in the Northern

10

11
12
13
14

District of Texas, in a number of cases over the past four or
five years, I would say the trend has been to say that because
this is obviously a public forum, a literal marketplace of ideas,
and because the concerns about congestion and fraud can be more
narrowly met, that there has to be a relaxation of the rule
when it comes to a religious group.

15

QUESTION:

Well, is a fairground a "marketplace of

16

ideas" as much as a marketplace for wares?
17

MR. TRIBE:

Well, historically, the fairs of Europe

18

and Leipzig and in other places surely were primarily religious
19

activities.

They did become more secular but the history of

20
the Minnesota State Fair, not atypical in this country, shows
21

that it has been a literal crossroads of cultural, religious,
22

political, as well as commercial activity.

It was the favorite

23

stopping point of presidential candidates in the early 20th
24

century.

There's no suggestion here that it is a less

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

29

1

appropriate place for the exchange of ideas than streets and

2

parks where people usually go to get someplace or to enjoy

3

themselves.

4

in any sense than the other places that this Court has suggested

5

are public fora.

6
7
8

9

10
11

There is no suggestion that it is less appropriate

And in this kind of public forum to have a

total ban on even distribution of literature with no commercial
element, as Justice Stevens points out, with no problem of
littering, when there are other methods of dealing with fraud
and congestion,

seems to us to be grossly overbroad.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Tribe, would you think the fair

could say, well? there’s 15 0 * 00 0 a day, perhaps we could put up
with 500 wandering people who are soliciting and we'll put the

12

names in a hat and draw by lot as to who gets in that day?
13

MR. TRIBE:

I think that putting some reasonable

14

ceiling numerically, as the respondents in this case have said
15

they would be willing to live with, is perfectly constitutional.
16

The fact that something is a public forum -- a courtroom -- a
17

public forum in which people can come and listen, doesn't mean
18

that more people than can be accommodated for its purpose must
19

be permitted to be there.
20
QUESTION:

Well, would people be permitted to walk

21

around this courtroom or any courtroom?
22

MR. TRIBE:

It would be so incompatible with the func­

23

tion and decorum of this courtroom, for the people here to walk
24

around, in contrast with the state fair, that I'm sure the
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

30

1

answer's no.
QUESTION:

2
3

How about out in the halls, where we have

exhibits, and the museum downstairs?
MR. TRIBE:

4

I think the quiet and tranquillity and

5

the educational function of these halls is incompatible with

6

that kind of wandering, although I must admit I haven't careful­

7

ly enough thought about it to want to be held to that.

8

fair is at the other end of the spectrum, surely.
QUESTION:

9
10

11

Is not a state fair fundamentally an edu­

cational function and in a state like Minnesota, agriculture
and agricultural machinery, and a great many other things?
MR. TRIBE:

12
13

A state

But educational, not in the sense that a

library is, where people wander and carefully, quietly, calmly
select.

It's educational in the sense that the cross-fire of

14

ideas and options and opinions makes it a saturation place for
15

exposure.

It's for that very reason that respondents findit sue h

16

an attractive and important place to expose people to the possi­
17

bility that what the respondents believe in really merits their
18

attention.
19

QUESTION:

Well, the lower Great Hall here, to pursue

20

that, Is a museum of sorts and people look at the pictures of
21

the Justices of times gone by and read their biographies at­
22

tached, and look at a great many things relating to the Court's
23

history.

They are free to talk about it all they want as long

24

as they don't create a disturbance.

How would the peripatetic

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

missionary be any more or less a problem downstairs than at the

2

state fair?
MR. TRIBE:

3

Well, I suppose, Mr. Chief Justice, that

4

because people come to this Court for a much more specific

5

purpose and with a particular event or set of events in mind,

6
7
8

9

it would not be nearly so difficult to justify the proposition
that the purposes of the Court, like the purposes of a library
or of the White House or of some other special building, are
incompatible with quite the same kind of robust, wide open dis­
cussion and distribution and solicitation that clearly is com­

10

patible with the function of a fair.

But again this Court

11

needn't decide exactly how many institutions and fora are
2

brought within the principle.

There's no claim made by the

3

State of Minnesota in this case, and no proposition adduced by
4

the Supreme Court of Minnesota, to the effect that the purposes
5

of the fair are compromised by the very presence of these peo­
6

ple.

What is claimed, rather, is that if they engage in certain

7

kinds of excessive or abusive behavior, which incidentally has
8

not been found here -- there are simply some unverified com­
9

plaints and four signed complaints -- if they engage in that
20

kind of behavior, or if they blocked entranceways or get in the
21

22
23
24

way of certain queues and lines, that they then may pose an
administrative problem.
QUESTION:

VJell, if we felt bound by the Supreme Court

of Minnesota's decision, presumably we would not have granted

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

32

1

certiorari.

2

MR. TRIBE:

Well, that's -- certainly, Mr. Justice.

3

And the only kind of deference that I would suggest even re­

4

motely to that court's decision in this case is that its proxi­

5

mity to the situation and its sensitivity to the purposes that

6

the State of Minnesota seeks to advance are at least as likely

7

to be reflected in its judgment as this Court indicated was

8

true in Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County, not

9

long ago, when deference was to the Supreme Court of California

10

11
12
13

where that Court had upheld rather than struck down a law of
the state that seemed appropriate.

We simply suggest that if

the Supreme Court of Minnesota sees no difficulty with less
restrictive modes of achieving the state's goals and if the
Attorney General of Minnesota doesn't indicate that this state

14

fair is somehow more like the Supreme Court of the United States
15

than like the fairs of early America and of Europe, that there
16

is no reason for the Court to

view the case in other than the

17

context of a conventional public forum.
18

QUESTION:

Well, would this be different if it came

19

from the 8th Circuit rather than the Supreme Court of Minne­
20
sota?
21

MR. TRIBE:

I would not have one additional argument

22

that I think is one that strengthens the case.

I think the

23

result ought to be the same.

But I think in this case the fact

24

that the Supreme Court of Minnesota viewed the record as it did
25

33

is helpful.

2

might for this Court to speculate on the purposes of the rule

3

and the way in which it operates.

4

the rule --

It makes it less problematic than it otherwise

QUESTION:

5

Now, as to the way in which

Mr. Tribe, I think a minute ago you con­

6

ceded that a reasonable limitation on numbers would be consti­

7

tutional?
MR. TRIBE:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Yes.
Would you say the same thing about a rea­

sonable limitation on area?
MR. TRIBE:

11

Well, as long as the limitation on area

did not, was not designed to shunt the devotees into places
12
13

where in effect they could neither be seen nor heard, as long
as in effect they were prevented simply from blocking access,

14

then we do think that area limitations, as have been upheld
15

before, would.be okay.
16

QUESTION:

Well, what about -- what if they were ex­

17

cluded from other booths?
18

MR. TRIBE:

Excluded from other booths?

I suppose

19

interference with what's going on in other booths is something
20

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, just keep them out.

Say, if

21

they're permitted to solicit, or -- you cannot solicit in some­
22

body else's booth?
23

MR. TRIBE:

I think as long as all people are granted

MR. TRIBE:

I think that probably would be all right,

Mr. Justice White.
QUESTION:

5
6

Or in somebody else's -- or in the queues

Well, certainly, they can be heard and seer

in a booth that they have.
MR. TRIBE:

7

They can be heard and seen, but that's an

8

important, I think, additional point, and that is, we suggested

9

that the primary operation of the booth rule, since it's so

10

11
12
13
14
15

obviously overbroad and imprecise with respect to the goals of
fraud, safety, congestion, and the like, is to limit distribu­
tion and receipt of religious literature and solicitation and
the making of religious contributions,

to those people who

already know about, feel some sympathy toward, and are willing
to be publicly associated with the very kinds of groups that
are going to need most to engage in a kind of outreach program.

16

And the response of the Attorney General of Minnesota to the
17

suggestion that people might actually feel stigmatized at going
18

over

to and publicly indicating interest in the Hare Krishnas,

19

was interesting.

Their response is that it's preposterous to

20

suppose any such thing, page 15 of their brief; that alleged
21

fear, they say, does not seem to prevent fairgoers from going
22

to the carnival freak shows and similar attractions.

That is,

23

they are comparing those who assert fundamental First Amendment
24

rights to freak shows.
25
North American Reporting

35

1

QUESTION:

Isn't there another response to that argu­

2

ment, and that is that they do have the opportunity to try to

3

persuade orally the people to go over to the booth?

4

MR. TRIBE:

To some extent.

But if they persuade too

5

effectively, might they not be guilty of soliciting?

6

as this court thought in Thomas v. Collins, there may not be

7

any very bright line between saying the union is your only real

8

source of protection and saying, join the union.

9
10

11
12
13
14

QUESTION:

That is,

I thought it was clear -- maybe I missed

it, but I thought it was clear that it would be perfectly per­
missible to accost somebody in the common grounds of the fair
and say, we would like to sell you some literature which you
must purchase over at our booth.
MR. TRIBE:

You don't think that's clear?

Well, because -- I don't think it is

clear, Mr. Justice Stevens.

The reason I don't is that just as

15

this Court in Primus thought that a representation by the
16

Attorney General was not necessarily conclusive on the point
17

when the rule itself is vague, so, too, here, if someone were tc
18

walk around and say, devotion to Krishna Consciousness means
19

sacrifice of the material things to which you are enslaved,
20

and that's where you can give money, it would not at all sur­
21

prise me if that were to be regarded as solicitation.

But I

22

think there is a dilemma here.

Because if that is not a forbid­

23

den form of solicitation, then we fail to understand any con­
24

ceivable purpose that can be served by banning solicitation and
25

QUESTION:

That is, as the court below

Well, the purpose is you confine the ex­

change of money to booths.
MR. TRIBE:

It's not just the exchange of money.

That is, this Court has -- we're not dealing here with a sugges­
tion that although the solicitation may occur out in the fair­
ground, the final transaction must occur in the booth.

That was

the compromise suggested by the dissenting opinion, and that is
the solution that one other lower federal court proposed.

What

is proposed and defended here is not a rule that you can say
anything you want and hand out literature as long as the money

12

doesn't change except back at the booth.
13

QUESTION:

Well, no, they prohibit the handing out

14

literature -15

MR. TRIBE:

And even solicitation.

16

QUESTION:

But no physical transfer of any chattel one

17

way or the other except at the booth.
18

MR. TRIBE:

And also, but also solicitation.

That is,

19

they also forbid oral as well as written solicitation of con­
20

tributions in the fairgrounds.
21

QUESTION:

Do you agree that your adversary doesn't

22

read the rule that way?
23

MR. TRIBE:
24

I think he probably does but' we. will see.

That is, the difference between us is on

what constitutes

1

solicitation
QUESTION:

2

On page 35 and 36 of his brief he says,

"In fact, even under current state fair policy, Krishnas could

proselytize among and speak with fairgoers and then direct

5

interested donors or purchasers to their booth."
MR. TRIBE:

10

11
12
13

That's correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

But what I'd be curious to know is whether the Attorney General
of Minnesota can square with this record the proposition that
if the devotees of the Krishna Society were specifically to say
orally in the fairgrounds, please give us one dollar, whether
that would not clearly violate this rule?

We believe that

there's no doubt on this record that it would, and the line
drawing -QUESTION:

Even if they said, give it at the booth?

14

MR. TRIBE:

I think there's nothing in the record to

15

suggest that the place at which it is ultimately given deter­
16

mines whether the solicitation of contributions is protected or
17

unprotected.
18

QUESTION:

Well, what's in the record to show that it

19

is forbidden?
20

MR. TRIBE:

Well, that's the whole point of the dis­

21

agreement between the majority and the dissent.

MR. TRIBE:

But not soliciting for membership?

QUESTION:

MR. TRIBE:

9

So you can solicit for support?
Apparently.

Although the line between

soliciting for support and soliciting for contributions is too
vague.
QUESTION:

10

11

Soliciting for contributions, not member

ship.

6

8

The stipulated facts say that soliciting

So there's nothing in the argument, there's

nothing in the record any more than that.

To say that soli­

citing -- does the stipulation say it's permitted or forbidden?
12

MR. TRIBE:

13

which it is clear

It says it's forbidden.

Soliciting, by

is meant soliciting for contributions, is

14

forbidden in the fairgrounds outside a booth, and the entire
15

disagreement between the majority and the dissent below is whe­
16

ther that is too broad.

But even if one were to look at a much

17

narrower rule that says, it's okay to solicit contributions as
18

long as the ultimate donation is made at the booth.

Nothing has

19

been shown here to justify that.

There is speculation, surely

20

not meeting this Court's standard in Thomas v. Indiana Review
21

Board, that maybe there'd be some confusion if money were to
22

change hands in the middle of a fair.

Well, I find that pre­

23

posterous.

The idea that it would be confusing or a source of

24

congestion for people to hand money to one another in the

North American Reporting

QUESTION:

Do you think a state is forbidden from

enacting an ordinance that prohibits a devotee' of. a religion
from suddenly grabbing a pedestrian off the mall and saying,
listen, I want to talk to you about my religion for three or
four minutes.

You stay here and listen to me.

14

MR. TRIBE:

Yeah.

Grabbing?

Surely, the state can

15

forbid that.

And in this case there's nothing to suggest that

16

the right the respondents seek is the right to do anything
17

coercive or intrusive.

There is no denial in the record that

18

the religion in question teaches that that kind of coercive
19

behavior is immoral and impermissible.
20

QUESTION:

But there are also affidavits of some mis­

21

representation .

MR. TRIBE:

Well, there are four sworn affidavits

which have not been subjected to the process of cross-examina­

1

QUESTION:

2

were denied that opportunity?

3

Were you denied -- did you request and

MR. TRIBE:

No, we

think that the issue is one of the

4

facial validity of this rule, and we think it would be far more

5

pernicious to sacrifice the principle that the validity of the

6

rule cannot be sustained by a few episodes, even if true, of

7

misconduct, than to get involved in a sideshow of disputing

8

9
10

11

those particular episodes.

But I simply point out that it's not

as though we have here a finding by the courts below that the
organization is guilty of some kind of systematic misconduct.
It's not as though we have a record on the basis of which such
a finding could be made, and it's not as though we have a rule

12
13

that is narrowly targeted to any kind of misconduct.

This is

not a rule which specifically forbids particular kinds of
14

abusive behavior.

This is a rule which says, you can't solicit

15

in the fairgrounds at all.

You can't distribute or exhibit

16

literature in the fairgrounds at all.
17

QUESTION:

So is it your position that the rule, the

18

booth rule, is unconstitutional on its face?
19

MR. TRIBE:

On its face with respect to a certain

20

category of protected behavior, that is, we don't challenge it 21

QUESTION:

Well, isn't every prospective booth ren­

22

ter's behavior protected by the First Amendment?

Aren't we all,

23

in other words?
24

MR. TRIBE:

I suppose there would be some -- well,

41

1

we're all protected by the First Amendment.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. TRIBE:

Yes.
But the distinction this Court drew in

4

Village of Schaumberg v. Citizens for a Better Environment

5

between the category of activities as applied to which the

6

75 percent rule in that case was unconstitutional, and other

7

kinds of activities,

8

9

10
11
12
13

raising money for more conventional

charities unconnected with advocacy as to which it might not
be unconstitutional, is exactly the same kind of distinction as
the one we seek to draw here.

That is, just as this Court in

the pair of cases represented by Martin v. Struthers and Breard
v. Alexandria, suggested that it's permissible to forbid doorto-door distribution of purely commercial material but not per­
missible to do so with respect to religion and politics, so

14

that kind of a distinction, we think, is vital here.
15

QUESTION:

So this booth rule might, you think, be

16

constitutionally valid as it applied to purely commercial booth
17

renters?
18

MR. TRIBE:

We think it would be.

We certainly don't

19

challenge it.
20

QUESTION:

Well, what did the -- didn't the Minnesota

21

court strike it down on its face?

That's right.

They can't proceed --

Oh, yes.

12

MR. TRIBE:

It was not clear that one had to go back

to a legislative drawing board.

It might be clearer that a lower

14

court might be able to redraw it.
15

QUESTION:

So -- but you don't know what the Minnesota

16

court did?
17

MR. TRIBE:

We don't know what they would do.

As

18

matters now stood, they said that the rule -- in a footnote
19

they indicated the rule could constitutionally be applied to
20

commercial vendors of literature and of other materials.

QUESTION:

Did they say whether the ordinance was

23

Justice Todd, joined by two other members of that court,

said that although the majority might not have adverted to it,
because the respondents here made no claim for some special
treatment and because no principled line could be drawn between
religion and politics in this context, indeed, other groups
would be exempt.

15
16

QUESTION:

And you agree with that -- ?

QUESTION:

I'm not sure that the dissenting opinion

is the best guide as to what the majority meant.

MR. TRIBE:

QUESTION:

we think this Court needs to affirm.

To that extent, Mr. Justice Stewart.

I think it's right that we agree that no principled line could
be drawn and we don't urge this Court on what we think would be
a disingenuous basis to uphold what would be a very narrow de­
cision.

We think it really is broader, broader than that,

12

necessarily.
13

QUESTION:

No, we got into this because Justice White

14

asked you if the rule was invalid on its face or if the lower
15

court had so held, and I say, it clearly did not so hold.
16

MR. TRIBE:

It clearly did not so hold.

We think it

17

clearly is, however, invalid on its face.
18

QUESTION:

Would it give you more relief than you got

19

if it were stricken down on its face?
20

MR. TRIBE:

No, not -- I don't think it would give us

21

any more relief.

It might give more solace to a number of

22

other organizations that believe that the rule inhibits their

First Amendment rights and because we are making an overbroad

attack.

Overbreadth usually applies when it's not

As long as it's unconstitutional as to you?

6

unconstitutional as to you but it may be as to others, doesn't

7

it?

8
9

MR. TRIBE:

Well, I suppose the answer is that we are

arguing that whether or not all of the activity in which

10

respondents have engaged and seek to engage come within the

11

protected core, we are entitled to have the rule struck down in­

12
13
14
15
16
17
18

sofar as its enforcement against us with respect to the pro­
posed activities is contemplated.

In that sense, even though

clearly we are not among the many other organizations whose
rights we would seek to champion, and even though we are not,
as perhaps the Citizens for a Better Environment was in the
Schaumberg case, in the troublesome position of not even being
able to plausibly claim, or at least not being able convincingly
to show that we are likely to be in the core, we are not invok­

19

ing overbreadth out of necessity, but it's not a gratuitous
20

invocation because we do think it important to explain why all
21

of the allegations about possible misconduct are irrelevant.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT G. HARBISON, ESQ.,

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS -- REBUTTAL

3

MR. HARBISON:

4
5

I'd like to take up, may it please

the Court, on that very point.
Under Minnesota statutes, every law in Minnesota is

6

severable unless it's expressly provided not to be.

7

more, the comment that the Minnesota Supreme Court suggested

8

some lesser restrictive alternatives to the rule has to be taker

9

with the understanding that their decision was based upon the

10
11
12
13
14
15

Further­

assumption that they were dealing only with one organization,
not with potentially 30, 40, 50, 100, whatever it might be.
I suggest that in light of the fact that they found substantial
public purposes furthered by the rule, they would have concluded
very likely that in a different way, because their allegedly
less restrictive alternatives would not fit in the same context.
So the basis for those alternatives is no longer there.

16

Without the booth rule I'm suggesting that the entire
17

nature of the state fair would be changed drastically and
18

that's one of the factors this Court has typically looked at,
19

the nature of the forum here.

And I'd like to emphasize that

20

the event of the annual state fair is not on the same plane,
21

it's not the same as a public park or a public street corner.
22

QUESTION:

Mr. Harbison, can I ask you one question

23

about the meaning of the rule?

I thought I understood it before

24

but I'm not sure I do now.

In the stipulation, the rule is

25

quoted and it refers to "sale or distribution of any merchandise,

2

including printed or written material, except under license

issued for /_from/ the society and/or from a duly licensed loca­

4

5

for distribution that are roving licenses, in effect.

right?
