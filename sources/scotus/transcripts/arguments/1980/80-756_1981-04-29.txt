Mr. Jones, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE W. JONES, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MR. JONES:

8
9

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether Congress' use of

1 1

the term "available income" in the Medicaid statute was

12

intended to preclude the consideration of the income of an

13

institutionalized applicant's spouse for the purpose of making

14

Medicaid determinations.

15
16

17

18

20
21

Respondent filed suit in the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the regula­
tions of the Secretary of Health and Human Services on
statutory and constitutional grounds.

The regulations re­

quired all participating states to consider the income of
an applicant's spouse in limited circumstances, but also
permitted some states to consider the income of an applicant's
spouse more broadly.

The District Court held the regulations

invalid on statutory grounds , and therefore did not consider
the constitutional arguments.
On appeal, the D.C. Circuit affirmed on the ground
3

1

that the Secretary had failed to consider certain factors and

2

policy concerns that the Court thought relevant.

3

dissented.

One judge

Pursuant to the order of the District Court on

4

5

remand, the Secretary has now published new regulations based

6

on the analysis of the Court of Appeals.

7

to determine precisely what the Court of Appeals held, it

8
9

10

11

is nevertheless clear that the Court erred in invalidating
the Secretary's regulations.

Congress expressly authorized

the Secretary to define the term "available income" for pur­
poses of the Medicaid statute.
QUESTION:

12
13

While it is difficult

Could I ask, that new regulations have

been issued finally?
MR. JONES:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.
And If you win this case what happens

15

to them?
16

MR. J0sNES:

The regulations may be modified.

In the

17

preamble to the regulations the Secretary pointed out that
18

the regulations were based solely on the analysis of the
19

District, the D.C. Circuit, and -- which had, in effect,
20

rejected the Secretary's legal analysis -21

QUESTION:

Well did he

And denied.

Including here, I suppose?
No stay was asked for in this Court.
Will these new regulations be rescinded

if you prevail in this litigation?
MR. JONES:

The Secretary has indicated that de­

7

pending on the nature of this Court's disposition of this case,

8

the regulations would probably -- may have to be revised and

9

of course, rescinded first and then revised.

10

QUESTION:

You mean, if there's a reversal there

will have to be a revision?

12

MR. JONES:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. JONES:

Yes.
There wouldn't have to be, would there?
There wouldn't have to be, but since

15

the Secretary was in effect ordered to disregard his own

16

analysis of the statutory provisions, and instead, published

17

regulations based upon the analysis of the Court of Appeals,

18

if that -- if the analysis in the Court of Appeals is held

19

to be wrong, the Secretary would of course have to reconsider

20

the regulations.

not ?
MR. JONES.

No, the Secretary doesn't.

Well, did he make these new regulations

6

1

under the coercive impact of the Court of Appeals' decision?

2

MR. JONES:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.
So the odds are that he will re-examine

4

them at the very least, and see whether he wants to stay with

5

them if you prevail here?

6

MR. JONES:

7

QUESTION:

That's right.
And whether or not he does, he's assert­

8

ing the right to do so, that's what you're here for, why you're

9

here ?
MR. JONES:

10
11

Sure.

And that's the purpose of the

statement in the preamble to the regulations^.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. JONES:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. JONES:

And we can't rewrite them?
Excuse me?
And we can't rewrite them?
That's for sure.

Congress has expressly

16

authorized the Secretary to define the term "available income"

17

for purposes of the Medicaid statute.

18
19

20
21

And this Court's

decision in Batterton v. Francis makes it plain that an
agency's exercise of such express statutory authority may
only be set aside if it is inconsistent with the statute on
which it is based, arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise unlaw­
ful .
Disagreement with the judgment necessarily implicit
in such an exercise of authority is insufficient.

The Court

of Appeals first agreed with the Secretary that the Congress'
7

1

use of the term "available income" was not intended to preclude

2

consideration of the income of the applicant's spouse.

3

though there is nothing in the statute or the legislative

4

history that distinguishes between spouses who are living

5

together and those who are separated by institutionalization,

6

the Court of Appeals inferred from the legislative history,

7

a congressional intention to create such a distinction.
The basis for this inference was a statement in

8
9

Al­

the legislative history indicating that the states would

10

be precluded from assuming the availability of the income

1 1

of an absent father, or on the basis of a court support

12

order.

13

suggested a general intention to treat spouses living together

14

different from those who are separated by institutionalization.

15

The statement provides only the most tenuous support for

16

the Court's inference, and it is plainly insufficient to

17

support invalidation of the Secretary's regulations.

18

Court of Appeals acknowledged, Congress has stated that it

19

is the primary responsibility of the Secretary and not the

In the view of the Court of Appeals, this statement

As the

20

courts, to determine whether and to what extent the income of

21

the Medicaid applicant's spouse will be considered for the

22
23
24

25

purposes of determining Medicaid eligibility and the amount
of assistance.
Without substantially more support than that relied
on by the Court of Appeals in this case, the Secretary's
8

1

exercise of that responsibility should be upheld.

2

Secretary has consistently interpreted the term "available

3

income" to include the income of the applicant's spouse

4

whether they live together or not.

5

the legislative history of the statute support the Secretary's

6

interpretation of the statute.

7

The

Both the language and

In the provision of the Medicaid Act dealing ex­

8

clusively with state eligibility criteria, Congress provided

9

that only available income should be considered.

In this

10

same provision, Congress also stated that the states could

11

consider the financial responsibility of the applicant's

12

spouse for the purpose of making Medicaid determinations

13

and for the purpose of determining the amount of assistance

14

an applicant might be entitled to.

15

In the legislative history, Congress expressly

16

stated its view that spouses should be expected to support

17

each other.

18

living together and those who are separated by institutionali­

19

zation, or for some other reason, nor was the Secretary

20
21

Congress did not distinguish between spouses

required to do so.
Respondent contends that the states may only con­
sider the income of the applicant's spouse by filing an
independent lawsuit under generally applicable civil or
criminal support statutes.

This Court should reject that

interpretation of the statute for at least three reasons.
9

1

2

First, it is inconsistent with the language of the statute
which provides that the states may consider the income of an

3

applicant's spouse for the purpose of determining Medicaid

4

eligibility and for the purpose of determining the amount of

5

assistance an applicant may be entitled to.

6

initial step.

7

explained how filing an independent lawsuit under a generally

8

applicable civil or criminal statute can be said to be con­

9

sidering the income of the applicant's spouse for the purpose

10

This is an

Respondent has never attempted -- or, never

of making Medicaid determinations.

1 1

Second, this interpretation of the statute would

12

require the filing of thousands of tiny lawsuits, sometimes

13

perhaps several against the same individual, since the payments

14

are made by the state monthly or quarterly and the spouse --

15

and, at the same time the state would be continuing to pay

16

benefits to an individual who may or may not be eligible for

17

benefits.

18

And finally, if Congress intended to create such

19

a distinction or such an administrative scheme which would

20

have required the states to spend a great deal of money filing

21

all of these lawsuits, trying to recover money that they

22

shouldn't have had to pay out in the first place, one would

23

expect that something in the legislative history would have

24

been said about this.

25

There is absolutely no support in

the legislative history suggesting that Congress intended
10

1

2
3
4

5

for the states to consider the income of the applicant's
spouse for the purpose of determining Medicaid eligibility by
filing an independent lawsuit.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, while you are on the legis­

lative history -- although I understand you are directing your­

6

self now to this question of spouses, what about the House

7

Report that is quoted on page 42 of your opponent's brief,

8

which says that another provision that is included that

9

requires states to take into account "only such income and

10

resources as are actually available to the applicant."

1 1

then they also quote a comment by Senator Ribicoff that says

12

the bill will require only income and resources actually

13

available to the applicant to be considered in the -- does

14

that, what is your comment on those ---

15
16

MR. JONES:

Well, the

And

omission from the quotation

here is that the states were to take into account income

17

that was -- as determined in accordance with standards pre­

18

scribed by the Secretary, actually available to the applicant.

19

QUESTION:

But can the Secretary pass standards

20

that include the deemed income to be available when it is

21

not actually available?

22

MR. JONES:

Isn't that the issue?

Well, to put the question that way is

23

almost to assume the answer, because the available, for

24

purposes of the Medicaid statute, is determined by the

25

Secretary and income that the applicant's spouse actually
11

1

receives is actually available.

2

have always interpreted the term "available income" for

3

purposes of the Medicaid statute to include the income of

4

the applicant's spouse.

5

QUESTION;

The Secretary and Congress,

Would you -- is it your view that if

6

the statute included the words "actually available" we'd

7

still have the same case?

8
9

10

MR. JONES:

If the statute also said "actually

available" as determined in accordance with -QUESTION:

We've just inserted the word "actually"

1 1

in the statute, which is not there, but the word "actually"

12

is in the legislative history.

13

ence to your argument?

14

15
16

17

18
19

20

MR. JONES:

Would that make any differ­

I think not.

Respondent also contends

that the word "available" -QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, do you think that this

case is controlled by Batterton v. Francis?
MR. JONES:

Yes.

The language of the two provisions,

in Batterton v. Francis -- the Secretary was authorized to
prescribe standards for determining unemployment, for defining

21

the term "unemployment".

22

language, the Secretary is authorized to prescribe the

24

In this case, in almost identical

standards for determining what is "available income".
QUESTION:

Of course, the Court in that case was

closely divided.

MR. JONES:

But the majority opinion is controlling

4

if it is actually contributed in some sense.

5

The Respondent contends that the term "available

Congress however, used the term "available income"

6

and not contributed.

Furthermore, Congress expressly author­

7

ized the states to consider the income of the applicant's

8

spouse.

9

Stevens, it might be said that Congress clearly did not intend

In further answer to your question, Mr. Justice

10

the term "available" to be interpreted to exclude the income

1 1

of the applicant's spouse since there would have been no need

12

for the further provision that the states could consider

13

the income of the applicant's spouse that was prohibited in the

14

preceding section.

15

In addition to authorizing the states to consider

16

the income of the applicant's spouse, Congress delegated

17

responsibility to the Secretary for giving further content

18

to that term.

19

to exclude the income of the applicant's spouse simply because

20
21

22
23
24

25

The Secretary has never construed the term

the spouse refused to turn it over to the applicant; nothing
in the statute or the legislative history even suggests that
interpretation of the language and there's certainly nothing
that requires the Secretary to adopt that construction.
Absent compelling evidence that the Secretary has
grossly misconceived Congress' intent, this Court should
13

1

decline Respondent's invitation to disregard the interpretation

2

of the agency Congress has expressly authorized to define the

3

statutory term.

The last part of our brief is devoted to explaining

5

the analysis that led to the particular regulations in this

6

case.

7

plexity of that analysis.

8

to explain what the analysis was that led to the regulations.

9

And we recognized, as Respondents point out, the com­
And I would like to try briefly

Following the enactment of the Supplemental Security

10

Income program for the aged,

1 1

Secretary published regulations reflecting the impact of

12

this new legislation.

13

to consider the income of a Medicaid applicant's spouse to

14

the extent that it would be considered in determining SSI

15

eligibility.

17

spouse to the extent that they did so in 1972 even if it

18

would not be considered in determining SSI eligibility.

19

blind and disabled in 1972, the

All participating states were required

The states that exercised the 209(b) option

And thus, the Secretary's regulations established

20

a kind of maximum and minimum extent to which states may

21

consider the income of an applicant's spouse for purposes of

22

determining Medicaid.

23
24

25

The Secretary's regulations are based

on the very careful analysis of two exceedingly complex
social welfare statutes.

They are not based on the notion

that Congress' reasons for adopting the particular SSI
14

1

provisions are directly applicable in the Medicaid context,

2

nor did the Secretary assume that Congress intended in

3

some sense to prescribe rules for determining what income

4

is available for purposes of the Medicaid program.

5

as I said, the regulations are derived from an analysis of

6

the interlocking provisions of the Medicaid and SSI statutes.

7

These regulations cannot reasonably be characterized as

8

arbitrary or capricious.

9

Rather,

Section 1902(a)(10) of the Medicaid statute estab­

10

lishes the basic scope of the Medicaid program.

11

tant for present purposes, that provision establishes or

12

provides the key to understanding the analysis that led to

13

the regulations challenged here.

14

between the two statutes the Secretary requires the states

15

to consider the income to the extent that it would be con­

16

sidered in determining SSI eligibility.

17

purpose of the 209(b) option, the Secretary permits the

18

states to consider the income of an applicant's spouse to

19

the extent they did so in 1972.

20
21

23

Because of the relationship

Because of the

Under the first provision of Section 1902(a)(10),
all states, all participating states, are required to provide
Medicaid benefits to every aged, blind, disabled individual
receiving benefits under the SSI program.

Now putting to

one side for the moment the 209(b) option, it is clear that
the Secretary could not permit any state to consider the
15

1

income of an applicant's spouse if it would not be considered

2

in determining SSI eligibility.

3

were receiving SSI benefits could be found ineligible for

4

Medicaid contrary to the very clear command of Section

5

1902(a)(10)(A) that all SSI recipients be covered.

Otherwise, individuals who

Now, on the other hand, aged, blind or disabled

6
7

individuals

who

are ineligible for SSI benefits are

8

also ineligible for Medicaid, unless the state -- unless

9

they meet the requirements of one of the very carefully

10

circumscribed optional group provisions and the state has

1 1

decided to provide Medicaid benefits to that particular

12

group.

13

option, it follows that the Secretary cannot -- it follows

14

that the states must consider the income of all applicants

15

and their spouses to the extent that it would be considered

16

under the SSI statute.

17

is ineligible for SSI benefits he could be found eligible

18

for Medicaid, even if the state doesn't provide benefits to

19

any of the optional coverage groups; a result that is mani­

Now again putting aside for the moment the 209(b)

Otherwise, even if an individual

20

festly contrary to the terms of the statute.

21

obviously cannot redetermine the eligibility of every person

22
23
24

25

The Secretary

covered under every state plan.
There are certain optional coverage provisions and
it is unnecessary to describe them in detail here -- it

should

be emphasized however, that each of them is subject to its
16

1

own set of very carefully drawn limitations.

3
4

5

6
7

inequity of permitting the states to use one method for deter­
mining the, for calculating the income of the optional
coverage groups, and another method for calculating the
income of the mandatory coverage groups, the Secretary has
required the states to use the same method for calculating
the income of both.

8
9

Because of the

Neither the Court of Appeals nor Respondent
challenges that aspect of the Secretary's regulations.

Thus,

10

unless the 209(b) option requires a different kind of analysis,

1 1

the relationship between the Medicaid and SSI statutes not

12

only supports the reasonableness of the Secretary's regula­

13

tions but virtually compels those regulations.

14

The language, the legislative history and the

15

purpose of the 209(b) option all support the Secretary's

16

conclusion that the provision does not require a different

17

analysis.

18

states an option to deny Medicaid coverage to those individuals

19

By its terms, the provision simply gives the

the states would otherwise be required to cover.

As I pointed

20

out however, the only individuals the state is required to

21

cover are SSI recipients, under Section 1902(a)(10)(A).

22

The primary effect of the 209(b) option then is

23

simply to give the states a partial exemption from the other­

24

wise applicable requirements of that provision.

25

tive history makes virtually indisputable what seems apparent

17

The legisla­

1

2
3
4

5

6
7

from the terms of the provision.

In explaining the purpose

and intent of the provision, both the Senate Committee and
the House Committee pointed out that the provision was simply
intended to allow the states to exclude from mandatory
Medicaid coverage those individuals it would not have been
required to cover before the SSI program was adopted.
The states were to be permitted to exclude from

8

coverage those individuals who were newly eligible, that is,

9

those who became eligible for mandatory Medicaid coverage

10

because the scope of coverage under the SSI statute was

1 1

broader than that of the old Categorical Assistance Programs

12

that it replaced.

13

like SSI states are only entitled to federal financial

14

assistance for providing Medicaid benefits to an individual

15

who is ineligible for SSI if the state provides benefits

16

pursuant to one of the optional provisions.

17

With one arguable exception, 209(b) states

Thus, all states must consider the income of an

18

applicant's spouse at least to the extent that it would be

19

considered in determining SSI eligibility.

20

Secretary would be obliged to redetermine the eligibility of

21

every person covered under every state plan in order -- or

22

before he could determine whether the state was entitled to

23

federal financial assistance, an impossible administrative

24

burden and surely not one Congress intended to impose.

QUESTION:

Otherwise, the

Mr. Jones, could I ask you another

Am I correct in believing that the basic issue

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

But on this particular issue, on the

deeming issue?
MR. JONES:

The regulations have always permitted

the states to include or consider the income of an appli­
cant's spouse, whether they live together or not.
QUESTION:

And some states have done that since

the beginning evidently?
MR. JONES:

14

QUESTION:

That's right.
How do you explain the fact that this

issue wasn't litigated somewhere between 1965 and 1972?

MR. JONES:

They've gone through a series

No.

Well -Because it could have been, couldn't it?
It could have been.

There were

several, a number of District Court decisions which aren't

20

very carefully analyzed, but the -- the problem apparently,

21

was that when the Secretary published these new regulations

22
23
24

25

the provision was explicitly put in that the states would
be obliged to use the SSI standards, and that brought home
to everybody, I presume -QUESTION:

But as I understand it, some of the

states had, although hadn't been using SSI standards because

2

MR. JONES:

Right.

And in fact, the Secretary,

in the preamble to the regulations, indicates that in large

part, or most of the states, the SSI states, would be limited

in the extent that they would be considering the income of

7

that Congress has allowed the 209(b) states to use the 1972

I guess, is

And although all of the

10

states, all the 209(b) states I think have raised the level

1 1

somewhat since 1972, they are still lower in many cases than

12

the SSI standards.

13

that has generated the controversy surrounding the regulations

now.

And I think it's the inflation factor

As I pointed out, the purpose of the 209(b) option

15
16

was to permit the states to consider the income -- or to

17

exclude from Medicaid coverage, all of those individuals who

18

wouldn't have been eligible in 1972, and if the states were

19

validly considering the income of the applicant's spouses in

20

1972, the Secretary has no power to require them to ignore

21

that income today and provide Medicaid coverage even if the

22

individual is receiving SSI benefits.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

MR.

DEFORD:

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Before I begin,

I would like to clarify two points

which were raised in the questioning of Mr. Jones.

First,

I'd like to note that the preamble to the regulations which
were finally promulgated in December,

1980, pursuant to the

15

Court of Appeals decision, has

16

did not require that the Secretary only consider the policy

This appears on page 12(a) of the government's

21

petition for a writ of certiorari:

22

implementing the 209(b) option, the Secretary is required to

Congress intended would guide for discretion in determining

two factors, at least, which the Secretary should take into

account in promulgating new regulations.

regulations, as the preamble indicates, took into account

several other factors.

you read the Court of Appeals' opinion as rejecting your basic

theory; because they in effect held, as I understand it, that

12

deeming is permitted under certain circumstances.

13

MR. DEFORD:

What the Court of Appeals held was,

14

in certain circumstances deeming was not permitted and in

15

certain circumstances it was permitted, specifically where

16

the spouses were still living together, but in certain

17

circumstances especially where they were separated, and

especially where they were separated under certain conditions,

MR. DEFORD:

Your Honor, I simply wanted to clarify

what I consider a point which was made --

I know, but what's it's relevance?

QUESTION:

You don't suggest the case isn't a

live case?
MR. DEFORD:

No, I certainly don't, Your Honor.

10

One other point which was raised at the end of the other

1 1

discussion was the reason why this issue was not raised until

12

1974, I believe, was the first case.

13

major reason was not just inflation, but the inflationary cost

14

of nursing home care.

15

in the last six or seven years, it has cost the nursing homes

16

much more to take care of people and therefore, there's a

18

much more expenses for the government, both state and federal;

19

and therefore, there's been a greater need to attempt to deem

20

income from a non-institutionalized spouse.

21

QUESTION:

Is it not generally true that under

22

state law, take a hypothetical case, a man and wife are separ­

QUESTION:

Well, isn't it true also that under

the statute, 49 U.S.C. 1396a, Appendix H, in the petition
for certiorari, these numbers and letters are kind of diffi­
cult to cope with, but Section 17(B) in the middle of the
page of 35(a) says "a state plan for said medical assistance
must provide for taking into account only such income and
resources as are -- as determined in accordance with standards
prescribed by the Secretary, available to the applicant or
recipient in determining his eligibility for such aid, assis­
tance or recipience." Now, you have to show, don't you, that

that portion of the Secretary's regulations promulgated

2

pursuant to that congressional directive was either arbi­

3

trary, capricious, or contrary to law?

4

MR. DEFORD:

That's correct, Your Honor.

That

5

that -- that the regulations are inconsistent with that

6

statute, as is fleshed out by the legislative history.

7

I'd like to reiterate what the issue is of this

8

case, because I believe it was misstated by the government.

9

The issue here is whether Congress intended that an arbi­

10

trary portion of a non-institutionalized spouse's income

11

can be conclusively presumed available to the institutionalized

12

spouse who is applying for Medicaid without regard to whether

13

in fact that income is available.
Without the requirement that the income be actually

14

15

available, be in the hands of the institutionalized spouse,

16

before it is considered by the state, the spouses are placed

17

in an impossible dilemma.

institution and a sub-poverty standard of living for the

other.

Their choice is between the

spouses are placed in an impossible situation, may

lead one court or this Court to conclude that the regulation

is arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law.

did authorize the Secretary to define what shall be available.

4

MR. DEFORD:

But Congress

That's correct, Your Honor; that is

5

right in the statute, there's no dispute about that.

would also like to emphasize that Congress did not leave us

with the word "available" in the statute.

history which goes into considerably greater detail.

Are you referring to the use of the

term "actually available"?

12

MR. DEFORD:

13

QUESTION:

That's one instance, Your Honor.
But isn't that a term that could have

so readily been put into the statute that if Congress

15

intended that they would have said it?
MR. DEFORD:

16
17

QUESTION:
MR. DEFORD:

19

21

22

Well, because of other instances in

the legislative history.

For instance. Congress also says

that the income must be in fact available, that also appeared
in the legislative history.

conceded for purposes of argument that even if the word

10

and it wouldn't change his basic argument.

12

must be defined by the Secretary's regulations.

13

MR. DEFORD:

That even if it

I think the Department of Health and

Human Services itself, has in some senses recognized what

MR. DEFORD:

13

Well I think the Secretary has under­

stood that in this context, given the legislative history,

was the Secretary who repeatedly interpreted the word "avail­

obvious on the face of the statute.

18

20

21
22
23
24

25

MR. DEFORD:

Well I must say that the words "actually

available" in the statute and the regulations, when I first
read them, suggested to me that the Secretary was not, himself,
following his own regulations.

If "actually available" and

"income in hand" and "income under the control of", does not
mean income which the institutionalized spouse, him or herself
actually has.

I really do not know what it meant.

In fact, it's our position that HEW and HSS have

been inconsistent in dealing with this statute.

actually available.
MR. DEFORD:

1 1

12

I mean, it seems to me you

I can't think of an example off the

top of my head, Your Honor, but I suppose there would be
instances in which income might ultimately be considered
available to someone and should be considered available,
which that individual does not have.

Maybe the example is

as -- that Justice Marshall suggested, of money that ultimately
will be probated -- maybe in some circumstances that might be

17

considered available.

I don't think it should, but I think

18

there could be instances in which available might be stretched
19

somewhat.

I don't think this is one of those instances and

20

I think Congress made that clear in the legislative history.
21

I think we've been discussing this morning a rather
22

dry situation, but I think it's important to bring it into
23

some human terms.

In the record below we did introduce

24

affidavits indicating how deeming actually operates with

flesh and blood people.

You're talking about the amicus brief -I'm talking about -There's more than one?
Yes, Your Honor.
You're talking about the one filed by

John H. Ford, Lana Carter and others?
MR. DEFORD:

15
16

I'd like to briefly illustrate,

That's correct.

That's the one.

The wife was finally, after 8 or 9 months, unable to care for
her husband at home and was forced to put him into a nursing
home.

And it was at that point that the deeming regulations

took hold.

The wife's total income was only $241 per month

in Social Security disability benefits.

As the record in

20

that case reflected, this was just barely enough for her to
21

get by, at a subsistent standard of living.

The State of

22

North Carolina determined that she should be allowed to keep
23

only $162 per month and about 1/3 of her total income was
24

then

to be deemed available to the Individual in the institution

25

35

7

husband evicted from the nursing home, which is the ultimate

8

effect of that non-payment of the deemed amount.

9

The wife had the choice of paying the deemed

QUESTION:

Well, are you claiming as the result of

10

examples like that, that deeming is totally improper under,

1 1

the statute, or that a hearing has to be held in every case?

12

MR. DEFORD:

Claiming, Your Honor, that in order

13

for the state to demand a payment from the spouse outside of an

14

institution, if that spouse refuses to cooperate voluntarily,

15

that the state would have to use its relative responsibility

17

in Clause (d) of subsection 17, and go into Court, and at that

point a determination would be made as to what, a reasonable

contribution should be.

20

22

24

25

QUESTION:

Well, then what do you make of the

subsection (b) of 17, where it says "available" in accordance

example you give -- let me just be sure what your view is -your view is that under the statute the husband is entitled
to be Institutionalized, but the state could nevertheless
bring a lawsuit against the spouse and -MR.

Absolutely, Your Honor.

over $80 a month.

QUESTION:

It may end up in the -- economically in

21

the same harsh position, is what you’re saying?
22

MR. DEFORD:

I don't think the state would be able

23

to go into a state court of law and get a judge to order
24

a woman whose income is only $240 a month to pay a third of
25

37

1

that income to

the institution, if that's going to force

2

her to live in a sub-poverty standard of living.
3

that's the key point, that deeming is an arbitrary system --

4

QUESTION:

9

10

1 1

12

But is the deeming -- is it arbitrary

then because it imposes a greater financial burden on the
spouse than state law would impose, is that your argument?

7

8

I think

MR. DEFORD:

It's arbitrary in the sense that it

is administratively convenient to the state, as

Mr. Justice

Rehnquist has pointed out, but that administrative conven­
ience is far outweighed by the terrible burden it places on
both spouses.

And that was the burden that Congress sought

to avoid.

13

QUESTION:

Well,

I was under a misapprehension,

14

because I was under the impression that you were assuming

15

that the Secretary could not deny the medical benefit to one

16

spouse but would nevertheless have a remedy in state court to

17

collect the $80 a month.

18

there is --

MR. DEFORD:

But you're not, you're saying

I'm saying that in many instances, the

non-institutionalized spouse would have sufficient income -QUESTION:

21

Well,

let's take the hard cases, let's

22

take this very case.

Is it your view that the Secretary not

23

only must

24

recover the $80 from the other spouse in a subsequent pro­

25

ceeding?

accept the incapacitated spouse, but may not

38

1

MR. DEFORD:

I'm saying that the state could go

2

into court and might be able to get some money out of her.

3

But I doubt that a state court would order someone to pay

4

one-third of their income, in that instance.

5

deeming automatically allows the state to do that, without

6

going to any of the necessary expenses of the non-institu-

7

tionalized spouse might have.

8

judge would evaluate what the necessary expenses of that

9

person were, have them prove what they needed to get by, some

Whereas

I think in a state court the

10

sort of basic standard of existence.

1 1

the more common example would be someone who perhaps had

12

$400 a month income.

13

person would be forced to give up, in this state, $240 a month,

14

down to $160.

15
16

17

20
21

22
23
24

Now the state -- under deeming, that

I think the state court might order that

person to pay $50 or $60 or $80 or $100.

But I don't think the y

would force them into poverty as the price for obtaining
necessary health care for the other individual.
QUESTION:

18
19

But I don't -- I think

Well do you think the federal statute

places some limit on what a state court might do under your
theory as to allowing recovery by the state from one spouse or
another?
MR. DEFORD:

No, the federal statute simply gives

the state the right to use its responsibility laws for spouses.
It takes that right away for virtually every other relative
except parents, in Clause (d).

But the federal government

25

39

1

does not impose on the state how much it might ultimately

2

recover from that individual through the regular judicial

3

process.

4

Our argument here is that deeming is an entirely

5

arbitrary process, which precludes the individual from show­

6

ing, the non-institutionalized spouse from showing what his

7

or her necessary basic expenses are.

8

process would allow that individual to make a proof as to

9

what income that individual needs to get by.

MR. DEFORD:

that the word "available" in the statute must be interpreted

in at least this context, to mean only income which is actually

There is no longer any logical basis for deeming in

QUESTION:

Then you don't distinguish between

whether it is $500 a month or $5000 a month, that the spouse
has, apparently?
MR. DEFORD:

I don't distinguish, but I think in

the great majority of cases, and I'd like to emphasize this,
spouses do want to contribute to each other, they do not want
to leave the other hanging in the nursing home and say, good

I'd also say that a person

If the spouse with $5000 -- if that person simply

7

refuses to make the contribution, then the state has the

8

right to go into state court and obtain a necessary contri­

bution, and a reasonable contribution.

10

I'd like to point out also, that this Court in

11

similar cases involving the AFDC program has apparently shown

12

some disenchantment with exactly the procedure used here, and

13

in Van bare v. Hurley and Lewis v. Martin, this Court empha­

14

sized that states cannot include income available to an

15

applicant for AFDC which is not in fact available.

16

those cases, the Court stated that the bread can only be

In Van Lare, the Court noted that deeming in that
context, directed against a lodger living in the house, who
might not be contributing to the support of the applicant

essentially holding that child blackmail.
what deeming in this context amounts to.

And that

4

The state cannot say to the non-institutional’zed spouse, well,

5

you can either contribute the $150 a month, or ultimately

6

your spouse is going to be evicted from the nursing home.

7

The purpose of the Medicaid program was to guarantee that

8

individuals who needed necessary health care and did not

9

have sufficient income regardless of the reason why they

10
11

And that support payment, we submit, can

didn't have sufficient income, would obtain needed health
care.

In this instance, that health care is ultimately going

12

to be denied because the state is trying to force the other

13

spouse to cooperate.

14

is holding the institutionalized spouse, essentially a hostage,

15

in this game in an effort to obtain support from the non-

16

institutionalized spouse.
QUESTION:

17

It's trying to put -- is putting and

Mr. Deford, would you comment just

18

very briefly on the government's second argument which, as I

19

understand it, is that deeming is permitted under SSI and it's

20
21

22
23
24

25

not realistic to assume Congress intended the 209(b) option
to prohibit deeming if it is permitted in the more liberal
option.
MR. DEFORD:

Your Honor, I don't agree with the

government's interpretation of 209(b) option.

The 209(b)

option is not necessarily a more restrictive or a less liberal
43

1

program than the SSI procedure.

2

an effort to give the states the flexibility --

QUESTION:

209(b) option is essentially

Can I interrupt you just for one pre­

4

liminary? Do you agree that deeming

5

situation?

6

HR. DEFORD:

No.

is permitted in the SSI

I don't, I don't agree with that.

7

I think there's a stronger argument in that instance, because

8

of the relationship between the Medicaid statute and the SSI

9

statute.

But I think there's also a strong argument that sub­

10

section 17 of the Medicaid statute precludes deeming in

1 1

either kind of state.

12

But I'd like to say that the 209(b) options

13

essentially gives the states the right to choose whatever

14

Medicaid rules they want, with only one proviso -- that they

15

cannot be any more restrictive than those in effect in 1972.

16

It was an effort to give the states some flexibility; they

17

could choose to go with SSI, as about two-thirds of the

18

states have done.

19

tive convenience because the Social Security Administration

20

will then determine Medicaid eligibility for them and they

21

don't have to go through that process.

22
23
24

25

That gives the states much more administra­

If the states want to use more restrictive rules,
they can by choosing a 209(b) option.

They then have the

administrative burdens which comes with that.

At the same

time, however, they are required to use the spend-down
44

1

mechanism, which is probably the most liberal element that

2

Congress has included in the Medicaid statute.

3

allows individuals whose incomes might be slightly over the

4

cash assistance levels to spend-down and obtain eligibility

The 209(b) option was a choice that Congress gave

The statute does not say anything

15

about maximum eligibility levels.

16

17

It begins by saying that

Well it also says that an option

state can go back to the regime that it administered from

20

MR. DEFORD

21

QUESTION:

As long as it was. in effect in 1972.
Yes, in '72, so long as It was lawful.

But that, it need not give Medicaid to anybody who is not
eligible under SSI, that is, I think that's the government's
position.
MR. DEFORD

That is the government's position,
45

but

the statute does not say that.

QUESTION:

to what the statute provides.

And you disagree?

MR. DEFORD:

And you disagree as

The statute has no language about

using the SSI rules as the most liberal which a state can

use.

Any other questions?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Jones,

you have about three minutes left.

ORAL REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE W. JONES, ESQ.,

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. JONES:

1 1

The first point that I want to make

12

in my three minutes is that Respondent's emphasis, one, the

13

levels with the hypotheticals of Mrs. Ford or Mr. Ford, I

14

guess, is inappropriate in this case because the level of

15

benefits or the levels -- or the amount of the contribution

16

the state requires the spouse to make is not at issue in

17

this case.

18

regulations were invalid for failure to distinguish between

19

spouses living together and those who were separated by insti­

The Court of Appeals held that the Secretary's

20

tutionalization.

21

is not at issue here.

22
23
24

25

The level, the amount of the contribution
The Secretary's regulations did not

prescribe the amount of the contribution, and the Court of
Appeals didn't invalidate the regulations because of the
amount of the contribution asked.

Now, in response, my

own hypothetical might be useful.

Respondent's position is
46

1

that it doesn't matter how much money the spouse has, as long

2

as he refuses to contribute it.

3

$100,000 of income, Mr. Deford says most of these people don't

4

have $100,000 of income.

5

to the Chief Justice's question, it wouldn't make any differ­

6

ence if he did, as long as he refuses to contribute it, the

7

applicant is eligible for Medicaid and the state is obliged

8

to pay out benefits while, or in the interim, while it tries

9

to collect this money from the spouse who may or may not have

Now, if a spouse has

But as he pointed out, in response

10

money available for the state to attach, assuming of course,

1 1

that the state has such a statute under which it could pursue

12

the spouse.
We are informed that there are some states who

13
14

don't.

Now, it's conceivable that the states could adopt a

15

statute that would allow them to do this, but it's not clear

16

that all states do have those programs, those statutes.
The final point I'd like to make is that Respondent

17

18

has suggested that the 209(b) option doesn't do what we say

19

it does.

I'd like to just read briefly from the Senate

20

Report describing that option. "The 209(b) option

21

states the option of covering under Medicaid, aged, blind and

22
23
24

25

gives

disabled persons made newly eligible for cash assistance as
a result of the increases in

payment levels to these persons

provided under the bill, the SSI statute.

No state would be

required to furnish medical assistance to any individual
47

1

receiving aid as a needy aged, blind or disabled adult,
2
3
4

5

6
7

8

unless the state would be required or would have been required
under its 1972 plan." There's no other way to read that
language.

My time is up.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon at 11:06 o'clock a.m. the case in the
above matter was submitted.)
