MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. McCREE, JR., ESQ.,

4

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

5

MR. McCREE:

6
7

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the question whether the

8
9

Military Selective Service Act by providing for a male-only

10

registration and classification for possible induction into

11

the Armed Services violates the equal protection component

12

of the Fifth Amendment by invidiously discriminating against

13

males.
This is an appeal from the judgment of a three-judge

14
15

court determining that the male-only registration provision

16

of the Military Selective Service Act offends the Constitu­

17

tion and enjoining proceedings pursuant to that Act.
There is no substantial dispute about the facts

18
19

giving rise to this controversy.

20

Selective Service Act has provided for the registration of

21

males between the ages of 18 and 26 and their classification

22

and induction into the Armed Services.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Since 1948 the Military

Do all males In that age group have to

register?
MR. McCREE:

All male citizens and all male resident
3

1

aliens; only aliens not in non-immigrant'status.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. McCREE:

4

Stewart.

5

and deferments.

6

But all males including ministers and -All of them register, Mr. Justice

The classification system provides for exemptions

This condition continued until 1973 when the

7

Congress decided to experiment with an all-volunteer Army

8

and the conscription provision of the statute was removed.

9

However, the registration and classification provisions con­

10

tinued, as they do today, in effect.

But in 1975 the Presi­

11

dent decided to discontinue the classification of persons

12

under the Military Selective Service Act and this was the

13

condition until 1980 when the President of the United States

14

sent a message to the Congress indicating his desire because

15

of foreign policy and military exigencies to reactivate the

16

registration procedures and he also requested them to extend

17

the scope of the requirements for registration and classifi­

18

cation to include females.

19

The three-judge case which was --

20

QUESTION:

Might I ask, Mr. Solicitor General, is

21

the registration statute explicit as to the permissible uses

22

of the registration lists?

23

MR. McCREE:

It is not.

It doesn't forbid the list

24

for any purposes other than that the stated purposes, but

25

it states the purpose for which it would be used.
4

QUESTION:

1

Well, what I'm getting at, of course, is,

2

may the registration lists be used, for example, to staff

3

nonmilitary jobs?

4

MR. McCREE:

5

QUESTION:

It may —
What I'm thinking about is during the

6

war, do you recall, when not we, but our allies had all kinds

7

of registration lists which they then used to bring women intc

8

war industries.

MR. McCREE:

does not.

MR. McCREE:

15

it.

my understanding is that it

It does not.
It's for induction into the military

It's not a universal service act, as I understand

QUESTION:

16

If you're inquiring for service other

Except, I suppose, that people who are ir

17

certain classifications might be assigned outside the mili­

18

tary?

19

MR. McCREE:

That was certainly done under the Act

20

and I assume it was done lawfully.

21

within the service, and other service related to the national

22

welfare, I think, was the rubric that was used during World

23

War II, the Korean War, and the Southeast Asian hostilities.

24

25

Noncombatant service,

The President requested the Congress to shift funds
from the Department of Defense to the inactive Selective
5

1

Service machinery to reactivate it, to commence the registra­

2

tion of males and females, as he requested, under this message

3

that he sent.

4

The Congress considered the message and by joint

5

resolution transferred funds from the Department of the De­

6

fense to the Selective Service Agency to permit it to func­

7

tion, but denied the request to expand the Selective Service

8

requirement to have women register.

9

which had been commenced earlier in Philadelphia was then re­

10

activated and the Court determined that by reason of the non­

1 1

inclusion of women that there was an invidious discrimination

12

against males, that the statute was unconstitutional because

13

it offended the Fifth Amendment and it enjoined further

14

classification.

15

QUESTION:

The three-judge case

Mr. Solicitor General, you used the term,

16

"reactivated."

When that original action in the three-judge

17

District Court was brought in '71 -- was it?

18

statute we're now concerned with in the pleadings?

1971? -- was the

19

MR. McCREE:

20

1975 the President discontinued

21

statute, so the statute still authorized the President by

22

proclamation to reinstitute registration.

23
24

25

QUESTION:

The statute was still in effect but in
registration under the

So you have no problem about the action

being the proper vehicle for the Issues that are not here?
MR. McCREE:

We do not raise this in our
6

1

jurisdictional statement.

2

the matter is properly before the Court and we certainly

3

would rather have the Court adjudicate it now than to wait

4

until a genuine emergency with an injunction preventing the

5

President to act in the best interests of the country.
0UESTI0N:

6

We don't raise it now.

We believe

Well, General McCree, may I ask, is the

7

statute one that simply authorizes the President by proclama­

8

tion to require registration or that it directs him?
MR. McCREE:

9
10

It does -QUESTION:

1 1

12

It authorizes him by proclamation.

And then after this 1980 action in

Congress he did issue a proclamation?
MR. McCREE:

13

He did issue a proclamation requiring

14

young men who were born in 1960 and 1961 to register and then

15

on a continuing basis persons who were born after January 1,

16

1963, on or before the 30 days prior to their 18th birthday.

17

And that is continuing now under a stay granted by this Court

18

following our appeal from the determination of unconstitu­

19

tionality .

20
21

22
23

QUESTION:

General McCree, I might have missed it.

Have these pleadings been amended?
MR. McCREE:

Were they amended in the court below,

Mr. Justice?

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. McCREE:

Yes.
Yes.

The pleadings were and parties
7

1

were added because some of the original parties were beyond

2

the registration limit at that time, the 26 age.

3

were added so that there was an appropriate class of persons

4

who were subject to the requirement of registration.
QUESTION:

5

6

Persons

Is it now aimed at the new statute or

the old?

7

MR. McCREE:

It is aimed at the old statute because

8

the statute wasn't changed to require the registration of

9

women, and it's still a male-only registration statute.

10
1 1

12
13
14

QUESTION:

Then that's what's before us, is that

correct?
MR. McCREE:

That's what's before the Court at this

time, if the Court please.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General -- we began inter­

15

rupting you with our questions and I'm now continuing the

16

interruption -- you stated that the three-judge district court

17

held that this statute was constitutionally invalid because

18

it invidiously discriminated against men?

19

MR. McCREE:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. McCREE:

Against men.
That's clear, is it?
That's clear.

It was a determination

22

and in fact a challenge was not made that it invidiously

23

discriminated against women.

24

the court didn't pass on.

25

ty without due process of law, that it violated the

Other grounds were asserted that

They asserted that it took proper­

8

1

prohibition against involuntary servitude.

But those con­

2

tentions were found to be insufficient and only on the invid­

3

ious discrimination against males was the statute held

4

invalid.

y

The court below employed what this Court has

5

6

called in some of its decisions an intermediate level of

7

scrutiny that required that the draft registration be sub­

8

stantially related to an important governmental objective.

9

And the court below determined that the findings of the

10

Congress on the question of military need did not show an

11

important governmental objective or substantial relation

12

thereto, and made a very extended examination of what it

13

regarded the showing that the Government had made.

14

We contend essentially two things here.

First we

15

assert that because this case arises in the context of a

16

power expressly granted to the Congress by the Constitution,

17

Article I, Section 8, to raise an army, that the Court should

18

apply the rational relationship standard in determining this

19

validity.

20

is sui generis.

21

We submit that raising an army and conducting war

Mr. Solicitor General, would you take

22

that position if the classification was one that was racially

23

discriminatory, based on the authority to raise -- ?

24

25

MR. McCREE:

I think we would take that.

we might do that, but we would say -9

I think

2

If it was decided, it said, would have

registered only negroes and no whites?
MR. McCREE:

But we would say that that would not

be rationally related to an important governmental objective,

because -QUESTION:

MR. McCREE:

QUESTION:

MR. McCREE:

14

And you say that would not be legitimate
And we would say that would not be a

Then gender-based discrimination could

be supported as related to a legitimate governmental objec­

We say that it

10

No, not only gender base, but we just

say the gender base would satisfy it.

And you don't have to say that only

gender base?

We believe gender base is related to

Oh, I think I follow the Court's ques­

tion .
QUESTION:

1 1

We've always talked about something more

12

than the rational basis aspect.

13

MR. McCREE:

I would look at the Court's question

14

in this way.

Historically, and in the interpretations by

15

this Court, race is no longer an appropriate classification

16

for the disparate treatment of anybody in this country

17

anymore.

18

I believe categorically, that's it.

And

think,

MR. McCREE:

Because it's always irrational?
It's always irrational.
No matter what test you apply, it will

always fall.
MR. McCREE:

23
24

if

It wouldn't pass the first level of

scrutiny.
QUESTION:

Correct.
11

MR. McCREE:

1

But we think that this matter should

2

be determined in the first level of scrutiny, as I suggested,

3

because of the sui generis nature of raising an army to pre­

4

pare for war.

5

and of course, Article I, Section 8, specifically empowers

6

the Congress to raise armies, to wage war and make rules for

7

that in --

The Congress is full of references to this,

QUESTION:

I take it, in what you said earlier

about always irrationality in the case of racial discrimina­
tion, you're suggesting then Korematsu has been overruled?
MR. McCREE:

I would think this Court would decide

Korematsu differently today.
QUESTION:

Of course, Korematsu was decided at a

14

time when it had not been held that the Due

15

of the Fifth Amendment incorporated the standards of equal

16

protection.

17

I'm not mistaken.

That was first held in Bolling v. Sharpe, if
And Korematsu antedated that decision.

MR. McCREE:

Well, Korematsu certainly did.

Hirabayashi, was that the other --

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. McCREE:

That was the other one.
The other one, that was decided with i1.

22

And I would say that even viewing the equal protection com­

23

ponent of the Fifth Amendment as the Court would now, as

24

applying, it would decide Korematsu differently.

25

QUESTION:

Well, there's a certain truth to the
12

1

saying that civil liberties get their greatest protection

2

after the war is over, isn't there?
MR. McCREE:

3

I think that's -- I agree.

I can't

argue with that.

10

I certainly can't quarrel with that

But we think that the fact that the Congress

There are many other areas in the Constitution,

15

hold a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in World War

16

II, although there had not been a physical invasion of the

17

Hawaiian Islands; this court denied certiorari in this case.

18

But it's some evidence of what the Constitution intended the

19

relationship of the Court and the Congress and the Executive

20

Branch to be in this extraordinary circumstance of waging

21

war or preparing to wage war.

22

QUESTION:

The writ of habeas corpus, for example, can be

Well, is there anything in Article I,

Section 8, that limits the power of Congress

MR. McCREE:

to raise and

No, there is no limitation.
13

It's an

1

authorization just to raise and maintain armies and naval

2

forces.

3

it tells, as we respectfully submit, it tells the courts

4

that this is a matter where great deference should be paid

5

to congressional determination.

in this case that in the event of a mobilization what would

be necessary would be raising an effective army expedi­

clearly establishes is to have persons who could perform

vices .

And

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Solicitor General, there wasn't

14

any evidence, or was there -- was there any evidence before

15

the Congress that registration of women would negatively af­

16

fect the military capacity?

17

MR. McCREE:

Yes, if the Court pleases.

There is

18

evidence before the Court that although women can Derform and

19

have performed and still do perform effectively and with

20

great credit in noncombatant roles that they are not eligible

21

by statute and policy for certain roles in actual close combat

22

and that it is --

23

QUESTION:

Well, does that add up to evidence that

24

registration of women who surely are being used and could be

25

used in other capacities than combat, does that add up to
14

1

any evidence that the registration of women in and of itself

2

would negatively affect it.
MR. McCREE:

3

I think it does, because at this time,

4

at the time of mobilization, what would be necessary would

5

be persons who could be rotated among all of the military

6

roles that might be required, and although women could 'perform

7

and do 'perform and have performed efficiently in the noncom­

8

batant roles, they couldn't be rotated, and flexibility is

9

what is needed, initially, at the time of mobilization.

There

10

is evidence that through volunteer activity it is anticipated

1 1

that a sufficient number of women would be available in the

12

event of the mobilization that was projected by the Armed

13

Services witnesses who testified here -QUESTION:

14

General McCree, am I right in my assump­

15

tion that no one challenges the statutory provision that

16

women shall not be sent into combat?
MR. McCREE:

17
18
19

No one challenges it in this litiga­

tion .
QUESTION:

Supposing -- I suppose you could concede

20

that this was an unwise statute that Congress made the wrong

21

decision in'the circumstance but that doesn't make it uncon­

22

stitutional, is that -- ?

23

MR. McCREE:

I would certainly assert that.

I think

24

if we defer to the Congress it really means that we defer to

25

the right to be wrong.

If we just defer to them when we're
15

1

right, it's not much of --'it's not really deferring.
QUESTION:

2

Getting back to this other point about

3

combat, assuming that women are now on the training list for

4

astronauts, couldn't they drive an airplane?

MR. McCREE:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. McCREE:

Well, I don't think there's any -In combat?
I don't think

there's

any question about

that, but the Congress, by statute, has provided that women

are not eligible to perform certain functions and the Army

forth in the margin the committee action where this was con­

QUESTION:

Mr. McCree, Solicitor General, may I

22

call your attention to the fact that the conference report

23

explicitly approved the findings by the Senate Armed Services

24

Committee, on page 100 of the conference report on the Defense

25

Department Authorization Act.
17

MR. McCREE:

1

I appreciate that reference and I woulc

2

suggest, too, that Senate Report No. 96-826 on page 159 also

3

adopts the committee report and makes -QUESTION:

4

5

The conference report was adopted by

both houses?
MR. McCREE:

6

By both houses.

And it makes this

7

specific finding that there was no established military need

8

to include women in the Selective Service System.

9

don't contend, in further response to Mr. Justice Marshall,

Now, we

10

that women cannot perform a wide variety of roles, but the

1 1

military has made this determination and the Congress has

12

made this determination and it would be against the law to

13

employ them in certain kinds of military activity at this

14

time.
QUESTION:

15

Mr. Solicitor General, is it not true

16

that your entire argument assumes that that decision is a

17

constitutional decision, to keep women out of combat?

MR. McCREE:

Assumes -- you mean, assumes the

validity of the statute --

MR. McCREE: -- that excludes them from this, .purpose?

the Court should defer to the determination of the military

in a matter as vital as this at this time.

that they'll expand the Selective Service at another time

when it appears that it would be militarily sound to do this.

Do we judge this case on the basis that

registration means mobilization of women, or that it just

means registration?
MR. McCREE:

7

I just think the Court cannot divorce

8

from its consideration of registration the purpose for which

9

it's done.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. McCREE:

12

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but Mr. Solicitor General It is an arbitrary act to register -The same committee report, if I recall

13

it, of the Armed Services, in any event, also made a finding,

14

didn't it, that there were, grave shortages also exist for

15

Army surgeons and nurses?

16

to registrants, women registrants for jobs like that?
MR. McCREE:

17

And might not induction be limited

Yes, if the Court please.

But their

18

needs at this time for mobilization are for persons who would

19

afford them the maximum flexibility, who even, put in the

20

nursing situation, initially, could be used for combat, close

QUESTION:

22

And they anticipated --

How much of that was done in Vietnam?

What percentage of --

do you have any statistic of what the

percentage was of those who went to Vietnam ever actually saw

I can't testify about Vietnam.

You might have, say, 100 percent

And then you have to have the flexibility to move
For example,

10

those are roles forbidden today by statute and policy to

1 1

women, for women to perform, and the testimony here is that

12

the initial needs at mobilization would be for persons who

13

could be rotated into any situation where there may be a

14

military need and all we are arguing here is that the all­

15

male registration at this time be granted.

16

QUESTION:

Didn't the Director of Selective Service

17

testify here that if we had to mount an effort in Europe we'd

18

need 650,000 males and 80,000 women?

19

MR. McCREE:

20

QUESTION:

Those are the figures that I recall.
Well, wasn't that in support of the idea

21

that we ought to register women so that we can get that

22

80,000 even in a period of mobilization?

23
24
25

MR. McCREE:

He thought the 80,000 women would be

furnished by volunteer -QUESTION:

Didn't Admiral Hayward and General Wilsor
21

1

both testify to that effect?
MR. McCREE:

This was their experience in the light

of females volunteering for the service.
QUESTION: You said that initially military people

testified in favor of, Defense Department representatives

6

testified in favor of registering women.

7

their mind, or was that their consistent position?
MR. McCREE:

8
9

Did they change

The Congress decided against them.

They did not -- no, they did not change their mind.
QUESTION:

10

So from a military standpoint there

11

was not only no objection to registering women but they sup­

12

ported it?

13

MR. McCREE:

Except their testimony has to be under­

14

stood in the light of their further testimony that even if

15

we registered them that we would not induct them.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

I understand, but nevertheless, Congress

overruled them?
MR. McCREE:

And the Congress, to which the Consti­

19

tution gave the authority to raise an army, decided in the

20

light of the testimony that they would like to register

21

women but they would not induct them, decided not to provide

22

for the registration of women at this time.

23

QUESTION:

There's nothing unusual about the

24

Congress not agreeing with the Executive Branch on a particu­

25

lar issue, is there?
22

MR. McCREE:

2

Not in my experience, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Solicitor General, if we don't agree

with you that the rationality test is applicable here but

5

some heightened test like Craig v. Boren -- your time's

running out -- what have you to say to that if we disagree wit)h

7

you and say there has to be the heightened scrutiny test?
MR. McCREE:

v. Boren.

We believe that we satisfied Craig

We believe here that this is an important

10

governmental objective to raise an army and we believe that

1 1

registration is substantially related to it, and registration

12

of men is, in the light of --

13

QUESTION:

When you say "substantially related,"

14

is that because of some finding that women are not needed in

15

the military, or must there be some burden that the registra­

16

tion of women would affirmatively cause some kind of problem?

17

MR. McCREE:

Oh, I don't think there must be a

18

showing that women would cause some kind of problem.

19

we have to show --

20

QUESTION:

I think

Well, then, would you have to show that

21

under the heightened scrutiny would you at least have to show

22

that women are not needed in the military?

23

MR.

McCREE:

I don't even think we'd have to show

24

that women are not needed.

I think we'd have to show that to

25

adopt this policy would create a greater likelihood of
23

1

achieving the important objective, than the rational level

that

it would be somehow related to achieving that --

QUESTION:

3

Wouldn't an adequate answer to Justice

4

Brennan's question be that you need them in the military but

5

you don't need to register them?

MR. McCREE:

QUESTION:

I appreciate that suggestion -That was supported -- that was supported,

8

I repeat, by the testimony of Admiral Hayward and General

9

Wilson,

10

the

Commandant

of the Marine Corps that they could

get all they needed 6n volunteer service.
MR. McCREE:

11

Just one other thought, if I may have

12

just one moment.

13

to process women registrants at this time, since we're talk­

14

ing about 51 percent of the population, they'd need to allo­

15

cate twice as many resources just for the registration and

16

classification, and if they're not going to induct at this time -QUESTION:

17
18

The Congress may also have determined that

Isn't that just an argument of adminis­

trative convenience?

19

MR. McCREE:

I think it's more than that.

It's an

20

argument of talking about finite resources and how they

21

should be allocated.

22
23

I see my time has expired.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Weinberg.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD L. WEINBERG, ESQ.,

24

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

25

MR. WEINBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
24

I think there are four propositions, none of which

1

2

is seriously disputed in this case, which place into perspec­

3

tive just what is and what is not at issue in this case.

4

I think these are four points of reference of which we ought

5

not lose sight.

And

First, registering women for the draft does not

6
7

dictate any number of women who will be drafted nor the roles

8

which they would fill if they were drafted.

9

tration of women opens the possibility of drafting women to

Instead, regis­

10

fill the very positions in which they may now or in the

1 1

future serve as volunteers if there is not an adequate rate

12

of volunteers for those positions.
QUESTION:

13

May I interrupt you at this point and

14

ask, is it not possible that your next suit, if you win this

15

one, and if women were not drafted on an equal basis with

16

men, would not the same men who are complaining here today

17

bring suit on that basis?
MR. WEINBERG:

18

If not, why?
Well, I don't think that that would

19

be the case.

One of the issues that the District Court

20

specifically said was not before it and would in fact be

21

inconsistent with its rationale and the rationale

22

suit is --

23

QUESTION:

MR. WEINBERG:

Inconsistent in what way?
Inconsistent in that the theory of

Do you concede that?
MR. WEINBERG:

4

I would concede, indeed, I would

5

embrace the point that the military needs at the time that

6

mobilization is necessary ought to dictate the proportion in

7

which men or women are drafted.

It would not support a differential registration.
QUESTION:

17

But today?

MR. WEINBERG:

14

There may be at a given time.

But you would concede that a differen­

tial induction would be constitutionally permissible?

18

MR. WEINBERG:

19

QUESTION:

Yes; based upon military needs.

Mr. Weinberg, if you continue to prevail

20

In this case, does that mean that every past registration and

21

conscription act of this country is unconstitutional?
MR. WEINBERG:

22

I don't believe that that would be

23

the case.

Questions of constitutionality and retroactivity

24

would, I think, generally be resolved against the retroac­

25

tivity of the decision.

In a case like this I would note
27

1

that both the factual setting and the legal standard have

2

been developing over time and I don't see the kinds of clear

3

signposts to retroactivity

rendering a finding of unconstitutionality to be --

MR. WEINBERG:

QUESTION:

How

that are usually associated with

Pardon?
about

veterans' preference acts

dating from previous draft acts?
MR. WEINBERG:

I think that the Court decided that

in Feeney and noting in Feeney that the result of the

10

veterans' preference winds up disproportionately favoring

1 1

men was a function of the service, which, incidentally, was

12

a result of the inequality of conscription, among other things.

13

I don't think that that would require the voiding of any

14

veterans' preference statutes because the fact is still that

15

the people served and earned their veterans' preference as

16

opposed to being registered to serve.

17

we come to the question, we can no more say who would have

18

been drafted than we can say who will be drafted.

19

that, particularly that prospective uncertainty that we don't

20

know today what the military needs will be if and when we

21

ever have to draft, that is really the distinction between

22

registration on the one hand and conscription on the other.

23

QUESTION:

And I think that, agair,

And it's

Mr. Weinberg, up to now your arguments,

24

at least as I follow it, is that there were better ways to

do it than Congress did, there were more logical ways, but,

does that make it,

QUESTION:

Yet you don't challenge the statute that

prohibits the use of women in certain combat positions?
MR. WEINBERG:

With all due respect,

Mr. Justice

15

Rehnquist, we deny the existence of such a statute.

16

respect to the Army,

17

Navy, there is no statute barring women from combat, merely

18

from assignment to ships or airplanes with combat missions.

19

For example, in the Navy, women are eligible for assignment

20

to the Seals, which is the Navy version of the Green Beret

21

Special Forces.

With respect to the

Would a decision in your favor here have

any effect on Navy policies?

24

MR. WEINBERG:

25

QUESTION:

You mean the statute?

Right.
29

MR. WEINBERG:

1

It would not directly implicate that

2

statute.

I would point out that for now several years both

3

the Air Force and the Navy, which are the only two services

4

subject to such statutes, have been requesting the repeal of

5

such statutes on grounds having absolutely nothing to do

6

with registration or the draft, but merely having to do with

7

their own military management.

8

about is, I think, the Army situation where the Army now has

9

the right to decide assignment questions according to its own

So what we're really talking

10

lights, according to its own perceived needs, and I think

11

this is one of the things which distinguishes particularly

12

Admiral Hayward's testimony, because when he said, we will

13

be able to fill it, he was talking about the Navy and the

14

naval requirement for women is very small because the freedom

15

of assignment in the Navy is very small.

16

a very different case.

17

QUESTION:

In the Army it's

You don't challenge here the freedom of

18

assignment in the -- rather, the limitation of freedom of

19

assignment in the Navy or the Air Force?

MR. WEINBERG:

QUESTION:

22

MR. WEINBERG:

23
24
25

This case does not raise that.

And you don't challenge it?
No.

It's irrelevant to the decision

of this case.
QUESTION:

Well, we judge this case on the assump­

tion that that is valid.
30

MR. WEINBERG:

1

That is correct.

Indeed 4 the

2

one of the most important points that I would hope to make

3

is that the District Court assumed the continuing applica­

4

bility of all current limitations in all services on numbers

5

and assignments of women, and still found as a fact that

6

all-male registration did not enhance military flexibility

7

or the ability of the nation to respond to the full range

8

of possible futures which might confront us.

9

ly, in fact, it found that the exclusion of women from regis­

10

tration undermined military flexibility and that is a finding

1 1

of fact which has not been attacked

12

erroneous.

QUESTION:

Mr. Weinberg, the District Court's

15

analysis, of course, was in the context of the heightened

16

scrutiny test, the Craig v. Boren test, wasn't it?

17

MR. WEINBERG:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Suppose we don't agree that was correct,

19

what have you to say to the Government's argument that in

20

any event what ought to be applied here is the rational-

21

basis test, and by any measure that that test is satisfied?

22

MR. WEINBERG:

Well, the finding of fact that

23

military flexibility is in fact undermined by exclusion does

24

not depend upon what test is used in the analysis.

25

a finding of fact that is based directly on the testimony of

an adequate armed force.

12

pose.

13

a heightened scrutiny basis, the substantial and close rela­

14

tionship to that interest, and in fact the finding of facts

15

here as supported by the overwhelming record is that the

16

exclusion of women from registration, which means excluding

17

them from the pool of people to whom we can turn in time of

18

war, in time of emergency, for the skills that we know they dc

19

possess and the very skills that we have sought to bring into

20

the Armed Forces by increasing the female volunteer rate

21

and the level of volunteer soldiers, we would exclude our­

22

selves from being able to turn to those and the District Court

23

found, and I submit, correctly, certainly not clearly errone­

24

ously, that that objective is undermined by excluding women

25

from the registration pool.

That is indeed the statutory pur­

What it would go to is the rational relationship, or or

32

QUESTION:

1

Wouldn't that

objective be equally

2

undermined by excluding everybody under 18 and everybody

over 26?

That includes an awful lot of people

with a lot of different and varied experiences.

Yes, it does.

pose.
MR. WEINBERG:

1 1

And under certain circumstances,

12

eligibility for induction continues well past the age of 26.

13

The important thing is, here we focus on registration.
QUESTION:

14

You did not attack the constitutional

15

validity of the statute based upon its discrimination in

16

favor of everybody in this country under 18 years of age and

17

everybody in this country over 26 years of age?
MR. WEINBERG:

18

No, Your Honor, for two reasons I

don't think an age discrimination case would have been appro­

number of reasons consistent with the statute, particularly the

maintenance of a strong economy and to minimize as equitable , fair,

exposure and -- here again, we're talking of exposure

first, the age discrimination standard is clearly

QUESTION:

We're only talking about registration.

3

MR. WEINBERG:

4

QUESTION:

And that's what I'm saying, that --

Because

from

what

you

suggest, you

might as well register everybody over 26 and get a much

larger pool to draw from.

reach of the statute.

13

QUESTION:

That's not necessarily true at all.

14

When you're mustered out you're generally given the option

15

whether to remain in the reserve or not, and I at least, speak mg

just getting out.

18

QUESTION:

How do you distinguish the policy ques­

19

tion involved in fixing the ages and the policy question

20

made at this stage for limited purposes of excluding women?

21

Aren't they equally policy decisions by Congress, whether

22

wise or unwise?

23

MR. WEINBERG:

Well, to start with, the policy

24

decision to exclude women which was made in 1948 was not a

25

considered decision at all.

There was a good deal of
34

1

testimony as to what a suitable age for exposure to service

2

would be.

3

excluding women using traditional statutory interpretation

4

methods, the contemporaneous statutory history before the

12

MR. WEINBERG:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WEINBERG:

Yes, I believe you can.

How?
Particularly, because the defense

15

for the statute even under the rational relationship test

16

is the military flexibility argument that the Solicitor

17

General has described and because that argument simply does

18

not relate in any rational way to either the facts or the

19

intent of the statute, the function of the statute.

Yes, but if it's just a rational rela­

you could get as many women as you wanted, or that were

23

needed, on a voluntary basis, it would be quite rational to

24

decide not to go through the entire rigamarole of registra­

25

tion and the drafting of women just to get the ones you could
36

get without any expense whatsoever.
MR. WEINBERG:

Well, in fact, there is no substan­

3

tial basis in the record for believing that we can with con­

4

fidence predict that we will be --

Well, is there any basis for our believ­

MR. WEINBERG:

The record before the trial court

QUESTION:

We have history, to

There was great overlap

MR. WEINBERG:

What then, under the

If it could be stated that we can

safely predict that there would not arise a situation where

volunteers would be inadequate, that would be a different

Yes, if we had a guarantee, yes,

it really would not be needed; the answer is yes.

And that

goes, I think, to the very distinction between registration,

which is insurance against failing to have volunteers

which do confront us, and conscription, which is the decision

when one of those futures becomes our present, to say, these

We either have or don't have enough

Well, Mr. Weinberg, finally, why isn't

1 1

the rationality test, in light of the clauses of the Constitu­

12

tion we're dealing with, the proper test here?
MR. WEINBERG:

13

First of all, this Court, although

14

often asked to, has never accepted a military relationship

15

or national defense exception to normal standards of consti­

16

tutional scrutiny.

QUESTION:

What about

Schlesinger v. Ballard?

18

QUESTION:

And Parker v. Levy?

19

MR. WEINBERG:

Parker, like Glines and Huff, and

20

Greer v. Spock, are so-called military enclave, cases, and

21

they all go off on Parker v. Levy's language about the mili­

22

Not a Court opinion, so it's difficult

to say what it was based on.

MR. WEINBERG:

The fifth vote was based on -- I

believe, Your Honor, that the fifth vote was based upon an

application of a test that went far beyond rational basis.

MR. WEINBERG:

Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. WEINBERG:

I would go one step further, as this

Court has repeatedly said, when a legislature, including

6

Congress, enacts a statute based upon gender and the distinc­

7

tion of gender is on the face of the statute, it is based upor.

8

gender, it is the burden of those defending the statute to

9

come forth and establish by empirical evidence, in fact --

10

QUESTION:

Well, perhaps -- maybe the Court has

11

said that, but I trust I never have because I don't think

12

they're defending a statute, I think you're attacking it.

13
14

15

MR. WEINBERG:

But, Your Honor, once the attack

shows that it was gender-based discrimination, this Court -QUESTION:

But doesn't the burden shift as soon as

16

the Government does -- and you've conceded they've done here -

17

show there's a difference in military need based on sex?

18

You conceded that's permissible.

19

MR. WEINBERG:

Your Honor, that would affect regis­

20

tration only if two different statutes were involved, one, a

21

statutory prohibition on women participating in certain close

22

combat activities, and the other, more importantly, a change

23

in the Military Selective Service Act limiting the induction

24

of people to people who will be assigned to those prohibited

25

roles, because otherwise we are conflicting with history and
44

1

Congress did not mean to conflict with history because we

2

have always, as the testimony of General Tice and all the

3

generals is clear, we have always drafted a very substantial,

4

indeed, often a majority of draftees specifically for the

5

noncombat areas.

6

ibility was specifically refuted by General Abrams

7

generals in the testimony because we are saying that there is

a certain number of women that the military wants to have,

welcomes, thinks is the optimal number for the defense of the

You cannot at the one point say that that is the

military opinion and at the same time say that if those

slots are filled with draftees rather than volunteers, we

undermine flexibility.

General Eisenhower's statement to the Congress in 1948 was,

19
