ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. MARIA PARISI VICKERS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

Ms. Vickers, you may pro­

MS. VICKERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
This case arises in the context of the Uniform Extra­
dition Act and the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, both in­

10

terstate compacts which have been adopted by the overwhelming

11

majority of the states.

12

The issue before the Court involves the interrela­

13

tionship of these two important compacts as they affect the

14

interstate transfer of a prisoner who has a detainer lodged

15

against him and who is sought for trial on criminal charges in

16

another state.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Ms. Vickers, isn't there some question as

to whether this is actually a compact or not?
MS. VICKERS:
QUESTION:

The detainer agreement, Your Honor?

Yes.

In view of the language in the

20

Multistate Tax Commission case saying that unless the agreement
21

between the states Is one which would alter the balance of power
22

within the Union, it may not be a compact.
23

MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, I believe that this is a

24

compact, rather an agreement entered into by party states.
25
3

1

QUESTION:
2
3
4

states necessarily a compact?

In the Multistate Tax Commission

case, there was certainly an agreement entered into by a number
of states, and I believe it was held it was not a compact.

5
6

But is any agreement entered into by party

MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, I must say that I have not

focused on that issue and I apologize.

7

QUESTION:

If it isn't, I suppose it would follow

8

that there is some considerable question about whether or not

9

there is a federal question here.

10

MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, the 3rd Circuit relying on

11

this Court's decisions found that there was a question of

12

federal law and that it is a --

3
4

QUESTION:
Circuit did so.

I know.

The case is now here.

MS. VICKERS:

5

The Court of Appeals of the 3rd

And it is a compact.

They found it to

6

be a compact.

7

ever passed on this specific issue as far as the Agreement is

8

concerned.
QUESTION:

9
20
21
22
23

Certainly a uniform state act, even though

the same act has been enacted by the legislatures of 50 states,
is not a federal question.

That's still a question of state

law, even though the law is identical in each of the 50 states,
isn't it?
MS. VICKERS:

24
25

Your Honor, I don't believe that this Court has

state law.

Your Honor, it might be a question of

However, a federal interpretation would govern
4

1
because it is a compact.

2
QUESTION:

Even though — let's assume that there's

3
an identical federal law.

If you apply it within a state, it's

4
still a matter of state law, isn't it?
5
MS. VICKERS:
6
7

8
9

I would agree that simply because the

United States has adopted the agreement doesn't automatically
make it a federal law.

However, if the agreement is one which hE s

been sanctioned by Congress -- and here I believe the sanction by
Congress was given prior to the enactment of this agreement --

10

then I believe that federal interpretation would be binding on

11

the states.

12

QUESTION:

13

MS.

14

QUESTION:

15

MS.

16
17

The Court of Appeals certainly held that.

VICKERS:

Yes, Your Honor.

So you have support for your position.

VICKERS:

I do not differ with that position,

Your Honor.
Your Honor, the factual and procedural posture of the

18

case is briefly summarized.

19

a Pennsylvania prison who was wanted for trial on criminal

20

charges in the State of New Jersey.

21

suant to the interstate agreement on detainers, and he alleges

22

that this transfer under the Agreement rather than under the

23

Uniform Extradition Act violated his constitutionally protected

24
25

rights in two ways.

Respondent is a inmate confined in

He was being sought pur­

One, the failure to advise him of his

right to petition the Governor of the sending state to review

5

1

the custody request, and secondly, the absence of a pretransfer
2

hearing violated his right to due process.

And secondly, the

3

fact that the state did not provide him with a pretransfer hear­
4

ing as in the case of a transfer under the Extradition Act
5

6
7
8
9

deprived him of the equal protection of the laws.
The district court dismissed the complaint for fail­
ure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.

An

appeal was taken to the 3rd Circuit and that court held as a
matter of statutory construction, never reaching the federal

10

issues, that Article IV(d) of the Agreement preserves a prison­

11

er's existing procedural rights under the Extradition Act,

12

Section 10 more specifically.

13

QUESTION:

14

Which was exactly contrary to the inter­

pretation of the Pennsylvania state court, wasn't it?

15

MS. VICKERS:

That's right, Your Honor.

16

Your Honor, in reaching their decision the appellate

17

court relied on the language of Article IV(d) which states that

18

the Agreement does not deprive a prisoner of any right which he

19

may have to contest the legality of his delivery, as provided

20

in paragraph (a) hereof.

21
22
23
24
25

suggests that any right

However, nothing in the Agreement
includes Extradition Act procedures,

and it is our position that the language which I have just
quoted refers only to the right to petition the Governor to
disapprove the request of the prosecutor for temporary custody.
Similarly, the Court of Appeals relied on the
6

I

1

commentary by the Council of State Governments to Article IV(d).
2
3
4
5
6
7

And here again they relied on language concerning extradition.
But here extradition was not defined in terms of the Extradi­
tion Act.

Therefore they relied on a commentary which was in

itself ambiguous and unenlightening.

They also pointed to lan­

guage in Article 111(e) to the effect that a prisoner who him­
self requests final disposition on outstanding charges waives

8

extradition.

9

and there was no necessity for the framers of the Agreement to

Again, Article III does not define extradition,

10

define extradition here since extradition was being waived.

11

So reference to Article 111(e) language is also unenlightening.

12

Your Honor, this Court has defined extradition in its

13

cases, and the Extradition Clause of the U. S. Constitution and

14

its implementing legislation do not define extradition in terms

15

of a pretransfer hearing.

16

unreasonable to assume that every time the word extradition is

17

used a pretransfer hearing is implied.

18

Clause nor the federal implementing legislation nor the defini­

19

tion of this Court of the term "extradition" would imply a pre­

20
21
22
23
24

So it would seem to us that it is

Neither the Extradition

transfer hearing.
Your Honor, we would submit that the Court of Appeals'
interpretation of Article IV(d) is not only against the clear
and literal reading of the statute itself but it goes against
the purpose of the Agreement.

And Article I, the last sentence

of Article I, states that it is the purpose of the Agreement to
25
/

1

provide cooperative procedures.

The Article had been talking

2

of the need to have cooperative procedures when there is an
3

interstate transfer of prisoners and the framers clearly said,
4

"It is the purpose of the Agreement to provide such cooperative
5

procedures."

This language indicates that the framers intended

6

to provide specific mechanism for these transfers; it was an
7

affirmative statement that they were to provide certain proce­
8

dures to accomplish what was to be the expeditious and orderly

9

disposition of outstanding charges.
10

11
12

If the framers had not intended to set out a complete
self-contained system, a complete procedure within the four
corners of the Agreement, I think that they would have so speci­

3

fied.

4

would not have stated in Article I that it is the purpose of

5

the Agreement to provide the procedures.

They would have set out a particular procedure and they

6

So I believe that the interpretation of the Court of

7

Appeals for the 3rd Circuit goes against the clear intent set

8

out in Article I of the Agreement.
QUESTION:

9

Ms. Vickers, could you help me with one

20

question?

21

Detainers, how does the prisoner know that he has a right to

22

file a motion with the Governor within that 30-day period asking

23

that he not be transferred?

24
25

Under your view of the Interstate Agreement on

MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, the statute itself does not

provide that he be advised.

However, the forms which have been
8

1

adopted by all of the states for the promulgation of the proce­
2
dures within the Agreement advises the prisoner when a detainer
3

is lodged against him that he has several options.

A detainer

4

has been lodged against him and he may under Article III proceed
5

to seek final resolution of the detainer, or under Article IV
6

-- and they give the procedures to be followed.

7
8

QUESTION:
form?

9
10

MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, the record does not show

either way.

11
12

Was this particular respondent given that

QUESTION:

Because he alleges he did not know about

his right to filing.

13

MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, he alleges, he discussed

14

only the time frame from when the custody request was received

15

by the state.

16

the detainer was first filed.

17

that the record is unclear as to whether he received notice of

18

the filing of the detainer or Form 1.

There is no discussion as to the detainer, when

QUESTION:

19

And I would submit, therefore,

Whose burden would it be to show that he

20

received a piece of paper that would tell him what his rights

21

were ?

22
23
24
25

MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, I think that the way the

record stands at this point it's incomplete on that issue.
QUESTION:

But then don't we have to accept his claim

that he didn't know about this right as probably a valid claim?
9

1

MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, normally I would agree with

2

you but in this particular case I think that there is a lack of
3

information on that point.

He speaks only of when the custody

4

request was lodged.

He does not speak of any prior period of

5

time.
6

notice of a detainer.

7
8
9
10

11

He does not say specifically that he did not receive

QUESTION:

The complaint doesn't say that.
Well, but even if he had notice of the

detainer, it wouldn't necessarily mean that he had notice of
his right to make a request with the Governor within that 30-day
period.
MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, as I was stating, when the

12

prisoner receives notice of the detainer, he receives it through

13

a form, Form 1.

14

QUESTION:

How do we know that?

Not that I don't

15

have confidence in what you're telling me.

16

the record that explains that procedure to us?

Is there anything in

17

MS. VICKERS:

18

Your Honor, to continue on the issue of the interpre­

19

tation of the Article IV(d) by the 3rd Circuit, it appears that

20

the 3rd Circuit interpretation would have us assume that every

21

22
23
24
25

No, Your Honor.

state which adopts the Interstate Agreement on Detainers has a
Uniform Extradition Act.

And this is just not so.

still states which do not have that Act.

There are

Therefore, it would be

incongruous for a court to conclude that a prisoner has rights
derivative from a statute which may not exist in a particular
10

1

state.

On the other hand, the Court of Appeals decision may be

2
construed as to mean that whatever statute on extradition exists
3

in that state should be applied.
4

Well, Your Honors, if it please the Court, I would
5

submit that that is an equally irrational result, because the
6
7
8
9
10

11

Uniform Agreement on Detainers is supposed to be a uniform
statute with uniform procedures throughout the country.

This

is the intent of the framers, this is what is going to facili­
tate transfers.

And to have the result that the procedures are

going to differ depending on the particular extradition statute
in each state is simply absurd.

It defeats both the character

12

of the statute in its uniformity, and it defeats the purpose of

13

the Agreement itself.

14

QUESTION:

Yet, in the Uniform Commercial Code, in

15

its early days, which was also adopted by a large majority of

16

the states, the highest courts of various states interpreted

17

various provisions differently.

18

I think, by recommendations of the Uniform Conference on,

19

Commissioners of Uniform State Laws.

20

treated as federal questions.

21

MS. VICKERS:

Which were generally corrected,

But those were never

Well, Your Honor, I think that the

22

uniformity of the procedure here is strongly supported by the

23

purpose enunciated in Article I of the Agreement, which is to

24
25

provide the procedures to be followed.
QUESTION:

All uniform laws are supposed to be
11

1

interpreted uniformly but lots of state courts just have come tc
2
3

different conclusions on rather difficult questions of statu­
tory construction.

4
5

6
7

8

MS. VICKERS:

Well, Your Honor, I think that the pur­

pose of this Agreement, the enunciation by the framers, specif­
ically states in Article I that cooperative procedures are
going to be provided.

I think that that implies that they're

going to be the same procedures.

9

QUESTION:

At some point, Ms. Vickers, before you

10

complete, do you intend to address yourself to the question of

11

mootness ?

12

MS. VICKERS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, we believe also that the reliance placed

given

to

IV(d-)

In fact, the Interpretation

defeats the very purpose of the agreement,

which is the expeditious and orderly disposition of detainers.
QUESTION:
how you read IV(d).

But, Ms. Vickers, I'm a little puzzled on
What do you think IV(d) means?

MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, I think it means that the
12

1

prisoner has those rights enumerated in Paragraph (a).
2
QUESTION:

Why do you have to say that?

I mean, if

3

Paragraph (a) gives him those rights, do you have to put in
4

another paragraph that says, this article doesn't take away the
5

rights we just gave you?
6
7

8

MS. VICKERS:

I think, Your Honor, that was

is a clarifying reference and I think that it is not unusual in
statutes to find --

QUESTION:

10

11

What are the rights that the prisoner gets

It says the Governor has the right to withhold the

MS. VICKERS:

19

QUESTION:

23
24
25

That's right, if the prisoner petitions.

But you say, you think Paragraph (d) was

intended to preserve his right to petition the Governor?
MS. VICKERS:

21

22

That isn't spelled out here,

There's nothing in here that says he has the right to

18

20

that

Both that and to give him an opportunity

during the 30-day period to take whatever other action he might
deem appropriate.

For example, the petition for writ of habeas

corpus.
QUESTION:

Was that right given by Article IV(a)?
13

1

MS. VICKERS:

No, it is not.

2
QUESTION:

That's a right that, if it exists, exists

3

independently of IV(a).
4

MS. VICKERS:

That's right.

5

QUESTION:
6
7

tended to preserve that right, you're saying that Paragraph
IV(d) is preserving things not granted by IV(a).

8
9
10

MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, I believe the right to

petition for writ of habeas corpus is a right which cannot be
abrogated by particular statute.

11
12

So as soon as you admit that that was in­

QUESTION:

You wouldn't need to put in Subparagraph

(d) in order to preserve that right is what you're saying, then.

13

MS. VICKERS:

14

QUESTION:

That's right.

Then I find it difficult to understand what

15

IV(d) accomplishes if it does not preserve rights that exist

16

independently of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.

17

MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, I would agree that it pre­

18

serves a right which is a fundamental right, a right which is

19

not a matter of state law such as uniform extradition procedures

20

would be.

21

because of constitutional provisions.

22
23
24
25

But it would be a right which belongs to the prisoner

QUESTION:

Well, just to make it explicit, you then

concede that Paragraph IV(d) preserves rights beyond rights
which are granted in Paragraph (a)?
MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, within the framework of
14

1

this statute, the only right which this particular statutory
2
provision gives him is a right to petition the Governor, we be­
3

lieve.

However, this statute, taken as a whole, does not obli­

4

gate the prisoner's rights that he may have to file a petition
5

for writ of habeas corpus.
6
7
8
9
10

11

QUESTION:

For any other --

Or that right that he had before this

agreement was adopted to have certain procedural protections in
connection with extradition.
MS. VICKERS:

Well, Your Honor, I think at that point

we are getting into reliance on another statute and then we have
to look at the interrelationship between the Extradition Act

12

and the Detainer Agreement.

13

Extradition Act is a general statute which addresses the subject

14

of extradition of any persons, and it focuses on the extradition

15

of prisoners in a particular section but that focuses on both

16

sentenced and unsentenced prisoners, whereas the Detainer

17

Agreement specifically --

18

QUESTION:

And it is our position that the

I understand that, but would you agree that

19

before the Agreement on Detainers was adopted, the prisoner had

20

certain protections under the Extradition Act?

21

MS. VICKERS: Yes, Your Honor, he did.

However, the

22

protections that he had were possibly subject to modification

23

by the executive authority under Section 5, Your Honor.

24
25

The

executive authority of the state was free to enter into agree­
ments for the transfer of prisoners, and I think there there's
15

1

a possibility that under Section 5 -- I suggested that in my
2
brief -- the executive authority might enter into an agreement
3

which would differ from the Extradition Act procedures them­
4

selves when dealing with a prisoner.
5

QUESTION:
6

May I ask whether the language -- any right

that the prisoner may have -- couldn't refer to just any right

7

under state law?
8
9
10

11

MS. VICKERS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

It's not limited.

MS. VICKERS:

Yes, Your Honor, it may.

However, when

you have the general statute such as the Extradition Act and

12

then the enactment of a specific statute such as the Detainer

13

Agreement which focuses specifically on sentenced prisoners

14

who have a detainer lodged against them, then I think the terms

15

of the specific statute must control.

16

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not debating that point at the

17

moment; there's not a word in the Detainer Act that refers to

18

the Extradition Act, is there?

19

MS. VICKERS:

20

QUESTION:

21

There's nothing in the Detainer Act, no

specific reference, to the Extradition Act?

22

MS. VICKERS:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

No, Your Honor.

So my question was whether or not the

language that you have been discussing with Justice Stevens
couldn't be construed simply as applying to whatever rights may
16

1

exist under Pennsylvania law.
2

MS. VICKERS:

Yes, Your Honor, that would be correct,

3

except for the fact that the Detainer Agreement is a specific
4

statute which deals -5

QUESTION:
6
7
8
9
10

11

Well, I understand that.

MS. VICKERS:

And once, I think,

you have the enact­

ment of a specific statute which deals with the procedures to
be had when a prisoner is transferred, those are the procedures
which control.

And I believe that the language "any right"

refers to the 30-day waiting period and the opportunity that
the prisoner has to petition the Governor.

12

QUESTION:

There are really three ways to construe

3

that language.

thirdly, it could refer to any right given by other laws

including the extradition right.

That's your view.

MS. VICKERS:

Those are the three alterna­

Your Honor --

Your view, as I understand your brief, is

21

it refers just to Paragraph (a).

22

gested, well, maybe it refers to any right given by state law

23

except the Extradition Act.

24
25

Justice Powell has just sug­

And your opponent argues the third

alternative.
MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, I believe that the

interrelationship of the two Acts -- and I apologize for repeat­
2

ing myself, but I do think that that, in my mind, that is the
3

issue, the interrelationship of these two Acts,

the purpose

4

of the Extradition Act, the purpose of the Agreement on Detain­
5

ers.

There's a general statute which gives particular rights

6

to a class, and then there's a more specific statute which re­
7

fines the class and mandates a certain procedure for that class.

perfectly clear that we should not look at the legislative his­
tory that says it's not intended to waive the rights under the
extradition statute?

MS. VICKERS:

QUESTION:

Well, the extradition process, which are

designed for the protection of prisoners.

17

MS. VICKERS:

Right, Your Honor.

I don't believe

18

that the extradition process clearly includes a pretransfer

19

hearing.

20

legislation certainly doesn't require a pretransfer hearing.

21

And there may be valid state laws which would not require a pre­

22

transfer hearing.

23

that extradition process means a hearing.

25

The extradition clause in the federal implementing

That is our position.

Your Honor, if it please the Court, the consequences
of the decision of the 3rd Circuit have some very,
18

what we

1

believe to be some unreasonable effects and consequences.

First

2
of all, the decision provides greater procedural protections to
3

a prisoner who is wanted for trial in another state than to the
4

man on the street who is arrested on

a

Governor's warrant and

5

is transferred to another state.
6

8
9
10

Because now you have in ef­

fect the procedures of both the Detainer Agreement and the
Extradition Act which accrue to a prisoner, whereas the man in
the street is simply protected by the Extradition Act.

I would

submit that if there's a class of people, of the two, that
needs greater protection because of the basic interest involved,

11

I would say that the man on the street has a great deal more to

12

lose by what could be a permanent transfer to another jurisdic­

13

tion than a prisoner who is being transferred for a 120-day

14

period.

The prisoner's transfer under the Detainer Act is

This is a great bonus to an inmate.

Also, while he's serving the time in the demanding
jurisdiction, his sentence which he was serving in the asylum
state continues to be served.

He is not losing anything.

There might be interruption in his programs, perhaps he loses
his job, he's away from his family, but these are minor con­
siderations when compared to the loss suffered, the liberty
19

1

loss suffered by the man on the street when he’s arrested and

So it is an absurd result which the 3rd Circuit

3

decision requires, and respondent has argued in his brief that

the prisoner requires greater procedural protections.

would submit that that is on its face a meritless conclusion.

7
8

Well, I

And secondly, here it’s not the detainer which is
being attacked but the transfer itself.

9

Furthermore, there’s the matter of the 30-day waiting

period.

12

cific detainer.

This defeats one of the primary purposes of the

This 30-day period must elapse before any

3

procedure in court is begun, because during that 30-day period

4

the Governor of the state may sua sponte disapprove the

request.

6

this is the procedure we're using -- we must wait for the 30-day

7

period to elapse, then take the prisoner before a court of

8

record and at that point he can require a habeas corpus hearing.

9

So that there's a great deal of delay which has been built in

to the Agreement.

say about the mootness question too.
MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, I would conclude by saying

that the Agreement was fashioned to achieve several purposes.

14

There are several converging interests here.

15

outstanding criminal charges against them.

And finally, there's the interest of the pris­

himself in his rehabilitation and therefore all three

interests must be taken into consideration.
This statute is not a statute for the benefit of the
prisoner, as alleged by Respondent.

It is a statute which con­

siders the sovereign powers of the states, both the demanding
and the asylum state, and their relationship to the prisoner.

QUESTION:

-- Detainers.

Your Honor, the Agreement

I'm referring to the Agreement.
The court held, the Court of Appeals for

10

the 3rd Circuit held that the state laws, the protections ex­

11

tended by the state law, were extended in this case even though

12

it was also governed by the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.

3

Isn't that correct?

MS. VICKERS:

Your Honor, the interpretation.

I be­

lieve that even though it is a matter of individual state law,
the Agreement itself is a matter of state law because it has
been enacted in a particular state.
QUESTION:

That was the holding.

All right, but all that the Court of

rights —

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. CRAWFORD
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10

MR. CRAWFORD:

11
12

That's right, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

13

I'd like to begin by addressing myself to the ques­

14

tion posed by Mr. Justice Rehnquist and echoed by Mr. Justice

15

Stewart concerning whether this is a federal question case at

16
17
18
19

all.
It was very clear to the people who adopted the
Interstate compact on detainers that they were adopting -- or
the Interstate Agreement on Detainers; I have tried to put my
rabbit in my hat too far but — they enacted the Interstate

20

Agreement on Detainers but they did so very clearly under the
21

provisions of the Crime Control Consent Act of 1934.

All of

22

the material that went out about it said, this is the basis on
23

which this interstate compact is permitted.

So that, to the

24

degree that the people who adopted it could control whether this
25

23

1

was an interstate compact, they plainly meant it to be one.
2

QUESTION:

Yes, but the Court of Appeals for the 3rd

3

Circuit decided this case on the ground of what was extended to
4

your client by the state law.
5

MR. CRAWFORD:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, because --

6

QUESTION:

Not by the Agreement or the compact but

7

by the state law.
8

MR. CRAWFORD:

That is correct.

The compact, as a

9

federal law may do, the compact recognizes certain rights pro­
10

11
12
13
14

vided by state law.
QUESTION:

Which may vary from state to state.

MR. CRAWFORD:

Which may vary from state to state, but

an interstate —
QUESTION:

And the Court of Appeals simply held on

15

this that in the State of Pennsylvania state law accorded your

16

client certain protections and rights, and that's the end of it,

17

and isn't that a state law decision?

18

MR. CRAWFORD:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. CRAWFORD:

21

22
23

No, Mr. Justice Stewart.

Well, why isn't it?
Because state law accords everyone

under the extradition process certain rights.
QUESTION:

Yes, but Mr. Crawford, this is a 1983 suit,

is that right?

24

MR. CRAWFORD:

25

QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan.

And therefore you had to allege causes of
24

1

action either for violation of the Federal Constitution -2
MR. CRAWFORD:

Right.

3

QUESTION:

— or for violation of federal laws.

Now

4

I read your complaint and you do allege the violations of the

Federal Constitution, but where do you allege violations of

federal law?

MR. CRAWFORD:

Mr. Justice Brennan, this case is a

The prisoner did not allege any federal law

violations because he had not thought of the question which
obviously was later posed, I think properly, by the Court of
Appeals.

He raised serious constitutional questions which the

12

Court of Appeals did not reach and which this Court therefore

3

should not reach, because the Court of Appeals under Hagans v.

4

Lavine said, if there is a federal statute which can be inter­

QUESTION:
That's my problem.

That's it.

If there was a federal statute.

Where is it?

MR. CRAWFORD:

The federal statute, as I see it,

Mr. Justice Brennan, is the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.
QUESTION:

What precisely did the Congress, besides

21

adopting this as a matter of controlling federal detainers and

22

such, what process does the Compact

23

MR. CRAWFORD:

I think an interstate agreement becomes

a federal compact if it is adopted under the authority of
25

1

a congressional resolution permitting an interstate compact.
2
And in this case the fact that it is a federal law question,
3

the Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit fudged a little on
4

this.

They said, we don't know whether every interstate compact

5

presents a federal question but this interstate compact plainly

has been adopted in haec verba by the --

Mr. Crawford, what was the 1934 statute

MR. CRAWFORD:

11

QUESTION: Is that cited?

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. CRAWFORD:

14

QUESTION:

4 U.S.C.

112, is it not?

That's correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquxst.

And doesn't it say that the consent of

15

Congress is hereby given to any two or more states to enter

16

into agreements or compacts for cooperative effort and mutual

17

assistance in the prevention of crime?

18

MR. CRAWFORD:

It goes, I think, a little broader

19

than that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, as I remember it.

20

it's only been interpreted somewhat more broadly.

21

includes the punishment of crime or the other pieces of the

crime control mechanisms, and plainly this has to do with the
ability to prosecute crime and as such falls within the crime

QUESTION:

The Uniform Extradi­

It's a uniform act although it

may be hopefully interpreted the same way in varying states,
that's a state law question.
QUESTION:

Of course, if it's the case that an inter­

12

state compact — the interpretation of an interstate compact,

13

something that's admittedly a compact is a matter of state law;

14

that's something else again, but you think you have the best

15

of it on that.

16

MR. CRAWFORD:

Mr. Justice White, certainly the states

17

when they adopted it believed they were entering into an inter­

18

state compact.

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Oh, yes.

But what is the authority for

an admitted interstate compact being a federal question?
MR. CRAWFORD:

I think Petty vs. Tennessee-Missouri

Bridge would be the leading case on the point and it seems to
me very clear.

Common sense tells you that this Court was cor­

rect in that case -— whatever you may do in an area where you
have no control.. The uniform act would be wonderful if you could
27

1

bring uniform acts to some court somewhere and get uniform in­
2

terpretations.

There's no constitutional basis for it.

3

Where -- and the Court found in Petty, for example -4

that an interstate compact being authorized specifically by the
5

Constitution and by Act of Congress presents a federal question,
6

then the great wisdom that permits such a compact to be inter­

7

preted by this Court, or initially by the lower federal courts,
8
9
10

11
12
13
14
15

brings a uniformity which is not only desirable, as in the
uniform acts, but also achievable, because there's a constitu­
tional framework.
QUESTION:

But 112 provides for the execution of

agreements or compacts, does it not?
MR. CRAWFORD:

I'm sorry, Justice Rehnquist, I don't

remember that but -QUESTION:

It's to be found in footnote 1 of the Court

16

of Appeals' opinion, on page 3a of the Petition for Certiorari.

17

"Consent of Congress is hereby given to any two or more states

18

to enter into agreements or compacts for cooperative effort and

19

mutual assistance in the prevention of crime and in the enforce­

20

ment of their respective criminal laws and policies, and to

21

establish such agencies, joint or otherwise, as they may deem

22

desirable for making effective such agreements and compacts."

23

That's the extent of the statute.

24
25

MR. CRAWFORD:

Well, plainly, Justice Stewart, if

consent of Congress is needed for these agreements or compacts,
28

1
then they're both compacts for the purpose of the Compact Clause.

2
If these are agreements of some other sort, congressional con­
3

sent wasn't needed, so the fact that Congress used the word
4

"agreement" and that the framers of this compact used the word
5

6
7

"agreement" I think is immaterial to the interpretation in this
case.
QUESTION:

Well, what do you do with the Multistate

8

Tax Commission then?

9

or three years ago, where the thing had been submitted to

10

11

The case that this Court handed down two

Congress and Congress had refused to approve it?
MR. CRAWFORD:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it seems to me

12

a very different situation when you say, you didn't need a com­

13

pact in order to reach this agreement.

14

situation from the case in which the states choose to follow

15

Congress and the states choose to follow the Compact Clause.

16

I don't see Multistate Tax Commission as saying, you can't make

17

a compact about anything but this very narrow area.

18

stand the case to say it is unnecessary to get congressional

19

approval outside the narrow area.

20
21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

It's a very different

I under­

Well, but could Congress by writing a

broad, blanket, general approval of all sorts of agreements
between the states make all such agreements federal questions?
MR. CRAWFORD:
Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

I don't know the answer to that,
I think they did in this case.

It may

be that there's some limit as to how broadly they can go.
29

1

But I think this is the sort of concern which is at worst on the

2

edge of the area where compacts are needed and certainly not one

3

where, if the Congress authorized it and the states accept that

4

authorization, this Court should now say, you thought you had a

5

compact and an agreement under the Compact Clause, but you

6

didn't.

I don't see that that's appropriate in this case.
QUESTION:

7

Mr. Crawford, let me put it to you this

8

way.

Supposing after the 3rd Circuit decision in this case the

9

Governor of Pennsylvania and the Governor of New Jersey got

10

together and said, we really intended the result that the

11

Pennsylvania Supreme Court holding would allow; we don't want tc

12

13
14
15

have extradition procedures apply in detainer areas, therefore
let's adopt an amendment to the agreement between these two
states which specifically says, no extradition-type hearings in
the detainer area.

Would there need to be the approval of

Congress for such an agreement?

And if, on the second question,

16

would that agreement be subject to construction by us?
17

MR. CRAWFORD:

To back in, Justice Stevens, first off,

18

obviously that agreement would not be subject to construction
19

by you unless it were a compact.
20

QUESTION:

Right.

21

MR. CRAWFORD:

I believe this is an area --

22

QUESTION:

Suppose that agreement is authorized by

23

just broad, general language in Section 112:
24

relating to the enforcement of criminal law"?
25

30

"Any agreements

1
MR. CRAWFORD:

Then it is a compact and then it is

2
subject to interpretation by this Court.

But the interpretation

3

would approve that agreement, because the whole focus of this
4

case and the whole misguided argument against the decision of
5
6
7

8
9
10

the Court of Appeals, as I see it, is this Interstate Agreement
on Detainers did not create the rights about which we are
talking.

It federalized those rights in the sense that when

the Interstate Agreement was written, they said, we choose to
preserve all those rights which existed; we don't want to meddle
with these rights and we thereby federalize them.

11

If Pennsylvania chose to repeal the Uniform Extradi­

12

tion Act, which it has a perfect right to do, and to go down to

13

what two states -- there are still two left that have no. uniform

14

act on this -- have and have simply the right to use governors'

15

warrants, no habeas corpus, no hearings, then there will be a

16

question of whether there is some kind of inherent law to pro­

17

tect a person being extradited -- the cases as I read them say

18

there is very little if any -- and you would remove these

19

rights.

And I would point out last, the Supreme Court of

20
21

22
23
24

But you remove these rights by changing state law.

Pennsylvania has never decided this case.

The Superior Court

of Pennsylvania merely decided that the interstate compact as
they had interpreted it -- an interpretation was never argued
to them -- wasn't unconstitutional.

That's all that's been

Would it be within the authority of the

two governors to say that with respect to the questions of
interpreting the agreement for prisoners who are in custody in
Pennsylvania, decisions of the Pennsylvania courts shall control
whereas with respect to prisoners in custody in New Jersey,
the decisions of the New Jersey state courts shall control,
and in no event shall the federal courts depart from those in­
structions ?

9

MR. CRAWFORD:

I hesitate to think about what people

10

can do to rip jurisdictions from federal courts.

11

so many tough questions in the area.

12

Mr. Justice Stevens, but I probably should have to think it out

13

more.

14

for example the legislatures of the two states modified the

15

Extradition Act to remove these rights only from people who are

16

serving terms in prison would be subject to a substantial con­

17

stitutional argument on equal protection grounds.

prisoners would win it.

I have watchec

I don't think that works,

It seems to me that the analogous situation in which

I don't know.

I think the

But in any case there'd
whether there isn't

a similar substantial constitutional question when the governors
get together and say, we're going to let our highest state
courts provide the "rippers" instead of our Legislature.
I don't know the answer to that;

we'd

have to find out what

the state courts did, but they haven't done that here.

At pre­

sent we have the uniform agreement in exactly the terms in
25

32

1
which it was entered.
2

I wonder if I could spend a minute on the statutory
3

construction, although I think that some questions from
4

Mr. Justice Powell and Mr. Justice Stevens pretty much construed
5

it. as I see it.
6
QUESTION:

Save a minute or two for mootness also.

7

MR. CRAWFORD:
8
9
10

11

I will do so, Mr. Chief Justice.

This is a statute which -- I was going to open my
argument -- a few things that everyone agrees here, and one is,
this is a statute for the protection of prisoners.
legislative history and material says so.

All of the

The reason states

12

get a chance to move cases faster is because, said the framers,

13

the Council on State Government, this is for the benefit of

14

prisoners.

15

promptly.

16

fit of prisoners, but I suggest that if you look at all the

17

legislative history -- and this legislative history is different

18

from some places because this uniform agreement was circulated

19

with an attached piece of history right with it— everybody who

20

adopted it knew what they were getting.

21

They are better off if their cases are disposed of

I can no longer say we all agree it's for the bene­

This is an Act for the protection of prisoners and

22

it's being interpreted by the State here to have taken substan­

23

tial rights away from prisoners.

24
25

And I suggest, if that's what

the Act was going to do, it would have done so very explicitly.
There is no language which says there are any rights which
33

1

2
3
4

prisoners previously had under state law that are being taken
away from them.

Instead, there is Section IV(d) which says,

any rights you have are preserved.
Secondly, the construction of the detainer agreement

5

within itself plainly supports this.

6

with Article III, the prisoner-initiated transfer, in which the

7

prisoner waives extradition -- precisely the term, by the way,

8

that's used in the Extradition Act.

9

Act says, if you don't want to go through all these procedures,

You have the contrast

Section 26 of the Uniform

10

you waive extradition,

11

And the Extradition Act was the law of the vast majority of the

12

states when the compact or the Agreement was drawn up.

13

you don't waive Extradition Act.

So they're obviously thinking in precisely those

14

terms. They say, if you want to go to another state, you can't

15

also ask for a bunch of rights which you may have.

16
17
18
19

you've got, you give up.

Whatever

But by clear contrast, if a prosecu­

tor somewhere else wants to take you across the state lines,
you keep any rights you had.
The framers sent out just a couple of pages of legis­
lative history to go with it, and one of the things they said

20

is, we have some questions whether we constitutionally can take
21

away those rights or whether it's proper to take away those
22

rights, but in any case we have clearly not done so; we've pre­
23

served whatever rights existed — not Extradition Act rights;
24

some states didn't have an Extradition Act; then there were no
25

34

1

Extradition Act rights to preserve; but we've preserved what­
2

ever is there.
3

Finally, interpreting the Extradition Act this way has
4

the great benefit of avoiding some tough constitutional ques­
5
6
7

tions.

I'm assuming -- and I do assume this -- that this is an

interstate compact and that it's subject to interpretation by
this Court; then this Court has ample -- the worst that could

be said about the position that I'm taking is that perhaps the

Act has an ambiguity.

No, but on statutory interpretations?
There have been state courts which have

interpreted federal statutes.

They have a right to under the

whole federal system, and this Court reads them, and if they're
well reasoned, it follows them.

But there is no

more

rea­

son to follow a state court decision in this case than there
would be to follow it in an interpretation of the Social
Security Act.

8

QUESTION:

And then there's no constitutional

Well, but the reason that it's free to

9

interpret it is because it's an agreement under the Interstate

10

Commerce Compact Clause, according to you, and that gives rise

11

under the Petty case to a body of constitutional law.
MR. CRAWFORD:

12

But I would have said federal common

and in this case common sense in statutory construction.

I am assuming that we're here, and obviously if we're
not, then the case may have to go back to the 3rd Circuit, they
may have to decide the constitutional questions they thought
were avoided.
I do want to make a couple of points more.

I think

22
23

that the Court should be aware, as it probably is, because its
Extradition Act cases recognized precisely the breadth of — or,

24

its extradition cases which have interpreted the Extradition Act
25

36

1

recognized the very narrow rights which that Act gives.
2
3
4
5
6
7

You

have four rights; they are all fairly pro forma rights, but on
occasion extremely important rights.

You have a right to find

out that the documents are in order, that you've been charged
with a crime in the demanding state, that you're the person
named in the papers, and that you're a fugitive — or on occa­
sion, because you may have, under another section of the Act,

8

committed the crime from outside the state, whether you come

9

within the Act.

10

11
12

Very narrow rights, but they are rights you

have to be heard.
I suggest that for that reason there is no need to
have delay.

I think that Ms. Vickers is quite right, this

3

agreement contemplates prompt transfer and that delay would go

4

against the interpretation of the Agreement, although if the

5

Agreement plainly calls for certain delays, and the 30-day

6

delay, for instance, is in there -- this question plagued the

7

Court somewhat in the Mauro case where, unfortunately,

8

Mr. Justice White doesn't say whether this is an interstate

9

compact or not --

Well, that was a federal statute.

MR. CRAWFORD:

It was a federal statute in that case;

that's correct.

Not quite the problem in that case.

Exactly.
In any

case, the delays -- as this

12

Court recognized in

Extradition Act shows -- are very limited delays.

14

reason in the world why the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or

15

anybody else has to

wait the 30 days while you're waiting for

16

the Governor not to

disapprove. Because, remember, there

17

no need for the Governor to send any paper that says, you may

In this case, or in fact, under extradition practice
in general — in this case the Governor has 30 days in which he
may, if there is a public policy reason to do so, say the
framers -- he may decide to disapprove.

There are always those

rare cases where you don't want to send your state's prisoner
to another state which you think will stomp on his rights, how­

delay involved.

So there's no

There are very limited rights involved, and

it's no question of whether this Court is going to be giving

8

rights to prisoners even that they didn't have before, because

9

a state which doesn't have these rights for its citizens

10

11

generally doesn't give them to prisoners through this case.
So that it's a very narrow case of very clear inter­

12

pretation, and it's a case that isn't moot.

13

end on that point.

14

I would like to

It's not moot for two reasons.

First, we don't know how much Mr. Adams may be

15

entitled to in the way of damages.

16

which have never been dealt with because this isn't a 12(b)

17

dismissal, this is simply an answer to the complaint which

18

denied some allegations and then said, and the case should be

19

dismissed for failure to state a federal claim.

20
21

22
23

He began with allegations

He alleges that he had an alibi witness, his mother,
who would have spoken up for him, and that the New Jersey
authorities carefully waited until her death and as soon as she
died they filed these papers.

It's conceivable that he pleaded

guilty in New Jersey, maintaining his innocence to the end but
24

saying, my only witnesses who could have defended me are dead.
25

39

1

There are a lot of things that are conceivably proven in this
2

case.

I don't assume large damages, but we don't know that the

3

damages may be nominal; under Carey vs. Piphus, whether they may
4

be of modest substance; whether he may have suffered the
5

destruction of a program which would have enabled him to get a

prison job on which he could have made a little bit of money;
you don't know what kinds of damages might be involved.
also has --

10

He

QUESTION:

That really doesn't make any difference

to the question of mootness.

11

MR. CRAWFORD:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. CRAWFORD:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. CRAWFORD:

If he has damages?

Even if nominal.
That's correct.

In addition --

That's not moot, is it?
I trust that under this generally

16

framed complaint written by a prisoner, that the Court will

17

consider it as a request for declaratory judgment.

18

it's not moot for his damage claim, this is a proper time for a

19

court to declare, this statute means this.

And that would be

20

the other grounds on which it is not moot.

I see no mootness

21

22
23
24
25

Assuming

here.
Unless there are any questions from the Court, I think
I have covered the points which I feel need to be made.
QUESTION:

I have two questions.

First, there are

40-some-odd states that have adopted the Agreement.
40

Are the

1

terms of the Agreement precisely the same for everybody who
2

signs up?

3
4
5
6
7

MR. CRAWFORD:

Unlike the Uniform Act, the Agreement

has been adopted in exactly the same words by, I believe, 47
states.

We counted wrong in the brief.

Mississippi has

adopted neither of these Acts and we missed it when we counted,
as I think the Court below did.

But 47 states and a number of

8

federal jurisdictions, Puerto Rico and the like, have adopted

9

it in exact words.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. CRAWFORD:

12

QUESTION:

13

But there are no —
Exact words.

-- separate amendments such as I discussed

with you before?

14

MR. CRAWFORD:

15

QUESTION:

None.

And secondly, I take it it’s your view

16

that if we don't construe the statute we also do not reach any

17

constitutional question that's been argued in the briefs?

18
19

20
21

22
23

MR. CRAWFORD:

I've argued them in the brief -- and at

that time I had argued them in the court below; they are plainly
posed in the case, they plainly had to be argued here to show
that there are substantial constitutional reasons for this
interpretation -- but it seems to me, Mr. Justice Stevens, that
since the 3rd Circuit has never spoken on those questions, if
you have to reach the constitutional questions, they're the

24

people who have to do it.
25

41

1

QUESTION:
2
3
4

So then the disposition, if we disagree

with you on whether or not there's a federal question, your
proposed disposition would be to remand for consideration of
those constitutional questions?

5

MR. CRAWFORD:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. CRAWFORD:

8

Those other constitutional questions.
Those other constitutional questions.

That's right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

9

Thank you very much.

10

11

That is correct.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
remaining, Ms. Vickers.

21

MS. VICKERS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I would just like to point out that the

30-day delay which Mr. Crawford seems to feel is not a real
delay is a very substantial one, because in the event that we
do take a prisoner before a court of record and there is a dis­
approval for the request for custody by the Governor, you have

22
23

dissipation of court time.

You have -- this is repeated across

the land, and I think that's a very real consideration.

The

24

30-day delay is a real one.

We have to wait until the 31st day

25

42

before we can petition the courts for a hearing and then possi­

think that is a very substantial handicap and a very debili­
tating consequence of this interpretation.
