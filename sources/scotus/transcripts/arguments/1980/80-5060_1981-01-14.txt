Chief Justice, and may it please

This case comes here from Hopkinsville, Kentucky,
after petitioner was convicted of third degree burglary and
persistent felony offender in the first degree, and was
sentenced to 20 years.
The issue that this case brings here today was pre­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN MICHAEL McNALLY, ESQ.,

6

8

We'll hear arguments

sented to the Kentucky Supreme Court which affirmed Mr. Carter's
conviction.

The issue is whether, under the circumstances of

this case and by virtue of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments
to the United States Constitution, a protective or prophylac­
tic instruction must be given upon the defendant's request
regarding the defendant's exercise of his Fifth Amendment

19

privilege.
20

QUESTION:

Can we begin with the proposition that

21

the State of Kentucky through its Legislature as a matter of
22

policy has said that no one should talk about this issue to
23

the jury?
24

MR. McNALLY:

The Kentucky Legislature as did most

25

3

1

states passed a statute permitting the defendant to testify

2

and stating that no comment shall be made.

3
4

5

QUESTION:

That's what I'm addressing myself to,

the prohibition against comments.
MR. McNALLY:

The instruction itself does not speci­

6

fically address the issue of a protective instruction.

7

Kentucky Supreme Court has on a number of occasions inter­

8

preted that statute to mean that no comments at all may be

9

permitted regarding the defendant's failure to testify.

10

QUESTION:

The

And the question here that you're bringing

11

to us is not whether this would be a sensible and a sound

12

thing to do but

13

prophylactic instruction be given on request even though the

14

Kentucky statute says it is not to be?

15

16

21

that

the

MR. McNALLY:

Constitution requires that the

Well, I must disagree on one minor

point with you, Mr. Chief Justice.

The statute doesn't

address the issue of instruction and the Kentucky court has
held, taken conflicting positions on that point.
QUESTION:

But doesn't the statute say it should not

be mentioned?
MR. McNALLY:
QUESTION:

It says no comments shall be made.

Yes.

Well, what does that mean, except

22

MR. McNALLY:

Well, as this Court indicated in

23

Lakeside, what the prohibition in Griffin, for example, was
24

that no adverse comment shall be made.
25

4

And that would be,

1

we think, a reasonable interpretation of the statute.

But we

2

do not bring here a question of state interpretation.

And as

3

the Chief Justice pointed out, this is not a case of what is

4

the most desirable rule, although our position is, we submit,

5

by light of the vast majority of authorities, the most desir­

6

able rule.
The question here is, as referred to in Cupp v.

7

8

Naughten, what exactly does the Constitution specifically re­

9

quire?

10

And that's what makes this case different from any

other alleged instructional error.
We want to indicate right at the outset our sensi­

1 1

12

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

tivity to the undercurrent in the Commonwealth's brief that
somehow we're asking this Court to be a sort of author for
Kentucky form instructions.

Again what makes this case dif­

ferent is the basic, fundamental nature of the Fifth Amendment
privilege.

It takes it out of the realm of all other, we

think, alleged instructional errors that might be presented
to this Court at various times.
We present two analyses for the Court's considera­
tions, the first finding its genesis in the Fifth Amendment

20
21

privilege itself,
Fifth Amendment.

the second in the Due Process Clause of the
And while, of course, these themes are inter

22

related, for a logical analysis we have discussed them
23

separately in our brief and will do so in this argument, if
24

the Court permits.
25

5

We have no intention of dwelling on the facts of

1

2

this case but there are two principal factual themes we would

3

like to emphasize.

4

which perhaps in another case we might be arguing in the

5

abstract.

6

of the defendant's silence at trial.

7

theme throughout this trial that the defendant refused to

8

explain himself at any point in the proceedings.

9

to explain himself to the police, and this was testified to by

10

two police officers at trial; was repeatedly emphasized by the

17

What they do is dramatize legal principles

The first of those is what we would call the "roar"
There was a continuing

He refused

prosecutor's questions; and even a waiver form was introduced
in which, on the bottom of it in big back letters was written,
"Defendant refuses to answer questions" or something -- I'm
paraphrasing.
Not only was there mention during the testimony re­
garding the defendant's refusal to give his reasons why he was
admittedly arrested under incriminating circumstances, but the
prosecution's arguments to a subtle extent, we will admit, but

18

the prosecution'sarguments certainly brought that to the
19

attention of the jury.
20

QUESTION:

Well, is your submission limited to the

21

fact situation here, or are you urging as a general proposi­
22

tion that upon request, upon request by the defendant, the
23

instruction that you sought and was denied must be given?
24

MR. McNALLY:

That is our alternative contention.

25

6

1

QUESTION:

That's on the alternative; I see.

2

MR. McNALLY:

In the alternative.

Of course, our

3

primary reliance is on the facts of this case.

4

we not have these, what I would call, illustrative facts in

5

this case, of the legal principles, we would still be making

6

the same arguments.

7

QUESTION:

However, would

Well, now, while I have you interrupted,

8

may I ask, and do you also take the position that if the trial

9

judge decides to give an instruction like this without a

10

request, that you should be at liberty to object?
MR. McNALLY:

1 1

12

vidual state procedure.
QUESTION:

13

16

That was decided in Lakeside.

MR. McNALLY:

14

15

Well, that would depend on the indi­

That was the issue decided in Lakeside,

and we certainly don't question Lakeside.

It's one of the

primary authorities upon which we rely.
MR. McNALLY:

The other facts at trial which empha­

17

size the defendant's refusal to testify or explain himself were
18

-- even the defense argued, for example.

Defense counsel at­

19

tempted to deal with this issue as best he could without the
20

protection of the trial court, and the only way he apparently
21

thought he could do that was to mention the fact, what was,
22

in fact -- it was obvious to the jury and everyone else in the
23

courtroom -- and state that the defendant had the right not to
24

testify.

He stated that, in fact, the defendant doesn't have

25

7

1

to do anything.

Now, while that is constitutionally accurate,

2

we submit that it may have been perceived as either inaccurate

3

by the jury or perhaps even arrogande on the part Of defense

4

counsel.
This illustrates why we need the court's protection.

5

6

There is no effective way a trial lawyer can deal with this

7

issue, at least under the circumstances of this case, other

8
9

10

1 1

than in instruction from the court.

tell the jury, even if that were permitted, why the defendant
did not testify, for to do so, would bring about the exact
evil he was trying to avoid.
The other illustrative factual theme in this case is

12

13
14

15
16

For example, he couldn't

that the defendant in this case, we submit
strates

the record demon­

that he did not, he declined to testify for reasons

which were neutral on the question of guilt or innocence.
The defense counsel made it clear that in an in-chambers
hearing that possibly the only reason defense -- I'm sorry --

17

the only reservation he had regarding testimony was his fear
18

of impeachment.

I don't think that any reasonable reading of

19

the record would give rise to the challenge that the Common­
20

wealth makes that impeachment was not the reason why he did
21

not testify.

And indeed, in the court below the Commonwealth

22

admitted in their brief that "most definitely the impeachment
23

influenced the appellant in his decision not to take the
24

stand."
25

QUESTION:

1

2

I still don't understand why the reason

is of interest to us?
MR. McNALLY:

3

Merely because it illustrates,

4

Mr. Justice Marshall, the point that has been made in perhaps

5

the abstract in other cases, that there are neutral reasons

6

why a defendant would decide not to testify at trial.

7

illustrative, ittis not necessary.
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, does the Fifth Amendment say

anything about that?

that?
MR. McNALLY:
QUESTION:

No, it doesn't, and --

Well, why is it then of interest to us?

MR. McNALLY:

It's relevant to the Fourteenth

Amendment issue which we are also raising.
QUESTION:

How is it relevant?

MR. McNALLY:

It's relevant because the Fourteenth

The defendant has a right to do it for

MR. McNALLY:

Under the Fifth Amendment, absolutely,

22

Mr. Justice Marshall.
23

QUESTION:

Well, then, why is the reason important?

24

MR. McNALLY:

Because this Court's interest and

concern in due process analysis has been the truth-seeking

function, and we submit that under the facts of this case the

The jury concluded that the

In that sense,

under a due process analysis, a protective instruction is ne­
cessary because it is relevant to the truth-seeking function
of the trial, and in that sense this fact is relevant.
QUESTION:

If a judge on his own initiative gave

such an instruction, I suppose he might be subject to an objec
tion that he was calling attention to something which the
defendant wanted to avoid?
MR. McNALLY:

Conceivably. That was the issue in

Lakeside, and the issue that was -22

MR. McNALLY:

MR. McNALLY:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That's correct.

Your alternative is that in any event

the Fifth Amendment, in every case where you ask it, requires

‘that the instruction be given.
21

MR. McNALLY:

Mr. Justice Brennan, that is exactly

22

our position.

And I'll explain why that is if I may.

23

Now, we differ with the Commonwealth's suggestion
24

that we're asking this Court to expand the parameters of the

withstand an historical analysis, and we think that
reasons.

12

13
14

for these

At the time of the enactment of the Fifth Amendment

a defendant was not permitted to testify.

This was, as this

Court recognized in Wilson v. United States, considered a
protection for him.

In other words, there was a feeling at

the time that a defendant if he were permitted to testify
would be under some form of compulsion to do so lest the jury
take an adverse inference against him.
In approximately 1878 Congress, as did many states,

10
11

We think that our position can

passed statutes permitting defendants to testify.

Once they

did so, we think that a -- the jury, naturally, will take
an adverse inference against a defendant who declines to
exercise that privilege.

Since at the time of the adoption

15

of the Fifth Amendment the defendant was not permitted to

16

testify, he was not expected to do so.

17

that sense we request a protective instruction under the

18

Fifth Amendment so that this Court can restore the original

19

balance.

20
21

Now, he is.

And in

We are not asking the Court to tip the balance

in the favor of the defendant.
QUESTION:

Do you think the jurors were always

22

familiar with the precise state of the legislation in the

23

state as pre-1915 or post-1915, that the defendant was not

24

allowed to testify or he was allowed to testify?

MR. McNALLY:

I have never read a trial transcript

from 1850, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I think it's reasonable
to conclude that jurors at that time knew that the defendant
was not permitted to testify.

that or whether they knew it from being intelligent and civic
minded citizens, I don't know, but I think that is a rea­
sonable conclusion.
QUESTION:

Now, whether counsel told them

Was there anything to prevent in those

days defense counsel from telling the juror that even if the

federal statute while obviously not constitutional in nature
is merely an enactment of the Fifth Amendment, and the Court
suggested that you could substitute the words Fifth Amendment
for the word Act and the spirit of the self-incrimination
privilege would be captured.
We submit that as Wilson was translated into the

watered-down version of the

we seek in this case.
Another Fifth Amendment point that we would like to

this case?

The Court might ask, where is the compulsion in
Where is the penalty extracted?

Well, the

penalty that we identify in this record, and indeed in any
case where a defendant doesn’t testify, is the unchecked
speculation, if I could use the words of the dissenters in
Griffin, what the jury will do in regard to the defendant’s
failure to testify.

That is, we think a constitutionally

significant form of compulsion -- and in that sense, this

23

case fits within the Griffin analysis -- and indeed, we would

24

submit, as the Court may recall, in Griffin there was cer­

25

tain protective comments by the California trial judge.

He indeed told that jury that the defendant in fact had a
constitutional right not to testify.

He also permitted them

to take adverse inference from the failure, and the prosecu­
tor also commented, but in the sense that a protective in­
struction was given in Griffin, this case is even more dra­
matically illustrative of a penalty extracted for exercise
of the privilege.
QUESTION:

Mr. McNally, if you're right -- compellec

Fifth Amendment also require the giving of the, instruction
whether or not a request is made?
MR. McNALLY:
QUESTION:

I know it's not.

MR. McNALLY:
QUESTION:

Well, that issue is not presented --

-- in this case.

I know.

MR. McNALLY:

We're looking down the road.

There is a countervailing legitimate,

we think, state interest in the situation that you refer to,
Mr. Justice Brennan, and that is the requirement that issues
be first presented to a trial judge so that he may rule
upon, he may in fact, give an instruction upon request.
Therefore, the whole issue is eliminated.

That distinction

is a very important -QUESTION:

But nevertheless, if it must be given on

such as Wainwright v. Sykes, for example, that trial counsel

can waive issues of federal constitutional negligence.

If he doesn't request it, it is to be

have to examine the particular case.

What if a state's decided that the

18

in this particular case, there must be a finding

20

there is a difference in some of the cases which indicate,

21

the trilogy of cases, Bruno, Griffin, and Lakeside, which in­

22

dicate maybe a preference for this type of an instruction.

23

The Supreme Court of Kentucky, as you've noted, does not be­

25

have stated on numerous occasions that they believe it does

11

Are you suggesting Kentucky is kind of

a lean instruction state where the preference within consti­

tutional limits, not just on this particular kind of a charge

14

but on any charge, is that you just don't charge the jury

him not to testify?

The Court --

But you're saying

is not a form of

compulsion.

7

MR. BULLOCK: Well, the court has held in the past

8

that it's not a form of compulsion for a defendant to have to

9

make hard choices in the case, such as, the Court has held

10

that when an individual decides to take the stand and testify

1 1

in his own defense, there can be cross-examination, and cross-

12

examination as to the guilt on that particular case.

13

that's not considered compulsion.

man may have to plead for his life, his very life, the fact

And

Likewise, the Court in a

What would you imagine a jury would

think, other than that the man is guilty?

No one knows what an individual jury will think or

QUESTION:

They may not notice it?

MR. BULLOCK:

In -- that's been part of the supposi­

7

tion of the Kentucky courts on this particular issue.

8

But there is an additional part of the instruction in this

9

particular case, if you will recall.

The court in this case

10

instructed that the jury shall consider the evidence alone

11

and in arriving at its decision on guilt or innocence, the

12

failure to testify is obviously not evidence, and its con­

13

sideration would have violated the court's instruction.

Therefore --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN MICHAEL McNALLY, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

7

MR. McNALLY:

I'd just like to address ourselves

8

briefly to the question of harmless error since we didn't

9

originally address that.

10

First of all, it was not presented below, and after

1 1

the discussion this morning, it's clear to me it's not juris­

12

dictional but we think that there are good reasons why this

13

Court would not want to reach that particular issue at this

14

time.

15

jury sentencing, we feel that any harmless error analysis

16

would have to include Kentucky's unique procedure and in that

17

sense the policy is correct, that it would be better to let

18

the Kentucky Supreme Court address that issue first.

19

Since Kentucky is one of the few jurisdictions with

though, wasn't it?

MR. McNALLY:

Substantial rights, I believe,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is the key phrase in the statute you

refer to.

4

that the substantial rights of the defendant were affected

5

without any factual analysis in the opinion indicates that in

6

this case it also affected the substantial rights ; and fur­

7

ther, that the Chapman and Harrington analysis is a stricter

8

standard from our perspective than even the federal harmless

9

error statute, and in that sense, since it's not harmless

And we submit that the Court's holding in Bruno

10
