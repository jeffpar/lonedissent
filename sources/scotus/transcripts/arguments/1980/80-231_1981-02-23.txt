MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

arguments in the case of the Secretary v. Indiana.
Mr. Buscemi, I think you may proceed whenever you

are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER BUSCEMI, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

7

MR. BUSCEMI:

8
9
10

We will proceed to hear

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case is much the same as the Virginia case,

1 1

and with respect to at least the Tenth Amendment and the

12

Commerce Clause, I'm pretty much content to rely on what has

13

already been said and what's said in the brief.

14

This case is here on direct appeal from the District

15

Court for the Southern District of Indiana.

16

provisions challenged here are different and far more numerous

17

than those invalidated by the Virginia District Court, and I'd

18

like to begin by describing briefly the portions, of the Act

19

that are at issue here.

20

The statutory

The first group of statutory provisions are the

21

so-called prime farmland provisions.

22

of the Act that impose special requirements where a mine

23

operator proposes to undertake surface mining operations on

24

lands that satisfy the Secretary of Agriculture's definition

25

of prime farmland -- and this is something that tends to be
3

Those are six subsections

1

ignored in the District Court's consideration of the case and

2

in appellees' brief -- that historically have been used for

3

intensive agricultural purposes.

4

land that someone classifies as prime farmland on the basis

5

of a soil sample.

6

for agricultural purposes.
QUESTION:

7

So this is just not some

This is land that has been used intensively

And it's your position that Congress

8

under the Commerce Clause can freeze that classification?

9

it was once used as prime farmland, it's going to be prime

10

If

farmland?

1 1

MR. BUSCEMI:

12

Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

13

mining is undertaken on prime farmland, then before the permit

14

is issued the operator has to to demonstrate that his techno­

15

logical capability to restore that land to equivalent or

16

higher levels of yield as non-mined prime farmland in the

17

surrounding area under equivalent levels of management.

18

So the statute simply says that if you've got prime farmland

19

and it's been used as prime farmland, dnd you propose to

20

surface mine it, when you finish you've got to put it back

21

into the same productive condition that it was in before.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. BUSCEMI:

That's not what the statute does,
The statute only says that if surface

And to keep it that way for five years?
There Is the provision that there

24

has to be revegetation and that revegetation has to exist for

25

a period of five years.

There is some question about how the

tary issued a regulation requiring the growing of row crops.
That regulation was invalidated by the District Court in the
District of Columbia.

13
14

now what the D.C. Circuit will do or whether the new Adminis­
tration will continue all of these policies, including this
one.

So that, at least, as for right now, the row crop regu­

lation is not in effect and all we're talking about is revege­
tation .
Now, the operator will also have to show that he
can meet the soil reconstruction standards for prime farmland.
They require that the different topsoil layers be removed
separately and restored separately.
There are also a number of other generally applica­

15
16

18
19

The Secretary has appealed that to the

D.C. Circuit, but of course there is no way of knowing right

1 1

12

The Secre­

ble provisions, that is, not applicable only to prime fdrmlanc,
that were challenged in the Indiana case and not in the
Virginia case.

They include the general requirement that

topsoil be removed separately and the general requirement

20

for

the

submission

of

reclamation plans before the

21

beginning of surface mining.

22

tell the regulatory authority, whether it's a state authority

23

or the federal authority, what the premining use of the land

24

is, what the postmining proposed use is, and describe the

25

methods by which the postmining use will be achieved.

These plans are supposed to

5

And finally there's a challenge in the Indiana case
2

to Sections 522(a), -(c), and -(d) of the Act, also not chal­

3

lenged in the Virginia case, that involve the establishment

4

of procedures for designating land as unsuitable for surface

5

mining.

6

mining within specified areas of roads, schools, parks, and

7

churches, and so on, was also challenged in the Indiana case

8

as was the civil penalty provision.

9

Section 522(e), which is the statute that prohibits

Now, perhaps I can talk first, since I didn't reach

10

it in the other case, about the Just Compensation Clause

11

point.

12

tion is that the Just Compensation argument is premature here

13

because we're not focussing on any particular piece of land.

14

That makes the case different from the vast majority if not

15

all of the cases in which this Court has considered taking

16

challenges to state or federal regulatory actions.

17

In this case, as In the Virginia case, our first posi­

Neither the plaintiffs in the Indiana case nor those

18

in the Virginia case have focussed on any particular piece of

19

property --

20

QUESTION: You mean that issue could be raised at a

21

later point by another litigant.

22

MR. BUSCEMI:

Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.

As

23

this Court said in Agins v. Tiburon, just last term, the

24

only Issue here is whether the mere enactment of the statute

25

constitutes a taking, because we don't know how the statute
6

1

is going to apply to a particular piece of property.

We can

2

evaluate the other beneficial uses that might be available to

3

the property owner.

4

QUESTION:

But that Is interpreting a California

5

statute where the California courts had held there was no such

6

thing as inverse condemnation.

7

Tucker Act provides that there is inverse condemnation.

And as I understand, the

14

tion in the Eastport Shipping case that was cited in the

15

brief that perhaps the Court of Claims would think that the

16

Tucker Act jurisdiction does not go that far, but I completely

17

agree, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the availability of the

18

Tucker Act is a factor that

19

before addressing this Just Compensation Clause question "be­

20

cause if the alleged taking of a particular piece of property

21

can be redressed through the providing of compensation, then

22

there's no constitutional violation, because the Just Compen­

That's right.

And I think that it's

important -- I mean, I think that that just --

11

QUESTION:

Is that true also in the other case?

12

MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes, it is.

I mean, I think that just

13

supports the general notion that these taking questions ought

14

to be addressed in the context of the application of the sta­

15

tute to particular pieces of property rather than in the con­

16

text of the statute as a whole.

17

how the statute is going to be applied in a particular circum­

18

stance .

19

Because we just don't know

Now, I do want to say in connection with the taking

20

argument in the Indiana case just a little bit about this

21

high levels of management business that is emphasized by the

22

district court, and also in the briefs of appellees.

23

nothing in the statute that talks about high levels of manage­

24

ment so far as restoration of prime farmland to productivity

25

levels obtained at high levels of management.

There's

That's somethir g

1

that the district courts have injected into the case by saying

2

that we're going to define high levels of management as those

3

producing yields that are impossible to reach after surface

4

mining, and then concluding that the statute imposes an impos­

5

sible burden.

That's right.

Exactly.

And if, in the past, that level had been

1 1

a high level of management, then there's sense in what the

12

district court said, isn't there?

13

MR. BUSCEMI:

That's certainly true, Mr. Justice

Stewart.

and apart --

But my point is only that the standard is not

MR. BUSCEMI:

QUESTION:

20

MR. BUSCEMI:

21

QUESTION:

The equivalent level of management?
That's exactly right.

At the same level of management.
All it's saying is that --

But if the level anterior to the strip

22

mining has been a high level of management, then one must com­

23

pare what a high level of management would produce after the

24

strip mining.

25

Correct?

MR. BUSCEMI:

That's right.
9

There's the question

1

of reestablishing the yields that would be obtained before

2

the surface mining began.

3

QUESTION: With the same level of management?

4

MR.

BUSCEMI:

That's right.

And I think,

by the

5

way, as we mention in our brief on page 34, Note 20, the

6

testimony of one of the plaintiffs in this case was that land

7

can be restored to Its levels of productivity after surface

8

mining.

This is the same kind of problem that exists
Virginia case on the taking question.

The district

court in the Virginia case said that restoration' approximating

11

the contrary.

14

the contrary, it ignored the Pennsylvania and the Ohio

15

experience.

Well,

16

that just ignored the finding of Congress to
And it ignored the evidence in the record to

Now, finally, in connection with the taking argu­

17

ment, I just want to call the Court's attention to the

18

analogy here to the nuisance cases or the noxious use cases.

19

This is a -- surface mining creates much of the same kind of

20

effect.

21

without its disadvantages to the surrounding community.

22

Congress has found that there are many disadvantages.

23

in that respect it's very much like the brickyard in Hadacheck

24

or the cedar grove in Miller v.

25

Mugler.

This is not an economic enterprise that is totally

And

Schoene, or the brewery in

All of these things have their value; there's no
10

1

question about that.

2

the impact on the surrounding communities there is room for

3

regulation without a taking in the constitutional sense.

4

And I think that those cases are instructive in this context.
QUESTION:

But the Court has found that because of

That goes to the taking argument and not

Commerce Clause argument?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes, that's right.

That's what I

8

was -- I didn't reach that in the Virginia case and I did

9

want to address it briefly.

10

QUESTION:

I haven't read Mr. Conlon's letter in

1 1

full, but when he states that the coal industry is quite

12

capable, do you mean, is he saying it's physically possible

13

or economically feasible or both?

14

MR. BUSCEMI:

Mr. Chief Justice, I thought he was

15

saying both, and I could be corrected on that, but we did

16

quote the sentence in his -- on page 110 of the Appendix.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Yes, I have that before me.

Some parts

of it have an ambiguity in it.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, I think that the -- you know,

20

that letter Is instructive for another reason as well, because

21

it focuses on the debate that was in Congress with respect to

22

the prime farmlands.

23

was a recommendation from the Administration that surface

24

mining be banned, or at least that a moratorium be declared

25

on surface mining on prime farmlands.

When Congress considered this, there

11

And Congress decided

1

not to do that.

2

because its investigation indicated that the land could be

3

properly restored after surface mining was completed.

4

that's why Congress chose to act in the way it did, rather

5

than the way that the Administration had requested.

6

think Mr. Conlon's letter is addressed to the moratorium

7

possibility.
QUESTION:

8
9

And the reason it decided not to do it was

And

And I

As to the specific illustration he's

giving, it apparently -- he regards it as economically feasi­

10

11

as a general proposition.

it is not feasible.

don't yet know.

19

farmland has not been restored. But Congress at least thought

20

that it could be restored to the equivalent levels of yield

21

and thus far that has not been shown to be incorrect with

respect to any particular piece of land.

Certainly the Congress thought that it was

QUESTION:

Mr. Buscemi, could you help me on your

24

argument that the taking issue is raised prematurely and

25

we'd be better off to wait till a specific case arose involving a
12

1

specific parcel.

2

hypothetical case in which the issue might arise, because you

3

surely couldn't sue in the Court of Claims under the Tucker

4

Act till the property had been taken.

How does the -- at what point would a taking in a specific

7

future case -- you say we should wait for a future case.

8

Tell me how you think it could arise and what would be taken?

9

I have some difficulty in thinking of a

MR. BUSCEMI:

I don't suppose any
use his farm.

Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, I think

10

that perhaps the word premature implies a timing element

1 1

that's not the sole content of the argument.

12

saying really is that if a particular mine operator has inves

13

tigated the prospects for surface mining on his property and

14

has also investigated whatever variance procedures may be

15

available -- now if they're not, if they're not available --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. BUSCEMI:

What we're

Well, they're not, here.
-- on the prime farms -- I'm talking

18

of the Virginia case -- and if he's further investigated the

19

possibility of restoring the land and he's concluded on the

20

basis of all of that information that it is either impossible

21

or impractical,

22

no other beneficial uses of this land, then it may be appro­

23

priate for him to come and say that, well, my property has

24

been taken.

25

and moreover he's concluded that there are

MR. BUSCEMI:

They all have to restore the

Well, but I think the application of

the statute may well vary from place to place.
QUESTION:

It may be --

Well, the only variance I think of is

6

where the postmining use might be, say, an airport, where

7

you wouldn't want to farm on it.

But why couldn't he just

8

build the airport ahead of time?

Then we get back to the --

9

I don't see the hypothetical case of the taking, frankly.

10

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, I think, Mr. Justice Stevens,

11

that one of the critical inquiries that the Court engages in

12

when it looks to see whether there has been a taking is to

13

look at the other uses for the property.

14

talking merely about the focus on a particular piece of pro­

15

perty rather than on the mere enactment --

16

QUESTION:

And that's why we're

But is it not true that by hypothesis

17

every parcel we're talking about would be one that is being

18

used for farming immediately before the mining occurred?

19

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, at least that historically has

20

had this intensive agricultural cultivation. Whether in the

21

immediate year or two before mining,

22

necessarily the case.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. BUSCEMI:

25

I'm not sure that that's

I see.
Regardless of of what it's being used

for at the time, there may be other beneficial uses that are
14

1

available for that land.

2

v. Allard that

3

property rights, not just to a single strand.

4

turns out that this land is usable not only for farming but

5

also for an airport and also for any number of other things,

6

that may well color the way the Court will look at a taking

7

question focused solely on the operation of the Surface

8

Mining Act.

law to get out from under the burden of his bargain that he

had struck on an arm's length basis.

in Mahon that the Court disagreed with the general principle

I think that Mr. Justice Holmes' opinion for the Court

The Court was simply unwilling to allow

There was no suggestion

10

stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis in his dissent, which I believe

11

was joined by several other Members of the Court.
And finally, with respect to Mahon, I'm not at all

12
13

sure that the -- at least, as to the Section 522(e) of the

14

Act, which is also part of this taking problem, the valid

15

existing rights provision in 522(e) might well have obviated

16

the Mahon problem if it were to arise under the Act in con­

17

nection with one of the prohibitions in 522(e).

18

not true, of course, with respect to the prime farmlands,

19

because that's not subject to valid existing rights.

20

just do want to make that point.

Now, that's

But I

Finally, I do want to address just briefly the

21
22

Due Process Clause challenges here.

There are two of them.

23

The first one deals with the summary cessation order procedure

24

under 521(a)(2).

25

argument.

Now, again, we begin with the same kind of

No one in Indiana and perhaps one of the plaintiffs
16

1

In the Virginia case -- but that was not in the record at

2

trial -- but as far as we know from the record, certainly,

3

none of these people have ever been subjected to summary ces­

4

sation orders, or to the imposition of civil penalties.

5

we think that under those circumstances the due process

6

challenge is premature and that I mean in a real timing sense,

7

rather that as far as focusing on a particular case.

8

haven't had these things apply to these plaintiffs yet.

9

And

We just

In any event, we don't think that either the civil

10

penalty provisions in Section 518 or the summary cessation

1 1

orders deprive mine operators of due process.

12

that a cessation order will be issued in a summary fashion be­

13

fore there's notice given and an opportunity for abatement

14

Is when the inspector determines that there is a violation

15

of the Act or a violation of the permit condition that creates

16

an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public, or

17

is causing or can reasonably be expected to cause significant

18

imminent environmental harm to the land air or water resources .

19

The only time

Now, that standard, we suggest, is very similar

20

to standards that this

Court has already upheld for summary

21

administrative action.

And also other federal courts, such

22

as the Fourth Circuit, in Sink v. Mdrton, arose under the

23

Mine Safety and Health Act, but involves very similar standing.

24

25

Now,

of

course,

the

district court makes much of the fact

that some of these summary cessation orders may have been
17

1

issued to mine operators other than the plaintiffs erroneously

2

and in the first few months of the statute's effectiveness

3

I gather that there were a small number of erroneous summary

4

cessation orders.

6

Virginia case, was issued erroneously and It was reversed

And in the interim there is no indication

10

It was simply a question of whether they could dump spoil in

1 1

one area rather than another.

12

But, in any event, that's not the relevant inquiry,

13

Exactly.

A very powerful argument, is it?

I mean,

you're generally dealing with solvent people here.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, I think

5

that when the Congress had found that under the Mine Safety

6

and Health Act there was a substantial difficulty in col­

7

lecting civil penalties from mine operators, and I think

8

that that's what pushed Congress into enacting the statute.

9

I think that the Secretary in interpreting and applying the

10

statute has found that generally speaking mine operators who

1 1

are willing to seek administrative review at all are mine

12

operators who are willing to pay the penalties, if adminis­

13

interpreted -- a large part of the reason the Secretary has

2

not insisted on payment under 518, even to obtain review of

3

the fact of the violation, is that the biggest problem that

the Secretaries of Interior and Labor have had under these

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

Mr.

Kelly, at some convenient point in

your argument will you address the question of what remedies

8

if any individual landowners would have, assuming the

Government wins this case?

And assuming also an individual

13

overlooked.

14
15

MR. KELLY:

I just don't want it

Mr. Justice Powell, I will do that at

the end.

16

Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court:

17

I believe the Government has articulated the main

18

difference between the Indiana case and the Virginia case,

19

and that is that we encompass some 21 different or additional

20

subsections of the statute, and before getting into the Tenth

21

Amendment issue or the federalism issue I would like to go

22

into some further explanation of the various sections of the

23

statute that are involved under the Tenth Amendment as well

24

as the Commerce Clause.

25

We

have

divided

those into four basic groups,
22

1

and the first group would be the prime farmland provisions.

2

And I don't think at this point that there is any doubt about

3

the effect of the prime farmland provisions.

4

The

effects

of

the

prime

farmland

provisions,

5

quite simply, are that at the conclusion of taking the coal

6

out of the ground you've got to put everything back in, in

7

three separate layers, and that land has to be farmed, mini­

8

mally, for five years.

9

And as the district court in the

10

may even take 20 years of farming to get that land back to

11

the point of equivalent levels of yield under high levels of

12

management.
That term, high levels of management, as an

13
14

aside here, is found in the Act. "High levels of management"

15

were used by the Secretary. I don' t think there ' s any doubt about

16

where it comes from.

17

sions were intended by Congress to require a farming use and

18

allowed no other uses, no other variances.

19

by at least three Senators on the floor of the Senate at the

20

time it was introduced.

21

in the terms, we don't want any state bureaucrat to have the

22

discretion to allow some other land use.

As a matter of fact, it was expressed

And that's how it was put in the Act, and

Federal Government.

2

Now, the Government has said that this is the regu­

3

lation of private activity.

4

thrust goes far beyond private activity.

5

into land use.

6

issue, at least, the initial question that must be decided is,

7

what is land use planning and activity insofar as the state

8

is concerned and in relationship to National League of Cities,

9

that's been heretofore decided?

But it seems to me that the
It goes directly

And I think that under the Tenth Amendment

And to me, I think National

10

League of Cities was the beginning, at least, of defining

11

what is an area of sovereignty in which the Federal Govern­

12

ment cannot intrude that's going to be held to the states?

13

And it also started to state what it's not going to be.

14

And quite candidly with the Court, I don't think I

15

can say that land use planning is wholly a governmental ser­

16

vice, if you will, but I can certainly say it is not simply

17

the regulation of private activities relating directly to

18

Commerce.

19

QUESTION:

National League of Cities depended upon

20

the fact that the subjects of the regulation were themselves

21

states, did it not?

22

that Indiana or its subsidiary municipal corporations own

23

prime farmland?

24
25

MR. KELLY:

Is it the contention of Indiana here

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, far be it from

me to say precisely what was said in there, but I think there

24

1

were two things that were important to the Court in NLC.

2

I think the first thing that was important was that there

3

was a direct command speaking to the state.

4

second thing that was important was what it spoke about,

5

and maybe what it spoke about was more important than that it

6

actually did speak to the state.

7

planning, if we are to make a comparison to the second

8

tier, if you will, of National League of Cities, I think it's

9

much more akin to that than anything else.

I think the

And I think land use

I think land use

10

planning and control involves matters that transcend mere

1 1

economics and commerce.

12

community's going to be like.

13

said it on many different occasions, land use planning is an

14

instrument to create a quality of life and a character within

15

a community.

16

It goes to the very heart of what a
And I think this Court has

Now, if this power -- of the states, if you will;

17

it's used to do that -- it seems to me

18

services that were relied upon, at least in part, in National

19

League of Cities to get the Court to where it got.

20

is

equal to the

Now, to carry it one step further, I think within

21

the Tenth Amendment there is room -- and I think it is in the

22

intent, if you will, of the framers -- that the states not

23

only were to be a government to give governmental services.

24

The states -- if a state’is going to be a government, it has

25

to have something more than the right to have employees to
25

1

run police departments and schools and hospitals.

2

I believe, must have some independent sphere of governance.

3

A state,

I can't say that that is precisely what National

4

League of Cities said, but I think, if our constitutional

5

framework is to make any sense whatsoever, if the states are

6

to govern, if they're to have some degree of independence,

7

there must be then some independent sphere of government,

8

or governance, if you will.

9

I think the only real question remaining after

10

National League of Cities would be, how is that to be defined,

1 1

where are we to go with that?

12

like land use planning comes before the Court and it has the

13

attributes that land

14

concerns matters that are so peculiar to each given community

15

they can only be determined by looking at a wide diversity of

16

climate, geography, geology, preferences, and character.

17

And when you are required to come to different policies based

18

on these peculiar matters that are so centra] locally, I think

19

that may well qualify as an independent sphere of governance.

20

And I think that once an area

use planning does, and that is that it

I think as Chief Justice Burger's question at the

21

outset, as to what does the Tenth Amendment mean, I think it

22

has to mean that there is some sphere of governance left to

23

the states.

24

planning and control.

25

tion is resolved, I think the next problem is, where do we

And I think part of that has to be land use
And I think once that issue and ques­

26

1

go from there?

Because we admit, in the State of Indiana,

2

and the coal companies admit, that there is in fact areas,

3

possibly, where land use planning might become tangentially in­

4

volved.

5

separate and apart from the power of the Federal Government.

We cannot take the position that it is always

6

And we would propose that if this is a central right,

7

if you will, under the first ten Amendments, that the Court

8

simply go into the weighing and balancing process that it has

9

gone into in making these types of determinations in other

10

Amendment cases.

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Kelly, let me push you with a ques­

12

tion on it.

13

disposal, could the Federal Government regulate the kinds of

14

land in which the nuclear waste may be deposited, and so

15

forth?

Supposing we had the problem of nuclear waste

You can't dump it in a lake, or something like that?

16

MR. KELLY:

Well, I would certainly think that to

17

the extent that nuclear waste had a potential for an inter­

18

state spillover effect, from one state to another, that this

19

might be an area where the federal interest might indeed be

20

permanent.

21

QUESTION:

Well, supposing Congress found in the

22

coal area that there's an interstate spillover?

23

aren't very persuasive, I realize; you've done a very good jot

24

on that.

25

The facts

But supposing they had found that they wanted to

27

1

agricultural uses?

And that would have an interstate spill­

2

over because the agricultural market is essentially an inter­

3

state market.
MR. KELLY:

4

Well, I think even if there is a com­

5

pelling national interest here, at least under the Fourteenth

6

Amendment cases where you have a suspect class, there is still

7

the next level of inquiry, and that is, is there a less in­

8

trusive means of doing this?

9

paramount national interest in the sense of the Fourteenth

In other words, just finding a

10

Amendment cases, as I would understand it, is not sufficient.

11

The Court would then have to focus on the nature and the means

12

that the Federal Government did use.
QUESTION:

13

In other words, your land use planning

14

exception, or land use control, is something that the Federal

15

Government can invade only when there is no less intrusive

16

means of doing it?

17

lute line?
MR. KELLY:

18

It's that kind of -- rather than an abso­

I think so, Mr. Justice; yes.

Defi­

19

nitely.

I don't think there are any absolute lines, and I

20

think that's why I'm suggesting that the Court may want to

21

go into a Fourteenth Amendment type of analysis.

22

does this in other Commerce Clause situations where the

23

Federal Government has not stepped in with regulations and a

24

state has stepped in and is regulated, in order to determine

25

whether or not that's an undue burden on interstate commerce.
28

I think it

1

The Court looks to the policy that the state is pursuing when

2

it does come into that area, and it balances whether or not

3

the benefits of the state policy are out of proportion or in

4

proportion to the burdens on interstate commerce that are

5

created by it.

6

ing is anything that's unfamiliar;to this Court in the past,

7

and in fact, I think it's very consistent with it.

8

So I don't think the test that we're suggest­

And insofar as weighing these facts, I would like

9

to go for a minute to the specific facts of the effects on the:

10

State of Indiana with regard to the prime farmland ■provisions.

11

I think -- and I don't think there's any doubt about where

12

they came from -- I think the prime farmland provisions came

13

from land use policies, a land use conflict, if you will, in

14

the State of Illinois.

State of Indiana was not -- and I repeat, not contributing to

the interstate spillover.

20

21

QUESTION:

Well, in past years there's been a good

deal of surface mining in the State of Illinois.

22

MR. KELLY:

There certainly has, Your Honor.

There

23

has, but insofar as surface mining in Illinois is concerned,

24

only about 50 percent of their coal is produced by surface

25

mining.

Fifty percent is produced by underground mining.
30

QUESTION:

1

Well, of course, statistically that

doesn't mean anything.

Indiana has.
MR. KELLY:

They may have a lot more coal than

I use that for the split, Your Honor,

5

in terms of the fact that 50 percent of their present produc­

tion is mined by underground coal, the underground method.

In Indiana less than one percent is mined by the underground

8

method.

9

QUESTION:

And I say those statistics don't really

10

mean very much unless they're taken in the context of the

11

total production in each state.

12

MR. KELLY:

Go ahead.

I think also attention needs to be

13

focused upon Section 522 and the attempt by the Federal

14

Government to force the states to zone land as unsuitable for

15

surface mining.

16

of any relationship whatsoever of the zoning of land as being

17

unsuitable for surface mining and its connection to inter­

18

state commerce.

19

there is any connection whatsoever.

20

I have a very, very difficult time conceiving

Try as I might, I find it inconceivable that

Insofar as 522(e) and -(4) are concerned, they

don't deal with surface mining of coal.

They deal with

surface mining operations.

5

It had to

There is no tangential or even indirect effect on

commerce that's protected by anything within Section 522.

7

And insofar as the approximate

8

is concerned, with respect to the Commerce Clause, we cannot

9

find, I could not find, the district court could not find

10

anything within the entire history of this Act before the

1 1

Senate that would relate approximate original contour to any

12

adverse effect on interstate commerce, even if we went to

13

water pollution.

All of the justification, all of the justification

15

mentioned by the Senate, the House, went to water pollution

on steep slopes and mountain tops.

do with water pollution on flat land. And in Indiana we have

18

areas that are not flat but they aren't steep slope.

13

It may not even be the Federal Govern­

It may be the State of Indiana.
And insofar as the question of the timeliness of the

14

remedy is concerned, I would suggest to the Court that if the

15

states who I believe and as the Indiana Legislature so found

16

-- which is entitled to some degree of presumption of ration­

17

ality -- it is being coerced into enacting these provisions

18

-- I think this Court would, ought to be concerned with whe­

19

ther this is going to be a taking and the state's going to

20

have to pay for it.

21

not they want to enact 522 or the prime farmland provisions

22

when they don't know whether it's going to cost them $1 or

How can the states evaluate whether or

So, I would suggest to the Court that there is
strong public policy behind proceedings with a decision of

some of them have enacted statutes; they're submitting pro­

grams; they need to know.

with respect to the prime farmland that it presents an uncon­

QUESTION:

So therefore we couldn't mine the coal.
Does that apply to all of the surface

mining, or just the certain parcels of land, or how widespreac

is this defect in the statute?

24

MR. KELLY:

25

Insofar as surface mining in Indiana is

concerned, we have -- and I think it's in Exhibit Three,

mineable reserves and the extent of the prime farmland.

Now, that shows it to be fairly extensive.

quite obvious in terms of the lack of the land use concept in

I guess that's -- I guess I would state

that I have no -- that this, I just can't do it, and if the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER 'BUSCEMI, ESQ. ,

19

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS -- REBUTTAL

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Buscemi, do you agree that the

21

Tucker Act will be available to a private landowner who

22

claims a taking?

23

MR. BUSCEMI:

I certainly agree, Mr. Justice Powell

24

that a private landowner who claims a taking can bring a

25

Tucker Act suit in the Court of Claims.
40

Now, whether the

1

2
3

Court of Claims will find that the Tucker Act jurisdiction
was intended to permit recovery on the basis of a regulatory
statute like this, or as Mr. Justice Rehnquist called earlier,

4

inverse condemnation, I'm not certain.

I don't know whether

5

the Tucker Act jurisdiction has ever been invoked in a case

6

like that and has resulted in a monetary recovery.
As I say, in the Eastport Shipping case that we've

7

8

cited, the Court of Claims, I think, expressed some misgiv­

9

ings about that.

I don't know what the

court would do if

10

it were faced with the question, but I think that Mr. Justice

1 1

White's question to opposing counsel just now indicates what

12

the Government would see as the way in which this kind of

13

issue can be appropriately resolved, and that is if an indi­

14

vidual mine operator or prospective mine operator or landowner

15

applies for a permit to mine a certain kind of land, and he

16

maintains that he just does not have the capability to restore

17

it to its equivalent levels of yield -QUESTION:

18

Or he does his best to prove to the

19

Government and the Government says, you've failed to prove it,

20

no permit.

21

22
23

MR. BUSCEMI:

Or he does his best and the Government

says he failed.
QUESTION:

But in deciding this case, should we

24

assume that there may be an opportunity to litigate in the

25

event a private owner thinks his property has been taken?
41

MR. BUSCEMI:

1

I think, Mr1. Justice Powell, that you

2

can certainly assume that one of two things available to a

3

private owner, if he can establish that his property has been

4

taken:

5

remedy under the Tucker Act for money damages, or that at

6

least with respect to a particular piece of property, that

7

there is a district court equitable remedy available in the

8

form of an injunction under the statute as applied to that

9

statute, and that's the problem that we encounter in this case.

10
1 1

12

you can assume either that there is a Court of Claims

QUESTION:

Well, what happens In that case if he

doesn't want an injunction, he wants damages?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, I think that right now, at

13

least, we're confronted with plaintiffs who would be very

14

happy with an injunction.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BUSCEMI:

That's exactly what they want.

Because then they can mine the coal?
That's right.

And that's presumably

17

all that they want. So I think that that's how we would envi­

18

sion the thing working.

19

QUESTION:

Do you concede that if there are, say, ir

20

95 percent of the cases the statute works fine, but five per­

21

cent of the cases they can prove they couldn't restore the

22

land to the original condition.

23

would establish a taking?

24

MR. BUSCEMI:

25

QUESTION:

Do you concede that that

Absolutely not.

But —

But -- so you'd say, they don't have
42

1

a remedy either?
MR. BUSCEMI:

2

Well, I would say that they would not

3

win on the merits, but Mr. Justice Powell's question, I

4

thought, was what do
QUESTION:

5

they do and how do they go about it.
Why wouldn't they win on the merits, if

6

they could prove that in five percent of the cases it would

7

just be impossible to restore this land.

8

says, well, we agree with you, but Mr. Buscemi here says that

9

wouldn't be a taking.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, I think that that statement is

correct under this Court's decisions.

16

would be the case, if they --

MR.

BUSCEMI:

The Commerce Clause question, as I

say, I will give essentially the same answer that I gave you

17

earlier, and that is that Congress would' have'to find'that

18

that was a reasonable measure under the Commerce Clause.

19

I think that my answer is that under the circumstances, and

20

what we already have seen in the legislative record, that

21

probably would be defended under the Commerce Clause.

22

all, the very task force report that plaintiffs rely on and

23

the district court relied on has established'> that 21 million

24

acres of prime farmland is subject to surface mining.

QUESTION: Mr. Buscemi, in Virginia, in southwest
Virginia where there are only steep hills but no farmland or
very little farmland, the district judge in the Virginia case
found that in many instances the land had no value whatever
under the administration of this Act, so that could conceiv­
ably be different from land in another state where an indi­
vidual or a company owned both the surface and the mineral
rights.

15
16
17

He could continue to farm that land.
MR. BUSCEMI:

13
14

If the compensa­

tion were available, there would be no equitable relief.

My hesitation is only because I do not know of any

That's correct.

The Virginia situa­

tion -QUESTION:

In Virginia you could own a mountainside

that had no utility in the world other than to strip mine.
MR. BUSCEMI:

That's correct. The Virginia situa­

18

tion may well present different geographical characteristics

19

but I should also point out, Mr. Justice Powell, that the

20

district court also found that if some of that land was

21

leveled off Into benches, it went up to $300,000 an acre.

22

So, I mean, there's a little bit of inconsistency there.
