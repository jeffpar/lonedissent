MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
in Dennis v. Sparks and Lynd.

Mr. Edmonds, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FINLEY L. EDMONDS

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. EDMONDS:

7

8
9

We'll hear arguments next

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The points that petitioner feels are presented to the

10

Court on this petition for certiorari have to do with the

1 1

question of whether a state court judge acting within the

12

scope of his jurisdiction is a person as that term or word is

13

used in Section 1983.

14

Petitioner submits that the resolution of that ques­

15

tion depends in great part upon the scope of judicial immunity

16

as that concept is applied by this Court.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. EDMONDS:

19

20
21

22
23
24

Isn't immunity an affirmative defense?
Judicial immunity, Your Honor,

Petitioner submits, is more than an affirmative defense.
QUESTION:

You mean it has a little bit of jurisdic­

tion on it?
MR. EDMONDS:

Your Honor, in examining the develop­

ment of judicial immunity, it seems that an argument can be
made that it's in the rationale behind judicial immunity,
the public interest to be served by judicial immunity. That

25

3

1

t'o put it in terras that is judicial immunity an affirmative

2

de:fense raises

3

raise the offense?

4

the question what if the judge who sued doesn't

QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting that it's com­

5

parable to, analogous to the posture of a United States

6

Senator under the Speech or Debate Clause, that he may not be

7

questioned in any other place?

8
9

MR. EDMONDS:

I'm saying, yes, that it's analogous

to legislative immunity, congressional immunity under the

10

Speech or Debate Clause if the judge, if the purpose for ques­

11

tioning the judge or for suing the judge is because of his

12

act or conduct while a judge, acting within his jurisdiction.

13
14

QUESTION:

But we don't have a speech or debate

clause typed for judges, do we?

15

MR. EDMONDS:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. EDMONDS:

No, Your Honor.

That's a judicially constructive concept.
It's a common law of construction; yes,

18

Your Honor.

19

going back to Bradley v. Fisher and throw out the cases that

20

have been cited by this Court:

21

in the Consumer Union case.

22
23
24

25

And if the scope of judicial immunity, just

Pierson, Embler, more recently

The analysis of legislative immunity, the analysis
of judicial immunity, that if the public interest or rationale
behind this immunity is to free the

judge

from the intimi­

dation, harassment, et cetera, as the Court has many times
4

1

discussed in these cases.

2

rhetorically does not the rationale require that judicial

3

immunity apply regardless of whether the judge raises it as a

4

defense?

5

I would say that it's more than an affirmative defense, as

6

would be a qualified immunity whereon a state officer or a

7

federal officer is asserting that he is immune because of his

8

good faith carrying out of discretionary functions.

So, in answer to your question, Judge Rehnquist,

QUESTION:

9

If that is the rationale, then

So

what if the judge is served with

10

a complaint in an action such as this and simply lets the time

1 1

for answer go by and a default judgment is taken against him?

12

Would you say that that judgment is no good?

13

MR. EDMONDS:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

19

20
21

Or he answers and litigates the case

without ever raising the claim that judgment is against him.
Is that judgment good?
MR. EDMONDS:

17

18

Or he answers — yes.

Petitioner's position is that judi­

cial immunity, that the:public interest behind judicial
immunity is that it's not in the judge's discretion to raise
the question of judicial immunity.

It's the adjudicating

court's function to apply, it's a matter of jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

22

So, even if he said I want to answer this

on the merits and clear my name of these allegations in the
23

complaint he would not be permitted to do so under your
24

theory?
25

5

MR. EDMONDS:

1

Your Honor, my response to that is

2

does that not raise the question, or beg the issue, about the

3

underlying rationale for the immunity?

4

to decide whether he wants to respond or not, or is it in

5

the public interest that he not respond?

6

that place a judge -QUESTION:

7

Is it up to the judge

Because how does

As you say, on your submission, it's

8

a matter almost of jurisdiction.

9

MR. EDMONDS:

Yes, Your Honor.

Because if one judge

10

agrees that, okay, I will participate in this lawsuit, I

1 1

won't raise my affirmative defense of judicial immunity, and

12

I'll go in there and we'll straighten this thing out, well,

13
14

what about all the other judges?
interest behindjudicial immunity?
QUESTION:

15
16

MR. EDMONDS:
QUESTION:

18

20

21

What could you do about it?

What could

you or anybody else do about it?

17

19

What about the public

What can my client do about it?

What could you or anybody else do if a

judgment was obtained against Judge Joe Bloke who never told
anybody that he was a judge and never raised a question?
Now, what could anybody do about it?
MR. EDMONDS:

22

Nothing.

Well, Your Honor, they know he was a

judge.
23

QUESTION:

But he says that it's not jurisdictional.

24

MR. EDMONDS:

If he came to me and was sued for

25

6

1

conduct while not carrying out his judicial function, I would

2

agree.

3

his judicial function, we know he's a judge.

But in case he's being sued because of carrying out

QUESTION:

4

5

if you'd

6

what would happen?

QUESTION:

13
14

17

I would say that the public interest

requires that the reviewing court apply judicial immunity and
say that this judge is immune because he was acting as a judge
when he did what he is alleged to have done.
QUESTION:

Let's assume -- can't we start with an

assumption that this judge is immune and go on to your client
who is not a judge, is he?
MR. EDMONDS:

18
19

For just what he did here, and you didn't

Then it's not jurisdictional-- In fact,

That's right, Your Honor.

He's not a

And how can my client raise the -QUESTION:

20

— vicarious exemption, if it is an

exemption?
21

MR. EDMONDS:

Right.

My client's position is that

22

like the Barra v. Jackson case that involved the defendant who
23

had sold property in violation of a restrictive covenant to
24

folks of another race,

the question was, could that defendant

25

7

1

raise the constitutionality of that restrictive covenant as it

2

had applied to the other race, assuming the defendant sold?

3

And this Court held, yes.

4

In Griswold v. Connecticut, there the physician had

5

been convicted of the crime of an accessory and an accomplice

6

to third parties having to do with the state's ban on contra­

7

ceptives.

8

to raise the constitutionality argument that was more

9

directly applicable to the third party -- he's the person for

And this Court held that the physician had standing

whom the physician had treated.

QUESTION:

That's a matter of -- those cases really

MR. EDMONDS:

14

QUESTION:

15

17

18
19

20
21

22

Yes, Your Honor.

-- and as one person has the interest

through the rights of jus tertii, the rights of a third person.
Is that what this is, a standing case, kind of?
MR. EDMONDS:

Well, no, no.

I think they're applicable.

Not exactly.

I mention those because

I was thinking, I guess, of the

question raised by the amicus, one of the amicus in the case,
questioning our ability to raise the judge's immunity because
we're not a judge.

We were sued by the plaintiffs for partici­

pating in a state judicial function and -- well, our first
point about the definition of person, the scope of judicial

23

immunity, this to me logically turns in, goes into the ques­
24

tion about was it congressional intent back in 1866 and again
25

8

1

in 1871 and with subsequent amendments to the various civil

2

rights acts, specifically this Act, 1983.

3

intent to superimpose federal court oversight or federal court

4

jurisdiction over the litigation among parties of private

5

rights in the state court authorities?

6

Is it congressional

Here we don't have a case of Mr. Dennis and the other1

7

parties mugging the respondent on a highway.

8

here is, the other parties are not before the Court right now

9

having gone to state court, having filed a suit in state court,

What we've got

10

a temporary injunction having been entered by Judge Carrillo,

1 1

and that temporary injunction being dissolved in the ordinary

12

course of events in the state proceedings by the Court of

13

Appeals.

14

QUESTION:

What would be your analysis if the United

15

States -- a member of the United States Congress, House or

16

Senate, was involved in a conspiracy with a private citizen

17

and then the private citizen is a defendant, but not the

18

Member of Congress?

19

could carry over to the coconspirator who was not protected by

20

the Speech or Debate Clause directly?

Do you think the Speech or Debate Clause

21

MR. EDMONDS:

22

QUESTION:

23

My answer is yes, Your Honor.

I must say that here because if it isn't

true there it couldn't possibly be true here, could it be?

24

MR. EDMONDS:

25

QUESTION:

I tend to agree with Your Honor.

Something like pendent immunity.
9

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. EDMONDS:

Vicarious immunity is -I am very reluctant to get into the

3

area of using the terms of immunity, I suppose.

4

that Mr. Dennis had an immunity at common law. I can't say that

5

he had any of the immunities that this Court has held were

6

not abrogated by Congress when they passed the civil rights

7

statute we're dealing with.

8

lic interest, the rationale, the logic behind judicial immunity

9

requires this result.

10

I can't say

However, I am saying that the pub­

And if we want to call it "vicarious"

or "pendent" or "derivative," so be it.

1 1

QUESTION:

Why does the rationale require it?

12

MR. EDMONDS:

The rationale requires it, as pointed

13

out by the dissent in the en banc decision before the 5th

14

Circuit.

15

because —

And it's pointed out by others.

MR. EDMONDS:

It requires it

The judge is home free?
The judge is home free, but to allow

answer has to be almost rhetorical.

To allow prosecution of a

the private citizen even liable under 1983?

got to have a conspiracy with the judge.

So we've

So the judge is in­

volved, the judge's interest is involved because of the liti­
gation against a private person.
10

The case is necessarily going

1

to involve whether there was a conspiracy with this judge, ever

2

though he's immune, even though he can't'-be made to partici­

3

pate, even though he can't be made to testify.

4

QUESTION:

Who said he couldn't testify?

5

QUESTION:

Why can't he be made to testify or is

6

that what you said?

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. EDMONDS:

9

Your Honor.

Where -- what case holds that?
There is no case that holds that,

It's petitioner's construction that the concept

10

of judicial immunity requires that the judge not participate,

11

just as this Court recently held -QUESTION:

12

Well, what about -- no, no, a judge isn't

13

immune from criminal indictment on grounds of official immun­

14

ity.
MR. EDMONDS:

15
16

18

QUESTION:

Yes, this judge is in jail, isn't he?
But not for this, Your Honor.

Has Manges been prosecuted?

MR. EDMONDS:

21

25

Incidentally, has he been prosecuted?

QUESTION:

20

24

QUESTION:

MR. EDMONDS:

19

23

Your Honor, but

this is a civil case.

17

22

That's quite true,

To my knowledge he has not been pro­

secuted in a state district court for misconduct.

He was

removed from his office because of conduct including mis-1
conduct.

Again —
QUESTION:

But he hasn't been prosecuted criminally?
11

1

Do you know why not?

2

MR. EDMONDS:

3

QUESTION:

4

5

6
7

8
9

10
11

12

No, I don't, Your Honor.

You're suggesting this judge couldn't

be called as a witness against his coconspirators?
MR. EDMONDS:
QUESTION:

Well, I'm suggesting that if we say --

He might not even -- all right, go ahead.

MR. EDMONDS:

Well, if we say that public interest

requires that judges not be subjected to a pleading contest
that can be brought about by any dissatisfied litigant in any
state court action, that -- to say that, okay, immunity means
that you can't -- that he's entitled to dismissal as a party
and Immunity means that you can't get -QUESTION:

Well then, immunity for these people

13

isn't required, then, to implement any of the policies of
14

giving judges immunity.

They can't be bothered for anything.

15

If they can't be called as witnesses, then why do you need to
16

give their coconspirators immunity just to protect the judge,
17

if the judge is already protected by

from being called as

18

a witness or dragged through cases?

I thought your argument

19

would be that if you didn't give these people immunity the
20

judge could be called as a witness, and would be involved in
21

this case -- if you take him away from his judicial duties and
22

have his motives questioned?
23

QUESTION:

I thought so too.

It brought to my mind

24

the controversy between Jefferson and Burr, when -- and when
25

12

-

-

1

John Marshall was sitting in the treason trial and tried to

2

get Jefferson to appear as a witness.

3

it by Jefferson simply furnishing papers, and Jefferson's

4

response was if the President could be subpoenaed from one

5

court to another, he can be prevented from doing his presi­

6

dential business.

7

can't even be subpoenaed to testify, it seems to me there's

8

no reason in the policy that Justice White has mentioned, to

9

say that the coconspirators share his immunity.
QUESTION:

10

And I think they settled

But if you say he can't -- that the judge

Between the Burr case and one more recent

11

case, the Courts have held that even the President must respond

12

and be a witness if necessary.
MR. EDMONDS:

13
14

though, was it not, Your Honor?
QUESTION:

15
16

17

20

21
22
23
24

It happened to be.

But if there were

several actions that followed before she arrived, it would
seem clear that they would have to come as witnesses.
MR. EDMONDS:

18
19

Again, that was a criminal action

Well,

Petitioner

is arguing that

there is a distinction between the scope of judicial immunity
in

a civil action, and the scope in a criminal action.
QUESTION:

Well --

MR. EDMONDS:

I think there are other state or public

interests that are floating in that scheme of things; the
rationale behind the protections of the system of prosecutors
and grand juries and indictments and the state itself, but when

25
-

13

-

1

you get to the civil action area under Section 1983, you're

2

talking about enforcement, about albeit harassment of judges

3

by private persons, the same constitutional or statutory safe­

4

guards don't apply.

5

that I think is resolved by differing public policy interests.
QUESTION:

6
7

8

attempts ?
MR. EDMONDS:
QUESTION:

10

12

action?

Yes, Your Honor.

And no immunity claim would defeat that

You're asking the federal court to grant a broader

immunity than the state courts of Texas grant, is that right?
MR. EDMONDS:

13
14

Mr. Edmonds, would there be a state law

civil remedy against your clients for the alleged bribery

9

11

But I do agree there is a conflict there

There would be judicial immunity,

with respect to a civil action, for the bribery. With respect
to a criminal prosecution for the bribery, there would not be.

15

QUESTION:

No, I'm asking about a damage remedy

16

brought by the Plaintiffs in this case against the non-judicial
17

Defendants in this case, making the same, allegations that are
18

made here.
19

MR. EDMONDS:

There is a damage remedy, and that

20

remedy is being pursued by the Respondent in the form of a
21

wrongful injunction suit.

Under Texas law, the dissolution of

22

an injunction creates the cause of action for the wrongful
23

injunction.

But in that case, the motives of the judge, in

24

entering the injunction, is not a critical or a turning factor.
25
-

14

-

1

But here, we're talking about how do you get to the private

2

citizen under 1983?

3

spiracy with the state actor; in this case it's a judge.
QUESTION:

4

5

You get to him only because of a con­

Is the judge liable under Texas law,

under the wrongful injunction action?
MR. EDMONDS:

6

No.

No, only the -- Mr. Manges,

7

who was the party that got the injunction, and my client's

8

liability would be limited solely to the bond that he signed.
QUESTION:

9

10

1 1

12

bond, is there a tort action in Texas available -- in a
matter of common law for bribing a judge -- to harm you in
some way?
MR. EDMONDS:

13
14

15

So that apart from that action on the

question, Your Honor.

I don't know the answer to that
If I may, I'd like to reserve the

balance of my time for rebuttal, if that please the Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

16

Very well.

Mr. Smith.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARLAND F. SMITH

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
18

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

19

Court, the question, I think, is pretty well before the Court.
20

The question is whether or not the private individuals who do
21

conspire

with a state judge and do cause the state judge to

22

enter the bench and enter unlawful orders that result in
23

damage to the claim -- do they automatically derive immunity
24

for their wrongdoing simply because the judge is, himself,
25

15

-

-

1

immune?
Now, this case, of course, is before Your Honors

2
3

as -- on the pleadings, on a motion to dismiss, and the

4

pleadings, of course, have to be taken as true.

5

6
7

8
9

10
11

12

13

But we would

point out to the Court that there's nothing in these pleadings,
in this case, that has not already been adjudicated in the
state of Texas.

The bribery was adjudicated, on a motion to

disqualify Judge Carrillo.

The comments of the judge, after

both parties had rested is included and attached to our plead­
ings, which is in the Appendix.

And the Order that the judge

entered, holding that the judge was disqualified because the
transactions between the judge and Mr. Manges amounted to a
disqualifying situation -- that's been decided.
Now, Judge Carrillo has, subsequently, been impeached

14

by the Texas legislature. The House included

the transactions

15

involved in the disqualification matter as one of the articles
16

of impeachment -- there were 12 articles, but this is only one
17

of them.

He was convicted by the Texas Senate and removed

18

from office for corruption, various items.

He was later tried

19

and convicted in federal court for tax fraud.

Thereafter, he

20

was tried and convicted in the Texas state courts for theft.
21

Now we are not here on a jailhouse-type pleading that's
22

accusing an honorable judge and trying to besmirch the char­
23

acter of an honorable judge who simply made an error in one
24

of his rulings.

QUESTION:

Of course, one of the reasons for the

immunity doctrine is that it's awfully hard to separate out,
you know, before you go to trial and appeal, and so forth, the
honorable judge who made a mistake in his ruling and the
corrupt judge who's been jailed for theft.
HR. SMITH:

I think Learned Hand addressed that

question in one of his decisions.

He said that if you could

determine that, then it would be monstrous not to allow relief.
Now, in this case, that determination has been made;
we're not before you -QUESTION:

But it wasn't made at the time you filed

your 1983 action, was it?
12

MR. SMITH:

Oh yes.

It was made then.

Now, at the

13

time the wrongful injunction was issued, the attorneys who
14

represented the Respondents in that case

which was not our

15

firm -- the attorneys who represented the Respondents in that
16

case did not know of the bribery.

The bribery itself was not

17

determined until May the 20th, 1973.

But the judge who made

18

the determination said that because of the bribery, the judge
19

was disqualified as of February 1, 1971.

Now, the wrongful

20

injunction came after that date, so the wrongful injunction
21

came after the judge had accepted the bribe and after he was
22

disqualified because of it.
23

QUESTION:

that the

policies of judicial immunity required immunity for private
parties.
MR. SMITH:

Well those cases, I say, were not really

thought through very much; they weren't presented very well,
they were mostly pro se cases, and the court took an easy way
out to get rid of frivolous cases.
QUESTION:

Well, what happened to the -- in this --

in this case, Mr. Smith, before any of the Texas proceedings
17

had taken place, your client filed his 1983 action and the
18

judge was asked to give a deposition and said he had cases set
19

for all week and all the next week, and your client said well,
20

I planned that the deposition is going to last at least two
21

weeks so you had better adjourn that calendar.

And the federal

22

judge said you're going to have to participate in these depo­
23

sitions and if it takes two weeks, it takes two weeks.
24

MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, Number one, judges are

25
-

21

-

1

amenable to subpoena and to testimony in Texas, and we haven't

2

had any problem with it in Texas.

3

ample opportunity for any witness to be protected from harass­

4

ment, and that would certainly be doubly true with respect to

5

judges.

Now, that's number one.

QUESTION:

But certainly the Fifth Circuit en banc

opinion would include many cases in which you did need the
testimony of the judge?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, I would say that they discussed that

question and they said the inconvenience to the judges would
be relatively insignificant, when you compare the disadvantages
of not having this ruse -- of allowing derivative immunity.

15

So, that's the way they disposed of it.
16

QUESTION:

Are there not many situations in which a

17

sitting judge might be subpoenaed and required to spend time
18

in Court as a witness, either to an automobile accident or to
19

a rule that he had drawn when he was in private practice, or
20

even when he was on the bench ruling?
21

MR. SMITH:

The fact that he's a judge doesn't mean

that he's not a citizen of the United States, and has an obli­
gation to his citizenship.

If he has knowledge of crime or

anything else that's been committed that -- and he's the only

His immunity is a narrow immunity relating

QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

That’s right.
-- his judicial functions.
It's just designed to protect the

integrity of the Court.

Now when you get down to what the

immunity really is after, the end is integrity.
Now independence is only the means -- now, it's an
important means; if the judge is not independent he possibly
cannot be entirely fair and impartial and free in his decisions
But if he uses his independence as a means of aiding corruption

12

as happened in this case, then to say that you exalt

the

13

independence of the judge over and above and make it more
14

important than integrity, then you are reversing the whole
15

application.

Now --

16

QUESTION:

Well that argument would remind that

17

concept of judicial immunity.
18

MR. SMITH:

That -- it would, yes, but the doctrine

19

of judicial immunity is the law.

But if we are free to pro­

20

ceed against those who conspire with the judge and those who
21

corrupted him, they are not completely left out in the cold.
Now, the -- I don't think anyone argues that the
doctrine of judicial immunity is justified on any basis except
to preserve an independent judiciary and the integrity of the

you contend, will it allow frivolous lawsuits?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, I think the answer to that

is, there is no way you can keep frivolous lawsuits from being
filed in any field.
QUESTION:

Well one way is to decide that the Court

of Appeals was mistaken in this case.
MR. SMITH:

Now I think the Seventh Circuit, in the

McFarland case, probably has laid the groundwork for the proper
15
16

rule to take care of that.
You're going to have frivolous lawsuits unless you

17

have rules of procedure that can take care of them.

Now that

18

question, really, is not reached in this case.

I think you're

19

going to have to have some stringent rules on a case of this

kind, and the Seventh Circuit has said so.

And we have pled

our case, specifically, and in great particularity, so that it

the judge and then he, in turn, turns around and sues the

is that the 1983 didn't really function until about the last
twenty years, and:it's —

Well of course that's

He may be an immune person but he's

we're

But the rule for which you contend could

17

MR. SMITH:

The answer to that, Your Honor, is

simple.

Corruption isn't restricted to DuVal County, Texas.

19

I read in the paper the other day that some judge up in Ohio
20

I believe, had been removed from office.

The corruption they

in that case looked like it was just as bad as DuVal

MR. SMITH:

MR. SMITH:

My opinion is that there hasn't been

enough case law on it to answer the question.
QUESTION:

For damage -- is it absolute immunity,

like, similar to what has been announced in 1983 suits?

15
16

Yes sir.

I think it's --

But to the extent there is, the judges

are immune?
MR. SMITH:

I would guess that the Texas courts will

come down pretty much the same way you have here.

Well what about, you haven't had any

21

third-party cases then?

MR. SMITH:

Oh no, no.

Now derivative immunity did not exist in common

All right, so that you really -- so that

MR. SMITH:

I have had

numerous Law Review articles

17

18

and I have seen the quotation in cases and in briefs and so
forth, that there was no derivative immunity at common law.

19

Now, I can't cite you a case that says -- that specifically
20

says that -- that was a British case, as of the date of -21

1983 .
22

Now the next thing is, that any such immunity that
23

is awarded to the private individuals who conspire with the
24

judge, constitutes an invitation to corruption.

That's just

engraved into the idea; that if you are going to allow a man

And he abated for 31 months. And the

Now,

that doesn't meet the standard that the constitution guar­
antees .
QUESTION:

I don't think I understand yet what the

rationale is of these cases -MR. SMITH:

Well, the rationale was that because it

takes two to conspire, when you remove the state, the immune
state officer, you just have one left; therefore, there was no
conspiracy because you can't conspire with yourself.

But I think any frivolous lawsuit certainly

would be disposed of because before they haul a judge off his
bench and tie him up for two weeks in testimony, I just can't
see a federal district judge allowing that to happen under
the rooves that allow protection against that sort of harass­
ment.

I think to bring a state judge off his bench, I think

the federal judge would have to be convinced that there's some
merit to this case.

If he could

have a degree of immunity from being hauled into the case?
MR. SMITH:

MR. SMITH:

I think he would have more and I think

I think they would recognize

that the judge, because of his responsibilities to the public,
23

that they just can't haul him off of the bench and tie him up

for two weeks.

Of course, your colleague suggests that

Well, -Using a parallel, Mr. Smith, with

many of the suits against cabinet officers, now under the
new statutes a cabinet officer may be sued in any federal
jurisdiction in the country and --

MR. SMITH:

Of course.

And

16

haven't the courts seen to it that their testimony can be taken

their cabinet work?
19

MR. SMITH:

I think those orders of protection could

20

be given in judicial cases.

I think the rules are more relaxed

21

with respect to executive officers, those who have what they
22

call a limited immunity.

You see, a lot of these public:offi-

MR. SMITH:

I mean if a judge hits you with his automobile on

It's when he gets on the bench and

Of course, we don't know where this bribe was given,

10

whether it was out on the ranch or in town, in the cafe, in

1 1

the coffee shop, or whether it was in chambers.

QUESTION:

bench and entered the wrongful injunction in response to that.
QUESTION:

And he clearly had the authority to enter

an injunction?
MR. SMITH:

He has authority to enter an injunction.

I think the appellate court drew that he abused his discretion
They -- this particular injunction because it wasn't pled
for, number one, and they could have him -- the suit asked for
an injunction against pollution.

They alleged that they were

operating the wells in a manner to pollute the surface of the
land, but the surface of the land in this case wasn't owned
by the Petitioner.

But, the injunction could have enjoined

pollution, but under Texas law there is no way they could have

37

1

enjoined him from the lawful operation of producing oil.

2

They could have enjoined him from pollution but not from

3

operating the property, and that's where it was fatally defec­

4

tive and that's why the appellate courts ruled that it was an

5

abuse of discretion that he entered it and of course he entered

6

it without taking any evidence to speak of, it was practically

7

on the pleadings.

8

not too much involved here, but that's what the background is.

But those were in the case, that's really

And that's what the courts have

Now, the courts that have taken an opposite position

If you're going to

hear all these .frivolous cases.
Now, and as observed by the 5th Circuit, there's
very little inconvenience to the judge and it's relatively
insignificant when you compare it with the benefits to be
derived by allowing suits under general immunity.
Now, with respect to a state court case, there is a
case pending.

I think I should explain that since it has been
38

1

mentioned.
When this case was filed, Judge Carrillo was still

2
3

sitting as judge of the court in Bigelow County.

4

proceeding, we realized we had a more serious question here

5

on this matter of judicial immunity that we thought when we

6

started out.

7

As it was

Frankly, my mind at the beginning just couldn't

conceive of a holding that a judge could accept a bribe and

8

he not be immune, and certainly that he would confer that
9

immunity to other parties.

I didn't grasp that.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your time has expired

now, Mr.

Smith.

MR. SMITH:

anything further, Mr. Edmonds?
MR. EDMONDS:

Yes, Your Honor, if I may take a few

minutes to respond to several matters that have been raised.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FINLEY L. EDMONDS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL
MR. EDMONDS:

Mr. Smith makes the statement in his

argument that his client is left out in the cold.

Again, I

think this consideration is critical when we talk about the
rationale for this statute,

the rationale of Congress in

implementing this and passing this statute to implement the
Fourteenth Amendment.
39

1

Judge Carrillo did enter this injunction but that

2

injunction in the course of the procedures and the substantive

3

law that exists in the State of Texas, that injunction was set

4

aside by a Texas court.

5

Sparks and Lynd, Mr. Smith's clients, did not have

6

to go to a federal court to get the Texas courts to do right.

7

The Texas courts resolved the question.

He was not left out

Secondly, they were not left out in the cold because

they have pending a lawsuit in a Texas court under Texas law

for the wrongful injunction.

QUESTION:

Yes, I know, but they say that's a briar

patch down in Duval County, that they can't get justice.
MR. EDMONDS:

Well, part of that lawsuit is pending

15

in Nueces County, Your Honor, as was pointed out in our brief.

16

Part of that lawsuit under the Texas venue procedure, the

17

lawsuit as it applies to my client, Mr. Dennis, is pending in

18

Nueces County.

QUESTION:

MR. EDMONDS:

Yes, Your Honor, which I submit is not

a hornet's nest in Texas.
QUESTION:

A briar patch is their place.

MR. EDMONDS:
QUESTION:

Or briar patch.

Mr. Edmonds, if you had four conspirators

here, alleged conspirators, rather than just one and the judge,
40

1

but one of the four was a state judge, would you still be here?

2

MR. EDMONDS:

3

QUESTION:

MR. EDMONDS:

QUESTION:

If one of the four was a state judge?

Yes.
Well, that's --

So that his immunity applies to all the

other conspirators, not just a single .one.

we have here.
QUESTION:

10

11

Yes, Your Honor.

Is that your posi­

Well, what if the plaintiffs in a lawsuit

file the lawsuit against your clients and they claim the
immunity and your clients come in and claim immunity, based
on the immunity of a state judge?

And the answer of the plain­

tiffs is, we stipulate that we'll never bother that judge,
we'll never call him as a witness, he'll never be a witness
against any of you, we'll not bother him at all.

But we'd

have to admit that in the course of our lawsuit we're going to
try to prove that he was corrupt.

Now, would you think your

claim of immunity would be satisfied by, on any stipulation
like that?
MR. EDMONDS:

The public interest behind judicial

21

immunity would definitely not be satisfied.
22

QUESTION:

Why?

Why not?

23

MR. EDMONDS:

Your statement, that in the course of

24

these proceedings we're going to prove that there was a
25

41

1

2

conspiracy for this judge to do wrong.

That's the very

essence of judicial immunity, the very essence of it.

3

And my man is raising that immunity, not because he's a judge

4

but because of this Court's decision in Pierson v. Ray that

5

judicial immunity is applicable in 1983 despite the fact that

6

there's nothing .said in that statute about judicial immunity

7

or any immunity.

8
9

10

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that the public

interest rationale is meant to kind of put up a facade to the
public that all judges are much more honest than normal people'?
MR. EDMONDS:

11

To use Mr. Smith's term, I guess that

12

would be a fiction that we'd be dealing with, Your Honor.

13

I don't think that the purpose of immunity is to create a

14

fiction.

15

to the King's Bench, hundreds of years ago, is that there was

16

presumption that it does exist.

17

what if we get into a situation where the majority of judges

18

are corrupt?

I think the purpose of this immunity that goes back

'

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. EDMONDS:

21
22

And if we wanted to find that

Well, the public interest connection -Perhaps public interest will be changed

then.
QUESTION:

The public interest rationale certainly

23

doesn't prevent the filing of a complaint, which may get great

24

publicity in the papers as to what the claims are about what

25

some judge did.

And despite any stipulation or the immunity

42

1

of the judge from being called as a witness, there it is, and

2

if the case goes forward against him and there's a judgment

3

against the plaintiffs -- namely that the — that nobody did

4

anything wrong, why, the judge is going to be vindicated, I

5

suppose .

6

MR. EDMONDS:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

And if the finding is that the conspira­

8

tors really did conspire with the judge, it doesn't add a

9

whole — so what's the -MR. EDMONDS:

10
11

ability to file a lawsuit.
QUESTION:

12
13

Just the mere fact of filing, the

Well -- oh, I know, but the immunity

doesn't protect their buddy from that.
MR. EDMONDS:

14

That's right, that's right.

And I have

15

to submit to the court that this isn't as easy a question to

16

answer as Mr. Smith's events.

17

there's a black and white side to this.

18
19

We're not trying to say that
It's a matter of

balancing.
QUESTION:

Even with the explicit, very explicit

20

immunity and protection of the Speech or Debate Clause, a

21

member of Congress can be sued under 1983 or in many other

22

ways, and that doesn't stop that exposure.

23
24

25

MR. EDMONDS:

No, but he's immune if the conduct

for which he was sued falls under the Speech or Debate Clause.
QUESTION:
-

Yes but he isn't immune from having
43

1

someone file a complaint with a lot of scurrilous allegations.

2

MR. EDMONDS:

Yes, Your Honor, that's right.

If

3

we're not talking here about, should the scope of judicial

4

immunity be broad enough to somehow screen out lawsuits as

5

they're being filed as the Clerk's house, I guess the answer

6

there is to respond upon, depend upon responsible journalism

7

that they don't blow a lawsuit like that out of proportion when

8

it's filed, before it's adjudicated.
Under the respondent's view of 1983 and the ability

9

10

to pursue conspirators, these private citizens, I submit that,

11

to follow respondent's view of the case, that the respondent

12

could have gone to federal court immediately at the time that

13

Judge Carrillo entered the temporary injunction, even
