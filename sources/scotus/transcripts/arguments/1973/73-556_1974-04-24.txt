These cases are here on writs of certiorari to the
district of Columbia Circuit which in a five-to-four en banc
decision denied enforcement of the board’s orders directed ag
against respondent unions.
The basic question is whether a union violates sec­
tion 8.(b) (1) (b) of the National Labor Relations Act, which bars
a union from restraining an employer in the selection of his
representatives for the purpose of collective bargaiMhg or th -

There was
So both

cases are up hex'© on the board's petition.
Other supervisors at a higher level, for example
district supervisor, plant supervisor, were not covered by the
collective agreement.

The companies, however, permitted these

6
supervisors to retain their union nvanbership, and many of thaw
did.

Some of these were not active union members but held

honorary withdrawal cards from their respective locals which-

iifcled them to rejoin the locals at any time without paying
an initiation fee and/or apply for pension benefits.

In addi­

tion, they entitled them to union death benefits.
Members with withdrawal cards, however

remain obli­

gated to abide by the union's rules and are subject to. disciplin
if they do not.
Both companies were struck over new contract terms
and picket lines were set up in front of the plants.

The com­

pany tried to maintain operations with their supervisors.

The

record does not show what directions Florida Power gave tc its
■ u.. rvisors.

It does show that Illinois Bell informed its

rvisors that it would like them to work but that £ha de­
cision would be left to each supervisor.

The union in Illinois

Be11 warned the supervisor members that they would be subject
to discipline if they performed rank and file work during the
strike.
Both supervisors in the contract unit and those outside (..ha unit cr

fork in­

cluding work that would normally have been performed by the
rank and file striking employees.

After the strike, the unions

disciplined, those supervisor members who had performed fens rank
and file work, and at Florida Power they were fined in amounts

*7

ranging from $100 to $6,000, and many of them were also expelled
from membership in their respective locals; and in Illinois
Bell, the discipline consisted in most cases of $500 fines
which were enforceable by court suit.
Charges were filed with the board alleging that the
discipline of the supervisor members violated section 8(b)(1)(b)
of the Act.
Q

May I ask, was it the same union in both cases?

HR. COME;

‘The international

I do not think it is a party in

Florida Power.
The board found that all of the supervisors who ware
disciplined was at issue, were not only supervisors within the
meaning of section 2.11 of the National Labor Relations Act. but
re marrgcment r©prorentativas within the meaning of section
? (b) (1) (b) , that is they had grievance adjustment and/or collec­
te ve ba; .-gaining functions„
The board, with one member dissenting, held that the
unions violated section 8(b)(1)(b) by disciplining those super*?
visors for performing the rank and file work during the strike.

and entered an appropriate remedial order, and the Court of
Appeals, as I indicated at the outset, in a five-to-four dec it-ion
declined to enforce the board's orders.
Now, we start, with section 8 (b) (1) (b) of the Act which,
a •; I .indicated, makes it an unfair labor practice for a union to
??'c train or coerce an employer in the selection of his r®pre~
snfcatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the
adjustment of grievances.
Mow, there is no question that this clearly 'prescribes
direct union pressure on an employer --for example, a strike
'threat

to force it to change the identity of its chosen col­

lective bargaining or grievance adjustment representative.
Now. Oakland Mailers', cited in 1968, the board, for
the first time, was confronted with the problem of whether or
not section 8(b)(1)(b) would also cover the indirect pressure
that, results from union discipline of a supervisor member who

•has collective bargaining and grievance adjustment functions
for the manner in which he performed those duties.

And the

board concluded that it did under theory that such discipline
would tend to make the supervisor responsive or subservient to

the union's will and thereby deprive the employer of his full
allegiance, so that as a practical matter the employer would
either have to replace that supervisor or, to quote the board,
"face de facto non-representation by him."
Now, the court below agrees, although the union does

9

not, that section 8(b)(1)(b) may properly be construed to inter­
dict such indirect pressure on the employer,

As the Court of

men!'.: pointed out, although section 8(b)(1)(b) speaks literal­
ly in terras of coercing the selection of employer representa­
tives, it is clear that management’s right to a free selection
would be hollow indeed, quoting the court, if the union could
dictate the manner in which the selected representative performed
his collective bargaining and grievance adjustment functions.
Now, the court below, however, that is the majority
of the court, concluded that this reasoning does not hold true
Whereas.her© a supervisor is disciplined for performing rank
and file work during the strike,

And the court*3 argument is

that -if a supervisor forsakes his supervisory role to do rank
and kilo work- he is no longer acting as a management'"repre• rotative, and that there is a clear-cut dividing line between
supervi:;ory and non-supervisory work and, accordinglyy there is

no rearer to believe that, by being forced to fake sides with

.

’the union, a supervisor will suffer from a. change of attitude
when after the strike he returns to his normal supervisory
duties«
Now, we submit, as the dissenting judges belev cor­
rectly observed, -the position of the majority of the court
below reflects an unrealistic view of the role of the strike in
the collective bargaining process, because just as a union
seals: lo strengthen its hand at the bargaining table by bringing

the company's operations to a halt, so management, in order to
hold out for the terms it wants, seeks to counter this pressure
by keeping operations going, and the performance of ran": and
file work during a strike by supervisors and other management
representatives is a vital part of such a company effort.
So that insofar as the supervisor is called upon, by
the employer to assist him in keeping the plant running., he is
’adtihg as a management representative, and to discipline him for
such activity we submit the board could reasonably conclude
could have a lingering effect that would affect, the future performanca of his supervisory duties.
Now, this reading of section 8 (b) {1}(b) we submit
furthers Congress * intention with respect to the status of
supervisory employees under the Act.

Only yesterday, this

Court, in the Bell Aerospace decision, noted the fact that in
1947 Congress sought to assure employers of the undivided
loyalty of their supervisors which it believed had been jeopar­
dized by this Court’s holding in Packard, that foremen were
employees under the Wagner Act and constituted an appropriate
unit for collective bargaining.
Congress believed that the inclusion of supervisors
into organizations composed of or subservient to th© men that
they ouparvised tended to draw the line between management and
lator'and to upset the balance of collective bargaining.

And

Congress, the legislative history indicates, was concerned about

this result during a strike no less than at other times, be
cause there is repeated reference in the legislative history to
the fact that even when foremen organised in a union of their
cun were nonetheless in a strike situation, subservient to the
rank and file unions, that the foremen's association had indeed
adopted a formal policy forbidding its members when the rank
and file unions sought to enter the

struck plants and protect

and maintain them without the concurrence of the rank and file.
Nov/, Congress, in an effort to restore this; balance,
it quoted true supervisors, from the definition of employees,
and hence from the protection of the Act, and this relieved
the employer of the obligation recognised in Packard to bargain
collectively with the union representing its supervisors and
also to insist that the supervisors under pain of discharge
leave the union.
Now this insistence, however, namely that the. super­
visors leave the union, is not practicable in many industries,
such as the construction industry, the printing Industry, and
the utility industry here.

Where rank and file 'employees are

highly organized, the supervisors are picked from the rank.and
file, and they are unwilling to give up their union

membership

because this would result in the forfeiture of substantial
pension and other benefits? moreover, they may return to rank
and file status in the future.

On some jobs they may be a

supervisor, on other jobs a rank and file worker.

12
Q

I gather, although not understanding all of this,

the employer may nevertheless insist, if ha wants to —
MR. COME:
Q

He may nevertheless ~~

— belong to the union and he may dismissed them

indeed if they are union members?
MR. COME:

He may.

He may.

But the practicalities

are that in these industries, if he is strong enough to do that,
he may not get a contract or
Q

Mot only that, I gather, as you have said, so

often, certainly in the telephone industry that is true, isn't
it, the supervisors are drawn from the rank and file?
MR. COME:

That is correct, but ho might not be able

to find other supervisors.
and

the-

So where you have this, situation,

supervisors remain union members, subjecting them to

union disciplines for the performance of their supervisory

functions tends to create the very conflict of loyalty and
.dilution of managerial authority problems which Congress sought

if

to avoid.
Q

Mr. Come, you said supervisory.

performing supervisory duties.
MR. COME:

They are not

Am I right?

We submit that during a strike, whatever

the supervisor is called upon to perform, it is part of his
normal supervisory or management functions, because during a
strike the supervisor is called upon to help out in any way that
is necessary to keep the plant going, and he

13
Q

So if he is sweeping the floor, he is a super-

visor?
MR. COME: ' He will he acting in the interest of the
employer —
Q

And he will be working in a supervisory capacity?

MR. COME:
Q

That is correct.

You are just using words now, aren't you?

He is

actually doing the workers' job.
MR. COME:
Q

That is —

He is a member of the union, to protect, and

by doing it he deliberately interferes with the union —
MR. COME:
Q

Well, that is —

of his own volition?

MR. COME:

That is true, but he is caught between the

devil and the deep blue sea because, unlike a regular employee
who' cannot be discharged for striking, a supervisor is a
management representative and his first loyalty, at least this
•/as Congress* intention in amending the act in ’47, is supposed
to be to the employer.
Q

And the secondary is to the union?

MR. COME:
Q

That is correct.

And which the union is trying to enforce?

MR. COME:

That is correct, and we submit that that:

upsets the balance that Congress drew in 1947.
Now, in 'idia situation where —

Q

Could the union, consistent with the act, have a

rule that required one of its rank and file members who became
a supervisor to leave the union?

Could they say we don't want

supervisors in -this union, if the board's policy is that we
can't discipline them?
MR. COME2

Yes.

Yes, they could.

Yes, they could.

But I think that the unions have ordinarily not cion® this,
Now
Q

Mr. Com®, you can't bs serious in response to my

brother Marshall's question, that he is performing supervisory
duties during the strike?. He is not, he is not supervising any­
body, he is performing the work of the employees.

But what he

Is doing is performing management duties — management duties —
because, by

finition, the employees are on strike and the or

left in the plant ara management.
MR. COME!
Q

1 think —

And it is to the interest of management to keep

the business going, both for ordinary business reasons and also
for strategic and tactical reasons in the.strike.
MR. COME:
Q

I think that —

These are not supervisory duties, they are man­

agement duties.
MR. COME:

1 think that is a more accurate way of put­

ting it, Mr. Justice Stewart.

As the Seventh Circuit pointed

out in the Wisconsin Electric case, which is pending here on

certiorari here, the court sustained the board, that what is
supervisory duties is void during a strike situation, because
what a supervisor's normal duties are when a total complement
of employees is at work is totally different from what its
duties may be during a strike when there are few or no employees
at work, and it is at that time, whatever he is doing, he is
doing as part of management.
Q

Now —

In other words, you are saying that fining them

for doing management duties during a strike is to coerce them
in their collective bargaining role later?
MR. COME:
Q

That is correct, that there is —

Is that the argument?

MR. COMEj

Yes, that there is likely to be a linger-»

ing effect or a spill-over effect, at least the employer could
reasonably so fear, that an employee that is a supervisor,
having been subjected to this discipline for doing'management’s
bidding during a strike can at least, feel under a sense of
constraint and shade things in the union's way the ne;>t thing
the confrontation arises -~
0

Well, that confrontation, Mr. Come, I gather, in

■ths case of a supervisor, is more likely to be in connection
with adjustment of grievances than —*
MR. COMEs

Q

That is correct.

in collective bargaining?

MR. COME:

That is correct.

Now, collective bargaining

16

includes the interpretation of fch® contract as far as —
i

Q

Yes, but subsection (b) speaks of coercion, for

the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of
grievances„
MR. COME;

Yes, the adjustment of grievances would be

the more —
Q

The more likely one, wouldn't it?

MR. COMEs
Q

— the more likely, yes, that is correct.

Mr. Come, you have to take this position in

order.to bring yourself within the meaning of the statute, don't
you?
MR. COME;
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

And am I correct that the board took exactly the

opposite position until 1968?
MR. COME:

Ho, Your Honor, that is not the Way I read

the board's history.

The board, to my — to the 'best of my

research, was not presented with any cases involving this type
of indirect pressure on the employer that flows from union
discipline until 1968.

I think that what happened is, after

this Court decided Allis-Chalmers in 1967, the board began to
get; a. flurry of cases involving union discipline of various
types, so that the reason that this doctrine is late in evolving
is not for the reason that has been present in many of the cases
that I have recently argued before this Court, that the board
lias changed its mind three or four times over the course of

17
history.
I think that in this situation, the problem just did
not arise.
Q

But it is new?

MR. COMEs

It is new.

Yes. Your Honor, it is new,

Nov?, the point
Q

Now, trying to get- back to this section again,

Mr. Come
MR. COME;
Q

Yes.

— I gather — do you parse this restrainer

course, one, an employer in the selection' of his representatives
for the purposes of collective bargaining; or, two, ah employer
and the selection of his representatives for the purposes of
:

!

the adjustment of grievances as two separate
MR. COME;
tive.

Yes, Your Honor, they are in. the disjunc­

They are in the disjunctive.
Now, in a situation where the employer is not able to

insist successfully that his supervisors leave the union, you
have a very big gap in effectuating Congress' objective with
raspect to supervisors, unless you read, interpret 8(b)(1)(b)
as the board has done.

Now, to be sure, the legislative history

of 8(b)(1)(b) contains no indication that the provision was
going to be so interpreted.

We submit that this is because

Congress focused on the most obvious forms of union impairment
of the employer's selection of his representative, namely the

direct form of pressure, and in these circumstances we have the
familiar problem of asking which choice is it more likely that
Congress would have made had it been presented with this pre­
cise problem, and we submit that the board was reasonable in
view of Congress1 clear-cut intention to insure the employers
of the undivided loyalty of its supervisors, that it would have
sanctioned, the. interpretation of 8(b)(1)(b), that the board
has employed in these cases»
I would like to save the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAY C. MULLER, ESQ., ON
BEHALF OF FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT CO., PETITIONER
MR. MULLER;

I am Ray Muller, for the petitioner, Florida Power ft

Light, in this matter'.
Mr. Come has reviewed the facts and reviewed the lav/.

There is,

.cally, as a management representative, it is difficult

for me to accept the distinction made by the Court of Appeals
and by the union, and to some extent by the board, that there
is a difference between so-called rank and file work and
management work, and that that distinction can be a predicate
for finding unlawful fines or lav/ful fines.
As a little background, this case came before the

19

Labor Board following a complaint by its regional director on
a written stipulation of the parties as to issues and facts.
The stipulated issue before the board was whether or not the
unions lawfully fined supervisors who had crossed picket lines
and continued to work for the company °, no distinction in the
original stipulation.

Thereafter, the board, in its decision,

obliquely inserted the rank and file versus management work
issue by finding that the supervisory fines had been imposed
for working, performing work behind the picket line and "in,”
eluding bargaining unit work" — and that the fines were illegal
So the board initially inserted that distinction.
Thereafter, the Court of Appeals picked up that distinction.
The Court of Appeals refined it £ urther and said that if the
individual supervisor was engaged in management work, he was
immune from union discipline? if rank and file, he could be
discip1ined.
The unions apparently agree with that position.

Our

petition to this Court for certiorari also framed — the
petitioner, Florida Power 6 Light — also framed the issue and
confined it to work for the company behind the picket line .

We

made no distinction between management work and so-called rank
■and file work.
The unions, in their brief, agree that congressional
policy reflects an intent that employers be assured the undi­
vided loyalty of their supervisors.

If that is true, what doss

20
"undivided loaylty" mean?

It must mean doing what is in the

best interest of management, the employer.

tion, which is of course apparent that undivided loyalty re­

He is

Realistically, in a strike situation, no distinc­

management work.

To conclude that lawfulness or unlawfulness of a
supervisory fine shall be controlled by the type of work the
supervisor may be performing behind a picket line would create
an entirely unrealistic situs- ion, an unworkable situation.
Consider, this Florida Power — I’m sorry — the Florida Power a
Light strike that we are talking about lasted in excess of
'thirty days.

Currently we went through another strike that

lasted in excess of sixty days.

Consider the supervisor.

If

we are >]to use a distinction "management, work” versus "rank and

Q

One thing he wasn’t doing, he wasn’t supervising,

because ha didn't have anybody to supervise.
MR. MULLER:
Q

Am I right?

He had no one to supervise but he was —

So he couldn’t be doing supervisory work?

21
MR. MULLER:

He was performing a management function.

He was performing a management function.
Q

Other than supervising?

MR. MULLER:

Other than supervising, that is right.

I'fe submit that the distinction between management work, which
the Court of Appeals says is immune from discipline, and rank
and file work, which the Court of Appeals says is not immune
from discipline, is a distinction without substance.
Q

What did Florida Light & Power tell its super­

visors when the strike began?
MR. MULLER:

Mr. Justice White, it was left to -their

discretion whether it would come in or not.

That does not

appear in the record but, as a matter of fact, was left to
their discretion.
Q

It is in the record in the Bell case, I take it?

Yes.

obey it?
MR. MULLER:

Mot particularly in the union rule sense,

more in the sense if you feel a loyalty sense, or for any
reason you don't want to corns in sense,
Q

But if the union has got a membership rule that

you don't cross a picket line during a strike, you left it up
to the supervisors as to whether to obey that rule?
MR. MULLER:

Your Honor, it is a difficult situation.

This Court has currently before it a case —
Q

But you did leave it up to them?

MR. MULLER:
Q

Yes.

And so that you were not being deprived of any­

thing that you insisted on by the union's action against the
supervisors?

If the supervisor — if the union had said no

to the supervisor, we are going to fin® you if you keep this up
and he had stayed away, you wouldn't have said anything?

This Court presently has

It is not an easy

decision to tell an employer discharge your supervisors if they
won't come to work.
We submit to you that management is entitled to the
undivided loyalty of its supervisors.

If the supervisor cannot

or will not do all in the best interest of management because
of the union sanctions or the threat of union sanctions, the

resentative, and we submit the imposition of those union sanc­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF

Mr. Cohen;

LAURENCE J. COHEN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE UNION RESPONDENTS
MR. COHEN:

Mr. Justice Douglas, and may it please the

Court.:
Mr. Come has spoken of the practicalities, he has said
the effects of these cases

as a practical matter.

We submit

that what these cases involve is not a practical matter but a
statutory matter.

We view the controlling question here as one

of congressional intentions? specifically, is there anything in
either the language of section 8(b)(1)(b) or its legislative
history that shows that Congress ever contemplated that it would
be a violation of that section for a union to fin© its members
who are supervisors,with the consent of the employer, for engag­
ing in strike breaking.
The language of the section, as Mr. Justice Brennan
has pointed out, is quite clear, it is unambiguous, it is
narrow.

The Senate report, which we have cited at page 15 of

our brief, the blue brief, also shows that Congress intended no
greater reach for that section than its words connote.

It

speaks of forcing employers in or out of employer associations,

25
and it says also "this subsection would not permit a union to
dictate who shall represent an employer in the settlement of
employee grievances, or to compel the removal of a personnel
director or supervisor who has been delegated the function of
settling grievances."
The remarks of Senators Taft and Ellender, which we
have cited on page 16 of our brief, again show that that is
all that Congress had in mind in section 3(b)(1)(b).

In fact,

in profacing his description of 8(b)(1)(b), Senator Taft said
that the section was not "perhaps of tremendous importance."
There is simply nothing that the board can point to to show
that Congress was thinking of the discipline of supervisors who
are permitted to remain union members whenit enacted 8(b)(1)(a).
Nor is there anything in the legislative history of
that section which deals with this divided loyalty question.
It was obviously very much in the mind cf Congress at that time
and Congress spoke through section 2(3), 2(11), and I4 (a) .
we think the significant point is what they did.

But

Congress did

not create an unfair labor practice? rather, there were two
•■bat we might call extreme positions advanced at the time.
One group said the foreman or supervisor should have
chance to remain in their own unions, perhaps in not employee
unions but in their own unions.
be outlawed completely.

Another group said it should

And the compromise that was struck

said it is up to the employer to decide what he wants to let

them do.
They were, removed from the definition of employee in
section 2 (3), they were stripped of their rights under the Act,
and they were allowed to remain union members only at the
oaffranc© of chair employer.

But there is absolutely nothing

to which the other side can point which shows that Congress, intended to make it an unfair labor practice if the supervisors
were to remain, in the union, or once they were allowed to remain
and were subject to the same union rules as other members, that
it would be a violation of section 8(b)(1)(b) —
Q

Well, I gather that really what you are saying

is that (b), the emphasis ought to be on the word "selection" —
MR. COHENs
Q

That is what we think Congress intended.

—* but it went no further than to say that a

union could not dictate to the employer whom it should have as
tho head of the personnel department, or as a foreman or vice

president , or

president, or anything else.

MR. COHEN;

We think that is precisely what Congress

had in mind and all that it had in mind.
with that argument when we are here'.

Now, we are confronted

Well, what about the

effect of this so-called evolution of cases since Oakland
Mailers in 1968?

Of course, we note, as this

Court observed

yesterday in its Bell Aerospace decision, once again, that it
is always significant to look at what the board has done? for
twenty or twenty-five years in assessing the meaning of the

27
statute.

However, we also recognise that no court of appeals

has accepted the argument*, to date, that even the Oakland Mailers
/

doctrine steps beyond 8(b)(1)(b) because it affects more than
the selection, the identity question.
But as the court below held, even if 8(b)(1)(b)

is

read more broadly, as the board has read it in Oakland Mailers
it still has to have some relationship to the performance of
an 8(b)(1)(b)

function, which is either collective bargaining

or grievance adjustment; or, at the very least, what the board
has in a second step stretched it to, to include the performanca of - some supervisory duties as they are defined in section

2(11)

.

You see, the board has proceeded gradually ~~

aboil t a: fine imposed by the union for a supervisor in 'the pro­

e'es s of handling a grievance, construing the contract, in a car­
ta in way'
MR. COHEN:
Mr, Justice White.

Our principal position here does' not,
We do believe that the Oakland Mailers

doctrine actually stepped beyond the intention of Congress,
and if that is so, and if the Court should so decide, then, yes,
even that would be outside of the reach of 8(b)(1)(b).

But w©

a" narrower position here, as did the court below, that

even if Oakland Mailers is correct in saying that any time
the employer is engaged in an 8(b)(X) (to) function, collective

28

bargaining or grievance adjustment, or a supervisory duty, then
the union may not touch him.

We are willing to go that far,

even though we think that is beyond the intent of Congress.
Q

Did Congress leave no latitude for for the board

to construe that language, in your opinion?
MR. COHEN:

We believe, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that

Congress intended to read
ture.

the board completely out of the pic­

Now, let me explain that.

Congress deprived the super­

visor both of his status as an employee and of any rights under
the Act.

In the words of Senator Taft, they were "generally

restored to the basis which they enjoyed before the passage of
the Wagner Act."
It was clear frora the debates that Congress was con­
cerned that the board was lending its processes1 to the organi­
zation of supervisors, and it not only read the supervisor out
of the protection of the Act, but it read the board out of the
picture.

It said we are going to leave this to the employer,

he can strike an agreement with the union at the bargaining tab!
if he wants to permit them to retain union membership, but ho
doesn’t have to;

And in that sense, the only thing that Cohgres

did was to give the employer the leeway to decide, and we be­
lieve it intended to keep the board out of the business of
regulating supervisory activities or the relationship of the
union to its supervisors.
Q

Except that a union could not pressure the

29
employer to replace one supervisor with another presumably?
MR. COHEN;

On that there is absolutely no question,

that is correct.
Q

And that puts the board right into it: because

8(fo)(1)(b) creates an unfair labor practice which is for the
board to handle.
MR. COHEN;
labor practice.

Which is a very narrowly defined unfair

But we are taking the principal position here

— and I am certainly willing to argue on that basis — that
the board may prohibit under 8(b)(1) (b) the imposition of union
rules on supervisors when they are functioning as supervisors
or as a management agent.

But as the court below held:» to say

that the performance of rank and file work in the course of a
strike is somehow an 8(b)(1)(b) duty or a 2(11) function» is
like saying black is white.
Q

8(b)(1) (b) doesn’t use the word ''supervisors"

at all?
MR. COHEN;
0

It does not.

It is representatives» isn't it?

MR. COHEN;

Representative for two purposes» collec­

tive bargaining and grievance adjustment.

Q

And isn't a strike part of collective bargaining

MR. COHEN;

Under Insurance Agents» it is true that a

strike is part of the collective bargaining process, but that
is not enough, we submit» to read this activity into 8(b)(1)(b)

3.0
A strike is part of the collective bargaining process, obviously
a supervisor who returns to work aids the employer, but so does
a rank and file employee who decides "I need the money, I am
going back to work.”
Q

Supposing you have a — supposs in an employee

strike you had a group of rank and file employees who crossed
the picket line and then the supervisor crossed the picket line
to supervise them, would you feel that made this a different
case?
MR. COHENs

It is a completely different case and, as

a matter of fact, that situation was' presented in Illinois Bell.
At page 286 .of the Appendis, union representative Cunningham
was asked what about supervisors who were charged with violating
the union’s constitution but who, it turns out, only performed
supervisory duties?

And the answer was the charges were dropped

against those members.
You see, the situation is not quite as simple as the
Seventh Circuit would have it appear.
there are employees working.

Often during a strike,

employees to supervise.

So that often there are

At least in Illinois Bell, some of

those employees were supervised and a supervisor member who did

31

only that was simply not disciplined.
r

So wo definitely draw

distinction.
Q

On what basis do you draw that distinction?

HR. COHEN:

Because when a supervisor is in fact

directing the work force, doing what he normally does, he is
performing at the very least a supervisory duty as that is de­
fined in 2(11) .
Q

Well, then, you do accept —

MR. COHEN:

Oakland Mailers?

Yes.

MR. COHEN5

Very reluctantly.

I think it is wrong,

Mr. Justice White —
Q

Well, l know, but —

HR. COHEN:

— but the union has not succeeded in

convincing any court of that, so I am loath to try and convince
this Court, when we can• succeed on a narrower ground.
Q

But the only way you accept it is by saying that

t union would be influencing rather than replacing him if
they fined him?
MR. COHEN:

To use the board’s word, it would be

”interferingM with
Q

Yes.

MR. COHEN:

— the right of the employer to have this

loyalty, which we do not believe fits within 8(b)(1)(b) at all,
but if it does, it certainly fits no further than that.

32
Basically what the board and Florida Power argue here,
we submit, is a policy question, and we submit in return that
what is involved here is not whether the policy which underlies
these decisions is a good one or a bad one, or what they law
should be, but whether it was in fact what Congress intended.
We submit that both the language of 8(b)(1)(b), its legislative
history, and even the legislative history of 2(3), 2(11) and
14(a) show no support for the board's position that Congress
made this specific Act an unfair labor practice under 8(b)(1)(b),
and wa think on that basis alone the court below should be

affirmed»
But there is an additional reason:

The effect of the

jard•’s expansive reading of 8(b) (1) (fo) here is to intrude dicfcly into the area of regulation of economic weapons.

That

flies in the face of section 13 of the Act, it is contrary to
what this Court has told the board on past occasions, particulary in Insurance Agents and in the Curtis Brothers case,
Drivers Local Union 639, where the board similarly tried to ex­
pand 8(b)(1)(a), and the Court, in an opinion by - Mr. Justice
Brennan, said you may not do that, we have to stick with what
Congress enacted, even if the board thinks it is a better system,
It relied on section 13, it relied on Mr. Justice Frankfurter's
Tuionition, which is certainly pertinent here, that the Act was
very much the result of conflicting pressures and of compromise
and that expansive readings are not to be given to sections,

33
even if their language is ambiguous, and we submit 8(b)(1)(b)
does not have ambiguous language to begin with.
Now, the economic weapon, of course, that would be
diminished here is the same
Chalmers.

weapon that was involved in Allis-

As this Court said in Allis-Chalmers, at pages 181

and 182, the economic .strike against the employer is the ulti­
mate weapon in. labor's arsenal for achieving agreement upon its
terms, and the power to fine or expel strike breakers is essen­
tial if the union is to be an effective bargaining agent.

Of

course, those principles were reaffirmed last term in the
Boeing decision, and as the court below concluded in all rele­
vant respects, the Allis-Chalmers decision is indistinguishable
from the facts of this case.
The union's interest is just as valid, it. is
great.

just as

The employee has the economic weapon of trying to use

his supervisors as strike breakers.

The union has its right,

if they are members, to discipline them for doing so.
Finally, I would like to say this, that the employer
in this case says first, of all \-/e are caught in the middle and
we say to that, you are not at all caught in the middle, you
have an absolute right under the Act to say to your supervisors
"get out of the union, you may not stay in the union,” and to
say to the union, "these supervisors are now beyond vour con­
trol ."
And it is interesting to note, although it is not in

O A

the record, it occurred since the record in this case, that dur­
ing the last Florida 'Power a Light strike, this past winter,
the company directed all of its supervisors to resign from the
union and, in fact, they did so.

So the employer has, so to

speak, the ultimate weapon in that respect, simply by exercis­
ing the' option open to it, which was the precise remedy which
Congress gave it in 14(a).
And I think it is also instructive to note what hap­
pened in the Illinois Bell case following this strike.

At

footnote 3.1 of our brief, which is at page 61, we point out
that in 1971 — the strike was in 1968 — the parties again sat
down at the bargaining table and the employer specifically
waived its right to make any effort whatever to force the
supervisors out of the union, and it did so for a very prac­
tical reason, it got a very substantive and substantial conces­
sion from the union concerning the jurisdictional claims of the
union. . That we submit was the process which Congress intended,
that the parties would work out with the employer having the
ultimate say, what the status of his supervisors would be.
In these cases, for varying reasons, the employers
decided to let their supervisors remain in the union.

In the

Illinois Bell case, as I note, we can point to something
specifics
it out.

They got benefits in exchange for it.

They bargains

But it is an impermissible jump to go fra?, there to

say that when the employer nevertheless says they can stay in

35
the union and, of course, as members are subject to union con­
trol, that it suddenly becomes a violation of this narrowly
drawn section if the union follows its traditional practice?
which this Court

noted in Allis-Chalmers existed long before

Taft-Hartley, of discipling them for the basic violation of
strike breaking.
If the Court has no questions, Mr. Gold will proceed
with his argument.
MR. .JUSTICE DOUGLAS;

Mr. Gold.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ., ON
BEHALF OF THE AFL-CIO, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. GOLD:

Thank you, Mr. Justice Douglas, and may it

please the Court:
Obviously, this case has a substantial importance of
its own, in light of the added strength it will either give to
the employer or will not.

But our interest, ray interest on

behalf of the AFL-CIO is both that and another, and that is
that in this case the board is operating on the premise that
where there is a policy which has been embodied in the Act in
so: oj res pact

the board can create an unfair labor practice,

Here the policy that the board finds in the Act and
which we don’t dispute and, of course, which this Court dis­
coursed on at length in yesterday's opinion in Bell Aerospace,
is the policy in favor of undivided loyalty of supervisors.
And in order to effectuate that policy, the board would read

36
8(b) (.1) (b) in an extremely expansive way„
Now, this is not the first time that the board has
made tills type of leap from policy to the expansion of an un­
fair labor practice section.

I think it is worth nothing that

at the time the 1947 amendments were being debated, the House
cam© in with what was in essence a laundry list of union unfair
labor practices.

The Senate, in the words of the Senate report,

reduced those to five defined unfair labor practices.

And the

reason that the evolution was as it was was the fact that the
case bill which was the predecessor of the 47 amendments had
been vetoed and Senator Taft was very conscious of the, fact
that he faced another veto and had to get out a bill which would
have a broad enough constituency to get two-thirds plus one.
All these points have been made, and most forcefully,
in our. judgment, in Insurance Agents and again in the.Drivers
Local a •.-•e, in 362 U.S.

In Insurance Agents, the union tactic

there at issue was the slow-down strike, and there can be no
doubt after this Court's reaction to tactics like the sit-down
strike 'and other such tactics, that the policy of the Act does
not favor that type of union economic whip.

The board responded

by reading.into 8(b)(3),which requires that there be bargaining
in good-faith, ah unfair labor practice reaching that tactic,
and this Court responded by reversing the board.
And I think it is very much in point to note one facet
of that opinion which is quoted on pages 15 and 16 of our brief,

37

which is the buff colored brief.

Mr. Justice Brennan was re­

sponding to the argument that since the activity was unpro­
tected, it was proper to make it an unfair labor practice.

And

he said there is little logic in assuming that because Congress
was willing to allow employers to use self-help against, union
tactics, if they were willing to face the economic consequences
of its use.

It also impliedly declared these tactics unlawful •

as..a matter of federal law.

Our problem remains that of con­

struing section 8(b)(3)'s terms, and we do not see how the
availability of self-help to the employer lias anything to do
with the matter.
And I think when we turn to the policy of undivided
loyalty of supervisors, we.find that once again

Congress met

the issue, the issue posed by the Packard case, by giving the
employer a right of self-help.

Section 2(3), 2(11) and 14(a),

where 'this matter was discussed and debated, do not create any
employer rights.

As Mr. Cohen has indicated, what they do is

create a privilege in the employer that he does hot have to
deal with unions as to his supervisors and that he does not

have to bargain collectively with supervisors as to their terms
and conditions of employment, and that the board camtbt make
his refusal to treat supervisors as employees as an unfair

labor practice, and all this to restore the situation before
the Wagner Act.

And we agree that the employer was thereby

given a privilege to require supervisors not to join unions.

38
require them to resign their membership without being subject to
any unfair labor practice charges himself.
But also in the first portion of section 14 it recog­
nises that employers had a right — I don't want to use that
word here - ■ a privilege to allow their supervisors to remain
in the union or to deal with a union about supervisory employee;"
and that was the solution to the conflict of interest problem
that Congress envisaged.
Then let’s turn to 8(b)(1)(b).

In one respect,

Congress was willing to go further than give the employer selfhelp, said that in selecting his representatives for collective
bargaining and griegahce handling fucntions, he could not be
subjected to strikes.
First of all, the main function of that provision was
to deal with multi-employer bargaining, and even there it was
cpmpriraised because the House barred multi -employer bargaining ,
and again the Senate solution was to accord both the — in this
"r

case, both the employers and the union the privj/iegs of continuing ifc., but to say that neither could force the other into that
context.
And the secondary purpose of this was to prevent union
from exerting pressure on employers to select their representa­
tive.

Mr. Cohen has talked about the importance of -«die word

"select."

I would like to talk about the added importance of

the word "representative."

39

If Congress had really

bean focusing on. the conflict

of interest problem that it focused on in 2(3), 2(11) and 14(a),
one would have -thought that

it would have used the same term

in section 8(b)(1)(b) rather than pick out two specific subject
matter areas, because, as the Court of Appeals pointed out,
the board's interpretation means that some supervisors, that
the employer is assured through the board's processes, the
loyalty of some supervisors, but not as to others.

It seems to

us, in light of that, it is more logical to assume that what
Cor-grgcs wan intending was to assure that the employer would
be able to speak through someone who is really his own choice,
just ao the union, in sections 7 and 9, is assured that it will
through a representative of its own choice.

But to move

that,over into a completely different area, namely whether the
1

employer can act through certain agents in getting work done,
.tank arid, file work, as opposed to supervisory work or having
grievances settled or collective bargaining done through his
own people, is quite a leap, a leap which is extremely diffi­
cult we think to secure from the language.
Mien I perform a service in fixing a machine for an
employer, it is very difficult to say that 1 am acting as his
reprou:uitative.

I may be. part of management or whatever, but

I am not act:' ng as his representative for collective bargaining
or the settlement of grievances.
performing that type of work.

I am acting as his agent in

40

If that isn’t true,- it would mean that any employee
who comes back and does the: rank and file work during the strike
thereby ipso facto becomes a management representative under
the board's theory.
Q

Would this position that you just stated now lead

you to. disagj^&e* u«Lth Oakland Mailers?
MR. GOLDs

The position that I am stating now does not

require a disagreement with Oakland Mailers.

Insofar as we are

talking about the meaning of the word "representative,"
>

representative for collective bargaining and grievance settling,
it leaves open the question of whether the board could say that
it was empowered to prevent unions from disciplining individuals
because they had interpreted the agreement in a way which was
inconsistent with the members' interest or had bargained in a
particularly hard way or had pressed a grievance in & particu­
larly hard way.
We are not here asking that Oakland Mailers be re­
versed.

It may be that it should be reversed, but that isn't

the issue here, as we see it.

In the opening of our brief, we

quoted the Chief Justice's remarks in one of the obscenity cases
last year, that the fact that there has been an evolution doesn’t
mean that the final step is right if it was one that never
would have been contemplated in the first place.

We are at the

far end of the spectrum here, and we are simply asking this
Court at this time to hold that the board has made a mistake at

41
this point.
Nov, obviously, the reasoning that is implied will
have an effect on the earlier steps in the evolution, but the
reasoning that I am arguing for now would not require an over­
ruling of Oakland Mailers.
Q

Of course, it strikes me that that one possible

difficulty with your position is if you read the language very
narrowly and sav that the board has virtually no power to ex­
pand on

that leaves you way back before Oakland Mailers.

That may be a perfectly tenable po sition.

But if you say the

board has some power to expand on it and can go as far as
Oakland Mailers, it seems to me it is rather hard to say why
they shouldn’t, go the last step.
MR. GOLD:

Well, I think the reason they can’t go the

last step is the argument that I started off with, and that is
'that whatever power the board may have to interpret and expand
a provision, it can’t interpret or expand provisions into an
interdictions! prohibition of the use of a lawful economic
weapon during a strike unless there is a specific warrant in
the legislative history, because this was the most sensitive
area of the whole statute, arid the very point of Insurance
. ■.gents and Curtis Brothers is the point I am just making, the
point i'

t is embodied in section 13, and therefore we need not

t :kc the position that there is no room for expansion.

Wa

simply take the position here that there is no room for an

42
expansion whereby the board would interfere with the use of this
economic weapons, when there is no indication that Congress in­
tended to create a right in the employer to use anyone, ’whether
they are labor, suprvisory employees or representatives or any­
one else to break a strike.

Now, that doesn't mean that the

board can't go from the word "select" to a broader terra in order
to safeguard the employer's interest in being able to speak
through a representative of his own choosing.

That simply

leaves that open.
What I am concentrating on here is the use of the word
"representative," and the use of the — of the misuse, in our
judgment, of the word "representative, and the misuse in the way
which strikes from, the union's hands an otherwise permissible
economic weapon in support of a lawful economic strike, because
8(b)(1)(b) at its broadest, no matter how you read "select,"
would you seem to interdict union economic weapons that are
improper, and the impropriety of the use of economic weapons
as justed by the object.

If the object is to prevent the

employer from choosing his own collective bargaining or griev­
ance handling representatives, then that is the area that the
section —
Q

Putting it the other way, Mr. Gold, what you

re saying is, I gather, that Oakland Mailers has nothing
whatever to do with an effect upon the right to strike?
MR. GOLD;

That is right.

43
Q

And In this Instance it has very much to do with

. and therefore it runs afoul of the Insurance Agents?
MR. GOLD;

May I interrupt, while I have you interrupted?

MR. GOLD:
Q

Yes.

How, what do you say that this kind of discipline

— no, giving it the more expansive reading, in this situation
dees adversely affect the right to strike?
MR, GOLD;
Q

Well, the right to strike —

Incidentally, this all comes out of the guarantee

of section 13?
MR. GOLD;

Right.

44
Q

Yes.

MR. GOLD;

The adverse effect here is that, as the

Court recognised in Allis-Chalmers, the use of union discipline
over members is an important, ingredient in terms of the effec­
tiveness of the union to strike.

That is the use of discipline

is an economic weapon in support of the strike.
0

Even though it is post-strike usually?

MR. GOLD s
Q

Right.

in fact, I gather here these fines were levied

after the strikes were all over, weren’t they?
MR. GOLD;

As is normally the case, the use of a

power of that kind is intended to influence conduct, and the
very fact that it is there is an ingredient in the strike,

if

it was known that that could not be done, the strike would net
have that supportive weapon and, as I understand it, that was
your reasoning in Allis-Chalmers and the reasoning of course in
the Boeing case.

So certainly, both sides view the role that

the supervisor will play in doing rank and file work as an
economic weapon.

The employer wants to use his supervisor just

as h© wants to use those rank and file people who are willing
to corue back to work to break the strike.

Insofar as it is

done by using rank and file work, the union in this esse is
claiming that.it has a countervailing weapon, just as it would
for employees, namely threatening them with discipline as
members.

45
Has the board indicated that the union could or

q

could not expel the supervisor for crossing the line?
?4P.. GOLD:

My understanding is that we cannot even

sxpel him
Oh, really?

q

MR. GOLD:

Both of thera involved in this case, yes

Is that both expressly involved in the case?

o

MR. GOLD:

In Florida Power & Light, they were ex

pulsion.
As well as fines?

q

MR. GOLD:

So not only has the board arrived in a

situation in which -this weapon to support the union to strike
is struck from its hands, but it has also forced the union to
keep these people in.
q

i thought Mr. Come indicated that as a general

policy at least a union could insist that supervisors get out
c,r the union when they become supervisors?
MR, GOLD:

Well, I take it that the distinction he

would make would be that, while as a general policy they can,
they can't do it as a disciplinary act.
q

And that if they were going to really

11 rhwy

are really serious about it, they would have to expel e^-wy™
body, all the supervisors, not just the ones who crossed the
picket line?
MR. GOLD:

Yes.

I am saying that can or cannot have

a disciplinary connotation, depending on the time it is em­
ployed. the circumstances, what is said and so on, and I cer­
tainly can see that distinction.
I started to get back to the point, the meaning of the
word "representative," to make the point that section 8(b)(1)(b)
reaches people that would never be thought to have been a prob­
lem or covered by 2(3), 2(11) and 14(a).

Many of the early

cases involved union attempts to have the employer replace the
attorney he is using to bargain his collective agreement.

Nov;,

X don’t think that Congress really, when it was treating the

•..divided loyalty problem in 2(3), 2(11) and 14(a), had any
idea that it was getting into that.

X think that there is

every indication that it looked at the two different sections
>r the two different complexes of sections, 2(3), 2(11) and
14 (\) on the one hand, and 8(b)(1) (b) as very different, and
addressed to different problems, and we tried to indicate the
lines, the clearest line that we see.
I would like to just tick off certain indicia that we
think support our view that 8 (b)(1)(b) cannot ba stretched over
to the area of union discipline of supervisors who do rank and
file work.
First of all, we have Senator Taft getting up on the

floor and saying that this section is not perhaps of great im­
portance.

Given the bite over the status of supervisors, and

given the meticulous care with which the use of economic weapons

47
is treated in section 8(b)(4) and elsewhere, we do not think
that it is appropriate, if we are going to try to recreate the
gamut of values which were present at the time to answer the
question that Congress perhaps didn't focus on explicitly, to
use Mr. Gome’s words, to

attribute to Senator Taft and the

other proponents of the bill a diversionary action whereby they
appear to only create a privilege in the employer in 2(3),
2 (.11) and 14 (a) , and then bring the board back into the whole
are.-.. - and not just for one very limited proposition through
section 8(b) (1) (b) .
Secondly, I think it is perfectly plain that everyone
who was-i act:'
; •

in the formation of the 1947 amendments knew
;

\y

that unions disciplined members, including supervisory members,
when they break strikes.
Q

Did 8(b)(1)(b) come chronologically after 2(3),

2(11) and 14(a)?
MR. GOLD;

Yes, the evolution was that the case bill

treated, the'Packard problem in terms of status...

The House bill

treated1 the supervisory issue in terns of status, and there
was no 8(b) (1)(b) probably because they barred multi-employer
bargaining completely and, as the Senate report indicates,
re.illy the major function of 8(b) (1) (b) was to deal with the
mult.i-oraployar bargaining problem and not at all in this area,
which has grown and over-shadowed the other completely since

1968.

48
As I started to say, it was understood in Congress
that unions exercise this type of disciplinary power, both over
members and supervisors.

Mr. Justice Brennan has noted the
\

congressional' understanding as to members and the legislative
history'of 14(a), where they talk about in the House report,
■yl ,.re they talk about the fact that unions use -their influence
he have organised supervisors not work during strikes.

This

indicates that, they understood that this wasn't something
that Was only done against rank'and file members, but it was
done against supervisory members as well.

The union treates,

by and large, it has treated the supervisory member as being
just as much subject to —
Q

In the legislative history, they usa some Jones

& Laughlin Mine example —

That*s right.

supervisors which used to leave the mine or

something?
MR. GOLD:

Right, and they quoted —• we quoted it in

our brief, if I can find it -— I'm sorry, I can't find it right
low — I apologise, I don't want to waste any time — but we
quoted a passage from the House report where they comment on
the fact that the rank and file union — I mean the supervisory
union at Ford entered into an agreement whereby its people
would not work during a rank and file strike.

They understood

that unions were going to use their force, what force they had,

49
tc. keep supervisors from, doing this work.

And nevertheless,

v: we say, tie only explicit indication that they wish to deal
v?ith the conflict of interest problem was to give the employer
a privilege.

Starting from the Packard case, they viewed it

V- a matter of status and deprived the supervisors of the pro­
tections of the Act, gave the employer a privilege, but did not
i ..dicate that supervisory members would have any special
status as members of the union, immune from discipline or that
the board was to be brought back into this whole area rather
than to protect the right of the employer to speak through his
own representative in section 8(b) (1) (b).
Q

Well, the union of course, explicitly, under

section 13, has the right to strike, but surely the employer
!:■,.).s thr right to use self-help and to do whatever he can to
1 rap the business running during a strike, isn't he?
MR, GOLD:
o

Yes, I think that —

And indeed has the right of certain circumstances

it, such as American Shipbuilding?
MR. GOLD:

That is correct, as you stated in American

Shipbuilding and Brown Food.
Q

It seems to me that, really, this part of your

argument is almost questioned begging.

That is the issue here,

isn't it?
MR. GOLD;

Well, no, we don’t think it is question

begging because there is nothing that we are arguing for that

He has the power to order

the supervisors to work, to order them to quit the union in
order to ■— so that he will be sure they are not subject to any
countervailing pressure.

The union has the attractiveness of

keeping union membership and what other discipline, and there
is a tug-of-war and it is no different than the tug-of-war that
goes on as to the employee during the strike.

In many ways,

this is a harsh process, but this is what Congress decreed.

But what the board is trying to do is enhance: the
employer's economic weapon by depriving the union of its, rather
than according with what Congress would have seemed to have
done, which is to give both sides certain powers and privileges
but not. to create any federal rights 'or any federal■ prohibitions
in this area when we are dealing with supervisors working
during the strike.

And with all deference, I d6n*t think it

is.question begging, I think that what we have in this area is
the whole sensitive subject of the extent to which these five
carefully limited, at that time, five carefully limited union
unfair labor practices can be expanded so that an economic
weapon which Congress seems to have understood is there, namely
the right to discipline supervisor members, is taken from the
union in favor of a policy which was effectuated in another way,

51
not effectuated by creating a federal right, not effectuated so
far as we believe from anything in the language or legislative
history by creating a federal prohibition in 8(b)(1)(fo).
We do not argue with the fact that the employer has
privileges here and that he can do what he can given the prac­
tical situation to keep his business running.

That is one of

But the union can do

what it can, except insofar as Congress specifically said no,
to make its strike effective.
Q

And what this case is about is what can the

union do?
MR. GOLD%

That's right, and we are saying that there

is nothing specific here that you have to take the word "select"
and take the word "representative" and take all that the silence
that we. think here is pregnant with meaning, and take it into
— and turn all thafcinto a section which says that a union can­
not discipline a supervisor member who acts as an employer's
agent, not as his representative, and goes in and does struck
work.

And we think that that is stretching the language and

ignoring the legislative history to a point which cannot be
done given the background of this Act, and given the admonition
contained in section 13 which has been given flesh and force in
cases such as Insurance Agents, the Drivers case, and in
American Shipbuilding, and in H. K. Porter.

Do you have *a few things to say, Mr. Come?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP NORTON J. COME, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
MR. COME;
Q

I just have one or two brief comments.

Are yon. going to cover the Insurance Agents —

MR. COME;

Yes, that is what I intended to address

myself to.
Ws believe that there is no impairment of the right to
strike in the impermissible sense or, to use Mr. Justice
Stewart's point, that is the issue here.
In Allis-Chalmers, what you had was the right of the
union to discipline employee movers for breaking a strike.
There is no question -hat the right to maintain the solidarity
of employes members is very vital to the right to strike.

How­

ever, what you have here is the discipline of supervisor members
and, supervisory personnel have not traditionally been picket
line allies of the rank and file? rather, as the dissent in
Packard noted, in industrial conflicts, they are allied with
management.
So therefore, in reading 8(b)(1)(b) the way the board
has in this case, you are not impairing the union's interest
to the same extent as you would had you read 8(b)(1)(a) to
prohibit them from fining or disciplining employee strike
breakers

53
On the other hand, to fail to read 8(b)(1)(b) as the
board has done here would substantially impair the employer’s
interest, which Congress clearly intended to protect, namely
of insuring the undivided loyalty of his supervisors during a
strike no less than at any other time.
Now, I think that the union's concession that 8(b)(1)
(b) can be read to encompass the Oakland Mailers situation
carries us a long way along the road to sustaining the board’s
position because it shows that Congress did not, as the union
argues in much of its brief, and as the court below, the
majority, argues in much of its opinion, intend to leave the
employer only with the option of insisting that his supervisors
get out of the union, and if they didn’t get out of the union,
that he then had to accept divided loyalty, because if Oakland
Mailers is correct, the employer is protected against union
discipline which interferes with the performance of that super­
visor’s management functions.

&nd the question that we than

come down to is 'whether or not the board is reasonable in
concluding that the performance of rank and file work during a
strike is a proper function that management can require of its
supervisors and whether disciplining them for the performance
of that function is likely to have a spillover effect that is
going to impair that supervisor's performance of grievance
adjustment and other duties.
We submit that the board was reasonable in so

54
concluding, even though another conclusion might have been
equally

reasonable, and therefore the board should be sustained

in these case.
Thank you.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS;

Thank you, gentlemen.
