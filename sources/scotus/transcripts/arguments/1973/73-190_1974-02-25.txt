MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We'll hear arguments

first this morning in No. 73-190, Beilis against the United
States.
Mr. Sarner, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD SARNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE PETITIONER
MR. SARNER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
•

The issue presented here is whether the Fifth

Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies to
the books and records of a small, closely held partnership.
In our petition for certiorari we said that the
Court never directly decided this issue.

In retrospect, I'm

satisfied that the Court did decide it in the Boyd case,
decided in favor of the position of the petitioner, and that
this has been reaffirmed by the formulation that this Court
enunciated in White.
The case is brought up in the context of a small,
three-man law partnership.

Petitioner is in lawful

possession of the books and records.

The subpoena is addressed

to him, from

Thus we have here the

the Federal Grand Jury.

ingredient of personal compulsion, which this Court found
lacking in Couch.
As a co-owner in rightful possession of the books,

4

we submit that the petitioner's Fifth Amendment claim against
self-incrimination must be recognized unless there is something
significantly unique about the nature of the books and records
of a law partnership, to require a difference in result.
And we also submit that there is not anything unique about
these records.
Your Honors will note that the government is quick
and perhaps, we think, a little too quick to point out that
although Boyd involved a subpoena addressed to a partnership,
to which the partner responded, the Court says — according
to the government — says that this was ignored by the Boyd
court, that the crucial fact of the punishable aspect of the
case was disregarded.
Now, if Your Honors will note, Boyd did involve a
charge by the government that some 35 cases of plate glass
had been imported to this country from England by the firm,
the partnership firm of E. A. Boyd and Sons, by means of a
fraudulent or false invoice. And a subpoena was directed to
the partnership, providing for the production of an invoice
from the English seller of this glass, showing the quantity
and quality and value of glass contained in 29 of these 35
cases.
Now, emphasis, Your Honor?, by the Boyd court that
a man's private papers cannot be used to establish a criminal
charge against him, where the private paper was the invoice of

5

the foreign shipper.

Hardly, as the government characterizes

it in their brief, a partner’s private written statement.
This was an invoice from the foreign shipper.
It first indicates that the private papers referred
to in Boyd didn't refer to the manner of the preparation or
writing, or the intimacy of the information contained therein,
but, rather, to the ownership aspect;

first, that this was

considered to be the private paper of the claimant of the
partnership, and the partner standing in the shoes of the
partnership.
Of course, as Wiis on points out, it was never
required for Fifth Amendment privilege, that the documents
be written by the person himself.

In fact, in Wilson, it was

emphasized that the mere fact that the officer of the
corporation may have written in his own handwriting the
incriminating material in the corporate books, in no way it
would either enlarge or take away from the privilege.
But, Your Honors, we submit it's too much to
suggest, as I think the government does, that the Boyd court
ignore the other aspect of private papers, which was involved
in Boyd.

That is, the private papers concept as opposed to

those quasi-publiq records required by law to be kept for
regulatory purposes, justifying public scrutiny in, you knov?,
some area of public domain.
Now, it should be noted that the rationale, as we

6
understand it, for denying Fifth Amendment protection to
corporate books and records lies in the visitorial powers
doctrine.

The interests of the States, of the government, to

inspect and regulate its State-created creatures, as
exemplified, really, by the required records doctrine.
Thus the Boyd court was well aware what this Court, in Hale vs.
Henkel, ten years later, only ten years later, held about the
required records doctrine, when the Boyd court itself
observed that what was involved in Boyd, in the private
papers aspect, was completely different from — this is the
quotation —■ the supervision which was authorized to be exercised
by revenue officers over the manufacture or custody of
excisable articles and the entry thereof in books required by
law to be kept for their inspection.
Thus, Boyd specifically recognized the distinction
between private papers of a partnership and the required
records of a corporation, with partnership papers assimilated
to privately or individually owned.
Furthermore, Your Honors, we submit that the White
formulation in essence adopts this exact approach.
Now, White recognized the necessity for governmental
power to regulate and inspect economically influential,
unincorporated associations, such as the union involved
therein.
Despite, the non-applicability of the visitorial powers

7
doctrine.
The privilege applying to recast the White formula­
tion in the affirmative rather than in the negative, where
the organization has a character so personal — that means
substantially identical — in scope of membership and
activities that it can be said to embody or represent the
purely private or personal, that is, the intimate, identical
interest of its constituent.
QUESTION;

Mr. Sarner, one time Mr. Kolsby and Mr.

Wolf had consented to the production of the records, had they
not?
MR. SARNER;

No, sir. Your Honor, that's — that

was the figment of the imagination of trial attorney, who
prepared a memorandum of law prior to any evidentiary hearing.
QUESTION;

Whose trial attorney?

MR. SARNER; The government's trial attorney, which
was submitted prior to the evidentiary hearing before the
District Court.
The- record, as Your Honors will note in my reply
brief, in which I refer to the citation, the pages of the
record, on page 2 of the reply brief;

A. 32, 35, 40, A. 55.

All these factual allegations were specifically denied.
In fact, in my argument before the Court of Appeals,
Your Honor, I was trying to indicate to the court what their
case did not involve; it did not in any way involve a wrongful

8

possession of books as opposed to the other partners.

And

the Court of Appeals specifically addressed itself to say that
the sole issue — and if you will look at page 15 of the
Appendix —
QUESTION: So you are stating now that there is no
misunderstanding whatsoever between the three former partners?
MR. SARNER:

No misunderstanding whatsoever between

the three partners —
QUESTION: And never has been?
MR. SARNER: And there never has been. And the books
and records are in the possession of Mr. Beilis, the petitioner,
with the blessings, the full blessings of his other partners.
And the Court of Appeals so found, in saying that the issue is
whether a partner is simply in lawful possession of the books
and records.

Assuming that —

QUESTION:

Well, I think there was never any question

about his being in lawful possession.

I think the others, as

I read the record, •—

Is it an income tax investigation?

That hasn’t been fully disclosed, but we do

understand it to be an income tax investigation.
QUESTION: But you are stating here and now there is

no bad feeling between the three former partners?

Honor may be referring to, that the possession was so
constructive or fleeting in one of the partners; but we don't
think we have to meet that problem in our case.

QUESTION:

On your submission, the critical fact is

MR. SARNER:

Personal possession plus the rightful

’— rightful possession.

Personal possession, rightful

possession, and the nature of the entity being such that it is
a private, intimate, closely held group.
QUESTION:

rightful possession to the records of the firm, as against
other members of the firm?
MR. SARNER;

dispute, Your Honor, the -- as I understand the State law

QUESTION;

And —

So they, in effect, would vote that

MR* SARMERs

No, Your Honor.

The government tried

to suggest that the legislative history of subchapter (k)

f the

Uniform Partnership Act, distinguishing between aggregate
and entity theory would be a fairly controlling portion.
We cite, I think the most definitive statement on
this law, on this point in the reply brief.
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's decision in the
D. II, Shapiro case, I quoted fully on page 7, and let me just
read the last sentence:
"We could multiply authorities, but we must hold
that the weight of authority in this Commonwealth is to the
effect that a partnership is treated as an aggregate of
individuals and not as a separate entity."
And of course on that basis, that point —
QUESTION: Was that in your reply brief?

Do we

have that?
MR. SARNER:

Yes, I filed the reply brief.

It

wasn’t filed — it was filed by Friday, within the time after
I had received the government's brief, which was a little late.
QUESTION:
your position goes

Now, let me see if I understand how far

12

If one of the other partners had released this
voluntarily to the government, do I understand you to say that
your client would have no complaint, or at least no complaint
V

that he would —MR# SARNER: Well, I would say, Mr. Chief Justice,
that if one of the other partners had released this, we would
be faced pretty much with the Couch type of case.
QUESTION: Well, then, hasn't that somewhat undermined
your idea

that this is a matter of personal, private papers?
MR. SARNER:
QUESTION*

No, I —- I —
If someone else, if a third person can

waive the right for your client,

then what's left of your

Boyd claim?
MR. SARNER:

No. The point would be this.

In

situations where somebody else was in possession, then if one
of the other partners was in possession, I see that that's no
different than if the accountant is in possession of my papers?
he doesn't waive my claim.

But the compulsion is directed

against the one in possession.
Unless Your Honors feel that this is the situation
and we can't — I mean I may retrench a little from my answer
to Mr. Justice Powell, but you have here a situation where
possibly the possession of someone else is considered to be
the rightful possession of another, as indicated in the foot­
note, so that it's a form of constructive possession.

13

I didn’t think we’d have to meet that problem in
this particular case, because we have the man against whom
the subpoena is issued in possession of the books and records,
QUESTION;

Let’s track this down on a practical

basis.
MR. SARNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
One partner of the partnership, whether

it's three or a hundred partners, one partner has possession
of the records, the partnership has presumably made its
partnership return, and Internal Revenue is checking out the
information.
The man in possession, the partner in possession
refuses to give up in response to a request directed to yet
another partner, in the process of checking that partner's
return.

He can refuse for any reason to give it up? is that

right?
MR. SARNER:

Well — I don’t know whether we have

to go that far, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, that he can
refuse for any reason to give it up.
QUESTION:

Suppose it was one of the other partners

here, that’s what I'm driving at; one of the other partners,
not Mr. Beilis, whose personal returns, individual returns
were being checked, and as part of that process they very
frequently want to check the partnership records.
Mr, Beilis says, No, if I give those records in

14
connection with my partner's tax inquiry, that may lead to
some incrimination of me.
He can do that, can he?
MR. SARNER:

Yes.

Yes, I would say that if Mr.

Beilis takes the position that because there's an investigation
of one of his other partners, that his records, the partnership
records in his possession may tend to incriminate him because
of items which may be in there or not, in their accepting
transactions for clients, I would definitely say that the
partner can refuse to return them.
QUESTION :
might do, then?

What do you suppose the Internal Revenue

Do they not have some rather harsh weapons,

in terms of their powers?
MR. SARNER: They have whatever weapons are available
against all taxpayers.

They don't have the weapon, Your Honor,

to make a taxpayer divulge his purely private books, books
which he holds in a purely personal capacity.

And if you

assume — let me, may I just — I think I answered Your Honor's
observation.
If you assume that there is any group activity,
any regularly conducted group activity, which is protected
where the books and records are protected, where two or more
people are associated together, then one of the members must
be in possession of the books, in order to assert the
privilege

15
And, therefore, if yon assume, and the government,
Your Honor, does assume that there are situations where you
can have group activity, some association, and the books and
records are protected.

In their petition — in their brief

in opposition to our petition for cert, they said they thought
it might be the family partnership, where you have a father
and son or brother and sister partnership.
They completely discarded that formulation now, and
come up with the startling proposition that it is only where
you have the informal criminal conspiracy, where no one is
said to own the books, where possession is nine-tenths of
the law, and where, therefore, the one in possession of these
books in a criminal conspiracy has as much claim, or better
claim than the others; this is a formulation which has been
rejected by every Court of Appeals to which it's been
addressed, holding that the books and records of narcotics
or gambling enterprises are the —
QUESTION;

Mi at do you object to, the admissibility

of the contents of the records or are you objecting to your
having to produce them, and by the act of producing them you
verify, identify the records?
MR. SARMER:

I mean, obviously we would like to

be able to have the two prongs to our objection, the Schmerber
case suggests, by Mr. Justice Brennan, that asking us to
produce these books authenticates them and therefore is the

IS
feestimony that these are the books required under the subpoena,
and therefore that this is the compulsion which is protected
against by the Fifth Amendment,,
QUESTIONS

Even — even if otherwise they v?ould

be admissible and not subject to that privilege?
MR. SARNERs

Well — I say that's the — that would

be the rationale, as I understand it, of Schmerber, where
you wouldn't have testimony or content to the books, but the
books clearly are testimonial and communicative.

So we think

the contents are —
QUESTIONs

But it could be — it could be that if

the books were otherwise before the Grand Jury, they would be
admissible over your

over your Fifth Amendment objection,

and still you'd have a Fifth Amendment objection

to you,

yourself, producing them?
MR. SARNERs

That's -- that's perfectly true.

That could very well be.
QUESTIONS
MR. SARNERs
QUESTION:

Well now, which —
Well, we —
“>** I mean, are you riding both horses

here?
MR. SARNERs

Yes, indeed,

I mean, we rode

we're

riding primarily, I will say, we are riding primarily the
contents of -the books, that the books are incriminating,
and therefore to compel us to bring in the incriminating

17
material in the books violates the Fifth Amendment, and in
addition, of course, since it's addressed to us, and the
subpoena is addressed to us, we must comply and authenticate
and say that these are the books and records which are
required, then, in that sense, Mr, Justice,
QUESTION;

Well, the latter — the objection to

producing them yourself would be obviated if there were, say,
a search warrant and the books were seized in your house,
in your client's house and taken to court. Then you'd be
left with one — one objection,
MR, SARNER; Well, that's — yes.

That's the —

what the government tried to raise in Hill vs, Philpott in
its petition for cert to this Court, and which was rejected
by the Circuit Court of Appeals in Hill vs. Philpott, which
I think was cited with some approval by Mr. Justice Powell
in the Couch case.
QUESTION;

Mr. Samer, does your position mean or

suggest a way, then, to make partnership books completely
inaccessible?

Get them in the hands of one of the partners

and
MR. SARNER:

Well, Your Honor, my position is that

there is no valid distinction between partnership books,
at least of this closely held partnership that we have here,
and individually owned books of the sole proprietor.
Mow, the individually owned books —

18

QUESTION? Well, how do you define a small, closely
held partnership?

Some three-men partnerships are pretty

substantial.
MR. SARNER:
QUESTION:
MR. SARNER:

Well, you -- I think you —
Is that a factor —
I think it is. Hie Courts of Appeals

have had no real difficulty with that, with, that concept.
You have the Mai Brothers, you have the Silverstein case,
where you have limited partners with sixty, seventy limited
partners, activities of capitalization of several millions of
dollars, you admit here, of an economically influential,
unincorporated association.

Mr. Sarner, ~
Yes, sir.
-— after Justice Blackmun’s earlier

question to you about whether Mr, Wolf and Mr, Kolsby had
consented, I went back to the Appendix and I see on A13, that
the government in its memorandum alleged that authorization
was given by Mr. Herbert F. Kolsby and Edward L, Wolf for the
Grand Jury to examine those records.
Then on A22 there is your motion to quash the
subpoena, and on A24 is a memorandum in support of the motion.
Now, in one of those two documents that you filed,
did you traverse that allegation?

MR. SARHERs

No, Your Honor, because those documents

were filed prior to the evidentiary hearing also.

All this

was —
QUESTION: Well, where is the denial of the govern­
ment’s alle gation?
MR# SARNER: Well, the government’s allegation is
only a memorandum of law.

There was no factual basis for it,

but the denials are several, Your Honors, and they’re
specified in the reply brief.

A32, A55 — in fact we say

that they, the government,"haven't even come forward with

government whether it wanted to proceed, —

On A32, for example, scanning that page,

I don’t see anything there, and perhaps I'm overlooking some­
thing, but —
MR. SARNER:

to on A32, Your Honor.

"In addition,

factual matters which we claim are not correct."

specific allegation?
MR. SARNER;

Well, it wasn't a specific — it wasn't

QUESTION;

No, but it was a very specific allegation.

Let me read it to you.

"Authorization was given by Mr. Herbert

F. Kolsby and Edward L. Wolf on behalf of Kolsby and Wolf for
the federal Grand Jury to examine those records."
Now, do you, anywhere in the Appendix, specifically
deny that?
MR. SARNER;

Yes.

MR, SARNER:

QUESTION; To go back to my other question •—
MR, SARNER;
QUESTION;
and that is;

Yes, Your Honor?
— which I think has not been answered,

whether your posture here opens the way to

a complete closure of any partnership books in any case?
MR, SARNER;

Mo, it doesn't open the way to a

complete closure of any partnership books, it opens the way

23

to the complete closure of partnership books which are of a
small, closely held partnership in the possession of one of
the partners, just like the individual books of the sole
proprietor are.
QUESTION; Well, isn't the way, then, to put the
books in the possession of a — one of the partners?
MR. SARNER;

If the books ~~ if the books are in

the possession of one of the partners, and if it’s an
intimate close relationship, as this law partnership is,
then the books are protected from scrutiny by subpoena.
The same as your individual books —
QUESTION;

I asked again, and I still get a

negative answer from you.

I ask again;

does this not open

the way to a complete barring of partnership books to any
inve s tigation?
MR. SARNER:

If they are in the hands of one of

the partners.
QUESTION;

What if one of the other partners

involved in a tax case needs them by way of defense to a
government claim on a deficiency assessment?

Is he barred

from getting them, too?
MR. SARNER;

MR. SARNER;

No, I assume that he can get them

from Mr. Beilis.

I mean, --

QUESTION; Even in the face of a claim on Mr. Beilis*
part that turning them over to IRS for the other partner
will expose him to criminal prosecution?
MR. SARNER:

Well, Your Honor, what you’re —

what you're asking me to speculate on is the fact that once
you have two people associated in some joint enterprise,
you can never have any Fifth Amendment protection,
think that's — that's so.

I don't

I think that what you have here

is the situation that the mere fact that one of the partners is
entitled to get them from the other partner, in now way means
that the government is entitled to get. them from the other
partner.
And it's never been equated to the fact that because
there are other ways that the material can be obtained, that
therefore the Fifth Amendment privilege doesn't apply with
the one in possession.
May I just —
QUESTION: Well, that doesn't ~ the fact that you
might be able to just object to producing them, because it
authenticates the records, that wouldn't be ~ that wouldn't

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ, ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The records at issue here are the financial
records of a law partnership.

The production order# which is

set forth on page 116 of the Appendix, excludes any individual
client files, containing any advice or confidential relation­
ships between the attorney and attorney and client.

They are

essentially — essentially we are dealing here with a
production order, enforcing a Grand Jury subpoena for the
financial records of the partnership, the receipts and
disbursements, records of that kind.

26

The claim is that the partner in possession is
entitled to assert the Fifth Amendment claim that this would
violate the provision stating that no person shall be compelled
in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.
This is a provision, the background of which has
been reviewed by the Court many times in recent years.

Last

term, in the Couch opinion, the Court noted that historically
the privilege was to protect the individual from resort by
the State to the expedient of compelling incriminating
evidence from the individual's own mouth, as the Court put
it in Couch.
And in light of the language of the amendment and
its historical background, the view has been expressed by
members of the Court, including Mr. Justice Stewart, that
perhaps the privilege might have been intended to be
restricted to the protection of testimony in judicial
proceedings, and only to bar the compulsion of the testimony
But in the Bovd case, in 116 U.S., the Court did
extend the privilege also to compulsion of the production of
a person's papers in his possession.
Now, it was only —- the .issue in Boyd didn't —- the
parties in Boyd and the court in Boyd didn't address the
problem of the relationship between an individual and an
association or group with whom he was related; the entire
issue is whether the privilege would be extended beyond

27

testimony or compulsion.
And as the Court noted in the Shapiro case, the
government in essence contended that the privilege didn’t
extend to In Rem proceedings of any kind» that it only
extended to in personam proceedings.
The fact that these were partnership records in the
Boyd case simply wasn't discussed, either by the parties or
in the Court’s opinion, which treated them as Hr. Boyd's
personal papers, and several times in the principal passages
of the Boyd opinion, the Court referred to these as personal
papers, as it has in subsequently referring to the Boyd
holdings in United States v. White, and also in the Couch
case last term.
It was only after Boyd was decided and the privilege
was thus extended that the issue arose as to the records of
entities other than natural individuals, and the rights of
individuals who are parts of those entities.
And throughout that entire series of cases, the
Court has been very conscious of the basic concept that's
implicit in the history of the amendment, that was also
restated last term in the Couch case, that in its nature
the privilege is an intimate and personal one.

And even

in the context of its extension to the production of papers,
or perhaps of other effects, this personal element of the
privilege and the personal delimitation of the privilege has

28

been emphasized*

And, accordingly, in the series of cases

beginning with Hale v„ Henkel,

through United States v» White

and its progeny, the Court first held that the privilege is
not available to a corporation or to an unincorporated
organization of any kind, although there was no specific
discussion of partnerships; but the rationale of the White
case, which extended this, was that the privilege does not
extend to, quote, "the records of any organization, whether it
be incorporated or not",

unquote, but that it is, quote,

"limited to its historic function of protecting only the
natural individual from compulsion incrimination through
his own testimony or personal records»"
Now, there is a possible limitation on that
principle expressed in dictum in the White case, to which I
will return in a moment»
The other aspect involved in this series of cases,
and the slightly more difficult aspect, in light of the Boyd
holding, is what aJ?out the individual through vhom the State
seeks to compel the production, the government seeks to
compel the production of the group’s records; isn't he being
forced to come forward in producing them and identify and
authenticate what might incriminate him, and doesn't that
run into the essence of the Boyd holding.
Or as it was re-expressed not long ago by the Court
in Schmerber v. California, that the privilege extends not only

29

to testimony but also to responses, which are themselves
communications, such as the production of one's papers like
in the Boyd case.
Well, the Court has rejected that argument in the
context of compulsory production by an individual who is
holding papers in a representative capacity, so long as the
production order requires him to do no more than produce
papers that he is holding in that fashion.

We're not dealing

here with a situation where the production order says that
he's to produce such records of the partnership as will show
that you, Isadore Beilis, under-reported your income tax.
So that the production would constitute more of a communica­
tion —■
QUESTION:
MR. WALLACE:

You say the court rejected it?
Well, the court has rejected the —

QUESTION: What's the case?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, the first case was Wilson, y.
^

»

the United States, where the question came up in the context
of corporate records, and the custodian holding corporate
records.

In Ilale y, Henkel, which was 201 U.S. , the custodian

of the corporate records had been granted immunity, so the
question didn’t arise.

The sole issue was whether the corporate

records themselves were privileged.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. WALLACE: And the Court held that they were not.

30

And then, in the Wilson case, in 221 U.S.,
QUESTION:

Didn't the Court hold, really, that the

corporation didn't have any Fifth Amendment privilege against
compulsory self-incrimination.
MR. WALLACE:

It did in Hale vP Henkel.

QUESTION: Right.

So that's a wholly different —

MR. WALLACE: Well, the question in the Wilson case
is whether the custodian could claim that his producing the
records would tend to incriminate him, because the act of
production would identify and authenticate the records, and
the records -QUESTION:

I thought he was given immunity.

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION;

That’s what —

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That was in Hale v. Henkel<, —

— Mr. Justice.

I thought that was the case you were just

talking about.
MR. WALLACE:

No, now I've gone on to the Wilson

case, which is in 221 U.S., in which the custodian made the
claim that he could assert the privilege and not produce the
records because their production would incriminate him.
And the Court rejected that claim, in an opinion
by Chief Justice Hughes during his earlier tenure as an
Associate Justice on the Court.

And the rationale of its

rejection is summarized in a quotation that's on page 17 of

31

our brief*

And this is, I think, the most precisely that

the Court has addressed this issue in the context of these
cases:
"The fundamental ground of decision in this class
of cases, is that where, by virtue of their character and
the rules of law applicable to them, the books and papers are
held subject to examination by the demanding authority, the
custodian has no privilege to refuse production although
their contents tend to incriminate him.

In assuming their

custody he has accepted the incident obligation to permit
inspection."
And that —
QUESTION: But you wouldn't suggest that — however,
that whether you're obligated to produce them or not, that
at a criminal trial the defendant could be called to the
stand to identify these records that he's produced.
MR. WALLACE:

I would not suggest that the Curcio-*

case seems to suggest the contrary.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

In 354 U.S., this Court —
Well, if you respond to a subpoena and

produce records that are described in such and such a way,
aren't you authenticating them in that respect?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that is what the Court has

emphasized as what seems to be the basic rationale that

32

remains of the; Boyd holding.

It v/as restated again just last

term in Couch, quoting from the White case.
QUESTION: Well, how does that score with Wilson?
What do you say WiIs on holds there?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, Wilson has created an exception

to this rationale for anyone holding records in a representative capacity.

This exception was reiterated in United

States v. White» with respect to association records.

And

the custodian in that case of the labor union records, and
the Court there — I'm quoting on page 699 of Volume 322 —
put it this way:

That individuals, when acting as representa­

tives of a collective group, cannot be said to be exercising
their personal rights and duties, nor to be entitled to their
purely personal privileges; rather# they assume the rights#
duties, and privileges of the artificial entity or association
of which they are agents or officers, and they are bound by
its obligations.

In their official capacity, therefore,

they have no privilege against self-incrimination.
At least to the extent of having to comply with the
production order, when they are the custodian of the records.
That seems to be the basic rationale of this series
of cases, and I think in light of the Couch, in particular#
which holds that financial records of this kind, if properly
secured by the government, are admissible in evidence over a
Fifth Amendment claim by their owner.

The rationale about

33

authentication and. identification of the records becomes
really what is left of the Boyd holding, as I understand
it.
QUESTION:

Well, in the Couch case, —

MR. WALLACE:

It isn't that the record themselves

can't be introduced against the person.
QUESTION:

If I may interrupt you, Mr, Wallace.

In the Couch case, was there any suggestion that the records
in that case would have been producable if it had been the
accountant who was asserting Fifth Amendment privilege?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Well, that -- there was no —

He was custodian of the records, was

he not?
MR. WALLACE;

He was the — he had them in his

possession, —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WALLACE:

— yes, sir.

QUESTION: And there's no suggestion in that case
that the — that he could not have asserted a Fifth Amendment
privilege, is there?
MR. WALLACE:

No, he did not assert a Fifth

Amendment privilege —■
QUESTION:

No, it wasn't in the case at all.

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

— because he had no occasion to.
And —

34
MR. WALLACE;

But the fact is the Court upheld the

admissibility of the records against Mrs. Couch, even though
they were her records and she was claiming that their
admission into evidence against her violated her privilege
against self-incrimination.
So that it isn’t
QUESTION: Because they were in the possession of
somebody else.
MR. WALLACE:

That's right.

QUESTION: The accountant.

But there's no

suggestion that had the accountant been asserting the privilege,
his personal privilege, there would have been —
MR. WALLACE;

But implicit in the holding, it seems

to us, is that if the government properly secures the records,
they are admissible, —
QUESTION:
MR, WALLACE:

That's not the question ~~
—- financial, records are admissible

against their owner.
QUESTION:

The whole question is whether or not

this is —
MR. WALLACE:

I can't see any other claim of

privilege.
QUESTION:

-- this is securing them properly.

That's the whole question in this case.
MR. WALLACE s That is correct.

35

Now, these are not records that are individually
owned, as was the case in the Couch case.

But they are

records of the partnership, in which each of the partners
has sort of tenancy in common rights, the rights as a co-owner.
And for that reason we have argued that the rationale of the
White case and subsequent cases in this Court, all of which
have reached the same result with the mere citation of the
White case with respect to associational records, is that
in that circumstance the custodian does not have a right to
resist their production.
QUESTION:

What -- to whom did the subpoena run in

this case?
MR. WALLACE;

It ran to Mr. Beilis, who is the

custodian of the records.
QUESTION;
MR. WALLACE;

It didn't run to the partnership?
It was not a subpoena issued to the

partnership.
QUESTION: Well, to whom did the subpoena run in
the WiIson case?
MR. WALLACE;

I don't recall —

QUESTION: Well, it ran to the corporation.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

In the White case —
If you're going to subpoena corporate

records, you've got to serve some person, you just can't
serve the corporation

36

MR. WALLACE?
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Then whomever you serve or whoever has

got custody of the corporate papers has to produce them.
MR. WALLACE:

In the White case, if I recall

correctly, the subpoena was issued to the custodian of the
labor union's records, rather than to the association itself.
But I don't see that -that makes a difference.

He's the one

who has to comply with it.
QUESTION:

No, the subpoena in the White case was

directed to Local No. 542, International Union of Operating
Engineers.
What do you suppose the — what do you suppose the
Court meant by setting up that test, so-called test, in the
White case?

What do you think that test means?

MR. WALLACE: Well, this — we’ve been puzzled by
that, as have the district courts in all of these cases cited
on page 29 of Mr, Samer's brief.
We have noted, first of all, that neither this
Court nor any Court of Appeals has ever yet held that any
organizational records are privileged or that the custodian
is entitled to assert their privilege in resisting a production
order.

And in light of the question put by the Chief

Justice, we suggested one possibility of what this rationale
— what this, essentially, dictum in the White case may mean.
QUESTION: Well, it's a test — it's a test that

37

MR, WALLACE?

It's a test that was stated, but a

test
QUESTIONS And applied.
MR. WALLACES
QUESTIONs

— that ~
In the White case.

MR. WALLACES

It may have been part of the rationale

of the decision.
QUESTION; Right.
MR. WALLACE; But the courts have found it difficult
to apply in any meaningful way.
The Chief Justice has suggested, well, v*hat if the
government were investigating one of the other partners,
rather than the one who happens to have custody of the
records at. the moment? what is the situation there?
Well, —
QUESTION:
it?

That would be the Couch case, wouldn't

You wouldn't need to have this partnership doctrine.
MR. WALLACE; Well, it —- it's not exactly the

Couch case, because the custodian might say that these
records would tend to incriminate him as well as his other
partner.
QUESTION: Well, then it would be this case.
MR. WALLACE: Even if his partner needed them for
exculpatory purposes, he might still raise the same claim.
QUESTION:

If the custodian was making the claim,

38

then that would be this case.
MR. WALLACE;

That would be this case.

And that seeras to us to suggest one possible answer
to what is meant by the White case, and we suggested that on
page 22 of our brief;

that when the association is one in

which the law recognizes testimonial privilege of confidential
communications between the members of the group, then it
seems to us the extension of protection in the White case
makes some sense.
For example, a family's own financial records.
They belong to the husband, and the wife.

But the law does

recognize a privilege of confidentiality in that relationship.
That is what, in the words of Murphy y. Waterfront Commission,
can accurately be characterized as a private enclave, where
persons are entitled to lead a private life.

At least

free from the intrusion of the law to compel self-incrimination
in the absence of a grant of immunity, which is what we
understand that rationale to mean.
And we suggested on page 22 that that seems to us
to mark the sensible bounds in terras of legal rights of this
rationale or dictum expressed in the White case, which the
Court has not yet applied in any context which gives guidance.
It's difficult for us to see that this statement from the White
case distinguishes meaningfully between a three-man partnership
or a four-man partnership, or between a nineteen-man partner-

39

ship or a twenty-man partnership.
But what is involved here# as we set forth in some
detail# are the ordinary business records of the ordinary
operation of a law partnership, receipts and disbursements
of a partnership that had been in the general practice of
law for some fifteen years# which had#

in addition to the

three partners# at least five other employees, which had a
firm name, a firm bank account, firm stationery# was
representing itself as engaged in the general practice of
law.
It's difficult to see on what basis distinction
should be drawn.
QUESTION:

I understand, Mr, Wallace# that he

says that while he’s the custodian of these records# these
records would incriminate him personally.
That's his point.
MR. WALLACE:

That was the point made in Wilson and

White also# Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well# that's — it seems to me

that here there’s no showing of criminality at all# yet.
Right?

It's just an investigation.

MR. WALLACE:

It's just an investigation by the

Grand Jury, which has very broad investigatory powers.
QUESTION:

And he has — suppose he has two sets

of records# one are his personal records# and the other are

40

his records in relationship to the partnership.

Does he have

to produce all of them?
MR. WALLACE;

Well, under Boyd he can claim a

privilege with respect to his personal papers, and the
Internal Revenue Service, in its enforcement activities,
has been complying with Boyd.
QUESTION;

Good.

Next case.

He says they're

so entwined together I can't separate them.
MR, WALLACE s Well, that ■— he would have the
burden of showing that.

I mean, he has obligations as a

fiduciary under State law to be able to make an accounting to
his partners of the partnership records, and they are
available to his partners for inspection, and the district
judge said for copying.
these

His partners can inspect and copy

records, and they have a right to an accounting from

him.
He would be violating his fiduciary obligations if
he were unable to separate the partnership records from his
own.
QUESTION;
let you

lhave

Couldn't he tell his partners;

I can’t

this, because if I let you have it you'll take

it to the authorities and I’ll end up in jail.
MR. WALLACE;

Well, there has been no holding on that,

that I'm aware of.
QUESTION;

I'm not, either.

41
HR. WALLACE?

The whole thrust of State law is

that his partners have rights —
QUESTION: But I'm not too sure ~
MR. WALLACE:

~~ that can't be frustrated.

I'm not too sure Boyd covers this

personal complaint he has with these papers:

I'm the one

who's been doing the dirty work here, and I'm the one that's
messed with the books and everything else? and so I can't
turn them loose, because they'll send me to jail for sure,
MR. WALLACE: Well, the only response I can make
to that is that the whole thrust of this line of cases in the
Court is that when one is holding the papers, as a custodian,
in a representative capacity rather than holding his own
personal papers, he's not entitled to make that claim.
Because —
QUESTION:

He wouldn't if —

MR. WALLACE:

— it diminishes the rights of the

other persons in the organization.
QUESTION:

You wouldn't extend it to the huge

partnerships who have two or three hundred partners, would
you?
You wouldn't extend it there, you say you want to
limit it.
MR. WALLACE: Well, many of the cases have involved
large partnerships, but some of them have involved small —

42
QUESTION:

Well, I mean that's —

MR. WALLACE:

— partnerships.

QUESTION: Well, that's what the appellant says,
and of course it's true in one of these huge partnerships.
But where .you have a small partnership it's different.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Well, I —

And you originally said that the family

one, of course, would be very little problem with that.
MR. WALLACE:

No, I didn't — I didn't refer to a

family partnership necessarily.

I was referring to the

family’s own family records.

QUESTION:

Well, Ifcnyou it would make no difference

how small the partnership was or how intimate it was.
MR, WALLACE:

Well, we think that the legal attributes

than comparing the size and activities of various partnerships

43

which the courts have had great difficulty in trying to -QUESTION: So you don’t base it on numbers alone,
you base it on the nature of the partnership.
MR. WALLACE: Well, our contention doesn't base it
on numbers at all.

Our contention bases it on the legal

right between partners, who are associated together in the
partnership.

And because each individual partner — each

individual partner's rights are limited with respect to the
partnership records by State law.
Uniform Partnership Act.

In this case by the

As in most States.

His rights

are limited by the rights of the other partners.
And that doesn't vary, whether there are two partners
or two hundred.
QUESTION:

Mr, Wallace, I take it if Mr. Beilis had

gotten these records and thrown them in the river and they
were then subpoenaed, he was subpoenaed for a Grand Jury,
he has to produce them, he said he didn't have them, and
then he was asked: What did you do with them?
Under Curcio he would have the right to plead self~
incrimination there, wouldn't he?
MR. WALLACE:

He would.

He would, Your Honor.

He's not required to testify under Curcio.
to produce.

But he is required

The Court in Curcio assumed that he would be

required to produce them in response to the subpoena.

In

fact, they even noted in a footnote that he had produced them,

44
in response to the subpoena.

The Court reaffirmed the White

holding, that he could be required to produce them.
But they said that he couldn't be required to
testify as to their whereabouts, if he chose not to produce
them.
That isn't the issue here.
Of course there can be subpoenas, whether they deal
with papers or not, that would elicit incriminatory
information from an individual.

If you subpoena someone to

produce the blunt instrument with which you beat a certain
individual on the night of April 14th, or something of that
sort, his producing the instrument in response to the
subpoena is, in effect, some communication.
If — if the subpoena attempts to elicit that kind
of information.
But we're not dealing with anything of that sort
here.

The on3.y thing that's required here is the essentially

neutral obligation of the custodian, that he undertook when
he undertook custody of the association’s records, to produce
them and say, These are the records of the association that
are called for in the subpoena.

Not to say anything else

about his own activities that would tend to incriminate him.
And there's no need to introdvice in evidence even
that much of an admission on his part.

It's just implicit

And the consistent holding of this Court's series
of cases dealing with associational records is that that's
an obligation he undertook in undertaking custody of the
associational records.
QUESTION:

Well, your suggested limitation of the

White test, what's an example of associational relationship
with respect to which the law recognizes testimony for
MR. WALLACE: Well, the one that occurred to me is
the one I mentioned, the family's records, where the law
recognizes a testimonial privilege between the wife and the
husband.
Now, there needn't be
QUESTION:

Can you conceive of any in connection

with a partnership of this size?
MR. WALLACE:

I could not, Your Honor, unless, under

the law, a partnership between a husband and a wife would be
treated the same way.

I have some doubt that it would, becaus<

of the provisions under the Uniform Partnership Act, giving
the partners rights against one another in producing
fiduciary obligations in that context.
But that was one possibility that occurred to us.
QUESTION:
MR. WALLACE:

It would be very limited, wouldn't it?
It would be very limited.

But, on the other hand, no Court of Appeals has
found any — any context at all in which to apply this test,

46

and neither has this Court.

And we don't think that this

case is a proper context for applying it, either.
