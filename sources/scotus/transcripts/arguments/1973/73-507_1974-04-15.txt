MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear*

arguments next in No. 73-507, Hamling against the United
States.
Mr. Fleishman, I think you may proceed whenever
you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY FLEISHMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. FLEISHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I stand on behalf of Petitioner, Mr. Mamling and
the corporate petitioners herein.

Mr. Rosenwein represents

the other petitioners.
Mr. Hamling has been given a prison term of
four years.

The corporate defendants have been fined,

including Mr. Hamling, $87,000 for mailing a brochure that
hurt no one.

The brochure advertised a book, a book with-

plain, serious,, political value.
The book is an illustrated version of a govern­
ment report which basically held or concluded that the

law

of obscenity in a free community such as ours, requires
that willing adults be permitted to make their own choice
with regard to whether or not they will or will not expose
themselves to sexually explicit material.
The brochure follows the line of the book.

The

government's own witness called the brochure "a miniature of
the book.”
Petitioners, of course, have been caught —
Q

Was the original report illustrated,

Mr. Fleishman?
MR. FLEISHMAN:

No, sir, it was not.

But we

called, however, one of the commissioners, Commissioner
Larsen, who testified that the book that we put out with its
illustrations made the book more valuable with the pictures.
We also called the executive director and the
director of research for the Commission Report.

He similarly

said that the Illustrations made the report more valuable,
not less.
The Petitioners were caught, please —
Q

Did they enlarge on that?

MR. FLEISHMAN:
Q

Yes, they did, your Honor.

How did they?

MR. FLEISHMAN:

They explained that for informed

people to know what the issue was about, that they ought to be
able to look at what the explicit material was that was being
litigated and both witnesses testified, those who were in
favor of the proposal of the Commission and those who were
opposed to it, both would be better informed by looking at the
pictorial material which accompanied the text.
The government stipulated that every picture —

5
every picture in the report, was related in some reasonable
fashion to the work that the Commission had, in fact,
developed.
Q

Is there any reason

free to disbelieve these witnesses,

why the jury wouldn’t be
just as they would any

other witness?
MR. FLEISHMAN:

On that score, I believe not,

your Honor, because they simply didn't know.

If we believe

that experts have a place in a trial,then if they are honest
people, no one ever disputed their honesty, when they talk
in an area in their expertise, then I think that a jury
should listen, because a commissioner, who spent two years on
tne commission report, the executive secretary spent two
years there, siraply has an opinion that is better than a
lay jury.
Q

But juries do disbelieve experts for a

number of reasons, don't they?

And there has been no rule of

lav; that says they have to believe them.
MR. FLEISHMAN:

Yes, your Honor.

In any event, opposition on this score is that
both the book had serious political value and therefore is a
matter of law, constitutional law, is protected by the First
Amendment and that the brochure similarly has serious
political value and is absolutely protected by the First
Amendment.

6
Q

Are there not a number of holdings of both

state and federal courts to the effect that the jury has
wider latitude in accepting or rejecting expert testimony
than other testimony?
MR. FLEISHMAN;

On this issue, your Honor, whether

the work has serious political value, that is a matter of
First Amendment law and has nothing to do with either the
acceptance or the rejection of the expert witness, so that on
our score, in terms of whether it has serious political value,
a book which urges a major change in policy and brochure
which urges major change in policy has to, in a free society,
be recognized as containiiig the requisite serious political
value in our* judgment.
How, if the Court please, the Petitioners have
been caught, as everyone recognizes, in a period of transition
They are caught in a no man's land.
Under similar circumstances, three courts at
least, the First Circuit in Palladino, the Tenth Circuit in
Friedman and a different panel of the Ninth Circuit in Henson
held that it was simply unfair to send a person to prison, to
brand him as a felon where the lav; has changed, as it has in
this case.

And I would call to the Court’s attention the

fact that the opinion of the court of appeals in this case
is under a heavy cloud by reason of the fact that another
panel in Henson has reached the opposite conclusion and

7
perhaps equally important is the fact that in another case
mentioned in my reply to the government, the government’s
opposition to our petition for certiorari at page 2, in
London Press, the identical brochure was involved and there
the Ninth Circuit granted a rehearing en banc, or ordered
a rehearing en banc and that matter has been put over since
this Court has now granted certiorari.
The point I make is that the Ninth Circuit
itself has expressed a very serious doubt as to the
correctness of the judgment in this case.
Our basic point, your Honor, is that the
federal statute, Section l46l, on its face and as construed
to pre-Miller conduct simply fails to meet constitutional
muster.

It does not afford fair notice.

It does, not afford

the concrete guidelines which this Court said every obscenity
statute would have to have before anyone would be subjected
to any criminal prosecution and. the defect in the statute
as it existed prior to Miller, is tri-fold.
First of all, the statute plainly does not have
the specificity which this Court said was an absolute
essential to the validity of an obscenity statute.

One need

only look at the words of the statute to see they talk only
in terms of obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy and
the like.
It is equally plain that this Court had not

8
heretofore, before Miller, had a saving construction of the
statute.
If there is — if there be a saving construction
of the statute, it would be in footnote 7 in 12 Reels of Film
and there the court only said that it was prepared in the
future to read Miller into the federal statute and if the
court was prepared in the future to do so, it follows
inevitably that the court had not theretofore had the Miller
specificity in the statute.
And so, the statute was simply unconstitutionally
vague because it did not have what this Court said every
obscenity statute would have to have if it was to meet
constitutional requirements.
Secondly, if the Court please, the authoritative
construction of 1461, at the time that the Petitioners herein
were tried and convicted, was that national standards had to
be used.

National standards had to be used with regard to

patent defensiveness.

National standards had to be used with

regard to prurient interest.
But this Court has said that there are no national
standards.

They are unascertainable.

They are unrealistic.

They are unprovable.

They are abstract and the Court has

said that a jury, trying to answer the question of obscenity
within the framework of national standards, was engaged in an
exercise in futility.

9
Therefore, the Petitioners here were convicted of
offending standards that simply, on the Court's own terms, do
not exist.
The statute, in the first place, is defective
because that is the authoritative construction of the statute
as of the time of the trial and the conviction and having
read the national standards into the statute and following
the logic — not the logic, the teachings of Miller, we know
that national standards simply do not exist.
The statute is also unconstitutionally vague,
pre-Miller because of the utilization of the utterly without
redeeming social value test and with that regard, the Court
said that the test was ambiguous, that it was unworkable.
:

The government reads the Court’s opinion some­
what differently, but as we see it, it makes no1 difference.
The government says that the utterly without redeeming social
value test was rejected because it imposed an impossible
burden upon the government, that the government could never
obtain a constitutionally-valid conviction under that
standard.
If that be so, the argument really is that the
utterly without redeeming social value test is so allencompassing that it effectively nullifies 1461 and if that
be so again, one cannot say that the Petitioners had fair
notice or concrete guidelines as to what kind of conduct

10

would make them felons and punishable by heavy jail terms.
And, finally, if the Court please in this regard,
at the time of the conduct herein, and at the time of trial,
the opposite test in determining obscenity was the Redrup test.
Everybody agrees on this bench,as I understand it,
that that was no test at all.

It was nothing but a subjective

test in which any five members of this Court, using their
separate tests, their own intuitions, would come to a
conclusion.

In short, all that the Petitioners had to know

was, hov/ would five justices look at the material at the time
that he came before you.
Wow, if that be a rule of lav/, if that is a test
that meets due process, I respectfully submit, then, due
process has a meaning quite different from anything that I
had understood before.
I had always thought that in a free society, a
person subject to a law would have to know with reasonable
certainty, in advance, what made his conduct criminal or not
criminal and if the rule be that whatever five or nine
justices believe is bad, then, I submit, your Honors, that
there has not been a compliance with due process,
But, even if the Court is not prepared to hold
that the statute is unconstitutional in the respects that we
have set forth, I respectfully submit, your Honor, that the
indictment in this case is fatally infirm.

XI
The indictment is fatally Infirm because the
indictment follows the statute word by word.

There is

nothing in the indictment which in any way clarifies the
ambiguity in the statute itself.

So if the words, obscene,

lewd, lascivious, et cetera, by themselves do not give
fair notice and concrete guidelines, then they do not give
the fair notice that the Sixth Amendment requires in giving
the accused fair notice of that which he is required to
defend against.
Now, the government, if the Court please, has
moved to Palladino as the case to point the direction to the
solution of the trial here, the case herein.

The government,

recognizing that it is unfair to convict a person on a serious
charge if he is caught in midstream, says, let's follow
Palladino.
Well, if we follow Palladino, we are entitled, of
course, to a reversal because in Palladino, there was a
conviction and after remand by this Court, the First Circuit
said that fairness required that the issue be submitted to
the jury and, of course, there there was a national standard.
I put aside whether it is correct to submit it to
the jury on a national standard or a local standard.

The

simple fact is that it was recognized in Palladino that there
had to be a submission of the issue to the jury.
Now, it is interesting that in Friedman, where

12

there was also the same conclusion reached by the Tenth
Circuit, the Tenth Circuit in Friedman took the view that
there had to be a submission to the jury because local
standards were to be applied in federal cases.
Now, this is the position that the government
urges for federal prosecutions, the utilization of local
standards.
Our view of it is that if, in fact, local standards
are to be used in federal proscecutions, plainly, the peti­
tioners were not tried or convicted under the local standards.
Indeed, as we pointed out in our reply brief, our
attempt to put evidence in with regard to local standards
was excluded.
We, for example, had called the witness, who had
made a survey in the San Diego area with regard to the
identical brochure in question and on a scientific basis, she
asked 718 people their opinions with regard to the brochure.
Overwhelmingly, as the record shows, they were of the view,
essentially, that the brochure, as it stood, should be
allowed to be circulated to the American people generally.
That evidence was excluded, however, solely on
the ground that the only test that was applicable was the
national standards and not the local standards.
So that, if, again, we are to follow the suggestion
of the government that local standards are to be used, then.

13
plainly, there has to be a reversal In this ease.
If we agree that there are national standards
that are the appropriate remedy in a federal court, at least
until such time as Congress speaks, then it seems to us that
this Court1s ruling that there are no national standards has
the practical effect of invalidating the federal statute,
at least in the utilization of national standards.
If the Court please, I would like to reserve the
balance of my time till after Mr. Rosenwein, who is
representing the other Petitioners.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

AFTERNOON SESSION
Mil. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Rosenweln.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP SAM ROSENWEIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. ROSENWEIN:

Mr. Cheif Justice and may It

please the Court:
The issue that I am devoting myself to is the
issue of scienter, expression of guilty knowledge and what is
the mental element requisite for a constitutionally per­
missible prosecution.
Now, the record as brought down below was some­
thing like this and on a motion for a bill of particulars, with
respect to the indictment, we have charged that the Petitioners
knowingly mailed and used the mails and mailed this obscene
brochure.
In answer to a motion for our bill of particulars,
the government stated it was not claiming that these
defendants knew, in fact, that the material was obscene.

All

it was claiming was that they knew the contents of the
brochure and that was sufficient to satisfy the scienter
requirement.
Q

Do you suggest, Mr. Rosenweln, that in order

to make out a case, the handler of the material must
acknowledge that it is obscene before he exposes it or
exhibits it?

15

MR. ROSENWEIN:

My contention is simply this,

that one has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he
knew the contents and that he knew the obscene nature and
character of the contents, and with that knowledge,
intentionally disseminated the material with a specific
intent to appeal to a prurient interest.
That, I think, is a burden that is upon
prosecution in an obscenity prosecution and we asked the
court below thereto instruct generally along those lines.
In answer to that, the court instructed the jury
and said to us, that it would say no more than that the
knowledge of contents of the envelope in which the brochure
was contained was all that was required in this case.
He would charge, said the trial court, that the
defendants are required — that the government has to prove,
it has to be shown that the defendants knew? the nature and
character of the material.
Trial counsel said to the trial court, "What
do you mean by ’nature and character of the material?

Will

you tell us does that mean dealing with sex or sexuallyoriented?

Or does it mean obscene nature in character?'"
The trial court said, "I am going to instruct

the nature and character and it means what it says.11

And

that is all he ever instructed the jury.
So what this jury found was that the Petitioners

16
in this case knew the contents or the nature and character of
the contents in the sense that — and. one can only suppose,
since obscenity was ruled out of the instructions.

It says,

!'A knowledge of obscenity of the material or the non­
obscenity of the material was told

to the jury as being

irrelevant-”
It followed, therefore, that the jury found that
they knew that the contents of this brochure dealt with sex
and that was enough to establish the guilty knowledge that
resulted in the imposition of the sentences.
Now, what we have contended, simply, is this.

The

indictment charged us with knowingly mailing an obscene
brochure.

What is an obscene brochure?

What are the

qualities that go into a brochure that makes it obscene?
At the time when we were tried, there were three
elements.

One, that it exceeded contemporary community

standards, that it appealed to a prurient interest and was
utterly without social value.
Those were the qualities that made it obscene.
Obviously, if those are the elements of the offense, this is
true in any criminal case, It must be shown that that the
particular accused knew those elements, knew those facts, he
knew the quality of that material exceeded contemporary
standards, appealed to prurient interests and was without
value.

17
Wellj we have never contended that the government
Is required to show that the accused knew what the lav/ was.
We have never contended It was required to show they knew
what the standards were that were enunciated by this Court.
We have not contended that there is any necessity for direct
proof of the awareness.

It can be by circumstantial evidence

but whatever the proof is that is necessary, we have conten­
ded that it must be shown by direct or circumstantial
evidence that the accused was in some way aware that this
material went beyond contemporary standards, appealed to a
prurient interest and had no value.
And it was up to the jury to decide Without
improvised presumption, without judicial notice.
.

It was
.

for them to decide whether or not, under those circumstances,
the accused knew.
We contend that it is illogical — it offends
empirical evidence that one can point to, to say that today
one can look at some materials dealing with sex and simply
say, from knowing that its contents deal with sex or are
sexually oriented, that he knows that that material is
obscene, that he knows that that material necessarily goes
beyond standards and appeals to a prurient Interest and has
no value.
Time af'cer tine, juries, judges have said, "Why,
this is hard-core pornography.

This is dirt for dirt’s sakes“

18
only to find tnat appellate courts, upper courts, and this
Court itself have held, no, this material is not obscene.

*■0

It

is constitutionally protected.
Now, the lawyers who are asked for advice today,

...

■ !-y'

whether it is films or motion pictures or books or magazines,
have difficulty in saying to a client that this matter dealing
with sex necessarily is or is not obscene, or it offends some
jury in Albany, Georgia.
Prosecutors and judges and juries have difficulty
in determining this.-.
A ivhole period has passed since the

1896 decision

in dosen in which a virtual sexual revolution has occurred
and for anyone to say today, logically, or any other way,
that one looks at a book or a magazine or a film and by looking
at its contents and saying, well, this deal's with sex, I know
one can tell just from that that he knows it is obscene,
would seem to us to be irrational and illogical and so we
nave contended that under the circumstances, the standard for
judging scienter — and I think one has to keep in mind that
tnis is a federal offense.

It is a statute that punishes

with five years, $10,000 fine or $5,000 fine.
offense is 10 years, $10,000.
honors .mow,

The second

Anyone who is convicted, your

is immediately dubbed with the stigma of smut-

lover .
Now, that is a serious thing, both from a

19

criminal charge and from the viewpoint of reputation»
Therefore, the need before you put somebody in
jail, of proving the guilty mind is important.

It is

essential and it seems to us not too much of a burden.

We

have not placed too much of a burden on the prosecutor to
prove a case if, by direct or circumstantial evidence, he
merely establishes that the accused knew the obscene nature
and character of the contents before he is found guilty.
Now, the next point that I want to direct myself
to is, the government has consistently argued that knowledge
of contents is sufficient.

We contend that the proof in the

record here is absolutely barren of any proof that these
Petitioners knew the contents of this particular brochure.
We have analyzed it in the record.

I can’t, with­

in the time limits, go too far, but enough to say this, that
if you take Petitioner Wright, you will find that she is
absolutely, described even by the government as — the
evidence against her is very attenuated, admittedly, an
office manager ans so forth.
The material here, the brochure here, was mailed
some 250 miles away from Los Angeles, in North Hollywood.
was put in the mails.

It

It was inserted — the brochures were

inserted in envelopes by two people who knew nothing about
these Petitioners and never heard from them.
They received the brochures from someone called

20

"Regent House" who were named as unindicted conspirators,
never called by the government as witnesses.

They — the

brochure was printed in North Hollywood and the printer was
named as unindicted coconspirators never called by the
government.
As a result, there is nothing in this record to
show tuat these Petitioners, Kemp or Wright or Thomas or
Battling, had anything to do with the preparation or mailing
of this particular brocnure

and that was the only charge

that was made against these Petitioners.
They were not charged with being, as described
by the government, pivotal characters flocked together —
the government talks about conspiracy here and what is the
conspiracy?

Well, they all were in business together.

They

were concerted.
Well, if a conspiracy is made out by simply
people working together in a publishing house, then all
motion picture studios, all corporate bodies are in danger,
a newspaper establishment is in danger if some president signs
a check in payment for a bill, the government says, you can't
hide behind these things.

There is nothing in the record to

show any hiding behind anything.
The fact of the matter is that this case was
tried under the theory and with the purpose of doing away with
scienter all together.

That is the point of this case.

21

The government does not want to prove any guilty
knowledge.

It wants to try it like a traffic offense.

All

you have to do is put it in the publication, give it to the
jury and let them return a verdict and that, with respect to
a criminal trial.
In a federal court, the administration of
criminal justice is, we submit, essentially unfair.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Mr. Tuttle.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. TUTTLE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. TUTTLE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioners have raised a number of issues in
their petition and here in oral argument.

We believe the

central issue in this case is the impact of this Court’s
decision in Miller versus California and companion cases,
decided last term, upon federal obscenity convictions which
occurred before Miller was decided.
In assessing this impact, I invite the Court to
consider the material which is here for review.
In the first place, it is not the book, not the
illustrated version of the President’s — the report of the
President’s Commission on Obscenity and Pornography which the

22

jury found obscene.
that issue.

The jury did not return a verdict on

What the Petitioners were convicted of was

mailing out an obscene advertisement.
Nov/, the evidence shows that some 55,000 of
these brochures were mailed indiscriminately around the
country to various unsuspecting recipients,

many of whom

found the brochure to be quite offensive.
The brochure consists of a single page.

On one

side is a photograph of the cover of the illustrated report,
together with a coupon indicating where copies can be
obtained.
The other side consists entirely of a collage of
photographs showing a variety of sexual scenes, including
group sex scenes, heterosexual and homosexual intercourse,
sodomy, bestiality and masturbation.
This is hard-core pornography by any definition
and judged by the standards of any community.
The Petitioners nonetheless say that that their
conviction should be reversed.

They argue that Miller teaches

us that the federal obscenity statutes were unconstitutionally
vague, at least until Miller was decided and those statutes
were authoritatively construed and narrowed by 12 200-foot
Reels of Film.
Now, we find no such implication in the Miller
decision or in the companion cases.

Miller reshaped the

23
standards for judging obscenity in a number of ways, some of
which arguably broadened the class of punishable pornography
and some of which arguably narrowed that class.
For example, when the Court substituted the
requirement of lack of serious literary, artistic, political
or scientific or artistic purpose for the Roth definition of
obscenity as utterly lacking in social value, it

is

arguable that the Court expanded the class of punishable
obscenity because it is at least conceivable that something
could be not utterly without redeeming social value and
still lack a serious artistic or literary purpose.
Nov/, at the time these brochures were mailed,
Roth/Memoirs was the prevailing definition of obscenity and
the Petitioners were tried and convicted and their
convictions were affirmed under the Roth/Memoirs definition.
It is our feeling that to the extent, if at all,
which Miller expanded the class of punishable pornography,
it might be unfair to review their convictions under that
expanded definition and it is, therefore, our suggestion and
our belief that these convictions should be reviewed under
the stricter definition of obscenity contained in Roth versus
the United States and Memoirs versus Massachusetts.
Of course, as I have indicated, they were
convicted under those standards and their convictions were
reviewed under those

standards and their convictions were

affirmed under those standards.

We are only suggesting that

this Court should do the same.
Nov/, on the other hand, there are aspects —
Q

Mr. Tuttle?

MR. TUTTLE.
Q

Yes?

I want to be sure I understand that.

June’s decisions in

In last

this Court, as I understood them, it

was held that the Roth standards were constitutionally
deficient.

Isn’t that correct?
MR. TUTTLE:

Miller decision.

That is not my understanding of the

As I read Miller, the Court found that the

Roth definition or some aspects of the Roth definition, for
instance, the "utterly without redeeming social value” test
was a constitutionally unnecessary and difficult to prove, if
not impossible to prove, burden on the government and the
Court formulated a different .formulation.
But I don’t take it — I don’t take the Court to
be 3aying, when it decided that Miller would be the standards
for judging obscenity in the future, that all the prior
convictions using the Roth definition were unconstitutional
or unconstitutionally obtained or that the formulation under
which they were obtained made the convictions void.
Now, there are other aspects —
Q

And those cases went on to say that in order

not to be deficient constitutionally, statutes had to be very

25
specific.
MR. TUTTLE:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

I was going to

say that on the other hand, there is an aspect of Miller
which arguably enhances the First Amendment protections
available for defendants in obscenity cases and that is,
precisely as you mentioned, Mr. Justice, the requirement in
Miller that the obscenity statute be limited to depictions
of sexual conduct, specifically described in applicable
state law.
Nov/, it is our position that to the extent that
Miller created new First Amendment protection for defendants
in obscenity cases, that these should be made available to
Petitioners or to any defendants whose convictions are non­
final.
In 12 200-foot Reels of Film, the federal
obscenity statutes were given the limiting construction
which was required in Miller and it was said that those
statutes would be construed as applying to those depictions
of hard-core sexual conduct which were given as examples in
Miller versus California.
Q

I don't have the language in front of me or

even precisely in my mind, but I think you are referring to
a footnote in that —
MR. TUTTLE:
Q

Footnote 7 in the —

— or in the Orito case.

26
MR. TUTTLE:
Q

Yes.

Which said something along the lines that

we are prepared to construe or some such language as that.
Am I misrecollecting?
MR. TUTTLE:

It says — I could probably quote it

to you.
Q

Well —

MR. TUTTLE:

It says, "If and when a serious

doubt is raised as to the vagueness of the federal statutes,
we are prepared to construe them as limited to the examples of
hard-core sexual conduct"and, in point of fact, the statute
here —
Q

That can't very well be done after a

conviction, can it?
MR. TUTTLE:
Q

Well —

I mean, you run into all the concepts of

Boule — against Boule in South Carolina, all those cases.
MR. TUTTLE:

It is our feeling, of course.

We

are precisely trying to consider the Boule kind of fair
notice problem in our suggestion that the Defendants should
not be subjected to a definition of obscenity which was more
inclusive than the one that obtained.
Q

In other words —

No, no, we are not talking about the

requirement of the explicitness of the statute.
MR. TUTTLE:

Well, and I am trying to make.

27
Mr, Justicej a distinction between the aspects of Miller
which arguably make a more inclusive category than obscenity,
and those aspects which narrow a statute because

it seems to

us that when the statute is authoritatively narrowed, you are
not faced with the fair notice problems that are faced in
Bouie when a statute is after-the-fact broadened to include
what the defendants did because it is our contention that
this conduct and this publication falls so clearly within
the statute as authoritatively narrox'/ed or falls so clearly,
if you will, within the Miller examples of hard-core
pornography, that as applied to them, the statute was
constitutional and we argue this because on the one hand you
have a concession, indeed,a stipulation that the material
here is of sexual conduct, sexual activities.
Now, the Miller examples refer to patently
offensive depictions of sexual activities.

But here we have

a jury finding that these depictions which were concededly
of explicit sexual conduct depicted that activity in a
patently offensive way.
Therefore, we say there is a finding here in the
court below that this particular publication fell within the
statute as it is suggested that it should be narrowed in
Miller versus California and, therefore, we say, as applied,
it was clearly constitutional.
Now, to say that it is vague as applied — to say

28
that it is not vague as applied and to say that the Defendants7
conduct fell within the specificity requirement in the
examples of Miller, is in no way to imply that the statute
was vague on its face prior to the decision in Miller versus
California and we think that there have been a number of
decisions of this Court, beginning with Roth and as recently
as three years ago in Reidel, where the Court held that the
statute prior to Miller was not vague on its face and as
Mr. Justice Stewart mentioned a moment ago in speaking of
the footnote in 12 200-fcot Reels of Film, there the Court
said, "If and when a serious question as to vagueness is
raised with respect to these statutes, then we will be
prepared to construe them in this narrowing fashion," and
we suggest that the Court's use of the term "if and when"
suggests that such a doubt as to the facial validity of the
statute has not yet been raised and the examples themselves,
the Miller examples which the Court said that it was prepared
to read into the statute were themselves taken from this
Court's experience under the statute and its regular and
settled application and therefore, we believe, that these
examples in Miller don’t change the sweep of the statute but
are simply in accord with the settled meaning of the statute.
We contend, therefore, that the statute was neither
void on its face prior to Miller nor was it

unconstitutional

as applied to these defendants, because their conduct fell

29
clearly within the statute as it has now authoritatively
been construed and it fell within those examples because
the material was conceded to be explicit sexual material.
Mr. Tuttle, I expect it may not be signifi­

Q

cant in your submission, but that footnote did not deal with
the statute under which these convictions were obtained.
MR. TUTTLE:

That is quite correct.

We don’t

think it is significant because it dealt with the forfeiture
statute, 1305 and the Interstate commerce statute, 1462,
which used the language, "Obscene and lewd," which is
exactly the same language which you will find in l46l.
Q

That may be, but, explicitly, we haven't

dealt yet with l46l, have
MR. TUTTLE:
haven't dealt

we?
Well, of course, explicitly you

an if and when proposition.
perfectly clear.

But I take it that it is

The only reason that I can see that the

Court mentioned only those two statutes was because those
were the statues before the Court in Orito and 12 200-foot
Reels of Film.
I haven’t any doubt that if you had a l46l case
that that would have been part of the Court's footnote and I
believe that it is — to me, anyhow, perfectly clear that the
Court would encompass that interpretation, would encompass
Section l46l within that interpretation.

30

Now5 the trial judge charged the jury that it wa3
to apply a national community standard in judging the obscenity
of these materials.

It seems to us that it was clearly proper

for the judge to have done so, at the time because this case
occurred and was tried prior to Miller and, in fact, in
Miller, this Court spoke of a national standard of First
Amendment protections as being correctly regarded as limiting
prosecutions under controlling case law and, in fact,
Petitioners here today have agreed with us that the Court was
correct in applying a national standard.

But they go further

and they say, the application of that national standard, the
concededly correct application of that national standard
made the statute unconstitutionally vague as applied to them.
They seem to be saying that no pre-Miller conduct,
no pre-Miller obscenity could possibly be convicted, could
possibly be the subject of a valid conviction because, they
say, the national standard should be applied, but the national
standard made the statute vague and therefore, there can be
no constitutionally valid obscenity prosecution prior to
Miller.
Q

Do you understand, Mr. Tuttle, that the

Court held in the cases last June that even under a federal
statute of national application that the test to be applied
is one of local mores?
MR. TUTTLE:

Well, I think to say that it was a

31

holding might go too far.

I think the Court made it clear

that it found that a test of obscenity judged by contemporary
community standards xvas, as the Court said, constitutionally
adequate and since the First Amendment would seem to us to
apply equally to state and to federal prosecutions, that at
least it would be constitutionally permissible for the
federal prosecutions to proceed on the basis of a local
standard and the Court, of course, went further in Miller.
Q

And even under statute worded as 1461 is,

which is quite contrary to what I read in Miller, statutes
had to say.
MR. TUTTLE:
Q

I'm sorry, Mr. Justice —?

Well, Miller, as I read it, anu I haven't

reread it recently, said that state statutes — Miller was
a state case — state statutes had to be very specific in
what they prohibited.
MR. TUTTLE:

Do you agree with that?
Of course I agree with that.

That

is what the case said.
Q

That is what I thought it said.

MR. TUTTLE:

And in 12 200~foot Reels of Film,

the Court indicated that it was prepared to find that
specificity in the federal statutes and that was the footnote
example that —
Q
it was.

Was prepared to, if, as or when, or whatever

32
MR. TUTTLEs

If, as or when the vagueness was

found.
Q

And in other similar statutes but not In this

one, that it was prepared to.

But now, then, you are saying

that even if federal statutes — you understand the Court
held — should have different meanings and different federal
judicial districts?
MR. TUTTLE:

The Court said in Miller, we do

believe that the clear implication of Miller is that the
federal — that a federal jury, trying a case
under federal

Q
Which
are

Well, Miller was dealing with a ’State law

dealing with a federal law.

in tiie Solicitor

This would be Li if somebody

General's office stood up and told us that

the Internal Revenue Code was to have different meanings and
different judicial districts, it would be absolutely
irrational.

But you are telling us that the Court held that

a federal statute is to have a different meaning, depending
on what judicial districts —

33
MR. TUTTLE;

There are, of course, many federal

statutes which — or some federal statutes — which do have a
different impingement, depending on the geographical area
where the conduct is undertaken.

The Travel Act, for instance,

keys its concept of illegality to the jurisdiction in which
the unlawful activity is undertaken.
Our reason for feeling that what the Court said
in filler, or the clear implication of Miller is that local
community standards, or community standards, whatever the
appropriate geographical boundaries of that community might
be, should be applied is the Court's — to our mind —
holding that in discussing the state statute where they
said that the nation was too big and too diverse for the
formulation of a single standard.
Q

Well, it follows from that, then, that the

Congress shouldn't pass any lav/s in this area if the nation
is too big to have one law for the whole nation.
MR. TUTTLE:

Well, Congress passed a law for-

bigging the mailing of obscene material and I don't think that
one can find in the Congressional background of the

case, any

attempt or any suggestion that the Court had in mind a
national standard, such as a few members of this Court spoke
of in Jacobellis and in Manual Enterprises.
Congress was concerned

with the mailing of

obscenity and I would imagine they expected it to be tried

34
in whatever jurisdiction the material was mailed in or wherever
it was received or wherever it found its way into the public
domain.
When the Court says that the quest for a national
standard has been unrealistic and that national standards are
hypothetical — and the Court said, unascertainable, those
considerations, it seems to us, apply equally to a federal
statute and a state statute and I believe that the reason why
the Court returned to contemporary community standards in a
state case was because it found that the jury’s efforts to
articulate and

grasp the national standard had not been

wholly successful.
If that is true, it is equally true with respect
to a jury attempting to judge a federal obscenity prosecution.
Conversely, if there had been no difficulty in
articulating a national standard, I submit the Court very
likely would have followed the teachings of Jacobellis and
applied a national standard in state cases.
Q

Well, I suppose when Congress enacted the

Assimilative Crimes Act it chose to incorporate the law of
various states into the Federal Criminal Statute perhaps for
the same reason it ivas difficult to find a national standard.
MR. TUTTLE:

I think that is probably a better

example, Mr. Justice, than the Travel Act example.
to me that

It seems

But that wasn't done when this statute was

passed, was it?
MR. TUTTLE;

MR. TUTTLE:

What wasn't done, Mr. Justice?

I don't think Congress --

There was no assimilating in there at all

MR. TUTTLE:

They didn't

either.
Q

Well —

MR. TUTTLE:

And it was the Court that imported

the concept of a national standard into the obscenity laws.
Q

But my point is that Congress, all of these

Didn't the First Amendment have something

statutes —

to do with the national standards?
MR. TUTTLE:

I mean, Mr. Justice Douglas, of

course, the Court construing the First Amendment, developed
a requirement of a national standard.
All I am saying is, in response to Mr. Justice
Marshall's question was that Congress, I don't think had in
mind either a local or a national standard.

They had in

mind obscene material as a jury would find it and that, again,
is the lesson of Miller.

36
Q

I suppose it is true that running an

unlicensed still in Kentucky or some of the other states
might get a different reaction from jurors than it would in
yet other states where it is not so much a way of life, yet
the statute would be the same statute, would it not?
MR. TUTTLE:

Yes, there are a number of crimes.

In fact, I would say in most instances where the crime is
analyzable in terms of concrete and readily demonstrable
objectively and scientifically provable elements where the
federal statute would

have absolutely equal application in

It has —
Q

Well, would you say that in the State of

hew York, a still is not a still?
It is either a still or It is not a ,still.

It

is the same still in IJew York that it is in Kentucky.
MR. TUTTLE:

I — I

quite agree, Mr. Justice

Marshall and that was why I said, in those instances.
Q

But in this you can have "Carnal Knowledge”

is a still in Kentucky and not in New York,
MR. TUTTLE!;

"Carnal Knowledge" is — may be —

exceed the limits of candor of Albany, Georgia and "Carnal
Knowledge" may, in fact, be found to appeal to the prurient
interest of the average person in Albany, Georgia, but it
still lies with this Court to determine whether or not it
has redeeming social value.

37
Q

Mr. Tuttle, my only quarrel is, I thought

you inferred that this statute was intended and I am saying
that what you are trying to say is that Miller changed the
statute determination.
MR. TUTTLE:

I don't think — Miller was simply

a — if you will, a —
Q

Well, let me ask, what

did Miller do to the

statute?
MR. TUTTLE:

Miller -- the statute speaks only

of obscene material.
Q

Right.

MR. TUTTLE:

The Court has, since Roth, under­

taken to give content to what that means and in each of
these cases, the Court's formulation has been a slightly
different formulation.

Miller gave a formulation which has

been recited today and Miller said that with respect to the
community standards element, reference should be had to the
contemporary community standards of the forum community.
Q

Well, would you be able to advise a client

whether to plead guilty or not, to explain to him whether
this particular book or article Is obscene?
Is it sufficiently clear or is it so obscure
that it is open just to guesswork?
MR. TUTTLE:

I think that it is quite evident,

Mr. Justice, that the concept of obscenity does not lend

38
itself to the precise kinds of measurement that many other
elements of criminal statute do.
Q

Under this federal statute you could be

innocent but be active mailing it from New York — could be
innocent and the act of receiving it and selling it in
California would be a crime.
MR. TUTTLE:

Is that right?

It is conceivable that a jury — it

is conceivable — we would be speculating to know but it is
conceivable, yes.

The judgment of criminality would turn on

the place in which the matter is disseminated and the crime
is committed.
Q

Mr. Tuttle, the Court, over the period of the

last 15 years, has had at least three different definitions.
There is nothing new about altering these definitions, is
there?

Going back from Roth to Jacobellis to the other cases

down the line it has been a process of evolution, hasn't it?
MR. TUTTLE:

It has been a continuing effort to

attempt to formulate manageable standards.
No, there is nothing new, but every time, if it
uappens, we are faced with the
impact of that?

question of what is the

That is why this case is here for the Court

to determine what the relation of that definition is going
to be to conduct which antedated it.
Q

Mr. Tuttle, are you suggesting that before

Miller there 'was a third requirement that the material be

39
utterly without redeeming social value?

What cases do you

refer to for that?
MR. TUTTLE:

I would rely on Memoirs versus

Massachusetts.
Q

iiow many votes did that test have there?

MR. TUTTLE:

That test had three votes.

But

our reason for saying —
Q

Under what case did it ever have five?

MR. TUTTLE:
Q

Memoirs is the case and the reason

Well, It didn't have five votes.

MR. TUTTLE:

— and the reason why, I think that

there were five votes is that you had two members of the
Court who would not have punished — who would have found
the publication constitutionally protected under any
circumstances and you had three members of the

Court who

would have found it constitutionally protected unless it
was shown to be utterly without redeeming social value.
Thus, as a practical matter, any person who kept
his conduct within the Memoirs definition —
Q

The fact

remains that at no time did five

members of the Court subscribe to that test.
MR. TUTTLE:

That is quite true.

Only three

members of the Court — that It became — in our view, and
I think, in the view of the public and the Bar, an operating
definition.

It let us know, or let members of the Bar

advising publishers know, what it was

what was the limit

that could not be transgressed.
Q

Well, there were two members of the

Court

who had a clearer definition than the three.
Q

In what case was it, Mr. Tuttle —

MR. TUTTLE:
Q

They always have, fir. Justice.

— in what case was it that Chief Justice

Warren said that there could not be a national standard?

Was

that Jacobellls?
MR. TUTTLE:

That was the Chief Justice's dissent

in Jacobelli3.
Q

Do you suppose, Mr. Tuttle, that all of this

discussion suggests that maybe even Miller isn't the last
word in this very troubled area?
MR. TUTTLE:
Q

Miller gave us --

No, I guess that's not my question.

My

question is whether you think Miller is necessarily the last
word in this area.
MR. TUTTLE:

Miller, of course, is not the last

word because even — we're here today and we are here today
with some problems but our problems relate to the application
of Miller.

We are

not here to question the standards of

obscenity articulated in Miller, but we are merely attempting
to determine whether

a

pre-Miller conviction can be

sustained under that definition.

41

Mow, we don't believe that the criticism of
local standards, which Is contained in Miller versus
California necessarily applies, that all federal obscenity
prosecutions antedating Hiller

have to be voided.

We don’t

think the Court had any such idea in mind.
In the first place, there have been, since
Miller, a large number of cases which have been remanded to
courts of appeals for reconsideration in the light of
Miller and these are federal cases where the jury was
charged to use a national standard, as was the jury here
and we believe that if the use of a national standard had
made the statute unconstitutionally vague prior to Miller,
we would have had reversals and not remands and to say that
the standard is hypothetical is not to say that it can’t be
ascertained, that is to say, the national standard.

It is

to say that it is, to some extent, supposititious and
speculative and that we are asking the jury to engage in a
kind of generalizing which the Court found, generally
speaking, unfruitful and not

wholly successful but it

doesn't follow that it was constitutionally deficient when
it was done as required by the decisions of this Court.
Indeed, as one federal court has suggested,
since Miller, the effort to Identify a national standard
seems to differ only in degree from the effort which was
authorized and required in Miller to determine a statewide

42
standard of a state as large and variegated and populous as
the State of California.
I would

finally say that if there is a question

of applicable standards and if there is any question that the
defendant was incorrectly tried under a national standard,
we would say it was harmless error because this material is
obscene under any standards and there is no community whose
limits of candor are not exceeded

by the Petitioner's

publication.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Fleishman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY FLEISHMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. FLEISHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to

start with the last and that is, the brochure simply is not
obscene.

It is not obscene under national standards.

It is

not obscene under local standards and in any event, we were
not tried under any local standards and I assume that from
all that has been said that at a minimum, Petitioners are
entitled to a trial by a jury.
obscene by any standards.

The Prosecution says it is

I would remind the Court that a

film "Deep Throat" xtfhich was thought to be obscene by any
standards has been found to be not obscene continuously
throughout the country by local juries.
I would like to focus. If I may, on the
indictment, because I think the discussion we have had here

43
demonstrates the inadequacy of this indictment in this case.,
which is merely in statutory language.
Now, it is true, of course, that where a statute
has a clear, well-defined meaning one can incorporate that
by using statutory language but as every Justice on the
Court has mentioned here, we do not have one single clear
definition of obscenity.

There are three, four or five.

In Qrito, this Court sent the case back for an
investigation as to the sufficiency of the indictment.

The

Government, in its brief, states that since Miller and 12 Reels
of Film had incorporated new specificity requirements into
the statute, it would be necessary to consider the sufficiency
of the indictment in light of those cases.
Okay.
there?

Look at the Indictment.

Is the specificity

No, it is not.
The Government then says that the words obscene,

lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy and vile simply means the
materials come within the legal definition of obscenity.
Well, isn’t that begging the issue?

What was the

legal definition of obscenity at the time that the indictment
came down?

Justice White suggests that ’’utterly without

redeeming social value" was not part of it.
For the present purpose, I don’t care whether it
was or was or was not part of the definition.

I don't care

whether it ;;as a local standard or a national standard.

I

don't care whether you measure prurient interests by
national, local standards or no standards.

I do say that

where you have a statute which is so up in the air as this
one is, absolutely the irreducible minimum is, that we are
entitled to have in our indictment what the eharge is and
not have these vague words, lewd, lascivious and the like
and say everybody knows what that is, of course.

We've

always known what that is.
Now, we do have other points and I have a moment
and I would like to emphasize, if I may, some of the vices
that came from the infirmity of the indictment.
For example, we were charged, in statutory
language only, in response to a bill of particulars, we
were told that the material was offensive because it
appealed to the prurient interests of the average person
and yet, we were tried with regard to a Michigan theory.
The jury was told that they could convict, if it appealed
to the prurient interest of the average person or a clearlydefined sexually-deviant group.
When we complained to the Court of Appeals, the
Court of Appeals said we were right, that it should have been
solely measured by the average person, but it was harmless
error and now the Government says no, the Court of Appeals
was wrong, that it should have been tried on a clearlydefined sexually-deviant group.

45
Again, my point here is, first, that it had to
be in the indictment and, secondly, on the merits, there
wasn’t the slightest

basis for the use of a Michigan

instruction.
Pandering, also.

There isn't a word of pandering

in the advisement, nothing in the bill of particulars and
yet the jury was instructed that they could convict on a
pandering doctrine without the slightest evidence of any
pandering.

There isn’t a case that I know of which holds that

an advertisement can pander itself and yet that is what the —
Q

What was the situation in the Ginzburg case,

Mr. Fleishman, was there anything there?
MR. FLEISHMAN:
I read

No, in Ginzburg, your Honor, as

Ginzburg, the Court held that the books involved were

rendered obscene because the brochure advertising them, in
effect, said that they were obscene and therefore, that
could be taken into account but Ginzburg did not at all
suggest that the advertisement could pander itself.

It is

logically inconsistent because in this case, if the brochure
was mailed,

either it is obscene or it is not obscene.

It

does not in any way lend itself to a pandering instruction
and we did, as a matter of fact, call the Court's attention
to the fact that there were cases which held at a minimum,
one would have to plead that in the indictment if it was not
so pleaded.

46
Thank you very much.
Q

Mr. Fleishman, does the record show how the

mailing list of 55,000 people was compiled?
MR. FLEISHMAN.

It does not, your Honor.

do have is, for sure, that 12 people were offended.

What we
That is

all we knoitf, that 55 to 58,000 were mailed and that 12
people were offended.
Q

That is all the record shows.

Does the record show whether any of the

55 to 58,000 people had requested the brochure?
MR. FLEISHMAN:

The record is silent on that

point, your Honor.
Q

Does the record show whether it was

received by any minors?
MR. FLEISHMAN:

The record does show that it

was not received by any minors at all.

The record also

shows that there was total 100 percent compliance with
Section 3008, which is the pandering law.
that in every single instance

That is to say,

— that is, in every single

instance of the 12 persons, the addressees had gone to the
post office and said that they had received a brochure which
they thought was sexually arousing to them and they didn't
want to receive any more mail from the Library Service.
In every instance, they testified that they
never received another piece of mail from Library Service or
there was total, complete, 100 percent compliance with the

only statute that Congress had passed which was on this
issue at the time because it should be remembered that after
Ginzburg, Congress passed two laws.
First there was Section 3008, which was found to
be constitutional in Rowan and, secondly, they passed, the
next year, the sexually-oriented ad section which we find in
39 U.S. Code Section 30 and 10.
Now, that law was not yet in effect at the time
that we mailed.
month later.

That law was going into effect about a

It became effective on February the 12th,

1971 and the last mailing that we had was January 12, 1971.
Had that lav; been in effect, 3010, then if there
was a charge under that, we would have an entirely different
situation but, as It stands now, we have the situation where
there was full compliance with the only specific Congressional
act that had been enacted dealing with the mailing of sexual
material and that was Section 3008, which was the section
involved in Rowan.
Q

I suppose there was no way to tell the number

of children in the 55,000 homes into which this brochure was
mailed?
MR. FLEISHMAN:

No, but I would say this, since

we are supposing, your Honor.

I know that the list was

purportedly a list of persons who had previously indicated
a desire to receive sexually explicit material.

Those are

the only mailing lists that are worth anything because one
tries to mail to those persons who are interested»

If you

want to sell cat food, you want to mail materials to people
who have cats so the truth of the matter is that the brochure
was mailed, as fully as one could, to those adults who had
indicated that they did want it.
Mow, that is not in the record.

I don't want to

mislead the Court, but I think that is the true answer as to
who was, in fact, the recipient of the ads.
We have, as I say, 12 people who were offended.
There are 12 people who were offended by receiving many
political brochures too, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. Fleishman.
MR. FLEISHMAN:

Thank you very much, your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.

was submitted,]
