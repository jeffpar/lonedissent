MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Zimmerman, you may proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT F. ZIMMERMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF CORNING GLASS WORKS
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I represent Corning Glass Works, Petitioner from
an unfavorable decision of the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals and Respondent to a petition filed by the Secretary
of Labor from a decision of the Third Circuit Court of
Appeals which was favorable to Corning Glass Works.
These cases arise under the Equal Pay Act of
1963, an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act.

The

Equal Pay Act, which is set forth in its entirety on page 5
of our blue brief, provides very briefly that an employer
may not differentiate between men and women in the payment
of wage rates where they are working on jobs the requirements
of which require equal skill, effort and responsibility arid
are performed under similar working conditions.
The Secretary of Labor has the burden of proof to

show that skillj effort and responsibility are equal and that
the

jobs are performed under similar working conditions.
Both circuit courts agreed that the Act, the

Equal Pay principle has no application unless the Secretary
has successfully carried nis burden of proof in respect to
the se elements.
The Act also contains affirmative defenses which
we suggest are irrelevant to the issues involved in this

case.
Finally, the Act requires that an employer may
not reduce wage rates in order to come into compliance with
the Act.

There are three issues here presented for review.
The threshold issue is whether work on a steady

night shift is performed under a similar working condition as
work during the day within the meaning of the term "working
conditions" as used in the Equal Pay Act of .1963.
As to this issue, the circuit courts of appeals
disagreed.

The Second Circuit held that the Act was not

applicable if working conditions were

not similar but

concluded that, in fact, work on a steady night shift was a
similar working condition to work during the day, applied the
Act and held Corning to be in violation of it.
The Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that
work on a steady night shift was not performed pursuant to a
similar working condition as work during the day and

5
concluded that the Act was

inapplicable.

The two remaining issues are compliance issues
which were not reached by the Third. Circuit Court of Appeals
because it held that the Act was inapplicable.
The Second Circuit did reach these issues and
they raised the question of whether Coming's conduct afterJune I, 1966j when Corning was able to open all the steady
night shift jobs to women, continued to violate the Act.
On June 1, 1966, when Corning made the steady
night shift jobs available to women, it was a genuine
integration of the jobs because within three weeks after
that date, all of the women who had performed work on the
steady day shift jobs, which were lower rated, had had an
opportunity to accept steady night shift employment on the
comparison jobs.
Only the most junior of them took the opportunity
to perform that work.
I will discuss the facts in detail relative to
each of these issues as I get to them, if I may.
The threshold issue on which the Second and
Third Circuit Courts of Appeal disagreed involves identical
facts in both cases.

Reduced to their essentials, the facts

are that only men worked on the steady night shift.

Only

women worked the day shifts, except during World War IIs
when the New York District Court found that women had been

6
employed on the steady night shift and had been paid the
higher steady night shift wage rate when they performed the
same worn as the men.
The higher night shift rate was paid to all
people who worked at night, and only to people who worked at
night.

The lower day shift rate was paid only for work

during the day and was paid to all people x^ho worked during
trie day.
This issue is purely a question

of law for this

Court involving the interpretation of this statute.

The

SEcretary in its brief has placed great emphasis upon
evidence and findings by the Second Circuit that Corning
entertained a deliberate discriminatory intent to pay wages
based on sex.
The subjective intent of an employer is
irrelevant on this

issue.

Work on a steady night shift is

either performed under a similar working condition as work
during the day or it is not.

This is a matter of law.

Subjective intent should be meaningless on this question.
Why did the Second Circuit conclude as it did
that work on a steady night shift was performed under a
similar working condition as work during the day?'

The

Second Circuit in its opinion said that the issue was not
free from doubt.
Judge Friendly said to me from the bench during

oral argument5 "You’d have to pay me twice as much to work
at night."
The commonsense understanding of all people is
that there is not a similarity between working a steady night
shift and working during the day.

The medical and sociological

theories which we have set forth in detail in our brief in
pages 32 to 38, as well as the decisions of the War Labor
Board, the decisions of arbitrators, and the decisions of
the Court have recognized a substantial difference in these
working conditions.
Steady night work, the medical authorities say,
has a physical impact upon a human being.

The circadian

rhythms, as the doctors call them, are affected and
disrupted, the bodily rhythms are disrupted by steady night
shift work.

There is an ascertainable medical effect of the

work.
The Second Circuit arrived at the conclusion,
which seems contrary to everything that we understand, based
upon its reading of the legislative history, the Second.
Circuit concluded that the words "working conditions" as
used in the Act, were used in a technical sense rather than
in the common usage of words.
The legislative history relied upon was first the
testimony of job evaluation experts who testified before
the House of Representatives.

These people talked about the

8
term "working conditions" and they did not address the subject
of work on a steady night shift as opposed to day work.

They

were silent on that.
Judge Friendly of the Second Circuit concluded
that because job evaluation plans did not discuss night and
day as a difference under the term "working conditions,"
that the term "working conditions," because these gentlemen
testified before the Congress, was used in a technical sense
rather than the common usage of words.
Judge Friendly, in the Second Circuit's con­
clusion, said that these words were used in this statute in
a technical sense is squarely inconsistent with the statements
of Congressman Goodell.

Congressman Goodell was one of the

primary and perhaps the primary mover of this statute in the
Congress.

He read the committee report of the Committee on

Education and Labor on this Bill into the Congressional
Record.
Just before Congressman Goodell read the
committee report into the Congressional Record, he stated on
the same page of the Congressional Record a comment- which is
directly relevant to the Second Circuit's holding as to
whether these words were used in the technical sense and this
is set forth on page 24 of our blue brief.
Representative Goodell said this:

He said, "This

bill before us largely adopts my own personal views and most

9
of the words in this Bill derive from my proposal.

I would

like to make clear the legislative history and I think the
Chairman of the Subcommittee agrees on these points."
Representative Thompson

was the chairman of

that subcommittee and he was sitting there participating in
the debatesj as a review of our Addendum A will show.
Thompson did not stand up and say, "I disagree
with that."
Goodell went on to say, and this is directly
relevant to the Second Circuit's findings insofar as the
words being used in the technical sense.
includes a myriad of factors.
few.

Number one, "Skill

It is not limited to just a

It includes training, experience, education, the

qualities

of the person himself and a. good many other

factors that are too numerous to put into the bill specifically
so vie used a generality in referring to them.
"The same is true of effort.

The same is true

of responsibility and the same is true of similar working
conditions."
The author of the words and the Act, just before
he read the committee report into the Congressional Record,
stated that these terms and the very term that the Second
Circuit concluded was used in a technical sense, that these
terms are used as generalities.
Second, the Second Circuit relied upon a

paragraph from the committee report.

It is significant

that the Third Circuit Court of Appeals had the benefit of the
Second Circuits reasoning when the Third Circuit concluded
that the Second Circuit had

erroneously read this paragraph

and erroneously understood this paragraph in the committee
report upon which the Second Circuit relied.
The Third Circuit concluded that representative
Goodell had explained the very paragraph that the Second
Circuit relied upon in concluding that working conditions
did not encompass a steady night shift work as compared with
day work, that Representative Goodell had explained this very
paragraph in the Congre3slonal Record and this is set forth
in our brief at Addendum B-34 where Goodell, immediately
prior to reading the committee report into the Congressional
Record stated:
"Mr. Chairman, here are examples and general
guidelines as to the intent of Congress in enacting HR6060,
the Equal Pay for Women Bill," and he listed 15 specific,
well-prepared examples of the intent of Congress and they
follow and then follows the committee report.
Number 9 which appears on B-35 directly tracks
the Second Circuit’s ---- the paragraph of the committee report
relied upon

by the Second. Circuit and you will see that the

Third Circuit Court of Appeals set forth and tracked this
material in its opinion and this appears on page 28 of our

11
blue brief where the Second Circuit Court of Appeals set
forth on one side of the page of the Committee Report; on
the other side of the page Congressman Goode11’s explanation
of the paragraph relied upon by the Second Circuit.
1-Ie said, Goodeil said, "Ninth

" and this

directly goes to the question involved in this case —
"Finally, standing as opposed to sitting, pleasantness or
unpleasantness of surroundings, periodic rest periods, hours
of work, difference in shift, all would logically fall within
the working condition factor."
Goodeil, explaining this very paragraph relied
upon by the Second Circuit explicitly stated that the
committee, in reporting this bill out to the House, when it
used those words, was referring to the working condition
factor.
Vie think that the conclusion is inescapable,
that the Congress specifically intended that work on a
steady night shift should constitute a different working
condition than work during the day within the meaning of
this Act,
The Government has argued to us in its brief
that the term working condition means only hazards or
physical surroundings.

It seems to us absurd.

We suggest

that work during hours when human beings ordinarily sleep
is under a similar physical surrounding as work during hours

3.2

when human beings are ordinarily awake.
Vfe don't think that the Act will support that in
its language.

The legislative history clearly does not

support that.

The

medical and sociological authorities,

the Tar Labor Board decisions, the decisions of arbitrators,
there is no support in these authorities for this proposition.
We respectfully request on this issue 'that the
Second Circuit Court of Appeals be reversed and that this
Court affirm the decision of the Third Circuit Court of
Appeals, that work under a steady night shift is under a
different — is not under a similar working condition as
work during the day within the meaning of the Act.
The remaining two issues involve questions,
assuming a prior violation of the Act by Corning Glass Works QUESTION:

Before you get to those, Mr. Zimmerman

MR. ZIMMERMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Supposing that we were to conclude

uhat the difference in shift does represent a working
condition.

Does that end the judicial inquiry, even though a

finder of fact might conclude that notwithstanding the
difference in working conditions, there was actually some
sex discrimination built into the actual pay raise?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:
clearly does.

Your Honor, in my judgment, it

The Secretary has raised the question in its

brief that even if working conditions are similar, that

nevertheless the Act applies.

I don’t think that this can

be supported on any basis.
First, a reading of the plain language of the
Act, I think, will lead you to conclude that this should be
rejected.
Second, the Secretary’s regulations which are
set forth in our red brief •— I believe it is on page 8 —
specifically state that in order for the Equal Pay standard
to apply, the jobs must be performed under similar working
conditions.
In other words, the Equal Pay standard, according
to the Secretary's own regulations, simply doesn't apply
unless skill, effort and responsibility are equal and
working conditions are similar.
The legislative history also fully supports this
and I think an even more significant reason supports it,
your Honor, and that is reason, because there would be a
profound effect upon the application

of the Equal Pay Act

if the Secretary’s view of this issue were to be accepted
and that is this:
Courts would be forced to judge whether a
difference in skill, effort or responsibility or a
difference in working conditions was justified or justified
the difference in pay.

That would mean the courts would be

placed in the position of. in effect, evaluating the jobs 3

14
judging the wage bargain struck by labor and managements and
the

Secretary could compare any jobs simply by arguing that

the difference in skill was not commensurate with the
difference in pay and

I think that is the logical conclusion

that you arrive at, at which you must arrive if you adopt that
position.
Now, in addition, your Honor, I think it ties
into your question, the Secretary has argued that because
Corning Glass Works in 1944 agreed with the Union to pay a
steady night shift differential designated in the contract,
that that necessarily precludes a defense in this case.
Well, as far as I can see, that may go to the
issue of intent.

These jobs were created long prior to
' ’
<■

1944 and this rate differential was planned on. the base rate
and was created in the years 1925-1930.

I don’t think the

existence of that shift differential which came into
existence in 1944 proves anything, particularly when you
consider the fact that when the shift differential came into
existence in 1944 the New York District Court had found that
women were working on the steady night shift receiving the
higher steady night shift base rate and the shift differential,
coo.

bo at that time both men and women were getting it

because at that time the New York protective legislation
permitted women to work at night during World War II.
The second two issues are compliance issues.

They

we re only reached by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
They weren’t reached by the Third Circuit, which agreed with
us on the threshold issue and thus did not reach the com­
pliance question.
The facts that underlie the first compliance
issue are as follows:

On June 1, 1966, the steady night

shift jobs were opened to women.

This was by agreement of

Corning with the unions with which it bargained.

I am

referring now only to the facts in the hew York case
because they are the only facts that are relevant to these
issues.
By June 20, 1966, every female who worked in
the day shift jobs had the opportunity to accept employment
on the steady higher-rated steady night shift inspection
job.

It was a genuine integration.
Now, there were only four women during the year

1966 who accepted work

on these jobs but those four were

the most junior employees, female employees — three of those
female
four were the most junior/employees working in the steady
day shift jobs. Under the plant rights seniority system in
effect in Corning, New York, all of the other women who were
senior to these girls who took the job, had the opportunity
to take it and turned it down.
The Second Circuit reached the conclusion that —
I beg your pardon.

Let me go back for just a moment if I

16
may.

After that date, June 1, 1366, Corning did not

differentiate on the basis of sex.
was not violated.

Corning didn't treat men differently than

women after June 1.
body.

The statute on its face

Corning didn't reduce the rates of any­

It simply opened the jobs and paid women who worked

on those jobs the higher rate.

There was no rate reduction

in terms of th
the reduction proviso, at least in terms of the
language on it
The Secretary has contended successfully in the
Second Circuit that after that date, Corning continued to
violate the Act because by opening the jobs to the women, it
violated the proviso of the Act which states that an
employer may not reduce the wage rates of an employee in
order to come into compliance with the Act.
Really, that is the only way that the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals could have reached that conclusion
because clearly applying the language of the Act to those
facts, there is no violation.

It had. to conclude that the

reduction proviso was somehow violated.
How did it reach the conclusion that when nobody's

wage rot© was reduced, that the reduction proviso was
violated?
It reached that conclusion on the basis of the
legislative history,
things to say.

With respect to that, I just have two

First, we believe that resort to legislative
history is improper where the statute is not ambiguous.
Judge Friendly of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals did
not find that the proviso precluding the reduction of wage
rates was ambiguous.
V/e suggest that the Second Circuit's definition
of the term "shall not reduce" to require that employers
must increase the lower-rated job is not even a credible
definition

of the term.
The Second Circuit erred, and this is the

reason why the Second Circuit made the mistake it did.

The

Second Circuit erred because it relied on legislative
history which all occurred — and this is the sole reliance
that appears in the Second Circuit's opinion — it relied
on legislative history which all occurred in discussions
concerning HR386I which appears at Appendix C of the brief.
Now, HR386I didn't become the Equal Pay Act.

If

you look at page C~5 of our brief, you will see that HR386I
specifically requires that

'wage rates of the lower rated

job be raised to the high rated job over a two-year period
of time.

HR3861 — and these are the discussions that the

Second Circuit relied upon to compel -— to say that the
rate reduction proviso requires that the lower rated job be
increased — states "Except where such payment is made
pursuant to

I beg your pardon.

It says, "Provided that

3
an employer who on the date of this enactment is paying a
wage differential which would be in violation of the Act on
its effective date may adjust the lower wage rate as follows:"
And then one, two, three, and the third one says, "Two years
after the effective date of this Act, any remaining wage
differential shall be removed."
So HR3861 specifically required the raising of
the lower rate.
Judge Friendly of the Second Circuit — I’m not
sure whether they made the connection.

It doesn't appear

that they did — they relied on that legislative history
under that Bill which didn’t become law, to say that the
reduction proviso meant that you had to raise the rates.
How, if you look at the legislative history and
see the development and the evolution of this statutory
language from

HR3861 through to 6060, HR6060 which ultimately

became law and that appears also in an addendum to our brief,
you will see that this was a compromise, that both the
Secretary of Labor — Mr. Wirtz at that time •— and Congress­
men were unhappy with the prospect of forcing employers to
raise their wage rates, one.

Two, the wanted to leave more

latitude to the free processes of collective bargaining to
resolve these problems because these types of problems which
can involve seniority, can involve job bidding tendencies of
employees, can raise serious questions in terms of industrial

19
relations for an employer and the Congress specifically
pointed out a number of different locations and we have
cited those in our brief — that they wanted to reserve
latitude to employers and unions to comply with the Act in
a way which made sense in terms of their industrial relations
situation.

So they said, you must not reduce the rates of

anybody.
We believe that you will find that the legisla­
tive history read as a whole favors the view that Congress
intended to allow unions and companies to work out
compliance within the terms of the restriction and the
prohibition of the reduction proviso.
The statute required two things, that there be no
differentiation on the basis of sex where the work is equal.
Clearly, if there had been before, there was not after
June 1, 1966.
The second thing the statute said was, "Do not
reduce anyone’s wage rate."

We complied with both of the

mandates of the statute.
The third issue involves conduct subsequent to
January, 1969.

Its legal aspects are similar to Issue two.

I have very little time left and I would like to
save the time that I have remaining for rebuttal.

I think

that issue three is adequately covered in our brief.
that the legal precepts which are applicable to it are

I think

20
largely derived from those which I have discussed, in issue two.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well,

Mr. Zimmerman.
Mr. Tuttle.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. TUTTLE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF SECRETARY OF LABOR
MR. TUTTLE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

We believe that the Equal Pay Act forbids an
employer to pay a higher base wage to men working at night
than is paid to women doing the same work during the day
When certain other conditions obtain.
That is, when that higher base wage paid to men
working at night is paid in addition to a regular plantwide
shift differential compensating all employees for night work.
QUESTION:

Do you think there is any impediment in

this Act to a straight differential for night work?
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

Absolutely not.
Compared to day work.
And that is — the burden of my

first few moments remarks is to try and make crystal clear,
if I can, to the Court that the Secretary does not challenge
the propriety of paying night differentials and indeed, there
are some here.

I’d like to mention a second condition which we
think makes this base wage illegal.

In addition to the fact

that this base wage which we are challenging is added on to a
shift differential, there is the fact that it is historically
shown to have been paid to induce men to do what the men
considered female work.
Now, no one, least of all the Secretary of Labor,
doubts that night work is more burdensome and in Coming's
brief, you will find discussions of circadian rhythms and
such things.

We agree with all of that, that night work

can be more burdensome, can be more psychologically stressful.
And the Secretary has never questioned Coming's right to
pay a night shift differential.
QUESTION:

You do not concede that that is a

working condition, though, as I understand it.
MR. TUTTLE:
working condition.

We do not concede that it is a

The Act provides, in addition to a

definition of equal work, provides a number of additional
justifications for inequalities in pay and these can be
under a system of rewarding merit or quantity or quality of
production or any other factor other than sex and we would
argue that time of day work is clearly a factor other than
sex, which would justify a pay difference.
We do not believe it is a working condition
because of the technical way in which we believe that term is

22

used In the Act.
Nov;, the Secretary's own regulations do recognise
the propriety of paying night shift differentials and in fact,
Corning has paid its night workers a
since 19^4.

shift differential

At the time of the trial, the shift differentials

In this case, night shift differentials for regular non­
rotating night work was 16 cents an hour and it is not
questioned in this lawsuit.
We believe that the most crucial point that we
would like to leave with the Court today is the fact that
that 16 cents per hour, the negotiated shift differential. Is
not challenged In these lawsuits.

We believe It is entirely

proper and justified as a factor other than sex justifying a
wage difference.
The pay difference we do challenge Is a wholly
different pay difference and we believe it is one ithat arose
in a context in the setting which shows it to have been
sex-based and illegal under the Equal Pay Act.
Now, a little of the history has been suggested
to you already but there are a number of other factors which
we believe require mention.
In 1920 to 1925, Corning did not have a night
shift.

It had a day and an afternoon shift and the women

did ail of the inspection work and they were paid about 20
to 30 cents an hour for that work.

23
When it became necessary to hire men for the
night shift •— and that was necessary because of state
protective laws forbidding women to work at night ■— Corning
started paying the men 53 cents an hour to do the same work,
exactly the same work, and Coming's own witnesses testified
that this was because the men just wouldn't work at the
women's wage, that they considered Inspection work demeaning,
that they considered it feminine work and they would not
work unless they were paid the going male wage, which they
received.
Now, we think it is perfectly clear from this
record that that double pay had nothing to do with the fact
that the work was being done at night and we consider the
proof of that the fact that in all of Coming's other jobs,
in the all-male jobs, precisely the same pay was received
on all three shifts and it was only the men doing the
demeaning female work who got a bonus, who got paid twice
what the women got for doing the inspection work.
Now, in 19*i'j Corning was unionized and did begin
to pay a regular plantwide shift differential.

At the time,

that was 5 cents an hour but that differential was simply
tacked on top of the higher base wage they were already
receiving.
Nov;, the men inspectors at night were getting two
premiums, one 101- doing female work and another for doing it

at night.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tuttle, when we are talking about

a night shift, is that the traditional swing shift, or is it a
graveyard shift?
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

It is a 12:00 to 8:00 —
12:00 to 8:00.
— regular nonrotating night workers,

12:00 to 8:00.
Now, I want to stress again, perhaps too often,
that that second differential, the regular night shift
differential, is not challenged in these law suits.
Now, in 19*14, after Corning was unionized, it
undertook a process of systematic job evaluation.

We consider

this systematic job evaluation, done with outside consultants,
to be of critical importance in this law suit, for two reasons.
One, because it shows that Corning itself evaluated the day
and night inspection work as equal and secodly, because as
I’ll be showing in a minute, Coming’s own definitions of
job evaluation were explicitly adopted by Congress when it
'was defining equal work in the Equal Pay Act.
When Corning evaluated day and night inspection
work and gave points to every factor in the job, they gave
exactly the same number of points to the day and the night
work.

They continued to pay a higher rate to men but they

themselves evaluated the jobs as precisely equal in all

25
respects and most significantly, they evaluated it as equal
in respective working conditions and working conditions
Corning defined as physical surroundings and hazards and not,
I should say, time of day work.
Now, the Equal Pay Act contains a definition of
equal work which requires that the work be performed in a
situation which requires similar or equal skill, effort and
responsibility and that it be performed under similar
working conditions.
It then has the exceptions that I mentioned,
merit, seniority, quantity or quality of production or a
factor other than sex.
Now, Coming’s principal contention here today
is that the same work performed at night and performed during
the day is not performed under "similar working conditions"
as that term is used within the Act.

Corning concludes

from this that the Act is simply inapplicable to it, no
matter how discriminatory and sex-based its wage structure
might be.
We think that the legislative history here shows
that Congress knowingly adopted a technical meaning and a
scientific meaning for the word, "working conditions."

Since

Congress explicitly adopted the language of job evaluation
such as Corning, we believe that it adopted the word
"working conditions" in the sense in which it was used and

26
is used to this day in job evaluation.
The original Bill, the original Equal Pay Bill,
would have called for equal pay in circumstances where work
was perfo3?raed with equal skill.
Wow, industry representatives objected to this.
They claimed that it failed to take account of the relevant
factors in job evaluation.

Mr. Hester, who was at the time

Corning1s director of Industrial Relations Research, testified
before Congress and he urged Congress to adopt the language
of job evaluation and the elements of job evaluation.
said, skill is not enough.

He

There are other factors to be

considered and he urged Congress to define equal work in
terms of skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions
and he went further; he explicitly told Congress what working
conditions were.
"Working conditions,"he said, "comprise the sub­
factors of physical surroundings and hazards."
Nov;, time of day work is not a working condition
within the language of job evaluation.

One of Coming's

other experts testified at trial that time of day work is
what they call a wage condition.

It is like working Saturdays

or Sundays or working overtime but it is not a working
condition as that is defined in systematic job evaluation.
Now, in response —
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that really, as

27
used in this statute, the term working condition means some­
thing different from what it means in the broad area of
collective bargaining?
MR. TUTTLE:

Well, I am saying that it had over

the years acquired a specialized technical meaning that was
incorporated into the Act.

VJe are not suggesting for a

moment that night work is not something other than day work
and we are not suggesting for a moment that somebody who
works at night shouldn't be paid, as Judge Friendly said
during the argument below, "twice as much."
We are not concerned with the amount and that
is a question for negotiation between the parties' and here
at the time of these lawsuits, the parties had negotiated a
16 cent per hour difference, for that difference.
QUESTION:

Would your case be any different if

the testimony before Congress about the meaning of working
conditions had come from somebody other than a Corning
witness?
MR. TUTTLE:

No, no, that is just a cute element.

We think that it is interesting and therefore brought it
out in the briefs and here.

No, what is important is what

Congress did and if it had come from United States Steel, the
question would still be, what was presented to them and what
they did with what was presented to them.
QUESTION:

Other statutes, other labor statutes

28
have the term working conditions.
Relations Act, for example.

The National Labor

What you are saying to us, I

gather, is that the meaning in that Act, of working conditions,
is different because here it was given —
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

A specialised meaning.
— specialized in the context of

evaluation.
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

Yes, and I would like to elaborate —
That, then, is a narrower definition

than would be given the same term in the National Labor
Relations Act?
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

I think that is true, yes.
Mr. Tuttle, how do you dispose of

Congressman Goodell's comments that Corning places such
great reliance on?
MR. TUTTLE:

I can’t dispose of them, Mr. Justice.

There is no question that he said what
said.

he said what he

I think that our feeling is that this was. a single

remark by one Congressman who was not the sponsor of the
Bill.
QUESTION:
the sponsor of 6060?

Well, when you say that, you say not
He certainly was interested in this

legislation, was he not?
MR. TUTTLE:

He was involved in the legislation

and in fact had introduced a Rill which differed in the

29
respect that it would have called for work under equal
working conditions and not similar working conditions.
QUESTION:
the

I doubt if you can relegate him to

back seat in Congress as an —■
MR. TUTTLE:

No, I don't propose to.do that.

What I do want to do is call your attention to certain
suggestions and direct statements in the House Reports which
we think show a direct response to the testimony that I have
just outlined.

The Bill, as you know, was amended to define

equal work in just the terms that I have mentioned and that
Mr. Hester mentioned, equal skill, effort and responsibility
and the Congressional Reports specifically show that the
language of job evaluation was deliberately adopted, thus
in the House Report it was said, after they defined equal
work in terms of the factors I have mentioned, "These factors
will be found —" the report said, "In the majority of the
job classification systems.

Thus it is anticipated that a

bona fide classification system that does not discriminate on
the basis of sex will serve as a valid defense to a charge
of discrimination."
Now, the Second Circuit found this persuasive as
an explanation of how this Bill took shape and the Third
Circuit Ignored it altogether, focusing instead upon the
remarks of

Congressman Goodell, which have been outlined to

you and our submission is simply that where a technical term

30

is deliberately adopted, by Congress, it ought to be considered
and it ought to be considered to have been used in the
technical fashion.
QUESTION:

Suppose hypothetically the Court should

find that the night and day difference is, in fact, a working
condition under this Act?

Where does that take you in this

case?
MR. TUTTLE:

It takes me to my next point,

I-Ir. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

All right.
Which is that even if the Court

should find that time of day work were a working condition,
we

believe that under the peculiar circumstances of this

case that the jobs are nonetheless equal.

Now,, it is plain

that the higher base rate which I have described is a sexbased wage.

As Judge Friendly said below, the plain fact is

that the differentials here at issue arose because the men
would not work at the low rates paid to women daytime
inspectors to perform what the men called "female xvork."
QUESTION:

You don't suggest that that is an

attitude in industry generally on the part of employees in
factories?
MR. TUTTLE:

No, we are not making any suggestion

about any other employer than this one and we are really, you
have to go back into the history to even get this attitude.

31
This payment arose in the 1920' s and *30's.
has historically been carried forward.

It

I don’t know what

Coming's subjective motivation is now but a tradition was
established where men v;ere paid more.

What Coming's

attitude is towards women may have changed, but the fact is,
they still discriminate against them.
QUESTION:

Nov/ —

Well, is this alternative argument

applicable also?
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

Excuse me?
Is your alternative argument also

applicable to the Pennsylvania plant?
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:
identical.

Yes.
Is there a similar record?
Oh, the records are virtually

The only difference Is that the Pennsylvania

court, having found —having defined this —- having

deter­

mined this was not a working condition —
QUESTION:

Well, suppose we should disagree with

you on that?
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

Suppose —?
Supose we should agree with the

Third Circuit that It is not a working condition?
QUESTION:

That it is.

QUESTION:

That it is a working condition.

MR. TUTTLE:

Then you should consider whether1 or

32
not the factor here — you see3 our contention is that the
factor of night work where it is separately compensated for
by a negotiated difference is effectively eliminated from the
Act as a consideration in evaluating the quality of the work.
Our contention — our submission is that working
conditions of time as a working condition are made similar
by the fact of a payment of a discreet and complete separate
compensation for that element.
The New York case, for instance, the' rDistrict
r
r," 'nfs

Court said in considering this question, "We believe that the
element of working less desirable night hours was', in the
language of the Court, taken care of by the fact: of a payment
of a plantwide shift differential.
Now, I!d like to suggest that —
QUESTION:

Mr.

Tuttle, I am still puzzled — is

there any difference between these two cases on this argument
you are now making?
MR. TUTTLE:

There is no difference on this

argument.
QUESTION:
don't you?

Well, but you do have different records,

I mean, so far as I could tell from the reports

said, the District Court in Pennsylvania didn't get into the
factual detail that the District Court in the Western District
of New York did.
MR. TUTTLE:

Well, once you — if you were to

33-34
decide with us that time of day work was not a working
condition, or if it was a working condition, that it was out
of the case because it xvas separately compensated, then you
would have to look at the record in that case to consider
Coming's other defenses and the record is factually, in
some respects, different.

There is, in the Pennsylvania

case, some evidence of difference in effort required in one
of the job classifications, any how.
And it would require a further study of the
record, although there have been supplemental findings made
which would enable a determination to be made on all of
Coming’s defenses.
I wanted to add on this —■
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

Mr. Tuttle, while you are interrupted —
Yes?
Let's put aside the peculiarities of

the Corning ca.se here, such as the claim that no matter what,
the differential originated as a sex determination.

Just in

the ordinary case, what difference would it make whether a
shift differential which you concede is warranted — I take it
you concede that higher pay for night work is not a violation
of the Act.
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

Of course.
Now, what difference does it make

whether you say the reason that it isn't is that it is a

35
working condition or that it is under the other more general —
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

You mean, the factors other than sex?
Yes.

MR. TUTTLE:

Well, if you were to conclude that

it was a 'working condition and if you were to reject my
argument with respect to separate compensation taking that
difference out of the case, then you xvould conclude that the
Act was inapplicable.
Whereas, if you look at the factor other than
sex justification and analyse this case and try and decide
whether this difference Is justified by a factor other than
sex. I assure you, you will conclude that it is not.
QUESTION:

Well, I know that is this case, but

normally if you — if a union and management negotiate for
a separate identifiable additional compensation for night
work, applicable to everybody who works at night, I take it
that you would agree that -MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

I wouldn’t be here.
Now, why would that differential not

violate the Act?
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

Well, because —
And would it make any difference which

answer you give, whether because it is a working condition or
it is not a sex-oriented factor?
MR. TUTTLE:

Only if you have the peculiar

historical anomaly, which you have here, of two different
differentials.
QUESTION:

All right, only then in a unique case

such as this?
MR. TUTTLE:

I think this case is quite

unique.

I am hard put to think of too many other circumstances where
you will have a

separately compensated factor where the

difference in the value of that factor has been separately
negotiated.
QUESTION:

Supposing you have a shift

differential where people on the night shift get $6 an hour,
people on the day shift get $3 an hour, and you also show
that the day shift is 50-50 men and women, the night shift
Is 90 percent men, 10 percent itfomen.

Now, under your

version of the Act, is the Secretary or a private suitor
'

.

:V q

entitled to have a factual finding as to whether what
purports to be a shift differential, in fact, has a sex
component in it?
MR. TUTTLE:

No, I don't think so.

One of the

things I wanted to suggest is that I don't think our
interpretation puts the court In the business of job
evaluation.

Here It is not the Court but it Is the parties

who have -— the Corning and the Union — who have separately
negotiated and agreed on the value of night work and they
agreed on that when they negotiated a value of 16 cents an

37
hour for everyone doing night, work.
were getting 16 cents an

The only people who

hour, plus another 20 cents, are

the people on the night shift doing the inspection job, doing
the women's work at night and it is a case where the parties
themselves have agreed on the value of that element and I
don't think it will put the courts in the.business of
comparing loss of ’wages or deciding on what a fair wage is.
I have only a few moments left and I'd like to
move to the second point , if I may, which is Coming's
argument that it complied with the Act when — Well, it
argues that assuming the jobs are equal, as we have argued,
that Corning achieved compliance with the Act in June of
1966 when it began to permit women to bid for regular jobs
on the night shift as vacancies occurred.
I should note they weren't able to simply move
into those jobs.

They had to wait for vacancies and then

exercise their seniority.
Now, every appellate court that has considered
this argument has rejected it.

They have all rejected the

contention that an employer can comply with the Act 'without
equalizing wages, which is what Corning argues that it has
done.
Now, the declared purpose of the Equal Pay Act
is to correct depressed wages and living standards caused
by the historic undervaluation of women’s work.

President

38
Kennedy said of the Act that it was designed to provide
reasonable levels of income for women and in order to provide
this, the Act has a — what we have called the "No-reduction
proviso."

It doesn't allow you

to achieve compliance by

reducing anybody•s wage and we submit that what that means
Is that you have to equalize the wages without reducing the
preferential hire wage and that means to raise the lower
wage to the level of the higher and indeed, the House Report
on this case — on this Act explicitly says that the lower
wage must be raised to the level of the higher and that
House Report has been relied upon repeatedly by* the Courts
that have found that that is what is required for compliance
under this Act.
Now, we think the day inspection rate for women
is demonstrably a depressed female wage.
by looking at the record.

You can see this

For instance, although Corning

has historically valued, when it began systematic job
evaluation, has valued day and night and man and woman
inspection work equally, It has always paid the women less
for work that they value as equal; not only has it paid them
less, but it paid the women less than male utility workers
whose job evaluation points are even lower than the lowest
woman inspector.
Our submission is that the vice of unequal pay
for equal work can’t be cured by allowing some but not all of

39
the persons receiving the lower wage to bid. for an
opportunity to do the same work at a higher wage.

The Equal

Pay principle Is not satisfied by allowing some of the daytime
inspectors to bid for an opportunity to do the same work at
night at a higher wage.

All the other daytime workers — and

in this case the record will show they are virtually all
women — In 1968, 211 were women and 3 were men on the day­
time shift — virtually all of these women are left
receiving a depressed wage which is precisely what the EqualPay Act was designed to remedy and in fact, there is even
evidence of a more direct violation of the no-reduction
proviso here because the record shows there are some instances
Where men earning the higher pay at night were transferred to
the daytime shift and there they got the lower wage.
Now, I don’t think that the discussion of the
history of H.R. 3840, which you heard, indicates anything
different about what is required by the Act because that
Act, 3840, although it had a stepped system of raising
wages, was not so terribly explicit that wages always had to
be raised because it had a system of negotiated compliance
which might have allowed, in certain circumstances, a
negotiated compliance where the lower wages were not
necessarily raised to the level of the higher and this
feature, the absence of a flat ban on reduction, was
criticized In this Bill and after It was criticized, the

Bill was redrafted to contain the flat ban against reduction
which is now part of the Equal Pay Act and it was after that
that the House said the lower wage rate must be raised to
the level of the higher.
Comings last argument is that it achieved
compliance in January 20 of 19&9 when it set new rates for
all three shiftss day, afternoon and night and the rates
were equal and of course, we agree that in January of '69,
if that is all Corning had done, it would have achieved
compliance.

But Corning did not stop at this point.

At the

same time and by virtue of the same agreement, it established,
retroactive to November 4th, a higher wage for nighttime
inspectors, the higher retroactive rate being even higher
than the January 20 rate.
It then red-circled those rates which is to say
that it provided that any

night shift inspector with

seniority on January 20, 1969 would continue to receive the
retroactively-established higher rate, even after the
January 20th rates came into effect.
QUESTION:

Well, absent the red-circle rates,

would you be here?
MR. TUTTLE:
January,

*69?

No.

You mean with respect to after

No, of course not.

We agree that the

leveling of the rates is exactly what is required, or would
have been required but what we say is, this is simply a

41
technique3 a device to perpetuate the same discrimination.
QUESTION:

Well,, let’s assume with the red-circle

rates that after a certain date,

everybody was receiving

the same pay.
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

No.

No, what happened -—

No what?

Would you be here if every­

body after a certain date had been receiving —
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:
the

We would only be here for back pay.
How far back?
Well, there is a stipulation amongst

parties in the New York case that if back pay is owing,

it Is owing since November 1st of '64.
In the Pannsylvania case —
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

To whom?
— which was brought later, it is —
Owing to whom?
Owing to the employees who received

the discriminatory wage, the daytime inspectors.
You see, this is an amendment to the Fair Labor
Standards Act .
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

I understand that.
It is a part of the remedies under

42
the Acts as I am sure, Mr. Justice, you are aware, is that
where you have been paid a substandard wage, you can get
back pay.
QUESTION:

No, but I just wondered who would be

entitled to back pay?
MR. TUTTLE:

We believe that the day time

inspectors are entitled to back pay.
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

Back to ’60 —
Back to '64.

They have all been

receiving at least 20 cents or in the neighborhood of
20 cents less an hour.
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

And —
For work which is rated and by

hypothesis is equal -— I mean, by hypothesis —
QUESTION:

And also I suppose, night time

inspectors who don’t have the grandfather higher pay.
MR. TUTTLE:

Well, there aren't any of those

since January 20 because there were so many people on layoff
that it is going to be some time before anybody gets this
night time January 20 raise.

They are all getting a higher

raise and we believe that It is perfectly clear that this
was not intended, as Corning has suggested —
QUESTION:

And when was night time inspection

opened up to everybody?
MR. TUTTLE:

In New York, June 1 of '66.

43
QUESTION:

In !66.

Now, at that time, all night

time inspectors were not being paid the same, were they?
MR. TUTTLE:

No, nighttime inspectors received

the same rate.
QUESTION:

All of them?

MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Even after — when the nighttime

differential went in, I thought that —
Well, the nighttime differential

MR. TUTTLE::

.

went In in 1944.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

The initial higher —
All right, how about the plant-wide -

MR. TUTTLE:

In 1944 was when they adopted a

plant-wide differential.

It was in 1925 through 1930 that

when men first went on night x^ork they were paid a double
wage.

Twenty years later, in 1944, the night workers began

not only night inspectors but everybody began to get a plant
wide shift differential and we have no quarrel with the
shift differential.

But the first differential has been

maintained, one way or another, up to this very day.
QUESTION:

Well, I agree with that.

QUESTION:

Well, I thought you said

'66 it all

leveled off.
MR. TUTTLE:

In 1966 women were allowed to

exercise their seniority.
QUESTION:

I thought you said that, except for

the night differential, all wages for comparable work
leveled off.
MR. TUTTLE:

No, no.

Both differentials remained

in effect until January of '69 and

in January of '69, they

established an equal wage on all shifts.

Of course, there

was still a night shift differential and that would have been
compliance but for the fact of the red-circling of those
rates.
QUESTION:

So that on the same shift people were

getting different pay.

MR. TUTTLE:

No, because there was no one getting

the January 20 —
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

The plan was that they would.
Eventually.

Eventually.

After

January 20 of 1969.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tuttle, if the red-circle system

had not been taken care of from *69 on, would there have been
an economic strike?
MR. TUTTLE:

I'm sorry.

Would you repeat the

question?
QUESTION:

MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

If the red-circle system had not been Imposed.
— carried on from '69 on, would

45
Corning have been subjected to an economic strike?
MR. TUTTLE:

There is nothing in the record on

that.
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

What do you think?
It would be speculation on my part.

Our point with respect to that rate is — I don't think there
would have been because I think that since it is a subterfuge,
it could have been explained — it could have been avoided
by explaining to the union that here we are required by
federal laxtf to achieve an equality and we are doing

it and

therf is no way that we can protect a higher wage for you
men working at night without being in violation of' federal
law and I don't think the union would have found, that to be
of sufficient basis to engage in an economic strike.
I have taken more than my time.

I appreciate

the Court's indulgence.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Tuttle.

Mr. Zimmerman, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT F. ZIMMERMAN, ESQ.
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Yes, I do, if I may, your Honor.

May It please the Court:
Basically, the Secretary’s argument seems to be
that It depends on what you call it.

If you call the

differential pay for night work a shift differential, it is
all right, the Secretary says.

It is not going to look behind

that word to see what the intent really was.

I think

Justice Rehnquist’s question was a good question and showed
the fallacy in the what-you-call-it argument.
The what-you-call-lt argument is, I think, purely
a semantical argument and without substance.
The Secretary spent approximately 10 minutes in
the course of his oral argument discussing Coming's deliberate
discriminatory intent in 1925.

It would be a great injustice

to have these cases turn on Coming’s intent in 1925 when
none of the witnesses who testified even worked for Corning
Glass

Works in 1925 and all of the testimony — and there

were only about three lines on this subject — was pure
'

• <

speculation as to why Corning had to pay this higher rate.
The same witness who said that also speculated -—
who said that the Government has suggested that It was paid
in order to induce men to do this work which they regarded
as demeaning female work.

The same witness also said that it

was paid in order to persuade them to work the undesirable
hours and It was paid for a number of other reasons.
Now, I don’t think that this case should, under
this Act, turn upon how you label the rate differential.

I

don't think that the subjective Intent of the employer has
any relevance at all to the question of whether this is a
working condition.

I think that all of the evidence and all

of the legislative history and the plain meaning of the

47
language of the Act will support it.
Certainly, there Is a duty — as Mr. Justice
Brennan pointed out when he inquired after the term "working
conditions" as used in other federal statutes.

When Section

8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act states that
employers and unions have a duty to bargain over wages, hours
and working conditions, I think that a union man and a
management man in the National Labor Relations Board x^ould
burst out laughing if you were to suggest that work on a
steady night shift if not a working condition out of which a
duty to bargain arises.
Clearly, it is,
Congress previously is —
QUESTION:

I mean, this term as used by the
clearly encompasses this term.

Well, if we

were to hold that there

may be a differential, whether unilaterally fixed by the
employer or negotiated with a bargaining contract, under a
i.- v •

, •'

'

■'

bargaining contract, does that get you home free?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Your Honor, I don't think so.

I

think the issue to which this Court must address itself or
should address itself, I would suggest, is the question of
whether work on a steady night shift is a similar working
condition within the meaning of that term as it is used in
the Equal Pay Act to day work.
Mow, it is interesting enough that in the
Congressional Record, Congress addressed itself to the problem

48
to the question of the meaning of attaching this Act as an
amendment to the Pair Labor Standards Act;, Equal Pay Act.
It said — and this deals directly with the
Secretary’s argument — Mr. Goodell said, on page B-27 of our
Addendum to our brief, "Vie do not expect .the Department of
Labor people to go into an establishment and attempt to rate
jobs that are not equal.

We do not want to hear the

Department say, ’Well, they amount to the same thing.,' and
evaluate them so that they came up to the same skill in point.”
Now —
QUESTION:
I confess.

I am lost a little bit, Mr. Zimmerman,

Mr. Tuttle said that of course he agrees that a

night shift can be

paid a different rate from the day shift

and you have spent a good deal of time in both your brief
and your oral argument to that same effect.
Now, if you both agree on that, then it might
not be

difficult for the Court to agree with you.

I am not

sure, but it might not be.
MR. ZIMMERMAN:
QUESTION:

Nell, I've been —

But I don’t understand your last

answer that seems to suggest that it does solve the problem
and then it seems to go the other way, that it doesn’t solve
the problem.
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Well, perhaps I didn’t fully

appreciate the significance of your question, your Honor.

I

49
think perhaps I have been thinking about this problem in
terms of analysing the statutory language so that I failed to
appreciate a question ordinarily stated to me.
I think that a differential based ■— I think that
a difference in money which is paid for work on a steady
night shift and only for work on a steady night shift, is
not unlawful under this statute regardless of how it is
labeled.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought Mr. Tuttle agreed with

tnat.
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Well, If he does, then I don’t

know why we are in this Court because I think that he has
rejected that as a solution to this case.
QUESTION:

You had two different ones.

One was

16 and one was 20 more.
MR. ZIMMERMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Are you going to get to that?

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Well, I will, your Honor.

The history of this rate Is interesting and I
think I can state It briefly.

In 1925, Corning Glass Works

began to produce ware, its product, in such great quantities
that It could no longer inspect it all during the day.
Previously, it had been able to perform all the inspection
work during the day, although as hot glass plants, as you
can Imagine, are working on rotating shifts around the clock,

50
but the inspectors were able to work during the day.
Women performed this work.

Women were not

permitted to work during the night because both in Pennsyl­
vania and New York, New York and Pennsylvania protective
legislation prohibited the employment of women at night.
The hours during which this night shift was
established exactly coincided with the New York and Penn­
sylvania laws.

The hours were 10:00 p.m. at night to

6:00 a.m. in the morning.

They hired men to do it.

Women

could not be hired because of the New York law.
There was a difference in base rate paid.
can speculate as to the reasons.

You

I don't think that this

record will support that anybody really knows, wl'£h any
degree of certainty at all, why this was done in 1925«

There

weren't any people around to testify who were in positions of
authority who had any idea.
This rate differential continued through 1944
when Corning Galas Works was organized by the American
Flint Glassworkers Union in both its Pennsylvania and New
York plants.

When the union organized the company and sat

down and negotiated a contract in 1944, the contract provided
for wage increases over and above the existing rates that
were already paid so the result was that they applied a two
or three percent wage increases to the

existing base rates

and solidified into the contract the prior differential that

had been paid only for steady night work and the record shows
that the women received it when they worked during World
War II.
This contract also provided for the first time a
shift differential.

Now,, the union didn’t go back and say*

since we are negotiating a shift differential* we are going
to let the company take this money back that it has been
paying these steady night shift workers.
rate into the contract.

It cemented that

The shift differential was applied

on top of it and the shift differential was thereafter
received by everybody.
The steady night shift differential and base rate
which had its origin in 1925 was also received by everybody
who worked at night and only by people who worked at night.
Now, on a deposition, a witness — oh, I see ~~
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Go ahead. : .We need to

know a little more about this.
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

On deposition, a witness was asked

the question, and this was a witness who was not employed by
Corning Glass Works until some time in the very late 1930’s,
1939-19^0 -— was asked the question by the Government, why
did Corning

Glass Works pay this higher rate in 1925?

Fifteen years before he went to work there, and he responded
by saying a number of diffex’ent things, one of which was —
"And I suppose that the men who were skilled glassworkers

considered this inspection work to be demeaning female work.”
The Second Circuit hung its hat on that comment
and the Government has lambasted us urith it through two
circuit courts of appeal.

I think it xvould be a great

injustice to have this case turn upon that kind of speculation
when all of the objective evidence in the case shows that it
has been paid only for work on a steady night shift and never
for work during the day.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, thank you,

gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:19 o’clock a.m., the case
was submitted.]
