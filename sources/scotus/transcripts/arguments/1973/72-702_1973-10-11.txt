PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

now of docket No. 72-702, Golden State Bottling Company
against the Labor Board.
Mr. Jackson, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF
MORTON B. JACKSON, ESQ.
MR. JACKSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and

may it please the Court:
I would like to address myself briefly, If the
Court please, to the general approach taken by the Board
arguing in support of its point of view with respect to the
two specific limitations on its power.

I am speaking of

the limitation contained in Section 10 (c) of the Act itself,
the limitations contained in Rule 65, particularly 65-D of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
I think those limitations are the ones that the
Board has attempted to dispense with in reaching the result
that it reached in this case on this successorship issue
which is the heart of this case.
The Board, and the writers, tend to sweep these
limitations aside.

Of course the 10(c), the heart of that,

again, is that — states that the Board's remedial powers
must be exercised only against those who have actually

engaged in unfair labor practices or are engaging in them and
the language of Section 65(d), which had such penetrating
analysis in the Regal Knitwear case, has to do with the
circumstances under which a successor or an assigned may be
drawn within ambient of an order directed to a wrongdoer.
Nov;, as I say, the Board tends to shut these off,
really, by saying, first

— it is also in the same section,

10(c), given broad remedial powers to effectuate the Act and
considered in the light of this, the end it has in mind here
really justifies the means as taken and it tends to treat the
limitations imposed by the two sections I have just mentioned
as something rather technical or rather arbitrary and — not
arbitrary, but technical, at any rate and something that must
give way before an argument addressed to considerations of
substance, such as this, effectuating the policies of the Act.
In answer to that, I would say, first, and I think,
again, that it is fundamental, is that both of these sections
are not technical.

Their terms embody provisions of funda­

mental substance and they articulate fundamental protections.
I think, throughout, it is well to bear in mind
that what we are talking about is affording a party a hearing,
yes, and that the one of the vices inherent in what the Board
has done is to deny a party a hearing.
But, even more fundamental than that, and even more
profound a vice, is the vice which lies in imposing sanctions

5
for illegal conduct, for wrongdoing, against a party who is
guiltless of any wrongdoing, who is totally innocent of any
wrongful conduct.

This is what we are getting at.

So, these are not just technical limitations, they
are limitations which contain expression, the embodiment of
protections of considerable substance and can't simply be
swept aside.
Q

Is there any disagreement as to the applicability

of Federal Rule 65(d) to the Labor Board?
MR. JACKSON:

I think not, your Honor.

It

certainly sort of went without saying in the Regal Knitwear
case, the language "successors and assigns" has regularly
been used in these orders and they would be —
Q

Of course, by its terms, I always thought that

Federal rules are applicable to the Federal courts.
MR. JACKSON:

This is true, but I think that what

the Court addressed itself to in the Regal Knitwear case was
the fact that the courts were going to be called upon to
enforce these orders and what Justice Jackson said in Regal
Knitwear was that no order can be enforced, no order which
contains language which exceeds the limitations of Rule 65(d)
can be enforced by a court and, to the extent that the
court’s enforcement powers are limited, quite clearly, they
apply to the Labor

Board, also.

However, an answer to each of these considerations

6
each on its merits that the Board has advanced is, again,
contained in this very remarkable decision in the Regal
Knitwear case.

I would invite the Court’s attention, first

off, to a very trenchant statement of policy made by the
Court in the Southern Steamship case where it says,
sufficient for this case,"

"It is

this Court speaking again on this

end justifying the means argument, "It is sufficient for this
case to observe that the Board has not been commissioned to
effectuate the policies of the National Labor Relations Act
so singlemindedly that it may ignore the equally important
Congressional objectives."
Justice Jackson echoes this sentiment when he says
in Regal Knitwear that this language about broad remedial
powers in order to effectuate the policies of the Act
containing its own limitation — he points out in the following
language, that these pox^ers must be exercised within the limits
of the authority bestowed by the statute.
Administrative agencies have considerable
latitude to shape their remedies within the scope of their
statutory authority and then he goes on to say that the court
may not grant, in the celebrated language, "an enforcement
order or an injunction so broad as to make punishable the
conduct of persons who act independently and whose rights
have not been adjudged according to law."
Now, again, it is suggested by the writers and,

7
notably,

Professor Goldberg in the Northwestern Lav: Review

who is cited by the Board in its brief on page 21 and, indeed,
whose views find reflection throughout in the Board’s brief,
that Regal Knitwear doesn’t really mean what it says and, in
any event, it has left the door open by language in giving
two examples.

The court gives two examples.

It suggests,

for example, the successive concept could apply in a situation
where the successor is merely a disguised

continuance of the

predecessor and, therefore, has substantial identity with
him, or where the succession itself, the transfer has been
utilized simply as a means of evading or avoiding the thrust
or the force of the order.
Q

Mr. Jackson, is there, at issue here, both your

client’s liability

for premerger, preacquisition backpay and

MR. JACKSON:
Q

— post acquisition backpay?
MR. JACKSON:

Q

Yes, indeed, your Honor.

And reinstatement?
MR. JACKSON:

Q

Yes, indeed.

That is correct.

The successor —

Now, for preacquisition backpay, there had been

an adjudicated liability?
MR. JACKSON:

That is correct and that is not

disputed as far as the predecessor is concerned.
Q

Yes, I understand.
MR. JACKSON:

They owe

that.

We do not dispute that.

Of course,

8
the method of computation has been disputed.
Q

How, in mergers, normally, under state law,

you can’t get away with evading your clear debts by transferring
away your property and did the succeeding corporation here
assume any debts of the predecessors?
MR. JACKSON:
only.

It assumed specified obligations

There were certain specified obligations set out in the

sale agreement and it assumed only those.
Q

Which would certainly be normal.
MR. JACKSON:

That is customary.

This was an

asset purchase, your Honor.
Q

Yes.
MR. JACKSON:

It was not a merger and not a

statutory merger, such as —
Q

It was an asset purchase and you assumed certain —
MR. JACKSON:

Certain specified obligations only,

the successor did, All American and these were specifically
enumerated.

This particular item was not one of them.

The

predecessor —
Q

I suppose perhaps, under state law, if the

predecessor didn’t pay it, you might have to.
MR. JACKSON:

I think under the cases we’ve cited,

for this particular obligation, the reverse would be true,
your Honor, because —
Q

Under state law?

9
MR. JACKSON:
Q

Under state law, yes.

Even though it was an adjudicated liability of the

predecessor?
MR. JACKSON:
Q

You mean, under state law —
MR. JACKSON:

Q

That is correct.

We’ve cited one case in our brief.

— the seller of assets can avoid the payment of a

judgment by —
MR. JACKSON:

Not the seller.

Not the seller,

the purchaser.
Q

That is what I am talking about.
MR. JACKSON:

Oh, I beg your pardon, your Honor,

I beg your pardon, I misunderstood your Honor.
The seller certainly cannot avoid it.
Q

Well, I know, but wouldn’t it remain a claim on

the assets he conveys away?
MR. JACKSON:

Not if a lien has not been estabbished

against those assets prior to the time they are conveyed.
Q

I thought that was fundamental in fraudulent

conveyance.
MR. JACKSON:

If the conveyance is made with the

intent of defrauding creditors, your Honor, I think, indeed,
and the purchaser is not an innocent purchaser and is a party
to that, I agree.
Q

In any event, the Board purported to make the

10-n
successor liable for back pay based on labor policy, right?
MR. JACKSON:
Q

That is correct.

In other words, the predecessor remained in

business as a corporation.
MR. JACKSON:

That is correct.

The predecessor had

other business interests.
Q

And was actively in business. It wasn’t just an

empty shell.
MR. JACKSON:
business.

That is correct.

It had other interests.

It did not go out of

They were not in the

soft drink field.
Q

Right, but it was a corporation in being with

assets.
MR. JACKSON:
Q

That is correct, your Honor.

Did the transfer of assets and the contracts

relating to this transaction include an agreement to indemnify?
MR. JACKSON:

It did not include an agreement

imdemnify as such, your Honor.

It included, Mr. Chief Justice,

the customary warranty against pending litigation and against
all litigation except that specifically disclosed to the
purchaser.

As the record discloses in this case, the pendency

of this litigation had slipped everybody’s mind and was not
specified in the agreement, so its pendency and the liability
attaching constituted, would ordinarily constitute, a breach
ox that warranty, giving rise to —

12
Q

The catch-all indemnity clause would cover it,

then, I take it?
MR. JACKSON:

Well, as between the parties, any

liability that was imposed against All American would be the
subject of indemnification by Golden State, to the extent that
All American was held liable, yes.

I believe that is a fair

statement.
Q

Then this liability would not depend on any fraud

on the part of the seller or any participation in that fraud
on the part of the buyer?
MR. JACKSON:

It was contractual and it stemmed

from the breach of that warranty.
Thus, if All American suffered financial loss of
any kind as a consequence of the existence of litigation
which had been warranted not to exist, I take it that the
Golden State Bottling Company would have to indemnify it
against that loss.
Q

Was this case before the Board pre-Burns?
MR. JACKSON:

Q

It was, your Honor.

And in the Court of Appeals, post-Burns?
MR. JACKSON:

It was post-Burns in the Court of

Appeals after the briefs were filed, I believe.
No, no, the Burns ca.se was, I believe, dealt with
in the briefs and it was the subject of a colloquy with the
court.

13
Q

Do you think Burns resulted in some new rules of

the roau with respect to successorships and the obligation of
a successor to hire a predecessor’s employees?
MR. JACKSON:

I did not, myself, read Burns as

having a bearing on the successor's obligation to hire a
predecessor’s employees, your Honor, but I believe that point
was not —
Q

Do you think under pre-Burns law that you would

have had to hire your predecessor's employees, unless you
could fire them for cause under the collective bargaining
contract?
MR. JACKSON:

Well, I think under the present state

of the law, and I don't read Burns as changing that, that the
successor is under no obligation., other things being equal,
to hire any of his predecessor's employees, that they are, if
I may cite a case —
Q

Yes, well, I understand that.

Was that true pre-

Burns?
MR. JACKSON:

I believe so.

I believe so, and

there is the Tri-State Maintenance case, which rejected a
counter suggestion by the Board and the Board has since taken
that view that there is no obligation on the successor, other
things being equal, to hire any of the employees of the
predecessor.

I believe Mr. Come will concur with that, but

I’d be happy to cite it.

14
Q

Well, If this man had been reinstated before the

transfer —
MR. JACKSON:
Q

Would you have had to keep him on?
MR. JACKSON:

Q

Yes.

No, I believe not.

But the argument Is that because he wasn’t —
MR. JACKSON:

Because he had not been -- because

the unfair practice remained unremedied in this respect and
because the successor is the only party capable of fulfilling
the remedy in this aspect, then it must be against this
party that this aspect of the remedy is invoked.

The Board

does not consider — and this, of course, goes only to the
reinstatement aspect of it.

This argument, of course, does

not pertain to the financial aspect of it, the back pay
aspect of it, at least certainly not as to that portion of
it that accrued up to the time of sale.
There is, again, a question as to whether the
successor should be liable for all of the back pay liability
even before the time of sale.

This is another way of looking

at it.
Have I answered your Honor's question?
Q

Yes, but as I understand the Board's position in

Burns, the Board was arguing that the successor assumed the
collective bargaining contract.
MR. JACKSON:

This, again, has to do with the

15
obligation to bargain and I think that the two can’t be —
Q

No, it has to do with the obligations under the

collective bargaining contract, one of Ttfhich is, you don't
fire without cause.
MR. JACKSON:
Q

We 11, this is true.

In Bums —

A rather substantial position.
MR. JACKSON:

Yes, indeed, but that, again, would

be a matter of contract, your Honor, which does not bear upon
the present case.
Now, Burns

was considered as having some bearing

on this case since it threw light upon the significance of
the Wiley against Livingston decision on which the Board in
turn based its change of course in Perma Vinyl and Burns was
read by Judge Kilkenny, who dissented in the Court of
Appeals, as narrowing the scope of Wiley in its application
of this type of case, in fact, excluding its application to
cases involving liability for unfair practices as distinct
from the succession to the obligation to bargain or the
obligations of a collective bargaining agreement that resulted
from a bargaining arrangement of the predecessor.
To return to the point I was making, the argument
of Justice Jackson, or the language of Justice Jackson, the
touchstone, I think, is found, as I say, Professor Goldberg
suggests that there is an open door which leaves the way open
for other situations, including the one before us, that of an

16
innocent successor but we suggest that is foreclosed by the
language of the succeeding paragraph, in which he points out
the common aspect of both of these examples he has given
because in both of these cases, the reference is not merely
to succession, but to a relation between the Defendant and
the successor which might, of itself, establish liability
within the terms of Rule 65.
We suggest, we urge to the Court that that says,
as plainly as anything could, that an innocent successor,
against

whom there is no independent basis for assessing
who
liability,/is guilty of no wrong, who is not in league with

the predecessor or assisting him to evade the order or
conspiring with him in a collusive manner to carry out this
type of conduct, the term "successor and assigned" cannot
reach out and bind such a person because to do so would be
offensive to due process and to exceed the scope of that
section.
We urge, therefore, that these limitations are
limitations of substance and cannot be swept aside or
cannot be ignored in view of the other limited considerations
which the

Board has advanced and we suggest that to do so

amounts, really, to an exaltation not merely of form but of
doctrine at the sacrifice of fundamental

lav; and of

substantive right.
If I may briefly address myself to one or two of

17

the practical or what we called in our

brief, the policy

considerations announced by the Board, I would like to point
out, if I may, that the enforcement of the reinstatement
remedy, whether it is against the original employer — this i
a well-settled remedy and

one with which we have no quarrel,

but in any event, and, particularly, against a successor, who
as we see, has, other things being equal, no

obligation to

hire any of his predecessor’s employees, it does work a
hardship on the innocent employee who has to be displaced to
make way for the rehired discriminatee.
The argument is frequently seen only from the
standpoint of the discriminates, who is out of a job, who
wants to be reinstated and who is now remedyless because the
business has changed hands.

It must be remembered that, in

order to accommodate him in this respect, somebody else is
going to have to be laid off.
Also, the argument that a successor can hire him,
it will work no hardship and then, if he proves to be an
unsatisfactory employee, may fire him for cause:

In such

circumstances, where the Board tends to try, as it has
indicated in this case and it has frequently attempted to
establish as Board policy, a presumption that the successor
is going to continue the unfair practices of the predecessor
and, given the burden which the employer has under this
Court's Great Dane case to , in effect, establish that the

18
discriminatory reason was not the reason for the discharge, I
think that this is not a realistic argument because, with a
track record such as this, which is going to be raised
against him, a successor is going to have a very difficult
time discharging for cause and making it stand up against
an 883 charge, as a purely practical matter.

This is the

way it works.
Also,

by insisting on this type of remedial

action, I should like to suggest again that a practical
result, if this were to become settled policy, that successors
would, in examining this, to the extent that they were aware
of it, would be more inclined, other things being equal, to
hire none of the predecessor's employees and, instead of
promoting stability, it is likely to promote just the
opposite result, in order to avoid being classified as a
successor, in order to avoid being projected into this
uncertain and potentially expensive situation.
I think, unless there are further questions, I
would conclude with that to open and, if the Court please,
reserve the balance of my time for reply.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Jackson.

Mr. Come.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF
NORTON J. COME, ESQ.
MR. COME:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

19
the Court:
The principal question here is whether the Board
may properly require one who acquires, through a bona fide
sale, a business and continues

it in substantially unchanged

form., using the same work force, to reinstate with back pay
an employee whom

the predecessor employer had discharged in

violation of the Act where, at the time of the sale, the
successor, the employer, has knowledge of the unfair labor
practice and of the predecessor’s failure to remedy it.
Q

Of course, that ’’where1' in that concluding clause

of yours, is one that is very much in dispute.

In spite the

findings below, they were told they were clearly erroneous and
wholly without support in the record.
MR. COME:
Q

That is an issue that is up.

So the question you stated assumes the answer to

another issue.
MR. COME:
those issues are here

Well, I would — I agree that both of
and I’ll try to answer them.

It is undisputed that

All American acquired,

through a bona fide sale, the plant, the machinery, the
accounts receivables, the trade name and other assets of the
Golden State Bottling operation, that it retained virtually
all of Golden State's employees, including the twelve
distributors and all of Golden States supervisory and
managerial employees, including the general manager, Eugene

20
Schillings who is the one who discharged the employee in
question when he' was general manager of the Golden State.
And it is further undisputed that All American
continued to manufacture the same products in the same
location in the same plant and distribute them to the same
customers.

I think we are all agreed on that.
Thus, All American would be a successor-employer

for purposes of the Act, not only under the test of the
majority of the Court in Burns but also under the more
stringent test of the dissenting justices in Burns, which
requires that the new employer not only take over the same
employee complement, but he also succeeds to some of the
tangible or intangible assets of the predecessor company, and.
we’ve got that here.
Now, Petitioners deny that All American had
knowledge at the time of the sale of Golden State’s
unremedied, unfair labor practices.

The Board found to the

contrary and the Court of Appeals sustained

that finding

and, normally, under Universal Camera, that issue would not
be open.

However, it v/as raised as a question in the

petition and the grant of certiorari does not exclude it, so
therefore, that issue is up here.
Hex'!, with respect to that, we submit that there is
adequate evidentiary support for the Board's finding that
All American had knowledge.

As I indicated before, All

21
American retained a general manager of the bottling operation,
Eugene Schilling, who had committed the unfair labor practice
in question.

Schilling participated in one of the saleat
negotiating sessions with Ail American/which, among other
things, his retention as general manager was discussed.
Shortly thereafter but still before the sale was completed,
he met in the plant with a representative of All American
and discussed general operations and, "Future plans."
He also signed the sales agreement of January 31,
1968 which agreement specifically provided for his retention
as general manager.

In these circumstances, we submit that

the Board could reasonably infer, as it did, that Schilling
had conveyed his knowledge of the pending unfair labor practice
proceedings to All American, either before the consumation of
the sale or, at the very least, Schilling’s knowledge thereof
could properly be imputed to All American.
Q

Now, how is that?

How can you impute his knowledge,

if he had knowledge, as an employee of Golden State, was it
not?

And the very mere fact that Schilling was later hired by

All American means that Schilling's knowledge means that —
prior knowledge meant that Golden State had prior knowledge?
Isn't that a very odd application of agency law?
MR. COME:

We submit that it is not.

Here you had

a man who was intimately involved in the unfair labor
practice that was not only — he didn't just come on board

22
after the sale was consummated, he was in negotiations with
All American and its officials.
Q

Ye3, and you would tell us that the fact he was

in negotiations would allow a permissable inference on the
part of the board that he imparted this information which, to
me, is quite a big step.

But then, you said, that his

knowledge as an employee of Golden State could be imputed to
All American and that, to me — that's the reason I asked
the question — I found it rather an impossible step as a
matter of agency law.
MR. COME:

Well, I think as of the time that he

became an employee of All American, it could be imputed to
All American and that took —
Q

Well, what authority do you have for that,

Mr. Jackson?
Stewart.

Do you have cases?

I agree with Justice

I've never seen that In your cited cases.
MR. COME:

Well, we have some cases that we have

cited in our brief, but I don't think that I have to rest on
that position because I think that it is reasonable to infer
\

knowledge from the circumstances.
Q

Knowledge on the part of All American?
-MR. COME:

Yes, in view of Schilling's contact

wjjth All American officials prior to the consummation of
r/

the sale.
Q

Well, the Court of Appeals agreed with you, didn't

23
it?
MR. COME:
should like to

It did, your Honor.

Furthermore, I

point out that although Golden State

President Crofoot and Schilling testified that they did not
tell All American prior to the consummation of the sale, the
trial examiner discredited these denials and, I submit, that
there was ample basis for his

action in doing so in view of

the fact that —
Q

Well, you have the burden of proof.
Excuse me, I didn't mean to interrupt
MR. COME:

you.

We do have the burden of proof and

this is not one of those cases inhere you have direct
evidence.

I think it is a situation which you have very

often in many cases, particularly the Labor Board cases
where you have to draw inferences from the total circumstances
and one of the circumstances, in addition to the previous
one that I outlined, is the fact that the denials were
discredited by the trial examiner for the reason that he
found that not only had Crofoot and Schilling contradicted
themselves in their testimony before him, but there were a
series of documents that they

had signed in the course of

this litigation which either concealed or failed to disclose
the sale of All American to both the Board and to the Court
of Appeals.
Thus, in November, 1968, more than six months

24
after the sale, in his authority to act for Golden State as
entered. Schilling executed a letter and substitution of
counsel in the court below, asgeneral manager of Golden State
Bottle Company.

On December 11th, 1968 as president of

Golden State, he signed a notice to employees required by the
Board's order and sent the Board a certification to that
effect on the same day.

On behalf of Golden State, he

offered Baker, the wrongfully discharged employee, reinstate­
ment as a driver-salesman, notwithstanding the fact that almost
a year ago previous his authority to act on behalf of
Golden State had ended.
Now, on November 24th, 1969» more than 21 months
after the

sale, Crofoot, as president of Golden State,

verified, under penalty of perjury, the answer to the Board’s
original back pay specification and that answer made no
mention of the sale alleged that Golden State had offered
Baker reinstatement on December 11th, more than ten months
after it had gone out of the bottling business.
On the basis of all of these factors, we submit
that the trial examiner was warranted in discrediting the
denials of Crofoot and Schilling that they did not tell.
Q

Right, and he discredits the denials and that

leaves the state of the evidence in equipoise.

He discredits

the denials because of the inferences that you said he was
permitted to draw and so now it is in equipoise and who had

25
the burden of proof?
MR. COME:

Well, we submit that we sustained the

burden of proof by showing Schilling’s contact with officials
of All American prior to the consummation of the sale which
warranted the inference that he conveyed his knowledge to
them.

The further factor here is the officials of All

American were not called to testify, although, certainly,
Golden State and its attorneys could have done so.
Q

Well, so could you, if you had the burden of

proof.
MR. COME:

Well, we thought that we had sustained

it by the circumstances.
Q

Despite the fact that the only actual evidence in

the record on this issue was that there was no knoxtfledge.
MR. COME:
Q

Well, it is believed that —

I mean, other than the inferences you are

talking about.
MR. COME:
Q

That is correct, your Honor.

The testimonial evidence was, all of it,

uncontradicted, that there was no knowledge.
MR. COME:

That is correct.

Correct?

That testimonial

evidence was discredited and -Q

It was disbelieved, you said.
MR. COME:

It was disbelieved and we felt that

the circumstances were sufficient to carry the burden of

26

proof.
Now, maybe if we were trying the case today, we
might have done differently but this is the state of the
record and it did pass muster in the Court of Appeals.

Of

course, if we lose on that issue, then we don't need to reach
the further question that I now want to get to as to the
propriety of the Board's legal position that a successor
employer with knowledge can be required to remedy the
predecessor's unfair labor practice.
Nov/, Section 10(c) of the Act authorises the Board
to issue remedial oi-ders against any person named in the
complaint who is engaged in any unfair labor practice.
However, from the beginning, Board orders have
covered not only the person found to have committed the unfair
labor practice, but its officers, agents, successors and
assigns and this Court has recognized that those orders could
be applied not only to one who was merely a disguised
continuance of the old employer but also, in appropriate
circumstances — and I’m reading from Regal Knitwear — ’"To
those to whom the business may have been transferred, whether
as a means of evading the judgment or for other reasons."
Nov/, the question whether a successor was in the
meaning of the Board’s order not only an alter ego or an
aider or abettor of the old employer, but also a bona fide
purchaser where it continues the employing entity which was

27

the locus of the unfair labor practices and it acquires
that entity with knowledge that the predecessor has failed
to remedy those unfair labor practices, turns on an
appraisal of the policies of the Act and also of Rule 65(b)
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Now, as to the policies of the Act.

In Burns,

this Court held that the policies of the Act were effectuated
by imposing on a wholly independent new employer the old
employer’s bargaining obligation where he was a successor
employer for purposes of the Act and vie have that here, even
under the dissenters’ more stringent test.
Q

Of course, all the old employees under the

contract would not be employed.
MR. COME:

That is correct, your Honor.

no collective bargaining contract here.
union In the picture.

There is

There wasn’t any

Baker was discharged because he was

spearheading an organizational drive and the union never got
into this plant so we don't have any question of continuity
of a. bargaining relationship or a collective bargaining
agreement.
Q

What Is the argument, Mr. Come, that Burns put

a different light on this case?
What is the argument?
You mean — I’m sure you don’t — but the
dissenting judge below thought that Burns

did make a

28

difference in this case.
MR. COME:

I submit that the dissenting judge

misconceived the effect of Burns.

I think that, if anything,

Burns furnishes support for the Board's position here
because it does recognize that the concept of successor
employer has validity for purposes of the National Labor
Relations Act.
Q

How did Burns recognize that?
MR. COME:

Well, it recognized that insofar as it

held that an independent new employer who merely went as
far as continuing the same bargaining unit in taking over a
majority of the predecessor's work force, had succeeded to
the predecessor's bargaining obligations.
Q

Well, I am not sure that was because he was a

successor.
MR. COME:

Well, I know that the dissenters in

Burns point out that the majority has not used the word
"successor," however, in the latter part of the majority
opinion in Burns when we come to the discussion of the
unilateral action, the word "successor-employer" is used
quite frequently.
Q

Well, my question is whether or not, arguably,

Burns does have a bearing on the case and

the Board should

look at it again in the light of Burns because the Board
acted pre-Burns.

29
MR. COME:
Q

That is correct, but the — but there —

Both you and your opponent rely on Regal Knitwear,

on the Regal case.
MR. COME:
Q

Yes, your Honor.

And if that issue disposed of it in favor of

either one of you, Just the 10(c) argument, why, I suppose
there is no need to go back to the Board, is there?
MR. COME:

No, your Honor, I do not see that

Burns would affect the Board’s application of this case, of
the principles that the Board applied in this case.
The only part of Burns that could be deemed to
ha\re a bearing on this case is that the Board relied

very

heavily on the Wiley against Livingston decision, that is,
the policy reflected in Wiley against Livingston for holding
that the new employer could be bound to the contract.
Q

That is your impression, then?
MR. COME:

That is correct.

But since we don’t

have any effort here to bind the new employer to the
predecessor’s collective bargaining agreement since there was
none, you do not have, in the Board’s policy of requiring
the successor the remedy of the unfair labor practices, any
collision with the freedom of contract policy reflected in
8(d) of the statute.
Q

But if the predecessor here had reinstated this

employee one day before the sale, the successor need not have

30
kept him on?
MR. COME:

He needn't have kept him on if he had

good cause for —
Q

No, no, no, he doesn't need to hire anybody.
MR. COME:

That is correct.

I mean, he needn't

have kept him on but —
Q

At all.
MR. COME: — but he could not have fired him for a

union reason because he would have committed a new unfair
labor problem.
Q

I agree with that, Mr. Come, but all he would have

had to have done was say, "I don't want you."
Q

"I'll fire you."
MR. COME:

That is correct.

However, if you get

somebody fired the day after he is put on —
Q

No, he's just not hired by a successor who just

bought the assets.
MR. COME:
Q

That is correct.

You seem to agree with that.
MR. COME:

Yes, yes, I do.

But the point is that

the successor here took over not only the assets but he took
over the whole work force.
Q

But, nevertheless, if he had been reinstated the

day before, this man would not need to have been kept on by
the successor.

31

MR. COME:

Well, that is correct.

As a matter of fact,

the —
Q

But he wasn’t put back on and you say, therefore

he must be hired.
MR. COME:

That is correct, because there is an

unremedied unfair labor practice here that the successor is
the only person that can truly remedy and as long as he is
continuing the same employee enterprise —
Q

What does that mean, "employee enterprise?"

MR. COME:

Well, the employee enterprise, I think, is

fairly easy to describe here because what he has done is,
he is continuing exactly the same business that Golden State
had, the 3ame plant, the same equipment, the same assets and,
in addition to that, it has taken over the entire work force,
including the managerial force.
Q

Is that a word of art, "employee enterprise?"

MR. COME:
goes

Well, it has been a word of art that, I guess,

beck to that old sixth circuit case of Colton,

NLRB against Colton, but it is synonymous with when you have
a new enployer who has identified himself with a predecessor
to sufficient extent that he considered a successor for
purposes of the Act.
Q

An employing enterprise is what a successor

continues, then?
MR. COME:

Well, and if he continues enough of it to

32
become a successor for purposes of the Act, he has carried
on the employing enterprise.

But I don’t want to get bogged

down in the semantics of it because I think that under any
standard, in this case, at least, if you are ever going to
find a continuation of the enterprise or a successor for
purposes of the Act, you have it here.
Now, in terms of the hardship on the successor, if
you apply the Board’s

principle that he has to have knowledge,

and whether you have it here, of course, is another question,
he — yes, your Honor?
Q

Supposing the man was on a one-year leave-of-

absence and the successor knew

it, and the leave came up one

month after the successor took over and hi3 successor said,
"I Just don’t want you."
MR. COME:
Q

What would happen?

This was a dischargee?

No, he was just on leave.

I’d have a problem with

that one.
MR. COME:

I would, too.

I don't know exactly

what the answer to that one would be.
Q

No, why would he have any problem with that if he

just said, "I don’t want you."

It’s just like he wouldn't

need to hire anybody else, any other prior employee.
MR. COME:

If he — we are assuming a situation

where there has been no discharge at all?
Q

No discharge, no unfair labor practice, he just

33
saysj \vhen the fellow comes back, he says, "You are among
those that I don’t want to hire."
MR. COME:

Well, I think that that would

probably be all right but that is not this case.
Now, with respect to the successor, as I started
to say, if he is required to have knoxvledge of the unfair
labor practice, he can protect himself by either negotiating
an allowance in

the sales price to cover his liability or

an Indemnity agreement as was true here.
It is not only an indemnity that flows from the
sales agreement, but also at the Board hearing, the
president of Golden State also agreed to indemnify All
American for any back pay liability that might be imposed
upon it.
Before sitting down, I want to address myself to yes?
Q

Mr. Come, just one last question, if he need not

take him on at all, why, if he does take him on, must he
take him on with this albatross around his neck?
MR. COME:
/Well, when I say that he need not take him on, I
have been assuming a situation where there is no unremedied
unfair labor practice.

If there is an unremedied unfair

labor practice —
Q

He must take him on.
MR. COME:

Yes, yes.

34
Q

And the legal knitwork actually settled that.
MR. COME:

Well, I ivant to address myself to

legal knitwork —
Q

Unless they could not afford to do so.
HR. COME:

0

That is,

That is correct.
if the Board, as part of the remedy,

orders reinstatement.
MR. COME:

That is correct.

Have I answered your question or have I confused —
Q

Is that position?
MR. COME:

Yes, it is.

I think I have appeared to

give inconsistent answers because at one time I was
assuming we were dealing with an employee who was not the
victim of an unfair labor practice and at other times, I’ve
been switching to the situation that we have here.

But I

do want to say a word about Regal Knitwear.
Regal Knitwear says, and although the court was
not really addressing itself to the problem that we have
here.

In Regal Knitwear the court had a very academic

question to this side, namely, whether the terms "successors
and assigns and Board orders"should just be stricken and the
court, in the course of answering that question, the court
said, well, we'll leave it in there because, In any event,
you can't breathe more life into it than Rule 65(d) of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would permit you to do.

35
How, Rule 65(d) says that an Injunctive order
shall be binding on the parties of the action and persons
acting in concert and participation with them.
Q

Will receive actual —
MR. COME:

Will receive actual notice, yes, your

Honor.
The court, however, goes on to add that Rule
65(d) really reflects the old common law policy that an
injunction can't go beyond binding the parties to the action
and those persons in privity or legally identified with them
and, furthermore, that the reason you have that limitation is
that you don't want an injunction binding someone whose rights
have not been adjudicated by the court.
Now, we believe that the Board, the principle of
the Board as applying here comports with the basic policies
underlying 65(d) in that a successor-employer for purposes of
the Act, the kind of employer that I have been talking about,
at least the one in this case, could be found to be in
privity or

legally identified with the original party to

this action.
Q

Well, your opponent said that under state law,

that is not so, that this successor, if you want to call him
a successor, would have not been liable for any back pay to
this employee.

It just wasn't one of those obligations for

which he would have been liable.

36
MR. COME:
Q

I am not —

And to what law are you referring when you say —
MR. COME:

Q

I am referring to the labor policy.

Well» that’s boot strapping, then, because that is

the issue in the case.

Does the labor law impose an

obligation?
MR. COME:

That is why I felt that it was

necessary to show, and I have done 30 in more detail in our
brief, that simply as a matter of effectuating the policies
of the National Labor Relations Act, it is reasonable and
proper to impose on a successor-employer the obligation to
remedy the predecessor’s unfair labor practices.
Q

You mean to say there is room within the rule to

go back and that Regal allows that much room?
MR. COME:

That is correct and, furthermore, with

respect to that part of Regal that attempts to ensure that
you won't hold somebody whose rights have not been
adjudicated, the Board does not hold a successor until the
successor is given notice of its intention to apply the
order to it and an opportunity, at a hearing, to show that it
is not a successor, that it did not take with knoifledge and
that it would otherwise be inappropriate to apply the order
to it.

That opportunity was fully afforded

All American

here and it took full advantage of the opportunity, so we
believe that if we are right on the policies underlying the

37
national Labor Relations Act, that 65(d) would afford no
obstacle to holding the successor in this case.
Q

The successor doesn’t have the opportunity, though,

to litigate the merits of the Board’s determination that there
•#

was an

unlawful discharge?
t

MR. COME!

That is correct.

He might, however,

have the opportunity to show that he would have no room to
take him back, which might effect whether or not the
reinstatement obligation would apply to him or whether he
would merely be required to put him on a preferential hiring
list in case any vacancies open up.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Come.

Mr. Jackson, you have eight minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF
MORTON B. JACKSON, ESQ.
MR. JACKSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I should like to correct a misstatement of fact,
quite unintentional, I’m sure, on the part of Mr. Come.

It

was another union here.

One of the issues in the original

and fair practice case

was a question of domination of that

union which was resolved —
Q

Was there a collective bargaining agreement?
MR. JACKSON:

agreement.

And there was a collective bargaining

There was no issue as to the obligation of a

successor to abide by It.

The successor organization did.

30
Q

Did you assume it?
MR. JACKSON:

Q

Yes, we did.

Was that one of the —
MR. JACKSON:

It was not one of the specific

obligations assumed, as I recall.
Q

Did you negotiate a new one or did you assume it?
MR. JACKSON:

No, we simply assumed the obligations

under the old one and continued right on the —
Q

Which included the provision that, I suppose, you

won't fire without cause?
MR. JACKSON:

I don't honestly recall, your

Honor, exactly what it did provide in this respect.

It was

not an issue in the case, sir.
Q

Well, let’s assume, then, Mr. Jackson — well, it

may not be an issue in the case before us now, but —
MR. JACKSON:

I mean, it was not an issue below.

I don’t mean to say that it cannot be.
Q

Let's assume that any other employee you had

decided you didn't i^ant to take on, and you had no reason
whatsoever for it, you would have been in trouble with the
union, wouldn't you?
MR. JACKSON:
Q

I believe not.

Why not ?
MR. JACKSON:

Because I believe

that the

assumption of the agreement was not a matter of the sale

39
contract.

It was a voluntary assumption by the successor

after having taken over.
Q

Well, I still think that if you assumed it with

the union and one of its members, you decided not to take on
for no reason, you’d have been in some trouble.
MR. JACKSON:

I think that is undoubtedly true.

After those obligations attached and after we had assumed
them without question, if the —
Q

Well, what about this fellow?
MR. JACKSON:

If he had been a member of the work

force and we did contrary to the provisions of the collective
bargaining agreement which we had assumed, attempted to
discharge him without cause, it would have given rise to a
cause for grievance under the contract without question,yes.
Q

I gather this fellow was a member of the unit?
MR. JACKSON:

Q

that would qualify him with respect to this.
MR. JACKSON:

Q

Yes, your Honor.

What was the union, independent?
MR. JACKSON:

Q

He was, indeed.

It was an independent union, yes.

And the charge was domination?
MR. JACKSON:

Yes, in the original case, which

largely disposed of those domination charges, the original —
Q

Was that the thrust of the original ease?
MR. JACKSON:

That is correct, your Honor.

That

was the thrust of the original case.

The discharge was an

issue in that, but it was not one of the principal issues.
Q

This was not part of the merger or part of the

sale proposition?
MR. JACKSON:
Q

Ho, your Honor.

This was just the way you went about hiring and

arranging your labor affairs?
MR. JACKSON:
Q

Yes, I believe so.

Independently with the union.
MR. JACKSON:

That Is correct.

I vfould like, if I may, in the time remaining, t
address myself to the two questions posed by Mr. Justice
White.
First, the question of the significance of the
Burns case in this case and Judge Kilkenny's reliance on it
We have prefaced this by recalling that the Board's
original position was premised on Regal Knitwear and the
Symns Grocer decision of the Board was premised on Regal
Knitwear and the Birdsall-Stockdale cases that came as a
consequence of it.
The change of position in Perma Vinyl

and the

Board’s rationale did not deal with these cases but went,
instead, to the language of Wiley to support its change of
course.
Burns contained language

which suggested that

Wiley did not support that view in this

language., "We do

not find Wiley controlling in the circumstances here.

Wiley

arose in the context of a section 301 suit to compel
arbitration, not in the context of an unfair practice
proceedings where the board is expressly limited by the
provisions of section A D.

The decision emphasized the

preference of national labor policy for arbitration as a
substitute for a test of strength," and so forth.
But that language in Burns suggested that Wiley
was not authority for imposing successorship liability for
unfair labor practices, but that it was confined to this
question of an assumption of contractual obligations which,
as the Court in Wiley said, were essentially consentual in
origin.
To the other question posed by Mr. Justice White
concerning a common law state law regarding the obligations
of the successor, we have cited two cases in our brief.
have not quoted extensively from them.

We

They are on page 37

of our opening brief, Schwartz against McGraw-Edison and
Kloberdanz against Joy but I'd like, if I may, to quote from
those cases, as we did in our brief before the Court of
Appeals.

In the McGraw case, which was a California case,

there was this language,

and we find that the criteria,

again, are very similar to those outlined by the court in
Regal Knitwear , "As a general rule, where a corporation sells

42
or otherwise transfers all its assets, its transferee is not
liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor and
that liability of a new corporation for the debts of
another corporation does not result from the mere fact the
former is organized to succeed the latter, it is generally
held that if one corporation purchases the assets of another
and pays a fair consideration therefore ,

no liability for

the debts of the selling corporation exists in the absence
of fraud or the agreement to assume their debts.

There are

certain instances, however, in which the purchaser or
transferee may become liable

and they go on to specify

a few of these but there is an express or implied agreement
of assumption, where the transaction amounts to a consoli­
dation or a merger, where the transaction was fraudulent,
\

where some elements of the purchase of good faith were
lacking.
Q

Do you have above sale clauses in your statement?
MR. JACKSON:

Q

And you have to give notice to creditors?
MR. JACKSON:

Q

Yes, we do indeed.

Yes, of above sale, otherwise —

Was there notice to creditors in this case?
MR. JACKSON:

I believe there was.

that law was complied with.

I believe

It is presumed fraudulent,

otherwise.
Q

And this gives creditors the opportunity to make

43
sure that their debts are going to be paid.
MR. JACKSOR:

Exactly, well and to come in to

speak their peice, to assert any liens if they have them,
surely.
Lastly, I would like to — well, for just a
moment, on this criterion for successorship, we indicated
that the identity of the unit before and after the transfer
is, of course, pertinent in determining whether or not a
new expression of employee choice for the bargaining
representative would have. to go through this exercise and
this makes sense.

But in applying this to determine whether

or not a person is a successor, and it is becoming a term
of art, for purposes of liability, I suspect, as a practical
matter, the Board has said to itself, "If there is substantial
identity of unit and of personnel and of work, then it is
highly probable

that, but for this discrimination, the man

would have been hired," and I suggest this is probably the
reason for this criterion.
On the implied or the imputation-of-knowledge
argument, I should like, if I may, to point out to the Court
that one of the principal arguments advanced for this
knowledge requirement is that it affords to the purchaser the
ability to protect himself against this possible liability
by indemnity agreements and that sort of thing.
However, by resorting to this imputation

argument the board, in effect, is taking away the protection
because by having to resort to such a fictional device in
order to result in a finding of knowledge, the Board is, in
effect, ceding the fact that no actual knowledge existed on
the part of this purchaser and, therefore, this opportunity
to protect itself and to investigate the possibility of the
extent to which this might result in liability did not, in
fact, exist and I think this is another aspect of the thing
which argues the frailty of this argument.
I would point out, lastly, that Regal Knitwear
this, "Or for other reasons" language to be found at the
tail end of this one example given by Justice Jackson, does
not open the door to any other things.
Q

That’s an internal quote, anyway.
MR. JACKSON:

Q

Exactly.

From a case in a. somex^hat different area,

apparently.
MR. JACKSON:

In the preceding paragraph he point

out, and this is the limiting language, that both of these
situations are those in which the relationship is one which
might, of itself, establish liability and I think this is
the touchstone.
Thank you very much, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Come.

The case is submitted.

Thank you, Mr. Jackson

case was submitted.)
