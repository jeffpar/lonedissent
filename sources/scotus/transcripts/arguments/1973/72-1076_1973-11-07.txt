MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 72-1076, Huddleston v. Tho United States.
Mr. Saferstein, you may i:,roceed whenever you are

ready.
ORAL ARGUt-lENT OF HARVEY I. SAPERSTEIN, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF WILLIA!·! C. HUDDLESTON
MR. SAPERSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Th1.s case is here on a writ of certiorari to review
the decision of the Ninth Circuit Cour~ of Appeals affirming
the conviction of William Carroll Huddleston for violating
18

u.s.c.

§922(a) (6), which prohibits the making of a false

statement in connection with the acquisi. tion of a firearm from
a licensed firearms dealer.
T}ie basic problem in this case arises from the simple
fact that §922(a) (5) Qrohibits false statements only if they
ar~ riade in connect,;.on with the acquisition of a firearm.
Howevc,r, llt. I•uddle ;ton• s statc,ments were made in connection
with the redemption from pawn of three rifles which he, himself,
had previously pawned at a pawn shop some three or four months
earlier.

That is, the statements were not made in connection

with the purchase or sale of firearms by Mr. Huddleston, but
rather in connection with redeeming property which he, himself,
had brought to the pawn shoi:,.

4

You are attaching a significance, I take it,

Q

then, to use by Congress of the broad term "acquisition"
instead of "purchase or sale"?
!-1R. SAFERSTEIN:

Your Honor, we believe that the

term "acquisition" was a term used by Congress to catch,
basically, sales.
In its ordinary meaning, what does the word

Q

"acquire" convey?
MR. SAFERSTEIN:

Well, we believe that, first of

all, the use in other sections of the laws of broader terminology, such as "deliver,'' Hould indicate that the term "acquisition" has a narrower meaning than simply physical transfer.
Furthermore, we believe that Congress may well have been concerned with trades or barters which were not technically
sales; and t:hat the term "acquisition" must have had a narrower
meaning than simply physical transfer, or they would have
used the broader terminology that is used in other sections,
such a,.-> I simply, "transfer" or "deliver."
Q

Wnat about the clause that actually requires

the pawnbroker to keep records of all "dispositions"?
MR. SAFERSTEIN:
the p~\mbroker.

1

'l'hat is section 9 -- the -- Well,

s required to keep records as promulgated by

the Department of -che Treasury, and the -Q

That record i'lcludes -- it's not restricted

to sales, ls it?

5

!-IR. SAFERSTEiiJ:

Well, there is not

-- the Govern-

ment contends that it is not re5tricted to sales -- that it
includes dispositions of firearms.

We do not concede that it

does include dispositions of firearms by the pawn redemption
method.

The Government seems to be contending -Q

Well, they could have said "sales" --

MR. SAPERSTEIN:

That's true.

They could have said

So they neant more than just "sales" --

"sales" -- such as a swap, o;; a trade, a barter -Q

We would draw it narrowly

The Government, I would imagine, would draw --

7

Q

~/ell, i t could be gifts, couldn't it?

MR. SAFERSTEIN:

I take it that i t could be gifts

by a licensed dealer.
Q

A gift by a pawnbroker?

Q

Or anybody.

Q

But, I mean, pawnbrokers.

Are they noted for

giving?
MR. SAFERSTEIN:

I don't think they're noted for

giving, hut the law covers all gun dealers, and I suppose that
a gun dealer \;_lhO gave away guns, for example, in a promotional
effort -- "Free guns today." -- would be required, for all the
people who came in to get the free gu.,s, to fill out Form
4·473; and that would be included in the law.
Now, on the ot.'1.er side, I 11ould like to point out
what happens to thi5 term if i t is given the broadest possible
meaning, which I take i t the Covernme,1t is contending for.
In other words, the question of w}1ere the line should be drawn
on the term •acquisition. "

Under the Government's definition

of "acquisition" -- which is virtually any transfer

i\: that two things would be ;.ncludcd.

Number one:

I take
if a small

loan company gave a loan on a nonpossessory lien on a rifle,
it's very 'JOssible wllen that customer, who never gave up possession of the gun, repaid the loan, that the Government might
consider that an acquisition, and require the debtor, when he
paid off his loan, to fill out a Fori:1 4473, which is the

8

Treasury form that was used in this case in which the false
statement was made.
In other words, you feel it goes beyond mere

Q

possession -- physical '.>Ossession?
MR. SAPERSTEIN:

Well, I -- No, I feel that the

Government's position, that i t applies to any transfer -Q

Yes --

MR. SAPERSTEIN: -- would lead the Court to that
position.
Well --

Q

MR. SAPERSTEIN:

It is my contention that is to be

narrowly const::ued.
doubt i ' they go th, t. far.

Q

some-:.:hing:

Let me ask you

Is it agrE>e~ that -ch:cs gun, or guns, were not the

proor.rty of Mr. ,!uadlescon, but of his wife?

MR. SAFERSrI:nJ:

As a p1:act·.cal mat:ter why she didn't:

-- Do I personally know, by the fact that: he is lTrf client, or--?

9

On the oasis of the record, ne redeemed them.

As a practical

matter, I think, under California State Law, she had no right
to redeem them.

California State Law, as I read it, allows

only the pawnor to redeem the gu.ns, and says nothing about
anybody else.
Q

Evon though, if she were the owner, and he had

taken them into clle pawnshop, only he could redeem them,
under
M.R.. SAFERSTEIN:

That is the way I read the law,

unless she brought an action against the pawnshop on the basis
that the person who had pawned the gun had stolen it, or had
made an unauthorized patm of that gun.
Q

Well, at some point he can foreclose, can he

not, under California Law?

•m. 31\FERSTEIN:

Yes,

Under California Law, after

six months the oa,vnbrokc.r can foreclose and sell the gun.
Q

I suppo3e you would aqrce that if the pawn-

broke,;:- hcd fo.:oclo..,ed, and the day after the foreclosure was
com">i"te, :...1i . gentleman came 'ln and said he wanted to get
tllat na'"ticular qu 1, because it had pearl handles, or someti1ing, or so~0 characteristic; and he was then informed that
it had )een foreclosed the day before, but he purchased it,
you wouldn't be here, would you?

If he made an outright

purchase after foreclosure?
MR. SAPERSTEIN:

I think that would probably be true.

10
I don't want to avoid your question, but, under the specific
question you ask, which, as the California Law -- there is a
ten-day grace period, under which, when you get a notice, you
can come in and lay claim to the gun.
Q

He can also bid --

Alter my hypot.'ietical -- this is after the ten

days.
MR. SAFERSTEIN:
Q

Right.

I agree with you, I --

Then you wouldn • c be here?

l1R. SAFERSTEIN:

I think that is true.

be a -- that would be a purchase.

That would

The gun would have been

foreclose, the title would have passed to the pawnbroker, even
though, under California Law, he is -- the pawnor is still
entitled the surplus of the funds after the sale.
I would also like to point out another position
which I think that the broad definition of "acquisition"
uhich the Government i~ arguinq [.or would take this Court,
=d that is t·,c bail

1e,n~,

such as person who had a hunting

ri ·1c, and had 1:-ee'l hu: cing, and che huncing season was over,
and took it into a recail gun store, and placed it there and
said, "Would yo\1 please keep 1:his for the nonhunting season;
I don• t like i. t around the house. "
And I tal,e · c that w1der th.., Government• s interpretation of. the 11ord "acquisi'cion," when he came back to pick
up that ri:f.le after it h;.,.d been stored, that that would also
be an acquisition, and a Form 4A73 would be required, and the

ll
person who was picking up the gun would be liable for any false
statements on the Foi-m 4473.
And, as Your Honors are aware, the question which is
at issue here, that is, the scope of the term "acquisition,"
has caused a split in the Circuits on this question.

The Ninth

and Tenth Circuits have agreed with the Government's position
t.liat a oawr, redemption is included; the Fifth Circuit has
adopted the petitioner's contention that a pawn re,1ernption is
not included in the term "acquisition."

And I would briefly

like to give the two prlmary reassons we bel.i.eve that the term
£hould exclude pawn redaimotion .•
First of all, the leqislative history shows that the
term "acquisition'· in !!Q22 (a) (6) was uot ::.ntended to apoly to
repossessions, such as a pawn redemotjon, but was limited to
sales, or other such transfers, which resulted in a putting a
new gun i.nto new hands; that is, a net increase in the t>rivate
ownership of guns.

There were already sufficient laws on the

books, by virtue of illegal posse,;sion laws, which gave Congress control o,~r illegal pos5e&sions.
Q

Don' c you \:h· nk Conqress has a special interest,

indcpende,1t of the total nuHber o"' guns extant. in preventing
guns coming into the , ·o,:,s~.,s•: OI" of convicted felons?
MR. ,AFERSTEirl:

I chi.•k that the Government -- I

think that tt c la•, did .:.nd::.cal:e .:hat they wanted to make sure
that felons d.i.d not acquire new guns -- that felons did not

12

acquire guns they didn't previously have.

That was

The primary purpose of the statute?

Q

MR. SAFERSTEIN:

I think that the thrust of the

various regulatory measures that were put into the 1968 law
were toward that end.

The illegal possession statute, which

was already on the books, and the receipt statutes, were
merely beefed up a little.
United States v. Bass.

Those were before this Court,

The -- and it was for that reason

that the Congress did not require registration of firearms,
nor did it re7uire certain clasaes of persons to register
their ownershin of f~rear.ms, and for that reason Congress did
not r0quire ce~tain classes of persons to register their guns.
Rather, they sj_moly put a lid on new sales by virtue of these
varioilS requlatory measures of licenc;ing Federal firearms
d~alers, and requiring new acouisitions to oe recorded.

Q

!Ir. safer.stein, going back to my question

MR. SAPERSTEIN:
Q

Yes --

Your -- the Government's brief states that the

evidence at trial showed that petitioner, your client, pawned
his wife's Winchester: and then later pawned, at the same
store, two other rifles belonging to his wife.

And your brief

·ays that he .,a med th~ee of his family's rifles.

rm. sAJ?E'<.ST1'DI:
Q

That is correct.

Now, wh).ch i,; co;:-rect?

MR. sAFERST~~IN,

I believe that our interpretation

13

is correct.
Q

And does the family own it?

MR. SAPERSTEIN:

It was -- it was purchased by the
what we contend is prima facie

wife with wha.t we conce-

community oroperty money in California; and, therefore, the
family meaning he and his wife, not their son, as well.
Q

It belongs to both of them.

IIR. SAFERS'.l'EIN:
Q

That would be our contention.

Then I ask again, as a practical matter, why

didn't she red~em them?

Then you wouldn't be here to have a

case, would you?
MR, SAPERSTEIN:
she redeem them?
Q

As a practical matter, why didn't

Again, I hate to go off the record --

According to testimony at the trial, and l"eading

it on page 28, she'd suffered severe heart attacks, and she's
c:till not uery healtl,y, and that was the reason she had
nothi•1g to do

That's what the testimony was.

MR. SAFERSTEIN:

as a point of fact, I'm

not sure whether he ".:estified to it at trial, but she was -a severe heart attack, and could hardly get out of the car.

14
And that was the reason he pawned them in the first place.
Well,

Q

r --

perhaps that's right.

I guess it's

your representation to the trial Judge that that was the
situation
MR. SAPERSTEIN:

Right.

I do think that as a matter

of the natural testimony at trial that it was testified to
that she was still under treatment, and couldn't redeem the
guns, even though -- and, as I say, I don't know, under California Law, her right of redemption, since she was not the
pawnor.

She 'might have had the gun through a procedure by

which -Q

Q

Who was the 'J'ri,11 Tudg'"?

i1CT,1

this '~hol~ --

16

MR. SAFERSTEIN:

Judge Real.

Basically what happened

-- I was the trial attorney -- basically what hapt>ened was the
Justice Det>artment wc>.s trying to create a lack of conflict in
the Circuits by contending that this case ,-,as different than
the Laisure case.

'l'he Trial Judge indicated that -- very

early in the game, in the trial, that we were probably going to
lose, and that the best thing we ought to do is to make sure
we had an appeal ·,:o issue.

And, therefore, as he states on

t>age 29 of the Ap· 1:!ndix, ·1r. Saferstein "you are in good shape
'
right now because
\:he paw,1 ticket is in Mr. Huddleston' s name.

[and]

That puts y:•:i. right smacl: dab in Laisure."
What he ll•'V·t by that was that the Government was

trying to distingu.' 1:h '->aisure by saying that in Laisure it was
the owner who 11 :i.d

l

an agent of the o ,

shap~

h

t,, ,

I don't want to

10• •

s you ar~ · .i.gh+- nO'·, c>nd I wouldn't proceed any further

wit'1 trying to

whose g '·"' +-'1ey were.

So, the testimony

that d.i. • co , r,ut Pas s:lmnly t.'. 1<- Mr. Huddleston pawned the

cruns,

:ir-" '

that r;, ,,
Lal·',
J:r

11c Government only b,·.,ught out the simple question

ludr!leston had bought the guns.

And under California

n a commu.1ity .-,roperty state, t:1e presumption would still

oat they t·1ere co-owned.

So -- and in the Ninth Circuit,

, e same arguments about the distinction between who owned the
gun, and whether this was under Laisure or not under the Laisure

17

case, were discussed.

And the Ninth Circuit accepted the

position that they were the co-owners of the guns.
Q

Mr. Saferstein, assuming that he had sold the

gun to a second-hand dealer, and then re-purchased it, you'd
have no question that he was under the Act?
MR. SAPERSTEIN:
Q

Well, he sold it.

MR. SAFERSTEIN:
Q

l1ell, let me say this, your Honor
He transferred title to --

I agree fully with that statement.

Well, my point

MP,. SAFERSTEIN:

Except for one thing.

There are

certain states where pawnshops are defined as both people who
lend money and people who buy guns and agree to resell them
at a stipulated price.

They try to avoid the pawn laws and

the usury interest rates hy going to a buy-sell.
Q

Well, I've been talking where this was a legi-

tiraate sale
MR. SAFERSTEIH:
Q

If this was a legitimate sale --

And then the only difference, it seems to me,

in yom: argument, is that this was 11ot a sale at any time -1-iR.

SAF£RSTEIN:

Q

That's your oo~ition, isn't it?

MR. SAFERSTEIN:

Correct.

That is our position.

That this is

simply -Q

There nevm:: uas a sale --

t-lR, SAPERSTEIN:

'1'hc.:e never was a sale.

There ne-

18

well, and even furtherr.iore, there neve:r was an "acquisition."
It is our contention that the period during which tl1e gun is
under in pawn, when there is a :rede.motion, is merely an inter1:uption in the continued possession of ownership by the pawnor.
And that the ultimate effect of. all this is simply a return to
the status quo at the end of the pawn period, when he takes
back the gun into his possession.
Q

Doesn't Califon1ia P:roperty Law recognize the pro-

postion that the husband has the absolute right to alienate
'
communicy o:.:operty,
so far as a third party, like a pawnbroker,
is concerned?

He might be resryonsible to the wife in a separate

action, but so far as the third oarty is concerned he may deal
with the husband as the owner of co,'IIIlluni ty prooerty, may he
not?

exactly new guns; I mean it could be used guns, but putting
guns into commerce.

And it seems to me that

pawnbrokers were included in the law for a number of reasons.
'£he testimony of Mr. Bennett before the House showed t:hat

In ocher words, desni te the crucial importance

of this section, Congress ex~mpted the type of repossession
that we have in this case; that is, the return of a gun to the
person who deposited it with chat licensed firearm dealer.
Our second basic argument, in i:he alternative, is
-chat the statutory language is so ambiguous that -- and raises
such serious constitutional questions, that the statute should
'

be narrowly construed in light of the statutory construction

dealing wi tr. a -- anotl.er title of this same 196 8 gm1 law.

I don't think it applies to, for instance, the

simple person who comes and brings his gun in for a day and
says, "Please keep it," and when he goes out has to f i ll out a
Form 4473, and is liable for any false statements , and subject

OR.t"\L ARGUMENT OF DANHY JULIAN BOGGS, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. BOGGS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Thi~ case essentially turns on the construction of
a single, relatively simple, English word:
its root, "acquire."

"acquisition" and

As has already been indicated, the es-

sential dictionary definition of this word would be "to come
into nossession of," 11hen which we perceive no basic ambiguity.
\le. would also note that this word is used in correlation with

the vords "sale or ot.'lcr di3r>Osition."

When the man goes into

-chc nawn shop, or into any 1:ransaction, he 'acquires;" the man
on the other -,ide rf. the counter "sells" or ''disposes."
Now,. the word "dispose" in "disposition" itself
appears throug·1out the statute as part of the basic scheme of
control over t'1e use of firearms, which is, i•·1 fact, the basic
statutory purpw:ie.
Q

be l ow, the dissenter stated he didn't "acquire," he "reacquired . "
I find that to be a distinction without a difference.

If a

statute forbids "sale," I hardly think that I would get o ut of
i t by saying t..hat I did not "sell," I "resold.·•

One could think

of a series of verbs of t'1at sori:, and I -Q

Her,, about "nossess"?

MR. BOGGS:

If I am forbidden to "possess" son.ething,

and I come in and say, "Well, your Honor, I didn ' t really possess it, I just repossessed it."

If I'm forbidden to possess

heroin, for example, and I'm up on charges before -- and say,
"I didn't possess it; I had i::. hefore, and I now repossess it."
Even if we assu.-~ed an intervening statute, or something of that
sort, I cannot see that that argument would progress vei.-y far.

Und.:ir that Act,

pawnbrokers ,,,er.e tice11sed in the i;ai,;e w,J.y as any other person

34
who was selling at wholesale or retail .

Now, we had sOllle dis-

cussion with regard to the qv.estion of the Bulova watch swap,
but it would ce;:-tainly ap?ear to me that in any indication of
what was a sale, if: one tried to ec;cape by saying, "I sold the

gun, not for monoy but for a Bulova watch," he would cei.-tainly
not be able to

<:r'.lt

out from under that.

So that the Congres-

sional action in adding the wording that pawn.brokers, defined
a.,; people

1>10

merely take -pledge3 of guns, are under tb.e Act:

and in the :i.·eport accompany i t so.,,cifically stating that

p;.twnbrokers whsi

~'!!.

in firear.ms, rather than those who sell

th,,m, are u·,der i:he Act, would certainly be a strong indica-

tion tha~ sumet'iing in additlon to mere sales would have been
included.
