PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear

arguments first this morning in No. 72-6609, Jimenez
against Weinberger.
Mrs. Stevens, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JANE G. STEVENS
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. STEVENS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The discrimination challenged by the Plaintiffs
in this case is the discrimination between legitimate
children born after their father had become eligible for
Social Security benefits and illigitimate children born
after their father had become eligible for Social Security
belief its.
If Eugenio and Alicia Jimenez, the Plaintiffs
herein, were legitimate children, they would noitf be
receiving Social Security benefits, but because they are
illigitimate, they are absolutely barred from receiving
benefits, even though they have lived with their father all
their lives and have been supported by him all their lives
in that he has been their sole

caretaker since their mother

left the home.
This discrimination between legitimate and

Illegitimate children is arbitrary and irrational.

It is a

violation of the Equal Protection guarantees as embodied in
the Dure Process clause of the Fifth Amendment.
The Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare
defends the discrimination on two grounds, that it is
reasonable because illegitimate children are less likely to
have received support from their fathers than legitimate
children and that it serves the valid governmental purpose of
preventing fraud.
In fact, It is not rationally related to the
purpose of the Social Security Act and It is not a rational
means of preventing fraud.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Stevens, if all children,

legitimate as well as illegitimate, born after the date of
onset of disability were excluded from coverage, would you
be here?
MRS. STEVENS:
slightly different posture.

I would be here but in
I think that exclusion also

would be irrational in light of the purpose of the Act.
In fact, before I960, all children had to have
been born and have met these requirements before the father
became disabled or aged, but Congress made a change In i960
to allow children, legitimate children, to prove their
dependency and their other eligibility requirements at the
time that application v/as filed on their behalf and now, as

5
a result of that change, only illegitimate children are
excluded,
QUESTION:

Well, Is your posture then, one that

the difficulty with the statute is that it is overly
inclusive?
MRS. STEVENS:

'V/ell, I think, your Honor, that

the exclusion here — if I may put it that way — Is over
inclusive.

The Government says that they have excluded

afterborn, Illegitimate children in order to prevent
fraudulent claims and they have excluded with the possibly
fraudulent claims a large group of, in fact, valid
claimants.
QUESTION: Doesn’t that often happen in line
drawing?
MRS. STEVENS:

I believe it does happen, but I

think that when there are less drastic means for sorting out
the fraudulent from the valid claims, that those less
drastic means have to be employed.

The hearing that would

be required would be relatively simple.

The Social Security

Administration is clearly able to distinguish between
fraudulent and nonfraudulent claims and the reason it is
clear, your Honor, is that there are 2k states that allow
illigitimate children to inherit from their fathers by the
laws of intestate succession and in those states, children
defined the way these children are defined, that is.

6
children born and otherwise eligible after their fathers
become eligible for benefits, are allowed to present their
claims and the Secretary, it seems, in those states is
perfectly capable of sorting the fraudulent from the nonfraudulent claims.
Therefore, it is our position that this blanket
exclusion cannot be necessary to sort out the fraudulent
claims.
QUESTION:

When you speak of "fraudulent claims,"

are you referring to those that would involve the question
of paternity?
MRS. STEVENS:

That would be, I believe, your

Honor, the major problem of proof, because —
QUESTION:

That would be the "major," you say?

MRS. STEVENS:

There is also the issue or the

possibility of the question of whether or not the child had
been supported but that is something that children who are
previously born have to prove, too, so the only possible
fraud that the Government could be depending on would be
children who were not, in fact, the children of the fathers
and, as this Court has pointed out, although it is difficult
to prove paternity,paternity proof cannot be an excuse for a
blanket exclusion of an entire class.
QUESTION:

In those states that allow inheritance

by illegitimate children, such illegitimate children are not

7
ineligible under the federal statute, are they?
MRS. STEVENS:

That is correct, your Honor.

They

are not ineligible.
QUESTION:

That is, if they have been

recognized by the state courts.
MRS. STEVENS:

Is that it?

Or if —

If they merely live in a state In

which they would be allowed to inherit by the laws of
intestate succession, they are eligible to receive these
benefits.
QUESTION:

Regardless of whether or not they

have been found to be illegitimate children by the state
courts?
MRS. STEVENS:

I Imagine that in the probate

proceedings —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MRS. STEVENS:

— that might be an issue, but

they are eligible regardless of what has happened prior to
the death of the father.
QUESTION:

I think —

But in those states, in other words,

the federal administrator and the administrative process
has the aid of the fact-finding of the state courts.

Is

that right?
MRS. STEVENS:

Not necessarily, your Honor, and

I think this points up a very important factor of this law.
The lav; depends on the lav; of Intestate succession for

8
giving benefits to children whose parents are still alive
and so the process by which the state will make that decision
has not yet been effected.

In fact, the law, this federal

law, this federal program, is depending on the state law of
intestate succession for the disposition of benefits while
the father is still alive

30

that that process has not yet

come into play and I think that if the federal statute were
to depend on a state

law for definition of familial

obligations, it would, be more reasonable for the federal
statute to depend on laws that control support while the
father was still living and this Court said only last year
that once a legitimate child has been given a right to
support by the father, an illegitimate child must be given
that right also.
And I think that that decision in Gomez v. Perez
should be controlling in this situation.

It Is not only —

in fact, the Plaintiffs in this case will be eligible to
receive benefits under this section after their father dies
because his acknowledgment of the children, while it carae
after the onset of disability and therefore does not qualify
the children now, will have come before his death and so it
will qualify him after he dies, in an irrational and
arbitrary manner,
QUESTION:

MRS. STEVENS:

No, this Is the Social Security

these Illegitimate children.
QUESTION:

MRS, STEVENS:

Directly.

because he is their guardian.

Probably in his name,

It would go directly to him.

The issue that the Government depends on largely
is that illegitimate children are less likely to have been
receiving support than legitimate children .and that, there­
fore, this is a rational distinction, is in fact, irrelevant
In this case because the section at Issue makes dependency
or the right to support a requirement of eligibility for all
children.
The general likelihood of illegitimate children
to support is completely Irrelevant because no one legitimate
or illegitimate can receive benefits who doesn’t have the
experience of or the right to support.
Now, the right to support is adequate because
legitimate children never have to prove dependency.
Illegitimate children under Section 216(h)(3)

10

have to have been acknowledged or declared by a court to be
eligible to be their father’s children or beneficiaries of a
court support order and any of these children have a right to
support.
Those who have not been acknowledged have to have
had experience of support so the general likelihood of
illegitimate children to receive support cannot be relevant.
Even if this Court would remove this bar excluding afterborn
illegitimate children, no child would become eligible who
did not have the right to or the experience of support.
Therefore, that argument on the part of the
Government is completely irrelevant.
QUESTION:

In your view, is it irrational to have

a presumption that legitimate children are likely to be
receiving support — more likely to be receiving support
than illegitimate children?
MRS. STEVENS:

I am not contesting that pre­

sumption, but the presumption that includes them and excludes
illegitimate children on the same basis, a presumption that
operates generally for the entire class and doesn’t allow
any of them to offer proof of their particular situation., I
believe, has an irrational effect.
QUESTION:

In other words, if the legitimate

children were not required to prove a dependency status,
illegitimate children were, you would apparently have no

but

11

trouble with that.
MRS. STEVENS:

Well, your Honor, I believe that,

In fact, illegitimacy is a suspect classification and would
request that this Court recognize illegitimacy as a suspect
classification and if it were so recognized, then a require­
ment that illegitimate children prove dependency whexi legiti­
mate children did not have to, I think, would be a dis­
crimination because in that case, the state would have to
prove a stricter — would have to defend the requirement
against a stricter constitutional standard.
The argument that the Government is left with,
because of the irrelevancy of the support, is the prevention
of fraud argument and I think that in recent cases this
Court has indicated that an exclusion of an entire group of
recipients solely for the purpose of preventing fraud and
promoting

administrative efficiency is not permissable.
This is to create an irrebuttable presumption

essentially identical to that created — to that invalidated
by this Court in the United States Department of Agriculture
versus Murry, just last year.

In Murry, a section of the

Pood Stamp Act declared ineligible any household containing a
person over 18 years of age who had been claimed as a
dependent for federal tax purposes by someone net eligible
for foods stamps and this Court found that that section was
not a rational measure and that it rested on an irrebuttable

12

presumption often contrary to fact and therefore, violated due
process requirements and I think that the irrebuttable pre­
sumption which is created in this case, which excludes the
Plaintiffs and others like them, is similarly often contrary
to fact and in violation of due process because these children
are not allowed to offer the proof that they meet the
requirements of Section 2.16(h)(3).
If they were legitimate or if they had been born
before their fathers became eligible for benefits, they would
be allowed to offer their proof and should it be satisfactory
to the Secretary, they would be found eligible for benefits.
Now, they are totally and absolutely barred from
offering that proof.
The discrimination against illegitimate children
here challenged violates the constitutional guarantee of
Equal Protection judged by the traditional standards because
it is not rationally related to the purpose of the Act.

The

purpose of the Act is not simply to replace support lost at
the moment the wage earner ceases being able to work.

If that

were true, legitimate afterborn children would still be
barred and they are not.
I think that the standard must fall for still
another reason and that is that it is a discrimination
based on the status of Illegitimacy and illegitimacy is
properly a suspect class.

13
Several weeks ago, this Court, in Johnson versus
Robison indicated the traditional indicia of suspectness and
said that the CO class at issue in that case was — did not
possess an immutable characteristic determined solely by
accident of birth but illegitimate children possess exactly
that, an immutable chai’acterlstic determined solely by the
accident of birth.
QUESTION:

Of course, in many states, children

who are born illegitimate can be legitimated through —
MRS. STEVENS:

That is true, your Honor, but not

at their own desire or control.

They can be legitimated but

their parents, who put them in the illegitimate status to
begin with, must make the decision to do that.
QUESTION:

But unlike race or sex or maybe other

things, being born abroad, for example, it is not immutable,
to that extent, at least.
MRS. STEVENS:

It is not as immutable, but to the
• '

's

degree — in terms of the control of the persons so
classified, it is immutable.

There is no way an illegitimate

child can have the status changed and —

Is

that right?
MRS. STEVENS:
QUESTION:

The child, is that it?

MRS. STEVENS:
QUESTION:

The child would receive benefits.

That’s right.

Well, now, if this child were

legitimated, would it now receive benefits?
MRS. STEVENS:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Oh, it would?

MRS. STEVENS:

Yes.

But there is no way that the

child can be legitimated now because the mother of the child
left the father years ago.

The only way that he could

legitimate the child would be to marry the child's mother.
QUESTION:

But suppose he adopted the child?

MRS. STEVENS:

It is not certain that he could

adopt the child, your Honor, but he certainly, he could
attempt to adopt the child.
QUESTION:

Well, if he succeeded, would the

child then be eligible?
MRS. STEVENS:

I think that the child would be

eligible, if he did that.

However, it isn’t clear that he

could adopt them and the Secretary has suggested that the
purpose of this entire section is to discourage the manipu­
lation of events solely in order to obtain benefits and if
he were to adopt this child for no

other reason than to

obtain benefits, surely this would be the kind of manipulation
of events that the Secretary says this section is meant to
prevent.
QUESTION:

Well, that is to say that nothing can

be done to make this child eligible for benefits, if
illegitimate at the time of the — or born after the injury
that the father suffers.
MRS. STEVENS:
QUESTION:

If he were not to adopt them.

Yes.

MRS. STEVENS:

Then there would be no other way

except through a move to remove this bar, yes, that is true,
your Honor.

The other —

16
QUESTION:

Your view of what the Secretary would

do in case of an adoption — that is, you suggest he would
regard that as a manipulation —- his view Is certainly not
an immutable view of the matter, is it?
MRS. STEVENS:
QUESTION :

His, the Secretary’s?

Yes.

MRS. STEVENS:

I hope not, your Honor.

However, in Stanley versus Illinois, I believe
that this Court stated that to force a father to adopt his
natural child in order to go around a burden that was placed
on him only as the father of an illegitimate child would be
an unjust and arbitrary burden to place on him when a father
of a legitimate child, in a similar situation, would not have
this burden.
It is also true, your Honor, that the father of
the children In this case is an elderly, disabled, impecunious
gentleman and it is not certain that the courts of Illinois
would allow him to adopt a child for those reasons.
The other indicia of suspectness that the Court
pointed to was that the saddling of a class with disabilities
in the history of purposeful unequal treatment and a position
of political powerlessness so as to command extraordinary
protection from the majoritarian political process and it Is
surely clear that illegitimate children are in a situation of
political powerlessness; although they are frequently

17
legislated against as a group, they have no legislative
power as a group.

They are a discreet and inferior minority

who have no political power to defend themselves against
this kind of arbitrary —
QUESTION:

Would you say legitimate children had

political power?
MRS. STEVENS:

I think they have more political

pox^er, your Honor, because they are not discriminated against
in this way.

There are situations in which legitimate

children are discriminated against as children as opposed to
adults but there are more valid and reasonable distinctions
between children and adults than between children who differ
only because of the marital status of their parents.
The children in this situation — the illigitimate children — are classified solely by an accident of
their birth and they cannot change it.
over it.

They have no control

They have suffered as a result of this classifica­

tion a stigma from which they will never recover and stigma
is, I believe, a characteristic which this Court has sought
to counteract by granting stricter judicial scrutiny to those
classes of people who have suffered from that kind of
stigma, particularly in a situation where the law in
question will perpetuate the stigma and perpetuate the
historical suffering of the class, as this will do, legiti­
mate siblings of these children will be able to receive

18
benefits.

In fact, they have legitimate siblings who are

receiving benefits and to distinguish between the legitimate
and illegitimate siblings is only to perpetrate the stigma
that these children must suffer because of their parents'
marital

status.
The statutory section challenged here should

therefore be subject to strict scrutiny and be upheld only
if it is crucial to a compelling state interest, which it
clearly is not.

The Government has been able to show,

indeed, no rational purpose for this classification, much
less a compelling state purpose.
The Plaintiffs in this case are identically
situated to children who would be able to receive benefits
except for the fact that their father and mother never
married and this fault, if you will, of their parents should
not be used to deprive them of rights which they would
otherwise have.
I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for
rebuttal, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mrs. Steven

Mr. Boggs.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANNY JULIAN BOGGS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BOGGS:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

19
X would like, if I might, to begin by tracing
more exactly what the statutory scheme at issue here is.

I

believe it has become somewhat more confused during the
opposing argument and I believe that it is crucial to,
perhaps the key point of this agreement between the txvo sides
here which on the purpose of the Social Security Act as a
whole.
We contend that while any look at the Social
Security Act can tell you that it does not derive with a
Aristotelian logic from some first principle, the basic
purpose is to replace support which was lost due to the act
of disability retirement or death.
Counsel opposite contend to the contrary, that
its basic purpose is to pay people who have a right to
support or who have actual support.
So let us look now at what the statutory scheme
actually says.

It begins that in order to gain benefits,

one must be a child and child is then defined as essentially
persons who may inherit under state intestacy laws as a
child, which brings in, essentially, all legitimate
children and it brings in those illegitimate children who
meet the various state law
them to inherit.

qualifications which entitle

In three or four states, this is any

illegitimate child from the moment of birth.

In most states,

as I believe your Honor asked, it requires some statutory

20

action,
It may be merely a written acknowledgement; it
may be merely open and notorious holding out.
require a certain court action.

It may

But in any event, the child

has to meet one of these qualifications.
Now, any of these qualifications would give it
the right to inherit which, as we have indicated in our brief,
was one of the original indications of the Social Security
Act.

Payments were made not to persons but to an estate and

specifically this estate payment was phased out in favor of
continuing payments, basically to those people who could
inherit.
Then, in 1965, Congress said, well, there are
other people who we feel should be able to get benefits and
despite an advisory council report which they rely on which
did use the phrase, "right to support" or "experience of
support," they wrote in specific statutory criterion and
they said, "If, before the parent became entitled," that is,
before he became disabled, before he died, or before he
became

actually 64 — I think, because they wanted to give

you a one-year period before that 65 — but if, before that,
one of these things has happened, then you can get benefits.
If the father acknowledged you in writing, no
judicial scrutiny required, a simple written acknowledgement;
if there is a paternity order; if there was a support order

21
or if he was living with you or contributing to your support.
Nov;, in any of these cases, it could be a reasonable assumption or a preponderant assumption that you were
getting support at that time and that, therefore, you lost
support when that event took place.

But I would point out

that contrary to the argument made by counsel opposite, in
the case of the acknowledgement or in the case of the simply
living with, there is no necessary experience of support.
There is no necessary right to support.

There is, rather,

the congressional judgment that this class of people probably
lost support.
We further point out that this kind of judgment
runs throughout the law.

For example, legitimate children

who would otherwise qualify, do not qualify if they were
adopted by someone else, because in such a case, I think
Congress reasonably judged that they probably did not lose
support.
As another example, children who become married,
even though they may be under 18, they may still have a right
to support, they may still have an experience of support,
but in judging that group, Congress decided that those
people probably did not lose support and therefore, that
class could be excluded.
So that what we have here is a general
Congressional scheme which can be traced, I think, through

22
categories of the Social Security Law far outside children.
I think one can examine almost any provision and find this
kind of judgment which says, the question we look at is who
is likely to have lost support and will —
QUESTION:

Up to this point, no illegitimate

children are excluded.

Isn't that right?

MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:
MR. BOGGS:

Well —
Did Congress do it?
I would say, your Honor, that the —■

in fact, the line I was beginning was that the real item
which needs to be explained is not why we deny payments to
these illegitimates, because, by definition, since they were
born after the man became disabled, they could not have lost
support due to his disability.
The question rather is, why do we allow payment
to those persons who can inherit, which include both

23
legitimates and illegitimates and as

I have suggested,

persons who can. inherit under state law essentially also
suffer a loss that the Social Security Act, we believe, may
provide compensation for because since the father could not
continue earning and provide an estate, since the Social
Security Act no longer adds to that estate as it did up
until 1939, those persons who can inherit, whether they are
legitimate or illegitimate, those persons who can inherit,
do suffer this loss for which we believe there can be
compensation so that, essentially, we base the reasonableness
of this on two points.
The first is that it is a reasonable Judgment

between persons who can inherit and persons who cannot
inherit, a distinction which this Court, in Labine versus
Vincent, has upheld in allowing that distinction to be based
in part upon the question of legitimacy of birth.

Protection problem with that, that that arises in any type
of line-drawing proposition.
For example, if I could give you two other
examples from the law, one we allude to in our brief, which
is that a woman who is married to a man who dies within nine
months of their marriage cannot get widow's benefits.
Now, it is true that at eight months and 30
days, I don't know that her dependency is any less than at
nine months and one day, but we believe that Congress had a
reasonable purpose in that case to prevent people from
getting benefits by marrying people essentially on their

27
deathbed and you have to draw a line.
Another example which is even closer to this is
as follows:

a husband or a parent, in order to receive

benefits on the account of his wife or his child, must have
been receiving one-half of his support at the time of
entitlement, just like in our case, at the time of disability,
so, for example, a man who is not dependent on his wife when
she becomes disabled, but does become dependent on her later,
he loses.

He cannot receive Social Security benefits and

the reason is that at the time of her entitlement, he lost
no support.

If he had been dependent on her the day before

she became disabled or became age 65, he would receive
benefits.
Now, granted, in any given case, the result may
appear harsh.

As a matter of fact, any time a person misses

out under just one part of a rule, he can easily say, as
counsel does here, well, we could qualify if you would take
out this one rule.

But as we, I believe, have shown, this

distinction is one that is rationally related to the purposes
of the Social Security Act which is to replace su.ppoz>t which
was lost at the time of the person’s ceased earning.

That is,

death, disability, or age 65.
We would also like to take issue with the
contention that the primary purpose of this is merely
administrative efficiency, merely to prevent fraud.

They

28
have argued this at quite considerable length and, while
certainly, we believe that it has an additional aspect which
is that an action such as an acknowledgment may more likely
be considered reliable or more likely be considered valid if
it occurs at a time when that action in itself is not the
thing which creates an entitlement to benefit and, in
addition, when that action carries with it no other
accompanying burdens or reasons, for example, in the
adoption instance which was alluded to somewhat, the
Secretary would have no objection, in fact, to an adoption
where court scrutiny would be required that it would be in
the child's best interest, an adoption would also place the
parent under a number of other burdens and obligations and
give the child other rights, other than simply qualifying
him for Social Security benefits so that in that case, the
statutory criteria are tied to other indicia which would
indicate the family relationship,
Finally, the point was argued that this
distinction is made only because illegitimates are less
likely to have received support than legitimates and thereby
raising the idea that this should be, in fact, judged on an
individual basis.

But as we have pointed out, it is not a

distinction generally between legitimates and illegitimates
on the basis of their having been likely to have received
support.

29
Those persons born after a death, disability, or
age 65 could not have received support and that is the basic
distinction.

Then those legitimates and those inheriting

illegitimates or people who are legitimated, who thereby
become legitimate even if, in their state they could not
have inherited as illegitimates, any of those people who
thereby acquire inheritance rights thereby are also allowed
to receive Social Security benefits.
QUESTION:

Mr. Boggs, the district court in this

case upheld this legislation fully, as I read the opinion,
upon the proposition that it is designed to prevent fraud.
Do you read its opinion that way?
MR. BOGGS:

That is the primary basis upon

which it relied, perhaps the only basis on which they relied.
I, in fact, don’t know whether the argument we are presenting
here was presented in that complexity.
QUESTION:

Vie 11, I am just referring to their

opinion, the court’s opinion.
MR. BOGGS:

Yes, that is what I am saying, that

that is what one could gather from their opinion.
QUESTION:

And you haven't spent *— maybe I

missed it — you haven’t devoted much time in your argument
to that.
MR. BOGGS:

No, we — I would say that we tried

to present what we believe is the strongest argument for

30

upholding it, which is the one that we have presented to date.
Certainly, we recognize that there are severe problems with
an argument based solely on a discrimination based on a
fraud rationale when additional investigation may be required
in some circumstances.
We think that, however, when the distinction
made Is based upon a status such as the acknowledgment or the
contribution occurring before the entitling event, xve believe
that that is not solely a fraud-based rationale but it is a
rationale based on what the basic entitlement of the Social
Security Act is.
QUESTION;

Well, except I think that you have

agreed that the justification for the legislation that would
be based

upon the support not having been available prior to
It has nothing to do with legitimacy or

illegitimacy.

It has to do with being afterborn.

MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And, therefore, that certainly does

not support this legislation, does it?

Because It doesn't

have — it is wholly irrelevant to legitimacy or illegitimacy.
In other words, an afterborn, legitimate child who has never
had any support ™
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:

Right, he does not —
— by definition because he hasn't

been in existence, he fully shares under the statute.

31
MR. BOGGS:

He Goes not recover, however,

because of his lost support at the time of the disability.
He recovers because of his ability to inherit.

That would

be our understanding.
QUESTION:
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:

But he gets —
I would suggest —
But if the hypothesis is that he has

never had any support, never had any expectation or fact of
support since he wasn’t In existence and hadn’t been born,
that cuts across legitimate and illegitimate children.

It

is equally true of both and I don’t think it is — I don't
see how you can argue that it supports this distinction
between legitimate and illegitimate children.
MR. BOGGS:

Well, your Honor, I take It you are

then saying that — it would appear to me that —
QUESTION:
MR. BOGGS:

I am just asking.
Okay.

Well, we would indicate that,

as we pointed out in talking about the 1939 Amendment, at
that time persons who could have gotten money from the
parents’ estate, that possible benefit was taken away and
instead, life payments were made as a substitute for that, so
that in our case, the legitimate and the illegitimate who
can inherit — in half the states and more if he is
legitimated — that child, by the ’39 Amendment, lost his
potentiality to get that money from the parents’ estate and

32
we feel it was not irrational at all for Congress to say that
those children, though perhaps they do not qualify under the
theory we just stated, also have right to receive similar
benefits during life so that would be the way that we make
that distinction.
QUESTION:

What happens after he dies, with the

illegitimate chile?
MR. BOGGS:
be paid.

Your Honor, a

death benefit would

Again, payments after death would be made to persons

who met the qualifications at the time of

death so that, for

instance, these children would, in fact, be able to receive
benefits after their wage earner died because in that case,
they would have — assuming he meets the test which is that
he was supporting them, he was contributing to their support
at the time of his death, those children then did lose
benefits, did lose support and that class of children
probably would have lost support as a result of the
entitling event.
QUESTION:

So they do inherit money?

These

illegitimate children, they —
MR. BOGGS:
They do not inherit.
QUESTION:
MR. BOGGS:
They receive —■

No, your Honor, they do not inherit.
They receive —
They get it after death.
No, they receive continuing benefits.

QUESTION:

Yes, they receive —
The Illegitimate children.

Right.

But they can’t get it before

Right?
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:

Because between —
No, because of the inheritance laws.
No.
Well, that is what you just said.
No, your Honor.
You said the reason that you didn't

give it to the illegitimate children was because they
couldn't inherit.

Is that what you said?

MR. BOGGS:

That is the reason they do not

receive that particular benefit.
QUESTION:
MR. BOGGS:

That's right.
But, for example, if they were not

acknowledged or if he was not contributing to them, they
would not receive the death benefits, either.
QUESTION:

Well, these children —* well, I just

want my facts straight.
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:
MR. BOGGS:

All right.
These children here —
Eugenio and Alicia, right.

34
QUESTION:

If they are alive when this man dies,

they will get Social Security benefits.
MR. BOGGS:

Right or wrong?

If his actions to date constitute an

acknowledgement, they would.

If the question is, his

contribution, then his contribution would have to continue
until the time of their death, time of his death.

But if

his actions to date constitute and acknowledgement, then
they would receive Social Security benefits.
We believe that the indications that we have set
out thus far do show that the statute has, while perhaps not,
as I have indicated, a basis in Aristotelian logic from a
first principle, as this Court has said, in the field of
social benefits, there may be a need for rough accommodations,
though they may be somewhat illogical under a strict logical
test, or unscientific.
In the Social Security Act, and not just in the
children's sections, Congress has made many distinctions, as
we pointed out, in

the wives' benefits, in the husbands’

benefits, to try to limit benefits to persons who probably
had lost support.
As yet another example, children beyond the age
of 18, when they may have no right to support, when they may
have no experience of support individually, still receive
benefits if they are students, because Congress has judged
that, on the whole, those people are more likely to have been

35
supported.
Now, a 21-year-old who is not a student cannot
corae in and offer proof that he was supported, cannot offer
proof of his individual dependency because Congress has made
the judgment that that is the classification that is to be
made and so we would urge upon the Court here that this is
not, in fact, a distinction made against illegitimate
children on the grounds of their illegitimacy.

It is the

distinction made first between those who are likely to have
lost support and those who are not likely to have lost
support at the time of the entitling event and that,
secondly, it is the payment which is made

to persons who

can inherit under valid state laws and who thereby suffer a
loss which we believe Congress is entitled to compensate for.

QUESTION:
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:

Mr. Boggs?
Yes?
Does Illinois require the father of

an illigitimate child to support it?
MR. BOGGS:

I believe that it does.

Certainly,

after this Court's decision in Gomez, any state which requires
a legitimate child to be supported, which is virtually all of
the states, would require the father of an illegitimate child,
to support it and that, of course, is one reason why if the
Court follows the rationale that a right to support is all
that is needed, then every illegitimate child, whether they

3b
had ever been [in] any kind of contact with the father,
ever since the moment of conception, would also be entitled
to benefits and that, of course, is the Norton

case which is

presently pending on a jurisdictional statement here and that
is why that if — if the true gravamen

is that you can

never say legitimate is different from illegitimate, then
not only these children would receive benefits, but
children who had never had any contact with the fathers so
tnat the — and, as we indicated, running across the law
there is the feeling that right to support is not sufficient.
It may frequently coincide but is not in itself sufficient
nor the basis of the Social Security Acts benefit payments.
If there are no further questions —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Boggs.

Do you have anything further, Mrs. Stevens?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JANE G. STEVENS
MRS. STEVENS:

May it please the Court:

I think that the Counsel for the Secretary has
depended on two — if I may say so — flawed arguments.
The first is that the likelihood that the
purpose of this section is to provide support for those most
likely to have lost support and I think that the clear fact
that legitimate children born after the onset of disability,
who never had support from current earnings, are eligible,
must indicate that that cannot be the purpose of this

distinction.

Legitimate children who have had no experience

of support are eligible to receive these benefits.
And the other buttress of the Secretary’s
argument is that the distinction is based on the distinction
between those who can and those who cannot inherit under the
laws of intestacy and there are two weaknesses in that
argument.
The first is in the legislative history.

In 1965,

when they added this section to the Act, Congress stated — I
will read a quote to you from Senate Report

in 1965

"The committee believes that in a national program that is
intended to pay benefits to replace support for a. child when
his father retires, dies or becomes disabled, whether a child
gets benefits should not depend on whether he can inherit his
father's intestate personal property under the lav/s of the
state in which his father happens to live,"
That was not, in fact, the intent of Congress.
The purpose of adding Section 216 in the first place was so
that this federal program would not depend exclusively on the
state laws of intestate succession.
And the other weakness of that argument is that
this is not a means for deciding who will receive benefits
after a wage earner dies, but who will receive benefits while
he is still alive and would be, but for his disability or
age, supporting the children and, therefore, it would be

38
rational, perhaps, to depend on laws providing support but
not on the laws of intestate succession.
In fact, Mr. Jimenez, in this case, has
acknowledged these children formally in writing and they will
be eligible to receive benefits when he dies and, in fact,
even if he had not acknowledged them in writing, they would
be eligible to receive benefits when he dies because he is
living with them and living with them is a means to qualify
under this section.
The likelihood of support is simply not
relevant in a section which makes necessary for eligibility,
acknowledgment or a court order which would give a right to
support or the experience of support or living with.

No one

will qualify under this section who has not the right to or
the experience of support, no matter when he was born in
relation to his father's age or disability and therefore, I
think that the argument on which the Secretary now,
apparently,entirely depends, is an argument without merit
and I therefore, respectfully request that this exclusion
of afterborn children be stricken from the section.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you, Mr. Boggs.

Thank you, Mrs. Stevens.

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 10:3^4 o'clock a.m. , the case
was submitted.]
