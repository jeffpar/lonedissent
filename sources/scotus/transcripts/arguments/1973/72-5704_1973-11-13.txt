OEM. ARGUMENT OF E, RICHARD LARSON, ON
BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. LARSON;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, this case is on appeal from a final judgment of a
thrse-judge district court, one judge dissenting, in 'the
Southern District of New York.
The issue here involves questions of due process,
equal protection, and statutory construction.

The issue here

stated specifically is whether consistent with the statutory
and constitutional framework of Unemployment Compensation,
a .Federal agency may deny compension, unemployment compensation,
to a former Federal probationary employee solely on the basis
of the employing agency's statement of its reasons for discharg­
ing the former employee without that employee ever being
provided with an opportunity for a fair hearing at which the
employee may contest the reasons for which he has been denied
unemployment compensation.
Stated more simply, the issue simply is whether
unemployment compensation may be denied without any hearing at
any time on the basic reasons for the denial of compensation.

3

This case arises within the context of the jointly
administered State and Federal Unemployment Compensation
Program,

the program through which the States administer the

payments of unemployment compensation to all covered employees
pursuant to various Federal requirements.
One of those Federal statutory requirements is the
requirement that a fair hearing before an impartial tribunal
be provided to all individuals whose claims for compensation
are denied.
This case arises from the appellees’ interpretation
of one of the unemployment compensation statutes, a section of
the Social Security Act codified, as 5 U.S.C. Section 8506(a).
Pursuant to the appellees’ interpretation of this particular
statute, a

Federal agency's ex parte statement of its reasons

for discharging a probationary employee are final and conclusive
upon the State Unemployment Compensation agency and accordingly
may not be reviewed by Idle State in a fair hearing which is
provided by the State.
This interpretation, it should be noted at the outset,
is directly contrary to the statutory interpretation provided
by the case of Smith v. District Unemployment Compensation Board,
a case decided more than three years ago by the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia.

The appellees' interpretation

which is at issue in this case is best illustrated by describing
the facts relevant to the denial of compensation to appellant

4
Christian in this case.
Appellant Christian was discharged by her employer,
the Post Office during her probationary period on the grounds
aiigedly of having an unsatisfactory attendance record,
specifically that she had not reported her absences to her
employer during a period when she was on a restricted sick leave
list.

Since Appellant Christian was not a permanent employee,

she was not eligible for a termination hearing.

This is not

something that is contested in this case at all.

We concede

she is not eligible for a termination hearing and do not seek
termination hearing.
Similarly, however, since she had not resigned her
Federal employment, she was not provided with an unemployment
compensation fair hearing for purposes of unemployment compen­
sation.

She was, however, basically eligible for compensation,

because she had worked the minimum amount of time and earned
a. minimum amount of remuneration in order to have her contractual
right to unemployment compensation, a contractual right which
this Court recognized in the case of California Department of
Human Res cm rces v. Java at 402 U.S.
Accordingly, she applied for compensation through a
claims examiner at the New York State Department of Labor.
The claims examiner normally obtains information both from
the claimant and from the former employer and makes an impartial
decision on the information that is received relevant to such

5

issues as reasons for termination of employment»

In this case,

however, the claims examiner felt himself bound by the Federal
appellees’ interpretation of the statute at issue here, and
accordingly, after receiving the ex parte statement of the
reasons for discharging appellant Christian, the claims examiner
denied compensation to appellant Christian on the grounds of
that ex parte statement»
QUESTION:

What would have been the case if appellant

had been a New York State employee?
ME. LARSON:

If the appellant had been a New York

State employee, and particularly a probationary State employee,
the appellant would have been treated as are all private
employees.

The claims examiner would have obtained information

from the State of New York concerning the reasons for discharge
and information from the claimant himself or herself, and on
the basis of that information, the claims examiner would have
made a fair determination as to the reasons for discharge for
the purposes of compensation,
QUESTION:

And your only point is that as a Federal

employee, she should get the same treatment.
MR. LARSON;

Oh, very definitely, your Honor.

I

should point out that —QUESTION:
MR. LARSON:

That is the point of this case.
Yes, it is.

Permanent and probationary private employees and

6
permanent and probationary State employees, permanent and
probationary Federal employees who resign, and all permanent
Federal employees receive this fair determination through an
opportunity for a fair hearing for purposes of unemployment
corap ens at i on»
QUESTION;

Some of the Federal employees get it in

the Federal form, not in the State form.
MR. LARSON;

Yes, in the Federal form through their

termination hearing, because of their status as permanent
employees *
?

QUESTION s

Under the Williams statute process for

the State employee it was not a hearing, if I followed you
correctly, but merely .an inquiry.
MR. LARSON:

That is the initial determination

procedure which you described in the Java case, Mr, Chief
Justice.

Subsequent to the initial determination procedure,

as is illustrated by the facts of appellant Christian here,
if the initial determination is adverse to the claimant, the
Social Security Act requires that the State must provide an
opportunity for a fair hearing before an impartial tribunal.
QUESTIONs

You weren1t undertaking to describe the

whole process, but only the initial eligibility.
MR, LARSON;

Well, at this stage, yes.

I am getting

to the hearing because something significant happened at this
hearing with regard to appellant Christian, and that is that

7

although the appellees’ interpretation of the statute at issue
here requires the fair hearing referee at the second stage, now,
requires the fair hearing referee to accept the ex parte
statement of reasons by the Federal agency as final and
conclusive.

The hearing referee in this case, after hearing

the evidence submitted orally on the issue of termination by
appellant Christian and after having received a statement from
the Post Office submitted in lieu of appearance through the
Industrial Commissioner, the hearing referee here disregarded
the appellees’ interpretation of the statute and in fact did
make a fair finding on the issue that was before the referee.
Now, this was a very short-lived fair determination
procedure because the State immediately appealed this fair
finding, this fair determination procedure, to the State
Appeal Board, and the State Appeal Board reversed on the grounds
that the State had to accept the Federal reasons a3 final and
conclusive.

So it is a two-step process.

QUESTION:
gets neither the

determination nor the ultimate

final determination.
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Justice Brennan.
Well, I suppose she gets the initial

determination, but it is preordained, is that it?
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

It certainly is not a fair determination,
No, she has no fair hearing.

MR. LARSON:

For example, in Java this Court noted

that the word "due" in section 503 of the Social Security Act
meant after the first time when both parties could be heard
and an impartial decision rendered.
determination procedure.

That was the initial

That, as a fair process reached in

Java, never occurs with regard to Federal probationary
employees.
QUESTION:

There is no argument there between you

and your brothers on the other side as to what happens.
MR. LARSON:

There .is no argument.

This is accepted.

Before turning to the due process and equal protection
it

and the statutory construction issues in this case, 1' would
like to reiterate a couple of points about what this case is
#-

V

about and what it is not about.

This is particularly in light

of the brief submitted by the Federal appellees in this case.
The hearing which is sought in this case and which we
contend is constitutionally and statutorily required is an
unemployment compensation hearing for purposes of unemployment
compensation.

The appellants do not seek a termination hearing.

They do not seek re-employment.

Rather, all that is sought here

is a fair determination procedure through a fair hearing for
purposes of unemployment compensation.
Nov/, second, the provision of a fair hearing for
purposes of unemployment compensation to the appellants here
would have no effect whatsoever upon the Federal discharge

9

procedures with regard to probationary employees.

It is

conceded on the record,, indeed the Federal regulations provide,
and we do not challenge them, that a Federal probationary
employee may be discharged without cause during his probationary
period.

Accordingly, if there may be a discharge without cause,

a subsequent hearing for purposes of unemployment compensation
which merely review the reasons or the

lack of reasons for the

discharge, could have no effect upon the discharge procedure
for that employee.
Mow, thirdly, the issue here, the unemployment
compensation issue at the hearings, the reasons for termination,
as this Court noted in Java, the reasons for termination
constitute the most frequently disputed issue in unemployment
compensation.

And as we point out in our brief, note 8 on page

10, more than 60 percent of the claims in the State of Hew York
that reach the1 fair hearing referee involve issues concerning
reasons for termination.

So it is a frequently disputed issue

in unemployment compensation, and this is what is being denied
to the appellants here.
Mow, fourth, we have contended and we continue to
contend that the fair hearing which we say is required both
constitutionally and statutorily, may be provided either by the
Federal appellees or by the State appellees.

Wow, particularly

relevant here is the Circuit Court of Appeals decision in
Smith,

What happened in Smith is that the panel composed of

10

Judges Leventhal, Lahey and Robb

said that in the first

instance the Federal agencies or the Civil Service Commission
could provide the hearing for purposes of unemployment compensa­
tion to the Federal employee.

But if the Federal agencies

or the Civil Service Commission did not provide the hearing,
in that case the State mechanism, the unemployment compensation
agency mechanism for fair hearings which is already in existence
and which provides fair hearings to all other employees should
be made available and would be made available for the Federal
employees in a similar manner.

In other words, the fair hearing

could be provided either at the State level or at the Federal
level.
Fifth, the Smith case which the -QUESTION;

Are you saying that you should have a

hearing to determine whether that cause existed?

Let’s assume

the unemployment people say, "You were discharged for cause,"
Is the issue whether you were discharged — whether the
Government said you were discharged for cause or as a matter
of fact whether there was cause?
MR. LARSON;

Well, the issue is whether there was

cause, whether as a matter of fact there was cause,
QUESTION;

Do you agree that the Government may

discharge a probationary employee for no cause at all?
MR, LARSON;
QUESTION;

Right.
You must agree also that they could

11
discharge him for cause.
MR. LARSON5

Certainly, they may, by just saying, you

were late yesterday, and discharge him.
QUESTION:
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

Whether it is true or false.
Correct,

In that situation --

If that is the reason they discharged him,

you say there must be a hearing to go behind that statement
at the unemployment stage?
MR. LARSON:

Well, the way the system operates right

now, pursuant to the appellees' interpretation of the statute,
whatever reason the Federal appellees, or the Federal agency
gives is final and conclusive and can never be reviewed.

For

instance, the Federal agency may say, "You were late yesterday."
In appellant Christian’s case, the facts were very similar to
that, they were, "You were absent yesterday and you did not
call in."

Appellant Christian said, "My older daughter did

call in, and she advised me that she did. so, and I had her
do so.

The telephone in my apartment does not work." There

were underlying facts as to whether or not she did call in,
which is a crucial determination, because the State applies
its state law as to whether it is misconduct or •—
QUESTION:

Well, then, I gather you say the hearing

you require then really is something that you can’t get
satisfied just by a paper record.
MR. LARSON;

You think you must have “*~

Oh, certainly not.

MR. LARSON;

In our due process claim, of course, we

requisite elements of a due process hearing should be provided.

MR. LARSON;

Yes.
I should note here that the State procedure

as well as the Federal procedure with regard to terminating
Federal employees, the elements of the hearings are basically
the due process element.

There is an impartial hearing

decision must be based upon the evidence.

Let me see if I understand this.

If this

13
were a State employee, at the initial stage, x^hatever form that
hearing takes, the determination by the hearing examiner would
be what, that there was cause or there was not cause, which?
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

I —
At the initial stage.

There's a dismissal

in the State service.
MR. LARSON:

In the State situation the hearing

examiner would base its determination upon —
QUESTION:

I know, but what would he decide, there

was cause or there was not cause, which?
MR, LARSON;
QUESTION:
MR, LARSON:

It depends upon the facts before him,
But that's what he would decide.
That's what he would decide.

He would

decide the facts before him.

If he decided there was cause, whatever it

may have been, then she would be ineligible for unemployment
compens ation?
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

At that stage, yes,
If there was no cause, then she would be

eligible at that stage, is that it?
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

Correct.
And then the next step is the fair hearing

at which the issue is the same, isn't it?
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
With just a different procedure.

14
MR. LARSON;

More elaborate procedure where there

is an opportunity for cross-examination and confrontation of
witnesses.
QUESTION:

But the State agencies handling the Federal

employees accept the certification of the Federal officials

MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

Final and conclusive.
At both stages*

MR, LARSONs
QUESTION:

At both stages,
What if, instead of having a one-year

probationary period, the petitioner here, the appellant here,
had been hired on a one-year contract,
Government wanted them.

if the

If the year expires, the contract

expires, there is unemployment, not renewed.
MR, LARSON:

Section 8501 which provides the basic

coverage of the law specifically excepts from coverage certain
Federal employees.

It does except that type of Federal employee

who is on a contractor fee basis.

So that person would not be

covered.
QUESTION:

How do you distinguish a one-year

probationer from a one-year termination?
MR. LARSON:

I’m not sure I understand your question,

Mr, Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

How is a one-year probationer who is not

continued in the service different from a one-year contract

15
employee who is not renewed?
MR. LARSONz

Well, the unemployment compensation is

not available to the latter employee.

If it were available to

the latter employees who were on a contract basis, I would say
that that would be a resignation situation basically, or it
may be interpreted as a layoff.
person would be eligible.

If it is a layoff, then the

But this is a factor which tinder

State law or witit regard to all State employees, private
employees, Federal permanent employees, is fairly decided if
there are factual issues, it is fairly decided for those
employees.

But if it’s a Federal probationary employee, it is

not fairly decided.

The Federal reasons are automatically

accepted as binding

and conclusive.

With regard to the due process argument, most of the
due process .cases which come before this Court, of course,
concern the finer issues of due process with regard to the
timing of the hearing or the form of the specific elements of
the hearing.

Here, of course, the issue is much more basic

since there is no hearing at any time, yet this contractual
right is taken away from the appellant.

Here there is no

impartial decision-maker, there is no decision to be based
upon the evidence, there is no oral presentation of evidence,
no oral argument, no right to representation, no confrontation
or cross-examination.
QUESTION:

None of these elements are here.
Burney .and Torres,

I take it

16

approved the absence o£ some of those procedures for a termination
of unemployment compensation.

Would you apply a different

standard to the initial eligibility determination?
MR. LARSON s

No.

I think I should point out that in

Torres, of course, as in the Burney case, the prior hearing
cases which were at issue here already provided the precise
procedure which we are seeking here.

The issue in Torres and

Burney was a prior hearing, what was required prior to the
termination of benefits.

But as required by statute, as Mr.

Chief Justice asked, the procedure that we are seeking here was
required to be provided in Torres and in Burney, the fair
initial determination and the fair hearing procedure later.
That was not at issue in Burney or Torres,

That was already

statutorily provided.
This is not a prior hearing.

This is just a hearing.

There is no hearing, no fairness in this procedure at all.
As the appellees state at page 17 of their brief, all they find,
all they determine, they state thcit. it's merely a statement of
the agency’s reasons for discharging the employee.

That's all

there is.
QUESTIONi

You say a more far-reaching type of hearing

is required in making an initial determination that you are
entitled to a right than in making a later determination that
takes it sway from you?
MR. LARSONs

No, I am not suggesting that at all.

17
QUESTION:

Well, then, why is there that distinction

that you suggest between a hearing in determining initial
eligibility and a hearing terminating the right?
MR. LARSON:

That's provided for in the statute.

We

do not challenge that statutory scheme of having an initial
determination procedure, which is not a full-blown hearing.
We do not challenge the absence of full-blown hearing procedures
at the initial stage, because there is a later statutory hearing
Here there is never any statutory hearing, nor is there even
a fair initial determination process.
I think the lack of one of the essential elements of
a due process hearing, confrontation and cross-examination, is
particularly well illustrated by appellant Green’s case.
.Appellant Green was discharged by his employer, the Treasury
Department, as noted on page 52 of the appendix as "you were
observed " engaging in such and such alleged misconduct.
Now, appellant Green never knew who this observer was
QUESTION:
MR. LARSONs
QUESTION:
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:
MR. LARSON:

Is he the sky marshal?
He is the sky marshal, yes.
Drinking 24 hours before he had to fly?
Yes.

Now, it’s alleged --

Or was observed to,
He was observed to have been drinking.

The observation, as a matter of fact, occurred — or alleged
to have occurred more than three and a half months prior to his

18

termination.

In other words, he was not terminated immediately

after this alleged event took place.

Rather, they waited .

It was six days before the end of his probationary period at
which he was terminated for this alleged observation which took
place three and a half months before.
Now, of course, appellant Green was allowed no
opportunity for confrontation or cross-examination of this
unknown observer.

This element was completely absent, as are

the other elements of a fair hearing.

There is no procedure,

there is no requirement for a fair hearing examiner or fair
decision-maker.

Instead, the decision-maker here is conceded

to be the agency, a biased party.

Indeed, there is no require­

ment that the decision be based upon the. evidence. Instead
■•
all that we have is the ex parte statement of the reasons by
the Pederail agency.

This procedure, we submit, is a one-sided

determination of facts decisive of contractual rights —
QUESTION:

...

turns on 501 and 503,

does it?
MR. LARSON:

The statutory argument is based on, I

guess, many different factors.

At the outset we would look

at the panel decision in the Smith case, and what they did, of
course, is they looked at unemployment compensation generally,,
the right to a fair hearing, that this is a very important right
in the unemployment compensation statutory scheme, and that
this fair hearing cannot be lightly taken away.

19
Now, of course, the appellees in this ease do not
contend that their interpretation of the statute is necessarily
the only interpretation of the statute.

All they contend is

that the Secretary has been granted the authority to make whatever
fact-finding procedure it chooses to make, and that here it
chose not to provide for fairness or for hearing procedures.
We contend that so long as they concede that their
construction is not one that they contend

isi statutorily

required, indeed the contrary interpretation is required, that
a fair hearing must be provided here.
we hinge on the word "findings."
"findings."

Also, it is significant

Congressused the word

It is not used in other words.

This is a contextual

work, and in the context of unemployment compensation, the
word "findings" very fairly can mean findings after a hearing.
Additionally, we look very strongly to the dominant
legislative theme of providing unemployment compensation to
Federal employees.

That dominant scheme is simply to make

employees equal to State and private employees, provide them
with the same terms and conditions of employment as are
provided to other employees.
So I should note that this Court need not declare the
statute unconstitutional, that the proper statutory construction
here does require that a hearing be provided to the appellants.
I should also note that this Court, of course, has reviewed
many cases of statutory construction which have involved

20

questions of due process where the due process consideration —
QUESTION:

What I was asking particularly, Mr, Larson,

42 U.S.C. 503 says that the Secretary of Labor takes no
certification unless he finds that the law of the State provides
opportunity for a fair hearing before an impartial tribunal
for all individuals whose claims for unemployment compensation
are denied.

And my question was, is that the statute on which

you rely?
MRt LARSON;

That is one of the statutes which we

rely on very definitely.

That is the most clear statement made

by the Congress with regard to the provision of fair hearing.
But there are a host of other avenues which lead to the same
conclusion that a hearing must be provided.
I notice my time has expired.

I would like to save

whatever time I have left for rebuttal.

•

Let me ask you one question.

Lead me out

Isn't there a little jurisdictional problem

so far as the Federal appellees are concerned here?
MR. LARSON;

I don't think there is, Mr. Justice

Blackmun.
QUESTION:

Didn't the District Court decide against

you so far as the Federal employees are concerned?
MR. LARSON:

Yes, the District Court did.

the District Court was clearly wrong, of course.

I think
a

1908

decision by this Court on mandamus under 1361 jurisdiction

2.1

makes clear that common law — the relief available through
common law mandamus includes corrective orders against Federal
officials who violated the Constitution.

What the District Court

did was it held that — it determined there was no mandamus
jurisdiction over the Federal defendants and consequently did
not reach the constitutional issues as to the Federal defendants.
But X would submit that Garfield, a decision more than 60 years
old reached by this Court, makes clear that the mandamus
remedy extends to the corrective orders against unconstitutional
activity.
QUESTION;

Well, Federal courts usually don’t so

clearly misstep as to jurisdiction.
MR. LARSON;
Honor.

1 submit they did in this case, your

I should also note that the Federal District Court

dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under 1343(3), and. we contend
through a joint participation theory of this Federal-State
program, that the Federal Government is in joint participation
with the State appellees and accordingly are properly named
a-s defendants under 1343(3) *
QUESTION:

What about 1337?

MR. LARSON:

We did not allege that in our complaint.

favor?
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

It certainly is.
Where do you get joint participation here

22
between the State and Federal employees?

My impression of the

State*s position was that they are perfectly willing to give
you whatever the Federal Government provides by statute.

They

are willing to give you the benefit of their full hearing if
they are not precluded by the Federal statute.

They really

have no dispute with you at all.
MR. LARSON;

Well, that’s, of course, the position

they have taken in argument with us, but X must remember that
they, of course, denied a fair hearing to appellants Christian
and Green in this case.

If it had not been for their cooperation,

their agreement with the Federal defendants or Federal appellees
in this action, a joint participation which is clear to the
statute, both section 8502 and 8504
Federal Government assigns all

make clear that the

wages, all claims to the State

and that the State is to operate the program.
I think also a quote from Shapiro v. Thompson is
appropriate where the Court stated that Congress is without
power to compel State cooperation in a program, a joint FederalState program, which violates the equal protection clause.
Nov;, this is a joint Federal-State program, and
unquestionably it is pursuant to Federal law, but it is the
State actually which has denied the fair hearing here,
I notice my time is up.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you.
Mr. Evans.

23
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS ON BEHALF
OF THE APPELLEES
MR. EVANSs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court, before addressing the constitutional issues that Mr.
Larson has discnassed, I would like to raise, an alternative
ground for affirmance which I think will permit this Court to
decide the case, without reaching the constitutional issues.
The appellants stand before this Court in this postures
They are attacking the constitutional adequacy of procedures
that they have never invoked.

Under familiar principles

requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies, their claim
should not be entertained.

To understand why we tales this

position, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of what
the procedures are that are provided by the regulations,and
those government regulations are set out at pages 33 to 38 of
our brief.
The stage is set for these procedures, of course,
when an applicant for unemployment compensation submits an
application to a State unemployment compensation board.

The

State unemployment compensation board thereupon seeks information from the Federal employing agency with respect to the
employee’s service, including most particularly for this case
the reasons for the termination.
Now, if a discharged probationary employee, which is
what we have in this case, is denied unemployment compensation

24
the
because of/sfcated reason

for his discharge, he has the

folloxtfing procedures available to him:
First, under section 609,22 of the regulations, x^hich
appears at page 36, he may obtain from the employing agency
any information he needs relating to the basis for the Federal
finding, the Federal finding being the reason stated for
his discharge.
Under section 609,8 which is two pages earlier, on
34, the employing agency must furnish this information in
writing.

And I add right here that for appellant Green, if he

wished to know who it was who observed him drinking at the time
he was observed drinking, he was free to ask the question and
get a response in writing.
Second, under 609,23, which is at the bottom of page 36,
top of page 37, the employee may file a written request for
reconsideration and correction of the findings that, have been
submitted to the State agency, and he may submit together with
that request any information he has to support his request.
Again, referring back to the preceding page at 609,9, the
agency must consider all information submitted, it must review
its findings, it must correct any errors, and it must then
affirm, modify, ox* reverse whatever findings

axe affected,

What book are you referring to, Mr. Evans?

MR. EVANS:

QUESTION:

This is ail a paper proceeding.
That, you suggest, is at least as good as

the initial —
MR. EVANS:

Yes, I think that’s right.

Well, yes,

that’s a fair statement.
If there is a correction that is made by the Federal
employing agency, the agency is required to submit this to the
State and the State, if the corrections look like they entitle
the employee to a redeterminatian, the State is required by
the regulations to make that redetermination.
QUESTION:

".. shall affirm, modify, or reverse any

or all of its Federal findings in writing."

If it affirms

them, what does it do?
MR. EVANS:

Well, it just sends the same slip it

sent, in the first place saying, “We have considered and we
affirm, or sustain,"
QUESTION:

Do you think "modify” is more elaborate.

If they reverse, I suppose, it is still more elaborate.
MR. EVANS:

That's right.

QUETSION- But if they affirm., they send the same old
slip back to the State and that's the end of the matter, isn't
it?
MR. EVANS:

That's the end of the matter.

These' are, in any event, the procedures, the
corrective procedures that are available and not invoked.

And

it’s important to consider how they might have operated in
these cases if they had been invoked,,

Appellant Christian was

terminated after six months of employment as a letter carrier
because of a history of unauthorised, absences which climaxed
in two instances in which she was — two days in which she was
absent without notifying her supervisor.

This is after she

had been warned and had been placed on a restricted sick list
which required her to bring in an authorized medical excuse
for any further absences.

And upon receipt by the State board

of this information, the determination was made that she would
not be eligible for unemployment compensation because the facts
amounted to a voluntary quitting without good cause, that is,
under State lav/ these facts led to the conclusion that she
provoked her discharge by the final two absences,
QUESTION:

First, with regard to this argument on

exhaustion, I gather your position is, no matter how meritorious
the due process claims may be, not entitled to have them
determined here because they didn't exhaust these.
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

That is ray point.

That is right.

But you say this argument was never made

28

MR, EVANS;

It was never made to the district court

so far as I can determine, Mr» Justice Stewart, but it is an
alternative ground for affirmance, and I think we are entitled
to present it here, and I think this Court is entitled to
consider the argument in disposing of the case.
QUESTION:

Well, maybe, instead of our considering it,

we should send it back to the district court to consider it.
MR. EVANS:

Well, it’s a possibility.

I don’t think

it requires any factual inquiry that would be more appropriate
for the district court.

It seems to ms the kind of question

that can be decided on the basis of what's before this Court
and there is no real benefit to be gained by remanding it for
the purpose.
«

QUESTION:

Well, do you claim that this procedure is

still available and that either Mr. Christian or Mr. Green —
I guess it's Ms*

Christian

redetermination under these procedures?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

That's problematical, Mr. Justice —
Of a reason for termination that would

not foreclose them from State unemployment compensation?
MR. EVANS:

That presents a problem.

The regulations

that it finds must be made within one year.

may be impossible.

It

I would think that the regulations might

29

liberally be construed in these cases to permit them to
exhaust these procedures if they sought to do so on remand or
upon their own.
After the denial of Christian's claim, she was given
a copy of the findings, and as she states in her affidavit
which appears in the appendix at pages 15 and 18, she sets
out her disagreement with the -underlying facts that were
transmitted to the State agency.

She claimed that she failed

to report her absences in the older absences because she couldn’t
find a telephone that was in working order in her neighborhood
to call in and she said that the last two absences were
required by corape 1 ling family circumstances and that in fact
she had asked her oldest daughter to make a telephone call to
her supervisor, and in fact her daughter said that she had done
so.
These are precisely the kinds of new facts, new
information that the regulations contemplate being submitted to
the agency for their consideration.

That was never done here.

The agency never had a chance to consider these new facts.
The facts that were stated by appellant Christian, she might
well have submitted --QUESTION;

MR. EVANS:

The complaint and the agreed upon statement

of material facts as to which there was no dispute make it
clear that appellants have not sought any relief from the
employing agency, although they recognize that the procedures
exist.

They make no mention of any fact of having exhausted

31
those procedures»

They did not.

Although again in their

complaint they took cognizance of the existence of these
procedures.

There was no allegation that they were invoked.

But if they had raised that point at that

time, they might have.
MR. EVANS:

Well, they —

.

QUESTION:

The decision is now to raise it where

there is no way for them to answer it.
MR, EVANS:

Well, as I say, think the regulations

might be construed to permit them to exhaust their remedies
even novi even though the time has elapsed because of this
litigation.

But I think they would be permitted an opportunity

to undergo those procedures.
The same situation is present in the case of
appellant Green who was discharged for drinking before flight
duty.

He claims he was denied -- his unemployment compensation

32

claim was denied on the grounds that he was discharged for
misconduct under State law.

And he claims again he is innocent

of these charges, but he never bothered to give his employer
the benefit of any exculpatory information he may have, nor did
he take advantage of the opportunity he had to get the
information he claims he didn't have to make the judgment with.

• . ■ V;

.V

In these circumstances, in our view, the appellants
should not be heard to complain of corrective procedures they
haven't invoked.

The

exhaustion principle has traditionally
?

been required because of what this Court in McCord v. United
States called the practical notions of judicial efficiency.
If Christian and Green had invoked the procedures, it may be
that their employing agencies would have agreed that they had
made a mistake and would have corrected the findings.

If that

were the result, this Court, or no court would have had to
intervene.

There would have been no judicial issue.
QUESTION;

If exhaustion is a matter of defense, I

suppose Justice Marshall is quite right that this is something
the Government should have raised in answer to the complaint.
On the other hand, if it. is a prerequisite to be able to
proceed with adjudication, then I suppose the plaintiff has to
allege.

Do you have any citations as to which side of the

line it's on?
MR. EVANS;
Rehnquist.

I don't have any citations, Mr. Justice

I believe it ought to be the burden of the

33

plaintiff to make the allegation.
But I say again, while the issue may be somewhat
ambiguous in the state of the record here.

I don’t think there

is any legitimate factual dispute over it.

I think Mr. Larson

will concede that there is no question that they didn't exhaust
these procedures.
QUESTION;

Of course, that's kind of tough to ask

opposing counsel to concede something that's outside the record.
MR. EVANS:

Well, the problem is that there is nothing

in the record to suggest that they did exhaust it, and there is
nothing in the record to suggest they didn't either.

But I

guess the question comes down to where the burden lies, and I
think I would —QUESTION:

down that the facts

are needed for this should have been presented in the lower
court, and since you are raising them, why didn't you raise it
then instead of raising it now?

QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

Yes, I certainly are.

I think that the

thrust of the Government's response to the suit in the court
below was that there was no subject matter jurisdiction and

they responded on the merits of the constitutional claims, and
they proceeded on the jurisdictional issues, and the constitutional
claims of course were hot addressed with respect to the Federal
defendants in this case.
There is a corollary notion to that of judicial
efficiency that impels, that suggests that this Court ought not
to entertain the issue at this time, and that is the notion
of administrative autonomy which requires that an agency be
given a chance to correct its own errors®

Here no such chance

was given.
The only response that the appellants have made to
this argument, incidentally, is contained in a footnote in their
reply brief.

I would like to read you a
"The consequence of

permitting probationary employees to litigate the reasons for
their discharge, ostensibly merely to determine their eligiblity
fo unemployment benefits, would be to overturn the settled
principle that a probationary employee does not have the right
to contest the propriety of his discharge."
I take it that means that the principle that you say
is settled and is conceded by your opponent is that a
probationary employee may be discharged with or without cause
and with or without a hearing, no hearing as a matter of fact.
Now, I understand your brief to say that if we decide the case
against the Government on this issue that this will then become
a precedent that will overturn the settled practice with respect
to the discharge of probationary employees.
Nov/, if that's so, please tell me why.

36
MR. EVANS:
Mr. Justice,

I think it’s probably

overstatement,

There is, of course, an analytical distinction

between a hearing with respect to the reasons for discharge
as it relates to unemployment compensation and a hearing with
respect to the validity of the discharge looking towards
reinstatement.

And there is no question that they are separate.

But the thrust of the statement, while it may have been an
overstatement, I think is accurate.
One, of the reasons v/hy a hearing would be inadvisable
and one of the reasons why a hearing is not provided, I think,
is that with respect to probationary employees, there needs to
be the greatest amount of flexibility in an effort to weed
out before an employee, gets tenured status
unsuitable employees

incompetent and

because of the importance of having able

people administering the Government's vital,programs.

Once

a man becomes tenured, it’s very difficult to remove hire, and
there are a whole panoply of procedures, and just because of
that extra protection he gets, it's necessary that there be
great flexibility in the early stage.
Now, a hearing on the reason for discharge of a
probationary employee is going to have an impact on the
decisions supervisors make necessarily,
issue is one of reinstatement.

It is not because the

The fact of the matter is that

a hearing, the prospect of a hearing is likely to be a deterrent
to a supervisor just because he realizes that there is a great

37

deal of manpower that has to go into it, a great deal of
preparation.

His decision in a sense is going to be put on the

line, even though there is not going to be a reinstatement that
will result from it.

There is going to be a psychological

impact, and it will, I think, inhibit the flexibility I think is
so essential.
So in answer to your question, there is a relationship,
though it's not an analytically clear one.
I would like to turn briefly to the statutory inter­
pretation question.

Mr. Justice Brennan, I should note for

your benefit, X think, the issue turns not. on the section that
you had read; it turns on section 8506 of Title V which is
set forth at our brief at pages 31 and 32.
QUESTION;

That’s the one, isn’t it, that authorises

the statement of reasons, or something?
MR* EVANS s

That's right.

That’s the one that requires

the Federal employing agency to respond to a request from a
State agency by giving the findings, is what the word is,
Now, the issue really turns on whether findings
imply the hearings.

It seems to me plain that. ■ ’’findings"

doesn’t have that implication.

What it means here

a determination after an inquiry.

is simply

It has no implication one

way or the other as to the form that inquiry would take, and
you know, when Congress has had a desire to require a hearing,
it has not found it difficult to do so ambiguously.

And I

38

should mention in the very next section, 8507, which is not
reprinted in the brief — 8507 deals with the right of a
State agency or the Secretary of Labor to recoup compensation
paid to an employee who made a false statement if he first
finds that there has been a false statement made.
Now, what that says is a finding by a State agency
or the Secretary may be made only after an opportunity for a
fair hearing.
In the very next section, using the exact same words,
they found it necessary to add "only after a hearing,"

I think

that makes it quite clear that Congress did not contemplate
that there necessarily be a hearing preceding the findings that
are referred to in 8506.
Mr, Larson is correct in saying that we do not say
that this is the only possible interpretation of the statute,
I think a lot of the policy of the unemployment statutesthat
the appellants set forth in their brief may well give this
Court the option, if it came to that, of reading the statute
to require a hearing if if was necessary to preserve its
constitutionality,
The point is, however, that this is a reading of the
statute by the agency principally responsible for administering
it, that we think it’s permissible, and that we think ought to
be respected unless there is a constitutional problem.
There are really two constitutional issues here.

One

39

is a dus process issue and one is an equal protection issue,
and our position is that neither argument is valid.

To start

with the due process issue, we believe that the due process
clause is not even implicated.

It provides that no person shall

be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of
law.

There is no question that the appellants have not been

deprived of life? they don’t assert that they have been deprived
of liberty.

So the question is whether there is a property right

at stake.
Our position is that the property right in unemployment
compensation benefits, like the right to continued employment
in the Roth case is defined by the rules and understandings under
which the benefit is granted. In Roth

the rule and understandings

were contained, in the terms of the appointment.

In this case

the rules and understandings are contained within the terms
of the stcitutes and governing regulation.

And those statutes

and governing regulations make clear that the procedures
available for correcting errors is the only procedure and that is
the only way one can correct errors that they find are made.
So when one seeks unemployment compensatioxx benefits,one seeks
them with the understanding that if there are errors in the
Federal findings, they can be corrected by one method and one
method only.

In these” circumstances there is no property right

unless the procedures that are specified have in some sense
been denied to the person.

40
I can think of one example that might serve to make
the point.

Suppose that Congress enacted a statute granting

benefits to victims of crime provided that the administrator
should first find on the basis of an application that has been,
submitted on the basis of certified hospital and police records,
that in fact the person was injured in the course of a violent
crime.

And suppose further that the administrative determination

was made unreviewahle except that the applicant after a denial
of his application might inquire further of the administrator
as to the basis of the denial and might ;sefk reconsideration.
Now, this is basically what we have here, and I
think it clear that there would be no due process right, no
legitimate entitlement that an applicant

who had been injured,

who claimed to have been injured in the course of a violent
crime would have to a due process hearing before the denial.
This is because the right as Congress has defined it includes
only the procedure that Congress has specified.
<

.

QUESTION:

Now, as Congress has defined the right,

however, to statutory entitlement of unemployment compensation,
it’s required that the State system give an opportunity for a
fair hearing before an impartial tribunal for all individuals
whose claims for unemployment compensation are denied.

Now,

those are the terms of State unemployment compensation.
MR, EVANS:

Mr. Justice.Stewart, that language comes

from, I believe, Title 42 of the Social Security Act which, of

41
course, does set up the standard by which the Secretary will
approve State unemployment compensation plans»

But that is

quite different than, the statutory scheme that was created for
unemployment compensation for Federal employees«
QUESTIONs

Basically, Federal employees were to be

given the benefits that these State statutes give to otherunemployed.
MR, EVANS:

That's right, except that the statute

clearly said that the information that is submitted to the
State agency by the Federal employing agency shall be binding
and conclusive.

There is no ambiguity about that.

There may

be some ambiguity about whether the Federal Government needs
first to give them a hearing before they transmit the findings
or after they have transmitted the findings,

Mow, there is no question that the findings here were
made in accordance with the regulations,
QUESTION;

Well, it’s a question about whether or not

they were findings.
MR. EViUSFS

%

I dealt with that.

Well, there is a statutory question, and
But assuming that the Secretary's reading

is correct, or permissible, I should say, and that findings
needn't be predicated upon a hearing, it seems to me quite
clear that Congress has made it clear that they have defined
the right with the condition that these findings will be
conclusive and not be open for further litigation,
I would like to touch very briefly on the equal
protection argument.

There has been suggestion that there is

a constitutionally impermissible discrimination between State
employees and private employees who are given the full benefits
and between probationary Federal employees who are not given
full benefits.

But again these statutes have been set up at

different times for different purposes, and it seems to me
perfectly proper for Congress to Strike a different balance
I
in the context of Federally funded benefits when you are
dealing with Federal employing agencies.

The Congress might

reasonably determine that it was too much of a burden on the

43

Federal Government to require it to respond with hearings in
every case, end especially where they are giving as an
alternative, at least on its face, so far as we can tell from
this case, an adequate way of correcting the errors that might
have been made.
QUESTION:

Mr, Evans, do I understand the agency is

now going along with the District of Columbia decisions

of the

Smith case is it?
MR. EVANS:

Yes, it is.

Shortly after the Smith

case was decided, the Secretary of Labor amended his regulations
to provide that an employee who has resigned, a probationary
employee who has resigned and who

disputes the findings of

the Federal employing agency may have a hearing.
is a reason for that, too.

Nov?, there

In the case of a discharged employee,

there is no question as to what the reasons were.

I mean, it is

within the Federal Government competence to know what
in its own mind when it discharged an employee.

was

When an employee

resigns however, for example, if he resigns saying that he
resigned because it was too cold to work in that building, and
in fact the fact is that from the Federal standpoint he resigned
three days after he was told he was going to be terminated or
might be terminated, there is no way to resolve definitively
what was in the employee's mind.

And if he wishes to come in

at that point and show that what was in his mind was that the
room was cold, that's available to him under the regulations.

44
There is one ofcher distinction, and that is between
the treatment ,of probationary employees and permanent employees.
And I think that the differences there relate not to the
statute which gives permanent employees no greater rights to
hearings.

For them, too, the findings are final and conclusive.

But it relates to their different civil service status..
have a right to a hearing

They

with respect to their continued

tenure, and if it turns out after that hearing that the findings
need to be corrected, well, the regulations specify that the
agency must correct findings,if it determines that there was
an error, within a year.

But the purpose of the hearing is

not to challenge the findings for unemployment compensation,
but solely to challenge the validity of the discharge.

So

again there is a distinction between them, and in light of all
this, we submit that the decision below should be affirmed.
