Hr. Solicitor General, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT II. BORK,
SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Please the Court:
This appeal, which is obviously similar in
many respects to the case we have just heard, concerns,
even more obviously, I think, the values I suggested were
protected by Article 13^ and here, Article 133 as well.
The conduct here is especially egregious and I
think it is impossible for anybody to say that the Appellee
here could not have known, must not have known what he was
doing was prejudicial to good order and discipline, was not
the standard of conduct expected of an officer and a
gentleman and, indeed, of course, he was also convicted
under Article 90 for the direct disobedience of the lawful
order of a superior commissioned officer.
Upon conviction, Captain Levy was sentenced to
dismissal from the Service, forfeiture of all pay and
allowances and confinement for three years at hard labor.
Now, Article 90, as I say, provides for the

4
punishment of anyone subject to the Uniform Code of Military
Justice who willfully disobeys a lawful command of a superior
commissioned officer and the specification or charge levied
against Captain Levy was that he willfully disobeyed a
Colonel's command to establish and operate a Phase II
training program for Special Porces AidMen

in dermatology

and the evidence showed that one of the functions of the
hospital to which he was assigned, which was Fort Jackson,
South Carolina — he went there as soon as he was taken into
the Service — was to train Special Forces AidMen, who are
men capable of giving

certain levels of medical service in

the field and Captain Levy was the chief of the dermatology
service.
In fact, he was the only trained dermatologist at
that hospital and he had the responsibility to conduct this
training.

For a time he did so, during early 1966 and then

he did so with increasing irregularity and incompleteness.
Reports began to come in to the Colonel, Colonel
Fancy, who commanded the hospital, that training was not being
done adequately.
He investigated and discovered that Captain Levy
had, by now, totally neglected his duties in training AidMen.
[sic]
He called Colonel Levy before him and handed him a written
order to conduct the training required.
Captain Levy read the order, announced that he

understood it and further announced that he would not obey
it because of his medical ethics.
was, nonetheless, expected.

He was told that obedience

He persisted in his refusal.

It is interesting;, in a way, because his enlisted
subordinates offered to carry out the training for him and he
ordered them, using his rank as a captain, not to conduct the
training of these Special Forces AidMen and threatened them
with punishment if they disobeyed his order.
He, apparently, was determined that nobody was
going to receive any training in dermatology in that hospital
and he used his rank as an officer to carry out that
determination.
He continued to persist over a period of a month
or two to obey that order and, ultimately, disciplinary
action in the form of an Article 90 charge was levied against
him.
Now, Article 134 that we just heard, under which
he was also charged, proscribes, among other things, as I
said, all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good
order and discipline in the Armed Forces and all conduct of
a nature to bring discredit upon the Armed Forces.
The specification — and Article 133, as I've
mentioned, is the —- provides punishment for conduct
unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.

The specification

under Article 134 is set forth at pages 8 and 9 of our brief

6
and I shall merely mention some of the statements which he
made to enlisted men under his command and to others
apparently coming through the clinic.
The statements he made orally contained such
sentences as "I would refuse to go to Vietnam if ordered
to do so.
Vietnam.

I don’t see why any colored soldier would go to
They should refuse to go to Vietnam and, if sent,

should refuse to fight.

If I were a colored soldier, I would

refuse to go to Vietnam and if I were a colored soldier, and
I was sent, I would refuse to fight."
And then he referred, of course, to Special
Porces personnel as liars, thieves, killers of peasants,
murderers of women and children and so forth.
The specification of Article 133 is much the
same.

It involves the same — allegations of the same

remarks.
The evidence showed that during 1966, while he
was on duty in the dermatology clinic, on many occasions
Captain Levy made remarks of this nature.

He engaged in

conversations, many of them completely one-sided, with AidMen
undergoing training, with patients and visitors.

He did it

in the open, in the presence of enlisted men, of civilian
personnel and patients.
He was convicted under Articles 90, 133 and 13^
and sentenced as I have said.

7
He exhausted his appeals in the military.
Ultimately, after much litigation, he wound up with a
petition for habeas corpus in the United States District
Court for the middle district of Pennsylvania, which denied
his petition but the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
reversed, holding Articles 133 and 134 unconstitutionally
vague.
It also held, with one judge, Chief Judge Seitz,
dissenting, that the possibility of prejudice under Article
90 for the direct disobedience of a lawful order due to the
fact that trial had been held under two articles held
unconstitutional required that the Article 90 charge be
overturned and sent back for a new trial.
We brought this case here on appeal.
At the outset, I

should say that the Appellee's

brief raises some l4 numbered points and many of these are,
I suppose, offered as alternative grounds for affirmance
but these were points not addressed or decided by the Court
of Appeals for the Third Circuit and we suggest that the
proper way to handle this would be that, should the
Government prevail on its arguments on 133, 134 and 90,
that the proper course would be to remand this case to the
Court of Appeals for consideration of all these other points
which it did not consider or decide and a decision on those
issues.

i

8
So I will confine myself to the jurisdictional
objections raised here and to the argument about the Articles
themselves.
Captain Levy raises two jurisdictional objections.
The first one is that this is not properly an appeal to the
Supreme Court under 28 United States Code Section 1252.
I don’t — we've explained that in our brief.
don't think it requires extensive argument here.

I

The Court

noted that the jurisdictional question was deserved in noting
probable jurisdiction.
1252 says that "Any party may appeal to the
Supreme Court from an interlocutory or final judgment of any
Court of the United States holding an Act of Congress
unconstitutional."
And on its face, it provides for an appeal in this
kind of a case, a court of appeals as any court, an Act of
Congress has been held unconstitutional.
The revisor's notes indicate that this language
was deliberately chosen to allow appeals from any federal
court decision holding an Act of Congress invalid.
In addition to that, we rely upon the fact that
Rule 44 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure proscribes
a mechanism for notifying the Attorney General of Constitutional
questions arising in courts of appeals.

The purpose is to

allow the Attorney General to intervene if a Constitutional

9
question about a federal statute is raised so that he may,
then, take an appeal from any decision against the
Constitutionality of a federal statute.
So I think it is quite clear that vie are
properly here on an appeal.

I think it is also quite clear

that under 28 United States Code Section 2103 that if we are
not properly here by way of appeal, this should be treated
as a petition for certiorari, I mean, to go forward.
But there is one other or two other jurisdictional
points raised by Appellee.

The first one is that a

Government attorney filed the notice of appeal in the Third
Circuit Court of Appeals when that Government attorney was
not an attorney of record in this case.

I don't know why

that is any objection to the filing of the notice of
appeal.
This case was tried in the District Court in the
Middle District of Pennsylvania.

The Court of Appeals of the

Third Circuit is in the Bastern District and the Department
of Justice ordered the Assistant U.S. Attorney in the
Eastern District to file a notice ol • appeal in the Third
Circuit.

/

He vias acting as an agent of the Government and
I can't understand vihat is wrong with that filing of a notice
of appeal.
objection.

It seems to me to be an utterly frivolous

10

The other objection is that the — a person
certifying the service of the notice of appeal — the same
man who filed it — was not a member of the Bar of this
Court.
Wow, Rule 10 of this Court says that these
appeals are to be filed in the Court of Appeals in the
manner prescribed by Rule 33 of this Court — to the manner
prescribed.
The Court of Appeals covering the person who
must certify rules seem to — the Court of Appeals rules
cover the person who must certify, so I take it that Rule
33’s question as to persons does not apply to this case.
I don’t think there is any Jurisdictional
question.

I have really — I merely discussed it because

when it raised and the Court notes that it wants to hear
about it, I felt an obligation to talk about it.
Unless there is further reason to discuss it, I’d
sooner pass on to the merits.
We have here an Article 13^ argument which is
much the same as the argument in the Avrech case and I’d
like to recapitulate Just part of that, quite briefly.
As Mr. Justice White noted, it would be a little
hard to attack this statute facially, given the fact that as
to certain areas, there are deciding cases which say these
things fall within 13^-

So it would be hard to strike it

11

down facially on those grounds.
I want to suggest, also, that the Letter Carriers
case and Broadrlck against Oklahoma

certainly Indicate that

where the statute applies primarily to nonspeech activities,
facial invalidation may not be called for — is not called
for.
Finally, not only are vagueness and overbreadth
eliminated by the facts which we have already considered —
and I would suggest that it takes less than 30 days when one
enters

the military to perceive that one is in a neiv and

different culture — not only the limiting constructions,
the context, the military function, all of which is obvious
to anybody in it, indeed, the people outside it — I want to
repeat the fact which I think is crucial to this case and
that is, it would be impossible to write a detailed code of
conduct under 134 or the Article 133.
I have mentioned in the speech area the wide
variety — since we regulate all conduct in the military,
unlike the civilian world, where it is possible to say, make
a rifle shot statute and say you won’t do that.
We regulate all conduct in the military world.
We want affirmative action out of the military in a way
that we don’t out of the civilian population.
The military has a defined function.
goal.

Civilian society has no single goal.

It has a

12

For that reason, we regulate everything towards
a defined goal.

The goal tells us what conduct violates the

achievement of that goal.

The fact that everything is

regulated makes it impossible to write a detailed code.
We have to use words which men of common under­
standing can understand when they realize what kind of a
society they are living in and what its object is.
And I suggest, again, that there

are many areas

of life other than the military where we have found it either
impossible or not desirable to write a code.
We had, as I suggest, the Sherman Act.

We have

had some partial attempts to codify the Sherman Act and they
either turn out to be Toolman on Anti-trust Law, which does
not guide one to details,

e? they

turn out to be the Robinson-

Patmen Act and those codifications in themselves turn out to
be enormously vague.
So I think we are dealing in an area where it is
simply impossible to write the detailed code, the rifle shot
series of statutes that would cover every aspect of
allowable conduct in the military.
That being true, I think the kind of articles
we have here are inevitable and desirable.
Q

It is —

How about, just on the speech side,

Mr. Solicitor General, how much would the military lose if
13^ was construed or held or redrafted with a proviso,

13
provided this will never apply to speech.
MR. BORK:

Mr. Justice White, I think in that

case the military would
Q

immediately have to draft.

Well, I understand that, but how much would

you lose?
MR. BORK:

A great deal.

A great deal.

One

might not lose much in a conflict like World War II, although
one might.

I don't know.
Q

One certainly would —

You would have to then draft — do the best

you could in drafting kind of a detailed or a little bit more
descriptive statute as to what speech was proscribed.
MR. BORK:

Yes.

Well, I , frankly, I have tried
an
to think a little bit about what kind of/Article one would
draft and I, frankly, think it is impossible.

If it were

possible for strong legal minds.
Q

And,

of course, you don’t have to go that

far here, do you?
MR. BORK:
Q

I beg your pardon?

You don't have to — why do you have to meet

this issue the way you are talking about?

If it is so true

as you say it is that this conduct so clearly violated, was
core conduct within 13^, is that the end of your case or not?
MR. BORK:
Q

I am trying now to —

Or do you feel you have to meet an over­

breadth argument?

MR. BORK:

I have to meet an overbreadth

argument.
Q

Well, you've already met It, you said.

MR. BORK:

Perhaps I am, out of a desire to

point out that there are a variety of reasons to point out
why he can be met, I do wish to suggest that if over a period
of generations —
Q

Well, you must concede, though, Mr. Solicitor

General, as you did in the Avrech case, that there would be
a lot of conduct that would be charged under 134 that would
be held not to be covered by it?
MR. BORK:

Yes, I don't think that is very

common.
Q

Well, you've suggested some of those charges

were not sustained.
MR. BORK:

A number of them; I think about seven

of the total were not sustained.
Q

But, nevertheless, there are some that you

could never imagine to be covered by 134.
MR. BORK:
Q

In that list?

Well, there will be a lot of conduct you

wouldn't say is covered by 134.
MR. BORK:

That I would say is not covered by

134, yes.
Q

Or that anybody could suspect was covered

15
by it.
HR. BORK:

That is quite correct.

That is quite

correct.
No, no, 134 clearly does not reach, as we are
told by Appelles here, any conduct the military does not like.
It clearly does not reach that.
Q

No.

MR. BORK:

It clearly, also, is not a catchall.

It — 134 expresses the rationale of military discipline and
is confined to that.

It has nothing to do with conduct

somebody may not like or a catchall and so forth, but I, for
reasons which I cannot quite articulate, I still wish to
stress a point.
I mean, I cannot articulate the psychology that
impels me to continue to try to stress this point.
[Laughter.]
But I think it is crucial to say that all this
talk about oh, they could write specific articles that
covered all these things is not true.
If this Court, over a period of generations, has
struggled with what is "clear and present danger" and it is
"the gravity of the offense discounted by its improbability"
and so forth and that is the best that words can do — and I
suspect it is — then I — pardon me?
Q

Didn't we get rid of that?

16
MR. BORK:

Well, now we have incitement and other

formulas, but I suggest that if one is going to cover much
conduct, one is going to arrive at a form of worries which
mean something to a man of common understanding but which
you can play semantic games with and if you take it completely
out of context, completely out of function, and completely
out of the history of its use, yes, you can make it sound
vague.

I think that is what is being done here with 134.
Article 133 I think is really no different from

Article 134 except that it has a faintly quaint ring to it.
I think there is no doubt as to its meaning.
It applies, essentially, the same rationale as
does Article 134 but I suppose it stresses the fact that
officers are held to a higher level of conduct than are
enlisted men, and properly so.
This Article refers to the proper standard of
conduct of military officers and that, too, is not defined
by any common civilian understanding of what is gentlemanly
conduct.

It refers to the conduct expected of an officer

because of his military function and because misconduct by
an officer Is much more damaging to the military than
individual misconduct by an

enlisted man because he is the

symbol and he is perceived by more people than is the enlisted
man.

When he misbehaves, a great many people see it.
Q

Well, I suppose he is — you can make the

17
argument that this may be valid even if the other one is not
because the — as against the argument that 13*! applies to a
lot of people who are basically unwilling civilians who have
been drafted.

That would not generally be true about

officers, would it?
MR. BORK:

It appears to be true with Captain

Levy, Mr. Justice Stewart.

He was a very unwilling civilian

who was drafted.
Q

He was

MR. BORK:
Q

drafted?
He came in under the Berry Plan.

Oh, that’s that plan, yes.

MR. BORK:

He had his induction delayed so that

he might complete his medical education and residency.
Q

That’s

right.

MR. BORK:

But I think

Q

a generality,

It was

MR. BORK:
Q

I think —

I beg your pardon?

I think as a generality, there are more

officers there willingly than there are enlisted men.
MR. BORK:
true,

Oh, that’s quite true.

That's quite

I don’t think the reluctance of some of the enlisted

men to be in the military has any bearing upon —0.

No, but the argument is made that these are

basically unwilling civilians we are talking about, rather
than professional soldiers.

18

MR. BORK:
Q

Yes, this is true.

And times have changed since the early 19th

century when the Dynes case was decided.
MR. BORK:

I think that is true.

That may stress

the additional need for Article 13^, rather than to the
contrary.
Q

The historic roots of this 133 are — go back

to the British Articles of War of 1765 which provided for
discharge from the Service which I would supposed could be
arguably much more rational.

Officers do presume, or at

least in those days they did and, hopefully, they still do,
know what is expected of them as officers and if they
deviate from the conduct of an officer and a gentleman, they
should no longer be officers.
But that is quite different from making it a
criminal offense which it now is.
MR. BORK:
Q

I think the answer —

The historic roots were different.

I mean,

if you were on your — even if you cheated at polo for your
regimental team out in India, it might be conduct unbecoming
an officer and you might be cashiered out of the regiment
as an officer.
MR. BORK:
Q

That is quite true.

But to make that sort of thing a criminal

offense, it's kind of — I mean, this has come pretty far

19

from its roots, hasn’t it?
MR. DORK:

It has come pretty far from its

roots, as —
Q

It is now a criminal offense for which you

could be sent to prison.
MR. BORK:

That is quite true and I think that

reflects the difference between the British and the American
experience.

As I say, the wording in the British experience

probably meant that you would be cashiered from your
regiment —
Q

Umn hmn, drummed out of the regiment.

MR. BORK:

If you mentioned a lady’s name in the

mess.
Q

Exactly.

MR. BORK:

As it comes into the American

experience, it has — and adopted by the Continental Congress
which, I think, was not worried about cheating at polo or
mentioning a lady’s name in the mess, it has come to mean
the conduct, the standard of behavior expected of an officer
in light of the military function and context and in light
of his greater duties.
Q

And leadership responsibilities.

MR. BORK:

And leadership responsibilities.

And I think that it has different historic
roots, does not affect the fact that it has evolved Into a

20

well-understood standard of conduct in the American context.
Some of these statutes, I have been told, go back to Roman
times.

I don’t think that makes them less valid.
Q

Or worse, necessarily, yes.
You say that they, nowadays, at least, the

133 and 134 are basically the same except that 133 is
applicable exclusively to officers.
MR. BORK:

Is that right?

Yes, I think that that is correct;

133, I might say, is typically — not always, understand, but
typically charged in connection with another Article.
Q

133 is?

MR. BORK:
Q

Yes.

Umn hmn.

Now, in this case, you have

Article 90 and Article 133 and 134 and I think I heard you
say that, in this case, at least, the conduct thought to
violate Article 133 was the same conduct that was thought to
violate Article 134, don’t you

begin getting into double

jeopardy problems, when you make two offenses out of one, to
punish — convict somebody twice for one act?
MR. BORK:

I would doubt that in the ordinary

case, Mr. Justice Stewart, but it wasn't true in this case
because we had a single punishment for all three.
Q

You typically do, don’t you, in the military?

MR.

BORK:

Q

It’s a compulsory joinder, I think, is’t

Yes.

21
there?
MR. BORK:
Q

Yes, but I don't —

Of all charges, even unrelated ones, isn't

there?
MR. BORK:

For trial.

I am not — I am not clear

that there has to be a single punishment ordered, that they
couldn't divide the punishments, but I am not clear about that
and if I am wrong —
Q

What was here?

MR. BORK:

They had a single punishment for all

charges.
Q

Then that makes it even worse, you can't tell,

can you?
MR. BORK:

Well, I think the common rule, as we

have cited in our brief, is that, if you are convicted under
one valid charge and your sentence is less than the maximum
for that charge, it is upheld even though the conviction
under two other charges is overturned.
Q

Well, sometimes it is.

Q

But the Courts of Appeals, and as I read

your brief, Mr. Solicitor General, you don't quarrel with it,
held here that they wouldn't apply the general rule that if
any one of the charges is sustained, then it is irrelevant
that the other two may be upset if a single sentence has
been imposed.

22
MR. BORK:

Mr. Justice Brennan, I'm —

Q

You do quarrel with it?

Q

And may

wind up here, in any case,

"peculiarities associated with a sentence imposed by a
military court, render this case appropriate for discretionary
refusal to apply the clause in the general sentence rule."
Do you agree with that?
MR. BORK:

No, your Honor, I certainly didn’t

intend to agree with that.
Q

Well, I just wondered if you are right on

Section 90, then why do we have to get into 133 and 134?
MR. BORK:

Only because the — well, you don’t

necessarily have to get into 133 and 134 if the Section 90
charge is upheld and the only challenge to it here — I’m
sorry, there are many challenges — the only challenge in the
Court of

Appeals was that evidence that came in under the

other charges might have prejudiced it.
Q

But let’s assume we sustained the Section 90

charges independently?
MR. BORK:

Then, need this Court reach the 134

and 133 charges?
No, it need not.
Q

Well, that is what you say you

needn't,

but the Court of Appeals said you had to even if the 90
charge was good.

23
Q

Right.

MR. BORK:

Well, that is because they reviewed —

the evidence, they think prejudices the 90 charge.
Q

No.

Q

No, he reverts to — he would not follow the

Clausson rule.
MR. BORK:

I understand that.

I understand that.

I was trying to — I was suggesting that we are not to follow
that rule.
,

Q

Well, what I am asking you, if we do sustain

the 90 conviction, we are going to have to address what the
Court of Appeals did in refusing, for that reason, not to
reach the 133 and 13^.
MR. BORK:

You'll have to address the question

of whether — that's right, whether the rule applies.
Q

That's right but have you briefed that?

MR. BORK:

I think we did.

Q

Yes, at the end of your brief.

Q

If Judge Sietz had written the majority

opinion in the Court of Appeals,

he wouldn't have had to get

to any Constitutional question, would he, if he had had
another judge with him?
MR. BORK:
Q

That is right, he would not have.

Page 47 of your brief.

MR. BORK:

If he had upheld the Article 90

24
conviction and the Clausson rule, he would not have had to
reach 134 and 133.
On the other hand, unless there is a jurisdic­
tional problem with the Avrech case, 134 is before the
Court, anyway.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, if we were to send

the case back, as has been suggested, on Article 90 in view
of the joinder with 133 and 134, would it be appropriate for
the Court of Appeals to reexamine only the sentence?
In other words, these three charges were
tried together and there was only one sentence.

As I under­

stand the briefing in this case, there really isn’t any
dispute as to the failure to obey the order.
MR. BORK:
Q

There is not.

So if it there had been a trial only on

90, certain defenses were raised but they did not go to the
issue of whether or not the order was disobeyed.
So my question is, whether, if the case were
remanded to the Court of Appeals, there would have to be a
further remand to a court-martial for retrial on the merits
or whether you think only the sentence need be reexamined?
MR. BORK:

The Court of Appeals, if one sent the

Article 90 charge back, well, it depends — if you upheld the
134 and 133 convictions, nothing would happen.
struck those down

If you

25
Q

No, let's assume we disagreed with the

Government on 133 and 134.

MR. BORK:

Then you would have to disagree with

the Court of Appeals on the application of the Clausson rule,
too, and tell the Court of Appeals — well, if you agreed
with the court in the application of the Clausson rule, the
Article 90 charge would have to go back for retrial in a
court-martial.
If you disagreed with the Court of Appeals
over the Clausson rule, the Article 90 conviction could

Well, my difficulty, Mr. Solicitor General,

is reading your brief at the top of 48.
you address the

Garson

I don't see that

question, rather you — "We submit,

however, that even if 133 and 134 were held unconstitutional,"
which means you want us to address the question of the
constitutionality of 133 and 134, and my suggestion is that,
if the Gagson rule were applicable here and we were to sustain
the Article 90 conviction, we don't have to reach the
constitutionality of this example.

MR. BORK:

I quite agree with that.

26
Q

But we will have to say that the Court of

Appeals was wrong in tninking this was the case in which it
could exercise its discretion and refuse to apply the Carson
rule.

*1

MR. BORK:

I agree with that'.

I think I have sufficiently discussed the facial
invalidation question in terms of the Letter Carriers case,
the impossibility of drafting a code, the fact that 133, like
134, is given meaning by the military function and context
and, indeed, here Captain Levy was warned with and argued
with concerning his behavior and part of the 133 charge was
that he not only disobeyed sin order which was an Article 90
charge, but went back to the enlisted men and announced to
them he had disobeyed an order and would not obey it, which
was a 133 charge.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Morgan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES MORGAN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
mr.

MORGAN:

Ifr. Chief Justice, and.may it

Please the Court:
I think first, we should go to the problem which
developed in Orloft versus Willoughby, which is, as the
Government noted there, the Supreme Court did, that the
parties In this Court changed their position "as nimbly as
if dancing a quadrille."

27
In this particular case and in

light of the

fact that we were just discussing the Article 90 charge, I
think it is appropriate to go to the record in the case where
the prosecutes states in the record that the "Order charge is
directly related to and —" this is a quote — "directly
related to and intertwined with the factual bases for the
other charges."
Now, what the prosecutor did In the trial was to
take the additional ti'/o charges we had that were dismissed
and he used those two charges, plus these two pure speech
charges, and used those charges from the opening statement
to the closing argument to demonstrate Levy's opposition to
the war, which xvent to the question of intent and willfulness
on the disobedience of the order.
It so limited the defense In the presentation
of its case that the Court of Appeals considering that
question and, incidentally, all questions relating to the
order charge were submitted to the Court of Appeals and those
were before the Court of Appeals, as they were before the
District Court, and as we advised the Solicitor General in
Motion to Dismiss or Affirm, they would be presented by us
because they are Implicit in his request that the conviction
under Article 90 be affirmed.
Now, that is first.
Q

Well, the place where you get convictions

28

under Article 90 affirmed or reversed is in the Court of
Military Appeals.

This is an habeas corpus giving a civil,

a federal district court very, very limited jurisdiction, not
to review the trial errors.

This is purely a jurisdictional

attack, isn't it?
This is not a matter of affirming or reversing
an Article 90 conviction.

That is the function of the

Court of Military Appeals, isn't it?
MR. MORGAN:

It is a question of affirming or

reversing the Court of Appeals, of course.
Q

Right, and this is a civil action.

This is

federal habeas corpus.
MR. MORGAN:
Q

Surely.

And a good deal of what is in your brief, I

suggest, is just not open to a federal district court or a
federal court of appeals under the system of military justice,
as it has been developed in this country.
MR. MORGAN:

Well, I suggest that it not only is,

but it necessarily has to be.

Let me give you an example.

Under the order charge at court-martial,
Dr. Levy contended that the reason that he couldn't obey the
order, and there is no evidence contrary to this, absolutely
none, the Colonel said that Levy said, "I decline the order.'1
What were the grounds?

Ethical.

And Levy, a physician — this isn't a fella just

Carolina refusing to train medical personnel.
everybody.

He trained doctors.

He trained

He trained all medical

personnel except one bunch and they were combat troops and
he said he had an ethical right not to train them and the
lav; officer wouldn't allow that as a defense and then we
get to Wnelchel versus McDonald,, which divests them of
jurisdiction and beyond that, Levy also says, he says, "I
will not train special forces because, A) —11 and I think
we should go to Hoe versus Wade and Doe versus Bolton and
the abortion cases and I think —
Q

Now, those aren't three cases.

They are two,

Roe against Wade and Doe against Bolton are the abortion
cases.
MR. MORGAN:
Q

That's right.

The abortion —

Not "And the abortion cases."

MR. MORGAN:

The abortion cases with respect to

the question of medical ethics because it appears to me
from those cases that no one can be ordered, for instance,
even though abortions are now legal and constitutional, no
one can be ordered to perform an abortion and all Levy says,
he comes into the Army, as the Solicitor General pointed out,
under the doctors' draft.

All doctors are drafted, 100

percent of them, almost, in the United States.

They even

He has no previous military training.
The argument and the briefs which talk about
previous military training are just out of the blue.

recall it — or 9th.

He is given 16 hours of military training

of time, it may have gone to 26 hours, he almost shoots the
sergeant teaching him how to shoot the pistol and beyond
tnat, there is just absolutely no evidence of any notice or
anything else, but here is Levy in the dermatology clinic.
And sent to him are people who he discovers
over a period of time, are, as he states, "Killers of
women and children, murderers of peasants."

political and military purposes"and it is undisputed
because the colonel who set up the program said, "That is
exactly what they are doing."

He thought it did more good

than bad and throughout the record, that is the case.

clinic and as he did, he learned what they did and what they
were doing with medicine and what they were trained to do.
You see, unlike Dr. Levy, who didn't go to Port
Sam Houston for military training, you know, when he got in
the service, Special Forces started there, then the Aid Men
came up and they came next to Fort Jackson, then from Fort
Jackson they went to Fort Bragg, where, finally, they
operated on a dog and then they went out in the field.
Now, Dr. Levy knew all that by the time he
disobeyed the order and he knew that his ethical obligation
was not to train other than medical personnel in medicine,
that is, combat troops, and, secondly, not to train people
who would misuse the medicine that they were given, to use it
for political or the kind of purposes —■ and that is pretty
clear that that is an ethical concern.
The problem with the Army is, they don't
recognize medical ethics including the privilege that

What specific part of the Hippocratic Oath

is it that you rely on?
MR. MORGAN:

The Hippocratic Oath?

I think we

set it forth at page 55 — as I recall in my brief —
Q

55?

MR. MORGAN:
Q

I think so, your Honor.

I didn't mark it when I —

36

MR. MORGAN;

Yes, page 55 and on 56 we set up a

specific part;
"I swear that, according to my ability and
judgment I will keep this stipulation, that by precept,
lecture and every other mode of instruction, I will impart a
knowledge of the art to disciples bound by stipulation of —
according to the lav; of medicine but to no others.

Whatever

I may see or hear in the lives of men — abroad, I will not
divulge as reckoning that all such should be kept secret."
And the very training, the nature of the training
was that these fellas just walked into the clinic and stared
down at his patients and watched him treat patients in the
most personal situations and that included women.
Q

Would you say, then, that paramedical people

and their increasing use these days, is contrary to the
Hippocratic Oath?
MR. MORGAN:

No, the use of paramedical people

is fine, as long as they are subject to medical supervision
but these people were, A) not subject to medical supervision
and B) didn't use paramedical treatment for paramedical
purposes or for even a primary purpose.

They used it for

and convicted, as you well know, for conduct unbecoming an

folks heard him.

Now, he is in private.

All of the arguments about

the Army and writing statutes and this sort of thing, that
would be fine if the military was willing to give up what it
has got.

And what has it got?
It has got for its people the right to run for

political

office.
Now, when you turn — when you start talking about

statutes, I want to mention two things.

First, if it is too

39

difficult to write, then it is too difficult for a serviceman
to understand if it is not written and the second thing is,
at Army Regulation 600-20, paragraph 42, it says that
"Servicemen have a right to express their opinion privately
and informally on all political subjects and candidates and
to become candidates for public office."
Now, what the Army presently has — Mr. Chief
Justice Burger, you were asking about

debating societies.

It looks to me like under this Army regulation you can have
folks in the same company going out and running against each
other.
Now, I think if you are going to regulate
speech, you got to — you can't have your cake and eat it
too, in the Army, and that is what they got now.
Q

Now, as I follow his application of the

Hippocratic Oath, he is taking the position as a doctor that
it is better for the people out in the countryside to have
no medical assistance at all than to have medical assistance
of paramedical people that he would train.
Is that right?
MR. MORGAN:

Is that about it?

Not really.

That is only a part of

it and, of course, that is a medical question as far as
whether it is better or worse, like if you gave everybody a
penicillin shot, would the world be better off or not?
some doctors argue either way.

And

40

In this case, we brought forward the following
witnesses:

Jean Mayer, Dr. Side!, Reter Bourne of the

Army — Walter Reed Institute of Research and they came
forward, these physicians, and they said, this is an
appropriate ethical concern.
They said, we recognize this and physicians who
were in the Army said if they had Levy's factual knowledge,
if what he knew was true, Dr. Maurer and others, they would
not give training.
Now, the concern was not just as to how the
treatment came in the field.

For instance, Dr. Bourne came

to a different conclusion on ethical concern.

He thought it

went the other way, you know, as far as he personally was
concerned.
But the question was, may the physician, for a
valid ethical concern, regardless — as with most ethics,
is it right or wrong is another question and Levy's position
primarily was not that the people out in the field were
worse off or better off with medicine.

Levy's position was

that they were military personnel using medicine for military
and political purposes and that B) we'd never know whether
they were better off with or without it and throughout the
record, it is right interesting to go back and see what
Special Forces have testified about the quality of medical
care out there in the field.

41

They are saying they go in and they

use words

like ponucks, witch doctor and acupuncturists, doctors with
needles.
Now, I am not so sure that those folks were
worse off before they got there or better off.
Q

Now —

Well, the question really comes down to

whether that is a judgment that subordinate officers in the
military are free to make.

Isn't that what this case

comes to?
MR. MORGAN:

As to whether doctors who ?.re

subordinate officers in the military are free to make, yes,
and there is no question that you can't do that to a
chaplain.

There is no question that there is an attorney-

client privilege in the military.

But there is no physician

patient privilege recognized and doctors are different in,
you know, the nature of the work is different.
Now, I want to mention this to you.

As far as

conduct unbecoming an officer or a gentleman is concerned,
there was a case in 1827 in which a court-martial decided
that the conduct of an admiral — the first Jewish commodore
rather, in the Navy, Admiral Commodore Eureilly, they
decided then that the conduct of a duel over honor was
conduct unbecoming an officer but not that of a gentleman.
Nov;, I submit to you that even on the face of
the statutes, if you take its words at fair meaning, conduct

42

unbecoming an officer can also be, sometimes, itself, conduct
becoming a gentleman, and that the statute and its very words
are mutually inconsistent and that in this case, for instance,
that they charged Dr. Levy's conduct of not allowing Special
Forces to walk in and stare at his women patients, that under
that circumstance, lots of us would have considered the
conduct would have been

appropriate with respect to a

gentleman, but not an officer.
With respect to 134 and 133, there is no question
in this record but that Dr. Levy did not have the notice that
the Appellant's case is based on.

He came into the Service.

He didn't get the training other Army doctors get.

They brought him in and

GiiniCo

Throughout the case, there was no — there is not
an iota of evidence that Levy knew what was prohibited or
what wasn't prohibited under 133 or 134.
Nov;, beyond that, the Army regulation says that
he may express his opinion"privately and informally on all
political subjects and candidates and to become candidates
for public office."
Where did he express his opinion?

he did it in

his office.
Nov;, what was Levy doing in his spare time?

went out and participated in voter registration campaigns
and civil rights work in civilian clothes off post off base.
And we have been attempting, as civilian counsel,
with a clearance for top secret in another military case, to
get our hands on the very G-2 dossier that the Colonel tes­
tified he upgraded the charges after reading.
lie based the upgrading of charges from an
Article 15 to a general court-martial after he read the
G-2 dossier.

They gave us 80 pages.

They gave our military

counsel 180 pages and said he couldn’t tell me what was in it.
And we know now because they wrote the district
court that 25 pages came from nonArmy sources and they had
the release on that and everything down the line but the
very charges, Colonel Fancy testified, v/ere based upon the
G-2 dossier and his reading of it and he upgraded it on that
basis,
Now, with respect to Broadrick

and with respect

to Letter Carriers, it seems to me that Levy complies com­
pletely with the requirements of that case and that this
case is quite appropriate for judgment.
In Broadrick and in Letter Carriers, you have a
statute which goes to political activity and, in effect, to
political speech.
In this case, you have a statute which goes to
everything and does so by its nature and because that is

44
what the Service wanted.
We can stand up here and talk about defining and
doing this and that, but the very purpose for 133 and 134 is
a catchall, a Catch-22.
They say that the purpose of it is to get all
sorts of conduct.

To talk about defining, that is not what

tlie military wants with it.

Not only does it not want — it

doesn’t want to tell you about political speech, it wants to
keept its political speech under its regulations and it wants
to keep the right for its people to run for office.
Now, Letter Carriers didn't do that.

Broadrick

didn’t do that and neither of those two cases say in the least
anything which in any way inhibits the right of Dr. Levy to
strike down these two statutes on

behalf of himself, not on

behalf of some conduct for someone else.
Now, I want to — words are harsh that Dr. Levy
used, not so harsh in retrospect as they were back then.

ever, basic training.

He

He hadn’t been through,

He was at Fort Jackson, South

Carolina in a dermatology clinic.

He didn't want to be there

but he was there and he was a good doctor.

The record has

not a question about that.
Q

Where did he have his residency?

MR. MORGAN;
I recall it.

At N.Y.U. and. then in Bellevue, as

Or downstate, I -— I'm not quite sure what

45
the word means, but it is in New York City.
The prosecutor never took the position, we've all
noticed, at the trial.

If you'll go to page 2497 of the

record, the prosecutor says, "Of course, the Government's
position is like any law, the provisions of the Uniform
Code are without specific notification binding on any
individual in the military service."
It is only when we get here that the quadrille is
danced.
Nov;, I *— the case presents many questions but
the one thing that the case does not present is a doctor who
refused to train medical personnel.
The one thing that the case does not present is
a circumstance wherein a person was convicted, wherein a
person was convicted for anything other than his political
beliefs and beliefs that were thrust upon him and charged
against him by Colonel Henry Franklin Fancy.
X

have an extract in the record as to what

disloyalty means and what disaffection means in the brief.
Perhaps that will demonstrate appropriately the tremendous
confusion that can occur with the use of words that nobody
knows the meaning of.
But I know the meaning of a three-year sentence
which he received and the meaning of that sentence was that
these officers, with no standard for judgment and a prosecutor
with no standard for judgment, and a Colonel who testified on

46

the basis of an undisclosed dossier, he was charging this
fella with being disloyal, that they took those charges and
catapulted them up and the only thing that was conduct
unbecoming an officer or a gentleman in the entire case and
the only discredit that came to the Service was the courtmartial process and the fact that it occurred.
It seemed to me that the officer who testified,
David Travis, at that time perhaps the most-decorated
American in Vietnam, combat soldier, who said, "Sure, I’ve
been at Fort Jackson —" he was black — "and I've been with
Dr. Levy and he's talked to me and I’ve disagreed with him."
But he said, "That is what I am in Vietnam fighting for, is
free expression."
And I asked him, "Where do you go from here?"
And he said, "Back to Vietnam."
I submit to you that that is really what this
case is all about, the right of a person to express themselves
freely in private, to practice medicine and to give the
military their very best, even if they don't want to.
And maybe those problems will go away, now that
we have come to the position that we don't have a drafted
military service but a voluntary military service and, perhaps,
I don't know, that will result in some military men, when they
enter in the service, giving up some of those rights of
civilians.

47
If it does and they are going to write a statute,
they better get away from saying military men can run for
office and discuss privately any political matters that
come to their minds.
Thank you.
