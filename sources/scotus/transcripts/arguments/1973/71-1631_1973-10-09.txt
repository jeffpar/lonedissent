PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 71-1631, Stanley T. Kusper, Jr., et al., against
Harriet G„ Pontikes, et al.
Mr. Mitchell, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALDUS S. MITCHELL, ESQ.
OK BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. MITCHELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
'I represent the Board of Election Commissioners of
the City of Chicago.
Our case is here on appeal from a decision and
judgment of a three-judge District Court in the Northern
District of Illinois, finding a section of the Illinois
Election Code unconstitutional.
The section that's involved is Chapter 46, Section
7~43(d) of the Illinois Revised Statutes.

That section provides

that there can be changes in participation in political party
primaries only if 23 months has elapsed since the time that the
voter has last participated in a primary election.
I think it is important here that this Court under­
stand that the territory of the Board of Elections Commissioners
of the City of Chicago encompasses the City of Chicago and
four suburban towns at the time that this case came to the
court.

4
Those towns were the towns of Berwyn, Cicero,
Stickney end Lyons.
In addition, the City of Chicago Is divided into
fifty wards and in the fifty wards and the four suburban towns
there are approximately 3,500 precincts.
What we have in this case, is a single voter from
the 36th Precinct of the fiftieth ward in the City of Chicago
who brought an action claiming that Section 7-43(d) of the
Illinois Election Code deprived her of the right to participate
in the primary election to be held
She filed

a

on

March 21, 1972.

complaint, asking that Section 7-43

be declared unconstitutional.

In that complaint, she alleged

that she had voted in the Republican Primary in 1971, the
Republican Party Primary for the Chicago Municipal Officers,
that there was Section 7-43(d) of the Code that prohibited
her from voting in the March 21, 1972, Democratic Party Primaryelection, and she asked the court to find that that section
deprived her of rights guaranteed and protected by the
Constitution of the United States.
I think that this case presents two basic problems,
two basic differences, between the plaintiff, the appellants
here, and the defendants who are appellants here, and the
plaintiffs, and that is whether or not the courts, the Federal
Court system, has a right in every claim made by a voter to
take jurisdiction and to decide that question, or whether or

r>
not the Federal Courts are limited by the terms of the
Constitution of the United States, particularly the Tenth
Amendment, to those situations in which there is a demonstratec
interference with a right that is granted by some other
section of the Constitution,
I don't think that there is any question here that
there is a right to vote, but in the case that is before the
Court, the claim that there was a denial by any section of the
Illinois Election Code, is erroneous.
What Mrs. Fontikes complains about is that she is not
permitted to participate in primary elections as she sees fit.
The State of Illinois has seen fit to set up regu­
lations which, in their effect, are to protect the integrity of
political parties, and it is not just the integrity of the
Democratic and Republican parties, but it is designed to
protect the integrity of any political group which comes
together and asserts itself under the terms of the Election
Code,
The complaint that Mrs. Fontikes brought, we believe,
was insufficient to warrant the District Court, in undertaking
to hear and decide the case, to bear on its face-- the most tha
she says is that she desires to participate in an election,
a Democratic Party Primary Election, and that the section of
the statute involved here would prevent her doing so*
I think that a look at the statute discloses that that

o
just is not true.
Q

Mr. Mitchell, Judge Marovits who was with you on the

merits below, disagreed with you on your procedural point
here, didn't he, and agreed with the majority of the District
Court?
MR, MITCHELL;

Yes, Mr. Justice, but we take the

position that Judge Marovifcs was wrong on the procedure.
This was a case that should never --in which a three-judge
t

court should never have been convoked, because the complaint,
on its face, was insufficient to state a claim upon relief
could be granted in the District Court.
There is certainly no claim here of any discrimination
by the Illinois Election Code between the plaintiff and any
other citisen in the State of Illinois, and there is no claim
that there is any denial of due process as might have been
involved in Williams v. Rhodes.

It is just the flat assertion

that she will not be permitted to participate in the Democratic
Party primary in 1972, that's a statewide election, because she
had participated in the primary election for the Republican
Party for municipal officers in the prior year — within
twenty-three months of the election that was to be held on
March 21, 1972.
I think that there were a series of problems that
were overlooked by the judge to whom the case was originally
assigned.

7
Even if you get past the hurdle of whether or not the
complaint states a claim upon which relief may be granted, 1
think, you run head-on into the question of whether or not it
is a case that ought to be heard by the Court,
In Illinois, there had been an interpretation, a
construction of the statute involved, in gaherfcy v. The Board
of Election Commissioners., in which the Illinois court had
decided that participation in a statewide primary would
determine how you could participate ~.r the party’s primary,
that you could participate in is at the municipal officers
level.
Now, I think that in the opinion of the District
Court, they mentioned

that they did not believe that the

Constitution required, or permitted, that these people
that citiaens, voters, be locked into a particular political
party at every level of Government, or at every level of
politics.
We do not argue —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there

after lunch.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o’clock, noon, oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was recessed, to reconvene at
1:00 o'clock, p.m., the same day.)

s
AFTERNOON SESSIOM
(1:00 p.ra.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Mitchell, you may

continue,
MR. MITCHELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and raay it please

the Court:
I think as «e broke, I was speaking to the question
of the complaint which had been filed by Mrs. Pon tikes in
the case at bar.
I had just suggested that she had not made any
allegations in that complaint indicating that she claimed any
denial of equal protection, nor had she made any claim that the
statute denied her due process of a sort that the Court had
spoken to in Williams v, Rhodes.
I think that these — the fact that these allegations
were not made raised serious question as to Iter standing to
maintain the action.
I think that the Court for quite a long time and,
more recently, in Jenkins v, McKeifchen had decided that unless
the person bringing the lawsuit could indicate in some fashion
that they were going to be harmed and damaged in some way
differently from the way in which the other members of the
community would be harmed by the statute, that they had no
right to maintain the lawsuit.
I think that all of these are questions that were

9
it* the busooi of the judge to whom the case was originally
assigned in the District Court, at the time that a motion was
made to convene the three-judge court pursuant to the statute,
I think that the District Judge, at that point, did not carry
out his responsibility under the laws, the rules and the law,

by searching this complaint and deciding all of these questions
before convoking that three-judge court -- before asking the
chief judge of the Seventh Circuit to convoke that three-judge
court,
Q

The complaint seems to mention only the alleged right

of « right to be free from an invasion privacy, allegedly
protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, is that
right?
MR* MITCHELL:

I think that — well, they allude to

the First and Fourteenth Amendments -Q

That's all, isn't it?

The right to be free from an

invasion of privacy protected -» allegedly protected by the
First and Fourteenth Amendments,

That's all there is in the

complaint, isn’t there, so far as the Federal Constitution goes?
MR. MITCHELL:
Q

That's correct.

But you only raise one question on your question

presented.
ME. MITCHELL:
Q

I don't understand.

You only raised one question on your question

presented, and I don't see it any place in there.

This point

10
you are now making.
MR. MITCHELL:

Well, I think that we have raised this

in the section of the brief where we suggest that the —
Q

What about your question presented on page 3 of

your jurisdictional statement?
MR. MITCHELL:

Weil, I think that this is necessarily

included in the questions that we presented in the jurisdic­
tional statement.
Q

And I think that the rules provide —

You keep saying questions.
MR. MITCHELL:

It was one.

But, I think that the jurisdictional

questions, or questions that were necessarily included in
any question that is presented in this Court -- if there was
no jurisdiction, I think that this Court has determined that
it has a right to look at that question, and to decide that
question, no matter what other questions might have been
raised by the parties.
Q

Well, I would submit that in the future if you had

those it would be better if you raised them -MR. MITCHELL:
Q

Specifically.
MR. MITCHELL:

Q

I will take note of that —*

And do that, Mr. Justice Marshall.

You did set them out on page 4 of your brief, as I

recall.
MITCHELL:

On page 4, we did set out the questions,

but we thought that those were necessarily included in the

11
questions that we had set out in the jurisdictional statement*
The -- I think that once the question of the threejudge court had been presented to the District judge, and the
court had been convened, that there were two questions that
faced both the District judge before the court was convened
and the court at the time it was sitting, and that was whether
or not this was a -- the sort of question that the «Statute
2281 had considered to be within the jurisdiction of the threejudge court, whether or not this was a local question which
should be decided by a single judge. And if that question was
answered in the affirmative, i-e«, that it was a local matter,
the three-judge court should have returned the matter to a
single judge.
In this case, we have a single individual who is
a resident of one precinct out of some 3,500 precincts within
the jurisdiction of the Board, who claims to be affected by a
statute which, on its face, seems to shoxs that there are some
areas in the State of Illinois which will not be affected by
the terns of that statute.
The jurisdiction of the Board of Elections Commission­
ers in this case, is limited to the City of Chicago.

The

other areas in the County of Cook do not have the Republican
and Democratic Parties presenting candidates for election
for municipal offices.

And x*?e suggest that, in that circumstanc

that this is the local situation that is not included within the

12
jurisdiction of the statutory three-judge court.
But, I think, even more important, even if there is
jurisdiction,

I

think the Court faces a further problem and

that is the question of whether or not the Court should hear
and decide the particular case that it is presented with.
We would suggest here that in the light of the fact
that the Illinois Supreme Court had not considered this
statute onthe factual situation
case, that

that was presented in this

this was a proper case for the Court not to con­

strue that statute, but to allow the Illinois courts to con­
strue it.
The Illinois Court: had considered the case -~
considered

the statute -- in the case of Faherty v. The Board

of Election Commissioners of

the City of Chicago

in deterrain-

ing whether or not participation at the statewide primary level
would determine the political party primary that a voter could
participate in in the municipal officers primary.

They had

decided that it did.
We suggest that that decision does not -• is not a
decision, or an indication, that it would decide the obverse
of that question, that is, the question of whether or not
participation in a municipal primary, which Mrs, Pontikes
alleged here, also prevents a change in political party
primary when the statewide primary is being held, that these
are questions that should be left to the Illinois courts.

13

I think that the Court has, in numerous cases,
decided that where a statute is capable of a construction
which would prevent the statute from being determined to be
unconstitutional, that the presumption should be that it will
be construed in that fashion and the courts that were primarily
concerned with statutory construction should be allowed to
construe the statute.

It was not done in this case though

there is a ready means of that in the State of Illinois because
there is a declaratory judgment statute, and the Illinois
Supreme Court has decided that election matters, or matters
which can be determined under that declaratory judgment action
-- declaratory judgment statute -- and under that statute,
declaratory judgment matters were given preference over other
matters that are pending in the courts.
So that this could have been quite rapidly done,
probably in time for a decision to have been made on the
construction to be given to that statute before the election,
in all probability in time for the Federal court to have
considered the matter if the plaintiff felt that the con­
struction was erroneous and left open the question of whether
or not the statute was constitutionally deficient.
We think that in these circumstances the Court should
have abstained and the matter should be returned to the Illinois
court, so that they might consider the statute rather than
having to live with an interpretation by a Federal court which

14
is not used to dealing with the vagaries of the Illinois
£lection Code.
The statute here is a part of an integrated scheme

for carrying on elections and there are numerous other aspects
of the Election Code that are affected by a decision that
Section 7-43(d) of the Illinois Election Code is unconstifcutiona]
We have the matter of determining who will participate
in the election as election judges, who can be canvassers,
who can sign nominating petitions, and that sort of thing.
With no provision for identifying these people, of course, we
are left open with the -- with no means of identifying them,
other than what they say, and the Code does not provide for
any affidavit of identity, as some States seem to provide for.
Q

Mr* Mitchell, as X understand it, the Illinois courts

have held that this statute :Ls applicable to somebody who has
voted in a one party primary in a State primary, and now wants
to vote in a different party primary in a municipal election,
but you tell us, I think, that the Illinois courts have not
decided the opposite side of the coin, which is presented here,
and that —»
MR. MITCHELL:
Q

That's correct.

-- at least arguably, the Illinois courts might

decide that this statute is not applicable to the situation
that this plaintiff found herself in.
MR. MITCHELL:

Is that right?

Well, the courts could decide that it

15
was applicable on

both on the statewide level, 23 months,

on the municipal level for 23 months, and there would be no
cross effect between them.
Q

Well, your courts have already decided there is a

cross effect when you go from State to municipal, has it not
--or did I misunderstand it?
MR. MITCHELL:
Q

They have decided that.

They haven’t decided whether there is a cross effect

when you go from municipal to State?
MR. MITCHELL:

That’s correct.

But we have also

the problem, I think, that this statute and this case points
up, and that is that there are just a few areas in Illinois
that would be affected by this statute.

And the Court, looking

at it today, might well decide that it -- that the effect is
not as you have raised the question that it might be, because
it would be a denial of Equal Protection to some of the citizens
in the State of Illinois.
Q

You mean —
MR, MITCHELL:

I don’t know what the Illinois courts

would do, but I think that it is a question that should be
left to the Illinois courts, in view of the fact that Illinois
is mandated by the Constitution to carry on elections.
I think it is mandated to protect the rights of
citizens who participate in that election, and this Court has
indicated that the Federal courts have the — have jurisdiction

16
to considet whether the States’ procedure for carrying on
elections pass Constitutional muster.
1 think» too «*«
Q

What would be your position on the merits in the

State court or in this Court as to whether it is a denial of
Equal Protection?
MR. MITCHELL:

Well, I thick that it raises serious

questions where some parts of the State of Illinois have to
live with the effect of a statute like this and other areas
don't, just because the major political parties decide to
put forth candidates in some cities and not in others.
How, I am not sure what my position would be.

It

would depend, I think, to be quite candid, the aide that I was
on.

I would be an advocate — at this point, we would make an

effort to defend the statute as it stands.
Q

As a statewide application?
MR. MITCHELL:

Ho, as to the application in the

various cities where the major parties present candidates.
Q
the State.

In other words,limited application to sections of
Is that the position the State takes?

That the

statute is of limited application to sections of the State?
MR. MITCHELL:
Q

It is.

And your argument, then, is that not being of state­

wide application, it is not a case for a three-judge court?
MR. MITCHELL:

That is correct.

There are only ten

17
Boards of Elections Commissioners
Q

If in some manner we reach the merits here, or if

it were referred to a State court and you had to take a
position on the merits, would you find it difficult — would
the State find it difficult to defend this statute as its
written, or not?
MR. MITCHELL:
defending the statute.

I would find it difficult in
I think that I x*ould have to urge

that the application is on two levels, one on the statewide
level and another on the municipal level, because of the
fact that all of the political parties don't put forth
candidates at both levels.
Q

At the municipal level -■*

Would you try to defend it if, in fact, it is to be

read as having limited application only to certain sections of
the State, this 23-months requirement; would you try to defend
that against an Equal Protection challenge?
MR. MITCHELL:

Ho, sir.

I think that the court below has in considering the
constitutionally of the statute, has, in effect, just sub­
stituted its judgment for that of the Legislature of the State
of Illinois.

I think that this is in violation of the

Constitution, particularly the Tenth Amendment, which gives to
the State the right to carry on its affairs in any fashion that
it sees fit, so long as it does not deny to the people the
rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.

18

The election process9 I think, on the basis of past
cases, is suspect where there are classifications which this
Court has described as being invidious, and I think that most
of these have been on racial basis, or geographical basis, or
wealth or age, or sex, I think, most recently.
There is none of this involved in this case.

The

only questionis whether or not, If we get to the question of
the constitutionality of the statute, is whether the 23 months
that the State of Illinois feels is a proper time for persons
to be identified with a political party before you are allowed
to participate in the affairs — participate in the primary
cf that party, is too long,
I think that the State of Illinois baa decided that,
in their judgment, it is necessary to have this length of time
or some length of time, and the 23 months becomes a convenient
time. In view of the fact we only have elections approximately
every 23 months, as a usual matter, at the State level, that
this is a reasonable length of time to protect the identity ami
integrity of these political parties.
I think that this Court, in prior cases, has
determined that protection of political parties is a matter of
legitimate State concern, and has approved means of protecting
those parties.
I think that there is nothing in the Constitution of
the United States which would suggest that the 23 months is too

19
long, where the only effect of that 23 months would be that
the participation in some hi-eiecfcion might be affected by that
23-month rule.
It is only in the case of the special election that
that would be effected.
If the Court construes the statute as being a
limitation on participation at separate levels of Government,
i.a., the municipal level and the State level of Government,
I think -Q

Would you care to say whether you think the interests

of the State of Illinois could be served by, let us say, a
l2*naonth period?

And if 12i»nth3 isn’t enough, why not?

MR. MITCHELL:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the question

of whether or not the interests of the State would be served
by 12 months, I would say that, yes, it could be, but there is
no reason for this Court to so limit the Legislature of the
State of Illinois.
Q

I am not suggesting that we would.

I was just

probing to see whether *— what your reaction was to that
time factor.
MR. MITCHELL;

Well, we look at the time factor in

terms of other sections of the Code, those sections that
require -• to be & candidate, that you must demonstrate your
allegiance to a party for a period of 24 months prior to the
filing date of your nominating papers, for periods of time to be

20
election judges, for periods of time Co be signatories on
nominating petitions,

X chink that all of this has to be

considered in considering Chis section of the statute, which
only serves identification, does not change the other sections
of the statute which have these other time requirements.
They are just not involved in this case, but they are affected
by it, and it leaves the election code in Illinois somewhat
up in the air and makes it quite difficult to protect the
rights of these people who cast votes,in protecting the
integrity of the vote, and the integrity of the election
process.
Q

Mr. Mitchell, does the fact that a statute could be

more narrowly drawn mean that it is necessarily unconstitutiona
MSI. MITCHELL: No, sir.

I think that this is a

matter, that unless the Court finds that it does deprive the
citizen of some right which is in some significant way, it
should not interject its views into the judgment of the State
Legislature in determining these times that they feel are
proper.
Q

What if, in order to change parties, it was

essential — the waiting period was so long that you would
have to miss a primary?
1®. MITCHELL:

I would have problema with that, but

that is not the case that we have here.
Q

If is if it applies to municipal elections.

21
M&. MITCHELL:

I would agree.

That would be the

case if it applies to municipal elections.
Q

Well, it reads that way on its face, doesn’t it?
MR, MITCHELL:

Q

But, didn’t this come from the three-judge court?
MR. MITCHELL:

Q

But that fact is an accident because »

That's correct.

Didn’t the three~judge court assume, or hold, that

it applied to municipal elections?
MR. MITCHELL:
Q

It assumed.

But, if it does, do you concede you have a problem

with Equal Protection?
MR. MITCHELL;

In the case before the Court, it was

an accident that this could be raised.

If the case bad been

filed in 1973, that fact could not have been stated — could
not have been alleged truthfully.
Q

Why?
MR. MITCHELL:

Because we do not have a municipal

election until 1975, so that if the case had been brought
this year, she could not say that she would have been affected.
And

I
Q

don’t think that she would have —
Are municipal primaries every year?
MR. MITCHELL:

Q

Four years,

Every four years.

And your statewide primaries are

every two years?
MR. MITCHELL:

Every two years.

22

Q

But they don't occur in the same year, that's the

trouble.
MR. MITCHELL:

That's correct.

In the new Election

Code, that will be changed.
Q

How is it going to be changed?

Right now,

municipal elections are off-year; that is, if they are even
numbered years, they are statewide.

It is odd-numbered years

when you have the municipal primaries?
MR. MITCHELL:
Q

That's correct.

And how is Che new Election Code going to change

that?
MR. MITCHELL:

Well, number one, it will make all

elections at the same time, the same period, same days in
the month —
i

Q

In other words, they will all be in the same

primaries, whether municipal or Statewide, will ail be in the
same year?
MR. MITCHELL:

Ho, sir, that they will be in the

same month of whatever year they are held.

Right now, even

that -Q

Does the new £ode change the 23-months requirement?
MR. MITCHELL:

Q

Is it difficult to change it?

Ho, does the new code change the 23-months?
MR. MITCHELL:

It does not.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Cohen.

23
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAY JEFFREY COHEN, ESQ.,
FOR THE APPELLEES
MR, COHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
1 would first like to cover the history and the
chronology of the election, since It has been raised.
First of all, the new election code has not passed the
General Assembly yet.
Secondly, we have municipal elections in different
municipalities at the same time we have them in Chicago, and the
are partisan elections, where there is a Democratic party and
a Republican party.
Q

Well, is that to say that municipal primaries are all

on the same date throughout the State wherever a municipality
has a primary?
MR. COHEN:

Ho, but many are the same date.

Going

back,historically, in April of 1968, certain of the 102 counties
in the State of Illinois had primaries where candidates were
running in the Democratic and Republican primary.
In June of ’68, there was a statewide primary.

That

was before the timing of it was changed.
In October of '69, there was a special Congressional
election which affected one-twenty-fourfch of the voters of the
State after Congressman Rumsfeld was appointed to the Federal
position by President Nixon,

24
In March of 1970, there was a statewide primary
with a now change, changing It from June to March.
In February of *71, the City of Chicago, the City
of Waukeegan, which, I believe, is about the fifth or sixth
largest municipality in the State, and several other municipal­
ities, held their primary, where Democratic and Republican
parties fielded candidates.
March of *72, was the State primary, which was in
question here.
In April of *72, there were again county elections
in certain

— county primaries, excuse me -- in certain of

the counties of the State, including

DuPage County, which is

the second largest county in the State.
In April of *72, excuse me, in June of *73, there
was a special Congressional election in the City of Chicago
which included the town of Berwyn, which is part of the Chicago
1'oard of Flections Commissioners aegis, to fill the vacancy
created by the death of Congressman Collins.
Q

Those were general elections.
MR. COHEW:

Ho, sir.

In June of *73, was a special Congressional
election
Q

That wasn’t a primary.
MR. COHEN:

sir.

It was a special primary.

I am sorry,

25
Q

All right;.
ME. COHEM:

June 5th was the special primary.

July

3rd was the special election.
And, againj in March '74, the statewide primary is
scheduled, and in February of *75, will be the municipal
primary in Chicago, and hundreds of other municipalities
throughout the State.
So, the idea that this is not -** does not have state**
wide effect simply isn’t so.
As I read the Fahey ty case, the Court was asked then
was, by the plaintiff, "Does this statute apply to me.

Will

this bar me from changing party affiliation in the primary?"
And the Court said yes.
Q

In the municipal primary.
MR. COHEM:

Q

In the municipal primary, yes, sir.

Because she had voted in the statewide.
MR. COHEM:

Voted in the statewide primary in

f54 as a *»Q

Republican, or whatever it was, and wanted to vote

in the municipal.

And the Court said, in Faheyty, no, you can't,

because of the statute.
MR. COHEN:

Exactly.

And even the dissent of Judge Marovifcz, where he
disagreed with the finding that this statute was unconstitutional
did nou rest it on the fact that it was a municipal primary,

26
but simply rested it on the fact of compelling State interest
which was raised at some length in the brief.
Q

What do you have to say about the statewide aspect

of this particular -MR. COHEN:
Q

Statute?

Well, as it is applied here,
MR. COHEN:

Well, it was applied statewide.

The

Board of Election Commissioners issued a document which went
out to every election

judge in the 3,500 precincts advising

them, that the 23-month rule was not in effect.

They had a

banner which was about this long which was placed over the
section of the poster and which stated eligibility to vote
which changed that since the decision came so soon before the
election.

It was given statewide effect.
As is pointed out on page 13 of the appellees5

brief, the Board of Elections Commissioners is charged with
the responsibility for maintaining the election code within
their jurisdiction.

There are 103 jurisdictions for elections

under the current election code, two within Cook County.
The Board of Elections Commissioners and the county handles
the rest of the area, and each of the other 101 counties handle
their own election.

So they each have an election officer who

handles it and they must handle it, of course, in the same
way.

So there is statewide effect to it, and I am certain that

no one would say that someone could have one right to vote In

27
Chicago and another right somewhere else in the State, based
on the same statute.
X think -- excuse me —
Q

Are you suggesting that no matter what differences

there may be in the dates on which municipal primaries are held
this statute would disqualify anyone who voted in the statewide
primary from voting in any municipal primary for 23 months?

MR. COHEN:
Q

In the opposite primary.

Xn the opposite party.
MR. COHEN:

In the opposite party, excuse me.

Absolutely, of course.
And, what X attempted to point out with the dates,
and I hope that I didn’t confuse rather than illuminate, was
that there will almost always be two elections within a 23month period.

So, very frequently, rather than very rarely,

will you have to forfeit your right to vote in one election
to vote in another.

And I think counsel’s use o£ the term

"participate” in a primary is really a misnomer, because you
are voting in a primary,

I would probably exhaust the rest

of my time if I recited the citations of the case3 that this
court and lower courts have held that your right to vote in
the primary is as sacrosanct as your right to vote in a general
election.
Q

Is it a common thing -- I’ll alter that — I was

going to ask you whether it was common in Illinois that as a

28
matter of general understanding isn't it common that many
people will vote in one party in their local elections and
prefer the other party in statewide elections?

Just because

of the experience they have with the results.
MR. COHEM:

It would not be ray reading of Illinois

electoral history that that would be so.

The City of Chicago

has elected a Democratic mayor consistently since 1931.

There

are less than five Republican candidates have ever carried the
City in any election at any time on a State or national basis
since then.

Likewise, there are other counties that have not

— that are traditionally Republican both at the local level
and at the national level.

So there is a great deal of con­

sistency in the State of Illinois.

Now, I am not, of course,

as familiar with other areas.
I think what we have when we get to the meat of this
issue is a conflict in rights.
State to regulate elections.

We recognise the right of a
The right of a State to protect,

with limitations, party integrity, but we also recognise the
right to vote.

And it is alleged in the complaint -** in para­

graph eight of the complaint which is found at page 4 of the
Appendix, that plaintiff has been denied her right to vote by
the application of this statute.
We say that this right, this right to vote must be
fceld superior to the right to protect party integrity.

In a

case which, to the untrained eye, might seem controlling in this

29

casa, I think the court anticipated that in Rosario.

The

Rosario decision which, interestingly, was decided one year to
the date after the primary which was affected by our case,
stated that the New York Registration statute was valid.

It

was valid to require one to register some eight to eleven months
prior to a primary, in which primary he was going to vote.
But the majority said, in that case, that this was not locking
in, and that's the language that's used at 9.3 Supreme Court,
page 1250.

Thus, New York's scheme does not lock a voter into

an unwanted pre-existing party affiliation from one primary to
the next.

All that the voter bad to do in that case, if he

wished to vote in the primary of his choice, was simply register
eight to eleven months beforehand.
There are many other States which, have registration
requirements.

California requirement, which was by statute

56 days, has just been reduced by court to 30 days in the case
of Gooffs v. Young, which I believe certiorari was denied on,
although I don't have the citation with me.
In California, you register at the time you vote
as either a Democrat or Republican, or you register as un­
affiliated.

You cannot vote in a primary unless you.are

registered in that party, but you can change your affiliation
or you can register affiliation at any time up to now 30 days
beforehand.

So there, you have the chance to affirmatively do

something yourself to enable you to vote.

30
In the Pont ikes case, under Illinois law, the only
way you can qualify to vote in the Democratic primary at one
point is if you did not vote in the Republican primary 23 months
beforehand,

So the exercise of the franchise will, in effect,

disenfranchise you at any election in the succeeding 23 months
where you might: wish to vote for or against candidates in the
other primary, which is your right.
There was one case on a very similar statute which
was decided before our case, and there were two cases subsequent*
In the prior case, Gordon v. Executive Committee of Charleston,
which is cited in the brief, there Is, in a sense, a calendar
year requirement.

You had to sign an affidavit that you had

not voted in the opposite party primary within that year.
Q

What State was this?
MR. COHEN:

Q

This was in South Carolina,

Three-judge court also?
MR, COHEN:

Three-judge court.

And there, the court

-- unfortunately X am reading from a slip opinion that I have
been using for the last two years and it is on page 5.

t canffc

give you the citafced page -- the court said, "No sound or
compelling purpose can possibly justify locking a citizen into
a party and denying to him for a full year freedom to change
parties.

Such an arbitrary restraint upon the voter is both

unreasonable and unconstitutional."
Q

Is that entirely consistent with Rosario, do you think,

31
that statement you just read?
MR. COHEN:

Yes.

approve or overrule Rosario.

I am not asking the Court to dis­
I think that the majority opinion

almost anticipated these cases in Rosario when they went on to
say that the reason the person was denied the right to vote
was not the statute, but his own forebearance from doing the
simple act of registration.

He was not losing the right to

vote because of the way he voted before, but *>~
Q

After the time for his registration had passed, it

was the statute and not the time lapse that prevented him from
voting in Rosario.
MR* COHEN:
Q

Right.

Only during a very limited party of the time involved

during Rosario, was it his own failure that was responsible for
his **MR. COHEN:

Rut, in New York, if he had voted in a

primary in the Democratic party, for example, in 1970, he could
have, up until eight or eleven months, whatever the exact figure
was, prior to the next election, change his registration and
register in the Liberal Party or the Conservative, or the
Republican.

And I think this was pointed out by the

majority.

And, I think that's why the Rosario decision differs here, and
that's why it is not inconsistent to hold

case, despite Etesario.

Q

Mr. Cohen, you are not here before us challenging the

validity of any part of Section 7-43 except (d)?
MR, COHEN:

That is correct.

43(d) is the part which

refers to a voter changing his affiliation.

And another case

which is similar and where the implication is — of our
position — is the Lippitt case in Ohio, where this Court
decided that a person was not entitled to a change of affilia­
tion in order to be a candidate for office.

There is a very

similar case in Illinois, the BendInger v, Qgllvie case, which
is cited extensively In our brief, which was cited by a threejudge panel of our circuit, which decided that a man who had
voted in the Republican primary in ’71 could not run for office
as a Democrat in the primary of 1972.
discuss the problem of municipal.

Again, they didn't

They just assumed that any

primary would have the same effect,
Q

How, of course, the Lippitt case is a decision of

this Court on die merits.
MR, COHEN:
Q

Yes, sir.

And how do you distinguish that?

That was a four-

year interval.
MR. COHEN: That was a four-year interval, and, as I
recall, the man wished to change from the Republican Party to
the Independent Party to run for Congress.

33
Q

Well, he wished —
"MR, COHEN:

It was a candidate's case, not a voter's

case.
Q

So, howjconetitufcioaaily, is that different?
MR. COHEN:

Well, in the Bendinger v. Ogilvie case,

they point out — and I am sure I cited that section somewhere
in my brief, or it must be in the Appendix in my brief before
the three-judge parra 1, that you can preserve party integrity
-- because that's the balancing factor --by preventing a
person from running as a Democrat this time and then as
a Republican the next time and then a Conservative and then
as a Liberal -Q

This man just wanted to change once.

lie didn't want

to change back and forth and back and forth, so far as v?e know.
He had been a Republican now he wants to change to the American
Independent Party.

He voted as a Republican in the 1970 Ohio

Primary Election and now, in 1972, he wants to run as a candi­
date of the American Independent Party, and there is an Ohio
statute that says he can't do that for four years.
MR. COHEM:

I think the question of party integrity

versus person's rights, there are other cases which have been
decided that say almost — say in effect that it is not a
right to hold public office, but a privilege.

So, in the face

of protecting party integrity, this right or privilege to
be a candidate must fall.

What I am saying is that the right

/

34

to vote xs superior to the right to be a candidate#
Q

Where do you find that?
HR. COHEN:

Where do I find that?

In this particular

-- it is not mentioned anywhere in the Lippitfc case.
Q

So how about in the Constitution?
MR, COHEN:

I think it is implicit in the cases ~~

in Bondinger v. Ogllvie case, which I did cite, which was a
7th Circuit case, that there is a difference between the two
rights.

q

There obviously is a difference but what ~~ why does

one have a superior constitutional position than the other,
and why does either have a constitutional position at all?
MR. COHEN:

I think you’ve hit the nub of it.

I

don’t think the right to be a candidate is constitutionally
protected.
Q

1 do think — I am certain the right to vote is.
Where do you get that?
MR. COHEN:

Q

The right to vote?

Yes.
MR, COHEN:

Well, X believe there are several cases

where this Court has determined that it will protect one’s
right to vote, it will protect one from being disenfranchised.
Q

Xt will protect that activity, as any activity, against

a valid claim of denial of Equal Protection of the law, but
that’s something else again.

Xt will protect your right to

cross the street against that: kind of a valid claim, but that

35
doesn’t mean the right to cross the street against a red
light is necessarily constitutional.
MR. COHEN:

Well, Article 2 of the Constitution

provides for the right for the people to vote for Members of
the House of Representatives, and the right to vote for Members
of the United States Senate was added by a later amendment.
Q

Are you familiar with a case called Miner v. Honorstat

decided by this Court, in which you can find the statement
there is no constitutional right to vote.

That's the case in

which women, a woman, tried fco say that the Constitution gave
her a right to vote.

She was — except for the fact of being

n woman — she was equally we11-qualified in the State to vote
and this Court said there is no constitutional right to vote.
And, that’s, of course, what led to the amendment of the
Constitution that gave women the right to vote.

So now there

is an equal right of women to vote with men, but that decision
still stands, I suppose, that there is not a constitutional
right to vote.

That's the case of Miner v. Haperstat.

MR. COHEN:

t submit that if the Suffrage

Amendment

was passed somewhere around 1920, that would mean that case
would pre-date that.
Q

Yes.
MR. COHEN:

And X would suggest, respectfully suggest,

that that should not, and is not, the current state of the law.
Q

Well, of course, the Constitution pre-dated even that.

36

m.
<3

COUSE:

Yes, sir.

The Suffrage Amendment doesn’t say women shall have

the right to vote.

It says they shan’t be denied the right to

vote by reason of their sex.

It doesn't confer an affirmative

right to vote.
Q

It confirms a specific Equal Protection right.

Q

Mr. Cohen, it seems to me that one could make the

argument with some reason exactly contrary to what you are
saying that if party raiding is a legitimate State interest
that there is more to worry about in terms of party raiding
in terras of voter crossover than there is in terns of candidate
crossover, that you could have candidates crossing over withoutrunning any real risk of party raiding.

Whereas, if you have

voters crossing over, you do have a risk of raiding.
MR. COHEN:
that we have.

Well, of course, party raiding is a theory

Nobody can determine exactly when it is

happening.
Q

Well, Judge Marovifcz cites an article in the Tribune

or the Daily News urging the Republicans to crossover and vote
in the Democratic Primary.
MR. COHEN:

He thought it was real anyway.

I agree, and there are political theorists

who would suggest that the results of the election in 1972, the
primary, was affected by this, but we are not here to argue
political theory.
Q

We are here to argue a person's right--

Not only political theorists but actual candidates have

37
been concerned about this.
the country.

Is this not so?

In your area of

I recall Senator Humphrey making the statement

every two years in primaries in States I ara familiar with,
Wisconsin and Minnesota.
MR. COHEN:

Well, of course, Wisconsin and Minnesota

— and I am glad you pointed that out — have no requirement
that I could find ?.— there is no bar to voting by past regis­
tration.
Q

And that is what they were complaining about.
MR. COHEN:

Well, perhaps, but Section 201 of the

Minnesota Code states the requirements for registration, and
it doesn't require party affiliation to be listed.
Q

Those are so-called open States, and, as Justice

Blackraun said, some political theorists and some practitioners
think that an open State opens the candidate and the party to
a very dangerous attack on the party system.
MR. COHEN:

But, if the argument of party raiding

and party integrity is taken to its logical cone 3.us ion, then,
if this case is affirmed, there will be a disasterous effect
on the political party system in the State of Illinois and
South Carolina, Rhode Island and New Jersey, which have sim­
ilar cases that have been decided.
Q

How long has this law been in effect in Illinois?
MR. COHEN:

Q

Many, many years.

Well, I suppose there are those who say you've had a

38
disaster area there for all that period, but there might be
others who would disagree.
MSI. COHEN:
theory.

Again, we are in the realm of political

But my point is if Wisconsin and Minnesota and Michigan

have been able to exist by having the open primary system, and
seem to be thriving and doing quite well, then the argument
that this case is the only State that protects the two-party
system from dissolving, simply can’t hold water, because these
States are surviving without :Lt.
Q

But, you are talking about two States that have

notoriously weak party structures, Wisconsin and Minnesota,
where there have been third party elements.

Wow, that taay be

permissible as a matter of political judgment on the part of
the legislature, but I would think that if the Illinois
legislature decides it wants to strengthen the two-party
system, it isn't required to apply the practice that Wisconsin
and Minnesota have applied, perhaps, to get different results.
MR. COHEN:

But, there is more at stake than

strengthening the two-party system,

they have the right to do

that if they so choose, but not the point where it disenfran­
chises voters,
so far.

the right to protect the party system only goes

Q

I am still not clear how you distinguish this Court’s

decision in Cippollone, if that's the way it is pronounced,
MR. COHEN:
Q

Lippitt v. Cippollone?

Yes.
MR. COHEN:

On the basis that the right to vote is

superior to the right to be a candidate, and party integrity
may outweigh one but not the other.
Q

And hoi? do you get this hierarchy of these two

supposed rights?
MR, COHEN:

he disagrees, or suggests that somebody disagrees — again,
the question of which protects party integrity, and I refer to
the BendInger v. Ogllvie case.
Q

That the right to vote is somehow the right, as you

call it, to vote, and one would argue about whether cr not
there is a right to vote — but in any event the — that voting
is superior, somehow or other, to being a candidate.
MR. COHEN:

That is correct.

Q

Whence do you derive that?

Q

You say-it is a Constitutional right, don’t you?
MR. COHEN:

at once.

Well, 1 must try to answer both questions

40
Q

I ara sorry.

Excuse me.

I didn't realise I was

interrupting —
MR. COHEN:

I do believe, despite the decision that

you cited — the Women's Suffrage case — that the right to
vote Is iaiplicit, if not explicit, in the Constitution, because
we are to elect a House of Representatives, and we are to vote
for them.
Q

Somebody has to do the voting.
Well, I think the Constitution says more than that,

doesn't it;

doesn't it say that the States shall set the

qualifications for those who vote?
MR. COHEN:

Right.

But we know that there are a

long line of cases where the Federal courts have said, and
this Court has said, that certain requirements that the State
has set forth are unreasonable, and have gone too far.
Q

Right.
MR. COHEN:

And I think that the Lippltt case,

being it is involving a candidate, I think that is where the.
distinction lies.

And I think it is a valid one.

The Lippitt

case was cited both in Nag lor v. Yeoroans, which is the Hew
Jersey case, where the Hew Jersey statute is in effect, where
the three-judge panel held that the fact that you had to
require two successive primaries to elapse before a voter can
change his affiliation is patently over-broad in scope.
Q

Cases such as Williams v. Rhodes and Geneso v.

Fordsen and so on, dealt expressly with the so-called right to

41

be a candidate.

And, as I remember, it didn't denigrate

that right below that of voting, did it?
I®., COHEN:

I don't think there was ever a —

X don’t think the question arose which is the superior right in
that case,

What Williams stands for, as I understand it, is

that a State cannot arbitrarily place too heavy a burden on
a candidate’s attempt to get on the ballot, by signature
requirements.

Lippitt said it is a valid thing to require

that if he is going to run as a candidate of a particular
party, that he be a member of that particular party,
Q

For four years.
Ml. COHEN:

Q

For four years.

And that he can’t run on a different party if he

has voted in another party’s primary within the last four-year
period.
HR. COHEN:
Q

That is correct,

And that was affirmed by this Court less than two

years ago.
HR. COHEN:
Q

Could I ask you just one more question?
HR. COHEN;

Q

Thank you.

Yes, sir.

Xn your case, would you find any difference between

the validity of this statute as applied to State elections and
as it applies to Federal elections?
HR. COHEN:

Absolutely not, because State elections

42
are held at the same time that Federal elections are held in
quadrennial years.
Q

Would you say that a State may no more, qualify the

person's right to engage in a State primary than in a Federal
primary?
MR. COHEM:
Q

Yes, X would.

Although the right to vote in State elections you

wouldn't argue is guaranteed by the Federal Constitution,
would you?
MR, COHEM:

It is not stated specifically there, and

I suppose that a State could have a system of appointing all
its officials, I suppose, and that there would be no need to
elect a general assembly or a governor or any officials.
Q

Well, then, which way are you going?

Are you saying,

then, that the Federal and the State elections in this case
stand on the same footing, that it is just a plain straight
Equal Protection argument, unaffected by any constitutionally
guaranteed right to vote?
MR, COHSH:

Mo.

What X am saying Is that the State

of Illinois cannot limit your right to vote in a Federal
election or a State election in a different way.

In other

words, they could not say that you would be allowed to change
primaries to vote for Federal officers but not change party
to vote for State officers.
Thank you.
