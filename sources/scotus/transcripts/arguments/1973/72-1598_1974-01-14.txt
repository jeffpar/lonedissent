MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 72-1598, National Labor Relations Board against Bell
Aerospace.
Hr, Come, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR„ COME;

Mr„ Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This case is here on certiorari to the Second
Circuit, and the principal question involves the extent to
which certain kinds of employees whom the Board calls
managerial employees are covered by the National Labor
Relations Act,
Now, managerial employees is a Board concept, it's
not a statutory definition, and the Board has defined these
as "employees who are in a position to formulate, determine,
and effectuate management policies»"
The category, as I will show, is not limited to
top management, nor is it limited to persons who carry out
labor relations policies, but it includes a wide range of
minor, administrative or executive, personnel, such as buyers,
expediters, claims adjusters, and so forth *
The present case involves buyers employed by a
company which manufactures and sells rocket engines and

electronic equipment»
Now, it is the Board's position that managerial
employees, assuming that they're not otherwise exempt as
supervisors, are covered by the National Labor Relations Act,
and thus entitled to organizational and bargaining rights
under the Act, unless their duties are concerned with labor
relations or other matters which are likely to cause a
conflict between their job responsibilities and their
responsibilities to a labor organization.
The court below, on the other hand, held that all
managerial employees are exempt from the Act.
QUESTION:

What's the Board's theory on *— you

say this is not a statutory concept, it's a pure Board caseby-case definition?
MR. COME:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

And pursuant to what authority did it

purport to, say, exclude from coverage managerial employees
of any kind, other than supervisors?
MR-. COME:

I will show that that is based upon some

indication in the legislative history, which I'll get to in
a moment.
QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. COME:

The case arises in this factual setting:

Local 1286 of the Auto Workers filed a petition with the
Board seeking certification as the bargaining representative

of 25 buyers employed in the purchasing and procurement
department of the company's Wheatfield, New York, plant.
The company opposed the petition on the ground that the
buyers were managerial employees and thus excluded from the
Act’s coverage.
At a hearing before the Board, the following fact
were established;
The Purchasing and Procurement Department fills
orders from thirty other departments.

This involves

purchasing, maintenance and repair items such as fuel oil
and light bulbs, support items such as packaging and paper,
and production items ranging from simple nuts and bolts to
sophisticated components for the equipment that the
company manufactures.

And about seventy percent of the

company's business consists of parts for the Minute Man
Missile Project»
QUESTION;

The nuts and bolts don't loom very

large in that total spectrum, do they?
MR. COME:

I said that seventy percent of the

company's business are materials for the Minute Man Missile
Project, some of which has nuts and bolts.
Many of the purchases are off-the-shelf items
which can be obtained from a number of sources.

Other

items must be made up according to the company's specific
*

needs.

The buyers in this proceeding work under a

6

Procurement Director, an Assistant Procurement Director, two
purchasing agents, and four supervisors.

There are seven or

eight supervisory personnel over the buyers.
The buyers need not have a college education, nor
does the company have any formal training program for them.
They are guided in their work by a procurement manual, and
other written instructions.
to $275 a week.

Their salaries range from $195

They are not paid for casual overtime, but

they are compensated for scheduled overtime that had been
authorized by a supervisor.
Purchase orders are initiated by requisition from
the various departments.

These go to the Procurement

Department, where they are assigned to a supervisor who in
turn assigns them to a particular buyer.
Requisitions for items which have been ordered
previously generally specify a particular vendor.
vendor has been designated

Where no

on the requisition, the buyer is

free to select one.
When obtaining sophisticated production items,
purchasing decisions are made by a team of supervisory
personnel from the engineering, quality assurance, finance,
and manufacturing departments ? and the buyer acts as the team
chairman.
The buyers may place or cancel orders of less than
$5,000 on their own signature.

Larger orders, however, require

7
supervisory approval, with higher levels of supervision
required as the cost rises*
Indeed, on orders over $5,000, the buyer is
required to conduct prenegotiations with supervisory
personnel in the Procurement Department before he can even
contact a potential vendor*
On the basis of these facts and others in the
record, the Board assumed that the buyers were managerial
employees as the company contended.

However, following

its decision in North' Arkansas Electric, where it had held
that managerial employees were covered by the Act and
entitled to representation rights thereunder, unless they
were concerned with labor relations or other matters that
would present the conflict of interest that I alluded to
earlier, the Board concluded that the company’s buyers were
not in this category and therefore covered by the Act.
The Board rejected the company’s claim that the
buyers' authority to commit the company's credit and to
select suppliers, created a potential conflict of interest
in that the buyer would be more receptive to higher bids
from unionized contractors.
The Board found that the purchasing discretion of
the buyers was neither, quoting from the Board, presently so
unbridled or potentially so uncontrollable as to create the
possible problems of which the employer complains.

8
The Board then found that a unit of buyers alone
would constitute an appropriate unit for collective
bargaining, directed an election in the unit, which the union
won, certified the union, the company refused to bargain in
order to test the certification, and the Board issued a
bargaining order*
The Court of Appeals, as

I indicated, rejected

the Board's view that managerial employees are covered by the
Act except where a conflict of interest is presented, and
held that a managerial employee is not only an employee that
would present a conflict-of-interest problem, but any one
who wa3 formulating, determining or effectuating his employer's
policies, or has discretion independent of an employer's
established policy in the performance of his duties.
If you fell into that category you were a
managerial employee and not covered by the Act,
However,the court added that; the Board would not
be precluded from determining that the buyers here, or some
types of them, might not be managerial employees, as it
defined the term, and it remanded the case to the Board for
such a determination, but directed the Board to do so via
a rule-making proceeding under Section 4 of the Administrative
Procedure Act*
Wow, we do not think that we reach that issue,
although we are prepared to, if the Board's definition of

9

managerial employee is upheld,
QUESTION:

I note your brief says a 1947 amendment,

what is tliis, a second, a revised definition?
MR» COME:

I think that it is, Your Honor, as I

will now get to.
QUESTION: Excuse me»
QUESTION:

I'm sorry»

Oh, Mr. Come, but the Second Circuit

said that you had already defined, or held that buyers were
managerial and not covered, and that you couldn't change
your mind now without a rule.
MR» COME:

That is -- that is correct.

There is

a case, the Swift case, which —
QUESTION; So we're going to have to

even if you

had been correct in the first instance, in defining buyers
as covered by the Act, the Second Circuit says you didn't,
and that even though you could, with the right procedures,
change your mind now, you have to follow different
procedures?
MR» COME: We may have to reach that if you are
persuaded that the Swift case is not an aberration but a
true change.
QUESTION:

Well, but we 'would have to also

disagree with the Second Circuit as to their reading, as to
what you had done?
MR. COME:

Yes, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION:

Yes, okay.

MR. COME:

Nov/, I'd like to get to what we have

been doing.
Section 2(3) of the Wagner Act provided that the
term "employee" shall include any employee, but shall not
include any individual employed as an agricultural laborer, or
in the domestic service of any family or person at his home,
or any individual employed by his parent or spouse.
Nov/, the Board early ruled that since the
statutory devision was of wide comprehension and only had
these three exclusions in it, it covered all other employees,
including managerial employees and supervisory employees.
Thus, the discharge of managerial or supervisory
employees for engaging in union activity would violate
Section 3(1) and (3) of the Wagner Act.
The Board, however, excluded managerial and
supervisory employees from bargaining units of rank-and-file
employees on the ground that their duties v;ere closely
related to management.
With respect to supervisors, because that's where
most of the action occurred under the Wagner Act, the Board
vacillated between holding that not only were supervisors
not included within rank-and-file units, but for a time it
held that it wasn't even appropriate to put them in a unit
confined to supervisors

II

But the Board changed that policy in the Packard
case and found that a unit of supervisors was appropriate
for bargaining.
The Packard case caras to this Court in 1947, and
this Court, by a five-to»*four vote, sustained the Board's
position that foremen were protected by the Act and that a
unit limited to foremen or supervisors was appropriate for
collective bargaining.
Now7, in 1947, Congress turned around and over­
turned the Packard decision by specifically excluding any
individual employed as a supervisor under Section 2(3)
definition of employee»

And thus from the coverage of the

Act.
The legislative evolution of this exclusion,
however, is very significant.

The House bill defined a

supervisor as including not only those individuals with
power to hire, transfer, promote and discharge, discipline,
other employees? but also personnel who fix or make effective
recommendations with respect to wages earned by other
employees? labor relations, time-study, police and guard
personnel? and confidential employees.
This would have excluded from coverage not only
traditional supervisors but many of the individuals whom the
Board had treated as managerial employees.
QUESTION:

It wouldn't, by its terms, have

12

excluded the president of the company, though, would it?
MR, COME: What's that, Your Honor?
QUESTION:

Just taking that exclusion as you've

discussed it, it wouldn't, by its terms, exclude either the
president or the vice president of the company, as I under­
stand it.
MR» COME;

Except in so far as they v/ould have been

excludable as supervisors#

It's difficult to conceive of

one in that position that would not have met the supervisory
definition.
Nov;, the Senate Bill defined the term "supervisor"
more narrowly, limiting it to individuals having authority to
hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, and so on, the traditional
indicia of a supervisor*
The Senate Report and the Senate debate showed
that the narrower Senate definition represented a rejection
of the views of those who instead of merely wanting to
overturn Packard, and exclude supervisors with genuine
management prerogatives from the Act, wanted to exclude
wider categories of employees.
Now, the Conference Committee accepted the Senate's
definition of supervisor, but with regard to those
additional employees who had been included within the House
but not the Senate definition, the Conference Report stated:
"In the case of persons working in the labor

relations, personnel and employment departments, it was not,
though, necessary to make specific provision, as was done
in the House bill, since the Board has treated, and will
continue to treat, such persons as outside the scope of the
Act.

This is the prevailing Board practice with respect to

such people as confidential secretaries as well," and it
went on to say that they were not excluding time-study people
or guards, nor did -they exclude professional employees.
Now, the House Conference Report, in so far as it
stated that the Board was excluding persons working in the
labor relations, personnel and employment departments from
the coverage of the Act, it was mistaken, in that the only
thing that the Board had done with respect to those people,
as it had done with respect to supervisors, was to hold that
they were not appropriately included in units of rank-andfile, office and clerical employees.
But, giving that Conference Report the benefit of
what, of the misapprehension that the conferees were under,
the most that it shows was an intent to exclude from the
coverage of the Act labor relations personnel and employees
in the employment departments, and confidential employees.
The buyers here, and most other of the managerial
employees not concerned with labor relations policy, certainly
do not fit within that category.
Nov/, the reason for excluding persons in the labor

14
relations and ernployment departments from coverage is that
people with those duties are in a position where their
duties could bring them into a confliet»of-interest situation,
if you were to accord them unionization rights.
The Board's test of what managerial employees are
and are not covered by the Act, we submit, gives effect to
this congressional intention that those types of employees
should be excluded from coverage? whereas, on the other hand,
the broader definition of the Court of Appeals that would
exclude from coverage not only managerial employees who are
concerned with labor relations policies, but any other
employee who is concerned with effectuating the employer's
policies, x^ould exclude from coverage thousands of employees
who, there is no reason to believe, that Congress would have
wanted to exclude.
It would exclude many employees that certainly do
not rise to the level of the front line of management, which
was what Congress was careful to confine itself to in
restricting the definition of supervisor, and would exclude
many who certainly are not as we 11-trained as professional
employees, whom Congress did not exclude from the coverage
of the Act,
The only provision that was made with respect to
professional employees was to say that before you can group
them in a unit with nonprofessionals, you have to give them a

15

self-determination election.
Now, what are the reasons which led the Court of
Appeals to what we regard as a misreading of the congressional
intention?
The Court of Appeals thought that unless they
adopted the expansive interpretation of managerial employees
that I have just alluded to,

you would not be giving full

effect to tills Court’s decision in the — that is, the
dissent in the Packard case, which, to be sure, was very,
very responsible for the exclusion of supervisors from the
coverage of the Act.
Now, in Packard, however, the dissent, as we read
it, was concerned with putting in the employer category
all those who acted for management, not only in formulating
but in also executing its labor policies.
The Board's conflict of interest test excludes
from the coverage of the Act managerial employees who are
so involved with labor policies.
Now, the court below also said, and this gets back,
I believe, to the question that you asked, Hr. Justice
Rehnquist, that if you interpret — unless you interpret
managerial employees as broadly as the court below did, you
could lead to the organization of vice presidents and other
top executives, which was prophesied in the dissenting opinion
in Packard.

16

We submit that the Board’s test does not do that,
for two reasons.
In the first place, as I mentioned before, most
such executives are likely to be excluded from the Act as
supervisors, and those who do not meet the supervisory
definition would probably present a conflict-of"interest
situation, and thus would be the type of managerial
employee which the Board’s test would exclude from the Act,
because •—
QUESTION:

May I interrupt for a moment?

MR. COME:

Yes.

QUESTION:

What is the authority for going beyond

the definition of "supervisor'’ that Congress has set down
in the ’47 amendments?
MR. COME:

I think the authority would be the

sentiment of Congress as expressed in that House Conference
Report.
QUESTION:

Does ~~ because -the term "employee"

that came out, the definition of "employee" was also amended
by that, .
MR. COME: That is correct, and what —
QUESTION:

and all it did is exclude supervisors

as defined by the Act.
MR. COME:

That is correct,

that if the Board had —-

I think that the —

17

QUESTION:

Ifc seems to me, arguably, anyway, you

can only exclude -~
MR. COME:

Supervisors.

QUESTION:

— supervisors.

Maybe some of them

you might put a label on, like managerial, but they still
have to be supervisors as defined by the Act.
MR, COME:

I think — I think that that would have

been a terrible interpretation of the statute.
However, that would not, I submit, give effect to
the sentiment as expressed in the House Conference Report,
that certain other employees, namely, those concerned or
working in the labor relations, employment departments, and
confidential employees would not be covered by the Act.
Nov/, as I explained, Congress was mistaken in that
the Board was not excluding them from the Act.

It was merely

excluding them from bargaining units,
QUESTION: Well, maybe those two categories, but
that's a long way from buyers.
MR. COME:

That is correct, and that is why we

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but it's also a long way

submit *—

from any other group that you might say is so wound up in
employer policy that there might be a conflict.
the Board's view, isn’t it?
MR,COME:

That is correct, Your Honor.

That's

18

QUESTION:

But that's a lot broader than the

definition of supervisors»
QUESTION: Right,
MR. COME:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Is there — is it conceivable that a

buyer who is a member of the union would make decisions on
purchases, those within his jurisdiction and those
recommendations that he could make up to fifty thousand,
favorable or weighing unduly the companies that had
contracts with his own union, as distinguished from neutral
factors that a buyer should take into account?
Is that a rational factor for an employer to take
into account in this equation?
MR. COME: Well, the employer can take it into
account in so far as in the procurement policy manual or
instructions that he controls the discretion of the buyer,
to point out that that should not be a factor.

And if it

proves to be a factor, I suppose it would be grounds for
discharge; but it's a long way for ~~
QUESTION:

But it's a pretty difficult thing to

try to enforce, is it not?

As is so often the case with

conflicts of interest.
MR. COME:

What the — but, on the other hand, the

chances of enforcing it are not that remote that you go to
the other extreme of saying that a whole group of people, and

IS
the Court of Appeals pointed out that there must be hundreds
of thousands of buyers, should be denied the protection of
the Act if they wished to organize and bargain collectively.
Now, the Court of Appeals felt that the Board had,
in the Swift case, led Congress, when it amended the Act in
1959, to believe that buyers were not covered by the Act,
and therefore the feict that Congress, in 1959, didn't change
the Act should be deemed to fortify the view that buyers
were not covered by the Act,
Now, in the Swift case, in 1954, to be sure, the
Board held that a separate unit of poultry procurement
drivers

could not constitute an appropriate unit for

collective bargaining, because it was the clear intent of
Congress to exclude from the coverage of the Act all
individuals allied with management.
We submit that this i7as an inaccurate statement,
that went beyond Congress's intent in 1947, it was contrary
to numerous Board decisions immediately after the enactment
of the 1947 amendments, which merely held that managerial
employees could not be included in the same bargaining unit
with rank-and-file employees.
The fact that Congress in 1959 did nothing, we
further submit, is of no relevance because when it amended
the Act in 1959 there was nothing in those amendments
which dealt, in so far as the basic 1959 changes, dealt with

20

the rights of labor unions under Landrum-Griffin, -QUESTION: Right.
MR. COME:

— reporting and so on.

And the only

amendments to the National Labor Relations Act were to
strengthen the union unfair labor practices against secondary
boycotts and picketing. There is absolutely no indication
that anyone brought up the question of the coverage of
managerial employees or that Congress focused on them.
We submit that the fact that the 159 amendments were
enacted without any change in the managerial definition does
not advance our analysis one whit.
I see that my time is up.

I'll have to refer the

Court to our brief on the rule-making problem in the case.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

Has the Labor Board ever made any rules

of a substantive nature?
MR. COME:

Not of a substantive nature.

Since

Wyman-Gordon, which was the last time that we were before this
Court on that question, the Board has enacted two rules with
respect to the assertion of jurisdiction.

One over colleges

and universities, and the other over symphony orchestras,,
After a rule-making proceeding, the Board set
dollar amounts which would govern the exercise of its
discretionary jurisdiction over these industries.
QUESTION:

Horse racing and dog racing, too, didn't

21

it?
MR. COME:

They held a rule-making proceeding with

respect to horse racing and dog racing, but after getting in
the views of the various interested parties they decided not
to assert jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

This didn’t apply to the horses and the

dogs, I suppose, but to the people.
MR. COME;

No, this would be to the trainers and

the personnel there.
[Laughter. ]
QUESTION: The Board, in fact, has been rather
we11, I was going to say allergic; but, in any event, just
simply hasn't deemed it appropriate or wise to rule-making
authority that other agencies used.

That's a fair statement

of the historic fact, isn't it?
MR. COME:

I think that that is a fair statement.

However, I should like to — if I might take a few
more minutes — point out that although the academicians and
the legal scholars find that the Board should use it more,
the surprising tiling has been that the practitioners before
the Board, both on the labor and the management side, and
this has been the subject of numerous discussions on the
various American Bar Association committees, are perfectly
satisfied with the Board's continuing to treat these
problems via the adjudicative route.

And have been uniformly

22
in agreement that there should be no departure from past
practice„
Of course that is not the be-all and the end-all,
but it indicates that the Board's customary procedure has been
found satisfactory.
Now, the other part of the problem is that the
Board, unlike many other administrative agencies, does not
have any roving commission to go out and investigate a
problem and then promulgate a rule»

We can only get into the

act if somebody files a charge with us, or somebody files a
petition for a representation election.
So, there you are, in the middle of an adjudicatory
proceeding, where the facts are very important," and if you
were to go to a rule-making proceeding at that point, you're
going to have to have that proceeding mark time, conduct your
rule-making proceeding and, with respect to many of the
provisions that we administer which are in general terms and
where facts make a difference, it's been the Board's judgment,
and I might say that this has been the view -- this is some­
thing that the Board has been consistent on, irrespective
of the composition of the Board? that when you got through
with all of that, you would end up with something of such a
general nature that it wouldn't be of much value.
You'd have to pick up your adjudicatory or
representation proceeding and go on from there.

23
QUESTION;

Which is 'the point you make in the

brief in this case, isn’t it?
MR0 CONE:

Yes.

I think that, although I know

that Judge Friendly has been very vigorous in this area, that
this is, I believe, the worst possible case for making the
case for rule-making.

I think that we were much more

vulnerable in Wyman-Gordon.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Moot.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD E. MOOT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MOOT:

If it please the Court.

Mr. Chief

Justice:
I am Richard Moot from Buffalo.

We represent the

Bell Aerospace Company, a Division of Textron.
Our firm has represented this company and its
predecessor, the old Bell Aircraft Company, for a great many
years.

My partner, now deceased, Mr. Winch, handled the

original proceeding before -the — at the time of the hearing.
I would like, at the beginning, just to mention the
facts briefly where we believe the statement of facts is
somewhat lacking, and then to give you the points which I
will make here this afternoon, which are very brief.
The buyers in this case, who petitioned to be
represented under the Labor Management Relations Act, were

24

25 in number.

The job description called for a preferred

for a senior buyer, and that was the largest number of them,
of a college education with a business administration
specialty.
Now, itTs true that many of them did not have
them, and that was not covered at the hearing.
But six years’ practical experience was considered
a substitute for it.
In this case the buyers — and may I just say that
our business was not either burning fuel oil or burning out
electric light bulbs, as the brief might suggest; we’re a
contractor very heavily in research and development and
seventy percent of our business is the guidance package,
propulsion package for the Minute Man missile, a large part
of which is tailormade to the most exact specifications.
The buyers in this case had the prime responsibility,
two-fold, of seeing a steady flow of the necessary material,
special tools and components came to the plant at Bell, so
•that the production schedule for Minute Man would stay on
line.
Secondly, they had the responsibility to see that
this was done with the maximum economy of the company, their
employer's money.
One buyer, senior buyer in this case, in the 19month period, which we’re talking about, spent $1,300,000 on

25

his own initiative, taking collectively the amount that he
purchased on his own say-so alone.
The group in total —
QUESTION:
MR. MOOT:
QUESTION:
MR, MOOT:

Over how long a period was this?
Nineteen months.
Nineteen months.

Unh-hunh,

In the 19-month period the group of

25, together, spent $7,600,000 on their own initiative.
Collectively they participated -**
QUESTION:

Well, it was the company that spent it;

MR, MOOT:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Right.

right?

MR, MOOT:

But on their signature,

Collectively, in the same period, the

group of 25 supervised or participated in the procurement of
material in the amount of $41,300,000,
Nov;, I say those facts, so that we'll not be misled
in talking about buyers, to think we’re opening up a catalog
from Sears, Roebuck and saying where are they going to get
this or that piece of pottery to stack the shelf.
We’re not talking about light bulbs, fuel oil,
packing paper, or shelf items, which are constantly being
mentioned in the opposing brief.

At best, that is, and I’ll

be quite frank, an attempt to mislead the Court as to the
nature of the duties here,

26

QUESTION;

But to the contrary, you say you're not

talking about light bulbs, you* re not talking about this,
you're not --- what are you talking about?
MR. MOOT:

We're talking, Mr. Justice Marshall,

we're talking about special components for a Minute Man
missle, highly complex electronic devices.

In many cases

it's cheaper for our client, Bell, to buy, say, a black box
from Minneapolis-Honeywell than it would be to ask the
people in the plant to make it.
Wherever they're asking for a guidance system, or
any part of a guidance system, or an intricate valve on one
of the control valves for Minute Man, if that can be made
more cheaply and better outside the plant, then that's the
buyer's job to find somebody who can do it and have it
built outside the plant and brought in.
And in the Appendix to the record here
QUESTION;

How many people do they supervise?

MR. MOOT: They act on their own initiative.
QUESTION:

So they don't supervise anybody.

MR. MOOT:

They're not being exempt as supervisors.

QUESTION: That's why they're not supervisors.
MR. MOOT;

That's right.

They're acting as a part

of management.
And in this, buyers act as a team? they include
engineering, quality control, financial, and the buyer himself

acts as captain of -that team»
He does not perform his job at a desk at the Bell
plant.

It's necessary for him to visit the various sub­

contractors or parties where the material, special tool or
special component is either being designed or being built.
He has the responsibility to see that the production date
and schedules are maintained.
If a strike occurs at this supplier's plant, and the
dollar amount is under $5,000, he can cancel it at the
strike-ridden plant and put it in a non-union plant, in
order to insure the orderly flow of necessary components
to the assembly of the Minute Man missile.
QUESTION;

Are these people —

QUESTION:

Mr. Moot — excuse rae.

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

Are these people, as a group, charged

with the responsibility of making so-called make-or-buy
decisions, or do they only operate after the decision has
been made to buy?
MR. MOOT:

They have, as the proof shows here, the

authority to decide make-or-buy? they also have the authority,
under 5,000, to change from the recommended source; if
some department at Bell recommends a given source they can
change that source if it's under 5,000.

If it's over 5,000,

they make an investigation and a report and it goes up the
ladder.

28

QUESTION:

On a, let’s say, big item, a hundred

thousand dollar item, —
MR. MOOT;

But again

QUESTION:

— do they have a make-or-buy decision?

I know they can’t do the buying, if it*s on their own, if
it’s over 5,000| but how about the management decision to
make-or-buy?
MR, MOOT:

They make the recommendation, and that

recommendation is reviewed.

But I'm sure Your Honor well

knows that where the work has been carefully done at that
level, the question on review is:

is it documented?

is it a

satisfactory piece of work?
But the knowledge and the specialty and to knov/ how
to make an intelligent recommendation there rests with the
buyer.

And in the overwhelming cases, as the proof in this

record shows, he is sustained on review.
QUESTION: Are there any limitations on the buyer’s
authority to select the seller?
MR, MOOT:

He is *— yes, there is, and this is why

he's part of management.

His limitation is he must select

the supplier which is going to do it most economically for
the company.

And in the record here, there are about fifteen

pages of cost reductions achieved by selecting a buyer [sic]
sometimes other than the one designated, because he could
get a better price.

He has the characteristic function of

2S
management, to try and conduct the business of the company
in a more economical manner.

But he has no restrictions on

whether he should buy union or non-union.

And if- he thinks

he can get a better price non-union, he buys it non-union.
QUESTION:

Does top management provide the buyer

with a list of manufacturers who are deemed technically
competent to produce this sophisticated equipment you are
talking about?
MR, MOOT; There are regulations with respect to
— or guides that people have used before, and people who
have been approved by the Department of Defense and other
guidelines? yes, there are.
QUESTION;

But if the prospective supplier is on

the list, then the buyer has the authority to make the
decision?
MR. MOOT;

Well, I think he has the right to go

off the list, too, in certain cases.
Now, if I can just —
QUESTION:

You believe the buyers here, the twenty-

odd buyers here, Mr. Moot, have professional engineering
training?
MR, MOOT;

I think -— and again this is not detailed

name-by-name in the proof, as I read the record — the
experience in this case was predominantly learned on the job.
Nov;, if -

excuse me

30

QUESTION;

It strikes me that, interesting as this

has all been, probably it’s not very material to the case,
because doesn't the government concede that these, at least
for the purposes of this case and this argument, doesn't the
government concede that these are managerial employees?
MR. Z400T:

Thank you, Mr. Justice Byron, that's

what -— I was hopeful I could get to that before more of
my time was gone.
QUESTION:

Yes,

MR. MOOT:

That certainly is true.

And the point 1 want to make, and if I only make
this one point this afternoon, I believe I'll serve my client
well.
The rule that's being espoused in this case is new.
Make no mistake about it.

The position of Judge Friendly

below is very simple.
He saids

Where there's a well-established rule

as to what is management and what is not management, you
stick by the rule, unless — if you're going either rule-making
or back to the Congress.
Now, let's just make this point -QUESTION?

But the Board's first decision on that

was in the North Arkansas case.
MR. MOOT;

They did, and let me just --

QUESTION;

This isn't really any different from

31
what they did there, is .it?
I1R„ MOOT;

The point exactly I'in making is that

Worth Arkansas is a new rule, and North Arkansas, of course,

QUESTION;

And North Arkansas overruled Swift,

three years ago.
MR. MOOT;

Exactly.

And the claim made in brief

here, Justice —
QUESTION: That’s three years ago.
MR. MOOT:

Yes, but this proceeding began in 1970.

At the time this hearing was conducted, North Arkansas had
not been decided.
As a matter of fact, by a strange coincidence,
tiie decision was dated, on North Arkansas, August 27th, 1970.
And the hearing officer began proof in this case August 28th,
1970.
And if I could just read a short part from the
record, to make how clear it is that this conflict-ofinterest rule, which they're now saying they had all along.
The claim in brief here is that Swift is an
aberration, and that from the time of 1947, the Taft-Hartley
amendment and the overturning of Packard, that all along they
have excluded, or — excuse me

they have said managerial

employees are only excluded if they’re in labor relations or
if they present a potential conflict-of-interest or a

32

statutory — I think as Mr* Justice White points out —
exclusion, like supervisors.
And we say that just simply is not so.

The conflict-

of-interest rule is just as new as N or th Ark ansas.
QUESTION; Well, they felt — I gather the Board
felt it essential to decide North Arkansas the way it did,
to overrule Swift.
MR. MOOT;

Yes, and what —

QUESTION:

And it also said not only Swift but

other decisions to the same effect.
MR. MOOT;

That is correct, Mr. Justice White,

and that's 'where Judge Friendly below and general counsel
for the Board have parted company.
The position of Judge Friendly below that where a
long line of cases, from 1947 up to 1970, have said that
buyers who spent significant amounts of the company's money,
with significant independent discretion, have been considered
a part of management and not covered by the Act,
And where a long line of cases, such as that, is
'well established, and you wish to change it, you should
adopt rule-making, otherwise it leaves the practitioner, and
we certainly don't adopt the view of the American Bar
Association or anyone else, that we want to have a new rule
as to what is management and what is labor, produced by
this case or any other case.

33

If they're going to make a change in hov/ they've
decided these cases from 1947 up to 1970, which is the date
of our case -QUESTION: But your case was tried under the new
rule, was it?
MR. MOOT:

No.

QUESTION:

Yes.

Let me just point that out.

Even though your hearing began the day after North
Arkansas came down?
MR. MOOT:

Well, quite understandably, Mr. Justice

Brennan, we don't read the slip opinion from the National
Labor Relations Board on a 24-hour basis.
QUESTION:
do?

No, but what could the hearing examiner

Did he •—
MR, MOOT:

the record,

Yes, I'm going to read that right from

I'm pleased to have your question.

The hearing officer said —
QUESTION: Where are you reading from nov7?
MR, MOOT:

Page 8.

QUESTION ;

Of the Zvppendix?

MR. MOOT:

Yes, Your Honor.

The hearing officer asks my associate, or my
partner, Mr. Winch:

"Briefly what is the position of the

company?"
And Mr. Winch replies: —

34

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I can't find that.

Did you

say page 8?
MR. MOOT:

Page 8.

QUESTION:

Oh, yes.

MR. MOOT:

And the hearing officer says:

Thank you.
"Mr.

Winch, briefly what is the position of the company as to the
appropriateness of this unit?"
And Mr. Winch replies:

"The employees v/ithin the

named unit are managerial employees and, secondarily, that
they have no community of interest,"
The community~of~interest matter did not survive
in the hearing, and the question then resolved as to whether
they were or were not managerial employees.
The representative for the UAW, at the conclusion
of the proof -- I'm now turning to page 83 of the record ~in which he was stating what he wanted to prove.

This is the

UAW representative himself.
"I would like to have the record show that this
adjournment was granted solely for the purpose of giving the
union an opportunity to produce evidence that the buyers are
not managerial employees and for no other purpose."
QUESTION:

Did anybody even mention North Arkansas

in the course of this proceeding?
MR. MOOT:

No.

Nor, Mr. Justice Brennan, was the

matter of conflict of interest, the very thing which in brief

35
now they say must be determined, factual question to be
determined, was not even mentioned.

There was no argument

with respect to conflict of interest at the time of the
proof.
The first time conflict of interest entered this
case —
QUESTION:

What happened when you got to the

Board?
MR, MOOT:

When it got to the Board, the Board

conceded that these were managerial employees and a part of
management, but they said, we have the right

and you’ve

led me to my next question,
QUESTION:

Well, they must have followed their

own North American precedent,
MR, MOOT:
QUESTION:
MR, MOOT:

North Arkansas,
Ntorfch_Arkansas; sorry,
Yes, they did.

And they said by brief, if I can read again ~
now, this is the position directly contrary to the position
taken by brief in this Court, which we find somewhat
embarrassing.
They said:

While the Board's decision in North

QUESTION:

What page are you on?

MR, MOOT:

What's that?

QUESTION:

What page?

36

MR. MOOT;

I'm on the brief for the Board in the

Second Circuit.
QUESTION;
MR. MOOT;

Oh.

We don't have that.

Well, I believe it's filed with the

Court, Your Honor, but I'm not sure it's in front of you.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. MOOT;

But we also quoted it in our brief.

And they say;
Arkansas

While the Board's decision in North

and the instant case mark a change in Board policy,

it is well settled that the Board may change its policy if
in doing so it does not act arbitrarily.
Now, this is where Judge Friendly said;

If you're

going to change and say what has always been a part of manage™
ment and say that's not management, or to say, if you will,
that management has the right to organize and .bargain under
the Act with management, if you can't show that it's labor
sensitive or in a conflict, of interest.
Judge Friendly and the Eighth Circuit both read the
legislative history to say that that's absolutely out, that
when Congress originally passed the Act it was designed —in answer to your earlier question, Mr. Justice White — to
provide a set of ground rules for management to bargain with
labor.

It xi?as never intended that management would bargain

with non™labor sensitive management.
And that was the position that Judge Friendly took.

37
And he said:

If you want to establish a rule now that

managerial employees, part of management, have the right to
organize and bargain with other management, if they're
outside of the labor relations department, or if they1 re
not in a conflict-of-interest situation, you go back to
Congress with that argument.
But, he said, if what you're trying to say is that
buyers who, for this whole period, from 1947 to 1970, on
similar-fact situations, without exception during that period,
the Board had treated as they did in Swift and American
Locomotive, had treated those type of employees as a part of
management, and said that they were outside the Act.
He said, now, if you want to say buyers are not
really part of management, you want to change your mind,
that you should go through rule-making to do that.
And we think that that rule is an eminently
sensible one.

That if they v^ant to establish two categories,

of management and have management bargain with management,
that's for Congress.
Iff you want to change a well-established definition
as to what is part of management, buyers under factual
situations similar to what we have here, you should do that
with rule-making.
I think the —
QUESTION:

The first part of that proposition

38

announced by Judge Friendly was based on his theory that
Congress had reenacted what had been a Board view.
MR. MOOT:

In part.

QUESTION:

Well,, what else was it based on?

MR. MOOT:

I think it was based upon the original

approach and handling of the National Labor Relations Act
when it was first passed? that the National Labor Relations
Act, when first passed,—
QUESTION:

But these ~

MR. MOOT:

— had not attempted to find what was

management in all-inclusive terms.

It was assumed that if it

was management, it was on one side, and labor was on the
oilier side.
And the first major dispute over that arose in
Packard.

Where, in Packard, they said that foremen are not

a part of management and they're covered.

And Congress quickly

corrected that, and said they should not be, they should be
excluded from the Act; and that was done.
But from the very beginning of the National Labor
Relations Act, and certainly throughout its whole history,
the whole purpose is to provide a system or ground rules
between management on one side and labor on the other, and
no attempt, I don't believe, Mr. Justice White, was ever made
to say the following shall constitute management and the
following shall constitute labor.

39

QUESTION: Well, I still wonder, what's trie basis
for saying that even by a rule the Board couldn't give a
construction to some statutory words that might be different
from what — from the way it. had construed them before.
Unless you're going to say that Congress itself has adopted
the one construction.
MR. MOOT:

Well, certainly that's what the Eighth

Circuit and the Second Circuit did in -QUESTION:

Well, that's in effect saying that

Congress froze the Board's original definition, isn't it?
MR. MOOT:

After a long period of time, and it's

not surprising that they did, considering the number of
years.
QUESTION:

That's the question, I suppose.

MR, MOOT;

Yes.

Yes, it is.

And all I can say,

in answer to your question, Mr. Justice White, is that we
agree with the legislative history arguments in both the
Eighth Circuit and the Second Circuit.
But the point which I'm trying to make, and I want
to make absolutely clear here, is that when they came to
North Arkansas they changed the rules, and that Swift is not,
as they now claim, an aberration; that the rule was well
established, from 1947, the time of the Taft-Hartley Act,
to 1950 [sic].
Let me just read from general counsel's brief in

40

in -the North Arkansas case.

Nov;, this is general counsel

from the National Labor Relations Board -QUESTION?

But you give the problem of not only

saying what Board practice was but that Congress froze it,
if you're going to say that —
MR, MOOT:

Yes, I understand that.

And all I cam

say in the time allotted here, Mr. Justice White,
QUESTION:

— is that you just rely on the

legislative history.
MR. MOOT:

Of the two —- I -think that both the

Eighth Circuit and the Second Circuit
QUESTION:

Read it correctly,

MR. MOOT:

■— were correct.

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. MOOT:

And I think that they've given full

weight to ■*-QUESTION:

And I suppose we've got to re-read it

ourselves, don't we?
MR. MOOT:
QUESTION:

I expect that is true.
Yes.

MR, MOOT: But I think that where, in attempting
to get around that —
QUESTION: Well, let's assume for the moment,
though, that you — that we disagreed with you on whether
Congress froze that approach, and the question is:

May the

41
Board change its mind?
Accepting your view of Swift and of North. Arkansas
as a change in the rule, was it permissible for the Board to
change its mind in an adjudicatory proceeding?
MR. MOOT:
QUESTION:
there?

I don’t think so.
Now, there is no authority for that, is

Other than what

other than the judgment we're

reviewing.
MR. MOOT:

Well, that's -- and I -think that the

provisions of the Administrative Procedure 7^ct, I certainly
am in Judge Friendly's corner on that.
Let's put this, if we will, in the pragmatic
posture it was when it came to us, as counsel for an employer.
And here we had an unbroken line of cases from the TaftHartley Act forward, which said:

managerial employees of

this type were outside the protection of the Act.

They

were spending a significant amount of money of the company?
they were primarily charged with economy and management of
the company and its funds, and they're exempt.
QUESTION:

We've certainly approved a. lot of
**

mind changes without a rule, up to now, I would suppose.
MR, MOOT:

What we're saying is that where such a

major departure is going to be made from a well-established
line of cases, that it's either for Congress, which has
amended it, as they did in the case of overturning Packard,

42

or it’s for rule-making.

That’s our position,

I think the reason why, in. this Court, —QUESTION:

I suppose that, earlier in this term —

I'm sorry I don’t know the name of it, since I wrote it, but
I don't — we dealt with this problem of the Board's changing
its mind.

I think it was the definition of successor

corporation, for purposes of liability under an order
issued against a predecessor.
And it never occurred to us to suggest rule-making
in that case.
MR. MOOT:

Well, I think, quite honestly, if you're

going to — to me, the argument that's appealing to me as a
lawyer is that if you're going to change what you've always
considered to be management; in other words, if you're going
to change the jurisdictional grounds of this statute,
that that's something Congress ought to be doing and we
ought not to be doing it on a single case.
That's more appealing to me, that this is for the
legislature not the courts.
QUESTION s

Yes. .

QUESTION:

But I think an examination of the Board's

activity in the successor corporation area would disclose that
this was done in a series of cases, a series of short steps
rather than one large leap.
MR. MOOT;

Well, that's the very advice here, and

43

the leap happens to come after we've had the hearing.
After the very factual issue which is supposed to be
determined in each case is over.

We never got to conflict

of interest because it. ivasn't the law.
Mr. Winch had practiced in this field for forty
years.

He never heard of it.

heard of it.

The hearing officer hadn't

And the UAW representative hadn't heard of

this rule.
QUESTION: Do I understand there was no evidence
in this record at all on the conflict-of-interest issue?
MR. MOOT:

None whatsoever, Mr. Justice Powell.

It's that new.
And the idea that Swift is an aberration which is
being urged upon Your Honors by the brief here is absolutely
false.
QUESTION: And it came up for the first time in the
opinion of the Board -~
MR. MOOT:

In North Arkansas,

QUESTION:

and it was not argued before the

Board.
MR. MOOT:

In

well, North Arkansas went up ■—

QUESTION:

In this case*

MR. MOOT:

~ and then back and then up again.

And finally the Eighth Circuit rejected that conflict-ofinterest test the second time it went to the Eighth Circuit.

44
And this led to another embarrassing thing in our case,
because the very day of the decision, second decision in
North Arkansas was the day of the decision of the
our case.

And we asked:

Reconsider it.

Board in

The Eighth Circuit

doesn't agree with you.
And they said:

We don't have to reconsider it,

we were right in the first place.
Now, we've got two Circuit Courts which say this
is management and it's not covered; and they said, We don't
care, we'll still persist with this rule.
And the pragmatics of applying conflict of
interest just open a whole host of problems.
I'll leave it there, because I see I only have a
few minutes.
I don't think, and I agree with Mr. Chief Justice
the test of conflict of interest must be one of the most
difficult of all to apply, because, as the facts and
circumstances change, whether a particular part of management
is in a conflict of interest will change.
be in one time and out another.

And people may

An example from our very

own company;
The decision was made from a corporate point of
view to take the principal production from WheatfieId and
move it to Texas, and labor costs were a significant part
of it, they had a very stormy production, labor negotiation

45
history in the Niagara Peninsula.
Many people would have to participate on that move
from Wheatfield to Texas.

Once made, the same people might

have no labor-sensitive input whatsoever to management,, but
they might be highly labor-sensitive, or in a position to
conflict-of-interest while that decision of opening a
separate plant in the south was before the table.
Afterwards, they wouldn't be.
QUESTION:

Now, could I ask you:

As I understood

your recitation of what happened in this case, when the
Board got around to deciding the case and issuing its own
order, it did take cognizance of North Arkansas.
MR. MOOT:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
And it did pitch its

decision on

North Arkansas?
MR. MOOT:

Yes,

QUESTION:

And on conflict.

MR. MOOT:

That's right.

QUESTION:

Now, on that record, on the record that

it had before it, whether you tried it on that theory or
not, the Board apparently thought the record adequate and.
that you weren't denied due process or anything by their
deciding the case on the North Arkansas basis.
MR. MOOT: Well, that's what they thought.
QUESTION:

Now,Judge Friendly seemed to think that

46

it was

that you could not affirm — that you could not

decide this case on the Worth Arkansas basis,
MR. MOOT;

Well, he thought Worth Arkansas was

wrong, and secondly, he said you couldn't change it, —
QUESTION;

Well, he went ---

MR, MOOT;

— which v/ay they decided it,

QUESTION;

Well, what he actually said was;

We

cannot be sure —
MR. MOOT;

That's right.

QUESTION;

-- that the Board's decision rested on

such a factual determination,, —
MR c MOOT;
QUESTION:

Th at's right.
-- rather than on its new and high iy

erroneous holding.
MR. MOOT:
QUESTION:

You couldn't tell,
And he said there's a Chenery problem

involved.
MRt MOOT:

That’s right.

And you can't tell to this day, reading this record,
which way they decided it,
QUESTION:

I know, but you've just said that the

Board did pitch its decision on North Arkansas,
■ mi.... i*»»*»'" ’«i

MR, MOOT:

Well, I said that ~

QUESTION;

And on conflict,

MR. MOOT:

— to this extent, that they conceded

47
that the buyers were managerial, both in brief and by
argument.

That's the only way you can tell, that they

apparently made that concession.
But as Judge Friendly said, when I argued the
case in front of him, the fact the Board conceded it doesn't
mean that it's so.
QUESTION:

Now, do I understand your position is

that you put no evidence in on this issue of conflict
because,at the time you were putting your evidence in, that
wasn't relevant evidence.
MR. MOOT:

True.

And it's a very difficult thing to make evidence
on potential conflict of interest, because the real
conflict of interest often doesn't develop until you
organize the part of management.
QUESTION:

How long did it take you to try the

case before the examiner?
MR. MOOT;

Two days or — I think it began the

23th, it went to September 3rd.

So maybe a week's time

altogether.
QUESTION:

And no one — still nobody had heard

°f North Arkansas?
MR. MOOT:

No, they didn't.

But we did get it

and put it in the addendum of our brief, Mr. Justice —
QUESTION s

But, you know, North Arkansas, by the

43
time -they got around to overruling Swift and Company, that
was on remand from the Eighth Circuit.
MR. MOOT;
QUESTION:

True.
And that had been in 1967, that the

Eighth Circuit remanded to find out if that particular
managerial employee there should not only be excluded from
the unit but to see whether he had protections against unfai
labor practices,
MR. MOOT:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Now, that ivas an outstanding issue in

MR. MOOT:

Yes, but the decision was on our side

at that time.
QUESTION:
MR. MOOT:

I understand, but it was —
Yes, we were in a representation case,

and the Eighth Circuit had made it clear that a managerial
employee of the type in North Arkansas did not qualify for
representation.

That was one of their first decisions, and

so we're quite correct in saying conflict of interest is not
a provable matter in this hearing, because it never had been
before; and the Eighth Circuit said it shouldn't be.
So neither the hearing officer nor the UAW
representative or Mr. Winch, who had spent forty years in
this field, attempted proof on it, because it wasn't proper.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
light? you have five minutes left.

That's only your white

49

MR. MOOT:

All right.

I'm happy to answer any

more questions, but I believe if I've made my one point and
made it to the best of my ability:

that they're espousing a

new rule, and perhaps it's an overstatement, but certainly
I don't believe so.
That what they're trying to do in this case, the
Board is trying to do, is to say that the protection of the
Labor Management Act extends not just to labor, but that
management, unless it's in a labor-sensitive position, in
labor relations, or excluded by a particular portion of the
code — like supervisors, that's one; agricultural workers
are another -— that management is free to organize and bargain
with management, subject to those exclusions.
And we say that's brand new.

And we say that if

that's what they want, they better go to Congress to get it.
QUESTION:

You were starting to read something from

the brief of the general counsel —
MR. MOOT:
QUESTION:
you.

Yes.

Just because --

— some time ago when we interrupted

I'd be interested in what that was.
MR. MOOT:

It's thoughtful of you to remind me,

because certainly in the brief here there's no question that
they have taken the position that — they've taken the
position in their brief here that Swift is an aberration.
I see that that position has not been adopted by

50

several members of this Court right now, but general counsel,
in his brief in the Eighth Circuit, took no such position»
QUESTION:

Nov/, this is in what case, and when?

MR» MOOT:

In Nor til Ark ans as.

In -- I can't tell

you right now, because I've got the citation but it doesn't
say first or second appeal.

This is what —

QUESTION:

But sometime in 1970-71?

MR. MOOT:

That's right.

Well, it would be

between '67 and '70,
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. MOOT:

And this is general counsel, writing

for the Board:
While the Act makes no specific provision for
managerial employees, the Board has long held that this
category of personnel to be excluded from the Act.
Now, that's general counsel from the Board itself
saying this category of employees in a long line of cases
Was held to be excluded.
QUESTION:

Now, I take it that one of the approaches

of the Board has been not to define these managerial employees
as excluded employees, but as — that they are employers.
You define the term "employer" to include these managerial
employees.

That's what this -MR. MOOT;

Yes.

I suppose they're equating

"managerial" with "management" and "employer".

QUESTION: Well, that's what they've said»
MR, MOOT;
QUESTION:

That’s right»
That’s what they said in North Arkansas.

That they will construe

that the question about managerial

employees is whether they’re to be thought of as employers
or as employees.
MR. MOOT:

Yes.

And prior to North Arkansas, for

that long line, as general counsel said, they were considered
employers.

Now they want to change it all.
We say that we want to change the basic coverage

of the Act in this fundamental way:

introduce a new

concept of labor negotiations, management bargaining with
non-labor»*sensitive management; that perhaps Congress ought
to do that and not the Board, by a decision which two
Circuit Courts have considered and disagreed with.
QUESTION: Well, I take it what you're saying is
that large-scale buying, acquisition, is inherently a
managerial function.
MR. MOOT:

Exactly.

Particularly where cost

cutting is a major part of it.
I should mention that we have copies of the amicus
brief.

We have not filed replies to those briefs, but the

UAW brief, in the last part I think, is wrong when it attempts
to say that this will affect or exclude people now already
covered as technical or professional people.

Nothing in

this case bears on that
Whatever coverage is afforded professional and
technical people, it's not touched by this appeal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.

the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
