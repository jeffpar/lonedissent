MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We’ll resume arguments in

No. 73-78, Mr. McKenzie.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SYDNEY II. McKENZIE, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES.
Mr. McKEN2IE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
Because of part of the argument yesterday, I feel
that it's necessary at this time to clarify some of the facts
in this case.
This is a claim by a widower that he has been
denied equal protection of the law, both by a mandatory selfexecuting provision of the Florida Constitution and by a
statute, providing exemption from ad valorem taxation of
property to the value of $500 yearly for widows, but not for
widowers.
Now, that’s important for two reasons:

one, first

of all, counsel in argument yesterday stated that this was a
deduction from taxation.

In fact, it’s not a deduction, it’s

an exemption to the amount of $500, which, in dollar terms,
translated through the assessment lav/s of Florida, comes out
to about a $15 dollar amount.
Secondly,
QUESTION:
MR. McKENZIE:

What difference does that make?
.We don’t make a de minimis argument.

26

I simply wanted to clarify the fact that it is not a $500
deduction from tax, but -~
QUESTIONs

I thought you were making a distinction

between a deduction and an exemption.
MR. McKENZIE:
QUESTION:

That's right.

Now I ask;

MR. McKENZIE:

That's right.

Is there a difference?

Yes, there is a difference.

The

exemption -QUESTION;

Well, there's a difference, but is

there —■
MR. McKENZIE:
value of the property.

The exemption is from the ad valorem
In other words, if property is worth

ten thousand —
QUESTION:

„1 know what it is.

But I'm asking:

what difference doe3 it make?
MR. McKENZIE:
QUESTION:

It makes a difference —

It makes a difference of about $485.

Isn't that right?
MR. McKENZIE;
QUESTION;

Yes, that's right* Your Honor.

But what legal difference does it make,

is what I'm trying to get at.
MR. McKENZIE:
this particular case.
Your Honor.
Secondly,

No ~ no legal difference, as far as
I merely wanted to clarify the fact,

27
QUESTION;

Actually ~

QUESTION;

A $15 benefit on that, is all it is.

HR. MCKENZIE:

It's a $15 benefit.

I was merely

trying to put it in perspective.
QUESTION; Actually, if the $500 were actually
deductible from the tax bill, you'd refer to it as a tax
credit, wouldn't you?
MR. McKENZIE:

Yes.

QUESTION: Well, yesterday we had another case
involving all kinds of millions of claims of three to ten
dollars.

But the case was here just as well.
MR. McKENZIE:

Yes, Your Honor.

And we're not making

an argument that the case should not be here.
The other question —
QUESTION:

I'm sure you'd rather that it weren't.

MR. McKENZIE;

Yes, sir, Your Honor.

The other question, though, is of more significance.
And that's the fact that we are dealing with, as I say, not
simply a statute but a provision of the Florida Constitution.
And this is significant, in that, as we noted in our brief,
we know of no case providing for this Court or the Florida
Court to expand a provision of the Constitution, to include
members of a class who were not included in the class,
where there is no ambiguity.
And I think that’s important in the discussion

28
yesterday of whether it could be sent back to the Florida
Supreme Court for the purpose of expanding the class in the
statute.

It isn't simply a statute, it's a Florida

constitutional provision that we're dealing with.
QUESTION: Well, as I understand it, the ultimate
conclusion was that firs. Ginshurg, I think, acknowledged that
that wasn't for us to do, that the limit of our function here
was to uphold the provision of the Florida Constitution and
statute, or to invalidate it and if it's invalidated it would
be remanded to the Florida Supreme Court to do with our
decision what it will.
MR. McKENZIE;

Very good.

They’ve made a strong

argument in their brief —
QUESTION:

As to what the Florida Supreme Court

ought to do, but that’s not for us.
mr.

mckehzie

:

Right.

Basically, the State of Florida has two positions:
first of all, that the compelling interest test of the
Frontiero plurality should not be applied to sex classifica­
tion? and, secondly, that the classification of widows, to
the exclusion of widowers, in view of the purpose and the
factual realities of this situation, does not, as applied
to the appellant here, violate ‘the equal protection either —
whether tested by Frontiero in ‘the plurality or by the
standard in Reed, if, in fact, that’s different from

29
■traditional standards, or by traditional tax classification in
sex standards»
And I would address myself first to the traditional
test, because I feel that under that test it's clear that tie
distinction here meets file test.
First of all, the classification we have is the
classification of widows and widowers»

And. the question is:

what is the purpose of that classification?
The State of Florida, as noted by the Florida
Supreme Court, recognizes by this classification that women,
and especially widows, are an economically disadvantaged
class in our society.

This is not. in line with past cases,

where stereotypes were developed for the purpose of so-called
protective legislation for denying women something on the
basis of a stereotype that wasn’t backed up by facts but was
backed up by beliefs that people had, by mythology, really.
It’s not
QUESTION;

it's not based —
You say that women who are economically

dis advan taged?
QUESTION:

Widows»

MR. McKENZXE:
QUESTION;

Widows.

I say that widows, as —*

I thought the statistics were all to

the contrary.
MR. McKENSIEs

The statistics are the contrary —

that widows are to the contrary?

That widows are economically

QUESTION:

Anything but,

Anything but an

economically disadvantaged,
QUESTION: Well, I think what my brother Brennan is
referring to is the fact that widows own a great deal of the
property in the country, but that is because there are many,
many more widows than there are widowers,
MR, McKENZIE:

That’s right,

I would agree with

that.
But I —
QUESTION:

Some widows — some widows are — don’t

have any money and others do,
MR. McKENZIE:
QUESTION:

Well, I think — I think the —

Like widowers,

MR, McKENZIE:

I think that basically the fact is

that, taking a widow and a widower, the general facts are
that a widow has a likelihood, if she must transfer into the
job market, of not being able to earn as much as the widower
simply, if for no other reason, that the fact is that women in
general can only earn — are only earning sixty percent of
what men are earning.
QUESTION;
MR. McKENZIE:

You mean they’re discriminated against.
They're discriminated against.

And I think it’s a recognition of that fact.

The Florida

statute merely — and constitutional provision merely recognizes

31
that women, not because of any inherent problem with women,
but with an inherent problem with our society that hasn’t been
corrected yet, are in fact discriminated against.
QUESTION:

Does Florida give any other provision and

benefit of women in their taxation, other than this?
HR. McKENZIE?
QUESTION?

Yes, sir.

MR. McKENZIE:
QUESTION?

Other than this particular -~

—• provision?

I'm not

Of course I would assume that the widow,

before she becomes a widow, if what you say is true, she
suffers a lot, too.
Does Florida recognize that in its taxing scheme?
MR. McKENZIE:
QUESTION?

Women other than widowers?

[sic]

unh-hunh.

MR, McKENZIE:

I’m not familiar with any provisions

that —
QUESTION: Well, why single out the widows?
MR. McKENZIE?

Well, it was the will of the people

in adopting the Constitution of Florida.
QUESTION?

Well, are the facts, as when the

Constitution was adopted, the same as they are today?
MR. McKENZIE:
QUESTION?

Pardon, Your Honor?

Were women allowed to make contracts

when this Constitution was first adopted?
MR. McKENZIE:

This Constifcution was adopted in

32

1968, Your Honor.
QUESTIONs

Wasn’t there a provision in before then,

in the old Constitution?
MR. MCKENZIE;

Yes.

QUESTION; And it was just carried over.

I’m

talking about when it was —
MR. MCKENZIE:
QUESTION;

It was —

When was it originally in the

Cons titution?
MR. McKENZIE:

1885, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Well, aren’t women a little dispositioned
now than they were in 1885, a little?
MR. McKENZIE:

In a better position now than they

were in 1885?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. McKENZIE:

Yes, Your Honor. But — but clearly

they’re not, by any means, have been given economic equality
in the society. And I think this is a recognition of that.
QUESTION:

But how can you put them in a class?

I would assume that there are some widows in the Palm Beach
area that are a little better off than some widowers in the
upper part of Florida.
MR. McKENZIE;

Well, I think the law has always

recognized that no class is going to be perfect.

Even if we

took a $4,000 limit and said anyone who earns $4,000 or less

33

should get a $500 exemption»

You'd still have —

QUESTION: That's especially true in taxation,, I
assume that's what you said,
MR, MCKENZIE;

Yes, Your Honor.

We'd still have

the problem of saying that there are people who earn $4,000
who have no dependents, and there are people who earn $4,001
who have ten dependents, and they are much more needy.
Obviously, for the purpose of taxation, States have
never been called on to treat every case on an individual
basis.

And I think that —
QUESTION:

Well, of course,

MR. McKEMSIE;

— the Court would recognise that

that's not a practical possibility.
QUESTION;

Of course I recognise that.

trying to get the reason for this singling out.

I'm just
You agree

this is solely on sex?
MR, MCKENZIE:

I would — I would say it's sex as

tied to economic reality.
In other words, the class is not simply, actually -QUESTION:

It's strictly — well —

MR. McKENSIE:
QUESTION:

Except the class isn't
what's the difference between a widow

and a widower, other than sex?
MR. McKENZIE:
QUESTION s

Yeah

Other than sex?

34

MR. McKENZIE:

One, the fact that a widow

widower, being a man, is recognized as having greater earning
potential in our society*
QUESTION:

Is there any way for a widower to

become a widow?
MR. McKENZIE:
QUESTION:

Pardon?

There's no way for a widower to become a

widow.
MR. McKENZIE:

No, there's no way —

QUESTION: So it’s sex.

What's wrong with admitting

it, that it's based on sex?
MR. McKENZIEs

It — it's based — but, see, to

say that it’s based on sex is accurate, but it’s based on
sex plus an underlying recognition of factual difference
between the sexes, and not simply a stereotype difference
between men and women.
QUESTION:

Does this — the same Constitution also

prevented women from serving on juries, didn't it?
MR. McKENZIEs

Yes, it did, Your Honor.

The law of Florida prevented women from serving on
juries.
QUESTION: And now they do.
MR. McKENZIE;

It didn't prevent women from

serving on juries, it —
QUESTION:

Now they've been persuaded to let women

35
serve on juries, haven't they?
MR. McKENZIE:

Women were not prevented from serving

on juries, they had to take affirmative action to indicate
that they desired to serve on juries,
QUESTION: Back in the Nineteenth Century?
In the original —
MR. McKENZIE:

At the time of the Hoyt case, Your

Honor.
QUESTION: At the time of the original Constitution?
MR. McKENZIE: At the time of the original
Constitution of Florida, I'm not prepared to say, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr. McKenzie, are you suggesting that

this is based on economic need?
MR. McKENZIE:

Yes, Your Honor, I'm suggesting that

this case is very little different than Gruenwald vs. Gardner,
which was —
QUESTION: Well, if it's: based on economic need,
why doesn't it say so, instead of putting it on widowhood?
MR„ McKENZIE:
the underlying rationale.

Well, because I think it recognizes
The class is not simply widows.

The class is widows, the blind, and the totally and
permanently disabled.
I think that all of those have the same line of
reasoning running through them for different reasons.
if we're able to — all are economically disabled.

But

HR. McKENZIE:
QUESTION s

It works to benefit the wealthy -—?

Widow®

MR® McKENZIE:

A blind person, also®

QUESTION: The wealthy widow in Palm Beach, and to
disadvantage the poor spinster in Tallahassee»
MR. McKENZIE:

Right.

But the — the fact is

that, as a general abjective analysis, women are not, in
the sense — women and widowers — and widows are not in the
same economic classification as are widowers.

They don't

have the same opportunities„
First of all, a woman who is a widow is either one
of two possibilities:

one, she's the head of the household,

the same as a widower, and in thcit case the distinction is
exactly as I have said, that she has to — she does not have,
as a. general rule, tine job opportunity that the male does.
The other case is where she had been — she’s not
been 'the head of the household, and the widow — and the
husband is the one that dies? and in that case she not only
has to move over into the job market, but she has to get
someone to replace her and trike over the duties that she had,
which is really a double burden, compared to Idle man whose
wife dies, who simply has to replace the functions that his
wife had in the family unit.

She has to do both that and move

37

— move over into the job market»
QUESTION?

And if she moves over into the job

market for the first time at age 55, I suppose her lower
earnings, compared to a widower who may have been in the market
for thirty years, aren't necessarily attributable to
discrimination, she simply hasn't been in the market.
MR. McKENZIE:

She hasn't -- well, they — I would

agree that they aren't —- that that's true.

But they're

even compounded by discrimination, in that the job opportunities
not only to an elderly person but to her particularly are
greatly lessened, both by her age and by her sex.
Now, as to the general classification, the traditional
test, first of all, if the Court is to use that test *•- and
we would submit that it would be appropriate —* in all the
tax casas, where there are tax classifications, there's a
presumption of constitutionality, a heavy burden on one
challenging the classification to show no conceivable
permissible basis.

And it's been recognized that the

classification need not be exact or have mathematical nicety.
Clearly, if the no conceivable, rational purpose
test is to be used, I’d submit that the appellant here has
not met that burden.

Not only is there a conceivable rational

purpose, I submit, but the purpose that we've offered to the
Court is in accordance with tax — a proper tax purpose ?
concern for the economically disadvantaged groups of society.

38

And that that's a valid social concern.
Secondly, under Reed vs. Reed, it’s possible that
that court ~ that that case could be read to say that there
is an additional burden that the court is going to place on
the State where it makes a classification,, and that’s the
burden of justifying a rational classification.
And I submit again that we have not relied on
stereotypes tlx at women are either physically not capable of
doing the work that men are capable of doing,, or that women
are in some way, because they're the creator of children,
that they should stay at home.

We’re not saying that.

We believe that women have all the rights that men
have, but that the facts of our society are that women have
not yet been given those economic rights? and that until they
do, it's appropriate for the State of Florida to have legis­
lation which recognizes that and gives them an affirmative
chance to pull themselves — to attain equality.

refers to

That case specifically, in the footnote,

in footnote 22, I believe it is; states it should

be noted that these statutes — and those are the statutes in
Frontiero — are not in any sense denied — designed to
rectify the effects of past discrimination against women.
Citing Gruenwald vs. Gardner and Jones vs» Maher, and South
Carolina vs. Katzenbach»
And, on the contrary, these statutes siege upon a

40

group, women, who have historically suffered discrimination
in employment, and rely on the effects of this past
discrimination as a justification for heaping on additional
economical disadvantages»
That isn't the case that we have here»

There's no

— there is a — I mean, the second is not the case that we
have here.

There is no purpose nor result of heaping

additional economic disadvantages on women.

There is a

purpose of taking affirmative action, if indeed women are
determined to be a suspect classrelation, to reduce the
results of past historic discrimination.
So that even under Frontiero, I would submit that
it would be appropriate to approve tills classification.
However, I think it's well to point out. to the
Court that **- and we submit that this Court has, in general,
limited suspect classifications to groups which have been
described since Caroline Products as discreet and insular
minorities.
And I would submit that a classification based on
sex does not have within it a discreet and insular minority.
Whether — be it the plaintiff here, who is a
male, seeking to have the statute applied to him, or else
struck down altogether; clearly the male is not. a minority
in a group where men and women are equal.

And if women are

anything ~~ and it would be, I guess, a philosophical minority,

41
in that they've been discriminated against.

But I know of

no case where the Court has found that a philosophical
minority qualifies for strict scrutiny.
proper.

And I think it's

Because any group that is a «— that is a interest

group is a minority, and it may not get everything it wants
out of the judicial process.
And it’s not for the Court, every time some group
other than a racial classification or an easily identifiable
classification like that comes before the Court, to give
strict scrutiny to something that doesn't —* to a statute
tliat doesn’t give that interest group what it wants.
And on those grounds, Your Honor, I would submit
that this classification should be upheld.
QUESTION:

Mr. McKenzie.

MR. McKENZIE s

MR. McKENZIE:

This is a ■— no, it's a tax on both

real and personal property.

It’s on any ad valorem taxation,

which an ad valorem tax in Florida are both on real and
personal property.
QUESTION:

Real and personal property. Then how is

it — how is property appraised down there?
assessed valuation?

What's the

How close to realistic market value?

42

MR* McKENZIE:

It's assessed a hundred — it’s

by Constitution,, it's to be assessed at full market value;
100 percent.,
QUESTION:

Well, what's the practice?

We all

know about those constitutional provisions,
MR, McKENZIE:

Well, that's in the courts now, as

to whether in fact it is assessed at 100 percent of market
value.

In fact, it's, I would say, assessed between 80 and

100 percent of market value,
QUESTION s

Unh-hunh.

Does it vary by counties?
MR. McKENZIE;
QUESTION:

It varies by counties, that’s right,

Usually does.

MR. McKENZIE:

Assessors in the counties do the

assessing.
QUESTION: So this wouldn’t -MR. McKENZIE:

However, to add to that, all

assessments are reviewed for the purpose of equalization by
the Department of Revenues of the State of Florida,
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh,

MR. McKENZIE:

So that theoretically it’s — when

they approve it, it's a determination that that county is at
100 percent of assessed value.
QUESTION: The reason for ray question is, I was
wondering whether this exemption could validly be supported

43
as a provision that might enable a widow to keep her family
home after her widowhood, rather than having to sell it at a
distress sale, if she — if this were real relief from the
real estate taxes on that home.
But it hardly is enough, is it, for that?
MR. McKENZIEs

Well, it's — you know, the question

is, where do you draw the limit?

It might be enough for one

widow
QUESTIONt Well, I know, but —
MR. McKENZIE:

— but it might not be enough for

another.
QUESTION:

— $500 is — and that's the reason I

asked how close to realistic market prices are your actual
appraisal assessments#
MR. McKENZIE:

It is directed at 100 percent of

assessed value, Your Honor.
QUESTION: What's your typical tax rate on real
property, say in Dade County?
MR. McKENZIE:

The rate would generally be thirty

mills, which would translate into a

the thirty mills would

translate into a fifteen-dollar exemption under this.

MR. McKENZIE;
QUESTION;

That’s right# Your Honor.

Mr. McKenzie# in your brief you point

out# relying on Bureau of the Census figures# that 35.8 percent
of the families in Florida# in which a female is the head of
the family, are below the poverty level? whereas# I think it
was about —
MR. McKENZIE;
QUESTION;

Seven percent.

~~ nine percent of the men who head

families that are —
MR. McKENZIE;
QUESTION;

— below poverty level,

MR. McKENZIE;
QUESTION;

That’s right# Your Honor.

That's right# and I think that's —

Are those figures unique to Florida, or

how would they compare with national figures?
MR. McKENZIE;

I would imagine they would — I really

can’t answer that# Your Honor.

Those figures were drawn out

because we ware especially concerned with the Florida situation.
I imagine that they would probably be typical.

I know of no

situation in Florida that would make them atypical on a
national, basis.

But I can’t represent that to the Court.

QUESTION?

Well, you don't have many of those owning

heroes, do you?
MR. McKENZIE:
QUESTION:

Pardon?

You don't have many of those owning

homes.
MR. McKENZIEs The ones below the poverty level, Your
Honor?
QUESTION:

Yes.

They’re mostly renters, aren't

they?
MR. McKENZIE:

Not necessarily in Florida, Your

Honor, because you have a lot of very poor people that are
in —- that own property, in that they own mobile homes.
That's the typical situation in Florida.
in any other State.

Much more so than

I'd say a much larger percentage of those

than in the typical State would be in a position where they
were in property ownership.
QUESTION:

They wouldn't be true up in the turpentine

area.
MR. McKENZIE:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry?

Up* in the fcurpentir.e area, up near the

Georgia, border, they don't own any tiling up there.
MR. McKENZIE:

Well, I live in a turpentine area,

as you call it, Your Honor, and it’s

it's no so much as the

rest of the State, but certainly it's a mobile home area, the
same as any other part of the State.

Although it's not so much

45

of the elderly living there.
So that's part of the problem.
QUESTIONt

But it still ~~ it rates from the

lower person to the highest, anywhere you go? you admit that,
don't you?
MR. MCKENZIE:
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor.

You say that's normal for taxation, and

in some areas it is? it's just a question of whether it's
normal here, where you drawn the line on sex.
Isn't that the real problem?
MR. McKENZIE:

Yes, Your Honor, we submit that —

we submit that this statute is a recognition — this statute
and constitutional provision are a recognition of the economic
realities of the State of Florida.
Thank you, gentlemen.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.

Mrs. Ginsburg, do you have anything further?
MRS. GINSBURG:

Yes, thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have about two minutes

remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. RUTH BADER GINSBURG,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. GINSBURG:

I just thought I'd like to qualify

that mobile homes are not subject to the ad valorem property
tax, Jvrticle 7, Section 1, of the Constitution exempts, along

47
with motor vehicles, mobile homes»
That in
QUESTION?

Of course, not —* this probably

isn't very important, but I know in many States there's an;
argument about what is a mobile home, after it comes to
rest -MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION;

Yes»

— and the wheels come off it, is it

still a mobile home.
MRS. GINSBURG;

Also I would like to qualify the

statement made that this tax is subject «— real property and
personal property are subject to this tax.

That's true in

the constitutional description, but a statute exempts all
households goods and all personal effects for all persons,
whether or not they're heads of families; and that's Florida
Statute 196.181.

In fact, the Legislature has twice

extended this constitutional provision that we're talking
about by ordinary statute.
And then finally with respect to a point that came
up yesterday;

recent models for the disposition that appellant

seeks in this case include per curiam opinion last term in
New Jersey Welfare Rights Organization v, Cahill.

Earlier,

Mr. Justice Blackmun's opinion in Graham v. Richardson„
Both of those opinions dealt with constitutional underinclusive state rather than federal benefit statutes.

And

48

QUESTION;

Mrs, Ginsburg, could I ask a question;

You’re familiar with the DeFunis case to be argued this
afternoon?
MRS. GINSBURG;
QUESTION;

Yes.

This perhaps is an unfair question, but

does your position in this case, with respect to the Florida
classifications, bear in any way on the issues in DeFunis?
MRS. GINSBURG:

Not at all.

The D6*1 *****•£» case raises a. very different issue»
DeFunis is a prograin of a law school that is designed to open
doors to equal opportunity, to assure a law student body,
with diverse backgrounds, an experience, and to rectify the
conspicuous absence of minority groups from the profession.
It is not a welfare dole, based on the assumed inferior
capabilities of any population group, no rigid race line is
presented, as we have here a rigid sex line, race is merely
one of many cha.ract.eristics assessed in that case.
But most significantly, DeFiinia involves no general
law classification.
selection

It’s a measure addressed to very special

problem that law schools have.

Law schools have

the very hard task of choosing some from among many applicants
that are equipped to pursue their educational program.
By contrast, here we’re dealing with a law of

general application, a law with respect to property owners,
where there can be no justification for the true device of
labeling any group, racial, ethnic or sexual, as needy
persons.
An income test is readily available to a Legislature
that wishes to distinguish on the basis of need, and an
immutable birth characteristic should be irrelevant for general
law purposes.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, Mrs.

Ginsburg.
Thank you.
The case is submitted,
[Whereupon, at 10s37 o'clock, a.rru, the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.3
