MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: -We will hear arguments
next in'No. 12-922, Mary-Louise Green Paschal! v. ChristieStewart, Inc.
Mr. Legg, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. LEGG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. LEGG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
This case is an appeal from the Supreme Court 6£
Oklahoma, and it deals with the due process clause of this 14th
Amendment under the Mu1lane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co.
and subsequent cases, concerning notice requirements, and it
also deals with the equal protection clause of the 14th Amend­
ment under interpretations of state law by the Oklahoma Supreme
Court.
Q

When did you first raise the equal protection

issue, Mr. Legg?
MR. LEGG:

I raised it in the brief to this Court

and

the reason for that is that the case — the decision in the
Oklahoma Supreme Court worked what 1 considered an equal pro­
tection situation as compared with the previous case by the
Oklahoma Supreme Court.
Q
ment here?

That had not corns out until the appeal.

Did you raise it in your jurisdictional state­

4
MR. L'SGGI believe X did.

X" couldn't find it there.

X thought it wae

first appearing in your brief.
MR. LSGG:

It may have been the basic brief.

basic point has been all along the notice requirements

Our
under

the Mullane decision, but we thought the equal protection argu­
ment was involved also when the decision by the Oklahoma Supreme
Court came down.
The facts are that the appellants are the successors
in interest of mineral owners under forty acres of land in
Seminole County, Oklahoma,
rights at all.

These mineral owners own no surface

It was strictly severed mineral Interests.

The

Oklahoma law is that the surface owners are committed to pay
the ad valorem taxes, and the mineral owners have no responsi­
bility for that.
In 1952, the surface owner failed to pay the ad valorem
taxes and the county treasurer put the land on the publication
notice for the original sale in 1953,

Now, in Oklahoma, ad

valorem tax sales are an administrative process by the county
officials.

It starts with an original sale when the surface

owner fails' to pay the taxes, and the county treasurer must
place the land on that original sale if the taxes are not paid.
He publishes notice fox' the original sale and in the publication
notice he includes only the description of the land, and' there
is no personal service or process or any mailing or posting on

the land or anything of that nature at the original sale.

At the sal©, there are two ways that it can got

If

there is a bid by an individual-now 1 am speaking of the law
in effect in .1953 -- if there is a bid by an individual, the
individual receives a certificate of paid takes.

If there is

not a bid by an individual, then it is bid off to the countytreasurer and he receives the certificate,
Q

Does any property then pass at that time to the

county?
MR. LEGG:

It is a lien, it constitutes a lien on the

land which I would assume would foe a property interest under the
due process clause in the later decisions.

X believe

there is

a decision that holds that the complete title does not have to
foe ’held to have due process rights.
Q

I take it then you are making no challenge to

the original gale here?
MR. LEGG:

Well, I am making no challenge to the

original sale except that it forms the basis of the entire tax
sale procedure.

And one of my key points is that if there had

been notice given adequate under the Constitution at the
original sale, then we could not argue that there was no notice
at the time of the resale.

But since there wasn't any notice

at the original sale and the resale' in our argument, then we
feel that we have to consider the original sale.
Q

Incidentally, now that I have you interrupted,

6
why i st there a difference between the two statutes?

One calls

for three weeks published notice, the other one for four weeks
published notice.

it makes no difference, I suppose.

HR, LEGG:

X don't know the reason for it.

It is

there, I do know that.
Q

And then the resale, you must name the owner?

MR. LEGG:
Q

At least he was named here?

MR. LEGG;
Q

Xn the resale «—

In the resale, the owner mist be —-

Of the surface.

MR. LEGG:

Of the surface.

Well, it says the owner as appears on the

record© of the county treasurer.

Q

Well, there is only one owner who is ta&es.

MR. LEGG:
Q

So that means the surface, doesn't it?

MR. LEGG;
Q

The surface, the surface owner.

That is what it boils down to, yes, sir.

And in the offices of the treasurer, there is no

record of any mineral owners?
MR. LEGG:

There wouldn’t be in the county treasurer’s

office
Q

What?

MR. LEGG:

There would be none in the county treasurer'

office«

Q
is a —

But nextdoor in the county clerk's office there

7
MI?. LEGG:
Q

That's correct.

— -the mineral interest is recorded?

MR. LEGG:

Correct.

How on that point,- sometimes the records of the county
treasurer have names of owners of the mineral interests but not
in relation to those —* in other words, if they owned another
tract in that county, their names and addresses would appear,
but not in relation to that —
Q

If they ware surface owners in the county?

MR. LEGG:

Q

Sight.

If they were surface owners, yes.
That fact would appear in the treasurer’s

office.

MS. LEGO:

It would appear in the county treasurer's

office, yes, sir.
How, In the resale there also is no requirement for
notice to the mineral owners as such, there is no requirement
for survice of process or posting on the land or mailing or
anything of this nature.
time of the

So what we have is under both at the

original sale and also at the time of'the resale,

we have nothing but publication notice; and in the original
sale there is no naming, there .is just a description of the land,
st the resale there is no notice by naming of the mineral owner
as such.
So at the time cf the '1956 resale, it is our position
that our people had no constructive notice under the Mu1lane

8
decision

and the subsequent decisions.

They had no duty to

pay the taxes to begin with, and their names ware not there.,
except over in the county clerk's office.
Q

What difference would it make if your client

ware a lessee, a long-term lessee, twenty years?
MR. LEGS:

1 would assume that the lessee or

mortgagee would have the same rights under the Mullane decision
as —*
Q

Even though there is no record of tha lease in

the treasurer's office and probable none in the — there may
not be In the

clerk's office.

MR. LSGG:

In the clerk’s office it would be a record

able document, and if it war© a long-term leas® —
Q

Recordable but not necessarily —

MR. LEGGa

It would be recordable — you don't have

to record in Oklahoma.

I mean it is not absolutely necessary

to record in Oklahoma for the validity of the document, in any
event.
Q

But it is against the subsequent owners, I

suppose?
MR. LEGGs ' Yes, in order to forestall third parties,
yes.

You would have to record it.
q

So you would make the same argument as against

lea see s, mortgagees?
MR. LEGG:

I believe we would have to make the same,

9

on principle —
Q

you really would be changing the practice of the

treasurer’s office substantially in *—
MR» LEGG:

Yes., this would -change,• there is no doubt

about that„
Q

It you prevail here, what unsettling effect, if

any- will this have on Oklahoma titles?
MR» LEGG:
Q

Titles.

MR» LEGG:
in Oklahoma.

On Oklahoma what?

Well, I- think it will change the case law

It will probably result in changing the statutory

lav? of Oklahoma.

As far as the upsetting of titles, I believe

it would be limited to a five-year period, because we have a
five-year statute of limitations.

Where there is notice to the

owner —
Q

I gather that while there may be separate owner­

ship of minerals and surface -~
MR. LEGG:
Q

Yes, sir.

— minerals are not separately taxed, are they?

• MR. LEGG:

They are not separately taxed until they

become productive.
Q

Right *

MR., LEGG;

At that time, there is an in lieu of pro­

duction. tax.
Q

But in what we ar© talking about here, this

10
situation, they are net?
MR. 1SGGs
Q

This is a non-productive situation.

But, as I understand it,

non-payment of taxes

by the surface owner results in the sals not only of the
surface rights but also the mineral rights?
MR. XiBGG:

That is the construction placed upon these

statutes by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.
Q

All right.

MR. LEGG:

How, X might say in relation to production

that the land has subsequently —
Q

Sven though under your Oklahoma law the mineral

interest is separately recognised under the law?
MR. LEGG:

It is a separately owned property interest,

yes, sir.
Now, I would like to say this —
Q

Perhaps, with respect to my question, which you

ware in the course of answering, your opponent will comment on
it when he is up as to the unsettling effect., if any, upon
Oklahoma —
MR. LEGG:

Yes, back to that, I think the statute of

limitations is the barrier to a full discruption of all titles
in Oklahoma.

I think the Shroeder case can be read to the

effect that the statute of limitations would not apply.

But I

think in our land title situation, the difference is that the
party, the tax sale purchaser goes into possession of tha

11
surface.

Now, at that point ho sets up his notice even though

there hasn’t been notice through the statutory procedure, he
sets up his notice by physically occupyhing the surface of the
land and so the five-year statute would run as against owner­
ship of the surface .
Now,.as far as the mineral rights are concerned, it
is our view that that occupation of the — occupancy of the
surface is not notice, it is not occupancy of the mineral
rights until there is actual drilling there, because there is
v-

. •-

• S

nothing to put anyone on notice or to put the severed mineral
owner on notice that his rights are being claimed by someone
else,

.The surface owner, the occupancy of the surface puts

that person on notice.

So that if you don’t have constitutional

: r.

notiae under the tax sale procedure, going into possession sub­
stitutes that as notice as far as the surface owner is con­
cerned.

But in order to — if you don’t have constitutional

notice during the tax sale to the mineral owners, and someone
goes into possession of the surface without going into
possession of th© minerals, there is nothing to put the mineral
owner on notice.

There is no substitution through possession

that 'puts him on notice.

He has to rely on someone actually

drilling a hole there or mining, or whatever it takes.
Q

Then, in answer to my question, with respect to

mineral rights there will be a chaotic result in Oklahoma if
you prevail here?

12
MR. 1-EGG:

Well; if there has bean an attempt to

explore, there will not be chaos.

For those on those tracts of

land that have been explored, the statute of limitations will
start running and there will be a five-year period.

For those

mineral interests that have not been explored, there has bean
no action taken to take the mineral rights under possession,
and if there was no statutory notice given, constitutionally
effective, then their position would be the same as it always
has been.

They would still be owned by the former owner.
0

If you go back four years, now, into a tax sale

'of what you are describing as a non-productive mineral interest?
MR. LEGS:

Well, are you referring to the forty-year

statute in Oklahoma?
Q

I just guessed»

MR. LEGG:

Well, there is a thirty-year land statute

in Oklahoma, but it doesn’t apply to mineral rights.
Q

Well, would there — you say that because the

mineral owner doesn't have notice from a new surface claimant
going into effect, does the five-year — the five-year statute
doesn't apply to him.

Is there any statute that would operate

on the non-product mineral claim?
MR. LEGG:

The case law in Oklahoma on the statute of

limitations is that the possession of the surface is not
possession of the minerals, except in the cas© of a resale tax
deed, not in the case of a certificate tax deed, but only in

13
the case of a rasa!® tax. deed, and this is where the equal pro­
tection of the law comes into my argument.
0

!t®t me ask one more question, if I may, to try

to wind up this on© aspect.

Than as to a non-producing mineral

interest, there isn’t any statute of limitations in Oklahoma
that would bar a man going back and making this constitutional
claim that you make here with respect to a sale that had taken
place twenty, thirty or forty years ago?
HR. LEGS:

There is no statute of limitations except

in the case of a resale tax deed, which we have here, as con­
strued by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.
Q

And what is the statute of limitations for a re­

sale tax deed?
MR. SJ2GG:
Q

That would be five years.

But that requires some sort of notice, doesn't

it, going into possession?
MR. LEGGs
Q

There are no notice —

But you were equating going into possession on

the part of the surface claimant with a form of notice to the
•former owner that would start the statute running.
MR. LEGGs
Q

Yes.

■

There is no analogous going into possession with

respect to a non-productive mineral interest, is there?
MR, LEGSi

You would have to drill or you would have

to take possession of the mineral rights in some way, yes.

And

u
this is established, case law in Oklahoma.
Q

Yob, but if you had — the only time the ques­

tion of starting the statute of limitation comes up for the
resale tax deed is if you have an invalid one supposedly, isn't
it?
HR. hEGGi
Q

Hot under Walker

v. Hoffman.

Because I thought the law was that the resale

tax deed was valid, against fch® mineral interests-without
notice at all.
MR. LSGG:

Ho.

Under Walker v, Hoffman, which was a

certificate tax deed case, the court held, the Oklahoma Supremo
Court held that possession of the surface xs not possession of
the minerals.

Yen.

MR. LEGGj

ted consequently the tax deed, if it is

invalid in its inception, is invalid.

But there is language in

that aam© case — it didn't deal with the resale situation —
i

but there is language in that same case that holds to the
effect — says we will hold that if it is a resale, then it is
a completely new7 title and possession of the surface will —
Q

Is notice to the mineral interests?

MR. LEGG:
Q

— is notice to the mineral interests.

ted so that would — even if the tax deed, resale

tax deed were invalid for some reason —
MR, LEGG:

Yes.

IS

Q

—- it would still start to — possession, of the

surface would still start the five-year statute running?
HE. LEGS:
Q

To that, I assume that is what —

And on that basis, if Oklahoma — if you won this

case and Oklahoma stuck to that rule, the unsettling effect on
mineral- interests would just be five years?
MR. IiEGGj
Q

That's true, except that ~~

Well, X «said if Oklahoma stuck to that rule.

MR. LEGO;

If it did, but this gets into my equal

protection argument.

Q

X understand that, if they stuck to the rule.

MR. LEGG:

Q

That9s correct.

That is not true of a certificate of sale though,

is it,- as opposed to a resale?
MR. LEGG:
0

A certificate tax deed —

A certificate tax deed.

MR. LEGG:

—* the possession of the surface is not

possession of the minerals.
Q

So there the unsettling affect could go back in­

definitely?
MR. LEGG;

Yes, but that is decided law in Oklahoma.

That was the vfelker v. Hoffman case exactly, is that this lady X believe it was a lady — owned the minerals rights and the tax
the certificate tax deed purchaser claimed the mineral rights.

Q

This case won't upset that — won't affect that

16
rule*

That is already the rule in Oklahoma?
MR* LEGG:
Q

That is already the rule in Oklahoma.

Mr. Legg* would you refresh my recollection as

to how the county would have been abler as a practical matter,
to give notice to the owners of the mineral rights upon whom, no
taxes are assessed?

Would that have required a title examina­

tion?
MR. I-EGGs

That will require, if the mineral owner*a

name and address is not in the county treasurer's office, he
would have to go to the county clerk's office to find it.
Wow ~~
Q

But when he went to the county clerk’s office,

would ha have to go through the land books examining'titles?
or a lawyer would?
MR. LEGG:

He would have to go to the indexes of the

land records to find out who claims the minerals or if any arc
outstanding.
Q

That could go back —

MR. LEGG:
right.

It could go back to statehood, yes.

That's

But the fact is that the mineral interest is a separately

owned interest, separately owned property, and that property
owner has received no notice that his rights are in jeopardy.
Q

I understand that.

I was just curious that

there appears to be no provision either for taxing the owners
o~ the mineral righto or providing soma readily available list

17
so that the authorities would know who they are,
MR, 1-EGG:
Q

In our state they tax them.

MR. LEGG:
Q

That5» true.

Bag pardon?

I just said in Virginia they tar the owners of:

mineral rights,
MR. LBGG:

Yes, in a number of states’they do.

In

Oklahoma, they become taxable in the event of production.

Q

What I am unclear on is what right does the state

have to extinguish this right if there is no duty to pay taxes?
MR. LEGG:
Marshall.

Well, this is part of our argument, Justice-

We have no duty to pay taxes, the severed mineral

interest,
Q

You don’t owe tha sfeats anything,

MR, LEGG:
Q

Under tha state law, taxing law, we don't,

But you lose your property.

MR. LEGG:

But it is a separately owned property in­

terest and it is lost if the surface owner fails to pay the
taxos *
0

What do you have to

say about the obligation of

the owner of these mineral rights to keep some track of whether
the taxes are being paid by the surface owner?

Shouldn't he

ought to pay a little attention to that., since his rights
could be extinguished?
MR, LEGG:

I believe he should, yes, sir.

X think

18
that, since h© has no duty, it would be an ordinary and reasonable assumption on his part that his surface owner is paying
the taxes, and that is about all 1 can say about that, because

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOE 8. ROLSTON, III, ESQ.,

m BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. ROLSTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and way it please

the Court:
s’

*

I believe it is absolutely imperative that tha chron­
ological order of facts as to how this case reached this Court
be spelled out.

First, wa are dealing with forty acres of

land in Seminole County., as Mr. Legg has indicated.
became delinquent for four years.

The taxes

The first delinquency occurred

in 852 and subsequently until 855.
V/';

I-

In *56 a resale — in 1956. a resale tax deed was
issued in May to the appellees.

If was filed of record on Juno

6» 1956 > and it covered, in addition to the forty acres, some
twelve other parcels of real estate.

Thereafter, in 1963, the

appellees executed and oil and gas lease to Christie-Stawart
Oil Company, who was actually the party plaintiff when this
litigation first arose.
During the period from 1956 until 1965, when the law
suit was filed, the trial court found that the appellees had
bp,«n open, notorious, adverse and in continuous possession of
the property.

And one of the elements of the holding of the

trial court was that the claims of the appellants was barred
by the statute of limitations.
The suit by the oil company was filed in 1965 in order
to perfect their lease, because their attorneys who examined the

22
title of course realized that this was a resale tar deed and
there was always a degree of uncertainty about its validity.

The appellants then filed an answer and a cross
petition and brought in the appellees as parties defendants.
The appellees then filed an answer to the cross petition in
which they specifically raised the statute of limitations#
that the appellants were barred.
The first issues in the case, the validity of the oil
and gas lease, was adjudicated by the trial court in 1965, and
then for some reason unknown to myself, since 1 was not person­
ally involved in the original trial, the issues as between the
appellant and the appellees was not decided until 1969.

During

that period, an oil well was drilled upon the property and
production had, and 1 am sure this keenly increased the in­
terest of all parties when that occurred.

1 think it is also absolutely necessary that this
Court hmr® a crystal clear understanding of the statutory pro­
cedure of tax sales in Oklahoma.

First of all, the statutes

hold that it is the burden of the taxpayer to some forward and
pay his taxes.

Q

As to the surface owner, right?

MR. KOLSTOH;

As to the surface owner, yea. Your Honor,

to come forward and pay the taxes.

Mr. Lsgg is correct in that

non-producing oil and gas interests are not subject to the ad
valorem tax.

They are deemed included in the surface.

Only

23
when production first arises do severed minerals bear any ad
valorem tax, and that is in lieu of tax for gross production.
After the taxes become delinquent, there is a certi­
ficate sale which occurs.

At that time, the county treasurer

runs a publication setting forth the'legal description of the
property and the amount of tax due.
and buy a certificate.
upon the land.

Any party can then come in

This allows the party to have a lien

One of the requirements at that time is that the

purchaser must pay the full amount of the tax.' So at that
period the county treasurer has collected his tax.

He has per­

formed his service as required by law and collected 100 cents
on the dollar for the delinquent taxes. ■ The certificate holder
then is required to hold the tax certificate for at least two
years and any time after two years and before ten years, which
bars the certificate by statute of limitations, he may apply to
the county treasurer for a fax deed.

Now, the specific statute

that gives the tax certificate holder that right provides that
ha will obtain, upon receipt of the tax deed from the county
treasurer, a perfect title

provided that the tax certificate

holder give notice to all of the owners of the property, not
owners as reflected by the records of the county treasurer’s
office but all of the owners.
Q

Therein lies the distinction —

The mineral owners as well as —

MR. RGLSTOM:

That is correct.

The Oklahoma Supreme

Court has by numerous cases held that the tern "owner" as used

24
in that statute, in placing that burden upon the tax certificate
holder, includes the mortgagee, it includes any lien holder, it
includes severed mineral interests and so forth.
Now, Hr. 1-egg has referred to some confusion between
the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in the case involving a tax cer­
tificate deed when it did not.- apply the statute of limitations.
The distinction in that case is that it was a certificate deed,
and it was stipulated in that case that the tax certificate
.holder, when he applied for the tax deed, did not give the
statutory notice to the then mineral owner, and the court said
that one of the conditions precedent to you acquiring your
perfect title is that you fulfill your obligation by statuto
and give the notice, and therefore since you did not give the
notice the mineral holder's interest was never acquired by your
certificate deed, therefore, having never acquired his interest,
•the statute of limitations would not run because you were not in
possession of hie interest, having not acquired it under the
deed.
Q

What is the name of the case that so held?

MR. ROLSTCN:

Walker v. Hoffman, Your Honor, as set

forth in our brief.
Now, if, as Mr. X*egg has indicated, if there are no
bidders at the tax sale, then the property is bid in by the
county treasurer and he is required by law to hold the taxes
for two years.

During this period of time, anyone having any

interest.in the property is free to redeem it.

The Supremo

Court has also held that a non-producing mineral holder may
redeem taxes at any time and thereby obtains a lien upon the
interest of the surface owner and may enforce that lien by
equitable foreclosure.
Q

Well, is it your argument then that any due pro­

cess requirements are satisfied by the requirement that in order
to get a perfect title, the holder of the certificate must give
notice to everyone, including —«•
MR. RGLSTOH:
Q

That is correct.

— the mineral owner?

MS. , RQLSTON:

And I don't think Mr. Legg would raise

any issue about our present statutes on tax —

My question is, your answer to the due process

claim is that due process is satisfied by that provision of your
law?

MR.. ROLSTON:
Q

Yes.

MR. ROLSTON:
owner.

As to the tax certificate, yes, air.

Because it does require notice to the

Now, when, th© property then moves on to the county

treasurer, then th® county treasurer, under the law

as it

existed'at the time this deed was issued, is required to pub­
lish after two years cf no redemption, he is required to
publish, and at that time the name of the owner as reflected by
the records of the county treasurer appears in the publication,

and a legal description of the property# and the amount of the
tax due# and I believe there may be some other minor: things.
But there is —

Q

By the owner# do you mean the surface owner?

MR. ROXiSTON:

The surface owner.

Wall# that is the

only record in the county treasurer's office# is the name and
address of the party who is paying the fax# in that case it is
the surface owner.

In many cases# if there.are undivided in­

terests in the surface owner# they may have more than one name.
Now# it is interesting to note that in 1965, the
Oklahoma legislature changed the statute on resale tax deed
requiring not only publication but also a mailing of a notice
to the owner as reflected by the county assessor’s office.

Now#

it is the position of the appellees that this clearly was an
application of the Oklahoma legislature of the rules of Mu1lane
and subsequent cases# sines prior to that time the surface
owner# even though he paid the tax# the only notice given was
a publication notice.

And 1 think if X was in a position to

have to argue before this Court that that was the same situa­
tion with the mineral owners in Mullane and the other cases, X
could not prevail.

Clearly, X think the legislature in '65#

when they amended the statute and required not only publica­
tion with the owners name in it# but also mailing to his last
known address

as reflected by the records of the county

treasurer# they complied with Mullar.e or were attempting to

27

comply with Mulleae
0

But again that personal kind of notice under the

’65 amendment was a notice only to the surface owner, wasn’t it?
MR. RGLSTOM:

That is correct.

Now, 1 think the Court

must recognise that Oklahoma is a major producer of oil and gas.
It has been so for a number of years.

Great industries exist

in Oklahoma based upon the production of oil and gas.

People

since statehood have become cognizant and aware of the value of
mineral interests, and thus it is the exception rather than the
rule in Oklahoma nowadays that you find a piece of ground which
the minerals have not been severed, and in many cases if there
has been production that has ceased, you may find thousands,
literally thousands of various owners, the interest of which
is almost beyond imagination.

And I am not aware as to whether

any justices have had occasion to examine a title for oil and
gas and render an opinion, but I assure the court that- it reis alts in sometimes-interests that

you have to use a ■ computer

to determine the sis.;©.
Now, based upon counsel’s argument for the appellants,
V

all of these individuals would be entitled to notice.

What yea’re suggesting is that the 15/16 and

MR. R0&STON:

No, Your Honor, it could be out as many

as seven or eight decimal places.

many of the original oil and gas pools in Oklahoma arcs no
longer producing and the minerals then became non-producing,
and subject again to ad valorem tax by the surface.

Mr. Rolston, as a practical matter, when someone

•V.'

4

All of the oil companies in purchasing leases

v

rely upon abstracts by bonded abstractors who are ©xaminsd by
an attorney.

These abstracts are compiled by the abstractor

going to the county records, searching out all of the various
instruments that have been recorded.
Q

The county clerk, too?

MR. ROLSTON;

The comity dork —- wall, the county

clerk is charged with the responsibility of recording instru­
ments.

All deeds, mortgages, leases, anything affecting the

property -Q

This is not limited to the county auditor's

record, then?
MR. ROLSTONs
Honor.

No, it is called county clerk, Your

23

Q

.

That would then flush out. any — presumably it

would flush out any claim of the subsurface rights?
MR, jROLSTON:

That's correct.

It would reflect any

mineral deads if the abstractor was instructed to obtain that
type of abstract.

It is possible to abstract a piece of

.property only as to the surface and omit the minerals which
in many cases because of the sise of the abstract, that is
done.

But at this point I would point out that one of my

arguments is the great difficulty that counsel for the appellant
asked this Court to place upon the county treasurer.

Oklahoma

is a tract index state, that is when I walk in and I file a
deed covering a certain piece of property, reference to that
deed is- first mad® in the recaption record, indicating that it
was tendered for recording.

Then it is mechanically put on an

index book in particular the quarter section, township, range
and

bo

forth, indicating that on a certain data & certain

warranty dead to somebody from somebody covering a certain
property was recorded.

That deed is then reproduced photo­

graphically in. another book and page in another book, in order
to find the details of the conveyance, such as the interests
covered, and so forth, and any addresses that might appear,
would require first of all that a party go to the track index
book, research the title from patent forward to .determine where
a particular dead cams into the chain of the title, or any
particular deeds covering minerals, or which might purport to

30

cover minerals, or might be overriding royalty interests, cr
f

some type of reservation of life, estate, or so forth, in the
minerals»

Then the party would have -to take the book and page

of each of these instruments, go then to the general recording
data and examine each of the instruments in order to find out
exactly what an instrument said, because the reference in the
track index book is merely to the date it was recorded, the.
nature of the instrument, whether it b© warranty deed, mineral
deed, quit claim deed, mortgage, and the nairas of the grantor
and the grantee, and the legal description of the property.
Q

Do you have a separate grantor-grantee index in

your county recorder’s office?
MR, ROLSTONi
Q

Yes, Your Honor, there is.

Mr. Polston, what is the interest of the state in

extinguishing the mineral rights?
MR, ROLSTON:
0

In my opinion. Your Honor —■

You put great emphasis on the deed of the county

clerk to collect every nickel of taxes.

You said that.

Well,

once you have collected all of the taxes, what is the interest
in extinguishing the other rights?
MR. ROLSTOfl;

All right, I will explain it this way.

Your Honor, that if the county is not required to bid at the tax
certificate sale, the county is done with the thing!

It is up

to the individual tax certificate holder to proceed further if
he wants to acquire the property.

If there are no bidders and

31
the county is required by lav to bid the property, we than go
to the resale.

At the resale, you can buy the property for

anything lens than wh&t the tax is due or anything more,

'fini

it is my.©pinion -- and, of course, not being a member of the
legislature, X don’t know the reasoning behind it — but it is
my opinion, in order to make it, attractive, since the taxes are
noq delinquent for four years, for a person to bid at the resale,
the legislature deemed it advisable if you bid then the county
will give you a perfect virgin title to that property, and that
is to encourage bids, since they have already been around one
time and received no bids and the second time out the county can
sell it for less than the taxes due, or more if there are a
number Of bidders, but at that point if the county does not *-«
*)

if there are no bidders at the resale, then the county is re*
quired to bid it in, and it is dead to-the county commissioners.

HP.. ROLSTON:

conceivably happen, Your Honor.

{Laughter]
Q

$hat happens with this producing mineral interest?

MR. RCLSTOHs

The law is very clear in Oklahoma.

Producing mineral interests are

the gross production tax,

the taxes do not cover producing minerals.
Q

They don’t cover producing minerals and they are

32
separately owned?

The only difference is that they airs produc­

ing and they are taxed separately?
MR. ROLSTGN;

Q

That is correct.

tod the fractional interests are. taxed separately?

MR. ROLSTO&t

Well, the amount of production deter­

mines the amount of tax.
Q

I know, but who pays it?

MR. ROLSTON;

Well, it is taken out by the oil com­

panies at the time before they ever turn the money over to the
royalty owner.

Q

So that on producing mineral interests, the

treasurer never knows who owns the mineral interests?
MR. ROLSTGN:
0

it is just .the operator?

MR. ROLSTGN:

Q

As 1 understand the operation —

The producer of the —

The working interest gets hit for like a sales

MR. ROLSTON;
ing of that operation.

That is correct.

That is my understand­

But I would point out, X think we rely

most heavily on the.ease of Leigh v. .Green, which wo realise is
a very old case, but I still think it is very sound.

And of

the basic points of that case, the court there said the .process
of taxation does not require the same kind of notice as is
required in suit of law, or oven in proceedings for the taking
of private property under the power of eminent domain, it

33

involves no violation of due process of law when it is exe­
cuted according to customary forms and established usages, or
in subordination fc© the principles which underly them.
Wow, 1 submit that the form of procedure employed in
Oklahoma has been that way since statehood, for more than
sixty years, that this — almost this exact procedure, except
as slightly changed in 1365, has bean in process.
Q

What case is that you are reading from?

MR. RQLS'TON:
Q

Is that cited in your brief?

MR. ROLSTGWi

That is Leigh v. Green.

Yes, it is.

193 U.S„, isn’t it? , Is that the on®?

MR. R0L6T0N2

Yes, it is a case involving Nebraska's

tax law and which Involved a land holder on a piece of property
in an administrative sal®, and they dealt that this case was in
rein and; created a new and independent title.

Now, I realize

.V
that this Court apparently in Mullane indicated that, whether
*.

it was in rem or in personam was not necessarily the criteria
for determining whether, you know, you were entitled to personal
notice or whether the publication notie® was sufficient.

But I

submit that this Court did not destroy the distinction between
the two.

It merely said that it is not necessarily controlling,

arid I have no quarrel with that decision.
Q

Mr. Ralston, if the owner of & producing mineral

interest becomes delinquent in his obligation to pay the lieu

I do not know ih© answer to that ques­

tion »
Q

fall, how doss the state enforce the obligation

of a delinquant owner of a producing interest to pay the lieu
tax?
MR. ROLSTON:

Wall# the producer,, that is the party

who is operating the well and collects the money from the sale
pays it directly to the state.
Q

What if he doesn’t pay it?

MR. ROLSTONs

When 1 receive my royalty check, if I

was fortunate enough to own minerals that were producing, it

would show the gross production, less gross production tax, net
to me,, and that is all I would receive.
Q

Well, what i£ the operator who is obligated to

pay the tax, as'the producer for all these people, doesn’t pay
it?

what■does the state do?

1 am not familiar with the procedures

they employ in that type of situation.

MR. R01ST0N:

Xfc is certainly an oversight on my

parti- your Honor, because I have always considered that my
stalwart case.
Q

On® other questions

X listened to your descrip­

tion of' checking tit las, and this sounded to me just exactly
like one checks titles in any other state.
MR. ROLSTOH:

Thera are some states which do not use

abstracts of titles and employ private companies to search.
Q

But I wondered about the significance of your

displaying or outlining this detailed checking title's.

Xfc

doesn't seem fee me to he particulary onerous or unusual.
MR. R0L5TO2!:

Ho, Your Honor.

X' wanted the Court to

b?r absolutely certain as to the burden they would place upon
fc.be county treasurer if they required the county treasurer to
embark upon a search, bearing in mind it would not necessarily
be one property but could bo hundreds of properties that were
then delinquent.

And X feel like that is a burden that this

Court has not required under Mullano or subsequent case.
Q

You do say that Oklahoma law puts the burden on

the private purchaser before he gets a perfect title?

36

MR. ROXsSTON:
0

‘That's correct.

To give everybody notice, which means he has to

go all through the process of searching, as you have described
it, but that tha Oklahoma law does not put that burden on the
county treasurer if he is the on© who gets the title, all he has
to do is give the public published notice and there he names, as
j.

•

'<

•

1 understand it — that is the resale, isn’t it — he names only
the surface owner?
MR. ROLSTON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

The dis­

tinction X draw there, the tax has been sold, the state is no
longer Involved, it is a private individual and there is a
distinction between a private individual enforcing a right he
has obtained from the stats, in my mind, and the right of the
state to still attempt to collect the tax.
Q

Well, X take it that we still have to decide

whether in tha casa of the acquisition on resale by the
treasurer, who gives only the published notice you describe,
whether that satisfies Mullane and duo process, don’t we?
MR. RGLSTOHs

If the Court does not feel that the

statute of limitations has barred tha appellants’ right of
recovery, which 1 strongly believe it has, that the lower court
*

found.* 1 cannot explain to this Court in any way why the inter­
mediate court of appeals and the Supreme Court of Oklahoma made
no reference to the finding by tha trial court that the statute
of limitations barred it.

37
Q

We.11, this io an argument that the issue isn’

even here.
HR. ROLSTON:

I raise it simply because I think the

record shows it.
0

The Supreme Court of Oklahoma didn’t treat it in

its opinion though, did it?
MR. ROLSTON:

Ho, Your Honor.

We were there on

certiorari from an adverse decision to the appellees by ths
intermediate court of appeals of the State of Oklahoma, which
reversed the trial court.
Q

Do you have any comment on my question to your

opponent about the unsettling effect of
MR. ROLSTOHs

a

reversal here?

Yes, Your Honor, I certainly do and

would like to comment that — and 1 cite in my brief Boraford
v. Socony Mobil oil Co., which is a Supreme Court case for •
Oklahoma, where they applied the Malians rules to service by
publications, and 1 would like to read to the Court the last
paragraph of that case,

it saysj

"Mindful of our duty to

guard against any attempt to upset settled titles by imposi­
tion of new requirements which did not exist before, we declare
that all procedural modifications enunciated herein shall not
b© construed as invalidating the publication process in this
case or in any caso in which the trial court’s judgment shall
have been rendered before the.opinion becomes final."
Now, 1 submit that if this Court holds that the

33
statute of limitations has.no application, then every tax deei
issued, ©very resale tax deed issued in the State of Oklahoma
since statehood is subject to attack*

That is not the problem, is it?

Isn’t that a

state law question?
MR. ROLSTQN:

The statute of limitations?

MR. RQLSTOH:

Court would do to titles within the State of Oklahoma.

Well, you say there was a finding that the

MR. ROLSTONs

That was the trial court's — one of

the trial court*8 principal findings, as appears in the
Appendix, the trial court's judgment.

That is correct.

How, there are

Oklahoma cases which relied upon that, the most recent of which
was offered to this Court in 1949 and was rejected, Cornelius v.
Jackson, X believe the ease was.

But I have no dispute, Your

39

Honor, with the Court's rulings in Muliana or City of New York
or Covey

or Walker or Wisconsin or Schroder, I have no objec­

MR. ROLSTON:

And then there was a Kansas case, too?

MR. ROLSTON;

Q

Yes, Your Honor.

There was a Kansas case very similar.

Robinson v. Hanrahan.

MR. ROLSTON:

But X respectfully submit that the

record in this case does not present sufficient fact to allow
the Court to apply the rule in Mullane.

The rule in Muliana

simply says if the names are known or if they are very easily
ascertainable, then you must give personal notice or something
better than publication.

There are absolutely no evidentiary

facts in 'this case that would warrant this Court of saying that
the rule should be blanketly applied, no facts at all.

One

witness testified at the trial, there were certain stipulations
that no personal notice was received.

1 think it would be ex­

tremely dangerous for the Court to embark upon a strict applica­
tion of Mullane without having that -evidentiary fact before the

that you were barred by the statute of limitations anyway?
MR. L3GG:

Thera is a finding that the statute of

limitations ran, yes, sir, but it was not argued in the appeal
to the Court of appeals, and it was not argued and no decision
was m&da and it was not argued in the Supreme Court of Oklahoma
and no decision was made In —
Q

Were you the one that went to the Court of

Appeals?
MR. LSGtS:
Q

And you didn’t appeal from that finding?

MR. LK6G 5
Q

Yes, we appealed it.

Ho.

Then when the Supreme Court restored the trial

court's judgments, those findings remained extant, is that not
correct?
MR. hEGG:

Yes.

May I make three explanations.

The

reason for the four-year gap in the pursuit of this case that
Mr. Rolston noted was that there were some ■ ©states pending
and it wasn’t carried forward until those estates were closed.
Then I would also Ilk© to point out that Oklahoma is
the least — is an example of the least strict tax foreclosure

procedure in the United States.

It is strictly judicial —• I

mean strictly administrative, it has no — you'don't have to
ever go into court, you don’t have to ever give any notice ex­
cept this publication service.

And there are eleven-states in

that category# according to my research, and there are fourteen
states however that have fully judicial tax lien foreclosure
procedures, where you have to bring all parties into court and
foreclose it just like you. would a mortgage, and in that situ­
ation there would have to be process issued to everyone.
And so we have eleven states with least strict, four­
teen states with most strict, and we have thirty-nine states
either most strict, or somewhere in the middle where they have ~~
even though they are using

an

administrative proceduref they

have to give notice, either formal service, formal process or
mailing, or some nature that gees'beyond just the publication
in this case.

If I may, let me go back to this, your appeals

up through the stats court system.

You did not appeal from

this finding that the statute of limitations barred you?
MR. LEGG:
0

We appealed —

That is, to the intermediate court.of appeals,

you did not bring this up?
MR. LEGG:

We appealed from the decision, we did not

specify that particular — it is my recollection that there is
nothing in our appeal document that touches on that, but I

wouldn't want to be bound by that statement.

There may be

something that — we appealed from the total decisione but our
basis of appeal, our strong argument was on the basis of
Mu1lane, and that was from the very first.

This particular

point was not contested strongly, it may have been touched
upon, but it wasn't —
Q

Well, what good would it do yon to win on Mu1lane

if under state law you wars barred anyway by the statute of
limitations?

2 mean why did you appeal cn just Mu1lane?

It

wouldn’t do you any good.
MR. LF.GG:

We felt that there was a constitutional

issue her©, and this was what we ware primarily concerned with.
G

If you are right on the constitutional issue,

than the statute of limitations couldn't have started to run
hocause you wouldn’t have had adequate notice on the —
MR. LEGG:

That was one argument ~~

That was the same as in the Schroder case, as 1

remember it.

That is exactly right.

The Schroder case would stand --

There was a claim there of the statute of

have the notice.
MR. LEGG:

You're right.

There was a previous Oklahoma case that said

An Oklahoma decision, yes.

You didn't attack that, did you?

Yes.

There is dictum on that point in Walkver v.

When was that decided?

That was a 1955 case.
