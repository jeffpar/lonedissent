MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument next

in No, 72~6476, Hagans against Lavine,
You may proceed whenever you are ready, Mr. Nathanson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL JAY NATHANSON ON
BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. NATHANSONs

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please

the Court, the Second Circuit did not determine this case on
the merits.

The court concluded that because the complaint

failed to plead a substantial constitutional question, the
District Court was without pendent jurisdiction to determine as
it did that the New York welfare regulation, violated the Social
Security Act.

Because of the procedural posture of this case,

therefore, two questions are presented to this Court.
The first question is a narrow one:

Were the

pleadings raised nonfrivolous -QUESTION:

Let me get this straight.

question in pendent jurisdiction terms?

You state the

Tell me the question

that you want to be pencent?
MR, NATHANSON;

The pendent question was whether or

not the New York welfare regulation violated the Social Security
A.et,
QUESTION s

You think that's ■— why do you need to

resort to pendent jurisdiction?
MR. NATHANSON:

I don't think you need to resort to

pendent jurisdiction.
QUESTION:
that pendent?

Why do you say so then?

Why do you call

Isn't that a Federal question in itself?

MR. NATHANSONs

The lower court determined that the

district court lacked jurisdiction to pass upon that pendent
claim because of the absence of a substantial constitutional
claim.
QUESTION;

I know, but you say it was a pendent claim.

It isn't pendent at all, is itjif you don't need a constitutional
claim, it isn't pendent, is it?
MR. NATHANSON;

It would not be pendent, your Honor.

QUESTION:

If you need a constitutional claim,
it
you. just can't consider/whether it is pendent or not.
MR.

NATHANSONs

Your Honor, before the court can

determine whether or not it's correct to characterize that as
a

pendent claim, it would first have to pass upon the

second aspect of our argument
QUESTION:

Which is what?

MR. NATHANSONs

Which is that absent a constitutional

claim, the district court had jurisdiction under 1343(3) and
1343(4) of an action founded on 1983 of the Civil Rights Act
to determine the Social Security Act claim without regard to
whether or not -QUESTIONs

MR. MATHAMSOM %
QUESTION:

I think that any time ~~

If there is a constitutional claim, the

only basis for considering the statutory claims is pendent
jurisdiction?
MR. MATHANSONs

No, your Honor, I don't.

I believe

there is independent Federal jurisdiction for determining that
claim.
QUESTION:

You claim that the Federal Social Security

statute, then, is in effect one of the laws described bysection 1343 as enacted to protect civil rights,
MR, NATHANSOM:

I contend, your Honor, that the

Social Security Act is one of the laws described by section 1983,
and when a State acts to deprive a citizen of Federal rights
under color of State law, therefore, this jurisdiction to
hear that remedy under 1343(3) and 1343(4).
QUESTION s

Not because of the constitutional supremacy

clause, but just because a Federal right is conferred by
Federal statute.
MR. NATHANSON s Yes, your Honor,
QUESTION:

Why isn’t it a constitutional claim in

itself under the supremacy clause?
MR. NATHAMSON:
QUESTION:

It would be a constitutional claim.

You just said it isn't for the purposes of

a three-judge court statute.

6
MR. WATHANSOM2

We didn't raise it in terms of a

supremacy clause being the constitutional basis, although in
fact that is true, that is a basis, but we didn't raise —
QUESTIONs

We can't strike down a State statute

except on constitutional grounds, can we?
MR. NATHANSON:
QUESTION;

No, your Honor, except —

Well, if we strike it down because it's

in conflict with a Federal statute, it's because the Constitution
requires it.
MR, NATHANSON;

Under the supremacy clause.

In 1971,the New York State Department of Social
Services promulgated regulation 352,7(g)(7) of title 18 of the
New York Code of Rules and Regulations.
submitted to HEW for approval.

That regulation was

HEW, on several occasions,

notified New York that that regulation failed to satisfy
Federal requirements.

Notwithstanding such noncompliance, New

York State continued to give the regulation statewide applica­
tion and continues to receive Federal funds.
The regulation is known as the

recoupment regulation.

It permits the local Department of Social Services —
QUESTION;
question.

Mr, Nathanson, let me ask you one

Do you think 1983 reaches every Federal statute that

confers a right on someone?
MR, NATHANSON;

I think 1983 was intended to grant

that type of remedy where States deprive one of a Federal right,

7
that 1983 covers the full gamut of Federal rights and was
intended, unless Congress expressly limited the jurisdiction of
the courts

to hear that type of claim, your Honor,
QUESTION;

You mean Federal rights whether they derive

from the Constitution or Federal statutes, treaties, and so
forth?

1983 reaches all of those?
MR* NATHANSONs
QUESTION;

Constitution and laws, your Honor*

Can you think of any right under a Federal

statute that would not be within the reach of 1983 absent a
declaration by Congress excluding it?

It takes an affirmative

exclusion, is that your position?
MR* NATHANSON;

Yes, your Honor*

The recoupment regulation permits a local Department
of Social Services to provide a duplicate rent payment to a
recipient of public assistance who is threatened with eviction
for nonpayment of rent, but mandates that that duplicate rent
payment be recouped over the next 6 months in equal amounts.
In very practical terms, the rent recoupment regulation solves
the immediate crisis, but creates a far more serious crisis
since during the period of the recoupment, the family is
deprived of the very means to sustain themselves, to feed,
clothe, or house themselves.
The State argues that this rent recoupment regulation
is designed to deter mismanagement.

As the record demonstrates,

the recoupment regulation does not turn on mismanagement.

Petitioner Hagans and her two children reside in a
county with an acute housing shortage.

The State has conceded

petitioner was able to secure housing within the rent schedule»
Petitioner received a shelter allowance front the local Depart­
ment

of Social Services in the amount of $165»

to find housing at that allowance.
the amount of $200 a month.
housing.

She was. unable

She then found housing at

The local agency approved that

She was simply unable to continue making the rent

payments with' the monies intended for other basic needs, and
over a period of time fell into arrears.

She was evicted.

She was rehoused by the Department in a neighboring county.
The money used to rehouse her was then deducted in full from
the next month's rent, leaving a family of three with $17 for
the entire month's needs.
QUESTION:

Was she rehoused at her request?

MR. NATHJVNSONs
found

She was homeless, your I-Ionor„

She

the housing.
QUESTION:

But she wanted the State agency to do that,

I take it.
MR* NATHANSON:

Yes, she did.

The recoupment regulation is implemented with or
without the consent of the recipient.

In the case of two of

the named petitioners, local Department of Social Services paid
rent directly to the landlord to forestall a nonpayment proceeding without the prior consent or even knowledge of the

recipient, and then recoup the money from the subsequent month5 s
grant.

So it doesn’t really turn on the consent of the

recipient or the knowledge of the recipient either.

And in those

two cases, the recipients had not paid rent — in one of those
cases the recipient had not paid rent because she was protesting
the failure of the landlord to make repairs.

In effect, the

recoupment regulation deprived her of an opportunity to even
assert that defense.
In the complaint filed in the district court,
petitioners asserted three basic claims;

They asserted an

equal protection claim alleging that the rent recoupment
regulation irrationally creates two classes of needy dependent
children in New York State. Children whose parents require an
emergency rent payment are deprived of their right to have
their grant determined in accordance with the State standard
of need, while other children who receive assistance under the
program have their assistance determined in accordance with
State needs.
The petitioners also contended that the regulation
invidiously discriminates against the needy dependent children
because it punishes them for conduct over which they have no
control.

They in no way were guilty of mismanagement or in no

way created the crisis at hand.
QUESTION:

Would the Same thing possibly be true if

the rent: allotment were taken out to buy three color television

10

sets and the money all used up?

Would you then make this same

dichotomy of classes that the children of parents who went out
and bought three television sets were treated differently from
the children of parents who were more prudent?
MR, NATHANSON s

The intended beneficiary of the

entire State's program which is financed by the Federal Govern­
ment is to provide financial

protection for the needy dependent

chiIdren.
QUESTIONS

Would you make the same argument, that is

my question.
MR. NATHANSONs

Those children who were deprived of

assistance for a period of six months on the basis of parents’
conduct, your Honor, I would make the same argument,
QUESTIONs

Yet the payment is made to the parents,

is it not?
MR. NATHANSONs

The State chooses to whom the

beneficiary ~~ or as one lower court characterized it, the
conduit of the assistance is going to be.
the

The State can choose

parent, or it can choose some other relative or responsible

person to disperse the money on behalf of the intended
beneficiary, which is the child.
QUESTION;
family units as such?

You feel this doesn't parse itself into
You want to keep the children separate

and distinct from in some instances mismanaging parents?
MR. NATHANSON:

I think the sole aim of the assistance

11

program was to protect the dependent child»
As further evidence of that, your Honor, Congress has
recognized mismanagement can be a problem.

We don't argue

for a moment that everybody who requires a duplicate rent
payment has in fact mismanaged a grant»

We say that it

doesn’t necessarily require that and the facts show that.

But

Congress has said mismanagement is a problem and has established
nonpunitive measures to pro\Tide witn that problem, one being
a restricted check, that the parent is not free to spend a
check any way they choose, but has to use it for intended
purpose»
QUESTION:

Mr, Nathanson, if you should prevail here,

what is the likely result in the New York system?

Is it a

likelihood that they will then do away with advances to prevent
eviction?
MR. NATHANSON -

Your Honor, there is,and HEW has

said so in a brief they filed as an amicus in a lower court,
HEW said there is ample provision for New York State to deal
with this particular crisis without resort to recoupment
regulation.

And that remedy is emergency assistance which

doesn’t require repayment on the part of the parent»

It can be

given only once in a 12-month period to resolve a crisis»
QUESTION:

Who pays tine emergency assistance then?

MR. NATHANSON:

The assistance "would be paid by the

State with reimbursement by the Federal Government,

In fact,

s a measure that Congress particularly enacted, I think it
was in 1966, because they were concerned, too, with the problem
or mismanagement and wanted to deal with it in a rehabilitative
way rather than a punitive way.

This regulation, I feel, is

a punitive measure that deals with the problem.
QUESTION;

Punitive just because it gets back what

it ultimately paid out?
MR. MATHANSON:

Punitive because, again, if we are

to assume that the intended beneficiary of the payment is a
child, a dependent child, because it penalizes the child for
conduct over which the child has no control.
QUESTION:

But the child would have suffered if there

had actually been an eviction and there had been no home to
move into, wouldn’t it?
MR* NATHANSON:

Yes, certainly a family disrupted

would suffer.
QUESTION;

So the State’s action was really to prevent

that sort of harm tc the child.
MR. NATHANSON:

Curiously under the New York State -~

and the record indicates —» where a family is actually
evicted and rehoused by the State in a motel, the State —•
because they haven’t paid their rent — they are rehoused in a
motel, the State doesn't exact recoupment from the recipient.
The motel cost is paid in full.
payment.

That in effect is duplicate

And the family continues to receive the full benefits

of their grants.

So the State hasn’t even treated all who

they allege have mismanaged the same way.
QUESTION;

Let me go back to ray question.

I take it

it's your position then, that if you prevail here, you /'are in
no way affecting adversely the very children that you are
intending to benefit by being here.
MR. NATHANSOM;

To answer your question, they will not

be adversely affected by determination that the regulation is
in violation —
QUESTION:

You will not dry up other sources of

assistance?
MR, NATHANSONs

Wo, your Honor,

And HEW has said that

in their brief.
QUESTION:

I must say I then misunderstand wholly

what the case is about,

I thought that if you prevailed here,

all that would happen would be that the case would go back to
the district court for trial.

I thought this was only a

jurisdictional question before us.
MR. NATHANSONs

The district court has determined

the Social Security Act claim on the merits.

The district court

never addressed itself to the merits of the constitutional
claim beyond merely finding that it was substantial,
QUESTION:

And the only questions presented, as I

read them in your brief and as I understood them, and I have
read these briefs at soxae length last Sunday, were jurisdictional

14
questions.
MR, NATHANSON:
QUESTION:

Jurisdictional questions, correct,

What do you mean if you prevail here,

somebody is going to have to pay some money?

If you prevail

here, it is going back to the district court for trial, isn't
it?
MR* NATHANSON:

I thought Judge Blackmun’s question

meant if we ultimately prevail, what would be the impact on
New York State?
QUESTION:

That's not here,

MR, NATHAMSON:
QUESTION:

No, that's quite true.

All we have here is jurisdiction, unless

I quite misread and misunderstood
MR. NATHANSON:
briefs.

the briefs.

No, you haven't misunderstood the

Perhaps I misunderstood the question.

I thought you

ware referring to what would happen if this regulation was
ultimately struck dovm, what would the significance of it be,
QUESTION;

Did you argue in the Court of Appeals

thatunder 1933 and 1343 a supremacy clause argument, namely,
a claim that a State statute is in conflict with a Federal
statute and therefore invalid?

Did you argue that that kind

of a claim is a constitutional claim within the meaning of
1983?
MR. NATHAN30N:

Iii the circuit court the argument

centered around whether or not the equal protection claim was

a nonfrivolous claim for jurisdictional purposes,
QUESTION:

Again, how about answering that question*

Did you argue that or not, that this conflict supremacy matter
was a constitutional claim within the meaning of 1983?
MR. NATHAN SON;
QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. NATHAMSOM:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor, I did not.

The lower court had found jurisdiction-

I don't care about the lower court.

Jurisdiction was challenged in the Court, of Appeals, wasn’t it?
MR, NATHANSON:

There was a first panel of the Court

of Appeals which unanimously found jurisdiction under 1343(3)
as a basis for jurisdiction in Carter v„ Stanton.

The State

attacked the jurisdiction on the basis of a lack of a substan­
tial constitutional claim, and we responded on that basis, your
Honor.
QUESTION:
MR.

And what did the Court of Appeals hold?

NATHANSON:

The Court of Appeals, the second

Court of Appeals panel?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR, NATHANSON:
QUESTION:

The second Court of Appeals —

The decision you are wanting reviewed here,

MR, NATHANSONs

The second Court of Appeals panel

determined that on the facts as disclosed in the pleading
failed to present a substantial constitutional claim.
QUESTION:

Did you argue in response to the State's

claim that there is a constitutional issue here, namely, one
of supremacy?

Did you argue that?

MR. NATHANSOMs
QUESTION:

No, your Honor.

Your very opening sentence in your

complaint, page 4, is that you seek a declaration that title 18
of the New York Code is in violation of the Social Security
Act and also the equal protection clause.
MR. MATHAMSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

What does that first sentence mean?

It's

in violation of the Social Security Act? isn’t that a supremacy
clause allegation?
MR. NATHANSON:

We allege that there was jurisdiction

under 1343(3),
QUESTION:

We are arguing on your side right now,

remember that.
(Laughter,)
Do you know of any cases in this Court that say that
a. substantial supremacy clause argument is not a constitutional
question within the meaning of 1983?
MR. NATHANSONs

No, your Honor.

QUESTION: Well, let’s assume that it is, isn’t this
case over?
MR. NATHANSON s

That vould be the end of the case.

We argue that the court below erroneously concluded
by an erroneous application of the standard for determining

17
substantiality of a constitutional claim that this claim was
frivolous.

This Court has repeatedly held constitutional claims

are frivolous only if so attenuated as to be without merit or
its unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions
of this Court so as to foreclose the possibility that it could
be a subject of controversy.

Recently, in the case of Goosby v.

Qssere this Court interpreted the phrase "wholly without merit"
in the context of prior decisions and determined that
constitutional claims are frivolous only if they are inescapablyforeclosed by prior decisions of this Court,

The court below

cited no controlling authority that forecloses this constitutional
claim.

The court appears to have based its finding that the

equal protection claim was insubstantial on the basis of this
Court's holding in Dandridge v. Williams.

We submit that the

case of Dandridge v, Williams is not dispositive of the
threshold question of jurisdiction.

Dandridge determines the

appropriate standards to apply to an equal protection challenge
in the area of social welfare legislation.
The State argues that Dandridge should be given a
broad, sweeping application so as to foreclose any equal
protection challenges in the area of social welfare legislation.
Recent decisions of the Court suggest that no such broad,
sweeping application has in fact been given to Dandridge or
should

be given.

in point.

The case of Carter v. Stanton is a case

In Carter v, Stanton, the plaintiffs challenge the

18

Indiana welfare statute on both statutory and equal protection
grounds.

The district court found that the equal protection

argument was foreclosed by this Court’s holding in Dandridge.
On appeal this Court found jurisdiction at citing Dandridge in
support of its finding of constitutional substantiality.

We

maintain that whether or not the district court properly
concluded that the constitutional claim is insubstantial, that
there is independent jurisdiction to determine the Social
Security Act claims under both 13**3 (3) and 1343(4)since this
action was founded on a violation of section IS83 of the Civil
Rights Act.
Section 1983 is an. act of Congress providing for
equal rights of citizens within its meaning on two bases?
That 1983 is an act providing for the protection of civil
rights within the meaning of 1343(3) and that 1983 is an act
providing for equal rights within the meaning of 1343(4),
Section 1983 provides for civil action to redress deprivations
under color of State law of any right, privilege, or immunity
secured by the Constitution and laws.

In this case petitioners

seek to redress rights that have been secured by Federal law,
namely, the Social Security Act.

And while petitioners may

have a right in some absolute sense to a level of benefits or
any benefits at all, they do have a right so long as New York
State continues to receive Federal funds to have their
eligibility determined in accordance with Federal standards.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Nathanson, may I ask you a question?

Is the only reason that title 28 of the United States Code,
section 1331, is inapplicable here is because of the want of the
requisite jurisdictional amount?
MR. NATHANSON:
QUESTION:

1331 —

Do you understand my question?

MR, NATHANSON:

Yes,

I don’t think it would satisfy

the monetary requirements of 1331.
QUESTION:

Is that the only reason?

MR. NATHANSON:
QUESTION:

It was never raised as a defense or --

Well, in your submission, why is it you

have to argue about 1343(3) and (4)?

Wouldn’t 1331 be avail­

able to you?
MR.

NATHANSON:

It would be available, if we could

demonstrate that we satisfy the monetary requirements,
QUESTION:

Then the answer to ray first question is

yes, that’s the reason and the only reason?
MR.

NATHANSON;

We cannot satisfy the monetary

requirements.
QUESTION:

Right, because of the jurisdictional

amount.
MR. NATHANSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

That never came through too clearly.

guess it's implicit all through these briefs.
sole reason, is it, that 1331 is not available?

That is the

I

MR* NAffHANSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Thank you.

MR* NATHANSON:

1343 — this Court has often observed

judicial construction of a statute begins by looking at the
words of the statute itself.

The words of 1343(4) are clear

and. leave no room for doubt, we believe, that claims brought
under 1983 were intended to be covered by 1343 (4).

In Lynch v..

Household Finance Corn., this Court held that Congress
intended to give broad, sweeping protection to basic civil
rights by the enactment of 1983, the right to enjoy property
being one of those rights, whether that property be a home,
a savings account, or even a welfare check.

Just as a right

not to be deprived of property without due process of lav/ is
a right secured by the Constitution, we maintain so then the
right to receive benefits provided by the Social Security Act
is a civil right within the meaning of 13.43,
The Court has recently recognized in Moor v*County
of ^Alameda that 1983 is an act which protects civil rights
within the meaning of 1343(4),

Other courts specifically

addressing themselves to this question have reached the same
conclusion.

Only the Second Circuit has rejected 1343(4)

jurisdiction, but has done so without any rationale or reasoning
for its determination.

In the court below, the court

concluded that there was no 1343 jurisdiction and dismissed
the case on the basis of Almenares v. Wyman*

Almenares y.

21

Wyman, a Second Circuit case, determined that there was
jurisdiction because of a substantial constitutional claim,
but rejected 1343(4)

jurisdiction, citing McCall v. Shapiro.

McCall v„ Shapiro did discuss 1343(4)

jurisdiction, found no

basis for jurisdiction, but did. so on the basis of the personal
liberties property rights distinction, which this Court later
rejected in Lynch v. Household Finance.

Thus, it is clear that

the Second Circuit has yet to come up with any convincing
rationale for rejecting 1343(4) to 1983 suits»
The State argues that the one roadblock to jurisdic­
tion, to 1343(4) jurisdiction, is a brief description in the
House report accompanying the bill which described it as merely
a technical amendment -to a preceding section of law.

We

submit that that limited view is not accurate, since the preced­
ing section of law to which it refers was specifically eliminated
by floor amendment and vras not enacted into lav/»
section been enacted into law, irs clear,

Even had that

plain words of

1343(4) go beyond the ascribed purpose of the committee.
Congress surely intended the act to mean something.

The Senate

would not have passed the section of law to refer to a preceding
section it had knowingly rejected.
Some further indication of the purpose of 1343(4)
can be gleaned from the very title itself which is an Act to
strengthen civil rights enforcement.

It’s only with the

interpretation that we suggest be given to it that it can be

2.2
considered an act enlarging
enforcement.

and enhancing Federal civil rights

This Court has already interpreted 1343(4)

expansive of Federal jurisdiction.

as

In the case of Jones v. Alfred

H. Haver, a private c o rp orati on was sued for di.s crimination in
refusing to sell a home to a person because he was a liegro.
1343(4) was the. only statute available to provide jurisdiction
over a private suit.

The suit xvas brought under 1932 .

This

Court found jurisdiction under 1343(4).
If the State is correct that 1343(4)

is too technical

a provision to provide jurisdiction to 1383, it surely would
be too technical to provide jurisdiction for 1343(4),
We submit further 1343(3) provides an independent
basis for jurisdiction.

1343(3)

and 1983 were intended, so

the legislative history shows, to be coextensive in scope
and that Congress never intended to create a gap between the
two.

Moreover, 1983 is an act that protects equal rights

since it guarantees a Federal forum -- equal access to a
Federal forum to secure those rights secured by Federal law.
QUESTION?

Mr, Nathanson, are you familiar with the

treatment in the opinions in the Rachel and/or Peacock cases
of almost identical language in the removal statute?
MR. NATHANSONs
QUESTIONs

Yes, sir,

Where we held, as I remember, that, an

act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens meant
just that, meant what it said.

It didn't mean any act of

23

Congress or any constitutional provision either.
HR. NATHANSON:

I think, your Honor, in response to

your question, that Congress often uses different language in
the same Act to have different shades of meaning.
QUESTION:

My question was, were you familiar witn

tne language in Peacock v._Greenwood, that was my question.
MR. NATHANS ON s

Yes, I ara.

I think that the equal

rights language is not limited to suits

involving racial

equality,
QUESTION:

Let me first — yes, you are familiar

with that language.
MR. NATH AIT SON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Do I recollect correctly that it was

neld in those cases that similar or identical language meant
legislation providing for equal rights.

It didn't even include,

for example, the First Amendment.
MR. NATHAWSOU:

Yes, you are correct in your

recollection of the case.
QUESTION:

Now, now xfould you distinguish that?

MR. NATHANSON:

Georgia v. Rachel involved 1443 —

1443 was a removal statute.

Removal statutes' origin can be

We submit that the legislative

At the very outset there was intention on the

part of Congress to create Federal jurisdiction over all 1983
actions without distinction.

I think it's because of the

history of the two sections together that we make the argument
that it should be given coextensive application.

There was no

intention on the part of Congress to create a gap between the
creation of a Federal right and a forum where that right can be
heard.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL COLODNER OH
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. COLODMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, at issue in this case is a regulation of the Mew
York State Department of Social Services in which the State
makes an additional rent payment to welfare recipients that is
over and above the regular shelter allowance which the recipient
snould receive, and then recoups it over a period of six months»
The requirements for this regulation are that the
recipient, for whatever reason, misallocates his or her regular
shelter allowance.
eviction.

The recipient then becomes threatened with

The Department then steps in at the request of the

recipient and offers them an opportunity to remain where they
are living and therefore receive a duplicate rent payment.

But

if they choose this option, they will have to repay this extra
amount over the course of the next six months.
Mow, the petitioners in this case challenged this
because they claimed it is a denial of equal protection, because
those who are subject to recoupment are in some manner being
treated differently from those wao are not subject to this
recoupment, even though this other class never received the
extra payment.
The Second Circuit found this claim to be insubstantial
and, as such, found that there was no jurisdiction to decide
the pendent statutory claim which involves whether the New York

26

State regulation at issue violates the Social Security Act,
QUESTIONx

Why is it pendent?

Maybe you can help

enlighten me why a claim that the State statute violates the
Federal statute isn't a substantial constitutional question in
itself within the meaning of 1983 and 1343.

every single State law that is perhaps contrary to every single
Federal law„

There is nothing in the history of the Civil

Rights Act that leads to that conclusion.

And while you can

make a verbal argument to that effect, I don't think tnat the
history bears it out.
Now, insofar as the —
QUESTION:

Nothing said in our cases in the last four

or five or six years is in conflict with your position on that?
MR. COLODNER:

I think, your Honor, that if you

take the cases of the last four or five years, that there
really is not a conflict, with the exception, perhaps, of some
dicta in one or two cases because 1983 — and let's get right
into 1983 — the claim of the petitioners here is that it
\

provides a remedy for all Federal statutes.

And they look to

the language which says all rights secured by Constitution and
laws, and they claim laws includes tne Social Security Act

and therefore they have a right to come into Federal court at
least

to allege a Federal cause

of action under 1983»

But

the 1871 Act, which is the basis for 1983, did not mention
rights secured by lav;; it

only mentioned rights secured by the

Constitution»

that occurred in the 1871 Act came

The change

during the revision when the 1866 the 1870 and the 1871 Acts
were all codified together and clarified and put into one
provision, and here the reviser put in the wards "and laws»’3
And I think that since there was no explanation as to why the
reviser put this in, it would appear that he was referring to
Y

the laws that were included in
which were in essence the
Civil Rights Act,

that whole civil rights package

1866 Civil Rights Act and the .1870

There is no basis irs the history of the

Civil Rights Act that Congress ever intended to create a
Federal cause of action for every conceivable Federal statute
that would ever come into existence, aside from statutes that
enforced the 13th or 14th Amendments.

In fact, the only

Supreme Court case that ever considered this issue as to what
the scope of "and laws" was was a 1900 Supreme Court case, and
it held that this language did not apply, at least to a patent
rights case, holding that 1983 applied to civil rights only,
at least showing that the Supreme Court in 1900 believed that
1983 was a fairly narrow statute.
Now, when this Court has spoken of 1983 in terras of
the rights that it protects, it has spoken of the protection

32

of constitutional rights, and this Court has never held 1983
to its literal language as witness the case of Tenney v„ Brandhove«
1 think it is important to note that when Congress
passes a Federal statute, they generally provide their own
remedy within the statute.

The Social Security Act when it was

passed provided no remedy in Federal court for recipients of
AFDC benefits, and I would sxiggest that there was no reason
why Congress,which always provides its own remedies when it
passes any new statute,would pass a sfcat\ite which creates
a Federal cause of action as to every conceivable future Federal
lav; in any field whatever — banking tax — it makes no difference,
simply because State action might be involved»

There is just

no reason why Congress would pass this statute and there is no
reason to give the language of "and laws" in 1983 the broad
interpretation that petitioners want to give it and that
this Court has stated in dicta might apply»
I would suggest that even if 1983 is as broad as
petitioners say it is and if it includes every single Federal
law, it is clear that Congress did not provide jurisdiction
in the Federal courts to hear this cause of action because the
language of 1343(3) is narrow.

It says deprivation of rights

secured by the Constitution and of any Act of Congress providing
for equal rights.
Now, the history of that clause also is very unclear.
In the 1874 codification

the district court had jurisdiction

33
over rights secured by any law, the circuit court on the
other hand had rights secured by any law providing for equal
rights.

Those were probably meant to be concurrent because the

basis of this was the same 1866 Act which did provide concurrent
jurisdiction.

I have shown in ray brief that there is a

draftsman's note on the circuit court provision that shows it
was intended to be narrowly applied to equal rights statutes.
In .1911 Congress explicitly chose the equal rights language
which shows the full intent of Congress that it at least
believed that the original jurisdiction was limited to equal
rights provisions.
Now, it's very interesting that the petitioners have
come to this Court and have really changed the whole structure
of their argument, because in the lower court they were arguing
that the Social Security Act was the Act of Congress providing
for equal rights, or the Act of Congress providing for civil
rights.

Mow they have changed the argument.

1983 itself is such an Act.

They say that

And I would suggest that this is

really a bootstraps argument, because 1983 is a procedural
statute.

It creates a cause of action where someone is

deprived of rights that are enumerated somewhere else.

It is,

in the words of 1343, the civil action authorized by law to be
commenced.

That's right on the first line of 1343.

the substantive Act providing for equal rights.

It is not

If, in fact,

1983 were an equal rights Act, there would be a lot of problems

just on tne language of the statute itself.

Number one, it

would be inconsistent to say that 1983 is the authorizing law
and at the same time is a substantive lav/.,

Number two, you

would have a complete redundancy here if 1983 is an equal
rights Act, because 1343(3) refers to rights secured by the
Constitution, which means that the language of 1343(3) would be
redundant if it includes 1983 which already refers to rights
secured by the Constitution,

All Congress would need have

done would just be to say there is jurisdiction under any
equal rights statute.

There v/ould be no reason even to mention

the Constitution if 1983 is brought down into the jurisdictional
provision.
And thirdly, I would say, and incongrously, if 1983
is an equal rights Act, its language”and laws" is much too
broad to encompass itself in that narrow definition,
I think the key to this case is the decision in
Georgia v, Rachel because there, dealing with the same
language in the removal statute, this Court held that the term
"any law providing for equal rights” was narrow.

It meant

laws dealing with historic equal rights, and specifically said
it did not mean 1933,

That’s within the language of that

opinion,
I think it's very interesting to note that both
1443, which is the removal statute, and 1343(3) which is the
statute at issue here, derive from the very same provision of

the 1866 Civil Rights Act, which is subsection (3), the very
same provision.

It would seem that if 1443 was that narrow,

.1983 which was codified the exact same year as 1443 must have
the same meaning,
I would also suggest that Congress was so concerned
about passing 1343(4) 90 years later just to add the right to
vote, they evidently also considered the phrase "equal rights”
to have a very narrow meaning.
that the

And in fact, I would point out

history of 1343(3) shows that the "and laws" language

of 1983 was probably meant to be more limited than this Court
had hinted it might be.
Now, the petitioners also argue that somehow or other
in 1957 Congress passed a new jurisdictional provision to the
Civil Rights Act, 1343(4), which somehow changed the course
of all civil rights jurisdiction.

The jurisdictional provision

there is an Act of Congress providing for the protection of
civil rights, including the right to vote.
What does this really mean?
the right to vote.

Civil rights including

And if you. look to see what Congress was

really trying to do here, you will see essentially that waat
was at stake in 1957 was a voting rights act.
called this particular provision

The House report

a technical amendment.

The House debate» only dealt with what they called civil rights
and specifically included,by rulings of the House chairman,
economic rights, of which we are obviously dealing with here.

The Senate debate is even more interesting, because it limited
itself solely to voting rights, because of a very strong
reaction on the part of those Senators favoring States'rights
that

-this particular Civil Rights of 1957 might be too broad

because historically this would be the first Civil Rights Act
that was passed since Reconstruction,
The provision to keep in what became 1343(4) was
proposed by

Senator- Case of South Dakota, and he throughout

the debate states that the reason he wants this provision in
is because it deals wholly — and he says that •— wholly with
the establishment of the jurisdiction of Federal courts to
entertain suits relating to the right to vote and just the
right to vote.
I think what you have here with 1343(4) is an Act
which creates jurisdiction in the Federal courts to hear suits
relating to the right to vote.

Congress was very uncertain

as to Ttfhat the jurisdictional limits of 1343(3) were and they
were clarifying it.
here.

In fact, the caption is very interesting

The caption of 1343 just says "Civil Rights."

When

1343(4) was added in 1957,the caption was amended to say
"civil rights and elective franchise"
all that was added.

That was •

So what you have here essentially

when

you deal with civil rights in 1343(4) is the same rights that
were in 1343(3), except that it includes the right to vote.
Now, it is true that 1343(4) does not include

QUESTION:

You don't think 1343

included the right

to vote?
MR. COLODNER:

Whether I think it or the Congress

thought it?
QUESTION:

That's in a whole lot of cases,

MR. COLODNER:

I don't believe that Congress felt

sure whether it did or whether it did not.

And since they were

dealing in the Civil Rights Act, they wanted to make sure that
there would be no jurisdictional contradiction in the statutes
between the jurisdiction set forth in .134 3 and the jurisdiction

were after the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments?

Weren't they to enforce those three Amendments?
MR. COLODNER:

I would think, your Honor -~
You can't take that position.

MR. COLODNER:
QUESTXQNs

That's correct,

Your Honor, I would think that

Or do you know what the 15th Amendment is?

MR. COLODNER;

The 15th Amendment, your Honors,

provides for the right to vote.

But Congress was already

concerned about the fact that what did the equal rights
statute mean, and also 1343(4)

provides for a right of action

38
not under color of State law because 1971, the Voting Rights
Act, which was amended,provided for the Attorney General to
bring suits against private individuals acting under color of
State law or not under color of State law*

And this was one

of the reasons why they had to put in some different provision
to allow for these suits to be brought into Federal court
without a jurisdictional amount not under color of State law,
But I don't believe there is anything in the history
of 1343(4) which suggests that the subject matter of the Civil
Rights Act was being expanded, any more than debate indicated.
I would suggest that the rights of 1343(4) are no greater than
the rights of 1343(3), and that Congress never intended that
the Federal courts have jurisdiction over suits that arise
under the

AFDC provisions of the Social Security Act.

It’s very interesting that when the Social Security Act was
passed in 1935, there was jurisdiction provided in the Federal
courts for claims arising under the Old Age provision but
not under the Aid to Dependent Children provision.

This

evidences an intent on the part of Congress that the Federal
courts were not going to hear every single minor AFDC claim
outside of the general Federal question jurisdiction of 1331
wnich is not at issue here because there is no claim that
$10,000 is in dispute.
Now, I would like to point out that becaxise there is
no jurisdiction under the Social Security Act per se and

39

Congress never intended there to be jurisdiction under the
Social Security Act per se, that the only issue left in this
case is whether this Court, by virtue of this claim being
pendent to a substantial constitutional right, and that was
the issue which the Second Circuit decided when they held, no,
that constitutional claim is not substantial and therefore we
don*t have jurisdiction to decide this pendent claim.
The standard that obviously applies here was the
test of obviously without merit.
time.

This Court has used it all the

The standard did not change with Goosby v. Osser but

was reaffirmed there.

I think if you look at the equal

protection violation here, it’s frivolous.
claiming?

What are they

They are claiming that they are getting more money

one month and less money the next month and that somehow or
other they are being treated as a violation of equal protection.
But the essence of equal protection is equal treatment and
they are being treated exactly equally.

They receive a duplicate

payment to which they are not entitled and to "which nobody else
gets, and the subsequent month or the subsequent six months
they pay back this duplicate payment to be put in the exact
same effect as any other welfare recipient.

In fact, I would

suggest that if this is a constitutional claim of any substance
and if petitioners were to prevail here, it would be just as
substantial for any other recipient who did not get the
recoupment claim to bring a civil rights action in this Court

40
and claim a denial of equal protection because they don't get
extra payments and they have to live within a tight budget,
I think that the Second Circuit clearly determined
this to be frivolous because, as the Second Circuit says, the
purposes of equal protection are served by treating all alike
without granting special favors to those who have misappropriated
their rent allowance.
Mow, since this claim is obviously without merit,
as it must be, there is obviously on any minimal, rational
basis test a stake in allocating its limited funds so that
every recipient receives an equal share.

We don't put this

thing in to encourage mismanagement or discourage mismanagement.
That's not the issue here.

The issue is that we are trying to

treat all of these recipients equally.

We are not required

to give them this extra rent allov/ance; we could allow them
to be evicted.

There is no Federal constitutional or even

statutory requirement that we say to these people, "Look, if
you choose to stay in the same house and not go through the
vicissitudes of eviction, we have to do this for you,"
don't have to do it.

We

But we are doing it because we feel that

eviction is a very traumatic experience for welfare recipients.
But we only have limited funds at the same time and there is
certainly nothing unreasonable about this sort of approach
to give people extra money to help them out and then to take
the money back so that we can in effect treat them the same as

41
any other welfare recipient.
QUESTION:

I suppose there is one remedy which the

State could follow if you do not prevail here, a drastic remedy»
They could simply refuse to make these payments.
MR. COLODNER;

That's absolutely right, your Honor,

and in fact I would suggest that that is a very real alternative
If in fact we are not allowed to make these payments because
we have to make them to everybody else, is what it comes down
to, we will not make them*

Is there any other way that you could

ward off the equal protection claims of all the other recipients
MR. COLODNER;

I would say that —-

We are only dealing

If we start giving more to one

group, we are going to have to start giving less to the other
group.

As a result everyone's grants would be cut, as the

Supreme Court has said vie can do in Rosado, we can give a
ratable reduction, and that would ultimately probably be the
result of this.

But it would probably be more realistic to

assume that if we could not recoup, we just would not give these
duplicate rent payments

Yes, there are other measures that can be utilised,

And this is a very sticky problem' .

What do you do

to people who misallocate the money that they are paid?

Well,

you can say, give them protective payments, but the Federal
Government says you can’t give more than 10 percent of all
recipients protective payments.

fact, doesn’t even want us to use these protective payments

than having them recouping money over six months.

The Mew York courts have held that in cases of

destitution, where destitution can be shown, they will order
the Social Services Department to pay under the emergency

which have policy implications in all sorts of directions, and

protecting the monies of the State.

here, i.e., that quite apart from what has been called here
pendent jurisdiction, that there is independent jurisdiction
of this so-called statutory claim, this preemption claim
under 1343(3) and 1343(4)?
MR. COLODNER;
this extent;

I would say the argument was made to

That was the jurisdictional basis cited in the

complaint, 1343,
QUESTION;
Hays'

Because I have before me here Judge

opinion, and he seems to say that the basic constitutional

claim was premised upon that jurisdictional statute, 1343(3),
and then he goes on to say that to establish jurisdiction under
this statute, a substantial constitutional claim must be
advanced, and then he says, for the reasons that you have just
told me, this equal protection claim is not a substantial

46
constitutional claim.

And then he ends very abruptly because

no substantial constitutional claim was presented, the district
court was without jurisdiction to consider the statutory
claim urged by plaintiffs, the statutory claim presumably being
the preemption claim, which doesn't seem to respond, at least
to the argument that is being made in this Court with respect
to the independent grounds for jurisdiction of the so-called
statutory claim,

I wonder if the argument was made to the

Court of Appeals.
MR.

CQLODNER;

The argument was made to the extent

that 1343 was mentioned in the petitioners' complaint and to
the extent that the State's brief,in showing that there was
no jurisdiction once there was an insubstantial constitutional
the
claim, set forth / fact that there would be no jurisdiction
under 1343.
QUESTION:

And the court apparently accepted it

without any analysis.
MR. COLODNER:

Evidently.

I would assume so because

it is not in the decision of the court,
QUESTION:

The court took the view that once they

decided the constitutional claim was not a substantial one,
then what they would call the statutory claim automatically
fell with it without any consideration at all of any independent
jurisdictional basis for the so-called statutory claim.
that right?

MR. COLODNER:

I can only read the opinion as your

Honor has read the opinion,
minds of the judges.

I do not know what was in the

I do know what was presented to the court,

that the decision is what it says.
QUESTION:

But this precise argument, I gather from

what you say, was not presented to the Court of Appeals.
At least not in the way it's being presented here.
MR. COLODNER:

Not in the detail that is presented

here, but we did present this argument in response to the
fact that there would be no jurisdiction in the Federal court
for a claim arising under the Social Security Act if there was
not a substantial —QUESTION:

Unless it were pendent to a substantial

constitutional claim.
MR. COLODNER:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

And the Court of Appeals apparently

wholly accepted your thesis.
MR. COLODNER:

Apparently.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:44 p.m,, the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
