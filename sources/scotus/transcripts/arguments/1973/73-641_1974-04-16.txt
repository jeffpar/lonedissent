MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in No. 73-641, Snow against Commissioner of Internal
Revenue.
Hr. Doan, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BURGESS L. DOAN
ON BEHALF OF TIIE PETITIONERS
MR. DOAN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case involves a deficiency in the Federal

income tax for the taxable year 1966.

The issue is whether

the petitioner is entitled to a deduction for his distributive
share of a net operating loss resulting from research and
experimental expenditures incurred and paid by Burns, a
partnership, during the taxable year 1966.
Petitioner contends he is entitled to deduct his
distributive share of the net operating loss of Burns since
the expenses giving rise to this loss were incurred and paid
during the taxable year 1966 as research and experimental
expenses.

These expenses are covered by section 174 of the

Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has disallowed
these expenses upon audit of the partnership return on the
grounds that neither Burns Investment Company nor the
petitioner Snow was engaged in a trade or business.
The United States Tax Court sustained the

4
Commissioner, and the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit
sustained the Tax Court decision, holding that the expenditures
sought to be deducted by Burns Investment Company in 1966 were
preoperating expenses and not deductible under section 174,
The facts of the case are fairly simple.

In 1963

Mr. Trott, who was the inventor of a trash-burning device and
who was also the managing partner of Burns Investment Company,
resigned from his position with the Proctor & Gamble Company
and purchased an interest in a small, closely held corpora­
tion doing business as Crossbow.

In addition to his activity

in Crossbow, Mr. Trott carried on research and development
work on three different items;

Number one, a telephone­

answering device; number two, a tape recorder; and number
three, the item at issue, a trash burner or a leaf burner,
Upon audit of the partnership return, the Internal
Revenue Service held that Mr. Trott, the general partner,
was engaged in the business of an inventor by virtue of his
activities in' these various projects.
The partnerships, which were three, which were
formed to carry on these various ventures, were doing business
as Echo Development Company — and that partnership was formed
in March of 1365.

The second partnership doing business as

Courier Enterprises was formed to carry on the development of
a tape recorder, and that partnership was also formed in
March of 1965.

The partnership Burns Investment Company, whicr

5
was formed to carry on the development of the trash-burner,
was formed in 1966.

All three partnerships «re formed for

the same purpose, and that was the development, securing
patents on, and finally either producing or licensing another
manufacturer to produce these various items.
During 1966 Echo and Courier —- 1966 is the year at
issue, and during 1966 Echo and Courier had completed products,
that is, the tape recorder and the te 1 ephone -answe r i ng device
which was then held available for sale or licensing.

Patents

had been applied for in the case of the telephone-answering
device as of August 16, 1966.

Patents had been applied for

in the case of the tape recorder as of November 22, 1967.
Patent

for the trash burner was applied for as of June 10,

1968, and in each instance patents were granted.

In the case

of the trash-burner, foreign patents have been granted in at
least 14 foreign countries.
The Internal Revenue Service held that Burns
Investment Company was not engaged in a trade or business
during the taxable year 1966.

The Internal Revenue Service

did not see fit to disturb the status of Echo or Courier, the
two remaining partnerships.
Mr. Trott, the inventor and the managing partner,
testified that he worked on the development of the trashburner during the year 1964 and 1965, and during that time he
devoted one-third of his time to that venture.

On December 10,

6

1963, the development, of the trash-burner had advanced to the
stage that Mr. Trott had received an opinion from patent
counsel stating that features of the trash burner were then
patentable in his opinion.

However, he advised against

filing an application for patent in December of 1965, suggest­
ing that the filing be held up until a prototype had been
built.
QUESTION:

What year was the prototype built?

When

did the work start on the prototype?
MR. DOAN:
that time.

Many prototypes had been built prior to

The prototype to which we allude as existing in

1965 was a rather crude prototype model that admittedly did
have some flaws in i.t„

It did not work well.

The second letter which was received from patent
counsel in February of 1966 pointed out that the prototype
that was then in existence needed further modification, again
in the opinion of patent counsel.
After receiving the letter from patent counsel
advising of that fact in 1966, Mr. Trott proceeded to form the
partnership Burns Investment Company to raise capital to
further develop the trash burner.

After forming the partner­

ship, articles of partnership were drawn up and filed with
the Hamilton County Recorder's office.

The partners paid in

their capital contributions to the extent of $40,000.

accounts.

It proceeded to establish its bank

It set up its books and records.

It filed its

Federal income tax return.
QUESTION:

You sort of skipped over a point.

Where

was its office?
MR. DOAN:

Your Honor, the office of Burns Investment

Company x^as in the facilities of the closely held corporation
Crossbow.
QUESTION:

Did. it have a name on the door?

MR. DOAN:

No, your Honor, it did not.

QUESTION:

It didn't have a name on the door, didn't

have a telephone.

Where was the "business"?

MR. DOAN:

The business —

QUESTION:

Of that partnership, just the one, where

was that business?
MR. DOAN;

That business was located within the

same building as Crossbow.

It did not have a name on the door,

and it did not have a telephone.
QUESTION;

And the difference between that and

Crossbow was what?

MR. DOAN:

One was a partnership

QUESTION:

How many employees did this one have?

MR. DOAN:

It did not have any employees directly.

QUESTION:

How do you have a business without

MR. DOAN:

Mr. Trott —

QUESTION;

Don't you have to show you have a

partnership business in order to qualify?
MR. DOAN;

Yes,, your Honor, we have to show vie have

a partnership business.
QUESTION;
business.

I'm waiting for you to show me the

The man is doing experimenting; he is.making

models and everything, but where's his business?
MR. DOAN;

Your Honor, we submit his business is

the research and experimental activity carried on in perfecting
the trash burner.

The partnership, Burns Investment Company,

did enter into contractual relationship with Crossbow

and

with other suppliers obligating itself for goods and services.
It conducted regular partnership meetings regarding the
development work, regarding tests and experiments that were
carried on, regarding the design of the trash burner,
regarding the various marketing methods on how the trash
burner could best be brought to the commercial market.
The partnership, Burns, did not have a trash burner
that was then available for sale to the market ixx 1966.
Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code provides
that a taxpayer may deduct research and experimental
expenditures paid or incurred by him during the taxable year
in connection with his trade or business.

There is no dispute

as to these expenses involved in this case being research and

9

experimental expenses within the meaning of section 174.
QUESTION:

I take it there is no dispute about

the integrity of these expenses»
MR. DOAN:

No, your Honor, there is not.

QUESTION:

And I take it you also concede that were

you relegated to 162 your case would not be a good one.
MR. DOAN:

We admit that, your Honor.

The term "trade or business" is nowhere defined in
section 174 or in the Commissioner's regulations under
section 174.
The respondent contends in this case that the term
"trade or business" has the same meaning in. section 174 as it
has in other sections of the Internal Revenue Code.

However,

the case law relied upon in support of this proposition in
every instance goes back to a section 162 standard.

Section 162

allows expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business.
Section 162 has other standards as well, specifically section
162 provides that a taxpayer may deduct ordinary and necessary
expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business, while
section 174 has a different standard.

Section 174 says that

a taxpayer may deduct research and experimental expenditures
incurred or paid during the taxable year in connection with a
trade or business.
QUESTION:

So that you are still thrown into a

trade or business category.

You have to satisfy that, I take

10

it .
HR. DOAN;

Yes, your Honor.

We have to satisfy the

standard "trade or business."
QUESTION;

How many times has this Court concerned

itself with 174?
MR. DOAN;

Never, your Honor, to my knowledge.

QUESTION;

This is the first time.

MR. DOAN:

Yes, your Honor.

The basis of the respondent’s contention in this
case goes back to an early decision written by this Court
where the theory was advanced that before a taxpayer could be
said to be carrying on a trade or business, he must be
holding himself out as offering for sale goods or services.
We submit that that standard was not intended to
apply to section 174 which was not written until 1954.

We

believe that this is borne out by the legislative history
found in the committee reports in connection with the
development of section 174.

We believe that section 174 was

intended to be a liberalizing provision to allow these
expenditures which otherwise would have to be capitalized to
be deductible in the year incurred.

The legislative history

of 174 indicates a broad purpose, to provide an economic
incentive especially for small and growing businesses to
engage in research for new products and new inventions.
The measure was initially introduced in the Congress

11

in 1951, and the purpose for its introduction was to clarify
the existing confusion in respect to tax treatment of such
expenditures and to prevent tax discrimination between large
existing well-established businesses and their small, beginning
counterparts.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Doan, if this had been done by IBM

or 3M, do you think the Service would have allowed the
deduction?
MR. DOAN;

Yes, your Honor.

The best illustration

of that is Best Universal Lock Company case decided in 19G6
by the Tax Court.

Best Universal Lock Company involved a

corporation, a successful large corporation, based in the
State of Indiana which had historically been in the business
of manufacturing locks.

During the 1960's Best Lock

Company decided to develop a new line of business, and as a
result it commenced a research program on isothermal air
compressors which was admittedly a completely unrelated
line of business.

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue

disallowed it saying that research and development expenses
claimed in this connection were not deductible.

However, the

Tax Court reversed or did not hold for the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue in the case and said that these businesses
were sufficiently — these expenditures were sufficiently
connected with an ongoing business and therefore deductible.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has acquiesced in that

12

decision and in 1973 the Commissioner has issued a revenue
ruling directing the employees at the audit level and on up
through the ranks of the Internal Revenue Service that this
decision will be followed»
QUESTION;

Is the difference between that case and

yours is that they were at least in an ongoing business of
some other sort?
MR» DOAN;

Yes, your Honor, and there lies the

discrimination against my client.
The remarks of Mr» Reed who was then chairman of
the House Committee on Ways and Means, in the hearings on
H.R. 8300, the bill which embodied what was to become the
Revenue Code of 1954, I believe makes this point very clear.
He stated, and I quote, "Present law contains no statutory
provision dealing with the deduction of these expenses.
v';v*T"

The result has been confusion and uncertainty.

Very often

under present lav/, small businesses which are developing
new-products and do not have established research departments
are not allowed to deduct their expenses despite the fact
that the large, well-established competitors can obtain the
deduction.

This provision will greatly stimulate the

search for new products and new inventions upon which the
future economic and military strength of a nation depends.
It will be particularly valuable to small and growing
businesses."

13
Throughout the committee reports, the term pops
up "'small and growing businesses»”

The Under Secretary of

the Treasury when he appeared before that Ways and Means
Committee testifying as to the present treatment of these
expanses used the same analog}/ except that he used the term
that this will help "small pioneering businesses»”
QUESTION:

Mr» Doan, if you lose the case, does

Mr. Snow ever get any tax benefit for it?

Is he allowed in

some way to amortise?
MR. DOAN:

Your Honor, if a taxpayer cannot utilize

section 174 and the expenses are held to be in the category
of preoperating expenses or investigatory type expenses, there
is no provision for any relief for tax purposes except whan
the venture may be abandoned or when it might be sold, that
is the venture itself, not an item within the venture.

There

is no provision for these expenditures being capitalized and
amortized over the useful life because it is and has been
the position of the Treasury that you cannot determine a
useful life and therefore they are not subject to depreciation
or amortization.
QUESTION:

I suppose from the standpoint of the

small pioneering, I think you called it, business, that kind
of deferred tax benefit isnst very useful.
MR, DOAN:

No, your Honor, it is not, especially if

this is a genuine and bona fide business venture where the

14
people are in there trying, they put it together, and it
does become an ongoing business.
a Polaroid, a Xerox, an IBM.

It grows up and it becomes

That capital contribution would

be locked in for any period of time.
QUESTION:

If it becomes one of those three, they

don’t need that very much, do they?
MR. DOAN:

No, your Honor.

Hopefully it will.

We believe, however, the clear congressional intent
is that a small business like Burns whose entire energies
are devoted to a product development effort would seem to be
precisely the kind of taxpayer Congress sought to bring
within the reach of section 174.

The decision by the Sixth

Circuit in Snow, however, makes that section unavailable to
Burns v/hile preserving it to large and well-established
competitors.

The byproduct of that decision in my opinion

will foster monopoly, it w7ill stifle research and development
activity, it will continue the discrimination against small
businesses that section 174 was designed to eliminate.
QUESTION:

I take it there wouldn’t have been any

problem here if there had been a patent iss, a patent had
issued and had been available for licensing.
MR. DOAN:

The decisions are not clear, your Honor.

The test that respondent has suggested would require holding
a product or service for sale.
QUESTION:

Or a patent for licensing.

15
MR. DOAN:

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

The expenditures after that time, that

would be deductible then.
MR. DOAN:

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Not prior.

MR. DOAN:

Not prior to that time.

QUESTION:

Is it conceivable that 174 would have

given some tax relief to small businesses by relieving them
of the requirement for a business deduction that it be
ordinary and necessary without necessarily going as far as
you are asking us to go here?
MR. DOAN:
your Honor.

That is the contention of the respondent,

However, we feel that that is a section 162

standard, but that's only part of it.

Section 162 says

ordinary and necessary in carrying on a trade or business.
There are three elements involved in section 162, the total
standard.
Now, in section 174 Congress did not choose to
include any of those.

Respondent suggests that it was for

the purpose of eliminating the two you mentioned, your Honor,
ordinary and necessary.

However, I contend that the carrying

on standard was also eliminated.
QUESTION:

Because 174 is in connection with rather

Yes, your Honor.

We, of course, rely heavily on Cleveland v. Commis­
sioner , which was decided by the Fourth Circuit.

respondent, on the other hand, relies on a later Fourth

There was no patent as far as I can tell as of

the year at issue in the Cleveland case.

There is no evidence

in the record that the patent was actively held for sale.

expenses involved and incurred by a joint venture between
Cleveland and the inventor in that case, who was Kerla, were
deductible under section 174,

involving expenditures by a corporation before it obtained
a license to start operating a television station.

expenses involved there were section 162 expenses and
involved the training of employees and getting organised and

geared up,commonly known as start-up expenses»
We feel that the Fourth Circuit has crossed the
fine line of distinction between section 174 and section 162,
and we respectfully submit to this Court that a new standard
should be fashioned within section 174 to take care of 174
cases and leave the section 162 standard that has already been
fashioned intact as it exists today.
Thank you, your Honor.
QUESTIONS

This doesn't have anything to do with

this case? I'm just curious.

These trash burners are for

private —
MR. DOAN:

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Is there still some place you can burn

trash in the United States?
MR. DOAN:

Yes, your Honor.

I'm glad you asked

that question»
QUESTION:

No place I know of.

MR. DOAN:

One of the problems — and this is not

in the record.
QUESTION:

It has nothing to do with the case.

MR. DOAN:

One of the problems Burns Investment

Company ran into in 1966 was a pollution standard problem.
QUESTION:

That's what we are worried about.

MR. DOAN:

Now, the device has been perfected at

this point in time and it does meet pollution standards.

I

18
thought I would get in the commercial.
Thank you.
QUESTIONS

Various municipalities have ordinances

specifying requirements for trash burning, isn’t that right?
MR. DOAN:

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

I have a trash burner but it doesn’t

satisfy the requirements of the county regulations out West
so I can’t use it.
MR. DOAN;

I am informed that the trash burner

in this case does now satisfy all of the ordinances that we
know about to date.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Doan.

Mr. Smith.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SMITH:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I think I would like to refer to the text of the

statute which is set forth in Appendix A of our brief.

This

statute provides that, a taxpayer may treat research or
experimental expenditures which are paid or incurred by him
during the taxable year in connection with his trade or
business as expenses which are not chargeable to capital
account.
Subsection (to) provides for an election to amortise
such expenses over a period of time not less than 60 months.

19
Now, this case focuses upon statutory requirement
which exists in both subsection (a) and subsection (b) that
the expenditures be incurred in connection with the taxpayer’s
trade or business.
QUESTION;

Is your view of that that the trade or

business must already be an ongoing business?
MR. SMITH;

Yes.

In our view the term "trade or

business" has had a long and honored history under the Taxing
Act

as recognized by this Court that the tax law has long

drawn a distinction between investment activities or income”
producing activities and that trade or business connotes
something more than that, more them the hope of a profit, it
connotes a holding oneself out as available for selling goods
or services.
Now, this case involves only 1966, and the courts
below I. think properly confined their attention to the events
of that year.

Now, in that year you had a situation where

Trofctf the purported inventor, had this idea for a product.
He needed some financing.

He asked several of his friends to

give him some money,and ultimately a limited partnership
venture was formed,

the petitioner here contributing $10,000,

I think, for a 4 percent limited partnership interest.
Now, the important thing in our view is what exactly
happened in 1966, and I think the findings of fact of the
Tax Court are not disputed in this regard that what happened

20
simply was that a very crude prototype model was developed?
patent counsel examined it, looked at it and said simply that
it wasn't reduced to practice, that it didn’t work properly
and that additional work would have to be done on it.

Ultimately

the partnership spent the rest of its $40,000 initial capital
31 think in the next year, 1967, and then ultimately as both
courts below alluded to, more work had to be done on it and
the device radically changed before the ultimate patent was
applied for in 1969 and received in 1970.

The device became

a very different device.
Now, in our view --QUESTION:

Has the Service — 1 assume this is

outside the record — has the Service ever recognised that
this particular taxpayer has now qualified under 174 in
subsequent taxable years?
MR. SMITH:
the record.

That, Mr. Justice Blackman, is outside

What can be pieced together essentially is that

the partnership went out of existence in 1968 or 1969.

A

corporation was formed called the Burns Investment Corporation.
That's in the Tax Court findings of fact.

Whether that

corporation, whether the shareholders of that corporation are
the same as the limited partners here is unclear from the
record.

I would just assume, speculate, that probably is

the case that the partners contributed the partnership
assets to the corporation in a tax exchange.

I think that is

21

probably what happened.
QUESTION:

Perhaps the other partnerships, too,

went into it.
MR. SMITH; Perhaps Echo and Courier also went the
same way.
QUESTION;

If it had to be an ongoing business

created.
MR. SMITH;

Yes.

Essentially — Mr. Doan pointed

out that the Service did not disturb petitioners' claimed
deductions for 174 treatment for the other partnerships in
the year 1965,

That is probably the case, although I think

it's quite irrelevant.

It was simply an oversight or, you

know, the Service has to set priorities for its audit work.
QUESTION;

Mr. Smith, you state that the Government's

position is that there must be an ongoing trade or business.
Let's assume for the moment that Burns did have an ongoing
business in the manufacture and sale of some other product
and that at the same time this inventor commenced work on
the incinerator.

Would that partnership have been entitled

under your position here today to deduct the expenses of
that work?
MR, SMITH:
Powell.

I think it probably would, Mr. Justice

I think that that flows from the Service's

acquiescence in the Best Lock Company case.

There was a case

where the company was clearly in the business of manufacturing

22
locks.

The Tax Court’s findings —■ the Internal Revenue

Service, however, disallowed claimed 174 deductions for the
development of an isothermal air compressor, and the Tax
Court in its opinion said simply that that disallowance
ignored that corporation’s long history of experimentation
in its efforts to develop new products.

I think once you

have an ongoing trade or business, I think it’s a statutory
matter you have a trade or business in connection with which
research or experimental expenditures would be incurred, I
think they would.
QUESTIONS

Would it make any difference at all if

the incinerator was totally dissimilar to the other product
then being manufactured?
MR. SMITH:

Apparently there is a case called

Mayrath, decided by the Fifth Circuit, which involved the
situation of a man who developed, who invented farm implements,
and then he spent a lot of money on an experimental home.
The Service disallowed that deduction.

There was very little

in the way of focusing on the question as to whether — he was
clearly an inventor, having invented and sold farm products,
but the Fifth Circuit simply said that this was an experimental
home in which he was living and then they were classified
simply as personal expenses.
I think that the Service probably would like to
reserve some leeway, so to speak, if the products are totally

23
unrelated, you know, to each other, because the Best Universal
Lock Company case rested in part, I think, on the corporation's
long history of experimentation.

But I think that as a

general matter the acquiescence in that case I think stands
for the proposition that if you have an ongoing business,
which was clearly not the case here in 1966, that research
or experimental expenditures expended to develop a new
product would come within 174 treatment.
QUESTION:

It would be hard to be more unrelated

than in the Lock case.
MR. SMITH:

I suspect so.

I mean, you have an

isothermal air compressor
QUESTION:

Well, suppose a soap manufacturer

actually this one was connected with Proctor & Gamble, wasn't
it?

They

are constantly in research and development in

various soap products, detergents, and all that stuff.
Suppose they had taken on the development of this incinerator.
MR. SMITH;

Well, I think we would have a more

difficult task.
QUESTION;
MR. SMITH:

Wouldn't that be the Lock case?
It probably would be the Lock case.

I don't think we have to worry about that here because I
think under the Court's Whipple opinion and the long history
of separating corporations from their employees, I think
there is no suggestion here that we can attribute the

24
business of Proctor & Gamble to the petitioner in this case.
QUESTION:

Going back to my question to your

opposing counsel about 3M or IBM having done precisely this,
as I take it is Mr. Justice Brennan’s question, do I detect
from your answer that probably they would have been given the
deduction?
MR. SMITH:

Probably would have been given the

deduction because they are in the — they would be deemed to
be engaged in a trade or business.
I would like to address myself to another question
that you asked during Mr. Doan's argument, and that is what
the ultimate effect would be, what the ultimate tax benefit
of these expenditures would be.

I don't think that it’s

entirely clear that they are lost forever.

I think that if

the partnership had continued, I think that there certainly
is an arguable case for saying that these things could have
been — 'the election could have been made to amortise the
expenditures.

In fact, the amortization aspect of the

statute is exactly designed to help the kind of small
pioneering business that Mr. Doan has —
QUESTION:

That is figured also by being in a

trade or business.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, that is true, but the point is

that the election to amortise — assuming that the partnership

test of being in a trade or business, the amortisation
provisions provide that the election to amortize begin with
the first year in which benefits from the expenditures are
derived»

So, assuming that a few years went on and then

the partnership ultimately held these things out for sale,
I think that the partnership would have a strong case then to
say, "We elect the amortisation provision because we are in
a trade or business."

I think what we are talking about here is

a bona fide enterprise,

I think when Congress inserted the

term "trade or business" here, this was done against the
background of a long distinction between a trade or business
and investment activities.

This Court in about 1940 had held

in the Higgins case that the management of one’s personal
investment portfolio, even if it required the hiring of
several people and the leasing of an office, was not a trade
or business, and the expenses in connection therewith were
not deductible.
significant.

What Congress did in 1942 1 think is

It enacted section 212 which did not enlarge the

category of trade or business expenses? it simply created a
new category of non-trade or business expenses.
that's really the key to this case.
QUESTION?

QUESTION;

Certainly 174 was intended to do something

for research and development expenditures which 212 and 162

MR. SMITH:

Yes, I think it was intended to do

something, and I think what it. was intended to do, as we

28
suggest in our brief, was to relieve the necessity of
qualifying under the "ordinary" standard of section 162 because
research and development expenditures are traditionally the
kinds of things that relate to the creation of income
and benefits derived in

a' future year.

That is the

traditional kind of nondeductible capital expenditure.
Taxpayers also had a problem because of the
difficulty of determining if at all whether such expenditures
could be depreciated because of the difficulty of tagging it
to the useful life of the particular asset.
QUESTION:

Do you think 174 as read means that you

may deduct those expenses which absent 174 would have been
chargeable to capital?
MR. SMITH:

Yes.

"ordinary" standard.

MR. SMITH:

Go ahead.
I'm sorry.

It's a slightly unrelated

thing.
QUESTION;

Well, let me ask you something else.

I'd like to get to a homely hypothetical that's not quite
IBM or Xerox or 3M.

Suppose a man has a conception of how

to handle or how to raise chickens, a new way to develop an
incubator.

So he quits whatever he is doing, teaching in

the physics department in the university or what not, buys
himself a piece of land and a house and then begins to build

30
this new kind of cages and applied research and development
and develops a bunch of sheds and barns with the incubators.
Finally is satisfied that it probably will work and buys
himself a couple thousand eggs.

But he isn't in business,

he can't afford a telephone, he can't afford any employees.
His wife and his son do all this.
Now, then, he reaches a point where it's feasible.
He organises a corporation to carry it on for the future.
Under the framework of the Government5 s view of
this case, would this year, or work done in this taxable
year on the development of these incubators, sheds, all the
things I have described and a lot that you can imagine filling
in, deductible or not?
MR. SMITI-I:

Well, I think as research or

experimental, it's been —
QUESTION:

Maybe he hasn't sold any — he's bought

eggs to turn into chickens.

He hasn't sold a chicken? he

hasn't advertised, hasn't done anything.

He gets into

business the next year.
MR. SMITH:

I think in our view of the case that

would be a problem, there would be a problem in deducting
that.

I think that curing the hypothetical in some respects

might be if he had energetically sought to interest someone
in purchasing or entering into a contract with him to
provide the kinds of services that he ultimately hoped to

31

ultimately provide from his idea.

I think that under the

statute, I think, though, that the amortization election
would be best suited.
QUESTIONS

If the business were a great success,

he might get it when it was immaterial to him, and if it was
a failure, it would be academic, would it not?

RESUMED ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SMITH:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice * and may it please

Resuming the Government's presentation of the

Snow case, I think the best way to describe how the statute
works, section 174 of the Code, is to simply suggest to the
Court that there are two types of capital expenditures that
could occur in any particular situation.

There is the

capital expenditure that is incurred before one enters a
trade or business, and then capital expenditures which are
incurred after the commencement of the trade or business.
Now, in our view, section 174 is only designed to
cover the second category of capital expenditures.

It makes

them subject to the option to either current deduct or to
amortise over five years.

Thus the insertion, in our view,

of the term "trade or business” in the statute requires that
the research or experimental expenditures be incurred by
an ongoing business in order to come within the purview of
the statute.
Petitioner's references in the legislative history
to the fact that Congressmen referred to the fact that
small businesses -- that the statute was designed to benefit

34

small businesses,, I think it should be emphasised to the
extent that those remarks had relevance, the important thing
is that it was still a business that was designed to be
benefited* that "trade or business" is a technical term under
the Code* it appears in many provisions* it has been
interpreted by the courts to require

the holding of oneself

out as engaged in selling goods or services* and if Congress
wanted to simply make all research or experimental expenditures
deductible v,without regard to the context in which -they were
incurred, I think it could have easily employed the standard
it used in 1342 when section 212 came into the Code, that
is, expenditures incurred in connection with the production —
for the production of income.

The fact that it didn’t do that

and the fact that Congress created this special type of
non-trade or business expenditures but yet nevertheless used
the term "trade or business" in section 174 is to us dispositive
of the matter in terms of requiring that a stricter standard'
be employed in this case.
hnd 1 think that the standard is important because
the trade or business test provides, in our view, an objective
criterion with which to measure, to separate out, so to speak,
simple personal activities, that is, someone tinkering in
his basement with something that he thinks some day may
amount to something, and spending money on that sort of thing,
and someone who is seriously interested in developing a

35
product and carries it; through to the point in which income
and benefits are derived from that expenditure.
Now, I want to also point out to the Court that —
QUESTION;

if I understand you, if IBM sets this up, he

starts collecting the first year.
MR, SMITH:

Well, the fact that IBM sets this up

in the IBM example, Mr. Justice Marshall, I think the fact
of the matter is that there is no quarrel about the fact
that IBM is an ongoing trade or business and is engaged in
a trade or business.

It is holding itself out as engaged

in the selling of goods or services,

/And as a result, under

the case law and under the Commissioner”s view of the statute
QUESTION;
MR, SMITH;

The statute is available for the

election to either amortize or —
QUESTION;

It doesn’t depend that they are actually

working on this -MR, SMITH:

No.

I was addressing myself, I think,

to the ongoing business.
QUESTION;
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR, SMITH;

If IBM had set up Snow, right?
Yes.
It collects,
The statute would apply in that case

because IBM is engaged in a trade or business and the

36

expenditures are incurred in connection with the trade or
business.
QUESTION:

And Snow went out of business in '67, IBM

would still collect for '66,
MR. SMITH:

That is correct.

But the point of the matter is that that simply is
not involved here.

What we have here is no trade or

business within, the tax year under scrutiny, 1966.
Now, the petitioner focuses upon the fact that
there is an alleged difference in terminology between sections
162 and 174.

Ke says that you have the phrase "incurred in

carrying on a trade or business" in section 162 and you have
the phrase "incurred in connection with a trade or business"
in section 174.

In our view this terminology is equivalent.

The committee reports for section 212 use the phrases
interchangeablyo

In fact, the Commissioner’s regulations

under section 162 used the phrase "in connection with" and
"incurred in carrying on" interchangeably.

I don't think

there is any difference between those two statutory
expressions.

The fact of the matter is both require the

existence of an ongoing trade or business.
Now, the connection between section 162 and 174 is
in our view —
QUESTION:

IBM couldn't deduct these research

expenditures under 162, could it; if

it did what Snow did

37
here?
MR. SMITH:

That is correct/ because they probably

would not fit within the ordinary standard.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Or necessary,
Necessary is simply regarded as a --

I don't think "necessary",- the term "necessary" is involved
in the case.

I think it’s the term "ordinary."

And the

fact that the term "ordinary" was deleted from section 174/ in
our view, is the key to what this section was designed to do,
make what would otherwise be capital expenditures incurred
by an ongoing business currently deductible.
Now, the connection between 162 and 174 was made
by what we think is the more current and correct rule of the
Fourth Circuit in the Richmond Television Corporation case,
because while that case involved a corporation and involved
a claimed deduction for expenditures under 162, the Court
nevertheless cited in a footnote not only the classic, what
we regard —
QUESTION?.

Could I ask you this question before I

forget it?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION?

Sure.
Assume Snow here had rented an office

and got a telephone and hired a secretary, they needed
correspondence and what not, I take it you would have the
same position with respect to the rent paid for the office?

38

MR. SMITHs

I think we probably would have the same

position with regard to the rent paid for the office.

I

think the important thing here is that within the meaning of
the test, there was no holding oneself out as engaged in
selling goods or services, because as a factual matter they
had nothing whatever
QUESTION:

What happens to the expenses paid out

for the rent of the office?

They aren’t just capitalized,

surely?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION*
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Well ~
Are they losses?
I suspect that they —
You say they’re not deductible, so ■—
I think in the partnership context, I

think they probably would have to increase the basis of each
partner's partnership interest and to the extent that they
might be subsequently amortized at a later date, they might
be amortized — I see your point because the point is that,
it deals with rental for a particular year.

But I think that

essentially the problem is the same problem that the Court is
facing under the consideration of the Idaho Power case,
QUESTION:

If they were deductible at all under 162,

you would be in great trouble here, I suppose.
MR. SMITH:

I think our position is that they are

not because they are in connection with — I think the issue

39

in Idaho Power is the same, you are talking about depreciation
of construction equipment and there, while it's an annual
expense, it nevertheless has to go into the basis of the
asset that's ultimately created.
QUESTION:

Let me add to Justice XJhite's hypothetical

another but nonrecurring item of expense.

Suppose they called

a professional employment agency and said, "Here is the staff
we think we will need.

We will need X number of executives

and so many stenographers, and a shop foreman,"

and a whole

list, and engage them on a professional basis for hire.

Now,

have they got into business yet, along with the office?
MR. SMITH:

I think the critical thing is really

holding oneself out as engaged in

if the product had

gotten to the point where they could offer it for sale and
make, enter into pecuniary arrangements with people who are
willing to pay for something

that they had, third parties,

I think then that they would be engaged in a trade or business.
QUESTION:

You say they would have to be trading

with somebody or actually doing business with somebody.
MR. SMITH:

There would have to be an ongoing

business with someone selling something —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Or offering —

They may be

ultimately unsuccessful.
QUESTION:

And it must relate to the product which

40

is ultimately to be distributed, is that right?
MR. SMITH:

Yes. it must relate to the product which —

I have one final point if I may just for a moment.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. SMITH:

Just briefly.

Petitioner raises the hypothetical of

what might be considered the usual type of investment in a
real estate venture and says, welly isn't it clear that interest
is deductible during the construction period of a project.
And the simple answer to that is that in section 163 Congress
provided for the deduction of interest without regard to any
trade or business nexus or any production of income nexus
whatever.

It simply is interest incurred on an indebtedness.

And we think the analogy is false? we think that this case has
to be viewed within the trade or business nexus of the
statute.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smithy I hold you for a moment.

I

have two quick ones.
Suppose that on December 1st* we're on a calendar
year base, Mr. Snow did get into a trade or business within
the services concept.

Would you permit the deduction of

research and development expense incurred in the preceding
10 months of that calendar year?
MR. SMITH;

I think that since the system is an

annual accounting system, I am not sure of the answer to this,
but I think probably yes, simply because we are talking about

41
incurred within, during the taxable year, and if we are
talking about a calendar year, I think the answer to that
would be yes,
QUESTION;

And secondly, I admittedly haven't

gotten into the legislative history, but what brought about
174?

Was this brought into the Code at the behest of the

Service, or was it, as it were, imposed on the Service by
some group of taxpayers who were able to persuade the Congress
to put it in?

Do you know?

MR. SMITH;
question,

I am not sure I know the answer to that

I think it was simply a general dissatisfaction

with the fact that such expenditures were being disallowed
as capital expenditures because they did not relate to the
production ~~ they did not derive any benefit within the
taxable year,

I think Congress simply eliminated the"ordinary

requirement,

I don't think there is any feeling inherent --

there were private people who testified, and as Mr, Doan has
pointed out, the Under Secretary of the Treasury testified
also,

I don't think I can give you a precise answer to that

question,
QUESTION;

Many times these things are imposed upon

the Service,
MR, SMITH;

That is true,

I didn’t find any

suggestion of that in the legislative history.

MR. DOAMs

If I may respond to the last comment

first, in 1951 Representative Camp indicated that the American
Bar Association had urged section 174.
I would also like to point out that I believe the
issue has really boiled down to whether or not the petitioner
Snow was in a trade or business, that is, whether or not there
was a trade or business in existence, not whether or not he
was carrying on a trade or business.

And in that regard, if

I might draw from the regulations under a different Code
section, and that is section 248, the regulations under that
section define existence of a trade or business versus the
beginning of a trade or business.

amortisation of organization• expenditures 9 which is the type
of expenditures that is very much akin to a section 174 type
of expenditure, that is, preoperating type of expenditure.
The regulations as promulgated by the Commissioner
says that if the activities of the corporation have advanced
to the extent necessary to establish the nature of its

business, the business operation, however, it will be deemed
to have begun business.
QUESTION;

What is that section again, Mr. Doan?

MR. DOAN;

That is section 248, your Honor.

For example, the acquisition of operating assets
which are necessary to the type of business contemplated may
constitute the beginning of business.
And may it please the Court, I submit to you that
Burns Investment Company had acquired everything it needed
to carry on the operation contemplated by Burns Investment
Company.

It had entered into a contract with a separate

corporation to manufacture these prototype models, and this
is specifically permitted under the regulations under section
174.

It had contracted for these services; it had collected

the capital from the partners.

point? and that is amortization versus deductibility of
expenses under section 174.

That? X submit, is a choice.

If

he can amortize these expenses, he can deduct these expenses
under section 174.

The only remedy available to my client if

it is held that Burns Investment Company is not engaged in a
trade or business is a capitalization of these expenditures
without any depreciation available to him.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:19 p.m., the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.]
