MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 72-1019, Sea-Land Services, Inc., v. Helen Stein
Gaudet.
Mr. McClendon?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. MCCLENDON, ESQ..
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MCCLENDON:

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
We're here today for a discussion and a — and hope­
fully, a clarification of the rights of litigants under the
General Maritime Law, and under the wrongful death recovery
allowed by the Court, in the Moragne case in 1970,

At that

time, when the Court overruled the Harrisburg, and allowed re­
covery under General Maritime Lax-/ for wrongful death, the
Court did not set any stringent or specific guidelines for
future cases, but stated that the sifting through the courts
would bring about, hopefully, a consistent lav/ in this area.
In the case before us today, Mr.Gaudet was injured
in 1966.

He was a foreman — longshoreman — he was injured

aboard a vessel in the Mississippi River in the port of New
Orleans.

He instituted suit in U.S. District Court, and

brought it to judgement for the amount of $175,000.00.

Ten

days after the - jury award, which was rendered in the court of
proper jurisdiction, Mr. Gaudet died.

4
His widow did not come into those proceedings re­
questing any damages for his death, or any modification of the
award.

Post trial motions were filed, and these were rejected

by the trial court.

The matter was appealed to the Fifth

Circuit, and the appeal failed, and the judgement was paid.
Mrs. Gaudet proceeded with a separate suit, alleging
that she had sustained severe financial loss as a result of
the death of her husband.

And, after reversing the trial

court’s rejection of her claim, the Fifth Circuit has rendered
a decision stating that the previously received judgement was
not a bar to her actions for wrongful death.

We would like

to briefly point out that, the Courts have recognized, although
at times have been confused over the difference between a
survival action and a wrongful death action; survival being
purely the right of the survivors of a decedent to recover for
the damages which he sustained during his lifetime.

The

survival action — the damages there — terminate at the time
of death.
The wrongful death action, on the other hand, is a
right of recovery for the decedents for their damages sustain­
ed after the death of the individual.
This Court has dealt with these matters in the Flynn
case, in the Mellon v„ Goodyear, and the Michigan v. Freelands
cases? and all of these were F.E.L.A. cases, which took Lord
Campbell’s Act, which had -— which was referred to in the

5
Moragne decision, and said that the right of recovery for
wrongful death is a right which only exists if in the decedent
there existed a right at the time of his death.

And we are

here today because the Fifth Circuit has said that even though
Mr. Gaudet had received a judgement — had obtained a judge­
ment — that, in some manner, the widow had a right to re- —
to go forward with the claim fox* wrongful death.
We submit that the claim for wrongful death is a
derivative action? and is derived from the initial tort —
the initial injury — we're not dealing with an instantaneous
death, which was not dealt with in these cases.

We're dealing

with an injury which results in certain injuries to the indi­
vidual and then, at some time later, there is death — weeks,
or months, or, in several of these cases, many years later,
&nd the Courts have held, especially in the Mellon case, that
the right is a derivative right, and it derives from the ori­
ginal injury which the injured man sustained at the time he
was involved in the accident.

And if there is no viable cause

of action, or right on his part, immediately prior to his
death, that his heirs cannot renew their right to claim their
damages»
This is the question which one of the — questions
before the Court today.

We also submit it on our petition for

writs that if the Court should find that the recovery is pro­
per, then the uniformity which is desired in Federal law in

6

Admiralty and Maritime matters., and which has been consistently
followed in the Jones Act in the Death on the High seas, and
in the cases since Moragne, in 1972, that the Fifth Circuit is
departing from this by allowing damages for nonpecuniary loss.
All of the cases under the Jones Act, Death on the High Seas,
and General Maritime Law, have stated that the claim of the
defendant — the damages of the — defendant must pay are pe­
cuniary, and loss of love and affection, society, companionship,
consortium, are not recoverable.
Since Mrs. Gaudefc inherited the judgement of her hus­
band in the amount of $175,000.00, and eventually collected it,
we submit that this is full pecuniary recovery for the damages
that were sustained, and that the only recovery which, we sub­
mit, there should not be any, but if the Court should say that
in some manner a cause of action exists, even though there
wasn't one at the time of death, then, we submit, that in order
to maintain uniformity that only non- —- pecuniary losses
should be allowed, and that these have already been paid in
this case.
This is the matter before the Court today.

If the

Court has any questions, we would be happy to —
Q

Mr. McClendon, you indicated that Mrs. Gaudet

inherited the estate of her husband.
MR. MCCLENDON!
Q

Yes, sir.

Suppose this were not the case; and, 1 take it,

7
this cou3.d be possible in Louisiana — I do not know.

But if

this were a child — if there were no widow, or something,
would it make any difference in your statement of the case?
MR. MCCLENDON:

I don't feel so, your Honor, that

it — there was no question that she was the proper represen­
tative, and as surviving spouse she did, in fact, inherit —
Q

But I wondered whether there was any legal sig­

nificance in the fact that she had .inherited it?
MR. MCCLENDON:

No, your Honor, except for the fact

that we had let —* we submit that it became a property right
which was then inherited by the heirs at the time of death.
That when the jury award was rendered that a cause of action
ceased to exist, and it was merged into a property right, which
was then inherited by her? that the cause of action was not
pending.

If it had been pending -- if there was a pending

claim at the time of death, we feel the law is clear, that
there can be an amendment, or a merger, of the claim of the
decedent for his damages into a wrongful death action.
But if the claim of the decedent for his damages
has been terminated by settlement, by prescription, by statute
of limitations, or by judgement, then there — this precludes
any right of the heirs of the --Q

Well, I understand your theory, but it seems to

me it does not depend on the fact of inheritance, and that’s —
this is what I wish to be assured about.

Suppose there were

no widow»

Suppose Mr. Gaudet had — was a widower.

I take it,

in Louisiana yon have wrongful death a possibility as, at least,
for surviving minor children?
MR. MCCLENDON:

Yes, sir.

There are minor children's

rights and ascendants ~~
Q

And suppose they were not -- did not inherit in

any way his estate.
MR. MCCLENDONS
Q

We'd still have the problem, would we not?

MR. MCCLENDONs
Q

Yes, sir.

All right, all right.

MR. MCCLENDON:
Q

If there was —

I think so.

Mr. McClendon, I haven’t thought about this for

a good many years, but, as I remember, there are two different
basic kinds of wrongful death actions.

One is a Lord Campbell's

type -- The Lord Campbell’s Act type, in which the survivors
inherit the cause of action that the decedent would have had.
And then there is a quite a different kind of a statutory action
in which the survivors are given an independent cause of action
for the death of the decedent.
MR. MCCLENDON:
Q

Am I right about that?

MR. MCCLENDON:
Q

Yes, your Honor.
I —

Not wanting to ~

And then there may be some merged classification

somewhere in between those two theoretical causes of action.

3

And, wouldn't it depend here on which — wouldn't the answer
to the problem in this case depend upon which kind of wrongful
death action we •— the Court was talking about in Moragne?
MR, MCCLENDON
Q

%

Your Honor, not —

Or Moragne, as it's sometimes called.

MR. MCCLENDON:

-- not wishing to argue with coun- —

with the Court, but it's submitted that the Lord Campbell's
Act actually was a wrongful death statute which gave to the
dependents a right to —
Q

An. independent

MR. MCCLENDON:

action?

-- an independent right of action

which did, however, depend upon the existence —
Q

Of a right of action of the decedent

MR. MCCLENDON:

— of the right at the time of

At the time of death.
And in the Carroll case, which is a. case from the

Supreme Court, on — the Court said they — the two can be
merged, if the first has not been extinguished, then it can be
merged into the claim of the dependents.
spearate causes of action.

But they are two

We prefer, for clarity, to try to

distinguish between a survival action, which

perhaps half of

the states have, which enables the representative of the de­
cedent to carry on the claim that he had sustained during his
lifetime.
Q

And that's a survival -- that's an inheritance

3.0

of the cause of action that the decedent had»
MR. MCCLENDON:
Q

Exactly.

But then there is another theory —

MR. MCCLENDON:

Nell, there’s the wrongf- — the true

wrongful death act, which is the Lord Campbell’s Act —
Q

That is the only test I have ever —

MR. MCCLENDON:

— in which every state, is the right

of the dependents to sue for thsir damages which have occurred,
of course, after
Q

For the loss of the decedent by death.

MR. MCCLENDON:

For the loss.

Yes, sir.

But the

Lord Campbell's Act, which was, you might say, the original
true wrongful death act, said that since this is a derivative
action which goes back to the initial — the original tort —■
that, in order for the dependents to exercise their cause of
action after the death of the decedent, there had to be in ex­
istence at the time of death, a right on the part of the de­
cedent. himself to sue for his damages.

And if he extinguished

that right in some manner, this extinguishes the separate right
of the dependents.
Q

Well, how about the matter of damages?

Now, in

the original action here by the decedent was it shown indis­
putably that there was total and permanent disability?
MR. MCCLENDON:

Yes, sir, I believe there was, and

I’m sure counsel will bring this out in his arguments.

The

11

award was $175,000.00.

The injury was a back injury? he'd

had surgery? the psychiatrist had said that it had created
emotional problems? that he had become addicted to his own
medication —- he was having a drug addiction problem? and he
was severely emotionally disturbed? and he was about 45-yearold man at the time, with approximately 20-year work life
expectancy.

Evidence was submitted as to his total inability

to work for life.
Q

Total and permanent disability.

MR. MCCLENDON:

Yes, sir.

This was the contention.

Of course, being a jury award, there was no break-down in the
award as to x^hat portions —
Q

But I suppose the defendant disputed that,

didn't they?
MR. MCCLENDON;
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, we did.

I'm thinking of a case — let's take a case —

the facts in this case really aren't all that -- they aren't
spelled out.

But let's take a case of a tortious injury —

personal injury — that appears, at the time of the award by
a jury to the injured party, to be partial, permanent disa­
bility, let's say? and then the award is made, and then the
man, a month after the award, gets complications which are
eoncededly and directly attributable to these personal in­
juries; and he then dies in a year.

And now it's very clear

that he's a total loss to his dependents as far as his earning

12

power goes„

Would there be a cause of action then for his

wrongful death, under your theory?
MR. MCCLENDONs

No, sir, because of the desire of all

of Courts to bring them into litigation, and when the matter
was — the evidence was produced at the initial trial, it an­
ticipated everything that would happen to him.
Q

To him.

Now —

Now, I know that it's very clear that

he couldn't bring another lav/suit to say, "Well, look, I was —■
the jury was wrong -- and the evidence was wrong," and I fully
understand that.

That's a commonplace — he can't bring another

lawsuit? his lawsuit is settled, rightly or wrongly.
MR. MCCLENDON:
Q

We submit that the claim of the —

But now he dies, and the question is, do his —

what, if any, additional cause of action do his dependents
have for his wrongful death, attributable to that same tortious
— ?
MR. MCCLENDON:
Q

We submit —

~ injury?

MR. MCCLENDON:

We submit, your Honor, that since it

is a derivative right which goes back to the original tort,
and must continue in a viable state until the death, that the
judgement, even though it may have been inadequate, extinguishes
it.

And the dependents — small children, perhaps, with many

years of dependency -— are precluded from making any claim.
Q

And how about elements of damage?

In his own

13

lawsuit, of course, he can recover, I assume, for things like
his own pain and suffering.
MR. MCCLENDON:
Q

Yes, sir.

Can his dependents, in a wrongful death action,

recover for his pain and suffering?
MR. MCCLENDON:

Well, under the General Maritime

Law — under the Law, no? under the statutes, no.

Now, the

Courts, of course, have gone into the state statutes, and
gone into -the state wrongful death, and to the state survivor
statutes.
Q
their loss of

But they can recover, on the other hand, for
the widow can recover, perhaps — you say,

not in Maritime Law, but that's the question — that there
might be other elements of damage -MR. MCCLENDON:
Q

Yes, sir —

—• as contrasted to his pain and suffering, for

which they, perhaps could not recover.

They could, on the

other hand, as con- — recover for their loss of companion­
ship and consortium.
MR. MCCLENDON:

Yes, sir.

And, of course, loss of

support is a very large item of -- in a wrongful death claim,
in the event that the death has occurred almost immediately
with the accident.

Then the dependents have a very large

claim for the loss of support -Q

Loss of support, but which would be less, maybe,

14
than his own cause of action if he were, indeed, totally and
permanently disabled, his loss of earnings would be greater
because they would — that loss would have had to have supported
him during the balance of his life, and now he’s dead.
MR. MCCLENDON;

Yes, sir; yes, sir, this is true.

This is true.
Q
direction:

May I put a question on the same line and another
What if he died on the first day of the trial of

this case, or at some time before the verdict.

How many causes

of action would have existed, and what would be the elements
of damage?
MR. MCCLENDON:

There would be two causes of action:

His own cause of action would survive, and would be ■—

In the widow?

MR. MCCLENDON:

— of the estate if there were no widow.

MR. MCCLENDON:

And then there would coma into exis­

tence, at the time of death, a wrongful death action for the
dependents for their loss of -the loved one.

There would be

two causes of action? but there was only one wrong —- the
initial accident.
a wrong.

The Courts have not looked at the death as

They have looked at it more as an item of damages

that flowed from the initial wrong.

And so, when the claim of

the decedent has been extinguished, insofar as it relates to

15

the wrong, the Courts have said that the death does not bring
into existence a cause of action — a — it's not a new tort,
it’s just an element of damage.
Q

You say two causes of action.

MR. MCCLENDON:

No, sir.

Two trials, also?

They may be merged, and

were merged in the Carroll case, which is a Supreme Court
case, and which are commonly merged — commonly merged when
death occurs shortly after the accident, or simultaneously
with it.

The —- of course, if it's a simultaneous death ~

an instantaneous death — there would be no survival action.
Yes, sir.
Q

If, say a seaman sues for injuries under the

Jones Act, and that occurred on the high seas -MR. MCCLENDON:
Q

Yes, sir, it could.

And then he dies.

And than -- is there an

action under the Death on the High Seas Act there?
MR. MCCLENDON:
Q

Yes, sir,,

On behalf of whom?

MR. MCCLENDON:

There is a survival —■ well, in the

question —

MR. MCCLENDON:

Q

Well, you submit, but are there holdings —

MR. MCCLENDON:
your Honor.
Q

We don’t have holdings on Jones Act,

We don’t •— all of the holdings under F.E.L.A. —
Well, what about Death on the High Seas Act?

MR. MCCLENDON:

Let’s see.

Under the Death on the

High Seas Act, if he had recovered during his lifetime?
are no cases under Death on the High Seas, as
the

There

I — as we see

They’re all under F.E.L.A.
Q

Well, Congress — under Death on the High Seas

Act, Congress has not made it a precondition that a cause of
action exist at the time of death?

MR. MCCLENDON;

Actually, in Death on the High Seas

Act, the rule is rather harsh.

It says that if the injured

man had a suit underway, so to speak, and he dies —
Q

Yes —

MR. MCCLENDON:

— then all of his claims for pain

and. suffering are extinguished and —*
O

Yes —

MR'. MCCLENDON:

— cannot be passed on to his heirs,

but they do get the wrongful death claim for their loss.

But

his funeral expenses, and pain and suffering claim —

Q

But, what if he — what if he is already re­

Q

You’ve got a judgement

covered?

MR. MCCLENDON:

We don’t have any cases on the Death

17
on the High Seas Act»

But if it is a result of the F.E.L.A.,

which is what Death on the High Seas is, it came from the F.E.
Q

The Jones Act is what incorporates F.E.L.A.

Death on the High Seas Act is something else»
MR. MCCLENDON:
Q

You are correct, sir.

It doesn't involve seamen.

MR. MCCLENDON:

Then we do not have cases, and we

do not know of cases, which have dealt with this problem.
Q

But, under the Death on the. High Seas Act, in

the event there is an action, the elements of recovery are
pecuniary only?
MR. MCCLENDON;
Q

Yes, sir.

Pecuniary only.

The survivor — assuming he does have a good

Death on the High Seas Act action?
MR. MCCLENDON;
Q

Yes.

The elements of his damage do not include pain

and suffering — ?
MR, MCCLENDON;

Do not include *— well, no, sir.

The pain and suffering would be the decedent's right claim —
Q

So, well, again I ask you;

It does not include

the damage to the heirs — do not include pain and suffering,

No, sir, they do not.

They are —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Reese?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE W. REESE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. REESE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I think the questions that were asked about (let me
get ray notes) — about the inheritance and the damages are
particularly interesting in Louisiana, because what happened
to this judgement is, the lady had a son who was a major, and in
Louisiana, with, one child the surviving widow inherits the
community property, which this happens to be •— a judgement
of a husband is a community p.roperty — she inherits half of
the judgement directly and her child, who is a major, not de­
pendent and wouldn’t have a claim under Moragne,by the way —
Q

You mean, he’s a major, not a minor —

MR. REESE:
Q

Yes.

Or is he a major in the Army?

19
MR. REESE:

He is a major, not a minor.

Yes, and

he therefore itfould not have a pecuniary loss involved in his
father's death, and therefore would not have been a. claimant
under the Moragne decision.

And he did inherit the — what

we call the -- well, his mother inherited a usufruct of his
half,,

It gets a little complicated, depending on the number

of children — if there are more children, the mother's half
portion goes down -— the children's portion goes up; she in­
herits her share, her portion, in —■ I guess they call it
fee simple and common law — and she gets a usufruct — and
I don’t know what the word is in common law for it, but she
get the use of it during her lifetime, or until she remarries
Q

Life estate, I guess, there —

MR. REESE:
Q

Sir?

Life estate, or something like that.

MR. REESE:

Yes, I think it is life estate.

I've

never taken that
Q

What's that called in Louisiana -- cecessation

or something, when you decide where the money goes?
that lovely phrase they have down there for it?

What's

When you

probate in the state?

MR. REESE:
Q

Succession?

Cecessation?

MR. REESE:

Mo, I thought that was used pretty gen­

erally, too.I'm fairly parochial with the amounts of succes-

20

sion, yes —
So, the answer is that — you know, this is not merely
a matter of this lady inheriting this entire judgement.

Loui­

siana doesn’t provide for that, and I’m assuming there are
differences in states all over the Union which make the inheri­
tance entirely different,

in most states, as I understand it,

from the right of a dependent to collect money damages for loss.
Q

It's just money in the bank, then, is it?

MR. REESE;
Q

Yes.

— under Louisiana law?

And it might have come

from an inheritance —
MR. REESE;
Q

A house —

— from an uncle in England or some place.

MR. REESE:

Right. Yes.

And it has to be distributed

under a different set of rules than your decisions in Moragne
are going to be.

I mean, in the outgrowths of your decisions

in Moragne.
Q

But, may I ask, Mr. Reese?

Did this judgement

which he recovered include an award for impaired earnings for
the rest of his life?
MR. REESE:
Q
or

Well, I don’t know about —

Well, was it more or less that way?

Actuarily,

?
MR. REESE;

I produced evidence that the man did not

recover from his condition.

Counsel defending it vociferously

21
defended —■
Q

Well, I know, but what I'm trying to get at .is,

whether there went to the jury,as an element of his damages,
an item of impaired earnings — that hereafter, instead of
earning $200, he can hope to earn not more than $50 a week for
the rest of his life, and actuarily his life span is ncw going
to be "X" years -MR. REESE:

We produced no actuary at the time.

We

did produce medical evidence of the fact that they didn’t
think he would recover to be able to perform the same occupa­
tion he had performed before.
Q

So then, that, in terms of his impaired earning

ability?
MR. REESE:
Q

Yes, sir.

And so there is, in this damage award, an ele­

ment of a compensation for impaired earning ability, isn’t
there?
MR. REESE:

Very practically speaking, I’ll say

there’s no doubt it.
Q

Well, now, if that’s true, why doesn't that

take care of the — any dependents' claim?
MR. REESE:

Well, let me say that there is a princi­

ple involved — you know, a principle of law involved.

I

don’t know, and I don’t think any of us here know, looking at
the jury's verdict, whether or not that jury took into con-

22
sideration —
Q

Well, it. went to them as considered, didn't it?

MR, REESE:

It went to them five years after the man

died —■
Q

I know, but they were told to consider that ele­

ment, were they not?
MR, REESE:
Q

Right,

All right.

Mow, what claim of dependency would

his wife and children have?
MR, REESE:

It's based on — the child now, in this

particular case, doesn't have any.

There could be a situation,

for instance, in Louisiana —Q

Why

what doesn't happen?

You mean, under

Louisiana it doesn't have any ■— ?
MR, REESE:

Well, no.

I’m saying, under the Moragne

decision, because you all said that it was the loss of those —
Q

Right ~~

MR. REESE:
involved.

— loved ones, and their particular loss

So he's a major, would have no pecuniary loss aris­

ing out of a decrease inincome.

There is a possibility in

Louisiana law that a person could have five children, or four
children, and the widow, who is the big loser, financially,
might end. up only getting one-fourth of this recovery, and the
children would get the other — at least, the fee simple or the

wouldn’t cover, no matter what the jury gave him for his
future loss — they would be giving money to four children who
don't need the money, whereas the wife, who took the pecuniary
loss, would end up with a lot — an awful lot less after paying
a lawyer — you know, it’s a continued fee

there are a lot of factors involved in it —
Q

Well, your theory is that, then, all members of

the family together ca.n recover more than just what a jury
would award for loss of earnings — that they can, in effect,
duplicate that ro- — that award in some way,
MR. REESEi

Well, I agree with the first half of

your statement and disagree with the second half.
already being done.

And that’s

When counsel suggests that if a man dies

before the thing — well, not really, no, X wouldn't be fair
saying that.

But what I am saying is, is that the second

jury would have — or the second fact finder — would have the
opportunity to decide which part of the $175,000, for instance,
to credit against what they're going to give her in a trial
for her own pecuniary loss.
Q

I mean, I’m making —

Well, this case hasn't gone to trial yet, of

course —■
MR. REESE:

Ho, sir, it ttfas dismissed in the District

Court -Q

Yes

MR. REESE:

— reversed in the Circuit, and then

24
faced, this Court in —
Q

Are you suggesting,, now, that there might become

an issue of how much of the $175,000 —
MR. REESE:
G

I ara su- —

— is to be credited against any case that she

establishes of damages as dependent, is that -- ?
MR. REESE:
to avoid it.
Q

I'm suggesting there is absolutely no way

Yes, sir.

Definitely would be

Haw are you going to break down the $175,000?

MR. REESE:

I think it's a complicated problem, which

is what we suggested in the brief in the Fifth Circuit; but,
because it's a complicated problem, or because it creates some
difficulty in the ascertainment of damages, you know, I think
the principle still stands tlx at -— and let me say — I admit
I got a fairly big

verdict in this thing, but the verdict

could have been $35,000.

You know, the jury could have decided

that counsel was right, and possibly he hadn't really been
permanently disabled, and then died ten days later; and you'd
be presented with an entirely different set of facts, with a
thirty-five year old widow, and, you know, eight minor children—■
It could work out that way, too.
You know, sir, what'we"re talking about, I believe,
is the principle out of Moragne.

You know, we talk about it

sifting down, but it's sifted right back up to you all, I'm
afraid.

25

Q

Under your theory, I take it the defendant

can be required, to pay more by way of loss of earnings than
the first jury determined the plaintiff there were entitled
to recover, taking both suits together?
MR. REESE:

Yes, sir.

And I'm saying that had. this

man died before the date of judgement, that same situation
could have existed.

I’m saying that — what I am suggesting,

if the rule is worked out that the second jury who decides
the wife case — wife's case — is given instructions on
crediting the money that she received, that she received, now,
not that the whole family received -- but that she received
as a result of this thing — yes, they could end up paying
more money.
Q

There isn’t any question about it.
Well, how do you get over the analysis in Mellon

and Goodyear?

I realize that was a F.E.L.A. case, but there

there was a settlement ■—
MR. REESE:
Q

Yes.

— and it was held that that barred any claim of

the dependents.
MR. REESE;
Q

Well —

Because the settlement had to be taken to have

included any dependency claims.
MR. REESE;
Q

Wow, how is this different?

Excuse me, I didn’t mean to interrupt —

That's all right.

MR. REESE:

When we — counsel was discussing the

26
matter of the various statutes —• there aren't, just two or three»
You know, there is the Lord Campbell's Act, which, by the way,
is what the F.E.L.A. and the Death on the High Seas deal is.
That's exactly what the language is — comes right out of it,
and those cases are based -- the Mellon and those cases are
based strictly on an interpretation of those words which say
that the claim must be pending at the time of the decedent's
death.

And it's an interpretation of legislative intent --

you can’t get around it.
The pure death claims that have been discussed in
Wilson v. Massengill — there are cases that say exactly what

I'm suggesting this Court adopt from Moragne„
up, you know, with a brand new approach.
here with a minority approach.

I*m not coming

I admit I'm coming

But there are part death, part

survival actions — which is the usual thing, by the way.
chink that there are very few pure survival statutes.

I

Death

on the High Seas happens to be one —
Q

So, you're suggesting that, for purposes of

Moragne, and for the people who would get the benefit of the
Moragne decision, that we not be guided by what the Congress
has said the rule should be with respect to seamen, or with
respect to the people having the benefit of the Death on the
High Seas Act?
MR. REESEs

Yes, I'm suggesting exactly that.

other words, if you are going -—

In

27
Q

ted that we should not adopt what Congress has

thought should be available to seamen's survivors?
MR. REESE;

Right.

And the reason I'm suggesting it

is that Congress has adopted some ancient language in connec­
tion with the P.E.L.A. and —
Q

Well, I must say, though, ordinarily in framing

admiralty rules that we have consulted what Congress has done
in congnate situations, haven't we?
MR. REESE;

No, I do agree with that, and I do agree

that what I am suggesting is a minority position, and I am
agreeing that Congress has in the F.E.L./^. and the Death on
the High Seas Act adopted the Lord Campbell language —
Q

Yes, sir, and there were indications in Moragne,

also, that perhaps the Court should look to those Congressional'
MR. REESE;
Q

— guidance --

MR. REESE;
Q

And other things, yes

Yes, sir —

— in the -— on this very subject —

MR. REESE;

Mo doubt about it.

And what I'm saying

here this afternoo- — well, it's afternoon, yeah —- this
morning is that there's a certain amount of legislation and
arbitrariness, you know, in the matter of admiralty law that
you create, in effect, and I think we could look that squarely
in the eye, and I think that the conflict probably is between
a very harsh rule which you could adopt by using the Congres-

28
sional language, and other language that you all have adopted
in previous cases in discussing admiralty and the, you know,
type of feeling you ought to have toward the wards of tills
Court in the admiralty matters.
Q

Wouldn't it help your case considerably if the

elements of damage under — for those who can have advantage
of Moragne, who are not limited to pecuniary loss ~~
MR» REESE:
Q

Because there 'would be —-

MR. REESE:
Q

Yeah, it would help my case in —•

— because that has not been determined.

If Mellon, in that line of cases, if they hadn't

assumed or held, or been limited to pecuniary loss, it may be
that that precondition of a cause of action wouldn't have
obtained.
MR. REESE:

Aren't you, also, assuming that the cases

you're talking about still come under the F.E.L.A.

You still

have the opportunity, and it has not been decided yet, by this
Court or any Circuits, as far as I know, whether Moragne is
limited to pecuniary loss.
Q

Well, I understand that, I understand that»

MR, REESE:

And, you know, that's another day and

another hour, and possibly it might have an effect on your de­
cision in this case.
I think that's basically all I had to answer in con­
nection with the counsel’s statement.

I don't read the Moragne

29
case to indicate anything but that you can't recover.
all read it differently and I'm reading it wrong

If you
But I don't

know whether there is a pure survival action in Moragne.

It

seems to me it’s a — it reads like a pure death claim — it
reads like the type of thing Wilson v, Massengill says the
South Carolina statutes like —■
Thank you, sir.

So —

Any other questions?

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. McClendon?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. MCCLENDON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MCCLENDON:

Yes.

The Moragne case was decided

to provide a remedy where there was none, and where the harsh­
ness of the Harrisburg had been — in effect, made a mockery of
over the years by various by-pass procedures.

And so, in

Moragne, where there was virtually an instantaneous death, the
widow — and no remedy — the remedy was supplied — that the
case before the Court today is not one in which there is no
remedy.

The remedy was received, and the Fifth Circuit points

out the problem which will be created by apportionment of dam­
ages to go back into the jury award and try to determine which
of these damages were anticipatory of -the death or the loss of
income of Mr. Gaudet, in the footnote on page 4 of the Fifth
Circuit's decision.
Again, we would simply point out that the fact that
the right is derivative, rather than representative, is, in our

30

opinion, the crux of the question before the Court.

If the

original tort gives rise to two courses of action, potentially,
then occurrence of the death is not that which creates the
right of the dependents to bring their action.

It is the ori­

ginal tort, and if this is extinguished by the injured man
during his life, the Courts have said that this — he has re­
ceived his pecuniary loss, and you are opening a Pandora's box
to go and try to carry that —
Q

That makes some -- it might make some sense if,

as long as you assume that the — or as long as you hold that
the damages recoverable by the survivors are limited to pecu­
niary loss.

Mow, where did that rule come from?

survivors are under the

That the

for e- — the Jones Act, and Death

on the High Seas, and F.E.L'.A. — that the damages of survivors
are limited to pecuniary damages?
MR. MCCLEMDON:

It has been in all of the cases,

your Honor —
Q

Well, I know, but is that a construction of the

statute, or just —
MR. MCCLENDON:
Q

It was not in the sta- —

Yes?

MR. MCCLENDON:

It was not in the statute, no.

It

was just — the statute just set down -Q
it?

That was the rule of Lord Campbell's Act, wasn’t

31
MR. MCCLENDON:

Yes, sir.

It came through F.E.L.A.

and it — the statute said —
Q

Yes.

But let's assume, for the moment, that a

widow could recover for consortium — the loss of consortium»
Now, it wouldn't make much sense, would it, to way that the
recovery by the decedent extinguished the window's cause of
action?

It really wouldn't make much sense, would it?
MR. MCCLENDON:

This is the hiatus —• this is the

error —
Q

It makes it — it would make more sense —- it

makes some sense if you're talking about pecuniary loss.
MR. MCCLENDON:

Yes, sir, and the — of course,there

are several points
Q

But if doesn't if it's consortium

MR. MCCLENDON:

These xtfere several of the points in

our brief.
Q

And Moragne said we had —so, I suppose, part

of our problem is, what are the elements of damages available
under Moragne?
MR. MCCLENDON:

Yes, sir? yes, sir.

And whether, to

maintain uniformity, we are to follow what has been done in the
other Acts.
Q

And I gather the widow was not a party to his law­

suit, alleging a loss of consortium, was she?
MR. MCCLENDON:

No, sir.

That's pretty hard to do.

32
Q

So that’s still uncompensated, isn't it?

MR. MCCLENDON:

Yes, sir.

It isn't a question of

compensation, it's a question of extinguishing the action be­
fore the death occurs.

It's an area where — I don’t know if

there's a true counterpart, or a comparable situation -Q

Well, what's the derivation of the claim for

loss consortium?
MR. MCCLENDON:

It's the love, the affectionate re­

lationship of the husband and wife.
Q

It's common law, isn't it?

MR. MCCLENDON:

Yes, sir.

We are a civil law State,

but you are right, sir, this is true.
Q

Well, of course, the area we are dealing with

today
ME. MCCLENDON:
Q

•— we're framing a —

MR. MCCLENDON:
Q

It's the same today

Yes, sir.

— Federal Admiralty rule, aren't we?

MR. MCCLENDON:

Uhhurn.

Thank you, your Honors,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:56 o'clock a.m., the case was
submitted.]
