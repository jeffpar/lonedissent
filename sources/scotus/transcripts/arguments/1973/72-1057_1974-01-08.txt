what Mr . Mitchell informed him he should do.
Unfortunately, l1r. Lindenbaum did not keep a record
of the telephone calls, so that we, in every case in which
Mr . Lindenbaum put Mr . Mitchell ' s signature on the memorandum,
we must asswre that that may be a case in which there was no
telephone authorization .

Although we know that a great many

of them were in fact at1thorized by telephone .
It's at this stage that the first problem of, or
claim of violation of the statute occurs ,

Decause, in

2516, it is provided that the Attorney

G<;neral o;;- any Assistant Attorney General specially designated
by the Attorney G~,nc ·al rn,1y authorize

by the 1' to,·nny Gen i- l, at J1orized, t:1at tbat falls outside

Nobody caught it.

In fact, Mr. Justice

White, when we caught, when the Department caught the
delegation problem, because litigation arose over it, the
delegation from Mr. Mitchell to Mr. Lindenbaum, they corrected
that, but they didn't. look at the other form.

And that

continued until litigation began over that form, the Will

you find out by holding an evidentiary hearing, then you're

blank in the order, and at

this confusion about memoranda Hr. Wilson 's name got sent out,
when it shouldn't have, it seems to me that that 's error,
i t seems to me that it shouldn't happen; but I certainly think
if anything is harmless error, that is.
There is certainly no reason to say that a judge
who has found all the constitutional elenents , probable
cause, need for wire interception, failm:e of ot.i1e,r
techniques and so forth, ·1ould have t•1rned dosm the ;;prlication had he been told that th,; '\ttorncy General rc-ther than
t'1e Assistant Attorney Ge:,ero"J. Jia,1 authori::ed it .
So I can ' t -- it seeITs to me that that ' s utterly,
utterly lw.rmless error.
But, on the Lin bnbaurn-Mitch 11 delcgiltion, which I
think is the next qucs tio·1 that follows from the que.;tion you
just aske<l , Mr , Chief Justice,
nO\l

J

think it ' s clear -- and I ' r1

movj_ng from the argument tllat the.·e ' s no case for a

suppre~::-ion of evidenc<".

1\11e

if there were

i"\

case i t should

Le perspective only .
To the arqur.icnt -~11c1t in fact the statute was
conplied with in rnnjor respects, in the m11jor respect.
The nu:i.--po-,e of section 2516 (1) which is tl e section
tl'.at governs, tl-ia-: says i.t mt1st be the Attorney General··t'1'

1\.t:torn y Gen raJ may authoi:i?-'a! or specially designated

l\. ·~istan-l: Attorney C"e,,eral,. is stated in language in the

Senate Report , which is quoted on page 54 of our brief in

45

the Giordano case, and tl e purpose is to centralize policy,
to qet wiiforru.t.:, o"

P>

icy, end to :1avE:? a p '>licly

I think lloth of those purpo~es were completely

satisfied when the T ..;torney ,,eneral s.:-id:

immunity.

And it's been held that that function of the

Attorney General, given to the Attorney General by the
statute, may be delegated.
You have I ~~ink an even clearer example in the
second paragraph of the footnote on that page, in the case
of Jay v . noy~, construing 8 use 1254, a statute which says
that the Attorney General, quote, "may in his discretion",
close quote, suspend deportation of any alien .
That lanquage seens to ire to i.nply even more than
the language in the statute we' re exi'Iti.ning that i t is a
personal decision of the Attorney General , and yet tl1is Court
has held that that statutory pm,•,:,r m'ly be c'elegated.
l\.."ld

in Kleindienst v . !lnnclel, which is quoted at

th,., bottori of tl at footno· ~, the Attor"ey General was given

discretion which ua~ iP far·t, in that case, exercised by
the Imini«ration anci llatu1.a· izatioP service; he del~gated it.
so that !Ir. llitchell ano Ill:. Lindenbaum were
op0rati'1<J agaim·t a 1,<1ckground of statutes, a general
delegatio·1 statute a:1d specific other statutes giving tl1e
Attorney General the power or the duty to do things . which
have been delegated and 11hich delegations have been upheld
in the past.
QUESTION:

Your argument would be very convincing

if this statute now before us had simply said the Attorney
General, but when it adds "or any Assistant Attorney General

47
specially desigi1ated by ::he attorney General", doesn't i t
detract fron the argument that theLe is an inherent
delegation of authority to delegate to other people?
To other people.
11~. BORK:

think i t does, llr. Justice Stewart,

about the Secretary of Health, Educ..:.tion, and Welfare.
11.nd I should say one more thing.

If you look, if

one looks at 2516 ( 2), we see that Congress clearly allows
hundreds of State prosecutors to authorize these applications;
and, in fact, in the legislative history which we cite in
the brief, i t says the question of whether the State officer
may delegate -- State Attorney General may delegate, will be
con·trolled by the law of delegation of the State.
N011,

that takes the heart out of this argument

tt1at Conqress wi:.s so concerned tJ,'it the Attorney Ge,i<?ral
himself had to involve himself in {he minutiae of eve1.y
application for a wire .i.ntercep~ion order.
QUESTION:

11eJ.l, wouldn't a draft of this type,

Nr. Solicitor Genera:., would h.-.re authorized a United States
Attorney to make the dppl ication?

rm.

IIO'U,:

There was a draft of that sort.

QUESTION: And I gather it was Justice that came in
and said, through llr . Miller, wasn't it, they preferred it
he l ·mit<2d to tl1

A::torney General or an assistant designated

by him?

rm.

BORK: That ' s correct.

That's correct.

And I

think he suggested t•1at, and I think when one looks at that
<1qain,t the law of delegation and t.'J.<? law of no delegation,
which Conq::<'·s had uorkc<l out , I t,1ink it 's quite clear that
they're talking about the Attorney General and his immediate

49

office and any 1\ssista1t i\ttor.ney General and his irrcmediate
office; and I thiak these St.ate case£

ndic"te the same

QUESTION: 1lcll , richt noi: Congress !'>ave felt,

though, that in the case of the Stat~s that was pretty nuch
a natter for the St,ites to decide for t.hPmse lves ; but in the

MR. BORK:

No, no, when I said de legation, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist, 11hat I neant was:

this statute says to the

Attorney General, UJ'lless you designate an Assistant Attorney
General you are the man to be held responsible, and we want
uniformity of policy.
i\Jld that is accompli•;hed wien he takes a man, his
E:,ecutive Assistant, who has done 50 or 60 of these applications,

Mr , Smouse.

ORAL 1\RGUMCIJT OF II. RUSSELL SI-IOUSE , ESQ. ,
ON IlElll\LF OF RESPONDENT GIORDANO
MR, Sl!OUSE :

r1r . Chief Justice , and may i t please

the Court:
In the Giordano case the Court is confronted with
compounded violations of Title III, specifically sections
2516(1) 'llld 2518(1) (a) and (4) (d).

As for the section 2516 point, e1e fact is that on
O"';ober l6, 1970, Pr,incis s , nrocato, an Assistant United
ScateG 1\tl:orney for the District of llaryland, submitted to
Cl-iief Judqe llorthro.) of the Unit-:?d States District Court for
l!arvland an "l'Plic1"tion f:or an orter authorizing interception
of wire corimunication on t;- e telephone of my client, Dominic

Nic11olas Giordano.
1\tt~ched to the a'"lplication as exhibits were a,
quote, "Hill

Hilson letter", unquote, to fir, Brocato , and

the affic.Javits of two agents of the Ilurcau of llarcotics and
Dangerous Drugs .
The llill Wilson letter evidences the fact that
Mr, Brocato had requested authorization to apply for the

55

wiretap order, this request having ueen nade to then J\ttorney
General John ll. Mitchell.

1\lthough the request had been

directed to the J\ttorney General, the record submitted in
this case shows that i t never was reviewed by the /\ttorney
General hinself, but that his initials had been placed on
the authorization nemorandurn by llr. Sol Lindenbaum, his
Executive /\ssistant.
Thj.s ;iuthoi:-i zation rnc.~oranc-t

56
I believe the Solicitor General indicated perhaps some seven
days after the original application the Attorney C-eneral had
become familiar with the operative facts .
The affidavit of Mr. Lindenbaum indicates that some
21 days later the Attorney General authorized the application

for an extension.
Included within that application for extension was
another Nill Wilson letter, and an additional affidavit from
Agent l\hrahal':l 1\zzam of the Dureau of ?larc,otj cs and Dangerous
Drugs ,
On revie1•1 of the 1\zzam affidavit, it is to be noted
t!1ut the operative facts setting forth prob, '>le cause are
rtigativc dF'taj lr, and inteJ.ligencc which developed
pursuo

to th€' original wiretap.

5n its

;_ef incli at€'

i:;,,t

The C<overnment, I believe ,

che Azzan application reasserts

:b. fac ·c; that wPre set forth in the original application.

IPcleed, '_hey do not .

It r.l'"!rely states "I reassert" without

specifying what those facts wer,:i, the facts set forth in the
original appli~ation.

Indeed, i t is an incorporation-by-

re ference type approach .
I \lould

i"Sk

this honorable Court to look critically

at the ,.,articular facts in the case at hand, as, indeed, I
C'

~nec·t '·he:y are at perhaps some variance from the facts

uhich the govern: rnt intlicates in its brief, developed at
some subsequent point in time 1-,i th regard to checking with

57

the Attorney General and apprizing him of the facts after
the fact.
l1s for the section 2518 point, i t must be noted
that not only did Hr . Hilson not siqn the letter, he indeed
never sn1 any of the papers in this case, nor, indeed , did
the 1\tt,-, ney General, rn:ior to the application for the
ext:e1u;ioil order.

to permit the wiretap.

Unquote.

The sequence of events here involved , I submit ,
constitutes the, quote, "elaborate paper charade", unquote,
which the United States Court

of Appeals for the Ninth

Circuit condemned in the King case.
It is s;;.gnificant that where the violations here
in question have been sho\o:n to exist in cocllination, the
vast majority of federal cour·ts have found the violation of

2516 and have decreed suppression as the remedy.
In addition to the Gj.01:dano case in the Fourth
Circuit, there is tie opinion, of course, of the _!lobinson
court in the Fifth Circuit, the per curiam opinion in the
.!l_~~- case in tl1e Seventh Circuit, the opinion of t.rie llinth

Circuit in i:he King case, and the opinion of the Court of
Ap-:>e,ls for the Di5trict of Columbia in the tlantello case.

Do you find a 1y Courts of Appeals the

other way?

by this additional cogent statement by Chief Judge Bazelon,
in the case of In re Evans, wherein he said:

"Pirst, 2515

describes in the nost sweeping possible terms a prohibition
against the use of evidence tainted by an unlawful wiretap.
But the section gives no indication of a specific remedy.

. ..

Viewed as a whole, hm-1ever, the Omnibus Crime Control Act
does provide such a remedy -- the motion to suppress
authorized by 2518 (10) (a)."
The "no need to deter" argument rejected in

1, C't v z invol vc both typ"s of

Sol Li,denbaurn approved tap, and the John

76

Mitchell approved tap -- since this Court granted the
government petition for certiorari limited the issue of the
tap purportedly approved by the Attorney ~,eneral , and the
Chavez decision was based -- the decision as to that tap -solely upon the application of 2518, I ' ll try and limit my
remarks to that aspect of this total problem.

But there

nay be some ovarlapping, of necessity.
I uould subl"i t to the Court tr at this issue is
important for two reasons.
First, i t i!"volves a very important question of
congres,:;ional intent in the enac'cment of this lcgislntion
that affects a very sensitive :irea in this ir.odern electronic

age.
And secondly, the important issue. is whether or not
there har, been compliance by the Justice Department with this
mandate of Con~ress, whicll surrounds virtually this authorizatio1 to "lnga(Je in these duthori:zcd uir..:-taps .
It's obvious , I think, from t.lle lcgi;;lative history
ancl certainly fror.1 the decision of the l1 inth Circuit, that the
ir>stil·t•H onal decision uas of some concern to Congress.
•,r . Justice l!arshall asked the question of how often
do t.t.es~ i,1s ·t;itution<' l

dl'cisions happen I and I think it• s

fair to say that they happen often enough, over the history
of our Justice Dep.:1rtment, .:hat Congress was concerned about
it, and wanted to make sure that these wiretap applications

77
would not be the subject of institutional decisions, they
would not be rul>berstamped, and they would not be handled
by subordinate meml>ers of the Justice nepartment, no matter
how knowledgeable nor how responsible they miqht be in the
performance of their duties.
It is for that reason that the legislative history
is clear that Congress wanted a responsible high-rankinq
Department official to make these decisions.

And recognizing

that the l\ttorney General could not conceivably review and
l:lake these il"'port nt ,1ccisions in every case, he was
cmpo,cred to ck'liJ,1 c.' 'l.n Ms'.1i"tant l\ttorncy Gener~J, a

So that

If fir. flitchell signed this letter saying, "I

made these determinations", then I think the District Judge
must rely upon those determinations.
But here the District Judge, rightfully and
justif::.ably believed that these decisions were made by Will
Hilson, the Assistant Attorney General, who says he reviewed
the file and made these important decisions .
And this is simply -- I urge Your Honors, it isn't

thr. reo~ent is th&t the prosecutors and the courts that have

the rcspon,3iui li ty under the star.ute 11ill not become careleaa,
but 1-1ill remain finn in ·tl<eil· determination to see that the

87

statute is strictly follo11ed ,

If the statute is strictly

folloued, i t is certainly not to be expected that any
unnccessar.y invasion of p~ivacy will result .
I think this is the un<lcrcuri:cnt that underlies
this legislation, is that there are these strict requirements.
Those im:

i:tant decision<.: by prosecuting officers are an

integral

art of the schene to ~0.t in motion a ra~1er unique,

modern

,., of invasi.on of a citizen's privacy .

The decision in Chavez parallels the District Court

District Judge in Giordano took the position that the orders
itself we:i:e invalid and therefore the tap was vitiated.
This reasoning was adopted in Chavez, which was

reasoning as is before the Court in Giordano, in these pair
of cases.

MR. HEWITT:
QUESTION:

In (i) and (ii).
Yes .

MR. HEWITT:

I would disagree with my co-counsel,

or associate , Mr. Smouse, to one extent.

I think perhaps if

the Court were to rind that the statu·'::e was not broad enough
to cover this, certainly there 1-muld be an inherent power
on the part of this Court to remedy this by fashioning a
supervisory rule.

I think even though th_ re's no

constitutionnl point involved, I would see no prohibition on
this Cou:cc in excluding this evidence on the basis that there
must he

omc sanction "or failure to comply with the strict

s tatutorv requirements.
QUESTIOH:
2518 (10) (;1) (i),

m,11, assutr.ing, hypothetically, that

(ii) and (iii) did not by irnplicatio11 cover

this, c.~rtainly section 2515 is explicit, is it not?
IIR. HEWITT:

Yes.

It is, Your lion or.

And I wo\lld point out that the legislative history
inr'.i.c ces that i t was the intent that 2510(10) pretty much set
forth those grounc"s upon which treditional search-and-seizure
ccnc~ )t, ;,ave lc-:d to the st•ppression of evidence.

And here,

in a situation like thiB, a search warrant affidavit, that had

91
these sane defects, the misidentification of the affiant,
certainly if the Court has the inherent power to suppress
that, the same rationale should apply to the orders in the
applications in this particular case.

QUESTION: Do you think a case is stronger or weaker
on respect to a judge-made exclusionary rule in a situation
like this , where Congress has laid down statutory qualifications and then itself provided the circumstances under which
there should be suppression; or in a case like McN~ where
simply Congress has enacted a statutory prohibition and has
said nothing about suppression?

Are the judges freer in one

case than the other?
