MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73-263, Commissioner of Internal Revenue against
Idaho Fewer Company.
Mr. Jones, I think you can proceed whene\?er you are
ready now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case raises the question of business income
taxation, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
The respondent taxpayer, the Idaho Power Company,
is a public utility engaged in the production, transmission
and distribution of electric energy.
In connection with this business, respondent performs
a substantial portion of its own construction work.
In the years 1962 and 1963, taxable years in question
in this case, the respondent itself expended approximately
$13 million in new capital facilities.
Q

Primarily --

'.You go back a long way, Mr, Jones.

I suppose the

same issue is present in succeeding taxable years of the tax­
payer?
MR. JONES:
Biackmun.

That's my understanding, Mr. Justice

4
In performing this construction work, the respondent
uses essentially two different types of construction equipment.
He uses automotive transportation equipment, such as passenger
cars, pickup trucks, heavier trucks and trailers, and also
what is called power operated equipment, which means primarily
cranes, tractors, bulldosers, road graders, and so forth.
The depreciation of this construction equipment will,
in this case, be referred to as construetion-related depreciation.
Now, by construction-related depreciation, we do not
mean all depreciation on construction equipment.

What we

refer to, in this case, is the depreciation on construction
equipment used by taxpayer in the construction of his own
capital facilities.
In performing construction work, the respondent incurs
a wide variety of cons truefcion costs.

It pays wages to con­

struction workers, it buys tools and materials which are used
up in the course of construction, and it also incurs wear and
tear or exhaustion of the construction equipment; itself, that
is, the construction-related depreciation.
On its general books of account, the respondent
capitalises all of these construction costs, and does this in
compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, which
recognise that these construction costs, including construction™
related depreciation, constitute capital outlays and not
operating expenses.

5
This fact is also recognised by the Federal Power
Commission and the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, both of
w hich require the respondent to capitalise its constructionrelated depreciation for regulatory purposes.
However, on its tax returns, the respondent treats
these matters somewhat differently.
its construction costs.

It capitalizes most of

For example, it capitalizes the wages

paid to the operators of the construction equipment, and does
not deduct those wages as an ordinary and necessary cost of
doing business.
It also capitalizes the cost of fuel used by the
construction equipment.

And it capitalises the cost of

repairs to that equipment, but it does not capitalise the
depreciation, itself.

It seeks, in this case, to take that

depreciation as an immediate deduction against current
income.
The Commissioner disallowed this depreciation
deduction for the years in question, and the Tax Court sus­
tained that disallowance on the ground that Section 263 of
the Code requires the capitalisation of all capital costs,
including the construction-related depreciation.
However, the Court of Appeals of the 9th Circuit
reversed.
I think it is fair to say that the opinion of the
Court of Appeals came as a surprise to many tax practicloners.

6
The Internal Revenue Service has, for many years,
taken the position, in formal rulings, that constructionrelated depreciation must be capitalised and is non-deductible,
and this position of the Commissioner has been upheld in a long
series of decisions, in the Board of Tax Appeals, Tax Court and
the Court of Claims.
Because of this long history, almost all taxpayers
who are engaged in the self-construction of their capital
facilities, have complied with the Serviced rulings and have
capitalised their construction-related depreciation.
This long acceptance of the Commissioner's position
makes the immediate revenue impact of this case quite sub­
stantial.
Dfost railroads and utility companies, and many large
industrial corporations, as well, perform their own construction
work.

As I said, these taxpayers have, in the past, capitalized

this depreciation item.

But, if the decision below were left

standing, it was anticipated that most of these taxpayers
would file claims for refund on the basis of that decision.
The Internal Revenue Service estimated that these
refund claims would amount to over $100 million for each of
the taxable years currently open, and it was in large part to
forestall the litigation which would arise from the filing of
those refund claims, that the government petitioned for
certiorari in this case.

7
I tum, now, fco a discussion of the merits.
It should be first pointed out that the deduction
which the respondent seeks in this case would result in a
distortion in the reporting of its net income.
Construction-related depreciation is not an operating
expense.

It. is a capital cost associated with the production

of income only in the future, not with the production of
income in the present.
Because of that, the deduction of this depreciation
would tend to understate current net income, and it would
postpone or defer the recognition of income which the respondent
has already earned.
In other words, what the respondent is claiming in
this case is the right to take an immediate deduction, which is
not sanctioned by normal accounting rules, which would have the
effect of postponing the recognition of income until future
years.
This Court has never permitted such deductions of
amounts which were not .sanctioned by normal accounting rules
which would have the effect of so postponing the recognition
of income, except where such a deduction is clearly allowed by
the explicit language of the statute, and is our position here,
as I will now go on to discuss.
The statute does not permit the deduction of that
item in this case.

That is correct, Mr. Justice Whits.

Mr. Justice Douglas, I am not familiar
They may, but I can’t answer that

However, the Federal Power Commission, which

regulates this company, does have a rule which requires
capitalization.

And the Idaho Public Utilities Commission,

also a regulatory agency to which this respondent is subject,
also requires capitalisation.

9
Q

It is not unusual, I suppose, for a taxpayer to

treat an Item one way for its internal accounting purposes
and another way for taxes.
MR, JONES:

There is nothing unusual about that,

Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

Held unconstitutional?
MR. JONES:

We are not relying upon any constitutiona

claim in this case.
Q

All the depreciation taken by the company on its

books is not allowed for tax purposes.

For example, where

property is put on books upon the basis of an appraised value,
the accountants will depreciate that writeup annually and,
of course, you can’t take any deduction for it for tax purposes
MR. JONES:

Certainly, where the Section 167 which

governs depreciation, generally, would not permit a deduction.
The taxpayer could not take such a deduction merely because
he took it on his general books of account.
Q

That's the only point I am making, that the fact the

taxpayer took it is not necessarily controlling In this case.
MR. JONES:
in this case.

But he only took it on his tax returns

The taxpayer here did not take the deduction

on its general books of account.
Q

Right.
I turn now to an analysis of the statute, which

must begin with Section 263.

10
That section provides, and X shall quote:

*'No

deduction shall be allowed for any amount paid out for new
buildings or for permanent improvements or betterments made to
increase the value of any property or estate.*’
It is our position that this is not a technical
provision to be read narrowly.

To the contrary, this Court has

historically read it broadly as the legislative expression of
the accounting principle of capitalization.
This Court has recognized that in the course of
holding such diverse items as brokerage commissions, stock
appraisal litigation costs, and supplementary savings and loan
insurance premiums to be capital, that Section 263 stands for
the broad requirement that capital items must be capitalized.
And, there are, of course, statutory exceptions to
this broad requirement.

such

exceptions.

Section 263, itself, contains several

Also Section 266 provides an exception for

taxes and carrying costs, but there is no similar exception for
depreciation.

There is nothing in the Code which would except

depreciation from the requirements of Section 263.

There is,

to be sure, provision for the deduction of depreciation.

That

is allowed in Section 167.
And, as we pointed out in our brief, Section 161 of
the Code expressly makes all business deductions, including the
deduction for depreciation under Section 167, subordinate to the
capitalisation requirement of Section 263.

11
In other words» if this construction-related
depreciation falls within the general terms of Section 263, then
it must be capitalised, notwithstanding the fact that it might
otherwise be deducted under Section 167.
We believe that to view the matter in this light
is practically to answer the question presented, because it
is undisputed in this case that construction-related depreciation
is a capital item.

It is undisputed in this case that con­

struction-related depreciation is a cost of construction.
And, the regulations under Section 263 have historically
required the capitalization of all costs of construction.
Moreover, as we have pointed out in our reply brief,
regulations under Section 48 expressly state the requirement
that construction-related depreciation must be capitalised,
that it is not subject to immediate deduction.
Respondent, therefore, is essentially in the
position of contending that the Secretary's regulations mis­
construe the statute.
But, in making this contention, the respondent
has fallen far short, we believe, of carrying the burden of
showing that the Secretary's regulations are unreasonable.
The only statutory argument which the respondent
makes in this case is that depreciation is not Man amount
paid out'* within the meaning of Section 263.
In the first place, we believe that this argument

12
overlooks the fact that this Court in Lincoln Savings and Loan
that capital items must he capitalized whether or not they might
fall within a strict reading of the literal language of
Section 263,
But, we need not reach so far in this case because
we believe it is clear that construction-related depreciation
is an amount paid out within the meaning of the statute.
The Secretary has construed that statutory phrase, "amount
paid out," to mean being synonymous with cost incurred,

And,

that is really the only construction of. the statute that makes

any sense.

That's the only construction of the statute which

harmonizes the fundamental assumptions of the income tax
system.
Congress couldn't have required the capitalization
only of actual payments, could not have intended that only
actual payments be subject to capitalisation.
Historically, items such as the issuance of stock,
the assumption of liabilities, the using up of construction
materials, the exchange of property for other property, has
given rise to capitalisation, has not been immediately
deductible, even though there is no actual payment that5s
taking place at the time that the capital asset is acquired.
What is important under the statutory scheme is simply
that when a capital asset is acquired there be some costincurred liability assumed, or other responsibility undertaken

13
which properly is a capital item.
In this case, the respondent, by using up its
construction equipment, by physically exhausting that
equipment, has incurred a very real cost in the course o£
acquiring a capital asset, and that cost which is incurred
gives rise to the capitalisation requirement here*
But, even if the statute were read literally as
requiring an actual payment, it nevertheless does not require
that payment to be made during the taxable year in question.
Thus, when the respondent pays, or incurs, wage
expenses, in the course of constructing capital facilities,
and those wages aren't paid out until the following year,
nevertheless, there is a capital item in the first year.
There is no actual payment.

Payment is made in the following

year, but it is the accrual of the wages in the first year
which gives rise to a capital item.
Perhaps more to the point, in this case, if the
respondent purchases construction materials in one year and
then uses up those construction materials in the two following
years, when those construction materials are used up, that is
a capital item which has to be capitalized, as part of the
basis of the capital facilities which are being constructed.
And, depreciation, really, is exactly the same as
the consumption of these construction materials.
The payment is made in the first year when the

14

construction equipment is acquired, but as the construction
equipment is used up, depreciated, there gives rise to a
capital item in exactly the same way as the using up of
construction materials in subsequent years does.
In each case, you have a payment in an earlier year
but a using up of the asset which you have already paid for
in the course of constructing your new capital facilities.
And all of this physical exhaustion, or usage of
materials, is part of the cost of construction, represents an
amount paid out within the terns of the statute, and is a
capital item.
We feel that this conclusion is supported by other
provisions of the Code.
In our reply brief, m cited Sections 174, 182, 615,
616, and 617.

All of these provisions permit a taxpayer to

deduct items which would otherwise have to be capitalised.
And, each of these provisions does permit the
deduction of construction-related depreciation in very limted
circumstances.
We think if is clear that Congress, by providing for
the deduction of this kind of depreciation in those limited
circumstances, expressed

in the first place, expressed its

awareness that such depreciation would, otherwise, be a capital
item, not subject to deduction.
Secondly, it indicated its intention that in all other

15
eircumsCaneos not covered by those provisions this depreciation
would still be subject to capitalisation, and not be a
deductible item.
Finally, I would like to emphasise that all we are
trying to do in this case is to achieve a tax parity between
this taxpayer and all other taxpayers who acquire capital
facilities.
And, Xthink that can be seen through the following
examplesi
Q

That is, who don't do their own construction work,

you mean?
MR* JOKES:

I'll give you several examples,

Mr. Justice Stewart, some taxpayers who do and some who do
not.
For example, if the respondent; in this case, had
rented this construction equipment instead of purchasing it
and had used rented equipment in constructing its own
facilities, those rental payments would all be capital.
of them could be deducted immediately.

None

They'd all be part of

the new capital basis of the new facility.
Similarly, if this respondent formed a subsidiary
corporation, to construct the assets, the new facilities,
although that subsidiary corporation would be entitled to
a depreciation deduction, under Section 482 of the Code -Q

If the subsidiary corporation were in the construction

16
business, it would be entitled to a full depreciation deduction
from its ordinary income in Che year depreciated without
question, wouldn't it?
MR.. JONES:

That’s correct.

But, under Section 482 of the Code, the parent
corporation would be required to pay the subsidiary enough to
offset that depreciation, so that the deduction would not give
the subsidiary any advantage.

It would simply be a watch.

And the payment made by the parent to cover that depreciation
would be a capital item and not be deductible to the parent
because it would be part of the cost the parent expended in
buying the new capital facilities from the subsidiary.
And, then, of course, where an outside independent
contractor is hired to do the work, all payments to that
contractor,including amounts necessary to cover depreciation on
the contractor’s equipment,would be capital.

They would not

be deductible.
Q

Although the contractor,himself, the man In the

contracting business, could obviously depreciate -~
MR. JONES:

And that points out the underlying

thesis of our position.

Where depreciation is incurred for

the production of immediate Income, then it is an expense of
operations, which is properly deductible.

When it is incurred,

however, not through the -- not in the course of an ongoing
business to produce immediate income, but to acquire a new

17
capital asset which is only going to be used for the production
of income in the future.
Q

Yes.
MR, JONES:

Then it is a capital item.

For these reasons, we ask. the Court to reverse the
judgment of the Court of Appeals.
I would like to reserve my remaining time,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Jones.

Mr. Kem.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK NORTON KERN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TEE RESPONDENT

MR.

KERN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
In this case, Idaho Power Company uses its own
equipment, such as trucks, cranes, etcetera, in part for
operations and in part for maintenance, and in part construction
of its own capital facilities.
That equipment has a life of approximately 10 years.
It is the position of the taxpayer that it should be entitled
to deduct depreciation on that equipment over its life of 10
years, while it is the position of the Government that such
depreciation should be capitalized and added to the cost of the
facilities produced which had a life of more than 30 years.

J So that, the Government’s position is that the
depreciation on the equipment used in construction should not be

18
deducted over its lG~year life but instead in aggregate over
a period of 40 years, which would mean that the taxpayer
couldn’t recover depreciation, couldn’t recover the cost of
this property by depreciation for a period of more than 30
years after the property was no longer in existence.
Now, there are several --we believe that the
answer to this question turns not upon a question of
accounting, but it turns on a question of interpretation of
the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, Section 167, on
the one hand, which allows a deduction for depreciation of
property used in the trade or business, and Section 263, on the
other hand, which requires capitalisation of the amount paid
out for new buildings or for permanent improvements or for
betterments to increase the value of any property or estate.
Wow, turning first, however, since much has been made
to the question of accounting in the briefs.

I’d like to speak

just momentarily to that.
This is not a question of the taxpayer’s accounting
per books under Section 446 of the Internal Revenue Code.

That

Section basically provides that taxable income shall be
computed in accordance with the way the taxpayer keeps its
books.

But, under the regulations applicable to that section,
•

*

Section 1.446~~iA(l), it is stated that certain special items
for which the Internal Revenue Code provides its own rules are
not to be computed in accordance with the way the taxpayer keeps

19

its books.

And, included among those, are such things as

research and experimental expenditures and depreciation,
etcetera.
So this isn’t a question of the way that we keep our
books, the taxpayer keeps its books.
And, parenthetically there, I’d like fco state that
there are many things besides depreciation that are considered
to be expenses -- that could be considered to be costs of
property constructed, that the taxpayer does not capitalise.
These weren’t mentioned.

I don’t know why, because

they keep appearing in the briefs.

In the briefs, it was

mentioned taxes, pensions, those things.

We didn’t think it

was important but all taxpayers in a profitable position
deduct interest during construction.
And the Internal Revenue Code has always permitted
taxpayers the permission of these deductions and interest
and taxes could be deducted regardless of the existence of
Section 263 of the Internal Revenue Code, since 1913, since, the
Code came in, and since the predecessors to the Code came into
existence, and they were not made deductible by Section 266,
as the Government would suggest.

They were deductible because

«•» before Section 266 carae in, which permits capitalisation of
interest and taxes, if the taxpayer elects to capitalise.
So, there are a whole series of things that can be
deducted under the Internal Revenue Code, under the provisions

20
of the Code, that, possibly, from a question of good accounting,
should foe capitalized.
Turning specifically to the question of financial
accounting, it is suggested by the Government that depreciation
should be capitalized because it is good accounting to
capitalize it, and certain tei-sts are cited to that effect.
However, it is respectfully suggested that the
Government would not he willing to accept all of the various
types of rules that are applicable under financial accounting,
on the one hand, and that tax accounting does not accord with
financial accounting on the other.
For example, the Government referred, in its reply
brief, to Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, which was issued
in 1961 by the American Institute of Public Accounts.
Now, in 1961, in that particular bulletin it is
pointed out that as costs increase — as the costs of replacing
equipment increase, as equipment is improved, as inflation
occurs, historical costs of depreciation do noprovide.; a
fund for replacement of equipment.
And it is stated in that particular bulletin that
it is proper for management to make an annual appropriation of
net income in contemplation of replacement of such facilities
at higher price levels*
This is what financial accounting does, in addition
to the deduction for depreciation,, in order to reflect properly

21
the higher costs -- the higher expenses on Its books.
How3 of course, the Government would not accept that.
From the Government's point of view, that would be the creation
of a contingent reserve, which has not been deductible,
certainly, since the decision of this Court in Brown v. Heirlag
in 1934.
So, I don't think that the Government is really
interested in having all of the concepts of financial
accounting applied for tax purposes.
Moving ahead, however, under the tax law, there
are specific accounting rules which are really proper rules
indicated by Congress in adopting the provisions applicable to
depreciation.
Congress, recognising, as long ago as 1954 that
there were increased costs of replacement of equipment, that
the method of depreciation, at that time, did not permit
recoupment of the costs of assets in the expansion of American
business, provided for methods of accumulating funds more
rapidly by depreciation so those funds could be used in the
business to earn other funds and replace equipment, or could
be used for expansion.
For example, in 1954, various methods of accelerated
depreciation were permitted, including declining balance,
depreciation at twice the straight line rate.
That would allots the deduction of approximately 40%

22

of the cost of equipment in the first one-quarter of its life
or about two-thirds of the cost of equipment in the first
50% of its life.
And then, added to that, coming ahead, up to the
present time, Congress, In 1971, adopted the Asset Depreciation
Range System.

And that particular system permits taxpayers to

adopt a class life which is in the first 30th percentile of
lives previously used by taxpayers in the past, that is, the
bottom 30, the quickest 30, and then to reduce that life by
20%, and then to apply accelerated methods of depreciation.
So, in the case of a 5-year property, such as lathe,
for example, a taxpayer can deduct 50% of the cost of that lathe
in the first taxable year.
Now, these are the kind of rules that apply to tax
depreciation, and they are much more consistent with the
deduction of depreciatiosi on the taxpayer's equipment over its
own useful life, as suggested by the taxpayer, then requiring the
taxpayer to deduct depreciation on that equipment not over its
own useful life, but not until a period of 30 years after the
equipment is no longer in existence.
The taxpayer has as much need for funds to replace
that equipment — those automobiles — those cranes -- that
it uses for construction at the end of their useful lives as
it has for — as any taxpayer has

for need

has need to

replace any other equipment, and the reasons for such replacement

23
are the same.
Q

Mr. Kerri, are the automobiles that you refer to,

are they used by the company 100% of the time in construction
or are they used part of the time for construction, part of
the time for other purposes?
MR. KERN:

In part for operations, in part for

maintenance, and in part for construction,
Q

Bo you understand what the Government’s position is

as to how that should be allocated, or whether it should be
allocated?
MR. KERN:

Yes, we keep — the company keeps records

on its books as to the usage, and those records are available
and an allocated portion of depreciation is allocated to
construction.
Now, it is the position of the taxpayer that this
question is properly a question of statutory interpretation
of Sections 167 and 263, as Congress manifested its intention
in adopting those sections.
Now, to bring this out, we have to go all the way
back to the beginning since these sections have been in the
Internal Revenue Code.

We go all the way back to the Civil

War Act of 1864, and the legislative predecessor of Section
263 first appeared in that Civil War Income Tax Act which
provided that no deduction shall be made for any amount paid
out for new buildings, permanent Improvements or betterments made

24

to increase the value of any property or estate.
Almost exactly the same words that are used today in
Section 263.
Now, quite clearly, at that time, these words were
not intended to disallow a deduction for depreciation, because
there was no concept of depreciation at that time, depreciation
was not a deduction under the Act of 1864, arid depreciation
accounting, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Brandeis, in United
Railways and Electric Company of Baltimore v. West,did not
come into use in the United States until after 1900.
Now, I don’t mean to say that the Civil War Congress’
intention is carried over right up to the present time.
What I do mean to suggest is that then, in 1913, without
going through all the acts at that particular time, in 1913,
the Revenue Act in 1913, which is probably the direct predecessor
of the present Income Tax Law, Congress chose to adopt exactly
this same language to require capitalisation.

That is, no

deduction shall be made for any amount paid out for new
buildings, permanent improvements or betterments, made to
increase the value of any property or estate.
Now this is, we believe, important, because in the
same Act, Congress indicated its concept of depreciation.
It stated in that Act that a deduction shall be allowed for
losses actually sustained including a reasonable allowance for
depreciation.

25
So that3 in this Revenue Act of 1913, on the one
hand, Congress indicated that it thought depreciation was a
loss in value or a decrease in value, much as it’s been
described by this Court in numerous decisions, such as the
Ludy decision, 1927, and Massey Motors, I960, and other
decisions, that Congress thought it was a reduction or loss
or decrease in value, on the one hand ~~ depreciation was

and

on the other hand, it required capitalisation only of any
amount paid out for new buildings or permanent improvements
or betterments made to increase the value of any property or
estate*
Now, this situation, this exact language, continued
up until 1918, when the loss deduction and the depreciation
reduction were separated, and then ahead, up to the present
time, essentially the same situation has continued, but we
believe that there is further indication that up to the
present time Congress has continued to intend that depreciation
shall not be considered an amount paid out and shall not be
capitalised.

But instead, is regarded as a reduction or loss

in value.
And the reason we believe that is that -- we cite the
opposite side, X guess, of the same sections that Mr. Jones
pointed out, although we cited them first in our briefs.
Wherever Congress has intended that depreciation
shall be treated as the equivalent of an expenditure, a word

26

that is also used in Section 263 at the present time, the
equivalent of an expenditure or of an amount paid, it has
found it necessary to provide a definition in the section of
the Code to that effect, while, on the other hand, where it
has not intended that depreciation shall be considered an
expenditure or an amount paid, there is no definition throughout
the Internal Revenue Code to that effect,,
Now, Congress has not found it necessary to define
expenditures or amount paid in any other respect except in its
consideration of depreciation, and in Sections 174, having
to do with research and experimental expenditures, in Section
182t having to do with farm clearing expenditures, 615 and

617, having to do with exploration for minerals, and 616,
mine development expenditures, in each of those cases where
Congress has intended that depreciation shall be treated as
an expenditure, it has used words to the effect that allowances
for depreciation shall be considered for purposes of this
section as expenditures paid or incurred.
And, on the other hand, this hasnffc been done for
any other type of deduction.
On the other hand, where Congress does not intend
that depreciation shall be considered an amount paid, or
the equivalent of expenditure, it does not so provide,
For example, in Sections 170 and 213, which have to
do with charitable contributions and medical expenses, there is

27
a deduction allowed for an amount paid or a payment.
And,in neither of these sections,is the word paid
or payment defined to include depreciation.
And,in neither of these sections, is it treated fay
the courts as if including depreciation.
The cases come up in the use of automobiles, and
where an automobile is used for medical or a charitable
purpose, deduction is allowed for the gas, the oil, the
maintenance, insurance, and all similar expenditures, but no
deduction is allowed for depreciation on the automobile
because it is not considered a payment, or an amount paid.
Wow, of course, Section 263 does not have any
definition to the effect that amount paid or expenditure shall
include the term depreciation.

And, we respectfully, suggest

that, in the light of the legislative history of Section 263,
in the light of the way it has been used since it first came
into the Internal Revenue Code, that Congress did not intend
that the terns "amount paid” shall include depreciation, as
within the scope of Section 263 and, therefore, depreciation
need not be capitalised.
Wow, I'd like to turn to one other facet.

The

Government has in its briefs and Mr. Jones pointed out to
the effect that there was

well, that there is a long and

consistent administrative history requiring capitalisation
of depreciation.

28
I, respectfully, suggest that's not true.
Section 263, the

section that requires capitalization,

came into Code in 1913 and also did the allowance for deprecia­
tion.
Going back to administrative history, administrative
history itself, if you regard that as regulations or rulings,
or that sort of thing, the Government didn’t say a thing about
capitalising depreciation until 1955.
But, looking at administration, as perhaps encompassing
what the Government litigated, back in the 1920’s there are
four railroad cases and which concerned

in a sense, they

have been cited as concerning the requirement for capitalization
of depreciation, and what, in fact, they concerned was the
movement of men and materials in work trains to a location in
which the railroads were constructing new facilities.
And, apparently, buried in the cost r- the cost of
this movement was accounted for on the books by saying it was
one cent per man-mile for man, and six-tenths of a cent per
ton-mile for material

buried in that cost was an element

of depreciation.
How, the Government, at that time, stated that the
railroads had to capitalise the costs of moving men and
materials to these locations.
Q

Tax cases or XCC cases?
MR. KERN:

These are tax cases.

29
But, it was the ICC accounting that got the
depreciation buried
Q

within the *■-

Right.
MR. KERN:

Government said that these costs had to

be capitalised and the court four times — the courts four
times

each time, it started off with the Board of Tax

Appeals "" held that they must be capitalised, but only in one
of those cases was the term "depreciation5* ever mentioned, and
then it was just more or less mart ioned in passing.

There was

no discussion, no analysis of the Code, no consideration of
Sections 263 and 167.
Now, coming ahead up, after those four cases, the
Government then came upon a case with a railroad which had —
had used equipment to construct its own facilities and in
the Great Northern case, decided in 1934

by the Board of

Tax Appeals, and the Government took the position that that
depreciation should be capitalised.

This was the first case

directly concerning the matter.
Now, the case was actually argued -- the Government
never took the position that Section 263 requires It be
capitalised

— or its predecessor, as they do today.

It was, actually, argued on the question of whether
or not construction was part of the railroad's trade or business
and the Board held that it was, and the depreciation was
permitted to be deducted.

30
Well, then, you go ahead up to 1955, and ids forty
years since 1913, and at that point, came out a revenue ruling
that said, to the effect, that taxpayers had to capitalise the
cost of planting trees if they were engaged in forestry, and
that included depreciation on the planting equipment, and there
was a similar rule ---a revenue ruling — not a regulation —
a revenue ruling a few years later concerning the capitalisation
of depreciation, which, again, did not rely on Section 253.

It

relied on a case that said that construction was not part of
the taxpayer's trade or business.
And, I might say, of course, it is -- to make it
clear -- that that question: isn't before us today, because
the Government has conceded the construction by Idaho Power
Company of its facilities is part of its trade or business.
Q

Let me get that straight.

The Government has conceded
*

it is part of the trade or business?
MR. KERN:

Yes.

I believe

clear in the reply brief at page 9.
Q

well, it. Is made most
Footnote.

But, what they haven't conceded is whether it is

the principal trade or business.
MR. KEEN:
concedes that

No.

Is that the distinction?

What they ~~ I think the Government

Mr. Jones, I am sure, will correct me — I

think the Government concedes that this property, the property
used for construction, would be depreciable in its use for
construction, under* Section 167, but that depreciation is

31
— so far, we are entitled fco the depreciation, that that
depreciation must be capitalised under Section 263.
Q

I assume there is no question of that.
MR. KERN;

Mo question of that.

We are arguing that

Section 263,historieally, was not intended by Congress to
disallow or to apply to deduction for depreciation because
the depreciation is not an amount paid out, and, by its terms,
Section 263, requires only capitalisations of amounts paid out.
So that is where the point of departure is.
Well,I was discussing whether or not there was
a long and consistent administrative history, coming then,
and up to 1913 to 1955, the Government first asserted that
depreciation should be capitalised, anyway, in 1955.
In 1958, the regulation to which Mr. Jones refers,
was issued.

That’s regulation — 1.263-2(a) — and that

regulation sefc3 forth examples of costs which the Government
states should be capitalized and includes, therein, costs of
acquisition, construction or erection.
Mow, this is an example of that which should be
capitalized under Section 263, yet immediately before that,
the regulations repeat the mandate of 263, that is, capitaliza­
tion is required only of any amount paid out for. new building
or betterments, etcetera.
But, the regulation does say that costs should be
capitalized,

32
It is respectfully submitted that in no place does
it say that depreciation must be capitalised or that deprecia­
tion shall be treated as a cost for the purpose of Section 263.
Actually, the term "cost” as applied in the Internal
Revenue Code means that which must be capitalized, under the
Code, because certain items we would ordinarily consider to be
costs, perhaps, from a popular or economic point of view,
may be deducted and certainly may he capitalized»
So that cost as used in the regulation necessarily
refers only to those Items which must be capitalized»
Well, then, following ahead, along, through the
regulations, up

the last word which the Treasury Department

has issued concerning whether or not depreciation should be
capitalised has to do with the investment credit.
Now, the investment credit as allowed under Sections
46 and 48, is allowed as a percentage of the basis of property
/
constructed or acquired, including property constructed by
the taxpayer.
And the net effect of the regulations issued under
Section 146-C(i) and 1.48-B(4) was to the effect that the
taxpayer is entitled to take the investment credit on its
construction equipment and is not entitled to take the invest­
ment credit on the facilities that it has constructed.
In other words, those regulations, in effect, are
exactly in accordance with the position taken by the taxpsyer,

33
here, as to depreciation.
We believe we are entitled fco depreciation on the
equipment that we use in construction and we do not include
such depreciation on the basis of facilities constructed.
Now, it is true,under the investment credit regulation,
that they are written with certain self-serving provisions.
In other words, they are written in terms of if
depreciation is sustained on property that should be capitalized,
why, then, it won't be capitalised for the purpose of the
investment credit, but, instead, will not be considered to
be part of basis.
Now, if that were a proper interpretation of the
law, it would be exactly contrary to the Investment Credit Law
statute itself, because the statute requires that the invest­
ment credit be imposed on the basis of property constructed by
the taxpayer, and the regulations, in net effect, say that the
basis shall not include depreciation incurred by the taxpayer
on its construction equipment.
In consequence, what I am suggesting is, that there
has neither been a long, nor a consistent, history of the
Treasury Department in requiring capitalization of depreciation.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
further, Mr. Jones.

Do you have anything

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A, JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

NR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, I really have very

little to offer, but something opposing counsel said casts
Mr. Justice Powell's question in a somewhat different light
for me, and I did want to respond to that.
We are not taking the position in this case that
financial accounting is necessarily the guide to the
interpretation of the Tax Code.

What we are saying is that

when the taxpayer is claiming a deduction which Is not even
permitted by financial accounting, then, he really ought to
show very explicitly, very clearly, statutory language which
permits that deduction.
And, it is our position here that no such statutory
language has been shown, that to the contrary, we have pointed
out that Section 263 explicit!}? bars the deduction here.
That’s the necessary impact of Sections 161, which makes the
deduction for depreciation subject to the capitalisation
provision.
There are a number of small, little, points in this
case which have been argued.

X think they are all properly

answered in our brief and in our reply brief, and I won’t go
into them at length here, with one exception, which is the
taxpayer’s argument that there is something about the cases
under Sections 170 and 213 pertaining to the medical expense

35

deduction and 'cite charitable contribution deduction which is
favorable to him here.
Well, those provisions provide for deductions of
amounts paid during the taxable year, and the courts have
construed depreciation as not being an amount paid out during
the taxable year, for purposes of those deduction provisions.
The statute we are relying upon, Section 263, does
not require payraent during the taxable year.

It merely

requires an amount paid out at some time, and, as we have
shown, there has been an amount paid out here and it is
represented by the depreciation.
Q

Would the same thing be true of State and local

taxes paid upon this equipment?
MR. JONES:

The history of State and local taxes

and other carrying charges, such as interest, is a long one.
The courts in the, I think,*20’s and 130’s, perhaps the ‘30’s,
were, holding that those expenses were not capital items because
they did not improve the value of the taxpayer’s property.
The courts lie Id that those payments of taxes and interest were
merely incurred to retain ownership of the property, and for
that reason were not capital.
Q

One of the costs of ownership of the equipment that

was used in the construction of the capital asset.
IE.j JONES:

That’s right, and I think that the holding

that those items were not capital is subject to some question.

36
But, in our case, it is clear that the depreciation
on the construction equipment was incurred in the course of
improving the property, and, of course, in creating a new
capital asset.

And it is clearly capital.

And the earlier lower court decisions, holding that
interest and taxes weren’t properly capital was really a holding
on economic grounds rather than legal grounds, I think, really
aren’t the point here, nor are, as I say, the cases with
respect to the medical contributions and the medical deductions
and the charitable contributions.
The purpose of those deductions provisions is to
allow a deduction, to allow some tax relief, when a taxpayer
incurs an expense which he wouldn’t otherwise have to incur,
and all the cases which the respondent cites involve the
occasional use of an automobile or of an airplane, an automobile
or

an airplane which would have been depreciated anyway.
There was no reason in the purpose of the statute

to provide a deduction or permit a deduction of that depreciation
which would have been incurred anyway, and, therefore, 1 think,
the courts properly held that it was noa**deducttble under
those provisions.
Again, those decisions, it seems to us, have
absolutely nothing to do with the issue in this case.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
The case is submitted.

Thank you, gentlemen.
