PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Ho. 72-11^8, lioyt C. Cupp, Superintendent, Oregon
State Penitentiary versus Hugh Kyle Naughten.
Mr. Osborne, I think you may proceed whenever
you are ready, now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. OSBURN, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. OSBORNE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:
The sophisticated legal issue which is before the
Court in this case involving the presumption of witness
truthfulness, is an interesting contrast to the factual
situation which gave rise to the case and upon which the
state court trial jury was called upon to deliberate.
The Respondent, Naughten, was convicted in state
trial court of the crime of armed robbery involving, the
robbery of a late night drive-in market in Portland, Oregon.
Two eyewitnesses and a friend of his who i-jere in the store
testified as to the facts of the robbery, that as the
proprietor was locking the place up and getting ready to
close and just before he locked the place, a

man came in,

wnom the witness later identified as the Respondent, Naughten,
and brandished a pistol and informed Mr. Llvengood, according
to Mr. Livengood's testimony, that this was a stick-up and he

then forced the proprietor and the friend into the cooler
and told them to wait there until he was finished and then
the two men were sitting in the cooler and the friend said
to the proprietor, "Well, I think they are gone now," and so
the proprietor went out and the robber had not gone and
forced him again back into the cooler.
Then, a short time later, the friend again suggested
that the robber was gone by this time and they came out and
the proprietor called the police.

The police arrived fairly

immediately and it turned out that Mr. ilaughten's car had
been parked across the street in a tavern parking lot.
The police arrived and the proprietor, Mr. Livengood
identified the Respondent, IJaughten, as being the robber.
There was no line-up.

There were no V/ehde-Gilbert problems,

no problems of undue suggestibility.

Both the- proprietor

and the witness had seen Mr. Waughten for approximately a
period of Vj> minutes, most of which they were in his
presence, part of which they were back in the cooler.
There was also testimony by two police officers,
one who testified that he came and Mr. Livengood had identified
Maughten as the robber and there was also testimony that at
the time that ifaughfcen was handcuffed with his hands behind
nim, that he was attempting to stuff some money into the
cracks between the seat of the automobile.

This money

was later retrieved by the police and this, essentially, was

5
the testimony that was presented at the trial.
The defendant cross-examination consisted
primarily — the cross-examination consisted primarily of
asking the two eye witnesses about whether they talked about
the case, asking about why was it that the man who was
arrested, who was identified as Maughten, why it was that
he didn't have a pi3tol.
And the defendant didn’t present testimony,
didn't call any witnesses and the case went to the jury
then with the court'3 instructions.
How, the trial court instructed the jury that it
v/as the state's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt, instructed the jury that the defendant was presumed to
be innocent and the jury returned a verdict of guilty.
Q

I take it, Hr. Solicitor General, that you

viewed these evidentiary matters in detail, perhaps for
the purpose of indicating that the guilt was established by
overwhelming —
MR. OSBURN:
Q

Yes.

— evidence so there is no question?

MR. OSBURM:

This is the reason why we try to

present it in this fashion because it seems to us that on
tnose facts and given the instructions which the court gave,
clearly instructed on burden of proof, clearly instructed on
presumption of innocence, that it is just inconceivable to me

that a lay jury could have taken that instruction about
witnesses being presumed to speak the truth and could have
turned that, on the facts of this case, into an instruction
which did just the opposite and placed the burden of proof
on the defendant and this is particularly true in this case
because of what occurred at the time that the jury had
received its instructions and Counsel took his exception to
the instructions.
At the time that the prepared instructions were
given, the court and defense counsel, the prosecutor and
the defendant and the court reporter all went into the court’s
chambers and they then considered whether or not there were
exceptions to the instructions and Counsel

did take some

and one of the instructions which he requested which he
had not asked for was an instruction that the jury was not to
infer guilt from the fact that the defendant did not take
the stand.
This is what this instruction is.

Of course, there

is considerable disagreement among defense counsel as to
whether or not this is a good instruction or not.
counsel prefer it.

Some

Some consider that the Instruction is,

in the words of the ninth circuit, a "don’t put the jelly bean
in your nose" instruction because it simply calls attention

Q

Mr. Solicitor General, despite the overwhelmin

/'tt

to something that the jury might otherwise have overlooked.

7
evidence, as you say, I gather the court of appeals disagreed
with the district court that this was

a case in which

Harrington's harmless error rules by?
MR. 0SBUP1J:
Q

Yes,

Well, as it comes to us, at least, that

issue of harmless error is not before us, is it?
MR. OSBURM:

We 11, we think that it cornes before

the Court in two ways and maybe these are subtle statements
of the same principle.
Q

Did you argue?

MR. OSBURW:

Yes, we raised both of those issues.

The first way of stating it is this:

The

instruction itself, while it does present a colorable
Constitutional issue because it has been discussed in the
various circuits in a Constitutional context and the courts
have generally not given good marks to this instruction, that
our position is, it is Just not that bad, that it should
result in the reversal in federal habeas corpus of a jury
verdict on these facts, that it is just incovceivable that on
the facts of the case and, given the clear, precise
instructions that the Court gave, that a Jury could possibly
even have understood what the
Q

legal issue is all about.

So you suggest that the Ninth Circuit apparenti

adopted the view that any Constitutional error was prejudicial
per se and that was what obviated the determination?

8
MR. OSBURN:

Yes.

Now, they also found that none of the other
instructions which the trial judge had given specifically
obviated the problem that is involved in this instruction.
Well, we think that it did because the jury was
called back or rather, the court and parties went

back into

the courtroom after the jury had been sitting there and they
were called back into the courtroom and the Court again gives
and instruction which says that the burden of proof is*on the
state, the state must prove its case

beyond a reasonable

doubt and the defendant is presumed to be innocent.
Now, we certainly recognize that it is fundamental
to our law that

the guilt of the defendant in a criminal

case must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
It is not quite so clear that an instruction
must be given to a state court trial jury that the defendant
is presumed to be innocent,

nevertheless, that is an

instruction which is always given under our state lav; and
which was given in this case.
Now, then, the question is, what is there about
the presumption instruction that suddenly shifts the
burden to the defendant even though the court has said time
and again that the defendant had no burden.
Well, the argument goes that where the defendant
does not testify and where the defendant does not present any

9
evidence or call any witnesses, that the instruction really
amounts to a presumption that witnesses who were called by
the state have told the truth because the instruction is
expressed in terms of a rebuttable presumption.
"Every witness is presumed to speak the truth,"
says the instruction. "This presumption may be overcome by
the manner in which the witness testifies, by the nature of
his or her testimony, by evidence affecting his or her
character, interest or motives, by contradictory evidence or
by a presumption."
How, the instruction said, in its very words that,
while the witness is presumed to speak the truth, that the
witness himself may overcome that presumption.

The

presumption may be overcome by the manner in which the
witness testifies, by the nature of his testimony.

The

jusry was again told at a later place in the instructions
that "You are not bound to find in conformity with the
testimony of the declarations of any number of witnesses
which did not produce belief in your minds."
Now, we have tried, as is our lawerly duty to —
in the brief — to explain why the instruction is given, to
explain what it is intended to convey and I think, essentially,
it is simply intended to convey the impressions of the jury
that the jury is there to hear the testimony.

They are there

to hear the witnesses and they may begin with a presumption

10
that a person who Is sworn on oath Is not going to commit
perjury and until there is something that occurs, something
about the way the witness testifies, something about the way
he looks, or the nature of what he says that convinces a
person that he is not telling the truth.
Q

This "permissive" is a matter under the

Oregon statute, as I understand it.
MR. OSBURN:
Q

Yes.

In your experience, Is it usually given or is

it usually not given?
MR. OSBURN:
years.

This instruction was given for many

It has been part of the standard form instructions.
Q

The statute goes back to 1862, you tell us?

MR. OSBURN:
Q

Yes.

And there was a CAlifornia statute from 1872

until 1965, saying the same thing.

But I wonder as a matter

of practice, is it usually given in criminal cases in
Oregon or usually not given?
MR. OSBURN:

Or don't you know?

I have had occasion to speak to

judicial conferences, of course, and I have discouraged the
giving of the instruction.
The Supreme Court of Oregon says it is not error
if you give it.
Q

Right.

MR. OSBURN:

But that doesn't mean that it has to

/

-11

be given and so we have discouraged its use but it has
generally been given.
Q

It generally is given, in your experience?

MR. OSBURN:
Q

Yes.

Even when the defendant does not take the

stand, does come on for testimony?
MR. OSBURN:
Q

Yes.

Nobody ever draws a line, there?

MR. OSBURN:

Well, this is an instruction that

has been given for about 100 years and it is only in the last
two years, in fact, this is the first known case in which
anybody has challenged the instruction.
q

Well, do you see a difference in a case

where the prosecution puts on eight witnesses and the
defendant puts on eight witnesses and a case vfhere the
prosecution puts on eight witnesses and the defendant puts
on none?
You don't see any difference?
MR. OSBURN:

I don't see any difference in this

instruction.
Q!

That is from Government.

MR. OSBURN:

I don't see any difference.

The

manner of evaluating when a person gets on the stand, the
manner of how you start out looking at him, whether or not you
say to yourself, all right, this is a person who is called

12

is going to tell the truth, that applies across the board to
all witnesses.

Yes.

edition and also the *65

I see no reference to the 1970 edition in either

brief, where the instruction is omitted.
HR. OSBURN:

Yes, I had thought that was referred

to in the response of my opponent, but maybe it has not been.
Q

But maybe that source of the use among your

/

trial judges is notv eliminated.
HR. OSBURN:

Well, of course, Mathis’ instructions

are federal instructions.
' Q

Yes.

MR. OSBURN:

And our state courts, as do most

state courts, have their own uniform jury instructions.
Q

And yours preceded the mapless form by many,

many years.
MR. OSBURN:
Q

Yes.

But the mapless form was almost universally

disfavored, shall I put it, by courts of appeals.
MR. OSBURN:

Well, it is unusual in that I think

as we indicated Judge Mathis was a California trial judge
when
and/he had the opportunity to prepare uniform jury
instructions, he put that in, apparently because of his
California background and it immediately met with disfavor
by practically every circuit and —
Q

Is this the only circuit to say, however, that

it has a Constitutional infirmity?
MR. OSBURN:

There are cases — many of the cases

which, of course, are federal prosecution, do speak in terms

14

of Constitutional infirmity.

But they are talking in a

context in which they don’t have to put it on Constitutional
grounds because the courts of appeals, of course, are free to
/

suggest that the instruction is a poor one, which it very
well may be.
Q

Supervisory.

HR. OSBURN:
Q

Yes.

My question is that at least one circuit

reversed on pure supervisory powers.
MR. OSBURN:
Q

Yes.

I don’t know about the others.

MR. OSBURN:

And, as we indicate, there is only

one case out of the myriad of cases that have disapproved the
instruction in which, like this case, that is the only issue
that is raised.

Normally, there has been some other problem,

the problem of failure to give an accomplice instruction or
something like this.

But our concern here is, and the reason

for requesting this Court to review the case is that, of
course, there is a Constitutional alterable question
here.

Of course we recognize that.

presented

Our concern is, though,

that there must be some point at which we say that although
a

colorable Constitutional issue is presented, that the

Constitutional — the problem is really not one of Constitu­
tional magnitude such as to justify overturning the decision
of the jury and requiring the defendant to be tried anew.

15
I think, basically, that states our position.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Hr. Solicitor General.
Mr. Runkel.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP ROSS R. RUNKEL, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OP THE RESPONDENT
MR. RUNKEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I'd just like to quote a couple of more lines
from the instructions to begin with.

The Appendix, page 15,

the judge instructs the jury on what a presumption means.
"A presumption is a deduction which the law
expressly directs to be made from particular facts," and so
on.

And then proceeds to discuss the various presumptions

involved of which there are really only two, this truthfulness
presumption and the so-called presumption of innocence.
Nov/, it is our position that the truthfulness
presumption is in direct contradiction in terms, in theory
and in effect to the

Constitutional burden of proof.

The burden of proof —
Q

Where do you find the burden of proof

standard in the Constitution?
MR. RUNKEL:

It is in the due process clause,

your HOnor, by decision of this Court and several others.
Q

It is rooted, we now say, in the due process

16
clause, but it is not explicit anywhere in the Constitution.
MR. RUNKEL:

No, it is not expressed.

The burden of proof means a number of things.
can

It

mean the burden of pleading, the burden of proceeding

with the evidence, the burden of persuasion.

And the only

meaning it can really have that has any effect is the burden
of persuading the jury of the truth of the allegations and
so by saying that you are to presume that whatever these
witnesses say is true, it seems to me that that is In direct
contradiction to the concept of the burden of proof being on
the state.
Q

Suppose, Counsel, that this instruction had

been given before any evidence went in, as some trial judges
In some courts do give some general instructions so the jurors,
particulary jurors at the outset of their service, will grasp
the burden of proof concept before they hear the evidence.
Suppose these instructions had been given in
advance?

Would you think that would lighten the problem

any?
HR. RUNKEL:

I think it makes a big difference and

I think the position of the state seems to be that maybe the
instruction was given at the beginning because, perhaps when
the witness first gets on the stand, you might accord him a
certain deference that he will not either lie or make innocent
errors.

But now we are dealing with a situation where the

17

witness has already testified and now you are telling the
jury that they must presume that these witnesses have, in
fact, testified truthfully and I’d like to contrast that with
another point in time where vte talk about the truthfulness of
witnesses and that is on appeal.
I have

cited innumerable cases where the comment

is made that witnesses should be presumed to have told the
truth and here we are doing a completely different thing.
iJow we are looking back on the case and saying, was there
sufficient evidence to go to the jury and, in testing the
sufficiency of evidence, of course, we take the case in the
light most favorable to the state and by doing that we
presume that the witnesses did tell the truth but that onlygets us past the question of whether the case should go to
the jury and now what we are doing in this case is, the state
is saying that — the judge is saying, this evidence is
sufficient.

Therefore, it goes to the jury.
And, secondly, you must presume that this

sufficient evidence is, in fact, true.

And

it seems to me

then that there is really no difference at all between the
sufficiency of evidence rule, which may simply mean that
there is some evidence, and the rule that the burden of
persuasion lies with the state.

It seems to me they are

hopelessly confused by this construction.

But I would say

that if the instruction were given at the outset that it

18
certainly w6uld make more sense.
Now. it Is inescapable that we have to talk about
presumption and inference cases here.

I have taken the

position, of course, that this is really not a true
presumption at all because a presumption is a situation where
you have a fact proved and the jury is told that from that
they should deduce a second fact.
In this case, it seems to me that there is no
proved fact.

But I think it is important to distinguish

the line of cases in this Court, the most recent one being
Barnes, from the spring, working all the way back through
Gainey, Romano, Tot,Ball and Back and so on, virtually all
of which, it seems to me, involve inferences.
In other words, the jury is told, you may if you
wish, link these two facts together in your minds.
In this case, the jury Is told, you are expressly
directed to link these two facts together in your minds.
Now, the reformulation of the inference rule In
Barnes seems to be that the judge may instruct on an
inference if a rational juror— excuse me, this is not in
my brief because I think that was decided about- the time I
was in the printer's office — a rational juror — If a
rational juror would be able to link the two facts and find
the presumed fact beyond a reasonable doubt.
But that is in a mere

^nference #

Here, we are

19
telling the jury that you must find.

In that case, it seems

to me, the judge can give the instruction only if a judge,
himself, would find that the facts are linked beyond a
reasonable doubt.

Because the jury has no option at all.

They must find this fact to be true.
And

if I can make a comment about Blandis against

Klein, \tfhlch is a whole other situation from the spring,
involving an irrebuttable presumption in a civil case, I
take it that the rebuttal presumption in this case is one
notch lower than Blandis against Klein.

What you will notice

in Blandis, the Court holds that that kind of an irrebuttable
presumption can be used only when the fact would follow
necessarily and uniformly and, certainly, we are not asking
for that much.

We are only asking that a judge be able to

find beyond a reasonable doubt, not uniformly and exclusively.
Now, the opinions from the other courts, both
within the last ten years and over a hundred-year span.
Indicate, first, that the presumption of truthfulness Is not
a standard exception to the reasonable doubt standard.

It

has never been simply included as a part of the package.
Secondly, every time the presumption of truthfulness
seems to raise its head, particularly In the last ten years,
It becomes crushed.
Nov/, in the circuit courts
Q

Excuse me, I didn’t hear what you said.

20
MR. RUNKEL:

Every time the presumption of

truthfulness raises its head, the court seemed to crush it,
in one fashion or another.
Q

Pardon?

On Constitutional grounds?

MR. RUNKEL:

Not always.

I think it is very difficult to

read both state cases and circuit cases from the standpoint
of whether they are federal Constitutional grounds or
supervisory or, in the state cases, where they

are state

Constitutional grounds.
Q

Or simply error.

MR. RUNKEL:

Or simply error on federal

Constitutional grounds.
Q

Error of a non-Constitutional magnitude.

MR. RUNKEL:
I

guess.

In a state case you have three choices,

But, in reading the language, certainly, of the

opinions, they usually talk in terms of presumption of
innocence which I think is precisely the same thing as the
burden of proof being on the- Government and the interference
with the prerogatives of the Jury and I should say that it
t

'

i

-v-'

seems to me that in three of the circuit cases, the one we
are arguing today, in addition, Johnson from the Third
Circuit and Birmingham from the Tenth Circuit, there really
were no other substantial issues involved.

Obviously, all of

the rest of the cases, as all cases do, involved a number of
issues and you can't get a pure case every time.

21
Q

Would this problem arise In a case where the

defendant put on witnesses?
MR. RUNKEL:
there.

Well, I think the problem is still

It is obviously much more irrational to presume —

not irrational, unfair and unbalanced to presume that only
the state's witnesses are telling the truth.

I think it is

just as Irrational to presume that the defendant's witnesses
are telling the truth.
Q

Well, but the instruction is that the presump­

tion is that all witnesses are telling, the truth and that If
the prosecution's witnesses say, "He’s the man," and the
defense witness says,"He is not the man," then the problem
disappears.
MR. RUNKEL:

Then it is less burdensome for the

defendant but more irrational because the witnesses obviously
are contradictory and how can you have a presumption that they
are both telling the truth?
Q

Well, but the instruction Itself says there

are many ways in which

presumption can be overcome, does

it not?
MR. RUNKEL:
Q

Yes, can be overcome.

In general, It Is sort of a general

instruction about the credibility of witnesses and how the
jury is to approach whether to believe a witness or not and
you say that the instructions must leave the jury completely

22
at large on that question.
MR. RUNKEL:

No, not completely at large at all.

There are many cases in which —
Q

Well, you wouldn't insist that they say that

the state's witnesses be assumed not to tell the truth.

You

wouldn't insist on that?
MR. RUNKEL:
Q

No, but you wouldn't insist on that.

MR. RUNKEL:
Q

Well, I couldn't object to it.

I wouldn't ask for it at all.

Then they are supposed to be left completely

in neutral?
MR. RUNKEL:

No, no, I know of no case that holds

that a jury has to be turned loose at large and there are
many cases in which it is perfectly permissable even for the
judge to make the comment that in his mind the proof has
been made beyond a reasonable doubt.

But in every case like

that I have seen, the judge goes ahead and then says, "But
now, you don't have to take my word for it."
In this case, though, the jury is told that you
must find.
Q

It says presumed.

MR. RUNKEL:

It says, "The Court directs you to

find."
Q

It says presumed, yes.

MR. RUNKEL:

Well, that is the way I read — that

23
Is why I reread the Instruction where the jury is told what
a presumption is.

A presumption is a deduction which the

law directs expressly to be made.

In other words, that is

not a comment on the evidence.
Q

But it is a comment on whether the jury is

to believe a witness or not.
MR. RUWKEL:

Well, I think it is not a comment

in the sense of this is my opinion, take it or leave it or
like an inference instruction is.

This is telling the jury

that they mu3t find, unless it is rebutted.
Q

Did he tell the jury that they were the sole

judges of the facts, the usual —*
MR. RUIJKEL:

Yes, right at the outset of the

instruction.
Q

Do you think that tends somewhat to neutralize

the —
MR, RUMKEL:

You would think so at first if you

only read the — this is a

problem, I think, that was brought

up in the Cool case from last year, is, how do you read your
instructions?

Do you parcel them out or do you read them

all together?

Do

you see what I mean?

We have to read

them together and if I can read, on page 12 of the Appendix,
it says, "The jury is the sole and exclusive judges of the
facts and reliability."

It is followed, however, by a

sentence which says, that"The jury's power is not arbitrary

24
and if the Court instructs you as to the law in a particular*
subject, or how to judge the evidence, you must follow the
instructions."

And so they are saying, you are the exclusive

judges, so long as you follow the judge’s instructions, and
the instructions are, that you must find them to be truthful.
Q

So it is unconstitutional of you to instruct

the jury that they must believe a witness unless he is
contradicted?

Or, uncontradicted evidence must be believed

by the jury.
HR. RUNKEL:

Well, I thinlc if that is unconstitu­

tional, it is probably unconstitutional under the
clause, as to any witness.

jury

In this case, of course, we are

dealing with witnesses who, in fact testified on behalf of
the state so that places the burden of persuasion — well,
there is no burden of persuasion then.
Q

Well, the judge, In effect, told the jury,

"The witnesses you have heard, you should believe."
MR. RUNKEL:

You must believe.

Q

No, he said "should."

Q

He did qualify it by saying that If a manner

of testifying might be taken into consideration or that
contradiction —
MR. RUNKEL:
Q

Yes.

He did the usual kind of qualifications

you would expect.

MR, RUNKEL:
not the usual ones.

1 think not, your HOnor.

They are

There is nothing here about things on

the nature of bias or motivation that they can take into
account.

Absent evidence —
Q

Le t

me ask you this, Mr. Runkel, where you

said, "Every witness is presumed to speak the truth," on page
16 of the Appendix.

Then he says, "This presumption may­

be overcome by the manner

in which the witness testifies, by

the nature of his or her testimony, by evidence affecting
his or her character, interest or motive."
MR, RUNKEL:
Q

Yes.

‘Now, wouldn’t that include bias?

MR. RUMKEL:

Yes, as a matter of evidence.

But

you see, that shifts the burden to the defendant to put on
evidence and in the criminal case, the defendant has no
obligation to either put on evidence as it relates to the
affirmative case.
Q

No, but certainly you can show a prosecution

witness’ bias by cross-examination, without bringing any
witnesses of your own in.
MR. RUNKEL:

That is true.

That is true.

It can

be done by cross-examination, and there was a certain amount
here.

But there is also the burden of persuasion and you may

be able to get the evidence on by the state’s own witnesses,
in other words, that simply means you don’t have to go out

26
and drum up witnesses, but the state still has the burden of
persuasion if the facts were true.
Q

You mean, all this did was to disentitle the

jury to disbelieve evidence that is not contradictive?
MR. RUNKEL:
Q

Yes.

That is, sometimes juries are free to disbeliev

the only witness in the case.
MR. RUNKEL:
Q

Well, they aren’t here.

MR. RUNKEL:
Q

I think they always are.

Yes, they are.

You say they are here*

MR. RUNKEL:

NO, they are entitled, in this case,

to disbelieve these witnesses and all of them if the
defendant persuades —
Q

No, no, in this case, where there weren't any

other witnesses on the defendant’s side.
In this case, you say the jury wasn’t free
to disbelieve the government's witnesses.
MR. RUNKEL:

I think that is a slight overstatement

of my argument.
Q

Because they were told they could disbelieve

it by the very manner in which the witness testified.
MR. RUNKEL:

Well, then, they are permitted to

disbelieve him.
Q

Well, then, what is wrong with it, if they

27

are free to disbelieve it?
MR. RUNKEL:

The problem is that the burden of

persuasion has to be on the Government.

Now, the only time

the burden can shift to the defendant is after the Government
has carried the burden on the onus of the crime.

Me can put

the burden on the defendant to prove insanity, excuse,
justification and various defenses.
Q

Well, why does the defendant have the right

of cross-examination?
MR. RUNKEL:

If what you say is true?
That is a separate clause of the

Constitution, your IlOnor.
Q

It Is there.

MR. RUNKEL:
Q

Yes.

Well, suppose there was an instruction, the

court said, you noticed all the witnesses took an oath.
\tfant to tell you what that means.

I

It means that if he lies,

he goes to jail.
MR. RUNKEL:
perjury, your Honor.
Q

I don't

think this is a case of

Perjury x^as mentioned by the Solicitor.

What is the difference betiveen that and saying

he is presumed to tell the truth?
MR. RUNKEL:

Truth means what the judge has said

it means, which is that that is what the jury is there to
find out, is the truth, and truth means objective truth, not
perjury or lying versus not lying.

23

Q

Well, would you testify to the construction

that Justice Marshal-5, just proposed?

Would you think that

was unconstitutional if the judge reminded them that the
if
witnesses had taken an oath and/that they had not told the
truth, they would be subject to prosecution for perjury?
MR. RUMKEL:

I think that was — I wouldn't

object to it except that it is not an accurate statement of
the law because not telling the truth is not perjury.
Perjury is a deliberate and intentional lying on a* material
fact.
Q

I was taking a short-cut.

Read that into

the instructions.
HR. RUNKEL:

Okay, read that in, that*® fine.

you see, that is not what theyTre being told.

But,

They are being

told that the witness —
Q

To you think that is less objectionable,

has less impact upon the defendant, than what was said here?
MR. RUNKEL:
Q

Yes.

Oh, well —

MR. RUMKEL:

It is certainly more rational.

If

the person takes an oath, he knoxirs that he must conform his
conduct to the perjury statutes.

But there is nothing about

taking an oath that improves his perception or his memory or
his articulation and that is what we are dealing with when we
are talking about telling the truth.
Q

Well, Mr. Runkel, I gather that 16, after

29
discussing presumption, In effect, the Court instructed
resumptions are to be accepted by you as true unless outweighed
or equalled and then, in the second succeeding paragraph,
doesn’t the court instruct them how they may be outweighed or
equalled, namely "Overcome by the manner in which the witness
testifies, or the nature of his or her testimony"?
MR. RUHKEL:

Yes, but that 3imply makes it a

rebuttable presumption instead of an irrebuttable presumption
instead of an irrebuttable presumption and of course, an
irrebuttable presumption would be worse.
But the problem is that "overcome" means — or
equal — means that now the defendant must carry at least a
preponderance burden.
Q

No, but the jury — under that language, the

jury on its own motion and its own mind to say, "This fellow
testified in such a manner that we don’t believe him," without
the defendant having to do a thing.
MR. RUNKEL:

Hot do a thing In terms of put on

evidence.
Q

Ho, even argue.

MR. RUNKEL:

But he must persuade them that the

jury should —
Q
its mind, see?

Ho, he doesn't.

The jury has already made up

If the jury may decide it doesn’t believe

him because of the manner in testifying.

30

MR. RUNKEL:

Perhaps that is theoretically true,

but I think we have to operate under the rule of the game that
the jury will comply with the instructions of the court and
will not make decisions based on things off the record.
Q

I don't suppose it would make any difference,

but let me ask you, Mr. Runkel:

Suppose, in speaking of

overcoming the presumption, this being a case where there was
no evidence other than the state's witnesses, had the court
left out,"by evidence affecting his or her character," because
there was none, "by contradictory evidence," because there was
none, and this had just been left with, "overcome by the
manner in which the witness testifies, by the nature of his
or her testimony," would you be making the same argument?
MR. RUNKEL:

Yes, simply because the burden is

on the Government to persuade the jury that the facts are
true.
Q

Yes, but even though this tells the jury that,

in effect, if you just don't believe him, if you think the
witness is lying, then that is the end of the presumption.
Isn't that, in effect, what this court
MR. RUNKEL:

means?

If the defendant can persuade them by

a preponderance that the witness is not telling the truth,
then the witness can be disregarded.
Q

But may I ask you, since I have interrupted

you, in your own experience, I gather this

-

in

31
discretionary, Isn’t it, with the trial ^udge?
MR, RUNKEL:

Yes, and I’d like to distinguish that

from — I think it was —
Q

Well, may I ask you a question?

MR. RUNKEL:
Q

Yes.

In your own experience, does it make a

difference with the trial judge whether the defense has put
on a case?
MR. RUNKEL:

I don’t think I can answer that from

my own experience, your Honor.
But I would like to distinguish that from the
concept of a permissive situation, permissive only in the
sense that the judge is not statutorily commanded to give
the instruction.

But it is not permissive in the sense of

an inference as opposed to a presumption.
Now, I would like to make a couple of other
comments.

One is that, for the life of me, I cannot under­

stand what interest the State of Oregon has in giving this
instruction.

It seems to me they don’t need it.

It’s

something that —
Q

I think there is general agreement on that in

the profession, isn't there?
A

I think so, but it seems to me that when we

are dealing with the concept of due process and the burden of
proof that the state's need, or previous cases argued today,

32
talking about compelling state interest, the state has
virtually no interest at all in having this instruction.
And, in the due process area, I think that the
state’s need is a relevant criterion.
How, as far as the harmless error doctrine goes —
Q

How do you read what the Ninth Circuit has

said about harmless error?

Is Constitutional error

automatically, it is prejudicial?
MR. RUNKEL:

It has never been the rule in the

Ninth Circuit and —
Q

Well, what does this language mean, in the

opinion?
’’The appellee also contends that the instruction —
I am looking at page 21 of the —
MR. RUNKEL:
Q

I have it.

”— even if fatally

defective under the

Federal Constitution, was, in the circumstances, harmless
beyond all reasonable doubt, we reject this argument also.
Once Norton established the infringement of a Constitutionally
protected right, the burden shifted to the Appelllee to
establish that the error was harmless.”
MR. RUNKEL:

Well, I think perhaps the law under

Chapman and Harrington, and the court, the Ninth Circuit
is simply saying that the state has not carried its burden
of showing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable

33
doubt, which is a — I think an impossible thing to do in
any event.

We are saying that — if we apply the harmless

error rule, and I am taking the position, of course, that the
harmless error rule cannot apply here, you are saying that
an appellate court can determine, beyond a reasonable doubt,
that if the jury had been given proper reasonable doubt
standards, they would have convicted anyway and it is quite
impossible to engraph these other harmless error cases into
this one because harmless error cases ordinarily involve
maybe a little comment that the defendant didn't take the
stand, or maybe a little extra illegal heroin introduced into
a drug case.
Q

Well, your argument does rest upon our

acceptance of your proposition that this was a Constitutional
error, the instruction was Constitutional error.
MR. RUNKEL:

Ab s olutely.

And the fact that the evidence was sufficient
does not mean that the error was harmless because you can
stack up 15 or 20 witnesses and if you presume that they have
all told the truth, then

you would never have a burden on

the state and any case \irould be harmless.
Q

Well, this evidence would be a little bit

more than sufficient, wouldn’t you say?

You are not

suggesting that it was just enough to get to a jury?
MR. RUNKEL:

No, I

don’t think there is any

distinction to be made between just enough to get to a jury —
Q

Wellj that is a different point, but your

position, then, would be that it doesn't make any difference,
the weight of the evidence is irrelevant on this point?
MR. RUNKEL:

No, I think the only relevant point

is Vfhat — if a juror complied with the instructions, what
logical steps would he take in reaching his verdict?
from the quantity or the quality of the evidence.

Apart

Although I

would point out that as far as acceptJ.ng the state's
argument on harmless error, that it could be harmless, where
was the gun ten minutes after the robbery?
so-called raincoat that the robber wore?

Where was the
Why was he driving

a car and there were two other people in the car?

Why did

the police arrest three defendants in the car and only charge
one with the crime?

It seems to me there is some doubt here

about guilt and innocence which the jury might have
considered, if they were not required to believe the state's
witnesses.
Thank you, your Honors,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You are welcome.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Solicitor General?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. OSBURN, ESQ.
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. OSBURN:

Just briefly, your Honor.

We assume,

I think, as lawyers, that the words that we say in a courtroom

35
are hung on by the jury and that they attach great significan.ce
to them and we've talked now, both in the briefs and in oral
argument about this instruction.

Remember, this is an

instruction that went to the jury in about fifteen seconds
and they heard that in the middle of all kinds of other
instructions about other things.
We ask a great deal of jurors.
in who are cabdrivers and housewives.

We bring people

We sit them down in

a courtoom and we parade witnesses in front of them and then
ask people to make a decision.
We think the fact-finding system here was fair,
that adequate evidence was presented and that there is
nothing essentially wrong with the standard which was
employed by the court, that the instruction is not a model,
but it is just not that bad.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General.
Mr. Runkel, you came here at the request of the
Court and by appointment and on behalf of the courtroom, I
want to thank you for your assistance to the man you are
representing and your assistance to the Court in presenting
the case.
MR. RUNKEL:

Thank you, your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 2:47 o’clock, the case was
submitted.]
