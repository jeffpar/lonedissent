E52£:SS.2£!i2§,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 72-985, 1073, 1196.
Mr. Anderson, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. ANDERSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION
MR. ANDERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
My name is John M. Anderson, and I represent in
these consolidated cases the California Bankers Association.
These consolidated cases entail a challenge to an
Act of Congress passed late in 1970 that has come to be known
as the Bank Secrecy Act.
And in our discussions today I think it's initially
important to distinguish, as much as we can at all times,
between the two aspects of that Act.
One aspect of that Act entails and requires the
banks, uninsured and otherwise, of this nation to microfilm
and copy virtually every piece of paper that flows through
the domestic banking system, and to keep that paper microfilm
for a period ranging from two to five years.
The second part of the Act, Title II, requires banks
to make reports of certain kinds of designated currency
transactions, domestic and foreign.
With that background in mind, and in June of 1972,

4
the private litigants in this case initiated an action in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of
California# seeking to enjoin enforcement of both the
recordkeeping and the reporting sections of the Bank Secrecy
Act,
With one judge dissenting# a three-judge court
denied motions to enjoin enforcement of the recordkeeping
section of the Act# but granted an injunction enjoining
enforcement of the automatic reporting provisions of the Act.
The government has appealed from that portion of
that order# enjoining enforcement of the reporting provisions.
The private litigants have appealed from that portion
of the order refusing to enjoin the so-called recordkeeping
section.
Let me begin with a very brief summary description
of just what those records — excuse me ~ reporting provisions
entail.
The Act compels reports of all domestic currency
transactions found by the Secretary to# quote# "have a high
degree of usefulness in criminal# tax or regulatory
investigations or proceedings."
The implementing regulation currently in force
require banks# among others# to report automatically all
$10,000 currency trans actions.
And I should interject here that when I say currently

5

in force, I use the phrase advisedly, because the Act
authorizes, and the regulations following through on that
authorize a change in that dollar amount, or, in fact, the
definition of transaction, at any time by idle Treasury
Secretary.
The transaction report of the currency transaction
requires disclosure of a wide variety of information, including
the name, address, and business or profession of the party
involved in the transaction; the name, address, and business
of the party or business entity for whom it may have been
conducted; —
QUESTION;
take?

Ordinarily what form does the transaction

Just cashing a check?
MR* AMDERSQNs

No. This is a currency transaction,

Mr. Justice Brennan, which is defined in the regulation as
being cash or near cash, monetary instruments.

It does not

entail, for example, a situation in which a person would go
into a bank and simply deposit a check and not take out any
currency,
QUESTION;

No, no,

I mean does he cash — suppose

he cashes a check for $15,000?
MR. ANDERSON;

That would be included, and, as a

matter of fact, in listing the requirements that must be
reported at the time of the designated transaction, it
requires a description of the nature of the transaction,

6

whatever that means, together with, the type, amount, and
denomination of the currency involved, and a description of
any check involved in the transaction.
QUESTION:

So that if I came in and wanted to cash

a check for $15,000, before it was cashed the teller, or
whoever it was, would have to get all this information from
me? is that it?
MR. ANDERSON:

That is correct.

QUESTION: And then he'd also have to note down
how many fi£ty-del1ar bills, how many hundred-dollar bills,
and that sort of thing?
MR. ANDERSON:
QUESTION:

That is also correct,

Unh-hunh, and what else?

What else has

to be done?
MR. ANDERSON:

And it also requires a description,

as I say, of the check involved; also a description of the
I.D. that is presented by the party seeking to engage in the
transaction.
QUESTION: What's that mean?
MR. ANDERSON:

This presumably means something like

a driver's license or a birth certificate, or some other form
of identification that would be acceptable to the banking
entity.
Now, there is an exception ~
QUESTION:

Description of the check would be, I

7
expect, on what hank it was drawn, and that sort of thing?
MR. ANDERSON;

That is not further defined in the

regulations, Mr. Justice; however, I would like to interject
at one time, there is an exception to the reporting require­
ments, the exception itself is the basis for one of our
challenges to the constitutioncility of this Act.

find it

reads in words and effect to the following proposition:
That if the bank, in its judgment, decides that
this transaction is normal and regular for the person
engaging in it, i.e., perhaps of a store which deals in a
large amount of cash, that it need not be reported.
However, we submit that the description is so vague
as to leave the banks in the position of not knowing when,
in fact, a prescribed transaction has occurred.

And since,

in fact, there are criminal penalties attendant refusal or
failure to give the report, it raises a due process notice
problem in our rainds.
QUESTION:

I suppose, on the fact of it, that

would mean, if I cams in twice a week with checks for
$15,000 to be cashed, the time might come when the bank would
think there was no reason any longer to take that information
from me?
MR. ANDERSON: That is —
QUESTION:

Because it’s a regular — even though I

might be kingpin of the lottery racket and that sort of thing?

8
MR. ANDERSON:

11aat is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan.

However, it has to be said that the regulation is
couched in terms of regular and normal for the business or
profession involved.
QUESTION:

It would more likely be that if they knew

that the particular person ran a machine shop v?ith a payroll
of about $15,000 a week, that they could then conclude that
this was normal, for payroll purposes, and not make a report.
MR» ANDERSON:
QUESTION:

That is true.

But, let's assume that, on the other hand,

if it's widely reputed to be a number of some one of these
organized crime groups, do you think the bank could safely
make that decision, in that way?
MR. ANDERSON:

I don't know, frankly, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION: Well, what would you advise them if they
asked you?
MR, ANDERSON:

My advice to the bank in that

particular instance would be:

In view of the fact that

criminal penalties attach failure to make a report, as
required by the Act, that it is in your best interest to act
cautiously and to make the report if you have any reason to
believe that this is not normal and regular for this
particular party.
QUESTION:

I suppose you'd weigh in the equation

9

the fact that I mentioned hypothetically, that the man is
engaged, or widely reputed to he engaged in unlawful
activity, and, unlike the other gentleman, did not have a
machine shop with a $15,000 payroll every xreek.
MR. ANDERSON:

Yes, I think we certainly would.

Yes, I think that would ~
QUESTION:

Doesn't your answer to the Chief

Justice's question solve at least a good part of your vagueness
problem, since, if you don't want to try to come within -the
exemption, the bank is perfectly free to report all trans­
actions.

It doesn’t have to rely on the normal exception.
MR. ANDERSON:

Yes, the banks, of course, are free

to report all transactions.

However, our objection to the

reporting requirement is not vagueness, as such? our objections
run to the Fourth Amendment problems, which I'll get to if I
may in just a moment.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn't that at least solve your

vagueness argument so far as the exception is concerned?
MR. ANDERSON:

Well, it is simply to say that in

every instance, that whenever a $10,000 currency transaction
occurrs, of which there are, in the case of large commercial
banks, presumably, many hundreds a day, that a report would
be required to be filed.
And I think my brothers in the Solicitor General's
office would agree, that's not what the Treasury Department

10
wants,

It wants reports of transactions which, in -the judgment

of the bank, are unusual for that particular depositor.
The result, otherwise, would be a simple inundation
of the Treasury Department, with reports which it presumably
couldn't use and would be useless to the extent of 95 percent.
So I think, as a practical matter, I'd have to
answer in that fashion.
The summary with respect to the reporting obligation,
I fell ink can be put as simply this s
That when the transaction occurs, the banks> by some
fashion, are obligated to obtain a wide variety of information
about that transaction, which, in the absence of the compulsion
under this Act, they would under no circumstances need for
their own banking purposes.

This is an obligation imposed

by the government.
How, turning to a very brief summary description of
tine recordkeeping, the Act makes a finding of adequate records,
"have a high degree of usefulness in" — the same words —
"criminal, tax or regulatory investigations or proceedings."
It. makes a further finding that microfilm or other
copies of bank records are highly useful.

And the Act then

provides that, and I'm quoting now, "where the Secretary of
the Treasury determines that the maintenance of appropriate
types of records and other evidence by insured banks has a
high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax or regulatory

11
investigations or proceedings, he shall prescribe regulations
to carry out the purposes of the Act,”
Now, the regulations and alleged implementation of
the foregoing purposes of the Act have required the banks of
the United States to copy and to retain, as I have, said, for
a period of from two to five years, virtually every single
piece of paper that finds its way into the American domestic
banking system, with two exceptions:
One exception has to do with payroll checks
emanating from a large payroll.

The catch at this point, of

course, is that although they're not recorded at the issuing
point, they would be recorded as they go into the, presumably,
account of the payee.
The second exception is for checks of under $100 in
amount.

The catch here is, first, that the bank microfilming

equipment, as a matter of common knowledge

and although we

had no chance to prove this at the District Court, because
this amendment was made after this District Court decision -but the obligation not to copy checks under $100 is of little
or no practical use to the bank, because the microfilm
equipment simply can't distinguish between $100 checks and
$1,000 checks.
Now, I will not read for the Court at this point
all of the documents that are required to be copied.

1

submit, however, that a reading of the regulations, quoted on

12

pages 38 and 39 of the Appendix, will confirm our contention
that this Act requires banks to copy and to retain for a
period of from, two to five years every single piece of
paper that is submitted into the American domestic banking
system in any formal sense, including such things as deposit
slips, withdrawal slips, and other advices to the bank.
Now, the next —
QUESTION!

What page are you talking about?

MR. ANDERSON:

I'm referring to pages 38 and 39 of

the Appendix in the red-colored brief or in the blue-colored
brief.
QUESTION:

On the appendix to a brief?

MR. ANDERSON:

Yes.

That is the section of the

regulations that are set forth, both in the blue-colored and
in the red-covered brief.
The purposes of the Act are not in dispute.

The

main undisputed purpose of the Bank Secrecy Act was to aid
in the detection of what the government calls white-collar
crime, and the government has repeatedly describe the Act
in that language —
QUESTION: Could I ask you what the bank's policy
is, anyway, aside from regulations, with respect to keeping
these documents?
MR. ANDERSON: With respect to copying of documents
the bank practice, as alleged in the District Court, uncontro

13
verted, varies very widely.

Some banks keep an enormous

number of records for a short time, other banks keep a small
number of records for a long time, and there are all numerous
in-between positions occupied by the bank.
The uncontroverted evidence in the District Court
was that the Bank of America, as an example, which is commonly
regarded as America's largest bank, did not keep more than
half of the newly prescribed documents; for example, did not
keep checks for a period of two years, did not keep various
other documents for five years, and so forth.
QUESTION;

Aren't checks microfilmed routinely in

major banks, like Bank of America?
MR. ANDERSON;

Mr. Justice Powell, I think that was

the question Mr. Justice White was just asking, and the
evidence in the District Court was that the practice varied
enormously from bank to bank, and that, for example, in the
Bank of America, to which you refer and to which there was
some little evidence in the District Court, the evidence was
that, yes, they did microfilm some, checks, but they only
kept them for a period of from ten to thirty or forty days,
for their own convenience, and for purposes of dispute with
depositors with respect to payment amounts and so forth,
The regulations under this Act require the banks to
film, first of all, all checks, and second, to keep them for
a minimum of two years,

14
So that's the case with the Bank of America.
But I think the central point that has to be made
at this point is thiss

that absent these requirements of

recordkeeping, the practice among the banks of the United
States vary very widely, some keep —*
QUESTION:

Oh, is that true?

I thought you were

talking about California banks,
MR. ANDERSON;

No,

No, I'm referring to the

practice nationally; it is certainly the case in California,
also.
QUESTION;

But do you think, then, or are you stating

that the practice nationally is as varied as you indicated
just now for California?
MR, ANDERSON;

Mr. Justice Blackmun, my information

is that it is quite broad, and, as a matter of fact, one
of the
QUESTION:

But that isn’t in the record, is it?

MR. ANDERSON;

There's nothing in evidence on that

on the record, that is correct.
QUESTION;

The --

At least you surprised me by your answer.

I had assumed, as I think Mr, Justice Powell assumed, from
our part of the country, that all banks kept microfilms of
all checks.

Maybe California is different.

MR, ANDERSON:
case.

That is not — that is simply not the

As a matter of fact, one of the primary reasons for this

15

legislation given by the government at. the time it was being
proposed was that banks did not keep the records, and therefore
they found it difficult when subpoenaing records in the
investigation of certain alleged crimes to obtain the record
in question.

And that was part of the purpose or motivation

for this.
QUESTION:

Now, you said a little while ago that

the Bank of America kept microfilm of some checks.

How did

they distinguish between those they kept and those -they do
not keep?
MR. ANDERSON:
Blackmun.

No, I may have misspoke, Mr. Justice

I believe I said that they keep microfilms of

checks for a short period of time, ranging from ten to thirtysome-odd days.

There is an affidavit in the appendix

describing the Bank of America's practice on this point, as
an example.

And it's cited in our brief.

QUESTION:

Well, does the Bank of America keep

the original check for a longer period of time than that?
MR. ANDERSON:

No.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the

practice, as I understand it, and as evidenced by an affidavit
uncontested in the record, is that they microfilm the check
and the original is returned to idle payor in the normal
course of banking operations.
QUESTION:
drawer gets the check

Oh, that's right, the drawer, sure, the

IS
QUESTION: And any checks they get in, drawn on some
other bank, they send on.
MR, ANDERSON:

Yes,

They’re returned to the bank

on which it 'was drawn —
QUESTION:

But they do keep microfilms of those

for a short time?
MR. ANDERSON: Yes, that's correct.

That's right.

All checks.
QUESTION: So the question is whether it's really ~~
whether it's reasonable to have them keep it as long as this
regulation would have them do?
MR. ANDERSON:

No, I don't think

I think there's

a substantial difference, legal difference between a
compulsion to keep checks under order of lav/, as under a
statute, and the records or checks that are kept in the
ordinary course of banking business for the bank's own
purposes.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. ANDERSON:

And secondly, although we've talked

mainly about checks, I again respectfully invite the Court's
attention to that exhaustive list of documents which are
required to be kept, and v/hich are listed on pages 38 and 39
of the appendix in either the red or the blue-colored brief.
Now, as I have said, the undisputed —
QUESTION:

May I ask, assuming it's all as onerous

17

as you suggest to require the banks to do this, what is the
bearing of that on the issue we have to decide?
MR, ANDERSON:

Well, first of all, that turns to the

real question, which are our basic legal objections, the
recordkeeping, of course, is —
QUESTION:

Well, now, don’t get to it if you're

not ready to yet.
MR* ANDERSON:-

Well, I'm watching the time, because

we have a good argument, Mr, Justice Brennan.
QUESTION:

Yes,

MR. ANDERSON:

Let me move to that, because I do

think it bears some discussion here.
The recordkeeping is, in our judgment, unconstitu~
tional for three rather specific reasons:
First of all, in a quick summary, an analysis of
those cases which this Court has considered dealing with
compulsori’' or required recordkeeping will show that they
have been an aid of a specific legislative, to use a broader
word, national goal.
For example, Wage and Hour laws, Emergency Price
Regulation, or the tax laws are classic examples in which
there’s a specific congressional purpose, i iri which the
Congress has approved recordkeeping.

Recognising, I would

suppose, that the recordkeeping as such imposes some burden
on the citizenry? so the question always, in looking at the

18

statute, iss

does this recordkeeping requirement commensurate

with -fche legislative objective?
Here, the Court will respectfully note, that this
is not in aid of any specific congressional goal or any
congressional policy, it is in aid of all government policy;
criminal, civil, tax, regulatory, investigating or proceeding,
which presumably means administrative rule-making»
It is —
QUESTION:

What is the argument — what constitutional

provision is violated if it falls under that first attack
that you make?
MR. ANDERSON:

I think it's violated in two specific

instances, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
First of all, it renoves the ability of this Court
to weigh the recordkeeping against a specific government
need.

The re fore, —
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but what provision of

the Constitution does that violate?
MR. ANDERSON: Well, there is a requirement beginning
with the first recordkeeping case of consequence, Morton Salt
vs. the United States, in which the Court said that you can
be required to keep records, providing that it is reasonable
and they bear some reasonable relation to a legitimate
congressional or government goal.
Nov/, I submit to this Court there is --

19
QUESTION; Till at is that, a clue process argument?
MR. ANDERSON;

No, that's the Fourth Amendment.

QUESTION; That's connected with your Fourth
Amendment.
MR. ANDERSON; That is correct.
QUESTION;

That is correct.

So it isn't separate from what you're

going to get to, namely, the Fourth Amendment —
MR. ANDERSON;
it.

I think, Mr. Justice White, I am at

I think I have gotten to it by coming to this —
QUESTION;

Yes, you are.

So you are going to

end up with one constitutional objection?
MR. ANDERSON: Well, it is a Fourth Amendment
objection, that is correct.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ANDERSON; But it refers both to the record­
keeping and the reporting.
If I may .return to the question Mr. Justice
Rehnquist raised with respect to what's wrong with that kind
of recordkeeping as such.
the Congress has said:

I submit to the Court that when

our objective is all-purpose, namely,

all government business, criminal, civil, regulatory, and.
otherwisej and you cannot weigh that against the recordkeeping
objection, that is no way that you can follow the test or
the benchmark given in the Morton Salt case, namely, that
has some reasonable relationship.

20

Because, for example, if Congress were to pass a
new criminal statute

next year, you wouldn't know what it

was and you wouldn't be able to equate it against the record­
keeping obligation which is imposed today»
Mow, the second thing, which I believe to be more
serious, is -that an analysis of the recordkeeping cases
approved by this Court would show that they serve one of two
purposes:
keeper.

either for the purpose of regulating the recordA classic example would be a requirement that

employers report wages and hours paid, so that the Wage and
Hour law could be enforced — labor law could be enforced.
Price control is another example in which the
vendor is required to indicate what prices he's charging for
his items.

These are essential to regulate the record-

keeper.
The second category, which this Court has considered,
have been that kind of recordkeeping required to regulate a
particular business.
Tito examples:

firearms dealers, in which there is a

requirement that the record be kept for the purpose of
regulating that particular business, which is deemed by the
Congress to be dangerous, or to have some inport beyond -the
normal sale of wares.
Another example would be the sale of dangerous
drugs, in which there is a recordkeeping requirement. Again,

21
because the nature of the business is such that it seems to
call for this kind of recordkeeping.
Here# the recordkeeping# by the statement of the
Congress and by the governraeiit's own admission# has absolutely
nothing to do with the regulation of the recordkeeper.

It

has nothing to do with the regulation of America’s financial
institutions.
It is, by its own design# an enlistment of those
institutions for the purposes of monitoring the people with
whom those institutions deal.
QUESTION: Well# how about the IRS requirement# that
you notify the government of everybody you've paid dividends
to, and that sort of thing?
MR. ANDERSON:

Yes.

That# Mr. Justice Rehnquist#

is, in my judgment# a good example of a situation in which
it is necessary for the purposes of regulating the recordkeeper or# in this case, the reporting entity. Because those
dividends are presumably deductible as an expense by the
reporting entity; and secondly, and in this particular instance#
that is a classic example# at least in ray judgment# of a
reporting that is done in aid of a specific legislative
congressional objective# namely, the collection of internal
revenue.
And I don't think that this statute —
QUESTION:

But that's not -- you're mistaken# I

22

thinkf if you say that dividends are deductible by the
corporation; they're not*

And that's enlisting the services

of the corporation to monitor taxpayers, is it not?
MR. ANDERSON:

Yes.

I stand corrected, Mr. Justice

Stewart.
The second part of the argument, however, I think
holds? namely, that the reporting in that instance is in aid
of a specific government goal, which is the collection of
internal revenue.
QUESTION:

But it is not —
But it is enlisting a corporation —

MR. ANDERSON: To the extent that —
QUESTION:

to check on the tax returns of its

shareholders, is it not?
MR. ANDERSON:

I stand corrected.

it is not deductible, that is correct.
QUESTION:

To the extent

That is correct.

Unh-hunh.

MR. ANDERSON: The special

I find myself talking

about the recordkeeping, I wanted
QUESTION:

Do you think if that's all right, that

if the purpose is not to enforce one law but several, it
might even be more justified?
MR. ANDERSON: Well, Mr. Justice White, I think that
the difficulty with that is twofold.
First of all, in the case in which Congress has
compelled reporting or recordkeeping for the purpose of

23
enforcing a specific law , Congress has gone through the
process of deciding xdnether the recordkeeping in that case
is justified, warranted, and so on and so forth.

There’s

been some weighing of its utility in a pcxrticular instance.
Secondly, this Court, I would submit, would find it
extremely difficult to test the reasonableness of this
recordkeeping, when the objective is not against a particular
criminal statute, or not against a parti cx.il ar civil lav;, but
is in aid of all government interests, however defined.
The special evil, it seems to me, particularly
with respect to the recordkeeping is that there appear to be
any number of alternatives available, which are not explored,
and unlike the case, for example, the tax laws, or some of
the other civil regulatory lax<;s in which recordkeeping or

reporting by the entity involved appears to be absolutely
essential to its enforcement.

The sheer arrest records

that are available and, to some extent, quoted in our brief
xtfould suggest that this is not the only way in which the
criminal and civil and regulatory laws of the United States
could be enforced.
They happen to be, at least in our judgment,
essential to those other laws, but not in this case.
QUESTION;

Mr. .Anderson, in the colloquy betxveen

you and Mr. Justice Stewart, does this imply that in so far
as these recordkeeping requirements are an aid of the Internal

24

Revenue laws, you don't object to them?
MR. ANDERSON;

No, I object to the recordkeeping,

because I believe *—* excuse me, I see that my time has ~
QUESTION;

No, I know.

It extends to more than just

tax, but among those tilings that you recited was tax.
MR. ANDERSON; That is correct.
QUESTION; Well, do you suggest that even to that
extent this requirement is invalid?
MR. ANDERSON;

I suggest it's invalid, not because

it's not specifically related to a purpose, but for the
other reasons that I mentioned? namely, that there is no way,
given the breadth of the obligation, that this Court can
perform its historic function of testing whether that record­
keeping obligation is reasonable, under the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION:

Your objection seems to go to the fact

that the statute has many objectives and targets, instead of
just one, and perhaps your colleague will enlarge on that a
little bit, if he's covering some of those points.
MR. ANDERSON;

Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

25
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES C, MARSON, ESQ.,
OR BEHALF OF FORTNEY H. STARK, JR,, ET AL.
MR. MARSON;

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice.

And may it please the Court;
I would be happy to enlarge on that point.
There is one essential difference between all of the
recordkeeping and. reporting statutes mentioned so far in
the Bank Secrecy Act, and that is that this one is in aid
of criminal law enforcement, and all the others are in aid
of civil law enforcement.
Perhaps, first, I should say —
QUESTION;

Well, doesn't the dividend reporting

aid, isn't that in aid of criminal?

What if a man receives

a lot of dividends and never reports them, deliberately?
MR. MARSON:

It can be tangentially useful to the

criminal law.
QUESTION:
MR. MARSON;

I'd say I think it's pretty direct.
But its basic purpose is to enforce

the civil tax.
In Shapiro vs. Thompson, for example, the required
records were priracirily in aid of the civil regulatory
system.

In Shapiro they were used for a criminal purpose.

But they were primarily in aid of a civil system.
In United States vs» Sullivan, in 1927, this Court
held that one could not refuse to give a tax return on the

26

grounds of self-incrimination, because its purpose was to
collect -**- it was neutral, it was directed to the population
at large, its purpose was to collect civil information for
the tax.
QUESTION:

Don't you think the Social Security

reporting requirements have more than one purpose?
MR. MARSON: Certainly they do, but not a primarily
and almost exclusively criminal one, no.
If this Court permits reports and records to be
kept and compelled in aid of the enforcement of the criminal
law, it abolishes its supervisorial duty over subpoenas and
summonses, and the power of the government to compel documents
from anybody,
QUESTION: What about those reporting requirements
withtarespect to sale of firearms and the like?
MR. MARSON;

Well, that's an example of the regula­

tion, both of the seller and of the buyer.

My interpretation

of what Mr. Anderson — the categories in which Mr. Anderson
put these previously existing laws, where *— is a little bit
different, I would say that all of these preexisting laws
regulate other than the recordkeeper the recordkeeper's
customer, or the recordkeeper's customer’s tax liability,
for

example, in his relationship to the recordkeeper.
The Donaldson case is a good example, where they

subpoenaed the record of the employee's former employer and

27
the former employer’s accountant in order to check on the
tax liability of the employee.
That was a record kept by the recordkeeper, which
was relevant to tax liability of the subject of the record,
but only out of the relationship between the two.
Whereas the record kept of Mr. Justice Brennan’s
hypothetical $15,000 check is a record directed to the
relationship between him and him and some other party, of
whom criminality may be suspected.
I think I should back up a little bit and identify
the somewhat —
QUESTION:

Well, it might also tend to produce some

evidence of criminality on the part of the person who was
going into a bank and buying $20,000 worth of drafts on a
Swiss — payable in a Swiss bank every week, wouldn't it?
MR. MARSON:

It might tend to do that.

Any record­

keeping requirement might tend in some cases to evidence
criminality.

But one which is for, quote, "the purpose",

end quote — and I'm quoting the government’s brief — of
enforcing the criminal lax*; is a wholly different animal than
one which is for the primary purpose of enforcing the civil
lax-;, and has tangential criminal consequences.
The government doesn't disagree that compelling a
report, as opposed to — or the keeping of a record is a
search and seisure governed by the Fourth Amendment.

28

It doesn't disagree that it is the criminal law
for which these reports are largely compelled.

But it does

not explain why the warrant requirement has no application
here, why there is no judicial supervision whatsoever over
these reports.

It doesn't explain why it has abolished not

only the requirement of probable cause, but even —
QUESTION: What standing have you got to object to
that?
MR. MARSON:

To which?

I'm afraid I don’t under you, sir.
QUESTION:
enforce

Well, the warrant requirement to

you're saying the warrant requirement would apply

in the enforcement of the criminal law against somebody
else.

And this just runs around the warrant requirement,
MR. MARSON:

Now, I think I should inform the Court

as to who it is that I represent here.

I represent Congressman

Stark, a bank customer, other foreign and domestic bank
customers, the Security National Bank, and the American Civil
Liberties Union.
QUESTION:

So you're really objecting to the bank

keeping records of your affairs, of your clients' affairs?
MR. MARSON:
or for

Yes.

1 also represent one foreign —

foreign investors who must affirmatively report their

holdings and their transactions across the border.
And analytically, we feel that the foreign and

29

domestic reporting requirements are —
QUESTION:

So you're arguing the reporting require­

ments more than the recordkeeping?
MR. MARSON:

We're arguing them both.

Frankly, from

a constitutional point of view, we think the recordkeeping
requirements are a little more frightful even than the
reporting requirements.
QUESTION: They may be frightful, but I don't know
about — what about the Fourth Amendment?
MR. MAESON:
QUESTION;

Well, let me ~
You may

you, as the bank's customer,

are objecting to the bank having to keep records?
MR. MARSONs

I, as a lawyer representing clients

x*;ho must report, object to the reports.

I, as representing

bank customers whose records are kept under the coercion of
the Act, object to the keeping of the records.
. QUESTION:
MR. MARSON:

Unh-hunh.
Because they violate the Fourth

Amendment, the Fourth and Fifth Amendments combined, and •—
QUESTION: Well, don't you think a bank has a right
to keep a record that will protect itself in case of a suit?
MR. MARSON: Certainly it does, and it already does
that —
QUESTION: Well, why can't it keep ’those reports?
MR. MARSON:

It does, and we have no complaint

30

directed to any record which a bank keeps in its own business
judgment.
QUESTION: Well,. I -thought you said you objected to
the keeping of the records.
MR. MARSON: We do when it is coerced by the govern­
ment and not relevate to -idle business purposes of the bank,
then and only then.
QUESTION:
relevancy?

Do we have to have both, coercion and

Because I can find relevancy without any

problem.
MR. MARSON:

If but for the Act the record would not

be made or kept, then we object to it.
QUESTION:

On what grounds?

MR, MARSON: Because the bank acts as agent of
the government in doing that, because it's irrelevant to the
regulatory purpose, and because it constitutes a search.
QUESTION:

That's the reason for the reports, but

the bank might not turn the reports over.
MR, MARSON; The bank, as a matter of practice —
QUESTION: Well, if a bank has been keeping reports
for the last 75 years, would you still have a case?
MRo MARSON:

Yes, we would, because the banks

QUESTION: Because you just found out.
MRo MARSON:

No,

No.

Because the banks are not

keeping as many records as long as the Bank Secrecy Act coerces

31

them to do.
QUESTION: Well, suppose they had been?
MR. MARSON:

We have no objection to records kept

in the ordinary course of business, none at all.

These are

not kept in the ordinary course of business, they're kept under
the coercion of the Act, the Act was passed for the purpose
of coercing the
QUESTION: So you object to the keeping of the
reports, because they are given over to the government, that's
your point, isn't it?
MR. MARSON:
QUESTION:

No.

It — it's one of our points.

Well, if you win on that, would you give

up the other one?
MR. MARSON:

If we win, we'll give up the ones

we don't need, yes.
QUESTION: Right.
[Laughter. ]
MR. MARSON; We object only to the record that
wouldn't be there but for the Act, not for the record that
would be there in the exercise of the business judgment of
the bank.

For example, to protect itself from suit? for

example, to verify a statement that came back to the customer.
Those we have no problem with.
Only when we pass the point of business judgment
arid enter the area of records not made or kept but for the Act

32

do we have a consfcituional objection.
We feel that those — that that enters the area of
agency, that once the bank passes out of its business and
regulatory function and enters into its unwilling function as
keeping records as essentially a surveillance mechanism for
the government, then they're acting in an agency role.
The government's only answer to that is to quote
Mr. Justice White's opinion in United States vs. White, and
say it's just like a willing informant receiving information
from a willing confidant and turning it over to the
government.

We think that analogy has no merit at all.

In the first place, the banks here, as -their
presence in court testifies, are not willing informants to
the government.

They object to the requirements.

They go

to jail if they don't fulfill it.
In the second, it is by no means voluntary for the
bank customer to deal with the bank, in the sense it has for
Mr. Hoffa to deal with the informant or Mr, VJhite to deal
with the informant in those two decisions.
The government basically says that if you know
these people are agencies of the government, something not
known in Hofffa and White, your choice is to keep dealing with
them and we'll call that voluntary, or to give up banking and,
for that matter, financial institutions entirely.

You may

carry your cash to everybody you owe money to, even if it's

33

the other end of the country, or you may deal voluntarily
with the agent, the bank*
We think that that distorts the meaning of the
term "voluntary" beyond all recognition.

And that is the

only answer the government has to our theory, that when a
bank makes or keeps a record it would not otherwise make or
keep in its business judgment, it acts as an agent of the
government.
If it does that, then, analytically, there is no
difference between the required reports and the required
records, because the search of the records has to be measured
as of the time the agent of the government, i.e., the bank,
acts and copies the record.
Now, there is solid precedent, aside from this
agency theory, for equating the constitutional effects of
the recordkeeping and the reporting.
It's found in Marchetti vs. United States.

There

the Court, on rehearing, asked the parties to brief the
question of the effects of Shapiro vs. United States, and the
government repeatedly insists in its brief that there was no
application to Marchetti of Shapi.ro, because Shapiro involved
records and Marchetti involved reports.
In footnote 14 of Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion in
that case, he said the Court finds no meaningful distinction
between the two.

34

Mow, in Shapiro, a subpoena was issued for the
records there were required to be kept, issued to a party
who had an adversary interest in contesting that subpoena.
Here the situation is worse, because the subpoena
issues to a bank that has no such adversary interest»

The

bank, as a matter of general practice, frequently, especially
in violation of its higher level policy by lower level employees,
gives law enforcement what they ask for without a summons.
Even if they get a summons, they put it in -the
file and turn the material over.
The government does not deny these facts.

The

legislative history makes them perfectly plain»...
People simply do not get a chance to contest
subpoenas directed to their bank accounts in the ordinary
course of events.

Even if they do, the government's reading

of Couch and Donaldson would give no standing to the parties
to assert Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, should that
subpoena ever be discovered by them in time to litigate it.
Under our reading, of course, the customer does have
Fourth and Fifth Amendment interests in records not otherwise
made or kept in the business judgment of the bank, and would,
under Couch and Donaldson, have standing to object.
But even that would not avail the customer of very
much.
Let’s suppose that I am prosecuted on the basis of

35
a copy of a check subpoenaed from ray bank. The government says,
well, it will be time enough for you to raise your Fourth
and Fifth Amendment objections when you are prosecuted on the
basis of the check.
What would I have to prove?
I would have to prove that in the ordinary business
practice of my bank, the check would not have been copied,
and it was but for the Act that the check was copied.
Mow, since ordinary business practice stops in
July 1, 1972, when these regulations went into effect, and
since they went into effect because of rapid technological
change, as the years go by, Ida at burden of proof changes from
very difficult, which it is now, to impossible, which it will
be in a few years.
Next, the government says, well, you'll have time
enough to raise these objections when you're prosecuted or
otherwise proceeded against without paying any attention to
the relief we ask here.

If I successfully suppress that check,

all I get is the suppression of one check.
We ask here for the invalidation of the 7\ct.
But finally, and most important, when the government
says that it is time enough when the subpoena is served on
your bank, should you be lucky enough to find out about it,
and litigate it, to litigate these questions? it ignores the
difference between the Fourth Amendment and' the exclusionary

36

rule.
As Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc pointed out quite correctly
in his opinion for the Court in u. S. v. Robinson only last
month:

virtually all of this Court's Fourth Amendment

jurisprudence has arisen since Weeks vs. United States, and
in the context of the exclusionary rule.
This is one of the rare and happy cases in which
you have innocent parties before you asking for the protection
of privacy afforded by the Fourth Amendment.
The government’s saying that we’re premature in
this case because we haven’t been proceeded against ignores
the fact -that the Fourth Amendment protects the innocent as
well as the guilty# to invert an old phrase; and ignores the
fact that the Fourth Amendment protects privacy not guilty
secrets»
And so we’re not prematuring here, even assuming
that we get notice of a subpoena of our bank account, even
assuming we could litigate all these questions under Couch
and Donaldson, now is the time, perhaps the only time, in
which these issues can be decided.
Finally, there is a connection between the Fourth
and. Fifth Amendments, which makes the separation of them by
the government, we think, indefensible in the case.
This Court has not had a majority for what Boyd. vs.
United States means, with respect to the intimate connection

37
between the two amendments since Boyd was decided in 1886.
Mr* Justice Marshall’s exploration of the several
different interpretations of that intimate relationship in
his dissent in the Couch case throws some light on the issues
here.
But I think, to quote Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
when he was writing for the Court in Frank vs. Maryland,
later overruled, and some excellent dictum.

He said:

It is not necessary to accept any particular theory of the
interrelationship of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to
understand what lies, not at its periphery but at its core,
self-protection? self-protection of a party from being
compelled to create and produce evidence against himself.
The central purpose, the purpose, as the government
calls it, of the Bank Secrecy Act is to force private
citizens to create and deliver to the government, or hold
for its later obtaining by means of judicial process or
otherwise, evidence of a crime, their own or someone else’s.
Nov?, if the government told everybody, told private
citizens to keep watch on their neighbor, record their
comings and goings, report anything unusual, that would be
different from this case only in the fact that they were
speaking to private citizens, not regulated industry.
The government here argues that the difference is
constitutionally critical because it has plenary, regulatory

33

power over banks, it can order banks for purposes foreign
to that power to keep watch over its customers and their
relation with still other fourth parties, in order to enforce
the criminal law.
QUESTION;

Mr. Marson, are you now arguing your

challenge to the reporting regulations as well as to the
recordings, recordkeeping regulations?
MR» MARSON:

Yes.

In our view they1 re

constitutionally indistinguishable, the reporting requirements
are easier because they're an outright seizure.
QUESTION; Well, have any of your clients engaged in
transactions which they would be required to report, or
have they had the time to file a complaint?
MR. MARSONs They alleged, at the time of the filing
of the complaint, which was a few weeks before the effective
Sate of the Act, that they had done so in the recent past and
would do so in the immediate future; and therefore were under
the effect of the regulation.
I have four clients;
Durell.

Lieberman, Harwood, Bruer, and

All of whom are required to report their foreign

holdings.
Lieberman sends monetary instruments in excess of
$5,000 across the borader.

Lieberman and the three others

all have financial interest in or signature authority over
foreign bank accounts.

As such, they are required affirmatively

39

to report those to the government, and have been doing so
because the District Court declined to enjoin that portion
of the Act.
QUESTIONS

Are you the Marson who is one of the

parties to this case?
MR. MARSONs

Yes, I am.

It was easier to verify

the complaint that way.
QUESTION:
MR. MARSON:

Unh-huhh.
Finally, I might mention a word before

my first section of time runs out, about the American Civil
Liberties Union.
The government is willing to agree that we have a
right to protect our membership list.

It is willing to

agree that this case creates a membership list; it is willing
to agree that it frequently, for law enforcement purposes,
has access to bank records without any process at all.
It’s willing to agree that even if it serves process, that
process usually is not learned about by the customer.

And

still it says that we are prematurely here, that vie must
again wait for some summons or subpoena to be served upon us.
We submit that a nationwide, known scheme of the
collection of membership lists, in the hands of a third party,
with no instinct or interest in litigating is too much of an
exposure of that membership list to be tolerated under the
First Amendment.

40
The D. C. Circuit’s decision in Uni.ted States Service'
men’s Fund turns on exactly that point.

It was the lack of a

litigative interest in the third party who was holding the
record that gave the United Stafces_ Servicemen's Fund standing
to intervene to seek the sort of equitable relief that we
seek here.
If it please the Court# if there are no further
questions# I’ll save the rest of ray time for rebuttal,
QUESTION:

Do you know of any other organisation

in the country that couldn't also be a party?
MR, MARSON: Hie organization would have to be of the
type that was controversial and whose members could reasonably
plead that they could expect retaliation or exposure.

It

would have to come under the rules set forth in# for example#
NAACP vs, Alabama.
QUESTION:

So any group would be able to come in,

MR. MARSON: Any group who had a reasonable interest
in the privacy of its membership list would? any group who
didn't care about the maintenance of that privacy and didn't
care because it wouldn’t affect First Amendment rights could
not,
QUESTION:

Well# in the Civil Liberties Union# if

Member Joe Doakes goes in and cashes his bonds and gets a
check for $15#000, how does he become

gat on the list as

a member of the American Civil Liberties Union by cashing a

41
check?
MR. MARS ON;

Because that check goes through our

account,, and the bank makes pictures of our account.
QUESTION;

No, no.

MR. MARSON:

Oh.

No, no.

This is his own check.

Well, his own bank takes a picture

of his check and it’s written out to the American Civil
Libe rties Union.
QUESTION; Well, how does the American Civil Liberties
Union have anything to do with that?
MR. MARSON; Because he knows that his own bank is
going to keep a record of the fact that he paid money to the
American Civil Liberties Union.
QUESTION;

Suppose the man cashes a check for

$15,000 from Babies United, payable to him, and he’s a member
of the American Civil Liberties Union.

Does the American

Civil Liberties Union have a right to bring an action to
stop that?
MR. MARSON:

No.

Only checks that illustrate on

their face that they are payable to us.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Mr. Wallace.

Very well, Mr. Marson.

42
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF GEORGE P. SHULTZ , SECRETARY
OF THE TREASURY, ET AL.
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Pi ease the Courts
The so-called Bank Secrecy Act ■*— oh, I should say
before I begin that I asked the Clerk to distribute a little
Xerox copy of the ~ because the regulations as they're
reproduced in the Appendix to our Jurisdictional Statement
and in the Appendices to the California Bankers Association
brief omitted some intervening changes, which made them
inaccurate in minor respects that don't affect the argument in
this case? principally 103.35 is the one -that can't really be
reconstructed without the aid of this.
But with these in your hands, along with the others,
it. will be possible to see what all of the regulations
currently are.

They were amended in both December of 1S72

and January of 1973, and the current regulations are reprinted
in the Code of Federal Regulations.
The Act was enacted by Congress in 1970, following
extensive and detailed hearings concerning the widespread use
made by persons in the United States of foreign bank accounts,
in Bank Secrecy jurisdictions, for the purpose of concealing
violations of United States tax, regulatory and criminal laws,
or concealing the fruits of such violations.

And concerning

43

the difficulties in enforcing federal tax, regulatory and
criminal laws that had been caused by the failure of some
domestic banks and other financial institutions to keep
adequate records of checking account transactions and of
the identity of their customers,,
The purpose of the Act is to males available greater
evidence of financial transactions in order to deter the use
of 'the channels of commerce for illicit purposes, or, in the
words of the Senate Report, in order to reduce the incidence
of white-collar crime, unquote.
Title I and II of the Act, and their implementing
regulations were challenged in this case.

Title I is the

recordkeeping provision, and Title II are the reporting
provisions, which basically are in two parts for purposes of
our concerns here:

reports of domestic currency transactions,

and reports of foreign financial transactions.
The Act's provisions are not self-executing, but
are designed to be implemented by Treasury regulations, and
Congress made clear its intention that those regulations
were to focus both the recordkeeping and the reporting
requirements on financial information having a, in the phrase
of both the House Committee Report and in the Act itself, a
high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax o.r regulatory
investigations or proceedings.
And by so focusing the requirements to avoid undue

44

burdens on the free flow of domestic and international
commerce and finance.
After the Act's passage, in keeping with this
congressional purpose, a Treasury Department task force under­
took detailed study, in consultation with representatives of
financial institutions, of trade associations, and of
government agencies, to determine the specific categories of
records and reports which should be required to implement
the Act.
And the regulations emanated from rule-making
proceedings involving these task force studies, they were
first adopted in April of 1972, and then were amended in
December of that year and in January of 1973, after further
comment in rule-making proceedings and also in light of
further Senate hearings on proposed amendments to the Act
that were conducted in August of 1972, and that is why there
are sometimes citations to Senate hearings which discuss the
regulations that have already been developed under the Act.
Those proposed amendments had to do with proposals
to restrict access to the record, which Congress has not
enacted, but the amendments to the regulations do specify
restrictions on access by others in the government.
The original legislative history made it clear that
the recordkeeping provisions did not expand access, from what
it was under established legal process.

45
Turning first to the recordkeeping provisions of
Title I as implemented by the regulations, and these provisions
were upheld by the District Court, these require financial
institutions in the United States to record the identities
of their account holders, and require banks to make, to
maintain microfilm or other records of checks drawn on them..
These are requirements with respeGt to "on-us" checks only,
for sums in excess of $100.
And then there are, in addition to checks for $100
or less, there are other exceptions developed, and these are
all in the amended regulations, that are listed on page 22
of the brief.

This is our brief for the Appellees.

There are a number of briefs in the case, as you know.
In the government brief as Appellee, on page 22,
we summarise the other exceptions:
checks, and others.

dividend checks and payroll

So long as they are drawn on an account

expected to average at least 100 checks per month.
Altogether, then, those exceptions, coupled with
the exception for all checks of $100 or less, add up to a
very substantial exception to the microfilming requirements
which have been the main focus of the complainants' contentions
in the case.
The additional
QUESTION:

Of course it's been represented, as you

know, that as a practical matter that exception is virtually

46

meaningless because microfilming equipment can’t distinguish
between a check under a hundred dollars and a check over a
hundred dollars, and that the manpower required to separate
them would not be worth the effort, and that, therefore, as
a practical matter, it's a meaningless distinction — a
meaningless exemption, if you will.
And I personally don’t know the facts about
that, is there anything in the record about it?
MR. WALLACE:

There’s relatively little in the

record that bears on this, these amendments were made to the
regulations after the District Court decision in this case.
There is some testimony in the hearings that we
referred to, the congressional hearings that we referred to
in our brief, in which some representatives of banking
institutions made suggestions that indicated that it would be
possible ““ in one instance that it would be possible by
machine to make, such separations.
QUESTION:
'61

Well, certainly it would be possible to
*

do, I mean a human being could easily do it, but you ■— the
representation is that that would add so much expense, thafc
it's therefore, as a practical matter, cheaper to microfilm
them all.
Nobody could quarrel with the proposition that it's
possible.
QUESTION: Well, with the cost of living the way it

47
is today, you sure shouldn't have many $.100 checks.
I mean, unless you’re going to buy a pack of
cigarettes or something!
MR. WALLACES

The prevalent practice has been for

banks to microfilm all of their checks, and of course, for
banks that have been doing that, even though they have not
been retaining those microfilms as long as is required under
the regulations —
QUESTION: That's two years.
MR. WALLACE;

— the

it's five years for this

particular aspect of it.
QUESTION; Five?
MR, WALLACE;

It's two years in which to reconstruct

entries into demand, accounts in the bank.

But for the

microfilming of "on-us" checks, it’s five years.
The hearings did bring out that most banks had been
microfiIraning their checks, although the period for which
they retained them had varied a great deal.

And certainly

banks that have been microfilming all of their checks would
be likely to retain all of their checks for the five-year
period rather than have to sort out the microfilms afterwards.
The regulations developing the exceptions were
developed in consultation, in light of comments by members of
the industry; and while there’s nothing in public record,
the Treasury Department did include the exception in response

43
to industry's suggestions that this would be useful and in
keeping with the congressional purpose not to cause any
unnecessary burdens on the flow of commerce that won't
substantially contribute to the purposes of the Act.
There’s nothing in the record about what banks are
doing since the adoption of the regulations, the Treasury
Department has some information, however, that would give us
a basis for introducing evidence in a proper proceeding,
but this is a useful exception for some institutions.

And

that it's an exception that they're able to take advantage
of.
QUESTION:

May I ask you a question, I think it's

in the .record somex^here, but I can't put my finger on it.
Does this Act draw the line with respect to certainsised banks?
MR. WALLACE:

It does not, with respect to any of

these requirements.
QUESTION:

How about the regulations in the Act?

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Neither do the regulations.

You mean it applies as equally to a

$10 million bank in a small town as it would to a $10 billion
bank?
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

Of course it doesn't

specify that microfilm has to be the process by which a copy
of the check is retained.

The hearings indicated that it was

43
only the largest institutions that were getting away from
microfilming, not -the smaller ones.
microfilming process.

They were using the

That was what the evidence before

Congress appeared to indicate.
QUESTION;

Well, are you saying a small bank

would use something other than microfilm?
MR. WALLACE;

Well, if it chose to, it could, under

the regulations. The regulations don't specify the form in
which copies are to be maintained, but the practice of small
banks is to use microfilm.
And the main reason for the need for the record­
keeping requirements brought out in the hearing was that a
few of the largest banks in the country had decided not to
engage in the pervasive photocopying that was common practice
in the industry, and there were problems about periods of
retention.
There was a great deal of testimony about the need
and the usefulness of bank records in aiding investigations,
both to determine tax liability; there was testimony by
Internal Revenue agents; there was testimony by United States
Attorneys, indicating in detail various, sometimes quite
intricate criminal schemes that had been investigated
through the use of the bank records, and problems that they
ran into when bank records were not available.
And there was testimony by the Assistant Attorney

50

General in charge of the Criminal Division,, indicating the
importance of having such records available for use in
evidence in trials, rather than relying on oral testimony»
QUESTION:

This may be irrelevant, but do the banks

get any compensation for this service through some federal
agency that may involve considerable time and personnel and
everything else they have to do?
MR. WALLACE:

There is no compensation provided

in the Act or the regulations, Your Honor.
The findings made by the congressional committees
were that these requirements would not impose an undue
burden, indeed, that there would not be a very substantial
burden imposed on most banks at all, because they already made
copies of these records for their own purposes, and extending
the period in which they retained them, considering the
easy —
QUESTION;

I was just thinking that if they're

all stored in warehouses, digging them out, locating them,
providing copies, this must be involving expense.
MR. WALLACE:

There are expenses.

There was

testimony in idle hearings about the expenses, and, as a
matter of fact, the testimony was that the cost had been
estimated to range between one-half mill and one-and-a-half
mills per check; a mill being a tenth of a cent.
And the Senate Committee specifically said the cost

51
of 'microfilming had been estimated in the hearings to range
between one-half of a mill and one-and-a-half mills per check,
a cost that does not appear to be unduly onerous compared
to the normal service charge of ten cents per check.
And a cost which is —
QUESTION;
involved, isn’t there?

But there's more expense than that
It’s not merely the microfilm, there's

the expense of storing for this length of time, the expense
of locating what some government agency may want the bank
to show up, and I expect making copies of what it is the
government may want.
MR. WALLACE;

Well, the recordkeeping requirements

don't impose any additional requirements on the bank with
respect to access to such records as they have, and there
wasn’t a complete cost breakdown.

There was testimony in the

hearings by representatives of the banking industry that the
cost would not be unduly onerous, and the costs are tax
deductible.
We have a quotation in our brief on that, precise
point.
QUESTION;

One could assume, I suppose, in a

capitalistic system, that whatever the costs of doing
business are, they will be paid for by -the bank’s customers
ultimately, and the bank will continue to make what profit it
can make in a competitive economy.

Isn’t that about right?

52

HR. WALLACE;

I would presume so, although ‘there's

no indication that anyone has raised their service cost from
ten cents to ten~and~a-half cents "a check.
QUESTION:

Well, maybe they've been able to

economize somewhere else.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Yes, they may have.

To go to the next point, the banks get

nothing for this, what's the penalty if they don't comply?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, there are provisions for civil

penalties, —

Civil penalties.

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.
This is a regulation imposed by Congress on them, as

something they have to meet in order to engage in their
enterprise in interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

And I guess the answer is, if they don't

want to do it, they can go out of business.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that's right.

Congress con­

cluded that in regulating this industry, which provides many
opportunities for evasion of other legal requirements, if
adequate records are not kept of the identities of customers
and what has occurred in their accounts, so that they will be
available when legitimate investigatory needs are shown,
that this is part of the burden to be borne as a good citizen.

QUESTION:

Do you think they could put that on any

other business, other than the banking business?

order to implement various federal programs.

Internal Revenue, for example.

MR. WALLACE;

I'm talking about these provisions.

On the basis of what you say here, which is that you might
want to prosecute them.
MR. WALLACE:

these provisions are also needed to investigate whether
Internal Revenue has been paid adequately.
QUESTION:

But would you agree with what the

Petitioners said, that your whole thrust in your brief, and
I think that that's so many, you keep talking about
criminal.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, there was a great deal of

focus on criminal schemes and the use of secret accounts, to
conceal the fruits of criminal schemes.
QUESTION:
HR. WALLACE;

Secret accounts in domestic banks?
Secret accounts in foreign banks, and

getting it there through secret transactions in the United
States banks.

accurately identified.
QUESTION;

Wallace, that where you say your thrust is criminal, you
wave the Fifth Amendment flag, don't you?
MR. WALLACE;

Automatically?

Are you speaking of the privilege

against self-incrimination?
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. WALLACE;

Well, if someone is being required to

incriminate himself, and pleads the privilege, that question
is raised.

I don't think it's raised in this case.
QUESTION;

Well, the only pleading I could do at

that stage would be to cash ray check.
QUESTION;

Well, does the bank have any Fifth

Amendment privilege, Mr. Wallace?
MR. WALLACE;

Well, no, the banks are corporations

who don't have a Fifth Amendment privilege, and no one else
is being required to keep the record.
QUESTION:

I'm talking about poor old $100 man who's

got a check for $100.
MR. WALLACE;
QUESTION;

Well, if he —

He gives up all his rights when he puts

that check in the bank.

55
MR. WALLACE;

Well, I haven't said anything about

his giving up all his rights.

He's communicated to the bank

what that check communicates.
QUESTION:

And that’s all that he meant to

communicate — that’s the only person he meant to communicate
to, right?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, if he has the right to uphold

the confidentiality of that communication from disclosure,
that would arise, that question would arise when an attempt
was made to get the bank to disclose it.
As tills Court said in the Conch case, that there is
no such privilege.
QUESTION:

But he said —

MR. WALLACE:

That may be all he meant to

communicate if to, but the bank can be compelled to testify
as to its knowledge of what he communicated to them.
QUESTION:

Yes, but I don’t think — I don't think

that the Couch case said that the accountant that was given
these Internal Revenue materials was obliged to turn that
over to the government.
MR. WALLACE:

I don’t think that’s what it says.
Neither doss the Act.

The Act gives

the government no additional access to any records required
to be kept, no access —
QUESTION: •
MR. WALLACE:

Well, what makes —
~~ beyond the normal legal process of

56
a sxammons or a subpoena.
QUESTIO?!:

What about the reporting provisions?

MR. WALLACE;

Well, the reporting provisions are

something else, and I’ll turn to those .now with just, if I
may, one or two closing comments about the recordkeeping
provisions.
QUESTION s

Okay.

MR. WALLACE;

Fine.

So til at we won't need to return to

them, unless there are further questions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, I do have one more question

about the recordkeeping,provisions.
Do I get the impression from your argument that
there was at least some testimony before Congress to the
effect that banks were shifting away from retaining these
records?
The reason I ask is because my own experience in
private practice is just what Justice White and Justice
Powell intimated in their questions, -that I can't remember
ever having any trouble subpoenaing a check, check record
from a bank.

It seemed to me that in my own little locale

they kept them several years.
So, was this, in effect, an effort by Congress to
see that what had been an adequate voluntary system was
preserved, when there was an impetus to turn away from it?
MR* WALLACE:

That was the major thrust of it.

57

And that was the testimony,,

It. was just a very few of the

largest banks that had decided that it wasn’t worth their
while to photocopy everything and to keep these records as
long as they had in the past.
In fact, the House Committee Report said that most
banks would be virtually unaffected by this particular aspect
of the requirements, and that it was just a few sizable
ones, the Bank of America was particularly testified about.
That is correct, Your Honor.
So tiie principal thrust, as we understand it, of
the California Bankers Association argument, that this is an
undue burden, whether that’s stated as a Fourth or Fifth
Amendment objection, is hard for us to see why a recordkeeping
requirement is a search or seizure; but it seems to us now
it's to be more of a Fifth Amendment objection.
That is answered by the consideration, it seems
to us, that Congress gave to the needs that the government
had as the necessary and proper means of facilitating
enforcement of tax, regulatory and criminal laws.

This

would not be an undue burden, and I don’t, think this
congressional judgment has been shown by anything presented
in the record here not to be an entirely constitutional one.
The other objections that have been raised to the
requirements by the individuals, if I can just summarize our
position with respect to them quite briefly;

we don’t see

58
that there’s been any compulsion on the individual with
respect to the recordkeeping requirements that would form a
predicate for a Fifth Amendment objection, nor have any
of the individuals before the Court claimed that anything
required would tend to incriminate them, which is the
necessary predicate for a Fifth Amendment objection.
There is not basis in the legislative history or
purpose or anything that was developed in the course of
developing the regulations for belief that the government
was going to seek to get the membership lists of any particula
organisation, and therefore the First Amendment claim seems
to us to be too speculative for presentation to the Court
a fortiori, on the basis of this Court's decision last term
in Laird y. Tatum, since there isn't even any data-gafchering
by the government yet shown to be taking place in the
present case.
And data-gathering was involved in Laird by the
government in Laird v. Taturn, although no use of that data
for any improper purpose or likelihood of that use has been
shown.
The Fourth Amendment claim, it seems to me that
there's no search or seizure being made of the customer,
because the bank with whom he's doing business is required to
keep records of its financial transactions with him and with
otlier customers.

59
And to the extent that. it. could be said, and we
suggest some reasons why it may not be accurate to say so,
that the bank is operating as a government agent, it has
never been held by any court, to my knowledge, that the
Fourth Amendment is violated when the government keeps records
of its dealings with individuals.
QUESTION;

It's acting

or the private bank,

company is acting as a government agent when they withhold
taxes, social security, and so on.
MR. WALLACE;

Well, in the same sense, that is right.

And they are required to keep many records.
And the thrust of the argument of the individuals
here is that when they have dealings with the government,
and the government keeps records of ili os e transactions, that
the government has engaged in, assuming that the bank is acting
as an agent of the government that somehow raises the
Fourth Amendment violation.

To us that is merely the

government’s keeping of records, of information voluntarily
disclosed to the government.

You know, like someone doing

business with it.
We don’t really think the analogy of a government
agent is the accurate one here, but without that analogy
there’s no search or seizure with respect to the individual
at all here, since there's no access by the government,
provided by the Act, to the records that are required to be

60

kept.
Nov, the domestic currency transaction reporting
provisions of Title II, or the part of the Act that was
struck down by the District Court, this is actually the least
innovative feature of the Act, because, since 1945
financial institutions have been providing reports under the
Trading with the Enemy Act, and implementing regulations;
and also under Section 251 of the Revised Statutes, which
was another basis for those regulations.
Of essentially similar information, iuid these had
been of proven efficacy in the enforcement of the Internal
Revenue laws, Treasury report indicated, for exctmple, that
in 1957 and 1958, alone, 129 fraud cases had been developed,
involving — which led to the generation of $13.5 million in
additional taxes and penalties, based directly on information
derived from these reports»
And the congressional objective in providing for
such reporting requirements in the new Act was to make the
standards for such reports by the institutions more definite.
The hearings indicated that the criminal

use of financial

institutions had increased in recent years, and that there
was much testimony and findings in the committee report,
indicating that large amounts of cash are generated and have
to be concealed in illicit transactions, and also have to
be converted to assure the ultimate success of those trans-

61

actions into usable forms of credit.
And so these provisions and their implementing
regulations were included in the Act# and these regulations
require reports only by the financial institutions of these
transactions, not by any individuals; and only of currency
transactions in excess of $10,000# not commensurate with the
customary conduct of the business of an established customer
of the bank.
The information to be reported is summarised in
our brief# this time our brief as Appellants, on pages 14 and
15# in the text of the brief.
simple.

The information is relatively

And it's to be secured from the party to the

transaction# the other party to the transaction, by the bank#
as a condition of the bank’s engaging in such transaction.
This is again regulation of the activities of the
banks in commerce.
The District Court — the rationale of the District
Court in striking down -these provisions of the Act was # as
we’ve contended in detail in our brief# entirely hypothetical.
It was based on the speculation that it might be possible
to have implementing regulations which would require the
reporting of other transactions# other than those specified
in the regulations, including the importing of all trans­
actions by check on personal checking accounts.
QUESTION:

Would you clarify for me# at any rate#

62
what the terra "currency transaction" means, Mr. Wallace?
Give an example of it.
MR. WALLACE: Well, these are transactions, one
example was given by Mr. Justice Brennan, if he should get
$15,000 in currency just by presenting a check and asking
for that much currency.

Although the denominations of the

smaller bills do not have to be reported on the reporting
form, that would be the only exception I would take to the
description that was made.

It's only bills of $100 and over

that must be mentioned.
QUESTION:

Although this mentions" the type,

amount and denomination of the currency involved".

I’m

looking at page 15 of your brief.
MR. WALLACE;

"Type, amount and denomination".

MR. WALLACE:

Well, yes.

Yes.

But the form itself does not

summarizing it oh pages 14 and 15.

The amount has to be

given, and then the amount in denominations of $100 or
higher.

The form is relatively concise, but ■—
QUESTION:

to tliat.

Mr. Wallace, what about the'corollary

If I walk into the bank every week with $15,000 in

large bills to buy a draft on a Swiss bank, to transfer my
money to them —

MR. WALLACE:

That, too, would be a currency

transaction, to be reported.
QUESTION:
MR. WALLACE:

— that’s the same -And it would be for currency or

other bearer instrument transactions, such as a bank check
made out to cash, or something of the sort, which anybody
could cash.
A bearer instrument that has the same negotiability
as currency, virtually the same.

That's what these are

involved with.
QUESTION:

So I gather in Answer 3 on the

Currency Transaction Report, if you had in the $15,000,
$10,000 in denominations of 100, 500 or 1,000 dollars, you'd
just put the number, total:

how many 100, how many 500,

how many 1,000? which is the total.
MR. WALLACE:

It's my understanding that that

would be adequate.
These reports have been perfectly kept relatively
simple, with the idea that if an Internal Revenue audit is
called for, of course they’ll be getting into more detail
then? if there isn't, there is no point in burdening
transactions with onerous requirements.
A great deal of time has been devoted to developing
the regulations and forms which the regulations didn't take
effect until two years after the Act was passed, because of

64
the efforts that were made.

There was an overriding

congressional purpose not to cause unnecessary burdens on
tine flow of these transactions.
There is one aspect of the domestic currency
transaction reporting provisions that I should devote a
few minutes to, because it's a problem that has been raised
for the first time in the case in the brief for the Appellees,
filed not long ago in the case? and that is a contention that
the regulation, the contention made in the red-covered brief
by the Bankers Association, that the regulation is invalid,
implementing this provision, because it doesn't require a
report to be made by the customer as well as the bank.
And the legislative history indicates that Congress
did contemplate and, indeed, the Act required the report to
be made by both parties in order to assure that the customer
would be notified.
This contention, it seems to us, is not before the
Court in this case, it's raised by the California Bankers
Association,

It's on pages 37 through 39 of their red-

covered brief,
QUESTION:

When was that brief filed?

a date on the cover of it?
MR, WALLACE;

A stamp,
Well, we received it on January 5th

in our office.
QUESTION:

Has it got

A red-covered brief?

65

MR. WALLACEz

Well, there was a white-covered

brief that was identical to it, and then a red-covered brief
substituted for it.
The brief for the Appellee California Bankers
Association.
QUESTION:

But it’s the same as —

MR. WALLACE:

The same as the white-covered brief.

It’s exactly the same brief.
QUESTION:
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

What pages were you referring to?
It's on pages 37 through 39, yes.
We have a white one, filed January 2nd.

MR. WALLACE: Well, that’s the same brief, the
printer had been instructed to bind it in red, and he had
bound it in white and he sent it, and then he sent substitute
copies, but they're all — there's no change inside.
QUESTION; So what page now?
MR. WALLACE:

37 through 39, a contention is made

that the regulation is invalid, because it requires only the
financial institution to file the report, whereas the Act
contemplated that the regulation would require

both the

institution and the customer to file the report.
We don't believe this contention is properly before
the Court, because it's made here by the Bankers Association,
who are obviously not within the zone of interest to .be
protected under their own contention, which was assurance

66

that the customer would he notified as the congressionally
stated purpose of requiring both to file the report.
There is nothing to stop the members of the
California Bankers Association from notifying their customers
when they file such reports, either in person at the time the
information is secured, or by sending the customer a copy of
the report or, indeed, by having the customer countersign
the report, which is not required by the Treasury regulations
but the report would still be accepted by the Treasury if it
were filed that way.
QUESTION:

That's a little odd, isn’t it?

The

statute is unambiguous in what it requires, and you say
that the Executive Branch has just chosen to disregard it.
It's going to be like one Of these impoundment cases, isn't
it?
MR, WALLACE:

When you say the statute is unambiguous,

Mr. Justice Stewart, let me look at the statute, at the bottom
of page 37;
"The report of any transaction required to be
reported under this chapter shall be signed or otherwise made"

QUESTION:
MR. WALLACE:

Both.
— "both" ~~ well, of course, the

information is secured by the bank from the customer, and
the "otherwise made" language was believed by the Secretary —

QUESTION:

Well, it's the "both" language that

we're talking about.
MR. WALLACE:

Yes, but there are other ~~ additional

provisions of the Act that have a bearing, namely Section
206 of the Act, which gives the Secretary broad authority •—
this is in our Jurisdictional Statement, on page 80, which
gives the Secretary broad authority to make exceptions to
the requirements of the Act, as he sees fit, in developing
the regulations.
QUESTION; Well, that answers ray question.
MR. WALLANCE: And another answer is that while
the House Committee Report interpreted -this language as
requiring the report to be made by both, for the reasons
stated in the excerpt from that Committee Report, set out
at page 38 of the brief? the Senate Committee took exactly
the contrary view.

This is not set out in the brief, filed

by the Appellees.

We didn't want to burden the Court v/ith

an additional reply brief, because we didn't think the issue
was in the case to begin with.
It is my understanding that the individuals in the
case don't claim that they engage in any transactions of
this type nor are they contemplating engaging in such
transactions.
The Senate Committee Report, v/ith respect to
exactly the same statutory language,

I'm quoting now from

68

page 3-5 of the brief

took exactly the opposite view in

analyzing the domestic currency reporting requirements.
QUESTION:

Page 15 in what brief?

MR. WALLACE:

This is not a brief, sir, this is

page 15 of the Senate Committee Report, which is not before
the Court, but —QUESTION:

Oh.

HR. WALLACE:

All right.
— it is available to the Court,

And I'll read -the entire paragraph, since it's
quite short, and it's the only part dealing with the
analysis of the domestic currency reporting provision;
These sections authorize the Secretary to require
reports on transactions in currency or other monetary
instruments involving domestic financial institutions when
the transactions are in such amounts or under such circum­
stances as the Secretary may prescribe.

The reports can be

required of the financial institution or the party involved
or both.

The Secretary is authorized to designate domestic

financial institutions as agents of the United States to
receive required reports.
That is Section 223 which was never implemented.
And that is the analysis given in the Senate Committee Report.
The question is one that the Secretary gave a lot
of attention to in developing the regulation.

He came to

the conclusion that he did based on comments that were made

69
by the industry as to the cumbersomeness of the process if
they had to get their customers to file reports of such
transactions.
And, in light of the over-all congressional purpose,
of not imposing unnecessary burdens on Congress, the Secretary
concluded that the exemption authority given him should be
utilized here, and that the purposes of the Act would
adequately be served.
QUESTION: But that's not — one of the purposes of
this provision contained in the House Report certainly is
not served, because — am I correct?

— because this does

enable the bank to give this information to the Internal
Revenue without any knowledge whatsoever on the part of its
customers.

Isn't that correct?
MR. WALLACE:

the same language.

And the

It just adopted

Both reports are referring to the same

70

language.
QUESTIONs

Unh-hunh.

MR. WALLACE:

And there’s just

I don’t think

the issue is before the Court in the case, and for that
reason we haven’t briefed it.

It wasn't even introduced

in the proceedings in the District Court.

There wasn't an

objection raised at that time.
The only basis on which the individuals before the
Court claim that they can raise the issue is not that they
have engaged or contemplate engaging in these cash
transactions, but that the Act as a whole is not severable
and that this is invalid, the parts that concern them are
invalid.
It seems to us that the concerns expressed by
Congress about why they needed to have the various provisions
pretty well refute contention that if the Court found one
aspect of it to be invalid, tha it should strike down the
entire Act.

Indeed, the fact that substantially similar

domestic reporting provisions antedated the Act under the
Trading .With the Enemy Act, and stood alone for many years,
*

indicates that Congress didn't think that all of this had to
be one package.
Now, I’d like to say just a few words about the
foreign transaction reporting provisions of Title II, and
their implementing regulations which were upheld by the court

71
below, and which require reports of the transactions that
the individuals here do say they engage in, of trcinsportation
of monetary instruments involving more than $5,000 into or
out of the United States, and reports by persons in the
United States of their relationship with foreign financial
institutions.
Much of the testimony developed in the hearings was
concerned v/ith the very serious problems caused by the
concealing or purifying of fruits of domestic criminal
activity, and the concealing of ongoing violations of tax,
regulatory and criminal laws by the use of secret bank
accounts in Bank Secrecy jurisdictions; accounts over which
Congress does not have direct regulatory authority.
The examples given were deted led and varied, of
evasions of capital gains taxes, through sales of securities,
through illegal trading in gold; of the concealing of
securities, manipulations, or the concealing of insider
trading in securities; and numerous other examples of a man
making a loan to himself from his own secret bank account
and then deducting the interest payments is one that 1
recall from the hearings»
It was testified by Robert Morgenthau, former
United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York,
that in his estimation thousands of such accounts, involving
hundreds of millions of dollars, were being used for

72
illicit purposes.

And the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,

Randolph Thrower testified that the integrity

of the self™

assessment system of taxation itself was being threatened
by the use of these accounts.
The objections that have been raised to this are,
first of all, a claim that there might be a problem under
the self™incrimination provision of the

Fifth Amendment.

We don't believe that claim is before the Court, because no
one in Court has said that filing such a report would tend
to incriminate him, which is the prerequisite for raising any
claim of privilege under the Fifth Amendment.
event, the claim would be premature.

And, in any

These are reports to be

filed with the Internal Revenue return itself.
Under the Sullivan case the claim should be made,
if it's going to be made, on the return.

And under Marchetti

and Grosso, even if there is something so inherently
incriminating here that the individual would be justified in
not filing any report at all, that wotild not mean that they're
entitled to the kind of relief they've sought in this case,
which is invalidating the entire Act, because others might
well be able to comply without incriminating themselves.
And, indeed, it's very likely that couriers and
others would comply.

The Marchetti and Grosso cases both

specifically said that the tax there was not being struck down,
they were merely upholding a valid claim of privilege made by

73
someone who showed that he couldn't file the report required
without incriminating himself.
tod the Fourth Amendment claims that are made with
respect to this provisions seem to us to be answered by the
cases saying that reports required for valid regulatory
purposes are not an unreasonable search and seizure, and
the Court said this as far back as Boyd, in the passage
that we refer to.
There is under our laws no reasonable expectation
of privacy in bringing things into and out of the country,
the customs laws indicate quitethe contrary.

Nor is there

a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to
financial- transactions and bank accounts, which are subject
to, in this country to -the Internal Revenue summons
procedures, and to other processes that do not require a
search warrant to be issued initially.
QUESTION;

Practically everybody in the United

States is under that.

of these people are never going to get involved in any
criminal offense, but they still get their name put in.

$230 to buy a washing machine.
MR. WALLACE;

He goes, too.

It would have to he $10,000 in

order to have the reporting requirements apply.
QUESTION;

Well, $10,000 to buy a house.

MR. WALLACE;

It would have to be in excess of

$10,000.
QUESTION;

His old grandfather left him ten

thousand.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

If he did that by cash —

Yes.

MR. WALLACE:

-- as a cash transaction, the

institution or the bank would file a report of it.
QUESTION:

And he wouldn't even know about it.

MR. WALLACE;

Well, there's nothing to keep the bank

from telling him about it, and the Secretary has publicized
these regulations very widely, has held press conferences,
has disseminated booklets -QUESTION; Well, you don't —
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

about them and so forth.
You don't pay the bank to notify them,

do you?
MR. WALLACE:

No, the government does not.

QUESTION;

Can I assmne that the bank wouldn’t

notify them, and pay the bill themselves.
that?

Could I assume

Prom my e3jperien.ee with banks.
QUESTION;

The bank might have that charge in

with the monthly canceled checks, could they not?
MR, WALLACE;

I til ink one could as reasonably

assume that when the bank asks for the information for the
report, that the bank will be telling them itfhy they need
this information.
QUESTION; Well, the House Committee talked about
the risk of the Secretary of the Treasury putting pressure
on a bank to give it this information without informing its
cusfcomers.
MR. WALLACE:
said that.

That —- the House Committee Report

We don’t believe that issue is before the Court

in this case,
QUESTION:

No,

MR. WALLACE;
QUESTION;

But that risk is —
And. -that issue was --

-- but that risk exists under the

regulation, doesn't it?
MR. WALLACE;
QUESTION;

Under the regulation.

That’s not —

Well, wouldn’t the banks themselves be

kind of anxious to supply the information without having the
customer cooperate?

In other words, it might be a two-sided

end run around the customer, so to speak, but the banks

76

would probably prefer to furnish it without having to serve a
copy on the customer/ so that the customer doesn't get it,
see it/ and say, you know, What's my bank done to me.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that wasn't what was indicated

in the commentary that the Department received as the reason
why the banks thought it would be better for them to be
doing it themselves.

They claimed that it wo\:ild be an

impediment to the expeditious conduct of business if they
had to stop and draw up the whole report so that the
customer could sign it while the customer was present.
But that is not in the record.

This is information

developed in the course of drafting the regulations, which
we could have introduced in the District Court, if the issue
had been raised in the District Court, which it was not.
And we don't think it's here for decision, in any
event.
And unless there are further questions, our submission
is that Congress, faced with testimony about various serious
problems, adopted a ver/ restrained method of enacting
legislation that was necessary and proper to see to it that
the channels of commerce were used in a manner to facilitate
rather than hinder the enforcement of various tax, regulatory
and criminal laws.

And it's difficult to see how they could

have done anything effective that would be more restrained
than what they've done, in the Act and implementing regulations.

77
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Marson.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES C» MARSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF FORTNEY H. STARK, JR., ET AL.
MR. MARSON;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The choice of adjectives, such as "restrained" is
of course largely up to the user.
We do not think that the surveillance of 200 million
bank accounts, which is how many there are in this country,
is "restrained".
We do not think that the copying of in excess of
twenty billion checks a year, which is how many clear their
maker's banks in this country every year, is "restrained".
Even if we assumed that every bank in the country
pays the extra money to sort out the checks that are under
$100 and not copy them, by the government's own statistic
that reduces the number by ninety percent down to two billion
checks every year.

We do not think that is "restrained",

either.
But we do not think that if the Constitution permits
the copying of checks over $100 simply because they're over
$100, tliat that makes any difference —
QUESTION:

That might have been a little bit more

terrifying twenty or thirty years ago, but after the advent

78

of Social Security and Medicare, to say nothing of the
enlargement of the reach of tax laws, those numbers, when
you acid them up, produce numbers very much like the ones
you're talking about.
MR. MARSON: They do, but not in the enforcement of
the criminal lav;.
QUESTION: But often used for that purpose.
MR. MARSON:

Often used, yes.

And this Court has

had occasion to deal with the difficult problem where the
tax law and the criminal law meet in a gray area, and it
becomes the pleader's option in the hands of the IRS.
This is not such a case.
case.

The government began this

Its opening brief crossed with ours in the mail.

Both briefs claimed that the purpose of the Act was the
enforcement of the criminal lav;.
Apparently when — yes, Mr. Justice Powell?
QUESTION:

I just want to be sure of your position,

your clients' position.

You attack the reporting of foreign

currency transactions on the same grounds essentially as you
do domestic currency transactions?
MR. MARSON:

Yes, we do.

We think that the analogy

to a Customs Declaration is slightly ridiculous, the form on
which these transactions have to be reported require such
things as a gener/.

If an instrument is transported not

physically across the border but through the first-class mails,

79

it still has to be reported.

And if yon do it for someone

else, you have to name him, give his address and give his
business or occupation.
That's not like a customs declaration.

I can bring

a bottle of Scotch from Heathrow Airport, and I may have to
declare it, but I don’t have to say who I'm giving it to.
There's a great deal more information -~
QUESTION;

But if you carry a gift from London

for the accommodation of a friend in London to some young
lady who's getting married in Hew York, you must report that
on the customs declaration.
MR. MARSON:

That I do it for the purpose of giving

it to someone else?
QUESTION;

That you do it for the accommodation

of someone else, that you're carrying it for the accommoda­
tion of another person.
MR. MARSQN;

I was unaware of ’that, Your Honor.

Do I have to list the other person's profession or
business?

I doubt that.
The government says in its own brief that the purpose

of these reports is to supply leads to see which record
should be subpoenaed or summonsed, which I think puts a
slightly different cast on it.
The government and we all claim that criminal law
enforcement is the central purpose of this legislation, in our

80

opening briefs.
Then, in its Appellees brief, the government, as it
does here, takes a slightly different position, that this is
being done pursuant to the regulatory power of Congress over
banks.
Now, everywhere

the legislative history of

course does not support that, and the government doesn't claim
that it does •— everywhere the Act exempts transactions that
have to do with banks.

An intrabank transaction is nowhere

required to be reported or recorded.
Transactions between two banks, unless there are
customers involved, do not have to be recorded or reported.
A good illustration of how little this has to do
with the regulation of banks is this;

my client, Security

National Bank could, tomorrow, give Mr. Anderson's client,
the Bank of America, fifteen billion dollars in used $100 bills
and as far as the Bank Secrecy Act is concerned, they wouldn't
even have to write it down, let alone report it.
QUESTION:

That’s under the

?

Act,

QUESTION;

That's what I was going to say.

They

have to report to somebody in government.
MR. MARSON;

Well, their own ledger sheets as between

them would disclose the transaction, but they would not have
to report that under the Bank Secrecy Act, and I don't know
that they would have to report it under —

81
QUESTION: They wouldn't have to report it under any
Act?
MR. MAR30N:

Not to ray know ledge.

QUESTION: Well, you better look up some of them.
Bank transfers are reported to the government.

I'm

as sure as I'm sitting here.
MR. MARSON:

I was unaware of that, Mr. Justice

Marshall.
QUESTION:

Not under the Secrecy Act, of course

not.
MR. MARSON:

No, not under this Act.

My point is that the Bank Secrecy Act, as opposed
to some other Act of Congress, has nothing to do with those
kinds of transactions.

It has nothing to do with the

regulation of banks.
So, to support the Bank Secrecy Act, as opposed
to the Federal Reserve Act, on tire theory that it is a
regulation of commerce, is wholly unjustifiable in this case.
Of course, the Federal Reserve Act is a legitimate
regulation of commerce, and that is not challenged here.
The Bank Secrecy Act has nothing to do with the regulation
of banking.
The analogy ~
QUESTION:

Well, it hadn’t been my understanding

that you were arguing that this legislation was beyond the

82

constitutional power of Congress to enact under the commerce
power, but, rather, that it violated specific provisions
of the Bill of Rights, i.e. , the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.
MR. MARSON:
QUESTION:
MR. MARSON:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Isn't that —
Actually it —
I have not misapprehended your argument,

have I?
MR. MARSON:

In terms of its purpose it ought to

be comprehended as an exercise of the police power.

It

happens to use as a means its plenary regulatory power over
the banks.
QUESTION: Well, it isn't any police power in Congress.
All of Congress's criminal statutes are based on the commerce
power.
QUESTION: Wall — or the taxing power.
QUESTION:

Or under their taxing power.

Congress

doesn't have any police powers.
MR, MARSON:

Let me offer this analogy of the inter­

play of these powers to the Fourth Amendment.
Congress has every bit of the plenary power over the
telephone company, as it does over the banks.
QUESTION;
MR. MARSON:

Unh-hunh.
If, tomorrow, somebody invented the

technology to record all calls, and if the day after Congress

83
passed an Act called the Telephone Secrecy Act, which
required them to do so, and then the Solicitor General
defended the Act on the ground that the government had plenary
regulatory power over the telephone company, and that the
parties who were engaged in those calls had no interest in
those calls, that they were third-party business records,
that they were not reached under Couch and Donaldson, then
that theory, which is identical to this theory except the
technology isn't here yet, then that theory would wipe out
Kafcs and Berger and U.S. v. U.S._District Court.
QUESTION:

But it wouldn't wipe out the Fourth

and Fifth Amendment objections.

But I don't see that the

telephone notion is particularly objectionable on the commerce
clause ground.
It seems to me that in response to Justice Stewart's
question you say you're arguing Fourth and Fifth Amendments
as restrictions rather than lack of a permitive authority
under commerce power.
MR. MARSON:
QUESTION;

I agree with that, Your Honor.
But for purposes of the commerce clause,

conceivably, government might want to find out whether the
telephone companies were reporting accurately all their long­
distance calls by merely measuring them, and under the
commerce clause that would not be, probably would not be
affected.

84

MR. MARS ON:

For the purpose that you stated*, it

would not.
QUESTION:
MR. MARSON:
QUESTION:

No.
But nobody claims here, except

»

Mr» Justice Relinquish suggested when

you get into taking the content of the communication down,
then something other than the commerce clause comes into
play.
MR* MARSON;

Well, certainly the Fourth Amendment

does, as this Court has frequently decided.
It is the suggestion of the government that because
they serve multiple purposes here, that the criminal law
aspect to this legislation can be ignored.

Notwithstanding

its primacy in the legislative history, in the Act, and in
the government's opening brief, the suggestion is that because
this Act serves all legal purposes at once it therefore can
be justified by reference to all regulatory purposes at once.
It seems to us that that constitutes an abandonment
of judicial supervision over the scope of the government's
power to require records.
Take, for example, Section 6001 of the Tax Code.
That’s the section under which the tax authorities already
have plenary power to require such records and to require
such statements, which is the equivalent of reports, as are
necessary to assess the tax liability of any person.

35
That was not enough to support what has been enacted
here.
This Court, in measuring a subpoena under 7602 of
the Tax Code, could measure the purpose of the subpoena, i.e„,
the enforcement of tax liability in the specific context
of the purpose of taxation against the scope and necessity
and showing made for the subpoena, because there was a
referent, -there is a specific purpose to be fulfilled.
When specific purposes are abandoned and the whole
of enforcible law becomes the end product of a piece of
legislation, then that means that -the referent, the measuring
stick for the reasonableness of a search for an order to
produce documents is gone.
If Congress can enforce all purposes at once, it
is implicit in the Solicitor General's argument that the
enforcement of those purposes knows no limit, because they
are all-purpose.
That, we think, is an essentially dangerous notion
to the Fourth Amendment.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3s13 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
