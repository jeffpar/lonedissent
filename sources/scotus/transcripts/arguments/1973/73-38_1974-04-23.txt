MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

first this morning in 73~38, United States against Marine
Bancorporation.
Mr. Friedman, you may proceed whenever you're ready
STATEMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MRP FRIEDMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court s
This is a direct appeal from a judgment of the
United States District Court for the Western District of
Washington, dismissing, after trial, a government civil anti­
trust suit challengina a bank merger under Section 7 of the
Clayton Act.
The acquiring bank, tne National Bank of Commerce
of Seattle, is both the second largest bank in the State of
Washington and the second largest bank in the City of Seattle
The Acquired bank, the Washington Trust Bank is the
third largest bank .in the City of Spokane.

It is conceded

that the two banks are not in competition with each other,
because the National Bank of Commerce does not operate in the
city of Spokanef that is, in the metropolitan area of Spokane
which the District Court held to be the relevant geographic
market in this case.
The theory upon which the government challenged

4
this merger was that the National Bank of Commerce was a
significant potential entrant into the City of Spokane, and
that by going in through acquiring a major firm in Spokane,
the effectiveness may be substantially to lessen competition
by eliminating an important potential competitor.
The Court had a similar question before it last
term in the Greeley Bank case of Colorado, in which, by an
equally divided court, it affirmed the District Court's judgment
in that case, dismissing the government's complaint.
And the United States has brought this case here and
brought the question back to the Court because a major effort
of the Department of Justice in recent years has been attempting
to stop what we consider a very serious trend in the banking
industry under which large banks neadquartered in the major
cities of the State are acquiring market leaders in local and
regional markets.
Now, this is a relatively new phenomenon in banking.
In the Fifties we had a great wave of bank mergers, in which
banks in the same city who were competitors would combine; that
trend basically stopped after this Court's decision in the
Philadelphia Bank case.
And what has been happening in recent years is
that more and more throughout the country banks, the major
banks have been around the State acquiring a large number of
significant banks.

The effect of this trend is to bring more and more
of a State's banking resources under the control of a small
number of- banks.
In the State of Washington itself, for example,
75 percent of all the deposits are now controlled by five
banking organizations, even though there's some 90 different
banking organizations in the State.
In some States it's even more concentrated, a smalle
number of banking organizations hold a larger percentage of
the shares of the market»
And the government believes that if this trend is
permitted to continue, the inevitable result will be a
significant and serious diminution of competition in the
banking industry.
Since 1968 the government has brought twenty cases
in which it has challenged bank acquisitions on the theory
that it eliminated the potential competition which the
acquired bank was likely to supply,in our view, in the market
where it made the acquisition.
How, let me just briefly refer to the —
QUESTION:

You mean the acquiring bank?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The acquiring bank.

QUESTION: Right.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
substantial competitor,

That the acquiring bank is the

6
QUESTION: Right.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

— and it eliminates potential

competition which it would supply in the market into which
it goes through the acquisition.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. FRIEDMANs

Now, let me just briefly refer to the

facts.
The National Bank of Commerce is a very large
bank.

As I've indicated, it's the second largest bank in

both the State of Washington and in the City of Seattle.
It has net assets of $1.8 billion, and its deposits are more
than $1.6 billion.

It has approximately 22 percent of all the

bank deposits in the State.

It operates 107 branch offices.

The acquired bank, the Washington Trust Bank, is
the third largest in the City of Spokane, it has total assets
t'

of $112 million, deposits of $95 million, and has eight
offices in the City of Spokane? so it, itself, is a very
substantial bank.

It is a prosperous bank.

In the five-year

period from 1966 to 1971, its total deposits increased 60 per­
cent, its total loans increased 70 percent.
It is concededly a well-managed bank, it pays very
high salaries.

The Spokane area, in which the bank operates,

is itself a prosperous and growing area, although, admittedly,
not growing as fast as other areas of the State of Washington.
The District Court found, and the parties are in

7

agreement, that commercial banking is the relevant product
market in this case.

Commercial banking in -the State of

Washington is extremely concentrated.

As I indicated, the

five largest banks have 75 percent of all the deposits, and
additionally have SO percent of the banking offices.
The two largest banks, one of which is the National
Bank of Commerce, and the other is the Seattle First National
Bank, together have approximately half of all deposits and
more than one-third of all the banking offices.
This pattern of concentration is repeated throughout
the State, but, not surprising, when you get into smaller
cities, it becomes even more concentrated? and in Spokane the
three leading banks have 92 percent of all the deposits and
loans, and there's almost as high a concentration in the
eastern part of the State of Washington, which is geographically
separated from the western part of the State by a very high
mountain range.
Now, in 1971, the two banks submitted to the
Comptroller an application to merge the Washington Trust Bank,
the bank in Spokane, into National Bank of Commerce, the
Seattle bank and the second largest bank in the State.
\

In accordance with the requirements of the statute,
the views were sought of the two bank regtilatory agencies and
the Department of Justice, all three of these groups advised
the Comptroller that in their view the merger would sub-

8

stantially lessen competition primarily because of its
tendency to increase concentration in the State.
The Comptroller, however, approved the merger and
the government filed this suit, which had the effect of
staying the merger.
After a lengthy trial, the District Court, from the
bench, gave a brief opinion in which he announced that he was
holding against the government on all of its claims and would
dismiss the suit.
Following this, in accordance with his request, the
defendant submitted detailed proposed findings, which the
District Court adopted without any change.
The theory of the government's case was that the
National Bank of Commerce could enter Spokane by alternative
means, specifically, either by making a so-called toe-hold
entry of a smaller bank, or by in effect opening a branch
through a procedure that I will discuss shortly, known as
sponsoring a bank, and subsequently then acquiring it.
The District Court made the following rulings, in
rejecting our rase;
First, the District Court held that although there's:
a high level of concentration in Spokane, nevertheless,. the
market is competitive.

This is on the basis of expert

testimony that in fact there's a great deal of competition
in the market because of the large number of sizable banking

9

organisations.
Then the District Court held that -there was no
reasonable likelihood that the National Bank of Commerce
would enter Spokane either by sponsoring a bank or by making
a toe~hold acquisition, and that this merger was the only
way the bank could get in.
Then the Court held that there was no reasonablelikelihood that the Washington Trust Bank itself might
expand outside of the Spokane region.

This was another theory

on which we urged that the merger would substantially lessen
competition by eliminating potential competition, or that the
bank would join other banks in forming a new holding company,
a smaller holding company that might compete against the
large banks in the State.
And finally the Court held that even if this merger
had, as the Court described it, some aura of the anti­
competitive effects, which the government alleged, nevertheless
those effects were clearly outweighed by the effect of the
merger in meeting the convenience and needs of the Spokane
community.
I will discuss these four grounds in the course of
my argument.
Now, last terra, in tire Falstaff case, this Court
left open the question, as it phrased it, whether a merger
would violate Section 7 on the ground that the acquiring

10

company, and I now quote, "could, but did not, enter de novo
or through 'toe-hold' acquisition and that there is less
competition than there would have been had entry been in such
a manner."
He think this case presents that question, and we
urge that the Court should answer it affirmatively and then,
on the principle, it should hold that this merger does violate
Section 7.
QUESTION:

Excuse me.

At some point, I take it,

you v/ill discuss the relationship between this transaction
in the Falstaff case, an unregulated business, and banking,
a national bank which is regulated.
MR. FRIEDMANs

Well, let me deal with that right

now, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION: All right.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It's true there is regulation of

banking, but this Court, in the Philadelphia Bank case, has
indicated its view that it thinks that the basic principles
governing Section 7, particularly the stress on market
structure and concentration, are equally applicable to banking,
even though it is a regulated industry.
The fact that there is regulation means there's not
quite the same ease of entry into the market as in an
unregulated industry, but, nevertheless, we still think it's
important to preserve — to preserve — these alternative

II
sources of competition.

And we don't think that the fact

that the Comptroller has indicated that he doesn't think he
would approve a merger on the basis of what he now knows,
without any application, or, in this case, that his assistant,
the Regional Administrator, testified that he didn't think
there was any reasonable likelihood that a new charter would
be granted.
We don't think that that is enough to overcome
the significant effects, the significant effects upon
concentration in banking that exists, and for which we think
that this kind of entry poses the on3„y possibility of some
help.
The same argument, of course, was as equally
applicable in the Philadelphia Bank case and the Phillipsburg
case, where again you had to have regulatory approval before
the merger would take place.

Now,
QUESTION: Was there a legislative change after the
Philadelphia Bank case?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

There was a legislative change, Mr.

Justice, to this extent, that after -the Philadelphia Bank case,
Congress, in the 1966 Bank Merger Act, added the convenience
and needs defense, but, at the same time, — at the same time
*

\

Congress indicated that it wished bank mergers to be
tested under the standards that had hitherto been applied

12

under the antitrust laws, under Section 7.

And we think that

what Congress did in the 1966 amendments was to say that
you continue to evaluate competitive effect the same as it's
always been evaluated.

And I will mention in a minute this

Court has always stressed the structure of the market,
based on concentration ratios.
But then said, if it turns out that a merger has
the prohibitive anti-competitive effect, then and only then
is the Court to consider whether this otherwise illegal merger
is saved.
QUESTION:

By convenience and necessity.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

By convenience and necessity, yes.

Convenience and needs, I'm sorry.>
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, if you lose on the

question which you said was left open in Fa1staff, is that
—...___,__

the end of the case as far as you're concerned?

p

You said

this case poses that question.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

That ---

If you lose on that question, should

the judgment be affirmed?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mo, Mr. Justice, we think that —

QUESTION: All right. That's all I want to know»
MR. FRIEDMAN:

We've discussed this in our brief,

but we also claim that this was a perceived entry? but the
major thrust of this case in the District Court was on this

13

theory.

We're not conceding that if we lose on this theory,

we lose the case.

But this is the theory upon which was the

major focus in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, there are two aspects.

There's

the actual potential entry and then there's the perceived
entry, is that right?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's right.

And the question

which —
QUESTION: And they're separate.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

— the Court opened in Falstaff was

the former.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. FRIEDMAN: But we do not concede that if the
Court should reject that theory that we lose this case?
because, as we have indicated in our brief, w© do think there
was evidence showing that this bank was a perceived entrant.
And we also have the other point, which I'll just
mention, I've alluded to previously, that if this, the effect
of this merger, by making Washington Trust a part of the
National Bank of Commerce, would he to eliminate whatever
potential Washington Trust has as a large significant
independent bank in the Spokane market, of expanding beyond
that area and perhaps combining.
Now, the reason we think that the question left
open in the Falstaff case should be resolved in favor of the

14
United States' position is the whole intent of Congress,
when it amended Section 7 in 1950to strengthen it, that what
Congress was concerned about was what it viewed as the rising
increase in concentration in the American economy.
Congress recognized that more and more portions of
the economy were being brought under the control of a small
number of large firms.

And Congress, when it strengthened

the statute in 1950, was concerned about the long-range pros­
pects of the American economy.

It wasn't not looking,

unlike the Sherman Act, to the immediate effect, whether a
particular transaction restrained commerce, it was looking
to the long-range effects.

It wanted to, basically to

channel business growth into pro-comeptitive channels, to
stop the practices by which American business was gradually
taking more, bringing more and more of the economy under
control.
As this Court stated in the Philadelphia Bank case,
that one premise of Section 7 was that "corporate growth by
internal expansion is socially preferable to growth.- by
acuisition",
Now, when a market becomes concentrated, what
happens, according to the economists, is that the vigor of
competition tends to diminish.

You have a small number of

firms in the market, you have accommodation, narrow
practices begin to develop.

15

And the only real hope, frequently, for either
deconcentrating the market or shaking it up, so that there
will be more competition in the market, is if someone new
comes in.

And someone new comes in in a way that is going

to force this new firm to compete vigorously by what, in
antitrust jargon, is called de novo entry.

That is, they

come in anew, either by themselves starting the branch of
the business or, alternatively, by making a toe-hold
acquisition, getting a small segment of the market which
enables them to get into the market and from that base, by
vigorous competition, growing and expanding.
But it is essential to stress that in that situation
you have a new firm, a new firm coming into the market.
And when a firm that is on the outside and is a likely
entrant by one of these two methods, comes in by acquiring a
large share of the market, 22 percent in this case, you’ve
not only eliminated the potential for bringing some competi­
tion and, hopefully, eventual deconcentration into this
market, but all you have done is substitute one for the
other.

So you’ve not only lost an additional competitor

in this process, but you’ve eliminated the potential for
improving the competitive situation in the market.
Now, as I’ve indicated in my response to the Chief
Justice, we think that these principles are equally
applicable —

16

QUESTION:

You haven't eliminated the competitor

in the market?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, you've eliminated the potential

of equally —
QUESTION:

Well, you've only done one thing; you've

just eliminated the potential of a nev; entry.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Of a new entry.

You just have a different competitor in

the market.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
the market,

You have a different competitor in

you have no new competitor —

QUESTION:

You haven't eliminated one.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

You've eliminated, Mr. Justice,

the potential.
QUESTION:

It may be a different — he may act

differently, but for your purposes you assume that he will
be exactly the same.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

We say basically there's been no

change in the structure of this market.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

It's the same as it was before, with

four or five or whatever number it is.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN: But, although the structure of the
market hasn't changed, the sfctructure surrounding the market

17
has changed, because 'the one on the outside who may come in
has been eliminated,
QUESTION;
a stronger bank,

Mr, Friedman, the new competitor would be

What is the government’s position as to

whether or not competition with the new bank in the re would
be more effective than it is at present?
MR. FRIEDMAWs

Well, Mr. Justice, we think that

Congress, in Section 7, has made the judgment that you cannot
justify an acquisition coming into a market in the normal
situation on the claim that you will be able to compete
more effectively against the large bank.

We think if at all

■—if at all — the claim that the new bank, -that the new bank
will be a more effective competitor in the market is what
Congress intended to be studied under the convenience and
needs defense, so that is, we think, not a relevant
factor in determining the initial threshold question whether
there has been anti-competitive effect.
And, as we develop in our brief, and I hope to get
to, we think in this case that the so-called benefits — the
so-called benefits —- which the District Court found this
merger would bring to the City of Spokane, those benefits
we do not think constitute the kind, the kind of benefit that
Congress intended to recognize.
QUESTIQNL

You lose me a little bit when you say

that the essence of your position is that the government is

18
interested in improving competitive conditions and yet if
a stronger competitor enters the market, you don't lose a
competitor, you obtain a stronger one, how is the public
adversely affected by that?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I think, Mr. Justice, because

the stress of Section 7s is on the long-term picture, on the
long-term picture initially, initially it may well be that a
bank coming in, substituting itself for a somewhat weaker
bank may produce an immediate flurry of competition; a little
more competitive.
But, in the long run, in the long run we think it's
anti-competitive, because it still is a concentrate market,
and you have lost one of the significant potentials for
deconcentration.
I may add in this case, this is not a case of the
acquiring bank coming in because the acquired bank is
or floundering.
good bank.

This is a successful, very prosperous,

It’s a large bank.

It's a bank of roughly

$100 million.
The claim here is that by the larger bank coming in,
it will enable the new bank to provide certain specialised
service which, because of its smaller size, it's not been
able to provide.

Services which, I might add, are available,

are available in Spokane through other banks already in the
market.

19

And we think that that kind of benefit — that kind
of benefit —- is not enough to justify this merger? that the
whole purpose of Section 7 — the whole purpose of Section 7
is to try to stop the increases in concentration, to try
to stop these, what Congress believed to be deleterious trends
in the economy.

And banking itself, unfortunately, tends to

be concentrated. Banking is, tends to be concentrated in most
cities, except perhaps for a city like New York, where you
have a large number of banks, you find that banking is
concentrated.
And thus, it seems to us, it’s all the more
important in banking to preserve the possibility of deconcen­
tration resulting from the entrant of a potential competitor
of a strong,significant, pox^erful firm that seeks to get into
the market.
We think that's the whole purpose, that's the
whole purpose that Congress had when it amended Section 7
in 1950 in order to strengthen it.
QUESTION;
the

Mr. Friedman, you commented earlier about

government's view of the desirability of de novo entry.

What has been the history, or does the record show over the
past several decades, of de novo entry into the banking
market in Spokane?
MR. FRIEDMAN;
let me explain —

Not in Spokane, Mr. Justice, but

20

QUESTION: Well, what ~~ does the record show anything
about the history of de novo entry into the banking market in
Spokane?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, Mr. Justice, for the reason, for

the reason that under State law a bank that has its head­
quarters in one city is not permitted to branch outside of
either that city or the county where its headquarters is or
into an unincorporated — an incorporated village that does
' * -

not have a bank.

We do not have in the City of Spokane any

history of de novo branching.

We have one bank that was

founded in 1955.
But what we do have, Mr. Justice, what we do have
.

, •<

is a history in the State of Washington of a practice by
banks of sponsoring banks, assisting in their organization,
helping them get started/ and then subsequently acquiring.
We do have that practice.
QUESTION:

We dcrjiave

Is that concedediy legal under the laws

of Washington?
MR. FRIEDMAN: There's a dispute to that. The
appellees contend that the practice is illegal.

We think it

is legal.
Let me just briefly — I would come to it later, but
let me just briefly refer to what the practice has been and
what the record shows.
One of the banks in Washington, the fifth largest

21

bank, the Old national Bank itself has assisted in the
organization of five banks which it subsequently acquired.
And according to the deposition of a Mr. Witherspoon, who is
the chairman of the board of the Old National Bank, they
assisted and sponsored these banks,and I quote, "with the hope
and belief that we would be able to acquire them in the future
and make branches of the Old National there."
That's at page 608 of the record.
He also stated in his deposition that they had
informed the Comptroller of what they intended to do, the
way he described it, as inform the Comptroller of their
efforts to establish branches by this means — that's at page
610, and when he was asked did the Comptroller object to this,
he said, on the contrary, in one instance it was the
Comptroller, that is, rather, the Assistant Comptroller, in
the presence of the Comptroller, who suggested that they
follow this practice.
And in approving, subsequently approving the
mergers of banks in the State of Washington, between the
sponsoring bank and the sponsored bank, the Comptroller has
recognized that the bank did play this role.
Now, the acquiring bank in this case, the National
Bank of Commerce itself on one occasion sponsored a bank in
tiie so--called Columbia Shopping Center.
The claim is that they had no intention of ever

22

acquiring ifc.

Well, this record shows that for months on end

a number of important officials of the National Bank of
Commerce were concerned with all the details, all the
details of this bank.

They aided in — they helped find a

manager for the bank, on one occasion the board of directors
of the National Bank of Commerce personally selected a?man
who subsequently declined the post to be the president of this
new bank.

■,
And, as they say, they said: Well, we hope to be

able to acquire the bank.

And it seems to us, in the light

of this, it's much more than they hoped.

They obviously

anticipated that they would be able to do that.
On another occasion there's an .internal memorandum
in which, in 1971, the director of marketing research for
the National Bank of Commerce suggested to an assistant vice
president of the bank that perhaps it might — to quote the
word he used —- "sponsor" a bank in another small city in
Oregon, Pullman.

That's shown in the record.

f

QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, did CNB acquire this bank

that you say was sponsored by it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:QUESTION:

That has not yet come to pass.

What does it require in terms of waiting

period?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

There's no waiting period with

respect to federally chartered banks; with respect to State

23

chartered banks, there's a requirement that except for the
consent of the State Superintendent of Banking, no bank can
sell any of its shares, a controlling interest, for ten years
from the time of acquisition.
But the normal theory of this is that we concede,
we concede, that you could not, under State law, form and
sponsor a bank solely for the purpose of acquiring it, or
with an express intention — express understanding or agree­
ment ““ to do so.
The way it's done is the bank is sponsored, it has
to be on its own two feet, it has to get going, and at that
point, then the acquisition takes place.

HR. FRIEDMAN:

Does that conceal your intentions?
Well, I wouldn't say conceal.

wouldn't say conceal, Mr, Justice.

that this is a recognised technique in the State of Washington

permitted, -QUESTION: What's the total number of banks that
have been established as sponsored banks and later acquired

MR. FRIEDMAN:
tell you exactly that.

I could not tell you — I couldn't
The record shows, I think, that between

1960 and 1967 there were, I believe, fourteen banks acquired
in the State of Washington.

I don't know that the record

24

shows which of those were sponsored and subsequently acquired.
We do know — we do know, Mr. Justice, however, that
at least five banks there were sponsored by the Old National
Bank were subsequently acquired by that bank in the State of
Washington.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Friedman, even if the

acquisition doesn't take place, the fact of organization of
the new bank by the efforts of an established organization is
undisputed?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I'm sorry, I'm not — your question

is, you mean, there's no question that the existing organiza­
tion does organize the bank.

Oh, yes, there's no question

about that.

as I will come to, that we think was available as a toe-hold
entry by this bank.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION: But there's no particular legal barriers
to new entries in the Spokane area by just new banking
organizations?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

By just — no, this new banking

organization — in fact, this new banking organization now
has four branches? since it started with the single one, it's

26

grown and now has four branches, which is only three fewer
than the National — the Washington Trust Bank.
QUESTION;

Now, why do you say, Nr. Friedman, that

your point isn't made as" well, whether or not the newly
organized unit is later acquired?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I think if the — if the newly

organized unit is not later acquired, you don't -—and it
may be more difficult to say that the punitive acquiring
bank is eliminated as a substantial competitor.

That is,

what I'm suggesting is if —
QUESTION:

Well,

if he's eliminated, he certainly

is eliminated as a possible source of the impetus and energy
and perhaps support to organize a new bank?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, if the new bank — if the new

bank is — once the new bank has been organized and once the
new bank is in the market, that ~~
QUESTION:

And it's a competitor, yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

— that is a competitor.

Now, that

fact itself of course does not necessarily eliminate the
sponsoring bank as an entrant to the market, although —
QUESTION:

Well, it isn't about to organize another

one to compete with its new bank.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, the problem there, I suppose, is

whether the market would stand two additional banks.

In other

words, it may, depending again on — its relationship, ordin»

27
arily the relationship,, as one would expect, between the
sponsoring and the sponsored bank is very close» They
normally have their correspondent relationship, and so on»
But the fact is that, of course, this does inject a
new

a new — bank into the market» But the question really,

it seems to me, is whether, fairly viewed, if the acquiring
bank —
QUESTION;
NBC, is-going

1 doubt if

I doubt if the bank, the

if it acquires the bank in Spokane, which

it has or wants to, is about to turn around and organize
another bank in —
MR» FRIEDMAN:

Surely not.

QUESTION; Whether it ever acquired it or not.
MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION;

Surely not.

Mr. Friedman, I had understood that the

government, in effect, conceded that it has no case under
the theory of potential competition, unless it is legally
feasible and economically justifiable to enter the Spokane
market.

That is, for NBC to enter that market.

Is that

correct?
MR. FRIEDMAN;
The question we pose:

I think that is correct, Mr. Justice.
On what basis is the trial court to

decide those questions?
QUESTION; Right.

Well, you suggested two methods of

entry, and you've been talking so far about the sponsored

method, and your other suggested method is that you acquire
some smaller bank.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's right.

And we think there

are two banks in the market that it could have acquired.
One of them is the American Commercial Bank, which we've
been discussing, that was organised in 19 65 — I'm sorry if
I said 1955.

It was organized in 1965, which is a bank with

15 million in deposits, four branches in the City of Spokane,
roughly three percent of the market.
Now, the reason that the District Court held and the
defendants contend this would not be a suitable candidate for
acquisition is that under the ten-year limitation under State
law, and this of course is a State organized bank, this bank
would not be available for acquisition until 1975.
Again, my answer to that is we're dealing here with
very long-term trends.

The question is whether, if the

National Bank of Commerce would not be permitted to go into
the market through this merger, is it a rasonable likelihood
that they would have found some other way to go in?
Now, in addition to this other bank, there's anothe:
bank, the Farmers and Merchants Bank, which is a little
smaller, it has three offices; these, of course, are offices
in the suburbs, and the interest of the National Bank of
Washington in this bank, I think, is shown by the fact that
shortly before the merger they were discussing a possible

29

acquisition.
QUESTION;

Mr. Friedman, supposing that the National

Bank of Washington had decided to absorb the *65 formed bank,
the American Commerce Bank in Spokane, you say it has only
three fewer branches than Washington Trust.

Wouldn’t the

government probably have challenged that merger, too, as having
been anti-competitive?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, Mr. Justice.

No, Mr. Justice.

Our position is that the — we do not oppose, we do not oppose
the entry by large Statewide banks into local and regional
banking markets. But we say those -- that entry should take
place in the least anti-competitive way.

And we think an

entry, if they had acquired, attempted to acquire this bank,
with only three percent of the market, we would have viewed
that as a so-called permissible toe-hold acquisition.
QUESTION: Well, then it just becomes a question of
degree, doesn't it?

And the District Court has got to have

some latitude in making a finding one way or the other, I
would think.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, but the District Court did

not find, Mr. Justice, the District Court did not find that
this was no different than a toe-hold acquisition. The
District Court did not — and I think that at some point the
matter of degree becomes a matter of quality.

It's not just

quantity, because when they acquire a bank with 22 percent

30

of the market, that, to us, is a very different thing from
acquiring a bank with three percent of the markets

If they

acquire a bank with three percent of the market, they're hot
going to be satisfied, it seems to me, a bank like the

‘ •

National Bank of Commerce, with coming into Spokane with three
percent of the market and sitting there with three percent of
the market.

They are going to compete as vigorously as

possible, and attempt to get into that market and to expand
their share of the market.
Whereas, if all they do is acquire this 22 percent
share, they're in the typical situation where you have a
small number, three in this case, of the banks with 92 percent
of the market.
What you have is you have the same basic structure
inside the market, and you don't have the same kind of
incentive to compete, to inject some new vigor into the
market to possible deconcentrate the market, that you would
have if they came in by acquiring a small bank, a bank with
a very small share, which would be the basis for growing.
Now, let me turn to something else, which is —* we've
been discussing how they get in, I think it's important to
find out is is it the sort of thing that they are likely to do?
do they want to get in to Spokane, how important was it to
this bank to get into Spokane.
So that if they were unable, if they were unable to

31

gei: in by making this large acquisition, they would do every­
thing they could to get in by some other method.
We think there’s no question about that, that this is
one of the tilings that the National Bank of Commerce has
wanted to do for a long, long time.
To begin with, although the National Bank of Commerce
is the second largest bank in the State, it's the only one
bank that is represented in only one of the four largest
cities, it is represented only in Seattle; it is not
represented in Spokane, the second largest, Tacoma or
Everett, the next three largest cities in the State.
The parties to this case stipulated that representa­
tion in Spokane has been a long-sought goal of NBC.

That’s

at 367 of the record.
The former president of the National Bank of
Commerce, who is now the president of Marine Bancorporation,
which is the bank holding company that has all of the stock
of the bank, stated that his bank has been interested in
getting into Spokane for a long, long time.

Ha said, since

prior to 1933; roughly more than forty years.
He explained in a deposition that it was important
for the National Bank of Spokane to get in there, because
all the other major banks are represented there; and he says,
"We feel there is business available to us in Spokane if we
are represented there."

That's at page 139 of the record.

32
And similarly in its 1970 report to stockholders,
the holding company, in commenting on this merger, said that
this finally brought the National Bank of Commerce, quote,
"within sight of one of its long-sought goals, representation
in the City of Spokane."

That's at page 1270 of the record.

And, indeed, in a brief filed with the Comptroller
in support of this merger, a so-called economic brief, dis­
cussing the economics of the area and probably the economics
of the merger itself, what the bank said was, and I quote
again from page 1743, that "If Commerce is to maintain its
present relative position with its competitors and maintain
the business of its major national customers, Commerce must
have representation in Spokane" «— "must" was the word they
used, not that they’d like to, not that they thought it was
so, they must have representation in Spokane.
QUESTION:

Well, if they've been wanting this foi­

ls years, Mr. Friedman, that means they've been keeping their
eyes open for opportunities, I would assume, does it not?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

And one example, I suppose,

Mr. Justice, one example was their attempt shortly before this
merger took place, to purchase the stock of the American
Commercial —
QUESTION: But you don't suggest there's anything
per se throng or questionable about their wanting to get into
that market?

33

MR» FRIEDMAN3

No, no, no, no.

I’m sorry, Mr.

Justice, I’m sorry, I didn't make myself clear.
QUESTION; Nell, —
MR. FRIEDMAN:

We're not suggesting there is

anything wrong, in fact, it's quite understandable and quite
appropriate for this bank to want to get into the Spokane
market.

What we are arguing is the fact that this bank was

so anxious and felt it so important to get into Spokane is
clear indication, and shows that it would have done everything
it could to try to get in by these alternative means, if it
were nto permitted to go in by acquiring this large bank in
the market now.
And I’d like to reserve the balance of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Friedman.

Mr. Moen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. A. MOEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE MARINE BANCORPORATION
MR. MOEN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
There isn't any question about the desire of the
National Bank of Commerce to get into the Spokane market.
But if

the question is whether or not they would be

willing to go in in any manner other than this one, of this
particular merger.
There are four principal banking markets in the

34
State of Washington:

Seattle, Everett, Tacoma, and Spokane,

At the present time the National Bank of Commerce
has all of its offices in the Seattle market.

It does not ha’

any representation in any of the other three markets.

But of

course if some acceptable means of entry were to*be developed
they would be very happy to go into that market.
Mr. Friedman referred to the trends, and although
there's no specific finding on the subject, the evidence in
this case shows that there is no discernible trend in the
State of Washington toward concentration of banking.
As a matter of fact, the number of banks have
In 1960 there were 87 banks; today there are 92,

increased.

In I960 there were 378 banking offices in Washingto:
today there are 681.
If you want to look at the share of the market.
During the past ten years the share of the market, which
Commerce has picked up, has increased, from 18,9 in I960 co
19.1 today.
So that the share of the market is practically
constant.
So whether you look at the number of banks, or you
look at the number of branches, or whether you look at the
share of the market, there is. no discernible trend in the
State of Washington towards concentration.
Now, Justice is really asserting in three ways in

35
•this merger in which, if consummated,, will lessen competition
so as to violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act.
First, they contend that but for this merger these
two banks will some day be in direct competition.

Now, of

course this can happen only in the event that the two banks
get offices in the same market.

Either Commerce will hcive to

move into the Spokane maxket, or the Washington Trust Bank
is going to have to move out and into some market where
Commerce is doing business.
They make a second contention as to the violation
of the Act, in that they argue that Commerce is now on the
fringe of the market, and exerts some competitive influence
on the competitors that are in the market.
The argument upon which they lay the greatest
stress is that, but this merger, these two banks will become
direct competitors; and if the merger is enjoined, Commerce
will enter Spokane by establishing a branch of its bank de
novo, or what they call tantamount to de novo, that's this
sponsored bank procedure, or by foothold entry.
Now, the Court has asked some questions with respect
to foothold entry.
The trial court made a finding that there is no
bank in Spokane today which could serve as a foothold entrant.
There are only two banks in the City of Spokane which are
smaller than Washington Trust Bank,

One is the American

36
Commercial Bank, the State bank to which Mr. Friedman alluded.
That bank was formed in 1965, but it has in its charter a
prohibition against its merger or its sale or combination with
any other bank for a period of ten years.
QUESTION;
MR* MOEN;

That's required by law, isn't ic?
That's required by a statute of idle State

of Washington.
QUESTION;

Right.

MR. MOEN;

Well, that period will expire in 1975,

But, of course, the National Bank of Commerce or no one else
has any knowledge or information at this time that that bank
will be for sale at the end of the ten-year period.

And even

if it were for sale, of course there's no assurance -that
National Bank of Commerce would be the successful purchaser.
These banks, like any other product, are sold to
whoever makes the highest bid.

And if this bank were for

sale, which we have no reason to believe it would be, it
would undoubtedly go to the highest bidder, which might be
■idle Bank of Commerce or it might be one of its competitors.
They have also argued —
QUESTION;

Then there's the other, the other small

MR. MOEN;

The Farmers and Merchants Bank,

bank.
But the

Farmers and Merchants Bank is not within the City of Spokane.
QUESTION;

It's in the suburbs.

37

MR. MOEN:

The Farmers and Merchants Bank has a

branch in a shopping center about five or six miles east of
the center of downtown Spokane.
So we contend that even giving in to —■ if we were
to acquire the Farmers and Merchants Bank, it would not be
entry into Spokane.
All of the witnesses concede that you can't service
downtown Spokane or be a part of the Spokane market if your
only branch is out in the suburbs.
QUESTION:

Once you were there, would the lav/

forbid coming in -—
MR. MOEN:

Once you're there, you still can’t

get into the City of Spokane.
QUESTION;

Is it the same county, or what's the

MR. MOEN;

It's in the same county.

problem?
But you can't

go into the city. The only banks in the city that can get a
branch in the city are the banks that have their head office
in the city.
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION:

If you acquire a bank by a merger, that

becomes a bx’anch of the acquiring bank from which no other
branches can be put out under Washington lav/,
MR. MOEN;

That is correct.

The branches that —

or the bank that you may acquire, such as Washington Trust

38

Bank, can go out and establish new brandies in the City of
Spokane.

But once the National Bank of Commerce acquires the

Washington Trust Bank/ then it cannot — can no longer branch
in the City of Spokane, or in the county.
It can branch only in the city where it has its
principal place of business, and in the county where it has
its principal place of business.
QUESTION:

You made a pass at acquiring -— what —

Farmers and Merchants?
MR, MOENs

There were negotiations for the purchase

of the Farmers and Merchants Bank.
close in price.

They didn't even get

I think the record here shows that Commerce

had a price in mind of somewhere, maybe, one and a half or
two million dollars; and the lowest asking price was somewhere??
in the area of five million dollars.
The negotiations didn't even get to the point where
the amount of money which Commerce was willing to pay was
even transmitted to the Farmers and Merchants people.
QUESTION: And how long before this present acquisition
did those negotiations occur?
MR, MOEN:

I would say maybe a year or two.

Just a very short time.
But I would like to impress upon the Court the fact
that acquisition of Farmers and Merchants does not put you
into tine City of Spokane.

39

QUESTION!

So that the National Bank's

acquisition of Farmers and Merchants Bank, if it had come
about, would not have been a realisation of their desire to
get into the City of Spokane?
MR» MOEN:

It would not have given them entrance

into the City of Spokane,
Now, our defense to this case is not only legal but
actual,

We think that this case primarily is a factual case.

And the trial court rejected all three of the arguments of
the Justice Department, and assigned a factual basis for all
of them»
The trial court found that even in Idle absence of
these statutes the bank, the National Bank of Commerce, would
not go into downtown Spokane if they had to go in by de novo
entry or by the acquisition of a small toe-hold bank.
The court found that it wouldn't be compatible with
prudent business practice in commercial banking for a major
full-service bank, such as Commerce, to enter a major
metropolitan area such as Spokane with a limited-service bank,
or a small bank which wotild. be compatible with the amount of
deposits that they might reasonably expect to obtain.
As we've just mentioned, if they did go in they
couldn't branch, and branching in Washington is almost
essential to effective competition in a metropolitan area
such as Spokane

40

There happens to be a very good example in the City
of Spokane of the imprudence of attempting to go in with a
small branch.
The Pacific National Bank is a subsidiary of
Western Bancorporation, the largest bank holding company
west of the Mississippi.

It's the third largest bank in

the State of Washington.
Now, ten years ago, in 1964, it did in fact go in to
the City of Spokane by a toe-hold entry, by acquiring a small
branch, or a small bank which had two branches, one in
downtown Spokane and one out on Whitworth College campus.
Since that time, in ten years, they have not been able to
increase their share of the market.

Today they are the

smallest bank in Spokane, measured by Spokane deposits, and
there's really no reason to believe that if Commarce attempted
to go in by foothold that they could do any better than Pacific
National Bank has done.
The growth in Spokane during the last ten years
has been slow. The lower court found that there has been
some growth in the last ten years.

I think the town has in

fact lost 10,000 population, and the county has grown about
three percent.
Now, this compares with other markets, where
Commerce isn't now located, such as Everett, which has
increased 10,000 during the period that Spokane has lost

41
10,000? and the county in which Everett is located has
increased in population almost 35 percent.
The City of Tacoma, which is another market in which
Commerce isn't — doesn't presently have offices, has
actually increased about 15,000.
Now, the importance of this is simply that if
Commerce did decide that they wanted to go into one of these
other markets, they wanted to spend their capital for that
purpose, the chances are that -they would go into Everett or
Tacoma much sooner than they would go into Spokane.

And this

was just another reason that the court assigned as to his
finding as to why it was not likely that Commerce would go
into Spokane if they had to go in by de novo entry.
The Regional Administrator of National Banks in
Washington took the stand and testified that in his opinion
it was not likely that there would be any future charters for
banks granted in Spokane in the reasonably foreseeable future.
He based this on the population growth of the city, and such
other factors as the Comptroller considers in passing on
new bank applications.
Now, as I said, we have these factual findings.
What the court really found was that there just wasn't
sufficient economic incentive to put Commerce into Spokane,
if they had to go in on a de novo basis. And of course, in
addition to that, we have these statutory barriers that Mr.

4l~A

Friedman alluded to.
The statute which prohibits branching in Washington
is found in Remington's Code of Washington 30.40.020.

It's

reproduced as pages 4 and 5 of our brief, and I would like
to call the Court's particular attention to the last
paragraph of the statute, which appears on page 4.
Nov;, this statute provides, just as plainly as it
can provide, in so far as it's pertinent to this case, that
Commerce cannot go into Spokane with a de novo branch.
Justice argues that the statute may be evaded or
circumvented, and entry tantamount to de novo entry may be
achieved by a so-called sponsored bank procedure.
I would also like to tell the Court this, that this
word "sponsor'5 has been a very misleading x^crd in this case,
because practically all new banks in Washington are sponsored
in one way or another when they'3:e formed.

And the Comptroller

of course encourages this, because it's beneficial both to
the sponsoring bank as well as to the sponsored bank.
But that does not mean that they have control of
the bank or that they can branch when they want to.
For example, Commerce, which has 107 branches,
testified that they don't have one single branch that was ever
a sponsored bank — I mean a bank that they sponsored.

It's

true that they assist these banks in various ways, but
Columbia Center was brought up here.

There's -- both the

4?.

chairmen of Columbia Center testified that they're not
obligated to sell their bank to Commerce at any time, either
the assets of the bank or the stock*
And the officers of Marine Bancorporation testified
that they have no agreement, either oral or written, to
acquire the bank at any time.
QUESTION:

Now, it's true that they —

Mr. Moen, I'm have a little trouble

with -- you say you can help the bank and assist the new
bank, but you don't sponsor it.
MR. MOEN:

What do you mean by sponsor?

The word "sponsor1", as we've used it,

means to aid or assist,

I think the word "sponsor", as

Justice has referred to it, means to have control of it, so
that they can force the sale of the bank.
QUESTION: Well, which one are you talking about?
You said there's not a single one of your branch banks that
you sponsored, but you did assist them.

Now, where is the

line in your book?
MR. MOEN:

Well, the sponsored bank procedure, as

referred to by the Justice Department, means to have control
of it.

What I'm saying is that Commerce has never acquired

any bank in which they even assisted.

And of course the only

bank that I could say that they ever sponsored was Columbia
Center.
I would concede that they sponsored that bank; but
even there they sponsored it in the sensa that they went out

43

and they helped it get. management, they helped it get
directors,

What really happened here was that the
QUESTION:

And it v/as just the interest of building

up competition?
f

MR. MOEN:
customer.

No, they do it to satisfy a commercial

The Allied Stores were putting a shopping center

into central Washington, and of course they wanted a banking
service there.
QUESTION:

Is this the suburban bank that was

referred to?
MR. MOEN:

No, it isn't, we referred to the bank of

Farmers and Merchants.
QUESTION;
MR. MOEN:

This is in the City of Spokane?
No, I think what Mr. Justice Marshall is

referring to is a bank in central Washington.
QUESTION; Columbia.
MR. MOEN;

Yes, Columbia Center.

Yes.

Now, it's true that in that bank, in that particular
case, in order to bring banking service into the community,
Coromerce did, I would say, sponsor a bank, in the sense that
they went out and helped them get management, they furnished
him with about three directors out of seven.

But the important

thing, to me, is the purpose for which this was done.
This is not a case where Commerce, deciding they
wanted to get into the bank and sent out people to

or stock-

44
holders to organize a bank.

What really happened was that

the business people of the city applied for a bank and they
were turned down, by the Regional Administrator, for the
reason that they did not have anyone in their organization
that had any particular knowledge of banking.

And so they

came to the National Bank of Commerce and sought that
assistance, and they obtained it*
But here'again, as I say, that doesn't give
Commerce any assurance that they are ever going to acquire
that bank.

,

*

And the- only thing that’s important with respect to
this procedure is whether or not it affords the Commerce some
method of getting into the city.
here is means of entry.

What we are talking about

We contend we don't have any means

of entry into Spokane, that we're barred by our statutes.
They come back and say we can get into Spokane, and
they can get in in this particular manner which they call the
sponsored bank method. And we deny that.
Now, what I'm saying is that so far as Columbia
Center is concerned, that that does not afford to us a means
of entry into Spokane.
Now, let me mention these five branches, which Mr.
Witherspoon contended that the Old National Bank picked up.
They apparently did, on two occasions they actually sent some­
one out to attempt to organize the bank and obviously, or

45

Mr. Witherspoon said, for the purpose of actually acquiring
the bank.
Now, the record isn't entirely clear, as to just
what they did.

But what I contend is that it really doesn't

make much difference.

One of these arrangements was made in

1959, two cf them were made in 1962, and two of them were
made in 1964,
And since that time, so far as this record shows,
there hasn’t been any such acquisitions or any such means of
entry by any other bank.
My co-counsel here has given me a note to make it
clear that Columbia Center is not in Spokane.

But I think

I answered that question, that it’s down in central Washington.
QUESTION:
MR. MOEN:

Is it down on the Columbia River?
It's down in Kennewick, or in the Richland

area, which is near the Columbia River area.
Now, as I've said, that this statute which prevents
us from branching in Washington is one statute which we're
concerned with,
There's a second statute, a holding company
statute, which prohibits any bank holding company in Washington
from owning or controlling more than 25 percent of the capital
stock of another bank.

Nov;, I point that out to show that

we're not only stopped from branching, but we're also stopped
from holding company expansion? because the holding company

46
can't possibly own more than 25 percent of the stock of a
bank, and of course you cannot control either the sale of the
bank or the purchaser of the bank, if you only have a 25 percent control.
In Washington you have to have 67 percent of the
stock of the bank, you have to have the consent of 67 percent
of the shareholders before you can sell.
So that on this holding company statute, we have
neither -— we don't have the power to expand in that way.
The penalty for violating the statute is forfeiture
of the holding company charter.
So no prudent person is going to attempt to expand
in that manner.
Now, with respect to the so-called wing theory.
Justice is also contending that Commerce, by reason of its
position in the wings, exerts a beneficial pro-competitive
influence on the competitors in the market.
Justice concedes, on page 27 of their brief, that
this was not the primary basis upon which they tried the
case? but it is in the pleadings, and it was mentioned by two
or three witnesses.
But I'd like to point out that in this respect all
they showed was the proximity to the market, and there's
utterly no evidence in the record to show that they had any
effect upon the competitors in the market.

So that the mere

47
physical proximity, of course, without any showing of an
effect on the competitors .in the market doesn't show, or
can't develop into any lessening of competition.
There were four witnesses for the bank, two bank
officers and two economists, who testified that Commerce.,
prior to the announcement of the merger, exerted no influence
at all on the Spokane market.
With respect to the Washington State Bank moving
out into other areas, I just want to point out that Justice
did not try to prove what banking markets or what sections
they might move out into, they simply argue that the bank
has the capability of expanding and -therefore its elimination
would be a 3.essening of competition under Section 7.
Novr, in conclusion, I want to point out that both
pairties in the case are urging what -they consider to be
pro-competitive action.

What the Justice Department's case

really boils down to is simply that they're saying that it's
pro-competitive to save Commerce for some future entrance
into the market.
We contend that if we move into the market right now,
a bigger bank, a much stronger bank, that that is also procompetitive.

It's — the trial court found that the Spokane

banking market, actually needs another competitor of the size of
Seattle First, and I think that the real issue for this Court

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You're now moving into

I'll bring my argument to a close.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE LOEVINGER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY
MR. LOEVINGER;

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I appear for the Comptroller of the Currency and, as
such, I believe I speak for the government.
Normally, of course, the Department of Justice
speaks for the government.

The Comptroller, however, is an

older agency than either the Solicitor General or the
Antitrust Division, and indeed older than the antitrust laws
themselves.
However, that is not the basis on which I assert
this.

The important point is that the Department of Justice

in these cases is interested only in protecting a single

49

element, the competitive element, in enforcing the antitrust
laws,
QUESTION;

What is the authority of the —-

MR. LOEVINGER: Sir?
QUESTION;

What is the authority of the Comptroller

of the Currency to represent himself in this Court?
MR, LOEVINGER:
QUESTION;

Statutory, Your Honor.

What does it say?

MR, LOEVINGER:

I don't have the statute at hand,

Mr, Justice? but it is — there is a statutory authority of
the Comptroller to appear in these cases, and, as such, he
represents the interest of the government embodied in both
the banking and the antitrust laws.
As I shall hope to demonstrate, the Comptroller is
interested not simply in banking interests but also in
competitive interests, and therefore represents the entire
public interest which I believe is the viewpoint of the
government.
QUESTION:

So I should ask the Department of Justice

what their authority is, I suppose.
MR. LOEVINGER:

In any event, I have six substantive

points that I hope to make.

I shall appear twice, and I hope

to be able to get to them, I will tell youwhat they are, and
then proceed to them.
First, tiie plaintiff's argument is basically

50
circular and question-begging, because it assumes that
Section 7 requires the banking agencies to permit de novo
entry.
Second, Section 7 does not supersede the federal
banking statutes, as plaintiff somewhat explicitly and
certainly implicitly contends.
Third, potential competition does not have the
same application to banking as to unregulated industries.
Fourth, the plaintiff's sponsorship scheme is not
only illegal dubious means of —- legally dubious means of
circumventing State lav;, but is actually anti-competitive in
its effect, as I shall demonstrate.
Five,, Section 7 does not forbid a merger which
lessens potential competition, but increases actual
competition in the relevant market, which is somewhat
different than the question left open in Falstaff.
And finally,

the plaintiff would rewrite Section

7 so that potentiality attentuates substantiality to
triviality.
Now, first, the plaintiff's argument is basically
circular and question-begging, because although plaintiff
has the burden of proving the violation of Section 7, that
depends upon proving that the merger would probably lessen
competition.
Plaintiff admits there's no actual competition.

51
therefore the theory of plaintiff entirely is that absent a
merger the acquiring bank here would enter the market de novo.
This, however, requires the permission of the banking
authorities.
There is objective evidence that this permission
would not be given.

Plaintiff attempts to surmount this

barrier by assuming that administrative permission is
required, thus, in the brief in this case, at page 51, plaintiff
says, "it must be assumed that the regulatory decision will
reflect the national policy in favor of market extensions
by internal expansion rather than by acquisition."
There .is a similar statement in plaintiff's
Connecticut brief at page 53«,
Thus, plaintiff’s entire argument is based upon the
assumption that Section 7 requires the permission of the
administrative authorities for de novo entry, and once you
eliminate that assumption, plaintiff does not have an
argument on potential competition.
the very matter to be proved.

But that assumption is

It’s the very question in issue

before this Court.
Therefore, it's an entirely circular and question­
begging argument.
Second, plaintiff in effect asserts that Section 7
supersedes the federal banking statutes.

Plaintiff clearly

argues that in a bank merger case involving potential competi-

52

tion, that Section 7 standards must be applied.

At page 52

of the brief in this case, plaintiff asserts —
QUESTION:

MR. LOEVINGER:

I say, I don't ~

I'm sorry,

Mr, Justice, I can't argue that -- I can't discuss that
question,
I would, if you will permit me, sir,
QUESTION:

I don't know, as of now, what the position

of the government is,
MR, LOEVINGER:

Well, may I proceed with my

argument, Mr. Justice?
QUESTION:

Why, of course!

[Laughter.]

54
MR. LOEVINGER:

I would like to point out that

the Department’s position is that Section 7 in effect
supersedes the federal banking statutes.

Thus, at page 52

of the Washington brief, it says "Only if new entry might
threaten the stability of existing, banks could the Comptroller
properly refuse to permit new competition."
Now, and again this is repeated in other briefs,
and in the plaintiff's reply brief in Connecticut, it argues
that the appropriate number of banks is not to be determined
by administrative or judicial fiat, but by the market,
through the processes of competition.
One wonders if the same statement would be made
about the ICC, the CAB and the FCC.
But, in any event, this is not the law.

In the

Philadelphia National Bank case, this Court, speaking through
Mr. Justice Brennan, said, and I quote, "A charter for a new
bank, State or national, will not be granted unless the
invested capital and management of the applicant and its
prospects for doing sufficient business to operate at a
reasonable profit, give adequate protection against undue
competition and possible failure,"
Now, there's no such policy embodied in the antitrust laws.

That is strictly a banking standard.

This role

was not changed by the Bank Merger Act of 1966, and in the
Third National Bank in Nashville, this Court said;

The purpose

55

of the Bank Merger Act of 166 was to permit certain bank
mergers, even though they tended to lessen competition,,
Congress felt that the role of banks in a
community's economic life was such that the public interest
would sometimes be served by a bank merger, even though the
merger lessened competition»
QUESTION: But that statement was about the defensive
part of the — that was added in 1966, was it not, the
basic competitive analysis?
MR» LOEVINGER:

The Court said that the basic

competitive analysis was to made first, and then the public
interest was to be determined on the basis of the competitive
analysis as balanced against the other interest.
However, as I shall point out, what happens in a
potential merger case is to merge? that you don't have the
cleancut kind of dichotomy that you do in an actual
competition case, where first you see that competition is
being extinguished.

And the reason for that is very simple?

is that in a potential competition case, which you are talking
about, is potential entry»
But there is no potential entry unless there is a
community need, and service to the community convenience by
that entry.
Therefore, before there can be a potential entry
or a probable entry, as this Court has held, there must be a

56

showing of the convenience and needs argument.
Consequently, in a potential competition case, it
seems to me as a matter of logic that the Department has the
burden of meeting both sides of the equation.

They have to

show both that there is a ~~ well, they don't even get to
competition until they have dealt with community need.
Because without community need and probable entry, there is
no potential competition.
QUESTION:

But that would be true just of a

nationally chartered bank, wouldn't it?
MR. LOEVINGER:

No, sir.

That would be true of

both national and State banks, as was pointed out in the
Philadelphia case,

because the standards are essentially

similar.
There are some differences.
Now, potential — and this is the reason why I
say that potential competition theory does not have the
same application to banking as to unregulated industries.
The purpose of regulating and limiting the entry
into the banking field is to protect the public interest in
bank functioning and bank solvency.

As the Ninth Circuit

has said, a bank failure is a community disaster.
We cite data in our brief from Mr. Paul. Samuels on,
the noted economist, about bank failures.

Bank failures are

not altogether a thing of the past, although they have been

57
largely minimized.
Only last October one of the largest bank failures
in the history of the country occurred, the U. S. National
Bank in San Diego, a billion-doilar bank failure.
There have been some bank closings every year since
1934, there have been 635 bank closings because of financial
difficulty.

The FDIC now has 156 banks on its problems list.

The entry into banking requires a showing of
community need, of prospective profitability, and of other
factors subject to judgment by administrative expertise.
Furthermore, even the perceived entry, as distinguishe
from the actual entry, which Mr. Justice Marshall distinguished
in his concurring opinion in Falstaff, is different in
banking»

Because, in an ordinary industry, the contending

and competing units must look at those standing on the fringes
to see whether economic factors are likely to move them
into the market.
However, in banking, if one of those standing on
the fringes wants to enter the market, he must make application to an administrative agency, without exceptions, State or
national, and the banks in the market have an opportunity to
go in and to be heard and to oppose the entry of the new
entrant.
Consequently, there is no unperceived entry.

There

is no unperceived potential entrant in banking, as there may

58

be in other cases.
Furthermore, the determination of the propriety of
the organization of a new bank and its entry into the market,
this Court has said is specifically a matter for determination
by the banking agencies; and, therefore, I submit, it is not
appropriate for determination in a case such as the present
one.
In the Whitney National Dank, a New Orleans case,
which is a very complicated case, explained at page 55 of the
Marine Banc brief, basically in order to avoid the restrictions
of State laws, the branch in Whitney formed a bank holding
company, as the Department would have the defendant banks
do here, and it organized a new bank*
There was litigation below which resulted in an
injunction against the bank charter being issued.
When the case came to this Court, thi3 Court held
that the lower courts have no jurisdiction to pass upon that
question and remanded the matter to the Federal Reserve
Board, the banking agency in that case, saying:
concluded ,

We have

the District Court, that it is the exclusive

function of the Federal Reserve Board to act in such cases.
In cases raising issues of facts, not within the conventional
experience of judges, or cases requiring the exercise of
administrative discretion, agencies created by Congress for
regulating the subject matter should not be passed over.

59

Therefore, we submit that this Court should not,
by engrafting the potential competition theory onto Section
7 and then applying that to banking, pass over the expertise
of the banking agencies as to who and when there should be
entry into the banking field, which is what potential
competition means, potential entry.
Nov;, let me say a word about the sponsorship scheme
proposed by the Department.
It is true, as my colleague, Mr. Moen, has said,
that there is a good deal of ambiguity about idle use of this
term "sponsorship".
In fact, there is evidence that banking executives,
like others in other businesses sometimes help new
institutions, that they give advice, old lawyers do this to
young lawyers, this is not an unknown procedure.

However,

sponsorship, as used in this case by the Department of
Justice, means, and I think must mean if it is to have
significance, the contribution of capital and the holding of
some sort of a significant

legal interest in a bank.

If it doesn't mean this, it means nothing.

Anybody

can go and get a franchise — I suppose I could go down and
ask my friendly banker how I go about organizing a bank.
However, in the first place, this method, if approved by this
Court, would be available only to national banks.

There is

no contention, and Mr. Friedman has conceded, it wouldn't be

60

available to State banks.
This immediately would destroy the competitive
equality between national and State banks, which Congress
clearly intended, as this Court has often said in cases cited
in our brief.
In the second place, this would undermine the dual
«
banking system and handicap the State banks by giving the
federal banks a technique not available to State banks.
Two-thirds of all the commercial banks in the country today
are State banks.

Only one-third are national.

They happen

to be the larger banks, but this would give the advantage
to the national banks.
Further, at best, this scheme is expensive,
difficulty and risky, and thus available not .only not to all
banks but only to the larger banks.

It i§ clear from the

records here that the cost of forming a holding company and
organizing a bank is upwards of two million dollars.

The

statutory minimum is a million and a half dollars.
However, of all the commercial banks in the United
States, 25 percent are under five million in deposits, 48
percent under ten million, and 78 percent under 25 million?
both State and federal.
And I submit that as a practical matter, this is a
method that would be available really only to the top five
percent of the banks in the United States.

61

Furthermore, this scheme would endanger new and
small banks by offering and threatening undue competition.
This appears in the record in the present case, at page 1034.
The Court asked the Department of Justice counsel, and I
quote:
"Your theory is that if a new bank went in there'1 —
Spokane — "they would take some deposits from the other banks,
and therefore the other banks wouldn't make as much money as
they are, and therefore it would increase competition.

Is

that your theory?”
And the Department counsel said:

"Yes, sir»"

In other words, new and small banks are likely to
be the victim of this procedure.

These are the ones that

are owned by small business and by the minority groups that
are struggling for recognition today.

These are the ones that

are protected by the bank regulatory agencies.
Under plaintiff's theory there would be no
protection.
Consequently, if plaintiff's sponsorship scheme were
approved by this Court, this would insure growth by the largest
banks, it would insure the foreclosure of markets to small
and medium-sized banks, and it would probably lead to the
failure of small banks and thus ultimately to the much
greater concentration of banking business in the United States.
Now, fifth, Section 7 does not forbid a merger which

62

lessens potential competition, but increases actual
competition in the relevant market.
I trust I need not point out to the Court that in
Falstaff, that the Court’s opinion said that the question
left open was whether a new entry that neither helped nor
hurt competition was illegal merely because it, the acquiring
company could but did not enter de novo.
■That question is not reached here, because in both
cases there is evidence that here the entry will make the
market more competitive.
The Court found in this case this merger will make
the Spokane market even more competitive, as it will replace
a bank with a limited competitive ability with one with
greater capacity to provide loans and it will remove iits
competitive disadvantage.
Now, plaintiff in effect answers this by saying
that, to the extent the Court relied on the theory the merger
would replace Washington Trust with a bank able to compete
more effectively, that these are factors to be considered
on the community needs and convenience defense and not in
asserting the competitive impact of the merger.
If I may be disrespectful, I say nonsense.

To say

that an increase in competition cannot be considered in
appraising the competitive impact simply doesn’t make sense
under the antitrust laws or under any other laws.

63

In fact, Justice Marshall, in concurring in Falstaff,
said that if a company would have remained outside the market
but for the possibility of entry by acquisition, and if it is
exerting no influence as a perceived potential entrant, there
will then normally be no competitive loss when it enters by
acquisition.
Indeed, there may even be a competitive gain, to the
extent that strengthens the market position of the acquired
firm, which is exactly the case here,
Furthermore, in Brown Shoe, this Court saids Congress
recognized the stimulation to competition that might flev;
from particular mergers.
expressed,

When concern as to the Act was

supporters of the amendment indicated it \tfould

not impede, for example, a merger between two small companies
to enable the competition to compete more effectively with
larger corporations dominating the relevant market.
Here, admittedly, there's no change in market
structure or concentration.

There is only a strengthening

of one competitor, which has already stimulated new
competition in Spokane, as we point out at page 53 of our
brief, and this does not lessen competition, but it increases
competition, which is the purpose of Section 7.
Finally, let me come to my last point, last formal
point, and then I will either now or later answer some points
of the Department, that the plaintiff would rewrite Section 7,

64
so that'potentiality really reduces substantiality to
triviality.
There has been some talk as to what potentiality
..i*'-'

means and Mr. Friedman has candidly said they're looking at
very long-range effects.
As a matter of fact, this was confirmed by a speech
by the Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the
Antitrust Division, made the day after we filed our brief,
and published in ATRR April 16th, 1974.
pages D-l to 5.

In which he said:

It’s No. 699, at

The Department's

concern for preserving competition is premised upon the
belief that existing market structures are not immutable
over time.

Changes in law, technology, business philosophy

and the imperatives of the marketplace may result in future
market entry with attendant increase in competition, in a
manner which would not have been predicted at an earlier time.
The Department's efforts, he candidly states, are
aimed at these market extension cases, which- involve theories
of potential competition.

■

Now, I submit that to say the potential competition,
which the Department of Justice is now protecting, is the
possibility of future market entry in some presently
unpredictable or unforeseeable manner is to say that we are
dealing with something that is improbable. The law simply
cannot deal with the unpredictable or the unforeseeable.

65

The essence of legal probability is foreseeability.

Thus

the plaintiff is seeking to have the. standard of proof in
Section 7 cases reduced from probability and substantiality
to possibility and triviality.
Plaintiff asks the Court to forbid any merger which
might foreclose any unforeseeable future possibility of
competition.

But it is impossible to do because the

unforeseeable we cannot deal with,,

This is unreasonable,

unworkable, unprecedented and, I submit, a formula for
stagnation not competition.
Furthermore, in my brief I have submitted to the
Court that I believe that this standard, if it becomes
established in the lav?, is a formula that will -threaten
civil liberties.

The brief was filed April Sth,

I suggested

that potential enemies in authoritarian countries are
prosecuted as the Department would go after potential
competitors here.
On April 15th, the week after we filed our brief,
the Washington Star-New published a little item saying that
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the well-known Russian author, had
been exiled because, it was said by a leading Russian spokesman,
he was guilty of making, I quote, "potentially dangerous
proposals."

It is said that he was accused of writing

Utopian and potentially dangerous ideas.
Now, if this is the language of authoritarianism,

66

this is the doctrine which the Department of Justice would
have this Court accept and which I submit, if accepted in
these cases, cannot be confined to these cases.
If potentiality, in the sense of unforeseeability,
unpredictability, that which cannot really be met by present
proof, cannot be dealt with on the basis of the contemporary
record, then there are simply no standards.

There is no way

that we can deal with the data presented with the evidence
if the Court is going to permit this kind of proof.
My time is up, thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you.

Mr. Friedman, you have about four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR* FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
There's been some reference by Mr. Moen to the
testimony of the president of the Columbia Bank, the bank
that was sponsored, and we refer to the Columbia Bank, not
that that's a way of getting into Spokane, but to show, to
show that this is a method by which banks do enter markets,
where they are not permitted directly to branch.
I'd like to invite the Court's attention to two
documents in the record. The first is at page 1514 of the
record.

It's a letter from Mr. Buck, who is the senior vice

67
president of the National Bank of Commerce to a Mr. Loney.
Mr. Loney was an attorney in the area where the Columbia Bank
was being formed, who became ~~ he had done some work for the
branch of the National Bank of Commerce in this area, and he
ultimately became the chairman of the board of the new bank.
So he was a man who was intimately concerned in the formation
of the bank and understanding what was happening.
How, two paragraphs I'd like to refer to.

The first

is in the middle of that page, at 1514, he said that there’s
been no — Mr. Buck said there has been no written or oral
agreement or understanding with respect to acquisition of the
proposed bank.

"Upon advice of counsel we have been extremely

{perhaps excessively) cautious to avoid this."
"It is true, nevertheless, that our bank has inspired
submission of the application and. is hopeful that at an
appropriate future time it will be possible to acquire the
bank for incorporation within its

present system."

And then at the bottom of the page he pointed out
tiiat the way the bank was being arranged, "The majority stock
will be in hands friendly to the National Bank of Commerce in
order to insure as much as possible its future as a branch
of that bank, yet avoid certain legal problems which could
arise if it were not to agree or contract vzith respect to
its acquisition."
Then at page 1573 is a letter from Mr, Loney back to

68

Mr. Buck, written a few months later.

And these letters were

all contemporaneously written at the time the Columbia Bank
was being organized.
What Mr. Loney said to Mr, Buck, at the bottom of
page 1573 is, quote:

"We need a clear definition and under­

standing of the management responsibilities as between the
directors of the unit bank and the management of the National
Bank of Commerce."
That's between the bank that was sponsoring and
the bank that was sponsored.
"For example, many of the steps taken initially will
have a bearing on the long range operation of the bank many
years after it has changed from a unit bank to a branch
bank."
This seems to us to indicate very clearly that the
whole purpose of this arrangement was ultimately to permit
the National Bank of Commerce to acquire it.
Now, Mr. Loevinger has suggested that because the
authorization of the regulatory authorities is needed before
a bank can enter the market, if the regulatory authorities
suggest, they would not charter a new bank; that's kind of the
end of the tiling.
Well, to begin with, I just point out that that
argument of course has no application to the possibility of
entry by making a foothold acquisition.

But more fundamentally

69

it seems to us this is basically not the scheme of Section 7.
This is not — what Congress did not intend to give the
Comptroller of the Currency the authority to veto,the authority
to veto the enforcement of Section 7 of the Clayton Act»
When the Comptroller says that he does not think
it's likely that he would charter a new bank.

To begin with,

of course, his testimony is given in defense of a merger that
he has already approved? but, more importantly, of course the
Regional Comptroller only makes the recommendation, but a
Regional official may think today he's not going to charter
it, tomorrow or next week changes may occur»
And we do believe that in this situation the
Comptroller's view that he would not permit a new bank to be
chartered cannot be dispositive on this question.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Friedman.

The case is submitted,
thereupon, at 11:38 o’clock, a.m„, the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted,3
