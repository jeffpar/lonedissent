PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 72-1628, Teleprompter Corporation against Columbia
.broadcasting, and Columbia Broadcasting against Teleprompter.
Mr. Barnard, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready and if you will help watch your time, I’ll help you,
too.
MR. BARNARD:

Thank you, your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF
ROBERT C. BARNARD, ESQ.,
MR. BARNARD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I represent Teleprompter Corporation, a
Community Antenna Television operator, Petitioner number
1628.

Columbia Broadcasting Company, CBS,and the other
copyright owners are petitioners In the conditional crosspetition, number 1633.
The two petitions have been consolidated for
argument and counsel have agreed that Teleprompter will
present its position first in both the petition and the
cross-petition.
CBS will respond and I will reply.
To avoid confusion as to who is petitioner and
respondent, I will refer to the parties as Teleprompter and

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you wish to save

five minutes for rebuttal, or more?
MR. BARNARD:

I would like to, your Honor.

CBS owns copyrights on works which CBS licenses
to broadcasters to be broadcast for reception by the public.
The other cross-petitioners are copyright owners who have,
by contract, granted to CBS the right to license their works
for broadcast.
Teleprompter

owns CATV Systems.

The reception

of the licensed broadcasts of the copyrighted works by five
of

Teleprompter’s CATV Systems in 1964, 1969 and 1971 is

alleged in the complaint to be a copyright infringement.
And portnightly

against United Artists, this

Court held that a CATV System which receives a broadcast and
makes the broadcast signal available to

suscribing members o

the public, does not perform the work which was broadcast.
Two issues are presented by these petitions:
First, the main petition, the so-called "distance
signal" issue.

Does the location of the CATV's receiving

antenna on which the broadcasts were received, more than
a few miles from the CATV community and the connection from
the antenna to the community by a microwavelength licensed
by the FCC, have copyright significance?
Trial court held it did not.

Court of Appeals

3
concluded that the antenna location and the connection to the
antenna have copyright significance.
Second, the conditional cross-petition raises the
issue whether the reception of a broadcast by a CATV System
is converted into a performance of the broadcast work, not by
what the CATV System did with reference to the broadcast,
copyrighted work, but

by reason of what the CATV System did

on separate channels, not used to receive broadcasts and not
involving CBS’ copyrights.
Both courts —
Q

That is, the origination of other programs

and the commercials and the interconnections?
MR, BARNARD:
Q

That is correct, your Honor.

And the microwaves?

MR. BARNARD:

Well, the issue of microwave is

not up in this petition.
Q

No, but it is the interconnection and the

origination of the other programs?
MR. BARNARD:
Q

And the sale of commercials.

And the sale of commercials.

MR. BARNARD:

Both courts below held that those

three activities did not have considerable effect on the
reception service and held that it did not change it into a
performance.
Q

Right.

6
MR. BARNARD:

I turn first to the leading issue

of the distance signal issue,

Fortnightly, as the Court

will recall, involved two CATV systems in West Virginia,
one in Clarksburg, one in Fairmont, which received Pittsburgh
and other stations 60 to 80 miles away.

And, Fortnightly,

the issue was whether the reception by the two CATV systems
;vas a performance and, hence, an infringement and holding
that the reception service by those two CATV systems was not
a performance, this Court did not discuss the receiving
antenna nor its location in relationship to the CATV
communities which had granted a franchise to the Fortnightly
CATV.
There were actually five towns that had granted
franchises to the Clarksburg CATV and two to the Fairmont
CATV; nor did the Court discuss the devices which connected
the antenna to the CATV DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.
There was, in Fortnightly, an issue as to the
technology of the equipment, cables, amplifiers and other
equipment, to bring the signal from the antenna to the
subscribers' sets.
United Artists, the copyright owner there,
argued — and CBS repeats the argument here — that the CATV
systems have complicated equipment, sophisticated equipment,
and that they are active rather than passive and that the
transmission and retransmission of the broadcast signals by

7
the CATV systems in the course of distributing the signals to
the subscribers constitutes a performance.
There was also, in Fortnightly , an issue as to
whether the CATV systems spoiled the market for the copyright
owners by making the broadcast available in the CATV community
outside the broadcast station's market.
The trial court found that broadcasts could not
be received by the residents of Clarksburg and Fairmont on
their own antennas and the CATV reception, the copyright
owner argued, spoiled his market.
The Fortnightly court of appeals said that the
copyright owner was entitled to prevent dilution of his
market and to limit his license to areas and to audiences.
This Court rejected arguments based on the
technology of equipment and the arguments by the copyright
owner that his market had been spoiled.

It focused on the

meaning of the word "performance" and held that reception of
a broadcast intended for public reception and the distri­
bution of the broadcast signals to the — what this Court
called "additional viewers" was not a performance.
Despite this background, the Court of Appeals in
this case concluded that the location of the antenna on which
the broadcast was received and the technology of the
equipment to connect the antenna to the cable distribution
system had copyright significance.

8
The error, we submit, in the decision of the
court below stems from the fact that the court based its
reasoning here, as it did in Fortnightly, on what the copy­
right owner said was his preferred method of economics in
exploiting his copyright, rather than on the meaning of the
word "performance."
CBS and the copyright amici in the court below
argued that the television station has a specific market area
bounded by the points where the broadcasts are received off
the air by rooftop antennas.
A copyrighted owner, it is said, does not intend
his broadcast to be viewed outside that area and if it is
viewed outside that area, by reason of a CATV reception, it
is, CBS says, an "importation of a distant signal," which is,
according to CBS, a "broadcast function."
Q

No matter how far.

HR. BARNARD:

That is correct.

All of this is

an echo of the copyright owner's economic argument.
Building on this copyright owner's preferred
economics, the court below concluded that the CATV reception
would be permitted only if the broadcast signal was, in the
court's words, "in the community."

If the signal was not

already in the community, then it was a distant signal and
importing it into the CATV community made the CATV
functionally equivalent to a broadcaster and the court

9
deemed that to be an infringement.
The court recognized the difficult task of
defining the term "distant signal."
top antennas as the

It could not use roof­

CBS had suggested.

Such a conclusion,

the court said, would "fly in the fact of the mandate of
Fortnightly."

It could not require that the receiving

antenna be located in the CATV community.

The CATV

receiving antennas in Fortnightly were located outside all
seven of the CATV communities, although the exact distance
did not figure in any way in the decision in Fortnightly.
In the end, the court below devised a definition
based on antenna technology, using such vague litigationprone words as "near" or "adjacent to."
"When the antenna is not near or adjacent to the
CATV community —" and what the court called "transmittal" or
"retransmittal devices," were needed to bring the signal
from the antenna to the CATV community.

Then it is a distant

signal unless the CATV can bear what it called "the heavy
burden"of showing that the signal could be received near or
adjacent to the CATV community on an antenna of equivalent
sophistication, another litigation-prone test.
The transmittal or retransmittal device that the
court talked about in its formulation included either microwave or cable.
In the courts below, CBS argued that because

10

microwave is transmission through the air, its use makes
CATV like a broadcaster, who also transmits through the air.
But both courts below held that microwave is point to point
transmission, equivalent to or substitute for cable or wire.
And that issue of microwave is not in the petition here.
Nonetheless, the court below made the use of the
transmittal device — such as microwave or cable — critical,
overlooking the fact that a transmittal device was, in fact,
used in Fortnightly cables and amplifier to bring the signal
from the antenna to the community.
In support for this new judicial formulation, the
court below, and CBS here, place central reliance on two
sentences In this Court’s opinion, United States v. South­
western Cable.
That case involved the FCC’s rule under the
Communications Act requiring that CATV systems and the
Grade B contour of a station receive the station and block
out other signals, so-called '’nonduplication" of the same
program.
In upholding the FCC’s regulatory authority, this
Court described CATV systems as having one or both of two
functions.
First, enhancing reception of local stations
and, second, transmitting to subscribers the signals of
stations beyond the reach of local antennae, which this

11
Court referred to as the"importation of distant signals."
This was said in a regulatory context, not copy­
right, and this Court specifically noted that the term,
"distant signal" was given a specialized definition by the
FCC in the context of the compulsory carriage rule.
"Distance" meant, "received beyond the Grade B
contour of a station,"

a line calculated on an engineering

assumption along which good reception is expected 90 percent
of the time at 50 percent of the locations.

It does not

mark the limits of actual reception.
The court below recognized that this FCC definition
of distant signals for regulatory purposes was, in its words,
"unsuitable for copyright purposes."
Five of the 10 stations received by the Fort­
nightly CATV's were distant under the FCC rule, beyond the
B contour.

This is significant because Fortnightly and

Southwestern were argued together and decided at virtually
the same time.
If the FCC definition of distant signals had
copyright significance, this Court would surely have said so.
Instead, it held that the reception of signals, both distant
and nondistant, under the FCC definition, was not a per­
formance .
While the court below uses the word "distant"
signal, the rule as constructed is not based on distance

12

nor on the PCC definition.

In fact, it conflicts directly

with the FCC definition.
The Durango station, received by the CATV in
Farmington, which the court below held was distant, is only,
in fact, *15 miles from Farmington.

In Fortnightly, the

Pittsburgh stations were 80 miles from the Clarksburg CATV
systems.
A mountain blocks the reception of the Durango
station in Farmington.

The CATV receiving antenna is on the

side, on the mesa, *10 miles away and the signal is brought
to Farmington by a microwavelength licensed by the FCC.

But

Farmington is within the Grade B contour of the Durango
station and, hence, it is local under the FCC compulsory
carriage rule.
The station demanded and received compulsory
carriage and nonduplication protection.
Under the new definition of the court below, the
reception of the Durango station, by the Farmington CATV,
which is required by the FCC, has become a performance, a
consequence which CBS drily describes as "anomalous."
The court below said, without analysis, that in
receiving distant signals, as it defined them, the CATV x^as
functionally equivalent to a broadcaster.

But it made no

attempt to compare the functions of a CATV system and a
broadcaster.

Whether or not the signal Is distant under the

13

rule of the court below, the CATV had nothing to do with
procuring or originating the program, the broadcaster did.
The CATV system merely received what was broad­
cast and made the signals available instantaneously and
without editing to its subscribers.

This is exactly what

the CATV did in Fortnightly.
CBS argues that the CATV selects stations to be
received for their programming and, hence, selects programs.
This is an echo of the attempt made in Fortnightly to confuse
the selection of stations with the selection of programs.
In Fortnightly, the selection of stations was
held not to be — was held to be on the viewers’ side and not
a performance.
The same conclusion, we think, should be
applicable here.
Moreover, the court overlooked the fact that in
law and in the economics of the television industry, the
CATV subscribers are in the audience coverage area of the
television station.
The FCC has authority under its statute to fix
the "areas or zones to be served by a station."

It has done

this by its general rules permitting CATV reception of
stations, including the so-called "distant signals."
this instance the FCC has acted more specifically.

But in
It has

granted microwave licenses to receive these specific stations

14

by these specific CATV's to distribute the signals in this
CATV community.

This is a specific act by the Commission,

exercising its authority to put these CATV subscribers in the
zone or area to be served by the station.
In addition, in television industry economics,
the CATV subscribers are included In the station's coverage
area.

Television is a mass medium and its economics turn on

audience size, the selection of affiliates, the prices paid
for — charged to advertisers, the prices paid for programs,
all turn on the size of the audience.
The audience is measured by the rating services,
ARB and Neilsen are the two big ones, and these —•

advertisers who want that television time.

audience.

And if the station's audience is increased by

Honor, is that the distant station

CBS talks most about, Los Angelese to FArmington,

is — has the Farmington CATV subscribers included in its
coverage area in the — and it is published in the volumes as
they are published.

It shows what the coverage area is and

the record has got a number of proposals by the stations
citing its CATV coverage including that of a Los Angeles
station which talks about its CATV coverage in New Mexico.
When CBS decided to use television to exploit
its works, it took the medium the way it is in fact and in
law.
When CBS authorized the broadcast, it was broad­
cast under the words of the statute intinded to be received
by the public.

The statute says "the public," not just the

part of the public CBS would like, for its own private

16
reasons, to be allowed to receive the broadcasts and in the
industry economics, the subscribers were in the station’s
coverage area.
X now turn to the issue raised by the cross­
petition:

Whether the activity of the CATV station on

separate channels, not used for broadcast reception so
tainted the reception of the broadcasts as to convert that
reception into a performance.

Put in another way, is there

a doctrine of infringement by analogy or, in the words of the
court below, is there a spillover effect?
When a CATV originates the program and makes it
available to suscribers, it performs the program.

If copy­

rights are involved, Teleprompter secured a license and paid
a royalty.
No CBS program was involved in any CATV
origination.

This is not pay tv.

No extra or separate

charge was made for the originated program.

The origination

by the CATV was on separate, nonbroadcast channels and in
no way interfered with or interrupted the reception of the
broadcasts.
There were two kinds of programming, so-called
’'automated programming" in which a camera scans clock and
weather instruments, and sort of general interest programming.
The idea of originating programming occurred in
the early 60’s because there was an empty channel not used

17
for broadcast reception in the Farmington system and they
conceived the notion of originating with the
attracting people to use the CATV service.

idea of
It worked and in

the relevant periods in this case, three of the five systems
had general interest programming and automated programming,
Farmington, Great Falls and New York.
The amount varied.

Great Falls had two hours a

day, five days a week and Upto in New York, 1971, 10 hours a
day.
Novr, the interconnection that Mr. Stewart
mentioned is actually a form of origination.

It was closed-

That occurred in

That also was in conformity

with the FCC rules.
CBS has proposed a new doctrine of totality by
whith a reception service can be converted from a non­
performance into a performance.

Because a broadcaster

said, which performs these functions

Two events of interconnection that are talked

about occurred in 1964 and 1965, months

away or years away

from the dates of the alleged infringement.
The courts below, we submit, were correct in
holding that there is no spillover effect and that there is
no doctrine of totality by analogy.
In conclusion, the FCC's regulatory plan for
CATV is designed, among other things, to provide television
service to households in small communities that is like the

19
service otheritfise only residents in large metropolitan areas
are able to get.
More than two million households now depend on
CATV reception of distant signals for part of their tele­
vision service.
Q

By emphasizing —
How do you define "distant signal?"

MR. BARNARD:

I think there is no significance for

distant signals in the copyright context.
Q

Well,, you just used the phrase.

Nov/, what do

you mean by it?
MR. BARNARD:

I am using the phrase that they

used distant signals in the context of the court below.
Q

In other words9 when Farmington — when the

Farmington CATV station went out and got KTTV, an independent
station in Los Angeles, that was something that nobody in that
area with his own television set, no matter what kind of an
aerial he might have had, including one on a high hill,
could have possibly received.
MR. -BARNARD:

Isn’t that correct?

That is correct, your Honor, but

that may have had significance in the regulatory context but
it seems to me it has no significance in the copyright
context.
Q

That is your argument, then.

MR. BARNARD:

And, in addition, the FCC in that

instance, KTTV, granted the license which put the CATV

20
subscribers in the coverage area.
Q

I think it is KTTV.

It is that independent

station in Los Angeles.
MR. BARNARD:
Q

There are four of them, I think.

MR. BARNARD:
Q

Yes, there are four of them, yes.

That is correct, your Honor.

And how far away was KTTV from its broad­

casting in Farmington?
MR. BARNARD:

I think it is about 900 miles.

I

think the microwave network was a little longer because it
wandered around, but I think airmiles it is about 900 miles.
Q

Umn hmn.

MR. BARNARD:

By emphasizing a prospective

ruling only and by offering to waive damages, CBS is really
asking this Court to turn its back on Fortnightly.

Over­

ruling or restricting CBS — restricting Fortnightly as
CBS asks will place In the hands of the large copyright
owners like CBS the power to set the FCC CATV plan aside
and to decide in their own private interest what television
service the public and the United States should receive.
I reserve the remainder of my time, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. BARNARD:

It is four minutes.

21
ORAL ARGUMENT OF
ASA D. SOKOLOW, ESQ.
MR. SOKOLOV/:

Mr. Chief Justice, Members of

the Court:
The Court did agree, pursuant to our application,
your Honor, that I could share five minutes of my half-hour
time with my co-counsel, Mr. Graubard, who xvill address him­
self to the question of the syndication market and the effect
of the importation of distant signals on copyright owners in
that context, and the Court did grant that request, your
Honor.
This lawsuit is not a lawsuit involving what
Mr. Barnard calls "antenna technology."

The ultimate issue

here, as we see it, is whether the Copyright Act is going to
be declared inoperative with respect to an entire industry
because the cable television industry, as it exists today, is
not the same industry that existed at the time of the
Fortnightly decision.
With all due respect to the Court, one could say
that the Fortnightly decision was outdated almost at the
time that it was written.

Fortnightly was decided in 1968.

The complaints were filed, I believe, in I960.

The record

was filled with facts prior to that time.
Fortnightly involved a system that did nothing
more but go two and a half miles out of town, put up an

22
antenna on a long hill, big hill, and enhance the reception
of television signals which were over the air in those
communities, were intended to be received by the members of
those communities, were, in fact, received by some members
of the community with rooftop antenna

and received by others

with cooperative antennas.
That is all that the Fortnightly system did.
Now, at the time that the Fortnightly issue was
before this Court, the Court was informed that there were
then in existence other cable stations.
Teleprompter.

They included

They were not back in the horse and buggy

days of Fortnightly but which were importing distant
signals hundreds of miles away who could not enter a
particular market except for the activity of the cable
system.

These stations were originating programming.
As a matter of fact, the Teleprompter Cable

Station in New York City originates more programming than
WCBS-TV, our owned and operated affiliate in New York.
They were selling commercials and they were
interconnecting internetworks.
Now, when the Fortnightly case
question was, what was the performance?

engaged in a public performance and he wasn’t a copyright
violator.

It would, then, be a performance.

MR. SOKOLOW:

It might very well, your Honor.

And if I called someone into my home, in the Fortnightly
case, your Honor, that differentiated between broadcasters
and viewers.
Q

Right.

MR. SOKOLOW:

But I think that if I brought my

new color television set into my home and charged everybody
$10

Q

No, even if you didn't charge them anything.

MR. SOKOLOW:

If I — If I invited a group in?

It could be a public performance.
Q

Right.

And therefore, the person that sold you

the television set could be a contributory infringer.
MR. SOKOLOW:

I don't think so.

I think the

transmitter of that television programming was the performer.
I think the receiver was the performer but that the

transmitter* of the programming was performing in public,
and for public and if you came in and invited people in,
other than a social occasion -Q

Well, why would it be other than a social

occasion?
MR. SOKOLOW:

Well, if I charged people $10 to

Q

What difference does that make, from the

point of view of the Copyright Act?
MR. SOKOLOW:
Q

I think if you —

You would violate copyright if you have a —•

put on a dramatic performance, whether or not you charge
admission, don’t you think?
MR. SOKOLOW:

I don’t know whether the courts

would say that if I invited in two or three friends to watch
the reception that would be public performance.
Q

The question is, whether or not it would be

in public.
MR. SOKOLOW:
Q

Yes.

But whether or not it is in public doesn't

depend upon how much admission is charged, does it?
MR. SOKOLOW:

At present it does not, your

Honor.
Well, in any event, what the pre-Fortnightly
rule was as far as a performance was concerned was, as we

25

understand

Mr. Justice Portis, who dissented in the

Fortnightly case, was changed so that now we have got a
functional test as to what a performance is, at least for this
particular industry.
Now, Mr. Barnard says that we are making a frontal
assault on the Fortnightly decision.

I think that we are

entitled to recover here and that there should be an
infringement, whether the Fortnightly decision stands,
whether it falls, whether it is limited to its own facts
because if you read Fortnightly, Fortnightly says that you
have to look at the functions; what place does cable tele­
vision play in the total spectrum of the broadcasting
industry?

And it used such words as "viewers, passive

beneficiaries on the viewers side of the line," as
contrasted with "broadcasters."
Now, I can’t imagine a television viewer or a
passive beneficiary who imports distant signals or originates
programming or who sells commercials or interconnects into a
network.

Now, I know who performs that kind of a function,

broadcasting stations.

WCBS-TV in New York City Imports a

local signal from a network broadcasting center and it
originates programming and sells commercials and it is a
broadcaster and so does the Teleprompter Cable Station in
New York City.

It receives those local signals.

It

originates programming and it is selling commercials.

26
Now, when the case was here, the Fortnightly
case was here, Mr. Barnard did not talk to this Court about
Importation of distant signals.

He said repeatedly in that

oral argument that we are In the area where reception Is
possible off the air;

we are in the area where reception

would have been expected if it were not for the ruggedness
of the area.
There was no talk about distant signals.

He

said that those areas were in the service area of the broad­
cast stations.
Now, what is involved in importation of distant
signals?

Talcing that function, the fact of the matter is that

the Court of Appeals didn't invent the term.

The earth is

round and television signals on the earth travel in straight
lines.

As a result, as an engineering matter, television

signals normally don't travel more than 60 to 100 miles,
although there are a few exceptions.
There was uncontradicted evidence in the record
on that

subject.
Nov/, furthermore, the FCC has always regarded it

as a policy to have separate markets.

They don't want

superstations in New York City retransmitting to different
areas and therefore, Los Angeles is a separate market and it
is not Farmington.
Now, how did Farmington — Teleprompter

27

Farmington — get the Los Angeles stations?
Well3 what it did was to procure and select the
type of programming that it wanted, Mr. Justice Stewart.
That is what you said in Fortnightly was a characteristic of
a broadcaster.
There were some 113 other television stations
as close to or closer to Farmington than Los Angeles but
they wanted those

Los Angeles stations because of the type

of programming that they had.
sports.

I am sure that they had

I am sure they had situation comedies.

they had lots of things.

I am sure

To get those signals into Farmington

there was no way of getting those signals into Farmington
other than by this importation and Teleprompter got a 1,000mile microwave transmission link in order to bring it in there
and the Los Angeles stations did not intend that their
programs go to Farmington and the copyright owners who
testified at this trial said that they, when they licensed
those independent stations at Los Angeles, they did not
intend the programs to go to FArmington because they were
looking to sell those programs again or to license them again
for syndication in the Farmington area.
That is the subject on which Mr. Graubard will
talk.
The Los Angeles supermarket or the used-car
salesman who is sponsoring a program on the Los Angeles

28

station had no interest in Farmington.

There has been an

amicus brief submitted by MPAA which has some very
interesting statistics on the subject that Mr. Justice White
asked about.
The statics show that only 30 percent of the
advertising on national television is national advertising;
70 percent of it is local advertising, spot advertising.
Those kind

of advertisers have no interest in this.
Mr. BArnard follows with the question of how

the court below defined distance signals.

Well, the court

started out by defining local signals.
A local signal, it said, was something that
could be received in a local community with a CATV antenna,
for example, but you had to get a clear and good reception.
If you went 600 miles or 800 miles further, if
you had to locate your antenna near the broadcasting station,
miles and miles away, and you had to use microwave to bring
it In there, then the court said the signal is presumptively
distant.
It is costly to lay miles of cable and to go
through this microwave apparatus.

If Teleprompter didn’t

have to go 600 miles to Los Angeles, it would not have done
it.

So the court of appeals said that with respect, for

example, to the Los Angeles stations which went 600 miles to
Farmington, they were presumptively distant.

29

Noone would quarrel with that.

The Salt Lake

City stations were MOO-odd miles away from Great Palls.

No

way that those signals could have gotten in there, no way
that they could be called anything but distant.

The Denver

stations were something like l60 miles from Rawlins.

No

question about the fact that they were distant.
So that the dispute as to what the court really
did here below, I think is rather meaningless.

Mr. Barnard

has referred to the fact that the PCC has recently refined its
description.
and

Instead of now talking just in terms of Grade A

Grade B contours, they nox*? use the term "significant

viewing."

If you apply the significant viewing test, the

current PCC test to the signals that were involved in our
case, all with the exception of Durango, that the court of
appeals found imported, then distant signals would be distant
signals under current PCC definition.
Mr. Barnard disagrees with our arguing totality of
services but I don't understand how we could talk about any­
thing but totality if we are talking about function.
Teleprompter advertises that it imports distant
signals.

Then it attracts an audience and the audience

listens to the Teleprompter originations and that new
audience that is attracted to the originations turns on the
commercials and listens to the commercials.
Now, xtfhat difference does it make that It is on a

30
different channel?

The court of appeals said maybe there

would be a different result if you were on a different
channel.
Well, up in New York City where I am, that
Teleprompter channel has four or five channels on which it is
or
originating programming,/having public access programming
or it is showing time and weather or it is running an A&P
report.

Every time you turn onto that other channel, you

are not watching WCBS-TV.
reception of the signal.

It is not enhancing the
It is blocking it out.

Now, that might be desirable because the FCC
encourages this type of activity, but it blocks out our
signal just as much as if they had run those originations
on our channel to New York City.
Now, it Is true that if Teleprompter were not
there, channel two is competing with channel four and
channel five and channel seven and the viewer has the same
option.

But every one of those competitors is paying copy­

right royalties.

The only competitor that Is not paying

copyright royalties is Teleprompter.
And make no mistake about it.

Teleprompter

has said repeatedly in its public statements that it is a
competitor.

The Fortnightly system was no competitor of the

broadcaster, at most it enhanced the reception.

But the

Teleprompter prospectusses which we have placed into

31
evidence here state that they are competitive with broadcasters
for programmings for personnel, for sponsors and for contents.
Therefore, I think that each of these separate
functions, one feeds on the other.
Q

I think that the Court —

Mr, Sololow, you said a moment ago that when

people turn on the Teleprompter channels in New York, it
blocks out channel two.

I am

not personally familiar to

understand what you mean.
MR. SOKOLOV/:
explain it.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, let me

We have, on the top of our television set, a

converter which is provided by Teleprompter.

It has all the

usual channels plus the other particular channels, so —
Q

Including two.

MR. SOKOLOV/:

Yes, of course, including two,

which is V/CBS-TV.
Q

Which is required — it is required to carry

all the local stations.
MR. SOKOLOV/:

Definitely, sir.

And it does carry

all of the local stations and the U1IF station is included and
the educational channel and in addition, it has other
origination channels.
All I was saying, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is that
if I turn that dial and I put on an origination channel and
I’m watching the New York Knicks or the New York Rangers
which are pretty popular sports, I am not watching channel

32
two.

Now, I don't mind that if Teleprompter —

I hope that doesn’t make me an infringer.

But —

[Laughter.]
-- but so it only blocks it out in that sense.
Q

What do you block out when you turn away

from one broadcaster to another one?
MR. SOKOLOW:

Yes, the only differentiation I

was making, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is that when — if I
don’t have the color cable it is a question of free
competition whether I turn on channel two or channel four.
Let them pay their proper share of the origination of the
programming and we’ll all be happy.
Q

Well, there is no question of paying whatever

royalties are due with respect to any programming that they
originate.
MR. SOKOLOW:

I don’t think that is correct.

I

did stipulate with Mr. Barnard that for the purpose of
programming which they originate — you know, this case was
done mainly by stipulations, your Honor.
Q

Yes, I know.

33
I do not believe that Teleprompter

pays for the

music that it uses and I think ASCAP has filed a bx’ief amicus
here, would really not concede that it is being paid by Teleprompter for the use of the music.
Q

Well, is that at issue here?

I thought that

the only issue was as to its liabilities under the Copyright
Act for what is originated by CBS?
MR. SOKOLOW:
your Honor.

That is all X am concerned with,

I was just trying to answer your

question as to

ifhether or not they, in fact, paid copyright royalties to
use the music.
Q

No, I asked whether that was an issue in this

case.
MR. SOKOLOW:

No, it is not.

As far as we are

concerned, that ASCAP issue Is a question between ASCAP and
them.

We have

stipulated as far as this case is concerned

that we will concede that they paid those,
Q

That is what I thought.

MR. SOKOLOW:

And now I'd like to have

Mr. Graubard address himself to the question of syndication.
I want to explain why I am doing that.
Syndication is a very important subject.

CBS is

not allowed by PCC law to engage in syndication any more so
I thought that the argument would more appropriately come
from —

Will you tell us what it is?

MR. SOKOLOV:

Yes, what it involves, your Honor,

is the production of television programming which may be

ORAL ARGUMENT OF
SEYMOUR GRAUBARD, ESQ.
MR. GRAUBARD:

Mr. Chief Justice.

May it please

the Court:
I am speaking for those copyright owners who are
independent producers and who license their works to tele­
vision broadcasters and to others.

Thus, Dena Corporation,

which I represent directly, is owned by Danny Kaye, an actor

35
and by his wife, Sylvia Fineke, a composer and lyricist.
They do not broadcast^ themselves, any of their productions.
They license their productions.

So do the other named co­

plaintiffs in this action and so do many others, including
producers of motion pictures.
I am also speaking for the authors, actors,
directors, composers and musicians who sell their creative
output to the producers.
Under their Guild contracts, they receive, in
addition to their compensation for the initial performance of
their works, stipulated percentages of the amounts paid for
reruns of the programs.
Most television programs, even if they are
fortunate enough to be rewarded with a network broadcast,
do not recover their costs through that initial broadcast.
The profits that may be earned generally come from the
additional showings or reruns that

follow the initial net­

work performance.
Both the producers and the artists who create
these programs rely on these reruns for their ultimate
compensation.
Q

Now, the term —
Mr. Graubard, this includes the actors who

a members of a cast of -—
MR. GRAUBARD:
Q

Yes, sir.

— either a movie or one made exclusively for

36
tv and these are the so-called "residuals," isn’t that right?
MR. GRAUBARD:
Q

Yes, sir, that is correct.

They have come in recently.

The old-time

movies, unfortunately, those old-time stars don’t get a
nickel, do they, when they run a rerun?
MR. GRAUBARD:

That’s right.

As a matter of

fact, in the old days, even the producers —
Q

Right —

MR. GRAUBARD:
Q

— failed to —

■— to have residuals.

MR. GRAUBARD:

— realize the values of the

residuals.
Q

The residuals, right.

MR. GRAUBARD:
Q

That is no longer the case today.

No.

MR. GRAUBARD:

Mr. Sokolow has explained the

meaning of the term "syndication."

Generally speaking, once

the intial performance is over, the program owner licenses
individual television stations to perform the work or the
program and these television stations obtain their own
advertising revenues for the programs.

As some members of

this Court may have noticed, some of these reruns seem to go
on forever and there is a different scale of compensation
for the artists depending upon how many reruns there are.
Now,obviously, a program has a greater potential

37
audience and a greater sales value to licensing if it has
not previously been shown in the local area.
Many network broadcasts that are initially
licensed are limited to certain regions.

No broadcasts,

through broadcasting stations, reach the entire nation.

By

importing distant signals, the CATV systems injure the
market for these programs that are to be shown initially in
the areas not previously fortunate enough to have had the
benefit of the initial performance.
Thus, the cable performance in this distant
area is frequently an exclusive first run for which the copy­
right owners receive nothing.
Moreover, the copyright owner must then deal in
these areas for license fees based on second showings rather
than on initial performances.
To the extent that the copyright owners receive a
smaller amount for a second run, the creative artists
similarly suffer.
On the other hand, to the extent that the cable
systems would pay a reasonable royalty for a license to
perform programs received by distant signal, the copyright
owners and the artists would benefit.
We believe that this is a clear case for the
enforcement of the Copyright Law whose purpose and design
were to reward the creators of programs for the performance of

38
their works.
It follows that the copyright owners and their
associated creative artists also support the contention that
cable systems that function as broadcasters are actually
performing the copyrighted works and should pay royalties for
the use they make of these works.
Now, we are not as concerned, frankly, at this
time about classifying as broadcasters those cable stations
that have innovative programs, that have interconnection,
that draw advertising.
V/e independents and artists know that cable
television today is still growing.

By the end of the decade

it is predicted that approximately one-half the families of
the United States with television sets will be linked to
cable.

It is also predicted, and the Court may find this

amply demonstrated in the briefs before it, that pay tele­
vision on a broad scale will be a fact, that there may be
two-way connections between cable stations and their
subscribers and, in short, that the cable stations are
progressively becoming a more and more important communication
element in our society.
If this Court is going to make law in regard to
the function of a cable television set today, not as in
Fortnightly, a pair of giant rabbit ears which performed none
of these functions, but if .it is going to view cable

39
television as it is currently developing, as it has
developed since Fortnightly, and as It is well on the road
to become In the future, I believe the Court will find that
cable television projectors or stations will be major
competitors, if not the major competitor of the broadcasters.
To give these stations the unfair competitive
advantage of being able to perform certain works without the
payment of royalties is very bad, of course, for CBS.
Q

Well, you are begging the question when you

say they are performing.
MR. GRAUBARD:
Q

I recognize that, your Honor.

That is like saying —■

MR. GRAUBARD:

May

I say, correct myself and say

I hope the Court will call that a performance.

I will

correct myself by saying "to use these programs."

To use

these programs means potential great injury for the tele­
vision broadcasters.
Q

As I recall, a television set uses the

programs and if it is not done in private, there you could
make the argument that that is a violation, every time he
turns on his set, of the copyright laws, if it is in public.
MR. GRAUBARD:

Your Honor, I \tfould not personally

make that argument.
Q

Well, it can be made, just the same way you

are making this one.

doing it for commercial purposes or noncommercial.
MR. GRAUBARD:

No, sir.

I have every

confidence —
Q

It is talking about a performance in public,

isn’t it?
MR. GRAUBARD:

That is right, sir.

I have every

confidence that if that particular question, that issue
reached this Court, at some future time, this Court would
deal with it accordingly, as it saw fit.
I am not making any advocacy of a position itrhich
I believe at the present time to be extreme.

Rather, I am

stating that I believe in the future and it is becoming
increasingly obvious today, the owners of copyright will be
losing revenues if the cable stations are not going to be

held liable to pay the copyright owners proper license fees,
just as do the television stations.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. Graubard.
Mr. Barnard?
Q

Before you sit down, Mr. Graubard, as I

remember, the Fortnightly case was argued and decided back in
1967, 1968.

I think it had originated in i960.
MR. GRAUBARD:
Q

That is right, sir.

We were told at that

time that this was a

matter in the Congress and it was about ready to be settled
in the Congress, there was going to be legislation.

I don’t

think ■— apparently, all we still have is the statute enacted
back in 1909s long before anybody dreamed of television itself,
let alone CATV.
What Is the status now with the situation in
Congress?

Because this, of course, is the basic problem in

this case, is we all know is trying to apply a 1909 statute
to a technological revolution.
MR. GRAUBARD:

Well, it did appear before the

Fortnightly decision came down, that there was likely to be
legislation.

In fact, it appeared that there was likely to

be legislation when this particular case was on the way up.
But after the district court opinion was rendered, the CATV

42
people, at any rate, lost Interest in the compromise legis»
lation that was pending.
Now, your Honor, I have — there is nothing in
the record in regard to this and I am just attempting to
answer your question directly.
Q
interest.

Well, Congress itself might have some

Will they only move if the CATV people are

interested?
MR. GRAUBARD:

I could not answer that.

Perhaps

Mr. Barnard can.
I don’t know, sir.
Q

Is there a bill now in the Congress?

MR. GRAUBARD:
Q

Yes, sir, and all I can say is —*

Is it before a committee?

What is the status

of it?
MR. GRAUBARD:

I am told that if the CATV people

are motivated by what eventuates from this case, there is
likely to be legislation.
Q

Have there been committee hearings?

MR. GRAUBARD:

There have been committee hearings,

yes, sir.
Q

In both houses?

MR* GRAUBARD:

In the House of Representatives,

certainly.
Q

And in the Senate, too?

43

MR. GRAUBARD:

X don’t believe there have been

any in the Senate.
Q

Anything reported out of a committee in

either house?
MR. GRAUBARD:

I think they are awaiting final

determination of these issues, as far a3 this point is
concerned.
Q

Awaiting what?

MR. GRAUBARD:

They are awaiting a resolution of

issues between —
Q

Well, what difference would that make to

MR. GRAUBARD:
completely correct.

Mr. Justice White,

you are

I have no excuse or alibi to offer for

what Congress has done or is contemplating doing and —
[Laughter.]
Q

But you think they are waiting?

MR. GRAUBARD:

Perhaps they have greater

reliance on the wisdom of this Court than on their own means.
I have no other reason to offer.
Q

That’s very nice.

MR. GRAUBARD:
Q

Thank you, sir.

All we have is a 1909 statute to guide us.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF
ROBERT. C. BARNARD, ESQ.
MR. BARNARD:

Thank you.

I don?t believe that —

I believe that a statute has been reported out by Senate
subcommittee and is pending action on the Senate side.
There have been, I believe, hearings on both
sides.
Q

Has it been reported out by

sub-committee or

has it been reported out by the whole committee?
MR. BARNARD:

As I understand it, sir, it has

been reported out by subcommittee to the full committee.
Q

Umn hum, and what would that bill provide?

MR. BARNARD:

It has got a fairly complicated

set of rules that have, among other things, compulsory
licenses.

They have provisions for payments.

They have a

whole set of standards as to which CATV systems would apply
to.

I say to the Court these in very general terms because

I am not Involved in the legislative

fight and I know it

only incidentally but I would suggest to the Court that what
Mr. Graubard has said and what CBS has also intimated as well
as one of the other amici, that the Court should decide
against CATV to motivate the situation so that there is

legislations hardly places the proper emphasis on the issue
in front of this Court.

The issue in front of this Court is

not to motivate legislations it is to decide what is the
meaning of the word "performance," and the statute which is
in front of the Court.
May I

comment on one or two of the points that

Mr. Sokolov; made in the course of his argument?
He talked about how much origination CATV does
and compared the origination by the New York CATV with WCBSNew York.

In fact, WCBS-New York, under the rules,

originates everything it broadcasts, whether it gets it from
the network or

not.

It is the responsible broadcaster and

the responsible originator.

If he

Otherwise, there is no sight or sound Involved in
this.
Mr. Sokolow talked about whether we were active
or passive.

This Court, in Fortnightly, said that the CATV

systems were active, they were active on the side of the

vieiver.

He said that in Fortnightly, it was intended that

these programs be viewed by — broadcast by the Pittsburgh
stations — be viewed in Clarksburg and Fairmount.
The Court of Appeals here said they recognized
that the programs would not have been viewed in Clarksburg
and Fairmount, but for the CATV and in Fortnightly, the
copyright owner made exactly the same argument as made here,
that his market

in Clarksburg, where there was a television

station, was being disturbed by the reception of the CATV
programs.
In Fortnightly, we urged that the CATV subscribers
were in the coverage area of the stations.

I think that our

suscribers now are in the coverage area of the stations.
They are in the coverage area of the stations by the
industry's economics and by the actions —
Q

Well, by reason of your activities, they are,

wouldn't you say?
MR. BARNARD:

And the industry's economics were

taken into account as part of the station’s audience, which
it uses as a basis for its rates and the prices which are
paid for its programs.
He said that the Los Angeles station does not
intend that its signal be received in Farmington, but, in
fact, it exploits that fact by putting out sales literature
saying that you can get reception in New Mexico by subscribing

47
to this system.

In the record, there is a sales brochure

from one of the stations.

The same is true of the Great

Palls —
