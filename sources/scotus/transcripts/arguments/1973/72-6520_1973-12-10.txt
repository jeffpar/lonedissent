PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments next

in No. 72-6520, Lau, Et al. v. Nichols.
Mr. Sfceinman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD H. STEINMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. STEINMAN:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
I wish to devote the first 20 minutes of my opening
argument to the constitutional issued raised in this case.

I

would then be followed by Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger, Assistant
Attorney General of the United States, who will address himself
to the statutory violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The issue in this case concerns the discrimination
suffered by nearly 1,800 non-English speaking Chinese students
in San Francisco in the provision of educational benefits and
opportunities.
Both the Federal District Court and the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals below were satisfied that so long as the San
Francisco school system provides the same instruction, the same
material, and the same teachers to all students, the equal pro­
tection clause is satisfied.

Regardless of the fact that these

students, since they do not understand English, and since they
are sitting in classes where English is the instruction -- was
the language of instruction, regardless of the fact that these

4
students cannot learn.,
Q

Mr. Steinman, might I interrupt you.

Actually,

are these 1,300 more or less students — they are referred to
in your brief and I think in the record as Chinese students.
They are mt Chinese Americans, they are Chinese?
MR. STEINMAN:

They are both Chinese Americans, they

are both native born and they are also foreign born, Your Honor,
The school system, in answer to interrogatories, said that it
does not keep records on the origin of birth or on citizenship
of the students.

But of the seven named petitioners before

this Court, five of them are native born American citizens.
Q

They are?

MR. STEINMAN:

Yes, five of them, David Leong, David

Sun, Judy Sun, Karen Yee and Joan Yee.
Q

There has been a good deal of recent immigration

into the United States, and particularly into the City of San
Francisco, is there not, from Taiwan and —
MR. STEINMAN:

Oh, definitely.

I think it is clear

that many members of the 1,800 students that we represent are
recent immigrants.

I think though that one thing must be

pointed out, which was pointed out in the reply brief of pe­
titioners, that the immigration laws were relaxed in the mid­
sixties and the new laws went into effect on July 1, 1968.
the defendants, in their own survey conducted in November of
1967, seven months before the new immigration laws even went

Yet

into effect, admitted that there were close to 2,000 nonEnglish-speaking Chinese students who, as petitioners are before
you, effectively pursued an education,
Q

And this 1,000 is out of how many Chinese or

Chinese American students in the school population of San
Francisco?
MR. STEINMAN:

The school population of San Francisco,

in the record of the case, there are approximately — one figure
is 13,000 from the City Attorney, one figure is 15,000 from the
school district.

There are also 3,000 Chinese speaking students

in San Francisco, of which the petitioners represent approxi­
mately 63 percent of those.

The petitioners represent those

Chinese speaking students, Your Honor, who receive nothing but
the regular instruction in English.
In the lower court below, there was another class,
group of petitioners who were non-English speaking Chinese
students who did receive some special help.

Those petitioners

are not before this Court.
Q

What was that 13,000 or 15,000 figure?

MR. STEINMAN:

The total number of Chinese students

within the San Francisco school system.
Q

So that this group of 1,800 is something more

than 10 percent?
MR. STEINMAN:

Probably between 10 and 15 percent,

depending on which figure you use.

6

Q

I was just curious whether or not native born

American citizens in San Francisco grow up not knowing English,
or whether this group does and it does embrace primarily recent
emigres from Taiwan and elsewhere, and Ilong Kong?
MR. STEINMAN:

I don’t think that --- based on the

facts in the case, Your Honor, although the school system does
not break it down, as I said, seven months before the immigra­
tion laws even went into effect, the school system admitted that
there were nearly 2,000 non-English speaking Chinese students
who receive nothing.

The November '67 survey admitted that

there were approximately 2,400 non-Enqlish speaking Chinese
sfciidents within the entire school district, and of those 2,400
nearly 2.000 were of the same type of dilemma confronting the
petitioners.

They don't speak English, they don't understand

English, and yet their entire instructional program is in regu­
lar classes where English is the language.
Q

Yes, I know the argument, but mv query is to why,

it was as to whv they don't speak English, and I think that may
have something to do with this case.
MR.STEINMAN:

I think why they don't speak English —

of course, it is not in the record, but I think that this Court
can take cognizance of the fact that the Chinese community in
San Francisco is what we refer to as a ghetto, it is quite
insular.

And when the students who are born in this country

cane to the schools, they do not have facilities in English.

7
And unfortunately the actions of the school system perpetuate
that inability to speak English.
Q

Well, in the Chinatown part of San Francisco, is

it true that most of the people there don't speak English?
MR. STEINMAN:
Q

I don’t know the facts —

The fact that it is a ghetto doesn’t answer that

question one way or the other.
MR. STEINMAN:
speak in terms of most.

I don’t know, I don’t think we can
I think we can speak in terms of the

1,800 students, a vast percentage are native born Americans who
have lived their entire lives in San Francisco and have come to
the school system speaking no English.
Q

You say a vast, majority now, these 1,800, are

native born?
MR. STEINMAN:

Wall, again, I cannot address that be­

cause it is not in the record.

All I can rely on the fact is

that in 1967, the school system admitted, even before the im­
migration laws were changed, that there were 2,000 students in
the school system right then who were Chinese speaking who do
not speak English.

And this was before the immigration laws

were even changed.

So that is all I can surmise from the

record, Your Honor.
Q

What is your ultimate complaint, that English

should be taught in these schools?
MR. STEINMAN:

Well, what we would —

3

Q

Or that the instruction should be in Chinese?

MR. STEINMAN:

oh, no.

Our goal is the same announced

goal that the school system in the State of California has made.
Our goal is that we want the.se students to be taught English and
to understand English sc they can have the type of mastery of
English which our society requires.

The problem now is that

they are being taught in a language they do not understand, and
we would like the school system to take whatever steps that are
reasonable, and this of course is within their province, since
they are the experts in this area, to take whatever steps that
are reasonable to guarantee that these students are able to
benefit from the instruction that they are given.
Q

So you would have the same objections if they

taught them in Chinese?
MR. STEINMAN:

If the school system decided that teach­

ing them in Chinese was the most effective method, that would be
a bilingual method, Your Honor.

If the school system decided

that teaching them in Chinese —
Q

You wouldn’t complain if they taught them in

Chinese?
MR, STEINMAN:

So long as they would be able to under­

stand the language of instruction which they are getting
throughout the school system.
Q

I thought you said you wanted them to learn

English so that they could survive in our society?

9

MR. STEINMAN':

Well, under the laws of the State of

California, the school system must primarily teach them in
English, so the school system would not teach them totally in
Chinese.

The school system might wish to employ Chinese

speaking teachers in a bilingual setting, if that is their
choice.

Our complaint is not methodology.

We are not asking

this Court to get involved in pedagogical questions.

Our com­

plaint is that right now the school system is utilising no
methods, based on their own admissions, if I can refer the
Court to the —
Q

Do you know how many other students from the so-

called ghetto besides these 1,800 are in the schools?

How many

total ghetto school children are there?
MR. STEINMAN:

Again, the school svstem has not

broken down the place from which the Chinese students come.

In

response to Mr. Justice Stewart's question, I can just cite you
the fact that there are in San Francisco schools at the time
this case was brought either 13,000 or 15,000 Chinese students.
Q

And you complain only about 1,800 of them who

aren't facile in English?
MR. STEINMAN:

Well, we are complaining of the 1,800

who are not English Speaking Chinese students.

I guess the

Court — there are different classes the Court can look at.
In our brief, what we have done is we have said that in San
Francisco there are approximately 90,000 students who are given

10

instructions from which they can receive educational benefits
and opportunities, whereas there are 1,300 students who are
foreclosed from receiving any opportunity.

In essence, it is

effective exclusion.
Q

I never did get your answer to Mr. Justice

Stewart on why — you say the record is just silent on this, as
to why

there may be 5,000 or 10,000 other ghetto Chinese

students who, although they come from the ghetto, are perfectly
competent to learn English, to understand English.
is the reason about these 1,800?
MR. STEINMAN:

Now, what

Did you ever answer him?

Well, I cannot tell you why these

1,800 came to school not knowing English and other Chinese
students —
Q

Well, do you think you carried your burden of

proof, if that isn't in the record?
MR. STEINMAN:

Oh, I think we have, because I think,

we have shown that the school system has admitted that these
1,800 students receive today no educational opportunities.

If

I may quote the record, at page 56 of the appendix, the school
system says these students "must learn English to function in a
regular class room."
Q

So for whatever reason, for whatever reason a

person comes to the school not knowing any English, your pa.

*

sition is that he must — the school has an obligation to take
some special steps to make him facile in English?

11
MR. STEINMAN:

Well, the school district, Your Honor,

is not passive in this regard.

The school district compels

these students to come to school, the school district enforces
the state requirements that they attend classes.
Q

I understand that, but now for whatever — is it

your position, for whatever reason the child comes to school,
without knowing English, the school system must take some
'special steps for teaching him English?
MR. STEINMAN:

If two things are satisfied.

As in

this case, the school system admits that these students are
effectively excluded from any educational opportunities and we
argue that our case may also be different from the one Your
Honor is thinking of because the individuals here are members
of an identifiable national origin ethnic group, a group
which this Court has traditionally given special classes.
Q

But the majority of which children from that

group know English.
MR. STEINMAN:

That may be so under Fox, but my

understanding of the case is that not every member of a suspect
class —- if I can use that terminology -— must be discriminated
against before this Court will give the special protection.
Q
question.

Of course, this takes us to the next obvious
Suppose there were five Portuguese children who

couldn't speak anything but Portuguese.
MR. STEINMAN:

Sure.

12
0

Under your analysis, is the school system

obliged to teach them, give them special instruction in English
also?
MR. STEINMAN:

If Your Honor assumes that the situa­

tion concerning the Portuguese children is the same as in this
case, where the school system admits that they can receive no
possible educational benefits — using the phrase "effective
exclusion" — then I think the school district would have an
obligation to do something.
The issue which we are concerned with, naturally, and
the Court is, is what should the relief be.

What may be reason

i

able in San Francisco to do with 1,800 children may not be
reasonable in a given community with five Portuguese.

One of

the problems which that type of question —
Q

Why not?

MR. STEINMAN:
Q

Well —

Isn’t the interest of five people just as import

ant as 1,800?
MR. STEINMAN:

No, I am speaking to relief, that the

teaching of five Portuguese, that it might be the type of re­
lief that they might just be able to use cassettes, that they
might just be able to use some type of Berlitz, whereas the
teaching of 1,800 —
Q
tional rights.

Well, that has nothing to do with the constitu­

13
MR. STSINMAN:

Oh, no.

I am saying that if they are

effectively excluded, these Portuguese students would have,
since they are I would assume members of a national origin ~~
you know, if you are assuming that they are members of a
national origin minority group, as petitioners are, that they
would have a right to have the school system do something for
them,

if the school system is admitting that currently they

are effectively excluded.
What the school system does, of course, is something
within their own expertise.
Q

Well, the something can only be one thing, and

that is teach them English.
MR. STEINMAN:

But how that is done, there are a

myriad of methods which can be employed.
Q

Yes.

MR. STEINMAN:

One of the problems that has been

raised before is that when you speak of five Portuguese
children, it seems to raise the spectral, well, they have to
have someone in the community who can speak Portuguese.

And as

the record in this case shows, there are a host of different
methods to employ.
What I am saying that may be reasonable, what methods
may be reasonable for dealing with five Portuguese children
may not be the same thing that San Francisco might do for
these 1,800.

14
Q

But you say the constitutional right is the same

right?
MR. STEINMAN:

Assuming that there is the effective

exclusion, which of course is a factual question which has to be
dealt with in the case.
Q

But if they cannot speak English, there is a con­

stitutional obligation on the government to teach them English,
that is your point, isn't it?
MR. STEINMAN:
Q

If the government is going to have —

Well, just answer yes or no.

I don't mean to

press you unduly, but that is a yes or a no, isn't it?
MR. STEINMAN:

The answer is yes, if we have a

system of public education.
Q

And then obviously that applies, to pursue Mr.

Justice Blackmun’s point, to Russians, Israelis, Norwegians,
Danes, et cetera.

There is no stopping point, is there?

MR. STEINMAN:

Well, again, we are assuming that the

one Russian student in a given community, his knowledge of
English is so little that he receives no educational benefits.
I contend, Your Honor, that that is the factual situation that
may not be true.

In this case, we have the school system

admitting that these students are "inevitably doomed to be
dropouts and become another unemployable in the ghetto."

That

appears in the school district publication at pages 103 to 105
of the appendix.

ib
Q

Is your position the same as to deaf children,

too?
MR. STEINMAN:

We are contending that our students,

unlike the deaf child, is not permanently handicapped.
students do not have a handicap.

Our

They have the capacity and

the ability, like other students, to receive educational opportunities.

What they need is a very short-term effort.
Q

You are not concerned then with the deaf

children?
MR. STEINMAN:

I am very much concerned.

think that that is this case.

I don't

Naturally, our students come

from a suspect class, whereas I don’t believe that children
who are deaf are inherently members of a suspect class in the
way this Court has framed it — race, national origin, efc cetera
If the deaf child is effectivelv excluded, then of course you

Would have the issue of then whether or not that effective

!’

I think that our case is different because, we. don’t
have children whose --- if you want to use the word — handi­
capped, as permanent.

They, like other children, have the

native ability and capacity to learn.
Q

What if the state were to relieve your plaintiffs

of their compulsoy obligation to attend school, would that
undermine or overcome your constitutional argument?
MR. STEINMAN:

That is sort of the question which I

16
think this Court would have to answer after Rodrigues, whether
the Court in Rodriguez framed it as a minimum basic education,
adequate education, and whether that is one compared to others,
or that would exist if the school system ended tomorrow.

X am

hoping that this Court would never have to reach an issue like
that.
The problem here is one of the equal treatment vis-avis students who are getting educational benefit in a compulsory
setting.
Q

Mr. Steinman, I take it that the Title VX argu­

ment was never —

couldn't have been raised in the District

Court?
MR, STEINMAN:
Your Honor.

It was raised in the District Court,

I believe that the. fifth or sixth clause of

action addressed itself to that.

The memorandum of the guide­

lines were issued —- the press release concerning the guide­
lines came down the day before the lower court made its de­
cision, but naturally all the HEW regulations before that time
on which the guidelines were based, regulations going to
national origin discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of
1964, had been in existence.

The court was made aware of the

HEW guidelines on May 25 and issued its decision the next day,
so it had it in the record, Your Honor.
Q

If Congress had intended to have Title VI apply

to this kind of a situation, do you think they would have been

17
more precise in their statutory language?
MR. STEINMAN:

Well, I have addressed the question,

I hope this is what Mr. Pottinger will address himself to.

I

think that the language is precise in the sense that Congress
is concerned that in programs receiving federal funds, there
will be no basis, there will be no discrimination on the basis
of national origin.

One of the inherent components of

national origin would be language discrimination, and the regu­
lations which came down even before this law suit were brought
were issued pursuant to that mandate, and the guidelines which
came down the day before the lower court order was issued ex­
tend further than that.
I would hope that Mr. Pottinger would answer more
fully questions addressed to that, unless Your Honors would
wish to pursue it now.
As we have indicated, the overall result in this case
is an effective exclusion of petitioners from educational
benefits, opportunity to receive educational benefits.
To contrast this with the situation confronting this
Court in Rodrigues, in Rodriguez this Court said — and this is
at 93 Supreme. Court, pages 1291-1299 ■— "The Texas financing
system provides at least an adequate program of education for
every child in every school district.
be made

No charge fairly could

that the financing system fails to provide each child

with an opportunity to acquire basic minimal skills."

18
That is the very charge that we are making here, and
as the record shows the respondents have admitted this.

This

Court has always been concerned with looking beyond, if you
will, surface equality.

The Ninth Circuit was satisfied, as

was the lower court, that surface equality satisfied the equal
protection clause, giving everybody the same thing even though
some cannot benefit from it.
But this Court has alwasys shown, in cases even de­
cided before Brown v. Board of Education, in the education
area, Sweatfc v. Painter, McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents,
that there is something to education, that education is the
essence, if you will, of communication, an interplay of ideas,
<f ii

an ability to discuss.
Mr. Justice Frankfurter, twenty years ago, made I feel
a very acute observation in the Dennis v. United States case,
in a dissenting opinion, when he said, "There is no greater
inequality than the equal tjceatment of unequals."

And 1' think

the Ninth Circuit is ignoring the truth of this observation by
failing to recognize that education is not solely a matter of
physical presence in a classroom.

But although the 1,800

petitioners and all other students in San Francisco do receive
the same materials, the pages are blank for these petitioners.
The print conveys nothing.

And I think this is what the Court

was contrasting, if you will, in Rodriguez.

At least in

Rodriguez the students were provided the minimum amount of

19

education, that every student was given an opportunity to
acquire basic minimal skills»
Once we have this discrimination, the next question I
believe the Court must face is how to evaluate it.

And since

1885, when this Supreme Court decided the case of Yick Wo v.
Hopkins, this Court has historically given close scrutiny and
special protection to Chinese individuals like petitioners»
In fact, last term, in Rodriguez, this Court,
through Mr. Justice Powell's decision, stated the three indicia
of what constitutes a suspect class, it said — 93 Supreme Court
page 1294, and I xrould just like to repeat them to show you
how clearly the petitioners in this case fall within those
indicia:

"saddled with historical disabilities, relegated to a

position of political powerlessness, subjected to a history of
purposeful unequal treatment."

This Court has always recog­

nized this concerning Chinese individuals.
In fact, in a case

orty years after Yick Wo,
:

Yu Cong Hng v. Trinidad, in

'

1926, a Supreme Court case, the

Supreme Court in that case recognized discrimination to
Chinese speaking individuals, not just Chinese people.
Moreover, Your Honor, even if this Court would use
the more differential, rational relationship tests, respondents
have offered no reasons to even satisfy that test.

Unfortu­

nately, they have offered no reasons to satisfy any test.
f

And

i

• ‘

we submit that the discrimination and the absence of any type
'ri‘

•

5

20

of justification for it must lead this Court to find for the
petitioners and order the respondents to develop plans within
their own expertise which would overcome the deprivations these
petitioners suffer and provide them opportunities to learn.
My twenty minutes are up, Your Honor.

Mr. Pottinger

will now speak.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Pottinger?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. STANLEY POTTINGER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. POTTINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The State of California, like most states of the Union,
has seen fit to compel its students to attend school, to set as
one of the educational goals the mastery of the English
language, indeed to require a demonstration in this language
as a condition for graduation from high school.
Ascribing this critical role to the English language
is not, hoever, in our opinion, the issue in contention.

The

issue is whether in so doing the state, in this case the San
A

Francisco School Board, assumes a correlative obligation to
insure that national origin minority

children are not effec­

tively excluded from participation in the educational process
by virtue of that choice.

And we believe that such an obliga­

tion does exist.
Now, as mentioned to you, there are two areas of the

21

lav; under which this obligation may be shown to exist:

The

equal protection clause, to which Mr. Steinraan has addressed
himself, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to which
we wish,the United States, to address itself at the present
time.
It can be shown in this case that the conditions for
application of Title VI exist.

The language itself of Title VI,

the three basic protections of Title VI go beyond the Fourteenth
Amendment in their coverage.

That title provides that no per­

son shall on grounds of color, ract or national origin first be
excluded from participation in a program; second, be denied the
benefits of a program; or, third, in more equal protection type
language, be subjected to discrimination under a program or any
activity receiving federal financial assistance.
In other words, Title VI is not coterminous with the
Fourteenth Amendment because it was enacted not only pursuant
to that amendment but pursuant to the welfare clause enhanced as
it is by the necessary and proper clause.

And thereby finding

that the power of the federal government is the basis for this
enactment to condition expenditure of its funds upon reasonable
restrictions related to the purpose or purposes for which those
grants are made.

This is clear in the legislative history of

the Act —
Q

Mr. Pottinger, this applies only to school

districts that participate in the grant program?

22
MR. POTTINGER:
Q

That is correct.

And is that rather comprehensive throughout the

country or —
MR. POTTINGER:
Q

It is, Mr. Justice.

That is virtually every school district in one

form or another?
MR. POTTINGER:

It would reach virtually all public

school systems.
Q

Well, does it reach all the districts involved in

this case?
MR. POTTINGER:

It does.

There is only one.

The legislative history to Title Vi makes clear that --even the opponents cf the 7vct conceded, indeed discussed in some
colloquy —- the broader basis for the Act, that is broader than
the equal protection clause.
Now, San Francisco, in this particular case, has bound
itself to compliance with Title VI and its regulations and all
requirements of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare
imposed pursuant to those regulations.

Specifically, it has

said in a so-called 441 assurance of compliance that it hereby
agrees that it will comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
and all requirements imposed by or pursuant to the regulation of
the Department of HEW, to the end that no person shall be denied
the benefits of that Act,
Q'

Doesn't the HEW itself have a sanction if it

23

finds non-compliance with the Act, with Title VI, i.e., cutting
off the funds?
MR* POTTINGER:

Yes, Mr. Justice, it does.

In this

particular case, it was not invoked because in fact this case
is in court and HEW under its own regulations has the adminis­
trative discretion to allow the case to go forward toward en­
forcement through the federal courts rather than by a duplicative
administrative process.

Nevertheless, the provisions of Title

VI under the regulations would apply equally, whether the forum
is the Federal District Court or HEW.
Q

Didn't this Court suggest that that was the

remedy, in think in Rosado v. Wyman or one of the New York
cases, that when states are not complying with conditions of
grants that the remedy was to cut off the grants, and that the
District Court had an alternative remedy or a duty indeed to
stop the expenditure of federal money?
MR. POTTINGER:
rect.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that is cor­

That could have been done in this case had the District

Court so found its duty to be such under Title VI.

Of course,

it did not do so because it did not in fact, we believe, give
reasonable consideration to Title VI.
The regulations of Title VI make even more specific
the obligation of school boards not to provide any service or
other benefit in such a xixav that is different from that pro­
vided to other groups of children, to restrict an individual in

24
a way that would restrict his enjoyment of an advantage or
privilege or to deny an individual an opportunity to partici­
pate.

And, of course, as this Court has recognized in such

cases as the Public Utilities Commission of California v. United
States, regulations so issued have the force of law.
Now, in addition to that, however, in interpreting
both the basic protections of Title VI and the regulations, HEW
has indeed gone further.

It has construed the meaning of Title

VI in a national origin discrimination memorandum relevant to
this case by stating that where inability to speak and under­
stand the English language excludes national origin minority
group children from effective participation in the educational
program offered by the school district, the school district must
take affirmative steps to rectify the language deficiency.
Again, as this Court has held in such cases as
Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Insurance, ox* Griggs v. Duke
Power, or Udall v. Tallman, where a consistent administrative
construction of the Act by HEW, like the former regulations of
the Act are shown, that consistent construction is entitled to
great weight.

In fact, HEW for a number of years now has

sought to implement Title VI by this consistent known official
policy in 71 school districts which have been notified of
violations of Title VI, or reviewed for violations, 34 of which
have been notified of non-compliance, 30 of which have been
reviewed pursuant to another statute which refers to the

25
national origin minority memorandum and the like.

There is, in

other words, consistent practice in known contours of what this
policy and practice would lead to.
And may I say at this moment that we in the United
States also appreciate the specter of a chaotic policy that
might flow from a ruling which would require a massive effort
on behalf of virtually every child who could shov; in any sense
an ethnic heritage.
has pointed out,

We are not contending, as Mr. Steinman

(a) that the law would require such chaos or

be — in this particular case, it would be necessary to go
beyond the class of students who are effectively excluded —
Q

Mr. Pottinger, would you relate that concretely

to me to the colloquy we had with your associate on Russians,
Portuguese, Danes, Israelis, et cetera?
MR. POTTINGER:
pleased to.

Yes, Mr, Chief Justice, I would be

I think that there are three points that are

crucial to understanding that specter.

The first is that any

child on account of national origin who may suffer discrimina­
tion is indeed protected under Title VI as well, we believe, as
under the equal protection clause.
The actual remedy of course would be something that
would determine whether a specter truly exists or not, or
whether chaos would exist.

But the right is protected.

Second, we believe it is clear from long-standing
administrative practice at the Department of Health, Education,

and Welfare that effective implementation of Title VI in this
area does not lead to a difficult, or burdensome effort on the
part of

school districts to meet specific needs of virtually

every ethnic minority.

And the reasons for that are simple.

We believe that historically the 3.9th Century system of
assimilation of ethnic minorities, particularly Caucasian
minorities in this country, has been one of a melting pot, but
historically, as this Honorable Court knows, non-Caucasian
minorities in this country have not been able to assimilate in
quite the same fashion, there has been an insularity historic­
ally in this country, and in this particular case that insularity
is even greater where language difficulties or incompatibilities
exist.
Indeed, this case does go beyond the Chinese speaking
community/ it affects the hundredg of thousands of Spanish
speaking children in our society who, although their ancestors
predate my own and many Caucasians in this country, still do not
speak the English language, still are the objects of societal
forms of discrimination and still in the context of this case
are effectively excluded from any participation in the educa­
tional process.
Q

Are you .suggesting that Spanish speaking peop3.e

are not Caucasian?
MR. POTTINGER:
that regard.

Ho.

I would like to correct myself in

I would say Western European Caucasian or Western

27
European whites as the regulations define them.
Q

Well, do you think the Spanish aren't Western

Europeans?
MR. POTTINGER:
Q

The —

Or the Portuguese?

MR. POTTINGER:

The Portuguese and Spanish clearly are

Western European, if my understanding of geography is still
correct, Mr. Justice, but I would hasten to add that the —
without going too much into the history of the Mexican-American
population in this country to a significant degree, that par­
ticular segment of our population has not been treated as
Western European Caucasians.
The point I am trying to make is a simple one, and
that is that the specter of a morass of differing rules and
regulations for virtually all ethnic groups simply has not been
the experience that HEW has had in this field.

Indeed, it has

focused on minorities such as the Spanish speaking and Chinese
minorities of this country, and Indian -American minorities who
il
have suffered historically and continue to suffer from this
kind of exclusion in ways that other minorities typically do
not.

They may and, if shown, of course, their rights are pro­

tected.

But typically we are not faced with that jungle and

welter of regulations.
Q

Do you think our recent opinion in the Farrah

case bears on this one at all in terms of the significance of

28
your guidelines and their validity?
MR. POTTINGER:
is controlling.

Mr. Justice White, I don't believe it.

I believe that we are not. looking to the ques­

tion of alienage versus citizenship in this case.
Q

But you're claimining this is a national origin

discrimination?
MR. POTTINGER:
Q

That is correct.

Although nothing reads on national origin in

school district policy because they teach — they certainly
admit Chinese, they treat all Chinese the same as whites.
MR. POTTINGER:

Mr. Justice White, with all deference

to —
Q

Except for those that they give special instruc­

tion to.
MR. POTTINGER:

Well, I believe that it is net the

case, that they do treat all Chinese the same.
Q

That is your point, I take it?

MR. POTTINGER:

That is correct.

That is the point.

And to underline Mr. Steinman's point in this regard, the class
of petitioners here is excluded entirely.

It is not a question

of balancing careful educational considerations in this case.
There is total,effectively total, virtually total exclusion in
this particular case, as in the case of so many other school
districts which we believe the importance of this decision will
affect.

29

Finally, if I may, I would like to respond to the
question Justice Blackmun raised with regard to congressional
intent.

We believe that the Congress has considered in its

language the question which is presented to the court today.
It presented this not only in terras of mandating regulations
which deal with the issue and specifically the national origin
memorandum which flows lawfully from that Act, but it dealt
with it in section 602 of the Act in which the United States
Congress provided that each federal department — in this case
HEW — which is empowered to extend federal financial assistance,
is authorized, indeed the language is directed to effectuate
the provisions of section 601, the basic three protections,
consistent with the achievement of the statute which authorises
the expenditure of money.

In other words, section 601 protec­

tions are to be defined in part by the objectives to be served
by the funding program.

In this particular case, there are two

critically important funding programs which give meaning and
content to 601, and that is the bilingual programs under Title
VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and Title I
of ESEA which focuses federal money on disadvantaged children.
In both cases, the Congress recognized that HEW would be attempt­
ing to serve the children who were petitioners in this case
with those programs and thereby said specifically that section
602 would incorporate the meaning of those programs into 601,
the basic protections of the Act.

30

Q

Mr. Pottinger, I note in your brief you support

Mr. Steinman's constitutional argument.
MR. POTTINGER:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

But I gather, from what you told us about the

scope of 601, if we agree with this, we don’t have to reach the
constitutional argument, do we?
MR. POTTINGER:

That is possible that that is the case.

We do believe that the equal protection, clause does support the
same relief.

It is possible that there are petitioners or

classes of petitioners who x<?ouid not be affected by federal
funds and thereby be treated separately.
Q

But that is not so here, and ordinarily I think

our practice has been -- our policy, rather, is not to reach
constitutional questions if a statutory determination favorable
to the petitioners can be made.
MR. POTTINGER:

Well, I believe the distinctions that

do exist here may be addressed by Mr. Steinman, if that is
adequate.
Q

But if you are right, and we agreed with vou on

your statutory basis, it would be quite inappropriate to reach
the constitutional issue at all, x^ouldn't it?
MR. POTTINGER:

Well, we believe that with regard to

the effect this decision xvill have on other cases similarly
situated that would not be correct.
Q

In this particular case —

Well, why wouldn't we have other cases?

31
MR. POTTINGER:

Well, that is distinctly possible.

I

would say that the effect of this decision in the court below,
where a 14th Amendment decision has been made adverse to our
position adversely affecting the Department of HEW and perhaps
other school districts in their ability to deal with the
problems that are presented in this case, and to that extent —
Q

Well, I thought all courts were obliged to deal

with statutory issues before constitutional issues, including
the Ninth Circuit?
MR. POTTINGER:

Well, I believe that is the case.

Regrettably the Ninth Circuit chose not to deal with Title VI
in any reasoned way.
Q

But is it clear that the Title VI remedy is

broad enough to reach all the people who are now before the
Court?
MR. POTTINGER:
happen.

Yes, it is correct that that would

Bv the same token, I would like to emphasize that a

decision based on the 14th Amendment now stands in the Ninth
Circuit, and we would hope that this Court would deal with that
because it is so fundamentally in error in our position, and
because of that error it is likely to affect additional cases
such as one recently —
Q

I suggest the technique is simply to decide the

statutory issue and say therefore it is not necessary for us
or* any other court to have reached the constitutional question.

32
Q
did it?

Well, of coarse, the Ninth Circuit had no choice,

It reached the statutory issue and decided it against

the plaintiffs, and then the plaintiffs say, well, even if you
decide the statutory issue against us, we have got a constitu­
tional issue.
did.

The Ninth Circuit had no choice in doing what it

You have given its line of reasoning.
MR. POTTINGER:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

However, by attempting to dispose of the Title VI argument in
virtually a single sentence on the basis of a 14th Amendment
argument was clear error.
Q

Conceivably, it states -- perhaps it is remote,

but it is conceivable — that a state might say if those are the
burdens on Title VI grants, we will reject all these grants and
run our school system without federal aid, and then that case
would present the pure constitutional question, would it not?
MR. POTTINGER;

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Pottinger.

Mr. O'Connor?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. O’CONNOR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. O'CONNOR;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I am here representing the San Francisco School
District, and it is our position, of course, that we don't

33

depreciate or challenge any particular educational aids which
a school district provides, including the one to provide
special instruction in English, for non-speaking English stu­
dents.

In fact, contrary to statements that have been made,

the San Francisco School District, which operates all the
elementary junior high schools and high schools in San
Francisco, has for several years been committed to a policy of
providing this special language instruction not only to Chinese
students but to Spanish children as well, and have now started
a Japanese non-speaking English program in San Francisco.
And in the years 1966-67 the program for the Chinese
children was started.

Commencing in 1967-68, the special in­

struction in English program was started for Spanish speaking
children.

And commencing in 1971-72, a separate special in­

struction in English program was commenced for Filipino children,
which program had been part of the Spanish speaking program up
to this point and, as I mentioned, a special program, for
Japanese speaking children was started this year.
The expenditures on this program rose to $2.37 million
in 1972-73.

For the Chinese program, $1,196,550 was spent dur­

ing that fiscal year.

For the Spanish program, $956,000, and

for the Filipino program, $222,000.
Q

If all of this is true, what is this case about

then?
MR. O’CONNOR:

This case I think is a case which says

that the School Board in San Francisco must supply special in­
struction in English to all students who may require it.
Q

Well, you have told us that you provide it for

Japanes, Filipinos, Chicanos, and Chinese.
Chinese who are involved here.
gram for the Chinese is not

And it is the

What is it, just that your pro­

big enough, is that what the case

is about?
MR. o5 CONNOR:

These are my preliminary statements to

show the disposition of San Francisco as far as an attitude
toward instructing its children who do not speak the language.
Q

Right, and you told us that the practice and

policy is to teach English to these people, and that prompted my
inquiry as to if that is true, what is this case of controversy?
MR. O’CONNOR:

Our contention is that, contrary to

what the plaintiffs in this case stated, they are the group who
has not been reached as far as programs are concerned, and that
San Francisco, under the equal protection clause, must cover
every child with a non-English speaking problem.

It is our con­

tention, of course, that under the equal protection clause this
is not so, that the school district has not the constitutional
duty to provide such instruction.
Q

But if you are doing it, as I thought I had

understood you telling us, that you are, then nobody needs to
decide whether or not it is your constitutional duty.
MR. O’CONNOR:

I didn't mean to say that we were

35
covering the program entirely.

I was saying that the attitude

and the direction and the practice of Sa.n Francisco was to
afford as much of this type of program as it can.
Q

Well, let’s come down to the 1,300.

Are they all

covered or not?
MR. O'CONNOR:

Well, in 1970, when this case was de­

cided, there were — under a stipulation of facts, and it was
not a stipulation that the children, as stated, were doomed,
they did not get education.

The stipulation was that 1,800

needed special instruction in the English language, Chinese
children.
Q

And weren't getting it?

MR. O’CONNOR:

There were 2,856 students in the school

district ttfho were non-English speaking Chinese children, and of
that number 1,800 received no special instruction.
Q

All right.

MR. O'CONNOR:

The remaining 1,066 did receive special

instruction in Chinese in three programs.

One was the Chinese

I

Center program, one was the Bilingual program which was funded
by the federal government, and the third was the ESL program,
English as a Second Language program, which the rest of the
children did get.
And the California Bilingual Education Act of 3.972
called upon the districts in California to specify the children
in their district which had limited English speaking ability,

36
and also to make a list of those children who had no English
speaking ability.

And pursuant to that census which was taken

by the classroom teachers in San Francisco in April of this
year, the extent of the problem and the numbers of children who
do not speak English or who have a limited speaking English
ability at the present time in April of this year are as follows
There are 9,000 children who have either limited
English speaking or no English speaking ability.

And while

we deal only with the Chinese children in this case, I think

other groups are concerned.

That is the inclination of the

However, they have not moved up on the

complete coverage of all these children because of the other
requirements of the budget.

I think that is the answer, in

simple form.
Q

Any other answer, other than lack of money?

MR. O'CONNOR:

Of course, if required under the Con­

stitution to do so, they would, but there is —
Q

You don't think the Constitution requires it?

MR. O'CONNOR:

That is my point.

I do not.

I think

1

that this is one of the great, purposes of the country education,
but as stated in the decision of this Court in the Rodrigues
case, it is not a fundamental right, it is not a fundamental
constitutional right, so that the great aim and problem and
work of school districts in states in the educational field,
while one of the most important, is not one that unless every
facet of the problem is covered is one where a person can come
into court and state "I am not covered."
Q

Do you think that you may possibly be running

39

into some equal protection problems if you give some Chinese,
non-English speaking Chinese training in English and do not
give it to others when they are, except for that difference,
exactly the same, part of a category, an identifiable group?
They can't speak English, they are of Chinese origin.

Perhaps

you can address yourself to that right after lunch.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 o'clock noon, the Court was in
recess, to reconvene at 1:00 o’clock p.m„, the same day.]

40
AFTERNOON SESSION - 1:00 O'CLOCK

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. O'Connor, you may

resume.
MR. O’CONNOR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I believe your question, Mr. Chief Justice, was what
is the classification between the Chinese students who do re­
ceive special English education and those who do not.

The

classification in this case, if the Court please, is something
that the original petitioners have made.

It is our position

that, as a constitutional matter, under the equal protection
clause, there is no constitutional duty to supply any of the
non-English Chinese students these special courses in the
English language.
Q

But ray question was, if you give it to some,

then does that raise equal protection problems for giving it to
all?

Suppose, for example, that you gave automobile licenses

to one group but denied it to the others and they are, except
for that, alike?
MR. O’CONNOR:

As far as education is concerned, these

are educational policy questions, when they don’t arise ■—
Q

Well, is there a. policy with reference — is

there a policy that explains why several hundred of them get it
and several hundred don't get it, or is it just the accident of
the shortage of funds in the budget?

41
MR. 0'CONNOR:
things.

Well,, it is just a. combination of

That is one of the factors.

I will avert to what has

been talked about, the immigration problem in San Francisco.
It is the increasing number of non-English Chinese speaking
students that are coming in, it is the —
Q

Iiow do they pick the ones that are going to get

it distinguished from those who are not going to get it?
MR. O'CONNOR:

There is a certain limit to the number

and I have been advised that they are taken into the Chinese
Center to determine their ability.

But because there aren't

enough teachers and enough classes, it is really by waiting
lists.
Q

Well, is there anything in this record that shows

how many teachers in the San Francisco system

.speak both

English and Chinese?
MR. O'CONNOR:
Q

I do not believe so, Mr. Chief Justice.

Well, are you suggesting a shortage of teachers?

I get some intimations of that, a shortage of qualified people
to teach?
MR. O'CONNOR:

Well, that is part of the problem, of

course, especially with the Chinese language, to get qualified
teachers.

But, of course, again, with unlimited resources,

that is a problem that could be surmounted.

I say it is partly

a question of resources of the school district.

And in

California, and in San Francisco in particular, the school

42
district is operating to the limit of its budget, so it would
mean a reallocation of items to fully staff this program.

And

of course, 1 might add that this is one of the competing special
educational features which children with other handicaps require
attention of the school board as well.
It has been mentioned that the Chinese are a suspect
classification and there has been a long history of discrimina­
tion against the Chinese.

In this connection, I would like to

briefly revert to or speak about the decision in Guey Heung Lee
v. David Johnson, in which Mr. Justice Douglas denied the appli­
cation for a stay after a denial by the District Court and the
Circuit Court and the Court of Appeals in this case.

I want

to state that this was not a petition by the School District of
San Francisco.

If was a petition by some Chinese parents who

did not wish to have their children moved from the schools in
Chinatown to the schools that were provided for them under the
integration order .in the case that the city and county school
district was involved in.

That is Johnson v. San Francisco

Board of Education.
Q

As I recall, San Francisco did have a history of

a de jury segregated school system, didn’t it?
MR. 0’CONNOR:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Douglas,

and that is what I wanted to talk about.

You mentioned in your

decision, and correctly, properly, and rightly so, that under
the education code of California there was a provision, not

43

repealed until 1947, that there could be provided for Chinese,
Japanese and children of Mongolian origin separate schools, and
if separate schools were provided these children could not
attend other schools.
Now, I can speak from the experience now of fifty
years, and research confirms it, that in San Francisco there has
not been a separate school under this statute as far as any
children of San Francisco are concerned, including Chinese
children.

And it is a fact that the Chinese, like the Irish

and the Italians, who first settled around the Chinatown area,
when they fanned out over the city to the various neighborhoods
and went to the neighborhood schools, the Chinese children did
so as well.

And I ran across, which I think the Court might be

interested in, a recent book called "Long Time Californian," a
documentary study of an American Chinatown by Victor and Barry
Nee, and an account of an interview with Leland Chin, who is
now age 73, and he is on the staff of the Young China Daily.
He stated that he left San Francisco after the fire and earth­
quake and went up to a small town on the Sacramento River and
xtfhen his father found that he couldn't attend a school there
he returned to San Francisco and went to Lowell High School.
He says, "Well, in 1910, my parents sent me back to San
Francisco because Orientals weren't allowed in the schools
down there.

I was going to Lowell High School and there I met

some young Chinese students."

And Lowell High School, we have

44
mentioned in our brief, was than and is now the academic high
school in San Francisco where, as we mention in our brief, the
Chinese have a greater percentage in that school than their
city-wide percentages for high school students as the academic
school of San Francisco, and in 19.10 Mr. Chin went there.

That

of the city.

And who aren’t taught anything?

MR. O’CONNOR:
Q

And who aren't taught anything, is that right?

MR. O’CONNOR:

Well, they aren't taught, by special

instruction in English.
Q

Well, they are only given English books?

Do you

say they are being taught?
MR. O’CONNOR:
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice.

How are non-English speaking Chinese taught by

non-Chinese teaching English persons?

How can you teach that

way?
MR. O'CONNOR:

I revert I think to the statement in

Meyer v. Nebraska, which of course was the leading case on the

45
question of English in the schools and where Mr, .Justice Holmes
dissented from the opinion, but stated that the best thing for
young children — and I think he mentioned the Poles and
Russians who have no English in their homes, was to come to
the schools and not be taught in German primarily, so that —
Q

Well, are you teaching these children Chinese?

MR, O'CONNOR:
Q

So that —

MR. O'CONNOR:

They are being taught, those that

aren’t covered —
Q

Well, Meyer1s was teaching German.

teaching Chinese?

Well, is this

If it doesn't, Meyer’s doesn’t have anything

to do with it.
MR. O’CONNOR:

Well, he stated, and I want to follow

it up, that the best thing for a child who can’t speak the
language to do without any special instruction is to come to an
English speaking school.

And I think common experience, as

well as some of the authorities, although bilingual or special
courses are better, nevertheless by the immersion process a
child learns to speak, and especially a child because it is
easier, the authorities say, for a child to learn language by
total immersion than other individuals.
Q

Did these children get anv training in the

English language that can be taught to a Chinese speaking
person?

The answer is no, isn't it?

MR. 0"CONNOR:

No, no formal training.

Would you say it is a little bit effective?

MR. O’CONNOR:

I say it is, yes, effective, not to the

extent that —
Q

And why are these children singled out for that

little bit of effective treatment?

47
MR. O’CONNOR:

Because the program as yet hasn’t

covered them, but —
Q

Well, when it reaches the point that it will

cover them, they will be out of school, won’t they?
MR. O'CONNOR:

They find that children on the waiting

list — and I have been told this -— go back to the school
where there is no special language education, and by the time
they get back to number one on the waiting list, they no longer
have a need for this special education.
Q

Are you violating the guidelines put out by the

federal government?
MR. O'CONNOR:
Q

I believe not.

Why not?

MR. O'CONNOR:

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act

speaks of discrimination on the basis of race, minority national
origin.

No Chinese speaking child is discriminated against in

any of these courses.

He has the same education as others.

He

may not be able to benefit by it as much, but it is not up to
the HEW to determine what effect this has.

I think that it is

not —
Q

Oh, you think HEW doesn’t have that authority?

MR. O'CONNOR:

I think it has the authority, but

until it is declared by this Court to be a deprivation of con­
stitutional rights or —
Q

I didn't say constitutional rights, Mr. O'Connor,

48
i said the guidelines put out by HEW.

Bo you violate those or

not?
MR. O’CONNOR:

Z believe not.

The guidelines adopted

in 1970 talks for effective programs for non-English speaking
children, and in the grants which San Francisco has, for. in­
stance, under Title VII of the education act for a bilingual
program, this is not only a program which HEW gives the funds
for to teach this particular — or to help solve this particular
problem, but requires that on the basis of Title VI that 'there
be no discrimination, and in that program children of other
national origins are included.

Tha other program, as mentioned

in the —•
Q

Well, you dcn"t agree with the Assistant Attorney

General at all then, do you?
MR. O * CONNOR:
Q

I do not.

The other program under —

Assuming he is right, then can we decide this

case on that point without reaching the constitutional point?
MR. O’CONNOR:

Yes, except that I think this record

shows that
Q

Well, could we?

MR. O’CONNOR:
Q

Yes.

Could we?
Yes, Mr. Justice.

Do you think if the statute itself or the regula­

tions —■ let's assume the statute itself expressly said that
in order to qualify for grants the states must undertake
training in English language for those who need it, such as the

49
Chinese in San Francisco, let's assume that it just said that
expressly, would you have any doubt about the congressional
power to enact that statute?
MR. O’CONNOR:

No, I would not, and that would be

part of the statute, a direct statement and —
Q

Would you think that is —■ what constitutional

power would you consider that to be an exercise of, the spending
power to condition a grant of money on rational conditions?
MR. O'CONNOR:
Q

Yes, under the —

But it doesn’t have to be valid under the 14th

Amendment, I take it?
MR. O’CONNOR:
Q

No, I would sav not.

Well, now, if Congress had said that, and you

would think that it constitutionallv could, would San Francisco
be bound bv it in the sense — is San Francisco participating
in this grant program so that you would be bound by the statute?
MR. O’CONNOR:

If there was a statute specifically

directing this, yes, I would say so.
Q

And if we construed the statute or construed the

regs or guidelines to the same effect, then I suppose we wouldbe —■ necessarily we would decide
MR. O’CONNOR:

against you?

Yes, except I think there is a further

point, whether San Francisco, in connection with any grant of
monies in education,has not included Chinese children.
Q

Yes.

50

MR. O'CONNOR:

And even under the Title VI grant, for

compensatory education for children, the appendix shows that
the Commodore Stockton School in Chinatown was included with a
special program for the children in that school as part of the
poverty area covered by that program.

So, yes, except under

the circumstances, I don't think even under that construction
San Francisco has violated any guideline.
Q

But, Mr. O'Connor, I gather if Title VI does

reach this kind of program, the funding would be adequate, would
it not, to include these plaintiffs as v;ell as those presently
being taught in those programs?
MR. O’CONNOR:
Q

No, it would not.

It would not?

MR. O'CONNOR:

In fact, in San Francisco itself, under

its own funds in the last fiscal year, supplies over 50 percent
of the funds needed for these programs.
Q

But if the conditions were that all of these

plaintiffs, as well as the other Chinese children, had to be
given the benefit of this kind of teaching under Title VI, San
Francisco would have to match whatever the federal grant was,
would it not?
MR. 0’CONNOR:
Q

Right.

If it didn't, the federal grant I gather could

be withdrawn in its entirety.
MR. O'CONNOR:

Is that right?

I believe that is correct.

51
Q

Mr. O’Connor, let me put this hypothetical ques­

tion to you and maybe shed some light for me.

Let’s start with

the assumption that there is no constitutional obligation on the
part of the state to furnish any public schools at all, assume
that for the moment.

But then the state and the local govern­

ment does undertake to furnish schools, but they have enough
money to take care of only 18,000 children in the primary
schools, and there are 20,000, and you just put the other 2,000
on the waiting list and say, well, we will work you in when we
get enough money in the budget.

Do you think that would give

you any equal protection problems?
MR. O'CONNOR:

Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justice.

I think

under Brown v. Board of Education, that where free public
education is supplied, it must be done on an equal basis.
Q

Well, then, how do you distinguish that between

giving this English language training to a thousand or 1,400
of the Chinese speaking students and not giving it to 400, 500
or 800 who are on the waiting list?
MR. O'CONNOR:

I think that this is not part of what

may be called minimum basic education.
Q

To teach the English language?

MR. O’CONNOR:

I think it is — I am not admitting,

Mr. Chief Justice, that the English language is not spoken
without the special courses, bu.fc supposing that is the case, it
is extremely important, one of the most important functions of

52
■the department to teach these pupils. but there are also other
competing and, soma may say, equally important matters that the
school department must cover beyond this minimum education.
deaf were mentioned, the mentally retarded, the disabled.

The
I

think those are questions that must be left to the discretion of
the administrative authorities on the local level, the state
guidance, if it be by state statute, and that the court will net
decide between priorities.

And I contend that the teaching of

English by the special courses is one of these educational
priorities.

And I think the point that, say, a thousand are

left out shows that in San Francisco the school board has
demonstrated that it considers this a highly important matter,
but that with the thousand left out as of now, they cannot be
covered because in the estimation of the school board there are
equally important special problems to be covered.
Q

Mr. O'Connor, if you lose this case, what will

happen, is the city likely to withdraw all special instruction
to all Chinese?
MR. 0’CONNOR:

I cannot answer that, Mr. Justice

Blackmun, except to state that as of now the city is covering
over 50 percent of the $2.7 million that is now spent on this
program „
Q

Well, Mr. O'Connor, I notice in Mr. Pottinger's

brief that — footnote 4 on page 12, I think this has connection
with Mr. Justice Blackmun’s question.

It stated that you are

53
already obligation by contracts to comply with both the regula­
tions and guidelines.

You contractually agreed to comply with

Title VI and all requirements imposed by HEW and immediately to
take any measures necessary to effectuate this agreement, and
Mr. Pottinger cites a case, Sumter County School District, for
the proposition that that contract is binding and specifically
enforcible.

Is that so?

MR. O'CONNOR:
Q

Yes, no question about it.

Wall, if that is so, I suppose, so long as that

contract is effective, San Francisco is not at liberty to
pull out of the program, is it?
MR. O'CONNOR:

No, it must abide by all valid regula­

tions .
Q

Can you terminate the program at any time, your

participation in this?
MR. O’CONNOR:
Q

You have a grant?

MR. O'CONNOR:
Q

Yes.

Well, you, could withdraw it.

MR. O’CONNOR:
Q

Not under a grant of this sort.

We could redraw from it, yes.

At the end of the year, at the and of the

period.
MR. 01 CONNOR:
Q
this contract?

Depending on the terms of the contract.

Well, do you know what those terms are under

54
MR. O'CONNOR:

I haven't specific information., but it

is grant terms, I presume.
Q

Which would be annual or something?

MR. O'CONNOR:

They are annual.

And I understand that

the funding by the federal government, under Title VII, expired
as of the end of this fiscal year, so that there are no more
federal funds available under the Title VII bilingual program
participation.
The question has been of discrimination and past his­
tory of discrimination, and my adverting to the opinion was to
admit, of course, that there was education code 3007, but San
Francisco has not followed that for fifty years, and also to
point out that, as mentioned earlier, it is our view that, it is
not anything to do with the discrimination in any respect that
all of the Chinese children are not covered.

It is directly

the involvement of the recent immigration of Chinese from —
into the United States.

Our briefs document not only the

change of the immigration act of 1968 but point out also that,
under President Kennedy's program earlier, the refugees from
Hong Kong carae into San Francisco, and just to illustrate, in
the interrogatories, which were answered by the school district
in 1970, it said immigrants who arrived in this country between
September '68 and September 1969 as children to the schools,
those were the interrogatories — answer, 691, covering only
the three schools in the Chinatown area.

Immigrants who arrived

in this country between September 1969 and since September
1969 — answer, at page 57, 533,
influx of immigrants

So there has been a tremendous

and children into the United States in the

last years, which has been the cause of this problem, and it
has nothing absolutely to do with the historical discrimination
against -Q

I take it you disagree with the professor's

suggestion that there were as many underprivileged back in '67
as there are now?
MR. O'CONNOR:
Q

As many unprivileged?

Yes, who were not receiving English instruction.

His point I thought made three times was that this is not
attributable to the relaxation of the immigration requirements.
You disagree with that?
MR. O'CONNOR:
0

Yes, I do.

Mr. O'Connor, have there been any demands upon

the San Francisco school system to conduct any classes in. the
Chinese language?
MR. O'CONNOR:
Q

Demands on the school department?

Yes, by these people or similarly situated people.

MR. 0'CONNOR:

Back to the Heung case, the main

reason, one of the main .reasons why the parents in Chinatown
didn't wish their children to move from the neighborhood schools
— and, incidentally, the order of the Court has gone into
effect and the schools, the three neighborhood schools with the

56

predominantly Chinese students are not? in 13 schools in a much
larger area, their main reason was that they would not be — one
of the reasons alleged was they would not be close to the
Chinese schools which were operated not by the school depart­
ment but by the Chinese community.

As far as I kncrw, there

have never been any demands upon the department itself to teach
Chinese, although —
0

Well, 1 mean to teach classes, teach a.rithmetic,

or whatever, in the Chinese language, is what I am asking about,
not to teach the Chinsse language, but to teach school in the
Chinese language.
MR. O'CONNOR:
Q

The bilingual —

Teach arithmetic or geography or social studies,

or whatever.
MR. O'CONNOR:

The limited bilingual program in San

Francisco is designed to teach in Chinese until the child
reaches a level where he can progress into the English language.
So in that sense, certain subjects are taught by bilingual
teachers to Chinese speaking children in Chinese.
Q

In the schools located in the Chinatown area of

San Francisco, have in the past any classes been taught in
Chinese?

Nov?, again, I don’t mean teaching the Chinese

language, I mean teaching arithmetic in Chinese.
MR. O'CONNOR:

Traditionally, the Commodore Stockton

and the other two schools in Chinatown have been predominantly

57
Chinese schools with Chinese students, that is 80 percent, 90
percent„
Q

And by Chinese, I expect you mean, if I under­

stood here, actually Americans of Chinese descent?
MR. 0’CONNOR:
0

Right.

Isn't that what most of them have been?

MR. O'CONNOR:

Yes.

And once again, I don't have

statistics, but I have knowledge of this, where there was such
a mingling of the Chinese in that school by teachers who not
only spoke Chinese but students who not only spoke English and
Chinese that there was in effect a bilingual atmosphere whereby
English was learned by those x*?ho could not speak it.
Q

And is that now disappearing because of the

school desegregation orders?
MR. O'CONNOR:

I cannot say that myself as a fact,

but the 80 and 90 percent concentration in the neighborhood
schools in Chinatown has — is not there any more.,

It is more

like a percentage of 50 percent, whereas in the schools in
surrounding area in the

2one

have from 15 to 20 percent Chinese.

So the problem, say, of getting the course in one place
rather than having it spread out has been made more difficult,
Q

Mr. O'Connor, may I ask you one question.

What

is your position with respect to the memorandum of HEW of July
10, 1970?

That is the memorandum that is addressed specific­

ally to this problem.

It is at the top of the page, on page 12

58
of the SG's brief,

it has been alluded, to in this argument.

MR. O'CONNOR:

My position is that this regulation

states that it is under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964.

I believe it is beyond the scope of the authority given

in that statute, and that Title VI does not purport to go into
programs for teaching those who have language disability, and
that school authorities are in no position to know what this
regulation means at the time that they obtain the grant, and
it is indefinite and beyond the scope — not the regulation
that is indefinite, but it is an indefinite application of the
limits of authority which are covered by Title VI.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
expire, Mr. 0 * Connor.

I think your time has

Thank you.

Mr. Sfceinman, one practical problem that may or may
not be lurking in this case, I gather that there are at least
two, three and perhaps more major Chinese dialects spoken in
such form that a person from one area of China can barely
communicate with another.

What is the obligation of the state,

must they have classes in the Cantonese dialect and then in
soma other dialect?
REBUTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD H. STEINMAN, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. STEINMAN:

Well, I think that what has been hap­

pening, Your Honor, is that the Court is focusing on only one
possible method, that would be a bilingual method, where the

teacher speaks Chinese as well as English.

In San Francisco

today though ? the method most commonly employed —
Q

Well, which Chinese?

Which Chinese dialect,

that is what I am asking?
MR. STEIKMAM;

Well, the problem — it is a problem

which the city has never alluded to.
particular dialect.

I don't really know the

In San Francisco, most of the Chinese

speaking students who are receiving help, not included within
the 1,800 petitioners, are receiving help in a method called
"English As A Second Language,” in which the teacher does not
speak Chines®, in which the teacher employs special methods-it is almost like a Berlitz type approach — the teacher employs
special methods.
The point we are raising is that what method to
utilize is the decision for the school system.

The problem

that the 1,800 students face is that today they are receiving
nothing, just regular instruction.
In response to Mr. Justice Blackman's comment about
whether or not there is any record concerning this as a problem
of recent origin, let me just cite that at page 45 of the
appendix, the respondents admitted in November of 1967, seven
months before the immigration relaxation cams about

and,

again, there is no dispute that the numbers have been increased
because of immigration relaxation — but seven months before
the immigration quotas even came into effect, the respondents

60
admitted that 1,982 non-English Chinese speaking students were
in San Francisco public schools needing special instruction,
not understanding the language of instruction, and getting
nothing.
And my point is that the school system has long known,
the record shows as far back as 1949 the school system made
statements on this, again it is in the appendix, the school
system knows that these students don't know English.

The

school system admits and knows that they cannot learn English
sitting and languishing in regular classrooms.

The school

system —
Q

Sooner or later they will learn to communicate,

but not very rapidly.
MR. STEINMAN:
Ycur Honor.

That is something which is debatable,

The school system has never even said that the

students will learn — to use Mr. O’Connor's words — by
immersion.

There is no contention by the school system that if

they sit in these classes they will learn.
Q

To the contrary —

Well, those that are now getting instruction, do

they learn English?
MR. STEINMAN:

Those getting the special help, yes.

We are not disputing what the method those students —
Q

Now do those programs succeed?

MR. STEINMAN:
is that they do succeed.

I am not an educator.

My understanding

Our point is that we want the school

61

system to use some method because right now, Mr. Justice White,
the school system admits that if no method is employed, these
these students "will inevitably be doomed to be dropouts."
Now, we contend that *~~
Q

That isn’t what your colleague there said a

little while ago.

Fie said that it was effective.

MR. STEINMAN:
to 104.

Well, I am citing appendix pages 103

Mr. O'Connor is, I believe, making statements that are

not reflected by the record.

The school system has admitted,

even before this law suit was brought, that these students
cannot learn, that they are "inevitably doomed," that they are
frustrated by their inability to understand the regular word.
That is a quote that appears at appendix page 101.
Our contention is that this system is totally irra­
tional, that a school system which states that its purpose is
to provide educational opportunities, which they said its
purpose is to have students develop the mastery of English,
provides 1,300 students a program which guarantees that they
will not learn this.

Mr. O'Connor says today the situation

is such that 1,445 students are affected.
get into that type of issue.

I am not going to

If the Court wants further data

on the current situation, I will be glad to provide it.

My

understand is that it is even more.
But even today, the Court concedes ~ the respondents
concede that there are close to 1,450 students who languish in

62
classes and do not even get the type of education which the
respondents in their publications state as their goal.
Q

I notice 4a and 5a of your brief, is this con­

tract, Title VI contract, which apparently dates back to 1965
--- how does the school district get out from under that if it
wants to?
MR. STEINMAN:

My understanding is that the — and I

just checked with Mr. Pottinger — that the school system at
the end of a given contract year can refuse to, you know, say
we don’t wish to participate any more.

The problem that we

face clearly in this case, we are claiming as a statutory
violation.

The problem that we are facing is that obviously

federal funds can be pulled out, as Mr. O'Connor alluded to;
obviously, San Francisco can choose not to go into a federal
program, and then what happens to these students?
As we have said, we think that the respondents own
stated —
Q

Well, I gather, at least the breadth of this

contract xrauld indicate that you can’t get out of the particular
program but that you have to get out of all programs, all Title
VI programs that are covered by this contract.
MR. STEINMAN:

Mr. Pottinger agrees with your inter­

pretation.
Q

And San Francisco couldn't just drop this one,

it would have to drop all funded programs, wouldn't it?

63
MR, STEINMAN;

That1 s right«,

And, as Mr« 01 Connor

said,, he does not know what they would do.
Q

Well, practically, how much of -— Title VI pro­

grams, that is — just how much practically is that a problem?
MR. STEINMAN:
Q

Well, I cannot —

What you are getting at is, you want us to de­

cide the constitutional question.

But I am putting to you, why

should we if we can decide this on the statute?
MR.STEINMAN:

Your Honor, I am just saying that the

possible problems in the future which the Court, if it does not
wish to address now, it need not.
Q

Well, can't we wait until they arise if the

Statute protects you, covers it?
MR. STEINMAN:

If that is the Court's wish, naturally

We are —
Q

Well, don't we usually?

MR. STEINMAN;

Mv understanding is that in seme cases

especially cases where we have national origin type of problems
race problems, some of the segregation cases, that this Court,
when faced with a combined statutorv-constitution argument,
has chose not to.
to decide.

Naturally, this is something for the Court

We are dealing with a national origin group.
Q

Do you remember one of those where we have done

that?
MR. STEINMAN:

My understanding is in some of the

64
segregation cases raised in the late sixties involved both
complaints under civil rights as well as constitutional.
Q

Can you give me an example?

MR. STEINMAN2
Q

I cannot give you one.

I gather an intimation from what you said that as

a practical matter? the State of California or any particular
school district could not afford to withdraw totally from
federal programs? that is their losses would be far more than
their gains even if the result was that they did not need to
run any special schools for —
MR. STEINMAN:

I would guess that would be true.

I

think there is one other point that when you are —
Q

Do you know offhand what in millions of dollars,

how much California is getting under these programs?
MR. STEINMAN:

No, I don’t know offhand.

I know that

San Francisco —
Q

But it is a very large sum of money?

MR. STEINMAN:

Yes, and San Francisco is receiving

large sums of money for the programs that it is now operating.
Q

Vastly more? I should assume, than the $2 million

they are now spending for the second language program?
MR. STEINMAN:

Well? the $2 million is for all non-

English speaking people in San Francisco, the Chinese as much
as ----Q

And only half of that —

65
MR. STEINMAN:

For the petitioners, the Chinese

speaking people, it is much less.

One thing which 'I think the

Court should be aware of is that right noxtf, currently, facing
the facts of the record from 1970, the school system in San
Francisco is spending an average of $1,300 per child.
figures now is close to $2,000 per child.

And for 1,800

students right now this money is being wasted.
is spending money on these petitioners.
that.

The

San Francisco

We are not denying

They are spending money to put them in regular class­

rooms and have a teacher be paid, et cetera.

And right now the

school system is wasting millions of dollars, and this is one
of the responses that we have in that it is not a matter that
the school system suddenly is going to have to come up with
all this money, that they are now spending monies from which
students are receiving no types of benefits.
Mr. Pottinger has given me a figure, Your Honor, that
currently I guess this is all Title — all monies under HEW
for San Francisco schools, is $11 million in San Francisco.
Q

Mr. Steinman, would your constitutional grievance

be met if the classes were conducted for these 1,800 children
in Chinese, if they went to a school where they could learn
manual training and arithmetic and domestic science and things
like that in Chinese?
MR. STEINMAN:

If the school system feels, Mr. Justice

Stewart, that the most effective way for these children to gain

GG
the mastery of English is to teach them only in Chinese, then
I would bow to their decision,,

The fact of the matter is that

there is no program that. I know of which immerses the child
only in his own language to learn another language.
lingual program uses both languages.

The bi­

The teacher has the

facilities in both languages.
Q

I am just asking about your constitutional

grievance.
MR. STEINMAN:

So long as the children would not be

effectively excluded from having understanding the instruction
given in other courses, my constitutional grievance I think
might be settled.

Now, if their entire program was going to be

in Chinese for twelve years, that is something else, because
California says that it could not be under California lavs.
Q

But we are talking about your constitutional

grievance, not California laws.
MR. STEINMAN:
Q

If they were just taught Chinese —

Just taught in Chinese.

MR. STEINMAN:

I would think that they would then

possibly have a constitutional grievance if they wished to be
taught what other students in California are being taught, that
ic in the English language which —
Q

A good deal of theory, educational theory around

sometimes, at least by people who take an extreme position,
sometimes couched in terms of the Constitution, that it is

67
wrong to homogenize everybody, it is wrong to destroy the cul­
ture and the traditions of various groups, be they American
Indians or Chinese or American Negroes or whoever, that it is
incumbent upon the schools, for example, to conduct classes in
the vernacular of the so-cal3.ed ghettos where American Negroes
live, rather than in the kind of English that you and I are
speaking to

each other, hopefully.

MR. STEINMAN:

I believe what you are alluding to,

sir, is bilingual programs where —
Q

No, I am not.

MR. STEINMAN:
Q

I am not.

Pardon ms.

I'm sorry.

And I wonder if there might not be alternative

answers therefore to ycur consti.tutional grievance.
MR. STEINMAN:

The alternative answers would be with­

in the methods and programs devised by the school system.

All

we want the school system to do is provide programs which would
meet the right now the effective exclusion.

If the school

system chooses that type of program and it turns out to be
effective, then we would not complain.

We. are not asking this

Court, to choose one method over another.
0

It might be a little hard to teach Shakespeare

or Charles Dickens in Chinese, might it not?
MR. STEINMAN:

I think it would be, Your Honor.

I

think that is what the bilingual program, the English aspect
is utilized.
