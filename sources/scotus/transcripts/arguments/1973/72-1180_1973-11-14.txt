MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 72-1180, Old Dominion Branch Wo. 496, National
Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, at al., v. Henry M.
Austin, et al.
Mr. Ratner, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF' MOZART G. RATNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. RATHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on appeal from a judgement of the
Supreme Court of Virginia affirming three separate judgements
of $55,000.00 each — a nice figure of $165,000.00 in all —
against the Richmond branch of the National Association of
Letter Carriers and the parent National Association.

The

three plaintiffs, beneficiaries of these judgements, are in­
dividual latter carriers who refused deliberately and willfully
to join the union.,
Because of that refusal, they were identified as
“scabs" in the local branch's monthly newsletter to its mem­
bers.

And in one issue, the'branch published a pejorative

definition of "scab," popularly attributed to Jack London,
followed by a list of "scabs," which named the nonmembers —
some fifteen of them, including' the three plaintiffs.
At least since 1897, according to the CENTURY DIC-

4
TIONARY ENCYCLOPEDIA, which is quoted at page 51 of the Appendix,
in labor parlance a "scab” is a workman who is not , or refuses
to become a member of a labor union.
Q

Was that definition furnished along with the

other definition in this publication?
MR. RATNER:

That definition was not printed, but the

record is unequivocally clear that all of the plaintiffs and
everyone else knew the reason they were being called ’’scabs"
was.

That they had been importuned and pleaded with and begged

to join the union, and they refused willfully and deliberately
to do so.
Q

Mr. Katner, that's twice you've used the word.

"willfully."
MR. RATHER:
Q

Yes.

Normally this connotes guilt.

Are you using it

in that frame of reference?
MR. RATMER:

No.

I have no meaning, no implication

in that word in that context other than, they were not newly on
the job, had not had a chance to be approached, had not had a
chance to consider the problem -— they had made a deliberate
choice, is all I meant to say.
Q

Well, I think that is not the correct use of the

word "willfully."

I suggest that you •—*

MR. RATHER:

I beg your pardon.

I will change it.

They had deliberately elected not to join the union.

5
Q

Mr. Ratner, I don’t suppose you found in the

Dictionary any difinition of a ''scab," and here I quote from
page 72, I think, of the Appendix, as "a traitor to his God,
his country, his family and his class."
MR. RATHER:
Q

Well, I was coming to that.

My question was, is it in the dictionary?

MR. RATHER:

I don’t suppose that the dictionaries

wanted to print Jack London's definition as being part of the
commonly accepted definition of a scab.

Jack London was ela­

borating, in literary fashion, about vrhat his conception of a
scab was.

No, it’s not a literary dictionary definition.

The

'’scab” is an artist's conception.
Q

Did the publication identify that quotation as

coming from Jack London?
MR. RATNER:

The publication itself did not.

fact, the publication does.
Or maybe it's 74.

In

Page 52, I believe, of the record.

In any event, immediately after the article
Page 77 appears the card from which the editor

of the local caper derived the text of the article.
published by the Richmond Trades Industrial Council.

That was
And that,

defendant’s Exhibit 5, clearly shows that “A Scab," by Jack
London, well known author of "Call of the Wild," "Sea Wolf,"
etc., when, as your Honors will see, the local branch, in re­
sponse to a question by plaintiff Austin, saying he didn't
know what a "scab" was, published the London definition.

It

6

said that some people seemed to be in a quandry as to what a
"scab” is — we offer the following.

It did not say that it

was the only definition? it did not say it was a dictionary
definition; it said that it was a definition,, and a definition
it certainly was, consisting of a well known literary labor
cla33ic„ attributed, at least, if not written by, Jack London.
In any event —
Q

One of the dictionary definitions, I'm interested

to see, is that a "scab" is a low or contemptible person.

Did

you know that?
MR. RATNER:

Yes, sir.

I do believe that the CENTURY

DICTIONARY ENCYCLOPEDIA, which I quoted earlier, dated 1897,
describes the scab as "an opprobious term used by the workmen
or others who dislike his action."

Now, I assume that that

means that to trade unionists those who refuse to join are low
and contemptible people,

The record here reflects that both

the president of the local union, and the vice president of the
national, stated their reasons for believing the so-called
"free riders," who take the advantage of union representation
without bearing their fair share of the cost, or any share of
the cost, who are willing to profit from the benefits and the
efforts of their fellows to maintain v/ages and working condi­
tions , who do, as one of the plaintiffs here did — Ziegengeist
perform services off the clock, on free time, gratis, for
his employer, are, in fact, low and contemptible people.

They

choose to undermine the conditions for which workers have or­
ganised and have fought and struggled.

That is their opinion

of them, and it is our contention that both the National Labor
Relations laws and the First Amendment guarantee their right
among themselves to express that opinion, for the lawful pur­
pose of exerting social pressure upon the nonmembers to join.
Now, we think that that proposition is supported by
the decisions of this Court.

The questions principally pre­

sented are., whether as a matter of federal preemption a state’s
jurisdiction over defamation arising out of labor disputes is
limited to knowing or reckless misrepresentation of facts.
Q

Of course, those are somewhat temperate defini­

tions that you're giving.

This publication, in effect, said,

did it not, that these plaintiffs in that case — the respon­
dents here — in effect, were gentlemen compared with Judas,
who betrayed his master by linking these alleged London defi­
nition of a scab with these men.
MR. RATNER:

’four Honor, I take it that there is no

line that can be drawn, constitutionally, between the vividness
of the hyperbole, which can be protected, and that which is
not,,

I do not believe that the Constitution or Linn, either

one, distinguish the epithets which are particularly remarked
in Linn as falling within the commonplace discussion.
And one of the labor board cases which specifically
says that this London definition, itself, is protected under

Section 7 P as falling without the area of protected speech in
labor controversies, whereas this Court said, in Linn itself,
"We do not judge by the normal standards of gentlemanly and po­
lite speech,"

In labor controversies, the Court has pointed out,

labor disputes are ordinarily heated affairs.

The language that

is commonplace there might well be deemed actionable per se in:
some state jurisdictions.

Representation campaigns are fre­

quently characterised by bitter and extreme charges, counter­
charges , unfounded rumors, vituperations, personal accusations,
misrepresentations and distortions.

Both labor and management

often speak bluntly and recklessly, embellishing their respec­
tive positions with imprecatory language.
Q

Mr. Ratner —

MR. RATNER:
Q

This is v/ord in —

Yes?

As I read Linn, and my reading is kind of reinfor­

ced by the quote you just read, it did arise in the context of
a representational proceeding — a dispute between management
and labor.

Was there such a dispute that this thing arose out

of?
MR. RATNER:

This arose out of the efforts of the

union to bring into membership the remaining nonmembers who
were employed in the postals career service.

To answer your

question shortly and bluntly, there was no legal proceeding
pending before the National Labor Relations Board.
Q

Well, was there any dispute between labor and

9

management?
MR. RATNER:

No.

As far as we know.

There was a dis­

pute between the members of the union and the nonmembers, which
in Senn v. the Tile Layers Onion, this Court has held to con­
stitute a labor dispute? and which Section 29 of the National
Labor Relations Act explicitly defines as a labor dispute.
And which Angelos v. Cafeteria Workers explicitly holds is a
labor dispute,

/lay effort by a union to induce nonmembers to

join is, per se, a labor dispute, yes.
Now, in that context, to come back to —
Q

Mr. Rafcner, I take it that as far as the use of

the word "scab1* is concerned, it certainly is a true appella­
tion here, is it not?
MR. RATHER:
Q

Yes, your Honor, it's absolutely true.

In any definition of the terra.

And it’s your

position, is it, that the rest of the material in this publi­
cation is just rhetorical hyperbole, so to speak?
MR. RATNER:
that.

It is precisely that.

It is precisely

And we say that it is rhetorical hyperbole not because

we say so, but because under the teachings of Greenbe.lt v.
Bresler it must be so held as & matter of constitutional fac.-,
and that the lower court’s attempt, without any rationale what­
soever -- the district court, I mean — attempt without any
rationale whatsoever to say that Bresler is completely different
from this case is simply utterly untenable.

10
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll resume there after

lunch, Mr. Rafcner,

AFTERNOON SESSION
(1:00 p.m.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Mozart Ratner, you

may resume.
MR. RATNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I should like to refer to two other passages
Linn which have relevance, at least, here.

of

One is that the

labor board has concluded that epithets, such as “scab,” "un­
fair," and “liar," are commonplace in. these struggles — I
might add, as commonplace as the London definition —- and not
so indefensible as to remove them from the protection of Section
7, even though the statements are;erroneous and defame one of
the partiescf the dispute.

It's on pages 60 to 61, and I con­

tinue, having skipped a sentence, on page 61, to the following:
,!In some the Board tolerates intemperate, abusive and inaccurate
statements made by the union during attempts to organize em­
ployees, which is what this was.

It does not interpret the Act

as giving either party license to injure the other .intentionally
by circulating defamatory or insulting material known to be
false."
Q

It’s sort of a two-handed statement, isn't it?

11
MR. RAINER:

Your Honor, I -— to me, the only hand

that counts is the last four words, "known to be false,1' versus
the common law test, embodies the NEW YORK TIMES test, and lays
down the boundary of state court jurisdiction.

In order for

a statement to be known to be false, it must be factual, becat\se if it is not factual, as Judge Maris said in speaking for
the Fifth Circuit in Curtis Publishing Co. v„ Birdsong, which
we cite in our brief, then it’s simply not subject to the
litmus paper test of truth or falsity at all.

And if it's not

subject to the litmus paper test of truth or falsity then it
can't come within the scope of state court jurisdiction under
Linn.
Q

Apparently, I take it, what you're saying is

that opinions would fall on the one side of that line and
factual statements on the other.
MR. RATHER;

I’m inclined to believe they would, un­

less opinions were matters of fact, which, conceivably, they
might be.
Q

The might be facts, they might be —

MR. RATHER:

In other words, I might have an opinion

of your Honor, and state the contrary one falsely and malic­
iously, and that, I think, might be actual.

But hyperbole —

hyperbole certainly falls on the other side of the line.
that's the point I really want to make.

And

That if rhetorical

hyperbole, which is what the London statement is, is protected

12
constitution, and protected on the phrase that I read in Linn#
then the protection must be coextensive with the artist's ima­
gination# and certainly commensurate with the depth of the
sentiment or the emotion —- in this case# particularly# re­
vulsion against workers who refused to join their fellows in the
union — which the artist is seeking to express.
Actually, the images that are evoked by the London
literature are not too difficult to compare with the image in­
voiced — and whose favor who can. say — by those people who
called Bresler a blackmailer, which in Bresler, this Court held#
enjoyed constitutional protection.

And as the Chief Justice

said, speaking for this Court in Organisation For A Better
Austin v. Keefe, "As long as the means of circulating such
statements, and by such statements in that parenthetical ex­
pression, I mean extravagant, rhetorical hyperbole, are peace­
ful, the communication need not meet standards of acceptability.
Standards of acceptability for good hyperbole and bad hyperbole
there are none."
Q

And I suggest —

That, was a prior restraint case, wasn’t it?

MR. RATNER:

Yes, your Honor, as it happens, Austin

was a prior restraint case.
Q

But what is —

So that that comes right within the doctrine of

the Near — Near v. Minnesota.
MR. RATNER:

I understand that the general framework

of Austin was Near v. Minnesota and the prior restraint.

But

13

what is said there about the First Amendment , and about the
reasons for knocking down the rationale of the Illinois court
which said that what it was doing was protecting the privacy
of this businessman to conduct his business the way he chose
to v.o,j legally and as the lav/s of the state of Illinois gave
him the right to conduct it, and who chose and elected not to
sign the contract that this organization placed before him and
demanded that he sign.

.And the Supreme Court held that that

was an. invasion of his privacy, and it further held that the
leafleting was not protected because it was a means of coercing
him to change his business practices, rather than as a means
of communieating ideas.

The striking down of those arguments

was a matter of the philosophy of the First Amendment, not
Wear v, Minnesota and prior restraint.
Now, in one place we distinguish this case most
seriously from the case that preceeded it.

Workmen drawn to­

gether in a common occupation fay a common employer work toge­
ther whether they like it or not — they8 re in a common commu­
nity.

And the choice to band themselves together as a union

and to become" members of the same organization and participate
in its affairs and to contribute to its upkeep and to abide by
its rules and by its laws is a voluntary choice that each of
them must make in the society in which we live.
liberty from

I take the

of quoting from this Court's decision in Time

v. Hill, 385 U.S. at 38;
varying degrees —

"Exposure of the self to others in

14
is a concomitant of life in a civilized community.

The risk of

this exposure is an essential incident of life in a society
which places a primary value on freedom of speech and of press„
And so, every letter carrier exposes himself to the
good or ill will of his fellows — those who are union members
and those idio are not — and when he makes the decision, and
when he make? the choice, to join them in their union or not,
he, by the same token, makes a choice of securing their social
good v;ill or thier social ill will.
Our opponents, indeed, concede that the union has a
right to publish the fact of their "scabness" •— that they are
"scabs," ar#.d, by publishing it, to seek to induce other letter
carriers to exert social pressure upon them to join the union.
They say, but they don"t have the right to do it by extrava­
gant hyperbole.

We say they do, because the First Amendment

protects extravagant hyperbole if it protects the right to
speak about common interests at all.

Co- — hyperbole, how­

ever extravagant, is not obscenity.
What is relevant to this case is that the right to
publish honestly held views or opinions, in classic or artistic
or hyperbolic form, is protected where the publication particu­
lar goes to a special audience, which has a special interest
in the subject matter, as t?ais union monthly newsletter went
only to the members of the union who were intimately concerned
with the union status of each of the nonmembers, because it af-

15

fected their pocketbooks immediately, for one thing.
Q

May I inquire what the circulation of the monthly

newsletter was?
MR. RATHER:

525, 420 of whom are active members of

the Letter Carriers, the balance being retired letter carriers.
Q

And it’s your position that this is a news media

entitled to the same principles that protect the MEW YORK TIMES?
MR. RATHER:
Q

Absolutely.

Right.

MR. RATHER:

Precisely as if this ware a chemical

society, whose members v?ere all chemists, and whose publication
was devoted exclusively to the interests of chemists, it would
have no less protection than the MEW YORK TIMES.
Q

Is there any limit on this?

I live in an apart­

ment here in Washington that publishes monthly a little mimeo­
graphed. sheet — sometimes it53 a page, sometimes it’s a couole
of pages — news about our apartment.

Would that be the equi­

valent of the news media, for constitutional purposes?
MR. RATHER:

I see no reason why the NEW YORK TIMES

rule should not apply to the publisher of that publication.
Q

Would you —

MR. RATHER:

Hone whatsoever, assuming the.postulate

you put in your question ■—
Q

Thank you

MR. RATHER;

— that the matter is limited to matters

16
of common and proper interest to the residents of the apartment,
IJm not saying that everything that the —■ each resident of the
apartment may do in his own privacy of his home is a matter of
legitimate interest to his neighbors.

Bat if what he does

affects, by the doing of it, the lives of those around him—
if he doesn’t take his garbage and drop it in the appropriate
garbage disposal place, but leaves it outside for somebody else
to do or stink up the hall —*■ I am sure that this is a matter
about which the publication might legitimately take note.
Q

Assume there was no publication whatever, and the

manager of the apartment falsely accused a tenant of misconduct.
Would that be subject to the same protection, as the principle
enunciated the NEW YORK TIMES gives people in the press?
MR. RATNERs

I see nothing in the rationale of the

NEW YORK TIMES dr of the First Amendment that warrants its ex­
tension to that case.
Q

In other words, you draw the line between media,

as broadly defined by you, on the one hand, and what an indivi­
dual may say in his individual capacity?
MR. RATNER:

I think that freedom Of speech and free­

dom of the press have a quite different meaning when they are
involved in matters of concern to more than the' two disputants
or the two individuals who may be considering something, yes.
Q

Well, suppose the — suppose the slander were

uttered in a stump speech on the corner of a public .street.

17
Would the speaker have the same protection as the news media?
MR. RATNER:

It depends on what he's talking about

and what the interest of his audience is.

If there is both a

common interest in the subject matter, and the relevancy to
that subject matter and art interest of the speaker in that sub­
ject matter, and that the subject of which the spe- — to which
the speech is addressed, has somehow been involved, willingly
or unwillingly, but necessarily involved under the Hill theory
and the controversy the speaker on the stump knows of — is en­
titled to no less protection than the publish —
Let's not speak of the publisher of the NEW YORK
TIMES, if your Honor please.
analogy.

I think that that's the wrong

Let's talk about the man who rises at City Hall

meetings and calls Bresler a blackmailer.

He is the person

whose constitutional rights, on the First Amendment issue, are
the equivalent of your public speaker on the stump.

We have

a different case here 'cause we have a. labor dispute and we
have Linn, and wa have federal preemption, and so on, so this
is an easier case.
But the case that you out must be measured, it seems
to me, in terras of the outraged citizen of Greenbelt who thinks
that black — that Bresler's tactics are blackmail.
Mow, I want to turn the few moments that are left
to what the Supreme Court of Virginia did with this case.

The

first thing it did with this case was to throw Linn out of the

window on the ground that it had a. new theory.

18
You couldn’t

have a violation of Virginia’s statute for insulting words unless
you also came up with common lav; malice.

Well, the answer is

that common law malice has nothing whatsoever to do with Linn;
that was reversed in favor of the NEW YORK TIMES rule which was
adopted by analogy.
Secondly, the court got rid —
I'd rather reserve the balance of my time.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Ratnar.

Mr. Kapral?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. KAPRAL, ESQ.f
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. KAPRAL;

Chief Justice Burger and members of the

honorable Court;
I would like to distinguish a few matters concerning
the factual situation.
It must be kept in mind that all three of the appel­
lees involved here have been employed in the Richmond postal
service for 14, 13 and 12 years, respectivley.

During this

time, they elected not to become affiliated with the union, a
right that they certainly had under EXECUTIVE Order 11491 and
the Virginia "Right to Work Law."
Well, on two occasions preceeding the libelous publi­
cation in question, the name of Mr. Austin was printed in the

19
local branch newsletter under the heading of, "A List of Scabs.*
At the time, the actual so-called Jack London definition was
not in there -— just the names under a list of scabs.

Mr.

Austin didn't like this at all, and he, first of all, went to
the Richmond Post Of-

the Postmaster of the Richmond Post

Office, stating that he thought that management should be ad­
vised that coercive tactics were being used on persons trying
to get them to join the union.
Nothing was done, so he then went to the local union
president of the local union.

At that time, he received the

response that there is nothing the local union, could do about
it — absolutely nothing.

This was a tool used by the union

to attempt to get persons to join the union, and the only thing
that he could do would be to join the union.
Now, at this time, I would make it perfectly clear
that the calling of the appellees “scabs" is not the subject
of the suit involved here, but rather, what we are concerned
with is the fact that these three gentlemen were held up to
ridicule with their fellow employees by attributing to each
one of them lack of character, rotten principles, and being
traitors to God, country, family and class.
Now, the union would contend that, certainly, this
was mere hyperbole — that no one would take the same seriously.
But the fact, remains that at the trial, Secretary Angelo Par­
ker of the union, testified that he felt the appellees' prin-

20
ciples should be questioned.
principles.

In fact, he felt they had rotten

The president of the local union testified that

this was dona for one reason and one reason alone — so that
fellow employees would atop associating with these three per­
sons .
I think an interesting point in clarifying the situ­
ation that we are dealing with here today as being one of first
instance, was brought forth by Mr. Kenneth Fiester, president
of the International Labor Press Association, where, on the
witness stand, he testified that he has been involved in the
labor movement for some 30 years, and that during this 30 years
he has seen this article printed numerous times; in fact, so
many numerous times that he could even begin to try to count
how many time's .
Yet, under cross-examination, he admitted that in the
entire 30-same year period he had never actually seen this ar­
ticle appear, listing certain persons names, named as indivi­
duals as here.
All three of the appellees stated that they had all
experienced for a vary, vary long time a good relationship with
fellow workers, and up until the time that tills article appeared
What we have here, I feel the main problem

involved

here is whether what was done — what was printed — this pub­
lication — of and concerning the appellees, whether this falls
within the doctrine of NEW YORK TIMES v, Sullivan.

Of. course,

we propose at this time that it does not.

It does not.

This

Court , in Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, extended the knowing
falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity rule to in­
clude public figures.
In 1970, this honorable Court, in the Roseabloom
case, extended this rule to include a privata individual where
the statements involved, an issue of involvement and they were
a matter of general or public concern.
Nov;, at this time, I must say, it is hard to imagine
where any public concern or public issue could be involved
here.

Well pa- —
Q

Is there a statutory question in this case at

all, under the Labor Relations law?
MR. KAPRAL:

A preemption question, your Honor?

Yes.

MR. KAPRAL:

Well, there is a valid question.

There

has been a question —
Q

Well, don’t you should deal with that first, be­

MR. KAPRAL:

Well, yes, your Honor, I am prepared

to deal with it.
Q

Isn’t that Linn?

MR. KAPRAL:

Isn’t that Linn and —

That’s Linn v. Plant Guard Workers —-

that’s correct.
Q

How do you — I don’t suppose we reached the

22

constitutional question, or Metromedia, or all those cases, if
Linn controls this case,

MR. KAPRAL:

the National Labor Relations Act, and to — in the libel — suit for libel involving a labor dispute.

Of course, I, at

this time, say that there's —

And there was in — if the Linn testifies this

MR. KAPRAL:

In some respects it was.

I feel that in

Well, in some respects it was inconsistent?

MR. KAPRAL:

The Court, your Honor, the Court stated

in Linn that in matters of merely peripheral concern, such as
the facts of the case indicate here, that in a situation like
that, the states had jurisdiction.

Does it mean "compar­

Q

Well, anyway, what is your position with respect

to the applicability of Linn, whatever Linn means?
MR, KAPRAL:

My position, your Honor, is that in the

Linn case, the court — the Supreme Court of Virginia stated
that the Linn case, that the states were not — of course, this
Court stated — excuse me —■ that the states are not preempted
by the National Labor Relations Act —

Well, I know, but why is that?

Is this a labor

MR. KAPRAL:

I wouldn't go — to say it's not a labor

I'd say the fact that three individuals chose a

private right not to join the union — a right that they had,
is certainly not, and I don't see where it's a labor dispute.
There's no question of wages and hours involved, no question
of working conditions, no picketing

Welly if, I suppose, it's arguably an unfair laboi

practice to coerce employees to join a labor union, isn’t it?
MR. KAPRAL:

Well, isn't that as plain 8(d)3?

MR. KAPRAL:

If you would term hyperbolic, as they

therefore, it didn't come under that.

Well, now, but you say it's more than that.

whether -Q

Well, you can't have it both ways, and neither

can they.
MR. SAP HAL s

I .realise that.

Well, what i3 your position, then, as to why Linn

doesn’t apply?

It must be that you — if you're wrong that it's

not a labor dispute, is that what the applicability ef Linn turns
on?

MR. KAPRAL:

Well, is the explanation you've just given us

about Linn the one that the Virginia court adopted?

Or did

they say Linn wasn't applicable because there's malice here?
MR. KAPRAL:

I believe, your Honor, that was the ~-

their holding ■— there was actual malice here.

And you're not trying to explain Linn away on

Now —
That would be a position,

then, if you are wrong on the issue of labor dispute, and Linn
does apply, then your alternative ground is taken by the Vir­
ginia court, namely that Linn was satisfied.
MR. KAPRAL:

Yes, and malice was shown.

26
Q

Do you. contend at all, Mr. Kapral, that under the

fact situation which Linn arose, being a labor management dis-*
puts, anything that the Linn case said as to the — any broader
sweep of the preemption would be dicta, and be open to reexami­
nation?
MR» KAPRAL:

Well, your Honor, of course, the Linn

case was more of a classic example of a labor dispute ~~ there
was labor and management being involved.

And not only that,

Mr. Linn, of course, was the head of a large national detective
agency.

I think he fell into the question of a public figure

certainly more than the three appellees do in our case.
Your Honor, of course, the union had a privilege — a
qualified privilege —* the .right to let fellow members be ad­
vised that these three persons were not members of the union.
Nobody doubts that fact.

But it could have been done in a much

more diplomatic way —- a way to inform and not to injure.
Q

You don't have to go so far as to say that they

must do it in a diplomatic way, do you?
MR. KAPRAL:
Q

Well, maybe not diplomatic, but —

All you have to do is say it in a rionlibelous —■

MR. KAPRAL:

In a nonlibelous way.

What they would

say, Chief Justice Burger, is that what you cannot do directly
you can do indirectly.

In other words, by couching expressions

and barns in hyperbolic fashion you can escape the conscription
of libel.

This is what they’re saying.

And I say, of course,

21

this is not right.
In using this article, of course, and die word, and
for the purpose that the union used it,

it abuses

the quali­

fied privilege that was given to them — the privilege to let
the union members know that -- who were not union members, and
therefore, they are — the union is liable to the appellees for
doing so.
Aside from being an effort,cf course, of the union
to compel appellees to join the union, no labor dispute was
involved.

Everybody in the Richmond Post Office except a hand­

ful of carriers, at the Richmond Post Office, were already
members of the union.

There is no violence here anyplace

shown, no picketing, no publicity

in what way, possibly,

could the public have any interest in whether or not these
three individuals use their right to join the union or not?
Exercise that right?
I feel that this case can be —- again, can be dis­
tinguished from the Rosenblootn case inasmuch as in that case,
of course, it was a circulation intended to reach the general
public.

Here we're just attempting to reach a specific group,

namely, the union members.

And in that case, of course, we

had criminal conduct involved, we had obscenity involved.
Certainly these are factors that the general public would be
interested in.

No doubt about it.

But, I say in this case,

absolutely no way that I ---- possibly a person could say, with-

28

out stretching Rosenhloom way out of proportion, that these
persons came under the realm of Rosenblaom.
Of course, now, the appellants listed the Jack London
article that was introduced into evidence -- nowhere does this
Jack London article name appellees.

Under the article it's

printed, but nowhere underneath it is anyone's name listed.
And, an I said earlier, this was brought out at the trial, that
never, in a 30-same year following of the labor movement in
this country, had thfe person ever seen this before.
The main reason we propose at this time that this
article was written, for one reason alone, to exert pressure
on these individuals to join the union and to exert so fellow
workers would ostracize them, and no longer associate with these
persons.
We get into the question of whether freedom of speech
and the press permits a publication of this type o£ libelous
article.

In the case of Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, this

Court stated, and I quote, "that it is well understood that the
right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all
circumstances.

There are certain, well-defined and narrowly-

limited classes of speech the prevention and punishment of which
have never been thought to raise any constitutional problem.'5
Now, of course, no violence wa3 present in this case,
very true, but Mr. Austin, one of the appellants stated that
on one occasion he was confronted by the union steward, and that

29

he was able fco restrain himself from committing an assault upon
this person, and that the article, on many occasions, provoked
him to the point where he considered committing assault on
persons.
Gentlemen, I thank you, and at this time ray colleague,
Mr. Cherry, will continue the argument.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Cherry?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PARKER E. CHERRY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. CHERRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court

please:
This Court, in the Linn case, afforded workers a
measure of protection against malicious libel causing them
harm.

When the workers were given that measure of protection,

the NEW YORK TIMES rule had already been promulgated and was
held not constitutionally applicable.

Today, we are viewing

the measure of protection afforded nonunion workers in the
light of the progeny of NEW YORK TIMES, that is, Curtis Pub­
lishing Co.„ and Rosenbloom v. Metromedia.
The majority opinion in Rosenbloom left open to
future determination the extent of a private person's involve­
ment in matters of public interest.
his dissent in Rosenbloom,

Mr. Justice Marshall, in

with which Mr. Justice Stewart

and Mr. Justice Harlan concurred, pointed out that two essen­
tial and fundamental values conflict.

That is, the right of

30
3X1

Ofc sours and anonymous person for protection from unjustified

insult and wrongful hurt, which he states reflects no more than
our basic concept of the essential dignity and worth of every
human being.
On the other hand, the concept of a citizen informed
by a free and unfettered press.
With this conflict of fundamental rights, it is ne­
cessary for the Court to determine which of the fundamental
rights is the more compelling and paramount.

This conflict

must be viewed and resolved in the light of the particular
circumstances under which the conflict arose.

In considering

the rights of a private and anonymous citizen giving way by
reason of his being involved in a matter of general public in­
terest, the right of the public to be informed by free and un­
fettered press, I make the point that there .is a basic difference
between a labor union and the public media.

And particularly

so in the relationship between a labor union and a nonunion
worker in a plant or organisation in which union is bargaining
agent.
lic

Union, first, is not concerned with informing the pub­
the general public, but is concerned with promoting its

own particular interests, which interests are in direct conflict
with the interests of a nonunion worker.
The union newsletter, which has just been mentioned,
was circulated only to union members, and not to the general
public.

On the other hand, the media's only interest is in-

31

forming the public on a matter which is of general or public
interest.

It is without bias in the matter.

And this is not

true in the case of union.
When we consider, with this background,, the right of
the individual nonunion worker under the circumstances here
of merely failing, or refusing to join union as against the
right of the general public to know, even if this could be considered a matter of general, public interest, the compelling
and paramount interest, we assert, is clearly that of the non­
union worker.

If union had this right, it would have within

its power, by publishing in its little newsletter, to make
any tiling a matter of public interest.

The man that has the

bias — the organisation that has the bias — 'would have the
right of making it a matter of public interest.
Now, this matter, that we're talking about here,
had never been in the press, it had never been discussed anywhere — it was strictly between union and these particular
nonunion workers.

Under the protection of the NEW YORK TIMES

rule, a standard most difficult and almost impossible of proof
by the aggrieved person, union would be able to harass and
coerce nonunion workers.

The rights of nonunion workers not to

join union, under various state right to work jaws, and in the
instant case,under the EXECUTIVE Order as well, would be largely
nullified.

Now, the EXECUTIVE Order does say specifically

that the union cannot — has no right to coerce nonunion mem-

.32

bers into joining.
So that when Mr. Austin went to the Postmaster Gen­
eral, and went to the president of that union, to complain, he
was we11 within his rights to say, "They are attempting to co­
erce me.",

tod they, themselves, as I took it from what Mr.

Ratner said here today, for practical purpose, admits they were
attempting to coerce them.

At least the tactics, as I construe

them, would mean that.
In the case before us, the president of the union
admitted that this publication was one of the tools used by
union to compel nonunion members to join.

Unions are, today,

wealthy, monolithic organizations with almost unlimited re­
sources as opposed to a few nonunion workers in a particular
plant. Armed with virtual immunity under NEW YORK TIMES rule,
union would have within its power the means, if it so chose,
and as it did here.
Q

Didn't this violate the Labor Act?

MR. CHERRY:

Yes, sir, it violates that ■— it violates

the
Q

It does violate the —

MR; CHERRY:

It does violate that.

But the right to

the union in here is under the EXECUTIVE Order.

Now, that’s

what the Supreme Court of Virginia says ~~ that it was under
that that they’re permitted to —
Q

But you admit that it was a violation of the

33

National Labor Relations Act?
MR. CHERRY:

Yes, sir.

1 don't think — I think,

yes, I think I would have to say -that they have no

right to -~

the National Labor Relations Act says they have no

right to

coerce.

But, again, that is on the peripheric concern, of the

National Labor Relations Act.
Q

Well, would the National Labor Relations Board,

have had a jurisdiction over a labor-management dispute between
the raa.il carriers and the head of the postal corporation?
MR. CHERRY:
Q

I do not believe so, no, sir.

Well, haven't -— have they exercised any juris­

diction over the
MR. CHERRY:

No exercise — no jurisdiction was ever

exercised.
Q

I took your answer to mean that —

MR. CHERRY:
Q

None that I —

— if this was the case, within the National

Labor Relations Act, the conduct constituted coercion that is
forbidden by that Act —
MR. CHERRY:
Q

That’s right —

— in relation, to the constituents covered by

it.
MR. CHERRY:

That's right.

But not within it in the

form that we're dealing with matters between the employer and
the union and whatnot.

34

Q

Well, the Virginia Supreme Court said the effect

of EXECUTIVE Order 11491, which is essentially equivalent in
both content and purpose to the National Labor Relations Act»
MR, CHERRY:
Q

Yes, sir,

Now, if it’s essentially equivalent, there must

be some authority that adjudicates what’s called unfair prac­
tices .
MR. CHERRY:

Well, the EXECUTIVE Order does say that

they shall not coerce workers.
Q

All right.

MR. CHERRY:

Now who adjudicates that?

I believe the — because there is in there

provision that the Postmaster General in the area has the ob­
ligation of seeing that that is enforced.
Q

But Linn is a preemption case, and it’s a non­

preemption case —
MR. CHERRY:
Q

Yes, sir.

— than if this EXECUTIVE Order referred to has

no preemptive effect whatsoever, why, Linn i3 beside the point?
then you do reach the constitutional issue right away.
MR. CHERRY:
0

Yes, sir, I think so.

Well, what do you say?

MR. CHERRY:

I say that •— you mean as to the NEW

YORK TIMES rule?
Q

As to preemption or not of —

MR. CHERRY:

I think that it had not preempted the

35

stata jurisdiction in this case — the state had jurisdiction.
Q

Well, I understood your other —

Q

— the answer to ray question —

Q

Well, what is the answer?

MR. CHERRY:
Q

I did not so —

We see --

MR. CHERRY:

In the case — Wow, we do not oelieve

that the publication concerning appellees was a matter of pub­
lic or general interest, for whether appellees join union or
not could hardly be said to be of any interest or concern to
the public generally.
The majority opinion in Rosenbloom expressly
Q

--

Mr. Cherry, would you say the same thing about

the American Medical Association Journal, as not being of any
public interest to the public generally?
MR. CHERRY:

Or the ABA Journal?

I think they are probably couched in

such terms that they are of interest to a limited audience,
there, and I think, perhaps, if you got into the medical jour­
nal itself which would deal with highly complex medical terns,
would not be of general interest to the public, but would be of
interest to medical

members of that profession.

Now, as I stated, the majority opinion in Rosenbloom
expressly leaves open to future determination the constitutional
standard to be applied, if any, in the enforcement of state
libel lav/s published by news media about a person's activities

36

not within the public or general concern»

Since it is indica­

ted that some areas of a person’s activity are outside the area
of general or public concern, we urge that a nonunion member's
decision not to join union is outside that area.

Nor should the

union be afforded the same protection as is accorded news media,
for it.id, in effect, arming the union with a club: to deal with
any recalcitrant worker who desires to exercise his right not
to join.

i
The overriding and paramount interest "here .is pro­

tection for the individual worker.
It has been said by union that Linn itself defied
application of MEW .YORK TIMES rule.

However, there is no con­

stitutional compulsion to use the NEW YORK TIMES standard.
Linn decided one. issue, and. one issue only, and it is -Q

Excuse me, Mr. Cherry.

I notice in Appendix D of
page
the jurisdictional statement is EXECUTIVE Order 11491 on/17a
then
that provides for a federal labor relations counsel, and/pro­
vides that the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor Manage­
ment Relations shall, except as provided in Section 19(d) of
this Order, decide complaints of alleged unfair 'labor practices.,
and alleged violations of the standards of conduct for labor
organisations; and 19(d) apparently has reference to — that
exception covers grievance procedures and so forth, in lieu of.
So, apparently, the EXECUTIVE Order does set up a
mechanism for the determination of complaints of alleged unfair

37

practices, comparable to —■
MR, CHERRY:
Q

The National Labor Relations —

— the National Labor Relations Board does,

doesn't it?
MR, CHERRY:
Q

Have you ever heard this being used?

MR. CHERRY:
Q

Perhaps, perhaps so, yes.

No, sir, I haven't.

I have not.

Well, if you say that — what you are saying is

that the union tried to coerce these people to be members —
MR. CHERRY:
Q

That’s right.

3(b}3 — no, 8(b)l — "to interfere with, re-

strain or coerce an employee in the exercise of his rights
assurred by this Order."

Now, one of his rights is to be or

not to be a member of a labor organization.
MR. CHERRY:
0.

That's correct, yes, sir.

Well, wouldn’t you think this — at least argu­

ably, then, that what the union was doing here — you say it
was coercing them to be a member — at least arguably it was
an unfair labor practice, under this EXECUTIVE Order.
MR. CHERRY:

Yes, but in the periphery of concern;

they are not in the direct concern.
Q

Well, I am -- that ma.y be so, but Linn takes

hold, I would suppose, when, arguably, something is an unfair
practice within the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB or some
comparable agency

38
MR. CHERRY:
with preemption.

Yes, Limi does , sir; we do deal in Linn

I have to say that Linn deals with the first

thing that you tell them.
Q

Now, you say it would not seem to be

MR. CHERRY:

It was not preempted.

Yes, ar, I already

said that.
Now, one final point here, that in Linn and in readinc
Linn, because there is a lot of language in Linn there, some as
quoted by my opponent here, in that opinion, and, actually, and
I’ll look to the dissenting opinion to see what they said it
meant —■ and they said that what the majority meant was a male­
volent desire to injure, which is not. the NEW YORK TIMES Rule.
They defined it as, here, sir, they've defined it as a malevo­
lent desire to injure? and that's not the NEW YORK TIMES stan­
dard there.

So I take it •— and they did use, in the majority

opinion, they did use that language also — so I take it that
that was —
I thank you.

At the time this case arose, labor-management

relations between this management and this union were governed
under the EXECUTIVE Order referred to, which had the enforce-

labor organisations to the Assistant Secretary pf- Labor about
coercion of employees to join unions.
Q

They were —- were they based on, say, 8 (b) 1?

MR. RATNER:

Yes, they were based on exactly the pro­

visions of the EXECUTIVE Order which incorporate almost in haec

But it’s by virtue of the EXECUTIVE Order that —

By virtue of the EXECUTIVE Order, if that
And the court below held that the EXECU­

However, the situation that

the courts below conceded was identical, for preemption pur­
poses, before, unless we want to forget what preemption is all
about, which is avoidance of unseemly conflict between federal
and state authority.
I want to say that my colleague, Mr. Kapral, keeps
confusing in his brief taking a statement literally with taking
a statement seriously.

Of course, the hyperbole was intended

to be taken seriously.

Our point is that it was not, and could

not have been, because it was not written to be, and was not
published to be taken literally.

It was an expression of emo­

tion and a concept of feeling.

What's your

About —
MR. RATNER:

That the Linn standard was satisfied?

Well, of course they're completely wrong, because the Linn
standard was not satisfied.

The Linn standard is NEW YORK

They're completely wrong

about that, and they're completely wrong about another thing.

Well, now, wait a minute.

Don't rush so fast.

erroneously, that common law malice satisfied the Linn standard—

Is that it?

MR. RATHER:

They are wrong exactly the same way and

for exactly the same reason in another respect

when they

they said, we now come within the scope of whatfe constitution­
ally immune — that is, constitutionally not protected — when
we say that if these .words are spoken with common Iciw malice

disappears.

They’re just flat wrong.

I

think this bears on what you've just said, and maybe you've
answered it, but I didn't quite sense that you did.

If this is a labor dispute, and
