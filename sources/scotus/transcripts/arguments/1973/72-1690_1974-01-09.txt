P R O C E E D !_ H G S
We will hear arguments first this morning in
No. 72-1690, Spence against Washington.
Mr, GreenfieId.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GREENFIELD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GREENFIELD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think to give some perspective to the question
before the Court this morning, I will relate a piece of
history that I learned .just in the last week involving
President Lincoln8s favorite clown.

It was discussed in an

article that appeared in the New York Times Magasine of
December 30th„
The clown in question was named Dan Rice, and he
dressed himself up in an outfit, that was designed to look
■

■

think in the tradition of people like Mr. Goguen, whose case
was argued only recently before this Court.
Mr. Rico called himself Uncle Sam, and the image
which he conveyed has remained .with us in various forms, and
1 think it is fair to any that Uncle Sam has been in cartoons
and at the head of parades, a violator repeatedly of the kind
of statute which is before the Court this morning.
This case comes here on appeal from the Supreme

4
Court of Washington *

And my client, Harold Spence, was

convicted for flying a privately owned American flag with a
black tape peace symbol superimposed on it from the window

of

his apartment in Seattle, Washington.
Q

Before you proceed, who was Mr. Rice?

MR. GREENFIELD;

Mr. Rice was the clown who, at

least according to the New York Times, was President
Lincoln's favorite.
Q

He is not a party [laughter].

MR. GREENFIELD;
Your Honor.

lie is not a party to the facts,

I believe his reign extended in the mid-nineteenth

century.
Q

Ha is not your client.

MR. GREENFIELD:
Q.

No, he is not.

Did I see somewhere in the record that the

flag was also upside down?
MR. GREENFIELD:

I'm not sure whether that appears

in the .record, Mr. Justice Blackmun, but in fact it was
suspended upside down.

That does not constitute a violation

of the statute here at issue.

As I understand it, an upside

down flag is traditionally a symbol of distress, and I think
it was consistent with the message which Hr. Spence was
attempting to convey.

However, he was not convicted as a

result of the position of the flag but merely because there
was something superimposed on the flag.

That something could

5
have been under the broadly worded statute of our state words
such as “I love America."

The content would not have been of

consequence.
This case does not have any of the complicating
features that some of the recant political protest cases have
had that have been before this Court.

It does not involve,

as the Tinker case did, the black arm bands that were worn
in a school room.

The location was a cause of some concern.

Unlike the Papish case, the political cartoon that was
published on a college campus, it does not involve any
question of the right of college campuses or the state to
regulate activity on college campuses.

It does not involve

any trespass on public or private property or any destruction
of property or government records, as was the ease in
United States v. O’Brien.
The only factor which makes this case at all
complicated or indeed at all interesting is that it involved
an American flag.

And as to whether or not that makes the

case difficult, I would remind the Court of the observation of
Mr. Justice Jackson in Watt Virginia ?, Barnette; that is,
that the underlying principles arising out of the First
Ante; drrenfc are simple ones.

And the only problem in a case

1:' k ~ this is going beyond .the emotional preconceptions that
we have when our flag is involved and getting to those
fundamental and basically simple principles.

6
Basically there are two ' 'kinds of statutes that are
currently the subject of a great deal of litigatio;! throughout
the country, criminal statutes, promulgated by the states and
referring to flags.

There are the desecration statutes, 'the

kind of statute that was at issue in the Goguen case, which
punishes behavior which reflects some kind of contempt or
intentional desecration of the flag, either by words or by some,
other form of conduct.

That kind of statute is not at isss

here today.
The Washington statute# under which Mr. Spance was
prosecuted, deals with what is referred to in the title as
improper use of the flag.

And I should start by saying that

"flag" is defined very broadly in this statute.
A flag—Ibolieve the definition says flag et cetera
defined--refers to any flag, emblem, shield# or color of the
United States or of the State of Washington or any picture or
representation of the flag of any substance# that is# of metal
or stone.
The buttons which have flags on them and have the
i

face of a political candidate are equally punishable under
Washington's statute# as was# according to the Supreme Court
of Washington# the conduct engaged in by Mr. Spence.

And

once again—

Q

X think the state flag bears no resemblance to

the American flag.

MR, GREEIIPII/:!);

Right.

The statute applies both to

the state flag and the flag of the United States, and I do not
know of any case

in which the state flag has been at issue.

I do not know whether the average citizen of the State of
Washington could recognize or describe the flag of the State
of Washington if asked.
0

They probably do not own. one, 1 would guess.

MR. GREENFIELD:
Q

Pardon?

At any rate, they probably do not own one, the

average citizen.
MR. GREENFIELD:

I certainly assume that that is

true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

I think that if the average

citizen of Washington were asked whether the flag of our
state is a green flag with the face of the first president
on it or a picture of Mount Rainier or a pine tree, that the
distribution of answers would probably fee approximately equal.
q

In any event, however vague or perhaps however

broad the definition of .flag may be in 9.86.01$, in this case
this was a flag without question? there is no controversy over
that.

This was not an emblem or standard or ensign or

shield or copy or picture or representation! it was a flag,
was it not?
MR. GREENFIELD:

Right.

I do not believe there is

any question that this was a flag? whether or not there was
a violation of the statute depends on some other things

8
which are in fact much more complicated because judges,,
including Judge Lombard in the Second Circuit# in Long Island
Moratorium Coamitfee

Cahnr perhaps the most detailed

explication of a statute of this sort in a case that

is

pending before this Court-*-that is , the jurisdictional
statement was filed several years ago--suggested that one

-

could not road a statute of this sort literally because the
results are too bizarre» • And consequently

we get into

something which I think it is fair to characterise as
symbolic speech as distinguished from literal

speech in a

statute, which presents serious problems»
The kinds of examples which Chief Judge Lumbard
gave of what seemed to him to be obvious violations of the
Mew York statute,

which is very similar to the Washington

statute, were such things, as the buttons which every
presidential candidate in recent history, including several
chief justices of this Court, have displayed—that is,
pictures of the American flag or part of it, with their faces
superimposed»
It would go t© the various magazine covers that
have—-almost every magazine of national circulation in the
last few years has had one or another, with a flag a part
of if and the title of the magazine and various stories
superimposed»
■Many examples of these kinds of seemingly patent

...

9
violations of statutes of this sort occur in the
the brief filed

to

with this Court, the reply brief for

appellant in Radich y. NewJ^ork.

That is No® 169, October

term, 1970«
1 think, though, that we all have some familiarity
with these kinds of things,

I noticed on the plane, flying

east, United Airlines distributed to me a brochure advertising
a telephone,

X will leave a copy of this with the Clerk, if

anyone would like to see it, a patent violation of the statute*
The breadth of the statute—
Q

The statute says improper use.

MR, GREENFIELDs

Mr. Justice Marshall, the statute

prohibits the placing of any mark or word or sign or
decoration or design on a flag as defined in the statute.
Q

It did not hay® the word improper?

MR. GREENFIELDt

No.

The title is “Improper Use,"

but there is no rule for interpretation that a court could
pick up on a word such as "improper.51
The argument that the state makes is that because
there is no distinction made between what we would, as a
matter of common sense, perhaps think of improper use,
disrespectful use or some other, that the statute is therefore
neutral and poses no threat to First Amendment activity.
this kind of neutrality is nonetheless—if it is in fact
neutrality—a neutrality which imposes a burden on First

But

10

Amendment rights.

If we cut out the tongue© of all adult

citizens, this may foe neutral relative to their political
persuasion, but nonetheless it inhibits their ability to
engage in First Amendment protected activity»
Q

What about the copyright statute in which the

Gc» ornreDat prohibits the use of copyrighted works?
rhao certinly impairs soma people's First
does it not?

Amendment activities -

Supposing you client had wanted to get up•and

perform one of George M. Cohan's flag songs and it was
copyrighted.

The statute would say, I would take it, he

could not make a public performance of that.

Do you think

there are First Amendment implications to that?
MR. GREENFIELD:

I think that if a statute were

to, for example, prohibit criticism of one of these works,
that there would clearly be First Amendment implications.

I

If

owned a copy of a book that was copyrighted and I mads some

mirto in the margin that•were critical and that were viewed
as prohibited by the copyright laws, '1 think that would hold
serious First Amendment problems.
Of course, the purpose of copyright protection is
extremely different than the purposes that both the Supreme
Court and the state tender as justification for this kind of
statute.
Q

I gather the state is saying, "We want to

protect the integrity of the flag or whatever you want to call

11
it.

We do not want people changing it, in effect.”
So, certainly your client would have a legitimate

claim, I would think, under your argument to say, “I thought
it particularly apt from ray kind of protest to perform a
George M« Cohan song .to a meeting, and yet the copyright lav?
prohibited me from doing so."
MR. GREENFIELDs

It is interesting that the state

does not make the argument that the purpose of the statute is
to promote respect for the flag.

The state concedes—I think

that it is at page 12 of their brief-—that if the statute were
designed to promote respect for the flag, to require citizens
to give this evidence of their respect for what the flag
symbolizes* that that wo-Id be directly contrary to the
holdings in this Court in such cases as Street v. Hew York,
and I do not know whether they cite it* but additionally
'S'est Virginia v. Barnette.
The state argues, and I think fch© sole argument
r’hich they make here is, that the purpose of this flag is to
prevent breaches of the peace.
Q

Supposing they say, "We are not insisting on

any sort of affirmative respect at all.
v. Barnette is outmoded.

So, West Virginia

All we are saying Is that you

shall not fcatper with the physical integrity of a flag.”
MR. GREENFIELD:
way,that is—

If the flag can be treated that

12
Q

How about

burning the flag as a protest?

Your

irgument would reach that, I suppose»
MR» GREENFIELD?

I think that burning the flag poses

a substantial"-”
Q

Or cutting it up»

MR. GREENFIELD;

I think that either of those cases--

cutting it up I think is closer to this case»

Let me take

them one at a time.
Cutting it up is actually what was dona by the
President of the United States when he campaigned by use of
a button with his image superimposed.

That is, there was not

a tearing, but the statute reaches metal as well as other
kinds of flags.
Q

What you are suggesting is that because the

president did this, this statute is constitutional5 is that
your argument?

It seams to be.

MR. GREENFIELD;

Your Honor, wat Chief Judge Lumbard

argued—
Q
up the flag?

Just answer the question.

How about cutting

May the state prevent that or not?

MR. GREENFIELDs

In ray opinion, it would be no.

That is, I think in order to answer that question, we have
to consider what interest the state might have in preventing
a cutting of the flag.

If we find—and there is no dispute on

this record—that the appellant was engaged in an attempt to

13
convey & political massage, assuming that that is the kind of
situation we have, which 1 think is the simplest case but not
i would say, the only ease in which the activity is protected,
then we have to determine what is the state's interest in
preventing a physical alteration or tearing of the flag.
Q

You say it is not sufficient to override any­

body's desire to deliver a political message through dis­
membering the flag?
MR. GREENFIELD?

Your Honor, X say that I do not

know what the state's interest might be.

If the interest is

that which the state her® urges, that is, to prevent breaches
of the peace, then 1 think it is simply implausible—that is,
the average violation of one of these statutes, and they are
pervasive in our society, simply does not spur the average
citizen to violent retaliation.

And I think that that is

really the position that the state is pushed to in order to
defend the position that it has taken here.
Q

Where do we get support for the conclusion that

that conduct does not disturb the average citizen to violent
reaction?

That is your argument, not—
MR. GREENFIELDs

Let me say firstly that what we are

dealing with here is basically an anology or an attempt to
apply the doctrine of the Chaplinsky case.

It was always

thought, and I assume that it is still the case, that the
state has the burden to show that the conduct which it seeks

14
to punish poses an imiraent threat to the peace.

In Finer

v, New York, for example, this Court found and over some
dissents that the group which the defend»t was addressing was
ready to fight.

Finer was warned, 1 believe, on three

occasions to desist from the activity in which he was
engaged, and he refused to do so.

And, consequently,, he was

arrested»
In this case, as far as the record discloses, nobody
except the police saw the flag.
Q

lire you suggesting that every statute of this

kind must have as its predicate that the statement show that
it has the fighting words implication of the ChapXinsky ease?
MR. GREENFIELDs

That is the position, I think, that

one is lead to if one assumes, as the state argues, that the
purpose of the statute is to preserve the peace.

That is,

here what happened, ray client flew his flag from his window.
The police cme in and adverted to it, and Mr. Spence said that
he had no idea there was anything wrong with this.

He would

be happy to take it down.
Contrast that to Hr. Finer, who refused after being
asked by the police to desist from speech.

But what happened

in this case was that Hr. Spence was summarily arrested and
taken off to jail.
The appellant has cited in its brief most of, if
not ail of, the cases that this Court has heard that have

15
involved various uses of the flag.

In

none of them has

there been even a suggestion that some kind of violent
reaction by any of thecbservers was likely to follow.

And X

know of no such incident, and the state has made no attempt to
cite it.
Surely here, where only three policemen observed
the appellant’s conduct, it stretches- the imagination to ask
this Court X think to conclude that there was an imminent
threat of violence.

But I would repeat that X think if is

presumptuous of the state to ask this Court to judicially
notice that the average citizen of the

State of Washington,

when confronted with a flag with, for example, 811 love
America" superimposed on it, is going to to be moved to
c. reaction.
And X do not think t can emphasize too much the
breadth of this statute.

The flag which is displayed in

this courtroom is in blatant violation of the Washington
statute that is under review here.

It has attached to it a

yellow fringe, and there is nothing in Title 4 in the
description of the flag that makes the flag red, white, blue,
and yellow.

That fringe is attached in the same sense as

tlr. Spence’s peace symbol was attached to the flag.

And yet

he was prosecuted, and I assume that no prosecution will arise
out of this instance.
Q

We are not in the State of Washington.

16

MR. GREENFIELD?

The District has a comparable

statu® under which, 1 am sorry to advise the Court, the flag
1 think is a blatant violation [laughter].
Q

I would suspect that we could uphold the statute

and still let that flag stay there.
MR. GREENFIELDs
Q

2 am sorry, I could not hear you.

I would suspect that wa could uphold the

Washington statute and it would not apply to that flag.
MR. GREENFIELD;
how, Mr. Justice Marshall.

I find it difficult in a way to see

the statute and read into it, for examp le-*Q

Is that not bad with the statute?

MR. GREENFIELD;

One of the problems with this

kind of statute is of course it is always difficult to say.
Q

The difference is that your statute was in the

man5s front window.

Was this thing sewed on?

MR. GREENFIELD:

No.

The record indicates that

Mr. Spence used a form of tape so that there would be no harm

17
done to the flag.

Thero is nothing again—the state does not

contend—
Q

How many people, do you say, in the State of

Washington knew what he meant when he put the peace symbol on
the flag?
MR. GREENFIELD:

I think the average viewer would

have known it.
Q

Would have known what?

MR. GREENFIELD?

Would have

known what he was

trying to communicate„
Q

Which is what?

MR. GREENFIELD:

Which was a protest to the then

immediately preceding events, the invasion of Cambodia—
Q

How in the world could he know that?

MR. GREENFIELD:
Q

Well, Your Honor, I think that-—

He could have been protesting the invasion of

Timbuktu■
MR. GREENFIELD:

Let me give the Court an example. If

somebody is standing on a street corner with a big sign that
says, "Stop" or "Peace Now," this is a fairly ambiguous sign­
as is most language, unless you put it into some specific
context.
Q

Suppose he put the peace symbol on the flag new,

what would it mean today?
MR. GREENFIELD:

Today?

1s
Q

Yes.

MR. GREENFIELD:

I think that- it would depend in

large measure on—
Q

On what?

MR. GREENFIELD:

—on where it was displayed, by

whom, and for whom.
Q

Suppose it was displayed outside of this

building, across the street on an American flag right now?
what would the message be?
MR. GREENFIELD:
Q

It might well-™

You do not have the slightest idea what it

would mean.
MR. GREENFIELD:
would be ambiguous.

I would certainly concede that it

However, in this situation Z do not

think that it was at all ambiguous, and I would refer the
Court to the state’s brief at page 2 and 3, where it fills in
the background which I think gave very clear meaning to
Mr. Spence's words, that is, to his expression.
States had

just invaded Cambodia.

The United

And I think, as the state

observes, millions of Americans had this on their mind? also
the tragedy of Kent State University had just occurred.
Q

Do you think that there were some people in

Washington that did not even know what the peace symbol meant?
MR. GREENFIELD:
Mr. Spence identified it.

The police officers who arrested

19
Q

Do you think gome people other than police

officers in Washington might not have known what the peace
symbol meant at all?
MR. GREENFIELDs

X am sure that that is the case,

Mr. Justice Marshall, just as I am sure that in any—
Q

Then you would agree it was not a clear message.

MR. GREENFIELD:

Not to certain people.

But I think

that if we impose too heavy a burden of clarity on people who
are attempting to convey First amendment messages, then
perhaps the average citisen is going to have to remain silent.
The record also clarifies to a substantial extent, and I
think the state concedes, what the message that ray client was
attempting to convey was.
This case, ©f course, comes her© on a stipulated
net of facts, and the message is, X think, part of the
stipulation.

The state paraphrases the testimony of

Mr. Spence, which X think again, if it does not convey
something so clear that it could be reduced to a mathematical
forms 1
Q

X am not quarreling about what he meant to

say? X am quarreling about what people understood him to Bay . .
MR. GREENFIELD:

it is not possible, X do hot think, to infer from that sign
just what their program for peace might be.

Q

It might be peace in Washington, D. C.

MS. GREENFIELD:
that ground this Court

It might.

would

But I wonder whether on

want to go so far as to say

that the message is not protected, that if one cannot pinpoint
a precise political program that therefore on© is foreclosed
from speaking.

And I think under the circumstances, this was

a relatively clear political message.

It should, I think, an

opposition to the policies of the Administration at that time,
and I think the average citizen would have taken it to advert
both to the

Cambodia incident and to that at Kent State

University.
Q

Your first question attacks the statute as

applied.
MR. GREENFIELD:
Q

Correct.

And it is your second question that attacks

it facially?
MR. GREENFIELD:

Correct, Your Honor.

And here I

think that the argument which appellant makes is precisely
that which Judge Lumbard made in Long Island Moratorium
Committee v. Cahn.
Q

You mean the facial attack?

MR. GREENFIELD:

Correct.

The state characterises

that I think inaccurately as applying only to the specific
symbol which appeared as an appendix to that opinion, but the
language of Chief Judge Lombard's opinion I think is

21
absolutely clear.
face.

He was disqualifying the statute-on its

This is the kind of statute that led Judge'Craven of

the Fourth Circuit in Parker v. Morgan to observe that for
people in North Carolina with such a statute on the books, it
was dangerous to possess any obsect that was red, white, and
blue.
If there are no further questions-—
Q

Mr. Greenfield, did you ever answer the

question as to your view where a flag is burned in public?
MR. GREENFIELDs

I did not, Mr. Justice Powell,

and 1 would say that under this particular statute, flag
burning would not be a violation.
I think a state could properly design a statute which
would prohibit burning of anything on the street for safety
reasons and which could reach a flag.

I think just as the

copyright example that Mr. Justice Rehnquist gave, we are not
saying that the state has its hands tied whenever anyone
attempts to communicate a message.
However, if the statute only applied to American.
flags rather than to, for example, Canadian flags, that were
burned on the street, then the obsect of the statute would
be to get at the message and not to protect the safety of
passersby from burning obsects.

And J. think that runs

squarely counter to the theory expressed by this Court in
West Virginia v. Barnette.

It elevates the flag to the level

22
of an idolo
Q

When you refer to safety, X take it from what

you have said, you are not thinking about possibility of
breach of the peace but of someone being burned?
MR. GREENFIELDS
Q

Correct.

Corns back a moment to the statement that you

made, that you thought the statute was void on its face.

Is

that because of vagueness or overbreadth?
MR. GREENFIELD:

It is both.

I hope that I may

reserve some time for rebuttal, but let ms in response to your
question say that the statute is overbroad because all ©f
these examples, beginning with the flag in this courtroom and
the buttons which Chief Justice Lumbard—Chief Judge Luxnbsrd
referred to in Cahn, would be prohibited and it was
inconceivable to that court and I think that it would be
inc ncaivable to this Court that that kind of traditional
expressive conduct could be a violation of any properly drawn
statute.
If the purpose is to promote respect for the flag,
then the statute is overbroad if it prevents a 'citisen from
saying, "I love the flag," or as one of the exhibits in this
case exemplifies, prints in a newspaper, the Declaration of
Independence superimposed on the flag on the occasion of
Independence Day.

This is a plain violation of the statute,

and it is for that reason overbroad.

23
The vagueness arguant basically takes off from tb :
proposition that mast of the courts oho reviewed' these kinds
of statutes had said they cannot be taken literally because,,
if they do, they have all these absurd consequences? and
consequently one has to guess as to whether this flag
constitutes a violation and Mr. Spence’s flag does not.

And

if one has to guess, the statute is vague.
Thank you.
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Warm®.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. WARM'S. ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. WARMEs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
1 have taken some time in my brief to set out the
facts in this particular case fox' the Court.

And I intended

to convey to the Court that the state does not consider the
equities in this particular case to be overwhelmingly on its
side.

Mr. Spence was certainly one of the most pleasant

people that it has ever been my duty to prosecute, and X
recognise the equities in Mr. Spence’s position.

But that

does not mean that the statute itself is unconstitutional.
And X think if we concede the equities and deal solely

with

the stitute, then we will be in a much better position to
determine whether or not the statute itself is constitutional.
q

Do X correctly read the record that the essence;

24
or his defense was that: he was not showing contempt or
disrespect but he was showing respect for the flag by
associating it with the concept of peace?
ME» WARMEz

That was his defense»

That defense was

rejected as a matter of law by the trial court»
Q

That was his testimony essentially*, was it not?

MR» WASMEs

It was his testimony, but it was not

relevant, and the jury was instructed that that was not
relevant.
The Court should understan the statutory scheme
in the State of Washington.

There are two statutes.

The

first statute and the statute which we are considering here
is the improper display of the flag statute, which is a
misdemeanor.

There is -a second statuto, which is a flag

desecration statute in the same chapter, which is a gross
misdemeanor, more serious crime, and which makes it a crime to
cast contempt upon an American flag or to defile an American
flag, which would be the case if there were some type of
burning or a dismemberment.
How, that statute has been construed by the State
of Washington, Stato v. Turner, to require an intent to
desecrate.

So that the ambiguous act of burning a flag may

or may not constitute a desecration of the flag under that
statute.

That would protect a person, would it not, who

an old, worn out

tiered flag and follows the

procedure recommended in some congressionally published flag
book that the thing to do with such a flag is not throw it
in the garbage pail but to cremate it»
I®» WARMS:
Q

That is correct.

So that he

would be protected because his

purpose was a benign purpose.
MR. WARMS:

That is correct.

And it was

originally the, position of Mr. Spence and the trial court that
he was protected under the same doctrine, because the display
was a benign disply, that his intention was good.

The court

said as a matter of law that is not an element and it is not
a defense, that it is a malum prohibitura act, the improper
display of the flag, and that it is not a crime in which
intent is an issue.
G

In soma of the history books there is a

picture of the kind your friend referred to, of I think the
campaign perhaps of Grover Cleveland in McKinley's day.

One

of the campaign documents was the American flag with the
picture of the candidate Grover Cleveland superimposed over
it.

If that were dons today, that would violate the

Washington statute, would it not?
MR. WARMS:
Q

If it were a picture of the flag?

NO.

MR. WARMEs

If it were the flag itself?

26
G

The flag itself.

MR. WARME:

If it were the flag itself, it would

violate the statute, that is
Q '

correct.

But you say if it were reproduced .as it is in

the history book, it would not be.
MR. WARME:
Q

It would not be.

Just the picture of a flag, not a flag.

MR. WARME:

That is correct.

I think it is important to point out to the, Court
that the statute is very, very broad, as counsel has urged.
But the—

Excuse me, I do not understand that answer.

This says the word 55flag, ' copy, picture, or representation
thereof.Si
MR. WARMS:

That is exactly right, and that is the

point I am coming to.
broad.

The statute itself is very, very

As interpreted by the state supreme court in the case

of Washington v. Spence-,- the statute is severable, and we
were only dealing with an actual American flag.

At the

superior court level, the court of appeals level, and the
state supreme court level, Mr. Spence always urged that the
statute had to be considered as a whole, that you have to
consider the words

"picture, representation, color scheme/'

what have you.
The Washington State Supreme Court said not so.

27
They said in their opinion. and. I will quote the word a of
the court *

"The only'5—
Q

What page of the appendis is that on again?

MR. WARME:

it is, I believe—

Forty-seven?

MR. WARME;

Is it?

Yes, 47.
"The only interdiction of froa

speach so far as this case is concerned is that one ecscoc

official symbols which are not before us,S!
Although it was urged that these symbols were
properly before the Court, they said no? in interpreting the
statute we do not have to consider these other parts of the
sratute because we consider them severable, not an integral
part of the statute.

That has always been the rule in the

dtate of Washington, most recently set out in State v.
Anderson, which we have cited in our brief and which is also
the federal rule on interpretation, which is—
Q

Of course, we are concluding by whatever

interpretation your—
MR. WARMS:
is my position.

That is my position, Your Honor.

So that the

That

question of the pictures, the

representations, the buttons, the telephone -with the red,
chits, and blue color scheme, are not properly before this
Court under this statute, because the state supreme court
has said, "We can consider those separately."

Q

What happens to the battalion flag of a regiment

MiR. WARMS;
Q

The battalion flag or the American flag?

The American flag which the battalion puts on

MR. WARME;

I do not believe that they are generally
1 believe they are usually attached

to the staff of the flag itself.
Q

And they hang on down?

MR. WARME;

And they hang on down.

And that is

not prohibited under the statute.
Q

Suppose it ware attached to the flag.

MR. WARME;

That would be a 'violation.

That would

be a violation.
Q

I would like to see the State of Washington

try to enforce it.
MR. WARME:

I have never seen a violation of it,

Your Honor, in the State of Washington.

1 think generally in

that type of situation where you have a military situation
there are rules of protocol which are enforced by the
military itself.

So, it.is a hypothetical problem, but 1

do not think it. is an actual problem.
And X think that sufficiently answers the overbreadth argument of counsel.

I think that the state supreme

court interpretation is such that it is not an argument

29
anymore.
Clearly the moat overwhelming part of the argument
is? that this statute does constitue a violation or an
infringement upon the appellant's First Amendment rights»

They said there

O'Brien analysed the

Tinker case.
Q

Tinker, X gather, treated

the wearing of the

armband as if it were spoken words.
MR. WARME;
Q

That is correct.

And I am assuming—

And is that not the problem here?

MR. WARMS;

This is not pure speech.

But for the

sake of argument, let us assume that it is.
Q

Is it not:'.arguably like .the Tinker—

MR. WARME:

X think that it is arguably like it.

30
I will assume for the sake of argument that it is.

Although

I do not think that we have to go as far as the cases—the
clear and present danger cases—because I think we only have
to go as far as O’Brien since what we are talking about is
symbolic speech, which O’Brien has somewhat limited.

But I

am going to address myself to the clear and present danger,
this legitimate state interest in prohibiting this type of
conduct.
There are three interests which I have heard the
Court discuss with counsel.

And I think that they have to be

distinguished.
The first interest is the interest in promoting
respect for the flag.

That is not a legitimate state

I conceded that throughout ray brief, that the

state .government cannot control people’s attitudes about the
flag, totally improper* whether it be through symbolic speech
or pure speech, an improper state interest.
G

But you do not suggest that goes so far as to

say the state «ray not prevent someone from showing disrespect
by burning the flag?.
MR. WARMEs

That would corse under the other

section of Title 9, Chapter 86,

I do not care what, it comes under.

that the state may not do that?

MR. WARME:

Q

In other words , yon are not giving away your

defilement statute that, you referred to before?
MR„ WARMSi

Ho, I am not giving away the defilement

stc.tute.: although X think about that statute and—
Q

X would think that if you were going to give

that away, you would give this statute away a fortiori.
HR. WARMS:

X thought about that, and I think the

answer is-"
Q

X would think you would.

HR. WARMSs

X think the answer is no to that

particular argument.
Q

Why?

HR. WARMS:

Because in that particular statute

what you attempt to control is people’s attitudes towards the
flag, again an improper state interest.
Q

X suppose you suggest though that the state

has an interest in protecting the integrity of the flag.
MR. WARMS;

That is the second interest that X was

going to talk about.

That was the interest which the state

supreme court found.

They said that the state has an

interest in protecting the integrity of the flag and keeping
it away from external adornmentts.
Q

But you. have not taken that position here.

MR. WARMS i

I am not going to say that the state

sup re: -a court is wrong, but that was not the grounds that we

urged before the state suprema court, and that is not the
grounds that 1 am urging before this Court»
Q

Maybe they felt something was wrong with your

ground.
MR. WARMS:
Q

We are reviewing their

Q

Obviously they did, Your Honor»
judgment, not yours»

You are reviewing a statute, as I

It is not a question of either-my

-judgment—

We are reviewing the judgment of the state

supreme court.
Q

The judgment but not necessarily its opinion.

MR. WARME:

That is correct.

In the third state interest, which—
Q

The second has escaped me.

What was the

second one?
Mr. WARME:

The second one is preserving the

integrity of the flag. •
Q

What does that mean, do you think?

MR. WARME:

It means that the state has established

the flag as the national symbol, and it has the same rights
in the flag, for instance, as Mr. Cohan would have in his
song.
Q

Ho, those are property rights.

Those are

statutory property rights that are protected by the copyright
law, and that is for the appropriation of somebody else * s

33
property.

The state has no property right in the flag, does

it, vis-a-vis any individual citizen of the United States or
of the state?
MR. WARMEs

1 do not particularly think so, but I

think that is what the state supreme court said in its opinion.
But 7 do not think that is what the state legislature said
either.
Q

You are not defending what the state supreme

court said.
MR. WARMS:

i am not defending what the state supreme

court said.
Q

But you are not abandoning it either.

MR. WARMSs
I am not defending it.
Q

I am not abandoning it [laughter], but
That is correct.

What do you rely on?

MR. WARMS;
preserving the peace.

We rely upon the state interest of
This was the same state interest that

was found in Radi eh v. Nev? York, the only other case which
came from the Supreme Court.

That was a case without an

opinion„ where the New York court said there was a legitimate
interest in preserving the peace.
I think that same interest applies in a desecration
statute, and I think if it is a public desecration of the
flag, then the state interest is there.

If if. is a private

desecration or defilement of the flag, I do not think that

34
there is a legitimate stata interest.

And I think this

answers Hr. Justice White's obsection.
Q

Then you have to read that into your statute.

Certainly there is nothing in the statute which speaks of—
MR. WARMSs
Q

Of preserving the peace?

Right.

MR. WARMSs

1 appreciate that. Your Honor.

In

reviewing all of the criminal laws, I do not know that any of
them say that the state interest which we are promoting here
is written into the statute.

The determination of state

interest is a. proper judicial determination, and it is not
dependant upon the wording of the statute nor is it a question
of fact to be proven at the trial court.
Q

But your state

MR. WARME:
Q

supreme court did not.

Pardon me?

Did your state supreme court read it in the

statute?
MR. WARME s
Q

They did not.

MR. WARME:

They did not, that is correct.

So, how can we?

MR. WARME:

Q

No, they did not.

We are talking about statutory

And the question in terms of—
You admit that you urged this "on your supreme

-They did not accept

it, aight?
MR. WARMS 2
Q

Right.

You are saying we

should accept it even though

they refused to accept it.
MR. WARMS:
Q

That is correct.

You really are not talking about statutory

interpretation, are you?

You are talking about bases on

which the statute as written might ha constitutionally
sustained,
MR* WARMSs
Q

Absolutely correct.

So that you do not need to say that the

legislative shows this or the supreme court interpreted it to
mean this if, in effect, you can sell five

justices of this

Court on the idea.
MR. WARMS:

I believe that is correct? since we are

not talking about a practical construction of the statuter
then the rules of interpretation are not binding on this
Court*

What we are talking about is the underlying state

interest which this Court has to decide.
Q

Can we decide that when the Washington court

decided it was something else than you are urging here?
MR. WARMS:

I think so.

I very definitely think

36
so.

I think if—well, I think that this Court has

consistently found the proper state interest or lack of proper
state interest# regardless of the opinion of the state
suprema court.
For instance# if the state supreme court were to
say there was a proper state interest in preserving
respect for the flag under this statute, this Court would not
hesitate to say, "No# that is improper."
Q

The real question that no one has asked you is,

Why do you not at least partially advance the thesis of the
Washington State Supreme Court?
MR. WARMS?

I have set it forth in my brief.

it is there to be considered.
strongest argument.

But

1 think

1 do not think it is the;

That is quite frankly my feeling.

I feel

that the the stronger., argument is that there is a legitimate
state interest in preserving the peace # and that is what the
statute stands for.
Q

Even though the Washington Supreme Court has not

said so?
MR. WARM'S s

Even though they said there were other

grounds that they thought were sufficient for the statute#
there were other
0

legitimate state interests.

Did they say that really?

MR. WARMEs

Yes# they did.

They said that-—! do not

have the. quote—but they said that the nation has established

37
a symbol, ind the state has a legitimate interest in
preserving its integrity and keeping it free from extraneous
adornment»
Q

May I ask this question:

Does the record show

whether or not this statute has been uniformly applied?
Suppose, for example, somebody mentioned what had been placed
on the flag was something like "God save America®“

Have you

ever broght a prosecution or had any occasion to consider
bringing one?
MR. WARME:

l never brought a prosecution.

never seen a prosecution brought.

I have

1 have never seen the flag

used that way either.
Q

Is this the only prosecution that has ever been

brought?
MR. WARME:

As far as I know, this is! the only

prosecution that has ever been brought under this particular
statute in the State of

State of Washington? that is correct.

The record is devoid of any type of arbitrary enforcement by
prosecutors or police forces, although it has been asserted
in the brief of the. appellant that such arbitrary enforcement,
does exist? I have not seen it, and the record is devoid of
any type of proof of that.
Q

Would this on the flag not be as much a

protest as this peace decal?
MS. WARME:

It certainly would.

And it would be

3Q
prohibited for the same reason, that it is an improper
vehicle; the flag is an improper vehicle for conveying
political or social ideas—
Q

Why, because of the breach of the peace argu­

ment?
MR. WARMEs

That is correct.-

And I appreciate that

on this Court and in this courtroom there probably a greater
proportion of people who do not attach the emotional
involvement to the American flag that the general population
does.

X think as you become more and more educated and you

start thinking about things like, particularly I suppose., the
rise of Naziisia in Germany, you become very suspicious about
chauvinistic tendencies.

And, as a consequence, more

educated people, I think, tend to have a tendency to shy away
from strong emotional identification with symbols.

But that

does not mean either that it is improper for people to have
that particular strong emotional identification, or for the
state to recognise that people have that particular strong
emotional identi£ication•
Q

How much disorder would "God save: America" on

the- flag provoke?
MR. WARMS»

It depends on the circumstances.

It

would depend upon the circumstances.
Q
somebody

I suppose it might mean God save America from

39

M.E„ WARS®:

Gca save America ires Richard Hixon

would probably be a feeling that would invoke a certain amount
of ire in a substantial portion of the population»
Q

In this case the only ire was three policemen.

Am I right?
MR. WARMEs

That is not exactly correct* Your Honor.

If I can explain the record in this particular' case vary
briefly, the Washington rules.provide for a stipulated
statement of the facts.

Mr. Spence was indigent.

The state

agreed that we would stipulate to the relevant facts and come
to this Court on a stipulation of what those facts were.

The

evidence at the trial was that & passerby first called the
police.

That evidence was rejected, although the state

offv-red that evidence, by the trial court before it ever went
to the jury on the grounds that that was not relevant
evidence to any element of the statute, that it was a malum
prohibitum statute, and that the actual response of the
people to the statute was—
Q

It aroused -the ire of four people.

MR. WARMEs

Again, my point is that the response of

the people to the statute does not determine the
constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the statute
itsn.12”, that that .has to be determined from examining the
statute.

If we require that for the statute to be constitu­

tional there there be an actual present danger, than we come

40
into the position where it is only a crime to yell "FireEi in
a crowded theatre if the people actually react violently.
Q

Then all you have to do is pass a statute and

say nobody can say anything about anybody else.

It would be

awful hard to get a fight then, would it not?
MR. WARME:

It would be hard to get a fight, but

that is not—
Q

In this particular case, the nssn was not on

the street; he was in his own apartment.
MR. WARMS:
Q

That is correct.

How far up was the apartment?

MR. WARME:

He was on either the second or the

third floor.
Q

And ha had his flag in his window?

MR. WARMEs
Q

Out his window.

MR. WARME:
Q

Out his window.

That is correct.

And he never went out in the street?

I®. WARME:

He never went out on the street.

I

think he had it out about five minutes when—*
Q

And that just completely disrupted the peace

of the queen?
MR. WARME:

MO, it did not.

But 1 do not think

that in order for the statute to withstand constitutional
scrutiny there would have to be actual violence.

41
Q

Why did you need three policemen?

MR„ WARMEj

2 appreciate, Your Honor, that ray

position would be much stronger if one police officer had
given the man a citation»
position»

I would prefer to be in that

But that still does not change the fact—
Q

You would not have sent three?

MR. WARMS;
officers there.

No, 2 would not have sent three police

Even the police officers had a discussion

about whether to give him & citation, but that does not have
anything to do with the statute itself,
Q

Since Mr. Greenfield relied on historical

examples, you might offer Barbara Fritchey to support the
possibility of public outrage at the waving of a flag from a
window.
MR, WARMS*
Your Honor.

That is an interesting observation,

I would—

0

Has the attorney general of your state talcen a

position in this case?
MR. WARMSs

Mo, the attorney general has not.

The

attorney general has no criminal jurisdiction In the State
of Washington,
Q

Who does?

MR. WARMS;

Just the local prosecutor?

The local prosecutor, who is an elected

official.
I would direct this Court's attention, to the case of

42
Halter v. Nebraska, which pro'::ably is irappropos in the face
of the challenge to the First itaancteant font is not inappropos
to the observation that was made by the Court at that time
in recognising the dynamic nature of the symbol of th© flag
and where the Court said»

recognising the legitimate state

interest that we are urging here» wInsults to the flag have
been the causes of wars and have on occasion been punished
summarily by those who hold it in reverence.”

That is the

type of situation that we are talking about here.
The flag is not a proper vehicle for expressing
certain types of ideas-.

And in order to avoid the

constitutional problems of deciding or favoring ideas, the
stats has made the prohibition absolute.

It says not only

can we not express favorable ideas such as supporting the
nation in an armed conflict, rallying behind the Congress—
Q

Suppose he had not put this peace symbol on the

flag but simply put th© peace symbol on hie window.
MR. WARMEs
Q

'No'problem at all.

Would that not have provoked as much disorder

as putting it on the flag?
MR. WARME:
Q

No, because th® nature of the offense—

At that time in that context.

MR. WARME:

Well, I do not think so, Your Honor.

There were a lot of peace symbols in Seattle at that. time.
But the nature of the offense is not—the nature of the insult

43
is not to the policy so much as it is to the flag.

Q

But the First Amendment, in any event, whether

or not it provoked disorder, would have protected the
display merely of a peace symbol, not of the peace symbol
on the flag, if lie just put the peace symbol on his window?
MR. WARMS:

If the peace symbol waa on his window

and there were an actual disturbance, then—
Q

The First Amendment would not protect him?

MR. WARMS:

I do not know that the First. Amendment

would not protect the display, but 1 think the police would
be authorised to take appropriate action to preserve the
peace.

And if that appropriate action were under the

ci r cums tan ces - *•
9

This would be only if in fact there were

disorder, you are suggesting?
MR. WARMB:

That is correct, because what we are

talking about is—*

Q

And if there were none, the mere fact that he

displayed it, he could and would be protected by the First
Amendment.
MR. WARME:
Q

Absolutely correct.

Suppose the peace symbol was pasted against

the window and the flag was directly behind it but was not
attached to it.
MR. WARMS:

Under the statute, it would not be a

44
violation.
Q

That is right»

MR. WARMSs

Under the statute it would not be a

violation? that is correct.
Q

But all of the problems could happen as a

result of that.
MR. WARMSs
Q

If--

And there is nothing you could do until the

problem, until the disorder occurredj am 1 right?
MR. WARMS:
Q

That is correct.

That is correct.

So, the only thing here is that it touched the

flag?
MR. WARMS %
Q

That is correct.

And that was the ham,

MR. WARMS:

touching the flag.

That is correct, but 1 think if the

Court dwells on the facts, it tends to minimize the nature of
the offense.

And if we go back to Chaplinsky, where we

had the citizen calling the police officer "a goddam Fascist,”
1 believe was the term that they used there, this Court
recognized that whether or not—whether or not”™the police
officer became aroused or

whether or not the citizenry

became aroused, the nature of the insult was such that it
was the type of insult likely to provoke a disturbance of the
peace.

And in Halter v. Nebraska, relying on the same test,

they said the use of the flag is the same type of personal

45
insult that is involved, in Ch&plinsky.

And I think this is

to be distinguished from Cohen v. California, where they had
the young man who wrote, "Fuck the draft1' bn the back of his
coat and wore it into the courtroom,

No one, l do not think,

was personally insulted by this person's particular
opposition to the draft.

I do not think the draft is

something

that people have strong personal feelings about.
If he had written this same obscenity perhaps on an
American flag and substituted "America" for "the -draft,"
then you would have people who wwold be personally affronted
by this particular type of obscenity.

And that is the

distinction that the Court made in Cohen.
Q

I am wondering if your grounds for upholding

the statute are as different from those of the Supreme Court
of Washington as you intimated at one time, where basically
you. argument is that people may become aroused; by insults to
the physical integrity of the flag—is it not?—and that
«

the state may use that as a basis for legislating?
• .

MR. WARMS:

I had not thought of it in that term,

but I can appreciate that, the supreme court may have been
thinking that an just had' not gone as far and said the
reason, for preserving the integrity of the flag is to prevent
people from insulting the flag.
Q

At least there is some overlap,. I would think,

between the argument that you are making and the one used by

46
the Suprema Court of Washington.
MR. WARMS:
Q

Yes, I think so»

It is clear that you concede that putting the

words "God bless America" over 'the flag would b® as much a
violation

of the statute as the present case.
MR. WARMS:

It would.

The problem that we have is

the City Police of Chicago v. Mosley, where they said, "Now,
you can protest labor disputes in front of the public
schools, but you cannot Protest racial segregation."
a selective type of choosing by the state.

You have

We are going to

favor certain attitudes; we are going fc© favor certain
expressions and we are going to suppress others.

Then you

have very seirious constitutional questions.
Q

Your friend says that one of the reasons this

statute is overbroad is because it would prohibit both of
these expressions equally, the favorable and the ambiguous
one.'..

That is the core part of his argument on 'overbreadth=
MS. WARMS:

That is the core part of it, but I think,

Your Honor, that it is also appropriate for the Court to
consider that using the. flag, even for the purpose of what
one person may consider, to be a benign purpose may be
considered by others to foa a cause of insult, as was in this
particular case.

The ambiguous nature of the symbol in this

case could be interpreted either of two ways.
If there are no further questions, then I will

47
submit my argument.

m. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Greenfield,., do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GREENFIELD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GREENFIELD:

Let me just clarify that

personal in the sense that Mr. W&rme was using it is slightly
different, I think, than personal in the sene.® in which it
was used in Chaplinsky.

That is, the fighting words doctrine

involves words directed at a parson, not something that one
may, as a matter of his own feelings, find to be troubling.
And let me say in responsa to

Justice Powell's

question, there are two examples of selective enforcement in
the? record in this case,

Exhibits 1 and 2, one of which is

an American flag and a picture with the Declaration of
independence superimposed.

There have been many such

examples in the State of Washington, and none of them have
resulted, in prosecution.
The Washington Supreme Court did not narrow the
statute in its decision here.

It simply refused to consider

what it regarded as hypothetical examples, rejecting what
appvlb?;nt had asked that It invoice, namely, the First
Amendment overbreadth argument that would allow other
instances to be considered than a statute as overbroad as
this one.

49
and 1 think that they threaten to make the American flag just
the kind of golden image which would have horrified Thomas
Jefferson»
Q

Did your research, Mr. Greenfieldf reveal

anything that

would cause you to disagree with your brother

that this is the one and only prosecution under this statute,
in the history of the state?
MR. GREENFIELD:

There are no other reported

opinions, Your Honor, and there have been, other flagprosecutions non© of which have reached, oo far as I know,
the constitutional issues involved but X think that’ they were
under the desecration statute.
Q

So far as you know, under this statute, this

the one and only, first and last prosecution since the
statute was enacted in 1919?
MR. GREENFIELD:

Correct.

And since it was upheld,

pdepic in Washington, will not know whether they dare wear a
campaign button of the kind that has been

exemplified or uea

any of the other flag related messages that are simply part

Q

Mr. Greenfield, you say in Chap 1 frisky, and of

course rightly, that it was personally directed to an
individual.

On the other hand, Finer—as I recall, Finer

referred to President Truman m a champagne.sipping bum, or
words to that effect-, to an audience.

And the suppression

s-.no x think that they threaten to make the its.®ricar flag jurt
the kind of golden image which would have horrified Thomas
Jefferson»
Q

Did your research,, Mr* Greenfield, reveal

anything that

would cause you to disagree with your brother

that this is the one and only prosecution under this statute
in the history of the state?
MR* GREENFIELDs

There are no other reported

opinions, Your Honor, and there have been other flag
prosecutions none of which have reached, so far as I know,
the constitutional issues involved but X think that they were
under the desecration statute.
Q

Bo far as you know, under this statute, this

the one and only, first and last prosecution since the
statute was enacted in 1919'?
MR. GREENFIELDs

Correct.

And since it was upheld,

people in Washington will not know whether they darn wear a
campaign butter, of the kind that has been

exemplified or use

any of the other flag related messages that are simply part
of Americana.
Q

Mr. Greenfield, you say in ChapHusky, and of

sours© rightly, that it was personally directed to an
individual.

On the other hand, Finer--as X recall, Finer

referred to President Truman as a champagne sipping bum, or
words fco that effect-, to an audience.

And the suppression

50
there. was not base;! on remarks addressed to the individuals
but tbs reaction of the individuals to remarks about a third
person.
MR,, GREENFIELDs

I think precisely the significance

of Finer was that one did not simply look at his words,
because 1 think Finer * s words in a different contest would
have been protected beyond question.

But it was the fact

that there was a crowd that was getting uneasy and that the
court found was about to' erupt into violence , that Finer
had bean warned to desist, and that he refused after three
warnings' to do so.

That was

what enabled the court to find

therms was an imminent threat of violence? and, therefore, under
the fighting word® doctrine, Finer could be prohibited from
continuing with his speech.
But here the state says it can erect a conclusive
presumption that because of the uneducated people of
ngtdn, that anyone who sees a flag with "God bless
America" over it is likely to respond by violent retaliation,
And I submit that that is simply implausible

'that none of the

flag cases in any jurisdiction support in effect a judicial
notice by this Court that the people of this country conform to
thar ci^gr^e to the description of Hobbes.
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER-:
