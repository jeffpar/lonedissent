MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hoar arguments

next in No» 72-331, hefkowitz v. Turley.
Miss Soloffjr you saay proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRENDA SOLGFF, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MISS SOLGFF:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice and may

it please the Court:
At issue in this ease is the ability of the state,
in this ease New York,, and its subdivisions, here Erie County,
to provide themselves with some reliable assurance that in
committing public funds to independent contractors, the con­
tractors will deal with them openly and candidly when informa­
tion is sought about those contracts.
Two related sets of New York statutes were struck
down by the District Court.

The first, which is New York's

general municipal law, section 103(a), is an example, requires
each public contract to contain a provision that if a person
who la called before a grand jury ©r other agency which is
authorised to subpoena and swear witnesses, if such a' person
is called to testify in an investigation concerning a public
contract and he refuses to sign a waiver of immunity against
subsequent criminal prosecution or to answer any relevant
question concerning that contract or transaction, then that
person and any business organisation of which he is a member or

4
officer shall foe disqualified from public contracting for five
years and his existing contracts may be cancelled.

That is the

first set of statutes involved.
The second group of statutes struck down below, and
which New York municipal law, section 103(b) is an example, is
directed at already completed contracts and transactions, and
establishes a five-year disqualification from future contract­
ing for a similar refusal to cooperate under similar circum­
stances .
Both of these statutes and related statues which are
similar in other sections of New York law ware struck down by
the District Court.
The two appellees in this case are licensed architects
and members of a partnership which, according to the complaint,
had various contracts with Erie County.

The only one of these

contracts which is specifically mentioned in the. complaint
concerns the construction of a domed stadium in Erie County,
similar to the Astrodome in Houston.
In answering the complaint in the District Court., the
Erie County Attorney admitted the existence of various contracts
and of the stadium contract.

This is the only information in

the record about contracts between appellees and any public
agency in New 'fork »
On February 8, 1971, while under public contract,
the two appellees and another member of the partnership were

s
subpoenaed to testify before an Erie County Grand Jury respect­
ing transactions and contracts that they had with the county.
All three were presented with waivers of immunity which they
were asked to sign.

All three refused.

The third member of

the partnership then was granted immunity and testified.

The

other two did not and did net testify.
The appropriate authorities were informed of the re­
fusals 'and the instant action followed in the United States
District Court for the Western District of New York.

Claiming

that they had in the passed and wished in the future to
contract with the state and its agencies, the appellees claimed
that the statutes violated their privilege ©gainst selfincrimination.
A three-judge District Court, in what must be re­
garded as an over-extension of the decisions of this court in
Gardner v. Broderick, and its companion cases, agreed, and the
statutes were enjoined.
However, in seeking to protect the public interest,
the state has not acted unreasonably toward its contractors.
The state and the businessmen enter not only into a business
arrangement but into something of & social contract as well.
The state begins with a premise that public money must be wall
and carefully spent.,

Neither cost nor quality must be tainted

by graft, bribery, the use of inferior materials, or any other
unseen impermissible factor.

:

isn't it?
MISS SOLOFF:
Q

That * s right, Your Honor.

So why Is this differant from the Gardner case?

MISS SOLOFFs

This is differant from the Gardner case

in a number of respects»

A contractor, when he enters into a

»4

contract, understands at the beginning what is expected of him.
• \. o ■ .■

1

He hasn’t committed his life, his career, his ability to earn
a living to this contract.
episodic source.,

He is seeking profit from an-

Ha knows at the time that he enters it, enters

the contract, that this kind of information will be required of
him.
Q

I wonder if the Hew York City policeman in

Gardner knew about section 1123 of the Hew York City Charter,
1 .'r.

.*>

f;

Does that appear in the case?
Miss SOLOFF:
Honor.
■i

'•*

it does not appear in the case, Your

Section 1123 of the City Charter is undoubtedly a harder
f

thing to find.

That is one thing that can be said about It.

Beyond that, contractor® typically enter into contracts with
attorneys.

They have typically knowledge, they have the

advice of counsel at the time they enter contracts, and the
contract itself is for © limited span of time.

A policeman

doesn't consider perhaps ©very possible ramification of his

7
employment at the. time he takes that Civil Service examination,
doesn't have the advice of counsel, typically, and the section.
1123 was very different from the statutes that we have in this
case,
The statutes in this case request information concern­
ing any transaction or contract.

Section 1123 of the City

Charter talks about any kind of activity in city government —
much broader than the scop© of the duties of a policeman,

it

involves local elections, it involves any aspect of city govern­
ment which might possibly occur to an investigating agency.

It

isn't limited to the scop® of the employment of the policeman.
Q

But in each case, each basic situation is that

the contractor in the one case and the employee in the other
:

case, when called before & grand jury, must waive hia immunity?
Correct?
HISS SOBOFF:

He either waives — the agreement that

he makes is either to — that the contractor makes, 1 think
that there is a much closer question as to whether the public
employes makes such an agreement.
not to waive immunity.

The agreement he makes is

The agreement he makes is that if ho

does not waive immunity, then certain economic consequences
will follow.
Q

i.a. termination.

MISS SOLOFF:
Q

i.e. termination.

Suspension of the contractor for a period of

s
years? termination of the policeman —
MISS SOLOFF:
0

That's right.

— from his'employment.

MISS SOLOFF;

That's right, termination of this par­

ticular contract is discretionary, and disqualification for a
limited period ©£

time.

The consequences to a contractor are-

far less devastating than they are, of course, to an employee.
Q

Than do X understand you correctly that fchJ&

case, the question in this case is whether a contractor is
sufficiently different from an employee, so that the rule of
the Gardner case does not apply?

Is that really what it comes

down to?
MISS SOLOFF:

X think that is what it comes down to,

Your Honor, although I think that the Court need not reach the
issue of reconsideration of the Gardner principle itself —
Q

Otherwise, we would have fc© reach the Gardner

principle, the Gardner constitutional principle, would we not?
MISS SOLOFF:

Yes, Your Honor, X think that is par-*

'fectly correct.

Q

All right.

MISS SOLOFF:

But that the consequences of what

happens to a contractor have to he considered from the point of
view

at the'point in view of what he bargained for, what was

it that he bargained for

at the time he went into the contract,

what was his understanding.

1 think one thing that is paresetly

9
clear is that the interests of the state are both urgent and
vital in the public contractor and in the public employee
situation.
It is also clear that a contractor has a higher obli­
gation than the ordinary citisen to provide information with
respect at least to the relationship which h© has with the
state.

If he is Unwilling to provide the information, then

the relationship should not continue.
So that the businessman understands when ha goes?
after a contract and in which ha is seeking to make the sub­
stantial amount of money, but before that money and even per­
haps public safety will foe committed to him, he must b© willing
to accept, certain preventive measures and to cooperate in any
necessary detection of wrongdoing.

Because typically in a

situation involving contracts, detection of wrongdoing will be
difficult.
So that he enters into the special relationship with
fcfo© state and he agrees that notwithstanding any possible
consequences, should the time coma he will foe open and honest,
even if it means that evidence will be used against him and
that he will b® brought to justice.
Obviously, a principal benefit of this understanding
is prevention.

Corruption may well foe nipped in the bud.

The

public not only is protected, font it has some sens® of confi­
dence that the contractors can foe called to account, that the

10
execution of contracts is an open book, and that the public is
not being had.
Q

The agreement in the contract is in the form of

a waiver of immunity?
HISS SOLGFF:

The statute provides that the contract

should contain & clause that in the event the contractor refuses
to waive immunity with respect to transactions or contracts had
with the state, or to answer relevant questions respecting the
contracts, then the economic consequences foiler.-?.
0

So if ha refuses to sign a contract with that

condition in it, then he is not going to get the contract?
MISS SOLOFFs
Q

That is correct.

So ther® is a condition or barrier to doing

business with the state which amounts to a waiver of immunity?
MISS SOLOFFs
•Q

No, I don * t think that that —

Well, eventually it will amount to that, because

he can’t get the next contract if he breaches that provision,
MISS SOLGFF:
he isunder no

At the time that he enters the contract,

impermissible coercion to take that contract.

He

is sifter something *— '
Q

That'a right.

MISS SOLOFF;

-- the state is after something.

he can at that point take it or not take it.

Yes,

But there is no ~-

this kind, of hard choice is not uknown and is not -' t r •.

.

Q

Unless h® is going to waive immunity, he can’t

11
get more than one contract?
MISS SOLOFF:
Q

That's right# unless he is going to —

So sooner or later it amounts to a — he either

waives immunity or ho doesn't do business with the state.
MISS SOLOFF:

He either* agrees that should it become

necessary he will waive immunity or he will not for a limited
period of time be able to do business with tine state.
Q

When a business does enough business with the

state or perhaps when he is informed enough and you can expect
him to have advice of conns© and what not# you should sustain
a state's insistence upon a waiver in advance?

Let’s don't

quibble about whether it is or Isn't — you say it isn't, I
look at it as sooner a later an enforced waiver.

Yon just say

that a contract ought to uphold. an advance waiver by a well
enough informed person.
MISS SOLOFF:

Where the interests are ao severe on

the part of the public, where the contractor is well enough in­
formed# where — l*m sorry# where the consequences are not the
devastating kind of consequences which occur to a public
employee, then the balance — and this is always a question of
balancing — shifts back toward the intonest of the public in
being able to know what has happened with its money and being
able somehow to prevent corruption, to have an extra tool in
preventing corruption in cases where public interest is so
vitally concerned.

12
Q

Well, you can't eoncad, can you, that there was

a violation of the provision of the Fifth Amendment that has
bean'hold to be incorporated in the 14th, and then say last wo
«should just overlook it in th© interests of the taxpayers of
the State of New York, that is hardly ~~ you can't concede a
violation, can you?
MISS SOLOFF:

Q

I don't concede a violation.

and just to balance that out, in the interests

of the taxpayers?
MISS SOLOFF:
impression.

No, no.

2sn sorry if I even gave that

What I m saying is that the balancing process

which takes place in determining whether or not —

Q

There was a violation.

MISS SOLOFF:

-*» there was a violation, is what is at

stake here, because th© question really is are you compelling
testimony by impermissible means.
G

Will this be a question of immunity or waiver?

If there is a waiver, there is no violation.

MISS SOLOFF:

But th® validity of the waiver•depends

on whether or not it is impermissibly compelled.
Q

Was there anything in the written contract that

referred to this?
MISS SOLOFF;

There is nothing in the record which

indicates one way or the other.

There is an allegation in a

memorandum of. law filed by the appellees after tha pleadings

13
were filed that this was not in this particular contract.

I

have since read the contract and the clause is not in the
contract.

It is not in the Erie County contract.

I don't

know about other contracts.
0

So you are simply relying on the presumption of

knowledge cf the law on the part of everybody, plus the fact
that this was presumably a sophisticated contractor with good
legal advice?
MISS SOLOFF:

I am relying on that, as well as the

fact that I have never heard a claim in the pleadings that he
didn't know what the consequences were.
0

My question is, is there any real dispute about

this at all?
MISS SOLOFF:
Q

I don't believe so.

About what?

MISS SOLOFF:

About whether or not the contractor

actually knew that he was subject to termination and disquali­
fication for failure to waive immunity.

And the answer as far

as I can derive it from the record is he was under no such —
ha was not ignorant of the fact; notwithstanding,the fact that
th® clause was not in the contract, the complaint below
attacked the contract clause statute and the District Court
struck it down.
Q

Now, is there — I asked you before — what is

it, section 1123 of the Mew York City Charter that was involved

in the Gardner case, these is no indication in that opinion, I
just read it, as to knowledge on the part of the policeman.
Do we know the chronology, if that was part of the city
charter at the time that policeman got his job?
MISS SOLOFPi
Q

We don't know that chronology.

That would be the same case that you have,

wouldn't it?
MISS SOLOFF:
Q

Yes.

I don’t ---

On this issue.

MISS SOLOFF:

I don't know the chronology in Gardner,

Mr. Justice Stewart.
Q

But if that ware a similar predecessor provision

a part of the city charter at the time the policeman in Gardner
got his job, that would foe the same situation ©a it is here,
with no indication that he did not know about it.
MISS SOLOFF:

I think that ve may have here, there

may he «era® failure in the pleadings- but I think that in
common «ense terms

have to assume it is much more likely

that the contractor in this case knew the rani f 5. cat ions of the
law than that the- polios-nan in Gardner found section 1123 of
the city charter=
Q

It has been my impression that employees gen­

erally know the deal about the —
MISS SOLOFF:

And also, as I have said, the kind of

consequence which attaches in Gardner and the kind of scope

15
Q

Well# that is something else,

That is a differ-

ant part of it.
MISS SOLOFF:

is very, very, very different from

it here, much different from that.
Q

Miss Soloff, suppose as a condition to getting

the contract, along the lines that Mr. Justice White was dis­
cussing with you, the state

presented the contractor, the

would be contractor with half a &oz&n standard forms of waiver
of immunity with the title of the grand jury and the data and
all that left in blank, but just got these waivers signed in
blank.

Would you think that would pass muster?
MISS SOLOFF:
Q

No, 1 wouldn’t, Your Honor.

How do you distinguish that from -- Justice

White was suggesting that this was a de facto waiver of im­
munity .
MISS SOLOFF;

Because what would bother me there is

the scope of what is **0

Yes, but if there is a blank waiver set in it

covering only things having to do with his contracts with the
state.
MISS SOLOFF:

My reaction to that would be that we

have to have involved here a genuine investigation, an on-going
investigation into specific transactions and contracts being
had with the state, and should that come to pass, then the
contractor is requested either to waive immunity or to forego,

IS
to cancel the special relationship that ha has with the ste
for a period of five years.
Q

So this is a — the state is really taking a

less severe approach than perhaps it could, it doesn't insist
on a waiver but it might.

It says really we don’t insist that

you waive in advance and appear before the grand jury and have
your statements used against you, you can choose not to have
your statements used against you at a later date f but the cost
to you is you can’t do any more business with us for a while.
MISS SOLOFF:

But you can choose at a time when you

haven't committed materials, you haven’t committed your firm,
you haven’t committed yourself to a course of action involving
that contract.

At the time you make that choice, you are still

a free agent, you haven51 obligated yourself in any way, you
haven’t gone out and hired people to build the stadium, you
haven’t brought in subcontractors, you haven’t done a number of
things which would increase perhaps the pressure to sign a
waiver.

What you have done is, you have said I really want

..that contract, I will be open and honest, there is no problem
whatsoever, 1 will sign.

And then at the time when the pro­

vision is sought to be enforced, when there is a real problem,
you say no, you balk.

Arid the consequences, not specific

enforcement of a waiver of immunity, but tha promise has been
broken and the business relationship is severed, just as the
original understanding provided.

But he did not testify and he

17
did not waive immunity.
Q

Are you putting this in the same category as

the contractor that used HO percent of the cement instead of
81 percent?
MISS SOLOFF:
0

I’m sorry# Mr. Justice Marshall,

The contractor uses 81 percent of the cement

instead of 85 percent of the cement# so he is punished for it.
Isn’t that true?
MISS SOLOFF:
0

t don’t know —

Wall# in this stadium# if he has got maybe —

if he doesn't live up to the specifications that he agrees to
build the stadium# he is punished by the state court.
MISS SOLOFF:
Q

He has broken the contract.

So yon put this in the same category.

MISS SOLOFF:

No# 'X think this goes to a different

thing and 1b —
0

Like what?

You said that he breaks the contract#

ha knows all he is doing and he makes fchs contract and then he
breaks it and therefore he severs.

X think there is a differ­

ence .
MISS SOLOFF:

The difference lies in the scope of

the public interest that you are protecting hare.

You are

investigating in this situation criminal violations as x*all as
break of contract.

The real crust of the matter X think is

coming down to why do we want a waiver of immunity# why not

IB
grant immunity and get the candor that we ©re seeking.

And 1

think that the answer to that comes down, to the fact that it i s
not really that we are seeking to prosecute so mush as the
state, when it undertakes an investigation like this, is not
willing at the outsat to give up the possibility of prosecu­
tion because. not enough is known about what is involved in the
investigation.

Immunity is not something lightly given or

easily given, and it should not be, where here you have what I
think the courts have acknowledged to b® a higher obligation on
the part of a contractor than on the part of an ordinary
citisen.
•

This willingness, this prestated willingness to give

<

information without the possibility of immunity is a part of
that higher obligation, otherwise you very much return to — if
you give immunity, then you are placing the contractor in the
position of the ordinary citisan.
Q

Miss Soloff, is there any legislative history on

this stats legislation indicating the kinds of evils to which
you have addressed?

Is it bribing public officials to award

contracts, or is it substandard performance by contractors, or
both•or something else?
KISS SOLOFF:

It is basically corruption, problems

involving corruption, Mr. Justice Stewart.

In our brief, at

page 9 essentially, there is a statement by Governor Rockefeller
stating what the legislation grew out of, and it was the
problems that grand juries were having in getting information

13
relating to public contracts.
Q

And the Governor said —

It doesn't really explain very ranch.

MISS SOLOFF:

There is another statement in the sarm

volume which I did not set out in the brief dealing more
specifically with the fact that in the Lain© case, United
States ex rei, Laino v. Warden, which is cited in our brief,
there la a reference to the memorandum respecting th® fact
that the grand jury was having a lot of trouble getting informa­
tion about public contractors,

Q

Really it says there it would be appropriate to

pass this legislation,
MISS SOLOFF:

Yes,

In the Laino case, as 1 said,

Mr, Justice Stewart, there is I believe a quotation, a further
quotation dealing with the fact that what is at issue is the
fact that grand juries simply have bean blocked in getting
information.
Q

So in the Gardner case you remember that language

undertook to distinguish between the refusal to sign a waiver
of immunity and the refusal to answer very specific questions
relating to the performance of duties or contracts.

Would the

State of New York in your view not have adequate protection if
this architect were called before the grand jury, asked the
specific questions which the Gardner case purported to save,
if that is still good law?
MISS SOLOFF;

That is not really -— well, it is not

20
so easy to call .somebody before the grand jury in New York or
any place els®, Mr» Justice Burger.

What happens — what

happened, the state of the law of immunity at the time this case
arose, it was forbidden to call a target of an investigation or
a potential target of an investigation before a grand jury.
somehow — without a waiver of immunity

I£

if somehow he were

called, he received automatic use immunity.
0

This is under New York law?

MISS SQLOFF:

This is under former New York law.

This was New York law at the time that this case arose.

Should

he testify and claim the privilege against self-incrimination,
question by question, as New York law then required, he would
receive transactional immunity.

That is, without calling

he

could not be put into the grand jury either without a waiver of
immunity or without immunity itself.

Today the law is somewhat

changed, although the impact is no different.

Today New York

gives automatic transactional immunity, and it has abandoned
the target rule.

That is, it gives automatic immunity before

the grand jury.
0

To whom?

MISS SOLOPF:

To any witness called before the grand

jury.
Q

Any witness called before the grand jury?

MISS SOLOFFx
0

I believe so.

Sven, though ha doesn't even claim the privilege?

21

MISS SOLO'S')?i

That’s right, h® no longer need claim

che privilege in *tew York under the new criminal procedure X: •
0

That is extraordinary.

0

Does that affect the importance of this ce«e

then?

MISS SOLOFF:

Wall«. the waiver «— the question ~~

fchere is a serious question of the scope of immunity being
sought in this case*

It was not explored by the District Court.

Abstention was not raised m an argument*

But the statuter of

course/ spelts u&ont waiving immunity with respect to .any
transactions had with the state,

it would be possible, of

course, to waive transactional immunity which would occur in
being celled before the grand jury, or which could under the
time that this contract was entered into?, could have been
claimed.

It is possible to waive transactional Immunity and

still obtain use immunity„ if that .13 not waived.

We all know

what New York would do with a case like this at this point.
There is a case in the New York court of Appeals

called People v. Avantwhich has been pending decision now for
«'O’-^

tim-o

That is cited in our brief*

The third department

in the State of New York rejected a contractor claim basically,
on the sort of argument which va are presenting today/ on. the
public interest involved and the fact that the contractor is
essentially changing his mind.

That case la still pending

before the New York Court of Appeals.

There is —

22
q

Wall; that will tum on Now York law# won11 it?

HISS SOXtOFP:

Xt may or it may tarsi on this c&ae*

depending on which is decided first.
0

Why wouldn't New York be satisfied with a rule

that said that surely the state may question a contractor about
his performance of a contract and vindicate its own interest in
either terminating the contract or finding out what is going on#
but that his answers may not be «sod against him in a criminal
prosecution?

MISS SQWPFt

Because fch© contractor does have# as X

said, this higher obligation that — corruption cases are very
difficult to prove without personally front a principal —
0

So you are asserting that you want to be free te

as*,hi* answer» In the criminal prosecution?
MISS SOSfOFF:

If it comes to that,

What we ares really

saying is we don’t know when wa question him whether or not we
are going to want to conduct a criminal prosecution# and that ws.
don’t want to give it away at this stage# we don’t want to be
placed in the position of having granted immunity to a principal
figure•in a very serious

Q

case *

Yes# but you also said that certain New York

law is such that even if he waived immunity? you might still not
fa© able to use his answers against him in a criminal prosecution.

MISS SOX.OFF:

Q

If ha waives immunity -- ■

Thin would cover both use# would it?

WX.SS SOLOFF:

It is a question which 1 cannot answer

because I don’t know what the How York courts would, say.

And

if I may point out one farther thing in connection with that
question, the Hew York Court of Appeals decision in Gardner
v. Broderick, which was reversed by this Court, specifically
said

if was © post-Garrifcy case, and it specifically «aid

the waiver of immunity in this case affar Garrity means that
the evidence cannot be used in & criminal prosecution.
Court

Yhis

nevertheless held that that evidence was being sought

for criminal prosecution, and X really don’t know whether
Gardner in the Haw York Court of Appeals is still the law of
Hew York,
Q

Well, this Court held in Gardn©- that he was

being penalised for asserting a constitutional right,
for refusing to waive immunity.
MISS SOIjCFF:

That is 'what Gardner held.

Yes, but there was also the additional

statement.
0

1 did not join in the opinion so I may not b© an

authority as to what it hold.
Q

Miss Soloff, deos Haw York have any statutory

authority for interrogating contractors under oath about the
performance of their contracts other than the grand jury?
MISS SOIiOFF;

i'his very statute refers also to heads

of state agencies, heads of city agencies, and other, any
agency which is? empowered to -swear witnesses and to ~~ to

2i
subpoena and to swear witnesses.

So there are other agencies.

They do not give automatic transactional immunity, they are
still under the old procedure.

You are not satisfied with utilizing that device

and being able.to question the contractor about the performance
of his contract with the understanding that those answers wsu.lt'
not be used in a criminal prosecution, you are not satisfied
with that?

you want to be able to use those answers perhaps?

You are not trying to uphold the validity of the

Mr. Robinson.

RICHARD 0. ROBISSO», ESQ.,

OH BEHALF OF APPELLEES
m> ROBINSON:

C>

May it pleas* the Court —

Mr. Robinson, while the subject is fresh in your

■mind, as I am sure it is, from listening to the colloquy, I
wonder, it you would suggest what difference thero is .between
that provision in the Gardner opinion of this Court, which the
subject was all right to penalise policeman or someone els© for
exercising his constitutional privilege under the Fifth Amendavast, but it wasn’t all right, it wasn’t constitutional to
require someone who waived that in advance.
MR. ROBIKSQN;
tion.

Your Honor, I cannot find any distinc­

In fact, if anything, 1 think in the Gardner case, the

statute in th© proceeding which was involved was more restric­
tive and mors related to the specific employment of the police
officer.

Mow, that section 1123 stated at that time, if any

councilman or other officer or employe® of the city shall, after
lawful notice of process, willfully refuse to appear before any
court or judge or any legislative committee or body

authorised

to conduct such hearing or inquiry, or having appeared» shall
refuse to testify or answer any questions regarding th® property,
government cr affairs of the city or of any county included
within its territorial limits — so that in Gardner the law was

26
mor® restrictive and more limited than it is undor section
103-a and ~b, of the general municipal lav, section 2601.
Q

1 understand on® paragraph in the Gardner case

in which the court said that the appellant, the policeman had

refused to answer questions specifically directed narrowly
relating to the performance of his official duties without
being required to waive immunity in advance, then the privilege
against self-incrimination would not have boon a bar to his
dismissal,

But still if that is the law and not just a view

of a collateral question, it would moan that, the policeman is
penalised for exercising Ms constitutional right, isn't it?
MS. jRGBINSOS:

There is no argument with that, Your

Sonor
Q
xvsmmlty *"

It says "without being required to waiv© his
of course, if he was granted immunity# than of

course he could be asked say questions, a policeman or a
bricklayer or a judge or anybody else, if he has been granted
immunity, than he haa no more constitutional privilege.
Q

tladar this paragraph, as still the law, fee can

still b® penalised by being fired# however,

X am simply saying

that there are two different kinds of penalties# on© of which
the court said is all right to direct against the policeman,
and the other is not.

prosecution© for the conduct or whatever happens# but in the
other cs.se he cm he Sized from his job,, so that there are just.
two different hinds of penalties directed at the sente exercise
of a similar constitutional privilege,
HR, ROBINSON:

Yea,

isn't that true?

And as 2 started to say, X

assume that to be the gist of the concurring opinion of Mr,
Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Stewart in the Gardner case.
They had dissented in the Spev&k and the Garrity cases,, and
then —'

Q

We seised on this paragraph for whatever it was

worth.
MR. ROBINSON:

They seised on it end it may have in

effect'overruled Spev&k in the process.

But the Court also

states that that was not necessarily in a criminal proceeding.

1 would like to point out to the* Court that in this particular
cm<%, a grand jury had been empaneled and the two architect©
here were presented with waivers of immunity which stated that

"I have b2.au advised by District Attorney John J. Honan that,
the Grand Jury of the County of Erie, now in session, is in­
vestigating charges of Conspiracy,..Bribery..«Larceny*..and
other matters of ©very nature whatsoever appertaining thereto.
2 am further advised that such charge and investigation may
involve me,"

So that they were directly there made targets of

the investigation.

28
1' should like to point out in regard to the previous
remarks made in the argument that the law of the State of t?ew
York at the tins» of these proceedings was stated in People v.
Steutllng ~~ it is not cited in the brief, it is s-t-e-u-d-i-n-g
•— at 6 New York 2d 214, where the Court of Appeals held that
by virtue of the Constitution of the State of New York, a
prospective defendant or one who was a target of an investiga­
tion might not be called or examined before a grand jury,, and
if he was his constitutionally conferred privilege against
self-inoriraination was deapted violated even though he did not
claim or assort the privilege.

Now, that was incorporated in

Article 50 of the criminal procedure law.
Sc at the time this proceeding arose the targets,
the architects, the appellees hera, were presented with a
waiver directing them to give up all constitutional rights
which they had at the time' and compelling them, attempting to
compel thorn to testify against themselves obviously in a

HR. ROBINSON:

HR. ROBINSONt

Q

First of all* You;; Honor* be made no

There was no such agreement.
Well, he signed the contract with the state*

and the state law said that if you do that* there are certain

consequences.
HR. ROBINSON:

The stats law says that every con­

every contrast ©hall be deemed to contain such a provision,
whether or not it is written into it.

There is nothing in any

Q

Well, let's don’t be technical.

For purposes

of this question, let’s assume that it had the provision in it
that said precisely what the law says.
MR. ROBINSON:

The argument of the —

And the reason is?

MR. ROBIMSOK:

The argument of the appellees is" that

this statute is overbroad.

We don't argue that the government

might have less rights than any ordinary employer to inquire
into the conditions of the contract, to inquire*into relevantmatters concerning the contract,

what we argue hers is- that

this gc<b& well beyond that and in effect permits the government
to employ its full powers of subpoena and repgressien to
inquire into matters not necessarily related to the contract.
0

I thought overbreadth was a doctrine in the

First Amendment: area,

is your client asserting soma sort of

First Amendment right here?
MR. ROBIMSON:

*i

It is usually asserted in the First

Amendment area, however, I think In the last tana in the css®
of Brooks v, Tennessee it was asserted —* X be.15.eve that was
under the

that was in the Fifth Amendment area,

that was an overbreadth case.

X believe

I believe also that the recent

decision concerning the rights of aliens to public employment
would be in the overbraafith area.

That is, there has to be

31
some reasonable relationship of a limiting statute, a. govern­
ment statuta limiting constitutional rights.
0

You mean a narrowly drawn statute which required

a waiter in advance of your rights or waiver of your •*- of
whatever it is you object to here; a narrowly drawn one, you
wouldn’t see any problem with in terms of the contractor?
MR. ROBIKSON:

Well, I would sea a problem with it,

but I do not believe it is ein .issue in this case..
not an issue in this case.

Xi*s simply

The issue in this case was very

clearly stated by the lower court in that the statute goes well
beyond limiting the limitations under constitutional rights? to
narrowly confined areas concerning the employment.
Q

Sad even if the questions that the state wanted

to ask in this case were the right kinds of questions, the
statute might authorise other kinds of questions and therefore
was invalid on its face?
MR. ROBXNSOH:

Q

Xs that your argument?

MR. ROBINSON:

Q

That is' absolutely correct.

That is our position,

That really is & straight overbreadth argument?

MR. ROB IK SCSI:

That is absolutely correct.

And 1'

believe that that is the gist of the Gardner and Uniformed
Sanitation Men's cases, that the statutes

went above aM

beyond narrowly confined limitations relating to the employ­
ment

32
The only other issue presented in this —
Q

My understanding indicated what is the differsne

between penalising the man after the event and the threat of
criminal prosecution.

What is the constitutional distinction?

f am well aware that one is a civil economic remedy, dismissal
from employment, and the ether is exposure to criminal prosecu •
tion.

But they are both coercive in terms of the exercise of

a constitutional right., are they not?

MR, ROBINSON j

Your Honor, I cannot distinguish be­

tween a prior restriction and a restriction imposed subsequent
to the commencement of a contract.
0

In other words, you would think what the court

said in Gardner was probably doubtful —

MR, ROBINSON:
0

— doubtful constitutional law?

MR. ROBINSON:
Q

Yes.

Yes.

Well, that clears it up.

MR, ROBINSON:

The only other point raised was the

quantitative and qualitative one as to whether the threat of
lose of contracting privileges by a public contractor is some­
how less of a penalty than a direct employee of the government,
all 1 can say is in that, as 1 pointed out in ray brief, X can
sea no qualitative or quantitative difference between the
firing of a laborer on a garbage truck who can go out and
secure other laboring employment in the public sector, and the

termination of a contractor, or an architect's contract -and
restriction upon hi» for five years in future contracting.
If there are no other questions, 1 thank you.
