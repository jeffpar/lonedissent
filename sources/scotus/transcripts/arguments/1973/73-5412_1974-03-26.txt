MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll hear arguments

next in Dillard against Industrial Commission, 73-5412.
Mr. Levy, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. LEVY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. LEVY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I represent the appellants.
The issue in this case is whether the procedures
in Virginia for the suspending of Workmen's Compensation
benefits meet the requirements of procedural due process.
The procedures which are in effect now in Virginia,
under Rule 13 of the Rules of the Industrial Commission,
require that an employer or a Workmen's Compensation carrier
submit to the Commission a verified application for a hearing
and whatever evidence it has as to the worker's disability or
lack of disability.
The Commission will then make an ex parte determina­
tion that probable cause exists to believe that the worker is
no longer eligible.
The lower three-judge federal court, with one judge
dissenting, held that since there was a post-suspension
hearing, which all parties agree does provide due process,
it's a judicial type hearing, that since there was this

4
hearing after the suspension, that is all that due process
required.
Appellants’ position is that notice, which is
adequate and timely, must be given to the worker, and that
he have an opportunity to present his side of the dispute.
QUESTION: And meanwhile payments continue.
MR. LEVY:

And meanwhile payments continue, yes,

sir.
QUESTION:

Until?

MR. LEVY;

Until a determination is made after a

due process hearing.
QUESTION: And if adverse to the employee at that
stage?
MR. LEW;

At that stage they may be terminated.

QUESTION: What about written participation?
MR. LEVY:

In some instances we would think that

written submission of documentary evidence would certainly
suffice.
QUESTION:

But only if he didn't ask for more?

MR. LEVY:

No.

I think —

QUESTION;

Would he have the right — would he have

the right always to an evidentiary hearing, to cross-examine
and present witnesses?
MR. LEVY:
not our position.

No.

No, I do not think

no, that is

An example would be where the insurance

5
carrier says that he can no longer be located.

Obviously,

all that would be required would be a submission in writing,
what-have-you, that in fact he can be located.

There are a

myriad of different factual situations in which it arises.
And our position is only that adequate and timely
notice must be given, and an opportunity to present his side
of the dispute.
The main plaintiffs in this suit were both injured
on their job, received Workmen's Compensation, an award of
Workmen's Compensation approved by the Commission; both had
their compensation discontinued, one for 116 days, one for
100 days, and then had it restored retroactively after the
post due process hearing was had.
QUESTION: Was there any more usual or common
ground of disctoninuance?
MR. LEVY:

I would think in the amici's brief

says that medical evidence, that the doctor who treated the
workers says he is able to go back.

This is the most usual,

I think statistically, evidence that —
QUESTION: Well, in cases like that, what kind of
hearing would you think is required?
MR. LEVY;

I think in most instances what would be

required would be the ability of the worker to submit,time
to get his own medical evidence and submit it.
QUESTION:

In writing?

Possibly —

6

MR. LEVY:

Right, a doctor's report, an evidentiary

documentary report.
Possibly there would be instances where he could -would need oral argument. There are doctors -- the most —
the example that comes to mind would be a psychiatric report,
where oral argument, I think by his counsel or even his
presence before trie decider of fact, would be essential.
QUESTION:

And who do you think should be the

decider?
MR. LEVY: Well, the decider is, under Virginia law,
the Industrial Commission or an employee of the —
QUESTION:

And there's no problem in that respect?

MR. LEW;

Ho problem in that.

QUES TION:

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION:

What's the difference in the position of

Williams and Dillard with respect to the continuing dispute
in this case? is there any?
MR. LEVY:

Mr. Dillard settled his individual claim

with Aetna, his employer's comp carrier,
taken his case all the way through.
subsequent due process hearing.

Mr. Williams has

He has been denied the

He has appealed that, and is

in an adversary situation, as opposed to his compensation
carrxer.
QUESTION:
Court of Virginia?

Where — he appealed to the Supreme

7
HR. LEVY;

Right.

Which was denied.

He has noted

or filed a petition for certiorari in this Court.
QUESTION:

Did he raise before the Supreme Court

of Virginia his due process contentions that he made before
the three-judge district court?
MR. LEVY:

No, that was not before the Supreme

Court of Virginia, since all he was appealing was a finding
by the Commission that he was no longer disabled.
It was not raised below.

And the Industrial

Commission of Virginia has considered, itself, that issue,
and, on the strength of the lower court opinion here, found
it
QUESTION;

The Commission, I gather, had a post­

termination hearing.
MR. LEVY;
QUESTION:
MR. LEVY:

At a post-termination hearing.
Which you agree provides due process.
Most definitely.

The post-termination

hearing provides due process.
QUESTION:

And that was before the Virginia

Supreme Court in his case?
MR. LEVY:

No —

QUESTION: The appeal from its determination, adverse
to him?
MR. LEVY;

Correct.

Mr. Williams is disabled or not.

A factual question whether

8

QUESTION:

But wasn't that affirmed by the Virginia

Supreme Court?
MR. LEVY:

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

QUESTION: And what, conceivably, are your grounds
in Idle petition for certiorari here from that affirmance?
MR. LEVY:

That there was no evidence before the

court — before the Commission, to hold that his evidence,
that his disability had ended, and therefore it denied him
due process.
QUESTION:

So it's a sufficiency of the evidence

point entirely?
MR. LEVY;
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
But if — even if you lose there, there's

still a live controversy here, isn't there?
MR. LEVY:

I believe that this case is not moot.

There is declaratory relief asked for, for one thing.
Second of all, this is brought as a class action to determine
such, on remand from this Court, —QUESTION:

Are you ■— aren't you arguing that even

if it were later determined that he was validly terminated,
aren't you claiming that if his initial termination wasn't
proper because of inadequate procedures, that you were entitled
to payment until proper procedures were provided?
MR. LEVY:

Yes, Your Honor.

I — my mootness, or my response to mootness --

9

QUESTION:

If you're right on that, it isn't moot.

Or then you'd have some back -- you'd have some so-called
back pay involved here.
MR. LEVY:
QUESTION:
MR. LEVY;
QUESTION:

That was not asked for in our complaint.
It wasn't?
We did not ask for damages.
Well, you didn't enjoin Travelers,

so you really couldn't join — ask for any money, could you?
MR. LEVY:
QUESTION:

Correct.
This really is a question about mootness,

isn't it?
MR. LEVY:

Your Honor, we feel that this case fits

precisely within what Mr. Justice Blackmun spoke of in
Roe v. Wade.

It is capable of repetition yet evading

review.
The case would always moot out, as the facts show,
v/ithin one month or two a year, or maybe eight months.

A

hearing will be held, a due process hearing will be held.
QUESTION;

But here if you enjoin Travelers and

preserve the claim for money judgment, it wouldn't have
mooted out.
MR. LEVY:

That would have been a possibility.

Our question is whether any injured worker cannot be mooted
out by having his insurance company resist and withdraw,
pay him off, moot him out.

And this is specifically the

10

type of case which will evade review forever.

If — when a

valid class representative goes his ~ has his procedure done
has his welfare benefits or her pregnancy terminated, there
can be no live, in the sense that I think this Court was
talking about in the case before us, a live plaintiff.
QUESTION; But that was true in Burns vs, Indiana
Employment Se curity Commis sion, too, wasn’t it, that was
decided last year?
QUESTION:
MR. LEVY;
QUESTION;
MR. LEVY;

Berney.
Barney?
Berney, yes.
The distinguishing factor in Berney,

and I do not know whether this is what the Court meant in
Berney, was here there are —■ there was an intervention of a
new member of the class, Mr. Williams, after this Court
remanded back to the lower court, the three-judge court, they
made a finding that it’s a proper class, allowed intervention
Nox*, I think arguably, the intervenor is in the
same position as the original named appellant was.
But if this Court holds that this case is moot on
those facts, I think it will be flying in the face of an
opinion which was just rendered, I think in January, American
Pipe and Construction Company, dealing with class actions and
the statute of limitations.

Where the Court said that a

federal class action is truly a representative suit, designed

11
to protect against unnecessary motions for intervention and
joinder.
What counsel, any counsel bringing a class action,
a civil rights, a (b)(2), Rule 23 (b)(2) class action would
have to do if this case is moot would be to file endless
motions to intervene other members of the class, and hope that
by the time the case reached the highest level, appellate
level, it would, there would still be someone who is "alive"'.
QUESTION:

Now, will you say again why it is that

these cases disappear in the course of litigation?
MR. LEVY:

Because a hearing is held —

QUESTION:

That is, a post™termination —

MR. LEVY:

Post™ terminati on hearing.

QUESTION:

You mean the time limits within which

that must be held are so short, -MR. LEVY:
QUESTION:

Is so short —
-— that inevitably it will have been

concluded before the case can get to us?
MR. LEVY:
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Correct, Your Honor.
I see.
Well, I'm not sure about that.

At

the hearing his claim has either to be sustained or not;
if it's sustained he's going to get retroactive benefits —
MR. LEVY:
QUESTION:

Correct.
— for the entire period.

If it's

12
terminated — if he’s

if his claim is rejected, then it

isn’t going to disappear if somebody has preserved the claim
against the insurance company that meanwhile

that meanwhile,

pending a due process hearing, he's entitled to payments.
Because they weren't terminated with due process.
MR. LEW:

I would have to agree that that would be

one solution to this problem.
QUESTION:

Well, the issue doesn't just wash out,

anybody in some subsequent case who claims against the
insurance company for interim benefits, where they've been
ta.rminated without due process, as you claim, could preserve
his claim.
MR* LEW:

Correct.

They could preserve the claim

by asking for monetary damages.
QUESTION:

That's right.

MR. LEW:

Correct.

The issue of due process would

have been — would be moot, and wouldn't -QUESTION;

Oh, no, it wouldn't be moot, because he

wouldn't — if he obtained

if this present procedure

complied with due process, he couldn't get his interim
payments.
MR. LEW;

Correct.

Appellants' position is that, I think it is beyond
argument that Workmen's Compensation benefits are property
under a long line of cases that this Court has decided, I

13
Board of Regents v. Roth gives the best definition.
And that once this is found, that it is property
within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, that whatever
process is due has to precede the deprivation.
The fatal defects in Virginia's system is that there
is absolutely no notice required of — required to be given
to the injured worker.

The first notice that he will

probably get is going to his mailbox, expecting his weekly
Workmen’s Compensation check and find that it’s not there.
Or he will get a copy of a letter to the Commission saying
that it wants a hearing.
QUESTION;

Does each employee in Virginia enter

into some kind of an agreement when he goes to xtfork, covering
his Workmen’s Compensation?
MR. LEVY;

under the statute in Virginia, every

contract of employment, the whole Workmen's Compensation
system is read into every contract of employment.

There is

no — well, I do not think employers require an employee to
sign their master —
QUESTION; So that the worker’s contract is with the
employer.
MR. LEVY:

For employment, correct.

QUESTION; And he's the one who has the obligations
imposed by the Workmen's Compensation system.
MR.LEVY;

Yes, sir

14
QUESTION! So it's really the employer that owes —
it’s the employer who really owes the payments.
MR. LEVYs

The statutes of Virginia provide for two

ways to fulfill the duty.

The duty is primarily on the

employer.
QUESTION:

Well, even if the employer gets an

insurance carrier to carry his load for him, it's — the
worker hasn't any relationship to the insurance company.
MR. LEVYs
QUESTION:

Except possibly third-party beneficiary.
Well, but his contract is with the

employer.
MR. LEVY:

But each contract of employment in

Virginia, by statute, has read into it a —
QUESTION: Well, my real question is whether this
employee, if he was denied procedural due process in
connection with termination of his benefits, has a claim
against the employer.
MR. LEVY:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Well, you didn't need to enjoin Travelers
then.
QUESTION:
MR. LEVY;

Well, did you enjoin his employer?
No, Your Honor.

QUESTION: They can opt out of this thing, can't
they, by affirmative action?
MR. LEVY:

No, the statute of Virginia, as the

15
brief for the antici, the insurance industry, pointed out that
as of January 1st,

’74, neither the employer nor the

employee can opt out.
QUESTION;
MR, LEVY;

It’s mandatory on both.
Mandatory on both.

So it used to be

that the employee could opt out.
The second defect we find is that without notice
there is no opportunity for the employee, for the injured
worked, to present his side of the case.
As was brought out earlier, the questions in
Workmen's Compensation cases can be very complex.

For

example, whether an employer, an employee has unjustifiably
refused medical treatment.
What the decider of fact, the Workmen's Corap —
the Industrial Commission of Virginia has before it in this
probable-cause procedure is merely one side's, the employer
or carrier'3 side of the evidence.
There is nothing before it, under this procedure,
as to the worker's justification for refusing a further
medical treatment.
I think what this Court said in Bell v. Burs on is
apposite in this sense.

It is a proposition which hardly

seems to need explication, that a hearing which excludes
consideration of an element essential to a decision does
not give due process.

In Bell v. Burson it was fault, in

16
taking away the driver's license.
Here, Virginia's procedure excludes, in this instance
whether the worker is justified or unjustified.
An example, cited at page 8 of appellants' reply
to amici for the industry, the case of Thompson v. United
Piece and Dye Works, the carrier had said the injured worker
was unjustifiably refusing a back operation.
When it got to the Commission and the worker was
able to submit his side, it was shown that this worker had
undergone three prior back operations, with no improvement.
And the Commission, I think, obviously found that of course
he was justified in refusing to go through another one.
Also there are questions which are, you know, able
to be determined very summarily, such as the example I gave
of whether the worker is no longer can be found.
What we are asking this Court to do, as it is done
in most of the procedural due process cases, is to set the
broad parameters of what due process requires:

notice, and

the opportunity to be heard in a meaningful manner.
As I think the Court said in Puentes, it is
peculiarly the State's function to set the procedures exactly,
balance the interest as to how much, how close to a judicial
type proceeding it should be, and this Court, though I feel
should give the broad outlines, the fundamental and basic
fairness, as the Court recently said in Groppe,

which

17
procedural due process is always required.
I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.
QUESTION:

Mr. Levy, I think there's a suggestion

somewhere in the briefs, perhaps, that if you prevail here,
employers might be less willing to commence payments and to
reach settlements at that end of the disability period.
Do you agree with that?
MR. LEW;

I would not agree with it.

expert on the insurance industry's side.

I am not

I would not thix^k

that the lack of good —- I would not posit a lack of good
faith on the insurance industry.
I think the amici's brief shows that there is 95
percent of Workmen’s Compensation benefits at all ends,
at the inception and termination, are voluntarily settled.
And I do not see any reason to believe that any, or much
greater percentage would — that this percentage would change
with a decision in this case.
QUESTION;

What are we talking about as a practical

How much delay is there between the date of

suspension and in the Virginia system, the actual post­
termination hearing?
MR. LEVY;

There is some ambiguity in the record.

What the lower court found was an average one-month delay.
The answers to interrogatories, I think, would — in -the
Appendix -— would bear a reading that there is probably more

18

delay, probably closer to three or four months.

The

interrogatories were framed in a variety of fact situations.
But the lower court found one-month delay.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Dunn.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART II. DUNN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES, INDUSTRIAL
COMMISSION OF VIRGINIA AND INDIVIDUAL
COMMISSIONERS
MR. DUNN;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I will address rnyself to the question basically of
the due process aspect of the case.

Mr. Brame, representing

Aetna, with the permission of the Court, will address himself
to the jurisdictional point, with respect to whether or not
there is a property right here and whether or not it has been
taken.
At the outset I would refer the Court to the yellow
brief of the Amici, American Insurance Association and the
American Mutual Insurance Alliance, at page 15, where there
is a factual error.
This is in the guidelines, where they set out five
guidelines, and this statement is found on line 4s
"The doctor's medical report must indicate that the

19
employee can return to work within seven days; speculation
as to the employee's condition further into the future will
not support a probable cause finding."
Apparently there is simply a lack of communication
between the amici in this case and the Industrial Commission.
The Industrial Commission tak.es the position that this is in
fact not true, there is no ability for a prospective
determination.

No doctor can say, I believe that this

employee will be able to go back to work in three or four
days, or seven days, or fifteen days, and obtain a probable
cause finding on that.
There is absolutely no prospective result.
There are other less substantial errors, but I
think this is the only one that bears comment.
QUESTIONS

In other words, the doctor’s report has

to say that he is able to go back to work now.
MR. DUNN:

Yes, sir.

Perhaps the seven days is a confusion between this
process and the process whereby an employee must be off work
more than seven days before he ever gets into being
eligible for Workmen's Compensation benefits.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. DUNN:

But that’s just speculation on my part.

s'

But, at any rate, it’s untrue.
QUESTION:

I notice that list of guidelines is

20

preceded by a sentence, "The Commission uses the following
guidelines"? and you just suggest that's not -QUESTION:
MR, DUNN:

Right,
You Honor, I ~

QUESTION: At least to that extent that's not the
case.
MR. DUNN:

That is not the case, Your Honor, with

respect to this comment, and also with respect to several
others that are not as substantial.

But this was apparently

based on communication between the amici and the Commission,
which we vie re not a party to,
I believe an important note, and what we believe is
important about this case, in that it's fairly unique.

And

it's unique for this reasons
First of all, there is the probable cause determina­
tion under Rule 13,
The second thing is with respect to the, what
amounts to a tripartite rights in property. We have the
interest, of course, of the employee, the interest of the
employer, and we have the interest of the government.
I think to understand the way that this system
actually works, one needs to look at what exactly Workmen's
Compensation is.

And if I may spend just a few moments

outlining the way the system works in Virginia.
Of course, Workmen's Compensation is basically a

21

substitute for a common law tort.

And under this procedure,

the basic changes regard the fact that the employee no longer
has a suit in tort, and therefore would not get as much money,
perhaps, in particular cases under Workmen's Comp as he would
get under common law.
On the other hand, the employer gives up certain
defenses, such as the doctrine of fellow servant, of
contributory negligence and so forth, and therefore there is
at least compensation in every case of an industrial
accident.
The system provides basically for two types of
payment;

one, a medical? the second is temporary compensation.
Now, there may in fact be permanent incapacity.

The provision in the law there will be a rating of a percentage
of capacity, and there will be payments on the basis of that.
But up until a doctor is able to rate an employee,
there will be temporary compensation. The statute provides
for payments during incapacity.

The award in the case of

Mr. Williams and of Mr. Dillard provides for payment during
incapacity.
So, then, it's to be anticipated that this payment
will not go on forever, and that in fact there are generally
three ways in which it will end, one is of course that the
employee recovers and is able to go back to work? secondly,
it is clear that he haa progressed to whatever point he's

22

going to with respect to his incapacity, and he’s rated;
or, third, he may have been permanently or partially
incapacitated for the entire statutory period of 500 weeks,
and essentially his payments will run out under that system.
•

Now, with respect to a question that Justice

Blackmun raised, this gets me really to my next point.
This is what we think is the touchstone of the system in
Virginia, and what makes it work as well as it does, and
that is the voluntariness.
As counsel for the appellants has already suggested,
roughly 95 percent of the cases are decided without any
opinion. They are handled by the employer, employee, and the
insurance company is acting in good faith.
Now, Mr. Levy has suggested in his reply brief
that — and also in response to Mr. Justice Blackmun’s
question he suggested that he would not impute any bad faith.
We submit that's not the problem.
The problem is that at the present time it is in
the insurance company's self interest and in the employer's
self interest to very promptly undertake payment to an
employee in a Workmen's Comp situation.
This is done because it is a morale factor for the
employee, the employer likes to get the employee getting
paid very soon, and in fact the Commission knows that
often payment is made to the employee prior to there even being

23

an award.
Now, this is also based on the fact that when —
if the employer finds out that there's been some sort of a
mistake, the representation of the employer turns out to be
something different from what it had been represented, it is
readily easy to terminate this.
Of course, under the present system where there's
been a change of condition, he can terminate it and set it
for a hearing.
We submit that the problem will be not simply, as
you have in Goldberg, you will have a hearing every time
somebody wants one, that's not all you'll have; you'll have
all the extra hearings from the people who want them, and
then, on top of that, you will have all the hearings that
are caused on the front end, not because of any bad faith,
but simply because it has become, in the insurance company's
and employer's economic self-interest, to look much harder
at the claim before they ever take it, to be sure that this
is a compensable claim.
QUEJ5TI0N;

Are the interests of the insurer and the

employer always identical in this situation?

Does the

employer's premium depend on his experience?
MR. DUNN;

The system in Virginia is that it is

value rated, it is value rated by industry.

For example,

all employers of bricklayers would pay a similar premium as

24

all other employers of bricklayers, but they might not pay
the same premium as metalworkers.
So that an individual company's experience will not
affect its insurance premium, but the industry's experience
will.
Now, to that extent, I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
you raise a good point, to separate the insurance company from
the self-employer, or self-insured employer.

The self-insured

employer, of course, across the street from each other, two
competitors, one having a claim and the other not, may be in
a competitive situation such that he can't absorb.
a small business.

It may be

He just simply cannot absorb it.

This, of course, wouldn't happen where there were
insurance companies, because the competitive angle is then
gone.

That is, every other bricklayer has got to pay the same

premium, if they're inflated, as this bricklayer does.
QUESTION; Well, then, I should think in that
situation, particularly a small employer might not have an
identical interest with the insurer.

He might have an

interest in obtaining compensation for an employee, perhaps
even when the literal provisions of the law weren't complied
with, if it isn't going to affect his premium.
MR. DUNN:

He would not, but his carrier, of course,

would have a legitimate interest in it.

And the employer

had the interest to the extent that he would not want his

25

premium to go up, which it necessarily would as a result of
this system.

It would be quite easy for any employee simply

to say no, when asked if his change of condition had occurred,
and asked for the hearing.
I might further respond, as far as the time limit
is concerned, I don't think in fact that the interrogatories
reflect what the time limit is, I think it's interrogatory
No. 14 is the answer to the question about what is the time
limit for change of condition hearings; that is, what is the
delay between the request for the hearing and the time of
the hearing.

And the answer is to refer back to answer 6,

and answer 6 refers to the interrogatory to the fact that
these records are simply not available in that form, and they
could come to the office.
So what we end up with is simply no statistics in
the record to show what the delay is.

The Commission was

unable to obtain them without going through all of its files.
There are some other statistics with respect to the
one month and the one to three months, and I might say, based
on my own knowledge, having been advised by my client, that
these are probably in the better part, for these types of
hearings as well; but they are not, there are no statistics
in the record as such.
The important thing, we think, from the point of
view of the voluntariness, with respect to the increased

26
litigation, which the Commission expects to occur, is the
fact that this is not in the employee's best interest»

The

Commission, in a sense, is biased toward the employee.

That's

really its raison d'etre, that's what it's there for.

The

rules in the statute make it very clear, it's very liberal
for the employee.
employee.

Hearsay evidence can be presented by the

All sorts of loosening of normal judicial

constraints are there.
And the Commission believes it will not be in the
employee's best interest in the sense that the employee,
for example, often will have returned to work by the time he
will have ever gotten his hearing, if the insurance company
denies that they have a claim.
Often these actions don't incapacitate the employee
for more than several weeks or several months, and he's likely
to be back at work.

If he of course has been living on his

income and has no savings, he's not going to be able to get
to that.
The very argument which the appellants make for
having the benefits continue comes back on the front end, to
shov; that it's a very good reason for not having it work that
way.
Now, as far as, again, the employer’s or insurance
company's ability to abuse this process, one can't lose sight
of the fact that there is a probable cause determination.

27

By a disinterested, perhaps even biased toward the employee,
party.
And another important thing to note is with respect
to this case is that all the actions which took place with
respect to these two appellants took place prior to amended
Rule 13.
That is, under old Rule 13 there was no probable
cause finding.

The Commission simply, in a ministerial

fashion, received applications for hearings and set them,
without making any finding with respect to the probable
cause of the determination.
For example, in the case of Mr. Dillard, the
letter fairly read from Dr. Sibley indicates that Mr.
Dillard was predicted to be able to go back to work in a
couple of weeks.

Under present procedures there would have

been no probable cause finding in this respect.
Mr. Levy for the appellants suggests in his brief
that there is no reason to think that the employee will not
go back to work when he's able, because it's riot in his
economic self-interest to do so.
I think the statistics show that this is apparently
not a reasonable conclusion.
First of all, his 66 and two-thirds percent is
very close to — being taxfree, is very close to a situation
for a person who is not earning more than the maximum anyway,

28

of what he's taking horae.
Further, the statistics would show that indeed a
great number of these employees do ask for hearings, and in
our footnote 8 in our brief, we set out for the Court what
was a representative sample of a six-month period, not all
of the hearings in a six-month period, but a representative
sample, in which over 91 percent of the claims in which
probable cause had been found were affirmed by the Court.
Excuse me, by the Commission.
This would suggest that there are a great number of
employees who, although able to return to work, at least as
found by the Commission, are willing to ask for these hearings.
I would like to very briefly highlight a couple of
very important protections for the employee under this case,
first of all is the probable cause determination, as I've
already mentioned, secondly, as we've said in our brief, is
the fact that the employee himself is able to choose a doctor
from a panel of three selected by the employer; and, in fact,
the Commission is very liberal in permitting the employee to
have another doctor, if he wishes one, as was done both in
the case of Mr. Dillard and Mr, Williams.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dunn.

MR» DUNN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

In some States, I believe the Commission

not only administers the system but also has its own insurance

29

program, so that in effect the Commissioners can wear two
hats when they're making a decision as to compensation.
Now, does Virginia have a State insurance fund which covers
some employers, or is it all privately insured?
MR. DUNN;

It's all privately insured.

QUESTION; So all the Commission does, basically, is
find facts, they don’t act as actuarial managers of an
insurance fund,
MR. DUNN;

No, they do not.

As a matter of fact,

and this was one of the points I was going to get to, they
cannot even enforce their own decrees.
Section 65.1-100 of the Virginia Code provides for
enforcement of these decrees in a court of record, so that
the Commission cannot require an employer to pay.

The only

ability it has in this respect is that under Rule 13 he
could refuse to grant a hearing to an employer who had not
complied with the constraint to that rule.

That is, had not

paid up to the time that the probable cause determination was
made.
But it does not control the funds, it cannot order
the employer to pay; it can only — if he refuses to pay an
initial award, for example, they could assess attorney fees
when it got to hearing, but it cannot essentially make the
judgment good for the employee.

It has no ability to do this.

And this is the important factor, that these funds

30

are private funds, they're not controlled by the Commission
and every dollar that's taken from the employer or his
insurance company and given to the employee is a dollar that
he doesn't have any more for the private purposes.
I would like to mention one more point, with
respect to the protection for the employee, and that's this
question of notice.

I would note to the Court that both

parties received notice.

Mr. Levy has suggested that often

the employee only finds out that his payment has been cut
when he goes to the mailbox and it's not there.
There's absolutely no evidence in this record to
suggest that anybody finds it in that way.

All the evidence

that we have is that both of these employees did receive
notice.

Mr. Dillard, it is noted at the bottom of his

is made?

QUESTION:

You mean it may be sometime before the

final decision?
MR. DUNN:

Yes.

Just as the Court does.

QUESTION:

I see.

MR. DUNN:

Obviously it depends, to an extent, on

the complexities of the matter before the Commission.
QUESTION:

Those decisions, are they written in

form?
MR. DUNN: They are.

For example, the opinions

with respect to Mr. Dillard are in this record.
We submit to the Court that the appellants, on
the basis of a number of rather speculative assumptions
about what the Commission is doing now under Rule 13,
recognizing that we have no evidence on the operation of
amended Rule 13, because the case was actually decided only
a couple of months after it came into effect, that on the
basis of these speculative assumptions, for which there is
no evidence, asking the Court to conclude that these laws
are ineffective in Virginia? and by presenting their argument
for a hearing in a vacuum, they ignore the substantial effect
which this is going to have on the entire system.
Itfe submit that the appellants are asking this Court
to dismantle a carefully structured system by balancing —
which balances very many interests and very many factors, and
we respectfully request that this Court decline to do so.

32

QUESTION: Well, do I gather from your last remark
that if this case is reversed, that Virginia will have to
revise its system substantially?
MR. DUNN:

The gravamen of my remark was toward

the effect which it would have upon the operation in the
system.

If Your Honor is asking the question, would there

have to be a change in State lav; in order to permit this.
Is that your question?
QUESTION: Well, I just wondered if you’re going to
have an entirely new world in which to live.
MR. DUNN: Well, I think it’s difficult to determine,
because under the brief the argument seemed to be by the
appellants that they were entitled to a Goldberg hearing.
Nov; here today before this Court they suggest that
there are a whole myriad of types of due process that might
be available in any particular case.
We thought we were arguing about a Goldberg type
hearing.

And that is the way we've argued this case all

along.
Nov?, under that assumption, we think it x^ould be a
serious disruption of the entire system, for the reasons that
we stated, with regard to increased litigation and so forth.
I don't mean to suggest that there's going to be a
wholesale change of legislation, necessarily, which would
require this; simply that the system will not function as it

33
has, and we think to the detriment of the employee.
QUESTION: Well, when you speak of a Goldberg type
hearing, are you suggesting that the hearing officer who could
consider the matter in the Goldberg case would be more
objective, more neutral than the Commission hearing?
MR. DUNN:
QUESTION:

Depending on the —
Or were you addressing yourself to the

content of the hearing?
MR. DUNN:

I was addressing myself to the procedures,

that is, cross-examination, presentation of evidence, et
cetera.
QUESTION:

I see.

Very well, Mr. Dunn.
MR. DUNN:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Brame.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. ROBERT BRAME, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE AETNA CASUALTY AND
SURETY COMPANY
MR. BRAME:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I think the argument before this Court already
indicates the reason that we ask the Court to grant us the
right to argue, to split the appellees' argument.
You've heard about the interest of the employee,
and you've heard about the interest of the State.

But our

34
position here is that the interest that has been forgotten
is the interest of the employer.
This Court has long held that the Fourteenth
Amendment is a shield which protects the liberties and
properties of our citizens.
What tiie appellants today ask is that this shield
be converted into a sword, and that this sword be used to
deprive the employers of their property without due process
of law.
Appellants ask this Court to weigh the private
competing interest of the employer on one hand, and the
employee on the other, and upon finding that the employee's
need is greater, to order that trie employer yield up his
funds to an employee for whom you've had an independent
finding of probable cause that the employee is not entitled
to these funds.
And after the employer has established his defense,
plus the fact that under Virginia law all funds that are paid
to an employee, whether under mistake or whatever, by an
employer under the Workmen's Compensation system, can never be
recouped.
funds.

There's no right of an employer to recoup any

But yet if the employee's suspension is later found to

be erroneous, then the employee must, is immediately paid
up to date.
QUESTION:

Hr. Brame, as I read appellants' brief,

35
they agree that Virginia could change the law if this thing
were reversed, and permit recoupment,
MR. BRAME:

They could permit recoupment.

I think

probably the answer — and this gets again to the State's
argument, the delicate balance here that the State has struck.
And they have weighed it against the employers, because I
think they found — the State found it was not in the State's
interest to have the employers pursuing persons who have just
come off of Workmen's Compensation.
This is, I think, an indication of the State's
concern for the well-being of the employees.

It's

something that we employers have to live with.
But to date it hasn't become excessive.

I think if

it does, we may be in this Court on the other side of the case.
QUESTION:

Has there ever been any attack on the

Virginia statute on the grounds that it's a denial of due
process?

The irrebutable presumption, in effect, about the

recoupment?
MR. BRAME:
show.

No, Your Honor, not that the annotations

It's not a presumption, it just says — well, it may

be helpful to explain this, because I don't think the Court
— it hasn't been explained to the Court exactly how this
system operates.
In Virginia, if there's an accident that appears
to be a compensable accident, the disability has to run more

i

36

than seven days, or there has to he medical expenditures.
The employer and the employee in 95 percent of the cases enter
into a stipulation, and it is then entered by the Commission
as an order.

The order states that the employer shall pay

specified benefits during incapacity.
By statute this order continues until it is
amended or altered by the Commission after a full due process
hearing.
Any amounts paid thereunder are not recouped by
the employer.
What the Rule 13 that you've heard about is is a
procedural addition or enhancement of the employee's rights.
As was stated earlier, these Commission awards are not
enforcible by the Commission, they must be enforced in a
court of record.
So if the employer or the insurance carrier didn't
pay, you'd have to go into court and sue.
The Industrial Commission, in the Thirties, created
Rule 13, which says in effect:

The only way an employer

can alter this award is to come to us for a hearing.

But

we're not going to receive an application for a hearing
until you've paid that employee up until the date of the
application.
And in subsequent amendments it said, we're not
even going to give you a hearing until you have given us

37
evidence which shows probable cause to believe that there’s
been a change in condition.
What they have done, what the Commission has done,
is to limit the employer's right to the due process hearing.
And a byproduct of this has been to give the employee some
additional claims to funds without having to go to a court.
And what they are claiming as their property right is this
future extension, which they've never had.
And the Roth case, I think recognises that it's
sort of a unilateral wish, but it's nothing that's found in
the State statute that you can really claim as property
rights.
A couple of corrections on the error in the record.
Coverage does not extend to all employers and all employees
in the State.

By statute it's mandatory for employers of

three or more employees.

Employers with small numbers can

come under the Act, but they do so voluntarily.

Coverage,

thus, is not mandatory.
And, furthermore, the contract does issue to the
employee.

He doesn't get a written copy, but the Virginia

Code, Section 65.1-111 says in effect that the employee shall
be allowed to bring an action in his own name against the
insurance company on the contract.
The real question I think is the property that the
employer is going to lose.

You've got a system where the

38

employer’s natural interest is to suspend payment,.

Now, the

fact that he suspends payment after this initial hearing
doesn’t mean that the employee cannot go into the court and
enforce it, because he can.
He can always go into court and enforce it, even
after the Commission found probable cause to believe that
there is a change in condition.
QUESTION!

That doesn't meet the time problem

that was involved, for example, in Goldberg, does it?
MR. BRAME: Well, Your Honor, if you read Goldberg
together with Roth, I think it does.

The right that they

have got, the enforcible right, is in this award.

And this

award must be enforced in a court of record.
And even after the employer has gotten a hearing,
until that order issues out of the Commission at some later
date, that award continues to be in force.

And he gets —

it can be sued on, and get judgment, almost a confession of
judgment, even up until the day the Commission decides —
rescinds that order, amends that order.
Go he still has the enforcible right in court.
What he's asking for is some sort of decision by
the Commission to call up the employer and say, Well, we've
got a favorable decision for you that this man is not
entitled to money, but we're not going to release this
decision until you pay him up to date.

39

And that's the time situation.
point there are two competing claims

You get to the

of a contractual

nature between the employer and the employee.

Every dollar

the employer pays comes out of his pocket or his insurance
company's pocket, and they will get it back from him.
And this is — but what money he pays that's
tan justified, he can never recover from the claimant.
QUESTION;

QUESTION;

Does he know anything about it before

he's suspended?
MR. BRAME;
Honor.

It depends on the circumstances, Your

But assuming that he's not — I mean, I'm willing to

assume for the purpose of my argument that he's not, that
the employer doesn't tell the employee.

But our argument is

40

that there's no jurisdiction under 1983f because our suspensic
is pursuant to the right of a person in free society to do
that which is not by law prohibited.
The law does not prohibit us from suspending under
certain situations.
QUESTION:

That's why this case is here, to see if

you are prohibited.
MR. BRAME:

That’s right.

The case is here to

determine whether or not State inaction is State action under
1983.

And as we read .1983, it requires either a positive

State law, requiring someone to terminate, or such a degree
intertwining between the employers in the State so that the
employers’ actions are the State’s actions.
QUESTION: Supposing the Commission, as of May 15th,
finds there's probable cause to terminate, and then the
employee goes into the circuit court and seeks to recover
payments due under the award from May 15th to June 1st.
Now, can the circuit court make any independent
review of whether there was cause to terminate in that sort
of an action, or was it found by the Commission's determina­
tion of probable cause?
MR. BRAME:

It was — the Commission's decision,

determination of probable cause is completely irrelevant.
It has no relationship to the award.

The award is still

outstanding, the award has not been modified.

Hence, it’s

41
enforcible of right under section 100 or 101.
QUESTION:

You mean the employee could recover the

payment in a circuit court action?
MR. BRAME:

Yes.

And the employer, as far as we

can tell, has no real defense.

It's a system that has not

been abused, and so it hasn't been particularly attacked.
But that's our point, that he always has that right, even
after the determination of probable cause, to go into court
and to enforce the judgment on the award itself.
QUESTION:

Mr. Brame, as I understand it, it's in

90 percent or so of these cases, compensation is agreed upon
between the employer and the employee, and they never go to
the State agency, is that right?
MR. BRAHE:
Your Honor.

Well, they go to the State agency,

The 95 percent figure, I believe is the question

of initial entitlement.
QUESTION: Right.
MR, BRAME:

In any award •— well, any agreement

between the employer and the employee respecting compensation
payments after an injury must be approved by the Industrial
Commission.

The employer and the employee, if they agree to

entitlement, and it's really just a question, was it a
compensable accident, beyond seven days; sign a form, which I
believe is in the record, entitled A Memorandum of Agreement.
That Memorandum of Agreement is submitted to the

42
Industrial Commission, which, if they review it and find it
to be in satisfactory order and properly protecting the interes
of the employee, will enforce it*

Then it will issue as an

order of the Commission requiring compensation payments to be
made during incapacity.
QUESTION:

And then termination of 90 percent or

so of the cases is also by a voluntary agreement, is that
right?
MR. BRAME:
figure is that high.

I’m not sure of that figure, if the
It's very high.

It’s very, very much

an informal system, in the sense that you don’t have a lot of
play by counsel.

It works pretty much by the voluntary

system, overseen by the Industrial Commission, which
significantly favors the employee.
QUESTION: And then in those cases, in the vast
majority of cases you say they are, in which termination of
compensation is by voluntary agreement, must that agreement
then go to the Industrial Commission to be approved also?
MR. BRAME:

Yes.

If it’s not, there have been some

cases where the agreement was not approved by the Commission,
the Commission — unless they approve it and enter an order
affecting the initial award, the initial award remains
outstanding.

As in the Manchester case, which I think every­

body has cited to the Court, the award remained outstanding
perhaps a year and a half after the employee went back to work.

43
The question was, is it enforcible in these
circumstances, because of the harsh results to the employer,
and the Court held that you can only get to the Commission
through Rule 99.

The employer hadn't done it to a specified

data, and that year and a half's award, although perhaps he
wasn't entitled to it, was enforcible in a court of record.
QUESTION s

Unh-hunh.

QUESTIONi

Mr. Brame, to sum it up, an order is

entered in every case authorizing or approving the payments,
and an order must be entered in every case to terminate it.
MR. BRAME:

That's right, Your Honor.

And that

order is affected only by a hearing, which I believe everyboc
admits, is a due process hearing.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

Would you clarify for me the apparent confusion as
to whether or not notice was given in this case to the two
appellants — to appellees;
MR. BRAME:

appellants, right.

Notice was given to Mr. Dillard, Your

Honor, on the — one of the papers filed in the record shows
a carbon copy to Mr. Dillard.

That was not under Rule 13 ~

Rule 13 as it now stands has been changed. That was sort of
an old Rule 13 thing, although he did get notice on it,
nevertheless.
And-then Mr. Williams, the exhibit in Mr. Xtfilliams
case, which is Exhibit A, on page 75 of the record, also

44
shows that he gets notice.

It's not in the record, but the

Industrial Commission has a practice that if they receive an
application for a hearing on change of condition, and there
is no indication that the employee has been notified, they
have a form upon which they immediately notify the employee,
QUESTION; Well, what's the purpose of notifying the
employee if he doesn't have an opportunity to participate
in the probable cause determination?
MR. BRAME:

I'm not sure that — how to — if I can

answer that completely.

The — if the employee calls up and

submits a medical report, I think they would consider it.
They want him to know, as soon as possible, and I think
probably as a practical matter if it turns out to be a misfak
on the part of the employer, what I understand the Industrial
Commission's workings, that application is going to be with­
drawn right quickly, and things will be restored to the statu
quo.
It's sort of a —
QUESTION;

The letter which you have referred to,

at page 75, calls for the employee, if he agrees, to indicate
agreement, and I suppose in a great many of the cases, if not
a majority, the employee does agree and he indicates that in
response to this notice; is that correct?
MR. BRAME;

Your Honor, there is a fair degree of

response, I can't characterize it as a high degree or a low
&

45
degree, I think the answer is that only maybe ten percent of
these go to a hearing and eventually go to a hearing where
both parties appear.

Hearing is automatically scheduled.

An employer has the obligation of scheduling the hearing, as
this shows, the obligation of coining forward.
The number of these that go to hearing are not
substantial, so, on way or another, there’s an agreement
reached.

Sometimes it's difficult from a practical matter to

get people in that wage bracket to sign an agreement to
anything.
QUESTION: Well, in. any event, after receiving
this notice, he has the opportunity to respond to it if he
wishes to.

But if he goes back to work on the following

Monday, then there's no problem, I take it.
MR. BRAME:

Well, there’s no problem under the

situation as it now exists.

Although that award continues,

and he can go into court, presumably, and enforce it even
then, up until the hearing.

After the hearing and the order

issues, confirming that he's back at work —
QUESTION:

Yes.

The letter states that it does

not terminate the award, does it not?
MR, BRAME:

Right.

I'm not sure the letter does

or not.
QUESTION:
MRo BRAME:

Yes, it does.
l‘t does?

Well, the Court's read it a

46

little more closely than I have.
QUESTION: Do I understand you correctly that there*
nothing in the record on phase, on this one way or the other,
and you don't know of your own personal knowledge?
MR. BRAME:

Now, as to what, Your Honor?

QUESTION:

Did I get your correctly?

MR. BRAME *

As to what?

QUESTION: As to the number of these that are signec
and the number that are agreed to.
MR. BRAME:

That's right, there's nothing in the

record.
QUESTION;

Nothing in the record? and you don’t

know, either?
MR. BRAME:
QUESTION:

No.
Would you interpret that as advising an

employee that, quoting the vernacular of the street, "you've
had it"?
MR. BRAME:
QUESTION:

pending the appeal or pending the hearing.
MR. BRA!®:

Well, to prevail, he would have to

MR. BRAME:

No.

It has no relationship, Your Honoz

47
QUESTION:

Well, what do you have to show?

You just show the award and say, pay me?
QUESTION:

That hasn't been determined.

MR. BRAME:

It's in the Appendix to our brief,

which is the green brief, it’s Virginia Code Section 65.1-10Q
and all he has to do is show the Court that he's got an
award by the Commission that's outstanding and it's not
been modified.
And the amounts that haven't been paid, and he
gets an order immediately.
QUESTION: Well, why hasn't it been modified by the
itermination based on probable cause?
MR. BRAME:

The termination based on probable cause

does not — has no relationship to the award.

The award

continues until the due process hearing.
What the Commission says in that rule, we will not
let the employer even file an application for a hearing, we
won't give the employer standing to even argue a change in
conditions until he has paid the employee up to date, and
shown probable cause.
It's a device of controlling, as much as anything,
controlling the number of cases which they receive.

It's

like the old common law court requiring it to be on oath.
QUESTION:

But at any time until after the so-

called due process hearing and the final official termination

43
by the Industrial Commission, the employee can go into com"
and collect under the award?

Yes.

I can construe this section no other way.

MR. BRAMEi

In answer to the question on the —

QUESTION:

What's the lav/suit about then?

MR. BRAME:

Yes.

All right.

Your Honor, we asked the same question.

QUESTION: Well, the fact is you haven’t been —
your clients haven't been paying, the employer doesn’t pay
me anwhile ? th at's it»
MR. BRAME;
QUESTION:

That's right.
He doesn't pay it over, although he's

legally obligated to, you tell me.
MR. BRAME:
QUESTION:

That's the way we read this section.
Although the Commission has told him

not to pay —
MR. BRAME:
QUESTION:

No, no, that’s not -~
Although the Commission has said there’

probable cause to terminate.
MR. BRAME:
QUESTION:
MR. BRAME:
QUESTION:

That's right.
And he's terminated.
Right.
And he's quit paying; nevertheless, he

legally obligated to pay.
QUESTION:

If the court orders him to do so.

50

MR. BRAME:

That's right.

As this section ~

QUESTION: Well, but the award — what the court
would say is that the award has never been affected.
MR. BRAME:
QUESTION:

Right.
Namely, you've been ordered before to

pay, to live up to the award.
MR. BRAKE:
QUESTION:

Now, why haven't you done it?

At what point in time, now?
Well, the employee goes to court.

MR. BRAKE:
QUESTION:

Right.
Pending the hearing.

MR. BRAKE:
QUESTION:

Right.
And the court **- he wins in court,

the court says, Pay according to the award, it's never been
terminated.
MR. BRAME:
QUESTION:

That's right.
I assume there was a legal obligation

to pay, whether the court said so or not.
MR. BRAME:

Well, in a sense there is, in a sense

it's a contractual -QUESTION:

Well, so the employer is just ignoring

his legal duty, you suggest?
QUESTION:

By relying on the probable cause.

MR. BRAME:
contractual duty.
something else.

I almost have to

~ well, it's a

Now, whether, you know, the moral goes to
But they do have a continuing award requiring

51

them to pay and they don’t pay.
QUESTION:

Have you had a Virginia — decided

case that says that?
MR. BRAKE:

The decision on this — the best I can

find from quickly looking at the annotations, is one called
Peregrin vs. Long, 134 S.E. 562, which says that under
Section 100, which is the enforcement section, that the court’s
duties are strictly ministerial.
QUESTION:
MR. BRAME:

It can't inquire -—

Well, — excuse me; excuse ms.
It can't, inquire into the —* whether

or not the employee was actually entitled.
It goes back to what we've said.

We've got a

system that's worked well on the voluntary basis.

The

employees — the hearing is on a fairly short basis, and
there hasn't been a large number of suits of this type.
But I think the answer is that most of the terminations,
particularly under new Rule 13, are justified.

The employees

are back at work.
QUESTION: And then you told us, I think, of a case
where the court awarded compensation for a period of a year
and a half after the man had been back at work, simply
because there had been no official termination.
MR. BRAME:

That was the —

QUESTION:

Did I misunderstand it?

MR. BRAME:

That was the Manchester case, -■

QUESTION:
MR, BRAME:

The Manchester case.

I think

it's cited in everybody’s brief.

MR. BRAME:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Levy, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. LEVY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. LEVY:

I might —

QUESTION:

Tell us why you're here, Mr. Levy.

MR.LEVY:

Pardon?

QUESTION:

You tell us why you're here, if that's

of assistance.
MR. LEVY:

First of all, there has been absolutely

no litigation under Section 100, under a Rule 13 procedure.
If the employer and the employee went to court —
QUESTION:

Pending a hearing.

MR. LEVY:

— pending a hearing, once the benefits

are suspended, there has been no determination as to what the
court would do.
After the due process hearing, the court might look
at it this way;

after the due process hearing the Commission

terminates the award retroactively, therefore, there would be
nothing, it would be like going in

to enforce something

53

which there is a preliminary injunction on.
QUESTION:

Yes, but if you happen to get into court

before the hearing, and the court wasn’t very busy and heard
your case right away, do you agree that the employer would os
ordered to pay pending the hearing?
MR. LEW: The court, under that statute, the languag
of that statute, would have to enter a judgment.

Hie employee

would then have to try to collect under that judgment.

And

I would assume that there would be no —
QUESTION:

Well, can't you have a — there wouldn't

be an order to pay, or the employer would just say:
Awfully sorry, I know you've got a judgment, but I won't pay
it.
QUESTION:

In my years of practice, a judgment

against Travelers or against Aetna was always thought to be
a pretty valuable tiling.
MR. LEVY:

Where you have before you a judgment of

the Commission to pay until disability is —
QUESTION: But then you have a judgment of the
circuit court, don't you, after you go to court?
MR, LEVY:

But. still you have a judgment, and I

would assume that that court would say:

If there is a

hearing, when this hearing comes to effect, we are not
going to force Travelers to pay, since the very basis for
that decision will be terminated retroactively.

54
QUESTION:

Really, then, it's your submission that

there's an undecided question of Virginia lav/ in that case,
as to what the effect of a suit in the circuit court during
this periodcf time would be.
MR. LEVY:

Well, I think it is clear that the whole

intent of that statute could be interpreted no other v/ay.
I -QUESTION:

I suppose by the time you got your suit

filed, the time for the post-termination hearing would have
arrived, and been concluded, wouldn't it?
MR. LEVY:
QUESTION:
to the lawsuit?

That is another aspect.
Then what happens?

Then what happens

In the circuit court.

MR. LEVY:

That is an undecided question of State

law, certainly.
QUESTION:

Is that the way they do things in Virgini

[Laughter. 3
MR. LEVY:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
So it was decided, apparently, that

until there's an official termination by order of the
Industrial Commission, the award is in effect, as the
Manclies-ter case holds, doesn ’ t it?
MR. LEVY:
QUESTION:

This is prior to what the —
Giving a man compensation for a year

and a half after he’s back at work.

Simply because the award

55

had not been officially terminated.
MR. LEVY:

But there has been no litigation, first,

under the old Rule 13

,

and certainly under the new Rule 13.

And it would defy common sense for the Virginia courts to
hold that you will give a judgment and let it be collected
when that judgment is going to be, or possibly will be
retroactively terminated.
QUESTION:

Well, that — doesn’t seem to be common-

sensible, that’s what has caused all the interrogation from
the bench,
[Laughter.]
QUESTION:

Well, the Commission enters an order

that there is probable cause to suspend.
MR, LEVY:

Correct.

QUESTION:

Now, that's just meaningless, you think.

MR,LEVY:
worker.

It is not meaningless to the injured

This is —*
QUESTION:

Well, I know, the employer relies on it

and quits, but apparently it doesn't affect the prior
award at all,
QUESTION:
MR. LEVY;

That's right.
It affects legally before a court, a

circuit court in Virginia, that is a question of what the
effect, that is.
QUESTION:

All right.

Well, —

56
MR. LEVY:

But in actuality —

QUESTION;

I’m sorry you brought it up!

[Laughter. ]
MR. LEVY:

One other response that Ird like to make

QUESTION:

Before you go to the response, aren't

is —

you really asking some kind of a judicial command from someont
some court, somewhere, to keep up the payments until there's
been a full adversary hearing?
MR. LEVY:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
In other words, sort of a specific

performance equity relief.
MR. LEVY:

We are asking that this Court say that

Rule 13 does not provide due process, by, in reality,
terminating, suspending benefits.
QUESTION:

Well, as I understand Mr. Brame, he

says if you go into circuit court you'll get just that.
You want the money ahead of time.
MR. LEW:

We will get another judgment, which is a

ministerial act of the court, which any insurance company
will treat the same way as the judgment of the Commission.
QUESTION:

You mean the judge — you mean there is

no way in Virginia to enforce a judgment against an insurance
company?
MR. LEVY:

Yes.

There are the traditional common-

57
law remedies that —

QUESTION:

I thought so.

MR. LEVY:

Yes.

Attachment.

QUESTION: So it’s just like any other judgment.
MR. LEVY:

Correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Well, then they — the court will give
you what you want the ComrrdLssion to give — what you want us
to give you.
MR. LEVY:

No, Your Honor.

What —-

QUESTION: Well, what do you want?
In between the two hearings.
MR. LEVY:

You want money?

Right.

We want a notice, first of all# the

fact is ~~
QUESTION: Well, if you get your money, do you want
notice?
MR. LEVY:

No.

[Laughter. 3

MR. LEVY:

No.

QUESTION:

So you’re asking us to order the company

to pay you the money until they have the due process hearing.
MR. LEVY:
QUESTION:
MR. LEW;

No.

What we —

Well, would you be satisfied with it?
Certainly.

But I don't —

QUESTION: Well, as I understand, all you have to
do is file a piece of paper in a court and you get just that.

50
MR. LEVY:

I think that is not clear in Virginia

law.
Second of all, that does not solve the problem of
notice.
QUESTION:

If you get the money?

MR. LEVY:

Yes, but you have to have — you have to

QUESTION;

If you give me the money, I don't care

go --

about notice.
MR. LEVY:

No, but the filing of the court — the

papers in the court does not give you the money.
QUESTION:

That —

You can even —if you owe me money and

you pay me money, you can even deny me due process, if you
give me my money.
MR. LEVY:

Am I right?
The procedures — yes, you are right.

[Laughter. ]
MR. LEVY:

No.

I'm sorry.

No.

That is of course

not our position.
The procedures which in reality are .in effect in
Virginia show that benefits are paid —* this goes to the
voluntariness of the system.

If this is the position that

is being required, or would be required in the court, then
you would have a procedure which would throw the Workmen's
Compensation system all out of kilter.
As the National Commission on Workmen's Compensation

59

said.
The Industrial Commission of Virginia does not
have, quote, "enforcement power”.

Meaning that the State of

Virginia set up the system so that the Commission would not
go out and attach insurance company1s property.
They gave that that power, or they left that power
alone in the court.

And that is the only thing that

section 100 of the Code gives.
It's just the very rare instance, and the only
litigation that could be found under that is thirty years old.
This is just leaving with the traditional common~law court
the power to garnishee, to attach property, and all that.
This system works under a voluntary system, with
penalties which are assessed against an insurance company
for not paying when due, with the ability of the State
Corporation Commission to pull an insurance company's license
if they are not meeting their obligation under this
procedure.
QUESTION:

Sounds to me as though what you're doing

is conceding that you have an adequate remedy at law, but
it’s too complicated and takes too long.
Therefore you
MR. LEVY;

want something — you want a shortcut.

No.

By the very fact that it is

complicated and takes too long, the plaintiffs in Goldberg
had a procedure, they could have gone in to federal court and

60

enforced their welfare benefits.
QUESTION:
No.

That was not a contractual case, was it?

Welfare.

MR. LEVY:

It was not a contractual case.

The plaintiffs in — length of time is what we
are talking about, and that is what procedural due process
within a prior hearing is what we're talking about.

And we

do not have that in Virginia.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Levy.

Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:15 o'clock, p.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.3
