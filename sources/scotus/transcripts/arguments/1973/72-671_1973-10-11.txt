ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH R. CARR, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
(Continued)
MR. CARR:

Thank you, Hr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Yesterday at recess we were examining some of the
factors that Congress had before it at the time it passed the
Civil Rights Act of 196*1.

It looked at the fact that the

Federal Government, operating under the same prohibitory
language as is contained in Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act,
saw no inconsistency for 21 years in applying the same
policy that Farah applies.
Then we were in process of looking at the fact
that some 19 state Fair Employment Practice Commissions, as of
196*1, had addressed themselves to the question of, whether
under their own FEP legislation, barring discrimination on
tne basis of national origin or national ancestry, an
employer could, nevertheless, require that his employees be
citizens and of those 19 states, 18 had found no inconsistency

30

in tiie policies.
Then we turn, if we nay, to the debate surrounding
the '6^ Act itself and, of course, the very first tning we
are faced with is the remark of

Congressman Roosevelt, who

was chairman of the House Subcommittee which reported out
what became the Civil Rights Act and in the course of being
questioned on the floor of the House with regard to what
■'national origin" meant, he said, "Hay I just make very clear
that national origin means national.

It means the country

from which you or your forebears come from.

You may come

from Poland, Czechoslovakia, England, France or any other
country," and with that, the subject was dropped.
Now, in his brief, Mr. Cooper points out that
this is isolated, that there is only one such illustration
in the debate, and I might suggest there that the reason is
because the issue is so obvious that, once answered in tne
normal understanding of the word, there was no further
necessity for expanding on it.
Q

Well, how does that affect — how did

Congressman Roosevelt’s words bear on this issue or help
your case?
MR. CARR:

Because, your Honor, they hold that

the national origin prohibition in the Act means that it is
unlawful for Farah, In the facts of this case, to discriminate
against people on the basis of the fact that they or their

31

ancestors came from Mexico.

The facts in this case clearly

show that there has been no such discrimination, that, rather
the discrimination, if it

exists — and there is

discrimination, no question — is based on the fact that the
person was not a citizen of the United States.
Mow, under Congressman Roosevelt’s language, if
Farah had a policy of hiring nationals from Poland, from
Czechoslovakia, from England and France, but not nationals
of Mexico, then there would be discrimination on the national
origin of the individual and it would clearly be prohibited.
But everybody acknowledges, and all the facts stand clear,
that that is not Farah's policy.
The only other reference similar to this that we
were able to find was in the debates

or the hearings before

Congressman Roosevelt's committee where then-Secretary of
Labor, V/illard Wirtz, was describing the federal policy of
complaint processing on the grounds of employment
discrimination within the Government and Secretary Wirtz*s
attention, obviously, was primarily with regard to racial
discrimination, but then he turned to national origin and
religious discrimination and he said, "For example, if a
person feels that he has been disadvantaged because he is of
Mexican, Italian or Polish origin, then he files a complaint
with the Commission and proceeds."
Nov;, obviously, it was implicit in what Secretary

32

Wirtz was saying, that every single one of those people were
United States citizens.

They wouldn’t even have been

employees of the Federal Government if they weren’t.
Section 701(b) which is now — of Title 7 — which
is now recodified into 5USC7151 — declares that it is the
policy of the Federal Government not to discriminate on the
grounds of national origin and yet no one understood that this
was changing the federal policy.

It was only making statutory

what had theretofore been the rule by Executive Order and
everyone understood that the Federal Government was still
going to limit Its employment practices — employment hiring
to United States citizens and, indeed, I direct your attention,
if I might, to the

brief filed herein on the motion for

certiorari filed by the Solicitor General where he says that
the U.S. agrees xvith the Fifth Circuit's interpretation that
Congress construed the phrase to mean ancestry rather than
citizenship and then he makes the obvious point in a footnote
that, surely, Congress intended that the same meaning be
applied to Section 701(b) of

Title 7 as it applied in

703(a)•
Q

But technically, I suppose, you could say

there was discrimination against people who were born abroad
in the sense that — or people who weren't born in this
country, who didn’t originate in this country.
MR. CARR:

I agree, your Honor.

Q

Technically there is because those people who

were born abroad have to satisfy an employment qualification
that people born here don't.
MR. CARR:
Q

That is right, but —

And, technically, that is it, and so your

argument has to be, that isn’t what Congress intended.
MR. CARR:
Q

Well, right, and the reason —

That’s a substantial discrimination, isn't it

I mean, it is a substantial qualification.
MR. CARR:
Q

It is.

Wo question about that.

You say it takes — how long does it take

to be naturalized?
MR. CARR:

Depending on the circumstances, I

think it is three to five years to get it.
Q

So you just don’t get a job in this country

with the Federal Government or with your client for quite
a while?
MR. CARR:

That is correct and I'd say, frankly,

your Honor, that if more companies had the policy that Farah
has, Congress would probably see fit to change the law.
What we are

suggesting is that so far, they

haven’t.
Q

So your argument is strictly of Congressional

intention?
MR. CARR:

Precisely and I think that is the only

34
issue before this Court.
Q

So it isn't a — well, you don't think the

1981 argument is here?
MR. CARR:

No, sir, I don't, for a number of

reasons.
Q

Did you have some problems with that?

MR. CARR:

A few, but not major ones, your Honor.

1981, of course, is — I think for the reasons that both
Justice Blackmun and Justice Marshall pointed out yesterday,
is not before us.
Q

All right.

MR. CARR:

But even if it were, the courts that

nave faced the question, with one single exception, have held
that Section 1981 does not apply to national origin
discrimination.

They do so primarily on the basis of

Mr. Justice Stewart's decision in Jones versus Mayer —
Q

You mean a power question, they couldn't have

used the 13th Amendment, they had to use the l*lth?
MR. CARR:
Q

That's right.

Which means state action.

MR. CARR:

Correct.

Either way, if they use the

13th, then by the terms, it applies only to racial
discrimination and if they use the 14th, then it applies to
state action.
Q

Well, what about the immigration power?

35
MR. CARR:

We are not suggesting here, your Honor,

that the Congress could not outlaw — prohibit Faran’s
policy under the immigration policy.

It could.

We only

suggest that, so far, it hadn't.
Q

Well, I know, but do you think it is the

practice of the courts to invalidate an Act of Congress that
would be valid under power X just because Congress purported
to use only power Y?
MR. CARR:

Where, your Honor, it is clear that

Congress understood that it was acting pursuant to one, I
think that sheds real light on the Congressional understanding
of wnat they were purporting to do.
Q

I see.

MR. CARR:

I don't mean to bother the Court,

really, with -Q

All right, I'm sorry to have brought it up.

MR. CARR:

The cases that have held that 1981 does

not apply to a racial discrimination, it is interesting that
the only case, and It is cited In Mr. Cooper’s brief, that
holds to the contrary is Guerra versus Manchester Terminal,
which is now7 on appeal to the Fifth Circuit and I think it
will there be reversed, but even Guerra recognizes that the
Act was founded, Section 198l was founded on the 13th
Amendment and I think for that reason Guerra is clearly wrong
and I think the Fifth Circuit will reverse it.

36

To expand a little further on the suggestion of
what the view of the United States is, it has been the policy
for a number of years of the United States to put in various
appropriations acts that no money expended under this or any
other appropriation act in this fiscal year will be used, with
certain, again, limited exceptions to pay aliens.
How, to give the reading to Title 7 that
ar. Cooper and Petitioner ask, you would have to assume that
in 1 6*J, Congress on the one hand said, "From now on, the
Federal Government is going to hire aliens but we are just
not going to pay them."

And,

obviously, that was not the

Congressional intent.
Now, I'd like to direct the Court's attention for
a second to the question of the EEOC regulation.
Q

Mr. Carr?

MR. CARR:
Q

Before you get into that —

MR. CARR:
Q

Yes, sir?

Certainly, your Honor.

There is nothing in the record to show that

there is any variation on the no-citizen rule —
HR. CARR:
Q

Your Honor —

— it applies to anybody equally?

MR. CARR:

Your Honor, there is in the record the

recognition that one time Farah deviated from that policy.
Nov/, it is not in the record, and I apologize both to Counsel

37

and tne Court.

I represented the facts in ray brief and they

are correct, but they are not contained in the record.

Mow,

tnat is because we weren’t asked in the interrogatory.

It

would have corne out but there has been one single exception
in the history of the Company, your honor.
While Mr. Chief Justice Burger in Griggs pointed
out that EEOC guidelines are entitled to great deference and
we don’t quarrel with that for a moment, he then said that
the reason they do is that since the Act and its legislative
history supports the Commission’s conclusion, this affords
good reason to treat the guidelines as expressed in the
will of Congress and it seems to me that this is analagous
to a Fair Labor Standards Act situation where this Court
in Skidmore versus Swift, and consistently since, has said
tnat interpretative bulletins of the Secretary of Labor in
wage-hour cases are entitled to great weight, but in
Skidmore versus Swift itself, the Court held that the reason
they are is because of the weight of such judgment in a
particular case, it said, will depend upon of the thoroughness
evident in its consideration, upon the validity of its
reasoning and all those other factors which give these
interpretative bulletins the power to persuade, if not the
power to control and the courts, while giving tremendous
deference — and I have been on the losing side of one or
two — to interpretative bulletins of the Secretary of

38
Labor, they don't hesitate to overrule them where they are
wrong.
How, we think that that is precisely what the
Court should do in Grlgg3 — I’m sorry, in Farah.
In support of that, we show you what we regard
as the fatal flaw in the EEOC’s reasoning and again direct
your attention to the memorandum on the question of whether
certiorari should be granted.
The Solicitor General pointed to the record of
Farah in employing people of Mexican origin and the fact that
over 90 percent of our employees have such origin and he
referred to this as the atypical situation presented here
wnich makes this a poor case to determine the validity of
the EEOC guideline and the interpretation of the Act it
embodies and in a footnote in the same brief, speaking, I
am certain for the EEOC, the Solicitor said that in light of
these same factors, the EEOC agrees that this is not an
appropriate case in which to test the validity of Its guide­
lines and, therefore, asks the Court not to grant certiorari
and it seems to me that this just proves the invalidity of
the EEOC's reasoning because the guideline, as set out, says
that it does not matter what the facts are.

If you employ a

citizenship criterion for employment, then you have got a
violation.

But we don't you to look at the facts here

because they are not good for us.

39

And if that is the case, this would be the perfect
case to look at and we suggest that the reason they didn't
want the Court to grant cert was because they knew this
Court would affirm the Fifth Circuit decision and throw out
their guideline.
Counsel did raise yesterday in his brief one case
which appears to have some similarity between our case and
that is the Phillips versus Martin Marietta.
the argument is the same.

Superficially,

In Phillips versus Martin

Marietta, Martin Marietta was charged with sex discrimination
against women and they defended on the grounds, well, we
couldn’t possibly be discriminating.
our employees are women.

Seventy-five percent of

But the difference was that, as to

all potential male applicants, Martin Marietta said you are
welcome.

We’re going to look at you.
As to women applicants, they said, you're ’welcome,

unless you have a child under six.
Now, to analogize Martin Marietta to Farah would
be the same distinction I drew earlier.

If we hired Polish

aliens and English aliens and French aliens, but not
Mexican aliens, then we’d be treating a person differently.
But we are not and, therefore, Martin Marietta also has no
application.
Mr. Justice Stewart, I believe, yesterday asked
Mr. Cooper whether there was any

evidence in the record

40
with regard to who was hired in the Petitioner’s place
and Mr. Cooper said that there was none.

Now, in the Appendix

at page 89, the deposition of the Petitioner is reprinted.
She was asked there, "Do you know who was hired for the job
for which you were applying?" and she said, "No, sir."

But

the next question was, "Do you understand that those persons
were Mexican-Americans with Mexican ancestors but who are
United States citizens?"

Answer, "Yes, sir."

Now, in Greene versus MacDonald Douglas, this
Court said that one of the factors needed to prove up a
prima facie case of racial discrimination was for the
petitioner to show, or the plaintiff to show that a person of
a different race had been hired in his stead and here it is
clear from the plaintiff's deposition that the person hired
in her stead was of the same national origin as she.
Your Honor, if there are no further questions,
we would then just urge that the Court affirm the decision
below as eminently correct.
Thank you, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Carr.

Mr. Cooper, do you have any time remaining here?
No?

You've used all your time, I think.

Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10:17 o'clock a.m., the case was
submitted.]
