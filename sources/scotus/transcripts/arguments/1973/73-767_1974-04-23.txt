MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73-767, United States against the Connecticut National
Bank.
Mr. Shapiro, I think you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD E. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Like the case which the Court has just heard,
this case is an appeal by the United States from an adverse
decision by the District Court in a suit under Section 7 of
the Clayton Act, challenging ther merger of two banks.
Like the preceding case, it also raises questions
concerning the application of the doctrine of potential
competition to bank mergers.
The merging banks in this case are the Connecticut
National Bank, headquartered in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and
the First New Haven National Bank, headquartered some twenty
miles away in New Haven.
The Bridgeport and New Haven metropolitan areas
are beyond the New York City commuter zone, in the south­
western corner of Connecticut.
What we're concerned with in this case is both the

4
impact of the merger on the Bridgeport and New Haven
metropolitan market and its impact on the State of Connecticut
as a whole.
This case, unlike the preceding case, involves,
however, a question as to 'the line of commerce, a question as
to the section of the country, questions as to competitive
effects, regulatory effect, as well as convenience and needs.
I'll describe the banks first, and then I would
like to briefly give an overview of the case before stating
what the District Court did.
First New Haven, the New Haven bank, has assets of
$333 million, deposits of $272 million, loans of $224 million.
It's the eighth largest commercial bank in the State.

Nov/,

it’s an important bank, it has a loan limit of $2.3 million,
and it operates some 22 offices, 17 of them in the New Haven
metropolitan area, three of them are really over in the
Bridgeport metropolitan area.
Together

well, the Connecticut National Bank, the

acquiring bank, is the State's fourth largest commercial bank.
And as of 1972 it had assets of $463 million, deposits of
$412 million, loans of .$253 million, and a loan limit of
$2.8 million.

It, too, is a big and healthy bank.

It's been expanding vigorously through the Bridgeport
metropolitan area, and it's gone beyond it.

It has offices

as far east as New Haven, or almost to New Haven, and as far

5

west as Stamford.
The two banks, when they're put together, will
account for about 11.7 percent of the total deposits in the
State.
Nov/, banking in the State of Connecticut is
concentrated.

The State has, I think as of this moment

there are some 72 banks chartered in the State, at the time
of trial I think it was 61.

There has been some new entry,

which I will come to in a moment.
The top ten banks account for about 33 percent of
all of the deposits in the State.

Those top ten banks are

therefore extremely significant in the development of banking
iii the State.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, are there any standards

used by the government or otherwise in determining when there
is a concentration, an undue concentration of banks in a
particular area?
MR- SHAPIRO:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION; What is the test?
MR. SHAPIRO:

We have used the test of -the Phila­

top ten banks in a particular area, as large as the State,
reach 80 percent, the top five banks reach 40 percent, why,

equally high.

No, we would use it in the local

In the local markets, the concentration is
In the eleven major metropolitan areas in

Connecticut, the three largest banks, with the exception of
Norwalk -- this is true anyway •— the three largest banks
account for over 80 percent of the deposits„
QUESTION; Are there any communities in Connecticut
with only one bank?
MR. SHAPIRO:

There are smaller communities with

one bank, yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION: What do you do about -those?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, we recognize that in the local

community there may be some small communities that can't
support more than one bank $ but the test really is not a
mecahnical one of population, but a test of threat to solvency.
Congress has, in effect, prescribed in the Bank
Merger Act .and in Section 7 that competition shall determine
what the structure of banking should be, subject to safeguards
to prevent the failure of banks, to prevent insolvency.
QUESTION: Do you consider a ratio of banking offices
to population in this equation?
MR. SHAPIRO:

No, Your Honor, we do not, because

the test of competition is always a test of independent decision

7
making entities.

Sit's the firm, it's the bank which is the

competitive measure.
Banking offices represent a convenience factor,
for the community.
Let me give an example.

Suppose you have a

community with one bank that operates two offices or three
offices.

Now, that simply is not a competitive relationship,

because the three offices are all owned by one bank.
On the other hand, if you have two banks in the
community, each operating one office, then you do have
competition.

So the competitive measure is not a question of

ratio of offices to population, but a ratio of banks to banks.
Now, returning then to the situation in Connecticut,
I mentioned that the State's general deposit situation is
highly concentrated.

The ten largest banks

controlling

over 30 percent.
This same concentration appears in the local
markets, and it appears particularly in the markets with which
we’re concerned, Bridgeport and New Haven.
The merging banks here each have very large
percentages in their respective markets,

Connecticut National

has about 40 percent of the deposits in the Bridgeport
area. First New Haven has 40 percent of the deposits in the
Hew Haven area.
And I am measuring this by deposits in the area,

3

because there ara other banks, the two Hartford — well, I'll
come in a moment to those.
The banking structure in the State, dominated by
the ten largest, as we view it, has been changing.
two very large banks in Hartford.

There are

They have been expanding

steadily in a series of foothold acquisitions and de novo
office expansion»

They have moved steadily, to the point

where they are substantially bigger than the next eight
banks„
Then you come to another breaking point in the
State’s banking structure, below the first ten the banks
become quite —• become relatively small.

So these first ten

banks are probably the place where the strongest competitive
potential is concentrated»
The Bridgeport and New Haven banks that are merging
here have been moving toward each other's markets.

In fact,

they actually were in competition with each other in an area
involved in this case, a so-called four-town area, a little
to the north of New Haven and somewhat to the east of
Bridgeport.
And that aspect of the case led us to allege that
there was a diminution of actual competition, but the defendants
proposed to the District Court to divest, themselves of
certain of those offices, and the District Court accepted
that offer, so that that actual competition factor is not

9
itself an issue in this case.

However, what that actual

competition offer does show is that these two banks were
coming into conflict with each other.

These are not just

potential entrants on some theory of having the capacity to
enter the market, they are next door to each other right now,
they are on the edge of each other's markets, and they are,
for tliat reason, along v/ith their great economic strength,
the most likely entrants, we contend, into each other's
markets.
The District Court rejected our arguments on a
number of grounds.

It found, first of all, that banking

in Connecticut is -- commercial banking in Connecticut is
not a line of commerce.

It concluded that savings bank

competition in Connecticut is so strong as to destroy the
distinctiveness of commercial banking or, rather, as I shall
argue, it concluded there was a broader line of commerce
called banking, which included both commercial banks and
s avings banks.
It also concluded that the metropolitan areas in
the State of Connecticut are not banking markets.

The only

banking market it recognized was the State as a whole.

Wien

we contended that if that is true then the standards of
Philadelphia Bank should apply to the concentration fell at
appears in the State, the court rejected this vievj on the
ground that concentration didn't really apply here, and the

10

defendants now argue that, well, it doesn't mean they're in
head-to-head competition, it just means the State is a banking
market.
The court concluded that it x^ould be impossible for
the defendant banks to enter by any means that the government
had described, and I shall come to those.

It concludes

that the regulatory factor shoved that competition was not
seriously injured by any potential competition contention of
the government, and finally it sustained the convenience and
needs defense.
Before I go to these many issues, I think I should
at least try to make an overview of what it is the government
thinks it's doing in these potential competition cases.
We start with the premise that in the Philadelphia
National Bank this Court concluded that Section 7 applies to
banking, and that concentration ratios are a primary index
to the diminution of competition, when banks merge.
This was followed in 1966 by a thorough Congressional
re-examination of the problem in the Bank Merger Act of 1966.
Out, of that came a conclusion that the antitrust
laws remained applicable to banking, -that antitrust
standards should apply in banking subject to a new defense,
the convenience and needs defense, which was to apply.

The

Bank Merger Act of 1966 also provides that the bank regulatory
agencies would be permitted to intervene as parties to defend

11

their awn decisions.
Now, viewing this history, the government has con­
cluded that Section 7 is extremely important in preventing a
consolidation of banking among the various States, to the
point where only a few institutions dominate all of the
State's banking.
In Connecticut as a whole, the ten largest banks
have been considering merger with each other since 1960»
Since 1969 there have been four mergers approved by the
regulatory authorities among the ten largest banks.
Mow, tiie two merging banks here are the fourth and
eighth largest in the State, and they're right next door to
each other.

They've spread to the point where they are

actually competing with each other.

Each is a big, strong,

healthy institution, and they are well-managed.

They are

the dominant local banks, with 40 percent of deposits in
their primary markets, in Bridgeport and New Haven.

Those

markets are concentrated, and each bank, therefore, can
bring important new competition into the market of the other,
if they will come in by independent entry.
Now, those markets are attractive, and each bank
has strong incentives to expand into them.

So long as the

attractive and profitable merger route is open, however,
large banks will not give serious consideration to alternative
means of entry.

Their managements, anxious to find merger

12

partners, will squelch any proposals for independent entry.
And their managements will argue that we have to merge with
other large banks because we all have to grow untill we are
as big as the biggest.
And the result is, of course, that the biggest
becomes the measure of the size of all of the banks, and you
have a trend that cannot be stopped if this standard is the
one to govern.
This Court rejected that view in Phi1ade1phia Bank,
and I think it did so rightly,
QUESTION:

If you're right as to the standard, Mr,

Shapiro, why has the government had such a. miserable record
in the District Courts with these challenges to bank mergers?
MR, SHAPIRO:

Because potential competition is a

doctrine, I think, that lawyers instinctively react hostilely
to.

It's an economist's concept,
I think part of the doctrine is very well stated,

one side of the doctrine is well stated in the brief for
Connecticut National Bank, where the wings aspect of the
doctrine is summarized.
The other aspect, the deconcentrating aspect is
really not just an economist's concept, it's a concept which
is derived from Section 7 of the Clayton Act, because it's a
concept which aims at Section 7’s purpose,as this Court
described it in Brown Shoe, to stop the rising trend toward

13

concentration.
So the government has taken potential competition
and argued you can use that as — you can use Section 7
through the potential competition doctrine as a device to
channel the desirable expansion of banks into pro-competitive
directions.

Most courts simply find this novel, it's much

the same with many of the other antitrust laws.

In the

beginning people had difficulty with them.
But .it's a very American concept, Your Honor, that
we should have an atmosphere of competition, and that the
structure of industry should not be decided by administrative
or judicial fiat.

Someone saying, as the District Court here

did, that there should be four or five large banks in the
State.
Rather, structure is to be determined by the
processes of competition, and that’s what Congress decided
when it made Section 7 applicable to bank mergers; not
just reiterating the general view that an administrative
agency must give attendance to the doctrine of — the
doctrines of antitrust, but rather making it specifically
applicable.

16

QUESTION*

Well, you think it's •— right.

HR. SHAPIRO;

But what we're concerned about mainly,

I mean the reason we keep finding these genesises is that
Section 7 is, as we see it, something to channel this
expansive force that the banks are undergoing now into procompetitive directions.

So that you will determine banking

structure by the pro-competitive entry of banks.
Now, the large banks in this case claim that they
have to merge because they have to meet the competition of
the great banks in Hartford.
QUESTION;

They say

And there's the shadow of New York City

in this case, too, isn't there?
MR. SHAPIRO;

And there is a shadow of New York

City they contend. We have to meet that.
Well, I think the shadow of New York City is somewhat
overstated, but on the competition with the Hartford battles,
they say they can't really make it unless they can get
bigger.

That they can't enter any other markets unless they

get bigger.
I would just like to point out that since this case
was tried in Connecticut, there has now’ been eight new bank
charters issued, and five of those bank charters are in the
Bridgeport metropolitan area.
Now, one •— the District Court said, Well, you see,
you don't have to worry about potential competition because

17

there will be new banks coming in all the time.

But, of

course, those are very small banks, and the defendants, who
are very large banks, say, We can’t overcome -the economic
barriers to get into these markets when the little banks
can.
And these big banks would bring a much more
important competitive contribution for the very reasons they
claim that they have to meet the competition of the Hartford
banks, which, over the Statewide area, have such important
resources.

- ■
Now, what the effect of this merger trend in

Connecticut is going to do is to increase Statewide
concentration and create a danger with the systemwide
pricing that's characteristic in Connecticut, that you're
going to have a Statewide oligopoly.

It will deny the

Bridgeport and New Haven markets the Competitive benefits of
independent entry by these large banks, which are poised right
at the doorstep.

And it invites other mergers from the

few remaining banks.
In fact, the fourth merger approved by a regulatory
agency was approved on April 4th and it's a merger of the
third largest and ninth largest bank in the State.
I don't see how, under the standards the District
Court adopted here, the Antitrust Division or the regulatory
agencies are going to be able to apply the antitrust laws as

18
they must, to stop this trend.
And now I'd like to turn specifically to the issues
in the case.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think we'll resume there

right after lunch.
MR. SHAPIRO;

Okay, Your Honor.

[Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at 1:00 p.m., the same day.]

19

AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:01 p.m.]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Shapiro, you may

continue.
MR. SIIAPIRO:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I was about to turn to the specifics of the case:
the District Court's rulings on line of commerce in sections
of the country, the problem of condition of entry, competitive
effects and convenience and needs.
With respect to the line of commerce, the District
Court found that there is in Connecticut a broad line of
commerce called banking, consisting of the commercial banks
and the mutual savings banks.

We need not, for purposes of

this case, contest the existence of this broad line of
commerce.

For, as we view the matter, under this Court's

decision in United States v. Continental Can, the existence
of the broader line of commerce does not preclude the
existence of the more specific lines, commercial banking and
other types of financial institutions.
In fact, in the Phi1lipsburg case, this Court
recognised that there was significant competition among thrift
institutions for the same kind of business that the small
banks in the Phillipsburg area were competing for.
Now, the commercial banking business in Connecticut
has been cutting into the province of the savings banks,

20
particularly with respect to competition for real estate
loans.

Today those — there's no doubt that savings banks

and commercial banks in the State of Connecticut compete for
real estate loans.

They also compete for some types of

personal loans, and they compete for time and savings deposits.
But there is a significant difference of kind
involved.

Savings banks in Connecticut are important, there

are 60 of them, and they have total deposits, I think
slightly greater than the total deposits of the State's
commercial banks.

But Dr. Myles, the vice president of the

savings bank association, explaining the role of savings
banks in the State, said that they are focused primarily on
service to the individual and idle family; 95 percent of the
business, of the loans of the savings banks are real estate
loans, and only five percent is in the other category.
Sixty-four percent of the business of commercial
banks is in non-real estate loans.
The big area for commercial banks, the distinctive
area is of course the commercial and industrial loans.
Savings banks just are not a competitive factor in this area
in Connecticut.

I think they loan some $26 million in what

they classify as commercial and industrial loans, and this is
less than one-half of one percent of their total loans.
And of course savings banks don't offer any of the
special services that commercial banks do, the very special

21
services which the District Court in this case used under the
convenience and needs defense to justify the merger.
There are no savings bank's trusts, there are no
savings bank's computer services, there are no savings bank's
r

corporate services to business.

Even in the loan area,

savings banks are quite limited in their function, they can
only loan up to eight percent of their assets for personal
expenditure loans; commercial banks are not restricted in
tills way.
Well, I could go on, but it boils dov/n, really, to
again a distinction between the unique capacity of commercial
banks on the one hand and the -- particularly in serving
commercial business, and the very useful and important
competition that savings banks have in the area of serving
the family and the individual and those who want to borrow on
real estate or for real estate purposes.
Now, there is another important development in
Connecticut that was quite significant in the District Court's
opinion.

The State of Connecticut adopted, subsequent to the

trial in this case, a statute permitting savings banks to
enter the area up to now exclusively the preserve of the
commercial banks, the demand deposit.
Connecticut savings banks will be able, after 1976
so it's still not in effect yet
checking accounts.

to offer personal

They will be able to offer these only to

22
individuals, however, and only for personal use, not for
business purposes.
Of course, demand deposits in commercial banks are
not so limited.
Moreover, experience elsewhere has indicated that
checking account, powers held by savings banks does not mean a
mass exodus from commercial banks to savings banks, to use
some of the words of Dr. Myles.
[sic]
The States of Hew Jersey and Connecticut both permit
savings banks* checking accounts.

And they also permit them

on a somewhat broader scale than in Connecticut, because in
those States, business savings accounts are allowed.
nonetheless, looking at them only as — looking at
checking accounts only as a proportion of the savings banks’
accounts, it's relative, it's quite low; I think it's only
five or six percent.
So it's unlikely that the competition, while it’s
important and useful and desirable, is going to destroy the
distinctive nature of commercial banking in Connecticut.
Mow7, we approach this case from the standpoint of
Phi, lade.I phia Bank and Phi 3. lips burg, which recognize commercial
banking as a. distinctive line of commerce.

We did not argue

that commercial banking is a line of commerce as a matter of
law.

If we had, we would have objected to the introduction of

evidence on this issue

23

We did contend that this is the starting place, we
showed -tliat commercial banks in Connecticut are just like the
commercial banks in the rest of the country, and that
therefore there is a sufficient basis to treat them as a
distinctive line of commerce.
How, once we were past the line of commerce problem,
though, we had to consider the section of the country.

We

approached that as we had most other banking cases, we looked
to a metropolitan area or region as being a practical
compromise between very large customers and very small
customers of banks.

And we suggested that the proper measure

was the metropolitan area in Bridgeport and the metropolitan
area in New Haven, consisting of a central city, the cities
of Bridgeport and New Haven respectively, and the surrounding
towns, and we used a general measure, the standard metropolitan
statistical area, or SMSA, which is a useful device.
It requires that there be a central city of not less
than 50,000 population, the surrounding towns of not less
than 15,000 population ~~ or not more than 15,000 population,
no less.
And that there be an exchange, a commutation on a
significant basis, 25 percent out from the town, in from the
suburbs into the town, and 15 percent out from the town into
the suburbs.
We thought this was a practical test in this area,

24
because in this area, metropolitan areas are small, we're not
dealing with great

sprawling

agglomerates as in the

Washington metropolitan area or New York City or even
Philadelphia»

It was a relatively small, close-in area»

Now, the SMSA concept is not, ipso facto, a definition
of a banking market.
a practical one.

It's just a tool, but we thought it was

So we used that as our test.

The District Court rejected it, because.we didn't
show what percentage of accounts from within the metropolitan
area actually were in the banks in that metropolitan area.
And -die reason we didn't show it is because we couldn’t show
it.

The only way you can get that kind of information is

by taking a full-scale census of the SMSA, or having some
wondrous computer work done by all of the banks involved, at
great expense.
In fact, what we did in this case, the difficulty of
what’s required is demonstrated by the experience that the
defendants had 'with the New York banks.

Defendants argue the

New York banks are a factor in this market.
to show the

And they wanted

extent to which accounts from Connecticut, people

in Connecticut had taken their business to the New York banks.
So they asked the New York banks for statement
addresses, broken down in various ways.

And the New York banks,

die six leading banks in the country and possibly the world,
the most modern in the world, simply couldn't do it in the time

25

available, at the costs involved.

And we had to settle for

less.
So the government, what it did do was prevail
upon the defendants at least to show, by a sampling of their
headquarters offices in some of the surrounding towns, just
what percentage of the business arose within the SMSA in
these sample offices.
And the results v/ere not surprising, about 80 per­
cent, to use an average, of the business was within the SMSA.
Now, we thought, therefore, that we had proved that
metropolitan areas are a proper market.

The District Court

rejected this and said that the only market is the State at
large.
Now, this is a very surprising view, because it
means that you don't have local banking markets in Connecticut
for any practical purpose, you just have a great big thing
called the State at large.
QUESTION:

Would you think there would be a

difference, Mr. Shapiro, in that approach if you're in a
State like Connecticut on the one hand, or a State like Alaska
on the other?
MR. SHAPIRO:

No, Your Honor, the size of the

State, while it is a factor — well, just doesn't mean that
there aren't local banking markets.
To illustrate, the defendants in this case contend.

26
that the Philadelphia Bank standards should not be applied
to them, because ~ on a Statewide basis.

They say the State

is the market, but PhiladeIph i a Bank should not be applied to
them, because they aren't head-to-head competitors.

They're

not competing with each other.
So they're really kind of denying the existence of
a Statewide market in any traditional sense, and that sense,
of course, is that it be a practical compromise based on the
customer-supplier relationship which measures an area of
effective competition among banks.
Now, the Hartford banks in Hartford do not compete
with the defendants in New Haven.

The Hartford banks, when

they have an office in New Haven, do compete with -the
defendant banks in Mew Haven.
So it's a local market that we're talking about, not
a Statewide market.

QUESTION:

Suppose there — there might be States

where, of course we don't know because we don't have a ca.se,
and we don't have any record proof, but a State like Rhode
Island might just be pretty much Providence and that's it,
or a State like Delaware might be ~MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Well, certainly Rhode Island comes —
— Wilmington and that's it.

But

Rhode Island -MR. SHAPIROs

Rhode Island would come close, although

27
although even there in the southern part of the State or out
on that island off the coast, it might be possible to say
that's distinct.
But — well, Hartford is 42 miles away or fifty
miles away by car, I think, from New Haven.

And that's a

little far to go for banking.
QUESTION:

It's all of western Connecticut, too.

MR. SHAPIRO:

And it sprawls. There are eleven

metropolitan areas in the State, and they're fairly
distinctive, we contend.
Now, there is the matter of the New York banks.
The New York banks cast a long shadow in the banking in our
country, in fact they cast a shadow not only over Connecticut
but over New England, the Middle Atlantic States, and the
country at large.

They are big banks and they are doing

business on a national basis.
It's also true that Connecticut, in its very south­
west coerner, there's a little panhandle that sticks out of
southwestern Connecticut kind of into New York, and that is
a commuter area.

It probably runs up a little beyond Stamford.

And people who live in that area can get. into New York City
to work, and do get into New York City to work, and there are
substantial
New York banks.

there are undoubtedly commuter accounts in the
And a fairly reasonable number of them, a

fairly high number of them.

28

But when the defendants brought in a report through
Special Masters appointed by the District Court on the
effect of the New York banks, V7hat they found was that there
are about 487 million dollars in so-called Connecticut
accounts.

And that's accounts from the State as a whole.

Which were in the New York banks.

That's roughly seven percent

of the total, deposits in Connecticut commercial banks,
divided among the six biggest New York banks.
And then when we looked a little closer at it, we
found thiss

the average size of those deposits was $20,000.

Now, the average size of a Connecticut bank deposit was $1700.
This is in Government Exhibit 130.
What this suggests is that the New York banks are
really competing for the larger business accounts, that's
where the bulk of the big account is coming from, that's
where the bulk of that money is coming from.
Now, New York banks compete across the country.
This was recognized in Philadelphia.

And in PhiladeIphia,

the court excluded the New York banks from the market, saying
it would draw the market too broadly.

And it also, despite

the geographic proximity, excluded other States in the
Philadelphia area, I think Pennsylvania and Delaware.

And I

think tiie same rule would apply here.
So, under a Philadelphia test, and the facts we show,
we don't think that the New York banks are the factor that the

29

defendants make them.
Now, we did agree that the State is a section of
the country, not a banking market in the traditional buyerseller sense, but a section of the country in which certain
distinctive competitive effects could be measured.

And we

argued that Philadelphia Bank would necessarily apply.

It

applies because what you — there is a competitive danger
when these big banks are merging, that you're going to get a
Statewide oligopoly.
The defendants deny that, they say Philadelphia
shouldn't apply; but they don’t really explain why, if the
State is a market, as they contend, it shouldn’t.

Except

that they say we’re not head-to-head competitors.
Well, there are other competitive effects besides
head-to-he ad.
I turn now to the problem of entry, which is an
important consideration here.
I tliink the first important tiling to remember about
entry in these cases is that when a merger is denied, a bank
will seek an alternative way of getting into a market which
it says it can’t get into.
Now, that’s demonstrated dramatically in this case.
Connecticut National attempted to merge with one
of the big Hartford banks.

The Department of Justice sued,

and they abandoned the merger. They told the Comptroller of

30
the Currency, in Government Exhibit 125,, in their application,
that tliere was no way the Hartford bank could get into the
Bridgeport market, except by merging with Connecticut National
Bank.
And then, when the merger was frustrated, the
Hartford bank -went in and bought a little bank in Bridgeport,
made a foothold entry into Bridgeport City itself, and then
made a de novo branch entry into the city of — into the
town of Fairfield, which was then an open town.
So that tliis problem of seeking alternatives, which
is demonstrated by -this record in DX 125.
Now, there are three ways that we think that people
could enter in Connecticut.
First, 1 have to explain that under Connecticut lav/
there’s a home office protection provision, which says that
a bank cannot enter another bank's headquarters town.

So

that any town that has a bank headquartered in it is closed
to de novo branching.

I shouldn't say can't enter, I should

say de novo branching is closed to the opening of a new
branch office.
But there were towns around New Haven, there were
towns around Bridgeport, which were open for de novo entry.
And we contend that if you view the area as a metropolitan
area, you could make effective entry into these towns and
be an effective functioning competitor in the metropolitan

31
area.
A second method for entry was by purchasing a
foothold bank.

There are no foothold banks left in New Havers,

because tire Hartford banks picked them up two years ago.
But there eire foothold banks in the surrounding towns, and
they did offer a means of entry.
Now, the same thing was true around Bridgeport.
What's happened in Bridgeport is that there

were

six toxins

open for entry — five toxins open for — six toxins open for
entry, and there has now been new banks created in those
towns, Fairfield, Trumbull, some of the others, and the result
is that those towns are now closed to de novo branching,
because there will be a bank headquartered in .them.
But those new little banks form potential foothold
entrance.

So there is a way of getting in by that method.
Finally, there is the use of the holding company,

which is authorized under Connecticut law.
permit holding companies.

Connecticut does

There's no reason why a holding

company couldn't sponsor — I shouldn't say sponsor?
actually create a subsidiary and acquire it.
It was argued that this was of -— this might be
illegal, but the Comptroller *— I'm sorry, the Commissioner of
Banking in Connecticut testified that he had never been
faced with this kind of request before.
The bank holding company law in Connecticut has only

32

been in effect since 1963,

In fact, there were a couple of

young vice presidents in the First New Haven Bank who
suggested this route in 1969, but at that time First New
Haven was looking around for a merger partner, and they
weren't about to be listened to, and of course Connecticut
National was also engaged in looking for a partner among the
cop ten.

So no one was going to produce — pursue these

routes.
Finally, I'd like to say one brief word about the
convenience and needs defense in this case»

That defense

was that there would be special banking services, of a kind
which would serve particularly the interests of business?
but perhaps the shortest and quickest answer to the convenience
and needs defense here is that the bank examiner who went out
when the application for these banks was submitted, when their
merger application was submitted, the bank examiner who went
out came back and said:

Both of these banks are adequately

serving the convenience and needs of their community.
And they are»
community is well banked.

They're good banks.

And the

There's plenty of alternative

service in the Bridgeport metropolitan area and the other.
And the final point on -that issue is that if you
are going to engage in a balancing of competitive effects
against convenience and needs, you've got to be right about
the competitive effects.

33

Our ever-all position is that the District Court
here was wrong on the line of commerce, was wrong on the
section of the country, was wrong on the condition of entry,
failed to give — failed to weigh adequately competitive
effecte, and therefore couldn't adequately measure
convenience and needs.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Shapiro.

Mr. Reycraft.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE D. REYCRAFT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE CONNECTICUT NATIONAL BANK,
AND APPELLEE FIRST NEW HAVEN NATIONAL BANK.
MR, REYCRAFT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This case was decided against tine government after a
trial in. which tee District Court he-»-1-* testimony

from 24

witnesses, whose testimony covered more -than 2500 pages, and
after the District Court reviewed more than 240 exhibits.
^Approximately seven months after the conclusion of
the trial, tee District Court made 293 findings of fact,
taken in part from proposed findings submitted by the government
and in part from those submitted by the defendant.
This lengthy record covered in detail, as required by
Brown Shoe, tee history, structure and probable future of
banking in Connecticut.
The government called only three witnesses in its

34

case in chief.

The first witness was Dr. Giants, who

testified only as to how standard metropolitan statistical
areas are delineated.
He was not offered as an expert on banking markets
and in fact he disclaimed any expertise in banking markets.
He agreed that SMSA is determined strictly on commuting
patterns, that banking is not one of the criteria used in
determining SMSAs.
He said that cities and towns in the New England
area are much more meaningful ways of analyzing SMSAs and
building SMSAs than counties, as in other parts of the
country, because of the relatively large size of counties in
Connecticut.
He testified that New Haven and Bridgeport were
tvjo separate and distinct areas, that there was very little
if any cross"commuting, and vary little if any economic
integration between the two.
He said that the population of the City of New Haven
had declined by about 20 percent during the twenty~year period
from 1950 to 1970, and that the population of the City of
Bridegport declined by about 1*4 percent during the same
period.
The second witness called by the government was Dr.
Neil B. Murphy, a former staff member of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, who had worked on bank mergers there.

35
Dr. Murphy did say that commercial banks were
unique financial institutions, but he realized primarily
on the demand deposit function, which he says is virtually
unique to commercial banking, he said it's the most important
service offered by commercial banks, which is not offered by
savings banks.
Now, it's an undisputed fact, as Mr. Shapiro has
said, that savings banks in the State of Connecticut do now
have the power, effective January7 1, 1376, to offer checking
accounts and accept demand deposits in the State of
Connecticut, thereby eliminating that most important
dis tinction•
He generally agreed with the government -— that is,
Dr, Murphy — that SMSAs at the outset, were at least a useful
starting point for determining banking markets.

But he agreed

also, Dr. Murphy, that there were not use to analyze banking
markets,
Dr. Murphy himself, the government's expert, said,
in an article he wrote, that increasing competition among
commercial banks and savings type institutions for savings
type liabilities suggest that some reconsideration of the
product line may be in order.

And he said this is especially

important if savings banks are successful in obtaining the
checking account privilege, which they now have in Connecticut
as of year-end 1975.

36

He agreed that savings banks are reasonable
stabstitutes for commercial banks in Connecticut for personal
loans.

He agreed that savings banks, in fact, now treat

savings deposits as withdrawable on demand, even thcugh they
do have the right to ask for a thirty-day notice before
allowing withdrawals.
Dr. Murphy, the -government's expert, agreed that
73 percent of Connecticut National's loan portfolio now is
subject to competition from savings banks.
He agreed that a commercial banker considering a
new market should take into consideration the presence of
savings banks.

He agreed that the fact that the population

of New Haven had declined about 20 percent from 1950 to 1970
meant that it was not a very good place to put a new bank
office, as far as retail business is concerned; and he said
that, based on objective evidence, he would not put a bank
there.
He agreed that banking in Connecticut has become more
competitive between 1355 and 1971, because there are more
alternatives available to consumers.
He agreed that the proposed merger would have no
adverse effect on the — at the present time on small borrowers,
small depositors, or small businessman in either New Haven or
Bridgeport,
The third witness called by the government "was Mr.

37

Benjamin Blackford, who is president of State National Bank
in Bridgeport, a competitor of Connecticut National Bank.
State National Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of S&H Green
Stamps; combined, State National and S&H Green Stamps have
assets in the neighborhood of a billion dollars in earnings,
in the neighborhood of $30 million a. year, compared to 3«75
million for Connecticut National Bank.
Mr. Blackford testified that he was not familiar
with the phrase "standard metropolitan area" and he did not
know what made it up or what it meant.
He also testified that State National was the oneprice bank, that is, it does not charge discriminatory prices
and charges the same throughout its service area.
He said that State National is in competition with
savings banks, with "one hand tied behind our back."

He

said that every bank in the area feels they compete with New
York banks for trust business.

He said State National has a

lot of customers who work in New York.

He said a few of these

big mutual savings banks around here "give us all the
competition we need."
And he said he takes into account savings bank
competition when he considers opening a new branch, because,
as he said, "you can’t beat them on price, you've got to beat
them on service.”
Mr. Blackford was the concluding witness in the

33

go ve .minent' s casa in chie f „
The government called only one other witness, that
was Mr. Peter Stassa, president of Lafayette Bank and Trust
Company, who was called in rebuttal.
Mr. Stassa also said that he did not consider the
SMSA concept one way or the other as being the market of
Lafayette.

He testified, "I think we have our own description

of what we -think our market is.51

And he said that the bank's

market was primarily where it had its offices.
He testified also that competition — that his
competition included every other bank, and he specifically
included savings banks within that competition.
The defendants and intervener called twenty witnesses,
including two economists, one Dr. Merton J« Peck, the chairman
of the Economics Department of Yale University, and the
other Dr. Charles Stokes, the former chairman of the Economics
Department of the University of Bridgeport.
Both of these witnesses, who had detailed familiarity
with the market and the area, geographic area in Connecticut,
and both of whom are experts in structural competition and
potential competition, testified that as economists they
saw no adverse effect on the structure of potential
competition or any of its parts in the proposed merger.
Dr. Peck took the government's assumption on the
significance of potential competition and he applied them to

39

Connecticut,

lie assumed that commercial banking was a line

of commerce, he assumed that entry into the closed towns of
New Haven and Bridgeport might occur some time in the future,
and he assumed that potential competition had some significance
in the field of banking.
He prepared a detailed study of the structure of
potential competition in Connecticut based on these three
Assumptions of the government, and concluded that even on
these assumptions the proposed merger would have no adverse
effect on the structure of potential competition in
Connecticut.
He found that following the proposed merger there
would be no less than four firms identified by the government
as potential entrants into each of the major banking
markets in Connecticut.
The District Court found, based on Dr. Peck's
testimony, that no first rank potential entrant would be
eliminated by the merger, and that in 21 of 40 closed towns
there are not 48 closed towns out of 169

that

theoretically eliminated potential entrant ranked seventh
out of ten.
The court also found, based on Dr. Peck's testimony,
that in 52 open towns, nine potential entrants identified by
the government as having Statewide expansion capability
would remain after -idle consolidation.

40

In 15 large towns in Connecticut, with over 50,000
in population, Dr. Peck testified, and the District Court
found, that there are no fewer than four banks identified by
the plaintiff as capable of expanding into Statewide systems,
which would remain as potential entrants after the proposed
consolidation.
For example, in Hartford, First New Haven ranks
fifth in size among the ten largest theoretical potential
commercial bank entrants,
At the present time, First New Haven would rank no
better than fourth among theoretical potential entrants into
Bridgeporto
Now, Mr. Shapiro has said First New Haven is the
most likely entrant into Bridgeport.

I simply don't understand

that.
Hartford National, which has $1,7 billion of assets,
is not nov; in the City of Bridgeport, and on the government's
"theory it is the most likely entrant into Bridgeport.

Under

the government's theories, the second most likely entrant
into the City of Bridgeport is Union Trust Company, with over
700 million of assets.

It is not now in Bridgeport.

Under the government's theories, trie third largest
potential entrant into Bridgeport is Colonial Bank and Trust
Company of Waterbury, which is larger than First New Haven.
The District Court found, based on Dr. Peck's

41
testimony, that before the merger there were five potential
entrants into New Haven, ranked by the government as capable
of becoroing Statewide banks.

After the consolidation there

would be four.
The District Court found that since five of
Connecticut's largest commercial banks already operate in
New Haven, -they have more impact on competition there than
does the possibility of potential entry by Connecticut
National.
The five banks in Hew Haven now are Connecticut
Bank and Trust Corap any, with —
QUESTION:

Mr. Reycraft, —

MR. REYCRAFT:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir?
if there is a difference between

actual potential entry and perceived potential entry, to
which of these concepts is your present argument more relevant
to? it's the perceived one, I suppose.
MR. REYCRAFT:

Mr. Justice White, because we

offered no evidence on perceived potential entry -QUESTION: Well, that may be, but that isn't —
I'm asking what about, what you're talking about now, who is
the most likely potential entrant.
of these concepts?

Is that directed to both

Is it .relevant to both or not?

MR. REYCRAFT:

I understand, Mr. Justice White,

that in analyzing either of these concepts the government does

42

look at who is the most likely, and —
QUESTION: Why .is that significant when you're talking
about an actual potential entrant?
MR. REYCRAFTs

I deny that Connecticut National is

an actual potential entrant into New Haven,

The discussion of

potential competition in the State of Connecticut was based
on the government's assumptions? namely that
QUESTIONs Well, let's assume, though, that you have
let's assume you have four actual potential entrants that
you could — I know you say that isn't so here? assume that
there were.

Would it make any -- and you could rank them,

first, second, third and fourth, in terms of the likelihood of
their entry.
Does it really make

does it really have to be the

most likely, tile
MR, REYCRAFT:

I think the most important thing that

the government needs to show, Mr, Justice White, is that the
potential entrant, the claimed potential entrant would have
entered the town but for the acquisition,
that the government did not prove that.

I say, of course,
New Haven is a

closed town, and Connecticut National could not enter New
Haven.
QUESTION: But if the government could show that and
did show it, it really wouldn't make so much difference if it
was the first or the second or the third most likely entrant.

43

Would it?
MR. REYNCRAFT:

Well, 1 would think so, Mr. Justice

White, that •—
QUESTION; Why?

That's what I'm asking.

MR. REYCRAFT:

I would think so, because if the —

the most likely entrant is the one who is most like3.y, I
don't know much to add to that; and of course the question is
What is the importance of eliminating a less likely entrant?
If the fourth most likely entrant is being eliminated,
theoretically, then there are two or more likely.
QUESTION:

That may be

side, -that may be so.

that's on the perceived

But if someone actually would have

entered, even if he was the third most likely, actually if
you can prove that he very likely would have entered, that
seems like you've gone an awful long ways towards proving
your case.
I agree with

I understand you to say they

haven't proved that here.
MR. REYCRAFT:

Yes, Mr. Justice White, I think that

if tiie government had proved that Connecticut National would
have entered the City of New Haven by other means, then
they would have advanced their cause.

I agree with you,

I did not —
QUESTION: And your argument about the Hartford
Bank would not be so

wouldn't be as substantial, I wouldn1

44
think, if the government had actually proved this other
point.
MR. REYCRAFT; Well, I think that it's a question of
fact as to *—
QUESTION :

Yes.

MR. REYCRAFT;

as to whether they would have

entered, and my conception of tine evidence in this case,
the government didn't make a serious attempt even to prove
that they would have entered.
QUESTION;

Other than just the so-called argument

from objective facts, that this was a bank with the
capability.
MR. REYCRAFT: Well, on objective facts, Mr. Justice
White, I would say that the objective facts as to likelihood
of entry would be based upon the size of the potential
entrant.
QUESTION:

Yes,

MR. REYCRAFT: And that the larger the entrant the
more —
QUESTION:

I agree with that,

I agree with that.

But it still wouldn't mean that the bank of New Haven
wouldn't have been in position, objectively, to enter into
Bridgeport.
MR. REYCRAFT:

If the government is correct that

New Haven banks can enter the City of Bridgeport, and if First

45
New Haven was eliminated as one of those firms which would have
but did not, then on the reserve question, Hr. Justice White,
I would say that that

that the government would argue that

that was a loss of a competitor in that area.
QUESTION;

Yes.

Yes.

That the government would

say it, and you wouldn't agree with it.
HR. REYCRAFT:

Right?

I would agree that six competitors

generally mean more competition than five.
It's a question of substantiality, hovrever, whether
the likelihood of that elimination of that possibility
would substantially lessen competition.

And that is what I

say the government has failed to prove.
Professor Stokes, who is on leave from the University
of Bridgeport, also testified that the proposed merger would
have no effect on the structure of potential competition in
Connecticut.
The defendants and the intervenor called 18 other
witnesses, who were bankers and businessmen in the City of
New Haven, who testified generally on competition and
generally agreed that commercial banks and savings banks were
in very substantial competition within the State.
The structure of banking in Connecticut is highly
competitive.

The number of commercial banks has increased

during the last eleven years.

And the alternatives available

to consumers has increased in the majority of Connecticut's

46
169 towns.
As of year-end 1963 there were 64 commercial banks
in Connecticut.

As of the close of the record there were

also 64 commercial banks in Connecticut.

Since the close of

tlie record, as Mr. Shapiro has indicated, eight new commercial
banks have been chartered; so there are now 72 commercial
banks in Connecticut, compared to 64 twelve years ago.
So that this alone demonstrates that the most
likely entrants into commercial banking in the city, in the
State of Connecticut are investors and not other banks.
There has been no occasion in the history of banking in
Connecticut when any bank holding company or bank has followed
the route proposed by Mr. Shapiro, which is to the so-called
holding company new charter route.
The State Commissioner of Banking testified that it
had never happened in the State of Connecticut,

he said that

if it were done, it would result in a bugle call of fury from
other banks with litigation. The State of Connecticut also
has a form- which applicants for a new bank charter are
required to fill otrfc.
That form says:

This bank is not to be organised

for the purpose of selling, merging, or combining with any
State bank or trust company or national bank now in existence.
So, in order to follow the procedure that the
government is suggesting in this case, it would require false

47
statements by the applicants in order to get a State bank
charter.
Now, the Comptroller of the Currency has only
chartered three banks in the State of Connecticut since 1963,
and two of these banks were what are called interim banks,
which were formed for the purpose of facilitating the
elimination of minority shareholders, and a bank holding
company in Hartford.
For the State as a whole, commercial banking options
for retail customers have increased in 94 of the 169 Connecti­
cut towns, and they have decreased in only -three towns
between 1955 and 1971.
There are more alternatives today in Fairfield
County,

in 19 of 23 Fairfield County towns, than there were

in 1955.

And there are more alternatives in 22 of 27 New

Haven County towns, than in 1955.
Among 119 towns in Connecticut, outside Fairfield
and New Ifaveb Counties, the number of commercial banking
options has increased in 53, remained unchanged in 65, and •
decreased in only one such town.
Even Dr. Murphy, the government's expert witness,
conceded that banking in Connecticut has become more
competitive since 1955.
The government has raised essentially four issues
here:

whether the two banks are significant potential entrants

48
into each other's markets? whether standard metropolitan
statistical areas are really without more banking markets?
whether the two banks are significant potential entrants
into other local banking areas in Connecticut? and, fourth,
whether existing competition from savings banks and existing
competition from New York banks should be totally disregarded
in determining the impact on the structure of potential
competition in Connecticut»
Nov?, the District Court found against the government
on all of these issues, vfhich are essentially factual — which
are factual issues.
The government's argument on standard metropolitan
statistical areas apparently was important to it in this
case, unlike its position in the Philadelphia National Bank
case, Phi1lipsburg, Brown Shoe, and Nashville,

because it

could not show that these banks were likely entrants into
the horae office cities of the others, because they were closed.
In order to show an entry into a banking market, it
was necessary to show that entry into a suburban town some”
where near New Haven would be adequate.
The only witness that testified that SMSAs were
banking markets was Dr. Murphy, who did testify that he had
no familiarity with the geography or banking in Connecticut.
Dr. Peck, who was familiar with the area, who
teaches at Yale University, said that the acquisition of, for

49

[sic]
example, a sraall bank in Wcocibridge, Connecticut, would not
be an effective entry into the New Haven area, to compete with
First New Haven National Bank,
The Woodbridge Bank and Trust Company has about
$8 million assets, it has about one office.

It is not

allowed to branch into New Ilaven, because that's a closed
town.

Of flue 11 towns in the New Haven standard metropolitan

statistical area, six are closed.
In the Bridgeport standard metropolitan statistical
area, six out of eight of the towns are closed.

So that

new entry into those towns is not legally permissible at the
present time.
On. idle question of banking markets, both the
government and the defendants in this case agree that the
State of Connecticut is an appropriate area to look at in
appraising this particular bank merger.
The reason is because, as defendants, we applied
this Court’s test in Philadelphia National Dank case, which
is that tiie relevant section of the country to look at is the
area within which State law permits banks to branch or merge«
and that's subject to home office protection, is the State of
Connecticut.
Now, we don't say that the State of Connecticut is
the banking market in which First New Haven and Connecticut
National compete, as Mr. Shapiro does.

He goes from the

50

assumption that if Connecticut is a banking market, therefore
everybody in the State must compete within it*

The facts

are, and he concedes the facts are, 'that they do not*
Connecticut National's primary service area is Fairfield
County, where most of its offices are located.

First New

Haven's banking area is essentially southern New Haven County.
.And there is a small area of interaction between
them in the four-town area that Mr. Shapiro described? but,
other than that, they are not in competition with each other.
There are smaller banks in the State which do operate
strictly on a local basis.

For example, the Woodbridge Bank

and Trust Company that we've referred to operates strictly
in Woodbridge.
The government's own exhibits show that in the town
of Fairfield, Connecticut National's Fairfield office gets
77.1 percent of its business from people who have statement
addressed in the town of Fairfield;

that is highly localised.

They show that 83.1 percent of the deposits of Connecticut
National's Trumbull office originate in Trumbull.
So, for the small customer, he is limited to the
area in which he lives.
For the larger customers, however, the choices
increase dramatically.
New York banks, as Mr. Shapiro has conceded, obtain
close to $500 million of banking business from the State of

53.
Connecticut.

Now, that's just banking business that we were

able to prove, as a result of a survey done with the
assistance of -the Special Master.

We served deposition

notices and subpoenas on New York banks.

And while we

encountered a good deal of resistance, and it took a good
deal of time', we were able to prove nearly $500 million of
banking business which these banks alone got out of the
State of Connecticut.
This is significant.

For commuters also, between

New Haven and —• between Connecticut and New York, the choices
are substantial.

The government’s own exhibits show that

there are 50,000 people who cross** commuted between Connecticut
and New York.

ABoufc 25,000 go from Connecticut to New York,

and about 25,000 come back from New York to work in Connecticut.
There’s substantial cross-commutation, and the
government's evidence shows that it’s increasing.
Now, if these commuters or these cross-commuters
represented only one employed person per household of five,
that would be the equivalent of the city of 250,000 people,
which is larger than either the city of New Haven or the
city of Bridgeport.
In Fairfield County, the combined circulation of -the
New York Times and the New York Daily News exceeds by six to
one the circulation of the on3.y local newspaper circulated
in Bridgeport, which is the Bridgeport Post Telegram.

52

Television advertising by New York banks saturates
the lower Connecticut area.

The New York banks do advertise

personal loans, retail loans, savings deposits.
Now, we say, for this reason that the government's
statistics, their so-called concentration ratios, are highly
suspect or highly attenuated, not only for the reason that
the -- of the effect that New York banks have on Connecticut,
but also because of savings bank competition.
If a bank in New Haven were considering entering
the City of Birdgeport, he would have to consider the fact
that when he went into Bridgeport, he would be competing with
Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, with $1.3 billion of
assets, Hartford National with $1.7 billion of assests, with
Connecticut National, he would be competing with People's
Savings Banks with over $700 million of assets.

And the

government’s own evidence shows that over 70 percent of his
business is in competition with savings banks.
So whether the Court decides that savings banks
should be included in the line of commerce, or analyses it
strictly in commercial banking terms, the effect of that
competition from savings banks is a real thing, a banker in
New Haven thinking of entering Bridgeport would be foolish
not to consider that competition for that, amount of his
business.
I will leave the rest of my time, Your Honor, to

53
Mr. Loevinger.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Loevinger.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE LOEVINGER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY
MR. LOEVINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
Let me first answer a question which I believe was
asked by Mr. Justice Stewart as to the genesis of potential
competition„
My research indicates it's been considered in six
cases, of which the first was -the El Paso case? the six cases
are El Paso, Continental Can, Penn-0lin, which was the third
case, Procter & Gamble, Ford, and Falstaff. Falstaff is the
first case in which this Court gave rather plenary consideration
to it.
The cases are discussed, beginning at page 76 of
our brief in this case, the six cases just mentioned are
summarized at pages 82 and 83.
Mow, it seems to me that there has been some -—
there's obviously a conflict, as there always is in cases
coming before this Court, but there is a matter here that
involves an apparent conflict of philosophy between government
agencies.
Clearly, the banking agencies, the Comptroller of

54
idle Currency, and the Department of Justice are in conflict,
and it has occurred to me that it might be useful if I could,
without really tying anybody down to anything, try to analyse
the basis of this conflicting philosophy.
The Department argues in this case that if large
healthy banks like Connecticut National and First New Haven
are permitted to expand by merger, that the result will be a
Statewide structure in which most local markets will be
nominated by a few large banks.
Now, I suggest that this is a much more likely
result if these banks are not permitted to expand by merger.
As the Department itself admits, there is in the nature of
local markets, there are relatively few banks.

You can't

talk about local banking markets, and banking is one of the
most competitive fields in the United States, you can't, talk
about local banking markets as though you were talking
about the national beer market, as you were in Falstaff.
In fact, a remarkable coincidence is that in
Falstaff there were ton actual or potential competitors in a
national beer market, whereas in a tiny little State like
Connecticut, the third smallest State in the United States,
they are still talking about ten competitors„
Well, when you get it down to little local markets,
you don't get large numbers; and if you confine these banks
by forbidding mergers, which you are going to get, are dominant

55
local banks.

There is simply no question about this in my

mind.
Let me try to illustrate it by posing two alternative
concepts.

These are admittedly highly hypothetical, they

correspond only roughly to reality, because you can't
construct a hypothetical that really corresponds to all of
the aspects of reality.
But let us take a State that has 50 towns in it,
each one of which has two banks, so that there is competition
among each of these two banks, there are no large dominant
banks, no large dominant cities.

Every bank has approximately

one percent of the banking business in the State.
According to the Department's theory, the State is
competitive, because nobody has more than one percent.

But

every single banking market in the State, each town, is
concentrated, because there are only two banks; and two banks
have a hundred percent.
Nov;, let us take an alternative thing, let us say
that by some miracle of legal transmutation, administrative
and legal action, that there are a whole lot of mergers in
this State.

And that -the fifty, or rather the hundred banks

in the State merge into ten Statewide banks, ten much larger
Statewide banks, and that as a result of this they decide to
branch out, and so each of them establishes branches in a
number — not in all, but in a number of States.

56

So we end up with, let us say
town has five banks.

hypothetically, each

There are 250 banking offices in the

State as opposed to 100 banking offices previously.
Now the Department tells us that the difference in
banking offices don't make any difference.

But each town

now has five banking offices, each representing a different
bank.
The State, on the other hand, has only ten banks.
The same number of competitors as there were nationally in
Palstaff.

On a State basis, they would say that there is

concentration, because ten banks have a hundred percent.
Indeed, there is likely to be some asymmetry, and it is
likely that five banks have a little bit more than fifty
percent.
So they tell us this State bank — that this is
concentrated.
On a local basis, there is less concentration
certainly, because each locality has five banks; although
five banks still have a hundred percent, which, according to
the definitions in tests we’ve been given is still concentra­
tion.
And yet I submit to the Court;
public being better served?

which way is the

Having five alternatives, five

competitors available in every town co every bank customer, or
having two little banks?

57
Now, I submit that this is the basic conflict in
philosophy between the Department of Justice and the Comptroller
here.

That the Department says that a larger number of smaller

limited-service, limited-”competition banks is preferable,
whereas the Comptroller, without making any arbitrary
commitment as to number, says that in general a smaller
number of larger full-service, fully competitive banks will
better serve the public interest.
Now, reality is always far more complex than these
hypotheses, but I think that what this dees illustrate is
that simple per se rules just don't work, and very often will
in fact work to frustrate the very objective that they are
tliought to be serving»
Indeed, in some respects you can see this in
Connecticut here.

We have been given a test by Mr. Shapiro

that the market is concentrated if the top ten have 80 percent
or more, or if the top five have 40 percent or more of the
market.
And he applies this and says

we’ve got a concentrated

market, in Connecticut.
Well, let's look at the facts»
The Connecticut National and the First New Haven,
the merging banks here, their share of commercial bank
deposits

and I refer only to those because 1 don't think

it makes — I don't think the line of commerce makes any

58
difference here -- -chat their share of commercial bank
deposits from 1959 to 1972 declined from 13,8 percent to 10.3
percent.

They had a declining share of total State commercial

bank deposits.
The Hartford National and Connecticut Bank and
Trust#tile two giant Hartford banks, had 34.5 percent in
1959, but 41.3 percent in 1972,

Consequently, if you're

looking for the 40 percent test of the top five, you can
add any other three to the Hartford Bank and CBT and you get
over 40 percent.
Now, I submit again that this simply beggars common
sense, that you cannot say, because the two leaders are
increasing their percentage that their competitors should be
precluded from merging.

If there is any sense at all to

this notion of structure as a test of competitive performance,
it must be that increasing concentration forecloses merger
to those who are in the increasingly concentrated segment
to the growing segment of the market; not to those who are
in the diminishing segment.
It simply makes no sense to say that because our
two big competitors are increasing their share that therefore
we'll foreclose the opportunity to merge to the two smaller
banks, and, indeed, this is the very hypothesis that was
rejected in Brown Shoe in the quotation that I read earlier
and is cited in our brief.

59

Justice White asked, What is the difference between
the first and the second in rank and perhaps those lower in
rank, among potential entrants, either from the viewpoint of
a perceived or an actual future potential entrant?
I think I might answer that slightly differently
than Mr. Reycraft.

I think there is a difference.

I think

we all generally agree, or at least we assume as a matter of
antitrust lav;, that if you have more competitors you have
more competition.

If you've only got one or two competitors,

you are less likely to have strong competition in a market
than if you have ten or fifteen, in most markets, in most
circumsfences at leas t.
However, what is true of actual competitors is not
necessarily true of potential competitors.

Potential

competitor exerts whatever influence he exerts by virtue of
the perception of those in the market.

The perception of

those or, in the case of the actual potential competitor,
as a future possibility.
But idle perception of those in the market is
obviously fastened on the No. 1 possible entrant.

And whether

there are fifteen or twenty or thirty lined up behind him
would seam to make very little difference.
Indeed, if you will look at the economic literature
on the subject, it does indeed say, and there is even some
recognition in the decisions of this Court that the significant

60

potential entrant is the most likely potential entrant, and
maybe -this holds true of the first or second, I don’t know
how far down the line you go, but after you pass one or two
potential entrants, those in line behind really lose all
significance.
QUESTION;

I suggest you won't find that in the cases

with respect — except with respect to perceived entries.
Can you suggest where it is, with respect to actual?
MR. LOEVINGER:

Well, it is — the cases refer to the

most likely entrant, Mr. Justice White.
QUESTION; Well, those are cases where
MR. LOEVINGER: And I don’t —
QUESTION;

■— with respect to perceived entry.

MR. LOEVINGER:

This may well — this may be the

discussion in those cases, I don’t recollect with that degree
of sharpness, but the distinction between the actual, the
perceived arid the dominant potential entrants is something
that really didn't emerge until your Falstaff decision.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. LOEVINGER; Consequently, these distinctions
are not drawn in the earlier decisions.
And that, indeed, I am not sure that this is -the
case. For example, in the leading case, the El Paso case,
•«■dsns***

*

it's perfectly obvious that the Northwest Pipeline Company was
the most likely entrant, because there were in there just

61

trying their hardest to get into the market. There isn't any
question that they were an actual potential entrant in every
sense, and I think that the matter was well summarised in the
words of the Court;

unsuccessful bidders are competitors no

less significantly than successful ones.
And this really is the genesis of the whole potential
competition doctrine.
QUESTIONs

For the well perceived entrant.

MR. LOEVINCER; They were perceived, indeed, yes.
And, as I say, I think the distinction between actual and
the perceived entrant was hot drawn until we came to Falstaff.
Now, it is interesting that plaintiff argues that
commercial banks are significantly different than savings
Banks and should be excluded 'from the line of commerce.
And yet plaintiff, or the Department also argues the
importance of business financing by commercial banks is what
makes them significant and makes them — and gives them their
particularly unique quality.
Yet when we come around and talk about the
advantages of these mergers, when we talk about the services
and the competition to be secured from these mergers, the
Department tell us that, well, this is just a matter of
convenience and needs and doesn't have anything to do with
competition.
Now, I submit they can't have it both ways.

If it

62

is business financing, business services that make commercial
banking a unique line cf commerce for the antitrust laws,
which have to do with competition and competition only,
then they can't turn around and say:

But, when you show us

that a merger gives you greater services to the business
community, that's unimportant for purposes of competition.
If it's important for purposes of distinguishing
the line of commerce as a line, as a competitive line of
commerce, it is also important for appraising the effects of
the merger upon competition, in the line of commerce as well
as tiie section of the country.
Now, the Department also argues that competitive
effect may be found in a section of the country that is not
a market.
me.

I confess that there is part of this that eludes

I've always understood from all the prior decisions of

this Court, and I have searched the decisions of this Court
on this subject, that section of the country and relevant
geographic market were used synonymously ? in some cases one
is used after the other in parentheses.

This Court has never

differentiated, and what it said in the Phi1adeIphia Bank
case was that we were to look to the area in which the impact
of the merger would be felt, in order to determine the
relevant geographic market or the section of the country.
Now, that is what the court did here.

The court

said that in the State of Connecticut there are two dominant

63

Statewide banks, Hartford and CBT, and that if we permit this
merger there will be another Statewide bank that will increase
the number of Statewide competitors to three, therefore the
impact of the merger will be felt in the State as a section
of the country.
That is why it looked to this.
Now, this doesn't, mean that -there aren't local
markets.

I think that's a complete non sequitur.

There may

well be local markets, if two banks within New Haven or
within Bridgeport were seeking to merge, I think we might well
look to Bridgeport or New Haven as markets, because that's
where the impact of the merger would be felt.
But simply because the impact is felt on the
State level, the court properly applying the teachings of this
Court in Philadelphia said that's where I look to see what
impact this merger is going to have.
To conclude from this that every firm within that
market is necessarily an actual competitor is again a
complete non sequitur.

And as in my brief, I referred to

Von's Grocery, although I think it's a little easier for me
to talk about the Washington metropolitan area, because I
know it better.
In Washington as in Los Angeles there are half a
dosen — I don't know hew many, but a certain number of grocery
chains that compete throughout the metropolitan area.

We're

64

all familiar with them.

I don’t need to name them.

We

probably buy groceries -there every day.
These are competitors, and there's no doubt in my
mind that the metropolitan area, as in Los Angeles, is a
relevant market with respect to possible merger of these
grocery chains.
This doesn't mean that a grocery store in Bethesda
is a competitor of one in Alexandria or one in Silver Spring
is a competitor in Bethesda or Alexandria or Falls Church or
anywhere else.

And yet these communities are separated no

further than Bridgeport and Neva Haven.
To say that we have a relevant geographic market
for purposes of a merger case does not mean that every firm
within that market is an actual competitor, and the argument
which is founded upon that attempt at logic is utterly
without foundation and is a complete non sequitur.
QUESTION: Well, Mr. Loevinger, the statute talks
about lessening of — when the effect may be to lessen
competition in any section of the country.
MR, LOEVINGER:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: And I would agree with your understanding
that "section of the country" is equivalent of "geographic
market" phrase you find in court opinions and so on. But the
lessening of the competition has to be in the section of the
country or the geographic market, whichever one yon want to

65

choose , which implies that there is competition in -that
geographic market, and that’s its relevance, isn't it?
MR. LOEVIi'JGER:

That is correct, sir. And in fact

what has been admitted by the Department and what the court
found here is that there is no actual competition at all
between the geographic — between the merging banks.
Therefore, the court said ~™ in fact, the total phrase in
Phi1adeIphia, as I recall, was:

we look to the area of

competitive overlap and the area where the impact of the
merger may be felt.
Since there is no area of competitive overlap,
the court said:

I look to the area where the impact of

the merger may be felt.
QUESTION:

Then he found the whole State.

MR. LQEVINGER:
QUESTION;

And he found the whole State.

And yet he certainly didn’t find that

there was face-to-face competition in the State, he found
just the opposite, didn't he?
MR. LOEVINGER:

That's correct, sir.

Yes, sir,

QUESTION: Well, he found that there was some faceto-face competition, which he promptly got rid of.
QUESTION: Well, yes.
MR.LOEVINGER;

No, there is none involved in the

case as it comes to this Court,
QUESTION:

No, I understand that, but when he looked

66

around he did find face-to-face competition.
MR. LOEVINGER:

Ho, as a matter of fact, the

Comptroller found that and eliminated it, sir.
QUESTION:

Well, all right. But it was there.

MR. LOEVINGER:

There was some that was eliminated,

yes, sir.
QUESTION:

It was there.

MR. LOEVINGER:
QUESTION:

And you might —

It's not here now.

It might have been argued that if the

merger hadn't been proposed, maybe in ten years there would
have been more face-to-face competition in some other sections
of the State.
MR. LOEVINGER:

Indeed, the Department of Justice

tried to argue that, and. that was disproved because of the
home office protection law.
This is one thing —
QUESTION:

But there weren't many open towns left.

MR, LOEVINGER:

There just weren't any places left

where they would enter.
This is one of the interesting aspects of this
case, of these two cases, as they come to this Court, and it's
an aspect which altogether distinguishes both cases from
Breeley, incidentally.

In Breeley, there was simply no

question that the holding company could have entered Breeley
de novo as far as the law is concerned,

I don't comment on

67
the economic factors.

But clearly they could have entered

Brae ley, so far as the lav; is concerned.
In both of these cases there are legal barriers
which would have to ~ which would require to be circumvented
and. I respectfully suggest it is somewhat unseemly of the
Department of Justice to be arguing that the banks should
resort to 3.egal stratagems to circumvent the requirements
of the State law, which are designed to protect State banks,,
and to maintain the dual banking system which has given us
the tremendous amount of competition that in fact we do
have now.
Indeed, as Mr. Friedman said *— Mr. Friedman said,
Congress did not give the Comptroller a veto on Section 7.
Let me reply that Congress certainly did not give the
Department of Justice control over banking entry.
On the contrary, it specifically provided that the
Department of Justice should comment only on the competitive
factors involved in bank merger cases, arid that the decision
should be made by the courts, as I have pointed out.

In

Whitney, this Court said that the lower courts should not even
get into this matter, that these are matters for
administrative weighing before they ever come into the court.
And there are a whole series of cases cited in
our brief, beginning with the Walker Bank case, decided by
this Court, in which the courts have said that when any of the

68
banking agencies attempt to evade or circumvent the State
law restrictions which are incorporated by reference by the
federal law, that they are acting beyond their power and
acting improperly and that the courts will prevent them from
doing so.
It seems to me to be unseemly for a government agency
now to be suggesting that the banking agencies or the banks
themselves should be attempting to do that which this Court
has strongly suggested in Walker Bank and other cases that
the banking agencies should not be engaged in.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Loevinger.

Mr. Shapiro, you have five minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD E. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF 'HIE APPELLANT
MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Your Honor.

First, I'd like to address the question of the
markets.

Dr. Peck, whose study of potential entrants was

referred to by Mr. Reycraft, conceded that his study did not
undertake a study of banking markets;

he simply looked at

towns as geographic entities.
He also stated that he did not consider the question
of the effect of actual entry.

He was simply looking at

potential entrants from the standpoint of the so-called
perceived effect.
And finally he said, at the close of his cross-

69
examination, that, he wasn' t at all concerned with concentra­
tion, he considered it unimportant in banking.
So that I don't think that Dr. Peck's studies really
focused on the market question, that he should have focused
on, in trying to determine who was a potential entrant.
Now, who is a potential entrant?

The government's

theory was that the most significant potential entrants were
in the top ten banks in the State.

Of those top ten banks,

two of them, the big Bridgeport bank, we said were already
in the Bridgeport and Nev/ Haven areas, respectively.
QUESTION:

The big Hartford banks.

MR. SHAPIRO %

The big Hartford banks, I'm sorry,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MS. SHAPIRO:
Bridgeport

Hartford National is actually in

Hartford National is not in Bridgeport, but

it is in Fairfield,

So we say it’s already in the metropolitan

area, and of course the other bank is in both New Haven and
Fairfield.
Now, eliminating the top two, that leaves eight,
a!nd than if you eliminate the banks that are not in New Haven
i

or Bridgeport, you get a very small number left.

And of those,

we then look to see who was large and close by, and the most
obvious entrants were the Bridgeport bank moving over to New
Haven, and the New Haven bank moving over to Bridgeport.

And

70

we said they are the most significant entrants.
Nov;, Mr. Reycraft suggested that -the test should be
whether the banks would have entered but for the merger.
But we suggest that that test would be a test of certainty,
which would not fit the purposes of Section 7.

The real

test is whether -- the test that would fit the purposes of
Section 7, is whether if the merger route is closed,, it is
probable that the banks would enter, given their incentive
and capacity. And. this is, we think we demonstrated that they
have the incentive and that they had the capacity, that
means of entry did exist if they were encouraged to do it.
And we think this was demonstrated by the experience
of the Connecticut National attempt to merge with the big
Hartford bank.

The Hartford bank which said it couldn't get

into Bridgeport, did try to get into Bridgeport, and did
succeed in doing so.
In fact, in this case, in addition to offering to
divest themselves of the banks which were the subject of
actual competition in the four-town area, the defendants, at
pages 40 and 41 of -the record, also said that if they were
allowed to merge, they would get themselves into Hartford,
They said if would be difficult legally, but they would
attempt to find a way.
Again proving that if the merger route is closed,
people will seek an alternative.

71
Now, counsel for the Comptroller has set forth what
he views as the difference between the Department of Justice
and his agency over banking policy.
We suggest that it's not a question of banicing policy,
it's a question of whether the Bank Merger Act of 1966, which
makes Section 7 controlling, is going to be controlling as
Congress intended.
In the Comptroller's brief, at page 54, there is
a note 23, which says that he favors merger over entry by
de novo methods or by new charters.

He has an affirmative

policy in favor of mergers.
Now, the Department of Justice, believing that
Section 7 is controlling here, feels that the test is not
whether there is going to be simply local oligopolies immune
from competition by expanding banks, we favor the expansion
of the Statewide bank, we favor its entry into local markets?
that is our policy.
But the question is how it gets in.

If it goes in

on a small basis and has to fight in that local market, it’s
going to upset the status quo, it's going to bring the benefits
of competition to that market.

If it walks in, by buying a

large share, it's going to settle down and we're going to
have, in the local market, the same kind of oligopoly we've
had before.
We encourage de novo entry, we encourage foothold

72
merger? that’s why we have not challenged the expansion by
the big Hartford banks, because they always were careful
to stay on a small scale when they went into new markets»
And to the extent that's happened in Connecticut, we have had
an increase in local diversity, which we favor.
But the question is always, how the expansion is
achieved.
Now, the Comptroller mentioned the» Washington area
as an example of hov; markets should be defined. Well, I
suggest that -the Washington area is a good analogy for
considering a metropolitan area as a banking market.
In this sense;

the suburban banks in Washington

cannot get into the central city. The central city banks cannot
get into the suburbs, and yet there is genuine competition
among those banks.
Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;•

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:08 o' c Jl G OIc g p„m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was aubmitted,1
