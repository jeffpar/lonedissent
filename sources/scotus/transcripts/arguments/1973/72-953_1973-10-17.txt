MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument in

Wo. 72-953, Michael 0sShea against Ezell Littleton.
Mr. O'Rourke, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. O'ROURKE
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, O'ROURKE:

Thank you, your Honor, and may it

please the Court, this is a civil rights suit brought by
plaintiffs on behalf of an undefined class of which they were
not members charging that Michael O'Shea as the magistrate of
the Circuit Court for Alexander County, Illinois, and Dorothy
Spomar, as an associate judge for Alexander County, Illinois,
systematically discriminate against members of their class on
the basis of race.
This action was brought under the Civil Rights Act,
title 42, sections 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1985, and it alleged
interference with the plaintiffs' First, Sixth, Eighth,
Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

The plaintiffs

sought mandatory injunctive relief against O'Shea and Spomer
in their official capacity as members of the Illinois judiciary.
The amended complaint in the

first, second, third, and fourth

claims for relief sat out eleven specific acts of alleged
discriminatory conduct on the part of defendant States Attorney
Berbling and investigator Shepherd.
One claim for relief, which is the six*h claim,

3
which perhains ho the judges comprises generally and conclusory
allegations of patterns and practices of discriminatory conduct
on the part of these defendant judges.
QUESTIONS

Mr. o'Roiirke, just to help me at least

keep tliis cast of characters, which is rather extensive, clearly
in mind, the present prosecutor against whom part of this
injunctive relief is directed was not in office at the time —
MR. O’ROURKE:
QUESTION;

Ho, sir, he was not.

— this began.

And Berbliag and the man

who alleged committed all these acts is out of office, is that
correct?
MR. O'ROURKE:

That is correct, your Honor,

States

Attorney Sportier is not to be confused with the judge, also by

the name

of

Spomar.

iia was

just elected States Attorney of

Alexander County and was substituted in this cause because of —
QUESTION;

Are they related, brothers, or father-son,

or —

MR. O'ROURKE:

I believe that they are husband and

wife, your Honor.
The alleged conduct against the judges includes the
following averments:
QUESTION;

(a)
Let me interrupt you.

lIR, o *ROURKE;

QUESTION:

once more.

Certainly,

Is it clear from your point of view at

least none of the allegations against Sportier, the present

4
District Attorney, that there are no allegations of misconduct
against him?
HR* O’ROURKE:
QUESTION:

lie, sir.

It's the contention

It’s a predecessor and no one else.

MR. O'ROURKE:

That's correct.

And the contention is

that tha office will in the future in some way discriminate.
QUESTION:

So that this is injunctive relief running

against an office rather than a parson, is it?
HR, O’ROURKE:
QUESTION:

That's correct, your Honor.

Well, in the judge’s case, Mrs. Spomer,

Judge Sponger, tha allegations ran against her-, did they not?
MR. O’ROURKE:
QUESTION:

And also as to Magistrate O’Shea?

MR, O'ROURKE:
QUESTION:

Yes, they did.

Yes, sir.

So in that case, at least, the injunction

runs against people based on their alleged misconduct.
MR, O’ROURKE: Well, that's a contention that we don’t
agree with, your Honor.

That is their contention, however, we

do not agree with it.
QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

The Chief Justice's inquiry relates to the

next case rather than to this one.
MR. O’ROURKE;

That's right.

The alleged conduct against the judges includes the
f ol lowing a3.legations:

5
(a)

The judges involved set bond in criminal cases

by following an unofficial bond schedule without regard to the
facts of the case or the circumstances of the individual
defendant..
(b)

That, they sentence black persons to longer

criminal tarns and imposed harsher conditions than they do with
respect to white persons who are charged with the same or
equivalent cx*iininal conduct.
(c)

That they require plaintiffs and members of the

class to pay for a trial by jury when charged with violations
of city ordinances which carry fines and possible jail penalty
if the fine cannot be paid.
Though the amended complaint alleges in paragraph 36(b)
that O'Shea and Spomer sentenced black persons to longer terms
and imposed harsher conditions than for white persons similarly
charged, the complaint doss not mention a single instance of
such conduct in the past nor does it charge that any sentence
was not within the judge's lawful discretion.

Indeed, no

plaintiff is alleged to have been among those charged, bailed,
or sentenced.
Furthermore, no plaintiff is alleged to be threatened
with the possibility of requiring bail or being sentenced.
The plaintiffs do not set forth any fact or allege a single
instance of improper bail procedure or excessive sentence in
the amended complaint.

6
Moreoverr no other allegation of plaintiffs* complaint
evidences or supports the conclusory allegations in the Sixth
Claim for Relief against the defendant judges.
The plaintiffs additionally do not indicate any
request for relief either by habeas corpus or by appellate review
which has been made by any member of their class or by anyone
else for past judicial discrimination by either of the
defendant judges.
The allegations regarding the setting of bonds and
tlia payment for jury trials do not state that respondents axe
treated differently than any other persons.

It is merely

averred in general terras that the petitioners follow an
unofficial bond schedule in criminal cases; no charge is made,
as has been done with respect to sentencing practices, that
there exists discrimination in the treatment of white and
bins?]-: persons.

The sole issue as drawn by the pleadings

relates only to the allegation of the judge's discretionary
role in imposing sentence on a lawfully convicted defendant.
The complaint is completely barren of any factual averment
involving the defendant judges and contains only one allegation
of discrimination by the judges, and that is relative to the
sentencing practice, and thi3 allegation is alleged only on
information and belief.
The District Cotart dismissed the Complaint on grounds
(1) that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain a cause seeking

7
to have ci federal court; substitute its judgment for the
judgment

of the State judiciary, and (2) that in the regular

performance of judicial officers' duties, judicial immunity
barred relief in an action under the Civil Rights Act.
Th© Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit in a two-tc*one decision reversed the judgment of the District Court and
ruled that a Federal court may entertain actions requiring
Federal supervision and regulation by mandatory injunction over
the discretion which State court judges may lawfully exercise
within the limits of the authority granted to them by law.
The Court of Appeals held:

(1) that the Complaint

stated a cause of action against these petitioners under
the Civil Rights Act, sections 1981, 1933, and perhaps under
1982; and (2) the doctrine of judicial immunity did not extend
to defendant judges in the light of the legislative history
or the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871
where injunctive relief is sought.
The Seventh Circuit recognizing that its holding
created a case of first impression, volunteered guidelines
which the Federal District Court might follow in imposing
upon the State judges a system of reporting their conduct and
tiie disposition of their casas to the District Court.
We submit that the decision of the Seventh Circuit
Court of Appeals would permit the intimidation of State court
judges and would deprive the State of independent and

8
intellectually free judicial system.

If; is our contention that

the common law doctrine of providing civil judicial immunity
for judicial acts was not abolished by the Congressional Civil
Rights Amendment regardless of whether the damages are
mandatory or monetary damages are sought,
This Court established, in the classic case of
Bradley v. Fisher, v/hich we cite very extensively in our brief,
that the purpose of judicial immunity is to assure the indepen­
dence of the judicial judgment by precluding personal jeopardy
of judges vrho might err.
We submit that the sanctions of contempt are as
dangerous to judicial .independence as the risk of a suit for
raonav damages.

One cannot visualize a more dramatic example of

judicial subordination than the

spectacle of having a state

judge brought before a Federal district court on the claim of
injunction and put through the ignominity of having to sit on
the witness stand defending the integrity of his character and
his actions and be subjected or#

cross-examination to the

verbal onslaught of a class of people as in this particular
instance who had never been before that particular judge at.
any time.
■j

QUESTION;

Mr. O'Rourke, —

MR. O'ROURKES
QUESTION;

Yes, Mr. Justice.

As I understand the argument you are

making, now, you go beyond really a position Judge Dillon took

9

in dissent.

As I understood his dissent, ha would not say

categorically that you could never have an injunction under
1983 against a judicial officer, but that in thi3 particular
type of situation, you couldn't have it.

But you say you can

never have it?
MR* O'ROURKES
please,

No, I don't say that, if the Court

I don't mean to leave that impression.

Judge Dillon

did review the cases where injunctions had been granted and
pointed out that injunctions had been granted for the — a
prohibitory type of injunction rather than a mandatory injunction
which prohibits the court from, and in these particular instances
that they cite which were ministerial acts rather than judicial
acts requiring judicial discretion.
QUESTIONS

So that there you wouldn't have the' over­

hanging threat of a contempt citation in your —
MR. O'ROURKE:

No, sir, you would not.

It would be

a prohibitive act and not the constant supervision where the
judge could be called in and be subjected to cross-examination.
While on that Federal stand, the stato judge could foe compelled
to recall his past decisions and the reasoning behind those
decisions.

In an instance like the present case, the judge

may not only be on trial with respect to an individual case,
but for patterns and practices which comprise within their
purview many decisions extending through a number of years.
The affect of the decision of the Seventh Circuit would b© to

10

"chill”judicial discretion in the dispensation of justice in
the State of Illinois,

in effect, then, a State judge will

have to look over his shoulder each time he exercises his
judicial discretion for fear that by some nebulous standard
of statistical analysis he has not meted out justice in
accordance with a Federal district judge's personal formula.
In addition, a State judge would be more likely to qualify or
balance sentences or amounts of bail, not in accordance with
what the circumstances are before him, or what the circumstances
would warrant, but out of the nagging fear that leniency or
strictness, irrespective of whether deserved, over a period of
time would be interpreted as deliberate discriminatory conduct.
Subjecting a State judge to Federal review each time
a dissatisfied but lawfully convicted defendant alleges
class discrimination would require Federal judges to conduct
an evidentiary hearing to determine whether a pattern of
discrimination existed.

A judge operating under an order not

to discriminate in fixing bonds and sentencing would find
himself confronted with the possibility of a Federal contempt
citation and the necessity to defend his motivation in each
case.
The admonishment of this court in the City of Greenwood
v. Peacock would apply to this case equally as well.

But the

burden of the Federal system would be, in the least, cumbersome
and sever©.

The effect on the State system would be to create

11
an oppressive atmosphere of Federal supervision and perhaps
render it impotent.
The action countenanced by the court below will result
in the Federal courts sitting not only in review of State
discretionary decisions, but also as an appellate tribunal
passing ultimate judgment on State criminal proceedings.
Though the action sanctioned here is civil, it requires the
review of past criminal decisions.

In addition, the likelihood

is great that similar class actions would be taken to the
district courts from State criminal actions on the grounds that
the judge will or has a propensity to discriminate against a
particular group.

The result would b© to exchange State

remedies in favor of district court review.
Extending the possibilities sanctioned by the court
below to its most absurd result, a State court judge could
literally spend so much time defending his actions in frivolous
suits at the Federal bar that h© could notperform his State
judicial duties.

Again, an admonishment from tha City of

Greenwood v.Peacock case.
It must be noted that the decision of the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit does not limit its holding
to lower State court judges.

Indeed, the application of the

Seventh Circuit's decision renders all State judges subject to
injunctive relief should some class allege that they have
engaged in patterns and practices which they feel violate their

12
civil rights.

Therefor®, this decision, if it is aliowad to

remain in effect, could easily propel a rash of Federal
injunctive proceedings agasint a State appellate court based upon
the

naked allegation that the appellate justices, or any com­

bination of them, engage in patterns and practices of conduct
inimical to the civil rights of the complaining class.
The unfitting burial given to the judicial intraunity
doctrine by the Seventh Circuit irrevocably alters the
historic relationship that has existed between the courts of
equity and law, between Federal and state courts, and between
the judge and those persons appearing before him.

The effect

of permitting actions against the State judiciary, growing out
of the exercise of lavdiul judicial discretion, would be to
irreparably harm the administration of criminal justice at the
Stata level.
We submit that no intellectually independent Stats
judiciary could survive in an atmosphere of hostile litigants
and the constant Federal supervision.
We believe that the question of judicial immunity
had baan — the question of whether judicial immunity nad been
absoiished by the Civil Rights Act was answered by this Court

in Pierson v. Ray which we cite in our brief, that this Court
held that the common lav; immunity of judges from civil actions
for acts committed within their judicial jurisdiction was so
settled a principle as to be excepted from the provisions of

13
section 1983.

Furthermore, this Court in Pierson considered

tli© same legislative history which the court below held to be
30 incisive, and found that history wanting, so much so that
Court states it gives no clear indication that Congress meant
to abolish wholesale all common law immunities,

nr. chief

Justice Warren expressed the feelings of eight members of the
Court when he wrote:
"We presume that Congress would have specifically
so provided had it wished to abolish the doctrine.”
Nothing in the explicit language of Pierson affords
a basis to limit that holding to money damages, especially in
light of the Chief Justice's compelling language which draws
no distinction between monetary and equitable relief.
said, at page 554;

He

"It is a judge's duty to decide all cases

within his jurisdiction that are brought before him, including
controversial casas that arcus© the most intense feelings
in the litigants.

His errors may be corrected on appeal, but

he should not have to fear that unsatisfied litigants may
hound him with litigation charging malice or corruption.
Imposing such a burden on judges would contribute not to
principled and fearless decision-making but to intimidation."
The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit draws
the narrow distinction that while judges are immune from
damages suits, they may be subjected to a mandatory injunction
if aver anyone should charge them in the Federal courts with

14
class discrimination.

The da fondant, judgas submit that no

distinction can logically be mad© as to judicial immunity
between damages and an injunctive order for a judge’s lawful
exercise of his discretion.
The decision of the two-man majority in the court
below is well written, but we submit that a careful reading
of the decision cited by the Seventh Circuit where injunctive
relief has been granted will reveal that these cases either
deal with ministerial duties, exercised by judicial office
or the cases do not discuss the doctrine of judicial immunity
or are ox parte proceedings in which the accused judge did not
participate or are based upon the misapprehension of other
decisions utilized as precedents.
QUESTION:

What about a Federal court enjoining a

Stats criminal proceeding in a 1983 action in the Federal court
alleging that the State criminal proceeding deprived the
defendant of some constitutional right, alleging harassment
or a falsa charge, or something like that, a Dumbrosky type of
situation, and the Federal court wholly consistently with
Younger enjoins the State criminal prosecution?

Would you say

that the prosecution could be enjoined but not the judge?
MR* O’ROURKE:

Yes.

There is a difference there, if

the Court please,
QUESTION;

He can just work on the parties?

MR, O’ROURKE:

There there is the prohibitory injunction

15
againf and here the injunction as has come down from the Seventh
Circuit, is the mandatory type of thing.
QUESTIONs

Well, is there something in — there is

nothing in Pierson that says that a prohibitory injunction can
be entered either.
MR. O'ROURKE:
QUESTION:

Well, how do you distinguish that?

MR. O'ROURKE:
various courts.

No, sir, not in Pierson.

It has been distinguished in the

We indicate that the essence of the rule of

judicial immunity is the freedom of the judge from the threat
of individual punishment in the event that a different court
should decide that his judgment wasn't correct in the first
place.

And we maintain that it's unrelated to the nature of

the suit, whether it's a civil rights action or whether it's
an individual action, or whether it's an action brought by
an individual or by a class.
QUESTIONs

I suppose that State court judges enjoined *—

along the line of Justice White's question — from carrying out
a certain prosecution even though he may be enjoined by name,
there is no doubt a3 to what his duty is under the terms of
that injunction.

He must simply desist unless it's reversed

by a higher court.
What you are complaining about here, I take it, is
the constant oversight of the discretion in cases unnamed.
MR, O’ROURKE:

Yes, that's correct, your Honor.

No.

There are a number of remedies.

But you would at least insist that one of

the Negroes who suffered from the discriminatory sentence be

It wouldn't be any use to have any member of the

public bringing the action.
MR, O'ROURKE:

That's correct,

And then here, it's just any member of the

public, isn't it, in a sense that none of these particular
plaintiffs has ever suffered any kind of a sentence or wrong
from these judges.
MR, O'ROURKE:

■ HR. O'ROURKE:
QUESTION:

I don't have one.

All right.

HR* O'ROURKE:

Also, to get to the question of the -- the

Constitution of the United States provides in Article IV,
section 4, that the United States shall guarantee every State
a republican form of government.

Essential to the concept of

republican form of government is the State judiciary remains
free to pass upon its own laws without fear of district court
surveillance.

Where a pattern emerges or is allowed to emerge

State judicial officers can be summoned before a Federal district
court on the mere allegation that they engage in the patterns
or practices of conduct somehow inimical to the class, then th®
obvious result will be the destruction of the State judiciary
and thereby the republican form of government.

QUESTION*

Which one of the plaintiffs?

MR. WISEMAN?

Your Honor, I submit that we have in

general covered that by saying the plaintiffs.

Whan we were

filing a lawsuit against six defendants, we did not break it
down as to which plaintiffs were affected by the conduct1

of

which defendant except with respect to the States Attorney and
Mr, Shepherd,

then we should have a right to amend• our complaint because we
can specify the individuals who have been directly affected by
name if we had to.
QUESTION?

Now, you do specify some individuals, at

least with respect to the prosecutor defendants.

QUESTION:

That's in the Barbling complaint?

MR* WISEMANs

Yes.

But, your Honor, we have simply

one complaint which covers all of the defendants.

I submit,

your Honor, that we have pleaded the essential allegations for
an action under these statutes.

We have stated that these

plaintiffs hav® been discriminated against; we have stated that
the defendants hav© acted under cover of State law customer
usage; we have stated that the plaintiffs have been deprived
of certain enumerated rights; and we have stated specifically
the binds of rights we are talking about with respect to the
judges;

the setting of bond in which they use an unofficial

bond schedule; the setting of sentences in which they sentence
blacks for longer terms than whites; and the imposition of a
jury fee in certain kinds of cases which are not imposed upon
against whites.
QUESTION;

You can see, though, our problem, can’t
Here the Seventh Circuit has decided some

28
very complex legal questions, and your complaint is at best,
it seems to me, ambiguous as to whether any of your particular
plaintiffs in the judges’ case have actually suffered these
deprivations themselves.
MR, WISEMAN:

I think, your Honor, on© way the Seventh

Circuit handled that with respect to seme of our allegations
going to Mr. Berbling, whose petition is pending before this
Court,

is that we could have the right to amend our complaint

if necessary if the District Court 'thought it was necessary in that
context.

I think it’s important the Seventh Circuit is extremely

cognizant of what’s going on in Cairo.
QUESTION:

Cairo is located —

Counsel, you don’t want us to decide the

case on the basis of the judicial notice that judges in Chicago
take of soma things that are going on in Illinois, do you?
MR. WISEMAN:

I don’t think it’s necessary, your

Honor, because I think in our complaint we have alleged in part
what is happening in Cairo, that there is a considerable amount
of tension between whites and blacks.

Because of its location

it has had a history of civil strife that since the 1950*s
these plaintiffs have been striving to obtain equal opportunity
in employment and housing and participation in governmental
affairs.

This has created strife in the community.

And the

local officials who, if they applied th© law even-handedly,
could help the problem instead of exacerbating it in that they
engage in this pattern and practice of discrimination.

29
QUESTION:

Well, that's all set out in your complaint.

So with or without judicial notice, the Court of Appeals assumed
that all
we.

those well-pleaded allegations were true, and so do

So wa assume

what you say, that there is a very bad

situation in Cairo as s»tr out and fully described in your
complaint.

And that takes us — so we accept and assume that,

but that still doesn't solve some of the problems in this case.
QUESTION:

Given what you have just suggested about

the flexibility, liberality of pleading under the Federal rules,
I am surprised you don't argue that your complaint says, when
you refer to plaintiffs, that it should be read as meaning
plaintiffs and each of the plaintiffs, or that there is an
implied adjective "each plaintiff.”

And then at least we get

on to the heart of some of the other problems in this case,
I'm not. sure that solves your problem, but you have got a lot
of important points here besides th© important one w© have
been discussing.
MR, WISEMAN:

I believe I would adopt th© language

you are suggesting, your Honor,

I believe we have stated a

claim under the statutes,in that section 1981 provides that
all persons shall be subject to like punishments, penalties,
and exactions as white persons.

The Congress at th© time

they passed the statute must have been considering judges who
would be th® ones who would be subjecting persons to punishments,
penalties and exactions.

I don't believe that the judicial

30
immunity applies to judges when we are talking about suits in
equity.

The case of Bradley v. Fisher that is so heavily

relied upon by the petitioners is not applicable to this case.
First, it was not decided under the Civil Rights statutes;
second, it was an action in damages; third, it was an isolated
case involving a lawyer who had bean taken off th© rolls of
attorneys.

And, indeed, th© court in giving the broad language

that it did as to the independence of the judiciary in that
decision could not have meant that it applied to judges when
we are talking about suits in equity because at th© same time
it decided that case, it decided the case of Ex Parte Bradley
which is at 7 Wall. 364.

And in that case, the United Stats3

Supreme Court issued a writ of mandamus to the then Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia compelling that court to
restore Mr. Bradley to the rolls of attorneys.

We are not asking a court to infringe upon the lawful

do is to prohibit a judge from doing that which he has no right
to do,

We have simply asked that a judge, that these judges

be enjoined from using race as a criterion in the exercise of
their office.

We have not asked the Court to tell the judge

what sentence he must impose; we have not asked the Court to

QUESTION:

Will that be less so if you get to trial

on this case?
MR. WISEMAN:

It will not be loss so on this case,

but if we prevail in this case and prove our facts, that should
end the problem.

If you had it on a case-by-casa basis, then

the next defendant would have to do the same thing and you
would continue on infinitum.

Moreover, it would not prevent

the ongoing discrimination that is occurring.

Intentionally and knowingly.

MR, WISEMAN:

I would suggest (1) that if a judge

does violate a Federal court order of that nature intentionally
and wilfully and not inadvertently, then he should be subject
to the contempt powers of the court.
Second, I would suggest wa could not go into the
Federal court on a show-cause order simply on an isolated

We are going to have to

And I would submit to the Court that the Federal

court after hearing the parties, after weighing th® credibility
of the witnesses and evaluating the evidence would then be able
to bs in a better position to fashion appropriate relief.

And

he could put certain limitations on our coming in to find a
judge in contempt.

Obviously, that's a serious thing, but we

are making serious charges here.

And the judge certainly would

have the power to require us to come in to show again a pattern

QUESTIONi

May I ask you at this point who would be

entitled under your definition of the class or classes here to
coma in and request a contempt citation for the judge?

Your

class is defined as all financially poor persons and all black
citizens.

It's a rather extensive and amorphous class, as I

am sure you would agree.

Does that mean any black citizen in

Cairo or anybody who could prove h© was relatively poor could
request a contempt citation?

QUESTIONs

would act to request a contempt citation for a judge?
HR, WISEMAN:

The named plaintiffs and members of the

class as ultimately determined by the District Court could

for a finding of contempt that he allege that a series of

We are seeking to

terminate this pattern and practice of racial discrimination.
The discriminatory practices are deeply engrained in Cairo,

QUESTION:

Does the Supreme Court of Illinois have

supervisory power under the Illinois Constitution and practice?
I1R. WISEMAN!

It's not clear, your Honor, whether

the Supreme Court of Illinois could mandamus these judges in
this kind of way.
QUESTION;

Haven't they exercised supervisory power

in past cases?
MR.WISEMAN:

Yes, your Honor, but it has involved a

different kind of issue.

It has generally involved -the

personal misbehavior of a judge in cases such as bribery or
criminal conduct of tills kind.
QUESTION:

Don't you characterise this as misbehavior

of the judge?
MR, WISEMANs

Yes, I do, your Honor, but I don't

believe it's clear under Illinois law that the Illinois Supreme
Court could intervena.

concepts of federalism, that there is some obligation to find

The Federal remedy

It is a remedy specifically provided
To read that statute plainly, it

gives us a cause of action in Federal court to intervene.

Granted rthe concept of comity should temper the exercise of
federal injunctive powers.

But in this kind of case, where you

have a pattern and practice, where the State is engaged in
something that it has no right to do, where it is engaged in

a conduct that is not insulated from judicial review, the
Federal courts have an obligation to intervene.
QUESTIONi

Mr. Spomer substituted himself when he became Statas Attorney

to engage in racial discrimination.

States,

the defendants.

in thinking that you don’t within the limits of your complaint
allege any efforts to pursue State court remedies, such as

That is correct, your Honor.

REBUTTAL ORGAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. O'ROURKE
OK BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. O’ROURKEs

Thank you, your Honor.

If the Court please, again we would like to point out
that nowhere in the complaint as the Court has indicated in
asking the questions do we find that any plaintiff that has
been named has been brought before this Court has been charged,
bailed ©r sentenced.

Furthermore, there is not one single

instance pleaded within the complaint of discriminatory
practice.

Counsel has indicated that there has been a pattern

and practice over the years of discriminatory conduct.

It

could be vary easily shown that if there is such a, pattern or
practice, that there are individual instances that there are
differences between the pattern of sentencing between white and

black.
We submit: that we read the complaint: - as far as the
sentencing charge not that there is a discrimination between
white and black persons as far as bail is concerned, but that
only that they use an unofficial bond schedule in criminal
cases, And that’s solely it.

We also submit that the allegation

as have been charged here in a civil rights case, that the
holdings of the courts have been that in civil rights action
the p3.ead.ings must be specific.

In the case People <ax r©l.

Hog© v, Bolsingar is such a cas© that hold these pleadings be
specific.
We maintain that nowhere in any of the pleadings and
nowhere in the argument has there been any allegation made
that tries© particular judges, O’Shea and Spomer, have been
guilty of a discriminatory act relative to white and black
persons.

Mr* Wiseim's argument, they have the information which would

I would say that in those specific

instances, if there were such specific instances, that the
remedies we have within our State court system would be able to
take care of that.
We also point out that —
QUESTION:

That’s another argument.

But as to the

sufficiency of the pleadings, what he has in effect told us,
I gather, is that he could amend this to specify everything.

What do you have to say about the suggestion

I mad© to counsel that reading of the pleadings th© way we tend
to read them is that under the Federal rules, plaintiffs means

MR. O'ROURKE?

This goes with the argument I started

to make, if the Court please, that if they got specific in
eleven specific instances, as far as th© States Attorney is
concerned, they could very easily have gotten spacific as far
as the judges are concerned.

As a matter of fact, those eleven
