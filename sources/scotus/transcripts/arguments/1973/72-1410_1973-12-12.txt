MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 72-1410, Edelman against Jordan.
You may proceed whenever you're ready, Mr.
O’Rourke.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. O'ROURKE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.
MR. O'ROURKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
John Jordan, the plaintiff-respondent in this case,
filed a complaint in the United States District Court for
the Northern cistrict of Illinois, individually and as
representative of a class, seeking injunctive relief and
damages for violations of the federal welfare regulations
against former directors of the Illinois Department of
Public Aid in the State of Illinois, and other county officials
charged with administrating the welfare program.
Specially, the plaintiffs allege that certain
sections under the Illinois Categorical Assistance Manual
were invalid, being inconsistent with the thirty-day and
the sixty-day determination requirements as defined by the
regulations of the United States Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare.
The defendants in this matter denied the
allegations, the material allegations of the complaint»

4
The welfare program involved is the Aid to the
Aged, Blind and Disabled and is one of the categorical
assistance programs that is administered by the Illinois
Department of Public Aid,, under the Illinois Public ZvLd
Code.
The program is funded fifty percent by the State,
and the other fifty percent is provided by the Federal
Government under the Social Security Act.
The Illinois Department of Public Aid issued
regulations pursuant to statute, setting up eligibility
and payment requirements, and the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, which administers the welfare
program for the Federal Governme'nt, promulgated regulations
pursuant to to the Social Security Act, setting up time
limitations for the determination of eligibility and the
payments of benefits.
The plaintiffs in this action contended that the
Illinois Department of Public Aid was required to process
all applications for welfare assistance for the aged and
the blind within thirty days, and for the disabled within
sixty days of the initial application.
Having failed to process such applications within
the specified time, so plaintiffs contended, the plaintiff
class was entitled to monetary award, commencing on July
1st, 1963, which is the date that the Federal regulations

went into effect, to be computed by the amount of money
the members of the class would have received had the
applications been processed within the thirty- and the sixtyday requirement.
Wow, the defendants never claimed that all such
applications were processed within the thirty and the sixty
days.

Indeed, the defendants pointed out that some

applications take longer to process than others, because
of various factors which must be determined in order to
establish eligibility for the particular applicants.
The District Court granted summary judgment for the
plaintiffs, and entered a judgment that provided, among
other things, that the Illinois Department of Public Aid be
permanently enjoined from failing to make a determination of
eligibility and payment within the thirty days of initial
application for aid to the aged and blind, and within sixty
days of the initial application for the disabled under the
Illinois Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled program.
The District Court also found for the plaintiffs
on the monetary award question.

It required the

defendants to make all payments not made to the applicants
who had applied to the Illinois Department of Public Aid
for benefits between July 1st, 1968, the day the Federal
regulations went into effect, and April 16th, 1972, the date
that the District Court entered a preliminary injunction

6

mandating the Illinois Department of Public Aid to make the
payments within the thirty days.
For the aged and the blind applicants who did not
receive their initial benefit check within thirty days
from the date of application, the order provided for the
payment of a sum of money equal to the assistance they would
have received for the period beginning on the thirtieth day
from the date of application up to the date their entitlement
became effective.
For the disabled there were two different dates,
because of the fact of the change of the regulations during
the course of this cause of action.

But, in effect, the

order provided for the payment of money equal to the
assistance they would have received for the period beginning
either with the forty-fifth day or the sixtieth day,
depending upon the date of the entitlement or the date of
the application, to the date that they actually received
their first benefit.
Appeal followed in the Court of Appeals, and this
appeal was based substantially on the same grounds that are
raised in the instant petition for a writ of certiorari to
this Court.
In particular, it was pointed out that an action
for a monetary aware filed against State officials in their
official capacity, the award to be discharged out of the

7
General Revenue Fund of the State of Illinois, could not be
maintained in the Federal District Court in view of the
provisions of the Eleventh Amendment to the United States
Constitution.
The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this
contention, and found that a retroactive money award given
to welfare recipients did not contravene the prohibitions of
the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.
It is respectfully submitted that a suit seeking
payment of a money award from the General Revenue Fund of
the State by a class of welfare recipients sounding in equity,
whether it be characterized as restitution or damages, is
within the clear meaning of the Eleventh Amendment, and
hence the judgment of the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Illinois, and the opinion and
mandate of the Seventh Circuit, as they apply to the monetary
award, should be reversed by this Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. O'Rourke, —

MR. O'ROURKE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

--- of course in recent years there have

been a lot of cases in the desegregation area, where school
districts have been compelled to take steps to desegregate,
which necessitate the expenditure of funds.
busing, and other things.
MR. O'ROURKE:

Yes, sir.

I'm thinking of

3

QUESTION:

Do you think those are within the

Eleventh Amendment area?
MR. O'ROURKE:

Mo, sir, I do not, and this Court

has so held, I believe.

Because of the fact that there is

a prospective application of the lav;, the prospective
application of the monetary award; but particularly those
claims were brought under the due process and equal
protection clauses of the Constitution.
We have a situation here that is a clear
violation of the Constitution, -those provisions.
Here we have a violation, if any, of the
regulations of the Social Security Administration, which are
statutory regulations, which would require the payment of
retroactive benefits.
QUESTION;

Then there is another area developing

of late, and that's where attorney's fees are allowed in
civil rights cases.
MR. O’ROURKE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Do you feel this is also distinguishable

from this case?
MR. O'ROURKE;

I really don't feel it is

distinguishable, I believe that the Court has never
addressed itself to the Eleventh Amendment prohibition for
the awarding of these fees.

I believe there was one case,

and I can't think of the name of it right now, but it was

9

awarded as a deterrent to the defendants in that case,
because of the fact that they had complicitly, did not obey
the court's order.
QUESTION:

But there had been a contempt citation.
Mr. O'Rourke, are you suggesting that

this Court has complicitlv said the Eleventh Amendment was
repealed or limited in some way by the Fourteenth?
MR. O'ROURKE:

No, I'm not.

There is an argument

to thrvt effect, of course, and the respondents, I believe,
will make that argument.

But I believe that the Eleventh

Amendment, of course, as it applies to the States but not as
it applies to individuals, would not be circumvented.
QUESTION:

That's in the NAACP brief, particularly,

is it not?
MR. O'ROURKE;

Yes, sir, it is.

The whole NAACP brief, amicus in this case, goes
into the reconstruction statutes.

It indicates that there

has been a superseding of the Eleventh Amendment by the
Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.
QUESTION: Well, hasn't this Court affirmed some
retroactive welfare payments?
MR. O'ROURKE;

Yes, sir, they have summarily

affirmed.
QUESTION:

But I suppose you suggest that the

issue was never raised or flushed with respect to the
Eleventh Amendment?

I thought they were.

10

MR. O'ROURKE:

These were raised in briefs, but

the Court had never addressed itself to the question,
QUESTION:

Well, we just summarily rejected the

Eleventh Amendment arguments —
MR. O'ROURKE;
QUESTION;

—- at least two or three times.

MR. O'ROURKE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, that's correct.

So your argument, I don't recall your

brief, is that really they're not precedents at all?
MR. O'ROURKE:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I didn't

hear you.
QUESTION:

I think your argument, I don't recall

your brief, is that summary affirmance is no precent for
anything.
MR. O'ROURKE:
QUESTION;

It's like a denial of certiorari.

MR. O'ROURKE:
sir.

Well, —

It's a denial of certiorari, yes,

And there's arguments on both sides of that question,

of course.

Rothstein vs. Wyman, which is a Second Circuit

Court opinion.

Many of the jurisdictions hold the fact

that this Court did not entertain certiorari in that case
sets a precedent that the Eleventh Amendment argument is a
valid argument.
The other side we've argued in our case, due to
the fact that the Seventh Circuit has rejected the Eleventh

11
Amendment argument.
Rothstein vs. Wyman is a, bring it up, is a Second
Circuit case, which dealt with the same subject matter that
was involved here.

Yet, contrary to the decision of the

Seventh Circuit Court in this case, the Second Circuit, in
Rothstein, held that the Eleventh Amendment barred an action
in the United States District Court for the release of
benefits supposedly wrongfully withheld.
There the Second Circuit went into a long examina­
tion of this Court's opinion in Rosado vs. Wyman, and the
fact that pursuant to Rosado vs. Wyman the only remedy
afforded by the Social Security Act was the withholding
of Federal funds from the State, in that it was not a
personal thing to the welfare recipients.

And the Second

Circuit held, on that basis, that there was an improper
exercise of equity jurisdiction by the lower coxirt in
awarding retroactive benefits.
The State, however, in the appeal, raised the
Eleventh Amendment, which provides that a federal judicial
power did not extend to suits against the State, and the
Court, in Rothstein vs. Wyman, held that the point was well
taken, that in so far as retroactive payments are concerned,
it is in truth a suit against the State of New York, which
the State of New York had never consented to.
The Court, in the Rothstein case,

then stated, and

12

I quote:

"It is one tiling to tell the Commissioner of Social

Services that he must comply with Federal standards for the
future, if the State is to have tie benefit of Federal
funds in the programs he administers, it’s quite another
thing to order the Commissioner to use funds to make
reparation for the past.
"The latter, it would appear to us, would fall
afoul of the Eleventh Amendment if that basic constitutional
provision is to be conceived as having any present force."
That is the end of my quotation,
The respondents argue in their brief that the
petitioners in this cause of action failed to raise the
Eleventh Amendment argument on the defense in the trial
court, and only alleged it for the first time in the
Seventh Circuit.
Now, the Seventh Circuit did not find this
argument sufficiently sound so as to preclude its own
analysis of the applicability of the Eleventh Amendment
argument.
It is admitted by your petitioners that it did not
raise the Eleventh Amendment defense in the trial court,
but contends that there was no language in respondents'
complaint from which the Eleventh Amendment defense could
be anticipated as the thrust of the plaintiffs’ complaint
was for declaratory and injunctive relief.

13
Now, it would have been futile for Illinois to
have raised the Eleventh Amendment argument with respect to
the application of the law.
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll resume there at

one o'clock.
[Whereupon, at 12 o'clock, noon, the Court, was
recessed, to reconvene at 1:00 o'clock, p.m., the same
day. ]

14
AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:00 p.m.]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. O'Rourke, you may

resume.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. O'ROURKE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. O'ROURKE:

[Resumed]

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
At the recess I was just indicating to the Court
that the thrust of the plaintiffs' complaint in this
cause of action was for declaratory and injunctive relief.
We maintain that it would have been futile for the State
of Illinois to have raised 'the Eleventh Amendment argument
with respect to prospective applications of the lav/.
The application of the fiction of Ex Parte Young
was and is quite clear.

Clearly, the Eleventh Amendment

does not prohibit Federal Courts from ordering State
officials to bring their conduct into conformity with the
federal law.
Therefore, no question was entertained about
this District Court's jurisdiction to enter a declaratory
judgment or a mandatory injunction compelling future
conformity with the administration of the Illinois Public
Welfare Program with the Federal Statutes and the Federal
Regulations.

15

Furthermore, the Illinois Assistant Attorney
General who appeared on behalf of the Illinois Department of
Public Aid in the trial court as a matter of law could not
waive -the Eleventh Amendment argument.

This follows through

with the Sovereign Immunity doctrine, and in our State the
law is quite clear, both case law and thjrough the
Constitution, that the only one that can waive these
arguments are the State Legislature itself.
In Ford Motor Company vs. the Treasury Department
of the State of Indiana, Justice Reed, in delivering the
opinion of the Court, stated:
"The objection to Petitioner's suit as a violation
of the Eleventh Amendment was first made and argued by
Indiana in this Court.

This was in time, however.

The

Eleventh Amendment declares a policy and sets forth an
explicit limitation on the Federal judicial power of such
compelling force that this Court will consider the issue
arising under this amendment in this case even though urged
for the first time in this Court."

End of quote.

What is in controversy in this case are the
limitations of the application of the Ex Parte Young fiction.
It is submitted that if a suit seeks to declare
a liability which must be met from the General Revenue Fund
of the State, which is mandated by its own constitution, of
matching its cost with its anticipated revenue, then

16

Federal courts are without jurisdiction to entertain a suit
without the express consent of the State.
This Court recently stated, in Employees vs.
Missouri Public Health Department, that it was not easy
to infer that Congress in legislating pursuant to the
Commerce Clause, which has grown in vast proportions in its
application, desired silently to deprive the State of an
immunity which they have long enjoyed under another part
of the Constitution.

Thus, we cannot conclude that

Congress conditioned the operation of these facilities on
the forfeiture of an immunity from suit in a federal
form.

I end the quotation.
Similarly there is no language in the Social

Security Administration Act that either expressly or
impliedly shows the intend on the part of Congress to
deprive the States of their immunity under the Eleventh
Amendment.
There is also nothing in the compact between the
Illinois Department of Public Aid and the United States
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare that expressly
conditions Illinois' participation in the federally
assisted programs on its waiver of immunity under the
Eleventh Amendment.
Consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, Congress
enacted an apparently exclusive remedy in the form of the

17
cutoff of future funds when a State failed to conform with
federal law.

And this is found in 42 United States Code 604.

Thera was nothing in this statutory enactment that
provides for an express or an implied right to payment of
retroactive assistance.

The remedy provided is the cutoff

of future funds, no mention being made of a right to
welfare assistance to retroactive payments.
The United States Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare recently sought legislation in the Second
Session of the 91st Congress that would have granted the
right of retroactive assistance to welfare recipients.
This legislation was never enacted, which makes it clear
that Congress never intended to give, and now has rejected
legislative giving, welfare recipients a right to retroactive
assistance.
As was pointed out in this Court in Employees vs,
Missouri Public Health Department,"it is not easy to infer
that Congress in legislating . , . desired silently to
deprive the States of an immunity they have long enjoyed."
In Rothstein vs. Wyman, again the Second Circuit
Court case, the Second Circuit advanced three basic reasons
why retroactive assistance should not be granted.
The first relates to the fundamental principle
of welfare legislation, that of satisfying present ascertained
needs of impoverished people.

18

Recognizing that federal standards are designed
to insure that those needs are equitably met, the
Court properly observed that the passage of time makes such
payments compensatory rather than remedial since the
coincidence between the ascertained and existing need becomes
less clear.
The second reasons or interest noted by the
Rotinsteln Court was that of assuring a proper use of
federal funds.

The Second Circuit Court found that the

interest was not a personal interest to the welfare
recipient since Congress provided that the cutoff of
federal funds was the appropriate remedy.
The third and most compelling reason for implying
a right to retroactive assistance was found to be a wilful
deterrence of State violations of federal laws.

None was

found in the Rothstein context, and we submit that none may
be found in the Illinois context.
QUESTION:

You mentioned earlier, Mr. O'Rourke,

that sometimes, and in certain cases, it takes more time
than perhaps thirty days to make the necessary factual
de termination.
MR. O'ROURKE: Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I don't recall whether in your briefs

you focussed especially on newly arrived residents who would
make claims for relief or other aid under the Shapiro

19

holding.
MR. O’ROURKE:
QUESTION:

No, sir, we did not.

But I should think it might be a special

problem on people who move from Southern California to
New York, or, more likely, from New York to Southern California,
to find out the status of their financial condition and
whatnot.
MR, O'ROURKE:

There are such problems as the

Chief Justice points out. There are other problems, of
course, too, particularly with the disabled and the blind
assistance.

There there is a matter of determining the

extent of the disability and whether or not the person is
disabled.
QUESTION: Well, then what was the purpose of
Congress, as you see it, to fix these rather short time
limits?

Is that just hautitory, advisory?
MR. O'ROURKE:

No.

If the Court please, the

Congress did not set the times, Congress merely indicated
that the determination of the eligibility and the payment
must be reasonably prompt, or determined with reasonable
promptness.

The Department of Health, Education, and

Welfare, in formulating the regulations, then made the
determination ~~
QUESTION:

I meant to refer to their regulations.

MR. O'ROURKE:

Yes, sir.

20

Subsequently, if the Court please, the
determination of time for disabled persons has been extended.
Originally it was forty-five days, then it's been extended
to sixty days.

On October 17th, this year, the Department

of Health, Education, and Welfare promulgated new
regulations that give now forty-five days for the aged and
the blind, but make the payment to go back to the thirtieth
day after the initial application.
There are problems, and they have been recognized.
We do submit in the Appendix various graphs that —- not
graphs, but charts that shew the length of time that Illinois
has had to process some of these applications,
QUESTION: Well, do you think this retroactive
provision of the regulation on aid to the blind is in
conflict with the Eleventh Amendment?
MR, O'ROURKE:

No, sir, not when we have an

effective application of it, and we are complying, Illinois
is complying with that at the present time.
QUESTION: But when the determination is made,
let's assume that the determination is not made for ninety
days, as conceivably might happen, it's effective back to
the thirty-first day, is it not?
MR. O'ROURKE:

Back to the thirtieth day, yes, sir.

Under the present regulation.
There we're able to provide, the State is able,

21
and according to the injunction that was entered in this
matter originally on April 16th, we have been complying with
going back; we’re able to budget our appropriations with
that in mind.
What we are talking about is the money award for
the benefits that were withheld in the past.
QUESTION; But you are taking the position that the
specified-day provision is not consistent with the statute?
MR. O'ROURKE;

Yes, sir, we are.

We maintain

that that's unreasonable regulation, that we are having
difficulty in living with it, in making the determination of
the eligibility.
The respondents in their brief urge that, or
impliedly urge that Illinois impliedly consented to waive
the Eleventh Amendment immunity as a result of participation
in the federally funded assistance program.
According to the Seventh Circuit, the theory
advanced in Parden j/s, Terminal Railway should necessitate a
finding that Illinois had indeed waived its immunity.
The Seventh Circuit, in citing Parden, found that
Illinois surely left the sphere -that was exclusively its
own when it began its participation in the Federal-State
Welfare Program and thereby waived its immunity.

However,

the decision of the Seventh Circuit, in holding this way,
runs counter to this Court's holding in Employees vs.

22

Missouri Department of Health and Welfare.
The respondents have contended in their brief that
the Eleventh .Amendment issue is not properly joined in this
cause because the Constitution of the State of Illinois has
abolished the doctrine of Sovereign Immunity.
An examination of the history of the doctrine of
Sovereign Immunity in our State establishes its continued
existence and its viability*
In 1970 the people of the State of Illinois
ratified a new constitution.

At the time that this suit

was filed, Illinois was functioning under the Constitution
of 1870,
Article IV, Section 26 of the Illinois Constitution
of 1870 provided that "The State of Illinois shall not be
made a defendant in any court of law or equity,"
Now, recognizing that persons might have
legitimate claims against the State of Illinois which ought
to be paid, the Illinois General Assembly passed a Court of
Claims Act, pursuant to the grant of authority contained
in the 1870 Constitution.
In effect, that Act itfas to provide that persons
with certain types of claims against the State of Illinois,
which would otherwise be barred by Article IV, Section 26 of
the Constitution, could be brought in the Court of Claims.
Decisions made by the Court of Claims are mere

4

23
recommendations to the State Legislature, which must take
affirmative action to appropriate funds to pay the claims
found by the Court of Claims to be just.
It is true that Article 13, Section IV, of the
Illinois Constitution of 1970, which became effective
January 1st, 1972, altered the old rule of Sovereign
Immunity by providing:

"Except as the General Assembly may

provide by law, Sovereign Immunity in this State is
abolished. "
The General Assembly then enacted to restore
Sovereign Immunity by enacting Section 801, Chapter 127 of
the Illinois Revised Statutes.

That Act became effective on

January 1st, 1972, the same date that the 1970 Constitution
took effect by the transition schedule.
That particular Act provides:
"Except as provided in 'An Act to Create the Court
of Claims,'

filed July 17, 1945, as amended, the State of

Illinois shall not be made a defendant or party in any
court."
In other words, Section 801 restored Sovereign
Immunity in Illinois, but reaffirmed the rights of persons
to bring claims against the State of Illinois in its
Court of Claims.
If the Court please, I'd like to reserve my
remaining time.

24

QUESTION;

May I ask one question?

MR. O'ROURKE;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Can you logically say that this case

is controlled by the decision here in Hissouri-Ernp1oyees?
Isn’t there a distinct factual difference in that there the
State was in the hospital business •—
MR. O'ROURKE:
QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.

-— long before the FELA requirements

went in? whereas here that is not so.

And I suppose

there's another factual difference and that was that the
Secretary there could bring suit,
MR, O'ROURKE:
QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.

And perhaps here there is no

alternative provision,
I just wonder if Missouri~Employees is so
conclusive as you intimate it is»
MR, O'ROURKE: We maintain it is, Mr. Justice
Blackmun, if the Court please.
very, very alike.

There the similarities are

There there was the interpretation of a

statute, here there’s an interpretation of a statute.
We also have the situation that the STate of Illinois has
been in the public aid business for many, many years
before the regulation as to the thirty and sixty days
took effect.

And we had the right to believe that we were

operating properly and correctly, such as the State had

25

the right to believe that they were operating the hospitals
pursuant to their prior authority.
I believe that there's a number of similarities.
QUESTION: Absent the Eleventh Amendment argument,
you still contend that back pay, so to speak, is not an
appropriate remedy?
MR. O'ROURKE:

Yes, sir, we do.

That there the

Federal Courts -QUESTION:

But about all you say in that regard

is that it isn't expressly provided for.
MR. O'ROURKE:

That's correct, neither expressly

nor impliedly,
QUESTION:

But do you think the Court is therefore

wrong to order back payments?
MR. O'ROURKE:

I think so, if the Court please.

This Court so held in Rosado vs. Wyman, that the sole
remedy for the ~~ against the State for failure to comply
would be the cutoff of federal funds.
We believe that, any action would actually sound
in the Federal Government, rather than an action for
retroactive benefits.
QUESTION: Well, a sole remedy except an injunction,
as far as the future is concerned.
MR. O'ROURKE:
sir.

We agree with the injunction, yes,

26

QUESTION;

Well, then, it isn’t the sole remedy,

is it?
MR, O’ROURKE;

No.

That's correct-

Nor was it

in Rosado vs, Wyman.
QUESTION; Right,
QUESTION:

Then, arguably, Rosado didn't mean to

foreclose back payments,
MR. O'ROURKE:
QUESTION:

We maintain that, sir.

Yes.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Roodman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHELDON ROODMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ROODMAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In this argument I would first review the
Eleventh Amendment defense of the Illinois Department of
Public Aid Director, and then secondly review the reasons
why upholding the relief granted by the court below is
necessary to effectuate compliance with the requirements
of the Social Security Act.
I would also ask the Court to bear with the cough
that I have at this time throughout the argument,

I

apologise for it,
QUESTION:

I think we all have itI

MR. ROODMAN;

The first defense, and the principal

27
defense of the Director of -the Illinois Department of Public
Aid is that the Eleventh Amendment bars the equitable
restitution relief in this case.
This defense is raised in a setting, in a factual
context, in which it has not previously been presented to
this Court.

This suit against the Director of the Illinois

Department of Public Aid, they concede, is properly in
Federal Court.
They concede that the suit against the Director
of the Illinois Department of Public Aid and the relief
which orders him to process it, every future application in
the entire State of Illinois, within thirty days or sixty
days, respectively, is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.
They further concede that the portion of the
provisions of the judgment which require that assistance
shall be effective as of the last day of the respective
time periods for all future applicants, even those that
extend beyond the prescribed time period, even in those
cases that relief is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.
However, with respect to the incidental equitable
relief of restitution, they claim that the Eleventh
Amendment bars the Federal Court from granting such relief.
The Director claimed that such relief is barred
by State Immunity from suits.

Consequently, he must be

claiming that in denying members of the plaintiff class their

23

equitable entitlement, and their statutory entitlement, and
he concedes that John Jordan and all other members of the
plaintiff class were entitled to these benefits in the
first instance; that is conceded in this case.
But it is argued that the incidental relief of
granting those benefits is barred by the State’s Immunity
from suit.

However, this Court, in Ex Parte Young, reasoned

that when a State officer acts in violation of paramount
federal law, that he acts without the authority of the
State.

The language of Ex Parte Young is that he acts without

the authority of the State, that his actions are simply an
illegal act, that the State has no power to impart to its
officers immunity from responsibility to the supreme
authority of the United States.
It is that doctrine that encompasses the entire
relief in this case.
Once this case is in Federal Court, the Eleventh
Amendment,v/hich applies to suits and not to types of relief,
no longer is applicable.
The question then becomes;

whether the relief

is appropriate; but not whether such relief is barred by
the Eleventh Amendment.
In interpreting Ex Parte Young, there is no basis
that was offered by the petitioners in order to bifurcate
that doctrine.

The doctrine applies to injunctive relief,

29

it applies to all relief that is necessary and appropriate.
The suggestion that there is a distinction between
constitutional — that constitutional cases are different
ignores the reality that in this case we have a violation of
the supremacy clause»

We have a situation where the

Illinois Director has violated the federal requirements and,
in turn, the supremacy clause.
QUESTION:

Is it your plan to bring a 1983 action

for damages against the. petitioner here?
MR. ROODMAN:

Your Honor, if that relief — if

the Federal Court believed that such relief was necessary and
appropriate and incidental to the other relief in this
case, yes, I think that, No* 1, certainly the Eleventh
Amendment would not bar that relief.
Federal Court.

We are already in

The Court has already ruled on the merits

of the case, and it has heard the case.

And as an incident

to that, the Court, if it deemed it necessary and appropriate
to effectuate compliance with the i\ct, it could grant that
relief.
QUESTION:

I'm thinking not so much of the

Eleventh Amendment as the general notion that an agent of
the State, though he may be enjoined from violating the
Constitution, is ordinarly not thought to be personally
liable on damages for his action.

Probably on the analogy

to a private employee of a private employer.

30

MR. ROODMAN;

If the Court is suggesting under

1983 causes of actions against public officials, this Court
has held, is permissible and the officials are personally
liable, in those situations.
QUESTION:

In damages?

MR, ROODMAN:

Personally liable in damages.

QUESTION: Aren't those tort cases, though?
MR. ROODMAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

In this case there are two theories in terms of
the cause of action that would apply here,

One is that of

equitable relief, is that there is a right to the
statutory entitlement and that the Court, in exercising
its equitable powers, is merely exercising the traditional
powers of the Court to grant appropriate and complete
relief to the parties before the Court,

Now, under 1983, it would be possible for the —
it is our position that the Court, exercising its equitable
power, may order State officials to make restitution,
Nov/, the more difficult case, if you're
suggesting --- and that restitution is no different than the
relief that orders State officials, in connection with
civil rights cases, the school cases, or the reapportioning
of legislatures.
Does that answer the question now, Your Honor?
QUESTION:

I think so, yes.

31

MR. ROODMAN:

The Eleventh Amendment position of

the defense, then, has, for two reasons, is not a bar to
the relief granted in this case.
First, the language of the amendment itself.
The language of the amendment uses the specific word "suit".
But they concede that this suit — it says the judicial
power of the United States shall not be construed to extend
to any suit.
But they concede that this suit against the
Director is properly in Federal Court under the doctrine of
Ex Parte Young.
Thus, this Court would have to distort the
language of the amendment itself in order to reach the
conclusion as offered by the petitioners.
And secondly, the doctrine of Ex Parte Young, as
we have indicated, the rationale is that when a State
officer violates paramount Federal law, he is stripped of
his official or representative capacity.

He is acting

without the authority of the State, and the State has no
power to impart to him any immunity from responsibility.
In this case in particular we have a situation
where, and I would refer the Court to the facts, they are
set out in the Appendix, pages 85 through 89 —
QUESTION; Specifically, what federal law do you
say the State of Illinois, the officers were violating?

32

MR, ROODMAN;

They were violating, Your Honor,

both the statutory provision which requires applications to
be processed with reasonable promptness and the federal
regulations pursuant thereto.

The federal regulations

which require the processing of applications within maximum
time periods.
QUESTION:

Mr. Roodman, suppose the authorities

had voluntarily come into compliance with the federal statute
and regulations before this action were brought, and then
these plaintiffs wanted to get retroactive payments*

What

kind of action would they bring?
MR. ROODMAN:

If the suit — at that point, Your

Honor, they would bring a suit in equity and a 1903 action
in the Federal Court for restitution of benefits wrongfully
denied.
QUESTION: So that would be an independent
equitable action for restitution?
MR. ROODMAN: That's, correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION: And the case would be no different than
tliis, as far as the Eleventh Amendment is concerned?
MR. ROODMAN: That's correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Only because — why?

MR. ROODMAN:

Because, for the plaintiffs who were

wrongfully denied their benefits in the past, as a result of
illegal acts of that State Director, he would at that time

33

be stripped of his authority and, as this Court has held,
he is not permitted to claim the immunity of the State
when acting in violation of federal law.
QUESTION:

Does the concept of an equitable

cause of action for restitution require that there be someone
in a corollary sense unjustly enriched?
MR. ROODMAN:

Your Honor, the doctrine of equitable

restitution involves situations in which one person should
make an accounting to the other for either of two reasons;
one, because one person would be unjustly enriched? or,
conversely, one person would unjustly suffer loss.
This case has both of those elements.

In

particular, we —
QUESTION: Who is unjustly enriched here?
MR. ROODMAN:

Your Honor, in this case, in

connection with the unjustly enriched aspect, the Illinois
Department of Public Aid saved the expenditure of State
funds that they were required to make, under the law, as a
result of a violation of law.
QUESTION:

Then you think that's unjust

enrichment?
MR. ROODMAN:

Well, I would certainly rest the

stronger part of my case upon the argument that John Jordan,
and others like him, should not unjustly suffer loss.
The restatement of restitution provides, or states,

34
as one of the guiding principles, that a person should not
profit by his wrong at the expense of another.
I would like to explain the facts, Your Honor,
with respect to your previous question.
It is not just the fact that some cases took longer
than thirty and sixty days.

First, there are specific

exceptions to those rules that are not at issue in this
case, and under certain circumstances it is permissible
under the federal rales to take longer than the prescribed
period.
The class of plaintiffs that we're talking about
in this case are only those persons who are eligible and
did not fall within that special category.

Only those

persons who are eligible and the delays were not as a result
of their fault or any special circumstances with respect
to determining their eligibility.
QUESTION:

An independent action for restitution,

jurisdictionally, would rest on what section?
MR. ROODMAN:

Your Honor, jurisdiction would rest

(a) on 1331 -QUESTION:

If there's ten thousand.

MR. ROODMAN:
QUESTION:

If there's ten thousand,
And there is only one named plaintiff

here?
MR. ROODMAN: There is one named plaintiff.

35
QUESTIONs And you think there's more than ten
thousand in it?
MR. ROODMAN: The circumstances of the named
plaintiff were that he did not have sufficient funds for
the basic necessities of life.

In the affidavit attached

to the complaint on the TRO, the 63-year-old, mentally
disabled man was ill, he was ill, No. 1, and malnourished.
Secondly, he was in a position where he did not
have vision in one eye and needed glasses.
If his application had been processed, he would
have had, as an incident to the rights of AABD recipients,
a medical card which would entitle him to free medical
— comprehensive medical care.
We would maintain,

(a) that that ten thousand

dollars was at stake for this individual? secondly, we
would have jurisdiction under 1343(3).
QUESTION: Although you alleged here only a
claim based on the federal statute, no constitutional
claim?
MR. ROODMAN; There was a second count, Your Honor,
that's not before this Court.

There was a sound count that

does involve constitutional claim, that the Seventh Circuit
ruled upon, that has not been appealed to this Court,
QUESTION:
claim?

Then you did assert.a constitutional

36

MR* ROODMAN:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION: What was that, an equal protection claim?
MR. ROODMAN: That's correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

How did the Seventh Circuit dispose of

that?
MR. ROODMAN:

Of the —

QUESTION: Did that go to, did the constitutional
claim go to the Seventh Circuit?
MR. ROODMAN:

Yes, it did, Your Honor.

The

Seventh Circuit ruled against the plaintiffs on the equal
protection claim, on a separate issue.
I would like to point out to the Court that the
fact that

that the delay is not the essence of this

case, the fact that applications were delayed in processing
is not the essence of this case.

The essence of the

deprivation in this case is the Illinois Regulation,
Section 3255, x-zhich provided that assistance could not be
provided for any month prior to the month in which -the
application was approved.
For example, with respect to John Jordan, who
applied in September 1970, his application was not acted
upon, as of the date of the filing of this lav/suit.

The

suit was filed in January of ’71, four months later.

The

lower court ordered his application to be processed.

He

was determined eligible and was given assistance effective

37

January 1 of '71.

That's tine month in which his application

was approved.
As a result of the Illinois regulation which barred
assistance for any month prior to the month in which the
application was approved.
But for this regulation, even though his application
was illegally delayed, he would have received assistance
effective November 1, 1970.

So it is the two months,

November and December 1970, that he was — his statutory
entitlement, that's conceded in this case.

And this

Illinois regulation barred him from receiving those
benefits.
So that in all cases, for all members of the
plaintiff class, they were entitled to these benefits and
it's tills regulation which barred them from receiving it.
Now, with respect to this regulation, the
established facts are in this case, and I would refer the
Court to the Appendix, at pages 85 through 89.

The

i

established facts are

I'm reading from paragraph 5 on

page 87 of the Appendix:
"From July 1, '68 to the present, Harold O. Swank,
wilfully and in gross disregard of the rights of eligible
AABD applications, knew that substantial numbers of eligible
AABD applications were being deprived, contrary to the
requirements of federal law, of their full AABD entitlements

38

effective thirty days from the date of their application, or,
with respect to disability applicants, forty-five days from
the date of their application, by reason of the operation,
implementation and enforcement of Sections 8255 and 8255.1
of the Illinois Categorical Assistance Manuali”
The facts are, then, that the Director knew, from
July 1, '68 throughout the relevant period, that the
regulation for the Department of Public Aid was contrary to
federal law, and deprived members of the plaintiff class
of their statutory entitlements,
QUESTION:

You have to get over the hurdle, of

course, that the regulations are consistent with the
statute, don't you?
MR, ROODMAN:

Your Honor, that argument was not

raised before the trial court at all*
preserved for appeal.
Circuit.

It is not properly

That's the ruling of the Seventh

It was not presented at all to the lower court.
Even if we were to consider it on the merits,

Your Honor, the other, all of the other courts that have
considered the question of whether the thirty-day and
sixty-day maximum time standards, have held them to be
reasonable.

This Court, and I would emphasize, in the case

of Rodriguez vs, Swank, which is the related case that
involved AFDC recipients in Illinois, raised that question
and the question was summarily affirmed in this Court

39

Certainly, Your Honor, even on the merits, though,
the question of providing assistance to people who are
needy and, by definition, do not have sufficient funds for
the necessities of life within thirty days, we maintain is
not an unreasonable judgment.
QUESTION:

Well, you have all the sentiment with

you, but I take it from your argument you're saying that
IIEW could do almost any.thing, it wanted to, and if it wasn't
within a month, we have not gone along with an IIEW
regulation.
MR. ROODMAN:

Our argument, Your Honor, is not

that they could do anything; our argument is that the
judgment was not arbitrary and capricious, and that is the
standard that the petitioners must establish in this case.
We maintain that that is a reasonable exercise of the
judgment of the HEW officials.

It is a standard that

prevails since 1951, Your Honor; for seventeen years that
standard of thirty days has prevailed.
Secondly; the standard, in and of itself, —
QUESTION:

But it's been just changed to forty-five,

hasn't it?
MR. ROODMAN:

It has been, Your Honor; just

changed.
QUESTION: So it hasn't prevailed consistently,
then, up to

40

MR. ROODMAH: Well, it has prevailed up until this
time, Your Honor.
I would maintain also, Your Honor, I would
suggest to the Court, that the regulation itself has a
specific exception provision for unusual circumstances.
So that the regulation does have an escape hatch in
certain situations.
But that is not before us.

In this case we're

talking about people who, by definition, were eligible for
those benefits, and who, through no fault of their own,
whose applications were delayed in processing; and even if,
and really the heart of the deprivation is that this
regulation of the Illinois Department of Public Aid, 8255,
xtfhich barred assistance for any period prior to the month
in which the application was approved, it is that regulation
that, had that not existed John Jordan would have received
his full entitlement as of the time when his application
was finally approved, in January '71,
So that one right of his would have been
violated, it would have taken too long; but he would have
received everything he would have been entitled to.
QUESTION;

Mr. Roodman, -~

QUESTION:

Aren't there some forms of need which

could be demonstrably imperative in five days or ten days,
but you don't challenge the right to have, now, forty-five

41
days to examine?
MR. ROODMANt

Your Honor, we do not -- we accept

the notion, we accept the principle that eligibility for
public assistance requires time; we accept the principle
that thirty days is a reasonable judgment for what that
time should be.
There are circumstances in which people have need
at the moment that they apply.

There are special provisions

for emergency assistance in those cases.

But we should

defer, in this case, to the judgment of HEW over seventeen
years.

And again I will point out that the issue is not

even before the Court properly, it was not raised in the
court belo'W, in the District Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Roodman, an I correct in understanding,

from what you've been saying about the Illinois regulation,
that it is your position that the element relied upon,
one of the three elements relied upon by the Second Circuit
in Rotlistein, namely, that the federal law was wilfully
disregarded, is met in this case?

In other words, you’ve

taken the position that Illinois wilfully, by virtue of
the regulation, disregarded the federal regulation.
MR. ROODMAN:
that.

Your Honor, yes is the answer to

I think the established facts, as set out in pages

85 through 88 of the Appendix, establish that the Director
of the Illinois Department of Public Aid knew that the

42
regulation was contrary to federal law.
Even if, Your Honor, it's not considered wilful,
it's clear that he understood that his regulation was in
violation of federal lav;.

If he had, and from July 1,

*68

and forward, if there was any question in his mind as to
the legality of those regulations, the Director could have
filed a suit for declratory judgment.

Instead, he continued

to receive federal funds for all of the period, knowing that
his actions x^ere in violation of federal law.
But, Your Honor, I would point out that what we
are interested in, and the ^remedy of-' res ti tution affords, is
that it is a remedy designed to deter all violations of
law,

We are not concerned only with wilful violations, but

we are concerned with deterring all violations of lax;.
The remedy of restitution, in this case, and it
is within the panoply of equitable remedies that a federal
court, sitting as a court of equity, has in order to grant
appropriate relief to the parties.
This Court has held, in Porter and Mitchell, that
are described in detail in our brief, that unless a statute
otherwise restricts the powers of equity, that court
retains all of its traditional equitable powers.
In Porter, the question was whether restitution
of excess rents charged in violation of the Emergency Price
Control Act were — a federal court had authority to grant

43

restitution.

The Court said yes.

In Mitchell, the question was whether an employee
who was discharged in violation of the Fair Labor Standards
Act, whether the court had the equitable power to grant
restitution of back wages in that case.
In each case the Court reaffirmed the principle
that a court of equity may grant restitution, unless the
statute otherwise restricts.
In this case, Your Honor, remedy of restitution
is necessary in order to bring about compliance with the
Social Security Act.
I think it’s worth pausing for a moment to reflect
on the situation that occurs without a remedy of restitution.
Without a remedy of restitution, the director of any public
aid office learns the value of the lesson that any federal
provision under the Social Security Act that is mandatory
may be ignored with impugnity, that savings in welfare
budgets may be brought about by violating the law, because
there is no effective sanction.

Any requirement that is

considered onerous or unfair may be disregarded, because
there is no sanction.
QUESTION: Well, you refer to that as a savings.
What is that going to be, general tax, along with the general
tax revenues, then?
MR. ROODMAN:

Your Honor, for example, with

44
respect to John Jordan, he was entitled to benefits for
November and December 1970»

The position there taken

and he was deprived those benefits.

And according to the

law of Illinois, each additional month that they would have
delayed, they would have saved the State's share of payments
to John Jordan,
So, had we not brought this suit, and his applica­
tion has remained unacted upon for January, for February,
for March, the State would have saved welfare payments for
each of those months,
It is our position that that — there must be
incentives not to save money by violating the law.

There

are, the Social Security Act provides legitimate means for
the States to control the expenditures in public assistance
programs.

This Court has so held, that if the State sets

its own standard of need and they pay less than the full
percentage of need, that is the reasonable, that is the
legitimate way of States controlling public assistance
expenditures.
On the other hand, the State Directors of public
aid need some incentives to pay careful attention to
federal requirements, whenever they are enforcing, whenever
they are adopting their regulations and taking positions
in the Social Security Act,,
I would point out to the Court that the present

45

remedies of an injunction, prospectively only, is not a
deterrent, and certainly the remedy of a total cutoff of
federal funds is not a deterrent.

It is only the remedy

of restitution that provides a deterrent and, conversely,
provides an incentive to comply with federal law.
We would, at the very least, in this cooperative
scheme of federalism, the States agree to comply with the
law; that is the central condition upon which the federal
government provides to the States billions of dollars.
The States agree that we will conform to federal
law.

And that's their only part of the bargain.
If cooperative federalism is to work, it must

work under a scheme where State officers respect the
supremacy clause and supremacy of federal requirements.
If there is not ~~ if this Court were to reverse,
on the grounds that the remedy of restitution was
inappropriate, it would provide a valuable lesson to State
welfare officials that there is no sanction for violating
the law.

And particularly in this case, given the

established facts, that the Director was aware that the
Illinois regulations were contrary to federal law, there
is no basis for reversing the decision.
QUESTION:

I suppose if State regulations have

been approved by the, or a State plan been approved by
HEW, there might be some argument that there shouldn't be

46

retroactive payments just because a court decided that the
State regulations were contrary to Social Security Act?
MR. ROODMAN;

Your Honor, that is one of the

equitable considerations that a court would take into
account.
In this case, I would point out that in fact the
Director does not argue that on the equities the lower
court abused its discretion.
QUESTION:

They would make an argument that the

judgment that the regulations were contrary to

that the

manual was contrary to HEW regulations —
MR. ROODMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

-- should be given only prospective

effect.
MR, ROODMAN:

Well, I think that's a different

doctrine than the one that —
QUESTION;

No, but it really says, it really

argues to a great extent that there's no equity in applying
the decision retroactively.
MR. ROODMAN;

Well, if the court would — that

argument seems to be that, yes, we knew that we were
violating the lax7, but now that we're caught, we ought not
to have to provide the statutory entitlements that we
were obligated to make in the first place and that we
agreed to make in the first place.

47
With respect to the question, answering the question,
in conclusion, with respect to wilful violations and whether
HEW approved it, x^e think that's one factor that the Court
would consider.
But, of course, what we are interested in is
deterring the violation of all lav/s.

And if the Court

rules that a State provision is contrary to the Social
Security Act and the supremacy clause, we must remember
that the plaintiffs then are being deprived of — were
deprived of their statutory entitlement, and all that a
remedy of restitution does is it places them in a position
that they would have been in but for the violation of lav;.
And that’s the classic goal of restitution.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Roodman.

Mr. O'Rourke, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. O'ROURKE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.
MR. O’ROURKE:

Just one or two short items, if

the Court please.
I think the Court, in questioning, Mr. Chief
Justice, Mr. Roodman relative to the question about unjust
enrichment hits upon the point.

They keep characterizing

their relief as equitable restitution, and we maintain that
as an establishment of equitable restitution there must be

40
unjust enrichment of someone.
Certainly the Director did not receive any money,
the STate of Illinois did not receive any money.

As a

matter of fact, our appropriations for welfare for all of
the years in question were completely exhausted.

Hot one

cent was returned to the Treasury of the State of Illinois.
QUESTION:

What about the assertion, or was there

a finding below that the Director knew that the Manual was
contrary to IFEW regulations?
MR. 01ROURKE: That was pursuant to an affidavit
filed by the plaintiffs, which was never responded to by
the defendants.

It's true that we knew that the regulations

were inconsistent in the State of Illinois with the
regulations of IIEW.
QUESTION:

That was —
Then you were aware of that?

MR, O'ROURKE:

Yes, we were, Your Honor.

7vs a

matter of fact, the respondents, in their brief, makes also
a point that we were being sued at this present time in
Rodriguez vs. Swank, with -the Aid to Dependent Children
program, on much the same type of tiling.
We contend that this is not necessarily fallible
that we showed bad faith, that there was v/ilful violation of
this, because what we were doing was we were pursuing a
legal remedy we felt we had, or a legal theory we had.
And we respectfully submit that it's improper to

49
allage that the exhaustion of one’s appellate remedies in
any way indicates bad faith.
The question of the magnitude of the job that
the State of Illinois, as other States throughout the Union,
has to do in the welfare program in determining eligibility;
the number of people that were on welfare in 1967 was
424,665 people in the State of Illinois.

This has gone

now to, at the present time, 983,600.
In just one year, the year 1967 —- or 1971,
397,281 people were added to the welfare rolls.

So that

we do have a problem of having peak periods and having
low periods as to determining eligibility.
Counsel points out two cases that he relies upon
rather heavily, the Porter case, relative to the payment of
retroactive — retroactive payments of rents that were
withheld, and also the Mitchell case, relative to wages.
Neither one of these cases, we submit, was a case against
a State.

And in both of those cases we believe that the

principle of equitable restitution was a proper one. There
had been unjust enrichment, both in the landlord that
charged the over-amount rents, and also in the employer
that had not paid the wages according to the Fair Labor
S tandards Act.
With that, if the Court please, we will rest.
Thank you

50

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:52 o'clock, p.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
