73-582, Pittsburgh against Alco Parking Corpora­

tion.
Mr. Lynch.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH LYNCH, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER.
MR. LYNCH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I represent the petitioner, the City of Pittsburgh.
The respondents are private persons operating off-street
parking facilities in the City of Pittsburgh.
On February 20, 1970, the respondents filed a suit
to enjoin enforcement of the City of Pittsburgh parking tax
ordinance.
That ordinance imposed a tax on the privilege of
engaging in off-street parking transactions for a considera­
tion, and established the rate at 20 percent of the gross
receipts derived.
That ordinance replaced a 1969 ordinance taxing the
same privileges at the rate of 15 percent, and that ordinance
had in turn replaced a 1963 ordinance taxing the same
transactions at tine rate of 10 percent.
The respondents are twelve in number and they operate
17,000 off-street parking spaces in the downtown area of the

4
city.

There are another 1,000 spaces operated by private

persons not party to this suit, and there are an additional
6,100 spaces operated by the Public Parking Authority of
tiie City of Pittsburgh, a public municipal corporation.
The respondents allege basically that the competi­
tion of tiie Public Parking Authority, when combined with the
20 percent gross receipts tax of the City of Pittsburgh,
serves to confiscate their profits without due process of law.
The issues raised, then, are two.
No. 1, whether or not the due process clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment places any limit on the right of a
legislative body to set the rate of a revenue tax.
QUESTION:

In that connection, Mr. Lynch, did the

city, could the city have prohibited private operation of
parking lots anywhere in the city?
MR. LYNCH:

The City of Pittsburgh does not have

health powers, so from tiie standpoint of health in terms of,
say, fumes or things of that nature, no.
From -the standpoint of regulating traffic under
its general police powers, the City of Pittsburgh does
control parking operations in the City of Pittsburgh.
QUESTION:

That is location and size?

MR. LYNCH:

That is correct.

QUESTION: And ingress and egress, that sort of thing?
MR. LYNCH:

That is correct.

QUESTION: But that's all’, they don’t prohibit,
NR, LYNCH:

The City of Pittsburgh, I don’t think,

in the exercise of its police powers — well, it could in
terras of an emergency* I suppose, declare that, for example,
that if there were excessive pollution in the city on a
particular day, it might have to cooperate with the county,
because it does not have directly the health power, that's a
county function,
QUESTION:

IIow about the zoning ordinances, Mr,

Lynch, are there any which prohibit —
MR. LYNCH: The City of Pittsburgh can control
parking by proper exercise of the zoning ordinance.
QUESTION: That is, prohibit commercial parking -MR. LYNCH:
QUESTION:
MR. LYNCH;
QUESTION:

Yes.
— in certain sections?
In certain sections, yes, Your Honor.
Getting back to my question, though,

could the city, in view of the fact that it is in the business
and the Authority is in the business, could the city have
removed from private enterprise the operation of any parking
facility in the City of Pittsburgh?
MR. LYNCH:

I don’t think that the City of Pittsburgh

has, on its face, any specific power to totally prohibit
parking in Pittsburgh, in the city, unless it -QUESTION:

Are you talking about State law?

6

HR. LYNCH;

No, the city —

QUESTION:

What about the question —■ does the

Federal Constitution prevent a city from forbidding private
parking lots within the city limits?
HR. LYNCH:

No, I don’t think the Federal

Constitution would.
QUESTION: And so it's just a -- if Pennsylvania
Constitution or statutes themselves permitted Pittsburgh to
do this, to prevent entirely private parking lots, you would
think the Federal Constitution would permit it?
HR. LYNCH:
QUESTION:

No, I don't think it would.
Hr. Lynch, the city itself operates

parking lots, does it not?
MR. LYNCH; The City of Pittsburgh operates a small
number of lots, yes, sir.
QUESTION: Suppose it had been proved that the
principal purpose, or a purpose of the city was to put the
private lots out of business so that the public, city-owned
lots would be able to make a higher rate of profit? would that
give you any trouble constitutionally?
MR. LYNCH:

I think there might be a problem there.

Your Honor, but that is not the issue here*

The issue here

is whether or not there was any intent of the City of
Pittsburgh to put the private operators out of business, or
whether or not the City of Pittsburgh was merely exercising

7
its power to raise revenue by imposing the tax.
How, there has never been a question in this case
as to the power of the City of Pittsburgh to impose a tax on
parking transactions for the purposes of raising revenue, and
the City of Pittsburgh ordinance states on its face that it
was to raise revenue.
revenue was raised.

The record shows very clearly that
It shows very clearly that each time the

tax was increased, additional revenue was raised.
So the issue here is not whether or not the City of
Pittsburgh had power to force the private operators out of
business while the public operation remained.
The issue is whether or not, under the due process
clause, that the revenue measure on its face, designed to
raise revenue, could be inquired into by the court simply
because it was unreasonable, simply because it might believe
to be —- you might believe it to be excessive, or even
destructive of a particular business.
This Court has held on numerous occasions that if
the power to tax exists, the extent of the burden is strictly
a concern of the Legislature, no matter what the indirect
effect of that tax.
QUESTION:

Fir. Lynch, it’s my feeling that your

answer to that last dialogue at least confused me.

Let's see

if I can straighten it out in my own mind.
Is there anything in the Federal Constitution that

8

would bar the City of Pittsburgh from declaring, if it was
by law, that it was going to have a monopoly on all public
parking, just as it does over water and electricity and so
on?
MR. LYNCH:
QUESTION;

No.
You have given an ambiguous answer,

perhaps, that you didn't intend to.
MR. LYNCH:

No.

A second issue in this case -QUESTION:

Mr. Lynch, one more question there.

Does the record disclose whether there was any resistance
complaint when the rate was 10 percent and then later when
it was 15 percent, or did the resistance come only when it
went to 20?
MR. LYNCH: When the rate was set for the first time
at 10 percent in 1962, effective for the year 1963, the
revenue measure was challenged.

That's the 10 percent rate.

And in 1964, in a per curiam decision, the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court validated the 10 percent tax.

At that time

the opinion shows that there were 5,100 parking authority
spaces, the public spaces, in existence at the time of that
suit as compared to the 6,100 in existence now.
QUESTION:

Is there any evidence in the record at

all as to whether this tax could be passed on, or was being
passed on?

9
MR» LYNCHs

That raises one of the second basic

issues in this case,—
QUESTION ;

Oh, all right, you*re going to get to

that, then.
MR. LYNCH;

Your Honor, and that is the issue,

assuming that judicial inquiry is proper, do the facts show
that property was taken without due process of law.
Now, the Chancellor sitting in equity, he validated
the ordinance and the tax, and he found among other things
that demand for parking exceeded supply, that when the tax
had been increased in 1969, that gross receipts had increased
during the same year after payment of the tax, and that there
had been no effort to pass the tax on.
The Supreme Court, when it reversed the Commonwealth
Court, as well as the Chanellor in Equity, determined as a
matter of lav? that the respondents did not have to attempt
to pass the tax law. And, in fact, at the time of trial, there
had been no attempt to pass the tax law.
QUESTION;

Is there a spread, a very large one,

between what the private lots charge and what the municipally
operated lots do?
MR. LYNCH; There is on the average, in many cases
the rates being charged in the publicly owned garages are
lower than the rates being charged in the private garages.
QUESTION;

Much lower or —

10

MR, LYNCH:
QUESTION %
MR. LYNCH:
an hour to all day.

Well, there is a whole range of rates —
Yes.
— from whether it's for a half-hour to
So that you can say that generally they

are lower.
QUESTION:
MR. LYNCH;

Yes, And this has always been so?
Yes.

QUESTION: And have the rates for the private lots
gone up in larger percentage than the rates for the publicly
operated lots?
MR. LYNCH: There is nothing in the record to show
that.

However, I think that if there is a disparity and

rates are changed percentagewise, then the disparity might
increase.
However, it's one of the fundamental errors that
we believe that the majority below made, was to conclude that
under the circumstances here the tax couldn't be passed on.
This is one of the fundamental issues in this case, because
the record shows, the undisputed facts are that demand exceeds
supply by 4,000 spaces. And —
QUESTION:

But, Mr* Lynch, that is a factual

question, isn't it, on which the Commonwealth Court found a
particular way, and certainly the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
didn't upset that finding.

How free are we to make our own

factual inquiry into something like that?

11
MR. LYNCH:

We11, we have an issue here, Your

Honor, which deals with the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Constitution, and you are free to examine the facts yourselves
to determine whether or not there has been a constitutional
violation.
QUESTION;

Even on strictly historical facts?

MR. LYNCH:

Yes ~ because I don't think it's a fact,

a finding that you did not have to make, that the respondents
did not have to make an attempt to pass the tax on in the form
of price increases is really not a finding of fact, it's a
conclusion which goes against the facts of record, which are
quite —
QUESTION:

Oh, I agree with you on that.

Then the

very next, in a parenthetical expression right after they
say that, in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, they say:
Although it's previously noted the Commonwealth Court found
this was not possible.

So at least you have an opinion by

the Pennsylvania appellate court that the tax couldn’t be
passed on.

And are we free to upset that?
MR. LYNCH:

Yes, I ‘think you are, Your Honor,

because that goes to the constitutionality of the ordinance,
which is being tested as a violation of the Fourteenth Amend­
ment.

And this Court has permitted that in prior cases.

And I —
QUESTIONs

But even if it weren’t to be passed on,

12

is there a finding of unprofitability on the part of any
company?
Or the fact — is there a finding that any company
went out of business, or was forced out of business?
MR. LYNCHs The record does not indicate that one
company has gone out of business, the record indicates that
at the time of trial all the respondents had. paid their tax.
There was a statistical compilation of income
versus expenses, and that compilation shows that nine

of

fourteen of the operators —■ the projected expenses for the
year 1370, when compared to projected income, that, nine of
fourteen operation studies would show a loss.
But that does not in any way show confiscation.
That just is taking one standard.

There's no study as to the

amount of the salaries that were involved in the operating
expenses, as to whether or not they could be considered
return on investment.
But I want to return, Your Honor, to the question,
the conclusion that you could not pass the tax on.
The factual situation shows that 25 percent of the
supply is controlled by the public body, charging lower
prices. The record also shows that the public, the so-called
public competitor, charging lower prices,is full at all times.
It's completely full at all times.
With the demand exceeding supply by 4,000 spaces,

13

that's another fact of record.

And as Justice Pomeroy points

out in his dissent, I don't know how you can say it better;
"An enterpreneur who controls 71 percent of the supply in a
market of unsatisfied demand need not concern himself with a
low-cost competitor, the Parking Authority, who controls 29
percent of the siipply, has no excess capacity, and cannot
service demand which the 71 percent competitor might drive
away through price increases."
How, with all due respect to Justice Roberts and
the majority opinion, I think that when demand exceeds supply
and the low-cost competitor is at capacity, to conclude that
you do not have to attempt to pass on the tax in the form of a
price increase is just sheer economic nonsense.
I think at the very least, as Justice Pomeroy also
pointed out in his dissent, at the time he wrote his dissent
the respondents had indeed raised their prices.

And he stated,

at the ver- least you could go back and look at the effect of
that.
You’re talking about confiscation of property and
to establish confiscation the facts should show — there
should be no doubt in anybody's mind that confiscation took
place.

Mo doubt in anybody’s mind.

And I would submit that

it is impossible not to have a doubt in these facts.
I think another question in this case is the extent
to which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the majority

14
opinion attempts to set forth competition, the direct
competition of the governmental body, as something unique in
this area of the law.
The question of competition by a governmental body
and taxation at high rates was before this Court over a
century ago in the Veazie Bank Mote case, and in that case
this Court held that a 10 percent tax on bank notes,
admittedly excessive, for the purpose of driving out State
bank notes which were in competition with the federal notes
being issued by the federal government, was proper.

That

the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit judicial inquiry
into the rate of the tax designed to raise revenue. That
was a matter for the Legislature.
Again, more recently, in the Puget Sound case,
cited in our brief, there the issue was a three percent gross
receipts tax imposed by the City of Seattle.

The tax was

imposed upon a light company with which the city was in direct
competition.

This Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment

does not immunize, does not immunize a private person from
competition by the government, even though the government is
also levying a tax on the competitor*
Now, if the power to compete exists, and the power
to tax at a rate exists, I do not see how two rights can make
tiie wrong.

We eventually get right back to a question of:

what rate of tax is reasonable or burdensome?

15

And that issue is for the Legislative Body.
The majority opinion also places some weight on a.
dissent in the Magnano vs. Hamilton case, and that dissent
states that:

It would be conceivable that a revenue measure

on its face was only a mere disguise, that it was so
arbitrary that it was obvious that the intent wasn't to
raise revenue but that the attempt was to exert another
power, perhaps a forbidden power, such as confiscation.
Well, obviously, you couldn't determine that question
on rate, because in the Magnano case it was admitted that the
rate of tax, 15 cents a pound on oleo, was going to drive the
oleo companies out of business.
So you can't look to rate to determine whether that's
tiie unusual circumstance involved.
7\nd this revenue measure, it is impossible to
conclude that the measure is a disguise for

to disguise

the attempted of the City of Pittsburgh to confiscate the
property of the respondents.
it's raising revenue.

The measure on its face says

It did raise revenue.

So if the Court is going to engage in speculation,
as to what the intent was, if it doesn't accept the measure
on its face, there's no reason to conclude that confiscation
was the intent; I think it would be more reasonable to conclude
that tiie City of Pittsburgh had successfully raised revenue
before by imposing a parking tax; that it was reasonable for

16

the city to assume that when it increased the tax, revenue
would increase.

It would also be reasonable to assume that

since it's a parking tax and I think that we can all agree that
parking in the downtown metropolitan area is somewhat of a
luxury, that it would not be unreasonable to believe that
if the price was raised in some of the areas involving these
entire 24,000 spaces in downtown Pittsburgh, that some of
these people coming in from the suburbs might continue to
come in and pay an additional tax.
I think that would be the fair conclusion from an
examination of this record, and the unfair conclusion would
be to conclude that the City of Pittsburgh didn't intend to
raise revenue at all, it intended to confiscate the
respondents' businesses.
QUESTION: Does the City of Pittsburgh have any
income taxes levied on people who work there?
HR. LYNCH:

One percent.

It has a ten percent

occupation tax on non-residents and a one percent tax on
residents.
QUESTION: What's the ten percent occupation tax on?
MR. LYNCH:
QUESTION:
MR. LYNCH:

Excuse me, ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars.
That's a ten-dollar occupation tax.

That's for the privilege of working there.
QUESTION: Do you have any comment about the curious

17
provision as to making the Authority taxable in the
ordinance?

And, as I understand it, the Authority has

challenged this, and -MR. LYNCHs

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTIONs

— what is the status of that litigation?

MR. LYNCH;

Yes, Your Honor. The respondents in this

case, the very people who claim that the City of Pittsburgh
is out to confiscate their property and to favor the Authority
— and to favor competition by the Authority, have instituted
litigation successfully to eliminate the 20 percent tax which
is being imposed by the city, or was being imposed by the
city on the Authority, since its inception, since the inception
of the tax in 1963.
And the Commonwealth —
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t that just another pocket

of the city?
MR. LYNCHs
pocket of the city.

No, Your Honor, it’s not just another
And even if it were, I submit that the

way to attack that problem, if the City of Pittsburgh is
using the Authority to compete unfairly, or if the Authority
is competing unfairly, then appropriate proceedings could be
brought in the State court.
There need be no reason to attack the tax, which is
being placed directly on the Authority and would tend to
equalize the burden, rather than to further discriminate.

18

QUESTION:

You say a private parking group brought

the litigation which invalidated the tax against the
Authority?
MR. LYNCH: Right.
QUESTION: When was this?
MR. LYNCH:

That litigation was commenced about a

year and a half ago, and the Commonwealth —
QUESTION:
MR. LYNCH:

What was the rate at that time?
Twenty percent.

QUESTION: And the Authority was paying twenty per­
cent?
MR. LYNCH: The Authority was paying twenty percent,,
and operators operating on behalf of the Authority were
paying twenty percent; those operators claimed the statutory
exemption from taxes set forth in the Authority's Act against
the will of the Authority — they overcame preliminary
objections filed by the Authority, so using that exemption
these very respondents have been successful in having the
twenty- percent tax eliminated from the operations of the
public parking authority.
QUESTION:

While they still have to pay it — or

would have to pay it if you prevail.
MR. LYNCH:

If —?

QUESTION: The private operators will have to pay it
if you prevail here.

19

MR. LYNCH: The twenty percent tax in this case,
if we prevail?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. LYNCH:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Is that other litigation final now?

That's all through?
MR. LYNCH:

There is a petition for certiorari

pending in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
Thant you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Boreman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD BOREMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS.
MR. BOREMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think it is necessary at the outset to pose the
issue in this case which the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
posed in the opening paragraph of the opinion.
And that is,-where a city imposes a twenty percent
excise tax, a parking tax, and there is combined with it
governmental operation of tine exact identical business, does
that constitute a taking under the Fourteenth Amendment, or,
rather, I should say under the Fifth Amendment, made unlawful
by the States under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Now, that is the issue.

The issue is not whether a tax

standing by itself is unconstitutional.

And the issue is not

20

whether the city has the power to impose an excise tax on
these parking operators.

And the issue is not whether the

city has the power to compete with the parking operators in
conducting a parking business.
Of course, there is no question about any of those
issues.

But the issue is;

Can the city impose a twenty

percent tax, which the Commonwealth. Court has declared by a
unanimous vote to be excessive and unreasonable, and which
the Supreme Court has said is excessive and unreasonable;
and when combined -—
QUESTION'S

Mr. Boreman, is that in the context —*

were those holdings in the context of the Parking Authority
itself being subject to the tax, or was this after the
invalidation of the taxes and —
MR. BOREMAN;

Let me explain that, Your Honor.

The Supreme Court, Justice Roberts said, adverted to the
invalidation of the tax against the Parking Authority, but
he said that didn't influence his decision.

He said by

reason of the fact that the Parking Authority, outside of
the parking tax, has total exemption from all property taxes,
exemption from all income taxes, low-cost financing, long­
term financing, the power of eminent domain under its
statute, that these are such great advantages that they
alone enable the Parking Authority to charge lower rates,
and tliat adding the exemption of the parking tax makes it

21

even worse.
How, may I explain this —QUESTION:

Do you think the 15 percent tax was

unconstitutional, too?
MR* BOREMAN :

I beg pardon?

QUESTION: When it was 15 percent, do you think that
was unconstitutional?
MR. BOREMAH:

I think it would be, Your Honor, yes,

if the facts shewed what we think this record shows, and what
I propose to discuss —
QUESTION:

How about ten percent?

MR. BOREMAN: There I think there might be a. proper
imposition.
QUESTION:

Well, what about -- was the Parking

/Authority subject to the same tax or wasn't it?
MR. BOREMAN:

Yes.

Let me explain that, Your Honor,

because I’m counsel in the case which invalidated the parking
for these — for some of these same plaintiffs, but there are
others, there; are some very large interests who are not
plaintiffs in this case.
This is the way the Parking Authority works. The
Parking Authority was created by the Legislature of Pennsylvania
by the Act of 1947.
parking authorities.
authority

It authorized municipalities to set up
The City of Pittsburgh set up a parking

22

The Parking Authority went out and with the lowcost financing and long-term financing, due to tax exemption,
issued bonds to build the structures.

They then proceeded

to lease these garages to private operators.
Now, under the terms of the lease, these private
operators pay a flat rate.
QUESTION; Every one of them leased to a private
operator?
MR. BOREMAN;
QUESTION;

Every one?

MR. BOREMAN;
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

I see.

MR. BOREMAN;

The Parking Authority operates a few

small lots where they have parking meters, I think, by
themselves, but most of them are leased.
Now, these operators pay a rent which is enough
to cover the amortization of the bonds, and then they share the
profit with die Parking Authority, fifty-fifty.
Now, these private operators, itfhen I say share the
profit fifty-fifty, that's after all expenses.

So that the

burden of the expenses are on these private operators, even
though they're operating the Parking Authority garages.
If there is a profit, the Parking Authority shares
fifty percent of the profit.
Consequently, if this tax remains valid against

23

the Parking Authority, these private operators must add to
their expenses the amount of the parking tax.
So they went into court, and I acted as their
counsel, and the Commonwealth Court has so held, and I might
say that it is completely under Pennsylvania precedent, it is
cited in Justice Roberts’ opinion, that they went into court
to have it declared -— to have the exemption in favor of the
Parking Authority declared, and the Commonwealth so declared»
The case is now on petition for —
QUESTION;

Why couldn't you pass it on?

NR. BOREMANs
QUESTIONs

I beg pardon, sir?

Pass the tax on.

MR. BOREMAN; The tax can’t be passed on, for several
reasons, Your Honor.
No. 1, there is testimony in this record by a number
of these plaintiffs — who, by the way, are probably the most
experienced parking operators in the United States.

One

operator, the operator of Alco Parking, and the others -may I just go on with this, Your Honor, and I'll explain why.
— is the largest parking operator in Pittsburgh,
has been an operator for over fifty years.
QUESTION:

Now, might he be operating some of

Parking Authority under lease as well as —
MR, BOREMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

— independent leases.

24

MR. BOREMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

The other one, operating Stanwix Auto Park, is a
member of the board of directors of the National Parking
Association.

These are experts.

They have testified that in their experience as
parking operators, if they are charging and getting as much
as they can get, they say, and they testified, they charge
the highest rate.

They'd be a fool not to get more if they

could.
Now, with the competition of the parking authority

Honor.
I say that it is a misleading figure.

that record in which that 4,000 figure is given, it says it
is an over-all average for the whole city, based on the
examination of traffic congestion, on needs, and so forth.

there is this capacity.

And, by the way, it isn’t capacity,

because the record shows, and we’ve set it forth in the brief,
the record shows that capacity goes up to 120 percent and
not the 99 or 102 percent that the Parking Authority garages
have.
How, at four o'clock, and at six o'clock, and in
the evening and on weekends, there is no such deficiency,
Your Honor.

That 4100 spaces is only at the peak hour of

'two o'clock in the afternoon, and possibly twelve o'clock
on some occasions.
Now, if you will look on page 640, you will see
that at other times there is not that peak demand and that
deficiency of 4100 spaces.

That is an estimate by Wilbur

Smith Associates, in making the study, that the City of
Pittsburgh over-all could use 4100 spaces.

That doesn't

say that the Parking Authority garages are filled twenty-four
hours a day.

In no 3ense.

QUESTION;

And they are not.

Well, I don't know of any Parking

Authority any place in the blamed world that's filled
twenty-four hours a day.
That's not in this case.
MR. BOREMANs That's right, Your Honor, but —
QUESTION:

The only thing we have in this case

about passing on is that your people say, "We can't do it".
MR. BOREMAN; And the Supreme Court found that they

27
didn't have to do it, and the Commonwealth Court found that
they can't do it»
And that's because at other times of the day, other
than peak hours, the Parking Authority garage is not filled,
and they charge lower rates, and if the private garages raise
their rates at these other times of the day, that lessens
their competitive ability.
For example, there are Parking Authority garages in
the City of Pittsburgh standing on one corner, and there is the
private operator's garage right next door.

Now, anybody comes

into the parking business will tell you that the bread-andbutter and the success of a parking garage depends on shortterm parking.

One, two, three and four hours.

If you look at our record, in Exhibit 3, you will
see that for those short periods of parking, the Parking
Authority's rates are fifty percent of the private operator's.
Mow, if we were expected to pass it on, and charge
more, we increase that disparity.

So it is not a simple

question of some statistical 4100 spaces, it is a question of
the actual facts in the operation of parking garages in the
city.
Nov/, Your Honor, I think it's important in discussing
the nature of this tax that this tax that is imposed on these
private operators is twenty percent, a tax that is greater
than, to my knowledge, any tax in the lity of Pittsburgh or

28
in the nation.
tax anywhere.

I know of no other twenty percent excise
Certainly no twenty percent parking tax.

It is a selective tax, it is not imposed generally
on the City of Pittsburgh.

It is imposed on this small group.

Now, in addition, in the City of Pittsburgh there is
what is known as a business privilege tax, and it is taxed
at the rate of six mills.
tax also.

These parking operators pay that

So that the tax for the privilege of conducting

business in the lity of Pittsburgh, for the parking operators,
is 206 mills, whereas every other business in the city pays
six mills.
Also in the City of Pittsburgh there is a mercantile
tax imposed on wholesale and retail vendors of merchandise
at the rate of one mill,
Nov;, tlie disparity between the tax imposed on this
selective group of parking operators as compared to all other
businessmen is tremendous. The amount imposed on these
people is 34 and a third times more than any other business.
On Exhibit 3 you will note that the mercantile
tax in 1969, obtained for the city $2 million; that's over
all the merchants of the city, 7200 merchants.

The parking

operators, this small group, paid equally two million.
The business privilege tax all over the city brought
in four and a half million; these parking operators paid two
million.

29

Now, I might say at the same time that there are no
extra benefits conferred on these parking operators for this
money. There are no extra police, the record is replete with
testimony that there are no extra police, there are no extra
services, and there is no particular benefit advanced to them.
QUESTION s

Is it your position that the city

violates the Constitution when it simply imposes a gross
receipts tax that has the result of reducing the number of
customers for parking lot spaces?
MR. BOREMAN;

Not if there weren't public

competition, Your Honor,,

If the factor of public competition

by the Parking Authority weren't here, I think we would have a
different picture.

I think we would have another question,

but I wouldn't take that position at this point.
The position —■
QUESTION; But how many public parking spaces were
there, run by the Authority?
MR. BO RE MAN :

Six thousand.

QUESTION; And how many total in the city?
MR. BOREMAN:

In the downtown section of the city,

which is where the concentration is, 24,000 altogether.
The private operators operate 17,600 spaces — or 400 spaces.
The Parking Authority operated 6100 spaces, and there are
scattered individual lots in the area.
QUESTION; Well, I suppose it means that the tax

30
would probably ~~ might guarantee, as the price got higher
and higher, that the spaces in the Authority lots would always
be full.
MR. BOREMAN:

If the private operators were compelled

to increase their rates, which they can't do because if they
do they make the competition with the Parking Authority that
much worse.
QUESTION: Well, it can't get any worse than five or
six thousand places, full places.

But it can reduce the

number of cars that come in to park.
MR. BOREMAN: Yes, it can, Your Honor, there is
nothing to stop the Parking Authority from building new
garages, exercising the power of eminent domain.
QUESTION:

But that hasn't happened, though.

MR. BOREMAN:
QUESTION:
what

Yes, it has happened, Your Honor.

Yes, but -that isn't what — that isn't

I would suppose tluvt it's the reduction in the number

of people who want parking spaces that would get to you
pretty fast.
Do you have any statistics in the record as to how
many parkers there were over the years, as this

tax got

higher and higher?
MR. BOREMAN:

No, -ut we have — we don't have

that statistic, Your Honor, but we do

have the one

statistic in the record, Meyers Brothers, a national parking

31
chain, one of the largest parking operations in the City of
Pittsburgh, I believe their capacity is about over 2,000.
When this tax became 15 percent, they tried to raise the
rate. They found that their business decreased by about 25
percent.

It's in the record.
Then they tried again to raise the rate at the end

of 196?, and they had to close a whole floor because there
were people that just quit coming in because of the raise.
QUESTION: Well, are there any statistics in the
record as to what the average vacancy was in the Authority's
parking lots?
NR. BORENANs

Yes, Your Honor.

There's no average

vacancy, but there's a —* there's a — on page 640 *—
QUESTION: Were they always full?
MR. EOREMAN:
always full.

No, Your Honor.

No, they are not

They're full — they're mostly full at peak

hours, of twelve and two.

But not at four and six in the

evenings and on the weekends, no.
QUESTION: So their spaces were going begging, too,
to some extent?
MR. BOREMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Except for the peak hours.
QUESTION;

Mr. Boreman, when Meyers tried to raise

its rates at a time, as I understand you, when the tax was 15
percent —

32
MR. BOREMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— were the Public Authority lots also

paying the 15 percent tax?
MR. BO RE MAN:

Yes, Your Honor,

QUESTION: At that time.
MR, BOREMAN:

— they were.

QUESTION: Did they try to raise their rates?
Did they try to raise their rates at the public —
MR. BOREMAN;

No, Your Honor, they didn't.

As a

matter of fact, one of the difficulties that exist today is
that the public authority itself directs and fixes the rates
for these lessees, and they have not permitted a raise in
rates since 1952.
They just won't permit a raise in rates, and the
loss is then absorbed by these lessees, because it isn't the
loss of the Parking Authority.
QUESTION: Do you agree with your friend that there
is nothing in the Federal Constitution to prevent Pittsburgh
from taking over all of the parking lots
MR. BOREMAN:
QUESTION:

I agree —

— as a public utility?

MR. BOREMAN;

I agree on one basis, that that is

actual condemnation, and I would say that constitutionally
they would have to pay damages.
certainly take them over.

By eminent domain they could

33

QUESTION: Well, I don't mean taking them over, I mean
simply decide that there would be nothing except public parking
facilities, and then -MR. BOREMAN:

I would say that that itself is a

taking»
QUESTION:

Well, do you think it was a taking when

tlie Eighteenth Amendment was passed, and saloons went out
of business?
MRo BOREMAN:

That, Your Honor, comes under the

category of cases that I think Your Honor is quite familiar,
the noxious substance cases.
I think the government could ban marijuana, it could
ban alcohol, it could ban other drugs,
under the noxious substance doctrine,
Sanchez, for example, is an example.

I think they come
United States v.
I don't think they are

in the same category as these cases.
This is a legitimate business.

As a matter of fact,

it's a quasi-public business.
QUESTION: Well, isn't the liquor business a
legitimate business now?
MR. BOREMAN:

It is now because of the Eighteenth

Amendment.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BOREMAN:

I think* But possibly before, I think

that •— as I recall it, I think there is a case cited in

34
Sax’s article in the Yale Law Journal, in which a brewery
was put out of business by a zoning ordinance, and that was
upheld by this Court.
I think before the Eighteenth Amendment, I think
that there might be basis for prohibiting businesses that
might be called a noxious substance.
But this is a legitimate business.
And my position, Your Honor, is that what we have
here is a taking.
Now, this Court has —QUESTION: Was it a taking when it was 15 percent?
MR. BOREMAN:

I think it was, Your Honor, I think

anything in excess of ten percent
QUESTION:

But you didn't — there was no complaint

then.
MR, BOREMAN: Well, the tax only lasted a year.
The parking operators wanted to see if they could live with it.
You asked why they hadn't gone out of business today.

They

have been trying to see if they could live with it, all
through this ,
It started out at 10 percent in 1962, and they
attacked them.
By the way, when it was attacked in 1962, there was
no attack on the basis of confiscation or on the basis of
a Public Authority competing.

If you look at the opinion

35

which declared the '62 ordinance invalid, you will see that
the Court said, We cannot say there is confiscation in here,
because there's nothing in the record to substantiate.
The plaintiffs didn't put any record in.
Now, they lived with the ten percent tax until '69.
It was raised to 15 percent. They objected vigorously before
the Council and so forth, but they decided to live with it.
It lasted one year and then the city again came along and
raised it to 20 percent. That's what broke the camel's back,
and they come in and decided to fight it.
QUESTION:

What is there in the record to show, using

your language, that that broke the camel's back, are there
any financial reports in here from any of your clients?

MR. BOREMAN: Yes, Your Honor»
Yes, Your Honor.

'69, for the whole year of 1970.

will note that, on 46 locations it shows

MR. BOREMAN:
QUESTION:

What is that again, Your Honor?

Passing the tax on.

MR. BOREMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, our position

is that because the Parking Authority is in direct competition,
standing right next door to many of these garages and lots,
and charging fifty percent already less than what we have, for
us to raise the rates, as the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
points out
QUESTION:

Well, why don't you make them raise

their rates?

MR. BOREMAN:

No,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

That's all I meant.

MR. BOREMAN:

No, I abandoned that argument, Your

Honor, because I'm afraid that it's a hopeless attempt.
QUESTION:

Mr. Boreman, the figure that's been

mentioned here, and I think it's in the opinions of the court,
is that 71 percent of the parking spaces available are
privately owned and operated, —
MR. BOREMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

— the city having 29 percent.

MR. BOREMAN:

Twenty-five percent.

QUESTION: Twenty-five percent?
MR. BOREMAN:

Yes, and there's four percent

•scattered around to small operators.

39

QUESTION: Right.

Has that 25 percent remained

fairly constant over, say, the last five to ten years, or
has it —
MR. BOREMAN:

No, not the last ~ no, it's ten

years„
Your Honor, let me say this, when the Parking
Authority was organized there were three garages originally.
It increased to eight.

There are now fifteen.

And in the

last five years I think there have been about three or four
parking garages organized.
Nov;, they all weren't in the downtown area, by the
way.

They were —* some of them were in what is known as a

subsidiary business area, what we call East Liberty, for
example, or Shadyside.
QUESTION:

Is there an exhibit that shows the dates

of the introduction of the government-owned parking facilities?
What I'm trying to get at is —
MR. BOREMAN:
QUESTION:

Exhibit —

— the rate of increase of the publicly

owned garage and parking facilities in the downtown Pittsburgh
area,
MR. BO REMAN:

Yes, Exhibit 11, which I think is the

study by Wilbur Smith, yes, gives those statistics, Your
Honor.
QUESTION:

Is that —• which volume is that in?

40

HR. BOREMAN:

That commences on page 616 of the

record.
QUESTION:

Page 616?

MR. BOREMAN:

And it — it's quite a lengthy study,

and I can't put my finger on the exact spot where it gives
the number of parking authority garages, but, Your Honor,
I don't think we have — we have placed in the record all
of them, because since this case was tried, there are several
new ones.
I'm referring to the Wilbur Smith study, which is
quite lengthy, and which was prepared for the Parking
Authority in 1969.
I might add this, Your Honors, too, we have in
Pittsburgh a nother public authority called the Auditorium
f

“ vt

Authority, and they are the Authority that built the Three
Rivers Stadium, and also our Civic Arena, and they have in
turn — the Auditorium Authority, for example, has leased the
parking space to the public Parking Authority itself, and
the Authority in turn has leased it to one of these
plaintiffs, Alco Parking, to operate for them.
So, in addition to the normal Parking Authority
spaces in the downtown central location of Pittsburgh, the
Three River Stadium Authority, which I think is over 2,000 or
3,000 spaces, is also run by a public authority leasing to
the Parking Authority, and there are other public bodies

41
doing the same thing.
We have in Pittsburgh this Authority operation of
public parking facilities, all in competition with private
operators.
Nov;, I don't think that the question of whether the
rate can be passed on is open to a factual determination by
this Court, especially when the Supreme Court has so found it.
And, although the Court of course is free to make it, I
submit that it is a factual finding found by the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania in its finding.
I would like to say, Your Honor, that this Court
on many occasions has not hesitated to declare a taking
where the police power has been exercised, and I'm thinking
of cases like Pennsylvania v. Mahon, and United States y. -—
well, not — cases like Pennsylvania v. Mahon and other cases
which we have cited in our brief dealing with the regulation
of the police power.
airline cases,

Also cases like U, S. vs. Causby, the

Griggs vs, Allegheny County, and the case of

Armstrong v. United States, where this Court determined that
the immunity of suit privilege given to the United States
does not protect it against a claim of a mechanic's lien
holder.
Now, I say there is no reason in my mind why the
same principle cannot be applied to a taxing statute. And
I think the comment of —■ or rather the study made by

42
Professor Sax in the Yale Law Journal is a very cogent
The Supreme Court adverted to it, and I submit

treatment»

that it is a rational theory as to the fact that the excessive
imposition of a tax cam be equally a taking as the excessive
and wrongful imposition of a police power statute,
QUESTION:

Well, you think — I suppose you think

it would be a taking also if the City of Pittsburgh, if it
didn't operate any parking lots of its own, simply imposed
a minimum schedule of parking fees in order to limit the
entry of cars into the downtown area, and they put the minimum
price high enough so that people wouldn't pay .it,
MR, BOREMAN;

I don't know, Your Honor,

I don't

know whether that would be a taking or not, because it seems
to me that unless —
QUESTION:

Suppose it just — suppose it just

barred all downtown parking?
MR, BOREMAN;

As a police power regulation?

That, Your Honor, seems to me to tie in with the
Sax thesis.

There you have — there you don't have government

enterprise, you don't have the government resource enterprise
operating. It has not itself gone into an enterprise
activity in competition; it has made a police power regula­
tion in which it says that for the benefit of all, health-wise,
let us say, we will bar parking.
That is a different story, and it might be under

43
Sax's rationale that that is a legitimate activity»
QUESTION;

Well, suppose they do it to see to it

that people come into the center of town on a publicly owned
bus system or subway system or some such reason as that?
MR» BOREMAN;

I think there they would have to pay

compensation, because that’s a resource activity.

I think

to place the burden of the cost of that on a small selective
group is exactly the idea of the thing that ought to be
prohibited.
There they take on a resource activity.

But now I

say that —
QUESTION:

As long as ~~ the tax in this case, at

first at least, was on until you managed to get it invalidated,
was on the city activity and on the private activity also.
MR. BOREMAN:

Yes.

MR. BOREMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, the ~

QUESTION: Well now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
And when they put the tax — and I'm sure before the tax went
on, the rates were disparate also, because you say the
Parking Authority has an advantage.
MR. BOREMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, if they put a level tax on, the two

remain disparate, but they both are suffering the burden to
that extent, they're both paying the tax.

44
MR. BO RE MAN 5

But the Parking Authority has —
f

QUESTION;

I understand.

MR. BOREMAN s

— has other advantages which may —

enables it to charge lower rates.
QUESTION:

But that was true before the tax went

on.
MR. BOREMAN:

Yes, and would still be true if they

did what you say.
QUESTION: But why would you say that the government
resource is enhanced, if they tax both the city and the
private?
MR* BOREMAN; Because by reason — because, Mo. 1,
this tax is so excessive? and, No. 2, by reason of the other
advantages, we still cannot compete.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but —

MR. BOREMAN:

It is the excessive tax in addition.

And you say if they put it on both., the Parking Authority
still has the advantages of no real estate tax, no income
tax, —
QUESTION: But they always had that, or they would
never have put this special tax on.

They always had those

advantages, didnf t they?
MR. BOREMAN:

Yes. But now —- they always didn't

have the twenty percent tax.
QUESTION:

Now, what -—

And weren't they always full?

45
MR» BOREMAN:

Beg pardon?

QUESTION: Weren’t the public parking lots always
full?
MR. BOREMAN;

No, Your Honor»

No.

They're full at

certain peak hours, but at other —
QUESTION: Well, weren’t they always full at certain
peak hours, just as yours are full at certain peak hours?
MR. BOREMAN:

Generally, yes.

Generally, yes.

QUESTION: So how is the fact that they don’t pay
you, they're not going to the other place, there's no room
in there from twelve to two.

Am I right?

MR. BOREMAN: That may be right, for that —
QUESTION: So how are you going to lose from twelve
to two if you raise your rates from twelve to two?
MR. BOREMAN:

Because your business doesn't just

go on for two hours a day, Your Honor, it goes on for twentyfour hours.
QUESTION:
I'm talking about.

All right, but that's the only two hours
So you could raise them those two hours,

couldn't you, because you'd have no place to go?
MR. BOREMAN: Well, how much could you raise it?
The record shows -QUESTION:

I don't know; that's your problem.

MR. BOREMAN:
Your Honor

Well, the problem has been solved,

46

QUESTION:

You don't want me to solve —

MR. BOREMAN:

The problem has been solved in amount,

QUESTION: Well, let me solve your legal problem?
you take care of your economic problem.
MR. BOREMAN: Well, let me point this out, that the
record shows by the testimony of the City Treasurer that
in order to overcome this twenty percent tax you've got to
raise your rates 25 percent.
Now, how much can you raise it, even in that peak
time?
QUESTION; Twenty-five percent.
MR. BOREMAN: That's for the two hours.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BOREMAN: That’s not for the rest of the day.
QUESTION: Well, that would get you further away
from the pauper, —
MR. BOREMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, it would help, Your Honor.

— which you claim you’re going to be.

MR. BOREMAN:

May I point out another factor:

it is not only the Parking Authority. -QUESTION:

You just want business as usual,

MR. BOREMAN;
that’s fair.

No, Your Honor, we want business

It isn’t only —■ it isn’t only the Parking

Authority being fifty percent of the rates, don’t forget
hundreds of thousands of shoppers, if their rates get too

47
high and it becomes too expensive to come in town aren't
going to come in town? they're going to stay away and go out
to the shopping centers.

This is a business decision that

we've got to consider, too, in raising rates.
In other words, you just don't say, Well, there's a
tax of 20 percent, raise it 25, and everything will be
hunky-dory»
It's a serious business decision.
Now, what I'd like to say — I think it answers your
question, Mr» Chief Justice — is that it isn't -- and Mr,
Justice Brennan — it isn't just the Parking Authority
existing, it's the combination of this very excessive rate
plus the competition,

A parking rate of, say, five percent

or six mills or ten mills or ten percent, plus the competition,
might not be a taking.

It's the unheard-of, unequaled any­

where in the country, of twenty percent,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? Thank you, Mr. Boreman.
Mr. Lynch, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH LYNCH, JR. , ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LYNCH:

Yes.

May it please the Courts

With respect to the question of this Court reviewing
the facts, you stated in Fiske vs. Kansas City;
"This Court will review the finding of fact by a
State court ... where a conclusion of law as to a Federal

48
right and a finding of fact are so intermingled as to make
it necessary, in order to pass upon the Federal question, to
analyze the facts."
Furthermore, it is really incorrect to state that
tlie majority of the State Court found that the tax could not
be passed on in the form of a price increase, because the
four-three decision, Justice Eagen concurred in the result
only.
So I don't think you can infer necessarily that
Justice Eagen — excuse me, Justice O'Brien concurring in
the result also concurred in the conclusion that the tax
couldn't be passed on.
I think it's only fair to say that three of the
Justices, of the seven Justices of the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court, concluded that the tax couldn't be passed on.
Reference is made to the inability to persuade the
Authority to raise rates after the tax was increased.
There is nothing in this record to show that any approach
was made to the Parking Authority, and that a request for
rate relief was refused.

Nothing in this record on that.

With respect to the confiscation and the growth of
the Authority into the private area, at the time of McGillick,
in 1964, that case was a case stated, and among the stipulated
facts were that there were in existence at that time 5,100
Authority spaces.

49
And now in 1970, in September at the time of trial
in this case, there were in existence 6,100 spaces.

Hardly

a record of a wildly spawning Authority operation at the
expense of private industry.
Reference is made to Professor Sax.

I think it

should be clear,from a reading of the majority opinion, that
great weight is placed upon the opinions of Professor

Sax

about government acting in an entrepreneural capacity rather
than as an arbitrator.
Interestingly enough, in a later article, Professor
Sax states, and I quote, "I am compelled however to disown
the view that whenever government can be said to be
acquiring resources for its own account, compensation must
be paid.

I now view the problem as considerably more complex."
So we have a decision where Professor Sax wrote

originally that his opinions did not square up with the
decisions of this Court.

The court below in the majority

opinion adopts Professor Sax's theory, even though they don't
square up with the decisions of this Court; and now Professor
Sax disowns his theory.
With respect to the question of whether or not
supply exceeds demand, Mr. McNeil, a witness for the
respondents, was asked;"What is the shortage?"
"There is a present deficiency of about 4,100 spaces
in the survey area,"

50

"That is in downtown Pittsburgh?"
"Answers

That's in the central business district,

which will increase to approximately 7,500 spaces based on
developments that are currently underway."
Reference is made to the exhibit in the respondents'
brief on page 48a, and I think this illustrates the point
the petitioner makes with respect to the quality of the
evidence presented in the court below.
Thera, Justice Kramer of the Commonwealth Court,
in his dissent, put in tabular form the findings that the
engineer had compiled to show the income versus expenses
of the respondents.

And if you look at that exhibit, to

see how easy it is to manipulate this type of evidence,
these first seven companies, the record shows, are owned by
one man, one man owns seven companies.

The first two companies

show losses, dropping down to the fifth company, it shows
a profit of 16,126, and then another company shows a loss of
5,384.

So if you combine companies one, two and five, with

company No. 4 — one, two and six with company No, 5, two
of the unprofitable operations in the study would be
eliminated.

And the remaining one still would be profitable.

So, evidence like this clearly is subject to
manipulation.
