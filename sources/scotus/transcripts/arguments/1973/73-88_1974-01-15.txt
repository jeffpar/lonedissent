MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear

arguments next in No* 73-88, United States against Edwards.
Mr. Kerman, you may proceed whenever you are
ready*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD R. KORMAii, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KORMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

That

court reversed judgments of conviction entered by the UnitedStates District Court for the Southern District of Ohio,
convicting Eugene H. Edwards and the late William T. Livesay,
who died subsequent to the granting of the writ, of attempting
to break into a United States post office in violation of
18 USC Section 2115.
The court of appeals held that certain scientific
evidence, which established that paint chips which were
found on the clothing of both of these gentlemen came from
the same source as paint chips on the window of the post
office

where the attempted burglary had taken place and that

this evidence was the fruit of the unlawful taking of the
clothing of these two gentlemen some ten hours after their
arrest on the morning following their arrest.

Although the

■

of Mr. Edwards was lawful--it did not in fact reach
issue as to Mr» Livesay—
to take the clothing,, it held that the taking i:

fatally

defective because a warrant had not been obtained for the
search and seizure of the clothing.
The issue presented here is whether the
to search an individua'

arrant or an

showing of probable cause, which arises by vir
lawful arrest, is somehow dissipated if it is not ©xereis
"substantially contemporaneousXy with the arrea

MR. KORMAN:

Presumably it has'been raised as an

alternative grounds for affirmances although it was rot raised
. as an issue in -our petition

£02

raised, as I understand it, in the opposing papers on
certiorari.

But, nevertheless, I think it would still be

helpful to start this case where it began, in Lebanon, Ohio,
around 10s45 in the evening, on May 31, 1970.
At this point , I would refer the Court to

1

.rap

which is one page 1 of a supplemental appendix which we filed
yesterday and which might bs helpful if the Court'had while
discuss the facts.

1

In the event, that it had not yet been

distributed, 1 gave nine copies to the Clerk right now

and

he might be able to distribute it.
I said yesterday we filed a supplemental appendix
which contained a map of the area.
The map is a map of approximately two or three
square blocks.

And around 10:45 in the evening a tan Plymouth

pulled up at South Sycamore Street, which is a.block from the
Lebanon post office, and parked at No. 124 South Sycamore
Street.

Three'gentlemen emerged, took something.- out of the

trunk of the vehicle and began walking towards the business
district.
This scene was viewed by several people who

were

sitting on the porch or looking out of their windows.
them called the police and told them that three strange

they were walking it

north-north easterly direction, that

they had just cane from that portion of the Post Office ..and
being perhaps naturally suspicious-since this was 10:30 at
night in a business district on a Sunday night which' Vas not
to his knowledge terribly crowded

with people--he decrdec1.

to follow them.
And so as they walked he drove behind

them and they

made a turn on West Main Street to begin walking towards
South. Sycamore and by the time Agent Ashley had. gone to West
Main Street, over the radio of his ear he had heard thar
the burglar alarm had been sounded at the post

office.

He thereupon stopped these two gentleman, asked them
to get into his car, which they did without drawing a revolver,
and then he drove back to the post office, got out of the car.
By that time other police officers had arrived on the scene.
He examined the bank and the area right where he had seen
these gentlemen emerge from, and discovered that ”~n fact there
had been an attempted burglary.

There were burglares tools,

the screen had apparently been tampered with, and also he
noticed paint

chips near the area as well.

And it was at

that point that he told these gentlemen that they were under
arrest, ahc they were taken into custody.
These two gentlemen were Mr. Edwards,• who is a
respondent here, and one Hundley, who was not convicted ox

’

ultimately pled

guilty to hai
here.
ht the time ell of this was transpiring

the

defendant Livesay was observed back on 118 Sycam
hopping over the hacr fence and hiding in tk- hr.she/:
South Sycamore Street»

He had been observed by

who lived in the house and who had earlier was -.nr c£
neighbors who had observed the three gentlemen •
the tan Plymouth»
He then saw Mr. Livesay run towards the Plymouth
and hide in the Plymouth#where Mr. Livesay was ultimately
discovered by another patrolman who placed him under arrest
and brought him-to the scene of the crime.
After these ..gentlemen were placed in .custody and
taken into the station house"- this is approximately :icu11; 30 on a Sunday night.they were placer in custody
the following morning the police# having notit -

established that the paint chips that were found in their
clothing came from the same source as the paint chips from the
window of the post office»
Prior to trial, a motion to suppress was made, and
I note only for the purposes of information that the motion
to suppress only dealt with the probable cause aspect and did
not involve the issue that was

ultimately raised in the

court of appeals and decided by

the court of appeals»

At trial the evidence was as I have described it:
The observations of the patrolman, the neighbors in the
surrounding area, and of course the testimony of two people
who made, the scientific analyses.
Q

Did you tell us that Mr. Edwards had filed

something personally here?
MR. KORMAN:

Yes, we received a copy of the

document, a petition or an application, for an extension of
time to—
Q

When did it come in?

MR. KORMAN:
copy here.

It was several weeks ago.

It was handwritten.

I have my

We received a copy of it.

I looked through the Court's file yesterday in the
’docket room, and I did not notice it among the papers there.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

The Clerk is checking

on it: right now.
Q

As I understand from what you said, it is in

10
that document primarily that the claim is made that the
arrest was invalid-,
MR. KORMAN:

That's correct.

The court of appeals in a rather exhaustive opinion
rejected the argument that there was no probable cause for
the arrest, held that the police officers

acted as reasonable

prudent men should have under the circumstanes.
However, it held that the seizure of the clothing
some ten hours after the arrest was invalid.

The court

reasoned that since the arrest was not contemporaneous--the
search was not contemporaneous with the arrest—it could not
be justified as a "search incident to an arrest," and struct
down the taking of the clothing because there was no warrant
even though, as 1 indicated earlier, it found probable cause
to justify the actual taking of the pants independent of the
probable cause of the arrest.
We have filed a petition for certiorari not only
because of the conflict among the circuits but the importance
of the issue in both federal and state prosecutions? and
indeed we have been advised by the Attorney -General of Ohio
that a predictable spate of habeas corpus litigation has
already

begun, that in the Southern District of Ohio alone

two habeas corpus petitions have already been granted in
Dean v. Gray and Carpenter v. Gray, and they are pending
before the Sixth Circuit.

And there is as yet another

II
petition for habeas corpus in a case called Hoskiason
Vo Gray, raising the same issue as involved in this case in
the Sixth Circuit*
The principal error—
Q

Before you

leave the facts , there is one

thing that is not clear to me, and I would like to ask you
were these men asked to discard their old clothing and given
new clothing as a matter of routine jail procedures or were
they asked for their clothing for the purpose of making this
search?
MR. KORMAN:

That question was put to the police

officer who was .in charge and he started to answer what they
do generally and then he stopped himself and he said, "Do you
mean, generally or what did we do in this case?"
Whereupon, they said, "Well, what did. you do in
this case?”
And he said that they took it the morning after
apparently with the express purpose not in mind of holding
it for inventory or exchanging it for jail clothing.
Apparently they had no jail clothing since they had to go out
and purchase this clothing.

So that it was taken with the

express purpose of conducting the analysis that was
ultimately conducted.
Q

That is your inference, is it, from the facts?

MR. KORMAN:

That.is correct.

12
0

That was my understanding, but I was not sure..

Q

Do you think it would make a difference,

Mr» Korman—would you have a different case if routinely the;;.;
mad® anyone who

was jailed changed into regular prison

garb?
MR. KORMAN:

I believe that we would« although

"v.

is a Case in the Fifth Circuit called Britt v. the Uri'
States in which that had been done and the clothing 2 bellevt
deposited and held for about three days afterwards, and the
court of appeals said you could not take the clothing three
days afterward even though it had already been taken from the
defendants without a warrant.
It is our view, as 1 shall elaborate, that it is,
as the Court, observed in the Robinson case, it is a fact of
the arrest which gives rise to the right to seise and take
th4 clothing and that under those circumstance it does not
matter and there is no reasonable basis to draw a
distinction between takings which

occur five minutes after

the arrest or five hours' after the arrest,
Q

But you do not and'think on this record you

cannot seek to justify this search as an inventory search1*
MR. KORMAN:
Q

No..

No attempt was made to do that»

Of the kind that is routinely made in jails

before a person is put in a cell and maybe sometimes thereafter
if they had missed something.

13
That is correct.

MR. KOM'S:
Q

It is not that kind of a search?

MR. KORMAN:
Q

Ho, it la not.,

The clothing was taken for the purpose of

searching the clothing?
MR. KQRMANs
Q

For evidence of guilt.

MR. KQRMAN:
in the prison.
Q

That is correct.

Right.

An there was no other clothing

So apparently—
They went out and bought it specially.

MR. KQRMAN;

Exactly.

By the way, part of the reason for the delay of
ten hours—it could have been reduced to about two hours—was
that they decided to wait until morning to buy them a new
pair of clothing before they actually made them undress in
the prison and give up the clothing that they were wearing.
So that this is a clear case in which the police officers
acted reasonably under any definition of the term,

ilnd the

conclusion of the court of appeals that they acted unreason­
ably is really based, we believe, in a mistaken reliance on
cases involving search incident to an arrest, which involved
the searches of homes and other similar areas where a
defendant happened to be arrested in his house.

And under

those circumstances it was held that when you. arrest someone
in his house, you cannot go search the whole house because

14
of the fortuitous circumstance that you happen to have
arrested him there.
circumstance was not

And* of course* in some instances the
just fortuitous* but the police* knowing

that they would bo able to search a

whole house if they

happened to find a defendant there to arrest him would plan
the arrest accordingly.
Q

Do you think, Mr. Korman, your situation would

be any different or 'would your position be any different if
promptly on their arriving at the station they handed them
substitute jailhouse clothes, took their regular clothes,
put them in a sealed bag and gave them a receipt, and than
put it in a locker and than the next morning went into the
locker and got the clothes and sent them to the laboratory
for the chemical analysis?
MR. KORMAN:

X think it would be different.

It

should foe different, but X am not. sure that the Sixth
Circuit would think so.

They expressly rejected, for

example, the holding of the court of appeals for the Second
Circuit in which something precisely like that had been done;
and six hours after the clothing had actually been taken from
the defendants,-the FBI picked tip the clothing to conduct
scientific samples, and the Second Circuit said that is
perfectly all right.

And in the opinion of the court of

appeals, they appeared to reject even that reasoning of the
Second Circuit

3.5

Q

In other words , the Second Circuit reasoned

that they had the clothes already in custody- and they did
not .need a warrant to get them?
I®. KORMANt

That is right*

And that seems to.

make-"Q

1 suppose what you are saying in effect is

that they had both the clothes and the people in custody
here and they could take the clothes any time they wanted to.
MR. KORMANs

That is correct*

Normally you want a

warrant because you want to interpose a neutral and detached
magistrate between the police and the initial intrusion upon
the privacy of the individual.
Q

In other words, if I understood your answer

correctly, you would he making the same argument if the
clothes had been taken away from them three weeks after their
arrest?
MR. KGRMANs

That is correct, provided they were

still in jail and that the purpose of the search was not to
harass them or in any way to—
Q

And still in the same clothes.

And you would

say that was a search incident to a lawful arrest?
MR. KQRMAN:

That is correct, because we believe the

word ”incident,” particularly as it was applied in the
Robinson case, means by virtue of the fact of the arrest.
That is, if you have his body in custody and in jail and he

16
is lawfully incarcerated, his privacy has been interfered
with to that extent, we think you do not need a neutral and
detached magistrate to decide whether you can search or not
or take an article of his clothing from him.
Q

So, you could have done it two years after

his arrest, correct?
MR. KORMANs

Carrying that reasoning out, that

■

be correct. If he is still in jail, if they are acting
reasonably—
Q

And

that would still be incident to his

arrest?
MR. XORMAN:
Q

In your view.

MR. KORMAN:
and custody.

That is.correct.

Incident caused by virtue of his arrest

And, as a matter of fact, I believe Your

Honor, in a case called Meinzer v« the United States rejected
out of hand the notion that someone in jail at any time could
complain about being searched or—
0

No,

no, that wets electronic .overhearing in

that case.
MR, KORMANs

That is true.

It is factually

distinguishable, blit I was merely talking about-the broad
proposition that Your Honor—
Q

That case did not involve the claim at all of a

search incident to an arrest.

17
MEs XORMMs’s

1 understand that*

is that the case involved

What X am saying

«imply searching someone who is

lawfully in jail, and Your Honor rejected out of hand the
notion that someone in jail over and above any elate by
virtue of an arrest could even assert such a proposition.
We are not arguing, we are not going as far as that
language would take us? we are not saying that someone in
jail is totally at the mercy of the jailers with regard to
what they can do with him.

They couldn't strip search him,

they could not harass him, and. they could not undertake any
other kind of search unless it was undertaken in good faith
and reasonably motivated.
Q

You would say arrest or continued custody

carries with it the incidental right to search whether you
have probable cause to search the clothing or not?
MR. KOREAN;

That is correct, if you are looking

for evidence of a crime or contraband.
Q

If you are looking for evidence of a crime.

But vou do not have to have probable cause to believe in it.
MR. KORMMms

No.

That is correct.

lory rs you had probable cans® to believe
the man committed the crime to arrest him.
MR. KOREAN:

That is correct, because that is what

gives rise to your right to—
Q

Would you search him if he is out on bail?

10
MR. KORMAN;
Q

Ho.

So, the difference is whether he has got bail

money?
MR. KORMAN:

Or whether he is a bailable risk.

It

is not so much the difference—of course, if he has the bond
money—
Q

What today is not a bailable risk?

MR. KORMAN:

I think there are certain circum­

stances under which—
Q

A robber is a bail®±>le risk.

MR. KORMAN%
Q

That is correct.

If he had money for bail, you could not search

him without, a warrant.
MR. KORMAN:

Mot because he had the money for

bail but because he was already free, and to search him again
would involve an intrusion onto his privacy, which would be
not incidental to anything.
Q

And the difference is whether or not he has

the bail money.
MR. KORMAN:

The difference is that in one instance

he is free, and to search him would involve an intrusion on
his privacy.
Q

And the difference between being free and not

being free is m-o-n^e-y.
MS. KORMAN:

In most instances, that is correct.

19
Q

Mr, Korman, would you say that the search

conducted in the jail of these people's clothes has to have
a separate justification by way of reasonableness# even
though it is not subject to the warrant requirement?
MR. KQRMAH:

That is correct»

But when 2 say

reasonableness, I do not mean probable cause»

X mean

reasonable in the sense that they are not simply strip
searching them every hour for the purpose of harassing thorn*
Q

Reasonable in the sense ©f the Fourth

Amendment?
MR. KORMAN;

Yes# but I think the word reasonable

has a differant definition when you are talking about stopping
someone on the street for no reason and searching him and
when he? is already in jail and in custody and hits privacy
has been interfered with to that extent? it doe

not seem

to me that you need now the neutral and detached magistrate
that you would need# for. example, if you wanted to search hia
house.
Q

As I understood your, answer, it is not

reasonable-—your use of the word reasonable is not in the
Fourth Amendment sense, but it is in the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendment, due process sense, like Roachin
MR. KORMAN;

v*-California.

It would be in that sense but also

the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness.

The word reasonable

in the Fourth Amendment has not always been construed to

20

require a showing of probable cause for an intrusion on the
privacy of an individual»
For example, in ?erry v« Ohio the defendant was
stopped and frisked»

It was not said that you needed for

that particular interference with"his liberty, that you
needed probable cause»

And whit constitues a reasonable

search, even under the Fourth Amendment, 1 agree they may
overlap and really what 1 am probably getting to is a Fourth
Amendment reasonableness»
Q

Fourteenth—

MR. KOREAN:
Q

Fifth and Fourteenth.

MR. KOREANi
Q

Fourteenth, 1 am sorry.

Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment—

Because you were talking about harassment and

so on.
MR. KORMANs

Right.

But I

think to a certain extent

they would overlap in that harassing him, searching him every
hour, for

example, for the purpose of harassing him would

probably be a violation of both the Fourth and Fourteenth
Amendments because that would bs simply unreasonable conduct
on the part of the jailers.
On the other hand, in this ease for example, it
could hardly be said, even under the Fourth Amendment, if
probable cause is the standard and the court of appeals her®
found that there was probable cause in their opinion.

21
They said that we find there was probable cause .

And they

said that is still not enough.
Q

But no warrant.

MR. KORMAN:

That is correct, because there was .

warrant.
Q

Mr. Koraian, in Cooper v. California and ir-

Cady v. Domb row's ki this Court held a search to be reasonable
under the Fourth iUnehdment, even though there was no
question of probable cause really applicable to that fact
situation.

Is your position hare that that kind of test is

applied or the kind of test Justice Stewart suggests of
revolting the conscience, stomach pump type of thing?
MR. KORMAN:

I think it would depend.

As I said,

1 think it would be the kind of test Your Honor is suggesting

but also I think the protections of the Fourteenth and Fifth
Amendments overlap to a certain extent with the Fourth
Amendment and that of course the kind of conduct that was
involved in Roaehe and would clearly come under a Fourth
Amendment standard; but, for example, the cases that Your
Honor mentioned in Terry were cases which involved reasonable— «i.

,«■■■

ness in the sense that there was a legitimate law enforcement
purpose combined with an intrusion which was something less
than a full scale arrest and seizure of the individual.
that, it seems to me, is what we have here.
already in custody, he was in jail.

Here he was

And

22
Q

Do you have probable cause too here?

MR* KQRMAN;

Yes, we do.

And the court of appeals

so found.

Q

Should we purport to decide a case where there

i.s not any probable cause but he is nevertheless searched in
jail?
MR. KORMAHs
that here.

No, it is not essential that the Court

But in making the argument, I think I would not

want to concede that even if there was something less than
probable cause here that the search-—•
Q

Because at the time you searched him, you had

probable cause, I take it, for the arrest—•
MR, KORM&Ns
Q

That is correct.

--namely, that you had cause to believe that

he had committed this crime.
MR. KORMAN:
Q

That is correct.

And that by the time you searched him, you

knew that they had crawled through a window.
MR. KORMAN;
decide it.

Correct.

And Your Honor said need you

I actually should have responded that I think you

already have in the Robinson case

where there was no reason

on the part of the officer to believe that the defendent was
armed, or that there would be any. evidence in crime in saying-..
that we do not care what the officer thought, the Court said
the right to search arises, from the fact of the arrest? and

23
we are not going to look into whether the officer really had
any reason to believe that ha was going to find a gun in the
cigarette pack.
Q

But, nevertheless, this would be an ■, fortiori

case if there was probable cause.
MR. KORMAN:
Q

That is correct.

The whole thrust of your argument in your

brief at least, and I think now, is that this search was
valid because it was a search incident to a valid arrest?
MR. KORMAN:
Q

That is correct.

If that is correct, 1 do not quite understand

your answer to ray Brother Marshall’s question of a while ago
tfosfc why would not search foe equally valid if mad® of this
mar after he had been released on bail.

He still had been

arrested and would it not equally be a search incident to a
valid arrest?
MR. KORMAN:

No, because we are not. simply—I would

like to gat away from the phrase "incident to."
that

The reason

.we say you do not need a warrant if he is in jail is

because his freedom has already been restrained and he is
in custody, and to go and look in his pockets or take his
shirt does involve really a substantial additional intrusion.
On the other hand, if he is out on bail, then he is
out free.
Q

He had been in jail.

He had been arrested.

24
MR.- xorm&Nj
something more.

Yes, but the seizure now involves

He is free.

It involves picking him up.

It involves saying, "Take off your clothes."

2i is a

substantial additional intrusion onto his privacy, which is
net so if he is already locked up in jail.
Q

Then maybe I do not understand your argument.

I thought, as I said, that your argument was that this was
incident to a valid arrest and that is the way yon justified
its validity.
MR. KOFMLftN;

That is a catch phrase, and I am

reminded of Mr. justice Holmes" statement that it is on© of.
the misfortunes of the law that ideas become insisted in
phrases and thereiffcer for a long time cease to provoke
further thought.
“ *-*•

Now, the notion-"

ar:

Q

Those were, his words, but I just; wanted your

thoughts, what your justification is.
MR. KORMAN:

l think the phrase “incident to an

arrest" embodies certain value judgments.

That is, you can

search someone after hs is. arrested because you alredy have
him in custody, already have a valid basis for his arrest,
and you. do not have to go to a neutral magistrate to go that
one step further.
On the other hand, we would say if he is out free
and he is walking in the streets and he has been released
from bail, then stepping him all over- again, detaining him

25
for however short a period of time and taking his clothing,
that does involve a significant additional intrusion on his
privacy.
Q

Sven though he had been validly arrested?

MR. KORMAK:

Even though he had been validly

arrestedjf because it is a different kind of intrusion, onto
his privacy.

Here he is now free.

He is free to do what as

chooses as long as he reports to court when ordered, and to
stop him, to place him under a temporary detention, simply
involves a kind of additional intrusion which—
h Q

1 guess then your argument in rather—and you

tell me if I am wrong, I am trying to understand it—is that
he is validly in prison? in custody and for that reason he
can be searched? is that it?
MR. KGRMAN:
Q

That is correct? because the search—

It is not incident to an arrest.

It is

because he is validly locked up? is that it?
MR. KORMAN:

That is correct.

And his freedom has

been interfered with in that way.
Q

And therefore the arrest is good s© long as he

is validly locked up? the search is valid? in your submission?
even if it is five years after his initial locking up?
correct?
MR. KORMAN:

Hopefully in these times it would not

last that long? but I would say that if you carried my

26

argument out to its more drily logical extreme, that .is where
it would lead you, yes.
Q

Are you

not addressing in this case what in

effect is the first search*

It seems to me there may be a

difference between what sometimes is called an inventory
search—a person is lawfully arrested, imprisoned and usually,
as I understand it, he is then searched usually forthwith.
Here, for reasons that have been indicated, he was not
searched until the next morning and substitute clothes could
be made available*
Once in inventory search had been completed and
prison clothes had been provided, there would be no further
occasion fox’ that type of search, as I understand it, unless
there was some reason to believe he had been the recipient of
& weapon secreted into the jail or drugs or the like.
MR. KORMAN:
Q

Do you draw that distinction?

MR. KORMAN:
Q
lo3©3

That is correct.

Yes, I would.

I would, Your Honor.

I suppose you would say a man

who is in jail

his Fifth Amendment rights also?
MR. KORMAN:

Which Fifth Amendment rights are you

referring—
Q

Fifth.

MR. KORMAN;
Q

Which ones?

A man in jail.

27
MR. KORMAN:
Q

Mo, which Fifth Amendment rights?

Se If •“incrimination.

MR. KORMAN:

No, 1 would not say that.,, only because

it reflects totally different values than a Fourth Amendment
right of privacy.

The purpose of having a neutral &:vl

detached magistrate is to interpose a magistrate between
the police and some substantial interference with the privacy
interests of the individual.

And if he is already in jail

and his privacy interests have been interfered

with in that

way, we would take the position that looking into his
pockets only involved a minimal additional intrusion
which should not need a magistrate to authorize.

On the

other hand--Q

That would be true on the street then too.

MR. KORMAN:
Q

Pardon me?

That would bo true on the street then, because

it is only minimal.
MR. KORMAN:

The Court has held, for example, that

you can stop someone briefly on the street and searcl him
without a warrant and less than a probable cause in Terry.
Q

Empty his pockets?

MR. KORMAN:
Q

l say empty his pockets?

MR. KORMAN:
categorically.

It depends on what the frisk reveals.

Not yet.

1 could not answer that

If he felt a hard object, for example, he

28
probably could stick his hand in his pocket—
Q

You said not yet rather hopefully.

MR. KORMAN:

No, no, 1 meant not yet in the sense

that it was premature for the police officer to reach into
his pockets immediately.
Q

'The First Amendment is gone too?

MR. KORMAN:
Q

Ho.

That involves rights of privacy.

MR. KORMAN:

I think that to a certain extent whan

yon are in jail, your freedom of association is interfered
with, and to that extent you do not have the same rights—
Q

You cannot write letters?

MR. KORMAN:
there.

No.

1 think the test is reasonableness

The regulations which restrict your right of free

speech in jail have to be based on some reasonable justifies"
fcion by the jailers.
Q

All these rights become modified once a person

becomes—
MR. KORMAN:
Q

Necessarily so, I think.

His right of association in prison is somewhat

limited to jailers and fellow prisoners for one thing, is it
not?

But I would like .to get away from the First and the

Fifth Amendment here and get back to this case.

I understood

your response at an earlier point was resting on the recent
Robinson case, that a custodial arrest—that is, an arrest

29
followed by custody, is what you were standing on to support
the search and that was what we had just held a
in Robinson»
MR» KORMAN:

That is correct.

Perhaps I went off

in trying to give a policy justification for that holding?
which is simply a statement of fact, and the policy justifica­
tion for it I think was stated in Mr» Justice Powell's
concurring opinion in Robinson, and that is essentially what
I am urging here? that once he is lawfully in custody, it
does not involve any additional substantial intrusion on his
privacy to then search him without a warrant, as long as the
police act. reasonably»

Mr. Smith?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. SMITH, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF 05’ THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SMITH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Before getting into the argument itself, I would
like

to comment briefly on the facts as they were indicated

by Mr. Korraan.
I am afraid he exaggerated at least respect»

First

of all', there may have been the intimation that the
respondent Edwards was one of the three individuals vrho left
the auspicious tan automobile.
the record which indicates that.

There is absolteiy nothing in
At no time, by no person,

30

was

he identified as one of the human beings who emerged

from that automobile.
There is nothing in the recrod

which in any way

associates him with the now deceased respondent Livesay.
Nor is there anything in the record x«rhich indicates, as I
think Mr. Kerman did; that when Officer Ashley first
observed the respondent Edwards and the man Hundley with,
whom he was ultimately arrested, that he was suspicious of
them.

He in fact

was not suspicious of them.

The record is replete with testimony that they
acted in a completely normal an unsuspicious manner.

When

observed them for the first time, they were already on the
sidewalk in front of rhe post office and at the north edge of
the post office.

From that point they walked one half block
■

- -'v*........

north and one half block west in a perfectly normal manner
until such time as he received the radio transmission
advising him that the post office alarm had been activated,
whereupon he apprehended them, put them in his automobile,
and took them back to the post office.
Q

Do you not suppose that the officer was

entitled to put the circumstances together, what he saw with
his eyes and what he heard over the car radio?
MR. SMITH;

Yes, he was? he certainly was.

And

that is exactly what he did.
Q

And you say that did not add up to probable

31
cause to stop them and arrest them?
MR. SMITH:

1 do not at this time want to make a

serious argument about probable cause.

That was made in the

district court# it was made in the court of appeals# it was
made both places unsuccessfully.

And I frankly do no-: hole

out nuch hope of making that argument successfully hers.

It

was for that reason that we did not talk extensively ox at ■ .
about, that in the

brief.

But those are facts that the Court

ought to consider.
q

it is stated in the petition for certiorari

that the question presented is whether whatt hapened here was
an unreasonable search and seizure when there was—-xt states
there was a lawful arrest-"after he had been lawfully arrested
I do not have before me • here your response to -/that petition,
and maybe you did pot make one.

But if that is' stated as the

question, 1 wonder even if it is open to you to make the
argument that the arrest was unlawful.
MR. SMITH:

We did respond and, to my knowledge, we-

I just do not know at this moment .whether we affirmatively
raised the probable cause issue in that response o.«. not.
q

Or whether you. accepted the question as frameu

by the government?
MR. SMITH:

Could you not argue to sustain the judgment

on that ground or, not?

MR. SMITH;

And it Ik

for that reason that to the extent that we can keep it open,
I would like to keep open the issue—
Q

But you do not want to waste your time

arguing it?
MR. SMITH;
G

What is this other paper, Mr, Smith, that was

referred to earlier?
MR. SMITH:
either.

That is.correct.

I do not have a copy.
If it please the Court, I do not know

I have never seen a. copy of it.
Q

Something that your client filed in longhand

apparently.
Q

You have not seen it either?

MR. SMITH:

I have not, Your Honor.

I became aware

of its possible existence for the first time at lunch with
Mr. Korean this afternoon.

I had not heard about it or seen

it prior to that time.
Q

I gather it is on file here?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
now o

The

Clerk is checking .

33
MR. SMITH:

What I would really like to talk about

is whether or not there was a warrant requirement for the
search in this case.
The existing authority in this Court, it seams to
me. makes it very plain that a search without'a warrant.
whether that is a search of a person or of a pice, is an
exceptional search and may be justified only if the
circumstances of that search bring it within one of the
exceptions to the warrant requirement which have been
previously established by this Court.
The Court said that in Beck.
It said it in Terry.

It said it in Kata.

And as recently as May of 1973 it «aid

that a warrantless search is an exceptional search in
ScimackaIrofch and in Cup v. Murphy.

So, I think that the Court is historically on
record as indicating that even in searches of persons, a
warrantless search is the exceptional search, unless it cornea
within one of the existing categories of exception.
Plainly one of the existing categories of exception
is

a

search incident to arrest.

This Court has always, in

talking about what is a search incident to arrest, required
that some time relationship exist between the time at arrest
and the time of search. . And it has done that properly
because of the reason for the exception.

The Court has saia

that the reason you may search incident to arrest is to, one,

34
protect the officer free weapons and, two, ascertain the
existence of and. preserve the destruction of evidence., which
may be used in a prosecution ultimately arising out of that
arrest»
It seems to me that when either or both of those
purposes Of the exception no longer exists, then the
exception ought no longer exist.

So that if by the mere

passage of time we have defeated the purpose of the search
incident to arrest

exception, then that exception no long;. .

has application.
The question of a search for weapons was. never
involved in this case.
evidence.

This was plainly a search for

&nd it is not a search to capture evidence,

it is

a search to ascertain whether or not the evidence ever
existed.

The passage of time, we subiH.it, the minimum of nine

or ten hours from the time of arrest until the time that, the
clothing was taken,defeats the purpose of taking the clothing
so as to preserve evidence.
Q

Would you think it would have been all right if

it were done two hours later?
MR. SMITH:

It depends what had happened in those

two hours, if it please the Court.

If the defendant, had

been placed in the jail cell by himself unattended during
which time he may have taken whatever action he wanted to
with respect to whatever evidence there may have been on his

35
person, 1 think it would maize a difference»

In the one

court of appeals case, which involved a delay of six hours,
the Court was very emphatic in indicating that during that
entire period of time the defendant was physically in the
company and in the custody of the arresting officers, so that'
there was no intervening opportunity for him to dispose of
the evidence had he wanted to»
Q

What is the case you are referring to?

MR, SMITHs
Q

I era sorry?

Florida case you are referring to in the Fifth

Circuit.
MRo SMITH:
Q

I am not sure.

Not important.

MR. SMITH:

I think that might be the Caruso case.

But, at any rate, it was very important to the Court of
Appeals in that case and it based its decision on the
incident to arrest exception.

It did not say that there was

not a blanket dispensation from the requirement to obtain a
warrant.

It said in this case this search was in fact a

search incident to arrest.

And it was such because it was

made during the arrest process, the incarceration process,
the booking process, during all of which time the clothing
of the defendant was under the constant observation of the
arresting officers.
Q

Would you think it would be reasonable to

36
assume that the arrested people her® did not have any idea
that some of these paint flakes, the evidence, was still
attached to their clothing?
MR.SMITH!

Yes, I would, Your Honor, and I think

that argues against th® incident to arrest exception.

If

defendant cannot be aware of the fact of the evidence on his
person, as the police officers could not have been because
of its rai crops cop ic size—
Q

Let us suppose that it had been impregnated in

the fabric and perhaps in the cuffs of his pants, which would
be a place where these things would lodge often, and ha was
shrewd enough to have taken his clothes, when he was not
observed, shaken them all out, brushed them, turned down his
pants cuffs, and scattered the paint flakes on the floor.
Then in the morning they carae in with a vacuum cleaner and
took up all this material and found it that way.
you think about that?

What would

Q

Search of his place of temporary habitation,

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, I think he has no privacy in

that sense to his place of habitation.

37
Q

Would that not be like the Abel search where

he was arrested and searched in his own room in the hotel, and
lie had thrown stuff in the wastepspar basket, and the Court
held that that was abandoned; so, he could no longer complain
of its seizure and its use,,
MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes, that would have application.

Would that not be the sort of situation the

Chief Justice just presented?

MR. SMITH:

I think that our position would b.,

If the taking of the clothing of an arrested

e

person

is merely a custodial taking--that is, if it is taken only
so that the inner workings of the polio© system can be better
expedited, that you would nonetheless require a warrant in
that case, for the reason that in our view of it, the mere
fact of arrest does not deny to the person arrested his
rights of property or his rights of privacy in his clothing.
So that if-—
Q

If he were, instead of being in the jail just

after arrest, if he were a convict in the state penitentiary,
would a search warrant be necessary for the compulsory
exchange of clothing and' the examination of his pockets
there?
MR. SMITH:

That is. again a different circumstance,

because the fact that I would want to emphasize here is that

39
this was not a routine custodial taking»

This was a taking

for the specific purpose of making a search, and it was
necessary for them to go cat and purchase clothing so that
substitute clothing could be had,

I might indicate this.

While, it is not all absoltuely clear from the record, what
they took from Edwards was a shirt, a sweater, trousers, and
his shoes.

What they replaced them with was a T-shirt and a

pair of trousers.

It is not a matter of record but it is a

fact that ha was in the jail for a week without a pair of
shoes until his wife was able to obtain a pair and bring them
to him.
'

Q

Then 1 take it the point of distinction you

are drawing, if I understood you correctly, was that this wa.^
taken for the purpose of making a search.
MR, SMITH:
Q

Yes.

And if that is so, then why is not the answer

to my penitentiary inmates situation exactly the same?
MR. SMITH:

It would be, if it were taken for the

purpose of making a search, we submit that a warrant would be
required, although plainly in those circumstances it is not
taken for the purpose of making a search.
Q

In pursuit of Mr, Justice Blackmun's question,

suppose that, making the search of his clothes, when he comes
into -the prison to be sure that he is not carrying narcotics
or any other dangerous material, they must got a warrant when

40
he arrives at.the prison?
MR» SMITH:
Q

That is—

An inventory search.

MR. SMITH:
Q

No, Your Honor»

Yes, an inventory search.

Do you regard a search for narcotics s.s an

inventory search?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, 1 regard what is truly an

inventory search, even though it may result in the location
of or the finding of narcotics, as an inventory search to
which historically the warrant requirement has no application.
Q

Of course they take the objects from the

clothes and they list them, package them, and I suppose in
time return them.
MR. SMITH:
Q

That is correct. Your Honor.

That is the idea of an inventory search.

MR. SMITH:

That is right.

It is a safekeeping

kind of taking.
Q

No real motive to look for evidence in your

traditional inventory search.
MR. SMITH:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And it is

for that reason that we submit no warrant is required for that
kind of search.

There was, however, in this case a specific

intent to search for evidence.
Q
here.

I am still having trouble with your posture

Suppose the warden of the state penitentiary is aware

41
that there are narcotics in the prison and so ha asks every
inmate to change clothing.

I understand your position, you

would require a search warrant?
MR. SMITHS

No, I would not, Your Honor. I think

there is just a completely separate set of circumstanced
involved in searching msn who are in a penitentiary who have
already been convicted of a crime than there is in the
removal of clothing from a person arrested on probable cause,
very tenuous probable cause, for the purpose of ascertaining

involve him in the matter for which he has been held or which
he is being held on probable cause.

There is an inventory of every­

thing he has which has been, if it is something not permitted,

He is giver, a receipt for it.

And then there is

a prophylactic search which is to see it he has any contraband,
weapons, narcotics, whatever.
Going back to this prophylactic search, if y-su wrll
stay with my term to distinguish that from the inventory
search, would you say they need a. warrant to make the
prophylactic search before he goes into Lorton Penitentiary,

for example?

Even if they find the narcotics? using the

MR. SMITH:

He is iri exactly the same kind of trouble?

yes.
I would like to comment briefly? if 2 may? on the
notion that somehow or other the mere fact of an arrest? the
mere fact of a custodial arrest? somehow or other brings
about a substantial diminution of the arrested person's
Fourth Amendment rights.
It seems to anomalous that a circumstance? that is?
an arrest? which plainly accentuates and puts into acute
focus his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights? his Fifth Amend­
ment rights to the extent that the arresting officers must
not only honor them but must in fact inform him as to what
they are, that

that same circumstance can act to diminish

what would otherwise be his plainly available Fourth
Amendment rights.
It seems to me a little bit like saying that if you

Q

At any point in this process, would it have

been reasonable to search his clothing for these paint
scrapings without a warrant?
MR. SMITH;

If the record were a little clearer as

to what the intent of the Lebanon Polios Department war.; when
they took Edwards to the jail, if there was something In the
record which indicated at that fcimethafc they had the intent

reasonable*
Q

You mean had they noticed the scrapings on

the sill before they took

him to the stationhouse and at

the gtafcionhouse proceeded immediately on booking him to ask
him to take his clothes off so that they could examined it

Q

Why do you need any probable cause to search

incident to an arrest?
MR. SMITH s
Q

Well—

There is nothing in the Robinson case that

says that Robinson8s clothes could have been taken off at
the time he was arrested.
Q

No, but there is a lot that says they could

be searched, if you will forgive the digression.
MR. SMITH?

The reason that I say that they could

not have made this kind of search at the moment of Edwards?5
arrest was because that kind of search, even using the purely
reasonable application that the government would urge, would
have been patently unreasonable.

There was simply not

factual reason at the time of his arrest to take his
clothing away from him.
Q

But suppose—-I am, putting it to you again--

before they had put him in the car, they had detected paint
scrapings on the sill at the post office and at that time said,
"Take your clothes off.

We want to examine them to see if

47
there are any paint scrapings on your clothing»"
MR. SMITH:

1 think that they could have done that

unless we get into the Roshan problem of humiliation.

But if

they had taken him directly to the stationhouee, under those
circumstances, under those facta , that ' his clothing could
reasonably have been taken from him then.
Q

What is there about the lapse of time,

Mr. Smith, that alters this situation?

That is, if they

have the right to search him within a short time, reasonable
time, after arriving at the stationhouse, what is it that
enhances his right of privacy or whatever other factors you
rely on, to raise a new barrier to the search?
MR. SMITHs

It is exactly this.

If the warrantless

search is in fact an exception to the warrant requirement,
the exception is rooted in the-» necessity or in the value to
society generally of preserving evidence.
The evidence can only reasonably be preserved if
the taking or if a search occurs at such a time when you can
expect the evidence to be reasonably there«

So' that if it

is reasonable to search immediately upon arrival at the
sfcationhouse because the defendant has had no opportunity to
disperse the evidence or to get rid of it or to destroy it,
it becomes unreasonable to search ten hours later or five days
later or five years later, as the government would insist,
because he has had during' all of that time ample opportunity

48
to dispose of the evidence®

And applying the old law school

maxixa that where the reason for the ruin ceases to exist, the
rule ceases to exit, to this situation, we can say - that where
the reason, for the exception ceases to exist, the exception
ought to cease to exist®
0

One of the things you are relying on is that

in that lapse of time he has had an opportunity to dispose
of the evidence®

"Respondent Edwards was arrested with a companion as he
walked away from the post office,” Officer Ashley testified
that he did not formally place them under arrest and so
advised them until after he had determined to his satifaction
