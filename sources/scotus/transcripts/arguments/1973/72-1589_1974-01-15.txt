MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next in 72-1589, Richardson against Raraires and others.
Mr. James, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DUNCAN M. JAMES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JAMES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
First I'd like to begin by correcting two citations
that appear in Petitioner's Reply brief that was filed on
January 8th.
The first correction is on page 4, footnote No. 3,
the citation of United States vs. Reese.

The Lawyers

Edition citation is ued there as 28, the correct citation
should be —
QUESTION:
MR. JAMES:
QUESTION:
MR, JAMES:
QUESTION:
MR. JAMES;

Let us have that page again, would you?
Page 4 —
Is that in your brief?
Of Petitioner's Reply brief.
Oh, I beg your pardon.

Thank you.

It's said to be 28 Lawyers Edition,

and it's actually Volume 23=
And on the next page, page 5, in the parentheses
it says James v. Bowman, 190 U.S. 124; the correct citation
is 190 U.S. 127.

4
Also 15 d like to point out to the Court that in
Mendocino County we have somewhat of an inadequate law
library, and we only have Lawyers Edition, and on page 4,
the citation on page 4, United .States vs, Reese is referred
to as being a note, and apparently this is an editor's note
regarding the right of women to vote.
However, the opinion as quoted in the footnote onpage 5 is a portion of the opinion of the Court.
What I'd like to do first, I think, is point out
to the Court how a x^oter registers, at least in Mendocino
County, California, being a small rural county in the north­
western part of the State.
Initially, the person desiring to register

makes

contact with the County Clerk or Deputy County Clerk and
completes a form.

That form appears in the Appendix to the

Petitioner's brief.
One of the questions in the form ist

Have you ever

been convicted of a felony?
If that box is checked yes, the person is given
another form, a portion of which is filled out by the
Deputy Registrar, and a portion of which is filled out by
the person who has been convicted of that felony.
The person who is convicted of the felony puts down
the date of the conviction, the jurisdiction where trie
conviction took place, and the offense for which he or she

5
was convicted.
That form is then forwarded to my office, for my
review.

Many times I have found in the past that the

individual completing the form will not give us adequate
information, and so we've asked for all of that detail so
I can contact, through the mail, the jurisdiction in which
the person was convicted, to get a certified copy of the
conviction.
After receiving the certified copy of the conviction,
I then proceeded to make a determination under the California
case, Otsuka vs. Hite, which is 64 Cal. 2d 534, to determine
whether or not that crime is infamous, as well as taking into
consideration Article II, Section 3 of the California
Constitution, and Article XX, Section 11 of the California
Constitution.
Under those, the case of Otsuka and those two
constitutional sections, the basic crimes that we look to
were murder, manslaughter, mayhem, rape, arson, robbery,
burglary, larceny, embezzlement or misappropriation of public
money, perjury, forgery, malfeasance in office, and bribery.
Prior to the Otsuka decision in California, any case
which, or any conviction which resulted in State prison
sentence was considered infamous.

Otsuka modified that

position.
Then, sometimes, on occasion we find that the person

6

has been convicted of an infamous crime, and I complete the
form, indicate whether or not the person is disqualified, and
I sign the form. And that form is sent back to the individual
who registered.
Now, in one instance in my county, after having
sent that form back, an action was brought against our
County Clerk, Viola Richardson, by a fellow who happened to
be named David Richardson, and it was no relation to her.
But also in that case I was sued, and so the case
in the county was Richardson vs. James and Richardson, rather
than Richardson vs. Richardson, because they didn’t want it
to look like a divorce action, and I was the cause of the
divorce.
In that case, what transpired was the plaintiff
proceeded under Section 350 of the California Elections Code,
requesting the court make a determination as to whether or
not his conviction was infamous.
QUESTION:
MR. JAMES:

Of what had he been convicted?
He was convicted of burglary in the

second degree, and he had served a sentence in the State
prison.

He had spent about eighteen months in -the ‘.State

prison, I believe? that conviction carries an indeterminate
term of six months to ten years in California.
And the court in that case decided that under the
Otsuka decision that that crime was in fact infamous, and that

OTBcnv.rv.t'vr» ssl

7
Mr. Richardson was in fact disqualified from the right to
vote.
That case is presently pending in the California
Court of Appeals.

By a stipulation of counsel,, it is

awaiting the final determination in this case.
QUESTION:
many of these people

How many of these applications, how
• how many applications to register,

in which it turns out that somebody has been convicted of a
felony, do you get in Mendocino County in the course of a year?
MR. JAMES;

Well, in Mendocino County, first let me

say we have approximately 25,000 registered voters; the
population of the county is around 60,000.
QUESTION:

It’s a relatively small county in

California.
MR, JAMES:

That's right.

There are about thirty counties, though, that are -or 25 counties that are smaller than us.
QUESTION;
MR. JAMES:

Smaller, unh~hunh.
In the course of a year, I would

imagine I receive no more than a dozen or eighteen.
QUESTION:

Well, would the constitutional question

be different if -there was only one?
MR. JAMES:
QUESTION:

Ilo, I don't believe so.

In fact ■*—

Do you have any idea how many we're

talking about in the entire State annually?

8

MR. JAMES:
QUESTION;

That attempt to register?
Yes.

MR. JAMES;

No, I could not tell you.

QUESTION;

Well, that doesn't include all those

who would register if they had known about it.
MR. JAMES:

No, that’s --

QUESTION:

It's well knox-m -that you won't register

them if they have been guilty of a crime,
MR. JAMES:
QUESTION;
MR. JAMESj
QUESTION;

-

I agree -so why bother to register.
I agree and -So there’s no accurate figures, I don’t

think, are there?
MR. JAMES:
on a Statewide basis.

No, not

I don’t believe there are

I can only speak as to my particular

county, and since we have —
QUEST I Oil;

Well, do you know how many convicted

people are in your county?
MR. JAMES:
QUESTION;

Excuse me,

1

didn’t hear the question.

Do you know hoxtf many people in your

county are convicted and therefore ineligible to vote?
MR. JAMES;

On a per-year basis?

QUESTION; Do you know how many?
MR. JAMES;

We convict approximately 250 people

QUESTION; Well, how many people move in there from

9
some place else?
MR. JAMES:

I can't tell you, our county is full of

beautiful redwoods, in which a great many peop3.e live a
very simple life, and these people, we don't know who's
involved or anything.
I will tell you, in Richardson, as a result of the
Richardson vs. James case, as a result of the Ramirez vs.
Brown case,

David Richardson was able to register to vote,

since there was no stay order and we had no way of knowing
whether or not this Court would grant certiorari; the
California decision is in effect.
QUESTION:

Was that objection to register in

Mendocino County?
MR. JAMES:

Yes, it was,

QUESTION:

Now, of these twelve to eighteen that

you say you estimate you get a year, how many of these
convicted felons would you estimate that you'd say fall
under the exceptions in Otsuka, or at least the definition in
Otsuka, that you respond by permitting them to register and
vote?

Half of them, or a third of them, or none of them, or

what?
Otsuka, as I understand it, made the statutory
definition much more flexible*
MR. JAMES:

Yes, it did,

QUESTION: And gave the people in your position

10

considerable discretion.
MR. JAMES:
QUESTION:

Yes, it did.
Which is exercised differently by

different district attorneys in the various counties, we're
told in these briefs*
MR. JAMES:

Well, let me point this out ~

QUESTION: Well, first, could you try to answer my
question, and then point out *?hatever you like.
MR. JAMES:

Okay.

I would say of 'the amount, the people that apply to
vote, maybe 25 percent fall into the crimes that aren't set
forth in Qtsuka, the constitutional provisions.

Most of them

seem to be burglary, or forgery.
In fact, the last one I had was just before I came
back here, and it was a forgery conviction.
QUESTION: And either forgery or burglary, in your
view, makes the man ineligible to register and vote?
MR. JAMES:
QUESTION:
MR. JAMES:

All, —
In your county.
Yes, -Mr. Justice.

It's because of

Article XX, Section 11 of the California constitution, that
specifically names forgery, and it's because of footnote 10
in Qtsuka that specifically names burglary.
QUESTION:
MR. JAMES:

Unh-hunh.
As being infamous crimes.

11

I’m simply looking to what Qtsuka did say —
QUESTI OH: Right.
MR. JAMES;

— and what the Constitution did say

prior to Ramirez vs. Brown decision,
QUESTION:

So far as you know is a convicted — is

any — a person convicted of either forgery or burglary
permitted to vote in any county in the State?
MR. JAMES:

It's ray understanding from the brief

filed by Respondents that, yes, some counties do permit it.
What happened is Qtsuka created a confusion.
QUESTION:
MR. JAMES:

Unh-hunh.
Throughout the county.

QUESTION: Right.
MR. JMES:

I would imagine some of the county

councils did not look to, or any further than Otsuka for an
interpretation.

Like I did do approximately five years ago

when I first became involved in this as District Attorney.
QUESTION:
MR, JAMES:

Otsuka was decided in what year?
I believe 1966,

QUESTION: Right,

How many counties are there in

your State?
MR. JAMES:

There's 58 counties, sir.

Now, as I pointed out, Mr, David Richardson proceeded
under Section 350 of the Elections Code, to make a determina­
tion

12

In the briefs for Petitioner — excuse me, for
Respondents, they argue that there are innumerable, where
there have been no violations since around 1906 or 1920, I
believe.
I'd like to point out to ‘the Court that at least
accepting what Mr. Justice Mosk of the California Supreme
Court said as being true, that there are over 250 violations
of the Elections Code, I vrould submit that most of the
violations in the Elections Code constitute misdemeanors
and, in California of course, would not disenfranchise a
person.
They point out, or Respondent points out in its
brief the possibility of voter fraud is almost non-existent
any more»

However, in the less metropolitan counties of

California, we don't have such sophisticated equipment as
voting machines, where you go in and apparently you pull
levers and then you pull the arm at one end,

just like

working a — I hate to use the analogy, but like a one-arm
bandit in Nevada.
We don't have that.

We have a little marker, that

is a little X, we go in and we press different little spots
with our own hand.
In footnote 26 Respondents argue that even though
California says that any person who is an elector under
Section275 of the Government Code, says any elector in the

13

State of California is entitled to hold office; they say
that it's fine because under our present system of politics
throughout the nation, as well as throughout California,
a person who has a felony conviction would be easily found»
And I'd like to set that aside for a minute, because
in my county, disregarding nine justice

court judges and

two Superior Court judges, there are eleven elected officials.
At the last election, only two of those eleven had
any opposition to office.

The two that did were the sheriff

and the treasurer; none of the others did.

And there was

no way for anybody —
QUESTION;

Would this be relevant to what goes on

in Los Angeles County, for example?

I'm not sure I get your

point.
MR. JAMES; Well, throughout California, many elected
officials occasionally do have opposition, and there is
basically no way to find out if a man has been convicted
of a felony, because in California, under Section 1203.4,
I believe, or 1203.3 of -die California Penal Code, a record
could be expunged, and a person is no longer checking a box
that says "yes, I've been convicted of a felony"; they can
now s ay "no".
And so -they talk about it's easy to discover, and
we submit that it's not as easy as they would represent it
to be.

14
MR- CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Roth-

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. ROTH, ESQ-,
AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR- ROTH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I come with what I think is a difficult case, in
this respect:

sociologically everything is against our

position.
In California, because of the Otsuka decision,
it’s unquestionably true that in 5 8 counties you had 5 8
different interpretations of what was an infamous crimeHistorically, there's no question that a compelling
State interest to protect the ballot box is no longer
necessary, at least

and I agree with what the Respondents

have set forth.
But the one thing that I come with is the
Constitution of the United States, and that's Section 2 of
the Fourteenth Amendment.
Now, I think that that is really the issue here,
as to whether or not this Court is going to take an area of
the Constitution — it's implied, but it's so clearly implied
that it's almost direct — and say that, this Court will say
tliat sociologically it's good, and consequently we should
say that Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply
to this particular problem.

15
Now, as I see it, in reading the many pages of the
globe, right in the beginning, everybody who aver mentioned
the problem of "except for rebellion or other crimes" did so
in a matter-of'fact way, because that was the accepted tenor
of the time.
Amendment.

But it was written into the Fourteenth
Unquestionably -the Fourteenth Amendment was to

prevent all discrimination because of race.

I don't think

there's any question of that.
But I think, as you read this, the people who worked
on the Fourteenth Amendment wanted to be sure that the States
still would have a little bit of leverage where criminals are
concerned.
Now, in California we don't say — they used to say
in our Constitution, "let the criminal be disenfranchised
forever", and our Constitution is now changed.
Justice Mosk in his opinion in the case below said
that he didn't think that was too important.
But I think it is, because our Constitution now says
that the Legislature shall pass laws idiich will disenfranchise
people for certain purposes.

And among those purposes named

are perjury, bribery, malfeasance in office, embezzlement of
public funds? and then they use language which I don't
understand any more:

infamous crime and high crime.

If this Court rules in our favor, in California
we will be back in the position, it's true, that we were at

16

the time of the Otsuka case, right after it or right before
~~ well, right after it.

We'll be in a confusion.

But —
QUESTION:

Well, isn't that a confusion that the

State of Californici can resolve for itself?
MR. ROTH:

That’s exactly our position, Your Honor.

We believe that the State Legislature can resolve that
position by defining these crimes now, that the —
QUESTION:

What about the State Supreme Court?

MR. ROTH; Well, the State Supreme Court has said
that the words "infamous crime" and "high crime" are
practically undefinable for all purposes, as I see it, in
Otsuka.
Then they went on to say that our Constitution was
unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION: Well, under your State Constitution, if
the Legislature were to define "infamous crime", would that
create a problem for your California courts?
MR. ROTH;
QUESTION:
MR. ROTH:

Well, —
Whether that definition really —it might, Your Honor.

Our court is

a very activist court, I like to think they always are about
two weeks ahead of this Court.

They create problems.

Definition-wise, I think if the definitions were
specific, why, if this Court upholds the constitutionality

17
of the principle, I don't know what our court would do.
hope

I

they would rule that if the vote is changed, the

Constitution, or if the Legislature acted tinder the
Constitution, I hope they'd rule that they were correct.
QUESTION: Was there any doubt about the power and
authority of the Supreme Court of California to define in its
own way what "infamous crime" means?
MR. ROTII:

No, but they haven't done it, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

But is there any doubt about their power,

And —-

that's all.
MR. ROTH:
do it, Your Honor.

the

Oh, no.

I believe they have the power to

I think that's clear.

QUESTION:

Now, —

MRl ROTH:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

— Mr. Roth, on looking at Exhibit 1 of

what is it —- to the Petition for Writ of Mandate,

which appears on page 28 of the Appendix, which is a report
of the Secretary of State of California regarding the right
to vote of ex™felons in California, dated May 30, 1972,
which indicates, as you know better tin an I, that there has
been an extraordinarily uneven application ~~
MR. ROTH:

No question —

QUESTION;

~~ in fact, in the various counties of

the State.

For example, the crime of murder disqualifies a.

18

person from voting in at least four counties, but does not
disqualify in at least six counties.

Sale of drugs dis­

qualifies an applicant in at least five counties, but not
in at least nine counties.

And so on.

You're familiar,

I knov7, with that report.
MR. ROTH:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: That is part of tine record in this case.
MR. ROTII:

Yes.

QUESTION:

So even if you’re wholly correct in

your understanding of the second part of the Fourteenth
Amendment, and that a State could constitutionally bar all
convicted felons from registering and voting, does that
really answer the equal protection problem inherent in the
Secretary of State's report?
MR. ROTH:

Ho, it doesn't.

QUESTION:

That California in fact has no -- that

it allows — this petitioner or this respondent was convicted
of what?

Burglary, was it?
MR. ROTH:

Well, there's three; one is burglary,

one is forgery, and one man was convicted of possession of
heroin.
QUESTION: Right.

And all three of those respondents

would have been allowed to vote in some of the counties in
California.
MR. ROTII:

Correct.

19

QUESTION:
your county.

And they have not been allowed to vote in

Now, regardless of the power of California to

bar every convicted felon from voting, if even-handedly
applied, doesn't this basic equal protection problem still
exist, even if you’re quite right in your interpretation of
the second part of the Fourteenth Amendment?
MR. ROTII;

Well, I believe, Your lienor, that we’ve

spoken to that in the final part of our amicus brief, and
that is the idea that although the application itself, as it
exists at the present time, may be wrong, or it was wrong —
QUESTION:
MR. ROTH?

Well, it may be unconstitutional.
It may be unconstitutional.

I think

there's a difference between the application and what the
California Supreme Court or the California Legislature may
do to make it constitutional.

And I think that

QUESTION: But they haven't done it so far.
MR. ROTH:
QUESTION:

No, they have not.
And I mean, you don’t quarrel with the

facts, with the accuracy of the Secretary of State's report,
do you?
MR, ROTII;

No.

Absolutely not.

That's why I said this was a tough case, as I
started.
QUESTION:

Precisely.

MR. ROTH:

But I think that the accuracy is there,

20

1 think most of the historical facts, there's no problem
with, but it's a problem, as 3: see it, of letting our
Legislature have a chance to do something, or let our
State Supreme Court do something.
QUESTION; Well, they had their opportunity here,
didn't they?
MR. ROTH;

They did, but they didn't take it.

QUESTION; And it is trxie, is it not, that these
respondents, all of them, would have been allowed to vote
in some counties in California.
MR. ROTII;

I agree heartily, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION;

Well, if there were affirmance here on

that narrow ground, would that preclude your Legislature,
then, stepping in and trying to work out some uniform
definition?
MR. ROTH:
definition.

Not if idle ground was that there was no

Ho, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

But that would still leave unresolved

your basic power.
QUESTION: Right.
QUESTION:
it.

Unless we said you had it.
MR. ROTII:

it.

Unless it was just assumed that you had

Well, that's right, if you say we have

I believe we have it.

QUESTION:

If we said nothing, you'd still be

going by the Supreme Court of California's decision.
MR. ROTH:

That’s right, yes.

QUESTION:

In Otsuka.

MR* ROTH:

That's correct.

.MAafeArd» ManUMI

Unless we araended our

Constitution, that's correct.
QUESTION;

But you can't get around the Supreme

Court of California's decision by amending the California
Constitution, I would think, because they said it was a
federal constitutional violation.
MR. ROTH':

If they said it was, and then we amend

it, and the case comes up again, we Plight possibly get'a
decision a different way, Your Honor.
I'm hopeful, I don't
QUESTION:

You'd rather have it now, though, I

think.
MR. ROTH:
QUESTION:

I'd. rather have it now, Your Honor.
What do you want other than the advisor

opinion from this Court?
MR. ROTH:

What do you want other than that?

Not very much, Your Honor.

And I know

the Court doasn't —
QUESTION:

I mean, you’re just, unhappy with what

your Supreme Court did to you.
MR. ROTH:
QUESTION:

That's true.
And dees that make that our problem?

22

MR. ROTH;

Well, only to the extent that nationally

this Court should rule on whether or not Section 2 of the
Fourteenth Amendment is separate and apart from Section 1,
or is controlled by Section 1.
QUESTION;

Well, that could come up in a clearcut

case from one of the other 49 States that haven't got it
all fouled up»
MR. ROTH:

It could, very well, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Why should we take up this fouled-up one,
where you admit that it depends on which county you're in?
MR. ROTH:

That's right.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Click.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN R. CLICK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CLICK:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court;
We represent Abran Ramirez, Larry Gill and Albert
Sang Lee, and other persons in California who have been
convicted of a crime, who have served their term in prison,
who have successfully completed their parole, and, in many
cases, many years ago successfully completed that parole.
Now that they've been reintegrated into society,
they seek their right to participate on an equal basis in
the election process in California.

23
As has been evident here, California has completely
fenced them out of the election process, but there has not
been suggested any reason why there’s any State interest for
having completely fenced them out of the process.
We were aware —
QUESTION:

Well, when you say that California has

completely fenced them out, you mean these particular three
people?
MR. GLICK:

And the persons they represent, Your

Honor.
QUESTION;
MR. GLICK:

Yes.
Persons who have not been permitted to

vote on the basis of their prior conviction, in spite of
their having served their term and been released from
parole.
Your Honors, we were aware that there ’would be an
attempt -QUESTION:

• ;
In -that respect, are you concerned

only with persons such as you have just described, you’re
not concerned, then, with the convicted felon whose term
has not yet expired?
MR. GLICK:

That's correct, Your Honor.

We were

specific —- the decision was specifically limited only to
those persons who were completely released from not only
custody but parole as well.

24

We were aware, Your Honors, that there would he a
suggestion that perhaps this disability should continue by
virtue of the fact of its long existence.

And so, although

the State, we believe, did not justify the burden that's
upon it to come forward and give reasons for the exclusion,
but we went further and introduced evidence and data to,
we think, clearly and affirmatively show that this restriction,
which was adopted in California’s frontier days, no longer
makes any sense.
As is discussed in our briefs and as has been
almost conceded here, while there might have been a purpose
for this provision in 1849, when it was put into the
California Constitution, when there v?as no registration, when
ballots were not uniform and they could be obtained from
Party Headquarters, when the ballot box itself was, as it was
in 1850, simply a box that was formerly some other sort of
container.

And in San Francisco and Los Angeles that was

the situation and in Vallejo, as is reported, the ballot box
itself was an old cracker box which had a hole in the back of
it, discovered years later, through which ballots could be
slipped.
And so the framers of the California Constitution
had good reason to be concerned about the integrity of the
election process, and 1 think that concern was reflected by
this exclusion in the Constitution.

25

But the process in California today could not be
more different.

Sixty-five percent of our counties do vote

by machine, but that's not the end of the matter.

In the

other thirty-five counties, of course there’s registration,
there are uniform ballots with special watermarks.

The

precincts are limited to a small number of voters per
precinct.

The precinct officials are residents of the

precinct.

They know the voters who are there.
And. the California Supreme Court, in reviewing this

scheme, concluded that to practice election violation,
election fraud, election problems in California today would
require the coordinated skills of a vast squadron of computer
technicians.
In other words, they found it was virtually
impossible.
And the statistics in California, as unmistakably
set out in that opinion, are that there has not been a
reported case of vote-buying or vote-selling in California
since 190 3.

The last reported violation, in Los Angeles

County, which has a third, approximately a third of
California’s voters, the last complaint of any voter problem
was in 1926.

And the head of the Bureau of Criminal

Statistics in California, who’s been in that position for
eighteen years, stated that not one single election offense
has been reported to him.

26
QUESTION;

Could that be because of this provision

being on the books?
MR. CLICK;

That's why we were quite careful, Your

Honor, to point out not only that there haven't been any —
although we would suggest there would be. some first
offenders, surely —- but that given the way the system
operates, it's virtually impossible that there would be any.
In other words, not only hasn't there been in
reality a danger, but the system is such that the danger is
simply not present of fraud occurring.

So we want to take

care of both of those, both of those parts of it.
This change in the election process was paralleled
by a change in California’s Penal Code.
In 1850, -when our Constitution was adopted, in
California, there were only eight misdemeanor offenses in
the statute dealing with election violations.
Nowc at the time this case was decided, there were
over a hundred and fifty such statutes on the books, including
76 felonies, covering such things as fraudulent registration,
voting twice, bribery, intimidation, and the like.

So that

•'die California Supreme Court, contrasting that situation with
the situation which this Court, in Dunn vs. Blumstein, found
adequate to deter against elections fraud, is a reasonable
means to deal with that problem, found that, if anything,
our situation was even more of a protection.

27
Further, as is noted in the record, at the time that
I'm standing before you this keeps changing, but at the time
I'm standing before you now 26 of the States either never
disenfranchised at all, or automatically restore the right to
vote upon the completion of sentence and either a parole or
probationary type period after the sentence.
The District of Columbia does the same, according
to an Act of Congress, which I believe was passed in 1971.
And of course some California counties, under Otsuka, did
not disqualify practically anybody — had not disqualified
anybody.
And these States, the District of Columbia, and
those counties have not reported any difficulty with their
election process, any parade of horribles or, in fact, any
problem at all in having reenfrahchise.
Your Honor, I wanted, before passing onto some of the
other parts of the case, I wanted to emphasize that there is
perhaps present here an unstated State interest, if you will,
an implication that perhaps if someone is convicted of a
crime, that this evidences anti-social behavior, or it
evidences some inference of moral unfitness, or something
of the kind, and therefore this person should not vote.
It’s mentioned, I think, almost explicitly in some
of the lower court decisions.
But we want to point out, Ho.

1, that in -this record

28

there's no evidence whatever, a scintilla of evidence, in
fact, that such an inference can properly be drawn as to any
of these persons, let alone as to all of them.
In this country, and I -think the strength of the
country is that we have never limited the franchise to
persons not as to whom an inference is required but to whom,
openly and avowedly, claim that we should have an entirely
different system of government, or no system whatsoever.
These persons aren't barred from the franchise; these
persons, in fact, are permitted to organise into political
parties and to run candidates for office, let alone vote.
And this Court, I think, in reviewing the voting
cases —* well, first, in the Bachstrom case, this Court
refused to allow an inference to be drawn from a prior
conviction such that a different process for commitment for
mental illness would be permitted.

In the Carrington and the

Cipriano and the other bond cases, in. Evans, where a claim
was made that persons lived at the National Institutes of
Health, or because persons were in the military they might
vote in a certain manner, there might be bloc voting and.
harmful voting, this Court said that:

we don't think such

inferences are proper.
Secondly, the sheer overbreadth of drawing such
broad inferences as to the entire class would not be
permitted, especially where we're talking about voting.

29

And finally, again I'd want to emphasize, Your
Honor, that we're talking about persons who have completed
their term in prison, whatever inferences might have been
drawn during the period the Stcite is rehabilitating its
dealing with them, they've completed, successfully completed
and been released from their parole.
into society.

They were reintegrated

They are active citizens.

And as to them,

continuing to draw this inference, years later — which we
don't believe would be proper even in the first instance —we think would not be justified.
In fact, to the contrary, the real State interest
that's present in this case is the interest of rehabilitation
The entire pencil system is aimed at returning
persons to a productive role in society, and yet at the time
they're returned, at the time when the State has passed this
judgment as to release from parole, they're screened out of
the most important right, or one of the most important rights
the fundamental right to vote; fundamental, because —» not
only in itself but because it leads to all other rights.
QUESTION;

Well, as I hear you, you're arguing

the wisdom of the policy now, aren't you?
MR. GLXCK;

No, Your Honor, what.

as I understand

it, when the right to vote or the right to participate in the
election process on an equal basis is denied to citizens,
the State is to come forward and demonstrate what interest

30

it has that it's furthering by screening these people out
of the voting process.
Now, they suggested perhaps integrity of the election
process in terras of fraud.

The Attorney General has just

stated that that problem doesn't exist in California, and
the California court found so.
I wanted, before passing on, to deal with this
sort of implication that perhaps there was some other State
interest, called moral unfitness, or something of that
description? and to point out that this Court has not
permitted those sorts of inferences.

And simply to dispel

that notion, and to comment that — perhaps you're right,
Your Honor — but that there is -this other State interest
that is present, it's one of rehabilitation, which the
President's Commissions, the various President's Commissions,
the ABA and the other organisations have urged.
Let me then take —- consider Section 2, because I
think what we have in this case is the virtual concession
that there's no State interest to deny the right; but, in
argument, that Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment neverthe­
less renders Section 1 inoperable.
And the words that are relied on in this case are
the words "participation in rebellion, or other crime",
which are found in Section 2.
Now, I've of course reviewed the legislative

31
history and I've read the many articles that have been
written about the legislative history of the f I believe, 39th
Congress which adopted this.
There's clearly, in reading there,, no one view as
to — or no one purpose of all of the persons who were
working on putting that amendment together.
But we would suggest that a reading of the legis­
lative history, first, would lead to the conclusion that
"participation in rebellion, or other crime" is really meant
to deal with the problem of the rebellion and not the
problem of former conviction.
QUESTION: That it’s limited to -die participation
in the War Between the States?
MR. CLICK:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And that's all?

MR. CLICK:

And that's all.

QUESTION;

And only crimes related to participation

ill the War?
MR. GLICK;

Exactly, yes.

We would conclude that for two or three reasons:
First, that if one looks at the purpose of Section
2, it was a penalty provision to deal with the increase in
representation that would occur, because of the emancipation
of the slaves, and them being counted as a full vote instead
of three-fifths of a vote as was required under Article I,

Section 2.

And so the penalty provision was needed to deal

with that situation.
But border States, as is indicated in our history,
were concerned that they had just disfranchised large
numbers of rebels, so that if the penalty provision were
simply put in the way it was originally phrased, they might
lose representation in the House of Representatives on
account of having disfranchised these persons who participated
in the rebellion.
Thus, this language relating to the rebellion cams
in, and we suggest that that was the purpose.

Looking at

Section 3, again, which deals with the right of former
office holders who participated in the rebellion, to once
again become office holders, indicates once again that the
rebellion was of the primary concern of the drafters.
The phrase "other crime" itself is quite broad.
It would clearly within its scope encompass felonies,
misdemeanors, and other crimes which no State at that time
was disqualifying persons for.
The term "infamous crime" was certainly well known
to the framers, and might have been used.
QUESTION:
initial phraseology:

Doss the history show that that was the
except for participation in rebellion,

comma, or other crime, comma?
MR. CLICK:

No, Your Honor, I think the first draft,

33
there was no reference to "other crime" at all, and that
that was added later, and there's some dispute about when
the comma exactly was added.

But I don't •— as I read the

history, it simply does not aid us very much in terms of
discussion.
QUESTION:

Did this section have a legislative

precedent?
Was there a statute which read this way?
MR. CLICK:

There's no section, that I'm aware of,

Your Honor, that read precisely in this fashion.

The State

statutes either referred to "infamous crime" or -QUESTION:
MR. CLICK:

No, I meant a federal statute.
No, Your .Honor, I'm not aware of any.

Not aware of any.
We would not rest there, of course, Your Honor.

We

believe that that is the -- in looking at the history and
what was intended, that that's the appropriate reading of
the meaning of the phrase "other crime"? but even if

even

if the phrase ivas meant to refer not just to other crimes
but to felony convictions or infamous crimes rather than
"other crimes", again one looks at the purpose of the section.
The emancipated slaves

well, it's clear from the

reading of the history that they intended to put the
Southern States to a choice;

either emancipate — either

enfranchise the persons who have been emancipated, or suffer

34
a reduction in your congressional representation by not
being allowed to count them at all.
That this was the purpose and that in devising a
formula to accomplish this penalty, -they simply placed in
the clause those restrictions, some of the restrictions that
were generally in effect at that time.
There's not any evidence in the debate that there
was any discussion whatsoever of what would or would not be
appropriate voter qualifications, why these were put in and
some others were omitted, or any discussion that would lead
to the conclusion that this was an attempt', or there was any
intent here to make decisions about -these matters.
But what I think does follow logically from tire
history is that -they wanted to accomplish the penalty, and
so they needed to state, in general, broad terms, to protect
the status quo, if you will, in the North especially, so
there'd be no change between those States, to simply state
those ■*— that statement of those qualifications, and then
accomplish the penalty purpose.
QUESTION:
MR. GLICK;

Mr. Click, -Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Does your reading of history indicate

whether, at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted,
some or most of the States had laws on this subject?

MR. CLICK:

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe that it would

be fair to say that a majority of the States, perhaps even
close to three-quarters of the States, did have on their,
.in their statutes voter qualifications that would restrict
the franchise from those who had been convicted of infamous
crimes, which was the general phraseology at the time.
Some States — sortie State, however, did not.

Of

course, there were many other voter qualifications that
existed, such as property qualifications, which I think were
even more uniform in their appearance in State Constitutions.
And again I think just from the simple listing here,
which is not an all-inclusive listing, and with no discussion
of the, of what should and should not appear here, that it
would be

one just could, not conclude that that was the

intent.
And this Court, I believe quite properly, in prior
cases has refused to read Section 2, which was intended as a
penalty, as entirely preempting Section 1, as was the argument
before this Court for some time„
QUESTION:

Did I understand you to say, to suggest

earlier, Mr, Click, that the language of Section 3, "shall
have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same,
or given aid or comfort co the enemies thereof" casts a
gloss on Section 2?
MR, CLICK;

Yes, I think it does. Your Honor.

I

36
think that it indicates what they were concerned about.
QUESTION; Well, you mean they were not concerned
about the limitation "or other crime"?
MR. CLICK:

Well, Your Honor, of course it is a

matter of interpretation, and there's no clear answer, and
I wouldn't suggest that there is.

All I'm suggesting is

til at by virtue of the broad phraseology "other crime", by
virtue of —
QUESTION:

Well, don't you think the phrase "or

other crime" is quite clear?
MR. CLICK:

I don't think so, Your Honor, because

I think that —
QUESTION: What do you think it means;, —
MR. CLICK:
QUESTION:

I think it means —
or where does the confusion lie?

MR. CLICK:

I'm sorry.

I think in this context

it means other crimes related to the rebellion.

I think

they would have chosen the terra "infamous crime" if that's
what they meant.

I don't think that that was ~~ there's

nothing to indicate that they discussed it, and I don't
think that's what they meant, although
QUESTION:

You don't think it was a recognition

that tliree-fourths of the States already barred voting for
persons convicted of "other crimes" than rebellion?
MI?. GLICK:

Your Honor, I want to be quite fair.

37
It certainly could be.

I don't think that it was, and I

don't think that's the best reading of the language; but
it's clearly open to either interpretation.
It seems to me chat the phraseology chosen, that
the history indicates the concern for the rebellion, not
any other concern, that the more consistent reading of it
with that history is that it did not intend to embrace it.
But again, if I might emphasize to the Court, I
believe that either reading which the Court would, give to
it would not lead to the conclusion which Petitioners urge,
that 'the penalty provision here, which was the clear intent
of Section 2 should be read as modifying or nullifying, as
has been argued previously and rejected in this Court, the
scope of Section 1.
QUESTION:

In other words, that's an argument that

whatever may be its breadth, it relates only to the diminution
of representation,
MR. CLICK:
QUESTION:

We believe so, Your Honor.

Yes.

And that leaving standing independently

Section 1, on the equal protection clause.
MR. CLICK;
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Correct,
unh-hunh.
I suppose your argument is helped some

by the fact that the expression chosen is “participation" in
crime rather than "conviction" of crime, which, I take it,

38

the disqualifying statutes in the States then is now spoken
in terras of conviction rather than just participation.
MR. CLICK:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Yes.

Mr. Click, this isn't your case, but it

might be a case next term if you should prevail here, what
about the convicted felon who's still in your State
penitentiary, do you think he should have a right to vote
on your general philosophy?
MR. CLICK: Well, Your Honor, we think there are
significant differences in the person who is in prison.
And I think it "would depend on how the facts in that case,
in that particular State, were set out.
But let me point out some of those differences.
Of course the person in prison is under 24“hour confinement,
and under a fairly regimented control of the State.

Mot

only of the State, but I think studies have indicated that
other inmates, there's a society of other inmates and
certain influences that might be exerted in the prison
context, which may or may not present dangers to the ballot,
box.
There's of course problems of access to information,
to cast an intelligent ballot, which is clearly a State
interest.
There might be, again taking the particular State
and the particular facts, difficulty in conducting the

39

election in prison, or dealing with the election in prison»
And of course the State has wide latitude in its effort
toward rehabilitation and the conduct of its programs behind
prison walls.
And so we would suggest there are many, many
differences in that case, which again one would need to look
at the facts in the particular State.
QUESTION:

Apparently the State, in this very case,

asked your Supreme Court to reaffirm, I gather, long-standing
cases, holding that you could disenfranchise incarcerated
felons.
MR. CLICK:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And there

was no dispute about that below at all.
QUESTION:

Did footnote 18 leave that open, or

simply decline the invitation of the State authorities?
MR. CLICK;

I think, in fairness, Your Honor, it

was pointed out over and over again at the beginning, and
the State came forward to emphasize the fact that this case
simply doesn't involve the issue.
All of these petitioners are persons who have
successfully completed their parole.

Petitioner Ramirez is —•

QUESTION: Well, I gather that's the ground on which
the Supreme Court declined to
MR. CLICK:

That's right.

That's right.

And in the case of Petitioner Ramirez, he successfully

40

corapleted his parole twenty years ago.

He had only been

incarcerated for three months, to begin with.
Finally, Your Honor, this Court has already
commented, through its questions, I believe, on the second,
what we believe to be independent ground on which this
Court could and should sustain the decision of the California
Supreme Court; and that is the fact that where one resided
was determinative of whether one voted.
QUESTION:

Well, is that really so, as this case

gets to us can we possibly avoid — as I read what your
Supreme Court said in its conclusion:

We conclude that it

applies to all ex~felons whose terms of incarceration and
parole have expired, provisions of Article II and Article XX,
Section 11 of the California Constitution, denying the right
of suffrage to persons convicted of the crime, together
with the several sections of the Elections Code, violate
the equal protection clause.
Nov;, can we possibly sustain this on the disparity
in definition of "infamous crime" among the counties in face
of that holding?
MR. CLICK:
Your Honor.

I perhaps should have been more clear,

I think that, for California's purposes, that

question needs to be reached.
What I was asserting is that even if — because
obviously we don't believe the Court, should —- even if the

41
Court should decide adversely to us on the issue of former
felons who have been released from prison, and parole voting,
then, nevertheless, the California scheme is unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

You mean at least facially, in other

MR. CLICK:

Precisely.

words, —

QUESTION:

the California Constitution provisions

do not violate equal protection.
MR. CLICK:

Precisely.

QUESTION: Even if we agree with that, we then have
to go on and reach —
QUESTION;

Well, we wouldn’t, because the California

court didn't deal with that question, and normally we don’t
review -- normally we let the State court pass on the
constitutional issue in the first instance.

We would

remand, leaving that open, I suppose.
MR. CLICK:

Your Honor, I would suggest that since

the question is a federal question, since it was fully
argued before the court below, it’s a question to be
decided solely —■
QUESTION:
MR. CLICK:

But it wasn't decided by them.
But it rises solely — they never

decided, but -~
QUESTION:
MR. CLICK;

It wasn't decided by them.
They did decide, Your Honor, respectfully,

42

under the Fourteenth Amendment that there was a violation ~~
QUESTION:

I know, but they didn't decide this

question.
MR. CLICK;

That's — they certainly did not base

their decision on
QUESTION:

And under the statute we normally only

review questions that have been, constitutional questions
that have been decided by a State court.
MR. CLICK:

I recognise, Your Honor, that this Court

clearly has wide latitude as to how it would deal with the
problem.

I would only suggest that it is a federal

question that was fully presented to the court and could be
resolved by this Court.
I believe that the Court, from my understanding, is
fully acquainted with the facts in regard to that argument,
and so I thank you very much, and respectfully pray that —
oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Perhaps we should carry this on in

private, but we
[Laughter. 3
--review judgments here, not opinions.

And the

judgment of the California Supreme Court was that this
statute is invalid under the equal protection clause.

And

we could affirm that on the basis that it's invalid under
the equsil protection clause because of its wholly uneven and

43
rather capricious enforcement in the differing counties of
the State,

of California, without either agreeing or dis­

agreeing ttfith the opinion of the Supreme Court of California.
And I'm sure you're going to say. Yes, of course
we could do that, because we could do whatever five votes
might find.
[Laughter.3
MR. CLICK: Your Honor, I would only point out that
[sic]
the three named Petitioners in this ease were, are now
registered, they have voted, they obviously had the concern
to vote, they would be, I need not point out, certainly
disappointed if it came back to the California Supreme
Court for another reading; and we feel that there was a
denial of equal protection here to them under the California
scheme, that there was a denial in that the State — there's
simply no State interest that's been advanced, to suggest
that this disqualification in California today makes any
sense.
And so we would urge the affirmance of that decision.
Thank you. Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

Let's see, you have a few minutes left, Mr. James,
yes.

44

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DUNCAN M. JAMES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER.
MR. JAMES:

One of the questions that was asked a

few minutes ago was whether or not there was a statute, a
federal statute that went along with -the Fourteenth
Amendment.
What I*cl like to bring to the attention of the
Court is 2 U.S. Code, Section 6, which is a restatement of
the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 2, which provides for the
disenfranchise -- well, it says you can abridge — you.
cannot abridge except for a crime or rebellion.
And I don't have the legislative history to say
when tliat section was passed.

I would assume that at the

time the u.S, Code section was passed that they were not
under the pressures that Mr, Click refers to.
I1d also like to comment to the Court that in
reviewing the history of the Constitution, it was interesting
to read some of the comments that occurred during the
arguments or hearings on the Fifteenth Amendment,
During the course of the hearings on the Fifteenth
Amendment, 'trie re we re quite a number of proposed amendments,
which included exactly the same language that we're talking
about here, except for "crime or other rebellion".

And I

would submit that, as I believe it was, Hillard Warner, a
Representative from the State of Alabama, indicated that it

would seem that the States should have the right under that
small limited classification to except from those persons
the right to vote.
We submit that the equal protection clause does not
apply, because this constitutes an exception to the equal
-•cji

protection clause.

y

Section 2 clearly says "except for

rebellion, or other crime5' when they're talking about the
reduction in representation.
Now, the equal protection clause seems to act as a
protection to avoid what the last part of Section 2 says,
that, if you deny the right to vote, then we're going to
reduce your representation.
And what the equal protection clause is saying,
at least I believe it says, is:

no, we don’t want to do

that, the State is entitled to a full representation? so if
you disenfranchise a male inhabitant, thirty years old, x^e're
going to say that because of the equal protection clause and
because of the Twenty-sixth Amendment, this is a denial of
equal protection.
So I submit that, although in California, maybe as
applied there, it's an unequal application,

it is not a

denial of the State's right to disenfranchise.
We've heard about all these people who go through
the

or who don't want to vote, or who are afraid to go

register to vote because of the Otsuka decision, but yet, as

45
Respondents indicate, something in the neighborhood of
34,000-plus persons we re released from State prison from
1968 to 197.1, there is a procedure, under the California
Penal Code, to get a certificate of rehabilitation, which
gets back for you, when you go through the administrative
judicial process and up to the Governor, to get the right to
vote back, except for a person convicted twice in
separate violations
QUESTION:

Is that free?

MR* JAMES: Excuse me?
QUESTION:
MR. JAMES:

Is that free?
Yes, it is.

And in fact it provides

for appointment of counsel ~~
QUESTION:

Can a lay mail do it?

MR. JAMES:

What?

QUESTION:
MR. JAMES:

Can a layman do it?
I would say that if you cannot afford

counsel, one of the sections in 4852.-something, which is
cited in our brief, provides for appointment of a Public
Defender to give it to you, to go through the court
proceedings.
QUESTION:

You mean with all the work the Public

Defender has, he goes through this, too?
MR. JAMES; Well, he hasn't — he's only done it
once in my county in five years? there's only bean one

application for a certificate of rehabilitation.
QUESTION; Which means what?
MR. JAMES:
QUESTION:
MR. JAMES:

Which is —
Is that good or bad?
Well. I think it's very poor.

Because the procedure is there, yet nobody wants to
go through it.
Respondents here never went through it.

There’s no

indication they applied and were rejected by the Governor.
In the same period of time, '68 through '71, only 450 filed
for a certificate of rehabilitation.

They're told on

release from prison that they are entitled to go through that
procedure.
And out of those 450, -—
QUESTION:

So, because they don't go through it,

they can' t vote.
MR. JAMES:
QUESTION:

That's right.
So you've got an additional one now.

QUESTION: Well, your point is, they might well
have prevailed -MR. JAMES:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
~~ in their applications for certificates

of rehabilitation, and that that would be a good argument
if —
QUESTION: Well, do they know —

48

QUESTIONS

— if the Supreme Court of California

had required then to exhaust that remedy before coming to
idie court; but the Supreme Court of California didn't, and
that's a matter of State lav/, that's nothing for us to be
concerned with, is it?
MR. JAMESs

That's correct.

It was just the

— the procedure is there and available for those who are
disenfranchised to go through the certificate of rehabilita­
tion.

And almost 63 percent of those that did apply were

granted.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:24 o'clock, a.m. , the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
