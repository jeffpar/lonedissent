P ROGE E DINGS
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Me will hear arguments

next in No, 72-1231, National Labor Relations Board v. Savair
Manufacturing Company.
Mr. Come, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COME:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the Sixth Circuit,
and the basic question is whether it is permissible for the
National Labor Relations Board, in the exercise of its broad
discretion to establish the standards and safeguards for con­
ducting a fair and free representation election, to conclude
that a union's offer to waive initiation fees for all employees
who sign union

authorization cards before the election should

the union win the election, does not tend to interfere with
employee free choice in the election.
The facts are these:

In September of 1970, pursuant

to a representation petition filed by the Mechanics Educational
Society of America, the Board conducted a secret ballot elec­
tion among the production and maintenance employees of the
Savair Manufacturing Company.
vote of 220-to-20„

The union won the election by a

The company filed objections to the elec­

tion, alleging, among other things, that union representatives

4
had improperly coerced certain employees by leading them to
believe that if they failed or refused to sign a card request­
ing an election, and the union were successful, they would foe
fined from $20 to $200 before they could join the union.
These objections were investigated and set down for
hearing before a hearing officer of the Board who found that
prior to the filing of the representation petition, Bennie
McKnight, an employee supporter of the union, solicited
employees to sign cards applying for membership in the union,
which cards were to be used to support the petition.

As this

Court no doubt knows, generally the Board would declare as a
support of 30 percent in cards before they would process a
representation petition.
McKnight told employees that if they did not sign
the card now, they would be subject to an assessment or a fine
if the union won the election.

When the employees questioned

McKnight about the union's policy, he told them to call Alfred
;f >

vj-

r.

»' ... j

Smith, the union Secretary-Treasurer, whose phone number he
gave them.
After the election petition was filed, but before
the election was held, Smith addressed a group of about twenty
employees.

In response to a question about the assessment, he

explained that it was the union's policy to waive initiation
fees in organizing new shops, but to require a small fee be
paid by persons joining the union after a contract had been

negotiated.

In fact, the union’s constitution and by-laws

provide for the local union to set the initiation fees which
in no event, can it exceed $10.
Smith added that there was no assessment or phone in
our organization in regards to this situation of membership.
The only time a fine was imposed was for violation of the
union’s constitution or by-laws.
The hearing officer concluded that what the union did
through Smith and McKnight was to inform employees that the
initiation fee would be waived in the eventuality of a success­
ful election by the union.

He further found that whatever con­

fusion may have existed with respect to the terminology util­
ised by McKnight, the union's policy was clarified at this
initial organizational meeting at which Smith explained the
union’s policy, and he held a subsequent meeting shortly before
■the election going over the same ground.
Q

How many were there?

MR. COME:

At the first meeting, there were about

twenty employees, and he indicated that about the same number
were at the second meeting.

The first meeting was attended by

the card signers, as he explained that those were the only
names and addresses that he had and. that is what the notice
went out to.

But there is no indication as to who in addition

may have been present at the second meeting.
Following the Board's decision in DIT-MCO, the

6

waiver of

initiation fees prior to an election is not an im­

proper inducement to vote for the union, regardless of whether
it was contingent upon the results of the election, the hear­
ing officer concluded that the union’s waiver offer did not
impair free choice in the election and recommended that the
union be certified.
I should point out that DIT-MCO represents a rever­
sal of the Board's earlier position in Lcbue, in which the
Board had concluded that if the waiver was tied to the outcome
of the election it was improper.
Q

Is there a copy of the cards in the record?

HR. COME:
record.

There is not a copy of the cards in ?;he

What you do have in the record is a — is testimony

by the union agent —■

Well, isn't it even among the —* isn't It here

in any form, the cards?
HR. COME5
Q

No, it is not.

Well, was it an application for membership as

well as —
MR. COME:

Yes, it was.

It was an application for

membership, and it authorises the union to represent the
employee in collective bargaining.
Q
membership

And did it say that if the union won the
fees would be waived?

MR. COME:

No, the card did not say that.

It was a

typical authorization card which, as I say, was an application
for membership and authorized —
Q

Weil, did it say that if the union lost, the

application was void?
MR,, COME;
Q

No, it did not say that.

So I suppose the application still stands if the

union lost»
MR. COME;

Except that the union agent, Mr. Smith,

testified that it was the practice of the union not to collect
any imitation fees.
o

Practice?

MR. COME;

Yes, sir, unless they won the election

and they got a contract, which is not atypical, as I understand
the practice of the union organisation.

ship? :
MR. COME;
Q

He was applying for membership.

His dues would only be waived if the union won?

MR. COME;

His initiation fae would be waived if

the union won,
o

I mean initiation fee would be waived.

MR. COME;

However, the union is not in a position

under the Act, as I hope to -— as I was planning to get to,
to compel an employee to pay initiation fees until (a) it wins
the election,

(b) it manages to negotiation a contract with an

8
employer, and (c) gets a contract which has a union security
clause in it which requires the payment of dues and fees as a
condition of continued employment.
Q

Well, can't the union sue, at .least as a theo­

retical matter, for back dues in court without enforcing it
through a union security clause?
MR. COME:

I know of no such situations where they

have done so merely on the basis of an authorization card of
the kind we had here.
Q

Mr, Conte, if the issue here were a little dif­

ferent, if the issue were that of a card majority, would the
Board's position be any different?
MR. COME:

The Board's position, as I understand it,

would not be any different.

I do think, however, that the

fact that you do have an election here makes this an easier
case, because in terms of the employee who does not want the
union and merely signs the card

as a hedge, he has a. double

insurance by voting "no" in the election.
Q

Is it possible — isn't it conceivable that

some of the 22 employees who voted against the 20 would decide
ho hedge by both signing a card and voting for the union so
that if the union won the election they would be relieved of
this fee obligation?

Isn't that what this case is about,

whether this is an improper inducement?
MR. COME:

That is con-ect, Your Honor.

I think that

that is the question«

I think that there is no question that

it is an inducem*.irfc to sign a union card.

The question is

whether it is the type of inducement which is likely to influ­
ence the employer’s vote in the election.

For example, there

is no question that if the union promises to get employees a
wage increase if it wins the election, that may well be an in­
ducement for the employees to vote for the union in the elec­
tion»

But that type of inducement, the Board and the courts

have held, is not the kind that would prediuce a. rational
choice.
Now, in this area of what inducement is going to fall
on which side of the line, I submit that that can often be t,
fine question, but —Q

Well, 1 gather, Mr. Come, the Board in Lobue,

at least initially thought that it fell on the coercive side
of the line, didn’t it?
MR. -GOME:

The Board felt that it fell on the coercive

side: not with respect to the waiver of the initiation fee.

The

Board, almost from the beginning, has taken the position that
an offer to waive initiation fees during an organizational
campaign was a legitimate type of inducement and did not inter­
fere with employee free choice.

It serves the legitimate

purpose
Q

Well, what was Lobus?

MR. COME:

Well, in Lobue, the thing that the Board

10
felt, it made it improper was that in addition to offering to
waive it, the card that the union furnished was a membership
card and on the bottom of it, it said the employee shall be
entitled to a book of — a paid-up initiation fee upon — if
the union wins the election.

It was the addition of “if the

union wins the election" that the Board felt tipped the
scales.
Now, on reconsideration in DIT-MCO, which was applied
here, it vras the Board's judgment that whether you explicitly
stated that the waiver would be effective if the union wins the

el ection or you didn't so state didn't make ixyxy tssXxs u.lo
difference because that fact would be understood in any event,
because the way the thing operates, as I explained before, is
that the only time that the union is in a position to force
an employes to pay an initiation fee is if it wins the election,
it gets a contract, and the contract has a union security
clause in it.
So in effect what the Board concluded in dit-mco
was that it was really relying upon an artificial factor in
making the propriety of the waiver turn upon whether or not
the union said anything or whether they ’ware candid enough to
add that the waiver is effective only if we win the election.
Now —

Q

On that thesis, why doesn’t the union waive the

initiation fee for everybody and not just, card signers?

11
MK. COME:

Well, I think that the reason that the

union —• well son© do, I might say, but gen*ally the reason
why they do not is that they want to speed up the election
campaign and get e quick election, because the longer the
campaign may be dragged out, the — not only the more expen­
sive it may be but the more likelihood for other factors
entering into the picture.

But the waiver scores the legiti­

mate function, as the Second Circuit pointed out in the Edro
case which was solely a card, case, 1 might point out, there
was no electron there, that the waiver serves the legitimate
purpose of removing what might have been an artificial barrier
to union membership, namely making employees pay before the
union has not only done anything for them but befor* if is
even, certain that they are going to ba their bargaining repre­
sentative o
Nov;-, X might say that the DIT-MCG decision of the
Board was approved by the Eighth Circuit, and it. was also
approved by the Ninth Circuit in the Turner case, in which it
was also applied.
The Sixth Circuit here disapproved of the DIT-MCO
decision largely, as we read their decision, because they felt
that they had been locked in by their earlier decision in
Gilmore —
Q
Como?

Well, they went beyond that, didn't they, Mr.

The facts of this case indicate that Lohue and Gilmore

Gilmore enforced Lobue„ by sound decisions,
MR. COME:

I agree that they did go beyond that, and

I am not resting solely upon, that, but —
Q

1' have difficulty — I read your brief, and I

can’t read Gilmore, the decision here as saying they were
locked in by Gilmore.

I think they said frankly and candidly

they thought Gilmore and Lobue were rightly decided and DIT-MCO
wasn"s.
MR. COME:

Well, I think that they unquestionably

cams out with that holding.

However, in distinguishing DIT-MCO

and — that is, the Eighth and Ninth Circuits'1 opinions, they
pointed out that in neither of those cases was the court
called upon to overrule a controlling precedent of its own,
and then earlier they had sort of thought that we were urging
that merely because the Board had overruled Lobue that that
ultimately —
Q

What year was Lobue?

MR. COME:
Q

And DIT-MCO?

MR. COME:
Q

Changed membership?

I believe so, Your Honor.

At least twice.

MR. COME:
Q

DIT-MCO was in 1967.

Thirteen years later.

MR. COME:
Q

Lobue was in 1954.

Now —

Do you really suggest that the hooker and the

offer, that, if the union wins membership will be waived, is
just meaningless?
MR. COME:
q

That is correct, You;: Honor.

Although the union must think it is an effective

device or it wouldn't do it?
MR. COME:
Q

Well, I think that they --

They wouldn't, just do this for nothing.

They

think it is effective enough to draw the attention and get
favorable action out of some of the employees.
MR. COME;

Well, I think that they believed that to

waive an initiation fee is effective, for the reason — for the
legitimate reason that I have indicated,
Q

Get the 30 percent?

MR. COME;
Q

Get the 30 percent into -~

So, in short, some people'would vote for the

union who otherwise might not vote for the union, that is why
they do it?
MR. COME:
also

-5

Well, there is some of that, but there is

factor, a large factor of those that may be favorable

to the union but are. hesitant about signing because they dor-91
want to incur -~
Q

I would include those within what I have said.

I mean some people —
MR. COME:

However, granted that you have these

complex factors, I submit that the Board would seise an awful

14
lot of these election cases, is not unreasonable in concluding
that —
Q

What do you suggest is the standard of judicial

review of that judgment of the Board?
MR. COME:

Whether the Board was arbitrary and

capricious.
Q

That is the only standard?

MR. COM3:

Yes, Your Honor, because I chink that

this is within the area of the Board's discretion: to establish
the safeguards in standards for conducting a fair representa­
tional election.
Getting back to the point that. I was making, the
likelihood that — at least this is the Board’s judgment, which
I submit is a reasonable one — that someone who was opposed
to the union would sign a card because of the inducement that
initiation fees would bs waived, and then vote yes for the
union merely to protect that contingent benefit is remote
enough for the Board to have discounted for the simple reason
that the voter who must be assumed to have some element
reason and be aware of the real world cannot help but recog­
nise that a yes vote would not only — it might save him the
disability of having to pay the initiation fee, but it would
insure that he would get a bargaining representative that he
doesn't want, and, secondly, that the initiation fnirs are only
the beginning, because much more significant is the requirement

oi havi. tg to nay periodic dues and whatever other assessment
the union might impose•
Sc for those reasons, I submit that the Board could
reasonably conclude! that there was no improper inducement here.
Now, my brother is*, going to seek to defend the court's decision
on the further ground here that the regional director die. not
conduct an adequate investigation of the election objectives.
Q

Mr. Coma, before you get to that, was the

Board’s switch from Lobue to its present rule accompanied by
any rulemaking- .notice, or was it simply done by adjudicat lor ?
MR. COMEr
0

It was done fop- adjudication., Your Honor,

Has the Board ever had a esse of the employee

who voted against the. union and who was than charged initiat ion
fees later who made a claim that tills couldn't be done, that
this was discriminatory by the union?
MR. COME;
Q

Not to my knowledge.

Would it be reasonable to say that if an em­

ployee wanted to play it both, wavs he would sign the card so
as to hedge in that direction and then vote against the union?
MR. COME:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Then if you concede that, then hasn't the

proffer of the waiver of the initiation fee influenced the
outcome in his case?
MR. COME:
has influenced .

I don't know that you could say that it

I mean it might be •—

16
Q

Influence, I am using a neutral term.

It has

had an impact on the results, if you have this unusual fellow,
if it would be unusual to play it this way.
O

And if there are a number c£ them and we had

the majority of cards, we wouldn't have an election, would we?
MR. COME;

What's that, Your Honor?

If you had

enough of them you wouldn't have an election?
Q

This influence, of which the Chief Justice

speaks, were sufficient so that the organizer endtid up with a
card majority, we might not even have any election.
MR. COME:

Well, if you are referring to the Gissel

decision, where the Board would give a bargaining order based
upon cards, is that the —
Q

Isn't this a possibility, is all I am saying?

MR. COME:

Well, the Board does not ordinarily give

a bargaining order based upon cards absent employer unfair
labor practices.
Q

As Gissel said, Gissel indicates that if the

employer wants it, he can have it if he hasn't been guilty of
an unfair labor practice?
MR. COME:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

Mr. Come, I don't want to go into any great

detail at this late point in the argument, but what substan­
tial evidence do you find in this record to contradict the
testimony of the two witnesses who said they were coerced and

17
that this charge was characterised as a fine or a penalty?
McKnight, the fellow who was alleged to have done the coercing,
was not put on the witness stand, and the Hearing Officer, at
the end of the evidence reproduced in the Appendix, stated, as
I read his testimony on page 79 and SO, that — he asked why
they didn't put McKnight on, and he said, "I am not going to
take the testimony of Mr. Smith," which is clearly hearsay,
Smith wasn't present.
MR. COME:

First of all, Your Honor, I believe that

the testimony of individuals as to whether or not they were
coerced or not given after the event, both the Board and the
courts have recognized is highly subjective and of very little
probative value.

The test is whether or not the circumstances

are such that you can objectively conclude whether it is
reasonable to believe that there was coercion or not.

And I

submit that the circumstances here weren't that inference.
Now, with respect to the statement of the testimony
of Bridgeman and Rice, who are the two that the company relies
on hare, the Hearing Officer found that Bridgeman's testimony
was of no probative value at all because of his propensity to
confuse a fine, an assessment, and an initiation fee, and
therefore, based upon his testimony as a whole, he found no
basis for believing that there was or had been a threat of a
fine either before or after the election petition.
With respect to Rice, the Hearing Officer found —

18

credited his statement that McKnight had mentioned the word
"fine" prior to the filing of the petition.

But then he went

on to find that Smith’s explanations at the organisational
meetings which were held shortly thereafter completely clari­
fied the union’s position.
I just wanted to say that, with regard to the failure
to conduct an adequate investigation, the Court of Appeals
examined that contention and found no merit to it.
Since my time is up, I would have to refer the
Court to our further position on that.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Come.

Mr. Solner?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. SOLNER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR,. SOLNER:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

My name is Robert Solner, and I am the attorney

representing Savair Manufacturing Company, a small manufacfurcompany located in Warren, Michigan.
There are two issues in this particular case and,
of course, the first issue, which counsel has gone through in
detail and facts, and I don’t want to be redundant going over
those facts, the main issue of this case — and naturally that
is why we are here, because cf this conflict among the
circuits.

19

This issue, as 1 see this issue, involves several
cases that involve a little different set of facts in each one.
We talk about an authorization card in one.
said the card was immaterial.

In Gilmore, they

Others, they talked about what

was said by a union representative as to the outcome of the
election and the effect it had.
In our particular case here, under these set of
facts, there was an authorization card.

It is very clear from

the record, at the time that the Hearing Officer had testimony
— it is on one page there, that this was an authorization
card and it actually was an application to join the union.
Q

When was it put in evidence, Mr. Seiner?

MR. SOLNER:

At the time when we were here before

the Hearing Officer — the Hearing Officer, as I recall, off
the record, asked if someone had one, and no one had one with
them.

However, the representative of the union, Mr. Smith,

said that it was a standard authorization card.

I had never

seen one.
I don't know what a standard authorization card
is.

MR. SOLNER:

I hadn’t seen one, so I didn’t know

myself, but they explained what it said, and it said some­
thing to the effect that "I authorize the M.E.S.A. to act as
my representative to bargain with" ■— and there was a blank
space and they fill in the company name, and that "I do hereby

20

make application to join the union.”
And in the testimony of Fir. Smith, he made it very
clear, because I cross-examined him on this, whether this man
could, join the union before the election, because they were
getting these cards signed, up — and we are not talking about
pre-petition, before the petition was filed for the election,
these were cards that were signed after the petition and an
election had been scheduled, that they were getting cards
signed.
I asked him if he had a card signed if he could join,
this man could join the union.

He made it very clear that

that was merely an application and until such time as they had
a contract they could not belong to the union.
Q

And once —

He could not?

MR. SOLNER:

He could not belong to the union,,

He

said the only ones he allowed to belong to the union were
with a withdrawal card from a shop where they had had a con­
tract or the representatives of the union who were members,
who were, dues paying but they were actually business agents
and that sort.

But the card itself was merely an application

to join the union, and it was this authorization card —
Q

When would a union ever act on that application?

MR. SOLNER:

Well, I assume as soon as they would

negotiate a contract, then at that point they would then say
all of these people who signed cards don’t pay any initiation

21
fee, they become members, and of course it was a closed shop,
they would say that you have the check-off system in the shop
for the other employees to withhold their initiation fee and
their dues, and those that had signed the card would get a
waiver.
Of course, I am. not in disagreement with the right
of the Board, of course, to have a blanket waiver of initiation
fees.

They don't themselves interfere with the choice.

In

other words, if the union wants to waive for all, and it is
equal to all and all participate the same way, I agree with the
Board's position in that regard.
However, in this particular case, this was where they
obtained the card on an economic inducement

and based it on

the outcome of the election for those people that signed the
card, and I say that is a moral cc?mmitment that that person is
asked to make based on an economic inducement.
In other words, he has him sign the application, the
union representative, and say, now7, okay, you have made a com­
mitment to have this union represent us.

The signing of his

card is definitely, 1 think, material to the union's position
of wanting this commitment because it leaves that employee
absolutely no alternative, he cannot afford not to sign the
card, because if he doesn’t sign the card and the union is
elected, then he is penalized.

Secondly, if he doesn't show

an interest for the union when he is asked to sign a card,

22

then he may feel the wrath of the union later when they get
in and say this man didn't have the interest that he should
have had,, and there is a great deal of pressure put on these
fellows between the time that the election was scheduled and
that final date when that election was held to sign those,
cards because several of them signed it right the last day,
just as a hedge.
Q

Do you agree with Mr. Come, that in the standard

of judicial review of the Board’s determination that this
falls outside the line of coercion?
MR. SOLNER:
Q

No, I do not agree with that.

What is your view of the standard of judicial

review?
MR. SOLNER:

Well, I think that the lab

conditions have to be equal for both parties, in other words
they have to be equal for the employer or the union.

It ought

to be clear that free choice —
Q

That must be an argument then that coercion

nevertheless always exists unless everyone, all the amply ees
have the same —
MR. SOLNER:
Q

That is correct.

That is my---

As a matter of law, then, I guess.

MR. SOLNER:

That is what my position would be. that

it would have to be a matter of law.

It should be free.

All

the parties should be equal in that treatment., and that that —

23
it is no different than the — I cannot picture an employer
being able to be put in the position of saying we want a show­
ing of strength so we will ask a man to come off the line,
come in and sign a petition to say that we don’t want, the union.
i

Q

Well, would you say —

MR. SOLNER:

That employee wouldn't have anything to

say about it.
Q

Would you say that any other construction of the

Act is wholly foreclosed by this language and legislative
history?

Do you think there is no room for having a different

view of what coercion is under the statute?
MR. SOLNER:

Oh, no.

Certainly, they — the Board

has the right --- and I am not disagreeing with the law in that
regard —
Q

Let's assume there is room for two views, two

constructions of the Act under its language and its legislative
history.

Let’s assume there are two views.

And now the Board

having held one view for thirteen years decides it wants to
hold the other view, the other reasonable view.

Now, what are

we supposed to do about that, say that it is unreasonable?
But we have just by definition said it
MR. SOLNER:

might be reasonable.

Well, the Board is charged with the duty

to conduct an election under conditions which give employees
complete freedom of choice, and if the Beard in setting those
standards does that, then I assume that the Court can’t

interfere .

What I am saying under these facts, however- is

that they do give him —
0

Well, don't we have to say that there is no

other view, no other tenable view of the Act, construction of
the Act before we can disagree xodth the Board here?

Is that

the standard or not?
MR. SOLNER:

I think so, yes.

You have to interpret

the Act to say that this 7vct gives a certain obligation on
that Board, and if that Board doesn’t follow the Act and isn’t,
following the Act, than it is a matter of law that they are
not following the Act.
Q

Well, if a reviewing court, the judges of a

reviewing court reach the conclusion that it was contrary to
ordinary human experience to say that this conduct on the
part of the union did not influence the result, then it would
be, it would follow it v?as an arbitrary action and could be
reversed.
MR. SOLNER:
Q

That is correct.

The fact that they once had one view and now

took another doesn't make both views permissible, does it?
MR. SOLNER:

Under the facts and circumstances of

the cases in which they reversed themselves, I am inclined to
think it could.

It could, because they do say in effect that

one is a. card and doesn't affect the card, and one says it
does.

I think you have to take a general principle and tie

25
the two together to the case to understand which way they are
going.

I think that Lobue and DIT-MCO completely reversed

each other.

I don't.

I mean 3: think if you study the facts

of each case, they are different enough that I think the Board
indictive, they said in effect, reversing it themselves, hut I
don't think they vrere really doing it for that reason.

I

think it was based on the facts of the two separate cases.
But I think you are in a position, this Court is in a position
where they have to determine if they are going to set a full
principle of what can be done and what cannot be done by the
union in regard to an election.

They have to set down whether

the Board is acting arbitrarily or not, and they have to make
that decision.

And I see that there is a certain commitment

that means something with having that signed card, that the
NLRB wants to ignore that and say, well, a man can sign a card
and yet he can vote against the union and the signing of that
card means nothing.

I think the fact that he is coerced into

signing that card is some kind of a moral principle that he
may not want to abide by but he has to to protect himself and.
it may be against his own grain or against his integrity, and
I say that is not giving him a free choice and the full freedom
and right of having an election.
Secondly, there is a good question as to whether or
not the obtaining of this card isn't a violation of the
National Labor Relations Act as an unfair labor practice in

itself.

Under section 158 of the National Labor Relations

Act, it provides there the expressive views, arguments or
opinions or

the dissemination thereof, whether in written,

printed, or graphic or visual form, shall not constitute or
be evidence of unfair labor practice under any of the provisions
of this subchapter if such expression contains no threat of re­
prisal or force or promise of a benefit.
Well, he is asked to sign something here and he cer­
tainly is under either the threat of a reprisal in my set of
facts because he was told or threatened with a fine, or he was
given some kind of a benefit.

And if it is an unfair labor

practice, then it certainly doesn't give the man the freedom
of choice, and X think for that reason that there is another
reason that this is an arbitrary decision on the Boax'd in
coming to fee conclusion that they did.
Now, there is a second, issue in my case that is a
secondary issue, however, it is ana that I am very concerned
with because X was involved in it, and I think the Regional
Director has a certain obligation to investigate and make sure
that this election is held and that this election is held under
the conditions that there is freedom of choice.
We filed objections to the election, four objections,
and at the hearing there were — there was no evidence adduced
as to objection number three, as to certain promises that were
given to the employees.

There was a letter received by the

27

District Director of the NLRB from an employee in which he
said that — he alleged certain conduct that had been set forth,
was not necessarily grounds for setting the election aside, such
as the buying of drinks, or the union's promises of what it
would accomplish if it were to be- selected as the bargaining
agent.
They replied to that letter and said, in effect, that
Mr. Reibling was not a party to the proceedings and that his
objections were not timely filed, and that what was in there
appeared to be extraneous to the objections filed to the com­
pany.
Well, I think there are two things that they violated
there.

One, I don't think they can hide behind that technical

requirement that a party be the company or the union to file
objections.

I think that once they have had a letter like that

that alludes directly to the objections, that they should bring
that person in or at least allow him or tell him or notify him
that he can appear at that hearing.
X think there is a second obligation on their part
to notify the company or the union of this objection, and that
that they — of this employee, so that they can investigate it
at that point to determine whether in fact there was some cons

duct that went on that should be investigated to make sure
there was a fair and an impartial election.
And since there was no investigation, they did not

2ft

allow this man to appear in effect by not telling him that he
had the chance to appear, that they cannot, certify this union
as the bargaining agent.
1 thank you very much.
