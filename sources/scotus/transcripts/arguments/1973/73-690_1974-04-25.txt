recorded argument and the briefs.
Ho. 73-690, Air Pollution Variance Board versus
Western Alfalfa Corporation,
Mr. Tucker.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM TUCKER, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TUCKER:

Mr. Justice Douglas, and may it please

the Court:
I ana William Tucker, Assistant Attorney General of
the State of Colorado, representing the petitioners in this
case.
This case arises out of a situation involving a
violation of the Air Pollution Control lav? in the State of
Colorado.
The Western Alfalfa plant had been under investiga­
tion and surveillance by the State authorities for approximately
two years prior to June 4, 1369, at which time an investigator
for the State made a trip into the area where the plants are
located, and made emissions and opacity readings.
The opacity readings exceeded the limits which were
allowed by the State at that time, which were 40 percent

4
opacity, or a Ho. 2 Ringlenann by approximately 40 and 45
percent.
The Ringlemann and opacity readings which were taken
by the inspector were double in some instances what were
allowed by the State.
The inspector made these opacity readings by driving
up to the plant from a county or public road, driving onto the
parking lot of the particular plant, taking the opacity
readings, recording them, and taking photographs.

He got into

his car and returned — or went on his route of investigation.
QUESTION;

Where was he when he took the opacity

MR. TUCKER:

He was in the parking lot of the

readings?

Western Alfalfa plant.
QUESTION:
MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION:

He was in the parking lot?
Yes, he was.
And that parking lot was for employees
i

and authorized visitors to the plant, was it?
MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.
But he did not leave the parking lot,

did he?
MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION:

He did not enter the plant itself.
No, I know that.

plant from the parking lot?
MR. TUCKER;

No.

But did he approach the

Or —
He simply drove up to the plant

5
on the county road, and the parking lot abuts the county road,
drove off onto the parking lot, got out of the car, took the
opacity readings, recorded, them in writing, and made his
report at the time, got back in the car, drove on the county
road and went to another planto
QUESTION:

How far was the parking lot from — or

how far was the point at which he took the opacity readings
from the plant itself, from the building, from the nearest
building?
MR. TUCKER;
feet, as I recall.

Approximately four to five hundred

From the nearest building of the plant

itself.
QUESTION;
QUESTION;

Right. Right,

Thank you.

Mr. Tucker, was there any fence around

the parking lot?
MR. TUCKER;

No, there was not.

QUESTION: Were there any signs up, "No Trespassing",
or signs indicating that members of the public were not
allowed to come on?
MR. TUCKER;

No, there were not.

As the photographs

which are a part of the record on file with the Court, but are
not a part of the Appendix, indicate and show there are no
signs, there are no fences around the plant itself, and there
are no signs saying "No Trespassing".

In fact, Western Alfalfa

sells its product, which is a cattle feed product, from the

6

plants .
The inspector then filed his report with the health
department, and on June 16, 1969, a cease and desist order was
issued to Western Alfalfa,,
The cease and desist order was then appealed, so to
speak, to the Air Pollution Variance Board, and Western sought
a hearing before the Air Pollution Variance Board for a
determination of whether it was or was not in violation of
the law,
QUESTION;

And as of what date, what was the

critical date of the violation in those proceedings, Mr. Tucker?
MR. TUCKER;
QUESTION:

The June 4, 1969 date.
Was that the issue before the Commission

or the Board, whether it was in violation on that particular
day?
MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION;

That's correct.
Under Colorado law, could the respondents

here, Western Alfalfa, have introduced evidence of a similar
test on some other day close by but not the same and had it
at least considered by the Board?
MR. TUCKER;

Certainly.

The hearing before the Variance Board was held in
October and November of 1969, and the Board reached the
decision that Western’s operations were in fact in violation of
the law.

7
QUESTION;

Was there any evidence when it was

Western Alfalfa first learned of the readings being takers
on June 4th?
MR. TUCKER;

Yes, when it received the cease and

desist order, dated June 16, 1969.
QUESTION:
MR. TUCKER;

That issued without any hearing, then?
That's correct.

The law provides

that upon the receipt of a cease and desist order, the party
may request a hearing before the Variance Board for a
determination of whether its operations are in violation of
the law, and whether it desires a variance from the law.
QUESTION;

But meanwhile must — in compliance with

the cease and desist order, must the plant discontinue the
operations to which the cease and desist order are addressed?
MR. TUCKER;

No, Mr. Justice Brennan.

When the

cease and desist order is issued, the party has ten days
within which to request a hearing on it, and that order is
stayed or suspended until the Variance Board has reached a
decision.
The decision of the Variance Board was appealed to
the District Court in Weld County.

After a hearing before the

District Court and a limited amount of testimony, the District
Court affirmed or reversed the decision of the Variance Board,
and held in effect that the Western Alfalfa Corporation was
denied due process of law because the observations in question

s
were made in secret and without its knowledge.

And the

District Court’s decision was appealed to the Court of Appeals
in Colorado, and the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the
decision of the District Court, and reversed the decision of
the Variance Board, and held that the

that Western was

denied due process of law because the readings in question,
the opacity readings were taken without its knowledge and that
it had no notice of the readings; and, in addition, that
Western's rights under the Fourth Amendment were violated
because they did not consent to the inspector being on the
premises, or there was no warrant for his presence there and
the opacity readings which he subsequently took.
QUESTION:

This involves, does it, a so-called

ambient air quality standard?
MR. TUCKER:

The ambient air quality standards are

what the health department determines is the levels of pollu­
tion v/hich human beings and plant and animal life can stand
without any bad effects to them.
QUESTION:
MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION:

What size areas?
It includes the entire Stats.
Then a reading taken anywhere in the

State would be of evidentiary \'alue?
MR. TUCKER:

Yes, if the emission standards, which

were the 40 percent opacity, are exceeded anywhere in the
State, it's a violation of the law.

9

QUESTION s

Then the fact that he was nearby becomes

irrelevant.
MR. TUCKER;
QUESTION;

That's correct.
Except as it might bear upon the accuracy

of the reading.
MR. TUCKER;

Well, he was at the required distance

from the emissions that is accepted as the standard distance
to be from the emission to take an accurate reading.
QUESTION; Who determines that standard?
MR. TUCKER;

It's set out in the textbooks on

taking Ringlemann readings, the distance and where the sun
should be, and the wind, et cetera, to obtain an accurate
opacity or Ringlemann reading.
QUESTION;

Were any other tests taken anywhere in

the ambient area?
MR. TUCKER;
QUESTION;
MR. TUCKER;

Well, the —
For -this violation.
The ambient area itself had been

tested and is continually monitored by the State in various
locations around the State, and the emission standards are the
standards that the State says you cannot violate or you will
cause the ambient area of the atmosphere, in other words, to
be degraded to the extent where it will not be healthful
for the citizens and animal life in the State, and plant life.
QUESTION;

Is the Ringlemann test incorporated by

1n

-4. w

name in the statute, or recognised in the statute?
MR. TUCKER:
QUESTIOM:
MR. TUCKER:

Yes, it is, Mr. Justice Relinquish.
In the State statute, not the Federal.
In the State statute, that's correct.

This — the Attorney General’s office then petitioned
the Colorado Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, which
was denied by that Court.

We then petitioned the U. S. Supreme

Court, and this Court granted certiorari on January 21st.
It is our position that the Fourth Amendment is not
involved in this case at all.

The observations which were

made were not unreasonable, there was no invasion of privacy
of the Western Alfalfa plant.

Its personnel were not

disturbed, its operations were not curtailed, no offices were
searched, and there was no disruption of its activities.
And the Fourth —•
QUESTION:

They didn't even know he was there!

MR. TUCKER:

ell
They did not even know that the inspector was on the premises.
And the Fourth Amendment
QUESTION;

Well, that's true in much electronic

surveiIlance,
MR. TUCKER:

That’s correct.

And

in the

electronic surveillance case, where the agents put the
recording device in the telephone booth, this Court held that
•that was

fell within the purview of the Fourth Amendment.

II
But I think the difference there is tit at in the
telephone booth case this Court said that when the individual
closed the door, he expected his conversation to be private.
Western could have no reasonable expectation of privacy to
emissions which it was putting into the atmosphere for anyone
who desired to see to simply look and see.
It was a different situation from the telephone
case, because there the party did expect his conversation to
be private.

And here Western could have no reasonable

expectation of privacy.
QUESTIONS

Well, there was a trespass, wasn't

there?
MR. TUCKER:

He was on Western's property without

their consent or knowledge.
QUESTION: Well, it was an -- there was no consent to
•the entry,
MR. TUCKER:

That's what they're maintaining, that's

correct.
QUESTION;
MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION:

Well, what do you maintain?
Well, ws maintain ~~
You mean there was an open invitation

to come on their property?
MR. TUCKER:
on the promise

Well, our inspectors had been going

on the property for a period of approximately

two years, in an effort to voluntarily bring Western Alfalfa

12
operations into compliance*

And during this two-year

approximate two-year period of time —
QUESTION:

Well, that's a little different argument

than saying that this isn't -— that the Fourth Amendment doesn't
reach it, isn't it?
Are we relying on consent or not?
MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION:

On implied consent, yes, we are.
Well, it's expectation

— you don't —

if there's no expectation of privacy and the Fourth. Amendment
doesn't apply, you don't even need to worry about consent.
Now, which one are you pushing, both of them?
QUESTION:

Either or both.

MR. TUCKER:

Well, I think that, No. 1, the Fourth

Amendment does not apply because there can be no reasonable
expectation of privacy.

If it should apply, then we are

arguing that there was an implied consent for the —
QUESTION:

Well, no expectation of privacy, you

mean on that parking lot?

For example, in the case — would

you be making the same argument if they had gone into one of
the buildings and made those tests?
MR. TUCKER;

No,

There would be, I think, a

different situation if they had actually entered the building.
QUESTION:

Well, then you must — then this argument

would rest, on the fact that all they did was go to the parking
lot.

Now, is it implied consent to go on the parking lot

13
and take these tests?
MR. TUCKER!

Well, I think that they —

QUESTION: What does that derive from?
MR. TUCKER;
QUESTION;
MR. TUCKER;

Pardon?
What does that derive from?
It derived from a period of approximately

two years* activity, wherein Western had an opportunity during
that period of time, at any time, to object to the presence
of the inspectors from the State? which it did not.

And

they “■>*
QUESTION;

What did the inspectors do during those

two years?
MR. TUCKER:

They made periodic visits to all of

the plants owned by Western Alfalfa, and made opacity and
Ringlemann readings, and would go into the plant actually
and confer with the officials in regard to what equipment
had been installed, what effect it was having, and they were
making some progress toward bringing the operation into
compliance.
QUESTION; Well, in those two years were all the
tests, whatever the tests were, taken only on the parking
lot?
MR. TUCKER;

Oh, no, they were — well now, the

readings have to be taken outside of the plant premises,
because the emissions

are going up into the atmosphere from

14
the outside of the plant.

And so you could not take opacity

readings while you were inside the plant.
And the opacity — the emissions are what
violates the law.
So those readings have to be taken outside of the
physical plant premises.
QUESTIONs

Well, did you make this argument to the

Colorado courts?
MR. TUCKER:

We argued — welly actually,before

the Colorado Court of Appeals.- the Fourth Amendment was not
argued by the -QUESTION:

Well, did you argue this implied consent

MR. TUCKER:

No, because the Fourth Amendment was

matter?

actually not a question in the case at that time.

Neither

the District Court nor the Court of Appeals had — of course,
the Court of Appeals’ decision hadn't come down, but they did
not have the Fourth Amendment question in it.

The Fourth

Amendment question just came out of the blue from the Court of
Appeals.
QUESTION:

But then you petitioned to your Supreme

Court, didnrt you?
MR. TUCKER:

That's correct.

QUESTION: Raising this Fourth Amendment question?
MR. TUCKER:

That’s correct.

15
QUESTION!

And argued it, and 'they turned it down,

MR. TUCKER;

Well, we didn't argue it.

QUESTION:

Well, I know, you didn't argue it, but

you put it in your petition for review, or whatever you call
that?
MR. TUCKER;

Well, yes, we did.

QUESTION; And did you

how about the consent,

did you argue that?
MR. TUCKER;
QUESTION;
MR. TUCKER;
QUESTION;

The implied consent?
Yes .
No, we did not,
Mr. Tucker, suppose the Ringlemann test

tomorrow we re revised and improved so that it could be
effected from across the highway, and one didn't have to go
into the parking lot.
MR. TUCKER;

Would you have a different case at all?
Well, I think that's the absurdity of

the respondent's position, because the Ringlemann readings
could have been taken from the county road.

He merely pulled

onto the parking lot, to get his car off the road and on the
parking lot.

And he -— and the opacity readings can be

taken from off the property owned by the party in question.
QUESTION:
MR. I’UCKER;

Is Western a corporation?
Yes, it's a Kansas corporation.

Next, I would like to get into the due process
question.

Western objects here, because it

~~ asserts that

16
because it did not receive notice that -the readings were
being taken, that it could not effectively rebut the State's
case.
And this reasoning is not logical for two basic
premises.
No. 1, Western had an opportunity at the hearing
before the Board to put on whatever evidence it desired.

What

it did put before the Board was testimony from a vice president
that he had hired a Mr» Richard Ronning some months before this
June 4, 1969 incident, to take readings, and that it was Iii
opinion that their emissions did not exceed the 40 percent
opacity limited by the State, but there was no evidence that
Mr. Ronning was qualified to take opacity readings.
They also hired a local engineering firm to do a
study of their emissions after the cease and desist order
was issued, but they did not comply with the statute.
Now, the statute provides that if you're going to
have an emission particulate study -that you must notify the
division and the division must be present during the time
that the study is made, so that it can determine what the
methods used have some correlation to the Ringleraann and
opacity readings.
So Western put evidence before the Board which was
not competent evidence.

It cou3.d have had a qualified opacity

or Ringlemann reader on its premises, taking readings every

17
day*

It's required to have its operation in compliance

every day.

In fact, the law provides that if the emissions

exceed the 40 percent opacity for three minutes during any
one hour, then it's in violation of the law.
QUESTIONs

How much skill does it take — what

special skills are required to take these readings?
MR. TUCKER;

The State conducts a school, and it's

a very inexpensive thing.

They have what they call a smoke

generating machine, which has an electronic eye in it, and
it simply shoots up puffs of smoke which are measured by the
electronic eye, and the reader is — watches the smoke until
he becomes trained to read the smoke within a five percent
error.

And he must take 50 readings that do not exceed five

percent on either side, and if he has any one reading out. of
the fifty that exceeds twenty percent he must receive more
training until he attains that accuracy.
QUESTION;

How long, ordinarily, does this

training take?
MR. TUCKER;

It takes about a week.

QUESTION;

Does this mean that it!s purely visual?

MR. TUCKER;
QUESTION;
MR. TUCKER;
QUESTION;

Yes.
Purely visual, no device at all?
No.
So he could have stood, if he were

trained well enough, could have stood half a mile away and

18

been able to take the reading?
MR. TUCKER;

Well. they do have a recommended

distance from the opacity

or from the emissions, within

which an inspector should be, to obtain the best accuracy.
Now, I v/ould point out that in this case, of course,
‘these emissions, as the pictures show, which are on file with
the Court, could be observed from some distance, and in fact
some of the pictures were taken some distance from the plant.
So the inspector observed the violation before he ever entered
onto the plant premises.
And after he had observed the violations as he drove
up to the plant, he pulled off on the parking lot and took the
readings which were the subject of the hearing,
QUESTION;

What da you think the decision of the

Colorado court was, that the Fourth Amendment was violated,
or that there was an unfair trial, in that -there was unrebut"
able evidence presented?
Let's assume that there had been — that the inspectors
had come on the premises, called them up and said, "We're going
to come on to inspect", and they said, "Stay off"; and they
said, "No, we' re coming on, we just want to let you have
notice; you can be there, with your own machine if you want."
And took the same readings, except that the company was there
with its own machine.

Then they had the very same proceeding,

and the company contending that they had violated the Fourth

19

Amendment by coming on the premises and obtaining this
evidence.

It seems to me that the Court of Appeals might

have come out differently.
MR. TUCKER;

Well, of course it's speculation, and

it could have.
QUESTION; Well, didn’t they — how do you read it,
that the lack of notice was the fundamental error, or what?
MR. TUCKER;

No, the Court of Appeals, Mr» Justice

White, seemed to be disturbed by the lack of notice and the
fact that the readings were taken without their consent or
without a warrant.

All three seemed to disturb the Court of

Appeals, and so I don’t — I can't pick one of them out and
say if we

movedthat, the Court of Appeals would have

probably affirmed the Air Pollution Variance Board»
QUESTION; Well, has the agency changed its procedure
since the decision of your Court of Appeals?
MR» TUCKER;

No, the agency has not.

QUESTION;

They're still doing it the same way?

QUESTION;

There's been a change in the law, hasn't

there?
MR. TUCKER;

There's been a change in the law,

that's correct.
QUESTION; Right.
MR. TUCKER:

But as a matter of course people don't

object, and I don't know of any instance where they have

20

obtained a warrant.

They simply follow the same procedure.

QUESTION: But the law now does require a warrant if
the property owner objects?
MR. TUCKER:

That's correct.

Yes, the air pollution

law does.
QUESTION;

Well, at least, then, you must give a

notice that you're coming.
MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION:

Pardon?
At least, don't you give a notice now that

the inspector is coming to the plant?
MR. TUCKER:

No, they do not.

QUESTION: Well, then, how — if there’s an objection,
how is it registered?
MR. TUCKER;

Well, it would be registered at the

time of the hearing.
QUESTION;

And then you have to stop and get a

warrant and do it all over again, if he objects, then?
MR. TUCKER:

That’s correct.

I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.
QUESTION: Can you get a warrant ex parte?
MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Mr. Tucker, if you view the change in the

lav/, what is the relevancy of this case now?
MR. TUCKER:

I think the relevancy is to -- the

water pollution and other laws, and of course, as you know,

21

there are 34 States and the Federal Government in this case as
amicus, and many of them have laws that are similar to
Colorado's law as it existed at the time of this particular
incident»
QUESTION;

But Colorado is the only party.

Isn't it?
MR» TUCKER;

Well, if this Court should agree

with the Court of Appeals, it would have a drastic effect
upon water pollution enforcement and other health laws in the
States, which many of them do not require a warrant or consent.
They simply provide; as the air pollution law did* for entry
and inspection,
QUESTION;

But the only thing that's at issue here

““ remaining at issue* is this particular cease and desist
orderj the validity of the prior statute is not here because
the prior statute is gone,
MR, TUCKER;

Well, I think the validity of the

MR, TUCKER;

And the question

is whether that reading violated 'the Fourth Amendment rights
of the Western Alfalfa at that time,
QUESTION;

Nevertheless, the only thing that's at

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDMUND W. KITCH, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. KITCH:

Mr. Justice Douglas, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
Colorado Court of Appeals, Division II,
That Court held that a cease and desist order entered
by the Air Pollution Variance Board of the State of Colorado
against Western Alfalfa was unconstitutional, because based
on observations of three plants of Western Alfalfa, made in
violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the
Constitution of the United States.
The Court held that these observations had been made
in an unconstitutional manner, because, first, the inspector
making the observations had entered onto the premises of the
respondent without obtaining consent or a warrant? and,
second, because the observations were made without prior
notification to Western Alfalfa.
The observations made by the inspector on June 4th,
1969, showed that the opacity of the dry emissions from two
of the plants was 90 percent, and one of the plants was 85 per-

23

cento
These emissions were very substantially in excess
of 40 percent opacity permitted by the Colorado statutes

MR, KITCH;

They simply observe the smoke.

Second, the Ringlemann standard itself was developed
for use with carbon smoke and it's a black-white standard.
The standard here, which was also incorporated in the statute
is an opacity standard, rated on percentage of opacity,
essentially the percentage of light which is transmitted
through the emission plume.

It’s not correctly a Ringlemann

test here, and the inspector is simply trained to observe the
plume and determine the extent to which light is able to

QUESTION: Why does he stop the car?
MR. KITCH:

It says it’s a judgmental process.

In order to make accurate and reliable observations, there are
certain standard procedures which are followed.

in certain position in relation to the plume, and second, it
is considered appropriate for him to make a number of observa­
tions over a period of time, in order to increase the
reliability of his observation.

There's no question there was an entry

on the property here, and the observations were made from on
the property.
MR, KITCH:
QUESTION:

Well, —
And let's assume, for the moment, that

it was essential to go on the property to get it, to make a
proper observation.
MR. KITCH;

As your questions and those of your

brethren to the State of Colorado indicate, the nature of the
place from which these observations were made is rather
critical, to any development of Fourth Amendment issue here.
Fourth Amendment issue in this case was developed
in a most awkward procedural posture.

It was not raised and

argued before the Board, it was not argued before the District

26

Court, it was not argued before the Court of Appeals»

As we

have learned this morning, the Court of Appeals simply suddenly
decided that there was a Fourth Amendment problem,,
The only thing in the record that provides any
answer to where the inspector went is his answer on direct
examination in the record, page 25, that he went, quote,
"On the premises»"

MR. HITCH:

-- decided.

It’s our view that the

burden in this case, of asserting Fourth. Amendment claims and
developing a record, lay on Western Alfalfa, which claims now
to have been the object of an illegal Fourth Amendment search.
All they developed was ■— in fact, all the State
developed for them was that the inspector was on the premises.
That's fully consistent with the view that the inspector was
on an area of the premises fully accessible to the public.
And absent a better developed record, it seems to me
that that is —
QUESTION;

Well, that isn't the view of the Colorado

Court of Appeals.
MR. HITCH:

The Colorado Court of Appeals, it

seems to me, —
QUESTION:

Otherwise it wouldn't have found any

Fourth Amendment problems.
MR. HITCH;

I don't *— it is possible to take a

view of the Fourth Amendment, that any time you cross a
property line and you're a State official, you have entered,
private property, it's a Fourth Amendment problem.

And I

•think that view, which is an erroneous view, was the view7 of
the Colorado Court of Appeals.
Now, on that quite elementary ground, we urge that
tlie decision be reversed.
QUESTION;

Let me ask you the question I asked your

28
colleague.

If there had been notice here, do you think that

would have satisfied any objections that the Court of Appeals
might have had?
MR. KITCH:

No.

No, their reliance upon Camara and

separate Fourth Amendment problem.

That's right, under the decisions of

They apparently thought they were bound by the

precedents of this Court.
I think that the fact that they decided the case
on this issue without argument on the point, they went
straight.
QUESTION; And your whole point is that the record
simply doesn't support an entry at a place where consent
would be required?
MR. KITCH;

That's right.

As far as the record

shows, the entry was onto an area open to the public, and
our contention is that the inspectors for the State

of the inspector, that he was on the premises,

Yes, there1s that testimony and there

are the pictures, which I have not seen, and which are not

QUESTION: Well, okay, can you cell from looking at
the pictures where the pictures were taken from?
MR. KITCH:

I assume so, but you cannot relate

the place where the pictures were taken to where the observa­
tions were made.
QUESTION;

Were the pictures taken by the inspector

or by somebody else?
MR. KITCH;

Yes.

Yes.

QUESTION; The same day?
MR. KITCII;

Apparently they are sequenced.

When

he was some distance from the plant, he stopped and took a
shot; as he got closer, he took another shot.

And then he

took another shot.
He took his observations, and, as far as the record
shows, he then went down and chatted with the plant managers,
at least two of the locations about what they were doing to
come into compliance with the statute.

And went home.

There are issues, potential constitutional issues
about the power of inspectors of this type to enter various
parts and aspects of industrial premises, to cross fences,
to disregard "No Trespassing" signs, and they may be issues
this Court will have to face some day.

They are simply not

presented by this case.
They are purely interesting hypothetical questions

QUESTIONS

Well, what’s the concern of the United

States if this is affirmed?
MR. KITCH:

Well, if it’s affirmed, then the only

possible construction is that whenever an inspector enters
private property, even though there's a general holding out
to the public to enter it, that we have Fourth .Amendment
problems, and Fourth Amendment procedures must be adhered to.
And it will just complicate the process of making these
kinds of observations and other observations related to the
enforcement of regulatory statutes.
QUESTION;

We’ve also a due process problem here,

Which is kind of combined —
MR. KITCH; That’s correct.

There’s a due process
On that, as far as the United

States is concerned, I would like to emphasise that the
inclusion of these types of emission standards in State
implementation plans, under the Federal Air Pollution Control
Act, has been required by the Environmental Protection Agency,
because they, in the judgment of that agency, offer the only
feasible type of standard and means of testing which can be
feasibly enforced against a broad range of emission sources
on a continuing basis.
QUESTION;

What now?

What has been required?

I

missed it.
MR. KITCH;

The use in State — the States must

submit implementation plans which meet the federal standards,
which were set out by the Administrator of the Environmental

Protection Agency under the Federal Act»

And one of the things

that a State implementation plan must have is visible
emission standards.
type standards»

And that means opacity and Ringlemann

It's the only type known in the field»

The reference is 40 Code of Federal Regulations,
Section 51,19 sub (c).

for this purpose, and then removed, because of its expense,
its delicate nature, and so on.

MR. KITCHs

Parti, cuiatss.

QUESTION: Right.
MR. KITCHs

Now, that type of testing simply can't

be done without the cooperation, advance notice to the plant.
It's expensive, and it's the judgment of the federal agency
that, if they have to rely on that kind of testing alone, there
can be no feasible air pollution control program which is
applicable to all emissions of all types.
QUESTION s
MR. KITCH;

Mr. Kitch, —
It's been shown — the case — let me

say this — the case in the Court

of Appeals for 'the

District of Columbia, Portland Cement, which has been remanded
and which the agency is working on, involves an opacity
standard of ten percent, which is very close to clear.

And

the question that the Court raised was whether that, with that
low a standard you could make reliable observations such as to
make it a workable, feasible standard.

35

The standard here was 40 percent, which is kind of
half dark smoke.

And the observations here were 90 percent,

which means that they practically completely obscured the
view .
The factual question at ten percent is quite
different from the factual question presented on this record.
Mr. Jus tice Powell?
QUESTION;
MR. KITCH:

I will ask you oiie —
My time has run.

QUESTION; Right.

Well, I'll ask you one question.

This company had notice, in effect, in twelve days, as I
recall, after these tests were made.

That gave it some

opportunity to go out and have tests of its own made.
Would you be troubled if the first time the company
heard of this was, say, six months later?

The quality of air

is rather ephemeral condition, and it wouldn't have done the
company much good so far as preparing to defend itself, if,
six months later, it had been told that on a certain day in
June it had violated the law.
MR. KITCH:

Wall, the general problem of passage of

time, as it affects the ability of the defendant to defend
himself, is one that's come before this Court in a number of
different contexts, and the general approach has been that
there must be some showing of prejudice.
Now, if, for instance, they didn’t get notice for

36
six months, and there's no showing of any reason why they
shouldn't have had notice more promptly, and they showed that
in that period they had quite innocently made significant
changes in the plant, so that they weren't in the position
to make any effort to reproduce this operation and demonstrate
that it in fact operated within the standards, that, for
instance, seems to me to be prejudice.
Or if they got notice in six months and they had
to have the hearing in thirty days thereafter, and they said,
"Well, the crop season's over, we would like to run the plant
and we will get experts out and we will show that when it’s
running like it runs, it's clean," and the State says,"Well,
you have to have the hearing now, we're sorry it's winter."
It seems to me that would be prejudice.
But what is notably absent from this record is any
effort by the company to conduct, by its own experts, a
Ringlemann opacity observation, and introduce it into evidence.
Indeed, on page 73 of the record you find that
counsel for Western Alfalfa states — he saysj

"judging from

the testimony I heard here at the first hearing, unless there
is some change in the method of operation of these dehydrationg
plants

,

I will expect the staff to come out and say we are

finding Ringlemann violations."
His view seemed to be that if we were going to go
through this again, the staff would come out and they will

37

look at the plants, and they will say that this is more than
40 percent.

And they —~

QUESTION;

Well, the Court of Appeals opinion

indicates that Western had its own Ringleraann testimony,
MR. KITCIIs

They offered the observation, a written

letter to them from their hired consultant, one Mr. Ronning,
who was not qualified, the letter didn't — he was not
called to testify, not subject to cross-examination.

He

did not — his letter didn't indicate the conditions under
which the plants were operating.

It was just totally deficient

as an evidentiary offer and was made — in fact, the observa­
tions were taken some period of time before.
QUESTION:

Well, the Court of Appeals opinion says

Western countered this evidence with Ringlemann readings
taken by a consulting engineer hired by Western, which showed
no violation.
Then they also offered the results of the
sophisticated test conducted at their plant by an independent
engineering firm some months after -they were issued the cease
and desist order.
MR. KITCH: Well, both offers are defective for
reasons shown in the record, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Yes, well, the first doesn't seem to

have been an offer, it seems to have been the introduction of
evidence.

showing that, by evidence, that under those operating conditions

emissions of this -—
QUESTION;

overtones, some court would decide there was a denial of due

QUESTION;

Well, why, for heaven's sake?

MR. KITCH;

The —

Well, the — we have reports, the

Environmental Protection Agency, from inspectors that when tliey
do come on some plants, when they give notice, it suddenly
turns out the plant finishes its run, and it seems they are
going home for the day.

And the inspector can wait, maybe he

can sit around, and, well, the next day — or he has many

39

other inspections to make and he leaves.

And when he leaves,

we get word the plant is running again.
QUESTION: Well, of course, the federal statute seems
to require presentation of credentials.
MR. KITCHs
credentials.

That's correct.

And we do present

But we would like to leave the option for

statutory flexibility, if their experience under -these Acts
shows that

there are problems of particular types.
Also I think there's an open question under the

federal statute as to whether these kinds of opacity
observation —» presumably under the federal statute, these
kinds of opacity observations can be made under the Fourth
Amendment from property open to the public, and which no
special governmental right of entry has to be asserted.
And the due process area would require that the
opacity observation made from a public highway not be made,
unless notice is given in advance. And some of these plants,
they can turn on the scrubbers, turn off the scrubbers, the
precipitators and so on, and it saves them money not to have
them on.
And our inspectors can't be everywhere at all times.
QUESTION:

That's the same kind of argument that's

made in every constitutional case, the argument of necessity
and practicality, —
MR. KITCH;

That's correct.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD D. CAWELTI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CAWELTI;

Mr. Justice Douglas, may it please

the Courts
I am Donald D. Cawelti, and I'm the attorney for the
respondent, and have been throughout these long proceedings.
I have some remarks that I!d like to proceed with in
some order, but I think, particularly in view of the questions
that have been addressed to the Court, I'd like very much to
point out what this record shows and what it does not show.
QUESTION;

I gather from reading the proceedings

before the Board, and some of the statements that you've made,
that this has been an on-going controversy between the State
authority and the respondent.
MR. CAWELTI;

No, it's been on-going, I would not

characterize it as a controversy.

Justice White went into

41

this with Mr» Tucker»

This had been going on for some two

years previous in this implied consent discussion that was
had.
Certainly these personnel from the enforcement
department of the division of health had been on Western's
premises during, I believe, two season previous to this
occurring.

This was during that period of time which is

referred to in the statute as the conference, conciliation and
persuasion phase of enforcement.
They were on there, announced their presence,
discussed what was going on, suggested improvements. This is
all shown in the record, and indeed, as the inspector admitted,
substantial improvements had been made.

They were looking

much better.
In fact, I think they had, in view of the remarks
that they have made, intended to lull Western into a sense,
particularly with Mr. Ronning's report, their own examiner,
that they were in compliance or very close to compliance.
So this had been going on in a very cooperative way,
I think the record shows, for the previous two years.

These

two years before that they were on there, they were not there
to gather evidence when they came on the premises, they were
there in an effort, for conciliation.

No.

I expect the staff to continue with that expression.
QUESTION: Did you offer at any time any evidence that
the company was complying with these tests?

Did you have your

43

own tests made?
MR. CAWELTI;

Here's what we offered, which is

really all we felt we coulds

the year before, 1967, and observed very marginal violations,

percent.

The violation being 40

We offered a letter in evidence they had written

the following summer, in 1968, that they had noticed marked
improvement in the operation of the plants»
We offered the evidence of Mr. Ronning's examination
that following fall, in 1968, finding them in compliance with
visual standards.
Now, granted, this was all before the critical
June 4th date.

We offered the results of a particulate

examination made August following the June when the State was
out there, showing that from a particulate point of view they
were in compliance.
And I do wish to disagree with Mr. Tucker's remark
that, the State would entertain evidence as to what occurred
after June 4th.
I'd like to refer to page 77 of the record, where I
had, myself, an exchange with Mr. Heaton, one of the Board
members.

He stated;
"Let me talk about the law on June 4.

Mr. Heaton stated to me;

I don’t have

he's correct, it was August.

And so forth.
"Your testimony is that you didn't think you were
in violation" — "you didn't think you were in violation of
the law on that date".
And there is another reference in there, but I
couldn't find it during — since this came up.

There's one

other reference in the record somewhere, that June 4 was their
date.

QUESTION:

Mr» Cawelti, your reference to your

colloquy with Mr» Heaton at page 77, I take it the Board is
probably a lay board, it doesn't consist entirely of
attorneys»

In my own experience with those kind of boards is

that frequently a member of the board may not properly
conceive exactly what the legal issue is, but generally
before they make their decision they are advised by their
counsel.
I wonder if it's entirely fair to attribute to MrP
Heaton what’s the ultimate position of the Board as to -the
issue of when, when the violation was
MR. CAWELTI:

Mo, it’s not»

It's not fair to

attribute that to Mr. Heaton what other Board members may have
felt but not said.

He happened to have been one of the more

outspoken members of the Board, as the record shows.
The decision of the Board itself found a violation

I think that will be shown in the

appendix, in the record.
QUESTION;

Is there in the appendix what might be

the judgment or the order of the Board?
MR. CAWELTI;

Yes, I think that was attached to the

original petition for cert? it's not in the appendix, but
attached to the original petition.

And that refers to the

date in question,
QUESTION;

Mr. Cawelti, getting back again to that

colloquy on page 77, at the bottom of the page you say that
you couldn't possibly reproduce a defense for June 4, but that
what you had offered, whether it was August or whatever date
it xtfas that it was taken, that there was testimony the
conditions on the August day were identical, or the same as
on June 4, and therefore you had done the best you could with
your particulate evidence to establish that since, as of
August, you we re in compliance and the conditions were the
same as on June 4? therefore, the Board should take as your
defense that on June 4 you were in compliance.
MR. CAWELTI:
QUESTION;

Isn't that it?

That's what we tried.

Unh-hunh„

MR. CAWELTI:

The Board apparently didn’t accept it.

It took idle visual observations made on June 4 in preference
to “—
QUESTION;

Incidentally, getting back now to page 73,

47
your discussion of — was this a sort of burden”of-proof thing?
I'm looking at the bottom of the page, where you say that
you'd expect the staff to come out and say, well, there were
Ringlemann violations, and the only way you'd be able
effectively to defense against that would be by making
expensive particulate tests?
MR. CAWELTI;
QUESTION:

Yes.
Unh-hunh„

MR. CAWELTI:

Now, there was a confused period of

time here involved that I think is difficult to understand.
On June 4th, when the violation was charged, the only standard
to determine whether or not there was a violation was this
visual opacity reading. ,
At the end of June, first of July a law became
effective, which permitted a person accused of a violation to,
at his own expense, make a particulate test, which is more
expensive and more difficult, and —
QUESTIONS

Well now, to make it when?

As of the

same day that the visual readings were taken?
MR. CAWELTI;
QUESTION;

Well, it couldn't, obviously

I see.

MR. CAWELTI:
QUESTION s
MR. CAWELTI:

— do it.
Not unless you knew about it.
No, not unless you knew about it.

And had the equipment in place to do it.

48
The problem here, of course, is that we felt so
we were taken advantage of, that we didn’t know until two
weeks afterwards, they made the analogy there and elsewhere
that .it's like receiving a citation in the mail that two
weeks ago you were observed speeding on a highway.

It’s

pretty hard to remember just what you were doing two weeks
ago.

Although if you get a ticket right, now, you probably

know right now whether you were violating or weren't
violating,
QUESTION?

Mr, Cawelti, in the findings of fact of

the Variance Board, in the petition for certiorari Appendix E™2,
one of -the findings of fact, No, 6, is that petitioner
performed a test pursuant to section such-and-such of the
Colorado statutes, ’’but the Board finds that Petitioner did
not comply with the statute in performing said test" et
cetera.

I don’t get any implication from that finding or

any of the others, that the fact the test may have related
to a different date would have meant that -the Board would
have excluded it.
MR, CAWELTI;

No, I don't find it there.

Really,

they excluded it because the staff of the department had not
approved of the method of taking, nor the correlation that
existed between particulate and visual.
That has to kind of remain unanswered, what the
effect would have been of a later test.

We had the impression,

very far in talking about later tests»
QUESTIONS As a matter of Colorado law, what does the
~~ what's the aftermath of a denial of variance by the Board?
MR. CAWELTI:

Well, then you're expected, if you

were denied a variance, and you of course operated in violation,
you would be issued a cease and desist order, and if you
violated that you'd be subject to criminal penalties»
Now, we had a little confusion in this case.

The

Board denied Western a variance when it hadn't actually asked
for one, and I think they admitted their error in that»
When Western was charged with this violation, it came in and
said, We're not guilty»
And the hearing was held on that basis»

Well, the

Board said, You are guilty and you can't have a variance.
Well, there hadn't been any variance hearing, and
this was, I think, more a procedural mixup than anything else,
and nothing ever came of it.
One other factual matter — I do have something
organized here, if I can get to it in a minute — but one
other factual matter I'd like to address myself to is Mr.
Tucker's statement that this could have been seen from the
highway, or the charge could have been made from the highway.
Or from a nearby open field.
We don't know that.

We know that he entered the

But there's a lot of water evaporated, and you can
sometimes, as one of these pictures show, even from a
good distance away — the inspector, one place or another in
the record here, talks about what he judges it because of
the blue haze trailing off after the steam has evaporated.
Well, that can’t be done from a long ways away, I
submit.

And apparently the inspector didn't feel it could

be done from a long ways away.

The State must feel that it's

MR. CAWELTI:

That's right.

QUESTION: So I kind of lose what you're arguing
about.
MR. CAWELTI:

I'm saying that we — the point seemed

to be made ~~ being made, that he could have seen this violation without having been on the premises.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. CAWELTI;

And therefore, because he came on the

premises, there can't be any Fourth Amendment violation or
need to give notice or anything like that.
I think my point is, if in fact these observations
had been made off of the premises, we wouldn't have anything
really here to talk about today.
QUESTION;

Isn't it true that you — all your

position is that solely because he was one foot on the
premises, you don't have to worry about anything, you win?
Isn't that what you're arguing?
Even if you were 90 percent in violation, the fact
that he was one foot on there, you're free.

That's your

argument?
MR. CAWELTI;

I'm concerned -- all right, I suppose,

I'd like to come to that in just

53

QUESTION;

Yes.

QUESTIONs

You're not bound by what Mr. Justice White

tells you is your strongest point, so go ahead.
[Laughter.]
MR. CAWELTIs

No, I really wasn't going to address

that substantial evidence thing right away, I think ray
strongest point is the two cases decided by Justice White in
1967, Camara and See.

And I don't know why we haven't

talked more about them.
QUESTION;

But it's time -—

The Court — the Court decided those.

MR. CAWELTI:

Yes, it's written by him; sorry.

Yes, decided by the Court.
QUESTION;

Well, let me ask you a question about

those cases, if I may, Mr. Cawelti.
In our California bankers case that this Court had
about the beginning of the month, we referred to the United
States vs. Morton.Salt case, which was decided in the late
Forties, to the effect that corporations don't have quite as
extensive Fourth Amendment rights as individuals.
Now, as I recall, Camara and S€e were both cases of
individual householders, weren't they?

At least noncorporate

businesses.
MR. CAWELTI:

They were not corporations.

business and one was an individual.

One was a

The significance of the

See case was that a businessman, with respect to his private

54
property has just as fundamental rights as an individual with
respect to his house.

That there is no distinction between

business interests owned by an individual, true, and his own
residence.
Neither involved a corporation. These two cases did
hold, though, that an administrative search of private property,
whether it’s residence or business, without proper consent is
per se unreasonable, and in violation of the Fourth Amendment,
if no search warrant has been obtained.

Except in certain

special circumstances, which the Court discussed in these
two cases.
And we

impliedly, all the way through here, the

State seems to be arguing that these two cases don't apply
or shouldn't apply.

And they’ve offered a number of grounds

in that respect.
I think it's important to focus on just what the
search of inspection was here.

We do know, as Justice Marshall

points out, that the inspector did go on the premises.

He

didn't go on for conference of conciliation, he didn't go on
for a cup of coffee, he went on there to get evidence this
time.

He was there at least ten minutes, it may have been

more.

The EPA indicates you should be there thirty minutes,

to make a proper Ringleraann examination.
He did take pictures.

The State, for reasons known

to it, decided not to introduce those pictures in support of

55
tile State's case.

The inspector said, I believe, that they

really don't show anything? and I don't think they do.

I

put them in because I think, to demonstrate the steam and so
forth.
This did constitute a search, I believe, as the
Court said in the Katz case, involving the telephone booth,
that the Fourth Amendment not only extends to the seizure of
tangible things but also extends to intangibles, such as,
in that case, a recording of a conversation.

I'm sure a

photograph would be search.
QUESTION:
MR. CAWELTI:

MR. CAWELTIs

Well, it had to be somewhere.
But it was the sky.
It was ■— what was being emitted from

this equipment and plant of -—
QUESTION: Well, once it left the plant, it didn't

I don't think a search is any less a search

55

QUESTIONS Well,, Mr. Cawelti, if you feel so strongly
that it was a search, why wasn't this raised in the Colorado
court?
MR„ CAWELTI:

Well, it was in the Court of Appeals,

it was not raised and no proper record was made before the
Variance Board.
I’ve got to be quite candid, that I found out an
awful lot about search and seizure in the whole course of this
argument than I ever knew before I started in this case.
And there are — it’s unfortunate the record is not more
complete, and it could have been.
The evidence itself that we’re talking about here
is the degree of opacity of this particular emission.

It

would be ideal if that could be preserved and brought into
court.

But of course it can't be.
Pictures of it I suppose could be, if they showed

something.

It happens the pictures here didn’t show anything.
Second-best evidence is what we had here, the visual

description of what the inspector saw.
I think the government conceded in its brief that
if particular measuring equipment had been installed, that the
results of that would have been a search if it had been
brought into court.
I don't think it’s any less of a search because the
method of observation, reporting the evidence was in a sense

57
proved.
The inspector apparently felt it necessary to go on
the premises, and, as I've said, the State now feels it's
necessary to defend his going on the premises.

At one point

in this case the argument was made that the open-field doctrine

Well, perhaps it would, if we had a factual background
to apply it to.

They were made from the

whether they're open to the public or not.

The federal, Justice Department refers to the fact
there was no fence around it.

A question was asked, was any

Well, I submit, to assure your privacy, .it's not
necessary to put up a fence to insure that you won't be
intruded upon with unnecessary investigations.

It shouldn't

involved.

There doesn't appear to be a fence

We don't know where he was on the premises.
QUESTION: Do you think the right of privacy depends

at all on who else besides government inspectors you make
welcome?

I mean, if you make buyers and sellers and visitors

welcome to the premises, do you think you still have a right of

53
privacy as against government inspectors?
MR. CAWELTIs

This comes into the plain-view

doctrine, I mean, you can't ignore what is in plain view.
I think that is where xve have to seek the answer to this.
Certainly anybody, whether a police officer or not, has got
the right to walk up and down the aisle of a grocery store,,
to see what’s showing there.
The extent to which you expect a person to be there
and see what they’re seeing, I think is important.

The Court

addressed itself, most recently, to, I think, what this
problem was in the Coolidge case, vs. New Hampshire.

And it

was in that case that, in discussing what may be in plain
view’, that a couple of limitations were discussed by the
Court.
First of all, they indicated that the officer
involved should have a prior justification for being where
he was.

A legitimate reason to be there, unconnected with the

search that is being made.
It reiterated again, the case did, that the plainview doctrine didn't

it was still true that no intrusion

is justified without a careful determination of necessity,
and that the discovery of the evidence involved must be an
inadvertency $ that, where do you go on to a person’s property,
looking for something, as the inspector did here, knowing that
he was going to make a search, it can be hardly said that what

59

he found was

he justified it because it was in plain view.

I think in this case, or one other one similar to it, the
Court indicated that if you poke around long enough you can
always find something in plain view.
That’s about as close as I can get to what that
problem is, and the answers that I've found by this Court.
QUESTION;

Of course, the open-field case you

mention is that Hester case by Holmes.
MR. CAWELTI;

Yes.

Sometime ago, and still standing

as good law in tills Court, as far as I can determine.
But we don’t seem to be having an open field here.
From which the observations were made. The case would be very
simple if we did,
QUESTION;

It’s an open sky, yes.

MR. CAWELTI;
QUESTION;

Yes »

Do you have — are you familiar with the

case of United States v. Lee?

Decided about the same vintage

as Hester, a little later, the prohibition era, where the
Coast Guard cutter shined its light on the rum-runner?
MR. CAWELTI;
QUESTION:

No.

I don’t —

And it was held that that was not a

violation of the Fourth Amendment.
MR. CAWELTI;
QUESTION:

Yes.
By means of a searchlight on the Coast

Guard cutter, they discovered grain alcohol aboard the

60

rura-runner.
MR. CAWELTI:

Yes, there were a lot of stills

discovered in those days, too, that may or may not have been
in plain view,
QUESTION; There were.
MR. CAWELTI:

And I think a lot of law was made

on that account.
I don't think the present status of our law would
allow a revenue agent to go poking around in my backyard or
somebody else's field to see if he could find a still,
tucked away behind a lilac bush.

I don't believe our law

presently permits that, in recent decisions of this Court.
Perhaps it may have been different in the Twenties.
QUESTION s

There are some lower court cases that

say that if there's enough smoke coming from the still, that’s
grounds to go in.
MR. CAWELTI:
QUESTION;

Grounds to go in —

I hate to use the word "smoke" on you.

But that's what it was.
MR. CAWELTI;
QUESTION;

Where there's smoke, there's —
Fire.

MR. CAWELTI:

— a still.

[Laughter.]
QUESTION:

Mr. Cawelti, may I ask, put this hypo­

thetical question to you;

Suppose that the government had

61

reason, let’s say the federal government had reason to believe
that some criminal activity was going on in your client's
building, in addition to its legitimate operation*

We’ve

been talking about stills, assume that it had some reason to
believe a still was being operated.

There are counterfeit

operations,
And that an FBI agent had come on the premises to the
same extent as the Colorado inspector did here, and taken
photographs.

Would your position be the same?

MR, CAWELTI:

Now, I understand that the inspector

came on, lawfully, with a warrant or otherwise, looking for
something else and found the still —QUESTION;

No, no, no.

No,

All that was done was

the government wanted photographs of the building.

Instead

of taking them with a long-lens camera, say, from the highway,
the government officer stepped on the parking lot and took
pictures of the building that was suspect as a possible base
for criminal operation,
MR, CAWELTI;

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION: Would the government have
Fourth Amendment violation?

committed a

It would have engaged in a trespass,

but would the Fourth Amendment have been violated?
MR, CAWELTI;

I think in a technical sense these

things can always be pushed to a line where they seem
ridiculous.

I think these cases have said that any invasion

62

of property, any intrusion, without judicial review in
advance, except in certain circumstances
to -- is prohibited by the Fourth Amendment,

which we can get
I think Camara

and See have said that.
Most of the time has been spent in what these
exceptions are.

The case of Katz approached this problem

that we’ve both been discussing now,
invasion.

A minimum, a minimal

And in that case the Court allowed that here

they were overhearing a conversation in the phone booth $
that this was about as minimal an invasion of privacy as
you can have.

But still this was forbidden under the

restrictions of the Fourth Amendment, because there had not
been a prior jizdicial review of the invasion of privacy which
occurred in making -that search.
Now, these fine lines are always difficult, but I
would have to say that that perhaps approaches what we're
talking about.
We were on the Coolidge case and the plain-view
doctrine, and a number of other statements made by the Court
in that case in connection with the right of privacy and so
forth.

I'd like to return a minute to the Camara and See

cases, which were important in the particular context, of
saying that these restrictions imposed by the Fourth omendment
to secure privacy and guard against intrusion apply with
equal force to administrative inspectors as they do to police

63

officers.

In pointing out in that case that the additional
body of law that has developed outside of our earlier
traditions, which is involved with these administrative type
of compliance, inspections, and so forth? and certainly in
this day and age that we're in now, we're coining into what,
more and more, are environmental matters particularly»
And I think the Court was concerned in these cases
in 1967 that the people enforcing these laws were not going
to be as concerned with, or they weren't aware that they
should be as concerned with rights of privacy and security
as in the conventional lav; enforcement way»

And that is the

import of these cases, as saying to fire inspectors,
building inspectors, and so forth;

You have to be just as

concerned about rights of individuals as people involved in
more direct criminal activities.
QUESTION;

Well, what do you do about Colonnade and

Biswell?

' "
MR. CAWELTI;

about this.

Colonnade.

All right.

I’d like to do something

Colonnade is a little like the

situation we have here, where the inspectors were denied
access to a liquor stock, I believe it was, and forced their
way in and seised the liquor stock, which indeed was improperly
labeled bottles.
Justice Douglas, author of the opinion in that case,

64

suppressed that evidence.
QUESTION 5

But he —

MR. CAWELTI:
QUESTION:

I think the Court — only — only

would that have

happened if the door hadn't been locked?
MR. CAWELTI:

I don’t know.

I think the Court —

QUESTION: Well, what about the next case?
MR. CAWELTI:

Biswell?

Biswell involved, as the

Court is aware, the situation of a businessman who desired
to go into a business involving sales and distribution of
guns, requiring him to obtain a license, knowing that it was
a pervasively regulated business, I think was the language
of the Court, and that he would indeed be subject to
investigations, and investigations made without a warrant.
Now, I think Biswell is quite a bit different
situation than we have here.

I’m surprised it hasn’t come

up earlier in our discussion.

But here, of course, there’s

no federal license involved, there's no license at all
involved in operating an alfalfa dehydrating plant.
can start one up.

Anybody

It’s a necessary adjunct to the agricultural

economy of the area.

Instead of baling it and selling it,

they dry it, pelletise it, stock it, and sell it.
No license is necessary.

There's no regulations

applicable to the business, other than the regulations that
all of us are subject to, in terms of fire codes, building

65

codes, zoning, and so forth? air pollution, which we're all
subject to»
There's no regulations unique to the business, as
in the Gun Control Act, as in the Biswell case.
I don’t think there's anything can be drawn from
that, saying that the exception made from Camara and See by
Biswe11 should be extended to this situation.

I see no

rationale for it.
Colonnade, to return to that for just a minute,
there the evidence was gathered, was pressed, because there
was no statutory scheme set forth for warrantless inspections.
I think, as I look at the statute involved in that case, I
find it identical with the statute of Colorado in this case.
Entry is authorized, but no scheme involved, no requirement
for identification, no limitation on time, no limitation on
scope.

The Court in that situation said;

there may be a

statutory scheme authorizing entry without warrant, but as
long as no particulars are spelled out, no limitations are
spelled out, requirements of the Fourth Amendment still
apply.
Well, the same could be said in this situation.
Wow, throughout the course of briefing and argument
in this case, there have been a number of remarks about the
burden of obtaining a search warrant.

In the first place, I

think we should realize the warrant is going to be an isolated

66
situation.

I think Mr. Tucker indicated, most people

no

percentage is given >— but most people in the situation where
a person identifies himself is going to allow the inspector
to corae in.
QUESTION:

Well, I have a great problem.

What are

you going to search?
MR. CAWELTI:

You're going to walk anywhere you want

to on this person's premises, as this inspector did, he had
to go from one location to another to get the sun and the
wind and the —
QUESTION: There's nothing in the record —
MR. CAWELTI:

— and so forth in the right place.

QUESTION: There's nothing in the record that said
he moved around.
MR. CAWELTI:

it might
QUESTION:

I thought the only thing was that he

entered the premises.

One sentence.

He said that's all

there was,
MR. CAWELTI:
that's all there was.

As to the nature of the premises,
Whether it was a parking lot or

whether it was open to the public, or otherwise; that's all
it said.
The record did say that he moved from one location
to another on the premises.

67
QUESTIONS

Well, I missed that.

MR, CAWELTIs
QUESTION;

Yes,

I'll find it,

I’m making —

Well, I still want to know -- all I know

he searched was the skies,
MR, CAWELTI;
QUESTION;

In plain view.

MR, CAWELTI;
Well,

What was going into --

What was going into them, yes.

oh, I lost my train of thought.

Oh, I was

talking about search warrants.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. CAWELTI:

Would this have hindered -- would this

requirement hinder making these type of inspections.
Most of the time not.

People will consent.

If the

consent is withheld, you go on and identify ~ the inspector
goes on, identifies himself.

If consent is withheld, then

the inspector has got to decide:
open field?

well, can I do it from the

Go over and stand over there and get my job

done, or is it necessary I be here on the premises?
And I think Camara and See require that if he must
be on the premises, if he’s going to intrude for the purpose of
gathering evidence, go get a warrant.
There's been some talk that the timeliness that's
needed and so forth.

In Colorado, Rule 41, a warrant —

there is no limitation on how long you can get a warrant for.
For a reasonable time, presumably.

Get one and it lasts you

68

for two weeks.

And any time you go by you're ready to go

there with a warrant.
And if you have any reason to be —* think you’re
going to be refused, get your warrant before you go.

There’s

no indication, for example, in this case, the inspector setting
out on this June 4th morning, June 6th, to visit these three
plants and issue citations.
along with him.

He could have taken a warrant

The result of the case would have been

exactly the same? the evidence would have been the same.
I don't think it can be said that the lack of —that his having to get a warrant would have impeded him, his
activity.
We’ve talked about, he insisted, indeed, all the way
through this that the accused should have notice of the
inspector being there.
Now, aside from this affording the right to object
to an inspection being made, evidence being gathered, I think
it should be noted that this is not an uncommon statutory
scheme.

It is referred to in the government's brief.

Generously provided, and gives more examples than I could
have thought of, where the credentials must be shown before
you can go on.
Indeed, the federal Clean Air Act for just these
type of inspections, Federal Water Pollution Act, the Mine
Safety Act, all require that before you make an inspection

69
you show your credentials.

This is not uncommon»

The Colorado law, as it now reads, you must get
consent, or a warrant.

Well, obviously, you can't get your

consent if you don't even ask.

If a person doesn’t know you're

there, so it, in effect, requires you to coma up and give
notice that you are there.
A curious example, speaking of the Colorado law, is
that if you're going to take a tangible sample of whatever
you're looked at in air pollution, you're required to give
it to the person you took it from.

It's strange that the

Colorado lav; says if you're going to take a visual
impression of whatever you’re charging the evidence of, there's
no requirement that the person from whom, or on whose
property you take this visual impression, hasn't got a right
to be there simultaneously and look at the same thing.
!’Lod<; this is what I'm going to charge you with."
That's all we've asked in this case»

And so you'd have a

chance to look yourself and see what’s there.
of answering.

Have some way

If you did complain bitterly, maybe at too

much length, our people going to the smoke school run by the
State of Colorado were not certified that they were competent,
that they had taken the smoke school, so that they could
testify with the same degree of credibility the State inspectors
did.
But perhaps that’s nit-picking.

70
The point is we had no opportunity to look at that
dissipating,, evanescent, here now and gone forever evidence
that the violation is based on.
We spent a good deal of time in our brief talking
about the constitutional adequacy of the Ringlemann test.
I don't propose to go into that in greater detail»

The Court,

by its questions, has indicated its concern with -the sufficiency
of that as a test.
We did direct the Court's attention and perhaps aware
of already, the situation in the Pennsylvania Power case.

I

only have the report in the Environmental Law Reporter, where
--- and State implementation plan was turned down by the federal
court, the federal Appeals Court, because the instrument of
enforcement was the Ringlemann test.

And I'm sure that

case is going to end up here before it's finished, because
the Justice Department attorney indicated this is a very
common omission in the implementation plans.
There's a crude test, granted it's quick, speedy,
get-it-and-go sort of thing, but it's not a very good indica­
tion of how much actual emissions, pollutants, if you please,
are involved.
I can't help but think it’s important that the
Colorado law has changed since this all came up, and, as Mr.
Tucker has indicated, they can't do what they're trying to
justify and urge this Court they should be able to do, even

now under Colorado law.
QUESTION:

It makes me wonder why we're here,

You're here because you petitioned for

certiorari and it was granted.
MR. CAWELTI:

The State petitioned for certiorari.

I'm here, because I was called here.
QUESTION:

Oh, that's right.

MR. CAWELTI:

You're quite right.

I think the effect of a reversal by

this Court of what the Colorado court has done would be a very
open invitation to all people engaged in this area of law
enforcement that you can go on with you want to, without
telling anybody, and make your investigations in secret and
advise them later.

HR. CAWELTI:
QUESTION:

It did, it —

What did it —

MR. CAWELTI:

— did on almost the same language

as the Court, of Appeals.

I think what the Court of Appeals

did —
QUESTION:

Well, but did it refer to the Fourteenth

Amendment?
MR. CAWELTI:

Thos fundamental elements of due

process, I think that's about the way it referred to it.
QUESTION:

Well, you have a constitution in

Colorado, also, don't you?
MR. CAWELTI:
QUESTION:

Yes.

With some due process attached to it?

MR. CAWELTI:
QUESTION:

I think in this —

Indeed we do.

Yes.

MR. CAWELTI:

And of course the Court of Appeals

carried it one step forward.

I think it's the — as I found

in going into this case further and further, this notice
argument under the Fourteenth Amendment does tend to lead you
right into the search problem under the Fourth Amendment,

identifying yourself, letting it be known what's going on,
giving a chance to either object or, if nothing else, to be
able to defend»
My

time is well up, isn't it?

Thank you very much.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS:

I think you have about three

or four minutes remaining, Mr» Tucker»
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM TUCKER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR„ TUCKER:

Thank you, Mr. Justice Douglas.

I think, to answer your question that you asked
earlier, Mr» Justice White, the fact that there was a trespass
doesn't make any difference, as this Court articulated in
the Katz case.

And the Court said:

"Assuming that the officers were both trespassers
and lacking in probable casue. Fourth. Amendment protections
do not extend to the open field area surrounding a dwelling
and the immediate adjacent curtilage, and therefore, information
gained as a result of the civil trespass on open field is not
constitutionally tainting."
The pictures and the testimony of Inspector Taylor
showed that he observed this plume of smoke, before he was
actually on the premises of Western Alfalfa.

He had justifiable

cause to enter onto the premises and obtain the evidence which
he did.

And that was an opacity reading by the smoke plume,

74
or the plume which they were putting into the atmosphere»
Counsel has stated in his argument that the evidence
would be the same if a warrant had been obtained» And that’s
exactly correct»

And therefore a warrant would serve no

useful purpose»
If the State had had a warrant or had obtained
consent, the evidence would be exactly the same, because
Western Alfalfa or none of these operations have a trained
smoker on the premises»

They would not have been able to

take opacity readings of their own on that particular day.
And, in fact, after they received the cease and desist order
some twelve days later, they still didn’t take any opacity
readings.
So consent or a warrant would not change the fact
situation at all, and would not change the evidence»
So it is a useless gesture to require the State to
go through the process of obtaining a warrant»

The inspector

here was merely observing what was being put into the
atmosphere for anyone who desired to look and see»
The due process question is no different than an
individual who is speeding»
example.

Counsel has used that as an

You're not warned by an officer prior to your

speeding that he’s going to observe you. and if you speed
you're going to get a ticket.
QUESTION;

He stops you after the fact.

But it's generally very soon after the

75

fact.

It's not ten days or two weeks later,
MRa TUCKERS

That's correct.

But what Western is

complaining about here is they’re saying, We did not have
notice at the time, so that we could have an independent
observer present.
You're not —- you do not have any right to have an
independent observer present on the highway.

So that you

have an independent third party to testify against the
officer, saying you were not speeding,
QUESTION: But you’re in the car and you have a
speedometer, and

That’s correct,
So at least — and it happens the arrest

Both of the laws are to protect the public interest,

welfare and safety, and that is you must operate your car on
the highways in a manner that you do not endanger the safety
of other people using the highway.

Western Alfalfa cannot

use the atmosphere in a manner that it endangers the health
and safety of the rest of the —
QUESTION:

How does Colorado administratively

76

handle these problems?

Would they require a plant, assuming

you find the plant has violated the law, to put in certain
kinds of new equipment?
MR. TUCKER: They require a plant to submit a plan
whereby they are going to bring the operation into compliance,
and they have a choice of numerous equipment that can be
installed on the plant to either catch the particulate
matter before it escapes into the atmosphere, or some manner
to prevent it from going into the air.
QUESTION; This pertains only to the particulate
matter?
MR. TUCKER;
QUESTIONs

That's correct.
Nothing to do with sulphur and things of

that kind?
MR. TUCKER;

Well, sulphur, of course, would be a

more toxic material and -they would not be allowed to allow
that to escape in the atmosphere.
Thank you.
