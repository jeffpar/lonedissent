P R 0 C E E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; We will hear arguments
next in 72-1371, Alexander against Americans United.
Mr. Crampton, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT P. CRAMPTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CRAMPTON;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
The proceedings before Your Honor is on a writ of
certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit.
While taxes are involved, the basic issue is a
procedural one, namely, do the Anti-Injunction Act and the
Declaratory Judgment Act prevent the maintenance of this
action for injunctive relief?
This, in turn, requires consideration of the
structure which Congress has provided for the litigation of
tax controversies, namely, proceedings through the Tax Court
and then on appeal, or, first, payment of the tax and then a
refund sued either in the District Court or in the Court of
Claims.
This tax procedure is expressly protected, as we
view it, by the Anti-Injunction Act and the Declaratory
Judgment Act.
I realize that when you’re in a position of deferring

4
judicial consideration of certain questions, that is not a
popular position to take? but it seems to us it’s required by
the laws and by the need of the United States to protect its
revenue.
The case is before the Court on a complaint and a
motion to dismiss.

The motion to dismiss was sustained by

the District Court and then reversed in part by the Circuit
Court.
The respondents, Americans United, is a non-profit,
educational corporation organised in 1948 under the laws of
the District of Columbia.

Its purpose, as stated in its

charter, is to defend and maintain religious liberty in the
United States by the dissemination of knowledge concerning
the constitutional principle of the separation of church and
s bate.
In 1950, Americans United asked the Internal
Revenue Service for a determination that it was exempt from
tax under comparable provisions to what is now effective in
the Internal Revenue Code as Section 501(c)(3),
The Revenue Act of 1954, in three sections, provides
for charitable deductible gifts*

One is 501(c) (3), and then

the actual deductions allowed in 170(c)(2), and in 2055(a)(2),
the latter being the estate tax cases.
Each of these provisions limits a charitable
deductible gift to an organization, and I'm quoting, no

5
substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on
propaganda or otherwise attempting to influence legislation.
With minor exceptions, no deduction is allowed to
taxpayers for political contributions, and it seems to us
that this quoted provision on the exempt organization simply
carries out this general policy.
It may help the Court to know the procedure that is
followed in these cases.
An organization claiming to be exempt files with
the Internal Revenue Service a Treasury Department Form 1023,
which discloses considerable information about its organiza­
tion, that is its form and the pertinent documents, whether
it’s a successor to another corporation, a description of its
activities, any financial information that it may have,
or financial information of its predecessor; and it must show
that there will be no return of assets to the organizers.
A sort of built-in cy-pres principle.
If there are any problems arising after this is
filed, as far as the Internal Revenue is concerned, there is
an opportunity for conference, and the Internal Revenue
Service is quite willing to discuss the situation with the
organization, tell them in what particulars they do not
believe it complies, and ultimately they frequently have
generally worked the situation out.
If the Internal Revenue Service is satisfied, it

6
issues a ruling letter to the exempt organization, saying
that it finds that it has qualified under the statute.
The Internal Revenue Service, of course, reserves
the right to look at the operation and the function of the
organization in later years, to see that it is operating as
it represented it would and, furthermore, that there's been
no change in the situation that might require a further
review of the matter.
This Court some years ago had a situation in the
American Automobile Association cases, where there was a
revocation of a ruling that had been outstanding.
As far as exempt organizations are concerned,
there were 13,000 of these ruling letters issued in the
last fiscal year.
QUESTION:

If there is that number of exempt

organizations, how is it possible for the Service to keep
track of what each one does from year to year and, as you
point out, sometimes withdraw the exemption?

Is that — do

informers bring this to your attention, or what?
MR, CRAMP TON:

I don't -— I imagine some of it

may be brought to our attention by other people bringing
actions to withdraw the tax-exempt status. We have a number
of those cases.

And, of course, I suppose informers do

question.
This is one of our complaints with procedure is

7
that I think outsiders use the Internal Revenue provisions
as sort of a club to accomplish a purpose, if they disagree
with them.
And, to a certain extent, the Service does, from
time to time, examine these,

I suppose they have the same

problem in determining —
QUESTION: Annual reports are not required, are
they?

As to the effect that the organization is continuing

to be just what it was when it got its exemption, or
anything like that?
MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

I don’t believe so.

I don't think so.

MR. CRAMPTON:

Are there?

I don't think they require any

reaffirmation of that.
QUESTION:

Is it still true that many listed aren't

even in existence any more?
MR. CRAMPTON: That could very well be.

There are ~

that's ray next point —* there are 120,000 of these
organizations listed, and when you do put an organization
on the list of, cumulative list of organizations exempt from
tax; donors may rely on that list and make a contribution
to that organization, with the complete knowledge that the
Internal Revenue Service will not challenge the deduction.
And that's why it's so important.
QUESTION:

I suppose, even though these numbers are

8

rather formidable, that the fact is that only a small,
relatively small, percentage of this 120,000 are organiza­
tions having significant amounts of money, and spending
significant amounts of money?
MR. CRAMPTON:

Oh, I'm not so sure, Your Honor,

Some of these are churches, and you take some of the main
churches, they have tremendous budgets.
QUESTION: Well, excluding churches, for the moment.
MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

Well, Red Cross might be one.

The Red Cross has a great deal of money.

MR. CRAMPTON: Yes.
QUESTION:

I am just wondering, groping for whether

this is a problem, obviously you couldn't conduct visitation
of 120,000 or even 20,000, but you can keep a pretty close
idea of what — you can have a pretty close idea of what the
large organizations are doing.

Because if they're doing a

lot of the forbidden activity, that becomes quite visible.
MR. CRAMPTON:

I think that's true.

And I think

on the larger organizations, they would, just like in
auditing the income tax returns, they are people that *—
QUESTION;

But Red Cross is under Congress, isn't

it, under a congressional Act?

Is it different from the

others ?
MR. CRAMPTON:
about that, Your Honor.

I'm not certain — I'm not certain
I just mentioned it as an organize-

9
tion that came to mind, having a substantial budget.
QUESTION;

But you don't have a great deal of

concern about whether local parish churches are conducting
lobbying activities, do you?
MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION;

No.

Individually.

MR. CRAMPTON;

No.

QUESTION; The problem is, in other words,
concentrated in a relatively few of the total of 120,000.
By that I mean maybe 10 or 15 or 20 thousand, if that's
relatively few of the total.
MR. CRAMPTON;

Well, I think our problem with the

lobbying is relatively small in the exempt organization
sphere.

I would agree with Your Honor on that.
I might point out that this advance-ruling

procedure that I've just been discussing, in our view, I
think is unique in the United States.

It originally

developed without any statutory sanction.

It was an aid

to the Service, it was an aid to the taxpayers, and a
convenience for all.
But because the Service has been doing that, it
doesn't seem to us that it alters the litigation process.
Now, in 1968, the Internal Revenue Service did
take a look at American United.
and revoked its prior letter.

It reconsidered the situation,

10

In doing so, it set forth a number of respondents'
substantial political activities and advised Americans
United in part that by engaging in general legislative
activities to implement your views, and by urging the
enactment or defeat of proposed legislation which you believe
inimicable to your principles, you have ceased to function
exclusively in the educator's role of informant, and thereby
encroaching upon the proscribed legislative area.
The Internal Revenue Service concluded that the
respondent was an action organization and not entitled to
an exempt status under 501(c)(3) and the regulations there­
under, and that therefore contribution to it would no longer
be recognized as deductible.
Shortly thereafter, the Internal Revenue Service
did rule that the respondent was an exempt under 501(c) (4)
as a social welfare organization.

So it, as an organization,

owes no taxes.
But this did not affect the contributions to it.
It did not entitle its donors to the charitable deduction.
And the exemption under 501(c)(4) also required
Americans United to pay employment taxes.
In July of 1970, the respondents brought this class
action on behalf of Americans United, two individuals, and
all other federal taxpayers similarly situated.

It was

brought against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

It

11
asked for a three-judge statutory court, a declaratory
judgment and an injunction, and alleging that the exemption
clauses of section 501(c)(3) are unconstitutional under the
First and Fifth Amendments.
The heart of the complaint, as we view it, was the
prayer to enjoin the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from
enforcing the provisions of section 170(c) and 501(c)(3).
Respondent asserts in its brief that the main
thrust of the revocation here is undeniably the imposition
of a significant burden on respondent’s fund-raising
capabilities.

We think that depends on how you look at it.

There's no doubt that it did increase the burden, but it
seems to us that the main thrust of this lawsuit is to
prevent — of the Commissioner's action is to prevent the
use of tax-deductible dollars for lobbying, which Congress has
proscribed.
The complaint speaks of depriving Americans United
of contributions.

The actual effect, however, would be to

prevent the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from assessing
taxes against individuals, corporations, and the state who
would be making contributions to Americans United after the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue had determined that it
no longer qualified.
It is primarily this obstruction of the authority
of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue the government believes

12

is barred by the Acts of Congress.
The government filed a motion to dismiss in the
District Court. This was granted. The lower court relying
on the Anti-Injunction Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act.
The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed as to
Americans United, but significantly it affirmed as to the
two individuals.
The result, it seems to us, is to permit the
litigants to have accomplished, indirectly, what the lower
court said they could not do directly.
Stated another way, the donors as individuals
could not enjoin the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, but
the donors, by using the so-called tax-exempt organization
as a party, have, under the holding of the lower court,
accomplished the same result.
I think it might help —
QUESTION;

And the result is that the Commissioner

could not question the deductibility of contributions made
by donors to this institution; is that it?
MR. CRAMPTON: Well, the result under the holding
of the lower court would be that the injunction should —
the case was referred for a consideration of whether or not
the injunction should be granted.
QUESTION; Right.
MR. CRAMPTON;

Now, this would open it up for a

13

hearing on the merits, I think, and the court said it was
not expressing an opinion on it.
But we think that procedurally there was no ground
for an injunction here, because of the provisions of the
statute.
QUESTION:

But you said a little earlier what the

practical effect would be upon the Commissioner, and I wanted
to be sure.

But the —

MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

Well, the practical effect —

— practical effect would be that he

could not question the deductibility of contributions made
to this organisation, so long

during the pendency of this

injunction; is that it?
MR. CRAMPTON: That's right.

That would be the

effect of it,
QUESTION:

Has the Service, Mr, Crampton, in

effect, conceded irreparable injury to Americans United?
MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

No.

We don't —

You think — you have not?

MR. CRAMPTON:

No, we're not conceding that.

QUESTION: And yet they're deprived, or they would
be under your theory, for a substantial period of time, of
donations?
MR. CRAMPTON:

No, they're not deprived.

deprived of tax-deductible donations.

They're

14
QUESTION;

That's precisely — and the donations

are going to dry up, are they not?
MR- CRAMP TON; Well, that depends on — I think on
the attitude of the donors.

As far as the small donations

are concerned, I think many people that give ten dollars to
the college don't care whether or not it's deductible or not,
because they're using the standard deduction.
The large donors, if they really are back of an
organization like this, would probably defer making the gift
until such time as this was decided, if the tax deduction
was an important factor to them.
But we think there's an additional burden here,
but we don't think that's any more of an irreparable injury
than are many other situations where parties are forced to
pay taxes and then litigate, or await a decision of a
question of law or fact or something.
QUESTION;

They did allege that.

They did allege

that it would be ~
MR. CRAMPTON;
QUESTION;

Yes,

— difficult and would practically put

them out of business.
MR. CRAMPTON: They did.
QUESTION; And that's — aren't we obliged, at this
stage of the proceeding, to recognize that?
All they want is a hearing and an attempt to prove

15
it.
MR. CRAMP TON ;

That’s right.

But what they want

is an injunction in the interim. And we think that they're
not entitled to that under the Anti”Injunction Act.
QUESTION: Well, what do you have to offer that
they will not be irreparably harmed, except your imagination?
MR. CRAMPTON; Well, I think that — I'm not saying
that there won't be harm, but I don't think it's irreparable.
I think that •—
QUESTION;

Suppose they were?

MR» CRAMPTON; Well, that comes right back to the
Williams Packing case.

The Williams Packing case enforced

the injunction, even though there they said it would put
them in bankruptcy.
QUESTION; Well, what's the purpose of the statute,
then, I mean —
MR. CRAMPTON;

I think the purpose of the statute

is just that, and «—
QUESTION;

Because, I mean, otherwise there's no

need to bar an injunction unless there's irreparable injury.
MR. CRAMPTON: That's right.
But
QUESTION;

But the real problem is that you say

it's an injunction against taxes, and they say it's an
injunction against their organization, being able to operate.

16
And I recognize, I don't know which way I come
out, but I think there is a little difference there.
MR. CRAMPTON;

Well, there is a difference if you

— you can look at the organization, but I think when you
look, take it one step further, you are -QUESTION: When were you given these tax
deductions?

It was long after the Anti-Injunction statute,

wasn't it?
MR. CRAMPTON;

I'm not sure I understand Your

Honor's question.
QUESTION; Well, does the Anti-Injunction statute
apply to tax-exempt corporations is the question, I think.
You say it does ? they say it does not.
MR. CRAMP TON; We say it does, yes.
QUESTION; They say it does not.
MR. CRAMPTON;

I think that's right, yes.

QUESTION; Well, No. 1, the charitable organization
exemption came later, so clearly it wasn't covered, wasn't
intended to at that time.
MR. CRAMPTON; That’s right.
But the —
QUESTION; And the relief here is no relief which
says that you can't collect taxes, is it?
MR. CRAMPTON;

Oh, yes.

The action right here

says that he can't collect from the donors.

And it could

17
very -QUESTION:

I thought the donors were left out of

there.
MR* CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

Mo, the two donors are —

I thought the Court of Appeals left

the donors out.
MR. CRAMPTON: That's right.

It did.

QUESTION: Well, that's what I'm talking about.
What we have now is the organization
MR. CRAMPTON:

and not the donors.

Well, yes and no, Your Honor.

If the donors — if the Commissioner is enjoined from
enforcing the provisions of the statute, he can't go after
the donors.
QUESTION: That's right.
QUESTION: Furthermore, he couldn't collect certain
kinds of taxes from the organization itself.
MR. CRAMPTON:

That's right.

Federal employment

taxes -QUESTION:

Federal employment taxes —

MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

-- we say that they —

If the Commissioner's action stands,

you can collect federal employment taxes.
MR. CRAMPTON: That's right.
QUESTION:

And we are.

If the injunction stands, you cannot.

MR. CRAMPTON; That's right.

18
That’s the way I see it.
QUESTION:

From the organization itself.

HR. CRAMPTON: From the organization itself,
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

HR, CRAMPTON:

Now, the Anti-Injunction Act, as

Your Honor suggested, came in a long time ago, 1867, but the
significant thing, as we see it, is that this was reaffirmed
by Congress when it reenacted the Revenue Code, or when it
enacted the Revenue Code of 1954.
And the only exception to the Anti-Injunction Act,
that we believe is pertinent, is the one this Court announced
in the Enochs^ vs._ Williams Packing Company case, where the
taxpayer alleged it would go into bankruptcy, and the Court
said, well, still the statute had to be enforced, unless
the taxpayer could show that under no circumstances could
the government prevail; and, second, that equity jurisdiction
exists because of irreparable injury, for which there was
no adequate legal remedy.
The second statute — I've been talking so far
primarily about the Anti-Injunction Act, but we also rely
equally on the Declaratory Judgment Act.

And this Court

may recall that that was originally passed in the early
1930's and was silent as

to taxes.

There were several attempts made shortly thereafter
to apply that statute to taxes, and Congress, in 1935,

19
promptly amended the Act to provide that it should not
apply to any suit with respect to federal taxes.

And it

seems to us that this is again a congressional affirmance
of the Anti-Injunction Act.

At least the philosophy that

you can't enjoin taxes.
The legislative history of this amendment shows
clearly that Congress thought the existing remedies provided
— existing procedures provided ample remedies for the
correction of tax errors.
The basic complaint of the respondent is that the
action of the Internal Revenue Service has materially
deterred its contributors, and I think this is true, as I've
mentioned, but I think the same could be said for the failure
of the Internal Revenue to issue the ruling in the first
place.
But

where there is a factual or a legal controversy,

the statutes just do not give a tax-exempt status pendente lite,
and we believe it should not be the role of the courts to
provide one.
The administration of the tax laws has been
delegated to the Treasury and to the Internal Revenue Service,
and if the Internal Revenue Code is to be administered by
injunction, it seems to us that nothing but chaos is going
to be the end result.
QUESTION:

Yes, but chaos hasn't resulted, has it,

20

from the Williams Packing Company case?
MR, CRAMPTON;

No,

And we think we can move with

the Williams Packing Company case.

You see, those two tests

are not the ones they're meeting here.
And my thought, continuing my thought of chaos is
we have 400-some district judges and a number of suits now
pending where the — which request the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue to reserve,

to remove the tax exemption

of such organizations as labor unions, fraternal clubs, and
hospitals.
It's quite conceivable that some organization,
which is opposing the views of the Americans United, would
bring a similar suit.

This might result in conflicting

injunctions in different jurisdictions, and complete
confusion, as we see it.
In our reply brief we've cited two of these cases,
one is the Cattle Feeders case out in Oklahoma, in which the
— enjoins the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from applying
a ruling that the Internal Revenue Service was to promulgate
regarding year-end purchases of feed, where, in the view
of the Internal Revenue Service, it distorted income.
The Internal Revenue Service has also been ordered
to revoke the exemption of a hospital, where it did not
admit indigent patients.
It seems to us that the latter case is another

21
example of the use of the tax laws and the injunction
procedure as a club in what is primarily a fight between
private parties.
It's our view that the administration of the tax
laws should not be by injunction, and that if the Internal
Revenue Service is wrong in its determination regarding
Americans United, there are two adequate remedies at law.
The first, as Mr. Justice White suggested, is a
suit against — by the organization itself to recover the
employment taxes that it's been forced to pay.

In such a

proceeding it can come in, claim it's exempt under section
501(c)(3), and argue the merits of that position.
A second proceeding would be the suit by what the
briefs refer to as a friendly donor.

Usually that's a

secretary or somebody with a relatively simple return,
perhaps on the W-2 form.

They make a contribution to an

organization such as this, file a claim for refund, and then
litigate it.
And that is a decision on the merits.

It's a

device that's frequently used by corporations to test
taxability of dividends.
QUESTION:

Of course your opponents contend that

if it's a very small donor, the Service has, on occasion,
simply made the refund and mooted the issue on the merits.
MR. CRAMPTON: That allegation is made, and I think

22
they do refer to a Church of Scientology case, and that case,
in our view, was not in point*

That was a question whether

in that year money inured to organizers.

And there was

discovery proceeding, as I understand it.

They were

convinced that it did not inure in that year, and they made
them a refund and mooted it out.
But I believe the Service would welcome a chance to
test this on the merits, and certainly, in so far as those
of us who are presently in the Department of Justice are
concerned, we think this is the way to meet the situation,
and I have told a number of tax-exempt organizations that
as far as I personally was concerned, we'll meet them in
court any time on this fact question and get it decided.
And I think the Internal Revenue Service shares
that view, and they would honor a finding like that.
Assuming, of course, that the operation is conducted the
same way in successive years.
The respondent speaks of itself as being the
principal party, but it seems to us here, in legal effect,
it is acting as agent for its contributors.

They are also

real parties in interest, and, as has been pointed out, the
injunction would prevent the Internal Revenue Service from
asserting taxes against the donors; in the meantime, the
statute of limitations may run.

It seems to us that the

declaratory judgment is an independent reaffirmation of the

23
Anti-Injunction case, and that both of these simply bar
the present type of enaction.
QUESTION;

Does the government take the position

that the Anti-Injunction Act has the same impact as 28 USC
2201?
MR. CRAMPTON;
QUESTION;

On declaratory judgment?

MR. CRAMPTON;
QUESTION;

Yes.

Yes,

We say we —

You don't think the prohibition against

declaratory judgments is any broader or any narrower than
the prohibition against injunctions?
MR. CRAMPTON; Well, no, I think that the
Declaratory Judgment Act v/ould probably be a little bit
broader, because when you use the phrase with respect to
tii at —
QUESTION;

I want to know what the government's

position is with respect to that.
MR. CRAMPTON;
more recent enactment.

I think it's broader.

And it's a

It mentions the —

QUESTION; Well, don't you have to have, in effect,
a declaratory judgment before you can have an injunction?
MR. CRAMPTON;

Well, I hadn't thought about that,

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Of course, there are quite a number of

injunctions entered, with no declaratory judgment in the

24

traditional sense, aren't there?
QUESTION;

But there has to be some legal basis,

some legal basis for the injunction.

I mean, some right to

the injunction.
MR. CRAMPTON;

I would think you could have an

injunction and then your declaratory judgment might not be —
QUESTION;

Well, you may not have something —

MR. CRAMPTON;
QUESTION;

—■ and that puts the same *—

Well, you may not have something

called a declaratory judgment, let's say.
MR* CRAMPTON;
QUESTION;

Yes.

Well, suppose when a permanent

injunction is entered, the court has declared something,
but it isn't what we think of as a declaratory judgment
case.
MR. CRAMPTON;

No.

I think that the concepts,

at least in my thinking, are somewhat different, and I come
back with Mr. Justice White's point, I think the Declaratory
Judgment statute is even broader than the Anti-Injunction Act.
I'd like -QUESTION;

I gather the basis of the Court of

Appeals, the decision below, I gather also in the next case,
the court in that case, was that really neither a declaratory
judgment nor any restraint against the collection of taxes
is being sought, but that we have to read these proceedings

25
as an attack upon the constitutionality of the substantiality
exception,, and an injunction against its enforcement. But
that such an injunction involves neither a declaratory
judgment, under the Declaratory Judgment Act, nor an
injunction within 74, whatever that —- isn't that what they
— that's in effect what they held, isn't it?
Do I read the opinion —
MR» CRAMPTON: Well, I'm not quite sure —
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

MR. CRAMPTON:

I had trouble just reading how they

were getting around those, myself; but that —
QUESTION: But surely I'm right, that they tried to
get around both?
MR. CRAMPTON:
QUESTION:

Yes»

Yes.

And you say that this was neither.

MR. CRAMPTON:

That's right.

QUESTION: Didn't they?
MR. CRAMPTON:

Yes.

QUESTION: And I gather that's — isn't that the
rather narrow question that we have to decide?
MR. CRAMPTON:

Well, I think the — yes, whether

the —

MR, CRAMPTON;

Because I think what the court has

tried to construct is sort of a detour around these two
statutes,

I would like to touch briefly

on this question that he raises of substantial.

QUESTION:

Mr, Crampton, what's your interpretation

of how the Court of Appeals, finding that the government at
least had an arguable case on the merits, how did they get
around the Williams ^Paoking statement that only if the

27

government clearly can't prevail ought an injunction be
allowed?
I don't mean what's the government's position, but
what's your interpretation of what the Court of Appeals did?
MR» CRAMPTONs

That, in my judgment, is a rough

question, because I read that thing and I've tried to see
where he came out on it, and I've had difficulty.
He simply seemed to think that this was a question
that ought to be — raised a constitutional point and
perhaps because there was an allegation of constitutional
issues this shouldn't be —
QUESTION: But many of our cases have held the fact
that constitutional question is raised doesn't affect the
applicability of the Anti-Injunction Act,

QUESTION:

It's really their burden.

MR. CRAM?TON:
QUESTION:

I think so.

But I gather on the substantiality

point, in a practical world it is true, isn't it, that
organizations opposed to the point of view of this one,
not by reason of their greater means and so forth, are not
devoting a substantial part of their time and effort to
lobbying, but it may be it's not a substantial part, but,
in the aggregate, it's a much greater part —
MR. CRAMPTON: That's true.
QUESTION:

-- than what this organization does.

MR. CRAMPTON: And you wonder what the test might
be.

If you put a dollar amount in, then an organization

under the dollar amount might devote a hundred percent to
it, whereas a bigger organization would be only devoting a
fraction. And it seems to us that this is about the best
test Congress could devise.
I might close ~ I'm concerned about my time, I
haven't seen the light

but we'd like to say that while

we're not unsympathetic with the problem Americans United
has, we bdieve the solution is in legislation.

We believe

that solution is coming.
Their judicial review of this type of a problem is
presently being considered in the field of pension plans.
In H, R. 4200, 93rd Congress, First Session, in section 601

29
they are providing for — it is proposed to provide for an
appeal to the Tax Court from rulings in the pension field.
I understand this Act has passed both houses and
is in conference, but not on this point»
The section — a committee of the section on
taxation is considering a similar —
QUESTION; Would that affect this?
MR. CRAMPTON;

It wouldn't affect this case, no,

but it will affect future — if this is enacted it would,
in effect, exempt organizations.
But a committee of the section on taxation of
the American Bar Association is presently considering whether
a similar recommendation should be made in the field of
exempt organizations.

That isn't cited in our brief, but

you can find a reference to that in 26 of The Tax Lawyer,
at page 628.
It seems to us that it's clearly the scope — that
tiie scope of this legislation is to be determined by
Congress, and we submit that that's where the relief, if any,
should be, and not by seeking a judicial remedy here, which,
in our view, the statutes just do not provide.
We believe the judgment should be reversed,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN B. MORRISON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MORRISON:

Thank Your Honor,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
Americans United is before this Court today
largely because of decisions made by the Internal Revenue
Service relating to the administration of the Internal
Revenue Code's provision regarding charities.
The Service has decided to administer these
provisions by a system of advance rulings.

Now, this

system is unique to the Internal Revenue Service under the
charitable area and does not apply with near the force in
this area as it does in other areas

where rulings are issued.

The result of this decision by the Service is that
a ruling that an organization is tax-exempt is not merely
useful, but it's essential.

The ruling has become the

sine qua non of effective fund raising for a charitable

31
organization.

And the denial of a ruling, or tie revocation

of a ruling requires immediate action on behalf of the
charity if it is to continue without serious financial
difficulties.
As Mr. Crampton explained, there are two aspects
of a charitable ruling.
from income taxation.

First, that the charity is exempt
This is relatively unimportant for the

small organization; but to a large university, with a
significant endowment, the exemption from income taxation
can be important.
But the second feature and by far the more
important, because it is essential to all kinds of
charities, is that donations are deductible from the income
of the donor; and particularly from the income tax of the
donor with a large income.
The question of whether or not an organization
qualifies under section 501(c)(3)

is ultimately one for the

courts to decide, under the test laid down by the Congress»
Nov/, the Service could have decided to administer
these provisions without a system of advance rulings.
Income tax matters would be handled like other income tax
matters.

Deductions could have depended upon opinions of

counsel for either the charity or for the donor.
But the Service decided long ago that a system of
issuing advance rulings would be useful, both to the Service

32
and to the taxpayers, to let everyone know where they stand.
And they have been issuing these rulings for years.
In fact, in 1969, in the Tax Reform Act, the
Congress enacted a new section, section 508, which requires
any organization seeking 501(c)(3) status to notify the
Service in advance that they are going to claim that they are
exempt, so the Service can begin considering the question.
In addition to the issuance of rulings, the Service
has also prepared a document known as the cumulative list of
exempt organizations.

Once an organization has a ruling that

it is exempt under 501(c) (3), its name is added to the list,
and the Service no longer can challenge the deductibility
of gifts added to that for an organization on that list.
If the organization is not on that list, it creates
enormous fund-raising problems, particularly with regard to
the large donors, for there are, after all, a limited number
of funds available, and the absence of the name of an
organization from that list puts that organization at a
serious competitive disadvantage in seeking to attract funds.
In effect, the ruling is a license to operate
seriously in the fund-raising area.
As the courts below — the court below here, the
court in Bob Rories , and as former Commissioner Thrower
indicated, these are very serious matters.

And thus, when

Americans United had its 501(c)(3) status revoked in 1969,

33

it caused serious financial problems.
Nov/, it was still, and is today still exempt from
income taxation under section 501(c)(4); therefore, it pays
no income taxes, it can't go to the Tax Court or seek a claim
for refund on the income taxes.
The only other tax consequence to Americans United
itself, as a result of the ruling revocation, was a requirement
that it begin to pay unemployment taxes, commonly referred to
as FUTA, which, in the four years between the revocation and
today, has never amounted to more than $1200.

A really

trifling amount, when considered in the light of the real
consequences which is the lost contribution.
In fact, these FUTA taxes are so small that Americans
United has paid those taxes and will continue to pay those
taxes through the end of this case, however long it takes,
because that's not really what we're concerned about here.
The prayer for relief specifically says ~~ the
complaint specifically says we are not seeking to enjoin any
taxes payable by —
QUESTION:

What if you sued for a refund of the ones

you've paid?
MR. MORRISON:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

QUESTION: What if you sued for a refund of your
FUTA taxes?
MR. MORRISON: We could do that, Your Honor.

I may --

34
QUESTION:

When you could raise this fair issue.

MR. MORRISON:

Your Honor, it could have been done.

First, let me say, the notion that we could raise this was
not suggested by anyone until the reply brief stated —
QUESTION: Well, whether that’s so or not, is it so?
MR. MORRISON: The refund suit could have been brought,
Your Honor.

But it is fraught with difficulties.

QUESTION: Then you could have raised this fair
issue as to whether or not your FUTA taxes were validly
collected or —
MR. MORRISON: That is correct, Your Honor.
The legal issue is, in most cases, the same as the
deductibility issue.

In most cases I said.

But it is a

remedy which is uncertain, albeit not for Americans United,
perhaps, but for a number of other organizations which are
in the very similar position.
First, because, Your Honor, there are exemptions
from FUTA tax.

It does not apply to any organization which

does not have $1500 a year in wages paid.

There are other

exemptions for small organizations.
QUESTION:

But if those,uMri;Morrison, apply to

other organizations but not to Americans United, how does that
bear on the adequacy of Americans United's remedy at law?
MR. MORRISON:

Well, we first say, Your Honor, that

we're asking this Court to establish an exception to the Anti-

35
Injunction Act, to construe it as nonapp 1 icable in a series of
cases.
We believe it would be counterproductive for the
Court to establish rules depending upon the peculiarities of
otherwise very similar organizations.

But, moreover, beyond

that, Your Honor, our real problem is not whether the remedy
is available, but whether the remedy is truly adequate.
For the refund suit's biggest problem, as is the suit
by a donor, is that it does nothing to stop the Service from
continuing the position —
QUESTION;

But the trouble is that that's the very

purpose of the Anti-Injunction statute, is to put off, to
refund suits, the decisions of questions like these.
MR. MORRISON:

Your Honor, in 1876, this Court, in

the State Railroad Tax Cases, referred to the Anti-Injunction
Act in connection with the refund provision as a complete
system of corrective justice.

And in those days, where the

only questions involved were the questions of "would the
taxpayer get back the taxes plus interest that he paid", it
was a complete system.
And as in Williams Packing, it was a complete system
of corrective justice, for the only thing anybody was seeking
a refund on is the taxes that were paid.

Those taxes in this

case are irrelevant.
QUESTION: Well, what if ■— don't you think that the

36

absence of any alternative remedy was an important part of
■the Court of Appeals decision?
MR. MORRISON:

Your Honor, the Court of Appeals did

place great emphasis upon that.
QUESTION:

I don't know what it would have done if

the issue had been before it about the FUTA taxes.
MR. MORRISON:

It was before it, Your Honor, —

QUESTION: Was it?
MR. MORRISON:

as being so •—

MR. MORRISON:

stream of the litigation as not to be ~
QUESTION: Well, that's rather odd, isn't it?

I

mean, isn't it, because you could have had that decision -you could have had this very issue decided in the refund
action.
MR. MORRISON:

Your Honor, I believe Americans

United probably could have.

On the assumption that, first,

it was not mooted out — and we take a different view of the
Scientology case,
QUESTION;

we don't think there's any —•

issue hadn't been -— wasn't raised until —.
MR. MORRISON:

government in its, in the second reply brief in the Court of

37

Appeals.
QUESTION:

In the Court of Appeals.

HR. MORRISON:

In the Court of Appeals, yes, Your

Honor»
QUESTION: Right,
MR. MORRISON: But not in the District Court.

And

that was some three and a half years after the ruling was
revoked.
QUESTION:

Is this question involved in this case,

did Bob Jones University also have available a refund?
MR. MORRISON:

I believe it did, yes, Your Honor.

And I believe there's also a possibility — I'm not
thoroughly familiar with the record, but as I read the
government's brief, it's alleged that Bob Jones may have some
income tax liability, since it was held not to be a (c)(4)
organization, as was our organization.
QUESTION:

Mr. Morrison, you said your exception,

you came under — you wanted us to establish an exception
to the Anti-Injunction statute.
MR. MORRISON:

Yes, Your Honor.

If that's what I

said, it wasn't precisely what I meant.
Although the Anti-Injunction statute is absolute
on its face, with certain specific exceptions, largely
relating to the Tax Court proceedings, —
QUESTION: Well, maybe I ought to warn you? the

38

answer I'd like to get is how we do it without rewriting the
statute?
MR. MORRISON: The same way that this Court has been
doing it for fifty years without rewriting the statute,
Your Honor, —■
QUESTION:

In v/hich case did we rewrite the Anti-

Injunction statute?
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Which one?

MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Well, begin —

The Standard —

Let's start over again.

MR. MORRISON:

The Standard Nut Margarine case,

Lipke vs. Lederer, Hill vs. Wallace, and the case we rely
upon most, Allen v. Regents of Georgia case.
QUESTION:

Now, how do you want us to do this one?

MR. MORRISON:

We want you to say, Your Honor,

that it is outside the purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act,
since, as Your Honor quite correctly pointed out earlier,
Congress obviously did not have charitable organizations in
rmind in 1867 when it wrote this provision.
QUESTION: They didn't have automobiles in mind,
either.
MR. MORRISON:

No, sir, Your Honor,

It didn't

have a great many tilings in mind.
QUESTION; But it did have taxes in mind, didn't it?

39
MR, MORRISON;

It did, Your Honor,

QUESTION; And this has quite an impact on taxes.
MR. MORRISON:
have quite an impact.

Your Honor, I don't believe it does
For, in our view, most donors, and

particularly large donors who are considering making a
sizable gift to a charitable organization, if the organization
is not on the list, as Americans United has not been, most of
these, or many of these persons will simply deflect the
contribution to another organization which is on the list.
QUESTION; Well, I think all of us, every one on this
bench, has had that experience as a lawyer.

But that's not

the heart of the case, is it?
Or do you think it is?
MR. MORRISON:

Well, it is important because we

think it's indicative of the fact that this case is not
dealing primarily with the orderly process of the collection
of revenue, as has been true in other cases.

And as the

government's brief says, and as the Supreme Court has said
in Enochs, the manifest purpose is to insure the orderly
process of the collection of revenue.
And we suggest that this is far from the main­
stream of that kind of problem.

And it's particularly

important because of the great need that this taxpayer has
to have his ruling.
And of equal importance is the fact that not only

40
does it not have its ruling during this period of time, but
that throughout the entire period of the refund litigation
there will be no revenue coming in, because of the loss of
the ruling.
Ai*d this is important, because even if we win the
refund suit at the District Court level, after having waited
ion til the end of the year so that an annual tax could be paid,
waited till we file a claim for refund, waiting six months
after that, thereafter filing a complaint, the government
answering sixty days later, discovery beginning, and perhaps
the government discovering an issue in the case that will
enable it to prevail for reasons other than the reason that
was given for the denial of deduction.
That after that happens, and even if we win the case
in the District Court, the ruling does not come back yet.
For, according to the government's theory, that even where
the refund suit is won there is still no right to have the
ruling restored.
QUESTION:

How do you yjjew.ufche section in the

exclusion rather than the Declaratory Judgment Act?
MR. MORRISON:

I view that as coterminous, Your

Honor.
QUESTION: Coterminous?
MR. MORRISON;
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

It was enacted —

In language it certainly seems broader,

41
doesn't it?
MR. MORRISONs

It does seem broader, Your Honor,

but it was enacted specifically to fill a loophole that had
been created when some of the courts had started to permit
declaratory judgments to do that which the Anti-Injunction
Act could not do.

And it was intended specifically for that

purpose, and with no other purpose in mind.
QUESTION:

I guess you have to take that position,

don't you, because, with respect to taxes, that's the word,
isn't it?
MR. MORRISON:

It would be very much broader.

I would point out, Your Honor, that section 1340,
the jurisdictional section, uses the phrase, giving the
district courts jurisdiction, "to matters arising under the
Tax law", which might even seem broader..
But I think that all the courts have considered
them to be in the same general area.

It was enacted, that is

the exception to the Declaratory Judgment Act was enacted, to
fill a specific need, to prevent the end run, if you will,
around the Anti-Injunction action; and therefore we consider
it to be the same.
QUESTION:

Have there been any judicial constructions

of it to that effect?
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

In this Court?

42
MR* MORRISONs

Not in this Court, no. Your Honor*

There are certain cases referred to *—
QUESTION: The government apparently thinks that
it's broader, it doesn't concede that it's coterminous with
the
MR„ MORRISON: That's right, Your Honor.
We have ■— the legislative history we quote, I
believe it's in footnote ~ it's in a footnote in our brief

QUESTION: Well, that's all right; I'll get it.
MR. MORRISON: Footnote 5 on page 6, Your Honor.
And it makes references to Judge Tamm's discussion of the
legislative history in the Court of Appeals, and I think that
it does indicate that that is the case.
As I said, the real loss to Americans United in
this case is the lost contributions; and the refunding of
$1200 plus interest is not going to do anything about getting
that back.
We think that this case comes within this Court's
exception in Allen v. the Regents, where, in that case, the
plaintiff was, like this case, not the taxpayer; that is, not
the person against whom the taxes were sought to be collected.
And that in that case this Court held that where the plaintiff
had no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law — and I
emphasise the word "adequate” because that is, in our view,

43
the touchstone here? that the remedy suggested by the
government is not adequate.
That the court had jurisdiction, notwithstanding
the literal language of the Anti-Injunction Act.
We believe that that case applies here.
The government contends that Allen was overruled, in
effect, by Williams Packing Company? that Williams Packing is
a substitute for a whole long line of cases, which are not
discussed at all, and which, the Allen decision, is indicated
only as a "see also” footnote.
The decisions in Allen and Williams Packing are
irreconcilable, for one very important reasons
The Williams Packing decision predicates jurisdiction
upon a finding that under no view of the facts or law could
the government prevail.

But in Alien, not only could the

government not prevail, but in the very same opinion this
Court upheld the determination that the statute challenged
by the University of Georgia Regents was constitutional.
Therefore, the decisions are irreconcilable, and
the government must contend that Allen was overruled.
We see no reason to believe that this Court over­
ruled Allen.

The cases are different, the facts are

different, and we suggest that the decision in Allen v. the
Regents is still good law and supports this case, as do other
cases, such as Lipke v^Lederer, which dealt primarily with

44
the problem of a penalty being imposed in the form of a tax,
or cases involving essentially regulatory matters:

Hill v.

Wallace,
QUESTION:

Are you really saying that they're

irreconcilable or that they deal with two different things?
MR. MORRISON: Well, I say that they're irreconcilable
if the government statement that there is a substitute, that
Enochs was a substitute for all of the prior decisions, it
becomes irreconcilable.
But I believe that they are —■ that they really
deal with two different kinds of exceptions.

There are,

if you will, parallel different classes of exceptions; and
that the Allen case supports the decision we're asking this
Court to affirm here.
QUESTION:

If they are irreconcilable, I suppose

the latest in time would prevail.
MR, MORRISON: That is correct, Your Honor.
v/e believe — I misspoke, perhaps.

But

But they're irreconcilable

only if you accept the government's proposition that one is
a substitute for the other.
We believe they're not irreconcilable, and that
they simply dealt with different situations,
The Williams Packing case being the classic case of
a taxpayer seeking to enjoin the collection of its own
taxes, claiming, verifiably or not, that there was irreparable

45

This Court said no.

In that situation, irreparable

and the adequacy of remedy is not enough? you must show
And that's what 7421 says, and we agree one hundred

percent? but we don't think that deals with this case, where
there are different problems involved than in that situation.
All that we are seeking here is an opportunity to
litigate the question of whether or not our ruling was properly
revoked during the course of the litigation,
All we want is a chance to obtain an injunction, so
that we will not have to wait years until the refund suit is
concluded.

We are not, as the government suggests in its

reply brief, on page 38, asking for an automatic right to
retain the ruling regardless of the merits.
We are fully aware of the standards, both at the
preliminary injunction stage, and what we must do with the
merits in order to retain the ruling, which we have been
without for almost four years now.
But at least it's a chance, and it's a chance for
organization^ such as this, and, equally important, for
fledgling organizations which have no financial backing to
rely on.
Just recently a decision of the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia, in the case of
Center on Corporate Responsibility v. Shultz, a decision which

46

the government referred to in its initial brief in this case,
but did not refer to in its most recent brief.

An unreported

decision, but now appears in the 19 74 CC1I Reporter, at
paragraph 9110, where that court upheld the plaintiff and
held that the Service had illegally ruled that it was not
entitled to a deduction.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Morrison, it may

help you if I alert you, in the absence of our lights, that
you've got about two minutes left.
MR. MORRISON:

Thank Your Honor,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Before you impinge on

Mr, Salisbury's time.
MR. MORRISON:

Thank you. Your Honor.

In that very case, the Service contended that in
spite of the allegations of political influence and no basis
at all for denying deduction, the court had no jurisdiction
whatsoever.

And we submit that 7421 was not intended to

apply in those situations, that it was not intended to act
where there was no complete system of corrective justice.
We see no reason to apply the statute which was
obviously not intended to reach charitable organizations,
and there's every reason not to apply it.
Accordingly, we ask this Court to affirm the
decision below.
Thank you

HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Very well, Mr. Morrison.

Mr. Salisbury.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANKLIN C. SALISBURY, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SALISBURYs

May it please the Court, and Mr.

Chief Justice Burger;
As the former house counsel and litigation attorney
for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, I
appear before you to argue that the decision of the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia,
upholding the right of Americans United to its day in court,
was correct and should be upheld.
My share in the oral argument is to emphasize just
a few points which makes clear that the opinion of the Court
of Appeals below, which holds that this case does raise a
substantial constitutional question, should be upheld.
I fear that the Commissioner's counsel have misstated,
inadvertently, the legal question presented.
brief, they say;

Reading their

the question presented is, quote, "whether

the respondent is barred by the Anti-Injunction Act and the
Declaratory Judgment Act, or otherwise, from obtaining
injunctive or declaratory relief requiring the Commissioner
to issue a ruling that respondent is exempt under section
501(c)(3), and therefore that contributions to it are
deductible under Code Section 170(c)(2)."

48
Americans United has never argued that the
Commissioner should rule that it is exempt under 501(c)(3).
Americans United has sought to have the substantiality
clause of 501(c)(3) ruled unconstitutional, expunged, as it
were, from 501(c).
Thus directed, the Commissioner could and should
exercise his discretion and determine the eligibility of
Americans United for continuing treatment under 501(c)(3).
QUESTION?

Without the substantiality section, when

then would the Commissioner determine?
MR. SALISBURY;

The clause has many other

qualifications for -- 501(c)(3) says.

It is very complicated,

and we feel that we could qualify on all of them.
We can't qualify, and don't want to qualify,

if

it means we can't either come to this Court and present
cases or we can't go to Congress and say that, well, the
Constitution is great and we want it kept that way.
The existence
QUESTION;

Mr. Salisbury, while you're stopped for

a moment, let me -- it seems to me that at least at one
focal point in the Court of Appeals opinion is the statement
at the end, it's on page 40 of the Petition for the Writ,
"that the possibility of success is not so certain as to
merit the Enochs exception with respect to 7421(a), yet not
so frivolous or foreclosed as to merit denial of the 2282

49
motion."
I'm not exactly sure what that means, but do you
think it's a correct statement of the — of how the issue
should be resolved?
MR. SALISBURYs Well, in so far as it states that we
have — that, I think, means that we have a substantial
constitutional question involved.
QUESTION:

And ~ because —

It also suggests that the court

considered the matter in some state of judicial equipoise,
that it might go either way; isn't that about it?
MR. SALISBURY:
QUESTION:

Yes, I think it might go either way.

Well, but if it goes either«way,

doesn't the Anti-Injunction statute control?
MR. SALISBURY:

I think the case that held that

under no circumstances could the government prevail in a
lawsuit is not good law and not applicable to us.
anybody can prevail.

Because

It is not a good standard.

The Enochs case, the organization —QUESTION: Well, it was a standard that some judges
thought at the time was the way to implement the AntiInjunction statute, wasn't it?
MR. SALISBURY:

Yes.

I'm hoping the judges at

this time will not so feel.
QUESTION:
be overruled?

Well, what are you asking, that Enochs

50
MR. SALISBURY;

No.

In Enochs the organization

owed a tax.
Nov/, we agree that if Americans United owed a tax,
that we should have paid the tax and then gone into the Tax
Court and sued to have it refunded.

But we don’t have any

such tax owed.
Now, way at the end of the whole proceedings it
was suggested we could, in effect, deprive our employees of
their rights under the FUTA, the Unemployment Compensation
Act, sued to get the money back, and then go in and, not
argue about that, argue about our First Amendment rights.
QUESTION:

Well, had you paid that tax before this

episode?
MR. SALISBURY:

No, no.

We weren't —

QUESTION: Then you wouldn't be depriving them of
something you hadn't done before —
MR. SALISBURY:

From that day on, we've paid

their unemployment tax. And we would continue paying that
tax, even if we win this case, because that's a benefit to
our employees if — and they're likely to lose their jobs,
because of the impact of this ruling, and they need that
unemployment —■
QUESTION:

But you can't say there's no other

remedy available to you?
MR. SALISBURY: Well, it is — I think, if Your

51

Honors will consider the remedy, that we should not pay a
tax which we want to pay -*~
QUESTION:

Well, you didn’t used to.

MR. SALISBURY:
QUESTION:

No, but I don't think we were ~

Until the Commissioner forced you to

confer this benefit on your employees, you weren't.
MR. SALISBURY:

~ eligible for it.

I’m not quite certain, but I don’t think v/e were
eligible to pay it before.

Once we changed our status, then

our employees could obtain unemployment compensation under
this Act,
QUESTION: And if you win, if you win, therefore,
you won’t be eligible to pay it?
MR. SALISBURY: This could very well be true.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR.SALISBURY:

Now, the Commissioner of Internal

Revenue revoked the privilege of Americans United to continue
soliciting donors, who in turn could make their donations
out of pretax income; and the reason given is that Americans
United total activity is one of legislative effort.
If we file a brief amicus before this Court, which
we do quite — which we used to do, anyway, quite frequently,
they say it’s an attempt to influence legislation because we
take a. stand.
If we praise a great opinion, like Everson vs. the

52

Board of Education, it is, according to IRS, an attempt to
influence legislation because we favor the opinion»
If we republish James Madison’s Memorial and
Remonstrance, it is an attempt to influence legislation.
Everything we do, according to the letters we have from IRS,
is an attempt to influence legislation.
The result is a penalty for the exercise of our
First Amendment rights.

We remain tax-exempt — that’s not a

right, that's a privilege — but we are denied the support
of our donors, which is not a privilege but a right.
These donors are still free to make tax-exempt
donations to other charities

and other causes, but not to one

of the greatest causes of all, the preservation of the
principle of separation of church and state.

The cause dear

to our donors and a cause dear to the members of this Court.
It must be remembered also that in our argument
Americans United actually is arguing that no organization,
not even the Roman Catholic Church, with its unlimited
resources constantly used for lobbying, should be put to tine
test of the substantiality clause 501(c)(3).
QUESTION:

Mr. Salisbury, did I understand you to

say that the Internal Revenue Service takes the position
tliat an organization that files an amicus brief in this
Court is attempting to influence legislation?
MR. SALISBURY: As I read their revocation letters,

53
one of — we've had a whole series, of course, —
QUESTION: Well, the Court, of course, has been
accused of being a —- .
[Laughter.]
But that's a very interesting submission.
MR. SALISBURY:
letter.

I was shocked when we got the

I was the attorney that had to try to keep compliance;

but I gave up on trying to see that absolutely no legislative
efforts were made, when they came back to me and said that
everything you do influences legislation.

I presume that

this case will be reported, and that will influence legislation.
That is a deprivation of our First Amendment rights,
QUESTION: But that letter is not in the record, is
it?
MR. SALISBURY:

We haven't had a big enough record

because we haven't had a chance to get into the court.
that is what we will prove in the
QUESTION:

But

before the —

You will prove that IRS sent you a letter

that said if you file a brief amicus in this Court you are
influencing legislation?
MR. SALISBURY:
QUESTION:

I will ~

You going to show us that letter?

MR. SALISBURY:

I will prove that the effect of

their letters —*
QUESTION:

Oh.

Oh,

The effect of the letters.

MR. SALISBURY:

-- to counsel would be, because

they say that's an action organization.
Now, they are changing their position on that
particular point, I think»

Due to various pressures.

But they still indicate that if we were to, as
we're constantly doing, going before the Congress, at the
request of Congress, to say what we think about the First
Amendment,
They say that influences legislation.

And it

probably does,
But we say we have a First Amendment right to
influence legislation.
Now, I notice that the time, the Court is ready to
close, so I will
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume the

case after lunch.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at 1:00 p.m., the same day.]

55

AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:00 p.m.3

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
about two minutes left.

Mr. Salisbury, you have

The electronics are still not

functioning and so we'll let you know when your two minutes
is up.
MR. SALISBURY:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Perhaps you can keep an

eye on the clock, too, while you’re arguing,
MR. SALISBURY:

I will just take two minutes to

sort of finish what I would have finished before lunch.

It’s

more of a preoration, but when we have our day in court on the
merits of this case, we will show that 501(c)(3), as
presently written, with its substantiality test and its
propaganda bar, permit the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
in fact invite him, to tear out the heart of unpopular
causes, unpopular to him or unpopular to the particular
personnel in the IRS handling the case.
And it does tear out the heart of our organization,
Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
We have suffered irreparable damage already.
$90,000 loss in 1972j over $200,000 loss in 1973.

A

The backlog

of gifts which we had, which permitted our appearance before
this Court so many times, it will soon be dissipated.
Already the staff has been cut from 43 to 28.

Our

56
mailing list, when we send out the educational materials
explaining to people what this Court holds on Separation of
Church and State, has been cut from 200,000 to 132,000.
Wo longer has Americans United a full-time counsel
for litigation.

This litigation is handled on an

uncompensated basis by Mr. Morrison and myself.
Surely, a substantial constitutional question is
raised when a statute is interpreted to permit, indeed to
invite, the Commissioner to stifle free speech, to stop
the seeking of redress of grievances before Congress and
before the Court; no briefs amicus have been filed with this
Court by Americans United since the revocation; no new
litigation has taken place bearing our name as plaintiffs
before the Federal Court.
Our abilities to preserve the principle of
separation of church and state, through education and
litigation and perhaps bringing our points to Congress, has
been cut out.
We ask that the opinion of the Court of Appeals
below be upheld; and on behalf of those who dedicate their
lives to religious liberty, both Catholics and Protestants
alike, we thank you for this opportunity to present our
views toyyou, in whose hands religious liberty has fared so
well in this country.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Salisbury.

57
Do you have any tiling further, Mr. Cramp ton?

You

have about three minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT P. CRAMPTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CRAMPTON;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to answer in a little more detail the
question which Mr. Justice Marshall asked me about whether
or not returns were required.

I knew that annual returns

were required, but I wasn’t concerned —■ I didn’t ■— my
recollection wasn't too clear on just what was required in
those returns as to the continuing of material relating to
continued tax exemption.
I am now advised that you are required to state
whether or not you have made any change in your activities\
but, other than that, the return is one of financial informa~
tion, and of course it would not catch a situation, or trigger
a situation, where perhaps the Commissioner had changed his
view as to a situation such as they might have here.
I'd like to reply very briefly to counsel's
suggestion that the size of the employment taxes has some
factor.

I don't think it has anything to do with it at all.

He can sue for ten dollars, and in that proceeding argue that
he is an exempt, he represents an organization exempt under
501(c)(3), and I think had he done so this question would have

58

been decided by now and been decided on its merits.
QUESTION: But it is true that he wants something
more than to get a refund of the employment taxes,
MR. CRAMPTON: Well, he wants a determination that
he’s an exempt organization, and I think he would have gotten
it in

that proceeding.
QUESTION:

Which has much broader tax implications

than just the refund of the employment taxes.
MR. CRAMPTON:

No, because I think to get the

refund of employment taxes, the court would there determine
if he was —
QUESTION; Well, I understand that.
MR. CRAMPTON:

— an organization exempt under

501(c) (3) .

Now, to the extent that he may be saying "I want
to do something for other organizations", our position is
that that's not the case here.

We're talking about Americans

United.
QUESTION: Would IRS be required to follow that as
to their contributors?
MR. CRAMPTON: Well, as to future ~
QUESTION:

I thought IRS could go along with what

the Court said or not, whichever way it goes.
MRe CRAMPTON:

I think they would, and I think

that's their policy; and we certainly would, assuming the

59
organization continued to operate the same way in later
years that it was in the time of the test case, I think that
would be a complete answer.
And they put their name back — they do require
them to file an application —
QUESTION:

That's not what — do you mean that IRS

is required to follow that as to the contributors?
IRS says you don't have to pay these taxes.

The

Can IRS also

say, but we will still deny tax exemption to the contributors?
MR. CRAMP TON: Well, the way, the procedure that
they have is that the IRS, after a case like that, asks you
to submit an application referring to the case as the reason
for — that you're now qualified as a tax-exempt organization.
QUESTION:

Well, let me put it —

MR. CRAMPTON:

And they would then put your name

back on the list.
QUESTION:

But it's no requirement, though. That

would be up to IRS, wouldn't it?
MR. CRAMPTON:
Honor.

Well, I think that's right, Your

But I think you could assume the good faith of the

government in a situation like that.
QUESTION:

Mr. Crampton, the unemployment taxes- if

they were exempt, would they be able to pay those
voluntarily and cover their employees?
exempt, section (3), organization?

If they were an

60
MR. CRAMPTON:
Honor.

I'm not sure of that question. Your

I know they can under Social Security taxes? whether

they can under the Employment taxes, I don't know.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. CRAMPTON:
on the Allen case.

I would like to comment just briefly

In that situation the University of

Georgia was a collector of taxes, it was not a taxpayer?
and so it had no means of independent judicial review. And
I think that completely distinguishes that case.
If all that the respondent wants is a determination

that the word "substantial” should be read out of section
501(c)(3), we think they could have had that holding, if
they're right, made in a refund suit? and that's the place to
do it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Crampton, maybe you've answered

this, and I haven't followed you.

A refund suit on the FUTA

taxes would not answer the 501(c)(3) issue, would it?
MR. CRAMPTON:

It's our view that it would.

Because that suit would be based on the theory that"we are
an exempt organization under section 501(c)(3), and therefore
we don't have to pay the FUTA taxes»'
And if the Court agreed with them, you'd have a
determination that it was an exempt organization.
QUESTION:

Until this revocation, Americans United

did not pay FUTA taxes.

61
MR. CRAMPTON: That's right.
QUESTION:

And that’s what triggered the payment

of the FUTA taxes.
MR. CRAMPTON:

That’s correct.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Yes.

Thank you, Mr. Crampton.

Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:07 p.m., the case in the aboveentitled matter was submitted.]
