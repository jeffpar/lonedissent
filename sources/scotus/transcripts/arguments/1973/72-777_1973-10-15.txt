MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 72-777, Cleveland Board against La Fleur.
Mr. Clarke, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES F. CLARKE, ESQ.
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLARKE;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
In January, 1952, the Cleveland Board of Education,
in response to a request by its then superintendent, enacted
the maternity rule, which is challenged here today as being
in violation of the equal protection rights of two female
schoolteachers.

The rule was enacted, as the record shows,

in response to a felt need.

It was something more than

girls giggling in class at the teacher that brought about
the enactment of this rule.
Q

This rule was enacted back in —
MR, CLARKE:

January, 1952, sir.

I might add that from January, 1952 until the
filing of this case, no question had ever been raised as to
its application or its validity.

It had never been challenged

by either of the two unions that teachers have in the
Cleveland public school system, nor had any individual
teacher, to the memory of the superintendent who testified

4
by deposition, ever challenged or in any way raised any
question about it.
Q

Can you tell us nrecisely what the rule provides?
MR. CLARKE:

Yes, Your Honor, the rule in substance

provides that at the end of the fourth month of pregnancy a
teacher must take a mandatory maternity leave.
Q

Unpaid?
MR. CLARKE:

Unpaid, yes, sir.

And she is not

thereafter permitted to return until the semester beginning
after three months after the birth of her baby.
At that time she is permitted to return with all
of the privileges and prerogatives and status that she
theretofore had had, and into any position for which she is
or was at the time she left qualified.
to that rule.

There is one exception

And it applied in this case.

If the teacher, and one of the teachers in this
case, had been teaching for less than a year, then the rule
at that time stated that she would not be entitled to mandatory
leave.

She would be discharged at the end of the year.

Since that particular amendment had been enacted after the
teacher had been employed, it was my position at the trial
court, and I conceded that that was in effect an attempt by
the Board to change her contract, and she was placed on the
mandatory maternity leave.
Q

When you talk about contracts, were these

5
individual written contracts with each teacher, or were they
covered by a collective bargaining contract or what?
MR. CLARKS:

In Ohio, teachers* contracts are

largely governed by statute.

These two teachers are what is

termed non-tenured teachers . They had not taught a sufficient
period of time to be recommended by the administrative super­
intendent as being qualified for teacher tenure.

Once they

are tenured teachers, they gather certain additional contract
rights, as the name tenure implies..

Neither of these

teachers had that tenure.
Their want of tenure is not really an issue in
this case.
Q

This same rule would have applied to tenured

teachers, would it not?
Mil. CLARKE:

Yes, Your Honor, yes, Mr. Justice

Stewart.
Q

So, tenure is not really relevant.
MR. CLARKE:

I do not think either side has

treated their non-tenured status as giving the school board
any more rights than if they were tenured.
Q

Then, to go back to my question, did they have

individual contracts?
MR. CLARKE:
0

Yes, sir.

Or contracts that were based upon what the State

legislature said they would be or what was it?

6

HR. CLARKE:

No, Mr. Justice Stewart, each teacher

has an individual contract, an individual written contract.
It is on a printed form, of course, but it is a matter of
individual contract.

Once the teacher becomes tenured, then

that contract ia automatically renewed sometime in the spring
of each year.
If she is not tenured, as these teachers were not,
then —
Q

There is an annual renewal?
MR. CLARKE:

Yes, there is not an annual renewal

in the absence of tenure, there is an annual appraisal by the
superintendent as to whether or not the teachers qualify.
Q

There has to be a new contract each year?
MR; CLARKE:

Q

For a non-tenured teacher?
MR. CLARKE:

Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

In the contract was there any specific mention of

this provision?
MR. CLARKE:

No, sir.

The provision appears in

the teachers handbook, which is a guide that is distributed
each year at certain sessions that are held prior to the
beginning of the school year.

One of the plaintiffs in the

case at bar said that she did not knov; about the handbook;
the other said that she did.
teachers handbook.

The rule does appear in the

It is a matter I think of wide general

7
knowledge.
Q

But nothing in the employment contract as such?
MR. CLARKE:

Q

No, sir.

No, sir.

Mr. Clarke?
MR. CLARKE:

Q

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

I suppose there is no answer to this, but I am a

little curious as to why the five-month provision in the
**

•>

Cleveland Board rule, the next case, does not focus on that
particular date.

Was there a reason for it at the time?

MR. CLARKE:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, the only reason

given by the superintendent at the time his deposition was
taken, as the reason for the rule, was that at that time it
became apparent that the teacher was pregnant.

I suspect

that just as you pointed out in the Roe case, medieval
theology and Christian theology took quickening to be at
about around the 16th, 18fch, 20th week.

And there is really

no single medical justification for picking the 5th month.
It is our position that whether it be the 5th month or the
6th month or the 7th month, or for that matter, the 3rd or
the 4th month, it is a matter to be left in the administrative
discretion of the Board, and does not in and of itself raise
a constitutional issue.
Q

Does it go to one month?
MR. CLARKE:

Sir, that is what the teachers

themselves have suggested.

In cross-examination of one of

8

the witnesses, it was suggested well, suopose we have a
notice, a notice requirement that within a month or two
months of the time that the teacher herself, on the advice of
her doctor, decided to leave, why would not that take the
place of the rule.

The short answer to that is, first, that

would then be substituting an 8th-month or a 7th-month
mandatory maternity leave rule for a 5-month mandatory
maternity leave rule.

And that would be subject to the same

medical problems that we are faced with today.

And that is

to say that while nearly all pregnancies start out as normal
pregnancies, only 60 to 70 percent of them continue that way.
And the problems of complications, disorders, and discomforts
of pregnancy are questions which are in great dispute in this
case.

But on this record they were not in dispute.

There

was substantial medical testimony by the most distinguished
OBGYN doctor that we could find in Cleveland, the former
Professor OBGYN at Case Western Reserve Medical School.

And

he testified that in his opinion this rule, and the entire
rule, not just the first part —
Q

Did you ever go over that testimony when you made

up this rule?
MR. CLARKE:
Q

No, sir.

Of course, you did.

You just picked 5 out of the

clear blue, did you not?
MR. CLARKE:

The only reason that Dr. Shepherd

9

gives is that that is when she began to swell and it became
apparent to him.

I do think, sir, that that is the only

reason there is in the record.

However, of course it is

unnecessary for me to point out to this Court —
Q

I am not inviting you to go outside the record.
MR. CLARKE:

record.

I am not trying to go outside the

What I am trying to say is that this rule today

should be judged as a developed thing and not in terms of its
origins only.

To take from the rules of logic, the fallacy

of origins is to judge a thing in terms of its origin only.
And today in the environment of the Cleveland public school
system, I do not really think it matters why the rule was
originally enacted.

The important thing is whether or not

it fills a felt need today.

And we think that the record

completely demonstrates that it does.
Q

Is there anything else in that handbook about

health?
MR. CLARKE:
Q

About health, sir?

Yes.
MR. CLARKE:

Yes, sir, it deals with sick leave,

all different kinds of sick leave, leave for sabbatical
purposes.

There are two different types of sick leave.

Each teacher each year —
Q

A sabbatical is sick leave?
MR. CLARKE:

No, sir.

A sabbatical is not a sick

xo
leave.

But it can be treated as such.

A sabbatical time off

for further study —
Q

Is there any other mandatory leave provision

involving health?
MR. CLARKE:

Yes, sir, because there is one that

reflects a statutory mandatory leave, and that is when a
teacher — when her health has failed to a degree that she
in the eyes of the administration is no longer able to teach
properly — we have had cases where teachers have become blind
or deaf and insisted on keeping on teaching.
Q

Is there a rule there?
MR. CLARKE:

Yes, sir, because it is also in the

statute.
Q

What is the rule?
MR. CLARKE:

Q

The rule is

Would you read it to me?
MR. CLARKE:

for a moment.

Yes, sir, if you will bear with me

Personal illness leave, it is on page 19.

The

original of this document is of course in the record, although
it is not in the transcript.
"Teachers who are unable to perform
satisfactorily the duties of their position
because of personal illness or other disability
and who have exhausted accumulated sick leave,
may be granted leave of absence without pay

11
for the remainder of the school year or for a
full school year.

Such leave of absence may be

renewed for an additional school year from the
date of the granting of the first year's leave."
There is then a procedure for an application, a
procedure for an assignment.
Q

Why could not that be used to permit the pregnant

teacher to take leave?

Why do you need the additional one?

Is not the difference that one is may and one is shall?

That

says she may take a leave, as I heard you.
MR. CLARKE:
Q

Yes, Your Honor, but —

Is there testimony that pregnancy is not a

disability?
MR. CLARKE:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, there is

such testimony on the part of the respondents in this case.
It is our contention that it is a disability.

And it is also

relevant, Mr. Justice Marshall, to certain statutes.

The

Ohio legislature at its last session just concluded enacted
a law which will not become effective until November, making
pregnancy a grounds for disability and sick leave pay.

So

that as of November of this year a teacher going on a mandatory
maternity leave in the Cleveland school system will be able
to use up her accumulated sick leave and will be paid of
course for that.
days a year.

And that accumulates at the rate of 15

There is a 120-day limit on that, unless the

12

school board has agreed to the contrary so that it is 180
days.
As a matter of fact, one of the briefs of amici
quote a contract of which I had no knowledge, a union
contract that says it is 220 days.
Q

What has that to do with this case?
MR. CLARKE:

It has nothing, sir, I brought it

out only because of the question.
Q

And that is a State-wide law?
MR. CLARKE:

Yes, sir, a great many of the

regulations in the teachers handbook are in there because of
State lav/.

But Mr. Justice Marshall is correct, the

maternity leave is not.
Q

Is this rule in the Cleveland system typical of

rules in the various school systems in Ohio or is this
unique?
MR. CLARKE:

It is typical, Your Honor.

There

is an excellent brief amicus opposed to my position by the
National Educational Association, containing detailed
statistical analyses of this rule, stating that it is
typical in 49 percent of the school systems of the United
States having more than 25,000 students in the school system
these rules apply either for the 5th month or the 6th month.
So, we are talking about a rule of widespread application.
Q

They are of widespread application, at least in

13

the larger urban districts.
MR. CLARKE:
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, I —

That is all right.

We have the information in

that amicus brief.
MR. CLARKE:

The problem that brought about the

original enactment of the rule was that teachers, when asked
to leave, would not do so; not one, but according to the
record, many of them.

They would be asked to leave at the

end of the 6th month or the 7th month or the 3th month, and
they just would not do it.

And rather than take the very

strenuous statutory method of terminating them, the then
superintendent asked the Board to enact this rule so that
there would be a uniform rule.

And he was concerned about

the continuity of the educational process, which is as true
today, if not more true today, than it was then.

And 1'

can demonstrate the continuity, the importance of the
continuity of the educational process in no way better than
by the record in this case of Mrs. La Fleur herself.

Mrs.

La Fleur was and still is an extraordinarily good teacher.
She was a well trained teacher not only in English but under
one of the title I Federal grants.

She had been trained

to teach under-achievers, particularly in the inner city of
Cleveland.

She had taken special courses in that, she was

well qualified for that.
average kind of teachincf.

It is a little different from the
Her class consisted of 25 girls,

14

girls, girls who were not mentally retarded — these were
educable girls — but who were not motivated and who, .because
of background or one reason or another needed soma extra
personal help.
She was sort of a home room teacher in a way.
These were called transition classes at the 7th Grade to
prepare them, and she put it, for the mainstream of the 8th
Grade.

She was not the only teacher who tauaht these

children.

A math teacher would come in in the mornings,

a science teacher would come in in the mornings.

They would

go to home economics class where there would be another
teacher.

They would go to gym class, where there would be

another teacher.

But she was always there.

On December 17, 1970 she advised her principal
that she was pregnant.
teaching English.

Up until that time she had been

She had not been in the transition class,

but both she and her principal contemplated that she would
go there.

Her principal expressed some dismay and told

her because of the mandatory maternity leave rule she would
have to leave in a couple of months and then took it. up
with Mr. Tanczos who testified in this case.
Bear in mind, because of the maternity leave rule
the administration thus became aware of this lady's
pregnancy.

Mr. Tanczos then advised that there was no one

available at that time but that it was important to have

15
somebody there to be trained by Mrs. La Fleur. So# if she
would take over the transition class at the end of the
Christmas holiday knowing that she would have to leave in
March, she did take it over, and a month before she left,
a Miss Sutter who had been trained in the same way in title
I, came in and was there observing for a month how success­
ful Mrs. La Fleur had been.

I submit it would be hard to

find a better example of the importance of the rule in
establishing the continuity of the educational process than
in this record right before you today.
But it is true with 5,000 teachers teaching
different kinds of classes — and, of course, this is not
■*

always true.

The other plaintiff was teaching a French

class, teaching different people in French during the day.
The replacement for her came in — there was a dispute in
the evidence as to whether it came in a week before or a
day before.

But the necessity for having a well trained

teacher existed in Mrs. La Fleur's case.
Q

Mr. Clarke, is it accurate to say that without

the rule she might have finished the term without any
difficulty?
MR. CLARKE:

That is what she wanted to do, Mr.

Justice Blackmun, and she would then have been — you see,
there was a little mistake in just when she became pregnant.
She originally thought she had become pregnant at such a

16
time that the baby would be born in mid-August.

In point of

fact — this is in the record — she later learned and so
testified that the baby was due in mid-July.

She said that

she wanted to continue teaching, which would have meant that
she taught until around the first week in June, which would
have made her about 8 months pregnant.

This was her desire

had there been no rule.
Q

At least there would have been no discontinuance?
MR. CLARKE:

in that case.

There would have been no discontinuance

But you would have had an 8-month-pregnant

schoolteacher on your hands.

Your Honor, there is a sharp

dispute in the briefs of the parties as to what the record
contains.

With all due respect to my sisters at the bar,

I do not believe that their brief fairly nor candidly
summarizes the evidence as to the medical questions.

And

it certainly attempts to say that we made concessions which
we did not make and do not make today.

The evidence is

undisputed on Dr. Weir's testimony that a schoolteacher, 4
months pregnant, is not an able-bodied person.
has delivered babies for 25 or 30 years.

I might say it

is in the record that he delivered one of mine.
had a distinguished career.

Dr. Weir

And he

In the latter stages of his

career he became concerned about problems of infertility.
He is described only as an infertility expert in the
respondents' brief.

That is not the case.

He had specialized

17

in infertility but along with a general obstetrical practice
and a teaching position at Case Western Reserve University.
I think it is fair to say from a reading not only
of the briefs of the parties but reading the briefs of amicie
that there are today in the medical profession strong
differences of opinion as to how long a pregnant lady should
be permitted to continue to work.

There is testimony in one

of the amici briefs from the International Union of Electrical
Radio Workers and in the appendix where a doctor testifies
that he thinks a pregnant woman is capable of teaching until
the day of delivery or until the hour of delivery, and there
is some evidence about nurses doing their tasks until that
time.
Q

Is there not some medical testimony in this

record that it depends upon the individual?
MR. CLARKE:
dispute that.
Q

Of course, it does, sir.

We do not

The point is not —

But this rule does not depend upon the individual.
MR. CLARKE:

That is right, sir.

The rule is for

the administrative convenience of the school to furnish
quality education, that is the purpose of the rule.
rule was not enacted for the welfare of the teachers.

The
The

rule was enacted to furnish quality education and to prevent
the school board from being subject to the disruptions that

18
vill occur, as the medical evidence shows can and do occur
in 30 to 40 percent of the cases from the coraolication3 of
pregnancy.
We do not say, sir, that pregnancy is not an
individual matter,

of course it is.

But our concern is not

really in this case with the welfare of those teachers.

Our

concern is to give the best quality education to the children
in the city of Cleveland that we can, and it was for that
reason that the rule was enacted, and it is for that reason
that I am standing here today to support it.
I would like very briefly to summarize what those
disabilities are.

A pregnant woman, more than four months

pregnant, changes her center of gravity.
back.

Her shoulders go

She is more susceptible to falls than she was before.

She has a weight gain of approximately 20 pounds.

A3 a matter

of fact, in this month's issue of the American .Medical
Journal it says it should be 25 pounds.

She urinates more

frequently because of the pressure of the fetus on her
bladder.

She is more susceptible to headaches.

She has the

three classic fears of pregnancy, of a miscarriage, of her
own death, of having a deformed child.

These are, in the

opinion of our expert, exacerbated by the environment, the
school environment, in which she finds herself — not to the
degree and not with the interest that it hurts her but that
it prevents her from being as competent a teacher as she was

19

before.

And that is the sole justification for the medical

testimony.
I would like to reserve, if I may, some of the
remainder of my time.
Are there any further questions, sir?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. CLARKE;

Very well, Mr. Clarke.

Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs. Picker?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JANE M. PICKER
ON BEHALF OF TIIE RESPONDENTS
MRS. PICKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We are here today in our view to present to you
the issue of whether a woman is both able and willing to
r

work is to be permitted to continue working as long as she
is medically able to or only until her condition of nregnancy
becomes visible to the eye.

We feel that the record amply

demonstrates first that there is no question that was ever
raised as to whether the plaintiffs in this case could carry
their duties out until the end of the school year.

Both

babies — although Mr, Clarke certainly correctly stated
— there was some lack of certainty as to whether Mrs. La
Fleur's baby was to be expected in August or in mid-July.
Indeed, the baby was born on July 28.

There was no question

raised that she would not be able to teach until the first

20

of June.
There is no question that the other plaintiff in
this case, Mrs. Nelson, would not equally have taught to the
end of the school year.

Her baby indeed was born in August.

The reason for the rule, as I believe it is admitted on the
part of everyone, was cosmetic and not medical in nature.
"We do not want our children to see women who are visibly
pregnant."
The respondents contend that this particular rule
is one which embodies an invidious classification which i3
based on sex alone.

The petitioners apoeared to contend in

their briefs, although it has not been raised in argument
today, that pregnancy is a condition which is unique to women
and that therefore there is no discrimination in a rule which
deals xfith pregnancy, which obviously do not occur in all
women simultaneously although it may well occur in almost
every woman at sometime during their lives.
We feel that the use of the word competition is
out of place here.

Surely there can be no question but what

there is no competition in the child-bearing function.
indeed must bear this burden alone.

Women

There is however a

great deal of competition in the working world and, let us
face it, this exists among and between men and women as it
does as well among members of each sex separately.

The issue

in this case in truth is whether or not women are going to

21
be permitted to compete equally in the working world.
If indeed our brothers are correct and the fact
that pregnancy is unique to women is a valid reason for
discriminating against them in the terms of their employment,
then the guarantee of equal employment opportunity to women
must be a futile oromisa.

I believe the briefs which have

been submitted by the various amici in this case have
pointed to the statistics with respect to the effects of
employment discrimination against women, the differences
in salary level that exist among and between the races and
the sexes.

And I think it is rather clear that employment

discrimination which is based on pregnancy is one which
ultimately can affect each woman to her detriment.
Woman's frail nature historically has been an
excuse for protecting her in ways which have affected her
*•
adversely,

we are all familiar with the old cases in this

Court where the issue was whether or not women could be
protected from x^orking certain hours, for receiving certain
types of wages.

In fact, if pregnancy is a valid reason

for discriminating, we can discriminate in such a manner as
to protect all women out of jobs.
Q

Mrs. Picker, if an employer said to the men in

his employ no beards and no mustaches, would you regard this
as a discrimination based on sex?
MRS. PICKER:

Your Honor, I think we have seen

22
some cases — and certainly the Raffert case has been cited
in one brief against us in Florida.
do not have beards or mustaches.
their heads as do women.

I recognize most women

Most men do have hair on

And I think that if we start getting

into distinctions on the basis of the olace where hair grows,
we are really getting into ludicrous questions.
Q

I was wondering whether you can distinguish the

suppositicious case I gave you from the pregnancy situation.
MRS. PICKER:
Q

I think indeed that —

Other than by saying the one is ludicrous and the

other is not.
MRS. PICKER:

I think that the question of where

the hair grows is ludicrous.

In other words, I think that

when you have cases that say that it is all right to imoose
a regulation on a man's beard and mustache because of the
fact that women cannot grow them but it is not all right to
do it on the length of their hairr on the head because that
constitutes sex discrimination, that indeed that is
ludicrous.

Therefore, I say yes, I do not think that the

fact that men alone have beards and mustaches is a sufficient
reason for being able to say that you can therefore say
as an employer you cannot have this and you cannot have
that, that it is the same sort of thing.
But I think that the question which has been
raised generally in the cases on this issue have wrongly

23

really been theorized on the basis of the nreemancy decisions.
Q

Let me extend that hypothetical a little bit.

Suppose it is an industrial operation, the rule of the factory
is that no man working on particular machines may be emnloyed
in that type of work if they have beards because experience
of the insurance company shows that 30 percent of the men who
have beards have special accidents.
MRS. PICKER:

I think, Your Honor, that generally

speaking the safety regulations which have been involved in
a lot of these industrial cases have been ones which, as
it turned out when one looked at them, were not pertinent
because of the fact that they treated one sex only.
In other words, I do not think that it is relevant
if a man has a beard that, say, comes to his chin, if a woman
is permitted to work on those machines and she has hair that
extends to her shoulder.

I think that we have to recognize

that safety is an adequate reason for insuring that certain
accidents cannot occur but we are all too well familiar, I
think, with the fact that in most swimming pools boys must
wear caps, girls need not.

We all know today the length

of hair is surely not based on sex.

And a bathing cap rule

should relate to the length of a person’s hair, not whether
it is men's hair or women's hair.

As far as we know, there

are no distinct qualities in the hair of one sex as onposed
to the hair of another sex.

I think that any rule which

24
relates to safety, if it is applied across the board, is
fair.

But I think one which goes to beards and does not

affect hair on other oarts of the body which also can inter­
fere with the machinery is not an appropriate one at all.
Q

Let us make the rule any hair on the face or the

head that goes more than X distance from the chin line as
a safety reason.

You have no question about upholding

that?
MRS. PICKER:
0

No, it does not disturb me.

As to beards, it would not affect women though.
MRS. PICKER:

I really do not like to raise it,

but of course some women do have beards.
Q

But it is not a generality in the experience of

human beings.
MRS. PICKER:

No, it is not, no.

No.

The mandatory maternity leave is how the rule in
this case has been labeled, and I would like to noint out a
couple of things.
to call it a leave.
policy.

First of all, it is in fact a euphemism
It is a termination.

It is a discharge

And Mr. Clarke recently referred to the fact that

the woman may return after child birth, but I would like to
point out that the language of the rule refers only to
priority in reassignment if there is a vacancy.
Q

Would you make this same argument if a new

statute were effective now?

25
MRS. PICKER:

The new statute, I believe that in

fact it does not apply in this case.

It applies to county

and State employees.
Q

Suppose it were effective now, would you be making

this argument?
MRS. PICKER:

You mean as far as the case itself

is concerned?
Q

If these leaves were paid leaves.
MRS. PICKER:

If the leave was a paid leave, my

feeling is that a woman still has a right to work rather than
take —
Q

It would still be a discharge.
MRS. PICKER:

so.

It would still be, yes, I believe

Because, as you may know, often there are reasons why

a woman would prefer to work even if she received the same
pay over taking a leave.

There are matters such as one's

progress in one's profession, one's accumulation of seniority,
one's ability to stay current in one's field, all of which
are adversely affected by time away from the job, even if
one continues to get a pay check.

I think, in fact, in most

instances the issue would not be raised.

Most women would

not, I think, feel compelled to go into court in a situation
where they were continued on the payroll if indeed the
opportunity to return was a real one and they knew that they
could go back to their job.

There is no guarantee, of course.

26

even If the women is allowed to return, that she will be
assigned to teach the same subject that she taught before or
even in the same school.

So that it is a very risky business

as to whether she will be satisfied by what she receives at
the other end of the trip to the hospital as far as her
employment rights are concerned today.
The policy, as far as the new law is concerned,
does not I think helm the teachers in this case.

It could,

with proper interpretation of other provisions of State law.
But this particular provision refers only to the State and
county employees, not the School Board employees.
I think also that if we are going to say that a
woman can be terminated because she is pregnant, that there
is really very little logic to where one draws the line.
If a woman can be terminated because she is pregnant, can
she also be either not hired or terminated because she may
become pregnant?

I think every woman in certain types of

work is aware of instances where she has been barred from
work because of the fear of that employer that she may be­
come pregnant, may leave, may not return, and therefore
she will not get the job in the first place.

Pregnancy is

such a widespread phenomenon, it is potentially there in the
case of every woman.

And if one finds that on the basis

of it being any condition that one can regulate it at one's
will, I am not quite sure where one then can draw the line

27
to insure the protection of women.
And I might add that although of course now there
is that particular provision which protects State and county
employees, that the Board of Education in this case, while
it claimed to be concerned with the welfare of the teachers,
that it had absolutely no concern with respect to their
financial welfare.
an unpaid leave.

The teachers in this case were put on
I believe that the NEA takes a position

that really this is just another step in a very pervasive
history on the part of school boards of their discrimination
first against married women, now against pregnant women,
and I believe that the International Union of Electrical
Workers' brief points out the very great importance to the
well being both of the mother and of her child of having
adequate financial resources during the period of pregnancy
when a woman's diet is very important and when she may be
required to follow a particular medical regimen.
So, I do not think the lack of concern for the
financial situation of the teacher who is terminated at the
end of her 4th month of pregnancy is one which is of no
importance because it is money only.
I think that we should also notice the contrast
in the situation with respect to the plaintiffs in this case
and that of the students whom they teach.

At one time, of

course, both married and pregnant students were barred from

28
the classroom.

By the Attorney General's opinion in 1961,

Ohio schools were no longer permitted to bar married
students.

In 1968 an Ohio Attorney General opinion orovided

that unless school attendance would be detrimental to her
physical safety and well being, that a pregnant student
could not be taken away from classes.
Indeed, I believe the situation here where the
plaintiff, Mrs. La Fleur, taught pregnant students — it is
in the record — and where one of the witnesses, another
teacher who had been permitted by the School Board to work
until her 8th month of pregnancy but at no pay, Mrs. Tucker,
after she had been terminated, that these situations are
the rule rather than the exception.

In the Williams case,

which is cited in the brief, Northern District of Ohio case
in 1972, the person being terminated there was a social
worker who was an employee of the Board of Education whose
only job was advising and counseling pregnant students.
What kind of a rule is it that finds it perfectly permissible
for pregnant students to sit in the classroom but not their
teachers?
The School Board in ignoring the precedent of
the situation with respect to pregnant students stresses
instead the need for classroom continuity.

Mr. Clarke said

today that this case was the perfect examnle of why the
rule promotes classroom continuity.

It irequires the fingers

29

of only one hand to see that indeed the students in the
transition program who were educable but slow learners and
who were being prepared to enter into main stream classes ,
as a result of this rule had three teachers during the school
year.

They could have had only two if Mrs. La Fleur had not

been permitted to teach them in December.

But knowingly the

School Board put a pregnant teacher in there who they knew
would be terminated in March, thereby insuring that these
students would have three teachers and not two during the
course of the school year.
I think that makes virtually a mockery of the
claim that the purpose of the rule is to insure classroom
continuity.

There is no similar rule with respect to any
t

other medical condition if a teacher knows that he is going
to have surgery for a heart condition or any other and will
be out of work for a month or two, there is no rule whatsoever
which insures that he will take a mandatory leave and that
classroom continuity will be protected.

It is protected,

so to speak, only in the case of pregnancy.

And, of course,

we submit that the record here clearly proves that it is the
very opposite of a rule promoting pregnancy that does the
opposite.

Neither Mrs. La Fleur nor Mrs. Nelson would have

been required to leave school at all.
Q

May the school have any rule about pregnancy?
MRS. PICKER:

I am not sure.

I think that if you

30
want to be requiring a medical certificate, for example,
with respect to a person's ability to work, that if a person
has any kind of a known medical condition which requires a
doctor's attention, that one could require such a certificate.
But I think that it would have to be an across-the-board x*ule
which would say that a man with a heart condition would also
have to have his doctor provide a statement saying that he
could teach.
Q

So the same argument would go no matter what the

enforced period was or even with respect to a medical
certificate?
MRS. PICKER:

I think so.

I cannot see any

reason for singling out pregnancy.
Q

Mrs. Picker, there is one thing about pregnancy

and that is this, that everybody knows there is going to be
a period when the woman is not going to be available to work,
at least a period of a few days.

One can argue about hew

long it is, but on the day that she gives birth to the baby
she is not going to be at school,

So, would you not concede

the possibility of a regulation that required advanced
notice to the Board of Education that the teacher was not
going to be available during a certain period?
MRS. PICKER:

Your Honor, I think there are really

two questions that you are asking and two answers.
Q

At least two.

31

MRS. PICKER:

The first is that we cannot assume

that schools are in session all year, seven days a week.
We all know that the summer vacation period is a quarter of
the year.

Both our teachers were giving birth then.

There

is no need whatsoever for them to miss any time.
As far as the notice is concerned, we have never
objected to a notice provision as long as it is a notice
provision which applies to anyone with a known medical
condition which is likely to take them out of the classroom.
Q

Pregnancy is not likely to take you out of the

classroom; it inevitably will, will it not if the birth
takes place on a week day during the school year?
MRS. PICKER:

It will inevitably take you out

if it is on a week day of the school year.

But, as we

well know, not every pregnancy is a successful one.

And

there are instances — there is a recent case in which a
woman miscarried and was not permitted to teach after the
miscarriage.

Now, miscarriage may only remove you from

work for one or two days if it is at an early stage.
may not affect your employment rights at all.

It

And while

this particular school board rule is one at the end of the
4th month of pregnancy,there are of course many, many
rules.

The NEA brief cites all kinds of rules which are

earlier than this one.
notice requirement.

I think we have no problem with the

Indeed, the superintendent of

32
secondary education testified in the record that he felt a
one-month rule would be totally satisfactory to the school
board.

He had been employed in the school system for over 20

years at the time he testified, and he aqreed that there was
no need for a mandatory leave if only he had a month's notice
of when a teacher was going to leave.
Mr. Clarke has assumed, I think very interestingly
enough, in argument today that if there was only a one month’s
notice ruling, every teacher would work until she was
eight months pregnant.

I think it is interesting that he

feels that all teachers obviously not only are capable but
would want to work until that period of time.
f-

And that is

i

the reason for the School Board's problem in this case.
But I cannot understand, if you know when a
teacher is going to leave, how there is a problem.

And I

do not know of any teacher who would object to giving a
date at least a month in advance as to when they were going
to leave.

But the School Board, as they have stated here

today, is not satisfied with that solution.

And that is

why we are in Court.
Q

But at least the answer you gave to Justice White,

as I understand, you now qualify.

You would concede the

constitutional validity of a rule that required a teacher
who was pregnant to give some sort of notice to her employer'
that she vras not going to be available, at least for a

33

period of time, so far as she could anticipate.

I know that

there might be a miscarriage unanticipated.
MRS. PICKER:

I do not have any objection to it,

but I do feel that there remains a violation of equal
protection if anybody else who knows that they are going to
have surgery is not required to give notice, if they know it
in advance.

If you know you are going to be out for an

operation, why do you not have an obligation also to give
notice?

It is as much a problem to the School Board,

regardless of the reason for the hospital stay, and no
school board has ever required that of any person.
Q

I was not suggesting that anybody who was

expected to be out and not available to teach would not be
covered by the same rule.
MRS. PICKER:
Q

Then I have no objection whatsoever.

It is not whether or not you have an objection

nor I have an objection but whether or not the Constitution
has an objection.
MRS. PICKER:

Exactly, which even us at the bar

must attempt to interpret in our arguments.
I would like to just make mention of the fact
that the case before us, in our view, is really a corner­
stone case.

Because what happens to our pregnant teachers,

once they are forced to leave their jobs, all too often they
do indeed have financial problems and they go and try to

34
get unemployment, compensation,

In Ohio today they, as a

result of the lawsuit, will be given it.
they will not.

But in most States

And for the reason, of course, that these

laws too are viewed to be sexually discriminatory, there is
a great deal of litigation .in the Court today an this issue.
And we feel, therefore* that the 14th Amendment argument is
still a most important one, despite the fact that we now
t

have legislation both at State and Federal level which goes
to this same type of question.

While Title VII of the

Civil Rights Act now covers State and local government
employees, there are very, very few cases which have even
come out of District Courts interpreting that legislation
with respect to mandatory maternity leaves, and none have
reached appellate level.

So we feel that it is really

quite premature to attempt to see the interpretation of
legislation and how it will affect this particular issue
at this time.
And I think also the Court should b© aware of
the fact as to why these ca.39s continue to be brought under
the 14th Amendment even now that there is Federal legislation.
And that is because we have of course a 180-day waiting
period under Title VII, ar.d babies do not wait for anyone.
So that if you seek injunctive relief, it is only under
the 14th Amendment that it is possible, even today, for
any teacher to attempt to get relief.

For this reason,

35
although Title VII is there, I think we can only anticipate
that a great many of these cases will continue to be brought
under the 14th Amendment.
I think finally that it is proper for us to comment
on the principal precedent which our opponents have cited
in favor of their position, and that is the Rodriguez case.
The situation in Rodriguez, we argue, is totally different
from the case at bar.

IN that case there was no discernible

discrimination against any protected group.

That was I

think a very first and obvious distinction between our case
and Rodriguez.
We also read that this Court mentioned there and
has earlier found that classifications with respect, to tax
matters are treated most leniently under the 14th Amendment.
Even in tax matters there have recently been cases in which
amendment violations of the 5th Amendment have been found
in the Moritz case.

In the 10th Circuit, for example, a

classification was found to be sexually discriminatory and
was 'therefore invalidated.

So, I think that we have again

an important distinction with respect to the classification
here, which is not a fiscal one at all and which deals
solely with individuals solely of the female sex.
The point which the School Board makes is that
Rodriguez guarantees an ability on the part of local govern­
ment to control educational policy.

We do not disagree with

36
that.

We have no dispute with that whatsoever.

But we

sharply contend that the maternity rule here in question is
a matter of educational policy.
Curricular matters are.

It is not, in our view.

But what we are talking about is

employment policy on which there is a national policy now,
not educational policy, which is properly left to local govern
ment.
Indeed, we feel that the argument of the
petitioners is almost backward here and that their argument
favors us.

Because since the Court in Rodriquez found that

there is no fundamental right to an education, that that
very reason gives the students, the employees of a school
board, no greater disability than employees of other
employers.

Classroom continuity can hardly be a reason for

denying women employment rights when employees of other
employers do not get treated in that manner.
'Consequently, in our view, Frontiero was far more
applicable than Rodriguez.

There, using petitioners5 analysis

we are dealing with an area of military policy.

If ever

there is an area in which we have found that individual
rights have received less protection than in other areas,
it is in the area of military policy.

Yet again in that

case, the position of the women was found vindicated.
There is not truly any collision in this area
between State and national policy.

Mr. Clarice has pointed

3?

to the legislation which has been effective since the first
of August.

It do©3 relate at this time only to State and

county employees.

However, I might point out that effective

August 13 of this year, there were State personnel regulations
which related to State and county employees which indeed
gave them the same rights subsequently given to them by newly
enacted legislation.
In other words, the stata government of Ohio felt
that it could, pursuant to the old lav;, give them these
rights.

The language of the old law is little different from

the language of the law relating to employees of boards of
education; and I think it is therefore susceptible to the
same interpretation.

Therefore, w© do not find any particular

conflict at all, and we- feel that the argument of administra­
tive convenience which has been presented to you today by
petitioners is the same argument that you have heard again
and again in Reed v. Reed, Stanley, and Frontiero, and that
it can have no more validity in the present case than it
did in those.
I do not think that any of us feel that persons’
employment rights should be taken away from them in order to
shield children from the facts of life, and that indeed is
what has been done here and has consistently been done by
school boards with mandatory maternity leave rules in the
past.

38
Q
ment.

Mrs. Picker, you have referred to the 14th Amend­
Do you view this case as exclusively involving the

Equal Protection Clause?
MRS. PICKER;
Q

Yes, we do, Your Honor.

You do not view it as involving the Due Process

Clause at all?
MRS. PICKER;

Well, Your Honor, we did not think

to plead that originally, and I axn not sura that that is
particularly detrimental to our case.

We have learned a lot

since the pleadings were originally filed in this case.

It

was prior to Stanley of course, and indeed prior to
Reed v. Reed»

It seems to me as though we indeed had a

violation here of Due Process as well as Equal Protection,
but we did not plead it.

And therefore we have not argued

it.
I feel on the basis of Stanley, of course, that
perhaps we are not precluded.

I gather that in that case

one was pleaded and that the case indeed was found to turn
on both.

But it is clearly our position that there is a

violation of Due Process here as well, although we have felt
precluded from arguing it in this instance.

Very wel1»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Clark©, you have a

few minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES F. CLARKE, ESO.

39

MR. CLARKE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice Burger.

I can understand my sister*s confusion over the statute, but
she is simply in error.

There were two statutes passed at

the last session of the Ohio legislature.
State employees.

One limited the

The other, the amendment to Section 3319.141

of the Ohio Revised Code, specifically states:
"Each person who is employed by any board
of education in this State shall be entitled to
15 days sick leave with pay.

Teachers and non­

teaching school employees, upon approval of the
responsible administrative officer of the school
district, may use sick leave for absence due to
personal injury, pregnancy" —
And pregnancy is the word that was added to the
statute.
I was unable to get & certified or enrolled copy
of the bill, but I do have a Xerox copy of it.

I would be

glad to furnish it to the Clerk's Office.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Would you give it to

the Clerk and give Mrs. Picker a copy of it, of course.
MR. CLARKE:

Yes, Your Honor.

One or two brief comments.

The parties are in

agreement that the Equal Employment Opportunities Act
provisions are not relevant in this case.

Thai* is to say,

whether or not the guidelines passed one week after the

40

enactment: of the 1972 Civil Rights Act, are relevant in this
case.

The only grounds for relevancy that I can see is that

they demonstrate another remedy for the schoolteacher if the
case were to be filed today.
Yes, Hr. Justice Powell?
Q

Before you leave that subject, have those guidelines

been accented by the Cleveland Board or not?

They have not

been applied to supersede the rule.
MR. CLARKE:

At the present time, yes, Your Honor,

Mr. Justice Powell, the rule is being held in abeyance pending
the decision of this Court and in compliance with the guide­
lines.

Yes, sir.
The long hair issue, Hr. Justice Blackmun, there

is a series of cases in the 6th Circuit. Co\irt of Appeals
culminating in Ciffell v. Rickleman and Jackson v. Porter.
I am familiar with them because Ciffell is my case.

It held

that School Board regulations which required male students
to cut their hair did not rise to the dignity of any
constitutional question and that such regulation was not
discriminatory against males.

That is to say, it was not a

constitutional question, and this Court has denied certiorari
in I think 25 or 30 long hair cases.

Tha only Justice on

tills Court who has expressed a view on it was Hr. Justice
Black in one very short opinion in which he too held that he
did not find any constitutional issue.

41
1 would like to point out that obviously through
oversight and inadequate scholarship there is one leading
case that I did not mention in my brief and which I think is
of extraordinary importance in this case, and that is
Pandridge v« Williams.

In 327 United States 471, sneaking

for the Court, '?.r. Justice Stewart had, among other things,
the following to say, and I think it is applicable here when
you consider whether this rule should be a 4-month or 5-month
or 6-month or 7-month or an 8-month rule.
"In the area of economics and social
welfare a State does not violate the Equal
Protection Clause merely because the
classifications made by its laws are
imperfect.

If a classification has some

reasonable basis, it does not offend the
Constitution.

The problems of Government

are practical ones and may justify, if they
do not require, rough accommodations.
Illogical as it may be and unscientific,
a statutory discrimination will not be set
tr

.
f

aside if any state of facts reasonably made
can be conceived to justify it."
I am sorry that that was not in our brief.

It

should have been.
Lastly, it seems to petitioners, Your Honor, that

42
the basic issue before you. as many commentators have
suggested, particularly in an article, in 86 Harvard Law
Review,

"Developments of the lav;, a model for new equal

protection," that Your Honors have before one of the most
evasive issues that this Court has to determine.

And that

is, What is the future of the Equal Protection Clause?

It

is by and large an important basic and fundamental question
that I think with all due respect to my sisters at the bar
does go somewhat beyond the narrow issue in this case.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURCER:

Very well.

Thank you,

the case is submitted.
{Whereupon, at 12 o'clock, noon, the case was
stubmi tted.)
