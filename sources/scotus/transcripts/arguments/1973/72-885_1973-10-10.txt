ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORIC» ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TBS PETITIONERS

MR. BGH&s

Mr* Chief Justicef and may it pleas® the

Court:
This case presents at this stage only an issue of
federal taxpayer's standing# and the question is whether the
exception mafia is the rule of Frofchingham v. Mellon by the
later decision of Flash v. Cohen could be widened to grant
©tending ia casos not involving the establishment clause and
the free exercise clauses of the First Amendment.
The government will attempt to demonstrate that an
affirmative answer» the answer the respondent here seeks»
would effectively overrule all of Frofchlngham, which Flast did

not purport to do» and would probably destroy the concept of
standing altogether*

That result we think is precluded by

cana.'derations rooted in Article III of the Constitution and
by considerations relating to the role of this Court and other
federal courts in exercising the power of judicial review.
The respondent brought this suit in the District Court

4
for the Western District ©£ Pennsylvania feo enjoin the publica­
tion. by the Secretary of the treasury of the combined stateKents of receipt®f expenditures and balances of the United
States government, on the ground that that document does not
identify appropriations for and expenditures by the Central
intelligence Agency.
Now* this confidentiality of CIA funding and spending
is expressly provided by statute as an exception to the general
statute which requires that the Secretary of the treasury
annually lay before Congress the combined statement.

The CIA

budget, of course, is reflected in the total figures in the
combined statement, but it is not identified as such.
The respondent's theory is that this congressiona1ly
provided confidentiality violates the statements and accounts
clausa of Article I* section $, Clause 7* which reads:

"Wo

money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of
Appropriations nthda by &awss and a regular Statement and Account
of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be
published from time to time.'*
The District Court dismissed respondent's complaint
on the ground that he lacks standing as & taxpayer.

But the

Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting ea banc,
reversed, with three judges dissenting.
X would like to approach this case initially through
an examination of Fiast v. Cohen in an attempt to show that

5

that, ea»© denias respondent's standing here.
And then 2 would like to turn briefly to issues of
constitutional policy and argue that the standing concept .in
cases like this is an Article XIX concept, as F!a$t v. Cohen
recognises, and it is important to preserve that concept.
1 think the majority opinion in Flash plainly denies
standing in this case.

Only if the limits set by that case to

taxpayer standing are abandoned can respondent here be accorded
♦

standing.

And, of course, FXast must bo seen against the back­

ground of FrothIngham v. Mellon.
In that case, in Frothlngham, the taxpayer attacked
the constitutionality of the Maternity Act of 1921 which set up
a federal program to grant, m&ka grants to states who would
undertake programs to reduce maternal and infant mortality, and

:
-th& taxpayer sued and challenged the constitutionality of the
Maternity Act on the ground* that it exceeded the powers dele»
gated to Congress under Article I, that it violated the powers
reserved to the states by the 10th Amendment, and it deprived
hex* through the taxing process of her property without due
process of law under the Fifth Amendment.
Those are constitutional claims that at that time
unr® certainly '.regarded as quite as important as any constitu­
tional claim the respondeat seeks to litigate hare,
But this Court nevertheless denied standing and that
rule against taxpayer standing stood inviolate until Fl&st.

6
But the PXasfc majority was very careful to state that it was
leaving the FrothIngham rule intact except for defined category
of cases, and the exception it made in the Frothinghain rule was
for eases in which the taxpayer could show a logical nexus be­
tween the taxpayer statue and the claim he sought to adjudicate.
And that logical nexus test breaks down into two further tests
in Flasi:
First, there must be a-logical link between the tax­
payer status and the type of legislative enactment sought to bs
attacked, and second, there must be a similar nexus between the
status o£ taxpayer and the precise nature of the constitutional
infringement alleged.
I do not think that respondent in this case can

satisfy either ©£ those tests.
The Flaat opinion said of this first nexus, the one
between the status of taxpayer and the enactment to this
challenged, I quote;
"A taxpayer would be a proper party to allege the
unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power
under the taxing and spending clause of Article I, Section 3.*
Respondent here, of course, is not attacking any
exercise of the taxing and spending power under Section 8.

He

is attacking a reporting provision under Section 9.
The Court in Flast continued;
"It will not be sufficient for a taxpayer to allege

7
an Incidental expenditure of tax funds in fch® administration of
an essentially regulatory statute»"
1 would like to make two observations about that first

test in connection with this case.

The first is that here the

respondent makes no complaint of any injury to his pocketbook.
He is not saying that any tax money is being taken from hiss in
violation of the Constitisti on, so that there is no link between
the status he asserts, that of a taxpayer, and the statute
permitting CIA funding to be placed in the budgets of other
agencies or departments,

it is apparent on the face of tha

matter that, what ho has is the interest common to all oitisane;
that is, as this Court has put it, merely a general intereat
common to all menbors of the public, and that he seeks to air
his generalised grievances about fch© conduct of government.
And thus© are precisely

tha phrases this Court has

used to describe a litigant who has no «standing.
*rha S3 con cl observation I would like to make about this
first test in Flash is that the theory of the majority of the
Court of Appeals below, and I believe the theory of the
respondent here, is that the first Flash test is satisfied be­
cause the respondent is injured by lack of knowledge about tha
CIA budget,

As t,h© respondent's brtaf puts it, it is the in­

timacy of tha constitutional provision to tha spending process
that .1« relevant.
If that were tha test, then FXast actually left no

8
vestige of Prothingh,%sa dasp.ita its protestations to the con­
trary.

Taxpayers would hat®, X think, under that test, stand­

ing to litigata any grievance that ia tolerably related to the
appropriation process, arid that in torn would inject the courts
into every imaginable question bearing on the constitutionality
of action?* by the legislative and executive branches at the
request of every disgruntled taxpayer who wanted to oppose some
governmental program &r procedure.

Q

Mr. Jones, do 1 gather from your brief that no

cm can attack this?
MR. BORKs

j

MR. BORKj

— in a court, yes.

But that, of course, is not an. unusual situation with

constitutional provisions for a variety of reasons, justicia­
bility among thorn, a variety of constitutional provisions may
not be enforced by a court.
Q

Congress could require them to render an account

courts, or ~*~
MR. BORK;

That is the question w® must get into at

som degree, at least, Kr. Chief Justice? that also impinges
upon the ultimate question if the respondent were found to
have standing, but 1 think the second Flash test which talks
about what is the purpose of a constitutional prevision neces­
sarily requires that w© talk about that as well.
I think the history —

If wa need to get to that at allr that's the

point, is it not?
MR. BO.IK;

Vfell —

If we reach that*

Are yea suggesting that it is

“iot necessary to reach that?
MR. SOSES:

Ho, no,

1 was about, Mr. Chief Justice,

to discuss that very point, and I will do so now.
The second Flast teat is, of course, the question of
whether the taxpayer has stated a relationship, a nexus between
himself anc the constitutional provision, and it is our position
as wa just suggested it might foe, Mr. Chief Justice, that in
fact this provision is designed for the protection of Congress.
It is designed to give Congress control over executive spending

10
to find, out whet the executive 1b spending and what the execu­
tive is receiving.
X think that is apparent both from the history of this
statute? although the history is not fro© from ambiguity in «11
candor, but X think it is even ®er« apparent from the necessary
construction of this clause in connection with other clauses.
Xn the history, the history is set forth in our brief,
the opposition of r-eorg© Mason and Patrick Henry to this clause
! ' *,.• * r

. •

of the Constitution -ma apparently founded upon the fact that
it might allow secrecy in the expense accounts.

In addition to

that, in a phrase which is perhaps not entirely free from
ambiguity but I think supports the {government * & position here,
In the debate in the Constitutional Convention on this clause,
September 14, which is reported in

2 Farrand’s records,

at page 619, Js'-es Hi Ison of Pennsylvania supported the motion
fee change the provision before the® from accounting year by year,
an annual accounting, to an accounting from tine to time, which
is the praesnt language of the clausa, by saying that many
operations to finance cannot be properly published at certain
times.

But I think we rely loss upon that history, which X

think is incomplete, than wa do upon two other factors.

One is that after that history it. became regular
practice for the Congress to keep some appropriations secret
whan the occasion, the national interest, seeaed to demand it.
Our brief at page 26 points to the fact that there was a

11
sacret appropriation in 183,1 of $100,000F x believe, for the
occupation of Spanish Florida, an act by the Congress which,
obviously had a great deal of sensitivity in Florida affairs.
That appropriation was kept secret for seven years, until 1818
when it was published.
And, of course, the most famous exenple of this kind
of procedure was the $2 hil-Xion secretly spent to develop the
atem bomb and the Manhattan Project during World War 21.
So I think there Is a course of historic practice
which support® the idea that this is the, the reporting is in
the control ox Congress and 1® intended to give Congress con­
trol over what the executive is doing with funds.

Q

Just, for the benefit of Congress, 7, would think

Congress could have provided for that by a law? finding it in
the Constitution, doesn't that suggest that it is designed to
benefit somebody in addition to Congress?

HR. BORIC?
so.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would not think

There are a number of things in the Constitution, I think

which give powers exclusively to Congress and are for the bona
fit of Congress and not. for the benefit of others.

The power

to eapeli members, the power to passe on qualifications, and a
variety of others.

I do not think every constitutional provi­

sion is because it is a constitutional provision necessarily

designed to be enforced by the citizens.

not enforceable by every cltiron who tt&y object to the way

If he does object to the way Congress

enforces it, X think his clear remedy Is to deal with Congress
and try, if he wants the CIA budget published, the .simple matter
is to go to a congressman and, go to his congressman and get
other like-minded citizens to get Congress to require that the
Clh budget be published.

G

Gr to convince Congress «von that It is their

constitutional duty to do so.
MR. BOM;
0

That is correct.

Even if they do not want to.

MR. BORlts

That is correct.

But X think another aspect of this derived from a
consideration of the structure which th© Constitution puts ta
gather indicates that that is the correct reading of this
clausa’.
St would bo exceedingly strange, just in passing, if
the Framers had believed there would never be matters relating
to foreign affairs, would never be matters relating to military
affairs and military intelligence that must not b& disclosed to
the world in full.

That would b© attributing to the Frasiers a

lack of practicality, which X do not think we may attribute to
them.
How, respondent*s brief attempts to find a negative
pregnant in the fact that the Constitution explicitly authorisos in Article 1, Section 5, Clause 3, each House to ka*»p
secret its debates and decisions on matters that'i tribal laves
require secrecy, md respondent argues that they knew how to
provide for secrecy when it was called for, and the fact that

they did not provide for it in the statement and accounts clause
explicitly means it dot?? not exist, power of confidentiality
does nefc exist.

14
I think the necessary inference runs quite the other
way.,

Xt would ba extraordinary if the Framers had intended the

House and the Senate to be able to keep secret matters which
they regarded as sensitive, but at the same time required the
Executive to publish those same matters to the world.
Q

What is the Congress now —

the operation

the Congress itself?

Perhaps it is not rele­

vant,
MR. BOHKs

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I hope it is net,

because X cannot answer the question.
Q

I have the impression that there are complaints

from time to time uttered by various people that Congress does
not ever publish any account of the detailed expenditures.
MR. BGRKr
inquired into

details here.

that that question brings

to

I have not

Perhaps X should say something

mind, and that is fc^at these matt

tens, the CX& funding, is not kept secret entirely from
Congress.

Obviously the matter is sensitive.

The Appropria­

tions Committees of both tha House and the Senate have sub­
committees to which the CIA budget and expenditures are reported
and from time to time in the Sonate there is joint membership

between the Armed Services Committee and the Budget Committee.
So there is a congressional check on this process.

It is just

that it is being wise, I suppose, that matters of this

IS
sensitivity not be given to a body, or rather, bodies of the
size of the House and the full senate.
I think then, it is fairly plain, I think, that the
respondent's claim to standing as a taxpayer does not meet
either tins first or the second Flash test requiring a logical
nexus between his status and the enactment and hi© status and
the Constitution.

And when I think about his claim to standing

hero, it «©eras to rss to b© indistinguishable* from the claim to
standing made in ex parte Levitt, where a citizen and a member
of tho bar of this Court filed & motion, asking that Mr.
Justice Black be required to show cause why h© should not be
disqualified to fee a member of this Court because of Article 1,
Section 5, Claus© S.

And the Court thought so little of that

that they did not sit to discus© generalized grievances about

I

We can see whht the standing is in Article III

St is a doctrine, that relates fuhtosantally to the way

thin Court and the lower federal courts operate

In judicial

review.
It is usually said that standing is an issue of
whether the party is a proper one, whereas justiciability is a
question of whether the issue Is one that Is suitable for a
court to handle.

1 think that does not put It quite accurately.

1 think standing is a branch of justiciability be­
cause it does go, it examines the party only, to discover

17
whether he is a party who will put the issue in a form which
is suitable for judicial resolution, and that makes it, X
think, an aspect or a subdivision of justiciability,

And X

think the Flaat opinion agrees that indeed it is an asp&ct of
justiciability and is an Article XXI doctrine.
It - is also said that the doctrine is one having to
do with whether the issue will be presented with sufficient

tion in some cases,

Ifc is also necessary to admit that it will

not in many, because citizen standing will bo used often by
persons with ideological interest or groups with ideological
interest who will press the case with great vigor.
X am not..®© sure that- the decline in vigor

a

general proble, although it

may be

of

pre­

some

cases.

What standing in the requirement of an injury in fact
actually does Is delay the presentation of the issue to the
Court until the law challenged fees some actual impact upon mem­
bers of the society.

X think that le important for a variety e£

reasons*
On© is that we

plexities that are involved.
So the standing issue aside from being —• it also has
an aspect of fairness fee parties who nay be Interested.

That

is, a party may have a specific injury don® to him and a rule

case But primarily t think the concept is important as a
rule of fairness to the Court.

1 think not just.fairness to the

Court, but the ability of the Court to perform the awesome func­
tion of judicial review with maximum effectiveness.

Wh®n there is citlsen standing and taxpayer standing
generally, it is quite pi«In, X think, that we would have an
Increased nswtoer of groups and persons who would attack statutes
the moment they were enacted» who would attack executive programs
the moment they ware announced, and having standing, they would
find th&mselvos in court debating abstract theorems instantly.
There are two things wrong with that.

X have already

1$
discussed, X think, what 1b wrong with it in terms of the fact
that the issue* h:cq not £xa.tm& wall without a concrete factual

setting, but there is also something wrong ideological litiga­
tion in that lawyers in such litigation often do not applora
the iesuos fully*

They are looking for a sweeping constitution

el result end are likely not to explore narrower statutory or
factual grounds that may &© guibss important to the Court, where
as a person with a personal stake wants to win the ease and
will explore every ground upon which he might win that case*
This kin-5 of standing which would com® immediately
after a law is passed or statute or executive action announced
means that the Court at the behest of such a litigant, an
ideological litigant who does not want to explore all the con­

creto settings — in fact there is no concrete setting —
would in effect repeat the legislative or executive decisionstaking proosos that had just concluded and would probably rea

peat it with fewer materials than were available to the legis­
lature and to the ©rocutive in arriving at the decision.

do not think that that is the Court’0 task in a system of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF OSMOND K. FRAENXEL, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OP THE RESPONDENT
MR. F&YBNKEL:

Mr. Chief Justice/ may it please the

Court s
X think fche Solicitor General has toward the end of
his argument raised a man of straw.

We are not claiming here

the standing should be abolished, and w® agree with that por­
tion of the Solicitor General's argument that if is composed
of two elements, ons-, & constitutional element, resting on the
case in controversy clause $ and, the other, on what this Court
has itself described as a discretionary element In order
perhaps to limit the kind of cases that come to the Court.

In passing, l perhaps should object to the reflection
placed upon what my delightful friend called ideological
lawyers as confusing the issues, I,don't think that is a fair
description of their function,

X think ideological lawyers

have done a great deal in the past to help this Court reach

an understanding of the problems raised by the Bill of Rights
particularly.

But that is not this ease.

Ws submit that in this case both tests are mat.

What

plaintiff sought her© was a compliance with the Constitution
by the inclusion in the public reports of some reference, at
least, to the finances of the CIA.

That is what ha asks for,

and that is what was refused him, and we submit that that is a
case in controversy,

He was seeking information frees the

26

government,
Mow, clearly, if that information had been deniad him,
we will say, because he was a member of some minority grotxp or
was politically distasteful to the administration, information
otherwise available, clearly the courts would have the right
to pass on that,.

And if Congress had passed a law denying

information on that score, clearly this Court could pass on
that lav.
G

Do you think, Mr, Fr&enfce1, that there would be

the same standing and tbs same justiciability in a claim
brought by a taxpayer, your client, for & full statement of
accounts, receipts and disbursements on the building of the
Rayburn Building, for assampla?
HR. FRABKSBJl:

Ho*

Ho.

1 will agree that there must

be sons discretion vastsd somswhsre && to the nature of the
details.

But it 1b one thing to aay that inforrmafcion nvsy be

categorized? it is another thing to say that Congress can by
lav take rut of what the Constitution says the public is en­
titled to have,

And the question that this Court will have to

consider, therefore, when we come back from lunch, is to whafc
extent the constitutional provision does require aoawa account­
ing by overy branch of government, bearing in mind that history
shows that the framers of the Constitution both in the conven­
tion and in the state conventions which considered it later,
recognised that there might be delay In publication of certain

27
sensitive matters , as of course is the case with the two in­
stances mentioned by the Solicitor General.

MR. PR&JSKKELj

Wall, X will have to deal with that

after lunch,
Q

— 2 era not sure how relevant it las, but X was

juat wondering why the clause does not reach the Congress and
the courts, as well as the Executive Branch.
MR. FRAENKBL:

Oh, X think the clause reaches all

agencies of government, but the question, Mr. Chief Justice,
which you have just raised as to what extent the particular
details, a® for instance whether it would be necessary to
publish every appropriation made for every employee —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

m. CHIEF JUSTICE BtmoSBs

Mr. Fraenicel, von i&ay

proceed *
MS* FRnEKIXSL:

To come back to your question, Hr.

Chief Justice, X suppose if we

om

to the merits of this case,

1 think if I am correct ©a at/ Issue of standing, the District
Court will corae to, as in Mr* Justice Rehnquisi's question
earlier, I think that will go back to the District Court.

Than

the question will erica what constitutionally can Congress do
in fulfilling fcfe» mandate of the Constitution, an<5 X would
suppose there would be some room for discretion m to data!Is
but not $fA to categorias.
Xn other words, if the public is, as we believe,
entitled under the Constitution to public information about

what tha. government does, that at least has to be outlined in
broad terms and no department of gowrsaaent can, in our view,
be constitutionally excluded frora the details account.

Jlcw,

how detailed that would be, I don't think becomes a constitu­
ti on « 1 ernestion*
Tl® Solicitor General has relied on

three eases,

basically

First, he says we are doomed fey Fleet.

we don't read Float that way.

Well,

Sow, it is true, of course, that

there is language in Flash, written with an eye to the parfcicu~

ir-.r: problem, that was presented by Plast, and that language has
to be construed in relation to that problem

which did arise

29
under the establishment clause of the Fifth Amendment.

And

when the court talked about that as being th© consideration, of
course it was fch© consideration.

But X do not believe that

the court intended to say that that is th© only thing which a
taxpayer could ever challenge.

Certainly th© Levitt case has

no bearing on this whatever, because there is nothing in th©

„

Levitt cade to indicate any connection between the individual
who brought the proceeding and the appointment of Hr. Justice
Black, whereas here it is the direct connection between th©
individual who brought the suit and the refusal to give him

th© information which ho claimed he was entitled to under the
Constitution *
0

v?as

in Levitt

Well, the applicant or the mover or whoever he

was a member of the bar of this Court, interested

in being an officer of this Court that was constitutionally
valid.
KR, FRAEJSKBLs

0hf yes, and there are many other

questions which, ae has boon pointed out., for instance, the

legality of tit© republican form of government which every
individual oitisen ie interested in, but which can probably
be-cowa a subject of litigation only when because of th© denial
of that form of government by some statu th© individual if
subjected to impediments which th© Bill of Bights protects
him against, and h*t would then have redraw© .

Q

But then that would be under the. Bill of Rights

30
and not under the republican form of government clausa.
HR. FRAE5JKEL?

That ia true# and that ©£ course brings

us to the question which I don’t think can be decided or should
be decided her©, whether this provision of the Constitution ia
purely political, which was. one of the grounds of the District
Court’s dismissal.

1 don’t think we need reach that point or

r

•

.

'•

should reach that point, because it is unnecessary for a reso­
lution of the standing question, ii my view is correct that a
request for information which is supposedly granted by the
Constitution does create a judicial has©»

And that is all this

standing amounta to.
Q

If X nay refer for a moment to the Levitt case,

it would certainly be of considerably more than academic
interest to the bar and to the public if one member of the court
was not a lawful member of the court when it cams either to the
problem of grants of writs in the present day or in S-fco-4
decisions.

Would that give the degree of concrete**®»»?
MR. FRAENKEL:

Well, I would say that 1 suppose it la

a matter of general interest to the public of this country
whether one of our present executives could b© subject to
impeachment perhaps, but X don’t think anyone could contend
that the individual could bring a proceeding towards that and.becaus® th© Constitution provides that Congress shall determine
that and the Constitution provides that a Justice of this
Court shall be approved by the Senate.

And I think appointed

31
by the President and approved by the Senate, the constitutional
provisions have been complied with, it seems to me.

Q

Similarly , at least the claim of the government

would undoubtedly be, if it isn't already, that the constitu­
tional clause in question her© has been implemented by Congress
by a statute that permits a general rather than & detailed
annual account or periodic account.
HR. PRSEISKELj

With a particular statute which «e

say Congress had no power to enact, because it excluded, it
didn't merely describe categories, but it excluded an import­
ant organ of government from any disclosure.

G

But couldn’t it just disclose, eg they did in

Levitt, that the. Senate had no power to confirm Justice Black
because he had voted to increase the emolument of the office
which was something that the Constitution then prohibited him
from taking?
MR. FSthKNKELs

Well, I would say that if the

Constitution, th® provision of the Constitution that we are
now considering- said that the accounts of agencies of th©
government shall be published fee the ertont that Congress may
provide, then of course Congress' decision could not be sub­
jected in tbs way that w® are attaching here, and therefore it
bogs the question to say that Congress had the power to exclude
an agency of government,

That is what the Court has to decide.

That is the issue, and it wasn't in ray opinion anything like

32

such an issua in J&vitt.

And than Laird v. Tatum was cited, but of course in
Laird v. Tatum this Court was vary careful to point out that
the particular plaintiffs did not ghtw any injury to themselves,
as in the Sierra case, for instance, leaving open deary the
possibility that other parsons who «light be affected either by
the surveillance of the Array or by environmental disturbances
would have standing.
Now, that is not the situation here,

Ho one would

have any better standing hare than this plaintiff, and this
Court has on a number of occasions stated that standing can
arise because of the circumstance that no one else could raise
the issue.
For instance, in the Uhod© Island so-called censorship
case, tills Court expressly said that the booksellers there who
were not. directly effected had standing because otherwise the
basic issues of .freedom of speech involved might never ba
presented to the Court.

And of course the same is true in the'

NAAC? v. Alabamaf and in Barrows, where the question arose as
to tia impact of a restrictive covenant, whether a white person
could raise the issue if such a covenant discriminated agstnst
Negroes >,

This Court ruled that he could because otherwise

that issue couldn’t fcts raised at all.
So we com© back then to the basic issue hare,
.0 the right to knew important not only to a taxpayer but to a

33
cltiaen»

And X think that recent events in this country have

clearly demonstrated how important it is for the people of
this country to know what their government is doing»
0

Mr. Fraenkel', on the point of the right of the

public, to know ah out expandi turea fey the Congress# the
Solicitor General mentioned a Manhattan project in World War II.
Would it bo your position that a taxpayer would have had stand­
ing to force a divulgance of the funda that were than being
appropriated for that project at that time?
MR. FRAENKEL:

X think that in time of war many

consideratione exist which do not otherwise.

Certainly troop .
i

movements can fee kept secret from the press, various things of
that kind are tolerated in time of war, which would not be
tolerated in time of peace.
G

Would you think it perhaps equally important to

have information, our government to have information that
might prevent war?
MR. MtAENKELs

they have information*

Well, of course, it is important that
^he question of course is how much of

that: information can legitimately fee kept secret from the
people arid then maybe & period of time during which it can

properly be kept secret, as X 'think is recognised by some of
the discussion in the. conventions at the time of the adoption
of the Constitution.

But w© ar© dealing here with an agency

which has been in existence now for some twenty-five years»

Wa haven't argued the

Mr. Frwmfcel, I still don't understand why you

say we don't — we would not be compelled to reach the political
question issue if we agreed with you on standing.

MR. PRAENKEL:
Q

Wall, if you —

Because the Court of Appeals did reverse the

judgment of the District Court and afc least dealt with standing,
dealt with the political question to the extent of holding that
it wasn't right that it was intertwined with the merits.
MR. FRAENKEL:

Now --

This Court has the — I am at s loss

to find the right word to say — the privilege> ntay X say, of
deciding anything that this Court thinks should be decided.
That has happened before.

1 just don't think it need b© de­

Q

Mall, if we affirm the judgment of the Court of

appeals, we are also affirming their judgment that the
political question doctrine did not justify the dismissal by
the District Court.
MR. FE&EHK32L:

you are affirming their judgments m

to two questions that era closely intertwined and should be
reconsidered by the District Court in that light.

affirming their dealing with the political question 'to that

MR. FRAEUKKL:

And since this Court on the whole tries- to

avoid things it doesn’t need to do, X suggest we stick to the

Are you -suggesting that we really should decide

something without saying so?

MR. FRASNKSLs

Well, that happens all the. time.

Every

time a judgment is affinaad, you decide that the lower--court
was correct, and sometimes you do if without saying anything.

Q

Yes, I have your view, yes.

MR. PRUSNKSL;

MR. FR&ESIKgti

it is not necessary, I think,

That's right.

it is not the opinion that ia affirmed.

MR. mm:

That’s right.

Well, the judgment ia

affirmed because the judgment ia one remanding the matter to
the District Court for further consideration of the whole
issue,
Q

Mr. Fr&enfcel, do you think there is a fairly

sharp line between the concept of standing and the concept of
political question?
MR. FRAEKKSlit

Well, I assume that if the question

is purely political then the court will say no one has standing
to- raise® it.

That was of course the situation for a long time

with the question of challenges to reapportioroaent.

This Court

©aid for a long time that that was a political question, and
that was the end of it.

Then came Baker v. Carr and this

progeny and there, in the first really modern decision, this

MR. FRAENKSLi

In any case, there are certain issues

which I assume are so tenuous, that can be formulated with such

question of the guarantee of the republican form of government,
that —
Q

Wo11, that was pretty well exploded, wasn’t it,

MR. RPAENKELt

It was the

FRAEKKEL?

But it was taking property without due

Q

Well# that is part of the republican form, of

government, X suppos®.
MR. FR&OTSLs

Well, every violation of the Bill of

Rights could b© argued fco he a denial of republican form of

39
government»

xn any event» to corns back to what we consider

to be the elements hare» a demand for information, a refusal
of that information, the refusal justified by an act of
Congress which on its face at least appears to fly in the face
of the direct demand of the Constitution.

It is hard to say

how there can be any clearer case of a person having an
interest in obtaining important information.
Now# it is Raid by my opponents that ho doesn't
claim that his tax monies are directly involved# as did the
taxpayer in Flash claim that hia monies were being improperly
expended.

But of course any taxpayer is interested vitally

in knowing how his tax monies are being spent, and in Flash
he knew the facts which enabled him to make a constitutional
challenge.

We don't know here whether the facts might not

just glow as a basis for scm© constitutional challenge with
respect to the expenditure of the monies.

But certainly &

taxpayer is as much interested in knowing in order to properly
perform his function as a citixeo, which is involved as well
as being a taxpayer#

and what has happened in the past in

order to determine how ho should act in the future.
The suggestion by the Solicitor General that this
would open the floodgates to all kinds of litigation I submit
is without any justification.

Here is no sudden rushing into

court to get some basic principle established the minute the
Executive had done something or a law has been passed.

As I

40
said, this agency has bean in existence for twenty-five years.

U&m is no ideological expedition into philosophic notions -«*
a very practical matter of a tasrpayer wanting to know what has
been done with his money, claiming that under the Constitution
he has a right to know, claiming that Congress has arbitrarily
interfered with that right by an exclusionary statute.

Now,

whether the right had the right to pass that, exclusionary
statute is something which the Court will have to determine on
remand, as t think this Court will, X certainly hope it will
affirm the decision below.
Thank, you.
