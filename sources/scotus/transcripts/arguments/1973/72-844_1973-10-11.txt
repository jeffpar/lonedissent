MR. CHIMB1 JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear

arguments next in docket Mo. 72-344, E* E. Falk et al
versus Peter J. Brennan, Secretary of Labor.
Mr. Kelly, you nay proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF
HERBERT V. KELLY
MR. KELLY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

txie Court:
Briefly as to the factual matters, Drucker and
Falk is a real estate, insurance and property management
firm that operates in Eastern Virginia.

It manages one and

two-story apartment projects, the smallest of which is
probably in the 30 to 40 unit area and they run up to units
that are covered under the Act and not a part of
Each project is separately owned.

this suit.

Each owner

has an independent contract with Drucker and Falk as to the
management of the premises and as to its services and the
contract generally calls for Drucker and Falk to manage
through resident — to manage a property and manage the
maintenance by resident maintenance superintendents.
There are maintenance employees in each project
that are on the payrolls of the owner of the project who stay
at that project in the main, with some very unusual

exceptions and, in effect, go with the property.
It is the position of Drucker and Falk in this
case that the Secretary of Labor has taken an illusory and
strained definition of the Fair Labor Standards Act to reach
down and include the employees of the apartment project as
covered under the Act where they could not reach down to then
except through the rental agent and that they are there by
bootstrapping themselves into coverage where it does not
exist.
Factually, as presented here, unless you include
the gross rental income as income of Drucker and
would be no coverage under the Act.

Falk, there

In addition, unless you

include the employees who work at the projects and there is
no coverage of Drucker and Falk under the Act.

It is our

position that you have to strain and come up with illusory
results in order to Include the rental income and include
the employees.
It is our position with the first matter of income
tnafc income to Drucker and Falk i3 the gross commission,
khere are four or six commission on the rentals and that that
is the measure of their sales.
It is our position, therefore, that what they are
selling is services and that what they get paid for the
services is their commission and it is our position that you
look at this from three different directions.

One, you can look at the provisions of the
statute with regard to what is sales.

You can look at the

intent of Congress with regard to what is sales or you can
look at the legal conclusions that you come to after
applying common lav; principles to the facts involved.
First, with regard to the statute Itself, the
statute has a definition of sale, of which the Court is
well aware, which says that a sale is a sale.
sale.

It is any

It says that"A sale is any sale, exchange,

consignment for sale, shipment for sale or other disposition
The statute goes on further to say that an
enterprise is covered and that enterprise is ’'Any enterprise
whose — whose annual sales"

and I emphasise the "whose" —

"volume of sales meets the test," which, in this case, is

^1300,000.
Petitioner suggests

to the Court that, certainly

the definition that I have read to you of sale

does not

cover what sale in this instance means.
Now, the Fourth Circuit found some comfort in the
last three words which were, "Or other disposition."

It is

our position that "other disposition" can only apply to a
disposition of what you are selling and what Drucker and
Falk is selling is their services and the measure of that is
the income to them, their commissions for the services which
they are selling.

6
The gross volume of sales made or business dons is
what is sold by the agent, his services.

He cannot sell for

himself what is not his and what he sells for the owners is
the owners' sale.

And what the Secretary of Labor has tried

to do is call the owners5 sales his sales.

So under that

definition, there is no definition which would include the
factual situation presented to the Court in this case.
If we turn to the intent of Congress, I don't
think it is even necessary to argue to the Court that it was—
tnat the Congressional Reports and the Statements of the
Secretary of Labor in amending the statute were such that the
intent of Congress was to set the monetary limits with regard
to what they felt was impact on commerce.
The d'JOQjOOO in this instance, they felt, was
sufficient to be an impact on commerce and therefore, you
had bigness and it was the intent of Congress to include the
big and leave out the small.

It, by way of example, I could,

say, it seems apparent that it was their Intent to include the
owner and his saie3 from the owner of the World Trade Center
in Chicago, but not to include the owner of the Strip Center
in Stoney Creek, Virginia and it seems to me you have to
strain and reach an illusory conclusion if you conclude that
by happenstance the Strip operator in Stoney Creek, Virginia
is employing a branch office of the real estate agent in
Chicago who runs the World Trade Center and thereby he is

7
in commerce,

That is a strained conclusion which is

contrary to the obvious intent of Congress,
Thirdly, if we turn strictly to common law
principles, it seems to the Petitioner that the rentals do
not fit any definition that would say that that was the gross
sales of the agent.

The rentals do not belong to Drucker

and Falk, they belong to that apartment project ox^ner.
Drucker and Falk does not control the property
nor the rentals except as agents.
collected, is not theirs.

The rent, which is

It is put in a trust account, in

and out, and they stand in even more of a fiduciary position
rather than a debtor and creditor position because they hold
those sums in trust for the owner whose income is rentals
and not that of Drucker and PAlk and the sums are distri­
buted, we would suggest, under the direction and control of
the owner a.nd not of Drucker and Falk.
Q

On this issue, the courts of appeals have given

that theory hard going, haven’t they?
FiR. KELLY:

Yes, sir, but I don’t think there

was any basis for giving it hard going.

Actually, the

court of appeals decided, in the main, based on the VJirtz
versus First national Bank in

which they say that in that

case it was concluded that rental income is sales.
problem with that at all.
question of whose sales.

I agree with that.

I have no

It is a.

8
Q

I don’t mean just the Fourth Circuit.

I mean

all the courts of appeals that have decided it have gone the
other way.

Am I correct on that?
I-’R. KELLY:

Well, it has only been decided by two

on the same principle, yes, sir.

The case is that a number of

cases, which I would suggest do not apply in this case, have
ruled — and if you look at either one of the cases, you will
see that they summarily dispose of it by saying it has already
been decided in the such and such case that rental income is
sales and I have no argument with that at all.

There is no

question about that.
The question is, whose sales?
And we are saying that it is the sales of the
owner, not the sales of the Petitioners in this case.
Q

Well, does the rental agent’s activities consti­

tute an enterprise, within the meaning of the Act?
Mft. KELLY:

X think that you have decided that it

did in Arnheim and Mealy and I think that —
Q

Yes, yes, so the real question is, what the income

of the enterprise is, isn’t it?
MR. KELLY:
rental Income is sales.

Yes, sir and the question is whether the
It is not a question of income.

You

are covered if your total sales is in excess of $500,000 and
the statute says, whose sales and you have got to conclude,
for their to be liability, that this is a sale on the part of

9
Drucker and Falk as ad versus a sale on the part of the
owners and where the court of appeals —
Q

Well, he made a sale,

lie earned a commission for

making a 3ale.
MR. KELLY:

Yes, sir, and his sale — what he sells,

the owner is selling the premises.

He signs the lease.

What

he gives to the tenant is —
Q

The rental agent made a sale and he earned a

commission.
MR. KELLY:

Yes, sir, and what he sold were his

services.
Q

lie sold the ovmer's property.
MR. KELLY:

Q

Sir?

He sold the owner’s property.
MR. KELLY:

In a sense.

Well, he is advisor and assistant to

the owner in selling his property, yes, sir.
Q

Or did he sell his own services?
MR. KELLY;

He sold his services as advisor and

assistant, is v;hat he is selling, but you can certainly
carry that as far as Mr. Justice White has gone and say, in
effect, by advising him, he is helping him to sell.

But he

is selling his product, which is his services and his sale is
service.

His advisory help may help the owner to get his

sales in, but the courts of appeals went off on these cases
saying we have already decided that this is sales and did not

10

consider the question of whose sales and the statute says,
"An enterprise whose sales,"

And you have got to define those

sales and we suggest under common lav; principles that these
sales are selling what you have to offer which, in the case of
Drucker and Falk is its sex-vices as a managing agency.
how, the other position that we have taken in the
case is that it was improper to consider the employees who
were working at the projects as maintenance people maintaining
the project, employees of Drucker and Falk.
It is our position that they are employees of the
owner.

They work for the owner.

He is their — he pays their

wages; he keeps their records; he turns in the reports that
need be taken and the employee is the employee of owner of
project and not the employee of Drucker and Falk and we say
this knowing that there is a definition In the statute which
says that an employer includes any person acting directly or
indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an
employee.
definition.

And we do not deny that Drucker and Falk fit that
They are an employer under that definition.

But

you must go further than that under the Act because that is
just a definition.

What the Act says is, under 6(a) and 6(b)..

"Every employer shall pay to each of his employees."
7(a) "Shall employ any of his employees."

Under

And v/e suggest to

you — we admit that he fits the definition of employer, but
we say to you that he is not — the employee is not his

11
employee when you are talking about Drucker and Falk.

He is

his employee with reference to the project where he works and
there is nothing so unusual about this argument. Otherwise,
there are
we come to a strange conclusion in the law that/a great
multitude of people who would be liable under this Act for
compliance with the Act because that definition, anyone who
acts directly or indirectly in the interest of the employer,
you would include every supervisor that you include under
National Labor Relations Act case.

A supervisor, under the

Act, is one who has the right to effectively hire, fire or
vote or otherwise and all those sort of people are acting,
fit the definition, "Includes any person who acts directly
or indirectly in the interests of an employer in relation to
an employee."
Q

If each of those were required to pay

the

employee the sum specified in the statute, the employee
would have a pretty high pay, wouldn’t he?
HR, KELLY:

Yes, sir, he certainly would and the

point I am making is that if you say, just because he fits
the definition of an employer, that it is his employee, then
you take, for instance, in the gambit with General Motors
you’ve got the president of General is his employer, the
head of the stenographic pool, who runs the pool and may have
the right to hire and fire —
Q

That’s the employer.
HR. KELLY:

— the ladies in the stenographic

12

pool would fit the definition of employer but I don’t think
that Congress intended that she would be considered as an
employer under the definition "his employee" under the Act.
Q

So your argument is that in General Motors, a

man with every employee would have a thousand employer?
HR. KELLY:
Q

Yes, sir, exactly.

Why, you are not telling me that anybody goes that

far, are you?
MR. KELLY:

Wo, sir, I’m not telling you that

anybody goes that far.
Q

Are you saying anybody will go that far?
MR. KELLY:

Yes, sir, I am saying to you that the

court of appeals in considering this matter in Arnheim said
that the definition in the statute says an employer is so and
so and therefore there is coverage and that the Third Circuit
should —
Q

But do you think that that court or any other

court would go that far as to say

that one employee has

a thousand employers?
MR. KELLY:

Wo, sir, I am saying to you that they

would go that far and stop and find coverage here when they
should have kept on going to determine whether it was his
employee or not.
I am saying to you, if you please, that the foreman
and his employee, in the event of bankruptcy will be looking,

13
both, to that company that went bankrupt for their wages.
They are not employers.
Q

A lot of companies I know go bankrupt, but the

foremen retire.
MR. KELLY:

Yes, sir.

The Fourth Circuit, in deciding a case, Mr. Justice
Marshall, took care of this, decided it on the basis that
there were some cases which had found liability on the part
of the agent and cited one or two and these are the cases
which are cited in the Government’s brief, where they say
this has already been decided.

I suggest that in each of

those cases, the question of whether the agent is an
employer or whether they are his employees has not been
decided.
In all of those cases, the parties defendant
included the owner of the premises and, secondarily,
included the rental agent and in each case, the court
disposes of the rental agency after finding liability on
the part of the owner by saying, if the owner is liable,
the derivity of agency liability applies and the agent Is
liable just the same as the owner.

But in our particular

case, there has been no proceedings against the owner and,
therefore, we haven’t found any liability.

As a matter of

fact, I assume it is pretty well conceded by the Government
that there is no liability on the owner of these projects.

Q

That is what proceedings against the owner

would entail.
MR. KELLY:

Yes, sir, because it didn't meet it

so what they have done is used an Illusory coverage to reach
down in and bootstrap up these people who wouldn't be
covered by saying

that the people work for Drucker and Falk

and by saying that the income of Drucker and Falk or sales
of Drucker and Falk is the rental.
And I say to you, if you please, that you just
don’t have an Act where an owner can control whether he is
covered by the Act or not.

Because if that be so, this man

can go in and out of agents four times a year.

He can be

in and out of coverage just as often as he wants to get a
new agent and we suggest that that was not the intent of
Congress nor was it the intent of the statute.
And I would save what time I have, if I may.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Kelly.

Mr. Frey.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF
ANDREW L. FREY
MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
To begin xcLth, I'd like to point out, in line with
what Mr. Justice Blackmun noted earlier, that both of the
issues that are here before the Court today have been before

15
four different courts of appeals and in each instance there
have been unanimous decisions in favor of the Government’s
position.
Obviously, in the case below, on the Fourth
Circuit on both issues, on Arnheim and Neely in the Third
Circuit on both issues.
With respect to the rent commissions issue, the
First National Bank

case in the Tenth Circuit and in the

Jernigan case in the Fifth Circuit, unanimous decisions
holding that you don't look simply at the commissions that
are earned, but at the rentals or, in the case of Jernigan,
the ticket sales of bus tickets.
In the case of the employment issue, you have the
Second Circuit decision in Arsenal Building and you have a
rather significant decision of the D.C. Circuit in the
Herbert Harvey case which I’ll get to ivhen I discuss the
employment issue.
I'd also like to point out that we are not
dealing here with a small business.

Drucker and Falk

manages 30 apartment projects and they employ, that is, they
hire, supervise and discharge, over 100 persons in connection
with this venture.
They procure annual rentals in excess of $8 million.
We are not talking about any Mom and Pop operation.
How, taking up the rent and commissions issue

16
first, I have no difficulty with —
Q

That has significance only when you reach the

conclusion that it is one enterprise, doesn’t it?
MR. PREY:

Well, no.

The Court has decided in

Arnheim and Neely that the management company conducts a
single enterprise which consists of its building management
operations.
Q

That flows from Arnheim.
MR. PREY:

That was decided in Arnheim and Neely .

Row, the question on the rent commissions issue, for
instance, is how do you determine the size?

How do you

measure the dollar volume?
Q

Let’s assume, Mr. Prey, that you had a gross sales

tax of some kind in a state which was 3 per cent of the gross
income of an enterprise.

On what would that 3 per cent tax

rest in this circumstance?
MR. PREY:

Well, it would rest on income and, of

course, that is a very significant distinction because this
case does not turn in any way on the enterpriser’s income.
The Congressional test was not put on the basis of income or
on the basis of income, Penn Central or Lockheed or people
like that would not have to pay the minimum wap’e.
Q

It would be, to answer the question, I suppose

you would have to say it i*ould rest on the commission, not —
MR. PREY:

The income would, of course, be the

17
commission.
Q

—on the total rentals.
MR. PREY:

No question about that, but that is

not the statutory standard for coverage.
Q

And then the gross income, the gross sales tax

would rest on the —
MR. PREY:
Q

Would rest on the sales.

— owners in terms of what they received, I

suppose, if the tax problem were reached here.
MR. PREY:

Not at all.

If you had — suppose you

nad a consignment store which sold goods on consignment or
suppose you had a a jeweler, which usually does not own the
jewelry that they are selling, but has it on — it is called
"on memorandum" from some larger jeweler.

When he sells that

he collects the full sales tax and he is responsible for
paying that full sales tax to the taxing party.
Q

And he also collects the full purchase price.
MR. PREY:

He collects the full purchase price.

And he must remit —
Q

Sure.
MR. PREY:

— the portion that belongs to the

original owner of the jewelry or of the consigned merchandise
Q

Mr. Prey, in trying to understand your response to

the Chief Justice's question, in terms of, if the gross
income were the case, then Penn Central and Lockheed wouldn't

18
have to pay the minimum wane because, certainly, they have
gross income that would bring them within the standards,
don't they?
Q

You are talking about net income, aren't you?
MR. PREY:

Well, I suppose that is true but, in

any event, income is not the standard.
Q

It’s gross sales.

Q

But it is gross sales.
MR. PREY:

Q

Yes, it is sales made or business done.

And in many businesses, gross sales and gross

income are pretty close together.
MR. PREY:
Q
may be far

That could be, yes.

But in some businesses, however, gross income
greater than gross sales.
MR. PREY:

Well, that could be, also.

I’ll retract.

I don’t think it matters in the context of the statute with
which we are dealing here, which is the context in which we
must take the case.
Mow, nobody disputes that the rental of property
is a sale.

I think that is conceded.

who is it who makes the sales?

The question, then, is

Is there some sense in which

we can say, well, this is not Drucker and Falk’s sale.
is the building owner's sale.
all, we submit that you

This

Well, we submit that — first of

don't have to say either it is

Drucker and Falk's sale or it is the building owner’s sale

19
because there are many situations, as with the consignment
sale situation, where both parties may have made a sale.
how, in this case, the building owners might as
well be on the moon or on the bottom of the ocean for all
that they have to do with selling this rental property.

It

is Petitioners who advertise vacant apartments, who Interview
prospective tenants, v/ho negotiate leases, who evict people
for nonpayment of rent, who handle every aspect of the
transaction between the building and the tenant.
Q

Well, Isn't the rental agent the agent of the

owner?
MR. PREY:

Well, there is a sense in which he is

the agent of the owner.
Q

Well, isn’t he acting on his behalf, and doesn’t

he have authority to sign a binding lease on behalf of the
owner?
MR. PREY:
Q

Oh, yes.

Don’t you usually talk about the

agent's acts as

acts of the principal?
IIR. PREY:
Q

Well, I don't think — I think it Is —

The sales are the acts of whatever principal he

happens to be acting for.
MR. FREY:

Well, if we were asking ourselves the

more difficult question of whether we could reach the
building owner and attach these sales to him, even though he

20

has nothing to do with it, we could say, yes, he has retained
these people as an agent.
independent business.

But,

of course, they have an

They are not purely an agent in the

sense —
Q

Their only business is to earn their commission.

I mean, that is their business.
MR. PREY:

Well, their business is to rent

property.
Q

Their business is management.

selling services.

That is their business.

MR. PREY:
Q

It is management

Ho, they have two —

Thst is the only business they have.
MR. PREY:

They sell services.

Ho, I think we have to make a basic distinction
because there are two kinds of sales involved here.

It is

true that they sell their services to the building owner.
And the proper —
Q

Yes, and they act on his behalf In renting the

property.
MR. PREY:

Well, but the proper measure of their

sale of services to the building owner is unquestionably their
commission.

We don't dispute that.

also sell the property.

The point is that they

It is true they do it on behalf of

the building owner but, nevertheless, they sell it.
Q

They are not selling their property.

They are

21
selling somebody else's property.
MR. PREY:

That is true but that makes no

difference under the statute.
Q

That is the issue.

Q

That is the issue, isn't it?
MR. PREY:

Q

Our contention —

That is the issue,
MR. PREY:

yes.

Well, our contention is that it makes

no difference under the statute.
Q

Well, why doesn’t it?
MR. FREY:

1966

In the 1966 — in the —

The Renate Report accompanying the

Amendments, which is set forth at paces 16 and 17 of

our brief, the Committee explained the dollar volume test
and they said that it was intended to measure the size of an
enterprise in terms of the business transactions which result
from the activities of the enterprise as measured by the
purchase price paid by the purchaser.
Nov;, I find it very hard to dispute the empirical
conclusion that these leases of property are business
transactions that arise from the activities of petitioner’s
enterprise and that is the standard and if you look behind it
in terms of the Congressional policy that underlay setting a
dollar volume cut-off point, Congress v;as concerned with the
impact on commerce and whether the building owner himself -if someone owned all 30 of these buildings and conducted this

22
sales operation

of rental space or if he was acting as an

agent for different owners and conducted this sales operation
of rental space, in both cases you would have the same impact
on the flow of goods and men across state lines, the same
impact on commerce.
Congress chose an objective, external standard.
Yes, Mr. Chief Justice?
Q

Would a real estate sales organization come within

the reach of this Act if it had over $500,000 and so forth?
MR. FREY:

Yes.

Well, the position of the

Administrator would be — and it has been held by —
Q

I'll put this question to you, then.

Suppose you

have a real estate agency of, as many of them do, a hundred
agents in their operation, selling houses.

Would it be your

view that you would mea.sure the enterprise by the gross sales
of houses?
MR. FREY:

Yes, by the dollar amount of the sales.

Yes, certainly.
Mow, let me point out that we do make a
distinction which I think is relevant here between rental
collection agents and people such as Petitioner's, or
9

businesses such as Petitioner’s.

The rental collection agent

who goes around and collects rent is only selling his services
in collecting rent and the Department of Labor would measure
his enterprise size by the commission that he earns and that

23
is because he does not sell the rental property.
Q

What about the insurance agent selling policies

and that over a period of time, the premiums are going to be
a certain amount of money?

But all he does is earn a

commission?
MR. FREY:

Well, it would be the amount of the

premiums, I would believe, by which you would measure. Even
though some of the premiums are —
Q

Well, any agent, any insurance agent who sells

insurance policies where the premiums are not more than
$500,000 although his commission may be $20,000, is
covered?
MR. FREY:
Q

Yes, that is right.

Now, has that been the law?
MR. FREY:

I believe that is consistently the law.

The closest case that I know to it is slightly different.

It

is the Montalvo case in which —
Q

Well,

isn’t that the same question as is

involved here?
MR. FREY:
question.

Well, yes, that would be the same

It would be the same — let’s take gasoline

service stations, which are a common example.

Many gasoline

stations do not own the gasoline that they sell.
to the oil company.

It is consigned to them.

It belongs

When they sell

it, they earn a certain number of cents per gallon on the

2*1

sale.

The rest of the proceeds belong to the oil company.
Now, under Petitioner’s rationale, you would

measure the sales of this gas company by the amount of
commission it earned and you would ignore what the purchaser
paid, despite the fact that the Senate report says that it is
what the purchaser paid.
Q

Isn’t there a difference when something is placed

in the exclusive possession of the dealer on consignment and
management?
MR. PREY:

These buildings are placed in the

exclusive possession of Drucker and Falk for purposes of —
Q

I'm talking for purposes of possession of the

tenants, by the very definition of the tenancy. They are
the second owners.
MR. PREY: Oh, yes, well, so is the gasoline in
the possession of the person vrho buys it, once he buys it.
Q

Well, I don’t see how the buyer gets into this.
MR. PREY:

Q

Well, because —

We are talking about the — you were making an

analogy between the operator of the filling station and the
manager of this management company.
MR. PREY:
Q

That is correct.

Nov/, the management company does not have the

ownership and the exclusive possession or the exclusive
possession of the building.
MR. PREY:

Well, with respect to unrented premises,

and we*XI start off with a vacant premise or a new building
which is turned over to them and which is empty, they have
the exclusive possession of that building for purposes of
selling it to tenants, just like the gas station has the
gasoline.
Now, when it is sold, that is, when a tenant signs
a lease and moves in, they and the building owners both lose
their possession of the premises for the term of the lease.
Q

Now, going back to the real estate analogy, if

there is any analogy to it, your theory would bring a very
small real estate agency under the — within reach of the
Act.

Two good men, sometimes one man, will sell a million

dollars worth of dwellings in one year and, certainly, two
men, if they are good at their trade, will sell a million
dollars worth a year.

So you would have a two-man organization

with a telephone operator answering the phone who would be
under the Act.

Is that — do you think that is the reach

of the Act?
MR. PREY:

Yes, I think that is correct and so

would, let's say, a relatively small car dealership might or
a grocery store.

Anything where there is a small profit

margin, a two-man business where, let’s say, both individuals
are making $30 or $40,000 a year is likely to generate gross
sales in excess of $1300,000 and Congress, that is what
Congress provided.

We are simply attempting to carry out

26
what we —
Q

But you are saying flatly — because I simply

don't know and want to know — that a one-man real estate
office with a secretary having a million dollars sales a year
is under the Act?
HR. PREY:
commerce, yes.
connection also.

If it is an enterprise engaged In

I mean, there has to be the commerce
It has to have employees engaged in

commerce, which is a somewhat different problem.
How, In 1961 when Congress adopted the enterprise
concept, they referred to real estate firms as

one of the

businesses that would come within the coverage of the Act
4

and It is a little hard for me to imagine that they were
thinking that commissions would be the measure since there
were relatively few who would have met the one million
dollar standard at that time, but many real estate firms that
would have met the one million dollars as measured by the
volume of sales or rentals.
The key is that this is approached on an empirical
basis.

You look at who makes the sale, who physically does

the selling operation.

Now, the district court and Petitioners

in their brief have attempted to analogize this situation to
bank deposits or to loans that may be closed by lawyers.
Those are completely different.

The banks' volume of

business is not in any way measured by deposits.

That is not

27

considered a sale by the bank.

What the bank sells is the

use of money when it loans money and when the bank makes a
loan, we don’t measure, even there, the size of its
enterprise by the face amount of the loan but, rather, what
they are selling, which is the use of the money, which is
measured by the interest.
loan
Similarly with the law firm, they are not selling
the loan.

All they are selling are their services in

connection with the loan and, therefore, you measure it by
their fee.
Now, the fact that a big and a small business are
associated together in an enterprise as here, Petitioners in
their business of managing and renting real property and the
building owners in their business of investing money in real
estate, it is true that the building owner standing alone
would be exempt but there it is not uncommon to have an
exempt and a nonexempt person in a joint enterprise in a
joint relationship with an employee and, therefore, the
employee is covered.
The purpose of the Act is to protect employees who
happen to be employed in enterprises that are large enough to
come within the coverage.

The fact that they may also be

employed at the same time in a smaller enterprise is no basis
for exemption.

That is established by the Herbert Harvey

case, for instance, which is a Labor Board case but involved

28
the same issue.
Herbert Harvey managed — I think it liras the World Bank
and international organizations are exempt from the bargaining
requirements of the Labor Relations Act and the theory of the
case was that these individuals, janitors and so on, were
employees of the management agent, which was exactly a
management agent just like Petitioners are here and the D.C.
Circuit held that, indeed, these persons were employees of
the management agent for purposes of the Labor Relations Act
and that the fact that they were also employees of an exempt
organization did not deprive them of the benefits of the Act
and the right to engage in collective bargaining.
Q

Well, technically, I suppose, even if you say this

is an enterprise that has an income or has sales above
$500,000, you could say that building employees aren't
covered.

I mean, that is the argument.
HR. PREY:

Well, because — we are turning to the

employment argument now?
Q

Yes.
MR. PREY:

Yes, it could be that you would say

that it is true that Drucker and Falk is a covered enterprise,
but these are not their employees and I’ll turn to that issue
now.
Q

Which would mean that their own employees in their

office would be.

19
MR. PREY:
Q

Would be covered?

Right.
MR. PREY:

Yes, and they have treated them as

covered and there has been no dispute about the coverage
of the central office personnel.
Q

There has not?
MR. PREY:

Why not?

Well, as far as I know, they are paid

above the minimum wage.
Q

Oh, well, they haven’t treated them as covered,

then?
MR. PREY:
Q

Well—

If it’s a question if they were covered, they

wouldn’t be covered if it was not an enterprise, (a) and, (b)
if it was an enterprise but its income was not over
$500,000.

MR. PREY:

Well, you'd have to look to where they

were employed to determine if they were employed in an
enterprise engaged in commerce.
Q

I understand that.

Well, what if the measure

here of sales was commissions, not rents?
MR. PREY:

Well, you'd have to look at the rest of

their business, as, we submit, you would have to do anyway.
If we lost the rent commissions issue and won the employment
issue, you would still have to go back to the district
court to look at the other aspect of Drucker and Falk's

30

business to see whether they —
Q

Yes, well, let's just assume that is the only

income they had, were their sales.
HR. PREY:

Then they would be exempted in the

central office and the central office personnel would be
exempted also.
Q

Mr. Prey, before you move on to the other issue,

you have intimated and your brief argues that the intent of
Congress, among other things, was to reach enterprises that
had a significant impact on commerce and as I read your brief,
page 18 and that which follows, your general discussion
suggests to me that you may think that if this rental agent
didn't handle these 30 apartment units that the impact on
commerce would be less.
MR. PREY:

Is that correct?

Well, it is the question of the impact

of an enterprise on commerce, Justice Powell, and —
Q

The substance really Is the effect on commerce and

these rental units, presumably, would be rented by the owners
whether or not there were a rental agent.
MR. FREY:

Well, but of course, there are

differences still, even in terms of the impact on commerce
because the Petitioners, for instance, purchase all supplies.
They do all the hiring on a unit basis.
enterprise cares for all
has all

That is, their

30 of these separate projects.

It

the efficiencies of scale that are inherent in that.

31
Q

That might make the impact less, rather than

having 30 separate people purchase the supplies.
MR. FREY:

Well — but that goes to the underlying

purpose of Congress was to distinguish on the basis of the
impact of an enterprise on commerce, not the impact of
unrelated business activities.

What they said was, if you

have related business activities which, taken together, have
a sufficient impact on commerce to meet our dollar volume
test, then the employees in those activities will be
protected.
If you split it up, fragment it into a series of
separate enterprises, then you do not have an enterprise
which, itself, has a sufficient impact on commerce to meet
the test.
Q

But in terms of economic reality, the impact on

commerce is likely to be pretty much the same, certainly in
the rental of apartment houses.
MR. FREY:

Well, I suppose that if General Motors

were divided into ten companies, each of which had a share of
the market equivalent to one-tenth of General Motors share,
you might suppose that in some senses the impact on commerce
would be the same, but they are also senses in which the fact
that it is General Motors altogether in one piece makes a
difference in terms of the impact on commerce.

But I don't

think Congress was suggesting that the level of national

32

business activity has to be changed but, rather, that it was
picking out for coverage employees who x*rere in enterprises
which, in themselves,

have a sufficient impact on Congress.

How, on the employment issue, it is conceded that
these people — that Petitioners are employers of these
employees.

What Mr. Kelly did not point to but which we

also attach considerable weight to is the

definition of

"employ"in Section 3(g) which is "To suffer or to permit to
work."
Now, who is it who suffers or permits these
employees to work?
Petitioners.

Again, the building otmers are off at the

bottom of the ocean.
people.

It Is perfectly clear that it is

They have nothing to do with these

The only connection that they have with these

people is approval of an overall labor budget but as far as
the record discloses and from the contract, it appears that
they don't even have the right to exercise a veto over the
hiring and firing and so on, as was the case in Arnheim and
Neely.
Q

But don't you think that the fact that they pay

them has some connection?
MR. PREY:

It has some connection.

Again, if we

were here with the difficult case of whether these were
employees of the building owners, which we would contend they
are, but in a secondary sense, we would rely on the fact that

33
the services they perform benefit the building owners and
payment comes out of the building owners’ funds.

So when you

say, xvho pays them?, the arrangement that the building
owners have with the management company happens to provide
for their payment by the building owner.

We do not in any

sense suggest or concede, though, that as a common law matter
as between the employees and the Petitioners, the Petitioners
are not responsible for their salaries.
Q

But if, in fact, the money that is used to pay

their salaries is that of the owners, it is not of the
Petitioners.
MR. FREY:

That is right, but it has never been

viewed, either in the social legislation cases before this
Court or in common law cases that payment of money alone is
the governing indicia of an employment relationship, although
it may be sufficient.
Q

Well, I quite agree.

I just questioned your

statement that the owners had virtually no connection with
the employees and you are not mentioning the fact that it was
their money which paid them, which may not be overwhelming,
but it seems to me this is a factor.
MR. FREY :

I am not sure that it would be a

materially different case if the employees were paid by the
management company which, in turn, took a cost-plus kind of a
fee to do it.

In our view, that would make no significant

34
difference in the case.
Nov/ — vie 11» I have averted to the reality of the
economic relationship between the management company and the
employees.

I'd like to point out» which is very important,

that these people are not simply employed in the building
owner's enterprise, which is real estate investment.

They

are also employed in a very real sense in Petitioner's
enterprise, which is the management of buildings for others.
Petitioners could not conduct their enterprise if they didn'*t
have these janitors, these elevator operators, these
maintenance personnel.

So to say that they are not employed

In a meaningful sense in Petitioner’s enterprise I think is
completely incorrect.
Now, I think the Court was troubled, or, perhaps,
at least, Petitioner's counsel was troubled by the notion
that, you know, you might have all these different employers
under the definition of employer in the Act.
how, I think that a case could be made out that
Congress Intended to permit multiple liability, not in the
sense, Justice Stewart, that you could recover more than once
for a statutory liability, but in the sense that there might
be

several jointly liable individuals.
However, the McKay case carved out — which vias

the Eighth Circuit case which was discussed In both briefs—
carved out what, in effect is a fellow servant exception.

It

35
says that, well, If the person who you are looking to does
not have his own independent business enterprise but is
simply an employee, that is, a supervisor, the head of a
personnel office or somebody like that, you can't hold him
independently liable.
all here.

We are not dealing with that case at

We are dealing with an independent business

enterprise to which these employees are vital.
Nov/, there was a question as to the owner’s
liability.

The owners in this case would be considered

unquestionably liable derivitively

because they also employ

these individuals who are employed in Petitioner's enterprise.
That is, if the Court were to conclude that these
individuals are covered under the Act by virtue of their
employment in Petitioner's enterprise, which is of sufficient
size, then the building owners would be liable not for all
of Petitioner's employees but for those who are employed
at the owner's own building.
Q

For those whose pay checks they actually pay, you

see?
HR. FREY:

That would be our position, although I

could see a case here where the building ov/ner v/ould argue
that, well, the management company may be liable but our
connection is so remote because we are not involved in — we
don't actually employ these people.

We don't suffer or

permit them to work except in an indirect sense.
I am not arguing that point of view, but I think

36
we would have a harder case.
Q

Well, certainly, it is so commonplace now, I

suppose, that under this Act and under its language that there
can be more than one employer of the same person.
MR. PREY:

It is no doubt that has been

recognized.
Q

There is no question of that, is there?
MR. PREY:

Ho question.

That has been recognized

by this Court in the Labor Board context in the'Greyhound
case and it has been recognized by numerous courts of
appeals in cases that we have cited and the amicus brief
treats it as though there can only be one employer and they
spend all of their time establishing the proposition that
the building owner is an employer of these employees and
our view is that that gets them nowhere because it is just
not mutually exclusive \*ith Petitioners also being an
employer.
Q

Would each owner be covered even though he did

not himself meet the dollar volume test by virtue of the
fact that Petitioner met the dollar volume test?
MR. PREY:

He tvould be derivatively responsible

with respect to those persons employed at his building.

If

they are employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce by him,
then the fact that his enterprise is not big enough, if you
remember in the Arnheim argument we had the example of the

37
hairdressing salon in the department store where the

hair­

dresser himself may not have a big enough enterprise but if
he puts a unit in Woodward and Lothrop and they have a big
enough enterprise, then those persons employed in the Woodward
and Lothrop enterprise hairdresser section would be covered
and the hairdresser would be liable for the payment of their
wages and Woodward and Lothrop would not, unless — whether
Woodward and Lothrop would be would depend on whether it would
be part of Woodward and Lothrop’s sales also.
But, in other words, you do not have to, yourself,
be an enterprise that is subject to the Act under the dollar
volume test in order to have some of your employees for some
other reason responsible.
Accordingly, we submit that the judgment of the
court of appeals should be affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.
Very well, Mr. Frey.

Mr. Kelly, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF
HERBERT V. KELLY
MR. KELLY:

Yes, sir, if I may take a moment.

The Court understands that we do not agree that
the First Rational Bank case or the Jernigan case, either one,
are applicable, though Counsel asserts that they are.

The

First National Bank case, the defendant bank owned the
building and rented it to a management company that was the

38
wholly-owned subsidiary of that company and as a matter of
fact, as I recall the facts, the president of the company
drew $15,000 a year from the bank as salary and $1,800 a
year from the management firm.

That was strictly an ownership

case where they proceeded against the owners of the property
and the Jernigan case is, again, a proceedings against the
owner.

There the operator of the restaurant-service station

facilities of the bus depot owned it and the court concluded
that he spent the greatest portion of his time operating the
bus station and that is where you are with the gasoline cases
that Counsel refers to. There you have sued the owner who
and
is operating/in the business of selling the gasoline.
The problem that I find with Counsel’s argument
is that he talks about sales of apartment space like you
sell them every day, like you move in a new tenant every
Monday;

Suppose you have an apartment project where there is

no turnover during the entire year of the contract of
management?

It may happen to be the rent which was reserved in

MR. KELLY:

is an existing lease that may run for two years.
sell a thing so far as space.

They won't

They sell their services and

you could have a project where you would never sell anything
but services if there was no turnover.
The other problem I have — and will sit down —■
is that it seems to me that if you take all these theories of
Counsel as to who is covered, that the judge’s example on
the district court level where you had the lawyer who was
managing the large estate, that bought and sold stocks,
bonds, assets, real estate in the estate and distributed
the money and had a total gross income, that he would be
covered.

Now, that's not what the Act says and I don’t

think it is the intent of Congress that that be true.
I don’t think it is the intent of Congress that I
think it is illusory, I submit to you to say that the impact
of the 40-unit apartment project on Ward Boulevard in the
City of Newport News has one whit more impact on commerce
sitting there with Drucker and Falk managing it than with me
managing it.
The impact of those 40 units sitting on Ward
Boulevard is — whatever it is and it does not Impact it a
bit more if I manage it or Drucker and Falk.

It would be

just managed not quite as well and we submit that the
decision in the Court of Appeals should be reversed.
