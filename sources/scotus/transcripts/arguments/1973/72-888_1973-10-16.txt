PROCEEDINGS
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will near

arguments first this morning in Ho. 72-888, which is Zahn
against the International Paper Company.
Mr. Langrock, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER F. LANGROCK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LANGROCK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This .is an action that v/as initiated in the United
States District Court, in the District of Vermont, on behalf
of the Zahns and Lcazers and other persons similarly situated.
It was brought against International Paper Company
and the facts of the matter allege that certain problems with
the pollution of Lake Champlain is affecting the plaintiffs
ana the class.
The particular mill involved in Ticonderoga is
also the subject of another matter before this Court, which
has also been referred to a master in chancery.
The district Judge, on a motion to dismiss the
class action aspects of the case, took the matter underadvisement.

Me appeared before him and, after a period, of

time, he dismissed the class action aspects of the case with,
and I quote from his opinion, "groat reluctance."

The natter was then appealed to the second circuit
of the Court of Appeals, interlocutory appeal permission being
granted by the circuit as well as asked for by the district
court.

There, in a divided opinion, it was affirmed.

The

en banc proceeding was rather complicated with four of the
active judges —

of

seven voting, four en banc, but failing

to be en bancked because of a failure to achieve the majority
of five and certiorari was granted this Court.
The basic issue presented is rather a narrow one
and that is, whether a United States District Court judge is
prohibited from taking jurisdiction of a clas3 action where
one or more members of the class might not reach the
jurisdictional amount.
In looking at the rule, this is a 23-13 proceeding
and the rule initially requires, before any court car) take
jurisdiction of the class, a finding that the class is superior
to other available methods for the fair and efficient ad­
judication of the controversy.
The first proposition that I put to the Court is
that one could really reduce this case to a mathematical
formula that if we assume that a case on all the facts can be
either — is efficient in the courts or it isn't efficient,
we then, if it i3 not efficient, the court is prohibited, the
district court, from taking jurisdiction.
If it is efficient, then we have two choices.

5
Either the court nay take jurisdiction of the class or it is
prohibited.

Under this ruling, it is prohibited from taking

jurisdiction and so
Q

excuse me —

As I understand Judge Leddy's ruling,

hr. Langrock, he simply held that in his view of the law
that each of the plaintiffs having to have £10,000 as a
matter of in controversy, it was not efficient to maintain it
as a class action.

I didn’t get the feeling from his ruling

that he felt he was absolutely debarred, had he reached
of the
another result as to the practicality/thing in view of his
view of the law.
MR. LANGROCK:

I’d have to disagree with you, sir.

‘fne opinion, I think, states quite clearly that it was
dismissed solely on the prohibitation of Snyder versus Harris
and that it was dismissed with great reluctance, and that is
his words.
Q

Yes, but he, interpreting Snyder a,gainst

Harris as he did, he then went on to conclude that there
would be such serious complications and delay in determining
who was bound and who wasn't, that this was no maintainable
as a class action.
MR. LA2J0R0CK:

Assuming that only members of a

class who had reached the jurisdictional amount

in other

words, if you defined your class at $10,000, then he would
say that would be impossible and therefore, he refused to

6
redefine the cla^s, excluding members who would have less
than the jurisdictional amount of the $10,000.
The question that — the policy question here I
think and so much that is before the Court in class actions is
the question of judicial efficiency.

I would promote that

this type of class action —now, this is not a — what I would
consider an unmanageable class action, this is not a
manufactured one.

This is a real controversy involving

approximately 2^0 owners of the lake, on the lakeshore.
is a

This

case which is going forward in the Federal District

Court, whether it is a class action or individually, on the
merits.
The question of multiple litigation that may arise
is the class action we are not allowed, may be very extensive.
It may be done in several state courts, In other district
courts.

It nay well be multiple litigation in the same

district court.
We think that the judicial efficiency of this
type of approach — this is the proper place for the class
action.

Here is where there is real litigation, litigation

which is already — the facts of it have already been
involved in a Supreme Court matter.

This matter is not going

to go away and we think a district court should be allowed
to make a finding that this is the superior, most efficient
way of handling it and if that is not the case, then he Is

7
prohibited under Rule 23 of taking it in any case.
Q

When you say, "Make a finding to that effect,"

you mean that he should be able to include in the class
people who do not themselves have $10,000 in controversy.
MR. LAWGROCK:
Q

That’s right, sir.

Isn’t the case of Clark versus Paul Gray that

was cited in Snyder and was cited in the second circuit
opinion,that 306 U.S. case, wouldn’t we have to overrule that
to go along with you?
MR. L/UIGRQCX:

I don’t believe so, sir.

goes back prior to the change of the rule.

That case

'That was an

action where some of the named plaintiffs did not meet the
jurisdictional amount.
Q

But one of then did.

MR, LAWGR0CK:
to proceed.

One of them did and h§ was allowed

There was in the face of the record certain

aspects of the case which are not present in this case.

In

other words, there were people who did not meet the
jurisdictional amount and the effect — looking at the change
of the rule, one of the problems and one of the reasons for
the change of the rule is that it was an awkward situation.
?

We are talking about spurious hyde right or whathaveyou and
the rule simply states what tests should be, empirical tests
to meet the class action, with a lot of safeguards and we
don’t think that the previous precedent of Clark versus Gray

8
calls for overruling.
Q

But if you follow the reasoning of Snyder

against Harris, the rules could be amended until one is blue
in the face and you are still subject to the jurisdictional
limitations of the statute and all the Court was interpreting
in Clark versus Paul Gray was the statute.

The fact that

the class action rule may have been different then certainly
doesn’t affect their reasoning, as I read it.
MB. LANGROCK:
disagree.

Well, I, again, would beg to

It seems to me that what we have in the statute is

the diversity of jurisdiction, that diversity of citizenship
plus the jurisdictional amount.

There have been times in

this court when matters not meeting the jurisdictional amount
or matters not meeting the diversity requirement, have been
allotted when attached to a

case with this proper jurisdiction.

The whole concept of ancillary, pendant jurisdiction.

We

have — it seems to me that it is a clearly-set-forth doctrine
that absolute diversity is not required when the main case
has jurisdiction and, to me, it is not logical to 3ay that
one can proceed when you don’t have complete diversity, which
is one requirement of the statute, but you must meet the
jurisdictional amount and this is even more so because the
diversity requirement is really a Constitutional doctrine
with the amount in controversy as a statutory one.
Q

But, nonetheless, the Court, in Clark, did

Q

say that and that was after the decision in Ben Hur, which
was ruled the way you indicated on diversity.
MR. LANGROCK:

The cases, without getting into a

complete analysis of Clark, I think Clark misconstrued its
previous precedent and it is really a dictum in Clark, the
peculiar situation of the case.

I don't think Clark needs

to be overruled to reach our result.
to be set forth in its proper context.

I

think that it needs
What we have here is

whether or not the jurisdiction is totally prohibited and I
don't think that the concept of ancillary pendant jurisdiction
is prohibited by Clark.
Q

Excuse me, is this a diversity suit?

IIR. LAMGROCK:

Or not?

This is a diversity, based on

diversity in the Mountain controversy.
Q

And there is no basis here for saying that

federal law governs thi3 case, I take it?
MR. LAiJGROCK:

There perhaps is, but there are

several questions of state law that are involved and it was
brought under the diversity statute.
Q

Wouldn’t you be on stronger ground, on
I

firmer ground, in talking about pendant Jurisdiction if you
are starting, off with a federal cause of action?
MR. LANGROCK:

It certainly would be, on pendant,

but I was referring to ceicep; of pendant as being a form of —
Q

Well, I neant ancillary, too.

MR. LANG ROCK:

Well, I don't think so.

I think

that at least the lover courts have brought ancillary
jurisdiction over strictly state claims.

of appeals of the eighth circuit —
Q

Well, I don’t think there would be as much

pressure in the cases or as much support in the cases for
reaching out for other state causes of action to join with
another state cause of action.
HR. LAWGROCK:

There is not as much case law as

such on it, but there is, certainly cases which do —
Q

Well, what about the governing law in this

case?
MR. LAWGROCK:

We think that this is a case with

first impression before this Court, that the Court has never
ruled with regard to whether a court may take other
controversies into its orbit when it is efficient in the
interest of justice to do so, and when they —
Q

But, on the merits, is this a state lav/?

What governs it, the state or federal law?
MR. LAWGROCK:
Q

On the merits?

MR. LAWGROCK:
Q

The state lav*.

The state law, yes, sir.

On all these claims.

MR. LAWGROCK:

There is, in the pleadings, a

mention of some federal claims.

Basically, it is a state law,

Q

Is this an interstate pollution sort of case?

MR. LAUGROCK:

The mill is on one side of the lake

and the landowners are on the other
Q

side of the lake.

And is there a state line in between them?

MR. LAMGROCK:

There is a state line in between

them.
There are various reasons in the law that we have
made election to proceed on this.

I think there is

possibility for federal jurisdiction Independent of that.
Q

The plant is now not in operation.

Is this

correct?
MR. LANGROCK:
Q

Pardon?

The plant is not :Ln operation any more.

Is

this correct?
MR. LA1IGR0CK:

The plant was closed several months

after initiation of this lawsuit.

The sludge bed, which is

affecting the landowners, is still present and there is much
litigation whether that should be removed or not removed or
how to be disposed of.

But the effects of the pollution are

still very much in effect.
The —• one of the — yes, excuse me.
Q

Am I wrong in thinking that perhaps in one of

our original actions in which we denied leave to file, was it
Illinois against City of Milwaukee, we had something to say

12
about the governing law in interstate pollution cases?
MR. LAMGROCK:

It may be, sir.

I am not familiar

with that question.
Q

Well, I would suppose it might make a lot of

difference a3 to whether it is ancillary or not.

If this is

governing federal law, you might have a very different case.

Q

You talk as though there might be a choice

on it.
MR. LAMGROCK:
Q

Well, I think —

Well, there might be.

MR. LAMGROCK:

There might not be, too.

This is correct.

We have stated,

under the civil rules, a complaint stating a factual basis
which we believe calls for relief.

We believe we are entitled

to relief under the diversity and state argument.

We also

believe there may well develop a federal concept out of that
but, to be quite candid, we have not developed that question
because of the jurisdictional point as yet and we certainly

13
believe it 5.8 with the Court.
Q

In other words, you invoke federal jurisdiction

exclusively upon the basis upon the diversity relationship?
MR. LANGROCK;

That is right, our complaint

alleges diversity, Is based upon the diversity sections.
Q

Right.

HR, LANGROCK:

I think I, in response to Justice

REhnquist’s question, responded to the Ben Hur situation.

We

think that is still the good law, that it is not necessary
to have complete diversity.

Where the case is in controversy,

the case is before the court, there is full diversity and
ancillary, pendant matter can come before the court.
We fail to see how the diversity requirement
should be differently treated than the amount in controversy.
The effect of this case, if It is not — I should point our
one more thing, too.

That is, there is a great body of case

law which, in the question of intervention as a matter of
right under 2k(a)2 indicates that there is not a need for
independent jurisdictional mount where the first case has.
And I would suggest that this Court, the problems
that would come about if this Court does not recognize that
where, in the efficient cause of the administration of justice
you have got to have this finding first, that a court is
prohibited from talcing jurisdiction over a class,

not only

does it destroy the class action concept wherever there Is a

14
federal question requiring an amount in controversy or a
diversity question involving the amount in controversy, but
it has effects on the question of the development of the
concept of pendant or ancillary jurisdiction.

It has the

effect on the law involving intervention of right and I don't
see how, logically, one can say that the Court can take
jurisdiction on cases which don't meet the jurisdictional
requirements ancillary in certain cases and not in others.
What I am arguing here for is not an expansion of
any law as I see it, but merely an application of law to those
cases where we can efficiently put this into the hands of the
district judge.

the state courts, three pieces.

Let's not force this
Let's not force this on

What if we have six cases in

the Vermont District Court that have adjoined the problem?

It

is just as difficult to try.
The class action case can, for instance, on the
damages question, use a master.

It can do things.

It can

deal with what is really a major problem, a serious pollution
situation in the most efficient. Intelligent manner before it
and we would hate to see the Court prohibit it from doing so
and this is what this amounts to.

We would suggest that the

arguments of the Defendant in this matter are really that they
don’t want class action because it causes problems for them,

15

not because of the jurisdiction of this Court at the time
this was initiated.
Q

Would it not be just as much of a problem

for the Defendant in a state court as here?
MR. LAWGROCK:

Well, I that if It were filed in

the state court, we might have a removal petition and we’d
be faced with the same jurisdictional question.

I've seen

another case very recently of that type of situation.
Q

Well, isn’t that for their choice?

MR. LAMGROCK:
Q

At that point, it would be.

Why arent you in the state court, really?

MR. LANGRQCK:

At the time this case was

initiated, there was no state class action proceeding.

There

was a proceeding that was — the rules of civil procedure
were amended subsequently to allow it but in any case,
whether or not,the Congress has given a choice under
diversity both to the plaintiff and to the defendant.

The

question is not whether or not we have the diversity, but it
is how to make efficient use and to prevent any more
litigation than is necessary, given the diversity situation
that we have in Congress.
It seems to me that, in conclusion, that the
Court is faced with two choices here, a most restrictive
ruling v;hich prohibits the district judge from what I — I
think in the mathematical sense, prohibits him from using

of real litigation before the courts and if the district Judge

class action, for the determination that If the Court feels
that it is the proper tool, that it can do so and it Is not
prohibited by the fact that one or more persons in the class
may not have the $10,000 jurisdictional amount.
The alternative would be to tie the hands of the
district court and, in doing so, bring up the various
problems I mentioned.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Whipple.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TAGGART WHIPPLE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WHIPPLE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I’d like to divide my argument a3 follows:

I’d

like to make a few comments about Mr. Langdock’s statements
and some of the questions that were asked and then I want to
address myself to the principal question which, It seems to
me, Plaintiff's counsel argument did not address itself to
directly, and that is this:
Although! the Plaintiff stressed the environmental

17
aspects of this case, the legal question presented by this
case concerns the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court
which had been limited since the beginning of this country in
their jurisdiction, was so designed by Congress and had been
so construed and limited by the Constitution and Congress in
1789, indeed, the first Bill introduced in the Senate of this
country ended up as the Judiciary Act of 1739, with a
jurisdiction limit of $500.
And I submit we must never forget, in this case
or elsewhere, that the federal court system is a system for
a limited purpose and every demand like this made on the
federal courts has to be carefully examined by lawyers, by
the courts, by Congress and the public, to see whether it is
consistent with the ever-mounting federal case load which
engulfs the federal courts.
I would like to address myself first to the
reasons why the Court of Appeals is correct in holding
that the district court did not have jurisdiction over the
class action.

I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist put his finger

on one cf the cardinal points, sir, vrhen you said that in
order to overrule the opinion of the Court of Appeals below
and the opinion of Judge Leddy, this Court must confront
Clark against Gray and overrule it.

I think that is clear

and I think that is particularly so because of the
interpretation put upon Clark

against Gray, admittedly

18

decided, as Plaintiff’s counsel said, before the federal rule
23 was amended In 1966, but the interpretation put upon Clark
against Gray and Snyder against Harris was there after rule 23
was amended.
I’d also like to talk about ancillary jurisdiction
and the reasons why ancillary or pendant jurisdiction is
superficially an appealing idea here and, In my judgment,
badly misinterpreted by the dissenting judge below.

The

reasons why ancillary or pendant jurisdiction, if applied to
a spurious class action, where the separate and

distinct

claims, not a unitary Constitutional case of controversy,
separate claims of the people will fall short of the
jurisdictional requirement

would contravene Constitutional

statutory decisional and policy considerations.
Now, a couple of comments about statements by
plaintiff counsel:

He said, as I understood him, that the

so-called ’’sludge bed" still shows that the effects of
pollution are still very much in effect.

This is wrong.

In

the case brought by the State of Vermont

against New York and

my plant, which is now on trial before special master, we
have finished 70 trial days.

We have a record of 1*1,000 pages.

We have hundreds of exhibits, thousands of pages and in that
case I have cross-examined witnesses vrho have said — one of
them has spent his life on the river and sails over the waters
of the sludge bed.

I asked him "What's the water like?" and

IS
he said, "beautiful."
Q

Does that have anything to do with our —

MR. WHIPPLE:

No, sir, but I don't want to stand

here and permit this statement to go unchallenged.
Q

Well, we don’t need to get into the merits

now on either side.
MR. WHIPPLE:

Well, I simply didn’t want that to

go by, Mr. Chief Justice.
How, let us look at the basis for the federal
diversity jurisdiction.

I think it is clearly defined that

from the beginning of time, Congress has had the task of
prescribing limitations on this diversity jurisdiction.
Congress has repeatedly reenacted the phrase, "matter in
dispute," originally in 1789 or "matter in controversy" as it
is now.
The courts have held that this phrase must be
strictly construed.
strict construction.

The policy of the statute calls for its
We say that holds good now just the

way it has held good from the beginning of time here and the
cases with smaller amounts are for the state courts.
Indeed, the diversity statute, 1332(a) constitutes,
as the Court said in Healy, and represents a demonstration of
the delicate balance between federal and state powers.

The

Federal Court should not be looked upon as a reservoir for
all litigation, but, rather, in diversity cases, only those

20
casee which meet the jurisdictional amount and the jurisdic­
tional amount which this Court knows applies in cases arising
under the laws, the treaties and the Constitution of the
United States is Section 1331(a).
Snyder, in 1969, a recent case, applied this
principle.

It rejected aggregation,

despite the claims of

the plaintiffs and the dissenters in that case that this
rejection of aggregation would"underout and undermine."

Those

words are used in the majority of the dissenting opinion,
"Undercut and undermine the amendments to rule 23."

The

Court pointed out that a spurious class action is a kind of
permissive joinder device

of separate and distinct claims

and in that situation, each plaintiff who has a separate and
distinct claim must meet the jurisdictional amounts.

They

pointed out that the nonaggregation doctrine was not based on
old rule 23 or on any rule of procedure.

Rather, it is based

under Court's consistent interpretation of the phrase
"matter in controversy" which predates even the federal rules
of procedure amendments in 1938 that the Court has held a
consistent interpretation for years and that Congress, in
four times raising the jurisdictional amount, starting in
1789, has reenacted the word, "matter in —” the phrase,
"matter in controversy"

for years and years in the light of

these interpretations.
Q

Well, this litigation will go on as respects

21
the four*s ■aach of whom has the appropriate jurisdictional
amount?
MR. WHIPPLE:

I assume it will, in the federal

courts, your Honor.
Q

Yes.

MR. WHIPPLE:
Q

Yes.

So it is not quite in the same posture as

that, and, of course, I did not agree with Snyder, and that's
MR. WHIPPLE:

I recognize, your Honor, you did

not, and I read your dissent carefully.

At tire same time,

I have noted, with all respect, that in your dissent, you
and Mr. Justice Portis pointed out that the majority rule
would apply to a case just like this where one or more
plaintiffs did meet the jurisdictional amount and the others
did not.
Q

Well, that may just reflect the fault of

dissenters who usually sound an alarm bigger than Is
warranted.
MR. WHIPPLE:

Well, whatever the reason, your

Honor, I have noted that and I have noted that in two cases
cited, the majority opinion, in Snyder and Clark against Gray
and a Court of Appeals decision, Alvarez, in each of those
cases, one plaintiff satisfied the jurisdictional amount and
I can't see, really, logically, any difference at all.

X

think it is true, as the Court of Appeals said, that they saw

22
"persuasive Internal evidence" from the Snyder opinion that
the rule there admittedly, In Snyder, there was no plaintiff
with the requisite jurisdictional amount but the Court of
Appeals felt that, read carefully, the majority opinion in
Snyder covered the situation before your Honors now and that is
where we have four named plaintiffs which seek the requisite
jurisdictional amount and none, according to the complaint,
none of the unnamed plaintiffs meet that amount.
Q

Have you considered our decision in Illinois

and the City of Milwaukee?
MR. WHIPPLE:

I have indeed, your Honor.

lrd be

glad to answer questions about it.
Q

Well,

do you think that has any bearing on

what law governs the merits of this litigation?
MR. WHIPPLE:

I start with the proposition, your

Honor and answer your question that the complaint Itself
rests solely and entirely on 1352(a), which is diversity,

I

listened to Mr. Langrock carefully and I heard him say that
there is sitting the complaint state law claims.
that is evident.

How, I think

This is not a case arising under 1331(a),

as you know.
Q

Well, I was just wondering, though, after

Illinois and Milwaukee, we said federal law governs, federal
common law.

It had still to be developed. ' Would the district

court be free to apply state lav;?

I understand that what

is

23
involved here is alleged pollution from the New York side by
your client that caused damage to the plaintiffs here on the
Vermont side.
MR. WHIPPLE:

case on the other.

Q

What about liability, though, Mr. Whipple?

What about the initial question of liability?

Are you going

to have one set of laws — one law govern the original action
you are litigating and another law governing this suit here
with respect to the very same pollution?
MR. WHIPPLE:

I don’t think so, your Honor.

In the

original suit, the fundamental prayer is removal of the
sludge bed.
Q

Well, that is going to be a federal common law,

isn’t it?
MR. WHIPPLE:

By your ruling, I gather it is, in

Illinois against Milwaukee.

2H

Q

But in the question of whether there is an

obligation to remove or whether there has been a violation of
somebody’s rights in the first place, it is going to be a
question of federal law, isn’t it?
I®. WHIPPLE:

Well, I don't think it necessarily

applies to us.
Q

In the original action.

MR. WHIPPLE:

Well, in the original action, the

question as to whether the bed

ought to be removed Is now

before the Court and it seems to me the thrust of your ruling
in Illinois against Milxvaukee Is to visit the remarks you made
on actions brought by estate.

It says nothing about actions

brought by private people, actions brought by estate to abate.
Q

Certainly, If you take a case like Georgia

against Tennessee Copper, where the Court intimated that there
would be a kind of federal common law rule, there is no
intimation there that the same rule would govern action
between private parties, is there?
MR. WHIPPLE:

None whatever, your Honor and, indeed,

at one point, in either Milwaukee or one of the other cases,
the Court indicates that you would be

slow to apply this

Illinois against Milwaukee also

adopted the language of Texas against Panke, where the judge
there spoke of the state’s right, a quasi-soverign right in
ecological purity.

That Is not this case.

This is a strict,

common law* border play case for money damages based on —

Would It make any difference in your case?

MR, WHIPPLE:

No, I don’t think It would.

In either case it is based on

Then you are in 1331(a) and you have got

the $10,000.
Q

So then you don't think It makes any difference

with respect to the argument about ancillary or pendant
jurisdiction?
MR. WHIPPLE:

Well, I don’t think it makes any

difference there and I’ll be glad to talk about that
argument right now.
As far as ancillary jurisdiction goes, my first
point Is that when Snyder was decided, and all the chain of
cases that Snyder adopted, the ancillary jurisdiction goes
back — and our brief points out — it goes back to at least
1824 and so I would submit that this Court, over the years, in
applying the thinking that led to Snyder implicitly rejected
the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction.
rely on implicit projection.
Q
In

Snyder

But I don’t have to

I rely upon —

Of course, one can rely on the single claim
that gave the court this jurisdiction.

MR. WHIPPLE:

That is correct.

That is correct

and I can’t find that the matter of ancillary jurisdiction was

26

ever presented in Snyder.

I want to be frank about that.

But

in the cases where it has been presented, I think that the way
perfectly
the law has developed, it is/clear that the courts have
explicitly refused to exercise ancillary jurisdiction or
the permissive joinder of separate and distinct claims and in
Snyder, the Court pointed out that a class action is a kind of
permissive joinder device, where the particular scope is not
directed at a reis or a corpus and this isn’t just having to
do with disputed title in real property or conflicting claims
to some kind of a fund or assets in the hands of the court.
My analysis of the ancillary jurisdiction cases
suggest — and I think the law will support me on this — that
this is a permissable procedure only where there is a unitary
constitutional case or a controversy and that is not this
case.

This Is a bundle of more than 200 separate and distinct

claims and we point out in our brief at the end on page 45 or
so, a half a dozen or more of the issues that are going to be
raised by each and every one of these 200 people when they
come to trial.
Ancillary Jurisdiction, in order to be applicable,
it seems to me, from the cases, must have a direct relation
to property or assets in the court's possession or control and
that is not the case here.
It also has been expanded, getting away from Hurn
against Pursier, to include compulsory counterclaims or

27

claims of a nature that would be precluded if not raised in the
principal action and this is not that case.

These 200

unnamed plaintiffs case claims are not going to be precluded
by any judgment \*/ith respect to

the two couples who brought

this suit, the Zahns and the Leasers,
I dont find any decision cited by the plaintiffs
or any decision cited in the dissent which is precedent for
the use of ancillary jurisdiction in a spurious class action.
The cases are limited, as I said before, to unitary
Constitutional cases or controversy and to expand that
limited doctrine, and it is a doctrine of limitation, to
sweep in 200 separate and distinct claims with 200 separate
and distinct trials and 200 separate and distinct juries,
that is what it is going to be, or you are going to have a
mass trial with 200-odd people before the court and one jury
is going to be asked to segregate out each of the considera­
tions involving each of the plaintiffs,
I submit, to sweep in these 200 claims under the
loose application of the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction,
which the dissentable law would do, flies right in the face
of the settled principles about the jurisdiction of federal
courts that I talked about a moment ago.
Pendent jurisdiction also is involved here.
Although the term, perhaps, was used rather loosely and
intermixed with ancillary by the judge below, pendent — and

28
the Court had occasion to look at this vei-y recently in the
Moore against County of Maine da

case, not cited in my brief

because it. came-out so recently, pendent jurisdiction is a
specialized form of ancillary jurisdiction and it really
involves, as the Court knows, the exercise of federal
jurisdiction over a state law claim, which is pendent to a
federal claim, where —

Q

And I take it, even if federal law governed

here, so that this were not a diversity state law case, then
there is no problem of pendent jurisdiction?

MR. WHIPPLE:
Q

No, there wouldn’t be.

On your —

All 200 of these —yes?

MR. WHIPPLE:

On your assumption there would be no

3tate claim to scotch-tape on to the federal claim.

But I

also point out in pendent jurisdiction, if lire are correct in
saying state law applies, that the cases have involved federal
and state claims by the same party, which is not the case here,
at all.
Q

Well, why isn’t it, if one accepts the

hypothesis advanced by Justice White and Justice Brennan that
each individual might have a claim under state law and also
under federal law?
MR. WHIPPLE:

Well, the complaint doesn’t say that,

your Honor, but if you — taking your assumption — let’s take
that for the moment, let’s say this is the 1331 case as well

29

as the 1332 case and each of these 200-odd plaintiffs has a
state law claim and a federal law claim.
Q

May 1 Just —

MR. WIIIPPLE:
Q

Then the argument

Sir?

My premise was that there would be no state

law claim at all.
MR. WHIPPLE:
Q

I thought it was.

If this is the kind of pollution case which,

under Milwaukee, is governed by federal law, then there is
no problem as to any of these 200 claims.

On the state law

claim, it is entirely, all 200 of them are federal lav;
claims.
MR. WHIPPLE:

I appreciate that, your Honor, but,

because the complaint does couch the claim —
Q

State law.

MR. WHIPPLE:

— under state law, which is the

necessary result of using 1332(a) as a diversity suit, I
felt I had to address myself to that.
Q

Well, Mr. Whipple, take three different

hypotheses, if you will, which may represent the views of
varying members of the Court that in a, situation like this,
it is governed by straight state lav; that the rule governing
an action where a state is involved, where you have federal
common law doesn:t apply to the action between private
parties.

That is the first hypothesis.

■

30
The second is that you would have two sets of laws
available to private parties, both that which would govern
where a state is a party and also the Vermont law.
And the third being that you would have only
federal laws, as Justice Brennan suggests.
In the second of those hypotheses, at any rate,
you would have a case for pendent jurisdiction, ivouldn’t you?
MR. WHIPPLE:

No, sir, if I may say so.

And the

reason you wouldn’t is there isn’t a unitary case of controversy.

There are more than 200 separate and distinct claims»

Nov;, the cases, as I read them, in pendent jurisdiction, I am
referring to United Mine Workers against Gibbs and the recent
opinion of this Court last spring in Moore against County of
Alameda makes this very plain, there has to be — as Gibbs
said, a common nucleus of operative fact.
common nucleus of operative fact here.

There isn’t a

Each and every one of

these plaintiffs is going to have to vest his claim on separate
considerations.
Looking at the record Itself, the Zahns own more
than half a mile of shorefront.

front.

The Leasers —-

The Leaders own 1,800 feet of shore-

They are a mile from the plant.

They run a marina.

If you look at the spectrum of these people up and down the 20
miles of the Vermont shorefront, they are all in different

31
situations.
Q

The Zahns themselves might have pendent

jurisdiction, under my second hypothesis.
MR, WHIPPLE:
Q

Oh, yes, sir.

But they couldn't bring someone else in who

had less than the $10,000.
MR. WHIPPLE:

I think the Zahns might.

the Zahns might, your Honor, but the thrust of the

I think
dissent,

as you know, under plaintiff's argument here, is that
pendous jurisdiction is enough to sweep in the 200 other
people to make their claim with the Zahns or the Leasers.
Have I answered your question?
Q

Yes.

MR. WHIPPLE:

I want to make it plain that I am

not trying to restrict Gibbs or Moore because I think that
in addition to the holding there, that there has to be
unitary case of controversy.

Gibbs also, it seems to me,

extends pendent jurisdiction, and Moore does, too, to
situation where the litigation of the principal claim might
well have a preclusive effect on the dependent claim, but
then, again, that isn't this case here because the litigation
of the Zahn and Leaser’s claim isn't going to preclude these
200 other people from trying their cases wherever they may
try them.
How, the plaintiffs have a block of cases in their

32

brief which they claim slide away from the principles of
Gibbs and Moore as I interpret them.

We said in our brief

that substantially all those cases involved the unitary case
of controversy.
Since our brief was written, X have read the
Court’s opinion in Moore and at footnote 29,

US at page

713, substantially all of the cases relied on by the plaintiff
in this respect were categorized by this Court as involving
unitary case of controversy, just what we said in our brief.
I think that distinguishes those cases from our situation.
Now, even if the power to hear exists here with
respect to pendent jurisdiction, still, the Court pointed out
in Moore that that doctrine of pendent jurisdiction involves
consideration of judicial economy and convenience and fairness
and I submit to you that sweeping in these 200 people, with
200 separate and distinct claims, runs 180 degrees away from
consideration of judicial economy and fairness or convenience.
These cases which are sought to be swept in here in
the class action belong^ in the state courts.

There is, as

plaintiff counsel pointed out, a Vermont class action statute.
It’s a Chinese copy of federal rule 23.

It was passed in July,

’ 71, a couple of months, a few months after this complaint we.s
brought.
My client is sueable in the state courts of
Vermont.

There is no jurisdictional bar with respect to the

33
Vermont class action statute because, according to my
reading of Vermont law, the county courts have jurisdiction
of cases involving $200 there.

So this isn't a case where

the unnamed plaintiffs are going to be debarred from suing
in an appropriate forum.
available.

They have their forum.

It is

We can be sued there.
One final observation, basically, as plaintiff’s

counsel said, this case involves claims of nlusance and
trespass, whether under the federal or the state rubric
and because that is so, we really have a situation which is
a mass tort and I remind this court that the notes to the
advisory committee with respect to the change in Rule 23
said that ordinarily class action treatment would not be
appropriate in mass tort situations and even if the text
writers who were in favor of class actions have come down
in that for the

same reason, and the reasons are just those

that I mentioned, that each and every one of these plaintiffs
is going to have to present a set of different facts to the
court and this certainly would not satisfy the requirement of
rule 23 that common —
Q

Are you suggesting that we might get a

different answer here if they just had a separate injunction?

Q

As far as federal lav; goes?

Well, as far as the permissibility of class

3fi
MR. WHIPPLE:

Well, In either event, your HOnor,

it seems to me that the plaintiffs would be met by the
$10,000 jurisdictional amount and I don’t think that you’d get
a different rule with a different result for that reason.
Q

Of course, the argument you just made,

Hr. V/hipple, that this kind of mass tort thing Is not
amenable to class action, I take it all Petitioner is asking
us to do is to say that the $10,000 jurisdictional amount
doesn’t apply to each and every claimant and he is perfectly
willing to have the district court consider anew whether this
would be manageable as a class action if he was wrong on the
law.
MR. WHIPPLE:
Honor,

I agree, your HOnor.

I agree, your

The fundamental case, the threshold hurdle is whether

the limited jurisdiction that Is always a part of the federal
district court as here is going to be disregarded when we
sweep in these

200 class people, none of whom, according to

complaint, have a jurisdiction claim over $10,000.
Q

Anu I gather you think, Mr. Whipple, that

Clark is an obstacle to the Petitioner’s case, whether or
not state or federal law —
MR. WHIPPLE:

I do, because If it is federal law,

then 1331(a) governs, which speaks of cases arising under the
Constitution, the laws and the treaties of the United States
and that has a $10,000 jurisdiction limit in It and the

3!i
reason for the $10,000 Unit there is just same as it is in
the 1332(a), namely, to try to stave off and to prevent the
ever-mounting caseload,
Q

So that those with less than $10,000 claims

would have to bo to state courts and the state courts, then,
if federal law governs, have to apply common law.
*

I®. WHIPPLE:

On your assumption that the

federal common law would govern, then I think the state
courts v/ould apply federal common law and I argued this
before your Honor in the original case vrhere you directed
is to argue federal common or estate common law and it seems
•<o me there *d be no difficulty there because, as I understand
-t, in trying to evolve a federal common law, the courts
,ook to a variety of sources including relevant state law.
Q

Well, actually, I think we said in

Milwaukee, did we not, that we might, in fashioning federal
rules, consult state standards?
ltd. WHIPPLE:

I think so.

I think that 13 the

clear teaching of Milwaukee and other cases, but I don't
wait you to believe that I am conceding that federal common
liw governs here.
Q

I am not.

I don't.

MR. WHIPPLE:

In summary, from the standpoint of

discretion or power — this is my closing summary, your
Hcnor — ancillary or pendous jurisdiction is improper here

36
because it would impermissibly expand, contrary to Rule 82,
the limited Jurisdiction of the district courts.

It would

multiply, I think in geometric proportions, the rising case­
load of the federal courts.
It would, finally, contrary to the principles
enunciated in Gibbs and I to ore and the principles spelled out
in Snyder, and it would be contrary to the Congressional
purpose underlying the $10,000 limitation.
I may save some time, if necessary, to comment on
Hr*- Langrock’s rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Langrock.
REBUTTAL OF PETER P. LANGROCK, ESQ.,
FOR TIIE PETITIONER
MR. LANGROCK:

I just want to make a couple of

comments with regard to Mr. Whipple’s argument.
about causing a rise in the federal caseload.

He talks
If I read

the mandate of 23(b)3 right, the only time that this could
be done is when it is efficient and the only time when a
court could do so is when it is going to save judicial time,
a cross-state aspect and this parade of horrors which were
suggested by Mr. Whipple, I think, are untrue.
Let us go back to the district court.

I don’t

want to argue here whether we are going to have a mass trial
of 240 people or the merits if the issue.

But I say, let the

37
district court judge look at this thing.

Let him sit on the

issue and make a decision, how am X going to handle this
problem Involving a serious number of people who are
affected in a peculiar way by acts.
Q

Hasn’t he already had something to say about

the manageability factor?
lift, LAHGROCK:

I don’t think so, your Honor.

He

indicated that it could not be managed if he had to separate
out those who had $10,000 and those that didn’t because you'd
define
have to try the damages before you could get to/the class,
but his opinion said, "with great reluctance" he dismissed
the suit because of the holding in Snyder versus Harris and
so I think we should really leave that decision in the hands
of the judge who is going to have to make that decision on
the trial and have to live with it one way or another and
If we lose there, I think that takes care of the issue.
I appologize to the Court before because I did
not recognize the name of Illinois versus Milwaukee.

That

case was decided after we brought this and I am familiar with
the case but X am not quite sure* as Mr. Whipple knows,
exactly what the effect of the common law, of the federal
common law on environmental matters and waterways, how this
would affect it.
In any case, I think we still would be involved in
the $10,000 jurisdictional amount.

Q

You don't think it would help you any, then,

if this were governed by federal lav??
MR. LANGROCK:

It would make the pendent concept —

bring us into pendent situation.
Q

There wouldn’t be any state claim to be

pendent.
MR. LANGROCK:

No, there v?ould be — right, there

would be straight ancillary where right now we’d have to go
into the pendent in part if there is a federal claim in the
both situation.
I also would like — this is not —
Q

Well, I take it from your remark Just then

that the characterisation of the question as an Issue of
federal law, you concede, does not assist you much.
HR. LANGROCK:
have to hit the $10,000.

Mot very much.
The question is

I think we still
still there.

There are other efficiencies which tie into this type of
thing, the efficiencies of expert time, the efficiencies all
the way along the lines in the whole environmental field, but
I don’t think v?e want to get into that.

But the statement

that this sounds in nuisance and trespass are only two of the
three areas which it 30und3.

It also sounds on the property

rights, riparian rights of adjoining owners on a lake or not
at this rate adjoining, but owners on the same body of water
and we think that if ever there was a common nucleus of fact,

35
this is it.
The International Paper Company, we allege, has
done one thing and it has continuously done this thing and
this affects a lax’ge number.

The only difference here would

be the question of damages and that can be handled, we
suggest, in a multitude of ways including the possibility of
a master sorting them out and we don’t see the horrors of
the mass trial.
I can say on the other side that to have 2^0
trials on the issue of the merits frightens me a great deal
more than to have some procedure in dealing with damages
on a common set of facts.
The comment was made that Snyder has nothing for —
that Snyder — that ancillary jurisdiction did not coins in
Snyder.

I would suggest to the Court that Snyder — there

was no jurisdiction to the Court to begin with.

That was

not a case that was going forward and there was nothing
more ancillary to hang its hat onto or to tie into and I
would not have been going forward in the courts because of
the fact that there was not independent jurisdiction, as
there is in this case.
I might suggest to the Court that we may very well
have a class here or there may be other classes vrtxere we have
50 or 200 or 250 or only one or two

claims and to prohibit

the district judge, as a jurisdictional matter, from going

40
forward, is not promoting efficiency, as suggested by my
opponent, but is tying the court's hands for using it in the
proper case.
I am not suggesting for a moment that this matter
should be handled as a class action unless it meets the test
and that test is that it is superior to other matters, other
ways of handling this as an efficient way in the controversy.
The very rule of 23(b)3 itself, if it doesn't
meet that, we are out and if we do meet that, I would hate to
see the district court judge forced, as a jurisdictional
question, to make it a less efficient approach.
Q

I-lr. Langrock?

MR. LANGHOCK:
Q

Yes?

In the Appendix, where your complaint is

reprinted at pages six and seven.

I notice in count one you

say that "the matter in controversy exclusive enters and
causes to each of the named plaintiffs exceeds the sum of
$10,000.

Jurisdiction is founded on 28USC section 1332(a)."
Now, do you contend that at this stage of the case

you have a right to rely on some other jurisdictional basis
rather than what you name in your complaint?
HR. LANGHOCK:

No, I don't , your Honor.

I think

if we went back we'd be subject to the amendment rules, which
might be appropriate but here the question of jurisdiction
has arisen on this one and I think this is where we are here.

I think I’d have to stand on our position.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
Q

One moment.

I have a question.

It is of no

significance and I should know the answer but I do not.

Y/hat

is the comparative state of the calendars of the federal
courts and the state courts in the State of Vermont?
*

MR. LAWGROCK;

The federal calendar is more

current in most parts.
Q.

Are the state calendars greatly uncurrent?

MR. LANGROCK:

Depending on the counties, but

for the most part, the federal courts — the federal court
is as current as any state court calendar and there are some
state court calendars which are substantially behind the
federal court calendar.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 10:£34 o’clock a.m., the case was
submitted.]
