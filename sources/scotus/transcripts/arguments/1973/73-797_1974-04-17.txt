ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL P. S. PAUL
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. PAULs
Courts

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

This case is here on an appeal by the Miami Herald

from a decision of the Florida Supreme Court which sustained
the constitutionality of section 104.33, Florida Statutes.
This appeal involves the constitutionality of that statute on
its face under the First and the Fourteenth Amendments.
This statute involves the question of whether a
newspaper under the First Amendment may be compelled by the
Florida legislature to print the political statements of a
candidate which it does not desire to print.
The facts of this case arose when the appellee, Mr.
Tornillo, became a candidate from Dade County to the Florida
legislature in the 1972 State election.

In 1913 the Florida

legislature had enacted a criminal statute which is reproduced
in the appendix in full at the top of page 47.

That statute

requires a newspaper to give a political candidate free space
to reply to any criticism of the political candidate published
by a newspaper.

The statute on its face applies to criticism

of a candidate whether published in news articles, columns, or

4
editorials.

The truthfulness or fairness of the criticism

is irrelevant under the statute.

And the violation of that

statute is a crime punishable by up to one year in jail and
a fine up to $1,000.

There is no legislative history of the

statute? it was adopted as part of the State Corrupt Practices
in Elections Act.

And there is no record of its use for almost

60 years.
It's first judicial test was in 1972 in State v,_
Mews-Journal.

In that case

QUESTION:

I gather even though on the face of it

it might be read as applicable only to assailing a person
running for a nomination who is already in office.

It has

been given a broader application than that, has it?
MR. PAUL:

I think the statute actually is broader

because the definition of candidate includes a person who
qualifies.

A person who is already in office •—
QUESTIONs

In this case has the Florida Supreme

Court given it that
MR. PAUL:

Yes, the Florida Supreme Court in

interpreting this statute in this case said that it applied
to editorials and other articles.
QUESTION:

Was Mr. Tornill© an officeholder?

MR. PAUL?

No, he was a candidate for an office in

the State legislature.
In the first judicial test of this statute in Florida

5

courts in 1972 in State v, News-Journal , the raayor of Daytona
Beach had the newspaper arrested for refusing to print the
mayor's reply to an article critical of the mayor.

The lower

court held the statute violated free press and due process
guarantees of the TJ.S. and the Florida Constitutions and
dismissed the criminal proceeding.

That decision is

reproduced in the appendix at page 51.
At that time the Florida Attorney General conceded
the invalidity of the statute and refused to appeal the
decision.
Mr. Tornillo became a candidate for the legislature
some seven months later.
October 4, 1972.

That election was scheduled for

On September 20, fourteen days before that

election,, the Herald printed an editorial critical of Mr.
Tornillo8s candidacy.
appendix.

That editorial appears at page 5 of the

It referred to Mr. Tornillo criticising his opponent

for violating the election law.

The editorial pointed out

Mr. Tornillo liras the same one who had led an illegal teacher’s
strike, and the editorial concluded by saying it would be
inexcusable if the voters elected Mr. Tornillo to the legis­
lature.
Mr. Tornillo waited a week, and on September 27
submitted a statement he entitled "Pat Tornillo in the CTA
Record."

He demanded that the Herald print that statement

pursuant to the Florida statute which carries criminal sanction.

6

Mr. TornilXo in his statement did not claim that the editorial
was not truthful, and he did not seek a retraction under the
Florida retraction statute.

He claimed that the Herald was

dwelling on past history and he listed his own accomplishments
during the past four years.
The Herald did not print that statment of candidate
Tornillo.

The Herald printed a second editorial on

September 29 which appears in the appendix at page 8.

Mr.

Tornillo submitted a second statement the next day and
demanded that it be printed.

That statement appears at page 10.

Again, there was no claim that the editorial was false.

The

Herald did not print Mr. Tornillo1s statement.
The next day, on October 1, Mr. Tornillo filed
suit in the Dade County Circuit Court seeking actual and
punitive damages and a mandatory injunction to print his
two statements.

In his complaint Mr. Tornillo alleged that

by this Florida statute, Florida had established "a fairness
doctrine in enacting this compulsory publication statute.”
At

Mr. Tornillo's request, an emergency hearing was

held on the next day, October 2nd.

The Florida Attorney

General was present since a statute of the State’s
constitutionality would be questioned, and he advised the
court that he would not defend the statute as he had done in
the prior case involving the Daytona Beach News“Journal.
The court denied Mr. Tornillo’s request for an

7
Injunction and declared the statute was unconstitutional
because it violated the First Amendment and the due process
guarantees of the Constitution.
Mr. Tornillo then advised the court that he elected
not to proceed further in that case, and the case was therefore
dismissed with prejudice.
Mr. Tornillo appealed directly to the Florida
Supreme Court, and on July 10th of this year in a per curiam
opinion, one Justice dissenting, the Florida Supreme Court
reversed the lower court and held the statute did not violate
either the First nor the Fourteenth Amendment or the due
process guarantees of the Constitution„

That opinion of the

Florida court is in the appendix at page 15.
A rehearing was denied in a second per curiam opinion
of the Florida Supreme Court on October 10, which is also in
the appendix.
The Herald appealed directly to this Court.

On

January 14 the Court agreed to hear the appeal on the merits,
postponing decision on appellee's jurisdictional claim until
the hearing on. the merits.
Appellee has subsequently abandoned his claims that
this Court does not have jurisdiction of this appeal.
The Florida statute that is before the Court today ~—
QUFiSTIONs

Mr. Paul, V7hether or not the appellee has

abandoned the claim, it’s nonetheless one we will have to

8

decide, 1 suppose.

Do you read the Florida Supreme Court's

opinion as conferring any civil right upon TornilXo when the
case goes back to the Circuit Court of Dade County

in

his

right to civilly proceed against your client?
MR. PAUL:

Yes.

I think the Florida Supreme Court

said that there was no injunction remedy under the statute,
W

but they did imply, despite the fact that it was a criminal
statute, a right for civil damages.
QUESTION:

You cite in your brief to pages 16 and

17 of the Appendix the Florida Supreme Court opinion.

There

certainly is no language as such of the Florida Supreme Court
that says he can recover damages, is there?
MR. PAUL:

Yes, I think that the Florida Supreme

Court in that opinion specifically said that the fact that
this was a criminal statute did not mean that a civil right
could not be implied in that decision.
Florida Supreme Court opinion.

That appears in the

I don't have the page right

at hand.
QUESTION:

Don't take up your time.

MR. PAUL:

It's page 40, I believe, in the appendix,

that particular statement.
QUESTION:

Pages 39 and 40.

Bottom line of page 40, it says it

establishes a civil right to damages.
MR. PAUL:

Yes.

"...can easily be severed and

deleted and still leave a complete legislative expression

9

establishing a civil right to damages."
QUESTION;

The bottom of page 40.

That# however# doesn't answer the

jurisdictional question, that is, the question of finality.
MR. PAUL;
that question.

No.

The Court, of course, has to examine

I think, though, that the issue in this case

is the constitutionality on its face of the Florida statute,
and that issue has been fully litigated in the Florida court.
There are no nonconstitutional issues remaining in this case
and the constitutional issue is ripe for determination.
QUESTION;

If the statute is constitutional, the

paper concedes liability?
MR. PAUL;

No, the paper does not concede liability,,

QUESTION; There must be an issue then left.
MR. PAUL;

The remaining issues would be issues

solely of Florida law as to the remedy and as to the amount
of damages.
QUESTION;

You may win.

You may win.

MR. PAUL;

That possibility is —

QUESTION;

We may never have to face it.

MR. PAUL;

I think, though, under the principles

laid down by this Court in Mills v. Alabama, this constitutional
question is now ripe for decision and threatens basic First
Amendment rights, the Florida Supreme Court holding the
statute constitutional.
QUESTION;

And this constitutional issue has been

10
finally settled in the Florida courts.,
MR, PAUL:

Finally settled in the Florida courts,

and a Florida election is scheduled within a few months, and
this statute would seriously inhibit the exercise of First
Amendment rights in the decision of the Florida Supreme Court
which is toward the exercise of those rights.

And I think

under the principles laid down in Mills v. Alabama, this case
is ripe for decision.
To sanction the Florida —
QUESTION;

Am I wrong in recollecting that in Mills ?.

Alabama the newspaper conceded that it had no other defenses?
And here you have just told my brother White that you do have
defenses based upon Florida law, and as he suggested, you
might win and that would be the end. of the case? there would
no longer be a case or controversy.
MR. PAULs

Except that the decision of the Florida

Supreme Court from the point of view of inhibiting the exercise
of First Amendment rights in Florida would still stand even
if the nonconstitutional issues should provide success for the
Miami Herald in this case.
QUESTION:

But you have won this case, and this

Court is here.just to decide cases or controversy.

That is

the extent of our power under Article III.
QUESTION:

How would you be inhibited?

You haven't

printed anything yet that you didn't want to and you're not

13.
about to, X suppose.
MR. PAUL:

The Florida Supreme Court ha3 held this

statute constitutional and, of course, the Herald, in the
absence of a reversal by this Court, would have to abide by
the constitutional ruling of the highest court in its State.
It would therefore vitally affect not only the Herald’s rights
but many other newspaper rights in Florida who would be guided
by that decision in the exercise of their editorial discretion
to determine whether or not to print the replies of political
candidates.
As Mr. Justice Douglas pointed out in his concurring
opinion in Mills v. Alabama, it’s not necessary that the
nonconstitutional issues remaining in the case all be resolved
when the decision of the State court inhibits the exercise
of First Amendment rights.
statute,:'

And to sanction the Florida

this Court would have to make a fundamental revision

of the First Amendment.
QUESTION:

X notice in your reply brief, at least,

you also rely on North Dakota Pharmacy Board.
MR. PAUL:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Where we decided the constitutional

question, notwithstanding there were State laws.
MR. PAUL;

Correct.

I think both of those —-

QUESTION:

That one was not a First Amendment case.

MR. PAUL;

No, it was not a First Amendment case.

12

Of course, again,- it seems really an exercise in futility to
send this case back to decide the nonconstitutional issues
and then have it wind its way back in a long and tortuous
process from the constitutional issue which obviously in the
light of the Florida Supreme Court opinion will have to be
decided.
QUESTION:

If you win, the case wouldn't come back.

It would be the end of it.
MR. PAUL:

You would be the victor.

This case wouldn't, but another case

raising the same issue would come back because the Florida
Supreme Court's decision would still stand. We would not
win on the basis of our constitutional rights.

And I think

that that issue will inhibit the exercise of those rights
in Florida until it is settled.
QUESTION:

Before the North Dakota case, do you

think you might have had some serious troubles on jurisdiction
here?
MR. PAUL:

Yes, I think we might.

QUESTION:

You rest on that very firmly, X noticed,

in your reply brief.
MR. PAUL;

Yes.

Compelling a newspaper to print is the same as
telling it what not to print.
the First Amendment.

It is censorship forbidden by

There is a national policy that has

been expressed in the First Amendment that newspapers should

13

not be deterred in printing what they choose, particularly
about political candidates.
As Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out in his opinion
in the CBS case, the First Amendment protects newspapers from
the intrusive editorial thumb of Government.

If there is any

area where the role of the press under the First Amendment must
remain unfettered, it is criticism of political candidates of
the very kind expressed in this case.

One of the chief roles

of the press is vigorous criticism of candidates and of public
officials.

Newspapers historically in this country have been

in the business of grinding axes, particularly political ones.
Editorial discretion and judgment must mean freedom to choose
what to print and what not to print.
As Mr. Chief Justice Burger pointed out in the
Columbia Broadcasting case, editing is what editors are for
and editing is the selection and choice of material.
The only restraints on the autonomy of the press
which this Court sanctioned in the Columbia Broadcasting case
in its nonbusiness aspects are the restraints imposed by
its readers and by its journalistic integrity.

The attempts

at regulation of fairness or balance of newspapers strikes
at the very core of the First Amendment.

As Professor Barron

concedes in his writings, it would lead to the press being
treated as a public utility and licensing of the press would
be the result, and there would be a return to the conditions

14
which led to the adoption of the First Amendment to begin with.
Freedom of the press,, not fairness, is what the
First Amendment is concerned with.
the editors.

Fairness has been left to

As Mr. Justice Stewart points out in his opinion

in the CES case, fairness is too fragile a commodity to be
left to the Government to decide.
Although the Florida statute is vague and ambiguous,
it is certainly broad in scope.

It may be invoked by any

candidate who has filed for local. State, or Federal office.
In fact, it may be invoked by an incumbent public official
as soon as he qualifies for reelection and becomes a candidate.
It applies to any criticism of a candidate published in the
newspaper»

It’s not limited to editorial criticism.

It

applies, at the very least, to news articles, to syndicated
columns, to cartoons.

In fact, the statute could be triggered

by a news article in which one candidate assails another, a
reply is demanded, the other candidate demands a counter reply,
and an entire round-robbin ad infinitum could be set up in
the newspaper.

One article which criticized several candidates

would trigger as many replies as there were candidates
criticised 5 each under the statute would be entitled to his
separate reply.

It would apply to newspapers whether or not

they were published in Florida.
QUESTION;

What would happen if they published an

editorial against all of the candidates of one political party?

15

Would each one of them have an answer?
MR» PAUL;

Under the Florida statute, each of the

candidates would have an answer.

A New York Times story, for

example, on Florida politics would trigger the statute and the
New York Times under penalty of criminal sanctions would he
required to accept replies of Florida candidates.
And again I emphasise this statute applies without
regard to the truth or the falsity or the fairness of the
original article, regardless of whether there t*as any malice
involved. In fact, this statute stands the libel standards of
the New York Times v. Sullivan on its head.

Newspapers which

publish something which is true may be required to publish
a totally false reply.
As I said, the statute carries criminal penalties.
The editor could be put in jail for up to a year and fined
a thousand dollars in addition to the civil remedies which
have been implied by the Florida Supreme Court.
Now, the appellee seeks to justify this sweeping
incursion on the First. Amendment on the ground that the State
has an interest in fair elections and that this justifies this
abridgement.
We submit that such an argument ignores this Court’s
holding in Mills v. Alabama which interestingly is not cited
in the Florida Supreme Court opinion or in appellee’s brief.
In the Mills case, it was argued in defense of that Alabama

16

statute that purity of elections justifies this aver-so-slight
abridgement of the First Amendment made by the statute not
to publish anything critical of a candidate on Election Day.
Nevertheless, the Court struck that statute down on the ground
that the State’s interest in fair elections could not justify
an abridgement of the First Amendment.
Secondly, we are told by appellee that the statute
is justified by the economic concentration of the media.
However, there is nothing in the record to justify appellee’s
argument that the media is now one vast monolith.

The facts

are that there is much more diversity in the media and in the
number of media than at the time the First 2tosndraenfc was
adopted.

But again the Court has found in the Associated Press

case that even antitrust violations do not justify infringement
of the First Amendment.
Of course, the press has power„

It’s obvious that

the press has to have power to assure its editorial independence
and to assure that it can fulfill its role under the First
Amendment.
Interestingly enough, the argument made in this
case for this statute and the benefits it theoretically would
provide, the statute would have exactly the opposite effect.
Newspapers, particularly small ones, with space limitations
would be deterred in publishing political criticism for fear
of triggering the statute.

Publications, for example, with

17
a distinct editorial viewpoint would have the greatest dilemma
of all.

Will the twelve black newspapers serving the black

community in Florida have to give equal time to George Wallace
to reply as a candidate despite the views of the particular
editor of that nev/spaper and the community which it serves?
There are many other examples, but we submit that
an examination of this statute on its face dictates that the
opinion of the Florida Supreme Court must be reversed.
I would like to save the rest of my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Barron.
ORAL .ARGUMENT OF JEROME A.. BARRON
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. BARRON:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

My name is Jerome Barron, and I am counsel for

appellee, Pat Tornillo.
The first thing I think I would like to do is to
answer a question, and that question is who is Pat Tornillo.
As I read the host of briefs filed in this case on the other
side, I had to scratch my head sometimes to remember who
Tornillo was, because as I read the briefs, it sounded like
he was some high official in the Government.
Pat Tornillo is the executive director of the
Classroom Teachers Association, of Dade County, Florida, and he
is a very controversial fellow, and he intends to remain being

1C
a very controversial fellow.

Mr. Tornillo led the School

teachers of Florida in a strike which angered the Governor of
Florida, and it also angered the Miami Herald as we are
reminded in these editorials in the appendix in this case.
That is everybody's right to be angered and to say what they
please under our Constitution.
What Mr. Tornillo wanted, however, when he read these
editorials was to fulfill his role, to use a phrase in the
Mew York Times v. Sullivan, this Court's own phrase, he wanted
to Serve a role as a citizen critic of Government.
Mr. Tornillo had an advantage over other people who
had had media problems.

First of all, he lived in a State

which has and has had a right of reply statute since 1913.
Secondly, he had the advantage of this Court's plurality
opinion in Rosenbloom v. Metromedia.

And in that case, if

there is any quotation that is important in this case, any
particular portion of the opinion that's in Rosenbloom

that

is important, it is the passage which is very short, but I
would like to bring it to the Court's attention, in 403 U.S. 29,
page 47, Mr. Justice Brennan joined by Mr. Justice Blackmun
and Chief Justice Burger, said this;
"If the States fear that private citizens will not
be able to respond adequately to publicity involving them,
the solution lies in the direction of insuring their ability
to respond

rather than in stifling public discussion of

19

matters of public concern.”
To me the paradox of this case is that we have
mountains of print in this case about censorship and the only
person who has been censored in this proceeding is Pat
Tornillo.
The question before the Court, the question presented
by the statute is if a candidate during the course of an
election is editorially attacked by a daily newspaper in his
community, may a State statute afford him a reply of similar
amount of space?

That is the question before the Court.

QUESTION?

Or to put it another way, for instance,

you cannot reply to an editorial,by merely becoming a candidate
automatically gets that right.
MR. BARRONs

That8s right, Mr. Justice Marshall.

In other words, the position, of course, is that generally there
are no access rights to the media.

That is the law.

You are

quite right, Mr. Justice Marshall.

The point is that if one

becomes a candidate and one is attacked, then —
QUESTIONs

If the editorial is written against Joe.

Doakes calling him anything and really condemning him to high
heaven and Joe Doakes says, "I know how to fix him.
become a candidate."

I'll

But under this statute, even if a man

does that deliberately, this statute covers it.
MR. BARRON:

Not quite, Mr. Justice Marshall, because

the media would still have the upper hand because if they have

20

attacked hira prior to the time he became a candidate and then
he becomes a candidate, they still would be able to deny him
forump

under the statute, as long as they don’t editorially

attack him*
QUESTION:

Well, let me put it another way.

If he

is an ordinary citizen and he is attacked, he can get no
redress unless he becomes a candidate.
MR. BARRON:
QUESTION:

And is attacked.
Well, after that, if he hadn’t become a

candidate, he could still be attacked, couldn’t he?
MR. BARRON:
QUESTION:

Yes, he could be attacked.
So to insulate him from attack he becomes

a candidate.
MR. BARRON:
QUESTION;
MR. BARRON:

Yes.

But my point —

And the statute would cover it.
I don't believe that the statute goes

quite that far, Mr. Justice Marshall.

As I read the statute,

the attack would have to come after he has become a candidate.
QUESTION:
MR. BARRON:

That’s what. I’m saying.
If that’s what you are saying, I agree

with you.
QUESTION:
MR. BARRON;

Then he’s insulated from then on,
He is insulated from not being able to

respond.
QUESTION:

That's right

21
MR, BARRON:

Correct,

Yes,, sir.

There has been considerable discussion in the argument
of the appellant about the criminal features of the statute.
In the complaint that was filed in this ca3e, no criminal
sanctions were ever asked for.

Moreover, in the petition for

rehearing when the same parties in amici

who are here made

the same argument about the criminality of the statute 104.38,
the Florida Supreme Court on page 39 in its petition for
rehearing said that no criminal penalty is sought in the case
sub judice.

They emphasize that; they said that very clearly

on page 39.

And therefore, the validity vel non of the

criminal penalty is not here involved.
Now, obviously the court only wanted to pass upon the
case before them.

But they certainly prepared the way for the

future in case there was a criminal proceeding because they
said on the very next page, page 40 of the appendix, anticipating
a criminal penalty, they said, the statute is so constructed
that the criminal penalty can be easily severed and deleted
and still leave a complete legislative expression establishing
a civil right to damages.
That language has to be read in conjunction with
the second paragraph on page 39 — I believe these two pages
of

the decision below are very fundamental for an understanding

of this case.

If you look at paragraph two on page 39, what

they talk about is the fact that what was sought by TornilXo

22

was tile publication of a reply.
this Court is

That is all that is before

a simple proceeding to enforce a reply.

We

quite understand the reason and the drive to have this considered
as a criminal penalty in hopes of invalidating.

But that

simply is not this procedure;, that is not this proceeding at

ai 11.
This statute can be justified on two very familiar
propositions of constitutional law.

The first is that some

regulation, some regulation of the press is permissible so
long as it serves an overriding police power purpose.
Along with our brief in the merits to this Court, we
submitted an appendix, our own appendix of 146 pages, reciting
various kinds of State statutes which restrict the press.

The

primary motivation in preparing that appendix which collects
statutes about restricting electioneering at the polls and
reporting boycotts in newspapers and in reporting the names
of rape victims in newspapers, and so on.
was not to glory in regulation at all.

The point of that

It was because we

thought the statute that we are defending is so much superior.
Why did we think it was so much superior?

Because

unlike the legislation that I am talking about, this statute
does not detract from expression one iota.
adds to the realm of discretion.

What it does is it

So that this statute has the

unique feature of both responding to a police power purpose
in free and fair and honest elections and implementing one of

23

the grand ideas .in this Court's opinion in Mew York Times v.
Sullivan when this Court said that it considered that famous
case against a profound commitment, national commitment, to
debate vigorous, free and wide open.
QUESTIONs

Nothing in this Court's opinion in the

New York Times, though, suggested that one person would have
a right to comandeer somebody else's printing press and make
his expression that way, did it?
MR. BARRON:
your question this way.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, let me answer
In the rich case law that has developed

since the Supreme Court’s decision in New York Times v. Sullivan
in 1964, for example, if you take the cases that go from New
York Times v. Sullivan to Rosenbloom v, Metromedia in! 1971,
I think you see the breakdown of an implied premise in New
York Times v. Sullivan.
the word

The case talks — and I just gave

the case talks about the word "debate”.

And I

think the assumption of this Court was that if the media are
free, as perhaps they should be, frora the spectre of heavy
damage suits that can put them out of business, that than we
would have vigorous criticism of governmental institutions, and
of public issues as was finally held in result of this Court in
Rosenbloom.

However, by the time the New York Times v. Sullivan

fact situation was extended, first from elected public officials
to nonelected public officials, to public figures, and finally
in Rosenbloom just to anyone involved in a public issue, what

24
happened was, as this Court pointed out in its plurality
opinion in Rosenbloom, the situation arose or the conclusion
developed that it may not be true that debate will come merely
by removing newspapers from heavy libel suits for damages.
That is why in the plurality opinion it was suggested, not
that damages revisited was the answer, but rather that the
answer might be to allow.some kind of reply.
Florida, with profound judgment has precisely the
statute geared to fulfill that purpose, to let New York Times v.
Sullivan live but yet to have debate.
QUESTION;

What if Mr. Tornillo, in the course of

his campaign, had announced after this editorial attack that
on next Friday night he was going to take care of the Miami
Herald and had announcements throughout the week in advertising
to build up an audience on that conflict and that on Wednesday
the Miami Herald said they wanted equal time and would like to
have one of their editors or someone present to answer him.
Do you think Mr. Tornillo would have to yield half of the
time on the platform in the hall he had rented for that
occasion?
MR, BARRON:

He would not, Mr. Chief Justice, because

Florida
QUESTION:
MR. BARRON:

The statute doesn’t apply to him.
The statute does not apply to him.

May I just speak a little further to your point,

25
because I think again it's a fundamental point in this case.
This case has occasioned apparently a good deal of interest.
Yet, again as I had to struggle as I read through the briefs
of the amici and so on to remember who Mr. Tornillo was, I
also had to struggle to remember what this case was about.
This case has nothing to do with the establishment as a
matter of constitutional case law of a right of reply with
all the problems of establishing parameters that that would
involve.

This case raises a much more narrow and a much more

conventional constitutional question, and that question is
if a State by statute fulfilling a police power purpose, a
purpose that goes directly to implementing the Electoral

Code,

if a State passes a statute which also happens to respond to
the interests of public debate, New York Times y. Sullivan,
is such a statute constitutional?

And it seems to me, Mr.

Chief Justice, that, is a much more limited and a much more
familiar task for constitutional adjudication.
QUESTION;

Now, one step further in my question,

I

had only a preliminary, suppose Florida had a statute which
required a candidate for office who attacks a newspaper to
give equal time in the place and setting in which he made the
attack on the newspaper, would you then have an approximate
parallel to this statute?
MR. BARRON;

No, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not believe

you would for this reason:

From Marsh v. Alabama to many

26

First Amendment cases ever since, one of the insistent themes
of this Court has been are there alternative avenues of
communication?

•

I am not frankly worried about the access problems
of the Miami Herald with a circulation of 350,000, the dominant
paper in the State of Florida with 82 percent of the circulation
in Dade County.

The other newspaper, the Miami News, has only

about 80,000 in circulation.

So that under this Court’s own

principle in terms of alternative means, in terms of restriction
on free expression, it seems to me that the constitutional
case for this statute would be much greater than a statute
governing that situation.
It is not. our position here, it is not our position
here that we wish the newspapers of this country to say
anything in their editorials that they do not wish to say.
Let them say what they please.
Which perhaps none of us wanted.
of the press.

But what we have is a situation
I do not see any conspiracy

To the contrary, we live here in the 20th

century where economics and technology have given us a world
perhaps we did not want.

And what our task is is to try to

make an adjustment so that freedom of speech and press as we
understand it and as we believe in it can endure.
problem.

That’s our

It seems to me that we can. get guidance from this

case in terms of what the First Amendment is all about and
how this statute responds to that . from Mr. Justice Brandeis’

27
great and eloquent concurring opinion in Whitney v. California»
tod what Mr. Justice Brandeis said there was in a couple of
famous pages, he said that liberty could be a means as well as
an end, and that is why I respectfully disagree with the
appellants and all the sincere people I do not doubt on the
other side.

I do not believe it is completely beyond the power

of the State to say that if someone is attacked to the point
of destruction, he cannot reply.

I do not believe the First

Amendment means that.
QUESTION;

But you can attack to destruction anybody

in Florida except a candidate.
MR. BARRON;

That is true, your Honor, and it is a

situation I regret, but it is a fact.

But we make progress

in life incrementally, and I believe that the sustaining of
this statute would be progress in terms of the First Amendment.
Now, I would like just to say a couple of other
things with regard to Mr. Justice Brandeis' opinion in Whitney v.
California because I really think it is terribly dispositive
and helpful to this proceeding. Mr. Justice Brandeis asked
two questions, and after all this is a person who himself had
studied the press, Mr. Justice Brandeis.

The most famous of

all Law Review articles is his article on the right of privacy
in the Harvard Lav/ Review.

And Mr. Justice Brandeis said two

things as to why we have First Amendment protection.
First of all, he said we have First Amendment

28
protection because public discussion is a political duty»
die. he mean by public discussion is a political duty?

What

He meant

thit public discussion is a political duty in the sense of
'Viat we talk about today in our contemporary language, the
mblic's right to know»
Then he said something else,? v/hich I think is equally
responsive and significant in trying to ascertain the validity
of this legislation.

Mr. Justice Brandeis said, opportunity to

air supposed grievances is the path of safety.

Opportunity to

air supposed grievances is the path of safety.

What did he

mean by that?

Obviously, what he meant by that is that if we

are going to have things like freedom of speech and press,
if we are going to have a free society, then people have to
have a sense of justice about existing institutions.

Ke

believed that if they could reach an audience, that if we could
have what this Court has always talked about, debate, then
our institutions,our free, institutions would be secure.
It seems to me that 104.30, the Florida right of
reply statute, both permits the airing of supposed grievances -notice how artfully Mr. Justice Brandeis wrote.

He didn’t

say they were legitimate grievances; he said supposed grievances.
I find it shocking that the people on the other side should
say, well, they can publish a false reply.
I have no quarrel with it

This Court — and

has given the media the opportunity

to write false replies in the sense — false editorials, rather,

29

in the sense that we are not interested whether ultimately in
the eye of eternity something is true or false.

Unless we can

show caicuiatedly that it is false, from a First Amendment
point of view, we are not interested because we know that in
the hurly-burly of free debate we cannot stop and pause to verify
the statement.

But by the same law and doctrine that gives

that latitude to the Miami Herald, should not Tornillo, if a
State statute has given it to him, should he not have also the
same remedy, the same right?
QUESTIONS
MR. BARRON;
QUESTION;
question.

Professor Barron —
Yes, Justice Blaokmun.
Your eloquence prompts me just to ask one

Perhaps you can help me over the hurdle.

For better

or for worse, we have opted for a free press, not for free
debate.
MR. BARRON;
is not so.

Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I hope that

I hope that we have, we can work out an accommoda­

tion between the two.

It seems to me it is not necessary to

change any of our ideas about what should be in the content
of editorials.

On the other hand, in terms of the realities

that X adverted to before, I think it is possible for us to
have both.

I think it is possible if we go with a.

statute

that is careful enough and a situation that cries out for
some redress of injustice as this one does,
can have both.

it seems to me we

30

Now, ifc may be that we could have situations where
the two would be incompatible.

I do not believe that this is

such a case.
I would like to address myself to another argument
that has been made here.
argument.

That is the so-called chilling effect

I am a teacher of constitutional law.

I am supposed

to know what chilling effect means, whether 1 do or not.

But

in any case chilling effect comes from Dombrowski v. Ffister.
What was Dombrowski v. Ffister all about?

Dombrowski v. Pfisfcer

was a case where civil rights workers wanted to engage in
activity and expression that was unquestionably protected
and they were faced with a situation where law enforcement
people said in effect, "We will prosecute you? we don't care
whether we win or not? we will prosecute you, we will fix your
First Amendment rights."

So that the spectre of prison was

a•threat to the implementation of free expression.
Is that this case?

The Florida court, it seems to

me, has done all that any State court can do, in a case that
did not involve a request for criminal sanctions, to exclude
the possibility of criminal prosecution.

It seems to me that

the chilling effect that was ta.lked about in Dombrowski is a
world away from the cry we have heard in this case, which is
that if we must give our opponents a forum, we would rather
say nothing.

To call that chilling effect, I think we have

to ask a questions

Who, then, is putting the chilling effect

31

on the expressiori of constitutional rights?
QUESTION:

Of course, the only entity that the First

Amendment is directed against is the Government.

I take it

the Miami Herald can chill anybody’s rights to their heart’s
content and they are not violating the Constitution.
MR. BARRON:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that would be

true absent the statute, that if we had a request, as Mr.
Justice Marshall is suggesting, by a private citizen absent
the statute, then -- and I think this is what your question was
addressed to, then we would have a State action problem.
QUESTION:
addressed to.

No, that isn't what my question is

What you are saying is in effect that the real

chilling here comes from the Miami Herald.
MR. BARRON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Well, there is nothing in the Constitution

that prevents a private person from chilling anybody's First
Amendment right.
MR. BARRON:

But I would suggest, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, that since this Court has held time without number
that the First Amendment is not an absolute, that a State
statute imposes some duties on the Miami Herald changes that
situation.
QUESTION:

Then you come down to the question

whether a State statute can impose.
MR. BARRON:

You are back to your *—

Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice, that is the

32
question.

The question is whether this statute is consistent

with the First Amendment.. And our position is a twofold one.
It's a very simple position.

First, that it is justified by

an overriding police power purpose, First Amendment and police
power ideas; and secondly, and this is what we believe to be
the unique feature of the case, that since it adds to expression
rather than detracts from expression» that what it does really is
instead of offending the First Amendment, it implements it, at
least under this statute and with these facts.
QUESTION:

What's the difference between the State

saying you shall publish
not publish A

A

and the State saying you shall

under the First Amendment?

MR. BARRON:

Mr. Justice Marshall, I believe there

is a great difference.

To respond directly to your question,

if the State shall say, "You shall not publish," then I think
we are by anyone's reckoning, anyone’s view of the First
Amendment, in the historic area of censorship.

Whereas if you

say that a State -- if a State says you shall publish a reply,
then you are not telling the newspaper it may not print
something or even that it must -

take a position that it

dislikes.
QUESTION:

You said would not make them take a

position they dislike.
MR, BARRON:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
The Miami Herald didn't want to publish it.

33

MR. BARRON:
QUESTION:
MR. BARRON:

That is correct.

What I mean —

You might start over again.
I'm sorry.

What I mean by that, Mr.

Justice Marshall, is that institutionally they are still free,
if this statute is sustained, every paper in Florida will still
be free editorially to attack anyone they wish.
QUESTION:

And then publish what they don't want to

publish.
MR. BARRON:
QUESTION:
MR. BARRON:

That is correct.
And that is not governmental control.
I would suggest that it is not govern™

mental control of a degree that is anywhere larger than any
of the statutes that restrict the press that we have called
to your attention.
QUESTION:
MR. BARRON:

Not like this one.
Well, you take, if a statute says that

a newspaper cannot mention the name of a rape victim in the
paper, that, of course, is something they cannot say.
QUESTION:
MR. BARRON:

Now, —

It was cited that ~
This Court has a case before it new

Cor v. Cohn Broadcasting which raises that very question, and
there again you have just as in this case, Mr. Justice Marshall,
you have really competing constitutional claims.
QUESTION;

Suppose the State says that every newspaper

must publish any material that can be classified as debate by

34
any politician who offers it?
MR. BARRON;

Would that be constitutional?

I would have great doubt about the

constitutionality.
QUESTION:

That sure would build up the debate you

have been talking about.
MR. BARRON:

No, because — no, Mr. Justice Marshall

I don't believe it would because —
QUESTION:

You don't believe it would?

If you gave

a politician a right to print something in the newspaper?
MR. BARRON:

We are not sure that we have responsive

ness.

The whole idea of the right of reply is to responsive­

ness.

If we have attack and reply, then it seems to me we

are in a debate.
QUESTION:
MR. BARRON:

I see.
So I think that differs from your

hypothetical that you suggest.
But may I just in the remaining time that I have
and adverting to the facts of Cox v. Cohn Broadcasting before
this Court, it seems to me that what we have there of course
is

a

right of privacy problem against a free press problem.

The fascinating thing about this case, of course, is that we
have competing First Amendment interests in conflict.

Unless

you take the view that the only people who are protected by
freedom of the press are those who work in media and own stock
in it, unless you take that view —-

35
QUESTION: Is that such a naive view?
MR. BARRON:

It is not a naive view, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, but it seems to me it is an inadequate view, for
this reason:

I think that just in view of the inability to

respond, as this Court talked about in Rosenbloom, that it is
a danger really to free expression if exhaust the free
expression right of the American people with the property rights
of those who own communication facilities.

This is not to say

that those who own and work in such facilities do not have
First Amendment rights; of course they do.

The question is

can we afford some modicant, some slight legislative aid to
make the debate we have all been talking about a reality.
And it is ray position that the sustaining of the statute would
lead precisely to that.
Now, if the argument is that, as Mr. Justice
Marshall pointed out, one could be presented with statutes '
which would raise grave problems.

Then the answer to that, as

this Court has said again time and time without number, it is
part of the task and the obligation of constitutional
adjudication to draw lines and to say beyond this point we
will not go.

But we have not reached that point, we have far

from reached it in this case.
Your Honor, I think I have said all that I wish to
say.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

36

Do you have anything further? Hr, Paul?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL P. S. PAUL
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. PAUL:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice? and may it please the

Just briefly I would like to clear up two misstatements

by Professor Barron in reference to the statute.

He refers

to the statute as applying only to criticism published in
a newspaper published in the same community where the candidate
is.

There is no such limitation in the statute.

As I said,,

it would apply to the New York Times if it happened to
publish something about a particular Florida election and
the candidates involved.

And it's not. correct to say that the

criminal penalty can be detached from the statute.

The Florida

Supreme Court has left the criminal penalty standing? but
there is no way that any candidate can get a reply under this
statute by any other way than the criminal penalty because
the Florida Supreme Court has knocked out the mandatory
injunction penalty? on the old common law theory that equity
will not enjoin a crime? a rule which is followed in Florida.
So without the criminal penalty? this would not provoke any
reply.
Mr. Barron keeps talking about Mr. Tornillo being
censored.

There is absolutely nothing in this record to

support any such assertion that Mr. Tornillo didn't get his
message across.

Mr. Barron describes Mr. Tornillo as a public

37
figure and as a controversial roan.

We would have to be very

naive to think that. Mr. Tornillo was relying entirely on a
paragraph statement in the Miami Herald in order to get his
message across in his campaign.

There is nothing that shows

that he was muzzled.
But I think the nub of it comes down to the
conclusion remarks that Professor Barron made when he says
that this cases poses competing First Amendment interests in
conflict.

There are no competing First Amendment interests

in conflict here.
the press.

There is no First Amendment right to use

There is no right of a citizen to be interviewed

by the press.

There is no right to have a letter that a

citizen may write to the press to have that letter printed.
As Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out yesterday in the prison
cases,, the editor might just as well throw that letter in the
wastebasket if he determines that he does not desire to print
it.

A judicial inquiry into the editorial discretion and the

editorial function is not permissible under the First
Amendment,

Compulsion is the same as censorship and there

is no difference between saying that you shall publish and
you shall not publish under the First Amendment.
As Mr. Justice Blackrnun pointed out, our founding
fathers in writing the First Amendment opted for a free press
not a fair press.

They decided fairness was too fragile an

issue for them to deal with.

It's the only First Amendment we

38

have, as pointed out in the Columbia Broadcasting case and
it is not the function of the Court

to rewrite that amendment,.

The issue is really who decides what gets into the newspaper,
the Government, the Florida legislature, or the editor of a
free newspaper?

There is no constitutional right for the

Florida legislature to regulate the fairness of political
criticism without violating the First Amendment,
I understand that Professor Barron says this is a
noble concept, but motherhood is, as one editor pointed out,
also a noble condition, but motherhood under compulsion is
the product of rape and it begets illegitimacy.

And to force

an editor to put in his editorial judgment what he does
not desire and his conscience does not wish to print or he
may think is not true is a clear violation of the First
Amendment.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted,

above-entitled matter was concluded.]
