MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Mills.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MILLS, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MILLS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is on Certiorari to the First Circuit Court
of Appeals to review a judgment of that court vacating an order
of the District Court for the District of Massachusetts which
had denied without prejudice a petition for habeas corpus
presented by the respondent pursuant to Title 28, Section 2254.
The basis of the State custody of the petitioner in
that proceeding had been effected by a conviction in the State
Trial Court of murder in the first degree and possession of
firearms violations.
The respondent was indicted in May of 1967 for
murder in the first degree and firearm possession charges.
He was apprehended approximately twenty months later and was
brought to trial with a co-defendant, one Gagliardi, in April
of 1969.
The petitioner wishes to stress the component of that
trial.

The trial was a seven-day trial.

It was preceded -with

pre-trial discovery, including eight pre-trial discovery motions,

4
seven of which were allowed.
One of the pre-trial discovery motions was a motion
for bill of particulars, which, according to Massachusetts
practice, was read to the jury.
Additionally, the trial included opening instructions
by the judge to the jury, opening remarks by counsel, the
testimony of too primary police witnesses, too secondary police
witnesses, a chemist, a ballistician, a pathologist, too FBI
agents and several civilian witnesses.
Additionally, at the course of the trial, several
exhibits we-re introduced, including weapons and documents.
Additional components of the trial included closing
remarks by the Assistant District Attorney, defense counsel,
closing instructions by the jury and an unsworn statement by
the respondent as a defendant, a practice which was in effect
in 1969 in Massachusetts.
It should also foe noted that the trial was preceded
by a view.
Those are the components of the trial, the fairness
of which is in question before this Court today.
The uncontradicted evidence before the Court tended
to show that the respondent, along with three other persons,

was

seen in a car at approximately 4:00 o*clock in the morning

on April IS, 1967.

He was seen there by too police officers,

each of whom testified at the trial.

5
The uncontradicted evidence further tends to shot#
that when Gagliardi, the co-defendant, was the driver of the
car, that the respondent in the case before this Court, then
defendant, DeChristoforo, was a passenger in the rear seat of
the car, seated behind Gagliardi, that a third live passenger,
one Oreto, was also seated in the back seat, and that a fourth
person, one Lansi, who appeared to be asleep, was in the front
passenger seat of the car.
The evidence further tends to show that DeChristoforo
and Gagliardi were questioned by the police at the scene prior
to the determination by the police that Lansi was not, in fact,
asleep, but was dead, having been shot once in the head and
three times in the side.
Apparently, and according to the uncontradicted
testimony, DeChristoforo and Gagliardi were questioned at the
scene.

Evidence which is contested, in part, was introduced

at the trial to show that at the scene, respondent DeChris tof oro,
when questioned as to his own identity and purpose, gave the
police a wrong name, a wrong description of the reason why they
were there in that place and identified the deceased victim
by a name other than his own.

In effect, the respondent said

— did not say that his name was DeChristoforo, said that the
deceased person had been injured in a fight in Revere and was
being taken to the hospital and gave a wrong description,
a wrong name with respect to the deceased.

6
Gag Hard i and the responderit; DeChristoforo then left
the scene.

It was then determined that Lanai was dead.
The third occupant, the third live occupant of the

car,was arrested at that time.
During the course of the trial, additionally there
was evidence that death had been caused by gunshot wounds that
occurred in the car between 3:00 and 4:00 o’clock in the morning.
Additionally, at the scene, the police found a 38
revolver in the back seat where Oreto had been seated,that had
been shot once.
An additional weapon, a Derringer, fully leaded, on
the floor in front of the seat where respondent DeChristoforo
had been seated, and it was also evidenced at the trial that a
third revolver was later found buried in an area adjacent to the
location of the car, and evidence by way of ballistics was
introduced to show that the wound in the head of the decedent
had been caused by the gun that was found on the back seat and
that the three shots in the side of the decedent had been caused
by that revolver that was later found buried near the scene.
Mow, at the close of all of the evidence, co-defendant
Gagliardi pleaded guilty in the absence of the jury,

jury was brought into the courtroom, the trial judge instrueted,
or remarked to the jurors, and I quote, and the quote

asked and no instruction was given.

Ho instruction was
Therefore, respondent's

counsel proceeded with his closing argument to the jury.
The prosecutor’s argument, as is the custom in
Massachusetts, followed the defence counsel’s closing argument»
And, at the beginning, I hesitate to read to the
Court, and yet I am reluctant to read a single remark to this
Court without reading some of the context in which that single
remark occurred.
Q

What are you reading from?
MR. MILLS:

From petitioner’s brief, page 9.

The

prosecutor’s closing remark in its entirety appears in the

record Appendix.
The prosecutor’s closing argument.

Let me preface

my argument by saying that, first of all, I am aware that what
I say is really an argument, because the word ’’argument"’ pre­
supposes that I am prejudiced to the cause that I represent,

which, of course, I am.
"I think that the very nature of the system, being
adversary, pitting one side against the other, naturally makes
you point to those things which you think support your particular
position and to more or less ignore those things which 1
suppose detract from it."
I would like to skip down one paragraph and I will
cease reading.
"And I realise that my closing argument should be in
no way considered by you as any evidence in the case, and 1 am
sure that you won't consider it as that, and I am sure that my
opening statement to you is in no way evident in the case and
won’t be considered by you as evidence."
The prosecutor, in his argument, the Assistant
District Attorney, then went on to explain to the jury his
version of the case, but suffice it to say that he argued to
the jury.

His argument is included in full in the record

Appendix.
During that argument, the Assistant District Attorney
made a statement which is contained in all of the papers in the
case and in petitioner's brief at page 11.
"I don't know what they want you to do by way of a
verdict.

They said they hope you find him not guilty.

I quite

frankly think that they hope that you find him guilty of something
a little less than first-degree murder."

9
An objection to this remark was immediately made
and although the record is not completely clear on the point,
and 1 respectfully direct the Court's attention to the record
Appendix at page 129, at that point, Mr. Smith said, "I object
to that.81

The court said, "I don’t think -- ." "Mr. Smith:

That's not fair argument.88

"The court:

Ho."

"Mr. Smith:

That isn’t so."
I think it is fair to say that the Assistant District
Attorney then proceeded with his argument, talking about another
topic.
The record shows that the trial judge indicated that
had an objection -- that the objection had, in fact, been
sustained, and that had counsel requested instructions at that
time, they would have been given.
Q

Mr. Mills, I am just curious.

The prosecutor here

was a Mr. Irwin, wasn't it?
MR. MILLS:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Is he the one who is now the Assistant AG of

Massachusetts?
MR. MILLS:

He is an Assistant Attorney General in

Massachusetts, Your Honor.
Q

Whose name is on the briefs here.
MR. MILLS:

It is, yes. Your Honor.

May it please the Court:
Following the closing argument of the Assistant District

10

Attorney, the defendant, now respondent in this Court, was
allowed to make an unsworn statement to the jury.

Thereafter,

followed the instructions of the court.
Q

So the unsworn statement by the defendant comes after

the closing argument of counsel in Massachusetts?
MR. MILLS:

Yes, Your Honor, it does,

although there

is a question as to whether or not there is any such thing any
more in Massachusetts called an unsworn statement.
Q

But it did at this time?
MR, MILLS:

In 1969, yes, Your Honor.

The judge, in his charge **- first, I think it is only
fair to say something about instructions that were requested
by the defendant, now respondent's counsel.
Specific instructions to the jury, by way of a writing,
were made to the court.
Appendix.

They are also contained in the record

The court did not give the specific instructions that

wore requested by defendant's counsel.
The court charged the jury, and the portion of the
charge which we wish this Court to consider is contained on
page 142 of the record Appendix.
Given the fact that the defendant's unsworn statement
had been the most immediate preceding event in the trial,
following the charge, the trial judge -- and we suggest
properly — first commented upon the unsworn statement, basically
saying we suggest that it is not evidence.

13.
And at page 143, the judge instructed the jury —
and I beg the Court's indulgence for permission to read his
instruction.
"Let me begin this charge by saying to you, that, as
I have said with regard to unsworn statements, not subject to
cross-examination of the defendant, it is not evidence, nor are
arguments of counsel nor the opening of counsel -- whether it
be the Assistant District Attorney in this case or whether it
be Mr. Smith — It is not evidence for your consideration.
"Opening of counsel made by either the District
Attorney or Mr. Smith on behalf of his client are not evidence,
but the}5' are merely the statements by the District

Attorney

or by Mr. Smith, the defense counsel, for what they respectively
hope to prove.”
Drop down two lines.
To the next full paragraph, excuse me, Your Honors.
"The closing arguments, too, Madam and gentlemen of the
jury, the counsel very often become over zealous.
arguments are not evidence for your consideration.

Closing
Closing

arguments, Madam and gentlemen, are merely statements by the
respective counsel as to how they hope you will view the
evidence which you have heard.”
And now, with particular reference to that paragraph
of instructions, beginning at page -- at the bottom of page
143 of the record Appendix, the judge continued.

12
"Mow in his closing, the District Attorney, I noted,
made a statement:

'I don't know what they want you to do by

way of a verdict.

They said they hope that you find him not

guilty.

I quite frankly think that they hope that you find

him guilty of something a little less than first-degree murder.
There is no evidence of that whatsoever, of course, you are
instructed to disregard that statement made by the District
Attorney.

Consider the case as though no such statement was

made."
The jury returned a verdict of murder in the first**
degree with a recommendation that the death penalty not be
imposed and verdicts of guilty on each of two counts of a
firearms charge.
The case

prior to appeal in the State courts, the

defendant- moved for a new trial in the State court, and the
case was then appealed to the

Supreme Judicial Court of the

Commonwealth on several assignments of error, including an
assignment of the denial of the defendant's motion for mistrial
In other words, the question of the propriety and
the alleged prejudice of the remarks made by the Assistant
District Attorney in his closing were brought to the full court
in Massachuse11s.
Q

The factual situation -» you've already pointed out

that the record shows that there were three pistols involved
here, two in the car and one had been removed from the car, and

13
there are three live passengers in the ear.
Was there anything in the record that identifies any
of those firearms with the specific defendants, the three
passengers, by way of gun registration, or that sort of thing?
MR. MILLS:

Your Honor, interestingly enough, the

only identification of a weapon, as to any particular defendant,
had to do with the position of the weapon in the car, and the
fact that one weapon was found in an area where the driver,
Gagliardi, had left after being questioned by the police.
And the record explicitly shows that all identification had been
previously removed from the firearms.
The case was seasonably appealed to the Supreme
Judicial Court on this question, and the court,by a solid
majority, and over a then very strenuous and explicit dissent
by our Chief Justice, which was concurred by another justice,
concluded that the -And I should note, excuse me, Your Honors, that our
court, the Supreme Judicial Court, unanimously noted the
impropriety of these remarks and soundly condemned them, finding,
however, that the argument, as a whole, did not require
a mistrial.
And I would like to suggest the criteria that the
court used in coming to its conclusion, and they are, of course,
contained in the Opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court which
is reprinted in full in the record Appendix.

14
Q

Bid the defense counsel, in his opening statement

to the jury, outline some evidence that he intended to prove
which he later did not support with evidence?
Ml. MILLS:

It is the position of the petitioner,

Your Honor, that several items in the opening and in the
closing made by defense counsel were never proven at trial.
Q

It is not unique -Ml. MILLS:

Q

Unique in what --

Well, it Is not unique in the experience of trying

a case that something you say in your opening statement, it
turns out that you can't prove.
MR, MILLS:

Unique in the sense that it is also

contained in your closing statement, Your Honor.

We suggest

that it perhaps is unique.
The Supreme Judicial Court explicitly examined the
whole argument and the whole trial proceeding, consistent with
an obligation under Massachusetts law, that in capital cases
the entire trial proceeding he examined.
The Supreme Judicial Court examined the judge’s
instructions, the lack of an immediate request for instructions
after some of the remarks wore made.
Q

Your opponent contends, as I understant it, that

court adjourned rather suddenly after the argument in the
afternoon and that he really didn’t have an opportunity to
make the request to the trial judge until the next morning.

15
Ml. MILLS:

I suggest there is nothing in the record

to indicate, Your Honor, that respondent's -- excuse me,
defendant’s counsel could not have continued his objection and
requested a bench conference at that juncture in the instruc­
tions, as he had at various portions in (die trial.
And, it should be noted that as additional components
of this trial objections numbering approximately 200 were made,
and there are 105 explicit exceptions noted on the record of
this trial.
So it was not a trial with inactivity on the part
of defendant's counsel.
Q

Is the lobby conference the Massachusetts equivalent

of a conference in chambers?
MR, MILLS:

There is nothing in the record, Your

Honor, but I can only suggest that there are lobby conferences
and bench conferences.

Lobby conferences would be in the

judge’s office, perhaps, for setting ground rules and
schedules of trial.

A bench conference is during the course

of live testimony in the courtroom.
The Supreme Judicial Court

our Supreme Judicial

Court also noted the weight of the evidence that had been
introduced against the accused and the improbability that a
jury in Massachusetts would draw the subtle inferences that
have been suggested by the defendant in the State court, in
the Federal District Court, that have been adopted by the

16
Circuit Court and that are suggested before this Court today.
I have noted the dissent, I am sure, of our Chief
Justice, to the majority opinion in Massachusetts.
A petition for habeas corpus was filed in the
District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
The petition, the return, the memorandum of United
States Magistrate Davis, and the transcript of the arguments
before the District judge on this petition are contained in
whole in the Appendix.

The petition was denied without

prejudice, the District judge concluding with respect to the
claim of prejudice based upon the Assistant District Attorney’s
remarks

the prosecutor's arguments were not so prejudicial as

to deprive the petitioner of his constitutional right to a
fair trial.
On appeal to the Circuit Court, the court concerned
itself, and concerned itself explicitly, solely with what the
petitioner claimed had been improper argument by the prosecuting
attorney, and determined that that particular remark, ,?I don't
know what they want you to do by way of a verdict,8t when read
in the light of the preceding instruction to the jury at the
time of the plea of co-defendant Gagliardi, in effect, amounted
to a representation by the Assistant District Attorney to the
jury that the defendant DeChrlstoforo had offered to plead
guilty, and that his plea had been rejected.
The parties stipulated before the Circuit Court, after

17
argument: in this case , that no offer to plea had been solicited,
Chat no offer to plea had been made s and that the defendant
insisted upon a trial at all times, and this is contained within.
the text of the Circuit Court’s opinion.
The Circuit Court vacated the order of the District
Court.
The primary point

that the petitioner suggests to

this Court this morning is that the Court of Appeals failed to
fairly consider the entire trial of Che respondent in concluding
that this remark, when read in the light of an earlier in­
struction, deprived him of a fair trial.
In this regard, we refer, again, to the 105
exceptions to the 12 or 14 witnesses, to the 7 days of trial,
to the view, to the bill of particulars, to the pre-trial
discovery, to all of the items that have been mentioned,
including the items that have been mentioned in this Court’s
December decision of Cuff v. Norton, which, as the Court
recalls, involved the question of a particular instruction
by a trial judge, and a standard of review.
We suggest that the standard of review which has
been applicable in lower Federal courts, including our First
Circuit, 5.ii the Pa triarc a case which is cited in the brief,
iaakes it incumbent upon the Circuit Court and the District
Court If it: is to examine an allegation of impropriety by a
State prosecutor, to examine all of the trial and not to look at

18

one particular remark in a vacuum.
vfe suggest that it may not have been an absolute
vacuum, but when compared to the standard of review employed

by our own Supreme Judicial Court when it examined this case,
we suggest that the examination tendered by the Circuit Court
was a virtual vacuum because, although it examined one additional
earlier instruction, we do not feel that that court adequately
examined the entire trial and that this is a basis of error.
Additionally ~~
Q

Was the full trial record before the Court of

Appeals?
MR, MILLS:
Q

Yes, Your Honor, the entire --

How can you assume they didn’t look at it?

HE. MILLS:

Well, explicitly, the court did not say

that it looked at it, Your Honor, and stated —
Q

“*' feel better?
MR. MILLS:

I suppose the petitioner would have felt

better if the court said it had examined all of the trial,
Your Honor, including all the components of the trial.

And

the court did explicitly say at the outset that we are con­
cerned solely with what petitioner contends were improper
closing argument.
The Circuit Court, the petitioner suggests, was also
in error on the basis of certain premises that it used in
reaching its conclusion that this remark was effectively a

19
representation by the Assistant District Attorney to the jury
that the defendant had offered to plead and his plea had been
rejected.
First, the Circuit Court, without any foundation in
the record, suggested that the co-defendant's plea was a
plea to second-degree murder.
The court further suggested that a jury must always
wonder,to some extent, why a defendant has not pleaded.
We suggest there is no basis for this in the record,
and that it is an unfair conclusion to draw with respect to
a jury, that a defendant -» excuse me, that a jury knows that
a defendant who has not sought to plead, either did not wish
to plead or he was deterred by the belief that the prosecutor
would be unreceptive, a sophistication and attributing to the
jury knowledge and belief that we do not feel is supported by
the record and is not fairly attributed to a Massachusetts
jury.
The Circuit Court also suggested that the jury does
not know whether or not a defendant's offer of plea has been
made and refused, but the jury knows that the prosecutor knows.
And, we suggest that this is violative, factually, of
the stipulation that was entered into by the parties before
that court.
We suggest that the First Circuit lias concluded that
plea bargaining takes place in all criminal trials in

Massachusetts, and we suggest there is nothing in the record
to support that and nothing in this particular case.

Indeed,

the parties stipulated that no offer of plea had been accepted
and — excuse me, no offer to plead had been made and no offer
of a plea had been solicited.
And, finally, with respect to the argument by the
respondent that what was substantially done by the Assistant
District Attorney was a misrepresentation of fact, that as a
matter of fact, he did not believe what he said when he
made an improper statement of opinion to the jury that he did
not believe what he said.
We suggest that if the Circuit Court were to engage
in speculation, it would have been more reasonable to speculate
that, as a matter of Massachusetts law, based upon the elements
of manslaughter as contained in Massachusetts cases, the
improper suggestion of opinion by the Assistant District
Attorney was referring to manslaughter, and, in fact, was an
opinion.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Mills.

Mr. Smith.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL I. SMITH, ESQ.,
FOR THE RESPONDENT
MR, SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This is a case involving an affirmative falsity of a

prosecutor’s statements, and not a case of a procedural error,
arising from a technically improper argument, rectified by
curative ins tractions.
As the Court of Appeals said, at Appendix 241,
"We have before us a case where the prosecutor, despite the
fact that it was totally untrue, strongly indicated to the
jury that the defendant had offered to plead guilty."
Q

Mr. Smith, why was the Court of Appeals able to

reach that conclusion as emphatically as it did on the basis
of the statement, "'They hope that you find him not guilty.
X quite frankly think that they hope that you find him guilty
of something a little less than first-degree murder.1'
There is no reference in the prosecutor’s comment
to anything about a plea.
MR. SMITH;

Well, I think, Mr. Justice, that the

rationale of the court and my argument is that when a prosecutor
made that statement he well knew, at the time, that the
respondent had not sought to plead guilty to any offense.

He

also well knew that if the respondent was seeking something a
little less than first-degree murder, he could have had it for
the asking, because there had been two other defendants, Oreto
and Gagliardi, both of whoa had pleaded guilty to second-degree
murder on the recommendation of the same prosecutor, and had
been given life sentences.
Q

But the words used weren’t that he sought them.

They

22
were, "You find him guilty of something a little less than firstdegree raurder.5!’
Why isn’t the fair inference from that that what you,
as his attorney, want, you said you want a verdict of acquittal,
but really you would be damn happy to get a verdict of seconddegree murder?
MR. SMITH:
Q

I would not.

Oh, I see.

I am not suggesting you would have, but why isn't that

the fair inference from the prosecutor’s statement?
MR. SMITH:

Because he couldn’t have had that

opinion, Your Honor.
Knowing that Oreto and GagHard! -- and I am sure
Mr. Mills didn’t intend to mislead the Court — the Commonwealth
in its closing argument conceded that Oreto was the one who
fired one shot into the head of Lanei, the deceased, and that
Gagliardi had fired three shots into his side, and conceded that
BeCh.ristoforo had never fired any shots.
So that, you had a situation where the two triggermen,
Gagliardi and Oreto, were allowed to plead guilty to seconddegree murder and were given life sentences -Q

Do we know that from the record, that both of them

pleaded guilty to second-degree murder?
MR,. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

And, the District Attorney knew that, and, as they
say in their petition of certiorari #hd in their brief, and

23

I think in petition for cert at page 23 and in their brief at
page 24 that it would be silly to argue fco say that they
wouldn’t have given DeChristoforo a plea to second degree had
he asked for it.

So that at the time the District Attorney made

that argument, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, he knew that that was a
false argument.

He knew that we weren't looking for something

a little bit less because we could have got a little bit less,
just as the other two did.
Q

Do 1 understand that the Court of Appeals said that

the jury could interpret that there had been plea bargaining?
MR. SMITH:

I didn't read anything in the opinion of

the court that says anything about plea bargaining.
Q

Offered to plead guilty?
MR. SMITH:

Q

Oh, there was a stipulation -«*

No, no, I am talking about in the trial.

Did the jury

know anything about plea bargaining?
MR. SMITH:
Q

Not that I know of,

It didn't know anything about pleading guilty?
Ml. SMITH:

They knew that Gagliardi had pleaded

guilty.
Q

Well, did they know what if meant, or anything?
MR, SMITH:

Q

Mo.

So, how can you draw any conclusion from what the

prosecutor said, other than that this man expects to get a
lessor crime conviction right here on the basis of what he's

24
put in.
MR.. SMITH:
Q

That ha is seeking something less.

Yes.
MR. SMITH:

Well, I think the conclusion is obvious

that he was saying to the jury that I, as a prosecutor who
went along with a plea of guilty for Gagliardi, after the
evidence had been la before that jury that Gagliardi had shot
the deceased three times in the side, that I, as a prosecutor,
having agreed and recommended to the court, in effect, that the
court accept a plea of guilty to second-degree murder -Q

MR. SMITH:
Q

Right.

I am

That’s so.

just limiting this to what he said, and I

could interpret it, as a juror, I think, that this man would
like to get a lesser conviction than first-degree murder.
would rather not get the death penalty.
MR. SMITH:
Q

Well, what else can you get out of that language?
MR, SMITH:

Q

This may be so, Mr. Justice.

I beg your pardon?

What else can you get out of the prosecutor’s

language?
1-21. SMITH:

I think that what you get out of that

that the respondent was admitting his

If he were seeking something a little less than first-

degree murder, he obviously was admitting that he was guilty,
Q

In Massachusetts, is it permissible for the defense

counsel to argue that his man is innocent, but at the same
time if you find him guilty give him guilty of manslaughter?
Is that ever done?
Ml. SMITH:
Q

Well, that's what I am talking about.
MR. SMITH:

here.

Yes.

But, Mr. Justice, that wasn't the case

By way of the very stipulation, the respondent here -Q

The sipulation came in after this.
MR. SMITH:

Q

Yes, but —

The jury hadn't seen the stipulation until yet,

right?
MR. SMITH:
Q

That's correct, Mr. Justice.

And you are talking about the effect on the jury.

So what good is the stipulation if the jury never saw it?
MR. SMITH:

Well, I am only saying that the stipulation

establishes that DeChristoforo had never sought to plead guilty
to any offense, and that the statement by the prosecutor
knowing that he had never sought to plead guilty to any offense,
and knowing also that if DeChristoforo had sought to plead
guilty he could have had it for the asking.
The statement by the prosecutor, I quite frankly think

26
that they hope you find him guilty of something a little
than first-degree murder, is a false statement.
Q

How, let me pursue that with you a little.

said that twice now.

False statement,

You've

it is expressed as an

You say there is no basis

whatever for an opinion.
'

Laying aside the propriety of the remark, now just
going to your claim that the prosecutor knew this was false.
you say there is no basis in this record for an opinion that
this man might be simply hoping for a lesser included offense?
MR. SMITH:

That's correct and I would like to

explain why, Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

Let me pursue it a moment.
There’s three pistols in the car and three men and

a dead man.
Don't you think a. jury, or juror, could reasonably
infer from that that each of these men had had a gun, and that
each of them was prepared to do whatever was necessary to
dispose of this fellow?
MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes, that may be so, Mr. Chief Justice.

It would be a reasonable inference that a juror could

draw from the physical evidence in this case.
MR. SMITH:

I think that Mr. Mills unwittingly

mislead Your Honor in answering a question put to him by you.
The Commonwealth conceded that the gun that was found

27
on 'die seat where Ore to had been seated, had been fired by Ore to
into the back of the head of the deceased, that the gun that
was later found elsewhere was the gun that had been used by
Gagliardi to fire the three shots.

The third gun that was

found in there was a Derringer, fully loaded, had not been
used.

During the course of the trial there was evidence that

Oreto had worn black gloves, black silk gloves, kidskin gloves.
The evidence appeared to be, and certainly there was no evidence
to the contrary, that DeChristoforo had no gloves.

There were

no fingerprints on the Derringer which was found and which was
fully loaded in the back of the car.
How, as to whether or not the prosecutor could have
had an honest opinion, in saying well, I don't know what they
want, 1 think that what they want is something a little less
than first-degree murder, I'd submit that,one, a matter is
within the personal knowledge of the speaker, that qualifying
the phrase by the words, "I think,38 doesn't convert a falsehood
into a possible truth or a factual statement into an opinion.
Now, he knew the prosecutor was speaking of a factual
proposition.

He knew that no offer, no attempt had been made to

plead to anything in the case.
Q

But what he said was that they hope that you find

him guilty of something.
MR. SMITH:
knowledge.

He didn't say anything about a plea.

Mr. Justice, he is testifying from his

That jury sitting there has a right to believe that

28
when a district attorney says to them, ”1 quite frankly believe"
something, that he has a source of information unknown to them,
not in a record, not put on in the trial of the case, that,
as a District Attorney, he knows something, and when he says,
"I quite frankly believe," and knows that he.can't believe that,
but he says this to a jury, I think that the jury has a right
to draw the conclusion that DeChristoforo made some overture
to plead guilty to something.
Q

Mr. Smith, what offenses \ ere the jury given a choice

of in the instructions?
ML SMITH:

Under the Massachusetts law, the court

is required to instruct on first“degree, second-degree and
manslaughter.
Q

So, what he is saying is that you, the counsel for

the defendants in this case, really would like to get
manslaughter.
MR. SMITH:

I think he went further than that.

He

said he quite frankly believed that DeChristoforo wanted.
Q

Well, what's wrong with that?
MR, SMITH:

Well, because it isn't the fact, and he

knew it wasn't the fact, and stating that to the jury,obviously,
is a statement that DeChristoforo has indicated he is guilty
of something.
Q

So?
ML SMITH:

Mow, this was a case of a joint venture

29
charge.

Although during the whole course of the trial I made

every effort to get the Commonwealth to concede that Gagliardi
had fired the three shots, that Oreto had fired the one shot,
and that DeChristoforo had never fired any shots, —
Q

He still could have been guilty of first-degree

murder, or is it not so in Massachusetts?
MR* SMITH:

Yes.

if he had been engaged in a joint

venture here, and I argued that to the court in the lobby or
in chambers, and the District Attorney said that he would not
agree to that.
As a consequence, we had to fry this case on the
theory that the Commonwealth was going to try to show that
DeChristoforo had fired some shots here, and it wasn’t until
after my closing argument, when the prosecutor made his
closing argument, that for the first time he conceded, and he
said to the jury the theory of the Commonwealth’s case is that
Gagliardi shot him three times in the side and that Oreto shot
him once through the head.
Q

The defense attorney opens the closing argument?

«

MR* SMITH:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

And then the prosecutor responds.

Then do you have

a right to rebuttal?
MR. SMITH:

Ho, Your Honor, we have no right to rebut,

and our position is that when the prosecutor made this statement
he was, in effect, testifying.

We had no right to cross-examine

30

hira.

We had no right to rebut it, and that was left with the

jury,

'file impression was clearly left that DeChristoforo was

seeking something less than first-degree murder and, in effect,
a representation to the jury that he, the prosecutor, had
reason to believe that, because he quite frankly thought that
to be so and, as a consequence DeChristoforo was, in effect,
confessing to the crime, but was seeking to get maybe a better
deal.
Mow, I submit that -- I submit that this false
statement, and it is false; it wasn't simply an opinion.

It

was an unequivocable statement that he frankly believed a
matter that he couldn't possibly frankly believe, because he
knew right along that there was ***• that we were going to trial
all the way through on this thing, and when he made that:
argument, which the petitioner concedes is an improper argument
I say it reaches constitutional dimensions and that we were
deprived of due process as a result.
Q

Mr. Smith, let me ask you what is obviously a

hypothetical question to probe at the impact of this kind of
statement on the jury.
Suppose instead of putting it the way he did, he
had said, after his first sentence, "I don't know what they
want you to do by way of a verdict," but then went on, "But I
suggest to you when you get in the jury room you ask yourselves
whether what they really want is that you find him guilty of

something a little less than first-degree murder.”
Would you have thought that was all right?
MR. SMITH:

I don’t think it would have reached the

dimensions that his argument made, but I don’t approve of that
type of an argument, but X don't think X could quarrel with
it to the extent that I am quarreling with this argument.
Q

You are suggesting that it would be an impropriety

to pose the kind of questions the jurors should consider?
MR. SMITH:
Mr. Chief Justice.

No.

I think that is perfectly proper,

X do think -- X think that had he said

that the evidence, or the argument by defense counsel is such
as to lead you to believe that this is only a case of man­
slaughter, which, of course, it couldn't be in this instance,
because it was a joint venture, and this was a first-degree
murder case.

There isn't any question about it.

It was a joint venture and if he was guilty he
was guilty at least to the same degree as the others who
actually pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.

And X don't

see how there could have been a manslaughter unless the jury
got very ->-•
Q

Isn't it quite common for the jury to find the

triggenaan, as he would be called, guilty of a higher degree
of homocide than the driver of the car, for example?

Isn't

it a common -thing every day in every State in the Union?
Ml. SMITH:

Yes.

32
Q

So, you had a reasonable case for a lesser offense

than first:--degree murder here.
MR. SMITH: Well, frankly, I wasn't thinking in those
terms of manslaughter, or anything else, certainly by the very
fact that we didn't make any attempt to negotiate a plea,...whereas
£he: prosecutor points out „in his brief, he says it would make
not a whit of sense to refuse to give DeChristoforo at least
the same type of consideration as they gave to the triggermen,
to GagHard! and the other fellow.
To get back to your first -- now that I think more
of it, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that that is so.

I think

that perhaps in the trial of a case an advocate does have in
mind the possibility that if the jury is going to come in with
a guilty, that it be the least possible degree, and I think
that J±e statement, as you put it,if he had made that statement
to the jury, I don't think there would be any quarrel.
Q

You mean as to the question they should ask themselves.
MR. SMITH:

Right.

I don’t think there would be

any quarrel, but I think when he said, ”1 quite frankly believe
this.

"I quite frankly think ’

that he is seeking something

other than, first degree murder,” I think that a jury sitting
there has every reason to believe that tie knows of something
that they don’t know about, and that that is testimony, and
that we were deprived, of course, of a right of confrontation.
And, I might point this up.

Although he says, in

his brief, the petitioners say In their brief, that it doesn't
make a whit of sense that they wouldn't have offered him,
DeChristoforo, something less than first-degree murder, but
at the time of trial it made a good deal of sense to the
prosecutor, because he argued to the jury, "And he (pointing
to DeChristoforo) more than anybody else, T. think, is more
reprehensible than the other two combined, because he was the
mah who supposedly was the friend of Lanai, the victim.
So, during the trial, he had it appear that
DeChristoforo was the real bad man in the situation, that the
two triggermen weren't the bad fellows, and so the posture at
trial was that he wouldn't give DeChristoforo a plea of second
degree

-- except a plea of second-degree.
In short -- and then he compounded it.

After the

objection was made to the argument, by saying to the jury
that, "I believe that there is no doubt in this case, none
whatsoever."
Now, all I'm arguing to this Court is that the
statement made by the prosecutor goes beyond a technical error
in arguing.

It was a false statement.

It is tantamount to

the introduction of false evidence and that

and that this

Court should regard it In the same fashion that it has
regarded the Alcorta case, Napue, Miller v. Fate, Gigllo.
A false statement made by the prosecutor which had, at least «
which at least created an impression in the minds of the jury

34
that the defendant here had offered to plead guilty and had
not.
I just close by saying that there was some reference
to provocation.
argument.

I would submit that that is a specious

There was no provocation.

We’ve set forth in our

brief the opening and the fact is that in the opening, as
Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointed out, a lot of us make openings
which we can’t necessarily establish, but virtually every
matter stated in the opening was either introduced in evidence
or there was a proffer of proof.

For example, I offered to

prove that BeChristoforo, when he fled, fled to his grandmother's
house, fled because he was in fear of his life.
offer of proof on that.

.And we made an

The fact that the court didn’t permit

us to introduce that evidence certainly should not be used as
an argument for provocation.
Q

Mow were you going to prove that, Mr.Smith?

By what

kind of evidence?
MR. SMITH:

Well, the grandmother was prepared to

testify that he came running up to the house, and the offer
of proof was, ’’Hanna, they’ve just killed"-- whatever Lansi's
first name was — "They've just killed Joey, and I am afraid
they are. going to kill me and I’ve got to hide."
Q

Bid he speak to that effect in his own sworn statement?
MR. SMITH: He did not use that language, as I. recall,

Mr. Justice.

35
Q

Bid he not: indicate he was afraid of his life?
MR. SMITH:

Q

That's correct.

So it carae in to the jury in any event,, through his

mouth.
IU. SMITH:

That's right, but not as evidence.

The statement by a person accused of first-degree
murder is an unsworn statement.
Q

Yes.
MR. SMITH:

Q

And is not regarded as evidence.

Bid the prosecutor argue that if DeChristoforo really

had been innocent, if his claim was bona fide, in this respect,
that he was merely a passenger, that he would have welcomed
the presence of the officers and immediately told the officers
the whole story of what had happened.
MR. SMITH:

He did argue that, and I might point out

that -- the evidence against DeChristoforo was that he was in
the automobile at the time they found a man dead, that he made
false statements to Officer Carr concerning his own identity,
concerning the identity of the roan in the front seat of the
automobile, the deceased, and that he then fled.
The facts were that Officer Carr,in a prior hearing,
on a probable cause against Oreto, under oath, stated that it
was Oreto who had given a false name of the man in there, that
it was Oreto who had made the false statements which at this
trial he was attributing to DeChristoforo.

36
How, this is not a case where the evidence was
overwhelming5 by any means.
Q

Was there any evidence of motive at all?
Ml. SMITH:

Hone at all.

In fact, the evidence was

that DeChristoforo and Lanai were close personal friends and
that was brought out by the Commonwealth itself.
As I say, I am sure that Mr. Mills didn’t intend to
mislead the Court with respect to the guns.

There was nothing

to tie DeChristoforo up to the Derringer that was in the back
seat.

There was no evidence that he had ever owned a gun.

In fact, there was uncontradicted evidence from a police officer
in the district, from friends, that this young man had an
excellent reputation, not only for honesty, but for non»
violence in the State House where he had worked as a page for
seven or eight years just prior to getting this other job, and
in the community where he lived.
The only evidence that there was involving a. gun
was the argument ma.de by the prosecutor when he said -*• and
there was no foundation for this »» "You know these people.
These are the kind of people who carry guns that can never be
identified and never be traced."
I don’t believe that the argument, picking out an
argument that was improper, and there were many improper
arguments, in and of themselves,would warrant this Court to
sustain the Court of Appeals, but I do believe that there was a

false arguffiGE.it made here, he knew it was false, and it was
done for the purpose of misleading that jury and that the
jury was mislead.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:54 o’clock, a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
