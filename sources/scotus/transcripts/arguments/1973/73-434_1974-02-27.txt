PRO C E 13 D I II G S
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Eos. 73-434r 35, 36, Milliken against Bradley, Allen
Park Schools against Bradley, and Grosse Pointe against
Bradley.
Mr. Attorney General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK J* KELLEY, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE PETITIONERS
MR, KELLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.
At the commencement of trial in this matter, the
plaintiffs were a group of parents and children residing in
Detroit and a joint plaintiff, the Detroit branch of the
NAACP.
The defendants were the Detroit Board of Education,
and Superintendent of Schools.

And my clients in this case

are certain named State officials, the Governor, the Attorney
General, the State Board of Education, the State Superintendent
of Public Instruction.
,

Later on, but prior to the trial, Intervenors

Magdowski, another group of parents, and the Detroit Federation
of Teachers were allowed to intervene as Party Defendants.
These were all of the parties throughout this action,

5
during the trial stage and the appellate proceedings,
except towards the end of the remedy, the court — the
remedy hearings, the court on its own motion added the
State Treasurer for the State of Michigan, whom I also
represent.
Now, although the lower court's decision, and the
Court of Appeals have made frequent and numerous references
to the State of Michigan, the State of Michigan is not a
party to this suit and has not consented to be a party»
Frequent references are made to the Legislature of Michigan,
the Legislature of Michigan is not a party, nor any member
thereof.
In their original complaint, the plaintiffs made
three claims s
First, that the assignment of pupils within the

Detroit Public School System only was based upon

race.

Second, that the assignment of personnel within the
Detroit Public Schools only to some extent was based upon
race; and
Third, tliat Section 12 of the Public Acts of the
Michigan Legislature in 1970, Act 48, was unconstitutional
because it interfered with implementation of what was known
as the Detroit Board's April 7th plan.
This plan altered attendance areas for 12 of 21 of
Detroit's high schools; involved at the most three or four

6

thousand students, and — making up one and a half percent of
the Detroit student body.
How, initially, the plaintiffs sought a temporary
injunction, asking the District Court to implement the
April 7th plan.

This was denied by the District Court and

affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
However, the Court of Appeals, one month after the
commencement of the school year that year, declared Section 12
unconstitutional.

On remand, the District Court actually

came up with a plan of school attendance variance, called
the MacDonald Magnet plan, involving many more students, some
eight thousand students; and the District Court never made any
attempt to implement the April 7th plan itself.
Toward the end of the trial, the District Court,
in our judgment, became preoccupied with the majority black
character of the Detroit School District.
Repeatedly, questions were asked by the Court, and
I auote:

"IIow do you integrate a school district where

the student population is, let's make a guess, 05 to 95
percent black?

Close quote.

Another reference, quotes
white students to go around,"

"There aren't enough

Close quote.

At the time, and the record of the trial discloses,
that the predominance, the black majority of students in the
City of Detroit was 63,8 percent.

7

The District Court ruled, at the conclusion of a
trial that went over forty days , that — on the merits —
that

de jura segregation existed among the school buildings

within the City of Detroit, not between Detroit and any
other school district.
The Court also found that the principal cause
undeniably had been

population movements and housing

patterns, quoting the court again.
Wo faculty segregation was found, no acts of de jure
segregation with regard to the assignment of faculty was
found.
The court then ordered intradistrict plans and
multidistrict plans to be submitted.
We appealed at that point, feeling that there was
absolutely ho basis on the trial record for the court to
entertain a raultidistrict remedy.

We did not prevail.

After the hearings on the intradistrict plans
commenced, the court allowed, for the first time,
school districts to intervene.

43 suburban

However, their intervention

was limited.
After hearings on a multidistrict plan commenced,
the court issued its order rejecting any intradistrict plan,
without stating in its order whether or not a unitary system
could be found in the City of Detroit, meaning a system
whereby no child in that district would be excluded from a

8

school because of race.
On June the 14th, 1972, the trial court ordered a
desegregation plan, including 53 school districts involving
7 80,000 students and requiring at least 310 ,000 of them to be
bused daily, on the school days, so that each school, each
grade and each classroom would reflect the racial makeup of
the entire 5 3 school district areas.
The court also ordered a ten percent black faculty
in each school, although in the trial court no evidence was
found of any segregatory acts with regard to assignment of
school personnel in Detroit at all, the principal case.
QUESTION:

Hr, Attorney General, did you say that

the judge ordered busing?
MR. KELLEY:

He ordered -— he ordered a desegregation

plan.
QUESTION:
MR. KELLEY:

Did he order busing?
Later on, yes, on July the 11th, he

ordered the State of Michigan to buy 295 buses.
QUESTION:
MR» KELLEY:

Where is that?
That is covered in our Appendix for

Petition for Writ of Certiorari, 106, on 107 — page 106 and
10 7.
QUESTION:
MR. KELLEY:

106 and 107.
He ordered my clients, the forenamed

defendants, to bear the cost of 295 school buses.

9

How, the Court of Appeals in substance affirmed
the District Court, although the case was remanded for
joinder of all the school districts affected by the remedy.
You recall that 43 were joined, but the remedy recommendation
was 53.

They were not before the Court.
How, more than three years after the complaint was

filed, and two years after the completion of the court's
decision, first in their amended complaint and now to this
Court, the plaintiffs represent that this case is one of
intentional confinement of black children to an expanding
core

of State-imposed black schools within a three-county

area.
They made no such complaint in their — they made
no such allegation in their original complaint; they made no
such claims during the entire course of the trial; they made
no such claim in the Court of Appeals.
On September the 4th, 1973, the plaintiffs filed
an amended bill of complaint, and in that amended bill of
complaint they did not allege that the school boundaries
had been created, altered or manipulated in any of the
areas for the purpose of segregation, nor did they allege,
with the exclusion of Detroit, that any other school district
had committed any acts of rte jure segregation.
QUESTIOH:
Appendix?

Is that amended complaint in the

10

If not, go ahead,
MR. KELLEY:

Thank you, Justice Rehnquist,

It was the position of the plaintiffs that what —
of the defendants and appellants, that what this case is
about, as distinguished from what the plaintiffs now say
this case is about, is of critical importance.

We feel that

this is a classic case of a remedy in search of a violation.
This case was pleaded and tried and decided by the
District Court on the theory of a single school district
violation.

The District Court made it abundantly clear, and

I quote from the trial record, when it said: "This lawsuit is
limited to the City of Detroit and school system; so that we
are only concerned with the city itself, and we are not
talking about the metropolitan area," Close quote.
However, the District Court, at the remedy stage,
candidly revealed what we feel is a self-assumed role to
pursue a social goal.

Quoting the court:

"The task that

we are called upon to perform is a social one, which the
society has been unable to accomplish; to attain a social
goal through the education system by using the lav/ as a
lever,"

Close quote.
QUESTION:

What's your Appendix reference on that?

MRo KELLEY:

That, Your Honor, is in our Joint

Appendix for the Petition for — our Appendix for the Petition
for Writ of Certiorari, page 40 and 41.

11
QUESTION:
with the Appendix,

Ilr. Attorney General, I have trouble
Each volume goes just a hundred and some

pages; and I've been unable to find this,
MR, KELLEYs

Well, that's this — the Appendix

I refer to is our — we have filed a separate Appendix,
Your Honor, as to our Petition for Writ of Certiorari.
QUESTION:
MR. KELLEY:
QUESTION:

Right.
Separate from the five-volume Appendix.
Right.

MR. KELLEY:

Right,

The District Court then acknowledged

in its ruling on the metropolitan desegregation area, and
quoting the court again:

"That the court has taken no proof

with respect to the establishment of boundaries of the 86
school districts in the counties of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb,
nor on the issue of whether, with the exclusion of the City
of Detroit, such school districts have committed acts of
de jure segregation,"

Close quote.

Now, all of this is important, we submit, when we
consider the nature of the violation found by the District
Court, and the proofs relied on to support that violation,
we respectfully submit that the underpinnings are fragile
and slender reeds upon which to build an edifice of
achieving a social goal or a multidistrict remedy, regardless
of how worthy that goal might be from the standpoint of a
social goal

12

I wish to examine the rulings against the clients
that I represent here, because the only clients, as far as
the State of Michigan are concerned, that are before this
Court, are the Governor, the Attorney General, the State
Superintendent of Public Instruction, the State Treasurer,
and the State Board of Education.
Much has been made, at the lower court stage, about
the transportation of some school students from a Carver
School District outside of Detroit, back in the 1950's.
As a matter of fact, the Court of Appeals stated that this
busing of students from the Carver School District into
Detroit v/as done — could not have taken place, I should say,
without the tacit approval, express or implied, of the State
Board of Education.
Well, I submit that there is no obligation on the
State Board of Education to be notified of any transportation
of that type, there was not that responsibility, nor is there
anything in the record to support the conclusion that it
could not have been taken without the tacit or implied
approval of the State Board of Education,
The Court of Appeals also upheld the conclusion
that for years black children in the Carver School District
were assigned to black schools in Detroit because no
white suburban district would take the children.
We say that that is exceptional error, there's

13

nothing in the record of this case to base that conclusion.
Actually, members of the Court, the Carver School
District was an independent school district in the 1950's that
did not have a high school.

Detroit readied out, took these

children in, and gave them an education, a high school
education that they wouldn't have otherwise had.
Under Michigan — established Michigan law, there
is no obligation for any school district in Michigan to
accept pupils or take pupils from any other school district.
But Detroit did take these pupils, to give them some
education.

Then, some thirteen years ago, the Oak Park

School District, through the initiative of local officials,
annexed the Carver School District, so that now the Carver
students are a part of the Oak Park School District, which
is a suburban school district, predominantly white, and which
has the richest per pupil contribution of any State — or
any district in the State.
This, I believe, gives lie to the plaintiffs'
theory that there is some containment going on, because if
that were true these students would not have been annexed to
the Oak Park School District, but would have been annexed and
confined to the City of Detroit,
In other words, I believe that the Carver example,
rather than showing a willful purpose to segregate, shows a
willful act of trying to integrate.

14
The merger of the entire Carver School District,
in 1960 I believe, under the theory expressed in Keyes, shows
that something going back in the 1950's is so attenuated
now, in any event, not to establish — so that it cannot
establish a precedent for an act of de jure segregation in
the 1970's.
QUESTION:

VJas Carver contiguous to Detroit, to

the the school district?
MR. KELLEY:

It was contiguous, I believe, to

Detroit, it was also contiguous to Oak Park, who initiated
the local —
QUESTION:

To Oak Park, And Carver itself did not

have a high school.
MR. KELLEY:

Carver did not have a high school?

never had one.
QUESTION:

Is there no obligation on a school

district in Michigan, as a matter of State law, to have a
high school?
MR. KELLEY:

No, there is not. As a matter of fact,

there's a case directly in point, which occurred in out-State
Michigan, at 349 Michigan 1, called Jones vs. Grand Ledge,
which indicates that that is not the case.

And incidentally

that was a case in out-State Michigan, where there was no
racial factor involved.
QUESTION:

What is the obligation of a; school

15
district v/ith respect to having schools?

Does it have to

have any schools?
And if not, what's the point of having a school
district?
MR. KELLEY:

The — no, I think there's an

obligation of a school district to have schools, and they
did have schools in Carver, but they were not — they did
not have a tax base, and could not tax themselves to the point
to build a high school.

I believe there was inference made.

They just were never able to build a high school in this —
which, from a tax base standpoint, as I understand it, Mr»
Justice Stewart, was a very poor area, taxwise.
QUESTION: Mas Carver, back in the Fifties, a
predominantly Negro area?
MR. KfiLLEY:

To the best of my knowledge it was

always predominantly Negro, from the time it received its —
not only the school district but from the time it became a
chartered township.
QUESTION:
MR. KELLEY:

Unh-hunh.
Another pivot of the plaintiffs'

brief that attempts to bring State involvement into this
matter, as a predicate for a multidistrict remedy, is the
reference to Section 12 of 1970 Acts of the Legislature, the
act being Act 40.
This piece of legislation actually provided for more

16
local control to the parents within the Detroit School
System, 13 sections which intensified and gave the parents
more local control.
Following the situation in New York that had
occurred prior to that time, where the parents wanted more
local control.
All that Section 12 did, in our judgment, was to
delay an attendance plan that had been put out until the new
board took over on January the 1st? but, in point of fact,
~ and it also provided that if there needs to be any school
attendance change of practical necessity, they could continue
to do it.
But that section was only in effect for a month,
because the Court of Appeals declared it unconstitutional.
Any effect it has was de minimis, and any effect it had
would be applied solely to the single Detroit School District,
because the statute applied only to the single Detroit School
District, and had no bearing on any other school district in
Michigan,
There's no evidence that the defendants who I
represent, the State defendants, had anything to do with the
passage of the statute»

Nor does it show that there was any

segregatory effect caused in any other school district of
Michigan, and the record is barren of that.
A point is also made by the plaintiffs that the

17
Sixth Circuit especially reached the same conclusion that
construction in Detroit in the mid and late 1960's is a basis
for involving ray State defendants in a predicate for a multi­
district remedy 4
What this Court recognized in Rodriguez and in other
cases, that the school construction is primarily a function
of the local school districts

site acquisition, the purchase,

the right of eminent domain is given to our school districts
in Michigan.

We, the State Board, at the State level, at the

Capitol, has very little to do with the acquisition and
construction of schools.

As a matter of fact, the only

contact by law in Michigan is that the State Superintendent
of Public Instruction approves them as to fire and safety
regulations, and that prior to 1962 he approved the site as
to its adequacy after the fact.
QUESTION:

But —

Mr. Attorney General, how are the funds

raised for capital improvements in the school districts?
MR* KELLEY:

I would say that overwhelmingly the

majority of the funds are raised locally by taxation and
bonding,
QUESTION:
MR, KELLEY;

By bonding?

Who issues those bonds?

The district issues the bonds, Your

Honor.
QUESTION: The district is the maker of the bonds.
MR. KELLEY:

That's correct.

18

QUESTION: They're not general obligations of the
State?
MR* KELLEY:
QUESTION:

Ho.
And it requires a vote of the people in

the district, to authorize a bond issue?
MR. KELLEY:

In most cases, Your Honor.

As a matter of fact, one of the allegations in this
case was that Detroit was — was contributing less per pupil
than the other districts in the tri-county area, and the
court concluded that that was a fact.
The actual fact is that Detroit, during this period,
has been —- has had more — has had higher per pupil contri­
butions per student than most of the other districts in the
area.
In the area of school financing, I believe that
there's an example here of straining in order to involve my
clients, named, as a prediccite for a multidistrict ruling.
And also there's a point made about the transporta­
tion — an Act,the statute passed with regard to transporta­
tion based on an urban-rural classification.
The statute passed in 1947 provided that all home
rule cities, ail home rule municipalities in the State, and
certain villages, were to be excluded from appropriations for
certain transportation funds.

It was certainly not racially

motivated, it was certainly an equal classification that

19

applied to all the cities, including the city that I was
City Attorney in at the time, Alpena, Michigan, which had no
black population whatsoever.

It applied to hundreds of cities

like that.
And the plaintiffs have tried to show that this
statute was an example of the violation of equal protection
of their clients' rights.

It was not.

As a matter of fact, since 1972, the Legislature
has been making specific appropriations to villages and cities,
separate and apart from the previous statute.
QUESTION:

But the previous statute applied to

home rule cities?
MR. KELLEY:

All home rule cities —

QUESTION:

And Detroit is a home rule city.

MR, KELLEY:
QUESTION:

Was one of many — one of hundreds.
One of hundreds in the State —

MR. KELLEY:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
— and these satellite communities of

Detroit are not home rule cities?
MR. KELLEY:

Some of them were and some of them

did not receive funds.
QUESTION:

Some were and some were not.

Yes.

MR, KELLEY:

Some of them were and some did not

receive funds, Your Honor, that were incorporated,in that
manner.

20
Now, it is our position that the findings against
my clients — and I can only speak for my clients; as you
know, the City of Detroit School District has not seen fit
to appeal or participate in this appeal.

But they have their

attorneys, their own counsel, and they make their own
decisions in this area.
I am here representing only the Governor, the
Attorney General, the State Board of Education, the State
Treasurer, and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction.
And I submit to this Court that the record in this
case is devoid of any action by any of my clients that could
be said to be a purposeful act, as a public official, with
an intent to segregate anybody at any time.
And I think also that if we are to allow the courts
to engage in social goals, rather than to confine themselves
to the scope of the remedy that the violation requires, and
in order to predicate a remedy for those goals we allow them
to trample on the rights of clients such as mine here today,
who, in the record, are devoid of any acts, then really the
ends of justice are not served,
QUESTION;

You'd be satisfied if we just left you

out of the case?
MR„ KELLEY;

Ho, I don't think that would be proper.

I think that —- I think that what's more important here, Your
Honor, is that the lower courts have failed to read Swann and

21
Keyes and the other more recent rulings of this Court, as I
understand them, this is a single district case, a single
district allegation, —
QUESTION;

You've said that you don't represent

the city.
MR. KELLEY;
QUESTION;

That's correct, Your Honor.
And you don't represent the School Board.

MR. KELLEY;
QUESTION;

That's correct.
And that nobody here represents them.

MR. KELLEY;

That's correct, Your Honor.

But, by the same token, I do feel, Your Honor,
that we, rrry clients are being used as the predicate for a
multidistrict remedy, when it is not warranted by the facts.
And if we are not, if we are dismissed from the
case, then this case should not be remanded, but should be
ended, because the plaintiffs have had their day in court on
a single district allegation; every tiling they alleged that
was tried, and there is testimony that we can have a unitary
solution within the city of Detroit, because this Court
has never said that there should be, that a predominantly
black school district can't meet the test of Brown and the
other cases.
And I think that that is the issue in this case,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
til ink, has now expired.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M, SAXTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS, ALLEN PARK, ET AL»
MR. SAXTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
My name is William Saxton, and I appear here on
behalf of 44 school districts, who are listed as petitioners
in this case.
Each of these petitioner school districts is a
body corporate under Michigan law and possessed, under Michigan
law, with the right to sue, to be sued, in its own name, the
right to possess property, and to hold both real and personal
property for educational purposes.
These school districts are located in varying
degrees of geographical proximity to Detroit, some ranging
up to 30 to 35 miles away.
In most instances these school districts are
predominantly white, in both their population, makeup as a
whole, and in their racial population.
QUESTION:

This is —

Mr. Saxton, you said you were appearing

for 44?
MR. SAXTON:
QUESTION:
MR. SAXTON:

Yes, Your Honor.
But there are 53 involved, are there?
There are 53 involved in the lawsuit,

23
Mr. Justice Brennan, -QUESTION:
MR. SAXTON:

Are the other nine —
—■ some of whom have never been before

the court in any capacity.
QUESTION: Well, are the other nine represented here
today?
MR. SAXTON:

They are not represented here today,

Your Honor.
I night also — it is a little confusing.

Some

of the school districts whom I represent, and for whom I
speak in this argument, were not included in the metropolitan
remedy decreed by the lower court.

Nevertheless, they are

still intervenors in the case, and petitioners in this
lawsuit.
So it isn't really fair to say that there are only
nine left.

There are really eighteen school districts, Your

Honor, Mr. Justice Brennan, that have never been before the
court, that were included in the plan.
QUESTION;

Because you represent at least nine who

were not included in the plan, is that correct?
MRo SAXTON:

No, Mr. Justice Stewart, I represent

thirty-some who were included in the plan, —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR, SAXTON:

—■ and twelve of some who were excluded,

and none of those who have never been before the court.

24
QUESTION: Well, twelve is at least nine.
MR. SAXTON:
QUESTION:

Right.
But all of your clients are interveners,

even though they may not have been included?
MR. SAXTON:

That is correct, Mr# Justice

Rehnquist.
As I was going to point out, in most cases the
petitioner school districts' racial composition, in terms of
its pupil composition, is majority white. This is not true
in all cases, well, it is the majority in all cases, but,
for instance, in the case of River Rouge, which is roughly
43.5 percent black pupil population, and in one or two other
districts, the racial composition is from 10 to 15 percent
black.
I might point out to the Court that there is an
exhibit contained in Volume V of the five-volume Appendix,
which I believe is Exhibit 12, which will give the racial
composition, school district-wise, of all of the school
districts involved in the plan.
If I may digress a moment, Mr, Justice Burger, the
Chief Justice, I believe, asked about the amended complaint,
I think that's at Volume I of the five-volume work, at page
294 — la 290, and I believe the particular part that the
Attorney General referred to is at page 294.
At the outset it should be emphasized that there

25
is absolutely no claim, and there is absolutely no finding
in this case that any school district in the entire State of
Michigan, with the singular exception of the City of Detroit
School District, that has committed an act of de jure
segregation, and that includes all of these petitioner
school districts.
There is no claim in this case, there is no evidence
in this case, that any school district in the State of
Michigan, including Detroit, was established or created for
the purpose of fostering racial segregation in the public
schools.
The City of Detroit School District was created as
co-terminus to the city boundaries over a hundred years ago.
Unlike cases like U.S. vs. Missouri, and U.S. vs. Texas,
there has been no gerrymandering of school district boundary
lines or changes for the purpose of including or excluding
black students.
The District Court in this case conducted its
trial on the merits on the sole and singular issue of whether
or not tlie Detroit School System was operated as a de jure
segregated school system; not established but operated.
On September 27th of 1971, he issued a so-called
Ruling on Segregation, in which he found that as a result of
acts committed by the Detroit School Board, which he also found
were aided and abetted by acts of certain officials of the

26
State government, that the Detroit School District was
operated as a de jure system.
In October of 1971, the first inkling came that the
remedy might exceed the trial on the merits, and the newspapers
carried a story that the District Court was requiring the
State defendants to submit plans for so-called metropolitan
desegregation.
I submit this is a misnomer in itself, because
there's no evidence there's any metropolitan segregation, and
therefore there is no metropolitan desegregation warranted.
In some of the briefs, the petitioner school
districts have been criticized for not intervening in this
case sooner.

I would merely submit it's rather hard to get

into a case where you're not a defendant, where no claims are
made against you, and where the only issue relates to the
City of Detroit School District.
As soon as it became obvious that the District Judge
intended to embellish the remedy beyond the scope of the trial
on the merits, the petitioners intervened.
Wow, the petitioners here do not contend that the
findings with respect to the de jure operation of the Detroit
School District are erroneous, nor that they should be set
aside.
What the petitioners here do contend is that those
findings, which are limited in scope and effect to the

27

operation of the Detroit School District, may not be used
like a rubber band to snap in all the petitioner school
districts in a so-called metropolitan remedy, which has,
as its avowed purpose, under the decisions of both lower
courts, the desegregation of the Detroit School System.
We think, Your Honors,.that part of the problem here
arises from strange semantics.

What does desegregation mean?

Well, as viewed by the District Court, and as
viewed by the Court of Appeals' majority for the Sixth
Circuit, it obviously means a minority black school system.
We submit that nothing in the Constitution of the
United States so prescribes, nor does any decision of this
Court so require.
If the mere existence of racial disparities between
separate, distinct and unrelated school districts does not
offend the Constitution, and we submit it does not, then
there is absolutely no basis upon which a multidistrict
remedy can be predicated in this case.
Let me say this;

You will search this record in

vain to find one whits.of evidentiary material that any
suburban school district committed any de jure act of
segregation, either by itself, in complicity with the State,
or complicity with anyone else.
There is no such evidence.
The Court of Appeals tries to put together in its

28

opinion a metropolitan remedy by the very tenuous strain
that there is a vicarious liability here which permits

the

metropolitan remedy, because State officials were involved
in the desegregatory action in Detroit.
There's rather an anomaly here that does require
the Court to follow a little bit the rulings of the Court of
Appeals,
The Court of Appeals’ majority for the Sixth
Circuit only affirmed the findings of fact in two orders
issued by the District Court, and this is found, if you will,
at page 112 of this separate volume to the Petition for
Certiorari.
You'll note on page 112 that the court only affirmed
findings in two orders, the order on the ruling on Issue of
Segregation, and the order where the Findings of Fact and
Conclusions of Law on a "Detroit only" plan of desegregation.
Then if you will turn to pages 177 and 178, you
will note that all orders issued by the District Court,
which were before the Court of Appeals, and are set forth at
page 112 of the record, were vacated by the Court of Appeals.
How, I state that as background because despite
having vacated, the only orders where any;suburban>,school
district is mentioned,

or suburban school districts, the

court uses statements in the very orders it vacated, as a
grounds for premising a metropolitan remedy.

29
Now, I submit that's somewhat an anomaly, when the
court will extract statements from rulings and orders that it
did not affirm, and which it itself vacated.
There are only two mentions in this whole record of
anything about suburban school districts.
The first one has to do with the Carver School
District, which was mentioned by Attorney General Kelley.
I would call the Court's attention to the fact that
there are only four places in this entire record where the
Carver School District is mentioned.

It initially comes into

the record because it was submitted as a statement by the
plaintiffs in this case as part of their proposed findings of
fact and conclusions of law in support of a metropolitan remedy.
The plaintiffs initially made the gratitutous
statement that no suburban school district would accept the
Carver students.
There is no evidence in this record that will
support that statement.

I think it is incumbent upon the

respondents plaintiffs in this case to indicate to the Court
where it can be found.

We have searched the record in vain.

As far as the lower court's finding on the Carver
School District is concerned, it comes as a footnote to his
ruling on governments for a metropolitan plan, which appears
at page 96a of this volume submitted with the Petition for
Certiorari

30
Now, as far as the Court of Appeals decision on the
Carver School District is concerned, the Court of Appeals
stated that the lower court was right in basing its finding
on the Carver School District based upon the testimony of
Dr. Norman

Drachler, who testified that there were students

in the Carver School District who were bused to the Northern
High School in Detroit.
The Court of Appeals opinion embellishes on this
by copying from the plaintiffs' proposed, findings, and says
that that occurred because no white suburban school district
would take these students, and because no white school
district in Detroit would take them.
The Court of Appeals, however, did not read all of
Dr. Drachler's testimony.

In Volume V a, of the five-volume

Appendix, page 186, the same witness, upon whom they rely
for their findings, testified that the Carver students were
bused past Mumford, the nearest white school in Detroit —
not for segregatory purposes, because Mumford was overcrowded.
I'd ask the Court to look carefully at. the Court of
Appeals finding, based upon Dr. Drachler's testimony.
testimony which they rely on starts outs

The

I was told.

I was

not in the Central Office in 1957 and '58.
The most rankest form of hearsay.

He was told, and there

is no indication in the record even by whom he was told.
And on that slender thread was put together a pillar to

31
formulate a metropolitan remedy affecting nearly a million
parents and children in 53 school districts.
Now, the only other mention of any suburban school
districts or any of their activities is the gratitutous
statement that construction policies pursued in suburban areas,
or areas outside of Detroit, caused segregation in Detroit.
Nov/, this can only be upheld on the strained idea
that if the suburban areas or the independent school districts
outside of Detroit had not built any schools, then no white
families would have been able to move out of Detroit with
children, because there wouldn't have been any place for them
to go to school.
And underlying this contention is the fallacious
argument that merely by building a school to serve the
population in that area, that that acts as a lure to white
citizens in a central city, and therefore is an act of
segregation.
We submit that's too tenuous to support a metropolitan
remedy.
The Court of Appeals and the lower court have
misapprehended the controlling principles of law enunciated
by this Court,beginning with Brown, that the rule is that if
education is provided by the State, it must be made available
on equal terms to all.

There is no evidence in this record

that that has not been done in any school district other than

32

Detroit,
In Swann, this Court said that the task is to correct
the constitutional violation by balancing the individual and
collective interest*

That means that the interest of those

one million parents and children who live outside Detroit,
who have paid taxes to support their school district, who have
considerable investments in homes, who have input into the
local school, who desire to continue the concept of local
schools, also have interest in this case, equally as well as
the plaintiffs.
And if those interests are to be balanced, the
rights of these people may not be sacrificed on the altar of
racial balance in order that their children may be judicially
conscripted and interchanged with students in Detroit.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. BORK;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
The United States appears as amicus curiae here
today because the Court's resolution of the issues in this
case will affect the government's responsibility in the school
desegregation area.

33

I think I need not recite the facts or the proceedings
that have occurred so far.
Prom our point of view, the unique aspect of this
case is that an extensive interdistrict remedy is contemplated.
Certainly — almost certainly including busing.
And it involves — a remedy that involves not merely
costs to the children in Detroit and the rest of the area, but
also widespread disruption of long-established governmental
units.

And that remedy is ordered as supposedly a remedy

for racial discrimination found to have occurred so far only
within the City of Detroit.
The government believes that a remedy so dispropor­
tionate to the violation found is an improper exercise of
judicial power.
And in that sense the case involves precedent for
future remedies and also a question of the proper role of the
judiciary in this —■ in government in this area.
The issue seems to us fairly simple.

The reasoning

of the Court of Appeals majority and of the District Court
K

contains an obvious flaw.

That reasoning runs like this;

Unconstitutional segregation of school children has
occurred in Detroit.

The law now requires that the unlawful

dual system be converted to a unitary system.

There are too

few white children in Detroit to achieve a truly integrated
school system and, in fact, busing or a remedy confined to

34

Detroit might merely hasten the departure of other whites,
and thus leave the Detroit system identifiably black.
It follows, according to the court's reasoning,
therefore, that the only

effective remedy is for the court

to reach out to the suburban school districts to find enough
white children to provide racial balance in Detroit.
The fatal defect in that reasoning is that it equates
the concept of a unitary system with a particular ratio of
black and white school children.

Those concepts may not be

equated.
As this Court's opinion in Swann makes quite clear,
and indeed as this Court's opinion in its affirmance of
Spencer v. Kugler makes quite clear, a unitary school system
is not one containing any particular proportion of the races.
It is simply cne in which State action does not separate
the races.
Thus, a remedy confined to Detroit is completely
adequate to meet the law's command that the unconstitutional
school system be dismantled and converted to a unitary system.
The inter-district remedy here contemplated by the
court below is not tailored to the constitutional violation
shown, as the Swann opinion says it should be.

If the

respondents wish an intendistrict remedy, then we suggest that
this case should be remanded for trial and findings concerning
the presence or absence of constitutional violations that

35
directly altered or substantially affected the respective
racial composition of the Detroit school system and the
specific suburban school systems.
QUESTION; Can you tell me, Mr. Solicitor General,
when, in the course of this litigation, the allegations were
made that the outlying districts, 44 or 54, whatever they
amount to, had engaged in conduct violative of the

districts themselves might resist it.

I assume that would be an interdistrict violation, which
would justify an interdistrict remedy.

QUESTION;

Mr. Solicitor, in addition to this inter­

district point, don't you think it's — the Court of Appeals,
the trial court, or somebody should get a new shot at this?
There's no order yet.
MR. BORKs
QUESTION:

I mean you —
Oh ~
— mentioned busing and rightfully so,

MR. BORK:

Mr. Justice Marshall, I certainly think

they should have a -- a new shot at this case.

I think it is

undeniable that what is contemplated by the Court of Appeals
and what was contemplated by the District Court is an inter­
district remedy that would necessarily involve a great deal
of busing.
QUESTION:
MR. BORK:
QUESTION:

Well, it hasn't been done yet.
No, sir.

And I think —

None of it's been done.

And don't you

think it — they should have another shot at how it's —
whether it can be done, whether it should be done, and,even
more importantly, if they go to those two, it's how it should

39

be done.
MR. BORK;

I

*— I —

QUESTION:

And the trial court should do that.

MR. BORK;

Mr. Justice Marshall, I entirely agree

that the trial court should do that, but I think the trial
court should not begin that study until it has found inter­
district violations that must serve as the predicate for
that remedy.
It seems to me that until a showing of racial
discrimination, which affects cross-district lines, is made,
then an interdistrict remedy, whether it includes busing or
not, is not designed to remedy constitutional violations.
But, rather, it is designed to interfere with the consequences
of demographic.shiffcs.
The redesign of demographic patterns, I think, is
not a proper function of the federal courts.

This Court noted

in, Swannf where there were —• that even where there are
constitutional violations within a district, once those
violations have been remedied, and a unitary school district
created, there will be no occasion, and there should be no
further occasion for a federal court to continue to pursue
demographic changes.
And I would think it follows, a fortiori, that
where there is no violation affecting the relative racial
compositions of two districts, that there would certainly be

40
no case for a federal court to concern itself with demographic
patterns.
But that conclusion seems to me to be reinforced
by the substantial interest in preserving governmental units,
that are certainly present in this case, including school
districts.

In this line.
So far as we have on the record there is no school

district line that was not established for neutral reasons.
There is no school district line that we know of that was
altered or established in order to affect any racial distri­
bution.
It may be that something like that can be shown,
but it hasn't been shown yet.
The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit refers to
these school district lines as artificial lines, and I think
that kind of remark ought to be noted and rebutted.
These are not artificial lines.

When you first

draw a line on a map, it is in some sense artificial, you
could have drawn it elsewhere.

But over a period of years,

in this case, as the City of Detroit, over a period of 142 years,
people arrange their lives according to where that line rests
on the map.
If you move the line, people would rearrange their
lives over a period of time; according to v/here those lines
are.

41
They are not artificial lines.

They are lines that

dramatically affect individual and governmental interests.
QUESTIONs

Well, they're artificial lines in the

same sense that the boundary between Ohio and Indiana is an
artificial line.

Isn't that correct?

It's not a natural ~

MR. BORK:

Indeed it is correct, Mr. Justice —

— that the boundary between Connecticut

That's what I understood the — all

that the Court of Appeals was talking about.
MR. BORK:

Well, I think the implication in the word

"artificial" was that, therefore, there is no particular
reason not to shift those lines or to respect those lines.
And I was suggesting that there is, because people have
arranged governmental units, bonding financing, control of
local schools; they have arranged their lives according to
where those lines are.
QUESTION:

We have another example of that, do we

not, in the line between, let us say, the Fourth Circuit and
the Fifth Circuit?

A Fourth Circuit district court case would

42

not do very well in an appeal in the Fifth Circuit, would it?

I think not, Mr. Chief Justice.

there probably are occasions when an attorney would like to
be able to cross over.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. HAROLD FLANNERY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS.
MR. FLANNERY;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
To our minds the issue here is whether the courts
below were correct in holding, upon the record in this case
with respect to the nature and scope of the segregation
violation, that interdistrict desegregation relief must be
considered.
In that context, if the Court please, I propose to
address the nature and scope, or extent of the violation as a
predicate for proposed interdistrict remedies? and, secondly,
the opportunity of suburban districts to be heard, both
heretofore and hereafter.
My associate, subject to the concurrence of the Court,
my associate Mr. Jones, will address himself primarily to the
practicalities of interdistrict desegregation, including
Michigan law and practice with respect to its district
educational units and their boundaries.

43

QUESTION:

Mr. Flannery, you represent here Mr.

Bradley and others?
MR. FLANNERY:
QUESTION s

I do, Your Honor.

Unh-hunh.

MR. FLANNERY:

It appears to petitioners at this

writing that there are proffered to the Court different
analyses of this issue.
As I understand the petitioners, Allen Park and the
State of Michigan, interdistrict remedies may be considered
in only two situations, where there has been manipulation
or gerrymandering of school district lines as in Gomillion v.
Lightfoot, where there has been segregative racial exclusionary
conduct on the part of suburban school districts.
Perhaps, although it was not mentioned, where
changes in lines might impair a free existing constitutional
obligation as in Emporia and Scotland Neck.
It appears to us that the Detroit Board, in its
brief, the Detroit Board respondents, take a different view
as we understand their position and as characterized by the
Solicitor General, as school districts, both constitutionally
and under Michigan law, are not more than artifacts of
convenience of a State education system.

When it is found

that black pupils have been segregated on the basis of race,
by the State, acting at the State level, and through its
local units, then practicable desegregation must be achieved

44
for tlie affected children.

And practicable desegregation

may require the crossing of school district lines, unless
it can be shown that there is a counterveiling compelling
State interest.
The Solicitor General offered what appears to be
the petitioners to be a middle ground.

If I read the

Solicitor General's brief correctly, pages — I have
particular reference to pages 10 and 13 and 14 — it would
be his viextf that the courts below need not find segregative
practices on the part of suburban districts, nor need they
find manipulation or gerrymandering of school district lines.
Indeed, interdistrict relief could be predicated,
in the view of the Solicitor General, upon a finding that a
violation, either by the State or by several districts, or
even by one district, had affected or substantially altered
I believe the phrase is in his brief —■ the composition of
schools in a different district.
If I have correctly characterized, from pages 10
and pages 13 and 14, the view of the Solicitor General, I
would note parenthetically that we find it too cramped for
the affirmative breach of the Fourteenth Amendment, but it
has a virtue in this instance, may it please the Court, of
fitting the facts of this record.
It is the view of the petitioners that two courts
below, a total of ten Federal judges below, have examined the

45
facts in this case very carefully, and have come to the
conclusion, if I may summarize it too cryptically, not
only that there were conventional segregative practices
affecting a limited number of school children within the
Detroit district.

On the contrary, there were such segregative

practices by the State of Michigan, acting through its local
agents, the Detroit Board, and acting at the State level.
There were a variety of other governmental private
and quasi-governraental practices which caused housing
segregation and school segregation to be mutually supportive,
mutually interlocking devices.

With the result, may it

please the Court, if you can perceive the tri-county area
in your mind's eye, with the result that black families
and black children were confined to a small portion of the
tri-coimty area and to the schools located therein, and
both directly and by the reciprocal mechanism noted by Mr.
Justice Brennan's opinion for the Court in the Keves case,
the confinement of black children to an identifiable —
today expanding but always during the relevant period —
identifiable core

of black schools, inevitably created

on the fringe of Detroit and beyond the border of Detroit
without regard to its permeability or impermeability, a
corresponding reciprocal ring of white schools.
With the Court’s indulgence, I would like to discuss
briefly the segregative school practices arid their reciprocal

46

effects as addressed by the courts below»
At pages 122a and 123 of the Certiorari Appendix
it was noted that as early as 1960 protests were made by a
man who was subsequently an official of the Detroit School
System, against what was characterized as a policy of
containment, of minority groups, within specified boundaries?
when, in 1959, a school district, the Center School District,
was created on the basis of where black people resided at
that time in Detroit»
The courts below found that the drawing of
attendance zone lines along north-south lines, which also
conformed, knowingly and deliberately, to the residential
configurations in the City of Detroit, served to confine
black families to the schools designated for that area»
The courts further found that manipulation of
attendance zones, feeder patterns, and grade structures
had conformed

the composition of schools to the composition

— racial composition — of neighborhoods»
The courts below noted, and I’m referring now to the
Higginbothom School, page 26a, in Judge Roth's District Court
opinion, Volume Ilia, at 206 in the Appendix, the building
and maintenance of a school and its attendant zone to
contain black students.
At times black students were transported to relieve
overcrowding* past white schools with space, to other black

47
schools.
Now, this .is, of course, a segregative practice, as
described in countless cases by other federal courts arid
noted by this Court in its Keyes opinion.

But the fact is

that the courts below found that it was having, in addition
to school segregation, it was having a segregative effect on
neighborhoods.

Because when families seek to disperse through­

out the Detroit area, or on a broader basis, the phenomenon
of reassigning children in those families back to black
schools — because they must be transported somewhere to
relieve overcrowding — effectively deters dispersal.
QUESTION;

This was when, during the Sixties,

Fifties or Sixties?
MR, FLANNERY:

Oh, yes, the transportation of

black children occurred lip to the time of trial,
QUESTION: And in the City of Detroit so far, what
you described?
MR. FLANNERY:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

Now, for descriptive convenience, of course, it’s
helpful to an advocate, I think, to try to separate the role
of the State from the role of the city, from the role of
other governmental units.

But I invite the Court’s attention

to the fact that. Judge Roth and the majority of the Court of
Appeals underscored idle fact that these were a series of
mutually supportive, interlocking devices that were operative.

48

It wasn't the State's role in isolation today and the Detroit
Board's role in isolation tomorrow.

All of these factors,

especially the segregated school practices, operated in lockstep with an areawide metropolitan policy of confining by
housing discrimination at the local level, at the governmental
levels, both State and federal, and at the private level,
confining black families to an identifiable core

in Detroit,

which is, to be sure, expanding but still surrounded by a
white ring of reciprocal corresponding schools, now
separated only by the border •— or soon to be separated only
by the border, as Judge Roth observed.
The policies of the State, let me advert to them
very briefly, constitutionally at all times and explicitly
under Michigan law until 1962, the State level school author­
ities bore school site selection responsibilities.

And the

Courts noted that school site selection on a segregated
basis proceeded apace during the period from 1950 to 1969.
We have noted several times that the State
discriminated in its educational policies against Detroit as
a shool system.

It has been observed, and I acknowledge

rightly, by the petitioners that such discrimination against
Detroit did not have race as its primary object, was not
Linately racial, it was a common phenomenon in this country,
of perhaps too common, of a form of State legislative
discrimination against big cities.

49
By the point we are trying to make is that at the
time these policies caused Detroit to be perceived as a dis­
favored school system, as the stepchild of the State education
units, at that time,the testimony is comprehensive in the
record, there was, throughout the metropolitan area a policy
of excluding black families from residential opportunities
outside the City of Detroit.
So that fami.lies choosing to respond to the lure of
more favored schools in the metropolitan area, namely those
outside Detroit, were only white families.

Black families'

opportunities were limited.
So the actual workings of the transportation formula
have been the subject of dispute.
The point is that there was not reimbursement for
Detroit and other, some other city transportation, although
it's interesting to note that when city transportation was
ended in the statute referred to earlier in response to Mr,
Justice Stewart's question, there was also a grandfather
clause, and today some cities that would be ineligible
remain eligible if they remain outside the Detroit area,
by virtue of that grandfather clause.

That is, they had

been receiving transportation reimbursement before it was cut

off.
The working of the bonding formula, the working of
the State aid formula — again this is not Rodriguez, these

50

are not cited as deficiencies inherent on constitutionalifcies
on their own, they are cited as evidentiary of Michigan’s
disfavoring of Detroit as a school system, at a time when
black people were confined there, and white people were
responding to the message that there were hundreds of
thousands of new seats going up in the suburbs in attractive
new schools,
Now, the culminating contribution of Detroit

of

the State of Michigan, rather, to Detroit’s present status
as a segregated district was Act 48 of 1970,

This Act is

fully parsed in the briefs, I’ll not labor it — not impose
upon the Court's time to labor it; but I would note that for
the first time the State’s local educational agency practices
effecting segregation had begun to falter.
Up to that point, the local agency had done all that
needed to be done in order to accomplish the job of segregating
black from white children.
In 1970 an amelioration was proposed, and the State

as the pupil assignment patterns in that school system.
With the result, Your Honors, that the message was
imparted, it seems to us, to all the citizens of Michigan and

51
to the citizens of Detroit, that Detroit was not an autonomous
school system, but the State would intervene and manage the
school affairs of Detroit in the most vital day-to-day sense,
when the objective was the retention of segregation.
So it appears to us that a variety of State
practices, some implemented at the local level, some by
State education officials, have combined with massive housing
segregation throughout the Detroit metropolitan area, each
reinforcing the other, as noted by this Court in Swann, and
again in Keyes.

Each reinforcing the other, and carefully

parsed by the courts below to result in this pattern.
Now, the question has arisen;

whether the

petitioners brought this analysis to the Court’s attention
heretofore, is this an eleventh-«hour consideration, or have
these matters been addressed in the courts below?
I invite the Court's attention to Volume II, page
11, very early in the first week of trial, a witness is
speaking of the basic containment pattern that was emerging
as early as 1950.
Throughout that volume, pages 12 through 84,
approximately seven or eight witnesses who repeatedly speak
of the containment, pattern, housing and schools, that was
coming to characterize the metropolitan area, not merely the
City of Detroit.
I do not represent to the Court that every witness

52
said, to a man, there is an interlocking pattern of housing
and schools, and it's limited not to Detroit but includes
the whole metropolitan area.
But that was the testimony of a number of the
witnesses, and that, more importantly, was the finding of
both lower courts»
And it is suggested, it is suggested that only at
the eleventh-hour did it occur to the plaintiffs to introduce
the concept of metropolitan relief.
At that same Volume II of the Joint Appendix, I
invite the Court's attention to page 41 and 44 and thereafter
to page 70.
To summarize very briefly, Judge Roth admonished
counsel for the plaintiffs not to take the witness into
questions involving metropolitan relief, and counsel for the
plaintiffs responded, on both occasions, at page 44 and at
page 70, in effect:
record will show.

Your Honor, we'll have to see what the
It may develop, on the basis of the record

made in this case — and I remind the Court, this was during
the first week of trial

— that Detroit-only relief may be

found insufficient.
I suggest earnestly to the Court that the notion of
metropolitanwide school-housing or housing-school segregation
was not, in the minds of the lower courts or in the minds of
the plaintiffs, a Johnny-come-1ately objective.

53
And I think the notion that District Judge Roth was
determined from the outset to achieve a racial balance, or
the Detroit Board's more recent notion of racial nonidentifi~
ability, is belied by the fact that on that occasion, at
page 41 and at several other occasions, he admonished
counsel that the initial theory of the complaint had been
Detroit-only violations.
And it was thereafter, when Judge Roth began to
perceive the magnitude of the

violation, as I have endeavored

to describe it to the Court, only thereafter did he begin to
address the question of the scope of the remedy in terms of
the scope of the violation.
If the Court please, we have heard from the counsel
for the petitioners that their opportunities to be heard were
unconstitutionally or at least unfairly suppressed in the
courts below.
I remind the Court that no segregation violations,
no segregative conduct, with respect to the original
oration of school district lines, or on the part of
suburban districts, were alleged.

And that those against whom

violations were alleged, State level officials acting at
their own level and through the Detroit Board, were before the
court.
Moreover, on the basis of Lee v. Macon County, and
United States v. Texas, and on the basis of District Judge

54

Roth’s view of the plenary power of the State under Michigan
law and practice, the parties necessary to grant relief,
including interdistrict relief, were in fact before the court.
In addition, in our view and that of District Judge
Roth, school districts are not persons under the Fifth
Amendment.

Therefore, the inquiry turned to rights to be

afforded suburban districts under Rule 19.
On the one hand, it appeared to us, since the State
has plenary power, since the State had between 1964 and 1968,
for example, reduced the number of school districts in
Michigan from 1400 to 70(3, it appeared that the matter could
proceed without those districts, and that there were difficult
questions of manageability, which districts might be
appropriate and which might not — which has yet to be
determined, as the Court has heard ■— and which other public
officials might possibly be affected by the remedy.
None of these questions could be answered
confidently in late 1971, in September, when the magnitude of
the violation was first held by the court to be as I have
described it.
Consequently, upon application thereafter, still
without claijRS being asserted against suburban school districts,
nor did we agree as to their indispensability for relief,
but in an abundance of caution, upon application intervention
was granted

55
Now, little was done with that opportunity below,
in our judgment, and we have yet to be told what would be
done, what practicalities would be advanced by the local
school district, other than the jurisdictional impermeability
of lines, what knotty, intractable, flinty problems is District
Judge Roth or the Court of Appeals asked to come to grips
with?
Well, we’ve not heard that, either by way of an
offer of proof or otherwise.

Nevertheless, in, it seams to

us, another superabundance of judicial caution, the Court of
Appeals for the United States Sixth Circuit said;

Return

below and you may make defendants, you are obliged to make
defendants of all possibly affected school districts, — that
has been done —- and let them have their say.

Ash we say, we feel this is unnecessary but
appropriate.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We’ll resume there

at one o'clock, Mr. Flannery.
MR. FLANNERY:

Thank you.

was recessed, to reconvene at 1:00 o’clock, p.m., the

56
AFTERNOON SESSION

[1:02 p.m.}
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Flannery, you may

resume where you left off, if you will.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. HAROLD FLANNERY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FLANNERY:

- [Resumed]

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Members of the Court:
I was observing, as we adjourned, that although we
adhere to the view that the suburban school districts are not
in any sense constitutionally or under Rule 19 indispensable
to the granting of appropriate effective relief.
As they were not indispensable to the charge of
illegal segregation, in that no conduct specifically was
attributed to them.
But, nevertheless, that out of what we characterize
as an abundance of caution, the United States Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit remanded with directions that they be
joined as parties defendant in the court below, and that, where
matters are now poised for further proceedings, and the Court
of Appeals placed no limitations on District Judge Roth or
his successor District Judge, as the case may be, with
respect to the interests to be asserted by the suburban
school districts.
So our point on this issue, may it please the Court,

5?

is simply that after three and a half years of litigation,
vis-a-vis the suburban school districts, there is as yet
nothing irretrievable, and it would cost, in terms of judicial
administration, the timely vindication of constitutional
rights to remand and vacate would cost a great deal and gain
nothing? but to remand in the posture as matters now stand
for further proceedings in the District Court would secure,
would guarantee to the suburban school districts all the rights
that are asserted abstractly rather than specifically so
far, to be sure, but all the rights that are asserted by them
to be theirs, and all of the interests.
Those —
QUESTION j

But I take it that the Court of Appeals

has finally decided that there's no need for any more showing
with respect to any discriminatory activity in the suburban
districts?
MR. FLANNERY: The United States Court of Appeals,
as we read tine opinion, Your Honor, has said that Judge Roth
is not required to receive evidence with respect to the
violations and their effects.
QUESTION:

So your answer is yes?

MR. FLANNERY:

Well, they are not prohibited with

respect to that.
QUESTION: Well, I just said the Court of Appeals
has decided that there's no need for any more showing of

58
discriminatory activity in the suburban districts.
MR. FLANNERY:
QUESTION:

I agree, Your Honor.

Well — that's all I asked.

MR. FLANNERY:

The State, as a violator, is

responsible constitutionally and, in Michigan, practicably —
and practically, for the violation here.

And it was on

that basis that District Judge Roth then turned to the question,
on the basis of a metropolitan areawids violation found, and
its effects, not limited to 'the school system of Detroit.
And I wish to emphasize that, because the courts
were under no misapprehension with respect to the nature and
extent of the violation.

And in that context I invite this

Court's attention to the Joint Appendix, at page 23, 24, 76
to 78, and 87 and 88, as a limited number — by no means
exhausted

of references by District Judge Roth to the

metropolitan Detroit areawide nature of the violation.
The Court of Appeals reiterated that view at page
.164 of the same volume, 176, 151, 157, 154, 158, and 172.
Indeed, in language which presaged this Court's
subsequent opinion in the Keyes case, the Court of Appeals
quoted approvingly from United States v. Texas Education Agency,
to the effect that the kind of confinement of black families
and black children to a specific set. of schools in a given
larger area reciprocally created white schools outside that
black core.

59

District Judge Roth, mindful of this Court’s
admonition that any vehicle can bear only so much baggage,
then turned to the question of remedy, including the question
of practicability.

District Judge Roth's mind-set, if you

please, in our judgment was that after school and housing
segregation had caused this containment, this confinement on
a mutually supportive basis, should those phenomena be allowed
to perpetuate duals schools, the pattern of dual schools if
that is practicably to be avoided.
That was the nub of his next inquiry..

And the

question whether it may be practicably avoided necessarily
invited inquiry to the question of whether schools beyond a
given district line are to be viewed as schools, for
example, as multischool attendance zones in one large
decentralized school district which, surely under this Court's
teaching in Keyes, would be included? or whether they were
impermeable jurisdictional barriers to practicable relief.
I thank the Court.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Flannery, just as a matter of

curiosity, may I ask you the same question I asked counsel
in the Richmond cases

If, instead of the City of Detroit,

this were Greater Kansas City, with an artificial State line
in between, I take it like considerations would flow?
MR. FLANNERY:

Well, I think, Your Honor, there

are clear jurisdictional problems in that States under our

60

Federal Constitution have a form of sovereignty, a form of
autonomy, ceded to them by the Constitutions; which, neither
under the Fourteenth Amendment nor under Michigan practice,
do school districts enjoy.

They are nonautonomous, artifacts

of State-ceded power, so that it does appear to me that with
respect to their existence, with respect to their functioning,
vis-a-vis the Fourteenth Amendment as well as Michigan law,
they are different from two States.
QUESTION?

You are saying, then, that's a different

case; right?
MR. FLANNERYs

I would think it is a different case,

Mr. Justice Blackmun.
I would think, however, if States had, between
themselves, made arrangements which resulted in the segregation
of school children, I would think that the federal courts
would sit as a forum to vindicate those rights; but I have
not thought through the jurisdictional questions, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, that's a little different answer
than the one I had before, and it's — I would think this would
flow from your argument here, it's a big "i£H of course, that
if it could be shown that, then what you have said and what
you have argued would seemingly apply

on the interstate

aspect.
MR. FLANNERY:

Given an appropriate forum, in the

resolution of the jurisdictional questions, it would have to

61

to vindicate the rights involved.
QUESTION3

Perhaps the District of Columbia might

have been a better example than Greater Kansas City, because
the area is so much smaller.
QUESTION:

Mr. Flannery, I understood you to say

rights ceded to the States, wouldn't .it be perhaps more
accurate to say the rights reserved —
QUESTION s

Re tained.

MR, FLANNERY:
QUESTION:

— reserved by the States —

MR. FLANNERY:
QUESTION:

Conferred upon? retained.

Retained, Mr. Chief Justice —

— retained by the States, would make

this clearer?
MR. FLANNERY:
QUESTION:

Well, I think, —

The particular rights we're talking

about.
MR. FLANNERY:

I — certainly with respect to

matters of constitutional philosophy, I defer to the Court.
In my view, all of the rights emanated from, the people, some
conferred upon the States, some conferred upon the federal
government.

So I don't view the States as setting up the

central government and retaining some powers.
But I did not mean to imply that it was a matter of
noblesse oblige.

Those are State jurisdictions, different

from that of local school districts, to be sure.

62

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER.»

Very well.

Mr. Jones.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHANIEL R. JONES, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I would like to emphasise during this portion of
my argument two basic themes which guided the District Court
and the Court of Appeals as 'they attempted to grapple with
the flinty and tractable realities involved in vindicating
the constitutional rights of the children found to have been
violated in the core schools of Detroit.
No. 1, the District Court exercised extreme caution
and judicial restraint, in our view, and exerted painstaking
efforts in the examination of the proofs that were offered.
I might note that some portion of this case has been
reviewed by the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit on
four different occasions.

One of these occasions, the panel

of three affirmed the District Court? and, following the
decision by tine Circuit to review en banc, the full court
reviewed the findings and the deliberations that occurred
before Judge Roth.
And as Judge Roth endeavored to probe his way through
the proof and the obligations which flowed from the mandates
of this Court, it’s fair to say that he was guided each step

63
of the way by what this Court has suggested and has directed
in the series of cases which are controlling*
My brother counsel, Mr. Flarmery, outlined the
nature of the violations that occurred inside of the school
area of Detroit, brought about by the actions of the State of
Michigan and its sub-unit, the Detroit School District,, which
led to the containment of 133,000 black children in 133 core
schools surrounded by a ring of white schools*
Now, in the face of these findings, the District
Court, pursuant to the mandate from this Court, had an
obligation to direct the educational authorities in the first
instance to come forward with a plan to disestablish, to
convert this system — which, I might add, the court found
to have been a State educational system -— into a unitary
system.
A plan that promised to realistically work now and
hereafter.

A plan that would eliminate the vestiges of

State-imposed segregation, that would eliminate the core of
State-imposed black schools.
This took the District Court to the qliestion of
desegregation planning.

And we understood, and the court

understood, that planning for desegregation requires the
exercise of the equitable powers of the court; and, in so
doing, the court must be guided by the practicalities of the
local situation, as this Court has directed.

64

And so the District Court commenced hearings on a
Detroit-only remedy, and invited the Detroit School District
to submit a plan or plans,

Not only did the Detroit School

District submit plans, but the plaintiffs offered a plan to
the court.
Upon due consideration, the court rejected the plans
offered by the Detroit School System, and there were two in
number, and it also rejected the plan offered by the
plaintiffs.
In so doing, the court concluded that the ratifica­
tion or the acceptance of any of the plans offered by the
parties would have led to an increase in the black core,
resulting in the perpetuation of a black school district
surrounded by a ring of white schools.
And in view of the fact that this is a State
educational system, and the school districts of the State
comprise and constitute related components of that system.,
the court felt, in the exercise of its authority and obligation
and duty, it had to proceed to a consideration of a metropoli­
tan remedy.
So it initiated a preliminary inquiry as to the
relevant area that should be involved.

It initiated an

exploration of the practicalities involved in a metropolitan
solution to the problem.
Among the practicalities the court considered was

65
the relevant area, boundaries, law and practice, and weighing
those against constitutional rights that it had an obligation
to vindicate.
With respect to the relevant area, the court took
note of the fact that the tri-county area would be a proper
benchmark.

The tri-county area consists of Wayne, Oakland

and Macomb Counties.
These three counties constitute the standard
metropolitan statistical area.

There is a community of

interest which weaves and binds these three counties
together.

They are bound together by economic interests,

recreation interests, social concerns and interests,
governmental interests of various sorts, and a transportation
network.
An example, for instance, of the inextricable
relationship that exists between these three counties was
provided by Mr. Marks in his testimony to Judge Roth,

And

he stated that one-third of all the persons who reside in
Oakland County who work work in Wayne County,
Nearly one-half of all the persons in Macomb County
who are employed are employed in Wayne County.
The court further noted that 20,000 black persons
who live in Detroit go to Warren, Michigan, in the suburbs,
to work every day.
And that housing opportunities are denied them, and

66

for that reason it's necessary for them to commute.
With respect to the law and practice practicalities
that the court considered, the people of Michigan raade a
choice as to the arrangement of the control and power of
their educational system.

And this decision can be traced

back to the time of the Northwest Ordinance, and flows through
to the present time, through a series of constitutional
provisions.

And these constitutional provisions have been

interpreted by the Michigan State Supreme Court to stand for
the proposition that education in the State of Michigan is
a State responsibility.
This propositi.on has been affirmed by the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals on two occasions.

There has been

reference made this morning to the fact, I believe in
response to a question by Mr. Justice Powell, as to the
bonding authority in the State.

And the proof offered to

the District Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals is
that the authority for issuing bonds is reposed in a municipal
finance commission, consisting of Mr. Kelley,

the Attorney

General, the State Superintendent of Education, and one other
State official whom I believe may be the State Treasurer.
Every school district in the State of Michigan, every
one of these 43 intervening school districts, who wish to
issue bonds, must go through this State Commission.
And this State Commission determines the amount of

67
money thereby that will reach the sub™ urn its of State
education.
QUESTIONS

Are the bonds State bonds or local

bonds?
MR. JONESs

These are State approved —* they may be

local bonds , but they must be approved by the
QUESTIONs
isn't it?

But the obligation is the district's,

The obligation is not the State's.
MR. JONES:

Well, by approving, the State — the

State assumes a certain amount of responsibility for the —
for placing it —
QUESTION:

Well, suppose there's a default, may

tile State be held to pay the bond?
MR. JONES:

I am not sure of the answer to that

question, Mr. Justice Brennan.
QUESTION:

What's tiie nature, Mr. Jonesv of the

municipal finance commission's authority to review a
submission by a local board that, say, wants to ask for
approval of a bond issue?
MR. JONES:

It could deny it, and the bond would

not be issued.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

Just in its discretion?
In its discretion.

With respect to the general authority of the
State education department over education in the State, it

68
may be summarized as follows;
It has the authority to remove a school board of a
local district, without any consent of the local patrons.
It has the power to act, it has the power to compel,
it has the power to consolidate, it has the power to merge,
to withhold funds; and, in fact, in 1970 it did withhold funds
from the Grand Rapids School District.
And it has the power to transfer property from one
school district to another.
This is power and authority which is retained and
exercised absolutely by the State educational authorities,
without any consent of the local officials.
QUESTION;

Mr. Jones, how are funds raised for

the operation year-to-year of the school districts?
MR. JONES;

It's raised through the — through

mi 11age, and there is a formula by which the —■ under which
the State contributes a portion of the funds to the various
school districts.
QUESTION:

I think the record shows the State

contributes 34 percent; but does the school board itself
assess the millage rate, and determine its own budget?
MR. JONES;

There is a State Equalization Commis­

sion, Mr. Justice Powell, which provides a formula which
determines the amount of funds which a State may — which a
local school district may raise.

69
QUESTION? Are you saying the State decides the
budget for each one of these school districts?
MR. JONES:

No, sir, I'm not saying that; I'm

saying there is an equalization formula which is State
controlled.
QUESTION:

An equalization formula relates to the

State’s contribution, if it operates like the
which I'm familiar.

States with

But do — who levies the taxes on the

real estate in these school districts?
MR. JONES:

The local districts do that, Mr.

Justice Powell.
QUESTION: The local districts do that?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

That is correct.
And they set their own budgets.
That is correct.

But, irrespective of that, the State — this power
is delegated to the State, in so far as it conforms to the
broad outlines of State policy and State responsibility.
QUESTION:

The State equalization formula which

you describe, Mr. Jones, is that, if you know, is that
substantially the kind of equalization that appeared in the
Rodriquez case, under the Texas statutes, where the poorer
districts would receive more than the more affluent districts?
Is that the kind of a function Michigan has?
MR. JONES:

I think that's — I think that may be

70

generally speaking, Mr. Chief Justice, the same type of
function.

And the reason for advancing it here is to show

that the District Court, as it grappled with these flinty
and tractable realities of how you go about determining a
way to desegregate the schools, measuring whether the
obligations of the Fourteenth Amendment which are placed upon
the court to desegregate may be hemmed in by the school
boundaries to the extent of their autonomy, or whether in
fact there is a State education system.
These were the factors the court took into considera­
tion in reaching its determination that this is a State
system* with certain delegated authority.
QUESTION: What happens, Mr. Jones, if this plan goes
forward, will each of these outlined municipalities incur a
greater expense than they now do, than they now budget, to
run their school system?
MR. JONES:

Well, there's no answer to that, Mr.

Justice Brennan, for the reason that there is no plan before
the Court.

The — all that is before the Court now is the

narrow question of whether or not these boundaries, these
geographical boundaries, are impermeable.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. JONES:

Or whether they may be crossed.

There

is no plan, there is no plan of government, finance? these
are the matters that are poised for determination by the court

71
below based upon the remand of the Sixth Cix'cuit.
QUESTION;

Well, do you suppose when that issue is

addressed there will be some of these school districts will
have larger school populations than they now have?
MR. JONES:

Frankly, I would have no way of knowing.

I think this is something that would have to be hammered out
through the adversary proceedings that would take place before
the appropriate District Court.
QUESTION;

Well, suppose they did?

Would that worry you particularly?

Suppose they

did have higher — a great deal more expense than they had
before, in order to implement this plan?
MR. JONES;

Well, Mr. Justice White, I think this

would be one of the practicalities, and I would trust that the
District Court would take all these matters into considera­
tion.

I would — ray basic objective would be to see that a

constitutionally supportable plan of desegregation were
accomplished, consistent with the practicalities.
QUESTION; Do you think the people in the outlying
districts could fairly be taxed to pay the extra expenses of
an effective remedy for the desegregation of the Detroit
district?
MR. JONES;

Well, Mr. Justice White, they are part

of the State of Michigan, and they're —
QUESTION;

Well, your answer is yes, you do.

72

MR* JONES %

Yes, I think that under their obligations

of citizenship and as citizens of the State of Michigan, this
would be one of the other obligations that they would have to
meet.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Saxton,

Thank you, Mr. Jones.

you have, I believe, nine minutes left.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. SAXTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MU. SAXTON:

Thank you* Mr. Chief Justice.

I understated we have nine minutes.
I would like to raise one matter.

We understood

that counsel for the respondents had distributed some maps,
some overlays for the Court, and we were advised just before
the argument they were being withdrawn.
If they are not being withdrawn, we do have serious
objection to them on the grounds of accuracy and completeness?
if they are being withdrawn, I won't go into -QUESTION:

Well, I have them here; are these they?

MR. SAXTON:

Well, counsel for respondents advised

us they were being withdrawn, and I did note they — although
having been told they were being withdrawn, they are still
in front of the Court.
QUESTION:
MR. SAXTON:
QUESTION:

Can't read them, anyway.
I had the same problem, Mr. Justice,
And there's been no reference to them at

73
all during oral argument.
MR. SAXTON:

All right.

I would like to first of all address myself to some
of Mr. Jones's remarks.

Not being from the State of Michigan,

it's understandable that he would not correctly understand
Michigan law relating to school districts.
First of all, the bonding authority for local school
districts is not in the Municipal Finance Commission.

The

Municipal Finance Commission is a commission of State
officers that's created to see that school districts follow
statutory requirements when they seek to borrow money.

If

they meet those statutory requirements, the bonding must be
approved.

If they don't, the Commission can refuse them.
Under Michigan law, in fact, the Commission can be

required to approve it by mandamus, if all the statutory
conditions are met.
The State Equalization Boax*d has absolutely nothing
to do with the levy of millage in local school districts.
The amount of millage to be raised is determined, first of all,
by the School Board itself, really generally on the basis of
what the market will bear.

It is then submitted to a vote

of the people.
The State Equalisation Board is a board that's set
up by the State to make sure that an assessing of real
property in the State, that the same basic format is used so

74
that in different taxing areas you won't have different bases
for taxing property.

That’s correct.
With respect to one other remark by Mr. Jones, the
State -QUESTION:

I suppose there are State laws, limitations

both on the milage and the amount of bonded indebtedness —
MR. SAXTON:

Yes.

They may borrow without a

vote, they may — the School District may, in fact, borrow
without a vote of its local electorate, ~~
QUESTION:
MR. SAXTON:

Up to a certain ceiling?
— up to the point of five percent of

its tax base within the School District.
QUESTION: Right.

Beyond that it ~

75
HR» SAXTON;

Beyond -that they must go and get

local voter approval.
QUESTION; And I suppose there are similar limitations
upon the amount of bonded indebtedness; are there?
HR. SAXTON;

That is correct, sir.

One other point Mr. Jones alluded to, that the State
had the power to remove school board officials without cause,
is simply not so.

The statute is cited in our reply brief.

School Board members may be removed only for misfeasance or
malfeasance in office, and then only after due notice, a
public hearing, and a finding of failure to comply with
statutory responsibility.
QUESTION;

And who has the power of removal, for

cause?
MR. SAXTON:

The State Board may remove them after

due notice, a hearing, and a finding.
QUESTION;
MR. SAXTON;

The State Board of Education?
And that, of course, may be appealed

to the court system in the State.
QUESTION; The State Board of Education?
MR, SAXTON;
QUESTION;

That’s correct, Mr. Justice.
How are School Board members ~~ how do

they become School Board members, by election?

QUESTION:

Unh-hunh»

They're nonpaying jobs?

Or paying jobs?
MR» SAXTON:

Well, sometimes it's nonpaying, and

the highest one I've ever known of is $75 a year.

It's not

very well-paying, Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION: Does the governing board of the county
have anything to say about using School Board members?
MR. SAXTON:

No.

No, that's purely a local

matter, it's decided by local election.
I would like to address myself to a few remarks
made by Mr. Flannery,
As I listened to Mr. Flannery, I thought of an old
lady trying to knit a sweater without any thread? it just
wouldn't stretch that far.
There is no violation in this case that extends
beyond the City of Detroit»
Mr. Flannery'3 statement, and I use his words, that
what we're involved with here in terms of a metropolitan
remedy is practicable desegregation — that's his term.
I don't find that term in any of the decisions of
this Court.

The term I always find is, based on Swann, is

that if there is a constitutional violation, the nature of that
violation will determine the scope of the remedy.
Not a question of practicable desegregation, but when

77
unconstitutional activity has resulted in segregation, there
must be visible desegregation within the scope of the viola­
tion.
There has been no violation outside the City of
Detroit here.
segregation.

Mr. Flannery made reference to residential
I would call to the Court’s attention that on

page 159a of the Appendix filed, with the Petition for
Certiorari, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals went out of
its way to say that no part of their findings were based
upon residential segregation.
What it all comes down to is there is simply no
violation upon which a metropolitan remedy can be supported.
Unless tinis Court is now prepared to say that it's
not the nature of the violation that determines the scope of
the remedy but the violator; if the violator determines the
scope of the reiaedy, then all remedies will always be co­
extensive with the border's of any State.

Because, in the

last analysis, education is a State function,

in every one

of the Fifty States of the Union.
If, however, this Court is going to adhere to
previous principles which it has announced, namely, that the
violation will determine the scope of the remedy, this
remedy must stop at the boundary lines of the Detroit School
District.
Plaintiffs’ expert witness, Dr. Foster, testified in

78

this case that desegregation# both in the practical#
constitutional and educational sense# does not require a
remedy extending beyond Detroit»
There is only one premise where a remedy
extends beyond Detroit# and that’s racial balance; there is
no other premise upon which to predicate it.
Now# with respect to the Solicitor General's comments#
we would concur in his argument that there is absolutely no
predicate for a multidistrict remedy in this case.

We would

disagree with his suggestion that this case should be
remanded.
This is not like Keyes # where the lower court applied
the wrong standard in arriving at a violation.
nothing to be remanded here.

There is

The suggestion of remand is

that the case should be sent back so a new lawsuit could be
started under the aegis of this one.
This case# we submit# should be reversed# in so far
as the finding is that desegregation cannot be accomplished
within Detroit# and in so far as there is a finding that a
multidistrict remedy is proper without a constitutional
violation.
If the plaintiffs then desire to bring a lawsuit of
another character# that's certainly within their power. But
we do not think it’s within the province of the appellate
court to properly exercise its discretion to remand the case

79

to permit plaintiffs to bring a new and different lawsuit
founded on new and different grounds.
We submit that this case should be reversed, in so
far as a metropolitan remedy is concerned, and the petitioner
school districts should be dismissed.
QUESTION;

What's the — under what federal law

do they, did the plaintiffs proceed?
MR. SAXTON:

The plaintiffs brought this lawsuit

under the Thirteenth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment and,
I think, the Civil Rights Act of 1866.
QUESTION;
MR. SAXTON:

This is a 1983 suit?
I think it's 1981, 1983, the Thirteenth

and Fourth Amendments.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

But jurisdictionwise, I

suppose it's 1343?
MR. SAXTON:

That's correct, as I understand it.

QUESTION; And is the — are the school districts
persons for the purposes of that?
MR. SAXTON:

I'd like to answer that.

My answer

to that is yes, that the Michigan Supreme Court, as noted
in our reply brief, has said that school districts in
Michigan are municipal corporations.

I think it would be

anomalous for this Court to say that they are not persons
within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, in view of two
recent decisions of the Court

80

QUESTION: Well, how about for 1983 purposes?

A

city is —
HR. SAXTON:

For 1983 purposes, I think they would

not be persons.
QUESTION:

Well, if they're proceeding under 1983,

to the extent this case depends on 1983, the —
MR. SAXTON:

I think the case must fail, because I

think neither the State nor its political subdivisions are
persons within 1983.
QUESTION:

Well, as — does that have any practical

impact on this, also?
HR. SAXTON:

I don't think it does, Mr. Justice

White.
QUESTION:
MR. SAXTON:
QUESTION:
for instance?

Why not?

What about —

Because I don't —•
— what about the Detroit School District,

Is it a defendant?

MR. SAXTON:

Yes, it is a defendant.

QUESTION: And does the Court's jurisdiction over it
rest on 1983?
MR. SAXTON:

I don't think it has jurisdiction

under 1983, because it is not a person within that statute.
May I — could I finish answering —
QUESTION:

I wish you would.

I just don't under­

stand why something — there must be some explanation why a

31
remedy can run against a defendant that the Court has no
jurisdiction over.
MR a SAXTON:

Well, I tii ink, Mr. Justice White,

that the basic predicate for this lav/suit is violation of
the Fourteenth Amendment, equal protection clause; and that's
what the finding of the District Court is predicated on.
QUESTION:

But still — you still get into court

on 1343, which depends on 1983.
MR. SAXTON:

Well, I think part of their jurisdic­

tion, though, is founded on violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment, and that's what the court predicated its findings
on.
QUESTION:

Well, that may be, but I'm not sure

that has a great deal to do with jurisdiction.
MR. SAXTON:

Right.

May I finish answering the

question I started, Your Honor?
QUESTION:
MR. SAXTON:

Certainly.
Of Mr. Chief Justice.

I think it would be anomalous to hold that school
districts are not persons within the Fifth Amendment, in
view of the recent decision written by Mr. Justice Marshall
in Moore vs. Alameda County in California, where this Court
held that a county which had the right to sue and be sued
and to hold property was a person for pxirposes of diversity
of citizenship jurisdiction.

82
Mow, certainly, it would be anomalous to say to a
political public corporation that for purposes of diversity
jurisdiction you're a person, so that you may sue and be
sued in the federal court? but once you get there under the
Fifth Amendment you have no right to a hear, no right to
cross-examine witnesses; in fact, no due process rights at
all o
And I submit that would be a very anomalous result,
to lead a corporation to the federal courts, only to tell them
that they have no rights after they get there»
QUESTION:

Well, I thought Moore was a holding that

a county didn’t partake of the same immunity as the State did
un the Eleventh Amendment»
MR. SAXTON:

I think that's one of the holdings»

But I also -- also in the Illinois vs» City of Milwaukee case,,
which was decided in 1972, I think this Court very clearly
declared that a municipal corporation is a person for purposes
of diversity of citizenship»
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:38 o'clock, p0m„, the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
