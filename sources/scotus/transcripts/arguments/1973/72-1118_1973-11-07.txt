We will hear argument next

in No. 72“1118» Arnett against Kennedy.
Mr. Friedman, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, this is a direct appeal from a judgment of a threejudge district court in the Northern District of Illinois,
holding unconstitutional certain provisions of the LloydLaFollette Act governing the discipline primarily to discharge
of nonprobationary Federal employees.
The case brings before the Court two constitutional
questions, one relating to the procedures followed in terminat­
ing such employees, and the other relating to the validity
of the standards for their termination.
Under the statute and the implementing regulations
of the Civil Service Commission, a nonprobationary Federal
employee may be removed from office after being given a
written statement of charges, an opportunity to reply in
writing or orally, and to submit affidavits, and -the receipt
of a written decision by the officer effecting the termination.
The statute,however, explicitly provides that a
hearing prior to termination is not required.

Under the Civil

Service Commission's regulations, however, the employee following

3

such termination has the right to a hearing either before the
agency or before the Civil Service Commission»
The first question presented is whether this statutory
practice which in. effect defers the evidentiary hearing to an
appeal following the termination satisfies the due process
standards of the Fifth /amendment.
The statute itself provides that a Federal employee
may be removed only for such cause as will promote the
efficiency of the service.

Again, the Civil Service Commission

has implemented this rather general standard through some
regulations which I will corns to shortly.
The substantive question in the ca.se is whether it is a
violation of the First Amendment when

this provision is

applied to terminate the service of a nonprobationary Govern­
ment employee because of statements he has made ,publie
statements;, accusing his superiors of misfeasance and criminal
activity and which, in the judgment of his superiors, effectively
undermines the ability of the agency to perform its services.
Now, the court in this case, invalidated the statute

on, its face on the basis of granting summary judgment for the
appellees, and under civil practices, the validity of that
action is to be tested on the basis of the facts most strongly
supporting the Government.

And accordingly, I shall state the

facts of this case on that basis.
QUESTIONS

Hr. Friedman, I read through the record

4
in the case, the appendix, and I notice that Government supplied
a number of affidavits and the like in connection with motion
to dismiss.

And then looking through the docket entries in

the district court, it x^asn't clear to ms, since there are nons
included in the appendix, whether the Government had those
same affidavits carry over for consideration on & motion for
summary judgment.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It isn’t explicit.

I would assume,

Mr. Justice, they were before the court on the motion for
summary judgment.

But summary judgment was granted against

us, and it seems to me that in considering the propriety of
that action, we can properly look to the evidence that would
support our case, not the evidence that would support their
case.
QUESTION s

It xirould have been evidence that was

before the court.
MR. FRIEDMAN s

Oh, yes.

Oh, yes.

Yes.

But the

evidence before the court included much of the material -that
was -the basis for th© discharge of Mr. Kennedy.
Now, I would like to say one other thing.

In their

brief, the appellees, at pages 2 and 3, have stated that much
of what the Government has sat forth as its statement of the
case is not supported by the record.

V?© disagree with that,

and accordingly in my presentation, whenever we gat to any
controverted materials, I will give record references to the

5
appendix which support the statements I am making.
The appellee,. Mr, Kennedy, at the time of these events
was a field representative in the Chicago office of the Office
of Economic Opportunity,

He was a fairly important man therey

he had a Government grade of GS-12 which is in the intermediate
range and paid, at that time $16,000,
As explained in the instructions that OEO puts out
to its field representatives which are quoted in the record in
the affidavit of the Regional Director, the field representative
was a particularly crucial person in the operation of OEO,
OHO, of course, its basic function is to channel funds to
various community groups to enable them to improve their lot
economically.

And his job was to have contact with the community

action groups, to talk to them, to explain to the community
action groups what OEO was doing, x*;hat its policies were, and
to be sure that these policies were being carried out in the
implementation of the program by the community action groups.
As OEO stated itself, this man as a practical matter
was viewed by the community group as OEO.

His job, as I said,

was to explain these policy decisions.
That material is set forth at pages 24 and 25 of
tli© appendix.
Now, Mr. Kennedy has twice been subjected to
disciplinary action in this situation.

In the first instance,

in November of 1971, he was charged by the Regional Director

6
with various acts of misconduct.

He replied in writing a

lengthy reply which is not included in the appendix.
an oral presentation before the Regional Director.

He had
And follow­

ing this, in January 1972, the Regional Director concluded that
only one of the several charges made against him were sustained
by the evidence, and instead of terminating his services as he
had originally proposed, instead he suspended him for 60 days.
I just mention in passing, because I think this is
an indication of what is involved in this case, the appellees
say that this was outrageous because he was suspended for 60
days on the basis of a single telephone conversation that took
place eleven months before.
Well, the reason for the eleven months before is that
the charges against him which led to the suspension covered a
period of almost a year, and this was the only one of the
charges that was sustained.
But the single telephone conversation was a phone
conversation ha made to officials of one of these community
action groups in which he told them they should get rid of the
existing board of directors and gat themselves a new board of
directors which they could control.

Ha did this in spite of

the fact that there were specific instructions from OEO ,set forth
at pages 38 to 40 of the appendixt that field representatives
ware to keep their hands off the internal operations of these
community action groups.

They were to allow them to make their

7
own decisions even though they seemed wrong, to maintain an
arms-»length posture,

and even though he had previously been

warned against; such activities when ha had a previous situation.
I just may say one thing mora.

I think this

illustrates very dramatically the kind of disruptive effect
this sort of conduct would have.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERj

We will resume there after

lunch.
(Whereupon, at 12 o'clock noon, a luncheon recess
was taken, to reconvene at 1 p.m. the same day.)

3

AFTERNOON SESSION
(IsOO p.m.)
MR. CHIEF «JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Friedman, you may

continue.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
I would now like to come to th© second set of charges
on the basis of which Mr. Kennedy was discharged from Federal
service.

These were served upon him in February 1972,

approximately three weeks after the previous notice of his
suspension.

Basically these charges related to two different

activities.
One related to certain statements he made with
relation to a problem teat had arisen in Chicago relating to
tha Indians in Chicago.
QUESTION:

May I interrupt you for a moment?

MR- FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I don’t want to stop you from discussing

what the reasons were, but are they particularly relevant?

Is

the case going to turn on what tee reasons are?
,

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, the reasons

are important —
QUESTIONs

I can understand your illustrating the

need for expeditious action, but otherwise it isn't relevant,
is it?

9

MR. FRIEDMAN;

I think it is relevant to this

extant, Mr. Chief Justices

One of the claims here is that a

hearing was required in advance of termination.

Under the

statutory provisions, this man is given an opportunity to be
told what the charges are against him, has the opportunity to
respond both orally and in writing,and to submit affidavits.
And then if he is discharged, he has a right to a full hearing
with the complete panoply of procedures after that discharge.
In this case he was given vary specific charges of
certain improprieties, and he did not submit any material at
all. So to that extent we think the facts are significant.
In addition it seems to ms that these facts are
quite significant in evaluating his claim that the statute is
unconstitutional as an infringement of his First Amendment
rights, because our basic position on that is that a conscien­
tious Government employee could really have no doubt that the
kind of things he is alleged to have done would be detrimental
to the efficiency of the service.
That is the reason I am stressing these facts, because
I think the case has to be brought into the proper posture.
Now, the allegations with respect —
QUESTION:

He is working in a vary controversial

field here, isn't he?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION;

He is working in a controversial field.

As controversial as the Interstate Commerce

10

Commission was in 1887 perhaps.
HRa FRIEDMANs

Certainly it is controversial.

But,

Mr. Justice, his role, was supporting OEO in tills controversy.
His job was to represent OEO and to explain to the community
what OEO was doing and to try to persuade the community that it
should accept. OEO * s treatment of this problem.
What h© did, instead of doing that, he turned around
and made a number of very serious, and we think unjustified,
attacks on OEO and on his superiors, attacks which according
to the affidavit of the
QUESTION:

Maybe he was just trying to save OEO.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

With all due respect, Mr. Justice, I

don't think that was his function as an employee of OEO.

If

ha had complaints about OEO, about the way the program was
being administered, it was his obligation, we think, to make
those complaints through channels, not to make statements to
the press, not to male® public at public meetings, at union
meetings.
Let ma tell you what he did, for example. He said
QUESTION:

This is‘quite different from'fche^Departmest of

Justice?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think in terms of what happened,

most assuredly, Mr. Justice.
Let m© tell you exactly what ware tha charges against
him.

First of all, he said that the Regional Director and his

executive assistant had either bribed or attempted to bribe
one of the leaders of the Indian community in Chicago by offer­
ing this man a grant of $100,000 if this man in turn would
rank© a statement, give a written statement, against Mr. Kennedy
and

another employee who was active in the union.

Ha made

this charge at a union meeting, and this charge was repeated
in a newspaper report of the meeting.
QUESTIONS

Was it true?

MR. FRIEDMAN;
no.

I am sorry.

This is true according to the ~ no,

He claims it’s true.

The Regional Director

found it was not true.
Now, in addition to that, he conducted a press
conference in the lobby of the building where QEQ is.

He

conducted it. in the lobby because ha had been refused permission
after his suspension to hold the press conference in the 0E0
offices where he wanted.

And he handed out a press release,1

set forth at pages 44 and 45 of the record, in which he
"/.caused the Regional Director of breaking treaties with the
Indians.

There was a newspaper story covering that.
In addition to that, he made an accusation against

an QEO official that they had violated the QEO conflict of
interest standards by entering into an insurance contract with
a company with which the husband of this woman was connected.
Now, as I have indicated, he was told in this notice
of charges that he could submit either written answers with

12

affidavits

or an oral hearing.

was file an answer which

He did neither.

All he did

is set forth at page 62 of the record

in which he said he wanted a hearing before an impartial
hearing officer, and he said that applying this statute to
punish him, to discharge him on the basis of statements, speech
he had made, violated his rights under the First Amendment.
Following the receipt of this, he did not submit
anything further than that.
The Regional Director informed Mr. Kennedy in writing
that the charges against him were sustained, directed his
removal, and informed Mr. Kennedy that he had a right to appeal
that either to the Agency within the Agency itself or to the
Civil Service Commission.

He elected to appeal to the civil

Service Commission.
I would just like briefly to refer to the affidavit
that the Regional Director submitted in the district court in
opposition to their motion for a stay which would have the
effect of keeping Mr. Kennedy at work.

And he explained in

considerable detail what had led to Mr. Kennedy’s discharge.
And then at the bottom of page 32 and the top of page 33, after
first pointing out that he recognised the importance of free
and open discussion within the Agency, he also recognised the
importance of constructive criticism within the Agency.

But

he said, "However, when the criticisms take the form of
malicious personal attacks made publicly by a Field Represents-

13

tive who is viewed as '0E0' by the community at large, when
the criticisms result in a breakdown in the necessary maintenance
of discipline, produce serious disharmony among coworkers and
loss of morale, and destroy ongoing efforts of this office to
serve the poor and the disadvantaged, then the efficiency of
Government is dealt a severe blow."
QUESTION;

What page are you reading from?

MR. FRIEDMANs
QUESTION:

This is the bottom of page 32.

Thank you.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

He also pointed out at the top of the

page that prior to the issuance of Mr. Kennedy's press release,
the Office had been attempting to put together a coalition
among the Indians of Chicago that would create an organization
that was able to receive and handle a substantial grant.

But

after Mr. Kennedy's' attack on OEQ, as he put it, th© coalition
fell apart.

And as of the time of th© filing of th© affidavit,

ha said they had not been able to put

together another coalition

and process the grant.
In the district court, as I have indicated, the court
first held that the statute was a violation of procedural due
process

because of its failure under the statute and the

procedures to give-'Mr. .Kennedy an adversary full hearing before
his termination,

and on th© basis of that conclusion directed

that Mr. Kennedy be reinstated.

And he has been reinstated.

The court also said that although it recognized that

14
the conduct, the speech, which was the basis for Hr, Kennedy's
discharge did provide a basis for disciplinary action,
nevertheless the statute, it held, was unconstitutional on its
face because it said this vague language is likely to have a
chilling effect upon other employees in the exercise of their
First Amendment rights and enjoined the enforcement of the
statute and regulations — this is the language from 7-A of
our jurisdictional statement, the opinion — insofar as they
are construed to regulate the speech of competitive service
employees, a very broad inj-unction.
Mew, coming to the merits of the case, the statutory
argument, first as with respect to the procedural due process
issue.
The Lloyd-LaFollette Act of 1912 was enacted to
provide substantial protections for Federal employees.

Prior

to that time Federal employees had virtually no job protection
at all.

They were subject almost to dismissal at the whim,

the caprice of thair superiors.

And what Congress did in the

Lloyd-LaFollette Act, key provisions of which in their present
form are set forth at page 37 of the brief, was to do three
things — really two things.
The first was it provides in the first sentence that

axi individual in the competiti vs service may be removed oxsuspended without pay only for such cause as will promota the
efficiency of the sex-vice.

15

For the first tiros it wrote into law a job protection
for Federal employees.

They could only be dismissed for cause

and only such cause as would promote the efficiency of the
service.
Then it provided certain procedural protections.

The

employee was to get notice of the charges, had a reasonable time
to file a written answer to the charges and affidavits, and
was entitled to a written decision.
And then it goes on to say, "Examination of witnesses,
trial, or hearing is not required but may be provided in the
discretion of the individual directing the removal or suspension
without pay."
And what Congress has done has been to leave it to
the individual agency to decide whether or not in following
its discharge procedures it gives the man a hearing prior to
his termination.
At the present time eight agencies do provide for
such pr©termination hearings.

They employ approximately 10

parcent of the Federal work force, but the statistics that we
have from the Civil Service Commission indicate that’s a much
smaller percentage of disciplinary proceedings.

The vast

bulk of government agencies in number covering the vast bulk
of Federal employees do not provide for any pr©discharge
hearing.

What they do provide for is, under the regulations

of the Civil Service Commission, a 30-day notice of charges,

16

full statement of the charges, an opportunity either to apply
in writing ©r ©rally,to submit affidavits, the opportunity of
the man to examine the Civil Service files containing the
information oh which the charges are based, and a written report,
QUESTION?

Not to confront any witnesses,

MR, FRIEDMAN %
at that stage.

Not at that stage, Mr, Justice,

Not

But after, if he is discharged, he has a full

hearing with a complete right t© confront all ths witnesses,
a transcript is taken, produce his own witnesses' , appear by
counsel — and if as a result of that hearing, which as I have
indicated may be either before idle agency or the Civil Service
Commission, if as a result of that hearing he is ordered to be
reinstated, if his discharge is set aside, he gets full back
pay under ths statute for the period he was out of work.
Now, this Court has recognized over the years and
most recently in the Cafeteria Workers case, that without
legislation, unless there is some specific legislative provision,
a Government employee may be summarily discharged.
Here we do have a statute.

We have a statute which

provides that before he can be discharged, it has to be for
cans® and after certain provisions specified by the statute.
Procedural due process, as this Court has many times st&tad, is
a flexible concept.

You don't have fixed rules.

got to weigh competing interests in this situation.
have two competing interests.

You have
Here we

On the one hand is the obvious

17
interest of a Government employee not to have his Federal
employment finally terminated without procedures in which he
can fairly present his case.

On the other hand there is a

very strong Government interest of removing incompetent and
unsuitable employees from the public payroll so that the
Government can proceed with its business effectively and
expeditiously.

And obviously, if a pratermination hearing is

required in every case, this is inevitably bound to delay the
proceedings. It seems to me it is self-evident that if in every
case an employee has the option for a hearing, many employees,
knowing of the delay, are just going to request a hearing.
There are some statistics referred to in an article
by Professor Merrill

it's quoted in our opponents' brief —

iff 59 University of Virginia Lav; Review, points out that
a relatively small percentage of Government disciplinary
actions are taken to hearing.

The figures v\re have, it's some­

thing like maybe 10 percent, something in that range.

And

inevitably this would lead to a proliferation of these hearings
to delay in discharging incompetent or unsuitable Government
employees.
Now, we think that the due process requires no more
in this situation than is done.

That is, the employee has —

this is not a case where someone is cut off with a letter saying,
"You are-terminated today."

The employee has the opportunity

to present, informally to ba sure, but has the opportunity to

18

present to his agency any facts that he believes mitigate
against the proposal or show that it is unsound.

For example,

he can show that perhaps the whole thing rests on a mistake.
Maybe the facts are wrong.
QUESTION;

Mr. Friedman, I suppose you would be making

the same argument if the statute simply said in order to fire
an employe© the Government must write him a letter and give him
a reason, but that is all that the Government has to do,

that

defines his entire right.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would be making the same argument,

Mr. Justice, but I don’t have to male® that argument because —
QUESTION!

You would say in that event there would

ba .no denial of procedure of due process if that is all the
Government did.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
That is correct.

If that’s all the Government did.

But hare —

QUESTION!

Hera they do give them more, but you say

they don’t need to do any more than the statute provides.
MR. FRIEDMAN!
QUESTION:

That is precisely correct.

You say the extent, the contours, the

meets and bounds of his tenure are contained in this statute.
MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTIONs

That’s right.

And the meets and bounds of his tenure

would be contained in the kind of a statute that my Brother
White is suggesting.

That's your point, isn’t it?

19
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But you are also saying, aren't you, that

that’s only against the background of an ultimate full-trial
type hearing on appeal.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

What I am saying, Mr. Justice, is that

I would be prepared to defend the narrower statute, but in
this case, certainly under this procedure —
QUESTION:

Would you defend it if there were not this

d@ novo proceeding on appeal?
MR» FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION;

I would defend it, Mr. Justice.

You would have to; your position entails

that, doesn't it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would defend it, but I don't have

to attempt to justify that position here because here we do have
the complete de novo hearing.
If I may point out, Mr. Justice, this is not just an
idle tning, his ability to respond at the administrative level.
In this vary case, at the previous disciplinary proceeding which
resulted in the suspension initially, initially two or three
charges were made against him, and what was proposed was that
he be discharged.

But as a result of his lengthy submission,

the Regional Director concluded that only one of the charges
was sustained, and instead of discharging him, he only
suspended him for 60 days.
So we think that the result could well have been

20
different in this case if he had submitted to the Regional
Director, which we think was his obligati.on, all of the material
on which he now relies contained in this

appendix which was

submitted for the first time in the district court.
QUESTION :

After he was allowed to confront his

accusers.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

He could have confrented his accusers,

Mr. Justice, at -the hearing that he would have been given before
the Civil Service Commission.
QUESTION:

He could have ?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

I didn't hear you say that.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes.

Oh, yes, Mr. Justice.

I understood that he could file something

in writing and he could say something orally, period.
MR. FRIEDMANs

That is before his agency.

the agency discharges him and he then exercises his right to
appeal either at a higher level of agency —

Now, I would like to turn to the other question
QUESTION:

What do you do with the Pickering case?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Pardon?

What do you do with the Pickering case?

MR, FRIEDMANs

The Pickering case, Mr, Justice, it

seems to me ~~ in the Bickering case this Court recognised
that speech may be a basis for a discharge of a Government
employee.

It held in the particular facts of that case what

the roan did, which was writing this letter to the newspaper,
that that itself was not sufficient in that case, but the
Court recognised that there may be incidents of speech which

22
justify the discharge of a Government employee.

Indeed, in

this very case, the district court recognized that speech may
be a ground for discharging a Government employee.
QUESTION:

Let's suppose the statute says a

Government employee may be discharged at any time for drunken­
ness.

All you have to do is write him a latter and say, "You

are discharged because you are a drunk,”

And you would say

that if that is the standard, nevertheless the Government is
free, as far as the due process clause is concerned, to write
him a letter and say he is a drunk and he can be fired just by
that letter.

You have to take that position.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

As a matter of constitutional lav/,

yes.
QUESTION:

Even though that's the standard for

discharge, drunkenness, his right to contest it can be completely
denied by writing him a letter.
MR* FRIEDMAN:

I would think as a matter of con­

stitutional law, Mr. Justice.

But that's not the practice.

That's not what happens.
QUESTION:

I know, but if you are wrong on this, you

are in a little bit of trouble, aren't you?
MR, FRIEDMANS
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, suppose he said in a public handout

to the press that, "My boss was sober yesterday."
ba the same one?

Would that

23
HR. FRIEDMAN:

I couldn’t sav that.

I think that

might be, under the present statute, detrimental to the
efficiency of the service.
QUESTIONs

To say that his boss was sober yesterday.

MR. FRIEDMANs

Well, that again, it seems to me, Mr.

Justice — these are all questions, these are all questions
which have to be battled out, first at the administrative
level, and then at a hearing.

If he were discharged for making

that single statement, it may be that ultimately the Civil
Service Commission would hold that that was not enough to
constitute conduct detrimental to the efficiency of the service.
It would depend on the context in which it was said,

I mean,

if what he said at a public meeting of all the employees is,
"Surprise, surprise, my boss was sober yesterday," it seems to
me that may be' a different thing.
I think this goes to the essence, this goes to the
essence of the prohibitions dealing with the speech —
QUESTION*

You don't see any chilling effect on the

employees in that particular outfit, do you?
MR. FRIEDMANs

Wall, I think, Mr. Justice, speaking

in terms of chilling effect, there has got to be something
specific, arid I don’t think —
QUESTION:

Like being fired.

MR. FRIEDMANs
involved.

No.

In terms of the precise conduct

I don’t really think that any employee, Government

employee, any responsible Government employee, can fairly
contend that the (exercise of his First Amendment rights are
chilled because Mr* Kennedy is fired for making these kinds of
statements against his superior.

That’s the issue, it seems to

me, and this Court in the Pickering case recognized that it's
impossible to specify in detail exactly what every particular
situation might be.

Speech is difficult to predict.

And all

you can do is apply it in the particular circumstances.

If

the application is an improper one, there is always a way of
correction through the appeals with a da novo hearing that is
provided under the procedural system.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERS

Mr. Barnhill.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES BARNHILL, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR, BARNHILLs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, the Government has gone to great lengths to paint
Mr. Kennedy in the most despicable posture.

I think it

important to clarify soma ©f the factual errors that have been
made in the recitation.

I will do so very briefly.

First, Mr, Kennedy’s record with the Government is
one. to be respected, not castigated.

He served with the

Government for seven years prior to this incident, received
five promotions and several commendations.

After he was

restored to his duties by order ©f the lower court and after
0E0 had submitted an affidavit which stated that his restoration

25
would cause them irreparable harm, Mr. Kennedy was given a
raise, a complimentary evaluation, and specifically complimented
QUESTION:

Where do we find that in the record?

MR. BARNHILL;
your Honor.

That is in the appendix to our brief,

We asked the Government to include that in the

joint appendix, and they refused to do so.
QUESTIONs

Are these events occurring since the

MR. BARNHILLs

They are indeed, sir.

They are, indeed.

Secondly, what the Government states as its facts
in the case are mere charges, not facts.

There was no hearing

on whether Mr. Kennedy did or did not say what h® is purported
to have said.
Actually, we responded to these charges by a series
of affidavits on the basis of support for our contention in a
now defunct second count which we have dropped.

But the facts

are the facts in the affidavits, not in the charges.

We

answered those charges, and those affidavits were never denied.
QUESTION s

Mr. Barnhill, maybe you can try to answer

the same question I asked Mr. Friedman.

You won on a motion

for summary judgment, so I take it it's conceded that as to
any material fact that is in dispute, if there was one version
by the Government and on© by your client, you have to take
the Government’s version.
MR. BARNHILLs
QUESTIONS

Right.

Were ail of the submissions of the

26
Government filed originally with its motion to dismiss before
the court on motion for summary judgment?
MR, BARNHILL:
wholly clear.

Well, to be perfectly honest, it’s not

What did happen

in this instance was that the

lower court deemed all the charges irrelevant to the proceedings.
We filed

on

a count two which we earlier filed,

a series of affidavits stating that his speech was protected.
That was dismissed.

We amended and then charged the statute

was vague and overbroad at that point.
At that point the charges became irrelevant.

I am

not sure whether the affidavits were forwarded to them or not,
to tell you the truth.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose if you take the lower

court’s view, neither side would be entitled to state any facts
since the factual background was irrelevant.

But since we might

take a different view, I suppose we have got to take the view
that what facts v/e conceive ■ to be material we would have to buy
the Government’s version since you won on a summary judgment.
MFu BARNHILL:

I think, like I say, the matter is

irrelevant, the factual charges are irrelevant.

And, second

of all, we contradict each of those facts via affidavit.
QUESTION:

Did you contradict them in the administra-

tiv© process?
MR. BARNHILL:

We did when v/e filed an answer to the

charges asking for an impartial hearing examiner and asking for

27
a hearing.

Although it is not clearly stated, we state it in

our answer that the facts were set forth inaccurately with
respect to the conversation —
QUESTIONs

You mean, you did that in a written answer

tinder section 3 of the
MR» BARNHILLs

That's right.

We said that the facts

were stated
QUESTIONs

And you just added that you wanted a

hearing,
MR, BARNHILLs
vice versa.

That's correct.

Well, it really was

Most of the answer took place in asking for a

hearing, and we answered also that the facts weren't accurately
stated.
QUESTIONS

And by affidavit?

MR, BARNHILLs
that point in time.

Mo, we did not file an affidavit at

We were waiting for a hearing.

Mr» Friedman has told you part of the story on the
suspension.

He didn't tell you all the story, and I believe

it important to tell you that story.
At a latex' hearing, after Mr, Kennedy was suspended,
the Government capitulated, gave Mr. Kennedy all his money back
and supposedly expunged that matter from the record, that
60-day suspension that they held.
Furthermore, one of the charges which was not
sustained in that suspension was the charge of leafleting with

28
the press out in the lobby.
the suspension.

That charge was not sustained in

It was later resuscitated and used as a basis

for his discharge.
With respect to the actual charges relating to the
discharge, I think I can say this:

Hr. Kennedy ~~ the facts

show that Mr. Kennedy did participate in a press conference.
He participated as a union representative with four other
unions.

He was the only one, to ioy knowledge, who was punished

for that press conference.

As I also noted, that charge was
but
not sustained in the suspension,/later brought back in the
discharge.
Second, Hr. Kennedy was accosted by a man named
James White Eagle Stewart, an Indian who had negotiations going
on with 0E0.

Mr. Stewart stated to Mr. Kennedy that Mr.

Vardine, the Regional Director, had said he would give him a
$100,000 grant if Mr. Kennedy would be implicated in some
actions which would lead to his firing.
Mr. Stsxvart said this not only to Mr, Kennedy, but to
Mrs. Laura Rockwell, to four other employees, and to the entire
union at a union meeting.

It was not Mr. Kennedy who said

tills at tha union meeting; it was Mr. Stewart himself.
Mr. Kennedy did the following tilings with this
information.
superior.

First, ha sent a night letter to Mr. Verdin©’s

He did not charge bribery? he simply alluded to the

events as he had been told.

29

Second, when a reporter called him, he mentioned the
story to the reporter, but the reporter called him firsthand
asked that the reporter check with the source of the story
before doing anything about it and help him with the investiga­
tion.
Third, he had the man who made the charges go over to
Senator Stevenson's office and fill out an affidavit.
In view of the unique situation where a supervisor,
at least the employee has reasonable cause to believe the
supervisor is out to get him, I think Hr. Kennedy acted with
remarkable restraint in his approach.
QUESTION:

Nov/, I take it from your presentation of

these facts that you intend that we should give them soma
weight.

Did you not have an opportunity before the civil

Service Commission to test these out in a full adversary
process?
HR* BARNHILL:

To be perfectly honest, your Honor,

I don't intend them to be given any weight, and I hops the
Government's facts, as they state them, are. not given any
weight.

I think they are irrelevant*

I only wanted to insure

that the fundamental —

It is still pending.

QUESTION:

You have not had that opportunity?

MR. BARNHILL;

We have not been granted that hearing,

We asked for it, but wa have not been

Since this case has started, we have not been

Is the explanation for that the pendency

MR. BARNHILL:

I have no idea of the explanation of

Some cases take this long to process, and

that is a fact which we reported in our brief.

The Government

states in their brief that the appeal is still pending.

I

know no explanation for that.
QUESTION;

Then in terms of the timing, the Civil

Service Commission procedure allows you to test out all of these
allegations pro and con in that process, does it not?
MR. BARNHILL:

In this instance, by the time h® was

restored nine months after he had been fired, he still had not

The issue is whether —

QUESTION;

MR, BARNHILL:

MR, BARNHILL:
QUESTION:

I think that's all that Goldberg gave.

And Ball against Burson,

MR,BARNHILL:

And Bell against Burson, correct.

Whan we are asking for an ability to prove that there
is no probable cause, it's through the use of the rudimentary
elements of due process.
QUESTION:
difference

Don't you think it really makes a

to what due process requiras if your object of

the procedure is to determine probable cause rather than the
actual fact?
MR. BARNHILL:

I think any kind of procedure has to

be calculated to be fair to achieve the truthful result.

You

can't achieve the truthful result if you have a system which
allows a person who is complaining witness, prosecutor and
judge to make the decision.

34
QUESTION;

Dus process permits people to be arrested

and put in jail on probable cause established by hearsay even.
MR,- BARNHILLs

I understand that, your Honor.

I

think there is a difference between a man who might commit
murder and a man who is in Government service for many years.
QUESTION!

Let's reduce it down to a man engaged in

a disorderly kind of conduct on the street or drunk on the
street.

He is picked up by the police and taken to the station.

You have the accuser and the prosecutor in the terms you are
talking about all engaged at that stage, but he goes into
custody, doesn't he?
MR. BARNHILL!

He has a right to bail, your Honor.

Our client has no right to bail.
QUESTION!

That is another question.

MR, BARNHILLs

But I think that makes a significant

difference whether one can maintain his freedom and the status
quo in the interim. Our client has no such alternative,
QUESTION!

There is no freedom question here.

You

.are analogizing freedom to continue employment.
MR, BARNHILLs

That's correct, just for a very short

tiras and for a very rudimentary expeditious hearing.
Professor Merrill who reported to the Administrative
Conference stated that almost every hearing on discharge
cases takes less than a day to adjudicate.

We don't ask for

any enlargement of the tiras it takes to fire a Federal

35
employee.

We ask merely that in the 30-day period which they

already have, he be given his rudimentary rights.
QUESTION 5

But you are saying that this probable

cause to believe the charges cannot ba carried out without a
full adversary hearing.
MR* BARNHILL ;

Without the minimal requisite set

forth in Goldberg v. Kelly,

I think no amount of process or

procedural ceremony can cure the fact that th© official is
biased against you.

And this system has no guarantee of

apparent impartiality.

Here in this instance the man who

fired him was also the man who felt himself aggrieved by the
charges and the man who marshaled th© evidence against him.
No system can. work if th.© man who is biased against the person
views tha procedure with a jaundiced eye.
Additionally, w© know of no other reliable way of
proving the truth in conflicting facts or to even get a
probable cause estimation except by cross-examination.
QUESTION;

Mr. Barnhill, under the district court's

opinion, supposing the Secretary of the Treasury wanted to
fire a scheduled employee.

Would any employee in the Treasury

Department be a possible neutral adjudicator, or would you
have to go outsid© the Treasury Department?
MR, BARNHILL;

No, you can stay within the Treasury

Department,, as I read the opinion,
QUESTION;

Even though the Secretary initiated the

36

charges,

the subordinate of the Secretary could hear them?
MR, BARNHILL:

Well, I don't think that situation

has been faced and was not considered by the lower court.
QUESTION:

How would you interpret the district

court's opinion in that hypothesis?
MR. BARNHILL:

I interpret it to b© someone not

connected with the initial decision to discharge the parson
may hear the case.
QUESTION:

Even 'though it's a subordinate?

MRv BARNHILL:

Well, it depends on how closely the

subordinate worked with th© man, I suspect.

It would be a

case-by-case analysis in something as unique as that.
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnhill, in Bell v. Burson, what w©

said was the”inquiry into fault or liability requisita to
afford the license® due process need not tak© th® form of a
full adjudication of the question of liability.” And I gather
you say her© also, this need not take th© form of full
adjudication of the merits of the charges.
MR, BARNHILL:

I agree.

QUESTION: "That adjudication can only be made in
litigation between the parties involved in the accident.

T-ha only purpose of the provision is to obtain ^security
from which to pay any judgments against the licensee resulting
from th® accident.

We hold that procedural due process will

be satisfied by an inquiry limited to the determination of

37

whether there is a reasonable possibility of judgments- in the
amount, claimed."

I take it, you would say here whether there

is a reasonable possibility of determination that the charges
are true.
MR. BARNHILLs
QUESTION;

That is correct, your Honor*.

And you would surround that with a hearing

before an independent examiner.
MR, BARNHILLS
QUESTION?

And right to confront witnesses.

based on-the evidence adduced.

And finally a decision

I might point out the latter,

there is no requirement that the decision be based on the
evidence adduced,
QUESTION;

It seems to me you haven't yet, unless I

missed it, addressed the Government's basic argument which, as
I understand it, is this;

In order for the demands of

procedural due process to become applicable, there has to be
•j

a deprivation of liberty or property.

I suppose you would

concede that if an employment of an employe© were clearly and
concededly an employment at will and it was understood when he

38

took the job that he could be fired on a moment’s notice for
any reason however arbitrary, that if he were fired at will,
there would be no deprivation of his property.

Would that be

correct?
MR. BARNHILLs
QUESTIONS

He has no expectancy.

MR. BARNHILLs
QUESTION;

That's correct.

Absolutely, your Honor.

And the Government's argument, as I under­

stand it, is that the property interest as far as there was one
involved in this Government job was measured by the provisions
of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act.
MR. BARNHILL;
QUESTION;

That is correct.

And that when the provisions of that Act

were complied with, that was the extent of his property
interest and that was all to which he was entitled.

Those

were the meets and bounds, as I say, of his tenure so to speak.
Now, you have just proceeded on the assumption, I think, that
this was a property interest that was protected by soma other
provisions, and I don't quit© think that you, as I say, have
addressed yourself to what I understand to be the Government's
argument.
MR, BARNHILL;

I will be delighted to do so right now,

your Honor.
QUESTION;

Before you get to that, I would like to

pursue on® question on Bell v. Burson that Justice Brennan

39
was asking about, Mr, Barnhill.
Now, in Bell v. Burson we were dealing with the
license to drive an automobile,
MR, BARNHILL!
QUESTION!

That’s correct*

I suppose you would agree that every

person in the United States who insets the age qualifications
and so forth is entitled absolutely to raceiva a driver’s
license.
MR, BARNHILLs
QUESTION;

If he passed certain tests.

Now, is

who meets the qualifications

every person in the United States
... entitled to have Government

employment?
MR. BARNHILL:
hers, too.

No, he has got to pass certain tests

He has got to be hired, he has to pass a probationary

period.
QUESTION:

There is a difference. You can't refuse

the automobile licens® if you pass the test, but you aren't
automatically given government employment because you pass
certain tests and meet the ag® requirements, are you?
MR. BARNHILL:

That's correct.

I think that dove­

tails with Mr. Justice Stewart's comment, and I would like t©
turn to that right now.
The question of whether or not you have a right to
public employment in the abstract is not the question we have
here.

The question vie have here is whether or not a person

40
may be fired for cause.

5 u.S.C. 7501 spates that an employee

may only be fired for cause.

I believe that that is «die

statutory entitlement to which this Court has indicated its
approval that a hearing is required in the Roth and sindermann
cases.
I also believe, and I note the Government ignored the
fact, that a host of other statutory benefits and entitlements
are given Federal employees once they earn them by passing
the probationary period.
QUESTION j

But doesn't the one have to be read

together with the procedural provisions of the Lloyd-LaFollett®
Act?
MR, BARNHILL;

No, I do not believe so.

I don't

believe it has ever been this Court's disposition to measure
property interests by the procedural protections accorded.
For example, in Goldberg v. Kelly
QUESTION?

the —

Before you get off on that, take Roth

and P^rry, which was decided just two years ago. As I recall,
Justice Stewart writing for the Court in that case said that
your claim, your property claim, has to be founded on some
provision of State law.
MR. BARNHILLS
QUESTION s
lav/.

That’s correct.

Some understanding as a result of State

So I would think that the analogous situation here is

that your claim has to be founded on what the Lloyd-LaFol1st fee

41
Act leads you to think your rights to be.
MR* BARNHILLs
not disagree with that.

Well, I think that's correct.

I do

And it seems to me that the provision

in the Lloyd-LaFollstte Act which says you may only be fired
for cause leads both the employee in the abstract at least
and the Government to believe that no one will be fired except
for cause.
Now, if those provisions, those procedural protections
are insufficient to show cause, than the procedural protections
seem to ma to fall, because it's —
QUESTION:

Even though they are part of the same Act.

MR. BARNHILL?

I understand that.

mean, that they are indivisible.

But that does not

For example, it seems to me

that the purpose of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act was to protect
Government employees from being fired arbitrarily.

If the

procedure which is kind of the tail of that Act does not assure
that fact,

and there is no evidence to the contrary, this

does not assure that an employs© will not be fired for cause,
than the procedure is defective.
QUESTION s

But the Civil Service obviously thought

the procedures were ample.
MR, BARNHILLS

That's correct, but the procedures are

not amples.
QUESTIONs

Well, if the Act said that a Government

employ©© may not be fired for cause as determined by the

42
superior writing him a letter, said that’s the end of it, if
the statute defined the property interest to that extent,
would you be making the same argument?
HR. BARNHILL:
QUESTIONs

I suppose you would.

Absolutely.

But it might be more difficult.

MR. BARNHILL:

Well, I think the for cause limitation

is a true representation of Congress’ intent that people be
fired only for cause.

If the procedures are defective and they

don't produce that result, then they must fall, it seems to me.
QUESTION:

Why don't you just say that may define

the property, but it doesn't define the liberty interest, that
the Government is arbitrarily purporting to fire him by a
finding of incompetence or
MR. BARNHILL:
QUESTION:

Dishonesty.

— or some other reason that will infringe

his right to get another job,
MR. BARNHILL:
here.

I think both interests are implicated

I think the property interest provided by the statute

and the other entitlements given by statute and Executive
Order end Mr. Kennedy's liberty.

If the Government takas its

charges as seriously as it states it does, then Mr, Kennedy
has most certainly been stigmatised in both his pursuit of other
jobs and in his standing in the community.
I think his affidavit, which is uncontradicted,
which states that that kind of discharge is a firm bar to

43

employment is in fact the result of the Government's firing
for the reasons it states.
And I would briefly allude that I think the entitlement
is there.

I think the Government’s argument is very dangerous.

For example, there is n© question that States or municipalities
may take property through their urban renewal projects, anything
else, and if the legislature were allowed to condition the
taking of this kind of property on the basis of inadequate
procedural safeguards and that somehow composed the right of
those persons, any property could be taken without due process.
The only result is that the property interest has to be
evaluated apart from and not together with the procedures,
and the procedures, if the property interest is established,
were next evaluated.
As I noted, in this particular case the procedures
are notably defective in that they do not require an impartial
examiner and they do not require cross-examination or confronta­
tion of your accusers.

In fact, th© procedures do not work.

Twenty”four percent of those fired who appeal to th© civil
Service Commission are reinstated by a subsequent hearing.
Thus 24 percent are improperly terminated under the present
procedures.

And that is a result which comes from, I believe,

tii© lack of procedural rudimentary due process.
The Government has ’their interest in the system as
it stands now.

Sevan or eight Federal agencies have another

44
system similar to what wa request.

Wo evidence was introduced,

although the Government, I assume they had the opportunity to
introduce evidence that this new proceeding would somehow
hamper it or burden it.
QUESTIONS

No evidence at all was —

You wouldn’t suggest, would you, Mr.

Barnhill, that the Government is somehow penalized because it
tries in certain areas to grant more rights than the
Constitution would necessarily demand?

You wouldn’t want that

kind of experimentation to stop, would you?
MR. BARNHILLs
QUESTION:

Absolutely not.

But I do not think —

That’s implicit in your suggestion that

they should give as much as eight of the agencies find they can
live with.
MR. BARNHILL: No, I certainly didn’t mean to make
that suggestion.-

My suggestion is only that that kind of

procedure shows that it works, the kind of system we want
works.
is

It's a simply a fact in the proof of our case.

These

no such implication as broad as that.
QUESTION:

I don’t quite see the difference between

your statement and my suggestion.
MR, BARNHILL:

But. I agree with you, your Honor, that

the privileges granted soma Government employees beyond what
the Constitution requires may not always have to ba granted
other employees.

That is not the thrust of our case, though.

Our case is briefly that the present procedures to place in

45
the .'Government would cost the Government very little.
Now, I would like to turn briefly to count two
which is the free speech count.

Our contention is very briefly

that 5 U.S.C. 7501 which states that a person may be fired
for any statement which interferes with the efficiency of the
Government is vagus and ovsrbroad.

As I read the statute and

the legislative history, this was never Congress' intent.

The

Lloyd-LaFollette Act never meant to license the Civil Service
Commission to punish persons because of their off-duty speech.
Rather, the history of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act is that the
Congress meant to stop an executive branch intrusion into the
Civil Service Employees' speech.

The fact is it was a reaction

to guiderules which punished Federal employees for criticising
their superiors.

This is precisely the case here.

This is

precisely what the Lloyd-LaFollette Act was meant to stop,
not to start.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Barnhill, if it will help you any, we

will add a few minutes.

We have taken a lot of your time and

Mr. Friedman's with questions.

W© will add a few minutes to

your argument.
MR. BARNHILLs
QUESTIONS

Six or seven, eight minutes more.

MR, BARNHILLS
QUESTIONS

Thank you, your Honor.

Thank you.

Of course, the claim that the discharge

violated the Lloyd-LaFollette * Act isn't one that you can

46

raise before the three-judge district court, is it?

Don't

you have to pursue that through the Civil Service Commission
and then appeal from the Civil Service Commission?
MR, BARNHILLs

That is correct, but I believe it is

the rule of this Court that a person who is potentially affected
or affected by a statute or regulation which regulates speech
is free to bring that matter to the Court before any adjudica­
tion of the facts of what he actually said,
what happened here.

And that * s exactly

Mr. Kennedy and a number of other QEO

employees brought this case to the Court's attention after
Mr. Kennedy was fired on the basis of this vague and overbroad
statute.
I might add that the Civil Service Commission in
reading the Lloyd-LaFollette Act to proscribe off-duty speech
«

,

has not only worked at cross-purposes to Congress’ original
intention? it has also ignored relevant judicial admonitions.
In 1968 in the case of Meehan v. Hacy, the Court stated that
the civil Service Commission should go back to drawing boards
and come up with some narrow and precise regulations.

That

invitation was never accepted, and we are left with the statute
as it stands now.
With respect to its vagueness, I can only say that
the three judges below had no difficulty in finding it an
unreliable guide to regulate speech.

Chief Judge Reynolds in

the Eastern District of Wisconsin also when faced with a

47
similar efficiency standard on a State level, had no difficulty
in finding it vague and unreliable.
Finally, the Administrative Conference of ‘the United
States has termed it an open invitation to arbitrary action.
It. seems to me that these judgments cannot be
ignored and they certainly go against the Government’s conten­
tion this standard is somehow a reliable guide to the ordinary
civil servant,
QUESTION:

Mr, Barnhill, are there any limits to

the argument you are now making?

Let’s assume, for the moment

that an employee did charge his superior falsely with accepting
a bribe.

Let's assume further, since you mentioned off-duty,

that this was done off-duty.

Would that justify the discharge,

or do you consider his right of free speech would entitle him
to do that?
MR, BARNHILL:

Well, your Honor, I am not here

concerned with what is the line-drawing element, what is the
borderline element.

What I am saying is if that kind of

somebody knowingly states a false fact serious enough about
his superior, he probably could be fired if there is a
statute of regulations narrow enough which told them that
kind of conduct would be proscribed.

You have to have some

kind of rule so an employee knows what he can say.
QUESTION:

Do you suggest that Government employees

now under the present Act and regulations do not understand

48

•that they can't charge their superiors in that way?
MR» BARNHILL:
falsely?

Cannot knowingly charge their superiors

That is not the facts of this case, your Honor.

The

facts ar© to th© contrary,
QUESTIONs

X gather what you ar® arguing, Mr. Barnhill,

is whatever may be the reach of a properly drawn statute to
reach the conduct of this fellow or someone in the hypothetical
?

Mr. Justice promulgated, following the Gooding analysis, he
has standing because this reaches more than that kind of
speeclx,
MR. BARNHILL:

That is correct, irrespective of what

he said.

I understand that that rule has not been retreated

from.

The two cases cited by the Government in their brief

dealt with conduct not speech.
QUESTION:

Gooding was not a Government employee,

was he?
MR» BARNHILL:

No, your Honor, he was not.

I do

not believe there is any distinction, though, in th© standing
of a parson to raise the case depending upon whether or not:
they are a Government employee.
restrictions.

There are, of course, other

I do not read that to be one of them,

QUESTION s

We are talking in this case now about

the procedures which lead to this interim suspension on
discharge.
MR,. BARNHILL:

Right. That's one of the issues, yes.

49
QUESTIONs

That's quite a different context from

the Gooding case, isn't it?
MRd BARNHILL:

That's correct*

But that

solely

relating to the vagueness of the statute, which is count two
in our complaint, I think 'the analysis remains th© sama as in
Gooding,
QUESTION:

More accurately the argument based on

ovarbreadth „
MR, BARNHILLs

That is correct.

Like I said, almost

everybody who has had an occasion to analyze it in any detail
has said that it is an invitation to arbitrary action.

And as

I read the Government's position in this instance, the
Government says that any speech which interferes with efficiency
in the Government is proscribed under the present statute.
That seems to sweep within it truthful criticism that may
impeda the Government's processos.
I do not believe that to be the opinion of this
Court.

I do not believe that efficiency overrides truth and

free speech.

I do not believe there is any such thing.

Finally, as I understand the Government's attack on
our speech argument, it is that Mr. Kennedy somehow is a
hard-core violator in th© terms of this Court in the Broadrick
case.

Th© Broadrick case was concerned -with conduct, not

speech,
Additionally, there is no hard core in this statute

50

to violate.

The statute is one vague anomalous statute.

There

is no series or full system of regulations which implement
this statute.

In fact, it is fair to say that there is not

one regulation that was in effect in OEO at the time this
statute was in being which implemented this statute with respect
to free speech.
The Government’s assertions that there were such
regulations depend upon the purpose clause of certain OEO
regulations and depend upon a regulation which is labeled
conduct, not speech.

And I believe it is the Government's

failure to determine the difference between conduct and speech
which causes this problem.

There is a difference, and I

believe it has been apparent.-in this case.
Thank you.
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, Mr. Barnhill.

You have about three minutes, Mr. Friedman.
REBUTTAL ORAL

OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

The specific OEO regulation which we have quoted
at pages 42 and 43 of our brief

states -that employees

should avoid any action which might result in or give the
appearance ©f

and I quote — "Affecting adversely the

confidence of the public in the integrity of OEO and the
Government."

51
While the regulation does not in terms refer to
speech, it seems to us that"action"is a broad enough phrase
and certainly I find it rather ama2ing. the suggestion there
is an absolute immunity, a Government employee can say anything
he pleases under this statute because his speech is somehow
not subject to discipline.
That is what the district court has held in this
case.
IJow, the suggestion was mad© by Mr. Justice White
that

perhaps this thing involves the denial of liberty as

distinguished from property.

I think the answer

any

liberty here is the fact that he is branded, if you want to
call that, as a man who has done bad things and it may be
difficult for him to find a job.

He can fully protect himself

on that aspect of the case, certainly, through the hearing
that will subsequently b® conducted before the Civil Service
Commission —•
QUESTION s

Why has the hearing, been delayed?

MR. FRIEDMANt

The hearing, Mr. Justice, has been

delayed because of the pendency ©f this case.

Now, I could

say that I understand, I had -this morning checked with the
Chicago office of the Civil Service Commission where the
hearing would bs held, and I was told that in fact the hearing
has been terminated because of the fact that Mr. Kennedy is
now back on the payroll.

But the hearing was delayed, but if

52
things had proceeded normally, if things had proceeded normally,
the hearing would have been held and Mr. Kennedy would have
had an opportunity to try out before the Civil Service
Commission all of these defenses which he now asserts exist
to the charges made against him.
I would just like to respond,the contention was made
that in the answer Mr. Kennedy filed to the proposed discharge
that he denied all of these facts.

That is set forth at

page 62 of the appendix, and there is no denial of the facts.
The only statement is that Mr. Kennedy is entitled to a fair
and impartial hearing prior to any adverse action being taken
against him.

The thing then summarises what Mr, Kennedy

believes the hearing should consist of and then says, "The
present adverse action procedure fails in substantial ways
to provide all of these rudimentary elements required for a
due process hearing," that therefore this proceeding is invalid,
null and void.
This is not a denial.
QUESTION:

This is not --

It does say the fourth line from the

bottom that the conversations for which he is being punished
are inaccurately set forth in the adverse action.
MR. FRIEDMANs

But that, Mr. Justice, is with respect

to the second set of charges.

That, it seems to roe, is in

response to the contention that this is a denial of his rights
of free speech.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER,;

Thank y©u, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
