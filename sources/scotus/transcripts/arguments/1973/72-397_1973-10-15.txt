PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

first this raorning in No. 72-397, BonelXi Cattle Company
against Arizona and others.
MR. Coker, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELMER C. COKER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. COKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Mr. Shumway and I are both deeply grateful to this
Court for providing us the opportunity of arguing this
matter which is of most importance not only to the State of
Arizona but its citizens.

I would like to briefly point out

on the map, which is the most recent official map published
by the Bureau of Land Management, the area along the
Colorado River.

The area we are talking about is in here

(indicating).
Q

Is that map reproduced anywhere in the record?
MR. COKER:

Q

Yes, sir.

In precisely that form?
MR. COKER:

Almost identical but on a smaller

scale, sir,
Q

On a smaller scale.
MR. COKER:

I would like to leave this in —

Q

1 wondered if that was the same map.
HR. COKERs

Very well.

For all practical purposes, yes? sir.

From the Arisona Planning Commission map, is a take off from
this as well as on the highway department map.
Thursday I received in the mail an anticus brie?
by the Cocopah Indians.
until I

Unfortunately I could not spot that

through the good offices or the United States

Attorney I obtained some solicitor’s opinion as to the location.
The Cocopah Reservation .is in this area here (indicating).
Exhibit K to the agreed statement of facts-vis a
topographical map dated 1902 and 1903 which shows the Bonelli
land in red and the Colorado River at that time.

I know it

is hard to see from there.
0

Can we have a copy of that?
MR. COKERs

Yes, sir.

These are all the others, sir.
Q

no, 1 mean do we have the submitted papers?
MR. COKER:

Yes, sir, I have sent Exhibit K.

There are only two exhibits here that the Court does not
have and that is a big map and later on an aerial photo.
Cl

Excuse me, what did you point out on Exhibit K?
MR. COKER:

The Bcnelli land which we are concerned

with here.
Q

Is it 1902?
MR. COKER:

1902, 1303, sir.

5
Q

And inhere is the river?
MR. COKERs

The river is shown about a mile to the

west.
Q

So, you think it is perfectly clear and accepted

in tills case that the land in dispute was not riparian land
in 1902?
MR. COKERi
Q

And when was -the patent on it?
MR. COKER:

Q

1910, sir.

Do you know where the land was in 19.10?
MR. COKERs

Q

And 1903.

Rot as of 1910.

With respect to the river?
MR. COKER:

We know as of 1906 when the plat of

survey was filed, which is in evidence, that it was along in
here

(indicating).
Q

When?
MR. COKER:

Q

1906.

So, you think when the patent was .issued, the land

was riparian land?
MR. COKERs

We have no way of knowing, Your

Honor; v;a tried to find out.

That is the reason we had to

submit tills all on documentary evidence.

Q

Do you think it is a vital question?
MR. COKERs

Q

Yes, I do think so.

Is there a finding on it below?

6
MPw, COKER:
0

Nc, sir.

Do you take a position?
MR. COKER:

I take the position that the title

passed by virtue of the patent in 1910 based upon the 1906
official plat of survey which showed that this was riparian
to the river.
Q

It was?
MR. COKER:

Q

But there was no finding on it?
MR. COKER;

Q

Yes,, it was.

No, sir.

Does your opponent
MR. COKER:

We do not know, 3ir.

At the time of preparing these exhibits, we were
trying to get everything we could possibly find in the way of
maps or documentary evidence that would show the location of
the river.
Q

And what is that?
MR. COKER:

This map here is Exhibit E-l and -2.

E-2 is a letter from the Regional Director of the Bureau of
Reclamation, translating this map and outlining the Colorado
River in the area we are talking about, the Bone Hi land
after channelisation, and showing where the high water mark
was immediately prior to channelization.

It says, "For

your convenience the bank of the active channel prior to
channelisation has been indicated by a red pencil."

7
Tinis is Exhibit B, which is a 1960 mosaic from
Davis Dam to an area south of the Bonelli land and which goes
into the Port Mohave Indian Reservation.

Both had a treaty

at that time as shown here,
Q

Exhibit D?
MR. COKER;

D, sir, B, D.

Yesf sir.

And that is in the agreed statement of facts.

I

don't think. Your Honor, we have extra copies, but I am going
to leave this with the Court.

This shows the Bonelli land

and it also shows very clearly on this aerial where the
Colorado River at one time flowed, back into here, some three
miles east of the present channel, down in here, back over
in here, over into Section 2 and 10 and into the Indian
reservation that I have mentioned in the brief (indicating)„
It very clearly shows what I say is the high water mark as
defined by our Supreme Court in the Bonelli decision.
This is an aerial photograph taken in January of
1972 by NASA at an altitude of 65,000 feet.

These photographs

were prepared and furnished to me by the Arizona Highway
Department from the film that they have of record.

I might

state that NASA did make flights the complete course of the
river.
Today we have the outline of the same — for the
high water mark where we believe at one time the Colorado
River flowed under the Arizona decision.

But between 1960

a
and 1972, this area has been highly developed by subdivisions *
And it is very plainly shown here.
of Bullhead City.

Also the increase in size

And it is my position and my interpretation

—■ and I believe Mr.Shumway substantially agrees •— that under
the Arizona decisions this whole area now belongs to the
State of Arizona.

Whereas, tinder the Claridge. decision it

would be a small area.
Q

In what year did the United States Engineers make

the most recent improvement that channelized —
MR. COKER:.

In 1959, sir, or I960.

That is when

they channeled this area in here.
0

And there has been no flooding since then?
MR, COKER:

Wo, sir.

And that brings up the

point I want to make.
Q

I assume you are going to tell us what the issue

is in this case and what it is about.
MR. COKER:

I have only put this out for the

purpose —

Q

That is preliminary information?
MR. COKER:

Preliminary.

The sole issue, really

the only issue, that we are involved with here is, What is
the line that the State is entitled to on a navigable stream?
And when the Federal Government comes in either through its
Corps of Engineers or Bureau of Reclamation

the Bureau

of Reclamation in this part -— and channelizes the river under

the theory of navigation and also primarily in this case to
conserve water for irrigation below.

This channelisation

has just commenced and it is going to proceed in different
areas.
My main concern is — and I think it will affect
all of us — is what is the extent, what was the purpose,
of the grant given to the States by Pollard and later on
confirmed by the Swamp Act,
Does it extend from this present channel, we will
say, clear over here some three miles distant where the river
once flowed?
*'

This river, as is pointed out, was, prior to
V

the Hoover Dam, a very violent river.

Sometimes it would

flow over here and sometimes it would flow over here,
according to the amount of silt that was carried do\*n and
automatically it would make one channel and move.

In this

particular area the movement has been steady from west to
east.

At one time maybe it did go back to the west.
But I cannot feature that it was ever the intent

to grant to the States under the Pollard decision and in
the Swamp Act the means by which to acquire large areas of
land.

The only purpose being to that grant was to protect

the public in access to the navigable stream and not to
provide large areas such as this where the river once flowed
and then become exposed.
The Arizona Court holds that the channelization

3.0
actually caused an evulsive change and did not change the
ownership of tills lend which was exposed by the channelization
in the Stata.
0

Is there any dispute between you and your friends

on the other side as to whether or not this was an evulsive
change or whether or not a man-made sudden change is evulsive?
MR. COKER:

X think we would have to agree to

that.
0

That is what I understood from reading the briefs.
MR. COKER;

And that is what happened here.

In

some of these areas hers there was no channelization because
it was already channelised.

Although at one time evidence

on the ground indicates that the river was some distance
to the east but filled up.
Q

Mr, Cchsr, in that connection do you consider

the changes with respect to this property between 1938 and
1959 were accretive or evulhive?

This was after the Hoover

Dam but before the dredging out of the channel.
MR. COKERs

Under, of course,, the Beaver case

and under the C 3, a ridge case, perhaps ifi. could be considered
as the construction of the Boulder Dam and the closing of
the gates could be considered in soma areas as an evulsive
movement.

I do not think we so treat if here.

We concede

that between the time the gates were closed in 1935 and the
channelization, that there were fingers of this river still

11
east of the Bonelli land.

We have some aerials in the file

and we should have brought some to reproduce, but they are
with the agreed statement of facts, showing the flow of the
river at that particular time which are more recent.
Q

Which is your position, that intex*im period from

the date of the Hoover Dam until the dredging of the new
channel?
MR. COKER:

As to whether the accretion or —

I am afraid I xv-ould have to say accretion, because it is
slow, and the reason it is slow is because there is so much
silt deposited between the dam and these areas, that the
f»0

river would move.

There are quite a fev/ canyons above Davis

Dam, and there is a large vrash in here, for instance.

In

flood times it comes down and carries large amounts of silt.
It might push the river clear over to the west side.

But

generally speaking the river goes eastward because your bluffs
are in here, and as it piles silt up it would form a new
channel or fingers of channels.
So, I would have to say it was an evulsive move­
ment, it was not something that happened overnight.
Q

Accretive?
MR. COKER:

Accretive, I beg your oardon.

Some places down in the Yuma area where the large
floods would come, it was considered evulsive.

You would

see the river at one point one day and a pretty good size

12
flood would come down and it would move almost overnight.

X

think we had a criminal case that involved that movement in
the Arizona Supreme Court.
The other point that I feel is of most importance
— and I have raised it in my reply brief, I raised it in
the opening brief and the reply brief — and that is that under
our peculiar circumstances on admission to the Union, we did
not come in on an absolute equal footing with the rest of
the States.

We have a very restrictive enabling Act.

And

as 1 tried to outline briefly in my reply brief, we had an
awfully tough time becoming a State.

Congress wanted us

to come join up with Hew Mexico and become joint statehood.
So, the result of our people voting that down, they did
impose upon us some very tough restrictions.

And it was due

to the fact, reading the history behind it, of some fraud
that had occurred in Mew Mexico during territorial days on
grant lands.
My position is that we do not have the benefit of
the Swamp Act specifically — we were given grants in lieu
thereof ~~ but anything in the nature of public lands or
grant lands we hold in trust under very restrictive covenants.
We disclaim in our constitution all claim and title to public
lands and Indian lands.
The effect of this decision, X earnestly submit,
does affect Indian lands and particularly the Port Mohave.

13
I mentioned in my opening brief that we could not find the
particular withdrawal orders of the Fort. Mohave.

It was

only last week that I was able to get through the Library
of Congress a copy of the two original withdrawal orders in
March 1890 and 1870, I believe it is, which created Camp
Mohave and the other fort there.

Later in 1910 and 1911

President Taft added on after the forts had been conveyed
to the Indians, added on; but nowhere in the original
withdrawal order for military purposes or the Indian withdrawal
orders is there any reservation made of the Colorado River.
And based upon our Arizona Supreme Court decision in Morgan,
which I have cited, 'without that limitation and without
reserve and the intent to reserve that river for the benefit
of the Indians, then under oar Arizona Supreme Court decisions,
part of the Indian reservation has been taken as a result
of this decision.
Q

Mr. Coker, do you have any thoughts as to why

the 1953 Act, the Submerged Lands Act was necessary?
MR. COKER;
Q

Yes, so far as your claims are concerned.
MR. COKER;

Q

Was it necessary?

Rot as far as our claims are concerned.

What is the practical result of the Arizona

decision on Bonelli's title?
MR. COKER;

Did it completely destroy it?

Completely destroyed.

The first

decision said •— well, they have got a small acreage in here.

14
in the southeast comer.

But the second decision goes

further and says prior to the closing of the gates at Hoover
Dam — and this was the line at that point, for an example.
Down here we can see how far it extended there.
Q

As I read the Solicitor General’s brief, he makes

the flat statement that changes caused by channelisation
are evulsive in nature.
MR. COKERs
Q

Do you agree with that?
MR. COKER:

Q

Yes, sir, I have to.

Do you have any authority for that statement?
MR. COKERs

Honor.

Yes, sir.

Yes, there is some authority. Your

I am sure in the Beaver case, I believe, by the 9th

Circuit mid.Claridga, X am sure, mentions that.

And, of

course, our Supreme Court said it was an evulsive change,
and therefore title did not change.
Q

And your way out of that is what?

Even if it

was an evulsive change and title did not change, you would
think the State still owned the bed of the river.
MR. COKER:
Q

That is what they claim, sir.

And that is what the Court held.

Arad you say

that this is not the kind of evulsive change that ought to
change title?
MR. COKER:

Ho, sir,

I say that the corpus, Your

Honor, of the grant to the States was to control the

15

malleable thread of that stream.

And as the stream moved,

whether evulsive or by accretion or man made, that the title
to that man-made channel, which is a servitude, for the
purpose of protecting the public"s right to access to that
navigable stream is what the intent was and not a means of
acquiring exposed land after the channel has been restored.
Q

You would make the same argument if man had

nothing to do with the change of this river?
MR. COKER;
Q

Yes, sir, I would, sir.

So, you would really overrule a substantial body

of law, X suppose.
MR. COKER;

I do not think so,

I do not think

the Court has ever clearly pointed out what the extent of
this grant is.
Q

That is my point, Your Honor.

This is the grant of title statement?
MR. COKER;

Yes, sir, under the Pollard case,

under the Pollard decision, to put them on an equal footing
with the remainder of the States.
Q

Your basic claim, I guess is

tell ma if X am

wrong --- is that what the State owns is the bed of the
stream under the high water mark, wherever the stream might
be at any given time.
MR. COKER:
Q

Yes, sir.

Period.
MR., COKER:

Period e

16
Q

let that by virtue of the grant?
MR. COKER:

By the .bollard grant, yes, sir, later

confirmed by the Swamp Act.
Q

There is no question but what the State would own

the land under the river, wherever it is.
MR. COKER;
Q

The question is whether it own3 something else.
MR. COKER:

it.

Yes, sir.

That is right, sir.

That is exactly

And do they retain ownership when it is not necessary to

exercise the power or the control over the navigable stream
for the benefit of the public?
Q

You say the cases about evulsion are really only

applicable between private parties, rather than —
MR. COKER:
Q

— rather than dealing —■
MR. COKER:

Q

I think so.

Yes, sir, evulsion and accretion.

Or applicable in determining the boundary between

two States»
MR. COKER:
Q

Yes, sir.

But not as between the State and a private party

in the circumstances of this case.
MR. COKER:

Again, in view of the peculiar nature

and restrictive covenants in our Constitution

we have two

different places in our Constitution where, if this land is
State land, the only manner in which they can lease it or

17
sgll. it is in accordance with the land grants.

That is the

reason I have said time and time again — and Mr. Shumway will
agree -- our legislature feels that they are powerless to
act here and plan to protect these people.
Q

What relevance, if any, do you think the case of

Hughes against Washington has?
MR. COKER:

I think it has a lot of relevance.

Number one is definitely we sfcablish the fact that Federal
law governs here.
Q

And you agree that it does?
MR. COKER3

Q

Yes, sir.

Do you think there is any ground after the Hughes

case to say that State law governs?
MR. COKER:

No, sir.

Mr. Shumway may have a

different viewpoint.
Q

You may remember that I had a different viewpoint

in that case.
MR. COKER:

Yes, sir, and also just compensation.

They are taking this land without paying for it.
Q

That was the view of the concurring oninion in

the Hughes case.
MR. COKER:

Yes, sir, concurrent.

The Hughes case

is identical here because all of this land came from the
Federal Government, the Santa Fe land grant.
Q

The relevance of the Hughes case depends on

18
whether it was riparian at the time of the patent.

And you

say it was.
MR. COKER;

It is presumed that it was, Your

Honor, because we tried to find same intervening evidence
between the 1906 plat upon which the Bonelii land was trans­
ferred , conveyed by the Government to Santa Fe, and the
actual date of the plat.
Of course, the law is — and I do not have it
solid, but this was under the Railroad Grant Act, I believe,
of 1365.

And this Court has held that the grant relates back

to that time, provided the railroad complied with the law,
which they did.
Q

Can you tell me just on that map there, describe

or just outline, what were the limits of the Bonelii grant
in terms of the sections and quarter sections?

Where did it

lie on that map?
MR. COKER;

Can I have just a second to look at

it?
Q

Ho, never mind then.
MR. COKER:

The Bonelii land at the time, as I

recall, was almost a complete section.

The only reason it

was not a full section was because there was a portion of
it bounded by the river on fine west at the time.
Q

If you just took the descriptions, the sections

and quarter sections, just the way the patent was described

19
and located it on the ground, would it cover all of the land
that is now in dispute?
MR. COKER:

No, sir, it would cover more land on

the Nevada side now.
Q

What?
MR. COKER:

Q

It would cover land now in Nevada.

But would it cover all the land that is now in

dispute?
MR. COKER:

Yes, sir, the patent.

And part of it

is in Nevada and there is an action pending up there by the
Nevada people.
Another question which I think is quite serious,
and I think it is time to adopt it, particularly in a case
like this, is the doctrine of sovereign estoppel.

As I

have pointed out in my brief, our State has sat back over
six years in statehood and some 40 years when the Colorado
River was declared navigable over the objections of Arizona,
and done nothing.

They have collected taxes.

They have,

and as a matter of law, Mr. Shuraway will agree, they have
agreed and approved subdivisions.
has been before the legislature.

Several times the matter
They have not legislated.

I think my time is up.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Shuraway?

Very well.

20
ORAL ARGUMENT OP DALE R. SHUMWAY, ESQ.
OH BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. SHUMWAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and raay it please

the Courts
I would like to perhaps outline a little different
view of some of these facts, because I believe the facts are
material to what we are talking about.

For the sake of

clarity in the brief or respondents, beginning at page 5,
we have inserted copies of the pertinent exhibits which we
feel will give the Court an understanding of where this
river was, where it is today.
At page 5 there is a copy of Exhibit K which was
submitted to the Court at the trial level.

It is the 1902

topographic map which had been prepared by the Geological
Survey.
Q

That is page 5 of what?
MR. SHUMWAYs

That is page 5 of the respondent’s

brief.
Q

Thank you.
MR. SHUMWAYs

This is the same map which wa3 shown

a moment ago by Mr. Coker.

It shows tries subject land being

in section 3, which is over a mile distance from the
Colorado River as it was surveyed under this topographic
map.

I would like to point out in your looking at this,

that the Colorado River in the stage that it was at the time

21

of that, survey

was a low stage.

It was not the river as .it

existed in an annual high flow stage.

For perhaps familiarity,

the Colorado River is the river that traditionally before
the days of Boulder Dam drained the watershed of the Colorado,
and when it did, it ran in the late spring and the early
summer months.

Sc, the only period of time that that river

really had a high flow stage was during that particular part
of the year.

Any other time it was a rather docile river.

It sometimes had very little water in it.

And all of the

surveys that I know anything about were done at the time
the river was low.
And so, you see, on Exhibit K — that is on page
5 of respondents * brief — and approximate location of that
low’ flow.

But you see also to the right of the subject

land a 500-foot to 550-foot contour.

And for showing it on

this big map, the 550-foot contour is clear off in this
area (indicating).

The subject land i3 the red and it is

way over here.
Q

That is the dotted line?
MR. 5HUMWAY;

That is the dotted line.

The next exhibit that 1 inserted in the respondents’
brief is at page 6»

This is a copy of the General Land Office

survey of 1906 which, for all intenta and purposes, was the
statehood survey for Arizona..

And at that time the Colorado

River had moved to a point where it had merely gone into

22

the southwest corner of the subject land.

This was 1906.

And in relation to Mr. Justice White's argument about whether
it was riparian or not, I would just say that this is the
closest date we have to determine whether it was riparian
land.

The strict doctrine of riparianship says that land

must be bordering a navigable stream, and this is not at the
closest survey we have.
Q

7vt the closest point, how distant is it?
MR. SHUMWAY:

Q

It is about a quarter of a mile.

On the other hand, at the rate at which it was

moving betiveen 1902 and 1906, it would have made the land
riparian by 1910, would it not?
MR. SHUMWAY:
Q

I would have to say I do not know.

If one assumes a steady rate of movement to the

east.
MR. SHUMWAY:

In complete candor, I would have to

say we did everything possible to determine where this
river was at a particular time.
Q

And what is the year of statehood?
MR. SHUMWAY:

Q

1912.

Is it your claim that the river covered this land

completely or that this land should be considered as part
of the river bed in 1906 say, or 1910?
MR. SHUMWAY:

Perhaps this is a good time to make

a statement of this particular problem.

I represented the

23
Stats of Arizona in the case called claridge v. The United
States»
ago.

The Supreme Court denied cert in that a few years

That case arose in the area of Blythe, California.

And if you are familiar with Blythe, the river valley is
approximately X5 to 20 miles wide.

There is no doubt that

that river has run over all of that area at some fc.ime.
Some time, prehistoric, .the river was completely across that
*

valley just as it was across this complete area here
{indicating)»
In the Clarldge decision the State of Arizona
took the position that the river bed that the State of
Arizona took title to at statehood was that total area,
wherever the river completely took the land during its high
flow stage.
Q

At any time in history, was that your position?
MR. SHUMWAYs

Yes, at any time in history, and

particularly any time subsequent to the United States being
there»
Q

Well, what was your position, at any time in

history or pre-history?
MR. SHUMWAY;
this:

Our position in that case, we said

It is most difficult for us to go bluff to bluff,

because that encompasses thousands of acres of land which is
already utilized by private owners.

But we said this is

the area of land that we ought to cover.

We ought to cover

24
the area where the river had run in times that we could
remember.

In particular, that case, in Blythe area, the

Claridge decision, it was very clear, and wa proved it by
witnesses that the river had been about 2-1/2 miles wide as

late as 1913-14, even up to 1920.
After Boulder Dam, you see, this river never has
been a natural river any more.

It is merely a conduit that

conveys water from Boulder Dam down to the irrigation projects
into the Los Angeles area, etc.

And so the river today is

not a natural river and it has not been for a long, long
time.
Q

It is just a big irrigation ditch.
MR. SHUMWAY:

It is a big irrigation ditch.

And.

so our position was this in Claridge, that we own a much
larger area.

That then begs the question of whether the

United States could convey away pieces of land like this and
thousands of other parcels up and down the river.
Q

Before statehood.
MR. SHUMWAY:

Q

Before statehood.

If you were right, they could not.
MR. SHUMWAY:

They could not, because under the

Pollard decision, they would have reserved that land for
the States to be created.
Q

And then what did the Claridge court hold?
MR, SHUMWAY:

The Claridge court held that the

25
river was not —
Q

That was the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit,

right?
MR. SHUMWAY:

Yes.

They said that you do not go

out that far, if you please, 550-foot contour on Exhibit K;
you go where the river is today.
Clarldge held.

That is basically what

You go where it is today.

Which would then

reduce us to a narrow configuration.
And so even if we are reduced to the narrow
configuration, I think we question whether Bonelli was
riparian.
Q

There is no proof that he was.
If he was, then he is right in this case under

Claridge; is that right?
MR. SHUMWAY:
Q

No.

Why not?
MR. SHUMWAY5

And I will tell you now why.

I

do not think he was right even then, because the State of
Arizona owns the bed of a navigable stream wherever it is.
And what we have in this case is the river moving from its
position in 1903 until 1906 when it was still apparently not
on the land.

Then we have the next location — and I out

that at page 9 of my brief — which is the 1960 revision of
a topographic map filed by the Office of River Control of the
Bureau of Reclamation.

And at that time, as you can see

from that exhibit, the river had inundated almost the entire

26
tract of land.

that is the last natural — if we dis­

regard Boulder Dam and its effect — this is the last natural,,
as natural as that can be.
I think we have to start from that particular
point.
Q

This is a revision of a map of what year?
MR. £HUMWAY:

It is actually a 1950, 7-1/2-minute

quadrangle sheet, published by the geologic Survey.
Q

What I am really trying to get at, when did that

condition obtain?
MR. 3HUMVJAY;

Mr. Justice Brennan, it was this

particular map that is Exhibit E-l, and the letter that is
attached to it in the abridged statement of facts says that
r

r

»#
'*

it obtained in 1952 and it was updated for the sake of: re­
channelization to 1960.

And. so immediately before the

United States went into rechannelising that, this is the
configuration of the "natural river.”
Q

Your position is that since 1906, or whenever

that last map was, that the river had moved enough that the
State of Arizona had picked up everything within these high
water mark lines on Exhibit E-l?
MR. SHUMWAY:

That is substantially correct.

I

would call your attention to page 12 of respondents' brief
which is actually a resurvey of the same thing.
Q

Then by the same token Arizona had lost title to

2?
all of the other land that the river used to cover?
MR. SHUMW&Y:

That is correct,

Wherever the river

had been over to the west,, we have lost that.

We had trans-

ferred the ownership of the bed of the new existing stream.
And why X called your attention to page 12, that is a
dependent resurvey by the Bureau of Land Management, that
is actually the survey agency, and they locate the old left
bank of the Colorado River before rechannelization.
Q

You say & dependent resurvay?
MR. SHUMWAY;

Yes, a dependent resurvey.

And

they located a little bit further —0

They purport to pick up the old markers?
MR. SHUMWAY:

X do not believe it is dependent.

I think it is a resurvey.
Q

If it is, then you have a real problem of knowing

where the land is on the ground anyway,
MR. SHUMWS.Y:
Q

It is labeled a resurvey.
MR. SHTTMWAY:

Q

It is a resurvey,

That is right, it is a resurvey.

In 1S62?
MR. SHUMWAY:

It reduces the amount of land that

is left outside the river slightly.

And so it is our

position, from those particular exhibits, that we have got
nothing more than an accretive movement of the river.

And

you secured that agreement from counsel for the petitioner,

28

that he agrees that there has been accretion , that accretion
moved the bed of the river over until it completely — except
for the 60 acres in the southeast corner,, inundated the
subject land.

And at that particular moment the State of

Arizona and Nevada owned the bed of the Colorado River, even
though it was on his land.

And there have been no taking

by anyone, except the actions of the river.

The land was at

the mercy of the river,
Sometimes I do not think the doctrine of accretion
is as sound as it ought to be.

But it is the doctrine that

is pretty well substantiated by all the law in this country.
And that doctrine of accretion includes not only the effect
upon private lands, as one of the Justices asked, but it
also carries with it the ownership of the bed of the stream.
Its effect is upon the riparian land.

Its effect is like­

wise on the bed of the stream which is owned by the States.
Q

That includes reliction, I guess?
MR. SHUMWAY:

Reliction?

Of course reliction is

the withdrawal of water, and I would have to say that
reliction is a doctrine which is similar to accretion, and
the law is the same in that regard.
Q

So, after Exhibit E-l was prepared, if the river

itself dug that channel, if nature did that, you would agree
that Bonelii recovered title to this land?
MR. SHUMWAY;

Very definitely, Mr. Justice.

29

1 would agree so»
Q

That is, if it had been a natural relictive move­

ment.
MR. SHUMWAY:
Q

Very correctly.

Or a man-made relictive movement,
MR. SHUMWAY:

Well, not so.

question of the man-made effect.

Let me get into the

There is a bunch of cases,

a body of law, which says that if accretion or reliction was
caused by soma upstream effect and it was not designed for
this particular purpose, then it is not the same — it is the
same, excuse me.
Q

It is the same.
MR. SHUMWAY:

It is the same.

case we are not talking about that.

In this particular

We are talking about a

specific act which came in to reduce the flow, to constrict
the river.
Q

That was the purpose of rechanneliration.
Right.

And it is agreed that that, while man-made,

was evulsion, correct?
MR. SHUMWAY:

That is for all the law that I can

find on it, that is tantamount to an evulsion.
Q

I think your brother conceded that,
MR. SHUMWAY:

Q

Yes.

And your claim therefore basically is that the

accretive movement to the east and southeast, under accepted
principles of law in this area, gave title to the State, to

30

that land which was under the high water mark of the river
when it was over there in the southeast.

And that that

title remained in the State after the evulsive movement to
the west and northwest created by the channelisation or the
river.

That is your argument, is it?
MR. SHUMWAY:

That is substantially it.

And the

only thing that I think remains that I want to emphasize is
this.

I think there are two real questions in this, and the

first one involves the location of the ordinary high water
mark with reference to Boulder Dam and its effect.

I am

deeply convinced that Boulder Dam took a great body of land
out of the State8s ownership by reducing the stream bed.
And X urged that in the other court and did not ever get a
chance to get to ’this Court with it, and I think it is a
matter that ought to be considered.
Q

You would have treated that as not an ordinary

accretive withdrawal?
MR. SHUMWAY:
Justice White.

Reliction, ordinary reliction, Mr.

It would have been a reliction because they

reduced the water.

And the only problem with that decision

is that it would be very effective adversely economically
on a tremendous quantity of land.

It would be a very harsh

thing, and I think the law supports it, but I have a hard
I

time following it all the way in today’s modern times and
40 years since Boulder Dam.

31
The other thing that I think this decision needs
is a real determination as to trie effect. —
Q

is that question in hare?
MR. SHUMWAY:

Yes, it is, Mr. Justice Brennan.

It came into the case through Justice Struckmeyer of the
Arizona Supreme Court.

We did not assert it because we felt

Claridge' had pretty well decided the issue? and when this
Court denied cert, we did not assert that.

But Mr. Justice

Struckmeyer brought it back in, said that is the lav/, and the
boundary ought to be somewhere out here (indicating).
Q

In which event what?
MR. SHUMWAY:

In that event, the State of Arizona

and the States of California and Nevada respectively could
own an awful lot more land that is along the borders of the
stream.
Q

Which over many years a lot of private people

thought they owned and developed and had under cultivation.
MR. SHIMWAY:
Q

That is very much correct.

Is the river here on Exhibit E-l, at that point is

it a boundary line between two States?
MR. SHUHWAY:

It is a boundary now, Mr. Justice

White, that has been established in the center of the re­
channelization ,
Q

By agreement between the States?
MR. SHUHWAY;

Yes, by a compact between the

32

States that has baen approved by Congress.
clearly at page 12«

That is shown

.tod that is the boundary now between the

States.
Q

So, the States by compact have treated the result

of the Hoover Dam as moving the boundaries of the States?
MR. 3HUMWAY;

Yes, definitely, and I do not

dispute that.
0

So the issue, is it still of significance?
MR, SHUMWAY:

It is in the fact that there are

large bodies of land that are still litigated between the
.. «

United States.

That is what Claridge was.

And there is

substantially other acreage like it.
There is also an important point before my time
runs out.

I ought to mention this.

In the rechannelization

process of the Colorado River in many places, the river has
been moved subsequent to the determination of statehood
boundary.

For example, I might say that we have taken this

river and physically moved it over here and rechannelized
it {indicating).

And there remains a bed that was abandoned,

I think there are 13 such instances from this point down to
Yuma.

Arizona and California have wondered for a long time

what to do about these.

In other words, there is land in

Arizona that belongs to California and land in California
that belongs to Arizona, which is the prior beds of the
river.

And they tire now in the process of trying to get

33

together and work out some trades which are specifically
*■

allowed under the boundary compact.
Q

That does not affect the boundary.
MR. SHUMWAY:

Q

That does not affect the boundary.

0‘ust the ownership of land, is that it?
MR. SHUMWAY:

That is correct.

And the boundary

compact specifically says that it does not affect title to
land.
Q

If there had not been the compact, the boundary

would not have changed, though.
MR. SHUMWAY:
to change.
Q

The boundary would have continued

That was the real problem.
Net if you deliberately rechannelissd the river.
MR. SHUMWAY:

That is probably correct.

Coker referred to one case.

Mr.

The earliest case in Arizona

which dealt with the accretion doctrine was the Jacobs case,
which is cited in all our briefs.
rape case.

And it happened to be a

And the involvement with the accretion and

evulsion doctrine had to do with boundary.

That was the first

time our Court ever spoke upon the doctrine of accretionevulsion.

It was a rather strange forum to get to that

subject.

But since then they have had two or three other

cases which have adopted the doctrine.
Q

Is there a specific case showing that the usual

consequences of evulsion operate in favor of the State and

34
against a private citizen in circumstances like this?
MR. S HUMWAY;

There are no cases,, Mr, Justice

White, that I know of.
Q

I do not suppose you would be here if there was

really a clear case of it.
MR, SHUMWAYs
I do not believe there are any
■ : , #
cases which say accretion and evulsion apply only to private
people.
Q

It applies to all those —
It certainly applies between States, does it not?
MR. SHUMWAY:

Yes.

It applies in all essence

where you are dealing with a navigable stream, and there is
no distinguishing.
Q

I suppose my Brother White's question is. Are

there any cases applying those doctrines to controversies
between a State and a private person?
MR. SHUMWAY:
have to think a minute.
Q

I think I have got some.

I would

They are in the brief.

With respect to the bed of a stream, and that is

this context.
MR. SHUMWAY:

Yes, I think the Oklahoma versus

Texas case and —
Q

Why is it that you think we have to reach that

question in this case?

I gather these private landowners,

who would be affected by it and you sugcest adversely very
seriously, they have not been parties to any proceeding that

35

involves this claim of mistake, have they, in this case?
Mr. SHUMWAYi

Which private parties?
f

Q

I do not know.
MR. SHUMWAY:

You said to us earlier —
I am just saying that there are other

lands up and down the river.

I do not say that they are

parties to it.
Q

But those are not here.
MR. SHUMWAY:

Q

They are not here.

BoneHi Cattle Company is here.

That is a private

landowner.
MR. SHUMWAY:

The only effect I see on it is that

there are numerous other similar acres of land that are
situated in the identical situation.
Q

And if the State prevails here, that necessarily

is going to have a bearing on these other lands.
MR. SHUMWAY:

I would hope so.

We spent about

15 years in Arizona trying to make some 1aw which would guide
us in these areas, and that is why v;e are here.
Q

Yes, but over a period of years Arizona has

acquired title to the river bed by an accretive change in
the location of the river.

And you acquired title to the

major share of Bonelli's land. MR. SHUMWAY:
Q

-j

That is correct.

And if the river had kept moving in the same way

and Bonelii land relicted, they would have acquired title to

36

it, would they not?
MR. SHUMWAY:
Q

That is correct.

But here you say that because the United States

aarns in and uncovered Bonelli8s land by a channelisation,
the State nevertheless retains title.
MR. SHUMWAY:

They uncovered the State of Arizona's

land.
Q

Which it had acquired from Bonelli.
MR. SHUMWAY:

The facts are the river had acquired

the land and that became the bed of the stream the State
owned, and at that moment Bonelli did not own it.
not own anything.

He did

And he did not get it back by the action

of the United States; that is, not submergence and re­
appearance , as has been suggested.

It is not reliction.

It is merely an evulsion, a speeded up process of changing
the channel of a river.
Q

Is that not the real issue in the case, whether

it is or is not an evulsion?
MR. SHUMWAY:

No, because all the parties have

agreed that it is an evulsion.

In fact, in the brief of

the petitioner it specifically agreed to that.
Q

Then, if the usual results follow from an evulsive

change, your opponent in a way has given away his case by
making that agreement.
MR. SHUMWAY:

I would agree that that is correct.

3*;
Q

Do you agree that there are no cases applying the

evulsion doctrine between the State'

and an individual in

these circumstances?
HR. SHUMWAY:
of.

There are only two that I can think

One is called the California case and it is cited in the

brief, I would have to dig it out.

And a marine railway

case, which is the Potomac River case, and it is also cited.
Q

Would those cases involve the bed of the stream?
MR, SHUMWAY.

This is one is the Potomac, and

it was in the area of building out from the boundary of Mary­
land, and it is not specifically on that.
0

But not the doctrine, not the bed of the stream

doctrine?
MR. SHUMWAY:
0

No.

Could I ask you one more question,

why is not —

I am sure you would say it is —- what is the argument that
the Arizona Supreme Court's decision is not binding on us,
because tills i3 wholly a matter of State law?

What is the

argument that Federal law has anything to do with this?
MR. SHUMWAY:

I am not so sure it does.

The

only reason that we joined —
Q

I would think you would argue that at the first

as a threshold question.
MR. SHUMWAY:

The reason we did not — and you

notice we joined in the petition for certiorari -- and the

38

reason we joined in it and barought it up here to try to see
if we cannot secure a stamp on this ordinary high water mark
law, is because we are concerned with where is it.

What are

we to do in Arizona with relation to other lands which may be
Federal?

Is Claridge binding on us?

Q

Where does the Federal lav/ get a hold on this sort

of a situation?

Arguably, if the land was riparian at the

time of the patent, maybe the Hughes case gives it -- gives
the ownership of that land the benefits of whatever the Federal
lav/ is about accretion and reliction.

But if it was not

riparian —
MR. SHUMWAY:

If it was not riparian, Mr. Justice

White, you are probably correct, and we should not even be
here.

But we feel that there is enough doubt that it is,

and I would admit for the sake of getting the decision that
it maybe is or was riparian in that particular time and it
still dees not make any difference because of the doctrine
of river bed ownership.
Q

There will be a lot of other land then that was

covered where thi3 problem will arise that will not have any
connection with Federal law.
MR. SHUMWAY:
Q

Exactly, very much.

If both sides agreed that this land was not

riparian at the time of the patent, would not the Arizona
Supreme Court decision as to what State law was be determina-

tive?
MR. SHUMWAY:
0

Completely.

Federal lav; would be applicable only by reason of

the Hughes decision, holding that by reason of a Federal
patent, Federal law applied to riparian land but only to
riparian land.
MR. SHUMWAY: That is correct.
Q

And the Court v;as not even unanimous about that.
MR. SHUMWAY:

And basically I think Hughes

announced as a Federal law, which is probably the same as
the common law of Arizona and the case law under two or three
decisions which have remotely considered the question.

There

were some other questions that have been discussed, basically
the one on estoppel.

I feel that I should just mention that

I do not believe that there is much there to indicate that
the State of Arizona has done anything which brings it. within
the requirements of an estoppel position.

I do not believe

we have any problems there, and I have suggested so in the
brief.
We believe that the decision of the Arizona Supreme
Court,if we are considering the land was riparian and bringing
the Federal question in to bear, should be affirmed and that
the land should belong to the State of Arizona.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Shumway.

40
Mr. Coker, you have a few minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT 3Y MR. COKER
MR. COKER;

Thank you, sir.

I just want to point

out one thing in answer to the question of Mr. Justice White.
All of this section 3, sir, at the time of the patent was
riparian, if we look at the township plat which is in evidence.
And later on after Santa Fe conveyed out to different parties,
but the Section 3 that was conveyed or patented to Santa ..
Fe by the United States was riparian to the river at that
time.
0

In the original patent?
MR. COKER;

Q

From the United States to Santa Fa?
MR. COKER;

Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

How do you know that?

Because the patent says

so?
MR. COKER;
Justice White.

Yes,sir, on this township plat, Mr.

I just outlined tha Bonelli land.

But the

whole section is described fcv lots, was riparian.

I mean,

it was conveyed.

The whola section east of the Colorado

River and bordering the Colorado River.
Q

When was the township plat?
MR. COKER;

The township plat was surveyed in

1906.
Q

But Section 3 •— ,

41

MR. COKER s * All I do is describe the Bone Hi land.
My point was that this section 3 —
0

It was a part of section 3.

Bonelli did not bake

all of section 3.
MR. COKER:
Q

No, sir, that is what I say.

And so the Bonelli land in 1906, by any map, was

not on the river.
MR. COKER:

No, sir, that is correct.

I am talking

about a parcel of section 3 at that point.
. AI have this dependent survey in the record, and I
believe there are extra copies here, which does show the old
bank of the Colorado River, the left bank, as it appeared to
be at the time of the channelization.

That in effect, I

Believe Mr»- Shumway and I agree, would show the extent of
the Claridge decision.

And that is where we get into where

ws think Federal law should apply rather than out Arizona
Supreme Court decision, which according to the Arizona
Supreme Court would go into Section 2 which is public land
over a mile to the east.
Q

You understand your Arizona Supreme Court to have

been applying State law to the exclusion of Federal law?
MR. COKER:

Yes, sir, they disregarded the Claridae

case entirely because* it had nothing to do with Arizona’s
action as against individuals and specifically ignored the
Clarldge decision, although Mr. Shumway here, who participated

in the Claridge decision, tried to urge on the Court that
perhaps that is the doctrine we should adopt.
to adopt it.

They refused

That is why I say, What is this grant?

leave out the questions of evulsion and accretion.
the grant?

Let us
What is

What was the purpose of the grant?
When that purpose no longer remains, does the grant

remain?

X think that is one of the most important parts

here.
In other words, it is not a land-grabbing method
or land grant or a land acquisition.

Specific purpose to

control access for the public to the bed of that river, stream
bed.
MR. CHIEF jaSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Coker.

Thank you, Mr. Shuinway.
The case is submitted.
