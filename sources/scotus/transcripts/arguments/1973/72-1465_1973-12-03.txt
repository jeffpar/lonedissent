Mr. Collins, you may begin whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. ERIC COLLINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. COLLINS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
First, I should like to apologize to the Court and
to draw attention to a mistake in our reply brief, an omission
at page 5, footnote 3, at the foot of page 5, which should
read "Compare United States v. Wilson, 447 F.2d 1, 3 (9th Cir.
1973) with United States v. Savage" — there is no citation -the number is, as shown, "72-3145," it is a Ninth Circuit case,
August 8, 1973, and has been cited by counsel for appellees, X
believe., in their brief.
Q
I

United States v. Savage?

MR. COLLINS;
Q

Yes, sir.

S-a-v-a-g-e?

/

MR. COLLINS;

S-a-v-a-g-e.

Q

Thank you.

Q

And that is August 8?

MR. COLLINS;
Q

August 8, 1973.

Is that in your reply brief?

MR. COLLINS:

Yes, Your Honor.

4
Your Honors, this action, under 42 USC 1983, the
Federal Civil Rights Act, was brought as a class action by two
California prison inmates, a Mr. Martinez, who has since
escaped and is still at large, and a Mr. Earley, who is the
representative of the class of all California inmates,

it

originally alleged full class or general actions on one claim
for individual relief.
Pursuant to 28 USC 2281, a three-judge federal panel
considered the general causes.

One of these causes involved

registered mail, and by a voluntary action on the part of the
Director of the Correctional System, who was then and still is
in the process of revising these various regulations, this
aspect of the postal system was made available to inmates and
that mooted the question.
There was a second cause, and that involved confiden­
tial mail from inmates to attendants.

This, too, was mooted by

the action of the California Supreme Court which, in In Re
Jordan, which is cited in the brief, interpreted California
Penal Code Section 2600 to find such a California statutory
right in the inmates.

This avoided the federal question.

The third individual claim was brought by Mr.
Martinez, and this ultimately was mooted out, so we are then
left with two general causes.

The first was an attack under

the First and Fourteenth Amendments on four California correc­
tional regulations having to do directly or indirectly with

5
inmates’ mail, inmates' personal or inmates* social mail.
And the second cause was an attack under the Fifth Amendment
and Fourteenth Amendment on access to the courts insofar as
California controlled confidential interviews between inmates
and their attorneys and assistants, too.

All these regulations

by the decisions of the three-judge federal court were found
to be and declared unconstitutional insofar as they applied
to mail or restricted access to the courts, that enforcement
was enjoined and we appealed.
In addition, the Director was ordered to submit new
regulations in accordance with the finding of fact and the
conclusions of law of the District Court.

This was done, too,

and the new regulations were ultimately approved on August 1,
1973, and are now in effect in California.
Q

No stay was sought while — during the pendency

of the appeal, 3: take it?
MR. COLLINS;
Q

I beg your pardon, sir?

California didn’t seek a stay of the court

judgment pending its appeal?
MR. COLLINS;
Q

And you were unsuccessful?

MR. COLLINS;
Q

Yes, Your Honor, we did.

We were unsuccessful in that endeavor.

Is the state willing to have the new regulations

continue in effect?
MR. COLLINS;

No, Your Honor.

6
0

You want to revert to the old ones?

MR. COLLINS:

Yes, Your Honor.

We wish the right to

follow what we consider to be correct penological concepts.
Perhaps our first point is that the appeal is properly
before this Court.

We rely upon the statute, 28 USC 1253.

This was, in the words of the statute, an interlocutory all­
final injunction of a three-judge federal panel.
Now, in the Brown shoe case, that is Brown v„ United
States, there a merger between two corporations was held to be
in violation of the Clayton Antitrust Act as a lessening of
competition.

On appeal, it was urged that the judgment was not

final because the District Court retained jurisdiction in order
to approve the plan of separation of these corporations.
Q

Mr. Collins, was there any question raised of

jurisdiction?
MR. COLLINS:

Yes, Your Honor, by the appellants —

I beg your pardon, by the appellees, the appellees appeared to
raise this question as to the prematurity.
move quickly on and state this:

However, I will

We believe we have a finding

of fact, conclusions of law, a declaration of unconstitution­
ality and an injunction.

We think we can properly appeal.

However, we submit to you that the three-judge federal
court should have abstained.

Abstention, we submit, is

appropriate and peculiarly appropriate.

Not only are the

regulations challenged and under attack, have not been

7
interpreted by the state's highest court, in our case the
California Supreme Court, it is particularly appropriate where
there is another and separate state statute which if fairly
interpreted would provide a separate and distinct state ground
which would moot the federal question.
We assert, and we submit to you, that that is our
situation.

We do have a statute, it is California Penal Code,

Section 2600.
How, in the Railroad Commission case, that Railroad
Commission v. Pullman, and in the Reetz v. Bozanich case, that
is the Alaskan constitutional case, in both of those it was
the interpretation of either a state statute or a state con­
stitution and not the regulation under attack which, fully in­
terpreted, would have mooted the federal question, and this
Court ordered abstention.
Q

Mr. Collins, this was under a federal statute,

was it not?
MR. COLLINS:

This case was indeed. Your Honor,

brought under the Federal Civil Rights -—
Q

Were any of the cases you cited brought under

that statute?
MR. COLLINS:
Act, Your Honor, no.

Not under the Federal Civil Rights
However, if any —- if under the Federal

Civil Rights Act a constitutional right is asserted, as it
must be, pursuant to Cooper v. Pate, then if there is a state

3
statute which would grant that right —
Q

I am talking about abstention.

Do you have an

abstention case involving the Civil Rights Act?
MR. COLLINS:

Off-hand, Your Honor, I have not a

specific United States Supreme Court case to which I can refer.
But I do suggest to you. that no matter what act is being en­
forced, if it is reasonable for this Court to find a state
statute which would avoid the federal question, then it should
order its lower federal courts to abstain.
Now, there are cases — I was saving, we do have a
statute.

It is California Penal Code, 2600, and it is cited

in our brief, of course.

But I would like to read just one

little section which is as follows:

"Pursuant to the pro-

vis iasis of this section, prison authorities shall have the
authority to exclude obscene publications or writings, and mail
containing information concerning where, how, or from whom such
matter may be obtained? and any matter of a character tending
to Incite murder, arson, riot, violent racism, or any other
for

of violence? and any matter concerning gambling or a

lottery."
Now this we say is the limit of the California
authority to exclude.

In In Re Harrell, at 2 Cal. 3d 675, the

California Supreme Court held that this statute, the one I
just cited, was in fact the California, inmates' bill of rights,
and that the concept of civil death had been abandoned on the

9

State of California.
We submit it could be fairly argued and fairly in­
terpreted, although I would be frank with you, it would be my
duty as representing the Director to argue to the contrary in
the appropriate state court, but nevertheless it would be fair
to argue that the only exclusion

authority of the California

director is contained in this statute.
Now, as opposed to this, in their brief appellees
argued that, because a California Senate bill, section 1419,
specifically and for the first time put into section 2600 the
right of inmates to send social mail, that therefore there is
no right statutorily in those inmates to send social mail.
This may well be.

But we point out that in that same bill,

which incidentally never became law, but in that same bill
there was an amendment which provided that the California
authority, the California correctional authority should for
the first time have specific authority to exclude writings on
the grounds they would tend to incite, and I quote, "disobedi­
ence of prison rules."

Therefore, we can argue on parity with

the appellees that absent such specific authority there is no
authority.
In short, we feel that the California Supreme Court
could fairly and easily, and cont3:ary to the position that wa
would take in that court, hold that there was indeed a
California statutory right of inmates and that the Director

10
only had the power to exclude those matters specifically re­
ferred to in California Penal Code, 2600.
Q
tions

But you don't want to keep these new regula­

do you?
MR. COLLINS;

No, Your Honor, we do not want the new

regulations.
Q
tween the two?

Well, how do you ----- what is the difference be­
Did I understand you to say the Supreme Court

could knock these old ones out?
MR. COLLINS

%

They might.

they should not, but they might.

We would argue seriously

We have argued unsuccessfully,

believe me, in our California Supreme Court before on prison
regulations.
Q

Oh, I thought you were arguing that the mistake

Was made by going to federal court, you should have gone to
state court and California agreed that they were wrong.

I

misunderstood you, I guess.
MR. COLLINS:

I see, Your Honor.

Let me restate it.

My argument is this, that a reasonable and valid argument could
be made to the California Supreme Court that all of these
regulations, wKat might be called exclusory regulations,
presently under attack was without authority and therefore
exactly like in the Railroad Commission v. Pullman case, ware
ultra vires acts.
But that case was not under a specific statute

11

which gave a federal cause of action, which this one is.
MR. COLLINS:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor, and —

And I assume you would oppose that in the Supreme

Court of California?
MR. COLLINS:
Q

Yes, I would.

Just as vigorously are you are opposing it here.

MR. COLLINS:

Just as vigorously, Your Honor, as here

I am saying it is a reasonable argument.
Your Honors, I would like to address myself to the
substantive question, and that involves the actual regulations.
Now, four of them involved mail, and they are, very briefly, as
follows:

Rule 1205

they are all in the briefs that are

before you — and this had to do

I beg your pardon, Your

Honors„
There is 1205, which had to do with contraband, and
that is any writings —■ and I will emit some things — which
are inflammatory political, racial, religious or other beliefs.
And also is subsection f. of that same rule, which includes
writings which in the judgment of the warden or superintendent
might tend to subvert prison order and discipline.
In addition, there is an actual mail regulation,
which was also attacked, which said that the inmate may not send
or receive letters that pertain to criminal activities.

This,

too, also contained this phrase, that a "lexvd, obscene, or
defamatory, and contain prison gossip or discussion of other

12
inmates,” and this aspect too was attacked.
And finally, inmate behavior which prohibited or at­
tempted to deter those who agitate, unduly complain, magnify
grievances, or behave in any way which might lead to violence.
It is about these regulations that we are talking
today.

Now, we do concede and agree that certain specific

federal constitutional rights do indeed follow an inmate inside
the prison environment.

These include, for example, the right

of access to courts, the right not to suffer cruel and unusual
punishment, and indeed perhaps the right to exercise religion.
But we ask this question, and that is do the First
Amendment rights as we popularly understand them, and that is
the right to communicate and receive ideas and to assemble for
purposes of doing so, dc these rights follow the inmate within
the prison environment?
Our first position is that these do not, and we say
with the Fifth Circuit rule in Frye v. Henderson — again, it­
is cited in our brief — that social mail is not a federal con­
stitutional right but is a matter for prison administration.
How, we say this realizing that in that event there can be no
federal burden upon us to justify the regulations if there is
no underlying federal right, and we say it because we believe
that the underpinning of those First Amendment rights does not
exist.

Q

Because they are in prison?

13

MR, COLLINS;

No, Your Honor, not because they are

in prison, although that is the resultant situation, but for
this reason:

As we understand it, the basic underpinning of

these rights on which, as Judge Learned Hand said, we stake
our all on the proposition that in a free society it is best
to expose people to a free marketplace of ideas, and our funda­
mental belief is that from this clash of beliefs, good, bad and
indifferent from this exposure, that ultimately long-term such
a free society will only choose or will choose ultimately
beliefs which will improve our awareness, increase enlighten­
ment and protect the very freedoms that permit them to choose.
Put another way, perhaps we might say that the
highest aspect of social wisdom is the long-term collective
judgment of free people.
Q

Mr. Collins, your answer to Mr. Justice Douglas'

question is yes?
MR. COLLINS:

Your Honor, the people, the persons

who have been convicted and imprisoned have selected themselves
out of such a free society.
Q

When did they do it?

MR. COLLINS:
Q

When they committed the crimes?

MR. COLLINS:
Q

By the acts ~

Yes, Your Honor.

They can still write letters.

MR. COLLINS:

Yes, indeed, Your Honor.

14
Q

Couldn31 they?

MR, COLLINS:
Q

And you couldn’t stop them, could you?

MR. COLLINS:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

You could?

MR. COLLINS:
Q

Of course you may write letters.

It would depend on the kind of letters.

You mean the man is arrested and you can stop

him from writing letters?
MR. COLLINS:
Q

Oh, no, Your Honor.

No.

Well, when did the state first get the right to

stop him from writing a letter?
MR. COLLINS:

When did it first get the right?

Your

Honor, may I approach that backwards and say it is certainly
true that it has the right to stop the writing of letters, and
of course I am excluding such letters as access to the courts
and the like.
0

Only because you have to.

MR. COLLINS:

And letters, shall we say, to the

counsel and their legislators.

Again, that is a California

statutory right, and other similar rights.

But when that per­

son is finally imprisoned within this controlled environment,
it is precisely that.
O

Then the answer is yes?

MR. COLLINS:
that

Yes, the answer is yes.

The answer is

15

Q

And the next question is why?

MR. COLLINS:

Because, Your Honor — and this is

where I digress, perhaps —•
Q

Is it because he gave it up when he committed

the crime?
MR. COLLINS:
Q

No, not — yes, yes, that's true.

He gave up his First Amendment rights when he

committed the crime?
MR. COLLINS:

He gave up these particular First

Amendment rights when he committed the crime, because the
underpinning disappeared.
Q

Did he also give up his right to a trial?

MR. COLLINS:
Q

You see, I am suggesting this •—

No, Your Honor.

Wall, why do you pick out just one right that

he loses ?
MR. COLLINS:
Q

Did he give up his right to vote?

MR. COLLINS:
Q

No, Your Honor.

He can only give up his right to write a letter?

MR. COLLINS:
this:

Because --

Yes, Your Honor, and the reason is

The basic underpinning for the right is, I believe, as

I have stated, that ultimately in a free society this .collec­
tive judgment will be made, correctly.
Q

I suppose he gave up his First Amendment right,

to free assembly at the time of his conviction, not at the time

16

he committed the crime.
MR. COLLINS:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

At the time of his conviction he could no longer

freely attend any meetings he wanted to.

I suspect there

wouldn't be any question about that, because he is put in a
cell every night.
MR. COLLINS:

That is true, Your Honor.

It is merely

a concomitance of the same thing, and we believe that these
people, when they have got into that situation, will not ulti­
mately choose correctly, as we do for a free society.
Q

Since you wrote your brief, this rather volumin­

ous federal report, the Peterson report, is coming down dealing
with this problem.

I am wondering if you have had a chance to

Ieoh at it?
MR. COLLINS:
Q

I regret not, Your Honor.

Because it seems to be largely at war with your

brief.
MR. COLLINS:
Q

Mv point is that —

It deals only with recommendations.

MR. COLLINS:

Precisely, Your Honor, and this is why

I say that we are not talking about constitutional rights.

It

may well be —Q

But the appellee is talking about constitutional

rights.
MR. COLLINS:

Yes, Your Honor.

The constitutional

17
right is when this Court delineates it.

We may well — and I

notice my white light is on, but 1 am anxious to get to one of
the points, Your Honor -- we may well have different penological
concepts, and it may well be that the appellee is right, but.
that is not the question before this Court.

The question is

are we federally compelled to follow a particular recommenda­
tion.
Q

Well, this case involves one fact, I assume, and

that is that the prison authorities here censor letters, out­
going letters.
MR. COLLINS:

They do indeed.

They do, and they

should.
Q

Under what theory?

MR. COLLINS;

Under the theory that they are control­

ling and guiding the environment of the person committed to
their care.
Q

But some of the censorship apparently relates

to criticism of the prison authorities.
MR. COLLINS:

Very well, Your Honor.

made that this is a stifling of criticism.
true.

The argument is

We say that is not

First, there is ample way in which those criticisms

can be made in a totally confidential and protected manner.

Q

They could have a riot.

MR. COLLINS:
under section 2600.

A California statutory right to do so,

We merely say this, that when it comes to

18

social mail as opposed to confidential mail, no, there is not
such a right, not a federal constitutional right»
Your Honor, I have not reached the last point,
would like to touch very quickly on it.

1

We have no objection

to search the paraprafessionals, to the contrary, but we ask is
it a federal right or is under federal compunction that
California must admit paraprafessionals with the privileges
of attendance to California prisons, especially when that class
has not yet been delineated.
Q

We think not,

Because of the fact that it isn't an identifiable

or otherwise regulated group?
MR. COLLINS:

As yet, no.

Our basic concept is this,

the person who wishes to take part in this relaxation of
security and the burden is on them to make this must have some­
thing more to lose than simply the sanctions of criminal law.
We want them to be subject to professional discipline.

Whether

the standards of conduct is higher or the standard of proof is
low, the more impartial and dispassionate peers will judge that
conduct.
Your Honor, I believe 1 only have two minutes left,
1 would like to reserve that two minutes for rebuttal.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Turner?

Very well.

19
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BENNETT TURNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. TURNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The state has argued that the District Court should
have abstained in this case on one issue only, that of male
censorship rules, but there is no basis on which that issue
could be decided on state law grounds.

There is no uncertainty

whatever about whether these rules apply to prisoners in
California.

They do.

There is no uncertainty about whether

they apply to all letters from prisoners to their family or
friends,

They do.

And there is no uncertainty that these

rules are designed to give the censoring guards absolute openended unchecked censorship power as to their contents.

These

rules were authoritatedly construed by Director Procunier in
his testimony and deposition in this case to permit the
censoring guard to fill in the blank, to find a reason that
‘he Would think would' be appropriate for rejecting any par­
ticular letter.

Director Procunier testified that that was

permissible under the rules involved in this case.
Now, under California law, under section 5058 of the
California Penal Code, the Director has complete unreviewable
authority to make and change rules and regulations for the
administration of the prisons.

There is no restriction on

that, and no state statute limits his discretion in any way.

20
Therefore, there is no state law basis for deciding
the issue of mail censorship.
Q

Mr. Turner, do vou feel there is some right of

censorship on the part of the prison authorities?
MR. TURNER:

There is no contention in this case,

Your Honor, that the prison official may not read every piece
of mail going in or out of the prison involving family and
friends of prisoners.

Even though that practice has been

abandoned by a large number of prison systems around the
country and recommended by the National Advisory Commission on
Criminal Justice Standards and. Goals, there is no contention
here that they may not read the mail.

The contention here is

limited to censoring the contents of the mail, rejecting letters
and punishing prisoners for what they say in the letters.
Q
understood.

Well, let's see if I have you then correctly
I take it you are conceding at least for purposes

of this case they have the right to read.

Do I understand you

to say that they have the right not to censor in any respect?
MR. TURNER:
Q

I am not sure I follow that, Your Honor.

I am asking you, is that your position, that

they may read but may not censor?
MR. TURNER:

We are supporting the order of the

District Court which permits the reading of all social mail,
and the rules that were approved finally by the District Court
on August 1 of this year permit the censoring of specific

contents that are deemed to present seme danger to prison
security or some other penal interest, and —
Q

Well, at this point do you concede this is proper

then for purposes of this case?
MR. TURNER:

Par the purpose of this case, yes, Your

Honor.
The appellants have raised for the first time in this
Court an issue regarding section 2600, subsection 4 of the Penal
Code, and they suggest that that statute might have something
to do with the resolution of this case, but the statute cannot
.be fairly interpreted to govern the issues presented here.
Nobody has ever before suggested that it had anything to do
with mail censorship.
Q
with you.

Let me ask you on the cenorship issue, if I may,
Are you saying that absent any California statute

defining the authority of the prison director or guidelines
that a state court could — presented with this question,
would have to do exactly what a federal court does, apply the
federa1 Constitution?
MR. TURNER:
Q

That’s right.

What about the California Constitution?

MR. TURNER:

It could apply the California Constitu­

tion, but the California courts say that under the California
equivalent, of the First Amendment, the federal precedents on
constitutionality would govern.

Q

I take it you are not making any claim that

prisoners have whole First Amendment rights?
MR. TURNER:
Q

No.

They don’t have the right of assembly in the

sense that a free person has, do they?
MR. TURNER:
Q

No, there is no contention —

They can’t call a meeting and make the director

open up all the cells and gather out in the yard for a meeting,
can they?
MR. TURNER;

Certainly not.

There is no right of

assembly in.vo3.ved in this case at all, only the right of
expression
Q

Well, 1 was just picking that as one very im­

portant right. First amendment right, which people on the out­
side have, and you concede when they go in they don’t have it?
MR. TURNER;
Q

We do, Your Honor.

.And then the question of what other First Amend­

ment rights they have lost is what is at issue here?
MR. TURNER:

There are really three kinds of First

Amendment rights involved here.
pression.

One is the right of free ex­

Another is the right of association with family and

friends on the outside.

And finally there is the right to

petition for redress of grievances.
Q

Well, how do you delimit the right of associa­

tion with family and friends?

Do you — will you flush that

out a little'?
MR» TURNER:

Well, this is the only link that many

prisoners have to the outside world at all»

Q

But how far do you claim they are entitled to

that right of association?
MR. TURNER:

Well, only to the extent that they are

allowed to maintain communicating —
Q

Visitors, have visitors at the prison?

MR. TURNER:
Q

Well, that is not involved in this case.

But 1 am not sure what you mean now when you are

saying the right of free association.
MR. TURNER:

To what extent?

Only to the extent of correspondence

with the family and friends.
0

I wouldn't have thought of that as association

when you are also talking about free expression by letters.
MR. TURNER:

Well, I think expression is the basic

part of the First Amendment, but there is also the right to
petition for redress of grievances.

I invite the Court's at­

tention to the letters that were rejected by the. prison
administrator at Folsom Prison.

They are exhibits to the

deposition of Huel Morphis, and in those letters the prisoners
were saying to their father or mother "please get me a lawyer
to deal with this problem that 1 have," and .that is the only
way that they can get to a lawyer, is to write to their family
to go out and hire them a lawyer.

So the right to petition for

1• ■

24
redress of grievances is also involved, even in the social mail
context.
Q

. Well, you really are speaking to some extent of

rights of visitation, are you not?
MR. TURNER:
Q

It is not involved at all in this case.

Aren't you talking about paralegal visitations?

MR. TURNER:

Oh, that is a separate issue.

That

would be solely for the purpose of serving as an investigator
for the lawyer.
Q

Do you concede that the prison might have reason-

'able regulations as to hours of visitation —
MR. TURNER:
Q

Yes, indeed.

and numbers of visitors?

MR. TURNER:

No doubt about it.

Getting back to section 2600, subsection 4, in order
to have anything to do with mail censorship, this statute
would have to be turned on its head.

I invite the Court’s

attention to the statute which is reproduced as Exhibit B to
the brief for appellants.
The structure of the statute is as follows;

If a

person is sentenced to imprisonment in California, all of his
civil rights are thereby suspended, and he has none.
what the statute provides.

That is

And then in the third paragraph,

the statute states that this section shall not be construed
so as to deprive such person of the following ci^il rights,

25
and then four specific civil rights are listed, and the fourth
one is the right to purchase, receive and read any and all
newspapers, periodicals and books accepted by the Post Office.
Then there is a qualification on that right giving prison
authorities the power to exclude obscene publications or
writings and — and this is the first mention of mail

and

mail containing information concerning where, how or from whom
such matter — referring to obscene publications or writings
may be obtained.
Wow, the statute thus takes away all civil rights
except for specific ones, and this mention of mail is only a
qualification and exception to an exception, if you will, and
it just doesn’t confer a general right in the prisoner not to
have his mail censored.
Even if the statute were applicable, even if the
structure of the statute were not as it is, the statute deals
only with in-coming matter and not at all with out-going
matter„

It gives the prison officials the right to exclude

certain things from the prison, but it doesn’t deal with things
that are going out.

And the issues in this case involve what

the prisoners are writing outside of the prison.

Basically,

it is the unduly complaining, the magnifying of grievances
kind of things, those apply to prisoners’ letters going out
and not going in, therefore even if the statute could be in­
terpreted the way the Deputy Attorney General would have it

26

road; it could only apply to a very small part of this case
and would not significantly alter the constitutional issue.
The Supreme Court of California, in the Harrell de­
cision, mentioned by counsel for appellants, did interpret this
subsection of the statute.
same way we do.

That court reads the statute the

In short, the issue of mail censorship could

only be decided on federal constitutional grounds and is no
basis for sending prisoners into the state prison system.
Turning to the substantive issue on mail censorship,
It is essential to focus on exactly what the District Court did
and. what .it didn’t do.

The regulations that the court invalid­

ated have to be compared with the regulations that they finally
approved on August 1st of this year, under which the state has
been operating for several months.
The new rules which were approved by the District
Court are printed in the supplement to the appendix at pages
195 and 196, and these rules give the prison officials very,
very broad authority to censor mail, in-coming and out-going,
for a whole variety of reasons.
Q

Where are you reading now, what page of the

supplement?
MR. TURNER:

The supplement to the appendix, pages

195 and 196, Your Honor.
If there is something that the state needs in adminis­
tering prisons and prisoner mail that isn't in these rules, the

27

stata hasn't said what it is, didn’t tell the District Court
what, it is, or hasn't told this Court what it is.
When yon compare the rules given final approval by
the District Court with the ones that they invalidated, you
find that the net effect of what the court below did was to
invalidate the following;

prohibiting prisoners from writing

letters in which they "unduly complain," in which they magnify
grievances, in which they express inflammatory political or
other views or beliefs which are defamatory, but that does not
mean libelous? according to the testimony of one of the mail
room officers that meant that the prison was belittling the
staff or criticising policy; and, finally, the catch-all,
letters that are "otherwise inappropriate," this is the one
that gives the censoring guards the right to fill in the blank
on the checklist with whatever reason he deems appropriate.
And of course the entire letter is rejected if any part is
objectionable.

The rest of the rules that were involved at.

the beginning of this case survived intact in substance in the
rules approved finally by the District Court, and the state
has not complained that any of these new rules leave any of
their interests unprotected.
Q

I want to see if I understand you.

Looking at

the old rules, these are the ones that is Exhibit C, are they
not —
MR. TURNER:

Yes,

28

Q

— to appellants5 brief?

MR. TURNER:
Q

Yes, sir.

I gather that the one on page vi directed to

rule 24028, that is one that did not survive, is that right?
MR. TURNER:
Q

Well, parts of it did.

The obscenity —

Have you tried to correlate anywhere in your

brief —
MR. TURNER:

Mo, they would have to be compared, and

it is not word for word.

In substance, all of — for example,

obscenity —
Q

Well, would you repeat again what you say sur­

vived and what went out?
MR. TURNER:

Well, what went out were the provisions

referring to Exhibit C, to the brief of appellants —
Q

Yes.

MR. TURNER:

— in rule D-120X, the unduly complain­

ing and magnifying grievances provisions came out.
Q

The one I have — that is the beginning of C,

1201?
MR. TURNER:
Q

All right.

MR. TURNER:
Q

Yes.

And then in 1205 —

May I ask, that means that somewhere we have

something about do not agitate —
MR. TURNER:

Or behavior which might lead to violence.

29
Q

Yes.

MR, TURNER:

The rules were enjoined, of course, only

insofar as they apply to mail.
Q

Yes.

That is what I wanted to get.

But do not

agitate, one might agitate with mail, but did that still sur­
vive , did it?
MR. TURNER:

Well, if you look at the rule finally

approved, it would ban letters containing plans for activities
in violation of institutional rules, and it is in violation of
institutional rules to agitate, so I think that would still
survive.
Q

What is the next — what about 1205?

MR. TURNER:

1205, under the contraband rule, inso­

far as it applies to mail at all, writings expressing inflam­
matory political, racial, religious or other views or beliefs
when hot in the immediate possession of the originator;.
Q

They went out?

MR. TURNER:

That went out?

Well, that went out insofar as it ap­

plies to mail.
Q

Yes „

MR. TURNER:
Q

May I ask then, what about f, 1205-f?

MR. TURNER:
Q

And then in 2402(8) , on the next page —

I think the substance of f has survived.

Has survived.

MR. TURNER:

All right.

And the first paragraph on the next page.

30

Q

Right.

MR. TURNER:

But then in 2404(8), defamatory went out,

as well as what are otherwise inappropriate.
Q

Is that it?

MR. TURNER:
Q

That's it.

Well, what does foreign natter mean in 2404, if

someone writes in Spanish, does that go out?
MR. TURNER:
Your Honor.

I don't think that is meant to he words,

I think that is substances.

They may be getting at

drugs or something of that nature.
Q

All right.

MR. TURNER:

These rules, unduly complaining and

magnifying grievances and so on, are relics of an undistinguished
past in prison administration, and they are not needed to run
any prison, as the states that have dona away with reading
mail altogether show and as the new report of the National
Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals
shows.

Indeed, the state has never said in this case that it

has any interest at all in enforcing these particular rules.
Q

D-1201, I gather, by its terms, doesn't deal in

so many words x^ith mail, it is just kind of a general canon of
behavior, isn't it?
MR, TURNER:
apply to letters.

That's correct, Your Honor, but it does

We specifically asked in the request for

admission does this apply to letters and the ansx^er x^as yes.

31
It is in the record.

And certainly the testimony of the

censoring guards was that they frequently use the unduly com­
plaining and magnifying grievances provisions to censor
criticism of them or their policies.
Q

We11, I presume it would be the last sentence of

1201 that was involved there, is 'that not so?
MR. TURNER:

That’s correct.

That would be the only

substance that —
Q

That is the part that is now superseded?

MR. TURWER:
Q

Yes.

Well, that is unduly complain and magnify

grievances of that last sentence?
MR. TURNER:

That is correct.

What ws are dealing with here is just expression, it
is not obscenity, not libel, not fighting words, we are not
talking about conduct, we are not talking about demonstrations
or circulating anything within the prison.

Moreover, this is

expression contained in letters that are addressed to corres­
pondents , people who are approved by the Department of Correc­
tions ,
We believe that the District Court’s conclusion on
the mail censorship rules was clearly correct and should be
affirmed.
Q

To understand that statement you just made, the

department — when you say people who are approved, does that

32
mean that the prisoner must provide a list of people to whom he
would like to write a letter or letters, and that list must he
approved before he may write to any of those people?
MR, TURNER:
Q

And you make no objection to this?

MR. TURNER:
Q

That is correct.

Not in this case.

Did you object to copying?

MR. TURNER:

Copying of mail?

MR. TURNER:

Yes, we did.

Q

Turning —

And was that knocked out?

MR. TURNER:

No, I am afraid it wasn’t.

Referring to

page 198 of the supplement to the appendix, under the rules
finally approved by the District Court, the officials still
'V. -•'

have the right to place in prisoner’s file not only matters
that ai:e in violation of the rules but also anything they think
<

'

.'w

is "relevant to assessment of the inmate’s rehabilitation,"
which essentially could mean anything.
Q

Well, do you think they have the right to put

into —' to copy and keep every letter that is written?
MR. TURNER:

We vigorously argued in the District

Court that they didn’t.
Q
as approved?

Well, what do you think happened under the rules
May the prison do that or not?

MR. TURNER;

Yes, they may.

33
Turning to the problem of investigators working for
lawyers, once again I want to say it is essential to focus on
exactly what the District Court did and what it didn't do and
compare the former rule that was invalidated with the rules
that were finally approved.
Q

Suppose you find each one as you are going along.

MR. TURNER:
Q

All right.

We have got page vi at the end of appellant's

brief for the old rules, is that right?
MR. TURNER:
Q

That is the old rules.

Now, where do we find the new ones?

MR. TURNER:

The new rule is at — page 198 of the

supplement to the appendix.
Q

That is B, is that right?

MR. TURNER:
Q

Yes, B. Investigators.

All right.

MR. TURNER:

Now, the former rule was an absolute

prohibition against attorneys using either law students or
paraprofessionals for the purpose of interviewing prisoners
whom they were representing or considering whether to repre­
sent.

This was true, regardless of who the prisoner was,

regardless of who the lawyer was, regardless of who the in­
vestigator was, regardless of the kind of case or the need to
use an investigator, regardless of any other possibly relevant
factor.

34
Now, after the initial decision of the District Court,
the Department of Corrections

voluntarily opened the class of

investigators to permit law students who have been certified
by the State Bar of California to serve as investigators.

The

only addition to that made by the District Court in its final
order is to authorise the use of paraprofessional persons who
had been certified as well by the. State Bar of Californici,

I\&

of this time, there is no procedure and no certification toy
the State Bar for paraprofessionals.

So the District Court

has not ordered the department to do anything that it isn't
doing voluntarily already,
Q

When you say voluntarily, Mr. Turner, do you

mean otherwise than under the compulsion of the District Court's
judgment?
MR. TURNER:

That’s right.

They were ordered to sub­

mit regulations that would permit the use of paraprofessionals
but they began voluntarily allowing law students in before they
were ever ordered to do so, months they

were ever ordered to

do so „
Q

Was it before or after the rendition of the

District Court opinion that they —
MR. TURNER:

After the opinion, and while new regula­

tions were being worked out.
The former rule that barred all use of paraprofessional assistants to

lawyers was in fact a serious obstacle to

obtaining representation for indigent prisoners»

These

prisoners can't afford either a lawyer or the services of a
state-licensed private detective.
Q

The District Court's order with reference to

these paraprofessionals is not self-executing, is it?

You in­

dicated that it is paraprofessional other than the law students
certified, a paraprof essional certified by the State Bax*, and
you say they haven't certified any yet?
MR. TURNER:
Q

That's right.

And if they don't certify any, then that remains

as some rhetoric?
MR. TURNER:
Q

That's right, an empty proraise.

Unless they mandamus the state bar,

MR. TURNER;

The State Bar of California has recom-

mended legislation this last summer, because they think it is
important to start paraprofessional use in all aspects of the
practice of law to enhance the quality of legal services and
expand the number of people that services can he rendered to.
They want to do that through paraprofessionals, so I think they
will get to it.
G

Your State Bar, that has reference to the

integrated bar, doesn't it?
MR. TURNER:
Q

Yes.

And then I notice it says "or other equivalent

legal professional body."

Would that be some voluntary bar

association?
MR. TURNER:
Q

I am not sure what is meant by that.

You do have in California some voluntary bas

associations?
MR. TURNER:
Q

Local bar associations.

Nov;, what is the constitutional right that is

involved?
MR. TURNER:

The right of access to the courts, ef­

fective access to the courts.

It is the same right that was

involved in —
Q

Now you say the state has no business saying

they want to guarantee that access through people who have a
certain degree of qualification?
MR. TURNER:

The state does have an interest, but tha

interest is certainly adequate right —
Q

Well, you just disagree with where they drew the

line?
MR. TURNER;
Q

Well, as in Johnson v. Avery —

Well, isn’t that right, you think that the state

required too much qualification for people?
MR. TURNER:

Well, what it did was exclude a lot of

people who could foe very, very helpful in —*
Q

Well, they still exclude a lot of people.

MR. TURNER:
Q

They certainly do.

But. I think, Mr. Turner, you are not —

37
MR. TURNER:
Q

Mo.

You are just defending this order with its de­

ficiencies,, whatever they may be?
MR, TURNER:
Q

But you were the plaintiffs?

MR. TURNER:
Q

That is correct.

Yes.

And you attacked this rule on the ground that

the rule was unconstitutional because it restricted access to
the courts, I take it?
MR. TURNER:
Q

That's correct.

And you agree, access to the courts can be re­

stricted to people of satisfactory qualifications?
MR. TURNER:
Q

Nell, I wouldn’t put it that way.

Would, you say that the state must allow access

through people with no qualifications?
MR. TURNER:
Q

Certainly not, but —

Well, then you say with sufficient qualifica­

tions?
MR. TURNER:
things, I fear.

Well, we are talking about two different

The prisoners have a right of access to the

courts through whatever means don’t involve any problems of
prison security.

The State Bar of California can certainly

promulgate the standards for professional conduct, and the
State Bar has —
Q

1 am talking about the prison.

May the prison

38
say we will certainly permit access to the courts for prisoners,
wa agree they have the right, but we insist that they be
through people of satisfactory qualifications?
MR. TURNER:

Well, the question is what are satis­

factory qualifications, and *—
Q

That's right.

MR. TURNER:

— in this case, the court below held

that the state didn't have any interest really in —
Q

So it is a constitutional matter, that you

think the District. Court ’was perfectly proper to disagree with
the prison authorities as to what satisfactory qualifications
Were ?
MR. TURNER:

Well, that is because the prison author-

ities didn't attempt to justify the exclusion of the people
that the District Court ordered should be let in, and the
reason for the District Court's order is because this rule made
the difference in very many cases whether a prisoner would have
legal representation or not.
In this very case, my co-counsel was requested by
a federal district judge to look into this case which had been
filed pro se by the prisoner, investigate it and consider taking
on an Uncompensated appointment.

When she tried to send a

third-year law student working closely -under her supervision
to see the prisoner and get the facts, he was barred by this
very rule and he was transferred and it happened again.

That

39
is how this issue got in this case, and it took a good while
to get this case prepared because of that rule.

But as the

record shows, in many other cases lawyers have been discouraged
from getting involved at all with representation of prisoners
because of the remoteness of prisons, they have to take days
off from their office just to go get papers signed.

They

can’t even send a messenger to get papers signed under this
rule.

They have to go in person, and that was a real handi­

cap in representing California prisoners.
Q

Well, it must be more than just getting papers

signed because that can be done by mail, couldn’t it?
MR. TURNER:

Well, it could be done by mail if the

documents didn’t have to be explained or show the prisoner
what is in them and so on.
Q

There must be some interview process involved,

in which the paraprofessional that you are talking about is
going to engage in some substantive discussion with the
prisoner.

Isn’t that true?
MR. TURNER:

Yes, it is the personal interview thing

that is the most important, but to show how far the rule goes,
it bars even going out to the prison for the person to —
Q

The old rule?

MR. TURNER:

Under the old rule.

We submit that this aspect of the case is controlled
by the Court’s decision in Johnson v. Avery, where the Court

40

struck down the jailhouse lawyer rule that prohibited prisoners
from helping each other on legal work.

Certainly if the state's

interest there, if there is a burden on the state to justify
banning jailhouse lawyers, which was not that in Johnson v.
Avery, it ought to be a heavier burden of justification where
you are talking about people who are closely supervised and
certified by attorneys.
There is no contention, been no contention in this
case that any harm would ever flow from the use of State Bar
certified law students and paraprofessionals, and for all of
these reasons, if the Court has no further questions, the
judgment should be affirmed.
Q

Well, actually it. is true, isn't it, in the very

State of California that problems have developed from what
lawyers are brought into penitentiaries?

A young man by the

name of Bingham, I think he has never been seen since, was a
lawyer.

Isn't that correct?
MR. TURNER:

I know what you refer to.

I of course

have no personal knowledge of any of those events.
Q

As contrasted with what might go in and out by

way of a prisoner petitioning a court, Johnson v. Avery situa­
tion, it is a real and not an imaginary problem with which
these regulations deal, is it not?
MR. TURNER:

Well, I think it is a real problem, but

the Attorney General has made a lot of the fact that these

41
interviews will be confidential.

That is a red herring be­

cause all interviews, all visits, social and other in
California, are confidential.
They are visually monitored.

They are not monitored at all.
A guard looks at you while you

talk to the prisoner, but nobody is listening.

That is even

true of a social visit, and it would be true of the paraprofessionals as well.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Collins, you have only one minute left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF W. ERIC COLLINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. COLLINS:

Yes, Your Honor.

First, may I say that counsel is under certain mis­
apprehensions.

To answer Justice Rehnquist, it is true we did

submit new regulations regarding law students, but that was

ing of fact and conclusions of law of the court.
Second, it is his — he is mistaken when he says that
we do not monitor any non-confidential interviews.

You mean when the man talks to his lawyer, it

MR. COLLINS:

No, not in any sense, Your Honor.

is the point, it is completely confidential.

That

That is confi-

dential.
Q

And everything else is monitored'?

MR. COLLINS:

Anything else may be.

We do not normal

ly — in that, counsel is correct, in that statement — we do
not -normally but we do occasionally and we reserve the right
to do so.

Your Honor, let me ---

Does the person know when he is being monitored?

MR. COXjLINS:

No, unless it is a confidential inter­

view, and then he knows he is not being monitored.

By confidential, you mean an interview with his

lawyer or his lawyer6 s representative?
MR, COLLINS:

Correct, Your Honor, precisely.
