Mr. Hirschkop, you may proceed when you are ready
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP J. HIRSCHKOP,
ESQ., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, HIRSCHKOP:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is clearly presented as one
of sex discrimination and the issue Joined between the two
parties as to whether or not it is sex discrimination.

And

the Fourth Circuit very clearly went to that issue also.
We submit to the Court, especially in light of the
foregoing argument, the one that Just preceded, that there is
no question of sex discrimination in this ca3e, that the only
basis for these regulations in fact is appearance,
In the course of this case, the Cohen ca3e, we had
the opportunity to depose the School Board, and we took each
deposition separately before the lawyers presently in the case
could sit down with them and chat about legal rationale or
they say other opinions and could then form opinions as to the
basis of the school regulation.
Three members of the Board and the Superintendent
believe the rate of absenteeism of a teacher increases in the

4
last four months of pregnancy, and the references are on page
4 of our brief, that I am referring to here, as to the appen­
dix references where their different testimony is found.
They all conceded, however, that they had no exper­
ience for statistics or whatever with that.

In fact, since

they terminated women at the end of the fifth month, they had
no idea what the absentee rate would be in the last three
months, the last trimester of of pregnancy.
But, in point of fact, both doctors were clear it
would be lower, if anything, in the last three months.

The

difficult months of pregnancy are the first three months.
The Superintendent and three members felt that it
would be dangerous for a pregnant woman to walk down school
halls, and climb steps.

They later or at the same time dis­

cussed the question of fire regulations.

And, indeed, a fire

marshal was put on the stand at the trial of this matter to
show that occasionally there were some fires in schools and
were fire drills.
There was some perhaps rather ludicrous

questioning

in retrospect about, "Well, what do you do abouS fat men?"
They said women who were pregnant could not fit
through narrow places.

And we said, "What dc you do about

fat men?"
And then three members of the School Board felt that
it was not good for students to see women whose pregnancy

becomes conspicuous to others, and indeed we quoted the
ludicrous language of one of them about children seeing his
teacher of eleventh grade history and thinning she may have a
watermelon in her belly,

How, that comment perhaps should not

be in a Supreme Court brief other than it was stated in testi­
mony, but it points out whet is really the basis of these
regulations.
When we say the continuity of teaching argument is
the real basis of these things as the appellee 'would have you
believe from their brief, we must submit
it is just not so.

to this Court that

They are legal arguments thought up in

retrospect.
The convincing aspect of that is on page 26 of our
brief at page 116 of the appendix, where Superintendent Kelly
in questioning by the Court, by Judge Merhige, agreed that he
had thought of that reason in retrospect at the time of the
litigation.
But for the litigation indeed, it is obvious that
would not h3ve been the reason,

QUESTION:

That is very typical, is it not, of

Equal Protection Clause litigation?
Usually when you are dealing with a State statute,
for example, you have no legislative history,

Then when the

validity of a statute is attacked as violating the Equal
Protection Clause, then the effort is made post hoc, if you

6
will# to find rational justifications to the law.

That is very

typical in Equal Protection Clause# is it not?
MR* HIRSCHKOP;

It is not unusual# Your Honor, where

it differs here —
QUESTION:

And indeed the law generally is.

If any

rational support can be found for the law, then it does not
violate the Equal Protection Clause.

That is a so-called

conventional teat.
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

Only if the Court applies the

rational basis test.
QUESTION:

Right,

MR. HIRSCHKOP:

If the compelling interest test is

applied to this case, we submit it wouldn’t ever succeed,
although we would submit it will not succeed on a rational
basis test, Your Honor.
Justice Stewart, you have to look# I think, at this
other matter that they raise# and that is the appearance,
because that is the real background of these things.
There was a question raised in the previous case,
or at least discussion# of the widespread nature of these type
of regulations# and indeed they are very widespread.

And maybe

the real importance of this case# outside of just the question
of law, of the tests to be applied under the Equal Protection
Clause, is the thousands and thousands of teachers that are
subjected to Just this type of arbitrary regulation.

T
QUESTION;
spread,

ia

Does the fact that they ere very wide-

that evidence that they are arbitrary or capri­

cious?
Would that not, if it is evidence of anything, be
that there might be some rationality behind it?
MR. HIR3CHK0P:
QUESTION;

No, air, I think not.

If you found, for example, one School

Board In the whole country that had this kind of regulation,
you would have a pretty good case going.

You and I should

suppose that it is arbitrary and capricious.

But if you have

half the School Boards In the country with these sorts of
regulations, I suppose the presumption going in would be that
there must be some sort of rationality behind it.
MR. HIRSCHXOP:

I would think not, Your Honor,

It would be a logical inference but I would say not
a legal one.

For instance, In the mixed marriage cases, there

were twenty-six States with mixed marriage laws.

In the

segregation casea there were many States with segregation
laws, and that did not lend validity to those laws.
With regard to these regulations, there Is a trend
away from them.

If there is any inference to be drawn, it is

the overwhelming weight of authority against these laws. Just
today Civil Service Commission's Bureau of Policies and
Standards has recommended against having such standards at all
in the hiring laws of the employees of the government.

8
And we cite Labor Department, Defense Department,
and other standards where these are a trend away.
In Virginia, every county had thesn at one time.
The Richmond School Board does not now have such a. policy, al­
though Enrico and the surrounding counties do,
I submit to the Court that we cannot, from the widespread nature of the laws, draw any inference at this time.
The 49 percent figure I am not sure.
be higher, In all candor,
Boards,

I should think it would

It doe3 apply to major School

And our experience in this case and a companion case

now coming up through the Fourth Circuit or class action In
Virginia indicates that practically all of the counties in
Virginia have such a regulation.
There was a question raised as to the five months
versus another time.

And it is conceded in this case that there

is nothing magical about five months, it is just that they
have to draw a specific time; so they lock on five months. It
could be four or six or seven.

The testimony was so in our

case.
QUESTION;

And when Is the notice required In

Chesterfield?
MR, HIR3CHK0P:

Well, they require it as soon as you

know, but you cannot — you must leave after the
QUESTION:

fifth month.

Yes, but when must you give notice?

MR. HIRSCHKOP:

I do not have the precise date.

I

9
will get that, Your Honor*
QUESTION:

I would think that would have a good deal

to do, that would have a good deal of bearing on the continuity
argument, itfould it not?
MR. HIRSCHKOP;
resist a notice.

It would. Your Honor, and we do not

This was raised in the prior case»

We have

no question, the School Board may ask people who have any kind
of disability which they know in advance will require them
leaving the school at one point or another, to notify the
employer.
QUESTION:

And not Just the day before.

MR. HIRSCHKOP:

Oh, yes, sir.

We have no problem with that.

That i3 not an issue

In this case.
There Is a separate issue which again points out the
arbitrariness of it on the return,.

The regulations in this

Jurisdiction, in this School Board, say that following their
pregnancy, they can return the beginning of the next year
basically.

Now, in depositions it was pointed out that they

return to a position open at the point, the time of return,
If there is a position open, plus the regulation clearly shows
they are not guaranteed return to the same job, the same
teaching position, for which they originally contracted.

And

they must file a certificate or give the school assurance that
the child will be taken care of okay,

10
And, of course, this starts smacking of the Martin
Marietta case, because men do not have to give such assurances
as to who is to care for an already born baby, which again I
think points out what they are really concerned about, is the
old-fashioned look of women and child rearing and childbirth.
We submit to the Court that the record is abundant
here, not just because of watermelons and things like that.
Your Honor, on the notice dated six months prior to the expect­
ed birth they should give notice.
QUESTION;

So, that means two months' notice, is

that it?
MR* HIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION;

Two months’ notice?

MR, HIRSCHKOP;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Two months prior to leaving?

MR. HIRSCHKOP;

Yes, sir.

Now, we have no problem with when the notice is.
They may say notice six months, the notice eight months; that
is not the problem we have in this case.

The problem essen­

tially is that there is just no reason to make women leave
work when they are perfectly capable of working, other than
these old-fashioned notions of childbirth.
QUESTION;

Were there individual employment con­

tracts in this case?
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

Yes, sir.

11
QUESTION:

Did the contracts have anything to say

about this subject?
MR. HIR3CHX0P:
try to find one.

The contracts have a clause.

I will

I do not have the exact contract here, I am

sorry. Your Honor.

But the contracts have a clause referring

to the sick leave policies.

For the purpose of the case, we

would have stipulated in the Court below that even if there
was a specific section in the contract outlining this, that
that would not be a bar.

There have been other teacher cases

with these contract provisions.

You cannot contract away

your Constitutional rights.
QUESTION:

:

•'*

You might have stipulated it, but you did
i■

/}

not, and it might have something to do with the merits of this
case, whether or not this teacher agreed in advance that this
would be a term and condition of her contract.
Do you know or do you not?
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

No, Your Honor, there is a Bection

of contract on the sick leave policies and a section of con­
tract on the School Board policies, that they will adhere to
the School Board policies.

I do not believe there was a section
.?

•

•

-

in the contract specifically on maternity leave policies,
Now, they do have in the School Board policies in
the Teachers Handbook, the maternity leave policies spelled
out specifically as we have it here, as it appears at page, I
think, 20 and 21 of our appendix.

12
We submit to the Court in this case there was
medical testimony that the woman could teach.

In this case

s

her own principal asked that she be allowed to finish out the
semester. In this case she had asked to continue first until
April 1st, which is shortly before the expected date of birth;
and later went before the School Board and asked at least
could she stay til mid-January, January 20th, I believe, when
the semester would end, 30 she could finish the semester with
her students.
They forced her to leave on December l8th, apparently
Just before the Christinas vacation, although there is nothing
in the record that would indicate they did it for that reason
alone.

The fact still remains that there is nothing in this

record to show the continuity argument.

There i3 nothing in

the record to buttress their other arguments advanced at the
time of deposition,

There is nothing to show the absentee

argument or give any truth or validity to that.

There is nothing

to show the injury argument,
Indeed, if you start comparing this to other matters
— for instance, a man with his leg in a cast Wfe a result of s
skiing accident and what have you — he certainly would not be
of any great benefit

in the middle of a fire drill, running

down a hall on crutches, but there i3 no prescription against
him.
With regard to the predictability of disabilities

13

which was raised earlier, again this is discrimination, going
after a select class, vrhich X think just lends to our position
that it is appearance that they are really concerned about,
Certainly a woman once pregnant is able to predict through
medical testimony or medical doctors can predict the exact
date of birth, but 30 can most people for cosmetic surgery
and many other things,
There is no regulation on cosmetic surgery,

A man

or a woman could make a choice that we want certain cosmetic
surgery and then pick a date and go to the School Board, take
their leave of absence, be out as long as they want In
essence.
QUESTION:

Is it not a different matter when you

are dealing with a situation like this where, as you suggest,
the terminal period is predictable and you have a predictable
situation all the way through in terms of medical testimony?
When you talk about a man with his ankle or Ills leg
in a cast, that is one isolated situation; but with a preg­
nancy, you have a whole series of consequences which are within
the range of possibilities, do you not, In terms of potential
'i

disability and limitation?
MR, HIRSCHKOP:

Yes, Your Honor,

Mr. Chief Justice, the medical evidence in this
case says basically there is no disability during the teaching
period

14
Now, the one thing that there is-, is there is a
certain anxiety, but there is nothing before this Court — and
we submit that there could be nothing — which shows that
despite the anxiety of the condition of pregnancy, it materially
interferes with the teacher’s ability to teach.
Quite the contrary, we have amicus in this case, the
National Education Association.

That is an association of

over a million members, representing teachers, who are not here
to blindly say they have got to work no matter what happens,
but have in conscience, I believe, said that education is not
hampered by teachers being in school who are pregnant, and I
think we could recognize the overwhelming number of members
that they have women teachers.
QUESTION:

Of course, we do not resolve the Consti­

tutional issue by taking a plebiscite or poll, do we?
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

No, sir, nor do our amicus to the

other side.
But, Mr. Chief Justice, we have to, I think, in this
case — the Court has to in this case, decide is what they are
representing to us, that this is really a continuity argument3
at all true; does it hold any water?
We submit it does not.

Even if you put aside the

depositions and deal with It as it is before the Court right
now, that let us look at this point on the Constitutional
framework if there is any validity to that statute.

Let us see

15

if we can find a reasonable basis»

I submit you cannot.

As

in the case before us, our teacher was terminated when it
disrupted continuity,
In fact, while they have an element in this regula­
tion that a teacher can be continued past the fifth month, if
the Superintendent determines that it is for the good of the
school system, we also have the testimony that he had in the
case that he just does not continue anybody past the fifth
month.

And this case here, in a day when there is a wide

market, lots of teachers readily available, wfte*re they terminate
a woman in December who could have finished the term and gone
right through to April,
QUESTION:

Is State action in this area to be

influenced by whether school teachers are in a buyers’ market
or a sellers* market?
MR, HIR5CHK0P:
Your Honor,

We submit that it should not be,

But their argument is buttressed by the buyers *

and sellers’ market,
QUESTION;

Five years ago, more or less, teachers

were almost Impossible to come by; is that not correct?
MR, HIRSCHKQF:

Yes, sir, in certain fields

especially,
QUESTION:

And now there may be somewhat of a surplus,

MR* HIRSCHXOP:

In practically all fields.

But, Your Honor, it is their argument that I am

16
trying to get to.

They believe that you have to have the

continuity because you might riot have a teacher available later
on,

And if you put aside whether teachers are available or not,

the whole continuity argument would fall on its face if there
are plenty of teachers available,

Either way, there is just

no question of this being a discriminatory statute if not only
looked at as applying to women teachers compared to other
teachers, but as applying to the teaching profession as com­
pared to the other professions.
I think an incident that happened in the course of
this litigation is very fruitful here.

When we showed up to

argue this case in the Fourth Circuit, Judge Young’s law clerk,
who was a District Judge sitting by designation, was in her
sixth month of pregnancy, and anticipated working through her
eighth month of pregnancy.
I\'ow, what is so important about teachers that is not
so important about law clerk3?

Or, if such & time comes as

clearly will come, when a Vfoman or more than one woman rise
to this bench, will this Court, whoever determines such regula­
tions, say you cannot sit beyond your fifth month of pregnancy?
Or

will you say that to judges on trial courts?

Or does anyone require that of court clerks here?
We believe they do not, nor does the government
require it.

Just because teachers in the unique situation

historically of the year-to-year contract is no reason they

IT
should submit to that type of discrimination which is practiced
nowhere else, whether it he in the court system, in the Civil
Service 3y3tem at this time; it is just an anachronism that
must be done away with.
Thank you,
MB. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:

Mr. Hixon?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL W. HIXON, III, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, HIXON:

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
My name is Sam Hixon, and I am here representing
the Chesterfield County School Board.
Perhaps I am taking the reverse approach to this
case, but I wish tc skip over temporarily the question of what
kind of teats should be applied in this case and move directly
to the question of what is the basis, the reasonable and
rational basis, for the Chesterfield maternity leave provision.
The School Board recognizes in these cases that
there is an educational advantage to having a teacher full­
time throughout the year, who can work with the Individual
student on an individual basis.

And it is for that reason

that the School Board requires that each individual teacher
sign a written contract at she beginning of her employment,
guaranteeing that she will be employed for a one-yesr period
of time.

This contract is a part of the record in this case.

16
By having one teacher without any interruption during
the whole course of one year, the objective of continuity in
education is accomplished*

With this in mind, and for many

reasons, the School Board recognizes that it is making the
transition from one teacher to the next as smooth and as nondisruptive as possible, by the application of the Chesterfield
maternity provision,
QUESTION:

Mr, Hixon, I could fully understand your

continuity argument if the Chesterfield County School Board
had a rule that no teacher who anticipated being pregnant during
that school year would be hired, or if you required immediate
notice as soon as the teacher knew she was pregnant.
But here it does not seem to me — you tell me why
I am mistaken in this -- that it does not make any difference
so far as your continuity argument goes, whether the teacher
leaves after four months pregnant, or after eight months
pregnant, or after eight months and three weeks pregnant, so
far as continuity goes.

Because the pregnancy is going to be,

Just by the ordinary pattern of events.

It could be any time

during the school year, and the four months could be any time
during the school year, when you take a large sample of
pregnant women teachers,
MR. HIXON;

Yes, Your Honor,

To answer that question, though, let me say first to
your initial question, that I believe that the School Board

19

could have a regulation which prohibited pregnant women from
beginning the contract term, because they knew and know at
that very point that there will be an Interruption during the
year.
QUESTION:

Whether or not it could, at least your

continuity argument would have great force in support of that
sort of regulation, which we are not faced with here.
MR. HIXON:

But this regulation has an advantage,

Your Honor, in that it requires only one affirmative act on
the part of the teacher.
She is required six months before the expected date
of delivery of her child, which is three months after she
becomes pregnant, she is required to come in at that point
and give the School Board notice; and with that one affirmative
act on her part, the School Board automatically at that point
triggers an administrative procedure for preparing for her
replacement.

They can go out at this point; they can inter­

view, they can talk to teachers, and they can offer them a
position at a fixed point in time.

That is, the termination

of the six months of the employment,
And this is very important to the School Board,
because I do not agree with what my colleague has said, that
the only purpose is to provide a replacement.

The purpose is

to provide a replacement who is well qualified, who is well
trained, and can do the job adequately.

20
And with this two months lead time, which is effec­
tively what we have, the School Board can go out and hire and
look for the most qualified teacher to come in at the end of
that six

months period of time.
Of course, the Chesterfield provision is much more

flexible than others.

It provides that the School Board can

extend past the fifth month of employment the teacher, if the
teacher so requests and the teacher ha3 the permission of her
doctor and if the School Board determines that it is in the
best Interests of the students, because this is essentially
what we are dealing with here.
Now, I have no doubt that the School Board, if the
final date of the five months period would fall on, let us say,
May 1st, and the end of the school year was May 15th, then -~
I have no doubt but that the School Board would continue her
until May 15th, because it would have accomplished the objectiv
of continuity.
But here we do not have that situation.

We had here

a situation in which Mrs. Cohen wished to teach until her
ninth month of pregnancy.

She initially requested that she

teach up until April 1st.

She later changed her mind and

decided to terminate her employment on January 19th.

But here

we have a question of where the School Board made a decision
on its own whether or not it would be better from the stand­
point of the students to continue the employment of Mrs. Cohen

21
until a date that she so specified or whether it would be
better for the student body and for the students to terminate
her employment at the Christmas recess, which I submit seems
to them to be a reasonable date for termination of employment»
The record in this case clearly justifies and supports
the rationality of that argument.

Upon Mrs, Cohen's termina­

tion, there was a replacement who was available, who the School
Board was able to go out and hire, to offer her a job on a
fixed date, that is, the day beginning after the Christmas
vacation — to offer her that position and have

her come in

and remain with the students for the rest of the year.

This

is the continuity which was accomplished by the administrative
procedure which is set up here.
The replacement was a duly qualified teacher with a
master's degree.
This is not an argument which I have contrived for
purposes of arguing to this Court or to the Fourth Circuit.
It is an argument that is clear in the record in this case.
Dr. Kelly, who is the Divisional Superintendent,
testified in the appendix at page 109 and also at page 113
why this regulation existed, and why this rule existed.

And

it is entirely in line with the continuity argument that I
have presented to this Court.

But even if it were not, the

question of whether or not the rule or regulation is to fall
or stand under the attacks under the Equal Protection Clause,

22
does not depend upon the rationality which is directed towards
that rule or regulation by a particular member of the School
Board.
It can, as this Court has said on many occasions,
come from the arguments which are made by counsel, or it can
come from the Court itself.

This Court has said that if there

is any reason which we can conceive to support this regulation,
then It should be upheld under the Equal Protection Clause.
QUESTION?

Under the School Board's rule, after

pregnancy, does the teacher have any preference for rehiring
over any other applicant for any existing vacancy?
MR. HIXON:

Yes, she does.

She will be guaranteed

re-employment not later than the beginning of the next year
from the period of time that she is placed on maternity leave.
QUESTION:

You mean the beginning of the next school
Vi

year after she is declared eligible for re-employment?
MR. HIXON:

Right, not later than that date*

If there is a position available, that they can move
her into, the regulation provides that she can be offered re­
employment at any time*
QUESTION:

And the regulation also provides —

But she is only guaranteed re-employment

as of the date of the beginning of the next tern?
MR. HIXON:
QUESTION:
MR. HIXON:

Yes, sir, not later than that date.
Or year, school year?
It is the beginning of the next school

23
year.. Your Honor.

The teacher does not lose her right to

seniority* she does not lose her right to personnel benefits*
she dees not lose her tenure.
QUESTION;

But she does not accrue seniority while

she is on leave* I take it?
MR, HIXON:

No* sir* she does not.

She only accrues seniority for the period of time
that she has actually completed.

The only thing that the school

teacher loses here is a period of employment when she loses
wages.

This is the only complaint that the school teacher can

have in this case.
In this case, the school teacher wishes really to
accomplish the best of two worlds.

It is not an attack here

by the school teachers on the maternity provision itself.

The

record in this case shows that the maternity provision was
adopted in part by school teachers who participated- women
school teachers who participated, in the rules adoption.
So, we are not really here talking about the merits
or demerits of maternity leave, because it is conceded that the
petitioner in this case wants the merits of maternity leave.
Her only objection is to one clearly defined area, and that is
'*! wish to choose the manner in which the maternity provision
Is implemented as opposed to having the School Board make this
choice."
And that is really the only issue involved in thi3

24
casei and

whether or not that precise issue is guaranteed by

the Constitution,
In addition tc this continuity argument that I have
presented here — we do not wish to not rely upon the medical
reasons which justify the regulation -- the record in this
case and also la Fleur's, are complete in the fact that there
are certain conditions that occur only in a pregnant woman,
and there are certain conditions or disorders of pregnancy that
can occur only in the last trimester, which i3 ‘perhaps one
reason why the fifth month date was picked out.
For example, toxemia, anemia, and hemorrhagic condi­
tions related to the placenta.

These are conditions that occur

only in a pregnant woman in these latter stages of her preg­
nancy.
In addition, there are obvious conditions that relate
only to a pregnant woman.

For example, she has a lack of

balance caused by the size of the foetus in the latter months
of pregnancy.

She is more subject to falling.

Her center of

gravity changes and this record shows that there is the possi­
bility that a pregnant woman will be subject to pushing and
shoving in the school,

And this record also shows that a

pregnant woman will have to visit her obstetrician thirteen
times during her pregnancy, with the more frequent visits being
in the last several months of her pregnancy.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hixon, may I ask you this question:

23

I

think the record shows there are about 1400 teachers

in the Chesterfield system.
MR. HIXON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Of whom 80 percent, approximately, are

women.
Does the record show -- I Juat do not recall -- what

percentage of that 80 percent are of childbearing age?
MR. HIXON:
Honor.

No, the record does not Bhow that, Your

The record only touches on that indirectly.

It will

reflect that at the time Mrs. Cohen applied to the School Board
in the month of December, that there were three other women
who were applying for an extension of the maternity provision
in the same month.

That is the only way in which the record

in this case reflects on the question that you have asked.
QUESTION:

Does the record show for a full school

year, for example, how many teachers ware on maternity leave?
MR. HIXON;

No, sir, the record doe3 not show. There

was no statistical data produced in the records of this case
to show or to support the contention that there' were an increase
in absences of teachers during the last trimester of their
pregnancy.

That evidence Just does not exist, except for the

fact that we do know that pregnancy in and of itself will
cause a teacher to increase her visits to her obstetrician,
which could very well lead to her absence from her teaching
chores, particularly in the last trimester that is involved

Of course, the record in this case will

situation,
QUESTION:

When pregnant you are going to the doctor,

you have mentioned that three times.

You do not have to go

to the doctor during the school period, do you?
Is there something peculiar about Chesterfield County
that they only hold doctor's services while school is in
session?
MR. HIXON:

Well, sir, the record shoW clearly in

this case, the doctor who testified here, that his normal hours
that he would accept patients would be between the hours of
nine and four o'clock In the afternoon.
QUESTION:

Are there any doctors in Chesterfield

County that have night hours?
MR, HIXON:
that, Your Honor,

I would have no idea of the answer to

I do know that the doctor who was deposed

in this case said he did not work at night and he also did not
work on weekends.

27

I also know some doctors who do not work but two
days a week,, too,
I just do not see why you put so much emphasis on
the fact that the person has to go to a doctor regularly.
MR. HIXON:

Yes, sir.
I thought it was more than three months.
It is within the last four months, Your

Honor, correct.
But I used generally — because the doctors seem to
break it up into trimesters, the first, the second, the third,
and their testimony relates only to the last trimester.
But there is nothing magic about the fifth month;
it could be the fourth month or the fifth month or the sixth
month,
QUESTION:
MR. HIXON:

It could be.

It could be.

But here we are dealing with a question of whether
or not one is reasonable —

That could be

QUESTION:

And it could be that a man Is just as fat

as a pregnant woman,
MR, HIXON:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And it could be that a man could not stand

being pushed around in a hall.
MR, HIXON:

But let me point out that we are dealing

here with a problem that exists in the Chesterfield County
School Board.

If we find out that there is another problem in

terms of conditions which are peculiar only to men or only
peculiar to all people, I think the School Board could easily
regulate that condition.
But here they are dealing with a condition which they
know exists and which they know creates a problem for them.
And does the Constitution require that they regulate
every potential condition causing a disruption in the School
Board, or does it only require that there be a rational basis,
or a reasonable basis for the regulation that we have got here?
That is the issue.
QUESTION:
rational basis,

I thought we were talking about the

I thought that was what I was talking about.

MR. HIXON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, and that is what I tried
Is it rational that if 80 percent of

pregnant women do such and such a thing, that the other 20
percent should be punished?
la that right?

29
MR. HIXOM:

I am sorry, but I do not understand the

question,
QUESTION:

You say that normally pregnant women do

this and this.
Does this record show that there are some pregnant
women who do not?
MR. HIXON:

Well, I think the School Board can very

clearly regulate and direct its regulations to a condition of
potential import and a condition of potential disruption.
The School Board need not wait until an injury occurs to a
pregnant mother in a school system during the last several
months of pregnancy in order for them to justify this rule as
being rational.

They can regulate as to potential disruptions

that may occur.
I do not say that the condition of dismption will
occur in every pregnant school teacher.
QUESTION:

Suppose the record shows that 80 percent

of the male teachers in Chesterfield County are ’’unstable on
their feet.”
Could you adopt a rule which says, "We are not hir­
ing any male teachers"?
Would that be rational?
MR. HIXON:

I would say that under those circum­

stances, if you could relate the condition of a man's insta­
bility with his ability to teach, which is a question in and

30

of itself, if you could relate that matter, I believe that a
regulation directed towards that condition after the facts that
you have given me, would be a rational and reasonable regulation,,
QUESTION:
men.

All men could be denied employment, all

I have got 60 percent and 100 percent.
Did you say that because 80 percent are unstable,

then you could adopt a resolution that no men could be hired
because 80 percent are unstable?
MR. HIXON:

I would say that if you could show that

the instability that you are talking about here would have a
direct effect on the ability of teachers, particularly men
teachers, in the school system, you could have a regulation
directed towards that.
But we do not have that here, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR, HIXQH:

I know you do not.
The kind of condition here is where 100

percent of the people affected by the rule are in fact pregnant.
And we do know one thing, that they -QUESTION:
MR. HIXON:

Are a 100 percent unable to teach?
A 100 percent are not unable to teach,

that is correct.
QUESTION:

That is ray point,

MR. HIXON:

That is correct.

-

QUESTION:
MR. HIXON:

~f.

And you do not see any problem with that?
No, sir, because I think that the rule

31

hera can be clearly justified on the basis that it accomplishes
continuity in the educational process by having an orderly
procedure for replacement of teachers who become pregnant.
There is only one person* only one class of people*
that are affected by this rule, and that ji.s pregnant women who
are at least five months pregnant and who wish to choose for
themselves what date they will terminate their employment*
rather than having the School Board terminate their employment.
And that is the only class of person that is affected by this rule.
QUESTION:

Why do you want to plan for continuity

at a certain particular ~~ why do you not wait until two weeks
before pregnancy?
MR. HIXON:
QUESTION:

Sir* I think —
You could have continuity whatever the

definite cutoff date was.
MR. HIXON:

There is no question about that.

QUESTION:

So* why do you pick five months or four

MR. HIXON:

There is one advantage to picking five

months?

months, in tiiat the elasticity provision* the additional four
months* it gives you some time to carry over the teacher, if
you believe that it is in the best interests of the School
Board that she be allowed to continue teaching for a period of
time.

For the example that I gave* May 1st, If you wanted to

32
continue her employment another several months, you could do
SO.

But I suppose that the one reason that the five month
period of time was selected was because most women would prefer
to stop teaching after their fifth month.
And I point out again that this maternity provision
provides a benefit to women in the sense that their can breach
their contract which they have entered into and they can breach
their contract without any repercussion.

So, we are dealing

here only with —
QUESTION:

But now you are dealing with a teacher who

does not look at it that way.
MR. HIXON:

Yes, sir, that is correct.

But if there

is going to be a balance drawn between the Interests of the
students and the interests of the children in having quality
education by preventing disruptions, and there is going to be
a disadvantage —

.

QUESTION:

, -h

There would not be any disruption if you

planned to have a substitute teacher come In and take over a
month before.
MR. HIXON:

That is exactly what the School Board is

trying to avoid, a substitute teacher.
They are trying to have a replacement there who is
qualified and who can remain with the school children for the
rest of the year.

Because having one teacher throughout the

33
year Is admittedly a valid educational objective, and the
District Judge in this case admitted, he said, "I will find or
I will recognize in thl3 case that it is good for education
to have one teacher there throughout the year,”
That is why we have got the one year contract.
QUESTION:
ME* HIXON:

This does not guarantee that.
It does not guarantee that but It does

go a long way towards making a transition.
QUESTION:

Maybe it guarantees it for five months

rather than for four,
MR. HIXON:

QUESTION:

What really is the objective here is to

And the other way might guarantee it for
V

*•>

eight months.
MR. HIXON:

What really Is the objective Is to do

away with the disruption, which is caused by a teacher leaving
without having given notice, and the disruption caused by not
having a replacement available who can take over at the
classroom.
That is the objective of the regulation.
QUESTION:

Mr* Hixon, does the record show whether

you need any specified lead time in locating exactly the teacher
you needed with the requisite qualifications for the particular
class to serve as the replacement?
MR, HIXON:

Nothing except the fact3 in this

34
particular case, Your Honor,
In the appendix, again at page 114, ifc shows that Dr,
Kelly testifies that he was able with this lead time in mind,
to go out and solicit and to hire a replacement teacher who he
hoped could be at least as qualified as Mrs, Cohen and who could
come in and replace her.
And other than that example as it is applied to Mrs.
Cohen, there are no statistics.

But I believe the facts as

they are found in Mrs, Cohen’s particular case are the best
justification for this regulation, because the School Board
was able to go out with this lead time and with this planning
device and with thi3 planning tool, and hire a qualified re­
placement who was available to come in right after the
Christmas recess.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hixon, if a teacher wants to get

married in March, can she come in to the Superintendent and
say, “I know I have a contract, but I want a leave of absence,
I am going to get married and I will be back in September*'?
MR, HIXON:

No, sir, I believe there are penalties

for the breach of her employment contract in the sense that
she agrees at the outset of her employment that she is going
to teach for one year, and, as I have said before, that is the
objective, to have a teacher there for the entire year.

And

I would think that under those circumstances the School 3osrd
would be justified in not offering her re-employment because

35
she has breached her contract voluntarily.
QUESTION:

I realise that this is outside of our

case, but would she have a 14th Amendment equal protection
claim that pregnant teachers get more favorable treatment than
young teachers who want to get married?
MR. HIION:

I see what you are driving at, Your

Honor, but I would not take that position, because I believe
that pregnancy is sui generis; it is a condition that is
peculiar only to women and it is a condition which I believe
that only the School Board is justified in treating different­
ly than any other condition.
And, for that reason, I don’t think that the person
you have described would have that claim.
The petitioners in this case have asserted that this
is a sex classification case.

And, of course, in our brief

we have taken the position and strongly represent to this
Court that this is not, in fact, a classification that is
based on sex for purposes of triggering the strict scrutiny
test.

We do not have here a classification which treats men

and women differently solely because of their sex who are
similarly situated.

We have a condition here, or a regulation,

that is directed toward a particular and easily definable area,
that is, pregnant women.
It is not a classification based on sex to treat
men differently in, say, their employment in the United States

36
Army where they may be required to shave off their beards.
This is not traditionally known as a classification that is
based on sex for triggering some suspect area in which the
Court will look with strict scrutiny on the classification that
is involved.

We have here a peculiar condition that should be*

and we represent to this Court, should be handled under the
traditional rational basis test.

And for the reasons that we

have set forth, particularly the continuity and the medical
conditions that exist in a woman, we would pray that the opinion
of the Fourth Circuit be sustained, be upheld.
MB, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr, Hixon,

Do you have anything further, Mr. HIrsehkop?
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

Yes, sir.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY PHILIP J. HIRSCHKOP, ESQ.
MR, HIRSCHKOP:

The Court has asked several questions

about the leave policies.
They are at page 20 and 21 of our appendix. I point
out that re-employment is not automatic but only comes after a
declaration of eligibility, which includes a certificate from
a teacher or assurance from a teacher that she is going to
care for her child or can care for her child, so that it does
not materially impair her ability to function.
As far as this leeway that teachers have, we submit
that it is not so after the fifth month.

At page 117 of the

37
appendix we have the testimony of the Superintendent that no
teacher is on hoard after the fifth month.

It is their very

experience which gives the lie to that belief* that the mere
fact it is there is that it is used.
Now, we disagree basically with the other side on
what is the issue of the case, no question about that.
All that this teacher wants, all that the women want,
who want this thing set aside, is to be treated equally with
other people.

And they are not treated equally, because they

single out this one sex related disability in terms of the
fact that when a pregnancy actually occurs a woman has to be
gone.

The rest is Just imagined.
For instance, Mr. Hixon’s argument, "Well, she is

going to go to the doctor thirteen times."
As someone recognized here in the Court, you can go
to the doctor at other times, even though the doctor who
testified does not have Saturday hours — he is only open, I
think, until 4:30.

'

Mrs. Cohen testified that is when she tried to get
there.

And we put her record before the Court in the District

Court.

She had missed two days, both related to colds.

She

had, in the five months, which part of those thirteen days
encompassed, I believe, not missed any time.
had, sc what?

But even if she

People miss time for all 3orts of things.

Could they pass a rule against a generic or race

38
related disease?
For instance* could they have a rule that people with
sickle cell anemia or the tendency to sickle cell anemia could
no longer teach In their school system?

We know that that is

basically a race related disease, and yet give people with
cancer or other diseases preferential treatment.
«

They could not, I submit to the Court, and get away
with it.
We have a law in Virginia which is cited at appendix
5 on the dismissal law which is Statewide.

£nd where there is

a disability as shown by competent medical evidence, a person
can be dismissed.

The State treats all disabilities equally.

/»nd our position in this case is that women should be treated
equally.

They have, no question, singled out one class of

persona, and I think to argue whether it is sex related is
foolishness.

It iB clearly sex related.

QUESTION:

Mr. Kirschkop, it is your primary submis­

sion, as I understand it, that the compulsory termination after
the fifth month of pregnancy is what violates the Equal Protec­
tion Clause; is that right?
It is not the notice requirement, is it?
MR. HIRSCKKOP:

Oh, no, sir.

The Court has raised it several times,

I think we

should be very clear, we do not object to the notice requirement
and, in fact, do not object to a set date requirement.

They

39
cannot fix it by law this way.

In other words, they can have

a requirement that if a person is going to suffer some dis­
ability which will force them to leave teaching during the
course of the year, that person must, as soon as they know
about It, or within some specified date prior to the disability
departure time, notify the employer -- the School Board in this
case -- and in fact even fix a departure date.
Now, that will take care of what they say they want
to go on ahead to replace a person.
is no problem with that.
class of people.

The basic problem — there

The problem is they single out one

They say, "You must give us a departure date

and no one else must."
£nd that is discrimination.
QUESTION:

You say that is also, not just the com­

pulsory departure date?

So, I guess you did not, either did

not hear my question or did not answer it accurately.
MR. HIRSCHXOP:
QUESTION:

No, sir, we have no objection --

You say the notice requirement confined

to pregnancy, I thought you said, you do not think is un~
cinstitutional.
MR. HIRSCHKOF:

We think it is

unconstitutional

if they confine it to pregnancy.
QUESTION:

Then I mistakenly understood you to say

that your objection is the compulsory termination.
MR. HIRSCHKOF:

That vie object to that when it Is

40
confined to pregnancy also,

If they had it for all people with

disabilities, as the State law has it, vjith that disability
job .related and would meet the due process requirement and
treated all people the same, men and women, female related
disabilities and male related disabilities, it would not violate
equal protection,
QUESTION:

So it is not only the compulsory separation

after the fifth month that you submit violates the Equal Pro­
tection Clause?
MR. HIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

It is not?

MR. HIRSCHKOP:

It is not that.

What we submit

violates It is the fact they limit it just to women, that they
pick out one class.
QUESTION:

What is?

MR. HIRSCHKOP:

The notice requirement and the com­

pulsory leaving requirement.

Taking the fifth month is purely

arbitrary, as the Court has recognized.
eighth month or the second month.

They could take the

They have just arbitrarily

virtually flipped a coin to get to the fifth month, as the
testimony indicates In this case.
But what we object to, Your Honor, Is that they have
singled out women for treatment that men do not rec oive.

In

this case -QUESTION:

Give me an example of another condition

41

that would predictably result In leaving the job and about
which you could give some notice.
MS, HIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION:

Cosmetic 3urgery, Your Honor.

That i3 not a condition; that is just a

choice that sometime you are going to do it.
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

But it will necessitate your being

in the hospital and being out of the job to have it done.
QUESTION:

You mean If you have planned to be away

during the school year, give notice.
MR. HIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION;

Yes.

But there is nothing inexorable about

that as there is about pregnancy.

It is quite different, in

fact, different.
MR, HIRSCHKOP:

No, sir, there are some male related

diseases that Judge Winter points out, points out in the dis­
senting opinion in the Fourth Circuit with which I am not
medically familiar.

But there are unquestionably a number of

medical conditions where you have a choice as to when you will
have an operation and you can go to the school and say, "Look,
I am going to have an operation either in six weeks or two
months or three months/'
QUESTION:

The whole point Is that when a woman is

pregnant she does not have a choice as to when that baby is
going to arrive, does she?
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

No, sir

QUESTION:

Short of an abortion or a miscarriage* and

the other thing about it is, and I guess part of the argument
is, if the woman is pregnant, the point of having her leave at
five months or four months Is that during the pregnancy she is
more likely to be away from work.
That is part of the argument.

That is not true of

cosmetic surgery.
lift. HIRSCHKOP:
We debate that.
QUESTION;

We say it is not true.

I know, but that is the argument.

MR. HIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION;

That is the argument.

Oh, yes, sir,

Give me a male related condition that is

like that.
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

I do not have one, Your Honor.

My

medical knowledge is that limited.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ilirachkop, is not at least one of the

contentions here that in addition to being gone during preg­
nancy, that the teacher herself loses some of her ability to
teach?

You say it is not material, but that is not exactly

similar to cosmetic surgery where presumably up until the night
before the operation the person has not lost any of their
customary ability.
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

Your Honor, I say it is not similar,

I say it is not true.
I say a pregnant women can teach as well as any other

43
person in the school system.
QUESTION:

Assuming you are wrong on that --

Mil. HIRSCHKOP:

Well, the doctor said we were right

in the record.
QUESTION:

I know, but assume you are wrong, the

State says you are wrong.
Mil. HIRSCHKOP:

Your Honor, they say I am wrong and

neither do the doctors say I am right, but now we look toward
the diabilities.
QUESTION:

If you are wrong, I take it you think your

case is in trouble?
MR. HIRSCHKOP;
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Then why do you not assume you are wrong

for a moment and then tell me what the argument Is.
MR. HIRSCHKOP;
that, Your Honor.

1 sometimes have difficulty with

Assuming that there is some difficulty with

a woman teaching while she is pregnant, there is equally diffi­
culty with other people teaching with broken legs, even though
they will not be gone — are you talking about the element
of the teaching itself?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. HIRSCHKOP:

There is no special regulation on

them, teaching with bad backs, teaching with he^rt impairments,
teaching with other types of impairment.
QUESTION:

Assume, as you dislike doing, of course,

44
but assume that pregnancy does impair teaching ability.
MR. HIRSCKKQP:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

The State is still disentitled Constitu­

tionally to provide for compulsory leave?
MR. HIRSCHKCP:

Yes, sir, only insofar as they single

it out from other matters.

If they would go by the State law

and say where a disability is such —
QUESTION:

You just told me you could not think of

any other male related disease — cosmetic surgery, that does
not involve any impairment.
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

It is not male related, then, but it

could be —
QUESTION:

Give me an example.

MR. HIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION:

It could be a broken leg, Your Honor.

With a broken leg you do not have the

anticipated disability long in advance.

It seems to me that

the State is arguing that pregnancy combines possible dis­
ability during the term plus an anticipated definite disability
at a given time.

And I think Justice Stewart and Justice White

have both asked if your claim is sex discriminatory, give us
an example or something else the State should have included in
this that represents all those things and that they did not,
and I have yet to hear you answer that.
MR. HIRSCHKOP:
dissenting opinion where

I can only refer you to Judge Winter’s
he does indicate some medical

45
disabilities that men suffer.

But again I point out to Your

Honor the feet that we are making an assumption that women
cannot teach during pregnancy, which the record is the opposite
of.

The record says they can teach.

Virginia's section on gynecology and obstetrics —

Merhige pointed out, delivered his own baby, Dr. Forrest.
.But the fact is the record say3 just*the contrary
assumption you would me make, Your Honor, that a woman can
teach.

And our basic problem with this is that they single

out women for special treatment that no one else does.
QUESTION:

Where do you think that Virginia could

Constitutionally draw the line?

You do not like five months

or six months.
At what point do you think they could* drew it, or do
you think they could not draw any line?
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

They could draw a line on notice,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

No, I am talking about the other —

46
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

Terminetion?

Well, according to the

medical testimony here they could not draw the line.

It would

be up to the person, as in any other situation, to say that
they can teach until such time es they can no longer adequately
carry out their duties.
If they had a regulation that a person who apparently
could not carry out their duties because of an impending
disability — pregnancy would be one of the obvious impending
disabilities — would have to give notice and then, in fact,
would have to present a medical certificate or submit to the
examination of a school doctor, that would be Reasonable if it
was applied across the board.
The main problem here is that they have picked out
Just one thing to harp on, which is unconstitutional, Your

QUESTION:

Mr. Hirscftkop, as I recall, the record

in the Cleveland case which you had argued here, at any given
time there are about 10 to 12 percent of the women in the
system of childbearing age who are out on maternity leave.
Gan you think of any other cause of disability or

48
continued absence that would produce a leave as of any given
date of that magnitude such a3 cosmetic surgery, for example?
ME. HIRSCHKOP:

Not a surgical type leave, which

would require an operation.
QUESTION:

Can you think of any?

MR. HIRSCHKOP:

Of course, the statistics on absen­

teeism itself from the Labor Department had pregnancy as one of
the lower cBuses, but it did not include the actual period the
woman was gone for the birth itself.
