MR.

chief

JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hearguments first

this morning in No. 72-1289, National Railroad Passenger
Corporation, et al., v. National Association of Railroad
Passengers,
Mr. Prettyman, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. BARRETT PRETTYMAN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PRETTYMAN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

I am Barrett Prettyman, and I represent the

petitioners in this case, which is here on certiorari from the
D. C. Circuit.
The case presents a rather narrow question, namely
which parties can sue for alleged violations of the Rail
Passenger Service Act of 1970, the AMTRAK Act.

We claim,

-petitioners claim that under the statutory language and pur­
suant to the congressional intent, only the Attorney General
and, where a labor agreement is involved, employees and their
representatives can sue for these alleged violations.
The respondent, which is an association of railroad
passengers, claims that anyone who is injured and aggrieved
by an alleged violation of the Act can bring suit in federal
district court.

That really is the only issue before the

Court this morning.

4
Before 1 go into the facts of the immediate case, I
would like to give you just a brief background of the Act it­
self because it bears on the problem*

This Act was passed

because of a genuine concern on behalf of the Congress and the
people that all

intercity passenger traffic in this country

was going to disappear.

In 1929, there were 20,000 passenger

trains in this country, and by 1970 there were only 360.

The

plain, hard, cold fact of the matter is that the passengers in
this country simply could not pay the high cost of operating
these trains.
At the same time. Congress, in passing the Act, did
not intend to stop all discontinuances of trains.
contrary, it recognized that some additional

Quite to the

paring was in

order if any rail passenger traffic was going to be preserved.
Q

P-a-r~i~n-g or p-a-i-r-i-n-g?

MR. PRETTYMAN;
Q

Cutting down.

MR. PRETTYMAN:
sir.

Paring, p-a-r-i-n-g, sir.

Borne additional cutting down, yes,

Therefore, Congress devised a rather elaborate plan, the

purpose of which was, instead of the individual railroads
hereafter deciding which train and when it was going to submit
to the ICC for paring down, instead the Secretary of Transpor­
tation would construct a basic system of passenger service,
the minimum system that the country should have, and that would
consist, therefore, of all the central service which hopefully

would be preserved.

And a corporation was formed, AMTRAK,

which was given power to enter into contracts with the various
railroads and take over their passenger service, to be funded
by government funds, tickets and the railroads themselves
paying entry fees.

The corporation, AMTRAK, would operate

this basic system and would either operate or discontinue the
excess service above the basic system.
I would like to emphasize again now that the purpose
of the Act was not to preserve all passenger service but,
rather, in the words of the House report, to effect a rational
reduction of present service in order to save any passenger
service.
When the Act became effective, the Secretary of
Transportation did designate the basic system, 21 city pairs,
with 42 trains running daily as part of the basic system.

As

it developed, whan AMTRAK took over passenger service, it
actually operated originally some 180 passenger trains, and

.

today that is up to 198

The Central of Georgia's only remaining passenger
trains just prior to the passage of this Act were the Nancy
Hanks, between Savannah and Atlanta, and Trains 13 and 14
between Albany, Georgia and Birmingham, and these trains were
not. part of the basic system, consequently notice was given
of their discontinuance and on April 1, 1971, when the Act did
became effective, those trains were discontinued.

However,

6
prior to that, the respondent here brought a suit in the federal
district court against AMTRAK, Celtral of Georgia, and the
Southern Railway seeking a temporary retraining order to pre­
vent the discontinuance of these three trains.
It was alleged that the Act. was violated because of
the relationship between Central and Southern.

Southern owned

virtually all of the stock of Central, Southern itself had
decided not to enter into contract with AMTRAK, but the
Central of Georgia had and they claimed, WARP, the railroad
association here, claimed that either the entire railway system
had to enter into a contract or no part of it could, no sub­
sidiary could.

.And it sought a permanent injunction restrain­

ing the parties from enforcing any contract which did not in­
clude the entire southern system.
The district court denied the temporary restraining
order and dismissed the complaint on the theory that WARP had
no standing because of section 307, which provides that if
AMTRAK or any railroad violates the Act, the district court
shall have jurisdiction upon petition of the Attorney General
of the United States or, in a case involving the labor agree­
ment, upon petition of any employee affected thereby, including
duly authorised employee representatives.

And the district

courts xtfere given jurisdiction to grant equitable relief upon
petition of those parties„
Now, it is clear that the Court of Appeals reversed

7
and held that there was standing.

Now, it is clear that

Congress has the authority to limit the right to sue under an
Act of this kind.

This Court has so held in other cases.

So

the only question here really is whether Congress intended to
do so.

Did it intend to restrict the right to sue?

We think

very clearly it did.
We just take the statutory language standing alone:
We will note that it doesn't provide specifically that anyone
aggrieved or injured can sue.

It. does not even provide that

the specified remedies in tie statute are in addition to other
remedies.

It doesn’t even provide that the specified remedies

didn't extinguish any remedy or right of action not incon­
sistent herewith, which it has done in other statutes, and
instead specifically names the persons who are going to be
able to petition the courts.
In this case, however, we do not have to rely upon
the words of the statute alone, because there is some very
specific and direct legislative history that goes right tothe point before the Court.
In the original draft of the bill, the District Court
was given jurisdiction to sue AMTRAK, AMTRAK alone, given
jurisdiction when there is a suit against AMTRAK alone, upon
petition of the Attorney General or in a case involving a
labor agreement upon petition of any individual affected
thereby.

8
Now, you will note two things about that.

First of

all, AMTRAK alone could be sued and, secondly, it didn't say
anything about labor representatives, just the employees.

At

the hearings which ensued, labor representatives came along
with ten proposed amendments to the Act.

One of them would

have specifically allowed any aggrieved party to bring a suit
for violation of the Act.

As labor spokesmen said, as the

bill now reads, only the Attorney General, except in cases
involving a labor agreement, could bring action.
Now, the Secretary of Transportation, who had a good
deal to do with this Act, including following up on various
sections of it, thereupon wrote the committee a letter address­
ing himself to the various proposed amendments, and he said "I
would be opposed to permitting any person to seek enforcement
of section 307."

Nov;, thereupon what happened?

This is im­

portant because this is not a case of legislative history
where we have the committee ignoring people who have submitted
views.

On the contrary.

The committee actually did make

specific changes in the bill.

For example, according to

following labor's wish, which the Secretary had no objection
to, they added specifically that representatives of employees
could sue, as well as the employees themselves.
Again, following labor's wish, and the Secretary
thought it was unnecessary but he didn't oppose it, thev intro­
duced the allowing other railroads to be sued as well as AMTRAK

9

In other words, not just AKTRAK alone but other railroads
could also be sued under the Act.

But because of the

Secretary3s objection, the committee specifically refused to
introduce this concept of permitting all aggrieved persons to
sue.

The Secretary had objected to it and the committee left

it out, and the bill was passed without it.
It seems perfectly clear to us from this that
Congress intended only those parties that were designated in
the bill, in the statute to be able to sue.

This case therefore

becomes like Switchmen’s Union and Montana-Dakota Utilities
and Fleischraann Distilling and Calhoun v. Harvey, and so forth,
cases where the specific remedies which were mentioned exclud­
ed others, including suits by aggrieved parties.
In addition, however, there are very important policy
reasons why Congress left out aggrieved parties and why this
Court should not sanction it.

The Secretary of Transporta­

tion, the ICC and AMTRAK all were given very unusual authority
and responsibility to fashion a workable passenger transporta­
tion system in this Act.
For example, this AMT RAF is supposed to make a profit
eventually, even though it was recognised that these various
railroads were

losing millions on their passenger traffic.

So it is a very complex and difficult job that was fashioned
here.

And if anybody can sue the railroad, certain things are

clearly going to happen.

For example, even if there is a

10

suit in regard to the discontinuance of an important line, you
are going to have delays, if temporary restraining orders are
entered, which, as our beif
millions to AMTRAK.

shows, could cost literally

But even more importantly, if more than

one person sues, if suits are brought in regard to a single
discontinuance in Alabama and in Georgia, et cetera, you are
going to have the possibility of not only the temporary delays
of one case, but you are going to have possibilities of con­
flict between circuits which are going to unduly delay the
discontinuances that are clearly called for by the Act.

This

case therefore becomes similar to Holloway v. Bristol-Myers,
which is cited to the Court in our reply brief, which inter­
estingly was decided also by the D.C. Circuit btih by a com­
pletely different panel from the panel that decided the instant
case, and they decided that a private party, even though
aggrieved, does not have a right to sue under the Federal Trade
Commission Act.

And the court specifically pointed out the

vexatious litigation that could ensue.
They pointed out that private parties may institute
piecemeal lav/suits, reflecting desparate concerns and not a
coordinated enforcement program.

That same principle is pre­

cise ly app1icable here.
Q

Did you file a reply brief, Mr. Prettyman?

MR. PRETTYMAN:
Q

Yes, sir.

I hope you have it here, sir.

11
MR. PRETTYMAN:
Q

1 will see that you get one.

Well, I can get. it if you filed it.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Thank you.

It was filed about a week ago.

Finally, to allow aggrieved persons to sue here simply
makes no sense, if you look at the overall plan of the Act.
Right now, no

discontinuances of the basic system are allowed.

They won't be

allowed until July 1, 1974.

After July 1, 1974,

the railroad, AMTRAK, if it wants to discontinue a basic
service train, it has to give 30 days notice, thereupon the
Interstate Commerce Commission, if it decided not to investi­
gate under section 13{a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, that
is the end of

it, and this Court has said in City of Chicago

that there is

no appeal by a private person from that decision

not to investigate.
On the other hand, if the ICC does investigate the
discontinuance and passes upon it, an aggrieved party can
appeal that ruling to the court.

It seems to us clear that

certainly in regard to the basic system, it makes no sense
whatever to allow an aggrieved party to bypass this procedure
which has been established and to rush into district court
with an original suit even before the ICC had a chance to
operate.
In other words, so that I am clear, notice is given
of discontinuance, and before the ICC even gets to decide
whether it is going to investigate, a private party rims into

12
district court and brings an original suit and wants to sue
because of the discontinuance.

That doesn't make any sense.

As to the non-basic system traffic, certainly the
Court would not allow a private party a broader authority to
attack the discontinuance of a non-basic system train than it
xvould a basic system train, because Congress has specifically
provided right here in the Act that a non-basic system train
can be discontinued at any time just with 30 days notice.
That is all that is necessary.

And the congressional will

having been expressed, that you can discontinue that easily
a non-basic service train, it certainly makes no sense to allow
an aggrieved person to run into court and attempt to attack it.
So on all of these grounds, it seems to us, on the
basis of the statutory language as it stands, on the basis of
the legislative history which I have pointed out, where an
aggrieved party was specifically left out on the basis of the
public interest involved in seeing that AMTRAK can really
operate and discontinue, et cetera, and finally on the basis
of common sense in light of the legislative scheme we think
that clearly the district court was right in throwing out this
case.
I might just add that the Attorney General, the
responsible official under the Act, agrees with us, as ex­
pressed both in letters and by the position of the Solicitor
General which has been filed before the Court, the United

States agrees that aggrieved parties cannot sue and that the
responsible official for bringing law suits for discontinuances,
at cetera, is the Attorney General.
1 would like to reserve the remainder of my time,
unless the Court has questions.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Prettyman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GORDON P. MacDOUGALL, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MacDOUGALL:
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

My name is Gordon p. MacDouga11, representing the

respondent here, the National Association of Railroad
Passengers.

It is a nonprofit corporation, with its principal

office in Washington, D. C.
We are also joined on amicus by the National Associa­
tion of Regulatory Utility Commissioners

or the state regu­

And we support the de­

cision below which hold that persons other than the Attorney
General in labor organizations have a right to enforce legal
duties imposed by the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970.
I might say, it is not in the briefs, I know the
reply brief of the petitioner, AMTRAK, was filed about a week
ago, but also the President just a week ago signed, a new law,
Public Law 93-145, which made substantial revisions in the
AMTRAK Act.

Now, that P.L. 93-146 was not available as of

14
Friday, hadn't been printed as of Friday.
Q

Does that have any bearing on the —

MR. MacDOUGALL:
periods of section 404.

Yes, it makes certain changes in the
I don't think it changes the principles

involved in this case.
Q

Well, would it change any of the language of that

particular statute?
MR. MacDOUGALL:
Q

Yes, it does change the statute, yes.

What does it change, 307?

MR. MacDOUGALL:

It changes a number, about seven or

eight sections of the statute.
Q

Well, does it cake any change in —

MR. MacDOUGALL:

No, no change in 307(a).

I might

say that the Department of Transportation, as shown in the
Appendix to the brief, had the — the Appendix to the brief
of the petitioner here — they have the March 15, 1973 report
of the Department of Transportation on the AMTRAK Act, with
certain legislative recommendations.

And one of the legisla­

tive recommendations of DOT was to eliminate judicial review
of passenger train discontinuances.

Congress did not adopt

that recommendation and the extensive amendments which were
approved by the President last week do not embrace any changes
to section 307(a) or to the right of persons to take decisions
of the ICC in passenger discontinuance cases to court for
judicial review.

That part was left unchanged.

The DOT'S

15
recommendations were not followed„
Now, the opinion below was 35 pages, it was unanimous,
and it is our judgment that the Southern Railway is under a
legal duty by virtue of section 404 of the AMTRAK Act to oper­
ate the Nancy Hanks passenger train between Atlanta and Savannah
until at least January 1, 1975, unless it contracts with AMT FLAK
before that timef and that the discontinuance that took place
on May 1, 1971, purportedly under section 401(a)(1) of the Act
was in violation of the Act and breached its duty to the
public that we have a passenger train operating between those
two cities.
We, the passengers association, are in the class to
be protected by the Act, and it is the interest to be protected.
We do not look at the AMTRAK Act as being primarily, as indi­
cated perhaps this morning, as a way for the railroads to un­
load their passenger trains.

To be sure, there is some wording

in the committee's report, particulary the House committee
report, saying that certainly some trains are going to have to
be discontinued, but the purpose of the statute was not to
discontinue trains but to keep trains in operation, to expand
trains.

The purpose was to prevent the complete abandonment

of service.

The corporation was expected to "revitalise"

rail passenger service, and that the overriding purpose of
this legislation is to preserve and promote intercity rail
passenger service.

16
We were very active in WARP, we were very active in
getting the AMTRAK Act through Congress, and we do not look at
it as a primary function to be to allow discontinuance of
trains»

We look at it as to —
Q

Did you make an effort to get a provision in

there to give you the right to sue?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

We looked at section 307(a) as a

super-section, that is, that we have the right to sue, that
307 (a) xvas something, because this was going to be a quasigovernmental corporation, and since the Attorney General might
not have the right to go in and sue AMTRAK, we looked at this
as a super-section, that was to give the Attorney General
remedies beyond that which any ordinary person would, have or
which the Attorney General would otherwise have.
Q

Do I interpret your answer to be no, you didn’t

make any effort?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

No, we made no effort to put a

specific section on jducial review in.

In fact, there is

nothing in the legislative history that shows anything on this
other than that the railway labor people certainly the railway
labor people,

Al Chesser, of the UTU, testified, he said,

"The way it looks, it appears that the public doesn’t have
the right of judicial review."

He said it appears.

Attorney

Hickey, who represented a competing or a different railway
labor group, which Mr. Chesser is not in, the Railway Labor

17
Executive Association, said — he said, well, it looked to
him that the statute did not allow judicial review.

So we

proposed, both Mr. Chesser and Mr. Hickey proposed amendments,
they weren't exactly the same, to amend section 307{a}, under
their theory to get judicial review.
The committee said nothing about it in their report.
Railway management opposed the labor's amendment.

Management

didn't say what they opposed in the amendment, they just said
we are Opposed.

Mr. Hickey said that to the committee and —-

and it is in the testimony — he said railway management is
opposed to it.
Q

But that has nothing to do with your position

at all, does it?
MR. MacDOTJGALL:
Q

No, our position is that —

Your position is that the language you figure

was broad enough, and now you are going to litigate it —
MR. MacDOUGALL:
Q

Well, we --

instead of asking Congress to include it,

MR. MacDOUGALL:

■— we looked at section 307, which

was taken from the COMSAT Act, this was taken with changes
from the COMSAT Act.

We looked at that section as giving the

Attorney General powers that an ordinary person wouldn't have,
and we felt that we have -- there is no need for it, we have
the right to go to court, the courts have jurisdiction under
1337, 28 U.S.C. 1337.

There is no question that the courts

18
have jurisdiction.

There is no question that, under section

404, the certain duties the railroad has to continue train
service, unless it contracts with AMTRAK.
any particular need for a specific section

And we didn’t see
just to duplicate

28 U.S.C. 1337, that says you can go to court.

The courts do

have jurisdiction.
In effect what Volpe said, Secretary Volpe — the
title of this section is, by the way, sanctioned — he said
"sanctions are normally imposed by the government,” he said,
consequently he would be opposed to permitting any person to
seek enforcement of the Act, section 307. Tn other words, he
looked at sanction as something above and beyond judicial
review.

And then he said with respect to inclusion of all

railroads, he said he thinks existing statutes apply to them,
and he says to a certain extent the corporation is exempt
from such statutes or statutory requirements.

Consequently,

he says’, 1 am not sure it will be necessary to make sanctions
applicable to any railroad.

He said this is particularly so

here where such sanctions expressly reach "any action, practice
or policy.

The corporation has a quasi-public character in

many respect, and the scope of the sanctions with respect to
it is appropriate.”
So I term section 307 as a super-section to safe­
guard the public interest because Congress was creating a
quasi-public corporation and it didn't want to have all the

19

litigation controlled by private parties, they wanted to give
the Attorney General power to jump in at some time,
I might say that section 307 doesn't say that only
the Attorney General can bring suits.

It says that the

Attorney General is authorised to bring suit, and the word
"authorize'1 comes from the committee report.

The committee

report., in describing section 307 said it authorizes the
Attorney General to go to court.
O

Do you think he could have had that right if

the Act had been silent on the subject?
MR. MacDOUGALL:
Q

I don't think the Attorney General—

Just the employees and labor organizations?

MR. MacDOUGALL:

You mean if — I don't quite get

your question.
0

Well, take all references to the Attorney

General out of the statute, could he bring suit?
MR. MacDOUGALL:
section 5.17 of Title 28.

I question whether he could under

section.
to court,

It is kind of a weak

It. just says that the Attorney General can always go
but it doesn’t say what he can do.

And this ques­

tion came up during the legislative history of the COMSAT
law, the Communications Satellite Act of 1962.
section 307 comes from.

That is where

And there was a lot of debate on

20

setting up COMSAT, with all the government research that had
gone into the space program, and they wanted special powers in
teh Attorney General.

And therefore I think that, if the

section had been silent as to the Attorney General, there is
severe doubt that he could do the things that the Congress in­
tended him to do because the. section says the Attorney General
can order anything that violates the purposes and policies of
the Act — that is what it is, purposes and policies, and it
says any threatened action, he can go and gat an injunction.
It is kind of broad.

In fact, there is some doubt, the Justice

Department has expressed some doubt as to their powers.
Our brief, which is the white-covered brief, on page
29 and 30, particularly on page 30, we have the letter there
of Mr. Gray, Assistant Attorney General, to Congressman Slack,
which was submitted in the case to which this was consolidated
below, and they say that ■— the Department of Justice said
that the Attorney General does not have the authority to
sue for construction of the act or t.o enjoin a purely tech­
nical violation; rather, the authority to sue is granted to
protect and enhance the legislative purpose.

And they have

a lot of doubt about that, and the reason for that is that
when the COMSAT section, which is section 403 of the Communi­
cations Satellite Act of '62 was carried over to the AMTRAK
section, a certain phrase was deleted, and that was the
phrase that allows the Attorney General to go for a specific

21

violation of the Act.
That clause reads, "...or if the corporation or any
other person shall violate any provision of this chapter," in
other words, the authority of the Attorney General to go
after a violation of any provision was deleted from the
Communication's Act when it was carried over into the AMTRAK
Act, and there is some doubt as to what — considerable doubt
as to what power the Attorney General really has here.

And

as a practical matter, the Attorney General has never gone
into court.

We have asked him to do it.

We filed a suit,

HARP did, in the fall of 1970 against Union Pacific.

Judge

Jones granted an injunction and the railroad withdrew the
discontinuance at Kansas City.

We filed another suit in the

•spring of 1971 against the Southern Railway for discontinu­
ance.

Judge June Green gave us an injunction, and the railroad

dropped it.

In both of these cases, the Attorney General

didn't come in, we had to do it ourselves and there was, of
course, the question of standing at that time.
Q

Mr. MacDougall, in the AMTRAK enabling legis­

lation, do you find the sort of provision that you find in
the creation of some federal corporations, authorizing it to
sue or sue and be sued?
MR. MacDOTJGALL;

There is a section in the AMTRAK

Act which, early section, section 301, it does-*t say anything
about that,

It just says the corporation is hereby created in

22
Washington, D. C. — section 301 and 302 -- and I see nothing
in it that authorised the corporation to sue or be sued.

In

fact, one of the matters raised by the Court of Z^ppeals was
what if AMTRAK has a dispute with another railroad, particularly
with respect to the amounts due under section 401, the cost for
joining AMTRAK and so forth, what if AMTRAK disagrees, AMTRAK
is not given power to sue under section 307 (a), if you look at
it that wav.

It just says the Attorney General can sue or a

labor organisation, but AMTRAK or a railroad are not covered
as plaintiffs the way section 307 reads.
So that is why we think that section 307 is really
meant to be a super-section to protect the interests of —
Q

Well, how about the savings clause in 307 that

speaks — I can’t. —
MR. MacDOUGALL:

It says they can sue — they say

the District Court has jurisdiction unless otherwise prohibited
by law.

That is a certain savings clause in there.

And there

is also section Co) to it, which allows other remedies beyond
the AMTRAK Act.

The (a) part of it, unless otherwise pro­

hibited, seems to have come from the COMSAT Act not to allow
the Attorney General to get injunctions against labor unions.
It appears to be that is where it comes from.

There is no

history about it, though, when Congress was debating the AMTRAK
Act.
Q

Mr. MacDougall, in ordinary circumstances, when

23
a railroad wants to discontinue a train, what does it do?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

It goes to either the state commis­

sion or to the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Q

Depending on what kind of a train it is?

Let's

assume they go to the Interstate Commerce Commission, what, do
they just give a notice, do they?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

If a train operates between two

states, they give a notice.
Q

They give a notice to the Interstate Commerce

Commission?
MR. MacDOUGALL:
Q

Right.

And then what happens?

MR. MacDOUGALL:

The ICC then either decides to hold

an investigation or not. to.
O

And how long does it have to do that?

MR. MacDOUGALL:
O

It has four months.

And the train goes on during that period?

MR. MacDOUGALL:

If the commission institutes an

investigation, it requires continued operation during that
period.

If the train operates wholly within one state, which

as the Nancy Hanks, you must, go to the state commission.

Yes.

You must go to the state commission

Now, except for the AMTRAK Act, would you say

you could go directly into court prior to any proceedings

others.

It depends upon the state law that, would govern, be­

cause even the interstate section, section 1301, was an option­
al statute, they could go to the ICC or go to each state served
by the train, so it would depenf on the state law.
Our point is here, apart from that, that the Congress
said intercity rail passenger service shall be continued if a
railroad doesn’t join AMTRAK.

There is a positive obligation

in the AMTRAK law ■—
Q

I understand that, blit discontinuance is still

subject to the same provisions, aren’t they?
MR, MacDOUGALL:

Not necessarily.

You have to —
Only if the train

has been operated by AMTRAK for more than two years, otherwise
AMTRAK could discontinue the train without going to the states.

Well, what about if a company, a railroad makes

a contract with AMTRAK to operate certain trains, what about

its other trains?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

Under the statute, the way we con­

strue it, the railroad must contract —
0

Is that —

MR. MacDOUGALL:

•
That is our complaint below, that,

they must contract with AMTRAK for all of their intercity
passenger service.

They can’t, like the Southern does, pick

and choose, take the profitable lines, from Washington, D. C.
to New Orleans, and run that itself, but let the Nancy Hanks
join, through their subsidiary, join AMTRAK and discontinue
that.
The statute, 401(a)(1), says that the railroad must

Q

Wall, to the extent it does any administrative

participation in the discontinuance process, your position is
that you should be able to get into court before or wholly
aside from that —
MR. MacDOUGALL:

No.

There the administrative pro­

But AMTRAK could discontinue

trains apart from the administrative procedure, trains that
operated less than two years.
Q

Well, what about this train?

MR. MacDOUGALL:
ICC at all.

This train was not subject to the

Q

It was subject to what?

MR. MacDOUGALL:

It was subject to if the Southern

had contracted for all other intercity passenger service, then
it could get notices effective May 1, 1971 to discontinue all
other intercity passenger service without any intervention by
the ICC.

In fact, that is what happened throughout the country.
Q

Well, was this Nancy Hanks — what was it subject

to?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

It was subject to the Georgia Public

Service Commission, because it operated wholly within Georgia.
Q

Did the railroad give notice there?

MR. MacDOUGALL:

No, it didn't have to because under

its theory it was contracting with AMTRAK —
0

Yes.

MR. MacDOUGALL:

-- and thereby was able to just

give on May 1st a notice that they would discontinue the trains.
Q

To whom?

MR. MacDOUGALL:

The public, to give a notice to the

public and file it with the ICC, and the ICC says —
Q

Well, could the ICC have stopped it if it wanted

to?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

No, the ICC issued regulations in

March of 1971 saying that they did not have jurisdiction to
stop it.

It was just a filing for notice provision, that's all.
Q

But there is an interstate involved in this case,

isn’t there?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

There is an interstate and an intra­

state train.
Q

Well, on the interstate train, is it before the

ICC?
MR. MacDOUGALL:
Q

No, no.

There was no provision to

I thought you said they had to give notice to

the -MR. MacDOUGALL:

Today.

Today, now, if we were to

have a discontinuance today, today, that is -- and, of course,
these other railroads aren't operating trains today, it is
mostly AMTRAK — there are just a few railroads operating
today •— if the Southern were to discontinue today, they would
have to go the ICC.

So would AMTRAK, unless it is a train

that AMTRAK has not operated for two years.
Q

And this particular one that is in this case,

are they required to go to the ICC or not?
MR. MacDOUGALL:
Q

No, they were not.

They are not required by law?

MR. MacDOUGALL:

No.

Even if there had been a

proper- —
Q

Why not?

MR. MacDOUGALL:

Why not?

Because when the AMTRAK

Act was passed, if they followed certain procedures in the
AMTRAK statute, they were allowed to discontinue the train.

28

In other words, if the Southern Railway contracted for all of
its intercity service with AMTRAK, then Southern was allowed
by the statute to file a notice to discontinue the service.
Q

File notice with whom?

MR. MacDOUGALL:

With the governors of all the states

and with the ICC, and post it. at all of the stations.
Q

Rut that coverage would be picked up by AMTRAK?

MR. MacDOUGALL:
would not be.

No, no, it hasn't been, no.

It

You see, there were 527 intercity trains before

May 1 — there was some dispute as to how many — 527 intercity
trains.

The railroads posted notice to discontinue all of them

except those that didn51 j oin AMTRAK, and then AMTRAK decided
which ones to operate and operated its own service —
Q

Now, who did the discontinuing?

MR. MacDOUGALL:

The railroads.

This suit is pri­

marily against the railroads.
Q

Well, AMTRAK also made a decision, didn't it,

not to operate?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

Yes, AMTRAK only decided — well,

AMTRAK didn't have complete freedom.

AMTRAK had to operate the

basic system service, plus service above that which they
wanted to operate.
Q

But they — could AMTRAK have operated this

Was this train covered by the con­

MR. MacDOUGALL:

AMTRAK did not contract for any

service to be maintained by the Central Georgia lines of the
Southern.
Q

Well, again, could AMTRAK have operated this

train if it wanted to?
MR. MacDOUGAI.iL:

X would think AMTRAK, if the contract

was valid with the Southern Railway System, it could, yes.

It

could have operated, made an agreement with the Central of
Georgia to operate it, yes.
Q

It could have, but it didn’t?

MR. M&cDQUGALL:

It didn’t, right.

We are not -— we

are suing on the ground that Southern has to have all of its
service, all or nothing —
Q

I am a little confused, Mr. MacDougall.

Is it

your position that assuming your basic premise, namely that
it had to be all or nothing, since it was not, then Southern
or Central of Georgia, its wholly owned subsidiary, may not
discontinue the Nancy Hanks unless Southern does what?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

The Nancy Hanks must not be dis­

continued until January 1, 1375 bv section 404 of the AMTRAK
statute,
Q

Well, now, if it wants to discontinue -— oh,

you mean that is an absolute prohibition?
MR. MacDOUGALl:

Right.

That is a specific

It must maintain the service to

the public until January 1, 1975.
Q

That took it out, you say, of the regular dis­

continuance ~~
MR. MacDOUGALL:

Yes, it made an affirmative duty on

the railroad, an affirmative right on the railroad passenger
to get that service until January 1, 1975.

They cannot dis­

continue any trains.
Q

Is the Nancy Hanks riding now?

MR, MacDOUGALL:
o

No.

Where is it?

MR. MacDOUGALL:

I really don't know.

It was dis-

cotinued —
Q

Well, how are you going to start it running

again if you don't even know where it is?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

Well, the Southern Railway has the

equipment to run the train, I am pretty sure they do.

They are

31

operating their own train service between Washington and New
Orleans.
Q

I am talking about the Nancy Hanks.

MR. MacDOUGALL:

You don’t even know where the engine is?

MR. MacDOUGALL:

Q

Well, what would the order be, that you had to

go find the Nancy Hanks, and if you sold it, you would have to
buy it back?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

Well, the Southern, the^ have a

pool of equipment, of diesel equipment, a pool of coach cars,
and I don’t — in fact, there is a surplus now of railroad
coaches and railroad equipment, and I don’t think there is any
difficulty in restoring that one train should we be entitled
to it.
Q

I don't agree with you at all.

You go ahead,

you make your statement.
Q

Mr. MacDougall, you have been responsive and.

very informative in your answers to questions from the bench
about the merits of your claim, but do you agree with your
brother, Mr. Prettyman, that the merits of your claim aren't
here at all, that what we have here is just the meaning of
section 307?

32
MR. MacDOUGALL:
Q

Right.

You have here whether —

Whether or not you have the right to -—

MR. MacDOUGALL:

right to go to court to assert a

duty which we feel the railroad owes us.
Q

You would agree with him, that that is the only

issue here?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

Yes.

The lower court assumed the

validity of our position and went on —*
Q

For the purposes of this issue.

MR. MacDOUGALL:

Right.

I point out, too, that, there

is no structure within the government within the Attorney
General's office for making any decision as to whether to go to
court or not.

In fact, if you look at page 32a and 33a of the

perition for cert, which is the very dark blue document, what
the Attorney General does, is it gives to AMTRAK — in this
case to Mr. William O. Bittman, who is the attorney for AMTRAK
in this case — gives to Mr. Bittman the authority to raise the
question of course, whether he ’wants it or not.
In other words, when the Attorney General does de­
cide to go to court, as indicated in the petition for cert,
they just tell AMTRAK, well, if you x^ant to raise it before the
judge you can, and here is your authority to speak on behalf
of the Attorney General.

There is no section to enforce the

AMTRAK law within the Department of Justice.

There is no

framework of expertise, as the letter of Assistant Attorney

33

General Gray, which 1 pointed out on page 30 of my brief, 29
and 30 of ray brief, it says DOT has the expertise»
ment of Justice doesn't, have any expertise on this.

The Depart­
There is

no statutory framework or administrative agency such as we
have in the Holloway esse, which was cited to us this morning.
And if there isn't a right to go to court, there just
is not going to be any way for us to have our rights asserted,
there is no way.

The Attorney General is not qualfied.

All he

does is delegate to the attorney for AMTRAK to represent the
position of the government and there is nothing in the legis­
lative history to show why a committee, actually a subcommittee
of the House, why the subcommittee rejected labor's amendment.
Labor's amendment would have gone further and asked for a right
for damages and other things, and the only thing, the way we
look at it, is that this section was to be a super-section, a
section to authorise the Attorney General to go into court
because there is an important interest of the government at
stake in setting up the AMTRAK Act.
involved.

There was a lot of money

It was a quasi-public thing.

all the directors.

The President appoints

And this required special public attention,

special standing for the Attorney General.
The last thing I would like to say is that allowing
access to the court will not frustrate the statutory purpose.
Counsel for the petitioner said that if there is one single
train that is continued, why, it is going to be a disaster.

34

Well, Congress assumed that sometimes AMTRAK would not be
allowed to discontinue a train that AMTRAK wanted to discon­
tinue.

They contemplated that AMTRAK might lose a case here

or there.

And there just is — the only way to allow the

purposes of the AMTRAK Act to be fulfilled is to allow
private suits, we feel.
Now, they made a lot of argument in their brief on
adequacy of service.

Well, forgetting discontinuances, what

about people who have complaints as to meal service, parlor
cars, reservation procedures, no smoking sections, and so
forth, can anybody go to court on that?

Well, the answer is

the AMTRAK Act, bv section 801, has said you go to tte ICC on
that.

They said the ICC shall set the standards so there is

no danger from an adequacy of service standpoint that there
are going to be multitudes of suits.
Q

The real thing is —

Thevd on'fc go to the ICC any more on that, do

they?
MR. MacDOUGALL:
0

Why?

MR. MacDOUGALL:
Q

Yes, they do.

In the AMTRAK Act —

Well, aren't the private suits going to take

over all of that?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

No.

The AMTRAK statute says for

adequacy of service the ICC is obligated to set up the regula­
tions, and also that section was the one that was amended and

35
is now a part of Public Law 93-146.

So as to the standards of

service and everything, there is a procedure, and that is the
ICC.

It was put in there.

So really we are talking about

discontinuances, and allowing the private suits will enhance
the statutory scheme.
There simply is no remedy elsewhere.

There is no

staff at the Department of Justice.
Q

What if a locality wants a railroad to continue

or AMTRAK to continue some local service that AMTRAK doesn't
want to continue, and AMTRAK says, well, pay for our losses?
MR. MacDOUGALL:
Q

That is one of. ‘idle options.

And what if they get into an argument about

that, where is that argument to be settled?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

Well, the statute is clear, if they

have a case they can file it in court but it would have to
be —
0

That provision

MR. MacDOUGALL:

specifically provides for that?

No, it does not.

They would have to

go to court and point to some section of the AMTRAK statute
that, makes AMTRAK, is a duty upon AMTRAK to provide certain
service to the community under certain circumstances.

They

have to point to where the AMTRAK statute makes it a duty on
AMTRAK to do something.
Q

Well, it does make them put a duty on it,

doesn’t it, if the locality is willing to pay for their losses?

36
MR. MacDOUGALL:
that, right.

That's right, there is a duty on

And if AMTRAK didn't do it, presumably the com­

munity would go to court and say AMTRAK is in violation of the
statute.
Q

There is no administrative -—

MR. MacDOUGALL;
that.

There is on that, I believe, on

There is a provision for arbitration by the Department

of Transportation.

I am not sure — there is a section on

that, section —Q

Well, you xtfouldn't — without exhausting that,

you wouldn't think you could go right into court on that?
MR. MacDOUGALL:

I don’t think you would have to —

any time you go to court, you have to exhaust —
Q

But you say there is nothing to exhaust in your

own —
MR. MacDOUGALL;

Ours is not, because these are the

discontinuances that became effective May 1, 1971, when the
railroads posted 527 intercity trains, we thought there were
only 360, there was a question of what was an intercity train,
what is a commuter train, that is one issue now in the courts;
another issue is did

Southern Railway contract for all of its

service or did they not, and there is no limited administrative
remedy for that, and there is no remedy in the Department of
Justice.

We tried mandamus in one case, and mandamus is not

the remedy, either.

37

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything further, Mr. Prettyman?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. BARRETT PRETTYMAN, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Yes, sir.

If you would indulge me

just a moment, because I —Q

I am a little confused, Mr,, Prettyman, as to

precisely what, role new the ICC or the state agencies play.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Yes, I will answer that and track

White to 403(b), sir, there is a specific provision if the

Yes.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Now, let’s go back before the Act

was passed and follow this through.
raised the key question here.

And Mr. Justice White

This Act does not cut off a

right which was a prior right, which existed before.

Before

this Act was passed, insofar as the Nancy Hanks was concerned,
a party could not go to court, he would do one of two things.
If the

railroad wanted to cut off the Nancy Hanks, they would

go first, if they wanted to, to the state, the Public Service
Commission of Georgia.

If they didn’t get relief there, they

could go, under 13(a)(2), before the ICC.

He could not, a

38
private party could not go to court.

He could bring a complaint

before the Public Service Commission or the ICC, but if the ICC
decided to do nothing about it, as Mr, Justice Douglas said to
the Court in City of Chicago, there was no right of appeal of
that decision.
So before the Act, in terms of an intrastate train,
like the Nancy Hanks, the procedure was administrative and you
went to court only if the ICC took the matter up, passed upon
it, and decied, for example, that it wasn't going to discon­
tinue, then and only then there was a right of review.
Now, in terms of trains 13 and 14, which were inter­
state, what happened before thie Act was that, again, the
private party could make a complaint to the ICC.

The :ICC, if

it decided not to investigate, that ended the matter.

If it

decided to investigate and passed on the merits, then there
was an appeal in the three-judge district court.
So this Act didn't, cut that, cut off a right which
existed before.
system.

This Act substituted a slightly different

Now, here is what happens under the Act.

If it is a

basic system train —
0

That is one designated by the Secretary?

MR. PRETTYMAN:
Q

Exactly.

Yes.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Designated as part of the basic

system, which means that it is essential to our transportation

39
needs in passenger traffic.

If it is part of that, no discon­

tinuances can take place until July 1, 1974 — none.

After

July 1. 1974, if they wanted to discontinue a train, they go
pursuant to 13(a) and they go before the ICC and they file
their notice and the ICC either decides to do nothing, let it
be discontinued, in which case, as this Court has said, there
is no appeal, or it decides to investigate, it makes a decision
on the merits, and then there is the normal appeal through the
courts.
Mow, as to excess trains, that is trains which are
hot part of the basic system, and this would have affected the
trains involved in this case, they weren!t part of the basic
system, they were purely excess trains — insofar as those
trains are concerned, they can be discontinued at any time,
with two exceptions.

There has to be a 30-day notice to alert

the public sc they can make their plans and so forth, or if
the train is operated continuously by AMTRAK, picked up by
AMTRAK and operated continuously for two years, it becomes
part of the basic system and then everything relates to the
basic system applies.
Q

Otherwise, all that is required to discontinue

is the notice?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Is the notice, and that shows

Congress’ clear intent, you see, as I indicated before.

It

recognized that there has to be still some more paring to get

40
down to what we can support.
Q

You would say that the Nancy Hanks, if there was

just a notice, a 30-day notice, you agree apparently that no
administrative agency could stop it?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Exactly.

And, sir, let's assume, for

example —
Q

Excuse me, Mr. Prettyman.

Is there an express

exception from section 13 procedures in those cases?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
Q

Yes, sir.

If you look at 404(b)(2) —

Where is that?

MR. PRETTYMAN;

Well, unfortunately, Mr. Justice, I

am most apologetic, we don't give you the entire statute in
our briefs, which we should have.
Q

What is this now, 404 —•

MR. PRETTYMAN;

It is section 404(b)(2).

I was not

in the case originally and I apologise —
Q

So with respect to the trains involved in this

case, there were no administrative remedies to be exhausted
or —
MR. PRETTYMAN:

0.

—-or no primary jurisdiction of any agency?

MR. PRETTYMAN:
Q

No.

Only the notice was necessary?

MR. PRETTYMAN:
0

I understand —

Yes.

Now —

Do you have the pertinent provisions of

41
404(b)(2) before you?
MR. PRETTYMAK:

Yes, sir.

Would you like me to read

it to you, sir?
Q

If you don’t mind, if it doesn’t take too long

to find it.
MR. PRETTYMAN;

404(b)(2) says, "Except as otherwise

provided in this paragraph and in section 403(a)" — that would
relate to the trains operated for two years — "service beyond
that prescribed for the basic system undertaken by the corpor­
ation upon its own initiative may be discontinued at any time.
No such service undertaken by the corporation on or after
January 1, 1973" — this is now as amended •— "shall be dis­
continued until the expiration of the one-year period beginning
on the date of the enactment of this sentence."
they could ba simply discontinued at any time,

Originally
when this was

amended in ’73, they put a one-year catcher on it.
Q

Is that what you call the excess service?

MR. PRETTYMANt

That is the excess service, yes, sir.

In other words, let’s assume that instead of these trains being
discontinued when the Act came into effect, let’s suppose that
AMTR&K had picked them up, which it could have done, in
answer to your question, sir.

AMTRAK could have decided, even

though they weren’t part of the basic system, to operate the
Nancy Hanks and Trains 13 and 14.

If it had decided to do so,

and it has operated a number of trains in excess of the basic

42
system, then this would come into play and it would be operat­
ing them,- if it operated them for two years, they became part
of the basic system, if they were not part of the basic system
and they wanted to discontinue them, this section would come
into play.
Q

Then if they never picked them up at all, who

gives that notice, if —
MR. PRETTYMAN:

In this case, it was just prior to

April 1, 1971, and the Central of Georgia gave the notice that,
on the effective date, April 1, 1971, the trains would be dis­
continued pursuant to 404.
You see, the statute allowed — the April 1, 1971
was the date under the Act when the discontinuances hence forth
could take place if they were not part of the basic system.
Q

As you read that, Mr. Prettyman, I detect no

express reference to an exception from the section 13 procedures,
not in terms at least, there is no refernece to section 13.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

That is correct.

That is correct.

And that is because, if you look at the way the Act is set up.
there is a pure dichotomy between basic system trains —
0

Where is the provision for 30-day notice, is

that in that section or some other section?
O

The 30 days applies to these trains, dcesn#t it?

MR. PRETTYMAN:
is —

It would apply to these trains, that

Q

Where is that?

MR. PRETTYMAN:
0

What section is that?

401, I believe it is, sir.

It is not a simple Act, is it?

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Sir, it is a very complicated Act,

it certainly is.
Well, 13(a)(1) provides that any railroad discontinu­
ing a train hereunder must give notice in accordance with the
notice procedures contained in 13(a)(1) of Title 49, and that
is the 30 days.
The ICC has interpreted that not as calling the ICG
into it, but simply as meaning that they give the notice pro­
vided in 13(a) which happens to be 30 days.
Q

So the ICC has decided they have no jurisdic­

tion to stop the discontinuance of —
MR. PRETTYMAN:
Q

Of excess.

Of excess.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Of excess.

But they very definitely

do in terms of the basic system.
Q

Well, how about local agencies, can they stop

it or not?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

No, sir, because there is a provision

— I think it is 302 ~~ which says that no discontinuance of
any train can ba made anywhere except pursuant to this Act.
In other words, the procedures in vthe Act must be followed as
to all trains throughout the United States.

44
The. main point, though, Mr. Justice, is that if you
go back before the Act, you will find that there was simply no
right at any time just to go directly into court prior to the
state agency or the ICC having acted, and that is precisely
the situation that they are trying to get around now by saying
they can come in before the ICC or anybody else even operates.
Q

Or that they can come in even though the Attorney

General does not?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
Q

Yes.

And the Attorney General, like the agency, might

decide not to intervene —
i

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Yes.

The Attorney General — it is

i

not quite the picture painted here — the Attorney General has
been investigating a tremendous number of complaints.

It has

one right now involving the Penn Central, that the Attorney
General is investigating.

And while there have been no suits,

the Department of Justice has a man who follox^s this carefully,
there are continuous reports to the Congress, to the Secretary,
to the President about the operations, and he exercises a very
diligent role in these matters.
Q

Mr. Prettyman, suppose the operator of an excess

train simply discontinues it without giving the 30-day notice?
Does anybody have any remedy?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Then the Attorney General, I am sure,

45
is authorised to bring suits under the Act, could go in and
perhaps the ICC itself,. I don’t know.

But since he would, not

be following the Act — let me answer it this way — since the
Act specifically provides for the 30-day notice, and since he
would in effect be disobeying the Act, then the Attorney
General would have the obligation to go in and make sure that
the 30-day notice was given.
Q

Just as he presumably does in the respondents'

case here, if respondents are right on the merits?
MR. PRETTYMAN;

Exactly.

And he looked at. this and

decided that they were wrong.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
fWhereupon, at 11:01 o’clock a.m., the case was
submitted.]
