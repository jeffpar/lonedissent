MR, HMlLONEs

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
1 should like to pick up

where counsel left off,

namely, with the attorney fee Question, &n& first apologize
for an oversight in ray brief»
the California Code

X think 7. should have upd&twd

for the benefit of the Court»

•The government code section on attorneys * fees tnafc
has been referred to as this case has come forward is the
government code section 420?»

By the 19 70 statutes or C&.s.*-

forni&j effective January 1, 1971, that cone seecion you
yxnt today is Civil Code section 3250.

It was at this point

that: the California legislature brought forth, brought
ts'vsttc-r its government and Civil Code as it pertaxned to
mechanic’s liens»

And I think at this point it would os

expropriate to hearken back to the type of question that
Ju2>i-n Rahnqu 1st raised.
r;-

And that is in California—perhaps

■ -Justice BlacSanua-'-and that; is that in California do you

not get attorneys * fees because the appellare court of
California says you do not get them, and our answer to tnafc,
of course, i.s no»

Th© intermediate appellate cou& c in

California indictio made the comment that attorneys f fees,
under their civil code statute, do not apply—that statute
dees not apply to a project of the United States.
