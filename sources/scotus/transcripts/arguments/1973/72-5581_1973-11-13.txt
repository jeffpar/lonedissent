ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD MOORE, JR,, ON
BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MOORE?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, my name is Howard Moore, Jr.
petitioner, Richard Guy Staffel.
or

I represent, the

This case is before the Court

a writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the United

States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

That judgment

affirmed th© denial of declaratory judgment by th© United
States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in
on action in which a declaratory judgment was sought, against
: the threatened or nonpending state criminal prosecution for
trespass under Georgia law, Section 1503, 26 Georgia code
Annotated.
The issue presented to be decided by this Court is
whether th© standards set forth in Younger v. Harris and
Samuelsv. Mackell may be applied to deny petitioner declaratory
relief, where there was no pending state criminal prosecution.
Th® factual background out of which this controversy
arises is as followss

There were principally two events.

The first event occurred on October 8, 1970.

The petitioner

a young lady by the nasis of Sandra Becker , both members of

and

an unincorporated association known as the Atlanta Mobilization
Committee, stood outside an the exterior sidewalk of a food
store located in the North Dekalb Shopping Center.

The

purpose for their being there was to participate in handbilling,
They were passing out handbills to invite the public to attend
an anti-war rally in downtown Atlanta on Saturday,, October 31st,
to solicit support for the Atlanta Mobilization Committee, and
to urge support for fcha lettuce boycott.
A copy of tli© handbill which they were handing out on
that occasion is attached to the appendix at page 13.
The duration of the handbilling was adout half an
hour.

During the time they were handbilling, they were quiet

and they were peaceful and there was no unreasonable littering
if any littering at all.
a shopping
to cease.

The handbilling was then disrupted by

center security guard who ordered the petitioner
When the petitioner explained he was exercising

his constitutional right, the Dekalb comity Police were called.
The

police told petitioner and' Miss Becker to discontinue

their peaceful handbilling or they would be arrested. The
petitioner and Mrs. Becker left rather than being arrested.
The second incident occurred on October 10, .1970,
when the petitioner and Mrs. Becker distributed handbills
from .10 : 30 a.m, to 2 s 30 p.ra., a period of four hours, at the
shopping center.

They conducted themselves on that occasion

in an orderly and peaceful manner.

They did not interfere with

4
the shopping center or commercial activities of the center.
Disruption of the handbilling occurred again when a security
guard told the petitioner and Miss Backer to cease handbilling
and leave.

The manager of the shopping center called the

Dekalb police.

The police came again.

The petitioner left.

Ms. Becker refused to leave and she was arrested.
On the 16th of October, the petitioner began his
efforts at judicial relief

or redress by filing a complaint

in the united States District Court for the Northern District
of Georgia for declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds
that section 1503 of the Georgia Code as applied to his and Ms.
Becker's conduct deprived him of his First Amendment rights.
An evidentiary hearing was held on October 28, IS70,
and the court then later, in January of 1971, stayed further
proceedings in the case to await the decision of tills court in
Samuels^ v. Mack©11 and other casas which the court mentioned
in its decision.
Then following the decision in Younger and Samuels,
the district judge applied Younger and Samuels to deny
petitioner relief, although petitioner was one against whom
there was no pending

criminal prosecution.

The district

judge was ©f the opinion that the petitioner had failed to
show irreparable injury as defined by this Court and the
defendant's claim lacked the rudiments of an active controversy.
Steffel then appealed.
' /

Ms. Becker and the Atlantic

5

Mobilisation Committee who were petitioners in the district
court did not appeal»

The district court in a divided opinion

applied Younger and Samuels to this case.

The Court of Appeals

was of the opinion, and stated in its opinion, that that was
no different in effect in a declaratory judgment where there
was not, a pending criminal action than, there was in one where
there was a pending criminal action.

And it saw no difference

in reasoning, and therefore applied Younger and Samuels to this
case.
Judge Tuttle dissented from the extension of
Younger and Samuels, to this case, but he concurred in the
result on a different ground.

Judge Tuttle would' have

affirmed on the authority of Cameron v. Johnson.
A motion was filed for rehearing, and the rehearing
was denied.

Three judges dissented from the denial of rehearing,

and their opinion is before the Court.
QUESTION;

May I ask you — from your statement and

also I recall from reading the

district court that there was

a finding there was no active case of controversy?
MR. MOORE;

The judge said it lacked the rudiments

of an active controversy.

That was the finding of the

district court.
QUESTION;
do with that?

Yes.

What did the Court of Appeals ever

They just ignored it?

MR. MOORE;

They ignored it.

I think that the Court

6

of Appeals was persuaded there was an active controversy as
defined by this Court»
QUESTIONs

The facts showed

It didn’t say so»

MR. MOORE: It didn’t say so, but it proceeded anyway
to male® a determination that Younger and Samuels -QUESTIONS

Is tliat case for controversy matter a

sort of a special issue that w® have to deal with?
MR. MOOREs

It certainly could be, but I don't think

it is dispositive, because I think there is a substantial
showing between parties who have an adverse interest of an
immediate controversy with reality.
QUESTION %
MR. MOOREs

The district court said that wasn't so.
It said it lacked the rudiments.

The

facts there.

There is no statement of

I think that was clearly erroneous, clearly wrong,

because the petitioner on two occasions had been actually
threatened with the enforcement of tills specific statute, not
with some different statute, but he himself on two occasions
was threatened with the statute.

And it is the force of that

statute and his obedience to that statute that has prevented
him from returning -to

shopping center handbilling.

So

there is that adversity of interest because he would like very

7
much to go out, handbilling.
QUESTION:

So ws must assume, I suppose, that ths

Court of Appeals agreed with you.
MR. MOORE; I hope so.

The Court of Appeals didn't

say so, but I think that there is enough in the record on
the facts where this Court can meat that question.
It is the petitioner's position that the YoungerSamuels standards were incorrectly applied to this case.

In

the context of a threatened prosecution, the application of the
Youager~Samuels, standards of irreparable

injury ar© inappropriate.

And they are inappropriate for a number of reasons.

I should

say the majority of lower courts have, with the exception of
the Fifth Circuit, refused to apply Younger and Samuels' rule
of equitable

,.to situations

such as this.

The restraining principles of comity which engender
Younger and Samuels ar® inapplicable whore th© relief requested
poses no threat to an ongoing state proceeding, either criminal
or noncriminal»

Comity is not an absolute value.

As a

practical matter, some balancing must be allowed to insure that
fundamental Federal rights are not lost by blind compliance
with comity.

The purposes underlying the development of this

principle which include the avoidance of conflict with two
courts seeking to dispose of the same cas© and respect for
state courts in the context of a threatened criminal prosecution.
In Samuels it was held there is no difference between

3

declarator;/ relief and injunction with respect to the disruptive
impact each on a pending state prosecution.

The purpose for

equating the two forms of relief was to require a showing of
irreparable injury.

In the context of a pending state court;

proceeding, then there would be pragmatic reasons for requiring
such a showing.

These reasons,.

I submit, would include

additional cost to the judicial system of two ongoing proceed­
ings involving essentially 'the same subject matter and stopping
of an ongoing proceeding where jurisdiction has rested in the
state court and the effect of judicial intervention by the
Federal court is to wrest away, take away from the stats
court, a matter over which its jurisdiction has vested.

And

you run into a principle that does not necessarily have to be
respected in all cases, that ordinarily you don't wrest away
jurisdiction from a court once it has vested.
You have then an indictment of the state processes
because implicit in Federal intervention where there is a
pending prosecution going on is that in some way the state
prosecution is inadequate or that the state prosecution is
in bad faith, or that the state judges are corrupt or that
the state fact-finding proceeding is inadequate.

There are

any number of variables that I could refer to that axe familiar
to this Court.

But it. is an indictment.

It is a slander, so

to speak, of the state process.
Another reason is tin® duplication of effort arid the

9
disruption of the status quo.

These reasons are not: as

convening where a state prosecution has only been threatened?
where no state action is pending there is no assurance that
constitutional rights will receive time and attention.
case is an example of that.

This

It has been now over three years

and Steffel still has not gotten a determination of his rights.
He still can’t return to the shopping center for the purposes
of handbilling.
QUESTION s

Did

he have available to him under

Georgia law any declaratory judgment procedure?
MR. MOORE;

No,, he did not.

Georgia law by statute

and by court decision prohibits the intermeddling of equity
in administrations of criminal law, and Georgia cases have
refused to accept jurisdiction over matters involving the
enforcement of criminal law.

Now, recently, more than two

years after this incident, the shopping center filed an action
for declaratory judgment in the Superior Court of Fulton
County,

That action was dismissed for failure to state a

claim, among other reasons.

One of the other reasons for

dismissing it was that there was primary jurisdiction before,
I think, the National Labor Relations Board because the union
was involved.
QUESTIONS

Why would they file it in Fulton County

if they are in Dekalb County?
MR, MOOREs

The defendant lives in Fulton County and

10

the residence requirement is you have to file in the residence
where the defendant is and that’s why it was filed in Fulton
County.
And there is an appeal pending now by the shopping
center to the Georgia Supreme Court, and that appeal will be
heard -on the 15th, which is Thursday
Friday, I believe,
is
Where irreparable harm /the criteria for declaratory
.relief, rights in doubt may be sacrificed dua to the difficulty
of making such a showing.

The decision that irreparable harm

should not be a criterion for declaratory relief when no
state action is pending is supported by legislative intent,
by case history, and by the writings of the chief architect
of the Federal declaratory judgment, Professor Borchard.
Federal intervention when a state prosecution is threatened
is less disruptive of the state's activities in similar
interventions when a prosecution is pending.
A decree of Federal equitable relief interferes
only with the policing and prosecutorial functions of the
state executive branch.

When the prosecution is pending,

however, such intervention interferes further with the
activities of its judiciary.

The dual interest of the Federal

court in eliminating threat to constitutional violations and
in avoiding unnecessary police interference might both be
protected by
officials.

directing appropriate orders to responsible
They could correct the situation internally

il
themselves.

The advantage of declaratory relief in a nonpendlng

situation is that its noncoarcive effect allows law enforcement
officials to continue to function.
Mow, declaratory judgment and injmotive relief
should be distinguished.

A declaratory judgment car. be

distinguished from the equitable relief of an injunction in
several respects, and I should indicate that declaratory
judgment is not a legal remedy—-not an equitable remedy, rather,
but it is a legal remedy.
Some of the distinguishing factors axe that (1) lack
of adequate legal remedy is a prerequisite for injunctive
relief but is not a criterion for declaratory relief.. Rule 57
of the Federal Rules of Procedure points -this out.

-This has

been a traditional and ancient requirement for the imbibition
of equity that there be an absence of adequate remedy at law
or other appropriate remedy at law.

That was traditionally

the way that the interests of equity was balanced against
the interests of the lower court and gave rise, more or lass,
to the equity course by preventing embarrassment, showing the
ineffectiveness of equity by introducing, or by decreeing an
order that could not b© enforced.
To be granted declaratory relief, the petitioner
need not show the inappropriateness of other forms of relief.
The petitioner need only shew that the declaratory judgment
can handle the dispute efficiently and economically.

12
Injunctive railsf Immunizes particular conduct by ©njoining
further prosecution, whereas a declaration merely interprets
the law and has no injunctive affect.
QUESTION5

Of course, if you gat far enough away

from the irreparable harm and the kind of criteria you have
for B.n inj'unction, then you begin to get into the case of
controversy problem that Justice White mentioned, don’t you?
I mean, a completely abstract question.
MR. MOORE;

It's not completely abstract because this

Court, as wall as the declaratory judgment statute, has defined
standards to determine when a controversy exists over which
the district court can assume jurisdiction.
altogether abstract.

It requires an exercise of judgment,

a discretion by the district judge or
the matter.

So it is not

whoever is determining

Rut it's not entirely abstract.

And the logical

consequences of the position of case in controversy would be
perhaps to repeal the Declaratory Judgment Act.

If the

case in controversy standard isn’t, given a real live content —
QUESTIONs

The confer©very standard Is constitutional,

under the declaratory judgment statute.

I mean, if one had

to go, which I take it you are not suggesting and I am certainly
not, there is certainly no doubt as to which on© it would be.
MR. MOORE;

I understand that.

I am simply saying

that the case in controversy standard has to ba applied
against the background of the Declaratory Judgment Act and to

13

be too restrictive in case in controversy /could result in
repealing the Declaratory Judgment Act.

And whether that would

b© salutary or not, is not a question I think that is really
involved

in this particular case.
QUESTION?

We ar© close to the

breaking point e but sometime in your argument would you take
up for me at least the Cameron case and tell me how we ©scape
Judge Tuttle’s conclusion
MR. MOORE:

that

Cameron

controls this one?

It’s a good question.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume after

lunch.
(Whereupon, at 12 o’clock noon, a luncheon recess
was taken, to reconvene at 1 p.m.)

14
AFTERNOON SESSION
(1 p.m.)
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE! BURGER;

You may continua whenever

you are ready, Mr. Moore.
MR. MOORE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it. please the

Court, to resume, I would like to resume with the question
put to ms by Mr, Justice Blacteam with respect to the application of Cameron v. Johnson

to this case.

First, of all, I would want, to point out that. Cameron v.
Johnson is certainly controlled by Younger and by Samuelsg the
reason being that Cameron was a pending state court prosecution.
There was active liti.gat.ion in the state court.

The petitioners

had filed an affidavit, to quash, on the grounds' that the statute
was unconstitutional,
Next of all, in Cameron,v,,Johnson the district court
did in fact issue a declaratory judgment, but the declaratory
judgment that the district court!, issued was on® which upheld
the constitutionality of Mississippi's an fci - pi ck et in g statute.
Next, Cams rev? v, Johnson is a failure of proof case,
that there was a failure of th© petitioners to prove bad
faith or harassment or even selective prosecution.
Fourthly, the Younger-Samuels, standard is certainly
inappropriate in the context of this case, that is, of a
threatened prosecution, because in the context of the threatened
prosecution, what is a bad faith threat to enforce a statute

15
against specific conduct?

What standards can b© devised by

this court to make the application of the Younger~Sainuals
standard manageable?

The standard in the context of a.

threatened prosecution is unwieldy because there is hardly
any imaginable way to fashion the appropriate standard.
Take, for example, litigation in which we were
involved in Georgia, the Atlanta Vietnam Moratorium Committee.
It’s an unreported case of the district court.

And there what

was sought/ the petitioners sought, the right to go down to
the state Capitol and hold a meeting and parade and have a
demonstration in opposition to the war.

And they notified the

Governor of their intentions of what they planned to do, and
the Governor sent them back a telegram and in the telegram
he said in part., "You will be permitted to hold such a meeting on
the Capitol grounds.

if your purpose is the same as that of

the other moratorium meetings and the ones planned for
November which give aid and assistance to the enemies of -this
country, which downgrade the United States Government and its
flag and which are directed by the Communists and other enemies
of this country with the support of Viet Cong, you nor any of
your group will be permitted to assemble on the Capitol grounds
for such purposes.'’
Now, is that a good bad-faith threat to enforce
Georgia's trespass statute?

Without a declaratory judgment

action, what really would the petitioners have had in order to

16
conduct their demonstration?
Fortunately, we do have declaratory judgroent, and
the district court did issue a declaratory judgment saying that
the stated conduct of the sponsors of the meeting was
constitutionally protected and that the Governor had a right
to his point of view, but he could not impose his point of
view 021 the sponsors of the demonstration so as to deny them
the right to come down to a public building and orderly
demonstrate and orderly hold a masting.

Of course, he could

take action against them if their conduct went beyond that,
cause violence, obstruction and things of that sort.
was not involved.

But that

It. was purely First Amendment activities.

So when under the standard, if the standard of
Younger and Samuels

is applied to a threatened prosecution,

when can the district court reliably determine that bad faith
or irreparable harm is

reliably shown?

There is just no way

that you can do that, unless this Court is going to be willing
to cause

district court judges to try the state of mind of

state prosecutors and state law enforcement agents to show that
they intend to actually strike the threatened blow, they
actually intend to deprive persons of their constitutional
rights.
Then we g**t into a serious question, if the standard
of
is extended to the
threatened prosecution/case in controvery.
Next with respect to this particular case, Judge

17
Tuttle makes it cl/,-ar in his concurrence in Steffel that it was
a pending case >nd h© relies on the language of this Court in
Cameron which talked about withdrawing the determination of
guilt trciu tin© state court, and the only reason a statement of
nature could be mad® is because there was a pending
,,rosecution.

But then this Court went on to say,, in the language

tnafe Judge Tuttle used, to talk about securing protection which
a prompt trial and appeal directly to this Court would provide»
However, in a threatened situation, there is no prompt trial,
there is no appeal.

So the rubric, the technique of a. single

prosecution being dispositive of the claims doss not work and
cannot work in a threatened prosecution.

The reason for that

is there is nothing upon which it can work, unless a petitioner
such as Steffel is r@qu.irad to break the law.

And it does not

seem that a democratic society that prides itself in a concept
of ordered liberty requires actually lawhraaking in order for
one to come into court.
Mow, in a similar case involving a similar question,
in the abortion cases, the doctors and the women who are seeking
abortions and have not actually been moved against under the
state statutes were allowed to enjoy the benefits of a
declaratory judgment in those cases.

So I think that basically

the Cameron y, Johnson is not controlling and cannot be
controlling in this case, because Cameron v, Johnson is more
correctly a pending prosecution case

18

To move on where X left off before rscsss, another
distinguishing factor between the declaratory judgment and
injunctive relief is that the stats can disregard a declaratory
judgment and not be cited for contempt»

But it can be held in

contempt for disregarding an injunction.
Again, in the abortion cases, this Court relied upon
the obligation under the Constitution of State officials to
obey decisions of this Court which are the supreme law of the
land and to obey the decisions of this Court voluntarily,
I have been notified that my time is about to expire.
Such time as I have, X would like to reserve it for rebuttal,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Moore.

Mr. Cohen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE M, COHEN ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR, COHENs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas® the

Court, there, are two issues in this case in our opinion.

The

first is -whether Federal courts in the ©xercise of their
equitable jurisdiction should issue a declaration of rights
as to the good faith enforcement, of a facially valid statestatute.

There is no allegation in -this case that there has

either been bad faith harassment or a facial invalidity to the
Georgia criminal trespass law,
Tha second issue which I will address myself to is
whether where there is only the application of a state statute

19
iri. question, the state should first be givan the opportunity
under the doctrine of abstention to apply that • statute.

In

our opinion the Court of Appeals properly declined, properly
its
dismissed the complaint hers on the basis of/equitable juris­
diction, and even if it had not, it would have properly abstained
to decide the question, retain jurisdiction until the Georgia
courts had spoken on this issue.
A Federal declaration of right as to a state criminal
statute should issue only where it is necessary and appropriate
to secure a vindication of constitutional rights,
such a case.

This is not

The Federal courts hers could not provide any

protection to either the plaintiff or to any other potential
plaintiff that they could not otherwise receive.

Conversely,

there may be many of the significant disadvantages described
in Younger and Samuels of Federal intrusion upon state criminal
processes,
It is significant that the petitioner in this case
has not. sought any declaration that the Georgia criminal
trespass law is generally void or even invalid as to any class
of parsons.

Really all that is sought is only a declaration

as to a particular incident, at a particular shopping center
at a particular time seeking to convey a particular massage.
The only declaration that the Federal court could issue in this
case is that the conduct that occurred on October 8 or the
different conduct that occurred on October 10 was violative of

20

Federal constitutional rights»

It could not have adjudicated

the statute generally? it. could not have adjudicated the
statute as to any other class of persons, or as to anybody
seeking to coma on any other shopping center or to convey any
other message.
In that situation, there is no value, there is no
virtu® in a Federal declaration.

The Federal declaration

doesn't in any way achieve anything that proceeding -through the
state courts could not otherwise achieve.
QUESTION;

You don't contend hers, then, or do you,

that there was no distinguishable controversy —*
MR. COHEN;

We don't make that contention, Mr. Justice

Whit®.
QUESTION;

So that her® on the face of it is a

case of controversy involving a Federal constitutional
question.
MR. COHEN;

It's a case of controvery involving a

Federal constitutional question, but an exceptionally limited
constitutional question.

Where you ar© talking about a statute

as applied, the only constitutional question is whether conduct,
on a particular occasion at a particular time would or would
not be violati'v© of the Constitution.

It does not in any

way say that the Georgia criminal trespass law generally
QUESTION;

Would you say then that the Declaratory

Judgment Act gives Federal courts —- contemplates the Federal

21

courts will us® their discretion as to which cases of controversy
to entertain and which not to?
MR* COHEN:

Yes,

I think there ara two principles

•that cut against th© principle in the Federal Declaratory
Judgment Act, and I would like to

...

The first principle is the principle of comity.
Not every case of controversy that the Federal courts under
the Declaratory Judgment Act could decide really warrants
decision.

For example, if you have a pending prosecution, then

Younger and Samuels limit the right of the Federal Declaratory
Judgment Act.

Similarly, where you have a nonpending case,

such as the one we have her®, we don’t think that the principle
of comity should be abandoned altogether.

We would say that in

that case a Federal court could issue a declaration as to a
■facially invalid state statute, an allegation of facial
invalidity, but it cannot issue a declaration where all that is
being sought is to attack a statuto as applied in a. particular
case.
QUESTIONS

Would either or both of those take a

three-judge court?
MR. COHENS

If there is a du© process argument, I

would assume that, would be true.
QUESTION:

But to declare a stata statute

unconstitutional, you have to have soma .Federal, constitutional
ground.

I take it it would be due process.

22

MR- COHEN:

1 would take it if the statute's statewide

application is generally invalid, you would need a three-judge
court.

Where it is only a single incident as we have here,

there was no seeking of a three-judge court, and I don't think
one would ha appropriate.
QUESTIONS

Wasn’t there contention not that people were

being harassed with a valid statute but at least in these
circumstances it was unconstitutional to apply the statute.
MR.

(DHEMs

That is correct.

There is no allegation

of harassment or bad faith prosecution.
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:
court.

Why didn’t this take a three-judge court?
I don’t think it warranted a three-judge

It is only talking about a particular potential incident.
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:

A hypothetical case, would you say?
No, I don't consider this to be a

hypothetical case,
QUESTION:

Because of the prior pattern.

MR. COHEN;

Becaixse of a prior pattern.

I think we

are not arguing hare that there is lack of concreteness or lack
of rightness or lack of standing.

Our argument here is that

the case was appropriate for decision, but the Federal court
in exercising its discretion, equitable discretion here, should
not have decided that case because of principles of comity ,
alternatively should have abstained deciding it because of
principles of abstention

23
QUESTIONS

Do you think you are defending the Court of

Appeals® decision then?
MR. COHEN;

No.

I am defending Judge Tuttle's position

in the Court of Appeals insofar as his concurring opinion goes.
We would agree with the Court of Appeals that the principles of
Younger and SamueIs are applicable in this case only to the
e2-stent that in this case the processes of (inaudible) .
QUESTION;

(Interrupting)

The Court of Appeals was

somewhat broader than your —
MR. COHENj

That's correct.

That's correct.

To the

extent the Court of Appeals is saying that Younger and Samuels
apply in every instance where there is an attack upon a State
statute,

I would not go that far.
QUESTION;

If the attack were facially unconstitutional,

you would not go that far.
MR. COHEN;

Yes, that is correct.

I would feel where

there is an attack on facial invalidity, you do not have to
apply Younger and Samuels where there is no pending prosecution.
Because as I see the principles here, we are dealing with the
question of two principles cutting against each other.

We have

first a principle that a plaintiff, at least in civil law
statutes, has a right to choose a forum.

He has a right to go

in the Federal court, he has a right to go in a State court
where he is seeking a vindication of constitutional rights.
QUESTION;

And you don’t think the Federal Declaratory

24
Judgments Act rather inhibits that dichotomy?
MR, COHENs

The Federal Declaratory Judgments Act

provides a minor form of equitable relief.

It provides a form

of relief in which there may be different standards.

For example,

under Younger and Samuels an injunction could not issue whether
there is a pending or not a pending situation, even in a case
of facial invalidity.

We would say that a declaratory judgment,

however, being a milder form of relief, could issue where there
is only an attack on facial invalidity in a nonpending situation.
So that you would achieve a right under the Federal Declaratory
Judgments Act that would not be possible if you only had a ~
QUESTION;

Why

do.you suggest that equally the

Declaratory Judgments Act could not be invoked where the attack
is only as applied?
MR, COHEN s

Because I think at that point you are

balancing the interference with the State criminal processes
and the need for Federal declaration of rights.

Where you are

only coming into it as applied, there is no necessity, there is
no chilling effect, if you will, on other persons that need to
be vindicated in the Federal court.

You have all the same

considerations on the other hand that warrant the doctrine of
comity being applied.

You have potential duplication of

The Becker case could still go forward here, because

we don't know that the Samuels case and the Becker case involved
the same considerations.

If it was facial invalidity, you

Presumably the State would defer to the

So you still have

People may want to give weight to

You have an erosion of the role of the jury.

You

have the fact, as in Samuels, that you may have ancillary
injunctions or you may have ancillary types of remedies being
issued by the Federal court.

And you would have, in other

words, interruption of the State processes of which there is
no corresponding value by obtaining a Federal declaration of
rights.
Where you have a facial invalid statute, I think there
is a sufficient warranting of bringing in the Federal processes
and apply them, because there you have an effect on other people
as well and rights that cannot be secured by piecemeal adjudica­
tion in the State courts,
UESTION; But you don't have declaratory judgment in
this action in the State court.
MR, COHENs

We don’t agree with that, Justice Marshall.

In our opinion the Georgia law, section 110-1101 of the Georgia
Code is broader than the Uniform Declaratory JudgTaent Act.

In

our opinion the other act confers a right under Georgia law to

MR. COHEN;
QUESTION;

No, it isn't.
-- and I take it you would make the same

argument if you had no declaratory judgment act.
MR. COHEN;

I would make the same argument.

I defer

to the hake Carriers, for example, where Mr. Justice Frankfurter
said that the existence of a State declaratory judgment statute
was not material,

...

the New York State Declaratory

Judgment Act, that was not held to be important.

Therefore, there is no Federal equitable

jurisdiction should issue a declaration of rights.

The court

didn't say, well, this would have been a different case if it

There was no differentiation

And in

no case do we have a situation where the Federal court issued
a declaration of rights to a statute as applied

think.

This is especially apropos here,.we

We are dealing with trespass, which the Chief Justice

observed in Taggart is a matter of historic State concern.
•?

This is the thrust, I think, of Lloyd also„

Where the State

courts are fully competent to adjudicate Federal questions,
and there is no indication that they will act in bad faith,
especially we are here cognizant of an almost identical case,
the Becker case, and. the issue is one of special State concern,
we submit that it would be out of harmony with the constitutional
presumption of State competence for a Federal court then to
intervene.

Federal intervention, after all, is peculiarly

inconsistent with our Federal framework.
This is, X think, especially appropriate here where
we have a situation, where the Federal courts participating
would not in any way eliminate uncertainty.

The next person

seeking to come onto a shopping center in Georgia would not
even
know/if there was a declaration of rights here as to whether or
not

ha had the right to come onto the shopping center.

Someone

wanting to come out to the North Dekalb Shopping Center for
another

message, not to protest the Vietnam War, but perhaps

to obtain signatures on initiative petition or to go ahead and

28

campaign for political office would not know by virtue of the
declaration of rights here as to whether or not he had that
right to come out,
QUESTIONS

In the First Circuit case of Wulp v, Corcoran,

that was an allegedly facially invalid ordinance, I guess, or
statute,
MR. COHEN:

That's correct.

It was a city ordinance

requiring a license to solicit in that case, and in that case
it was alleged that that city ordinance by requiring a license
in advance was facially unconstitutional.

But there was no

saving construction or construction as applied.
I think that's true, incidentally, Mr. Justice
Stewart, of each of the cases that is cited by the plaintiff.
There is no case they cite where as here you have someone coming
on to seek construction of statute as applied.
There

is a second ground which we argue in our brief here,

in addition to this distinction between cases where there is a
statute as applied as opposed to a facially invalid statute,
and that was even if there is a distinction to be drawn between
pending and noripending cases, that distinction shou3.d not
depend on whether there has been an actual arrest or an
i

indictment.
In this case we did not have a plaintiff who merely
wrote to the shopping center and said, "I want to come out to
the shopping center."

But, no, he went into Federal court.

29

We have a plaintiff who twice came out to the North
Dekalb Shopping Center, twice was asked to leave, twice the
police were called, and it was only on the second occasion when
he left at that point that he brings Federal suit.

We think,

in other words, that he has actively invoked the processes of
the State law enforcement officials at this point, and to
proceed at this point, moreover, especially in view of the
Becker case, would involve a duplication of efforts and a waste
of resources.

There would necessarily be State-Federal friction

here if the Federal court interfered by issuing a declaration
of rights.

And I think this is the offense to comity that this

Court was seeking to avoid when it issued Younger and Samuels
decisions.

The considerations which might warrant, in other

words, drawing a line between pending and nonpending cases, if
that is to be determinative, should not require then the situation
such as the one we have here that this is considered to be "a
nonpending case."
QUESTION:

Mr. Cohen, does your argument go so far

as to say that where you are talking about a statute as applied
as opposed to facially invalid, that perhaps there is not even
1983 jurisdiction,that the State official in that case isn’t
actually causing the person to be deprived of any rights?
MR. COHENj

Well, you have in the shopping center

cases, I think, a significant question of State action, as I
read —

30
QUESTION:

I don't mean State action.

Let's assume

there is no doubt that the claim here is against the sheriff
and that the claim is that this is sufficient State action.
But in the rather tentative stage of this situation where there
wasn't actually any pending prosecution, is there any question
as to whether there you can say a State officer has caused this
man to be deprived?
MR. COIiEN:

I think you would be getting into a real

question of the speculative nature of asking the Federal courts
to step in where there has been no overt action here,

We

don't know what the State officials would have done in this
case as they actually operate.
problems.

And I think that raises 1983

I don't think I am prepared yet — I think you do

have the element in a nonpending case of auras of speculativeness
and remoteness.

I think that operates to indicate, especially

in an applied situation

if you are going in against a State

statute, there is no question about it.

But if you are going

into a particular applied situation, then there is a real
question of does 1983 apply, do we have a recti controversy,
what is the nature of the dispute, and so on.

That's one of

the reasons why the Federal court should not act in advance in
that type of situation.
QUESTION:

Do you make anything at all out of the

fact that,if it's true,that there was a criminal prosecution
pending against a fellow actor?

Or was there?

31

MR. COHEN;

Yes, there was.

There was a criminal

prosecution ~~
QUESTION s
MR. COHEN;

Was the same question raised there?
One of the two people who came out to the

shopping center, Ms. Becker, did not leave.

She was arrested.

Steffel left and was not arrested obviously since he left.
Steffel and Becker both brought the same action.

The lower

court dismissed as to Becker because there was a pending
prosecution.
QUESTION;

And she could raise the same questions

thex'e?
MR. COHEN;

She could raise identical questions, that’s

right.
QUESTION;

And did, or not?

MR. COHEN;

She hasn’t raised them because it has

been held up pending this action.
QUESTION;

MR. COHEN;

There was no motion to dismiss the

No action was taken there.

pending resolution of this controversy,

The case was held up
I think it reached the

indictment stage but hasn’t proceeded beyond that point.
I think it’s significant in this case to show the
narrowness of the Federal injunction — I mean, the Federal
declaration of rights it sought, is to compare the two handbills

that were passed out on this occasion.

We have one handbill

that was passed out on October 8 — excuse me.
QUESTION:

Tell me again what happened to the

Becker case.
MR. COHEN:

The Becker case, Becker was

arrested,

was brought up, was arraigned, and then this action was filed
involving both Becker and Steffel at that point.
QUESTION:

Am I misinformed or under a misapprehension?

I thought that her case had proceeded, that she was prosecuted
and convicted and did not appeal.
MR, COHEN:

That is not correct.

I think it is

dealt with in Footnote 2 at page 46 of the appendix in the
Court of Appeals decision where the court says, "At oral
argument the Court was informed that Becker's trial had been
indefinitely continued, presumably awaiting the disposition
of this appeal.”
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:

Thank you.
That's the latest word I know of it,

Mr. Justice Blackxnun.
What did happen in the Becker case was no appeal was
baleen from the district court's dismissal of the injunction
and declaration of rights request, which is part of this case.
The only appeal here -was taken by Steffel as to declaration of
rights.
The point I was going to make v/as to compare Exhibit A

33

and Exhibit B, pages 13 and 14 of the appendix which were the
two handbills involved here*
Exhibit

A involves a message which is unrelated to

the shopping center and to which there may be alternative forms
of communication.

It is a communication, therefore, which

directly involves the same considerations as did the type of
communication desired in Tanner v. Lloyd.

Under Tanner v. Lloyd

we think there is no question that that type of communication
was not permissible on the private property of the shopping
center, unless the shopping center, which it has not been
alleged here, became a functional

..

of public property.

Exhibit B, however, is a message directed at a
particular tenant of the shopping center, namely, the Colonial
Stores which distributed lettuce.
considerations in that case.

There may be different

That case might be held or might
?

not be held to be more akin to Logan

... than to be akin to

Lloyd.
So we have a declaration here that depends on the
happenstance of whether the person had been arrested on October 8
or October 10.

If he had been arrested on October 8, it wouldn't

haves governed the October 10th condufc.

If he had been arrested

on October 10th and there was a declaration of rights as to
that conduct, it wouldn’t have governed the October 8th conduct.
In that type of situation, to permit the Federal
courts to interrupt the State process -— interfere with the

34

State processes and prematurely adjudicate a question before the
State courts have been able to adjudicate it, we think offends
the principles of comity and of federalism which are the
heart of Younger and
QUESTION:

The only thing Steffel can do is wait

may not find the sum of the controversy, but it may

certainly give enlightenment and it may reach a decision which
either avoids the constitutional problem by saying that someone
in a similar situation can’t be px'osecuted, and therefore there
is little risk that Steffel would be prosecuted, or might reach
a modifying decision which would modify its law in such a way
as to avoid the constitutional question.

the Federal court can issue a declaration of rights as to the

Not as to applied because that would vary

from case to case and there is no virtue as to any other person

I would submit that in that type of situation, the Federal court
took the pose it's constitutional, the plaintiff is going to
be advised of all the rights to which he is entitled to be known
in advance before he proceeds under State law.

>

The case I think in some ways, as far as the
abstention ground goes, resembles a case that was decided last
term by this Court called Gibson v. Berryhill

where you had

a State statute, optometry statute, there had been a decision
by the Court in that case that it should exercise equitable
jurisdiction, there was no room for abstention.

But there was

40

also a State case that was proceeding that involved other
people in a similar situation*

And this Court held in that

type of situation that there should be abstention until the
lower courts of the State had passed upon the people — the
decision of the highest court, I think it was, of Georgia as
to people similarly situated to those who had brought the
action in Federal court.
And it is cur position that the same kind of
consideration should lead to abstention here should this Court
find Federal courts

properly refused to exercise their

equitable jurisdiction.
Thank you.
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Cohen.

Mr. Moore, you have a few minutes left.
REBUTTAL ORGAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD MOORE, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MOORE;

Several things in rebuttal.

Indeed as applied adjudications have less dignity
than facial adjudications.
of a statute.

That is, the facial constitutionality

I think that for the reason that they do have

less dignity, that they should be routed into the district
court where it is appropriate, and the reason for that is that
I believe it makes a more manageable relationship between a
State and Federal court and it unburdens this Court with
needless applications for certiorari which may be substantial

41
questions in a Federal district court, but not necessarily
substantial questions warranting the exercise of this Court's
certiorari jurisdiction.
I should say further that district courts are familiar
with the exercise of their declaratory judgment action in
applied situations, because they do it every day in diversity
cases where insurance companies are suing to determine whether
or not a particular accident is within coverage of the policy.
Why, then, should Federal constitutional rights have any less
dignity than ordinary personal injury cases?

I think as

applied adjudications are appropriate for routing into the
district court.
That’s not necessarily a question to be decided in
this case.
Additionally, I think that the Court should take
seriously the statement of Judge Tuttle with respect to turning
federalism on its head.

What would happen here if this Court

were to affirm the Court of Appeals, it would create a situation
where conduct could be controlled not by State courts, but
rather by prosecutorial officials, law enforcement officials.
The rule of "Watch it, boy," would really become a statute.
an
Take, for example, if Steffel, instead of being/outside handbiller
were a tenant in the shopping center, a long-haired tenant in
the shopping center, operating an ice cream stand, and instead
of operating an ice cream stand every day, he had people

to gather into his ice cream stand and planned protests against
the war, ecological protests, support in behalf of women,
racial rights, racial equality, and things of that sort.

But

yet someone, and the police didn’t like what Mr. Steffel was
doing and told him that unless he ceased, they would arrest him
for unlawful assembly, without the right to come into Federal
court, Mr, Steffel may very well have to obey the admonishment
of State prosecutorial officials.
QUESTION:

In your hypothetical case is Mr, Steffel

doing this in a cubicle rented by him, a store?
MR. MOORE:

He is a tenant.

And, of course, that
?

would be greater sensitivity and acceptivity to his position
because then he would also have a property right as well as a
personal right of liberty.

But there is a tremendous danger

that the Declaratory Judgment Act would be potential of repeal
as Judge Tuttle indicated, and there is tremendous danger to
federalism because valuable constitutional rights may be lost
and there would be no remedy, no forum in which they could be
protected.
QUESTION:

I don't see how it helps you that much

to say that Mr. Steffel might be able to do something in his
private quarters when we are dealing with a case where he is
not doing anything in his private quarters.
MR,

MOORE:

Mr, Chief Justice, the example is that

it illustrates some of the harms and variations that could flow

43
from withholding the right to seek a declaratory judgment where
there is a nonpending prosecution.
QUESTION:

In your hypothetical case, he has in

effect hired a hall, to take the vernacular, he has hired a
hall and presumably can do anything he wants to in that place.
MR. MOORE:

Not actually.

What he has actually done

:is to operate a business, but he is sensitive to the issues
of the day and he devotes himself to the issues of the day
rather than to his business and someone is offended by it,
QUESTION:

To all the customers who come in his store,

your assumption is?
MR. MOORE:

Perhaps his customers are friends of his.

It’s his space, he's a tenant, he uses it as he pleases.

But

the problem is that if declaratory judgment is withheld, then
there would be no way that Federal rights can be reliably
protected and that he would have to obey the admonishment against
perfectly proper and constitutionally protected activities,
QUESTION:

Mr. Moore, let me ask you one question

similar to what I asked Mr. Cohen.

As I read 1983, in order for

you to state a claim you have to show that the defendantt
in line with the statute, subjects or causes to be subjected
your client the deprivation of constitutional rights.
Now, in the absence of a pending prosecution, how
do you fit the facts of your case into that language?
Mr, MOORE:

Wei}., we would certainly claim that

44
police officers who came and admonished him were State agents.
And the question then would become whether or not there would
be sufficient State action based upon the enforcement apparently
in good faith -—
QUESTION;

Assume there is sufficient State action,

but the statute reads in the present tense, they subject or
cause to be subjected your client.

And in the absence of a

present prosecution, don't you have some trouble fitting those
facts into the language of the statute?
MR. MOORE;

Certainly not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

because my client is obeying the State law.

His staying away

from the premises is in deference to the State laxv as enforced
by the State agents.

They actually came out, the police

actually came out, the State police came out and told Mr.
Steffel to leave the premises.
QUESTION;

So the gist of your complaint isn’t, then,

the threatened prosecution.
MR. MOORE;

I don't quite understand your thrust of

your question.
QUESTION;

Well, I have taken too much of your time.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1;45 p,m., the orgal argument in
the a&ove-entitied matter was concluded.)
