ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN A. SINDELL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SINDELLs

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, I don't believe that this case can be decided with
respect to the questions of law that are presented without a
reference, at least some reference point, to what the record
contains with regard to the facts.

And I thinJc something has

to be said in that regard,
The complaints filed in this action clearly state
what would otherwise be a cause of action as at least I can
best understand.

We have alleged that four innocent students

were shot on a college campus without any justification.

We

have alleged, Members of this Supreme Court, we have alleged
that the Governor and the generals conspired intentionally to
deprive these people with the specific intent, in bad faith,
in effect, of their rights under the Federal Constitution and
under 1983.

We have alleged that these facts are true in that

they can be proven.
We were confronted with a motion to dismiss, on which,
as I understand it and notwithstanding any affidavit that was
ever filed in this record contains, if anything, the liberal

4
invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination by
some of these defendants,

We have alleged in these cases that

there was no justification for itf and nevertheless, and not­
withstanding that, and based upon what we felt in effect were
news madia accounts of this incident, that the passions of the
headlines were substituted for the rules of evidence in this
case;

And I quote specifically where the concurring opinion

in the lower court said that the pleadings clearly contrived
to hide rather than disclose the true background of the events
arid they predicated causes of the action without disclosing
their true subject matter without any evidence before that
court to so find.

That is exactly what was said.

The majority opinion in the lower court is infected
with statement after statement that there was a riot, that
there was an insurrection, that there was a .rebellion, and,
Members of this Court, even the Governor of the State of Ohio
the day after it occurred never- used a word like that in his
proclamation to justify it, not one word to that effect.
Nevertheless, the court has so found.

I am not

suggesting anything except that there is a colorable claim.
I'That, as juxtaposed to these allegations, have the defendants
Solid?

They have invoked the privilege of self-incrimination

at least nine times in response to material interrogatories.
And more importantly,

if we are going to take judicial notice,

let us then take judicial notice of one responsible investigative

5
organ of this Nation, and that is the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, where it was specifically stated, and. I am
quoting at pages 24 and 25 of our brief, things like theses
18We have some reason to believe that the claim by the
National Guard that their lives were endangered by the students
was fabricated subsequent to the event,"
51 [One Guardsman] admitted that his life was not in
danger and that he fired indiscriminately into the crowd*

He

further stated that the Guardsmen had gotten together after
the shooting and decided to fabricate the story that they were
in danger of serious bodily harm or death from the students.85
"The Guardsmen were not surrounded."

prior to the firing,"
"There was no sniper."

for the rest of his life.

substitute in a court of law, in a court of appeals, news
media headlines or whatever predilections of the facts the
court may have, for the presentation of evidence in its orderly
course, then I say that we have really reached the stage where
che rudimentary concepts of due process of law have been

violated.

And I think that would be a shocking departure from

procedure, at least as 1 have always understood it in the past.
We have here a situation where there was no claim
of insurrection.

There is no evidence in this case, not only

the day after the shooting in the Governor’s proclamation did
he use "insurrection,” "rebellion,*"invasionf" "riot," "tumult,"
or any such words.
But, your Honors, in addition to that, months later
with the advice presumably of competent counsel, my brother
here, then he did not say anything more than that there were
threatened disorders and breaches of the peace, and in fact
in answers to interrogatories that are part of the record in
this Court.
The President's Commission on Campus Unrest said
that this shooting was unwarranted, inexcusable, and unjustified.
It is our view that the rules of evidence cannot be supplemented
by the factual predilections of a judge reviewing a complaint,
not a summary judgment notion, but a complaint.
Now, specifically dealing with the question of
immunity, and I think it’s important that we do that here in
this regard, in Sterling v.

Constantin, that Supreme Court

was confronted with a situation where a Governor, Governor
Constantin, had issued a proclamation which was stronger than
the one issued by Governor Rhodes.
insurrection.

It said that there was an

It said that there was a rebellion.

It said

7
that there was a state of affairs that justified the calling of
martial law.

And. nevertheless the District Court want on to

find behind those allegations of the Governor in his proclama­
tion that that wasn't true, and in fact no such thing existed
except what they characterized as breaches of the peace.

And

when the Governor and the generals came to this Court and said,
”We are immune under the 11th Amendment," this Court specifically
held that a Federal court has ample jurisdiction to determine
the veracity of those allegations with evidence properly
presented before it.
And I think the case of Moyer v. Peabody is clearly
distinguishable from this one.
that point.

And I want to address myself to

Indeed, Moyer was a 1983 action.

question about that.

There is no

But what is important to recognize about

Moyer, and again I must return to tiie facts because I think
they are critical, in that case the Governor and the complainant
both agreed on two things;

They agreed, number one, without

dispute that an insurrection existed and they agreed that the
Governor acted in good faith.

These were stipulated facts

before that court, and I quote the language when I say that
the Supreme court in its opinion said, "We are here assuming
that there was an insurrection and that he exercised good
faith, and the only question is that he was unreasonable in
arresting Mover under those circumstances."
Now, this is not such a case.

There is no agreement

8

among counsel in this case that a state of insurrection existed.
Instead we have alleged there was a peaceful gathering on a
college campus with bullets intervening to break up what other­
wise was a peaceful gathering on a college campus.
Now, if we can't prove that, then we should lose.
But if we can prove it, it's not a Moyer case.

We do not agree

as counsel did in Moyer that there was good faith on the part
of the Governor.

To the contrary, it is our allegation in this

case, and it is our intention to prove that the Governor was
personally involved in this situation, that as commander-inchief — remember, this was a time several days before the
Republican senatorial primary.

Without editorializing on the

validity of the law-and-order position that he was taking, the
fact is that that was his position that he advanced in that
particular situation.

And here was threatened disorder and

he just wasn't sitting behind his desk receiving information
of an alarming situation and sending troops out.

He went down

there to that campus the day before this incident occurred.
He made a speech in the presence of the commanding general —
QUESTION!

How far are you going to go away from

this record?
MR, SINDELL:

I want to stop going away from this

record for this reason.
QUESTION:

You have been gone about 15 minutes.

s
MR* SINDELLs

Your Honor, I want to go to court and

I want to prove these things,

And the reason that I bring

these things into the case is simply because three of the
reviewing judges in this case, three of them, have gone outside
the record and refused to believe that the allegations were
true.

That’s why 1 go outside the record, not. to convince you

of what I say is proof as a matter of law, but to convince you
that

they are allegations which warrant the right to prepare

evidence in a court,
QUESTION;

I don't have to follow you outside the

record if you keep out, do I?
MR, SINDELLs

All you have to do is to agree with

me that the complaint’s allegation should be taken as true and
it seems to me that we are entitled to prove them,
I would like specifically in regard to the 11th
Amendment contention, and I would like to address myself to that
for a moment.

It seems to me that the distinction that has

been made here between a statute, that an unconstitutional action
under a statute• that is allegedly unconstitutional is different
than an action Which is just plain unconstitutional because of
the nature of the action, really was never intended as a
distinction to be engrafted upon the Civil Rights Act at all.
Congress intended to reach the unconstitutional effect, as I
understand the decisions of this Court.

It says every person

who acts, not under a statute, not without a statute, within a

statute, every person who acts under power of law to violate
the constitutional rights of another is liable for tnat action,
every person.

And it doesn't engraft amy distinction at all.

The only reason we are not seeking an injunction in tills case and it says in that statute an action at law, equity or other
proper redress.

The breadth is broad.

injunction in this case.
of damages.

We can't seek an

All we have is the available remedy

That’s obvious from the circumstances.

And there-

fore, we are well within the terms of the Civil Rights Act and
to say that only where a statute exists that's unconstitutional
can the Civil Rights Act apply, is to, I think, emasculate the
very purpose that Congress had in mind which was to reach the
State official himself for the. effect of what he did. And
this Court has never held, for example, in dealing with police
officers in Monroe v, Pape or in Egan v. City of Aurora, or
any of those cases, that because they were acting under color
of a valid statute that therefore for some reason they were
immune.

That would be inconsistent, I think, with the entire

purpose of the Civil Rights Act*

They were conducting actions,

not under a statute, but under oath which were unconstitutional
which violated the .rights of those individuals and therefore
they were held inappropriately so by this Court to be within
the purpose and intent of the Civil Rights Act.
It seems to me that cases like Ex parte Young,
Sterling v. Constantinr Griffin v. Board of Prince Edward

11

County,

all the way ranging from the passage of the Civil

Rights Act right up to the present time have all held that where
an iiijunction is the appropriate form of redress, that the Civil
Rights Act maizes no distinction between damages and injunction.
That issue has been raised here, and I don’t think there is any
difference because Sterling

specifically holds that an injunc­

tion is a more extraordinary remedy and damages are a less
extraordinary remedy.
this Court.

And other cases have so held as well of

And I don’t see the difference.

It depends on

the remedy that’s needed, it would seem, and on the damage that
has been done and not upon the nature of the relief sought.
Congress never intended, as I read the legislative history, as
interpreted by this Court, to make a distinction between damages
and injunctive relief as to whether or not there is immunity.
I have never read that in any of the decisions and I don’t think
it's supportable by any of the rules of law that have been
promulgated by this Court.

And I am thinking of cases like

Mitchum v. Foster and Monroe v. Pape,

Zwickler v. Koota, and

particularly of the various circuits like McLaughlin v. Tilindis,
Jenkins v. Averette was a damage action? many cases under the
Civil Rights Act involved damages where damages is the
appropriate remedy.
What I think is critical here

only of the Ohio Constitution, but of the Federal Constitution.
QUESTION:
1983 action?

What standard do you think applies in a

I know you allege in the complaint the intentional

wrongs, certainly you think that would state a cause of action.
How much farther would the section reach, would you say?
MR. SINDELL:

It seems to me, Mr. Justice White, in

this regard -- and I don't mean to not answer your question,
but I do want to emphasise that we couldn't have alleged any­
thing stronger.

But taking it a step down, it seems to me that

perhaps negligence in the tort sense may not be appropriate
QUESTION;

You would say if it were reasonable for a

person to understand that a certain act did not violate the law,
he hasn't been negligent?
MR,

SINDELL:

Well, that's the tort standard, as I

understand it, reasonable conduct under the circumstances.
QUESTION;

So it really doesn't depend on how it

finally turns out whether it violated the law or not?
MR. SINDELL:

Well, I think that it's critical to>

as you point out, I think it's critical to an interpretation
of the Civil Rights Act to ask what the state of mind of the
person you are suing is in addition to what the result was.
A mere accident can cause a terrible tragedy and yet not
create liability.

It is my suggestion to this Court that the

appropriate standard that occurs to me for a police type

13

situation is in Jenkins v. Avere tie, a case of the Fourth
Circuit, I believe, where it was held, and in that particular
case an act of wanton misconduct, a very high degree of reckless
ness, was sufficient to establish a cause of action -—
QUESTION:

It would require at least that.

MR. SINDELLs
yes.

At least a high degree of recklessness,

I would say that would be the appropriate standard.

But

I would not suggest to you that a lower standard is not possible
I am simply saying that as the state of this case is now, I
don't see how we could have alleged anything stronger.

And

that's really what I am suggesting in this particular situation.

being sought from the State treasury at all.
rendered

No money is

No judgment

in this case will require a State official to take

any action or prohibit a State official from taking any action.
This is not an action even against

State officials.

The

present defendants in this case aren't even officials of the
State of Ohio at all.

And I would suggest that the entire

body of 11th Amendment law as I read it suggests that in such
a case where the individual act is allegedly unconstitutional,
that that is not barred by the 11th Amendment.

And I think

Sterling specifically so holds.
What is being attempted, and I think this is the

14
critical distinction here, and if I understand the defendant's
argument, is that we shouldn't just consider these things, but
we should ask ourselves what will be the effect on the Governor
in the future, how fearful will the Governor be, the chief
executive be, or other executives below him, and I might add
it goes all the way down to the trigger man in this particular
case.

The court held everyone to be immune, not just the

Governor.

But let's ask that question.

What will be the

effect,that the State government will not be able to operate,
that people will be fearful, that they will have to come in
and defend lawsuits, and so on and so forth, if I understand
that argument correctly?
And I would have this to answer to it.

I would say

that that argument can be made in every single case under 1983.
There is no case where it cannot be argued that the effect of
suing an individual for damages for violating constitutional
rights, be he the Governor or anyone else, would not have some
effect on the future conduct, would not give them some pause
for concern, would not inconvenience them in some way.

But

it is my suggestion that that was exactly what Congress had in
mind, that x%ras the very effect that was intended.

Congress

passed the Civil Rights Act in part to deter this very kind of
thing.

And if we are to give meaning to that enactment, I

think we have to recognize that the purpose and intent of that
particular enactment was to effectuate the deterrence

15
that any tort remedy has.
sanctioned court.

And this is a congressional!*/

As I understand section 1983, it is for the

compensatory tort action as well as having a deterrent effect,
and the deterrent effect tnat is complained of he.re is the very
purpose of the enactment in the first place.

And so to say

that because it has an effect, that should be the reason to
bar suit,for that reason alone, it seems to me that that runs
completely contrary to the whole intent.

It seems to me that

if this Court should hold that — and we have sued the State
of Ohio which has immunized itself

in the State court —

if this Court holds that tills, too, is an action against the
State, then we are really left without a remedy, we have no
place to go.

Then this Court has permanently and forever

foreclosed any right to appear in a court of law anywhere againsi

This is our last

There will be none.

We can’t

sue the State in its own courts and we can't sue — if this
Court holds that we can't sue here, we are without redress.
Finally, I would like to conclude with the question
of immunity as it applies to legislators and judges and that
has been raised, and I am cognizant of Pierson v. Ray and
Tenney v. Brandhove.

But I think this is very important.

First of all, let me say that I have some empathy xvith the
dissenting opinions of Mr, Justice Douglas in those cases that

And

It is an open process,

But such is not the case with an executive.

In the

case of an executive, you have a situation where the actions

The Governor in

theory can in his own chamber secretly without making it public
open up and decide to wield the weapons of death without any
such legislative or judicial process as a result of which the
instant action of a bullet terminates a youngster or man or
anyone's life.
Wow, it seems to me that the executive immunity as

17

applied in that situation is clearly distinguishable from what
occurs with a legislator and with a judge.

And under those

circumstances, I suggest to you that to say that they are all
in the same kind is contrary to the purpose of the Civil Rights
Act itself.

I would like to reserve whatever remaining time I have,
unless there are questions, for rebuttal.

the Court, I would like to make just a preliminary remark as
to my posture in this case.

While I am of counsel in both

the prior case which has just been heard and the Krause and

13

Miller cases which are being heard together at this time, I
represent Governor Rhodes in his individual capacity, and I am
fully cooperative with all defense counsel in this case, and
I endorse my brother Charles Brown's argument in all respects.
There are some things that I believe are applicable
peculiarly to Governor Rhodes which ought to be brought to the
attention of the Court.

I am prepared, to answer questions on

any aspect of the case, but my argument in chief will be
addressed to Governor Rhodes’ position primarily.
There has been a great deal of talk about the case of
Sterling v. Constantin as it may have limited or may not have

"By virtue of his duty to cause the

laws to be faithfully executed, the executive is appropriately
vested with the discretion to determine whether an exigency
requiring military aid for that purpose has arisen,

llis decision

to that effect is conclusive.”
How, the way Sterling v. Constantin arose, there
were stipulations and there was evidence taken which made it
appear to the court, to the district court, which had also had
some prior jurisdiction on some of the same controversy, that
this exercise of discretion on the part of the Governor of
Texas was not in entire good faith, that is, it was not within
the limits of his discretionary power since he was using it for

19

the purpose of controlling the production of oil even though
the expression was made that there were tumultuous coxaditions.
‘She proclamat ion, I might say, in the Sterling case is very
similar to the proclamation in the instant case.
speaking of the proclamation of April 29, 1970.

That is,I am
But in this

case the Governor was exercising his executive discretion with
respect to calling out the Guard and had proclaimed that there
were riotous conditions, that there was tumult, there was
danger to persons and property, and this the Court of Appeals
and the District Court felt was a matter of judicial notice,
that there was sufficient notoriety in the situation of the
campuses in Ohio and indeed throughout the Nation in May of
1970 that the court could not affect to be ignorant of the
situation.
My brother, Mr, Sindell, has made a very emotional
argument with respect, and running pretty much along the lines
of

his brief, but he does not get into the actual allegations

of the complaint.

If one goes to the actual allegations of the

complaint, one must find that there are only mere conclusions
as to the part which Governor Rhodes took in the matter other
than the fact that

he did issue a proclamation and that he

did call out the Guard.
In order to state a cause of action, — I can understc
that the question might be anticipated just what can a plaintiff
do?

Suppose a Governor maliciously and corruptly,wantonly, and

20

evilly, let us say, decides to call out the National Guard for
the specific purpose of extinguishing a life.

If he does that,

surely there are facts which could be stated in the complaint
other than the bare conclusion that the defendant conspired
to deprive the plaintiff, or the decedent, of their civil
rights in each of these cases.

There must be other facts

available which could be pleaded which
situation.

would support that

Obviously there are not, and obviously there was

a situation in which it could not be reasonable to conclude
from the allegations of the complaint itself, in either of
these cases, or in any of these cases, that the Governor
conspired and evilly, corruptly, and we can use other adverbs,
to deprive these decedents of their civil rights.
These conclusions are not reasonable under the facts
well pleaded in the complaint, and therefore we submit that the
judgment of the District Court below and that the judgment of
the Court of Appeals, the majority of the two, was correct
that the 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss was properly sustained.
We submit further that there are other reasons on
which looking only at Governor Rhodes' particular situation,
one must conclude reasonably from the allegations of the
complaints that there were substantial intervening causes, if
anything, in connection with Governor Rhodes' proclamation which
caused the death of these unfortunate people.

There were

intelligent intervening substantial forces which intervened

21

between the proclamation which is all that is actually shown
to have been promulgated by Governor Rhodes -

Therefore, on

other grounds, the motion to dismiss would properly have been
sustained.
I submit also that the question of whether a State
employee, if a National Guardsman be an employee, or a State
officer, whether the doctrine of respondeat superior applies.
And in this instance we submit that there is no authority for
applying the doctrine of respondeat superior so as to bring
Governor Rhodes within the ambit of a proper action against him
in these cases.
And for all of those reasons, and for the reasons
my brother Mr. Brown has set forth, I would say that Governor
Rhodes is in an a fortiori situation with respect to all of the
defendants.

We must bear in mind that there are only seven

defendants in this case.

There are, as Mr* Sindell referred

to them, the trigger men, there are no persons alleged to have
been trigger men in these instances, and those must be taken
_
•R .
as
as admissions in the brief and/judicial admissions that there
-

*

are no .persons who are so charged in this case.
So with respect to Governor Rhodes, any liability
which applies to him must be on the

doctrine of respondeat

superior which we suggest is clearly not applicable.
I ha.ve nothing further to argue —
QUESTION:

The point of the allegation was that he

ordered out the National Guard onto that campus at a time
when he himself knew, or should have known, that arming them
with live ammunition, sending them there in their state of
training was an imminent danger to the lives of the students
on that campus, and that's alleging personal culpability on
his part, not on any doctrine of respondeat superior, isn't
that correct under the circumstances?
MR. ALLOWAY:

I would say, if the arming of the

National Guard is in and of itself is a culpable act, yes,
just as he is personally charged with having issued the
proclamation which called out the Guard.
culpable act, he is culpable.

Yes, if that is a

I submit that neither of those

acts is one on which culpability can arise, because the
training cf the Guard is — and this is a matter of judicial
notice and is in the record — that the training of the Guard
is under the supervision of the United States Government and
was at that time.

The training of the Guard was the

responsibility of the United States military officers, and the
duty, the constitutional and statutory duty of Governor Rhodes
was to call out tne Guard, and the arming of the Guard and
the actions of the Guard were the responsibility of the
individuals and of any commanding officers who issued commands.
I would submit that the act of calling out an armed
Guard is the risk that one takes any time a National Guard
•unit is called out.

It is within the realm of possibility

23

that in the discretion of officers having discretion, there
may be live ammunition used,
QUESTION:

Of course, we are dealing, Mr. Allaway,

are we not, with the allegations of the complaint?
MR, ALLOWAY:
QUESTION:

Yes.

For the purposes of this case in its

present posture, under well-settled principles of law, we must
assume they are all true, all those well-pleaded allegations
are true in fact.

That is correct, isn’t it?

Yes, it is certainly an accepted

And I would place strong emphasis on the

matter of the words "well pleaded," because I would submit that
this Court should not approve retrospectively or prospectively
the irresponsible use of inflammatory language in pleadings
and therefore then take the allegations as true.
QUESTION:

Of course, the claim of your brother on the

other side is that a very serious error was made by the Court
of Appeals when they disregarded the allegations of the complain
and instead called upon what they understood to be their
personal knowledge or judicial knowledge of what the true facts
were, and that the majority of the Court of Appeals therefore
violated

what

you and I have just agreed is a fundamental,

24
very elementary principle of law that on a motion to dismiss
the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint are assumed to
be true.
MR. ALLOWAY:

Plus, if your Honor, please, matters of

which the court can properly take judicial notice.

And the

only fact which I am suggesting ■—
QUESTION:

I can understand that if a complaint

depended upon the plaintiff's allegation that he was Napoleon
Bonaparte, for example, that a court could presume that that
probably wasn't true, but beyond extreme cases like that, how
many exceptions are there to this rule?
MR. ALLOWAY:

I would say, your Honor, that one

exception to the rule would certainly be the situation of the
campuses in the State of Ohio and over the country generally
in May of 1970, and that there were at those times riotous
situations where unusual measures had to be taken.
QUESTION:

That may well all be very true.

As a

matter of fact, we have here a lawsuit in which a complaint was
filed making certain allegations which, as I read them, are
not emotionally charged allegations.
allegations.

They are very serious

And a motion to dismiss.

What you say may all

be very true, as a mattex* of fact it may all come out in a
trial.

But this is a motion to dismiss a complaint.
MR. ALLOWAY:
QUESTION;

That is correct.

Didn’t the court err in saying, well,

25
whatever the complaint may say , we know the real facts are
such and such, and therefore, the District Court was correct
in dismissing the complaint.
MR, ALLOVJAY;

If the court did commit error in respect

of its statements, nevertheless the judgment of the court takinc
the narrowest construction of any judicial notice which it has
a right to take was sufficient, on which to dismiss the
complaint.

I would say, your Honor, that, for instance, the

proclamation of Governor Rhodes is a document of which judicial
notice could and should properly have been taken, and that the
facts well pleaded plus properly judicially noticed facts are
sufficient.
Now, I would suggest, for instance, if the Court
please, that if we are going to take facts well pleaded, and
let’s say that we have to allege in order to plead a cause of
action that there were no roving bands of men bent upon
destruction of

property and endangering life, that allegation

might have been made, but it was not made.

That would not

have been a conclusion, that would have been a statement of
fact.

X would submit that it's a conclusion that the plaintiff’

attorney could not in good conscience have made, but it would
be a statement of fact.

That would be one.

If we would take, for instance, a statement that the
ROTC building did not burn down the night before in the city
of Kent, that would be an allegation of fact.

It would not be.

26
an allegation which the plaintiff could in good conscience make,
but it would be an allegation of fact which would support the
complaint beyond the support that it needs, beyond the support
which it does not have.
QUESTION;

Are you saying that the court could take

judicial notice of the specific item you have just mentioned,
namely, the burning of the ROTC building?
MR. ALLOWAY:

I would say,if the Court please, that

the court could take judicial notice of generally disorderly
conditions in the area of Kent, Ohio, including the Kent
University campus.
where Sterling v.

Therefore, that v/e are in the situation
Constantin applies to make the action of

the Governor of Ohio not reviewable.

It not being reviewable,

I would say further that the natural consequences of his act
are also not reviewable under the doctrine of executive
immunity, and that the court had sufficient before it to make
those determinations of fact in a general way

Whetner or not

the court could take judicial notice of the specific fact of
the burning of the ROTC building.
that it could.

I would be of the opinion

That was a widely known fact.

That was perhaps

almost as widely known a fact, certainly as widely known in
the midwest area as the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack
Ruby.

The burning of the ROTC building was a notorious event

viewed by millions of people.
QUESTION?

Could the court take judicial notice that

27
there was "insurrection” on the campus at Kent?
MR. ALLOWAY :

I would say that the court might do so,

although I don't think it's necessary for the court to do that,
because insurrection is not a sine qua non of the proper
exercise of the discretionary power of the Governor to call out
the Guard.
QUESTION:
judicial notice?

Well, my point is is it outside of the

It can take judicial notice that Kent'

University is there or there are 18 buildings, but insurrection
is a rather complicated

legal term, which is the basis of the

lawsuit,
MR. ALLOWAY%

It is a very complicated term.

I

don’t think it is a term which we necessarily must find in order
to find the judgment of the Court of Appeals and of the
District Court correct,
QUESTION:

Well, of all of the other terms that

were in the Governor's proclamation, can the court take
judicial notice that they are correct?
HR. ALLOWAY:

I am sorry, I don't believe I follow

that.
QUESTION;

Didn't the proclamation say there was

insurrection and this and that, the Governor's proclamation?
MR. ALLOWAY:
QUESTION:

Yes,

Well, can the court take judicial notice

that thoose statements are facts that are true?

.28
MR, ALLOWAY:

I will have to confess to you I have

not thought about it, and I think that I would say probably
not; that your Honor has just said that the terra "insurrection”
is a very complicated terra which is widely embracing and has
many legal consequences.
QUESTION;

It is a legal conclusion, not a fact.

MR. ALLOWAY;

It is a conclusion and not a fact,

that's correct.
QUESTION:

But in this case we have positive allega­

tions on one side and on the other side all you have is the
Governor's proclamation, right?
MR, ALLOWAY;

Well, we have the Governor's proclama­

tion, but we have some specific facts in the Governor's
proclamation, that in the territory of northeastern Ohio there
were roving bands of raen who were committing acts of violence,
QUESTION:

Can the court take that as true?

MR. ALLOWAY:
It is a fact.

I think the court can take that as true.

That is it is a fact as distinguished from a

conclusion,
QUESTION:

So whatever the Governor says is a fact,

but whatever the petitioners say is not?

While to the contrary

the rules say that you must get all well-pleaded facts in. one
paper.

It doesn't say anything about that other paper.
MR. ALLOWAY:

Again, I respectfully emphasise the

words "well pleaded," and I submit that if the Court will

29
examine each complaint, it will find that the "facts" are
conclusions*
QUESTION %

But the court went off on the merits,

it didn't go off on the fact it wasn't well pleaded.
MR, ALLOWAYs

Yes, that's true.

I have nothing further,
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Sindell, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN

h,

SINDELL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SINDELL:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I do.

First of all, I would like to indicate to the Court,
if the Court, will examine the proclamations of the Governor,
it will find that the one that is applicable to the Kent State
incident which is the May 5th proclamation after it occurred
does not mention anything about roving bodies of men.
referred to a truckers' strike.

That

There may well have been

roving bodies of men and that had nothing to do with Kent
State.

It didn't even include Portage County, although it

included vast other areas of the State of Ohio,

The fact is

that the Governor's proclamation at no time even mentions the
word "insurrection."

It doesn't even, if we want to talk about

well-pleaded facts, the Governor's proclamation has no facts
which give rise to a conclusion that there was a state of
insurrection or riot of any kind.

It simply refers to disorders

30

Now, I want to be perfectly clear about our contention
here.

It is not our contention that the Governor is liable

under the Federal Civil Rights Act because he called out troops.
That is not our claim.

We are claiming, and what hasn’t been

read by my brother in connection with Sterling v. Constantin,
that hasn’t been read, is fchiss

While the calling out of the

troops is unreviewable, according to that case, it goes further
and it says that it does not follow from the fact that the
executive has this range of discretion deemed to be a
necessary incident of his power to suppress disorder, that
every sort of action the Governor may take, no matter how
unjustified by the exigency or subversive of private right
and the jurisdiction of the courts otherwise available, is
conclusively supported by mere executive fiat.
The contrary is well established.

What are the

allowable limits of military discretion and whether or not they
have been overstepped in a particular case are judicial
questions, and that is what we are contending in this case.
And I would like to address myself to this matter of
pleading and what is well pleaded and what isn’t pleaded.
I understand, at least as a trial practitioner who engages in
some amount of litigation, I have always understood that the
basic concept is notice pleading, that we are not required
to plead filings of evidence or any evidence really.
always heard

I have

it was improper to plead evidence as such

31

and that largely the Federal rules are designed to confine
the pleadings to the general allegations.
Now, we have alleged a conspiracy to engage in a
direct act which involved deaths of people, and included in
that concept are orders and judgments and statements in their
facts that we believe exist in good faith to back it up.
Now, what I am simply suggesting is this;

If it

wasn’t well pleaded enough for my brother, Mr. Alloway, then
he had the prerogative under rule 12(e) to tell me that and
to make a motion to make definite and certain and to ask me to
be more specific if I didn't plead it well enough.

all

acts herein mentioned, including every one of them, the shootih
and everything else, were done individually and in conspiracy
by these defendants with the specific intent of depriving

plaintiff and plaintiff decedents of their rights

to due proecu

I contend that if that doesn't state a violation of
constitutional rights, then nothing does.

How, if he wants it

more specific than that, then I suggest that he ask me what he
wants, that he tell me that it's too vague, and that's a
question of pleading.

But what I have said here in its

\

allegation form and in its notice form is well pleaded in the
concept of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to give notice.
And let's be practical about it, I sit in an office that has
four walls and I look at what

I „, know

at the time I plead,

and I know that the Governor was down there, that he was
involved in this event, that he ’was personally present, that
he was giving orders, was doing a lot of things.
