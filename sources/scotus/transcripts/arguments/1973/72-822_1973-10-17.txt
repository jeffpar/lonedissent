ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. HARRIET S. SHAPIRO
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, this case is hare on a writ of certiorari to the
District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals on the petition
of the Renegotiation Board,

Act claims are not. before this Court,
In order to evaluate the issues in this case, it is
important to understand the natura of the Renegotiation Act
proceedings.

The Renegotiation Act requires the Board to try

to ranch an agreement with Government contractors concerning
the amount of excess profits they have earned which they should
refund to the Government.
The Board is involved in negotiations essentially
in offers of settlement rather than in adjudications on the
merits of these claims.

They attempt to reach settlement by

a series of essentially five different negotiating levels within
the Board, the regional Board and national Board: , and you
negotiate through five levels.
giving financial statements.

The contractor submits statements
The Board then considers -the

statements,, meets with the contractor, and makes an offer in
settlement.

The contractor is then entitled to a statement

giving the basis for that settlement offer in order for him to
determine whether ha wishes to accept it or to require the
Board to negotiate again at a higher level,

of course, at

each level the Board may increase or decrease the amount of
the offer in settlement.
QUESTIOK s

If the contractors accepts the first level

\

offer, Mrs. Shapiro, is that then binding on the Government?
MRS. SHAT5IRO 5

Yes.

If no settlement is reached within the Board, the

4
Board issues an assessment,, a determination of the amount of
the contractor's liability.

Then the contractor is entitled

•to a trial on the merits in the Court of Claims,

That trial

The Government must prove the amount of the

contractor's liability, and Idle proceedings in the Board are
simply not relevant, to the Court of Claims determination.
Of course, the contractor when he gets to the Court of Claims

^

is entitled to use the Court of Claims’ discovery procedures.
QUESTION:

And may they use these documents?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

To the extent that they were relevant

and ware not otherwise privileged, yes.
QUESTION;

They are not work product or anything?

MRS, SHAPIRO:
therefore privileged.

Seme of them way be work product and
Th© Court of Claims’ discovery procedures

are as broad as the Freedom of Information Act.
QUESTION;

They would be adequate for anything not

privileged?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Mrs. Shapiro, then, is the only real issue

hare whether this sort of thing has to wait until it gets to
the Court of Claims ^before they are entitled to these documents?
MRS, SHAPIRO:

The question is whether cr not the

Board proceedings can be enjoined.
QUESTION:

I am just wondering if all we are talking

about substantially is they can't have this kind of discovery

5

at this stage.

However, they can come back in and get*, it.

If they are to have any discovery, they will have to wait until
the case, if it does, gets to the Court of Claims.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

That’s really all this is about, isn’t it?

QUESTION:

Well, I’m not star© that you would say

they could have the remedies under the Freedom of Information
Act,

Then the thing is the administrative proceeding has to

go on.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

The administrative proceeding has to

Certainly, the Court of Claims wouldn't be

acting under the Freedom of Information Act; they would be acting
under their discovery procedures.
QUESTION

Mrs. Shapiro, what in your estimation are

these particular contractors seeking here?

Is it information

as to comparative costs with respect to competitors, or something?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

That's part of it.

Their requests

What they requested were documents related

to the renegotiation procedure, the exact scop© of which
documents they want, whether or not they are entitled to them
is a question in the Court of Claims.

But they are very broad

QUESTION:

Information Act certainly, all of the post World War II,

MRS. SHAPIRO?

That's right, yes.

These documents

not documents which the Renegotiation Board ordinarily

supplies.
QUESTION?

But you can’t describe them any more

definitively than in these broad terms?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, not really.

This Court held in Aircraft & Diesel Equipment Corp.
v, llirsch that, then© proceedings were not to be enjoined even
when in that case the contractor alleged that he had bean
unable to participate effectively in the proceedings because
he did not have information upon which the Board had relied.
The Court nevertheless found that Congress had intended the
entire negotiation ending with the adjudication was supposed
to be completed without judicial interference.
QUESTION:

It’s very broad.

And if you got in a discovery proceedings

MRS. SHAPIRO;

Well, certainly, you would have

would also have a great deal of trouble on. the breadth of
that in the Freedom of Information Act.

at. least to the extent permitting temporary injunctions

against Board procedures while Freedom of information Act
questions were litigated.
Our contention is that this is a misinterpretation of
the Freedom of Information Act.

The Freedom of Information

Act was not designed to permit courts to review agency

\J

rulings on the scope of discovery in pending proceedings.
The Freedom of Information Act was specifically intended to
change the rule that had existed before that those properly

8

and directly concerned had a greater right to agency records
than others.

Instead the Freedom of Information Act indicated

that all members of the public have an equal right to the use
of agency records regardless of the use that they intend to
make of them.
The contractors her® claim that the special use they
wish to make of these records entitles them to a special
remedy.

But what the Act says is that all members of the

public have an equal right to a prompt resolution of their
claims of entitlement to documents.

Congress provided a very

specific remedy to protect the specific right which they
established.
of speed.

And in that remedy, they emphasised the importance

They provided that suits to compel the production

of documents should be given priority on the District Court's
docket and expedited in every way.
If the remedy which the court, below found is
permitted, it will tip the balance that Congress established.
Instead of making the Freedom of Information Act claims
promptly determined, instead it will become a very effective
tool for delay, for one© people in the position of the
contractors here have obtained a stay of the proceeding which
threatens them, 'they have no interest in the prompt resolution
of their claims under the Freedom of Information Act.
Instead, their interest is entirely in delaying the resolution
of these claims and therefore delaying the continuation of the

9

administrativa procedure which could affect them adversely.
Sven if stays are rarely granted, the existence of the
jurisdictions to grant the remedies will encourage litigation.
This is a possible means of obtaining a delay of the agency
action.
We therefore contend that the issuance of injunctions
against agency,continuation of agency proceedings, is not
consistent with the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act,
and that fch© court below expanded on the Act and acted
legislatively rather than judicially.
have concluded

Certainly Congress could

that specific uses to be made of the information

justified specific protections.

They could have concluded

that the interests of those involved in agency proceedings were
so important that it was appropriate to require the court to
review agency rulings on the scope of discovery in pending
proceedings.

w© contend that the Act simply doesn’t do so,

that if it had intended to change the traditional allocation
of responsibilities between agencies and courts, they would
have said so clearly.
intent.

And there is no indication of any such

We do not believe that the issuance of injunctions

in these cases was consistent with the traditional equitable
power to maintain the status quo, because in this case it
was not a situation in which a court has acted to stay agency
action while it determines the validity of that agency action.
Instead what they did was to stay the agency proceedings while

10
they reviewed the validity of collateral agency action.

In

effect, they stayed, the Renegotiation Board proceedings while
they reviewed the Board1s determination of the proper scope
of discovery.

And this is certainly not a traditional

exercise of equitable power.
In sum, as this Court recognised last term in
.Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, the Freedom of
Information Act provides a workable formula which carefully
protects and balances all interests.

The Act protects the

public interest in prompt access to Government records.

It

also protects the public interest in minimal interference
with efficient Government operations.
The specific remedy that they provided is an important
part of this balance.

Tha additional remedy that the court

below added upsets this careful balance and it does it not
in order to achieve the purposes of the statute to the prompt
availability of Government records, but instead to give the
contractors a specific benefit in their negotiations with the
Board.

This is simply not consistent with the purposes of the

Act.
The court below nevertheless found that the District
Court had properly exercised *»- not only that it had jurisdiction
to enjoin agency proceedings under the Freedom of Information
Act, but that it had properly exercised this jurisdiction
since, unless the proceedings, renegotiation proceedings, were

11
an joined, the contractors would be irreparably injured if
they were compelled to .negotiate without the information they
wanted, since there was no review as such of the proceedings
in the Court of Claims,

They are not subject to the

So the contractors are not entitled to the most

And that is what is provided in the

Renegotiation Act.
Furthermore, the fact that the review in the Court

injury if they don’t get the information before.

are

In one sense they

in a batter position than they would be .if there was a

review proceeding in the Court of Claims, since the Court of
Claims does not need to consider whether there is substantial
evidence to support the Board's procedures and they need not
show that they received any prejudice from the Board's
procedures.
In short, the Board procedures can impose no continuing
disadvantage on the contractors.

And therefore, the enjoining

of those procedures was improper.
I would like to reserve the rest of my time for
rebuttal.
mi. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mrs. Shapiro.

Mr. Ackerly.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. ACKERLY ON BEHALF
OF RESPONDENTS BAMMERCRAFT CLOTHING COMPANY,
INC.: ASTRO C0MI1UNICATI0NS LABORATORY, A
DIVISION OF. AIKEN INDUSTRIES, INC.
MR. ACKERLYs

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, I would like to at the outset note sharp disagreement
with a couple of statements of Government counsel.
First, the regulations of the Board as they were
amended last November, November of 1972, in fact provide that
from now on a contractor on request will get all of the
information, I believe, that Bannercraft asked for and most of

13

th& information that the other contractors asked for.

For

example, in 32 C.F.R., section 1472.7, the regulations of the
Board now provide that a con-tractor may have on request the
performance information.

That is, the performance evaluation

of other agencies of Government,

or, in the case of a

subcontractor-prime contractor relationship, the performance
information provided by prims contractor on the level of
performance of the subcontractor.
QUESTION:

Do those regulations just apply to future

cases or to yours, too?
MR. ACKERLY:

I don't know, your Honor.

I think

the Board —*
QUESTION:

Well, let's assume they did apply to your

case and that you could get all of this information that you
wanted right now, what would ba left of this case?
MR. ACKERLY:

Well, assuming that the Board complies

fully with their own regulations and with the further decision
of the Court of Appeals in Grumman Aircraft this summer, I think
there is nothing left of this case.
QUESTION:

What's Grumman got to do with it?

MR. ACKERLY:
QUESTION:

Well, Grumman decided in July of —

i take it your point was that there are

new regulations which give you everything you want.
MR. ACKERLYs
implemented by Grumman.

Yes, sir.

New regulations, yes, as

The Grumman decision simply says —

14
QUESTION;

Wei 1, you haven't got much of a point

based on the regulations,- then, because I suppose Grunsttan is
just a court decision.
MR, ACKERLY:

Grumman is a decision of the United

States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia which only
relates to one portion.
I might direct the Court's attention to section 1480.5
of the regulations.

There are 15 categories of documents

that are now made available by the Renegotiation Board that
were not made available when we first filed this lawsuit.
They do include agreements determining excessive profits, orders
determining excessive profits, statement of facts and the
reasons issued by the Board, and so on.
How, at the bottom of that section it says this —

Well, have you

The Board denied our request.

There is no time

period that I know of within which w© could go back and ask

15
for r «consideration.
QUESTION :

You normally would, I suppos a, if there

had bean a change of the regulation in your favor.
MR. ACKERLY:

Well, I think this is a change in the

regulation in our favor, but for some reason the Board —
QUESTION:

If it falls generally in the area of a

procedural regulation as this does, normally now procedures
apply to pending cases.
MR. ACKERLY:

I am not sura of the Board’s point of

view, your Honor, but I would assume if the Board wanted to,
they could have communicated — they gave us some documents
which were worthless, and the District Court so found.

They

could have simply responded further to our request that was
pending before the Board and said, ”W© are going to make
available these documents."

We may or may not have had an

issue left before the District Court.

If we had one, it would

have been very narrow, I submit, because the only issue left,
really, is the issue which was decided by the Court of Appeals
in Grumman.
Of course, X can’t predict how tha Board is going to
apply the regulations, but I assume that if the Board complied
with the spirit of the regulations as implemented by Grumman,
that we would have very little remaining at issue.

But these

documents are not only available under the Freedom of Information
Act, but they are critically important to the conduct of

16
renegotiation.

And there again —

QUESTION:

VJhy

didn’t

you say that when you

renegotiated —• didn’t have them in 1950, and renegotiations,
it seems to me, want off pretty successfully?
MR. ACKERLY:
QUESTION:

Well —

At least we thought they did.

HR. ACKERLY:

Well, the Freedom of Information Act,

if the Court please, I submit is an important national policy
which should be read in conjunction with all existing statutes,
and it’s clearly applicable to the Renegotiation Board.

There

is no argument there. The^Renegotiation Board should not be
permitted to ignore its responsibilities under the Freedom of
Information Act and continue the negotiations.

Because the

importance of these documents comes down to this:
QUESTION:

Have any of your clients pursued relief

as a member of the general public as distinguished from a
contractor in renegotiation?
HR, ACKERLY:

No, your Honor, and I -™ well, there

is only one group that I know of, not our clients, but only
one group that I know of, and that's a group of Georgetown
students.

Thsir request resulted in the decision of the
V73 i'll /&1

Court of Appeals in Fisher v. Renegotiation Board.

It is

unlikely that any public interest group would request documents
from the Board except maybe a group of law students or an
affected contractor.

I think in some sense we are in there

17
not only in our own behalf, but in the concept of a private
attorney general,

Ws are suggesting that the Renegotiation

Board roust follow th© Praedoni of Information Act.

That seems

like a very reasonable and plausible proposition.

And the

court below found that the Renegotiation Board was not following
the Freedom of Information Act.

And the simple question is?

Should they be allowed to proceed with renegotiation?
How, as the Court of Appeals —•
QUESTION:

Mr. Ackerly, the Freedom of Information

Act. gives you plenty of remedy as a private attorney general
or as a citizen.

I mean, going to District Court and making

th© Board comply with the Freedom of Information Act, that is
not a reason by itself for staying the administrative proceeding,
I would think.
MR. ACKERLY:
your Honor is correct.

Well, precisely, if the Court please,
There is plenty of relief in the

Freedom of Information Act.

However, there is nothing in the

Freedom of Information Act that says that th© court does not
hava a general equity power to consider whether the renegotiation:
should stay for a short period of time-, th© renegotiation
process, but it seems clear on the face of it, and I submit
on the face of the regulations now it5s abundantly clear, that
they are ignoring their responsibilities under

the other Act.

This is just a traditional exercise of th© equity power where,
as I think wa established,irreparable injury can accrue by

18
virtue of the Board’s refusal to follow the statute.

The

Board has bean told in numerous cases that they must follow
the statute.

There are several Federal court decisions and

appellate court decisions instructing the Board to follow tha
statute, and

now they have don© so in their regulations.

We

don't suggest that there is any authority in the Freedom of
Information Act to grant this type of an injunction, but we
say that when the failure of an agency to follow its own
regulations

or follow the statute is brought to tha attention

of the court, the court does have general equity pov?er , which
can be exercised only in very limited circumstances.
I wish to point out that as this Court has held and
as tlie Court of Appsals in the District of Columbia has held
repeatedly, where there is judicial review of tha agency
process, the court should not entertain interlocutory appeal
except in very rare, special circumstances,
with that.

we have no quarrel

The NLRB cases, the other agency cases where there

is statutory review, there you gat review in the Court of
Appeals of a denial of due process or denial of procedural or
substantive errors.

We don't get that here.

Counsel said in response to you, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
that if we agree with the first level of renegotiation, is the
Government bound?

They are not bound.

The statutory Board

can at any time •—■ and they have done this to me on more than
one occasion

set aside an agreement with a Regional Board,

19
at least after a conference with the renegotiator, and assign
the case to itself and go through the entire process all over
again.

And understand, we get no understanding of what the

Board is doing until after the fact.
Let me try to explain.

W© have a meeting with the

It is after they have made their

Then we go to the statutory Board and the same

procedure obtains.
QUESTION:

You say that even if you decided to pay

over the $1,400,000 they asked you for, the statutory Board
might still have transferred the case to itself and imposed a
higher amount?
MR. ACKERLY:
and they have done it.

They absolutely have that authority,
I have a hearing coining up in November

before the Board following an agreement with the Regional Board,
yes, sir.

The statutory Board has that authority in the

regulations.

They can reassign the case to itself at any time.

After the statutory Board makes its determination,
then you get, if on request, a statement of th© reasons for the
statutory Board action.

But there is no further negotiation.

You either pay it or you don’t.

20

Wow, the result, is a summary where the Regional
Board told us we had bean compared with other contractors as
they are required to in their awn regulations and where they
said the procurement information indicated a lack of adequate
competition.

W© wrote and asked for these documents.

We

wanted to get the documents that supported the contentions of
the Regional Board.

For example, in 1967 Bannercraft performed

four contracts, two primes and two subs.

We took the sub­

contracts on the same price or less than the prime.

Now, if

the Board did not renegotiate the prime but renegotiated us
on the same price, then we are being penalized for efficiency.
Ws have a right to examine that.
Now, I think the Board would give us that information.
I sincerely believe under their regulations they would give us
that information.

Ilaybs they don't want to apply these

regulations retroactively.

But when they tell us we have

been compared with other contractors and refuse to tell us who
they are, when they say that procurement information,
procurement documents indicate a lack of adequate competition
and refuse to give us the procurement documents, there is not
much we can do by way of renegotiation except to say, "Look,
we still think we are efficient and we still think that if you
will compare us with these primes under- whom we perform
subcontracts, we can establish that.
asked for.

That's really all we have

21
Now, how long should the

3tay

be in this case?

There needn’t be extensive delay in a case like this.

In the

first place, with the change in regulations and the status of
Grumman — and I understand the status of Grumman to be this,
that a petition for rehearing by the Government was denied,
the mandate is issued.

I thought it was final.

Lata yesterday

afternoon I heard by telephone that the Government has filed
a motion to recall the mandate.

Now, whatever degree of

finality that takes away from the case, that is its present
posture.

Th© case will never r:,s© again, even of the

Renegotiation Board, and this case can never arise with an
agency that has statutory judiciil review.

23

there Is very little.

For this contractor it's extremely

important because before we go to the Court of Claims, a final
order .is entered,

lie must post a bond equal to 100 percent ~

it’s almost like a judgment, it’s immediately collectible, if
the Court please.

The final order is not the result of a

breakdown in negotiations.
judgment of a court.

It has the effect of a final

Wa must post a bond of 100 percent of the

amount of the determination in Government bonds with the
Court of Claims to prevent collection.
So at each step of the agency process and in the
court of Claims, the demand can be raised or lowered.

Therefore,

if wa don’t have a fair opportunity to negotiate with the Board
and reach agreement, we go to the Court of Claims fully
informed, we run the risk of having that million four go to
a million seven.

We don’t have an opportunity to make a fair

judgment.
But tills is not an earth-shaking case.

This is not

a case of even great precedential value, in my judgment, because
it would only apply to agencies like the Board, and I am not
sure that there are very many that don’t have statutory review,
and, stacondiy, it probably won’t come up with the Board.
I do want to make one quick reference to Aircraft &
oiesel Equipment Carp, which counsel has raised.

That case, in

my judgment, affirms the authority of a district court to
issue an injunction, because what the court said was, the

district court had no jurisdiction in equity since the
appellant had a complete remedy at law.

Now, the complete

remedy at law that this Court was talking about was this:
Aircraft was a subcontractor.

Its prime contractors were

withholding money from Aircraft at the direction of the
Government, baaed upon a renegotiation claim.
to Aircraft, "See your prime contractor.

This Court said

And w© know of no

reason why all of the issues that you have raised before this
Court could not be raised in litigation with your prime
contractor."
Now, this Court would not have gone to the length
of saying that you have an adequate remedy at law if they
didn't recognize the inherent equity jurisdiction of the
district court to, under limited circumstances, issue a very
temporary stay.

And I emphasize, if the Board had gone back

and complied with Grumman, if the Court please, the first
Grumman decision had been entered before this preliminary
injunction was entered.
QUESTION:

The Board didn't —

Wh&n you say temporary stay, Hr. Ackerly,

you are talking about whatever time it takes to resolve the
Freedom of Information Act issue, whether that can be done by
simply the use of already established precedents or whether
it may take another district court and Court of Appeals
decision.
HR. ACKERLY:

It conceivably could, but that’s alway

And that’s an inherent power

The courts do not necessarily have to entertain

Th© Freedom of Information Act cases gat priority on

every calendar by the Act itself.

And if they feel that a

plaintiff is delaying, that court has inherent power to
dissolve the injunction.
But I am suggesting that if the Board complies with
its own regulations, these cases will not arise.

I can’t

conceive of a district court granting this type of injunction

QUESTION:

And I think that is clearly the distinction,
But the fact remains that what was

decided below is an important matter, that you can enjoin an
administrative agency as a way of enforcing Freedom of
Information Act claims.
MR. ACKERLYs

I would disagree with that a little bit,

your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, they did enjoin it, didn’t they?

MR. ACKERLYs
QUESTION:

They did, sir.

.And the Government's argument her® is

they could not have, they could not have done it.
MR. ACKERLY:

own regulations and with Grumman, and you could get what you
wanted.

Would there be anything left of the case?

And if

thara weren't,why,you would say the Court of Appeals opinion
would be set aside, wouldn’t it?
MR. ACKERLYs

No, I say if they complied with the

Freedom of Information Act, the very basis for ‘the injunction

severe consequences to a contractor, and should we let the
agency completely refuse to comply with a public policy of
Congress and yet go ahead with renegotiation which has severe

The district court said no.

The Court of Appeals said no.
I must say that on the equities of the case, I think
if it’s examined carefully, I think this Court will agree that
in this case cn its peculiar facts, on the complete defiant
refusal of the Board to make any real pretext to comply with
its important public policy, the district court's judgment was
correct.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

some of Mr. Schv/alb's time now.

28
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BURTON A. SCHWALB ON
BEIIM-F OF RESPONDENT DAVID B. LILLY
CO., INC,
HR. SCHWALB;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Court, directing myself to the point that has been raised
by the Court and by counsl and mainly by the Government, namely,
why is this case here and what is this prevailing issue that
warrants our consideration, perhaps the best way for me to put
it

is not to paraphras© it, but to quote one sentence in the

Government's brief because I think if any on© sentence in the
brief states the issue that warrants the case being here, it's
this one.
Referring now to page 15 of the Government's main
brief, I quote, about three-quarters of the way down the
tags:

"Accordingly, this is not a situation where Congress

has utilised the broad equitable jurisdiction that inheres in
courts and where the proposed exercise of that jurisdiction
is consistent with the statutory language and policy, the
legislative background and the public interest."
The reason why this statement is important, is that
the Freedom of Information Act is silent on the question of
vhether or not a plaintiff, suing under that Act, can also
enjoin an agency which is proceeding with a procedure to which
the documents r©quested relate.
situation where

a

court

What he would do in a

is given equity power in one respect

29

under a statute and the statute is silent as to any other
powers that that district judge now vested with at least partial
equity can do, what can he perform?

And I think this is why

the Government must have felt that this issue was important,
namely, Federal jurisdiction under a statute creating at least
some equity jurisdiction under the circumstances but not stating
just how far that jurisdiction goes.
How, if indeed the test is, as it seems to be, as
the Government, has set out and as the cases seem to set out,
that when a statute is silent, you don't assume that there is
no further remedy of jurisdiction.

You look at the legislative

history of the policy of the public interest, St cetera, to
see whether or not that extra power should be implied in the
Act, namely, implying it or reading it in or inferring it,
or whatever.

Does it serve a public interest?

a purpose that Congress had in mind?

Doss it serve

Because if it does, it

should be read in, and there is many a case so holds.

And I

think this is why the Government has formulated the issue as
it has on page 15, talking about legislative history, purpose,
and public interest, because its conclusion is that what the
district court did below was contrary to the legislative
history, to the purpose, to the public interest, and therefore
that kind of an injunction should not be implied, because it
undercuts rather than furthers congressional policy.
If that is the main issue, which I think it is, then

30
I want to address myself to that in the few minutes that ws
have left because I think the equities are clear.

The

Government counsel has said they are not contesting the matter
on the right to documents.

That is something that is still

left for the district court.

I think the equities are things

that are better left to the district court.

They have been

faced once on a preliminary injunction, they will be faced
again if the court case goes back.
The legislative history is something that this Court
very recently explored in the

epa v.

Mink case, and I don’t

intend to spend much time in identifying it.

There are basically

three documents that I would like to refer to.
The Freedom of Information Act as it now is was
Senate bill 1160 in the 89th Congress, First Session, and the
Senate report No. 813 that accompanied that bill said on page 7
as follows;
"Requiring the agencies to keep a current index of
their orders, opinions, at cetera, is necessary to afford the
private citizen the essential information to enable him to
deal effectively and knowledgeably with the Federal agency.
The change will prevent a citizen from losing a controversy
with an agency because of some obscure and hidden order or
opinion which the agency knows about but which has been
unavailable to the citizen simply because he had no way in
which to discover it."

31
The House report which was Hay 1966 report in the
Second Session of the 89th Congress, report No. 1497, says
very much the same thing, namely?

"a purpose to prevent a

citizen from losing a controversy with an agency."
Now, in the 88th Congress, the prior Congress, the
Senate had a similar bill.

In fact, I think, but I can't

represent it as exactly the same.

Basically the same bill

came up in the 88th Congress — in the Senate, but I think it
was passed too late to go to th© House, so it was renewed in
the 89th.

But the Senate report No, 1219 which accompanied

the bill in the 88th Congress, at page 3, said very much the
same thing.

They were talking about the old Administrative

Procedure Act, 3, which permitted disclosure but only if it
wasn't in the public interest.

They ware decrying the fact

that th© public interest exceptions or notion was being used
to shield disclosure rather than an aid, and said as follows?
"Retention of such an exception" — they were talking
now about that section 3 exception, in section 3(a) — "is
therefore inconsistent with this section's general objective
of enabling the public readily to gain access to the information
necessary to deal effectively and upon equal footing with the
Federal agencies.”
QUESTIONS

This just took away the discretionary

right of the agency to deny under the old Act, made it
available to citizens unless the agency could meet its burden

MR. SCHWALB3

I think it want far beyond that.

It.

not only limited disclosure to those documents which directly
affected a person who was in a litigative process —
QUESTION;

I am talking about the particular section

of the legislative history you just read from the report on
the bill that wasn't passed.

Is that still your answer to the

question?
MR. SCHWALB:

Well, I am not sure.

misunderstood your question.

I may have

I thought the point was did that

merely give to all citizens what had theretofore been available
only to litigants under tire Administrative Procedure Act.
ray answer is yes, it did that, except it went farther.

And

In

other words, the restrictions with respect to what kinds of
documents would be given, the matter of burden of proof, the
acceleration on court dockets, the whole notion of a speedy
and full disclosure by government agencies was endemic to this
statute which began rolling in the 88th Congress and had some
10 or 11 years of administrative history behind it.
QUESTION:

You don’t suggest the Freedom of Information

Act would give you anything more than what you would get under
discovery in the Court of Claims?
MR. SCHWALB;

That’s right, your Honor.

Thera is

a specific provision in the Freedom of Information Act which
relates it to the rules of discovery, and it —

33
QUESTION;

Sure.

So that you won't get any more than

tlie discovery miles of the court would give you.
MR. SCHWALB;

Well, that may not be so, because, for

example —
QUESTION:

I thought you just said it was.

MR. SCUWAL3:

Well, at least that, for this reasons

There is an element of relevancy or materiality in terms of
discovery under the Federal rules and certainly in court
claims.

The element of relevancy and materiality is not a

prerequisite under the Freedom of Information Act.

Consequently,

there may be -QUESTION:

Well, then, I must say you certainly

wouldn't ask for an injunction against an agency proceeding
in order to get documents that weren't relevant, would you?
MR. SCHWALBs

Clearly not.

Clearly not.

What we are saying hare is that this language in
these three reports shows a legislative purpose to do what?
To permit someone in a controversy with an agency, because
that language is right there, not to be hindered or not to lose
that controversy because he can't deal on an equal footing
or cannot deal effectively, cannot deal efficiently, or
doesn’t have the kind of information that the agency has.
is exactly what the injunction below did.

That

It was geared to

putting these respondents in a position where they could deal
on that more equal footing, more efficiently, more knowledgeably,

34
and not run the risk or losing the controversy.
Now, tills perilaps goes to the matter of legislative
history,

is the injunction, or are the injunctions below so

contrary to this legislative history of policy that the court
should assume that Congress would not have intended it and
this violates that legislative history.

We say simply, no.

•that Congress was anticipating the need of a litigant, because
they used words that involved litigants.

We know that there

is an acceleration provision, litigants often need information
quickly.

Lilly did below.

This case was brought only on the

eve of being forced to an election of how to proceed without
oven an acknowledgement that the Renegotiation Board had
received o\ir request for documents.
Nov;, there is, I would like to call the Court’s
attention, in the moment I have, to a related 1972 report
on House Committee on Government operations, No. 92-1419.

Nov/,

I am not suggesting that a House report in 1972 5.3 dispositive
of what Congress

intended or must have assumed in 1966.

But

this very lengthy report which is cited in our brief undertakes
in some 90 pages to discuss the purpose of the Act as it was,
and more important, how it operated in the six-year period
between 1966, July 1966, when the bill was first passed, and
1972.

And without residing in deta.il, I might point out that

on page 19 there is a reference to the fact that the regulations
of agencies promulgated under the statute have not bean

35
effective in obtaining or requiring the voluntary coraplianas
during this period of years,
QUESTION:

What would you say if the Renegotiation

Board wrote into its rules of procedure, if it has some, as I
take it it does, the very terms of the Freedom of Inforraati.on
Act?
MR. SCHWALB:

I think that's there already by

implication.
QUESTION:

All right.

Let’s assume this.

And than

you demanded something under paragraph so and so of these
rules.

And it was refused.

Now, normally, what is your remedy

when you lose on an effort to gat discovery?
MR. SCHWALB:

Wall, I have to answer the word

"normally” in two separate contexts because I think there is
going to be a norm depending on what the context is.

I

Let's take a norm in a situation where there is no "
review of that procedure anywhere, that is, no subsequent
procedure somewhere down the line where the propriety of that
action can be reviewed, studied, analyzed, passed upon, and
which might result in a reversal and a remand to curs.

That’s

situation (a).
Situation (b) is,where that arises, that the
administrative process under law takes us through step by step
by step and ultimately whether it be to a district court or
to a court of appeals such as the labor situation, for example,

36
where a court: of appeals, or whatever the reviewing tribunal
is, could look at the procedure.
Now, taking the first one first, a document is asked
for under the rules.

The agency, let’s assume on this hypothesis,

violatas its own rules, which by implication could break the
Act.
QUESTIONS

I don't hypothesise that at ail.

I just

say that you claim that it has.
MR. SCHWALB:

All right.

Then I think we have

basically what would be a Service y. Dulles type operation,
namely, the agency has as part of its rules an obligation to
do A, B, and C.

It has violated those rules, and that would

be
QUESTION:

Supposing it hadn't violated the rules.

The question is whether normally a discovery dispute, whether
the main proceeding may be held up while you settle the
discovery dispute.
MR. SCHWALB:

Yes, but in the situation in my

second context where we have review, the courts haven't said
there is no jurisdiction and no power.

They have said that

the evil that you are concerned about, the alleged wrong, might
very well become moot, might vary well be taken care of later
on.

Therefore, why invoke the power of the court?

its dockets?

Why clutter

Why cause the conflict and the tension between

court and agency when it might be a moot situation?

Ordinarily

37
discovery points sometimes can be looked at as no*“ a-^
critical.

But I think it makes a difference on whether or not

people like these respondents have a right to say to anybody
after the fact, "We were not given the right that a statute or
a regulation or a combination gave us.

Cure the defect by

putting us back in the status quo ante so we will be in as
good a shape as we would if the agency had complied,"

In

renegotiation it can never happen.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your time is consumed now,

Mr. Schwaib.
Do you have anything further, Mrs. Shapiro?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS,, HARRIET S,
SHAPIRO ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS. SHAPIRO:

The legislative history that counsel

pointed to indicating that under the Freedom of Information —
one of the intents of the Freedom of Information Act was to
prevent people from losing a controversy with an agency on the
basis of secret information is discussion on a section of the
Act which requires the indexing of agency opinions and
essentially agency case law, the end product of the administra­
tive actions.

That section requires not only the indexing of

these materials, but it also provides that none of the
materials that is required to be indexed and has not been
indexed may be relied upon as a precedent against anyone who
hasn't been informed of these secret laws.

38

This is quite a different situation from the situation
that

is in this case, and in fact there was a specific provision

for this specific problem in the Act that you simply can’t.rely
on that information, on those decisions.
Also, the contention that the fact that there is
no statutory review of the renegotiation procedures here means
that in this case there is jurisdiction under the Freedom of
Information Act to enjoin agency procedures, this is just an
incorrect analysis, I believe.

I think whether or not there

is jurisdiction to review agency procedures goes to the question
of the

propriety of the exercise of jurisdiction under the

Freedom of Information Act.

It doesn’t go to the existence of

that jurisdiction.
The

Sixth Circuit, in the Sears, Roebuck case,

found that there was no jurisdiction to enjoin agency proceedings
against the NLRB.

They also mentioned that there would be

review of the NLRB procedures later.

But the question is

really jurisdiction, not the exercise of jurisdiction,
I don't agree that it's clear that the contractors
ar® entitled to any of the information that they have asked for.
The Grumman case that they referred to, the petition for
rehearing has been denied, but the Government’s petition for
certiorari hasn't expired, and it would settle some of the
issues.

It wouldn't settle all of them.

The fact that

performance information is available under the regulations

39
now doesn't, necessarily mean that the performance information
supplied earlier in bannercraft would be,since under the
new regulations when the Board asks the various contractors to
supply the information to the Board, the request indicates
v

that thi3 information will be made available to the contractor.
Before,the request indicated that it would be kept confidential.
So there is a question of protecting an assurance of confiden­
tiality.
The only other point I had was that once the statutory
Board makes a final determination, the contractor can still
make a compromise offer and that may be considered, it will be
considered by the Board.

The Board’s action doesn’t become

final until it makes an order.
QUESTION:

I-lr3. Shapiro, do you agree that the

Freedom of Information Act is implicitly part of the discovery
rules of the Renegotiation Board?
HRS. SHAPIRO:

I certainly agree that the principles —
• •'V

QUESTION:

If in the course of a proceeding you

demand from the Board in connection with particular litigation
certain documents covered by the Freedom of Information Act
which you allege are relevant to the proceedings/ would you
think that the Freedom of Information Act to that extent is
part of the discovery rules?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

The Board's regulations do contain the

Freedom of Information Act, you know, the documents ba mad©

40

available under the Freedom of Information Act —
QUESTION*

So the question is whether if you have

a dispute over discovery, the proceeding must b® halted until
you settle it.
MRS* SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That's right.

It really doesn't have to be put in the

context of what the Freedom of Information Act intended.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Well, it does, because the Freedom of -

But even if it did not, it may be that the

normal rules of how to settle a discovery dispute might mean
that you lose the case.

What if the rule were that you do

enjoin the main proceeding while you settle the discovery
dispute, wholly aside from the Freedom of Information Act,
you might ba in trouble here.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Well, if the rule were —

For example, what if the plaintiff here

brought a mandamus action in a Federal court saying that the
official of the Renegotiation Board had flatly refused to do
his duty under his own discovery rules, which included the
Freedom of Information Act.
MRS, SHAPIRO:

Well, I believe that under Aircraft

and Lichter v, U.S. the Court has said that you don't enjoin
Renegotiation Act proceedings.
QUESTION:

O.K.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs. Shapiro, thank you.
