PROCEEDINGS
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We v?ill hear arguments

next in 71-6852, Lubin against Panish.
Miss Buckley,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARGUERITE M. BUCKLEY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MISS BUCKLE?:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I am counsel for Donald Lubin, the petitioner in
this case, both individually and on behalf of members of
his class.
This case first began a year ago in February, at
which time twenty-two people who were desirous of becoming
candidates in the forthcoming elections, came to me and we
all proceeded to the office of the Registrar, RecorderRegistrar, in the County of Los Angeles.
Included among these twenty-two people, were men and
women, black and white, mostly Peace and Freedom Party members,
but also two members of the Democratic Party, a member of the
Republican Party and a member of the American Independent
Party.
They had two things in common.

They wanted to

be candidates because they had something to say to the
electorate and they could not afford to pay the filing fee.
Now there was one other distinction also.

That was

that ciost of the people who wanted to becoiae candidates were
running for a primary position, a political office which
required them to be a member of the party.

But in county arid

city elections in California, most of the offices are non*
partisan.

And, therefore, Donald Lubin, who wished to run for

the office of Board of Supervisors, was running in a general
election, not a primary election.

He was not a member of a

party for purposes of ballot status.
We filed a writ of mandamus, asking both the RecorderRegistrar of the County of Los Angeles and the Secretary of
State of California to issue nomination papers to these people
without the necessity of paying fees.
We were granted a temporary Injunction by Judge Cole
of the Los Angeles Superior Court and an alternate writ was
set for hearing on March 6th.

At that time, Judge Wenke, sittic

in the Los Angeles Superior Court, held that as a matter of law,
Bullock applying, that as a matter of law, California fees
were reasonable and the fact that there was no alternative
did not matter under Bullock.
thereafter, I filed another writ of mandate in the
Appellate Court in California, a procedure which is alternate
to an appeal.
Q

Miss Buckley, would Judge Wenke1s ruling have been

appealable itself to the District Court of Appeal, had you
chosen to go that route?

5
MISS BUCKLEY:

Yes, but it would have been meaning**

Leas in terms of relief for our client because we could never
have gotten any kind of hearing before the elections ware to
be held.
The only reasonable choice we had was to go by way
of writ of mandate to the Appellate Court.
To give them the best opportunity to rule reasonably,
we attached a copy of the transcript of the hearing in the
lower court.
We were denied without tearing, and we promptly
filed a writ of mandate in the Supreme Court, and, again, the
transcript of the hearings, including Judge Henke1s statement
at page 3, to the effect that it appears to the Court that
the fees are reasonable as a matter of law, was before the
Supreme Court.
Q

And they denied the mandate without a hearing*

Under California law, is that necessarily a deter­

mination on the merits, their denial without hearing of a
petition for an extraordinary writ?
MISS BUCKLEY:

Inasmuch as they had the complete

proceedings of the lower court, I know of no case, Your Honor

Q

This wasn’t certiorari though, I mean, where you

are trying to get before them.

This was a petition .for an

original writ of mandate, wasn't it?
SUSS BUCKLEY:

But it presented to the court all of

6
the materia! which was before the lower court, Your Honor.
Q

And then their denial without hearing, you say, then,

is necessarily a decision on the merits.

They don’t in their

practice occasionally simply deny discretionarily?
MISS BUCKLEY:

I have no knowledge of Chat, Your

Honor.
And so, we are now here before —
Q

Writ of mandate in California is an extraordinary

writ, X assume?
v

mSS

Q

BUCKLEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, isn’t that the answer?

Extraordinary writ is

the opposite of an appeal, isn’t it?
MISS BUCKLEY:

Yes, Your Honor, but the particular

route that we took is recognized in California law.
Q

Miss Buckley, while you are interrupted, let me ask,

has the California law with respect to write-ids been changed
since this case developed?
MISS BUCKLEY:
changed.

Justice Blackamn, it has not been

And, even if it were, I submit to this Court that

write-in’s are not a suitable alternative.
Q

You would feel that your case is no weaker if write-

in’s were permitted?
MISS BUCKLEY:
Q

That’s correct.

Without payment of fee.
MISS BUCKLEY:

That’s correct.

And, at a later point,

7

I will discuss the differences between the write-in and the
position on the ballot, because it makes a difference ~k<
Ho, Your Honor, since you’ve raised the question now, I will
answer it riow.
In a write-in situation, and, in the first place,
Donald Lubin had a territory that covered 600,000 people.
As a write-in candidate, he would be required to make his name
known to those people not only well enough so that they
recognised it on the ballot, but so that they could remember
it to write it down.
t

How, I cited in my reply brief, an instance in
California, where we had a case of fraud.

A man by the name

of Vicensia was placed on the ballot to take votes away from
a man by the name of Valencia.

And the circumstances around

that particular filing, made it obvious that there was only
one reason for that filing to be done.

And that was that

voters could even make the mistake between Vicenaia and
Valencia and not be able to vote for the man that they wanted
to.
How much more difficult would it be for them to
remember the man's name to write it down as a write-in candidate
Secondly, as a candidate on the ballot, you are
entitled to all sorts of things.

Humber one, you are entitled

to equal time on radio and TV.
Humber two, every major newspaper has a practice in

8
Los Angeles County, f.or instance, of writing articles on the
ballot candidates at least once, and possibly twice, during
the campaign.
Q

Is a write-in candidate, an established write-in

candidate, not entitled to equal time on television?
MISS BUCKLEY:

I do not believe so, Your Honor,

because until he has in some way established himself as a
write-in candidate, he is just running around telling people,
"Vote for me.”

But, until he complies with the provisions of

the Code, including paying the fee, he is not entitled even
to have his votes counted,
Q

But Is this a Federal Communications Commission

ruling that you are relying on or just, kind of, your own
judgment of what the law ought to be?
MISS BUCKLEY:

I am relying on the fact that as a

candidate I am aware of how difficult it was for even establish^
candidates to get equal time from the stations, as a practical
matter.
Hot all candidates, particularly poor candidates,
who would be the only people who are being write-in candidates,
would have even less resources at their command to force the
stations, for instance, fco give them equal time.
And that brings up another point.

If, what you

offer as an alternative is a write-in campaign, you are placing
a much greater burden on those people who cannot afford even, in

9
many cases, the beginning filing fee.

And, what you are

requiring them to do is additional kinds of work that will
require more resources than the normal candidate.

You are

putting them in an unfair position and a different kind of
position than those people who can afford to pay the fee.
Q

How unkind is it?

A man has not enough money to

put up the filing fee, and you say, therefore, he is put
under additional burden by not being able to go out and get
people to know him.

Well, if I understand you, he couldn’t

get out there anyhow.
MISS BUCKLEY:

That’s not true, Your Honor.

And I

cited an example from our last election, where a Democratic
candidate who, because of Chote v. Brown and the filing of
this suit, was able to get a place on the ballot.

And, as a

result, he spent — he would have spent $450 in order to be
a candidate for Congress.

He did not have that kind of money.

He spent $138 of his own money and $40 from supporters, and
he gained 33% of the vote, or 17,000 votes.
Now, the alternative is ~~
Q

Well, I know of a candidate who didn’t have to go

by the pauper route but he paid less than $100 and was elected
a senator.
MISS BUCKLEY:

But, Your Honor, in our State, he

would have had to pay over — he would have had to pay for
the privilege of ****

10

Q

No, my whole point is, being factually correct, if

the man is broke and hasn’t got a nickel, is there any way under
the sun he is ever going to be known to anybody?
MISS BUCKLEY; Yes, Your Honor.

In fact, one of the

important things -Q

Well, how is it possible?

The only way it is possible

if somebody gives him some money.
MISS BUCKLEY;
Q

Justice Marshall ~

Am I right?
MISS BUCKLEY:

Ho, you are not.

May I say with

all due respect, because what will happen is the same thing
that happened to our Democratic candidate who went around and
knocked on doors, and thereby brought more —
Q

How many doors did he knock down?
MISS BUCKLEY:

Q

Well, he got 16,000 votes.

You mean that he went to 16,000 doors and knocked

»in them?
MISS BUCKLEY:
Q

Yes.

Oh, okay.
MISS BUCKLEY:

Hot only that, Your Honor, but we

presently have a potential candidate for Democratic Governor who
fortunately doesn’t have to file forma paupus, but he doesn’t
save vexy much money, and he is walking the entire State of
lalifomia, thereby getting free publicity, both from T¥ and
■radio and newspapers.

11

So it is possible, and It is not necessarily, you
know, going to be the result that somebody who is able to
avoid paying a very large fee of $850 or $1,000 is going to win
the election.

But the important tiling is that persons not be

barred from the political process.

And I think this is what

we are talking about.
Q

But, that’s an entirely different argument from

all of these things about he can’t get on TV, and what have you.
Is your argument that he can’t be discriminated against solely
because he doesn't have $850?

That, and no more.

Is that

your argument?
HISS BUCKLEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

But you ask — but

I have been getting questions about the practical results,
and I agree that the practical results are not at issue here.
What is at issue is whether we can deny people who cannot
afford to pay for the privilege of running an opportunity
to participate meaningfully in the political process.
And, I think that when we look at the fact that
the United States, which is one of the greatest democracies,
has a lower voting turnout than many of the other democracies,
according to the Hew York Times, then we have to begin to ask
why.

And part of why is because in this country approximately

25% of the people are on a poverty standard of living.

According to the United States ~~ I was director of
a poverty neighborhood legal services, and 1 remember our

12
guidelines very well, $3,500 for a family of four.

And yet

the Bureau of Labor Standards says that you need $7,000 for
a family of four.
Well, if you don't have enough money to feed your
i

family, now are you going to be able to take part in the
political process?

And, if, in addition, people who want to

represent you and who come from your own class and don’t have
money either, can't even get on the ballot, then you don’t want
to vote.
Wow, I think, though, that this Court has made it
quite clear that the rights of voters are intertwined with
rights of candidates, but I think that it is time for the
Court to make the decision that there is a right to be a
candidate, to take a forthright position and say that you
cannot have elections without candidates.
Q

You have mentioned the fact that a very large

percentage of voters do not vote in this country.
MISS BUCKLEY:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Are you familiar with some of the studies which have

come to the conclusion,for whaSever the conclusion may be
worth, that one of the reasons is — for the low voter turnout,
not the only reason, but one of the reasons is the excessively
large number of people an the ballots, the long and confusing
!>allats they must deal with, either on a voting machine or on
a paper ballot?

13
MISS BUCKLEY:

Yes, Your Honor, X understand that

has been —
Q

Would your approach tend to Increase the number of

candidates running for public office?
HXSS BUCKLEY:

Your Honor, X believe that there is

an alternative,and in my brief we have discussed the fact that
you do need to, In some ways, make sure that your ballot
contains a reasonable number of people, and people who are
reasonably serious.

But that can be taken care of by a

requirement of petitions and signatures.
Hew York, which is a rival to California, you
know, in every way, handles this matter very well with
petitions.

And they don’t worry about an unwieldy ballot,

because the very act of requiring signatures also means that
the candidate has to get out in advance and make himself or
herself known to the people in the community.
Q

Well, because there is another good way, or perhaps

even another better way, does that lift It to a constitutional
issue?
MISS BUCKLEY:

Well

but, Your Honor, we are

dealing with the very basis of our society.
with the political system.

How, unlike

We are dealing
X would like to

point out that not only do Articles 1 and 2 require elected
legislature and executives, but that Article 4, Section 4,
provides that the United States shall guarantee to every State

14

a £0publican for® of government, and a republican form of
government means cicisens who are entitled to vote.
0

Are you familiar with the Pacific Telephone case.

Miss Buckley?

mss
Q

BUCKLEY:

Mo, Your Honor, I am not.

That’s the case where this Court held that the

Republican Horn of fJovezfoaent clause was not jucdictable and
was not enforceable by the courts.
MISS BUCKLEY:

Well, Your Honor, I think that this

Court has already, in fact, in San Antonio v. Rodrigue's, in
which you were dealing with an educational problem, that you
took many pages of decision to deal with the fact that the
electoral process is one of the most important processes to
our form of government.
And, X only mention the Constitution as a basis, and
I am not unaware of the fact that this Court has time after
time after time stressed tine importance of voting, that it is,
in fact, one of the explicit

rights guaranteed in the

Constitution, and, therefore, has to be protected in the highes
way.
X am merely ***■
Q

When did the Court ever say that?
mSS BUCKLEY;

Q

Well —

The right to vote is one of the explicit -rights

guaranteed in the Constitution?

15
MISS BUCKLEY;

Well, in Rodriguez, you made the

distinction between implicit and explicit, and you said that
items such as education and very many other important kinds of
rights may be very important, but were not protected by the
Constitution because they were not explicit.

And then you

went in, and I assume that you — I may have misread your
opinion, although X did read it several times — we then -you then went into the importance of the electoral process to
our system.
Q

We all would agree that it is important -MISS BUCKLEY:

Not only that, but you did what X

thought was — for my purposes in preparing for this, Your
Honor — you did lay out very carefully the line of cases in
which you dealt with the importance of this right.
Q

Yes.
MISS BUCKLEY:

And my only

I am attempting here

to point out that the right to he a candidate may, one day in
the future in the Year 2000, if we use R. Buckminster Fuller’s
notion of having all of the people come in and vote via twoway television, we may be able to do away with the necessity
of candidates and representatives.

But, right now, that’s

our system.
Q

Yes.

And is there any question about the fact that

your client is a pauper.
10 of the Appendix.

I gather there is not, reading page

He says his average monthly income during

16
the year 3.972 has been the sum of no dollars-

And that’s

suor» to, ms It?
HISS BUCKLEY:
Q

Yes, it was, Your Honor,

Under the penalty of perjury — that the foregoing

is true and correct.

That’s never been questioned, the

bona fides of his poverty, has it?
MISS BUCKLEY:
Q

Be is a member of —•

His absolute inability to pay this fee of $702.
MISS BUCKLEY:

Q

No, Your Honor,

That’s true, Your Honor.

I don't think --do you need to advance the

proposition that there is an explicit, to use your word,
Constitutional right to be a candidate for office in order to
make an Equal Protection claim?
MISS BUCKLEY:
Q

Ho, Your Honor.

I suppose there is not an explicit right to run an

unregulated laundry, and yet Yick Wo says you can’t regulate
some people and not regulate others, with an evil eye and an
uneven hand.
MISS BUCKLEY:

But in Turner v. Foucfae, Your Honor,

I think the Court pointed out very well that once you open a
position to ©«Mae people then you cannot discriminate based cm
those kinds of factors which are protected by the Fourteenth —
Q

Precisely, whether or not the right to the position

is a constitutional right.
At least part of it?

Isn’t that your argument?

17
MISS BUCKLEY;

Yes, Your Honor.

The reason X suggested the second part of the
question had to do with the question which the members of
this Court presented to me, that is, whether it made a
difference whether it was individual poverty or that of his
group.

And X took that question to mean X should address

myself to the right of the candidate versus the right of
his supporters, or the voters.
Q

mss Buckley, you referred to the alternative of

nominating petitions -*
MISS BUCKLEY:
Q .

Yes, Your Honor.

— have you given any thought to what percentage of

the people who voted in the last election, for example, might
be an appropriate yardstick to determine the number of
signatures required?
HISS BUCKLEY:

Well, Your Honor, if you are

talking about a primary election, I would think that it would
not be a percentage of the total who voted, but the total who
voted in that particular party.

Because in California we have

four parties, two of which are minor parties.

To demand that

they have the same percentage of the vote as those who belong
to the majority party would work a great hardship.

They might

not even have that many people in their party.
For instance, if you ask for 2% of the population,
the American Independent may not even have that many people in

18

Che party right now,

and i£ would require 100% of their

membership*
So, 1 chink you have to schedule it, and X think it
3hould be a minimum amount, something, say, between 1,000 and
5,000 signatures in a fairly large district, and something
scaled down in a smaller district.
Q

Assume you bad a requirement for 5,000 petitions in

the Los Angeles District —
HISS BUCKLEY:

That would be a statewide office.

Your Honor.
Q

What would you assume for Los Angeles?
MISS BUCKLEY: Well, I believe that there were

30,000 *— for instance, in the Peace and Freedom Party, they

had 30,000 members registered and Los Angeles County, of course
course, covers 400 miles.

1 covered them all, so I am aware

of them.
X think that in Chat case you might want *— 1% of
30,000 would only be 3,000 signatures

Q

What do you think it would cost to obtain 3,000

signatures?
MISS BUCKLEY: Well, I think, Your Honor, that
poor people have learned to walk.
to get out and knock on doors.

And I think they’ve learned

They may not be able to

contribute money, and I documented fairly well the fact that,
although we now have the opportunity to mark off on our income

19
tax forms the right to give a dollar to the party of our
choice, if we belong to a major part3T, the — only 3% of the
people nationwide bothered to check off to give money to their
major party.

So, for people who may not even be able to file

income tax returns , they cannot give money.
out and knock on doors.

But they will go

They will go Out and collect

signatures.
Q

Are you required to have a notary public witness

the signatures on nominating petitions?
MISS BUCKLEY:

We require, in California, that the

person who is collecting the signatures gets — certifies
that the — that lie has, in fact, obtained those signatures
from the people that he says he did.
Q

That doesn’t have to be a notary public?
MISS BUCKLEY:

On some, Your Honor, they do, but

California provides for certification rather than necessity
of having a notary public.
Q

Most notaries charge fees for doing it.
MISS BUCKLEY:

Well, except that there is also e

provision in the California law that says notaries may not
charge fees for political type of documents.
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gaylord.

20
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDUARD H. GAYLORD, ESQ.
OK BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
i'll, GAYLORD:

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
There were certain preliminary questione asked.

As I understand this election, this was a true primary.

In

California, you have a primary both for partisan and non­
partisan officers.

As to partisan officers, only those persons

registered with a party can vote in that particular primary.
But the local officers and judicial officers are all non­
partisan.

And every qualified voter who is registered in the

district can vote for one of those officers.
Ever since 1926, if in a nonpartisan office a person
gets majority, he is then and there elected.

And then for him

it becomes a general election, but otherwise it remains a
primary and the one who gets the most votes and the one who
gets second — the second moat votes then is the ~~ are the
two nominated candidates who then go before the voters in the
general election in November.
If I ara correct, that this was the Fourth District,
that happened then, there were two candidates that got the
most and next to the most voters, neither one getting majority,
and one of them was elected in the ganeral election.
The question was asked, what is the status of a
denial opinion by the Supreme Court of a writ of mandate.

21
There ere three Supreme Court cases that definitely hold that
the denial by minute order of an application for writ of
mandate is simply a refusal by the State Supreme Court to
exercise its original jurisdiction, and is not an adjudication
on the merits.
I merely bring that up because the question was
asked.

I am not objecting to the jurisdiction of this Court,
Did Your Honor want me to list the citations or

shall I give them to the Clark, or —
Q

You may hand it to the Clerk,
MR, GAYLORD:

Q

I’ll hand it to the Clerk.

I believe Miss Buckley has a copy.
MR, GAYLORD:

I’ll see that she has a copy.

There was one case before this Court in 1951, where
there was a denial by the Court of Appeal, without opinion,
and the Court of Appeal certified that they did deny it on
a Federal ground, and the Court said it had jurisdiction, but
in its discretion,nevertheless, dismissed the case.
Q

Your brief proceeds upon the premise that the Court

decided the constitutional merits of this case.
MR, GAYLORD:

As I say, I am not objecting to the

jurisdiction of this Court.

When I originally put tny response

to the petition for a writ of certiorari and asked this Court
to take jurisdiction, frankly, the point had not occurred to
me.

Later, I hardly thought I was in a position to raise a

22
question, and I would not hove raised it, but I was merely
answering questions of the Court.
On the write-in votes, I*d like to stress once more

that the requirement for a fee in order to have a write-in iotcounted was not put in untiL 1968, therefore, say, in 1967,
there was a reasonable alternative to having your name on the
ballot.

The law was valid then, and under the decisions of bo

this Court and the Supererae Court of California, which are cit<
in our brief, if the fee requirement for write-in votes makes
this system unconstitutional — I am not conceding, but ©vers
if It does — it is the 68th Amendment which is uncons fci tut ion<
and not the original law which has been in effect since 1913.
Q

What is the California law on write-in?

Does it

have to be exactly correct, and the i’s dotted and the fc’s
crossed?
MR. GAYLORD:

Ho, It is not that.

The difficulty

with the write-in law in California, in 1968, they put in a
law that a vote will not be counted for a vjrite-in unless the
candidate files a notice at least 5 days ahead of time that he
is a write-in candidate and pays a fee he would have paid to
get his name on the ballot.
Q

I understand that, but there are some States where

if the name -- if you leave out the initial -« it is no good.
Is that true in California?
MR. GAYLORD:

Ho, I think the rule in California is

23

that if it is -- if you can definitely ascertain that the name
written in is for this particular individual, the vote will
be counted for that individual.
X might concede that write-in may be difficult, but
it has been done,

lit* Alice Patterson, for example, in 1936,

lost his bid to be renominated by the Republican Party as a
member of the Assembly, that’s the lower house of California.!
He distributed pencils, having printed thereon, "Urite in
Alice E. Patterson,“ and the party had the exact name, the
exact spelling, and he did win the election.
I also cited the very unusual case where a judge
was -» a candidate for judge was defeated in the primary, and
under the law, at that time, prior to 1926, the narae of the
winner was the only one on the ballot, and this defeated judge
defeated the winner in the final election by xorite-in.

So,

it can be done,
Q

Suppose the Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles

County — how large a board is that?
MR. GAYLORD:
Q

It is a five-member board.

All five elected at the —
MR, GAYLORD:

All five elected from supervisorial

districts of about 1,400,000 people in each district.
Q

Each runs in a separate district?
MR. GAYLORD:

Q

Each runs in a separate district.

They do not run at-large throughout —

24
MR* GAYLORD:

That is correct.

So* there would be the voters in a district with a
population of 1,400,000.
Incidentally, I take it that what Mr. Lubin was
running for was to be a supervisor with a salary of over
$35,000 a year, representing almost three times as many people
as a Congressman represents.

And, In an office that important,

if he had any substantial support whatever he surely would have
no difficulty in getting the $701 for a filing fee.
As the New Mexico Court said, which I quoted in the
brief, that case is now before this Court, I understand, it
does not measure the candidates pocketbook but the amount of
his support.
Q

Mr, Gaylord, in the 68th Amendment, there is a

provision reciting the intention of the Legislature that
the filing fee shall be used to support the State Commission on
voting machines and vote tabulating devices.

Has ever any

appropriation been made pursuant to that declaration of intent?
MR* GAYL0SD:

1 don’t think so,

I don't know, but

I don’t think so.
Q

Does that have any legal significance in this case?
MR. GAYLORD:

No.

We are not contending that this

fee is necessary fco support the election process.

We are

contending that it is a test of good faith candidacy.
Q

What about the person who has $701, or $7,001, or as

25
much money ns anybody wanted to charge him?

Do you think

charging him $701 to run for this office is a reasonable
measure of his support or his seriousness?

MR.

GAYLORD:

is not perfect.

I think it does help.

I concede it

It could be that a very well-to-do man or a

rich man would run frivolously because $701 means nothing to
him, but it is less likely.

It does keep out a great many

frivolous candidates.
Incidentally, a man like that would be less likely
to run just as a lark besides.
And that candidates can do that is —
Q

Aren’t these the two categories we are comparing,

the ones without -- with the $701 and the ones without?
MR. GAYLORD:

That is true, but I would say that a

man without the $700 is not necessarily barred from putting his
name on the ballot if he really has any substantial support.
Now, Miss Buckley seems to illustrate a man —
Q

But the other group --a fellow could easily

you

could conceive of a fellow with $701 putting himself on the
ballot whether he has any support or not.

It doesn’t make much

sense, but —
Mi GAYLORD:

I agree with that.

I agree that that’s

not a perfect method, but I think it —
Q

You think it survives Equal Protection?
MR, GAYLORD:

No,

26
Q

Do you think it survives Equal Protection if it is

challenged?
GAYLORD:
Q

Yes, I do.

Even by the strict scrutiny test?
MR* GAYLORD:

Yes, I would think so.

If is a

reasonable way, and what is the alternate?
Q

Is it a reasonably necessary way?
MR. GAYLORD:

Yes.

The only alternate, as I see it,

is to require a large number of names, like 1% or 2%, which
would be enormous in the support from the district.
Q

Mr. Gaylord, is there anything else you do other than

put up the money?
MR. GAYLORD:

Yes, he does have to collect a few

signatures, 35, 40, something like that.
Q

That’s all?

I mean ~~ what is it that you find that

he is a responsible person, other than money?
MR. GAYLORD:

Well, the qualifications of a super-

v isor are merely that he be a resident of the district.

The

*

Charter says for one year before election.

Some of the States

that is the only requirement to be a candidate for supervisor.
Q

Oh, no.

The $700-some.

MR. GAYLORD:

And to go on the ballot he must put up

the -~
Q

There is nothing other than the money that determines

that he is a responsible person?

27
MR, GAYLORD:

That is correct.

I can’t think of any — in a political office like
that, I can’t think of any Civil Service examination, or
anything like that, that would be practical.
Q

Wouldn’t a man with $1,500 be more responsible than

a man with $750?
MR. GAYLORD:

He might be a little more responsible,

but —

Q

So the more lie had, the more responsible he’d be?
MR. GAYLORD:

That’s correct.

And there is a question of drawing lines.
Q

I hope that's not everybody’s theory.
MR, GAYLORD:

Well, 1 mean a man who is 1£ on the

day of election can vote and yet you can’t say he is much
more learned than the man who is two days younger, but you
do have to draw the line somewhere.
As this Court itself said in Bullock v. Carter, that
fee was too high, but not ail fees are invalid, and there comes
a time when the fee becomes too high.

How, where you draw the

line is a difficult question,
Q

Let me go back to my inquiry about the absence of

any legislative appropriation of these fees.

How do you answer

the suggestion that these fees are nothing more than a revenue
raising device?
MR, GAYLORD:

Well, I would say this, that whether

28
there is a specific appropriation or not the money spent on
elections is probably far greater than the fees collected,and
if that is true, does it make too much difference that there
isn't a specific appropriation that this particular fund is
used for this particular purpose?
Miss Buckley mentions in her brief that very few
people took advantage of Give a Dollar to the Party of Your
Choice.

Well, it is very easy to see that great many people

may not be particularly concerned with a particular party,
as a whole, but may be very much concerned with a particular
candidate, especially a nonpartisan candidate, where a person
caring nothing at all about party would be very interested.
So I don’t think that’s a good illustration.
She also raises in her brief, although she hadn't
said it orally, that there is a provision that you have to get
at least 1% of the vote to get a nomination.

That may work

some hardship in the case of some very small political parties,
but in the case of a nonpartisan it is almost inconceivable
that somebody would get less than IX of the vote and yet be
the second person of all those voted for.

You'd have to have

at least 52 candidates, and a very unusual situation to have
that, so it would be practically impossible for a person to get
second in amount of votes in a nonpartisan office and not have
at least IX.

And, even if that should happen, it would be

practically impossible that the person who got that few votes in

29
the primary would the» receive a majority in the general
election.
A great deal that Miss Buckley has said, X think,
is within her brief and has been answered in our brief and
unless the Court has further questions, that’s all I have.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:

Thank you, Mr. Gaylord.

Miss Buckley, you have about six minutes left, if
you wish to use them.
MISS BUCKLEY:

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARGUERITE M. BUCKLEY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MISS BUCKLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would — in respect to the question of whether the
Supreme Court of the State of California had considered the
matter prior to denying it, I would like to draw to your
attention the fact that the -- in my experience, the Supreme
Court of the State of California generally, when presented with
a writ of mandate for the first time, which It does not believe
it has sufficient information to deal with, kicks it back to
the Appellate Court for decision, and that same thing happened
in the case of Zapata v. Davidson, 224 Calif. Appeil. decision
3d, S23,

on this very question of the filing fees in the

elections that we were talking about.

That case was sent to the

Appellate Court in April, one month after the Supreme Court had

30
denied us summarily.

And, when presented with a writ of

mandate on the exact same question, they sent it to Zapata v.
Dayldaon.

And the Appellate Court determined that the filing

fees were, in fact, unconstitutional based on Bullock, so I
would like, at this time, to draw your attention to a case
which has not been cited in my brief, and that is Zapata v.
Davidson, 24 CA 3d,823, and that is a 1972 decision.
Secondly, I would like to discuss very briefly the
question of the reasonableness of the California fee.

When

counsel leads you to believe that Texas was so different from
California, 1 believe he misstates the question, because the
Texas fees, in some case, on the State level, were less than
those charged in California.
»

As 1 read the Texas statute, the real high fees,
the $6,000 and $8,000, were primarily on county levels, but that
the State positions ran from. $150 to $850 or $1,000, and that's
exactly where California is at.
Furthermore, the case of Socialist Party v. Ull was
cited as having legitimized California filing fees,

But, that's

a 1909 case, and at that time California had filing fees ranging
from $10 to $50.

It had no relationship to the emoluments of

office.
Q

If a person were a pauper, it wouldn't make any

difference if the filing fee were $5 or $500, if he didn't
have anything.

31
MISS BUCKLEY;
Q

Thatrs true, Your Honor, but —

In that case, was the plaintiff a pauper?
MISS BUCKLEY:

Ho, I don’t believe so, Your Honor,

but the question that was raised was not a conati -- a U.S.
constitutional question.

It was a California Constitution

question.
Q

I wasn't familiar with that case.
MISS BUCKLEY:

But, in that case, the dicta was to

the effect that while these fees were reasonable, raning from
$10 to $50, that if the fee structure had been based on the
emoluments of office, as the present system is, that they wouL
have struck it down, because such a fee would have no relation
ship to what it costs to run an election.

It would have no

relationship to what it costs to file papers.
Q

That case was decided as a matter of California law,

was it?
MSS BUCKLEY;

Yes, it was, in 1909, and it is the

case which my opponent relies upon, and which I believe Judge
Wencke relied upon in saying that California fees were
reasonable.
Q

I have your impression, from your earlier argument,

Miss Buckley, that if the fee were $100 you would still be
here, is that right, or not?
MISS BUCKLEY: Yes, Your Honor.
Q

$10?

32

MISS BUCKLEY:
the

Well, Your Honor, I -really object to

—*

Q

You really object to any fee, don’t you?
MISS BUCKLEY:

Well, if It costs $L0 to print up

the forms for nominating, then I think perhaps that could be
reasonably explained,
Q

Well, I understood your position to be that you can’t

put a price tag on any candidacy for the purpose of discouragini
candidates.
MISS BUCKLEY:
Q

You are right, Your Honor.

So I misunderstood it,

I thought that your case

depended upon the fact that your client «as a pauper.
MISS BUCKLEY:

It does.

He is a pauper.

He cannot

afford to pay the fee.
Q

Then your argument is not so broad as indicated in

my brother Brennan’s question, is it?
MISS BUCKLEY:

Weil, what I was suggesting, Your

Honor, was that the case has two bases, really.

You can —

and I am suggesting to the Court that we ought to go beyond
just the Fourteenth Amendment and beyond the idea that paupers
should have the fees removed, but we should be looking to the
fact that all people have a right to participate in the politic
process, because my client, Mr. Lubin, is a poor person, but
he is also something else.

He has in conanon with me,and

with all of you,that he is a citizen of the United States, and,

33

a8 such, has a right to participate.

And I think that placing

any kind of a fas which has no relationship to the actual
cost of filing the papers is interfering with the rights of
all citizens.
Q

You think the State has no interest in preventing,

if they can, having 250 people running for this particular
office ?
MISS BUCKLEY:

Hot by using fees, Your Honor, not

by using a monetary standard.
Q

Weil, do you concede they have an interest in

doing it in some way?
MSS BUCKLEY:

Yes.

And I suggested as an alternative

*•» *»•

Q

By the petitioning process.
«•

MISS BUCKLEY:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Your broader argument .Chen is not an Equal

Protection argument, is it?
MISS BUCKLEY;

Ho.

I am suggesting to this Court

that X eta giving you the opportunity, if you wish to take it,
to broaden the scope of what you have done heretofore.
Q

What clause of the Constitution would you suggest

we use to broaden it?
MISS BUCKLEY:

Well, X think, Your Honor, that when

we are talking about the rights of people to participate in
the political system we are talking about the — I can't give

34
you the exact part of the Constitution, but it seems to me
*» *•

Q

Could you just refer to a number or a section?
MSS BUCKLEY:

Well, what I am suggesting,

Your

Honor, is that the Constitution, aa a whole, protects the
political process.

It was designed to assure that we would

continue to have a republican form of government that all of
the people would be able to participate by voting,

How, the

very provision that you use to sustain —
Q

How in the world can you say that?

When the Consti­

tution was adopted, there was a large block of people in this
Country that couldn’t vote.
MSS BUCKLEY:
Q

You are right, Your Honor, but —

Well, how could it have been set up to do that if

it didn’t allow it?
MSS BUCKLEY: Well, at that point, the problem with
our system was that it did not recognize those people as
people, and that is to the shame of our country.
Q

Yes, but how are you going to extend that now to

give everybody the right to vote?
MISS BUCKLEY:

Well, I believe that, for instance,

when — well, we’ve already given everybody the right to vote
by all the decisions .'which this Court has made.
Q

The only decision this Court lias made is that you

shall not discriminate, but I want you to show me the one that

35
says you have fche right fco vote.
MISS BUCKLEY:
Q

Well —

And then, after you get that one, shat? me the

right to run for office.
MSS BUCKLEY:
Q

Weil, I —

I have trouble finding that one.
MSS BUCKLEY:

Well, I am remembering several cases,

if l may —
Q

Well, don*t bring Rodrigues again, please.

That

involves schools, not voting.
MISS BUCKLEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

I understand that

involves schools.
Well, in Oregon v. Mitchell, your brothers Iterlan
and Brennan both discussed the fact that under the —
Q

I am not talking about discussion.

I am saying where

they said that there was a right to vote or a right to run for
office.
MISS BUCKLEY:

Well, both Brennan and Harlan, in

Oregon v. Mitchell, said that fche right to be a candidate was
inherent in the right to vote, and that it was left out of
the Fifteenth Amendment
Q

because --

Because it didn't involve Negroes.
MSS BUCKLEY:

They assumed it was already there.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
consumed now.

Thank you.

Well, I think your time is

36
MISS BUCKLEY;

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Gaylord.

The case Is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:36 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above~entifcled matter was submitted,)
