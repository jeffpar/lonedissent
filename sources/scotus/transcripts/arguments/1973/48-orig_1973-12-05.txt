PROCEEDINGS
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

now in Humber 48 Original, State of Mississippi against the
State of Arkansas.
Mr, Ward, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MITCHELL EMMETT WARD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WARD:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The State of Mississippi has filed this original
action asking the Court to make a judicial determination of
a disputed boundary line between the two States,
The uncertainty of the boundary line is due to the
fact that it is located in an abandoned bend of the Mississippi
River which formerly was the boundary but which has now been
cut off by the action of U*5. Engineers in making a neck cut­
off in 1935.
When the two States were admitted to the Union, the
acts admitting the States to the Union made the river the
common boundary.
In the area in question, the river looped westward
and southward and then eastward around a long neck of land
which was located in Mississippi, known as Potter Point,
Mississippi, and this map depicted in the Arkansas-Mississippi
Refuge Quadrangle was attached to the Special Tester’s Report,

4
the Honorable Clifford O'Sullivan.
Q

Which map to it?
MR, WARD;

Q

That's the map -*• Appendix A.

Thank you,
MR, WARD;

The black line on this map shows the

location of the river when it was surveyed by the Surveyor
General of the United States,
It is the contention of Mississippi that from about
1823-30, the time of the original 0L0 surveys, that the river
migrated slowly and imperceptibly caving into the Arkansas
bank and adding accretions to Carter Point, Mississippi, until
such time as it moved approximately 2000 feet to the west,
its location in 1935,
In the year 1935, the United States Engineers made
a cutoff across the neck of Carter Point, which is shown on
this exhibit, Appendix A, thus diverting the flow of the river
from its old channel around Carter Point and creating a new chan­
nel,

. Within a matter of some three nonths ,all navigation

left the old channel and adopted the new channel through
Tarpley Point.

it, the only argument here is over

Is that right?
MR, WARD:

It was that area around Luna

Bar,

Lunac Eat actually created the problem.
Q

Is this a very valuable piece?

There is a lot of

5
Calent exercised here on a MR, MAW:

Yes.

By now, it has probably close to a

thousand acres of land -- all of this land shown in Spanish
Moss Bend has filled in.

There have been numerous problems

in the enforcement of criminal law, the State of Mississippi
arresting residents of the State of Arkansas on this bar, with
the attendant confusion about which State has criminal juris­
diction.
It is the contention of the State of Arkansas that
this gradual migration did nottoocc.nr but that in the year
1872 the river, Mississippi River, suddenly jumped, caved into
the Arkansas bank, went overbank, scoured out a completely new
channel behind the mainland Arkansas bank, and then reentered
the Mississippi channel at a lower area there, thus creating
an island, which they say is Luna

Island and not Luna • Bar,

The Special Chancellor -- I mean the Special Master
resolved this conflict in favor of Mississippi and we are here
today on exception to his report,
lie are not sure just what the position of the Supreme
Court is at this time about the weight to be given or the
finality to be given to the finding of a Special Master,
He do note that in Rule 92 of the Supreme Court Rules
that they say that where applicable the Federal Civil Rules
will be given effect.

And in Rule 53 of the Civil Rules, it

is provided that the finding — factual findings, of a master

will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous,
Actually, we are in agreement with

«— Mississippi

and Arkansas are in agreement with the basic law, which is the
law of the thalweg, and we are really here arguing a point of
fact as to whether the finding of the -- the report of the
Master should be approved on that finding,,
Me both agree that the law is that if the river
migrates slowly and imperceptibly and the thalweg continues to
cave into a bank, that where that thalweg is the boundary line
between States, that that changes -- does not change the State
boundary, but the boundary follows the deepest line of naviga»
tion or sailing line or thalweg,used interchangeably,
remains the State line wherever it may be.

and it

We agree on that.

And we further agree that'if the river suddenly
abandons its old bed and carves out a new bed, in a very short
period of time by an evulsive action that this, freezes the
State line in the line of navigation, the sailing channel,
where it was located prior to the evulsion after that reach of
the river has ceased to be a flowing stream,
Q

Am I correct in assuming that there really isn't any

argument on the law at all between the two States, it is the
application of ~~
MR, HARD:

The application of the law.

There is one other point of law which I think we are
in agreement on, and that is this: that in the brief below

7
Arkansas conceded that Mississippi had made a prima-facie
case» and that the burden of proof rested upon them to
establish the 1872 evulsion*

This was quoted — I did not

argue it in ray brief because it was quoted by the Special
Master and was not controverted by Arkansas*
That is the law, anyway, as I understand it to be
because an evulsion is an extraordinary thing and not the
ordinary thing that would happen.
Fortunately, we were able to find numerous maps and
charts, directions for navigation, reports to Congress, in­
volving this sector of the river, over -- approximately 200 of
them.

So we have a fairly complete historical picture of this*
From the time that Mississippi and Arkansas were

admitted to the Union — there are numbers of maps, particularly
the old Western Pilot which gave directions to navigators and
which included maps of this sector of the river, which stated
that the sailing vessels when they go through Spanish Moss bend
should go over and hold hard against the bank of the Mississippi
River, thus fixing the sailing line against the concave high
bank of the Arkansas River from 1820 up until 1860.

The largest

years in gap in this period of time is only nine years, so we
have a graphic depiction of the fact that from 1820 to 1860
there seems to be no question but what the sailing line, the
thalweg, the channel of navigation, was hard against the
Arkansas bank*

Cf

Also, during that time, there was no evidence of a
detached bar, as we call it, or point bar, or an island as
Arkansas calls it.

There was no evidence of any detached land

mass appearing off of Carter Point,
The maps all, however, did show that attached to
Carter Point there was building and continued to build a sand
bar accretion formation.
And in 1863 -- and we now move into the war years *>«•
Lloyd's 1863 map of the Mississippi River which was drawn up
for the purpose of showing these very things, island, sand bars,
further fortifications and mines that had been placed out, was
printed, and this 1863 map goes into great detail showing a
very decided sand bar formation attached to the distal end of
Carter Point, Mississippi, with no land mass formation out in
the river.
Following the end of the Civil War, and during the
efforts to reconstruct the South, the United States sent a
Genera 1 Humphreys down to make an inspection and report,
particularly on the condition of the levees along the Mississ­
ippi River, the levee being, as you know, an earthen enbankraent
that is thrown up, at that time parallel with and quite close
to the bank line, for the purpose of trying to contain the
Mississippi waters when it was in flood.
This report that Mr, -- that General Humphreys made
in 1866 to Congress and a subsequent report that he made to

Congress in 1&69, reported that the hank was caving badly in
this bend, that the levees had fallen into a state of dis­
repair and that breaks were evident in the levees in several
places all in this Spanish Moss bend area.
Then, in 1872, the State of Arkansas also became
concerned with this and they appointed a surveyor named
Douglas to make surveys of existing levees and to make recom­
mendations for new levees to take the place of the gaps in the
old levies*
This is the first historical proof of the existence
of this land mass known as Luna'.

Bar in a situation where it

has become detached from Carter Point.
Mr, Douglas surveyed in great detail the Arkansas
bank there.

He showed farms, he showed forests, he showed

slews, he showed the levees in place arid levees which had
been breached,

Luna:/ Bar,ho did not designate its site, but

in the river over against the Mississippi shore he showed an
eye at formation, detached from the shore, utterly devoid of
any cultural civiriaation,which would indicate we have no
report of

Mr „

Douglas, but it would certainly indicate by

leaving it blank that he did not consider it a part of
Arkansas.
The most important thing about Douglas’ survey,
however, is the fact that he locates with great detail the then
existing levee system with its breaks which coincide to the

10

reports that-General Humphreys made to Congress in 1866 and
1869.
The engineering witnesses introduced by -- the
engineering witness-« and it was the only engineering witness
introduced by Mississippi -- was able to overlay subsequent
surveys right up until the present time.

And you can see

Q
that?

Mr. Ward, does your opposition agree with you on
Wasn't there some testimony somewhere that there is

evidence of an old levee on Luna Bar?
MR. WARD:

Wo, I think not.

There was some testimony

of an old house site —

Cistern, that’s right.

The witness, Dr. Durham, even went

so far as to get a metal detector and go — they assumed there
were houses there because there were china-berry trees.

In

our part of the country, they do plant china-berry trees around
house sites.

So they saw some china-berry trees also brought in

Ii
by birds.

Q

Is there any habitation there now?
MR. WARD:

Q

No, sir.

. But you are still arresting people on Luna Bar. for

something,
MR. WARD:

Mississippi is arresting people on Luna

Bar.
Q

On what kind of charges?
MR, WARD:

A game violation.

There has not been

making these arrests.

Mississippi

And I think that's what really precipi­

tated the litigation, and we thought it well to bring it to
an end in a proper way,
Q

Hunters?
MR, WARD:

Hunters, yes, sir.

One instance, the

hunter from Missouri came down with an Arkansas license and
was arrested and tried in Mississippi and another one, I believe,
had an Arkansas license and was also arrested*
Q

So it was those episodes -~
MR. WARD:

Q

Yes, sir,

-- that motivated this litigation to get the matter

settled.
MR, WARD:

When I started the litigation down in

the lower courts, one suit was filed in District Court at
Greenville, another suit was filed in the chancery court of

12
Arkansas, and we were getting litigation all over the place,
and Mississippi decided it wanted to bring it to a head and
have some definite adjudication of where the line was*
Q

These were geese or ducks?
MR. WARD:

Deer mostly*

There is very good goose

and duck, but mainly deer -? and turkey.
Q

Who is the owner of the property in litigation?
MR* WARD:

Carter Point is owned by a lumber company

and a synthetic company.

The Arkansas bank, right north of

Carter Point, is owned by Chicago Mill and Lumber Company
which.is not involved in this suit.
west — various ones

The land owners to the

Dr.. Walls who is now dead, a Mrs. Smith,

Arkansas Land and Cattle Company.

And then there are further

owners -- other owners further downstream who.have not yet
become involved in any of the litigation.
Q

Wouldn’t the suit.as to the historical movement of

the river unsettle private titles as well as the boundaries
between the States?
MR.- WARD:

Yes.

On Duke v. Pur fee, they recognise

that private litigants can settle their titles one by one if
they finally get an unappealable decree, but it is difficult
crossing State lines to get personal service on landowners and
to make a decree which you feel confidence in.

Also that

might resolve the question of taxes, the question of criminal
juridiction, and recently there lias been a good bit of oral

13
activity in Washington County, which is immediately adjacent
to that.

There has always been a good bit in Arkansas.

I am

not quite sure about this particular county.
But at any rate the Douglas 1872 survey was the first
historical evidence of this situation being there.

Also in

1872, Louisiana, since they were getting the water when the
water flowed through the breach levees.

In Arkansas, they

flowed downstream and came into what is known as a ten cell
hotton.
And Louisiana also sent a Captain Richardson up to
make an investigation report and he made a report in 1872 to
the Louisiana Levee Commissioner reiterating the same situation
found in Umphrey*s reports.

In addition to the breaks

that

he found and shown on Douglas report, he found an additional
break of 200 feet in the levee.
The important thing about all of these reports,it
seems to me, is this, one, no mention was ever made of an
evulsion taking place in 1872 whereby the river jumped into
Arkansas and caved through the land and came back out.
The geological witnesses, Dr. Kolb from Mississippi,
Dr,

-- Hr, Spillers and Dr. Durham from Louisiana, all

conceded that in their experience as geologists and all of the
geological literature there had never been any mention or ever
any history of any such phenomenon taking place as Arkansas
claims to have happened here.

14
In fact* Dr, Kolb said, "I had to coin a phrase
and he called it an outside -Avulsion and said, "I never heard
of it,

I just made it up,"

Mr, Spillers made one.

"I call it reoccupying an old channel."

He said*

He admitted that there

was no such accepted phrase in geologic literature and he said
he had to coin the phrase too.
So, with all of this work done in this ‘particular
narrow sector of the river, it seems to be incredible that if
this phenomenon took place it had never happened before and
has never happened since, when they were concerned with the
integrity of the levees, when they were concerned with trying
to protect the backland of Arkansas from flooding that they
would have swept this remarkable situation under the rug,
Q

Mr, Ward, there was testimony by a forester with

respect to the existence of three rather mature trees, one
a red mulberry tree, I think, and the other a large walnut
tree, and, as I remember, the species of the third tree was
not identified, which Arkansas says tends to support their
theory.

Where were those

those trees

it wasn*t clear to me where

where the forester testified he found those

trees or tree stumps and what the significance of them would
be.
MR, WARD:

Mississippi takes the position that those

are stumps of trees that had been severed from their bowl in
years past and had floated in over some flood in preceding years.

15
In substantiation of that position, which we think
is a valid one, the -- if the Court please — one of the
the old mulberry tree was found on the lower end of Luna
Bar*

The other two trees were found about the center

center portion of Luna Bar.

west

The remarkable thing about it was

that these witnesses pinpointed *■» and they are on the exhibits
they pinpointed the location of these three stumps, which
they said they thought were stumps of trees in place.
Q

And they testified they were deeply rooted there,

didn?t they?
MR. WARD:

Yes.

One of them was rooted, one was

bent over and was not rooted.
it couldn't have been.

One had moss on the roots, so

Mr. Putnaoi first said it was rooted

then I called his attention to the fact there was moss on
the roots and he said, well, you wouldn't have moss on roots.
But the complete refutation to that, in our opinion,
is this, that the witness Smith

all of these traps were

blown up to a common scale of one foot equal 20,000 feet,
one to 20,000.

It is possible by getting your benchmarks,

your levees, and so on, and lining them up, to overlay, and
transparent overlays were made of all of these exhibits,

to

put one exhibit transparency over the other and locate various
geographical points.
The mulberry stump and the other two stumps which
they said were of ancient age.

In 1894, the soil was then —

3.6
in one piece, was .10 feet lower, in another 15 feet lower, and
another place 20 feet lower.

So between 1894 and 1970, when

Mr, Putnam went on Luna Bar,

there had been a filling, so that

the elevation had been increased from 1894 -- IJd say had been
filled

in layman's ~~ I'd say had been increased as uiueh as

20 feet, 15 feet, 10 feet.

So these stumps they would have

been hanging in the air if they had been there in 1894,
the meantime,

In

the river had come in and deposited and these

stumps had obviously floated in, a phenomenon that’s accepted
up and down the river, had floated in on some subsequent rise
and had attached there.
While you have raised the question of forests, we
found, with the exception of these dead trees, which we didn't
find, we never could have located them ~~ they found them.
Q
spot,

If, in fact, trees of that age had grown in that
then your theory would be erroneous, wouldn’t it?
MR. IZARD:

No, sir.

It would have been impossible

because they grew in an area which by subsequent taaps

the

1882 survey of the Mississippi River Commission -« we call it
the MRC survey — the 1894 survey -** the subsequent surveys
show that this area was in the bed of the river.
Q

My quest5.on was if those trees had, in fact, grown

where they were found and of that age, then all your evidence
is wrong, isn’t it?
MR. WARD:

Ho,

sir.

I wouldn’t agree to that because -

Q

Me II, in other words, it cculdn’t have been the

bottom of the river or the trees wouldn’t have grown there.
Assume with me, if you will, contrary to what you strenuously
represent to be the facts, that the trees, in fact, did grow
in those spots for 84 years, 100 years, whatever it v?as -~
year old trees.

And had they grown there, then your theory

go to the historic facts would be mistaken, wouldn’t it?

MR. WARD:

Yes.

I would have to assume, first, that

the land was at that elevation and that all of these sub­
sequent maps were all wrong*

And that was a point that Judge

O'Sullivan made that all of the witnesses for Arkansas found
fault with these ancient maps wherever they did not agree with
their theory, and that was Che way they washed the maps out
because they said it doesn’t agree with our theory, our theory
being that they
grew,

washed in and their theory being that they

I can't get over the fact that there was moss on one

of the roots which would be evidence that —
Q

I just want to be sure I understand the significance

of the evidence.

So, is your answer yes that if the trees

had grown there your theory would be mistaken? And all the
maps would be mistaken, and all the evidence upon which you
rely?
MR, WARD:

Yes, sir, and all the maps and ail the

work of the Mississippi River Commission and all. of the reports
to Congress, and so forth.

Q

I just wanted to be sure 1 understood the signifi­

cance*
MR* WARD;

In 1882.

and this would bear on the

question that has just been asked

in 1882, the Mississippi

River Commission made the first definitive controlled survey
of the Mississippi Valley#

This was done with great care.

It was tied in with trigometry.

It was tied in with longitude

and latitude, and they got the elevations.
My time is running short.

I do want to save a

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Drew,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H, BREW, ESQ.,
FOR THE RESPONDENT
MR, DREW:

Mr. Chief Justices and may it please the

Court:
The State of Arkansas will agree with the State of
Mississippi on the law.
the law involved.

Apparently, there is no contest of

It will be merely a factual situation that

if Luna Bar, or Luna Island, is the product of an accretion
then, of course, the evidence is that the river and the thalweg
was west of it.

If it, however, did not imperceptibly move,

then the theory of the State of Mississippi — and it being in
the State of Mississippi — would be incorrect.
To go a little further, the State of Arkansas conceded

19
in its inception that* the State of Mississippi raised a primafacie presumption that the river did migrate,

It did not

concede that the river did, in fact, migrate across»
By the testimony of Mr. Kolb, Dr. Kolb, and the.
witnesses for the State of Mississippi, we conceded that they
raised the prima-facie presumption that under normal circum­
stances and accepted principles there is a westward migration
of the river in a bendway of this type.
However, the accepted situation we do not necessarily
agree occurred at that time.

In fact, we think the evidence

is quite to the contrary.
He agree that there are many recorded maps, and
one particular map of — Defendant's Exhibit Ho. 8 -- which
was an ownership map of Washington County, Mississippi, in
1871.

Thismap does not bear out the contention of the State

of Mississippi in any way.
Lloyd's map

Appendix -- the map of 1863,

I believe it's the ninth exhibit in Judge

O'Sullivan's report -- there is an «accre.fcioir-to the northern
side of Carter Point, but this is not the location of Luna
Bar or Luna Island.

It is to the north and completely distant

by two to three miles.
In 1871, all of the maps— and we commence with
the Government Land Office survey of 1823 on the Arkansas bank
-- 1830 on the Mississippi bank.

From those points on, there

is no divided channel in Spanish Moss Bend.

This goes through

20
the Humphreys and Afaott map of 1861 which was the general
reconnaissance map used by General Grant in the conquest of
Vicksburg*

There is the divided channel all the way through in

1871, based upon the maps from the Library of Congress and the
Senate and the other maps, and also the defendant’s exhibit
No* 8 of Washington County*
In 1872, there is a divided channel, apparently based
upon the maps of Mr. E* A. Douglas who was apparently com­
missioned to show the breaches in the levee and to get
Congressional assistance in this area.
Immediately west of Luna Bar there is about a mile,
or so, of levees that are breached, the report of Mr*

of

General Humphreys is that this levee was breached there, but
the waters were not going to the tin soil bottoms, but were
passing back to the main channel of the river.
Mr. Smith, on behalf of the State of Mississippi,
deduced that the caving in the bank above Columbia was in
Spanish Moss Bend,

Historically, Columbia was the first county

seat of Chicot County,

It did, in fact, wash into the river

and caved away and the county seat was subsequently — was
afterward removed,

Columbia no longer exists even in any way

because it all went into the river, and it is some several
miles south of there.
Be that as it may, in 1872, the map of Mr. Douglas,
if we will take the — and assume that the projectlie-like

21
little marking over there is the Mississippi bank, or is Luna
Bar, would be its first appearance.

However, in 1873, there

isn* t any question as to the appearance of Luna Bar or Luna
Island.

Major Suter, commissioned by Congress, made a

reconnaissance of the river.

He was making this reconnaissance

due to the vast flood damage and to make a report to Congress
for assistance therein.
Major Suter, in his map of reconnaissance, which
would be DefendantTs Exhibit Ho. 12, clearly set forth a
bar in the river.

He clearly wrote legend, Spanish Moss

Bend in the eastward channel, and chose the thalweg of the
river in the western channel.

In going through his entire

report, he meticulously has put the legend of the name of the
bend, even when crowded for space, where it; apparently
originally was.
Q

Mr*, Drew, when you refer to these various defendant*s

exhibits, those are Arkansas exhibits and they are not attached
to the Master's Report, but they are here in the file, I take
it?
.

.

MR. DREW;

Yes, Your Honor,

So we know that the island came into existence in
1872.

The first hydrographic survey of the river took place

in 1879-82.

The actual geological survey of the -- the

surveying and all

took place in '71.

The map, and whatever

else shown thereon, continued on through *82, and at that point

22
it shows a divided channel.
The Court’s attention is called to the testimony of
Dr. Kolb and Mr, Smith, and particularly so, sir, with
reference to the elevations of the island, Mr. Guyer had made
a survey line across the island which crosses the north side,
and is clearly in an accretion area, reference line A to B,
C, and I believe it goes to D on to Carter Point,
All of the elevations alluded to by Br„ Kolb and
Mr, Smith were based upon the elevations o£ that reference line
and not. to the highest recorded elevations of the island itself.
If the Court -« please the Court to look at Exhibit
Mo. -“I believe it is Appendix A to the Master’s Report —
you will note tba t the original survey lines of 1823 on the
Arkansas bank, 1830 the Mississippi bank, are shown therein
with heavy pencil.
At the south distal end is the island itself, the
accretions being the portion to the north.

The reference line

crossed over onto the northern portion of the island and not
through the high area.
Based upon the physical maps and what they pictorially
show, there was no accretion to the distal end of Carter Point,
Exhibit D-8e Ownership of Washington County completely shows
Carter Point in its original position.

The other exhibits that

were made about that time also reach that same conclusion,
and, therefore, we know that the island did come into existence

23
in the year 1872, based upon Mr, Douglas' map followed by
Major Suter’s,
Thereafter, there is a divided channel at all times,
but every Mississippi River survey from 1S8Q, the first, all
the way through the present time, there is a divided channel
around the island.
The State of Arkansas employed Dr, Kolb, excuse rae

I think the testimony will be that only a small
portion of the island was out at one time during this suit.
At other times, they had walked across those channels.

But

there is still a major stream going through and it still flows»
Q

Tarpley Cutoff and then 1938.
MR. WEBB:

Q

Navigation is in Tarpley Cutoff -~

And the Leland Cutoff below it since -**
MR, WEBB;

And the Leland Cutoff.

However, it does

not concede that the river is inactive in that area at all.

24

It is

very active*
Q

Is the river boundary, then **- the boundary between

the two States now fixed, or not?
MU WEBB:

Sir, the boundary between Che two States —

I would say it is not fixed except for the evulsion that would
have taken place

in 1872

fixing the channel, in the eastern

channel -Q

It Lias been fixed since 1872?
MU WEBB:

Q

Yes, sir.

But if you are wrong, it isn't fixed yet?

MU WEBB:

That is correct, sir.

Yes, sir.

Dr, Durham and Mr, Spillers made an extensive
geological investigation of the island itself.

The strata of

the soil, sir, its level across -- the same stratas run
uniformly throughout its length.

That is inconsistent with

an accretion which would have bending waves of layers of
soil therein as it accreted and moved outward.
Both Dr; Durham and Mr, Spiller also made lavesfcigafcion as to the pre-existing channels that lie westward even
of Luna Island itself.
The present channel of the western channel -- they
made an extensive study therein and found the low-lying cypress
stumps that grew in place that are lying now in the bottom of
that bed, and also are lying east of the western migration of
the river itself.

25
The evidence — the physical evidence there concludes
that there is, or «as, a low“lying area in there.

However,

had the river migrated westward as contended by the State of
Mississippi, these cypress stumps that are lying east of this
westward migration> that by ring count are over 250 years old,
vjould have been erased.

The State of Mississippi said well,

they could have floated in and landed there.
We could give you a description of logs floating.
The roots are up.

When you saw them off they flop up. They

don’t sink downward.

However, there was testimony by

experienced foresters, these trees were trees that grew in
place.

Their knees, their root systems, and all, are there.

How, this is in the western channel, and not on the island
itself.
On the island itself, in the higher elevation which
will be in that south-central part on Exhibit Appendix A,

The

higher elevation,that is recorded much higher than is shown
by the State of Mississippi.

There are three stumps of

antiquity there, or ancient, that were located by Mr. Putnam
who is now deceased and Mr. Thompson, both experienced
foresters; both testified these stumps are from trees that
grew at that spot they examined them.

The carbon dating of

that stump, by Dr. Iddings, which was that the tree at the
time of its death was 550 years plus or minus ISO.
As I understand the carbon dating, the longer the

26
half life is computed the smaller the figure.

The time

element involved in having established a tree of antiquity
much greater than the 100-year period that would be involved
herein, it was not run any longer.

This particular tree was

the red mulberry stump, sir, that was 84 years old by ring
count at the time of its death.

Even without the carbon dating,

we know that from the surveys thereafter the 1882 survey the
tree mess was there gone, this tree, if growing there at that
time, had been dead at least by that time which was prior to the
Government * s survey.
The other two trees, one a red mulberry and the
other a black walnut, the black walnut was flagged and left in
place by Mr. Thompson.
old.

The ring count thereon was 112 years

There was no attempt to carbon date it.

It also had beep-

dead longer than the period of time involved and was of age
there.

The other was the red mulberry, with 112 years or

some, exactly, I do not recall.
Had the river moved imperceptibly westward, as
contended by the presumption raised by the State of Mississippi,
these stumps could not have existed.

Further, we have the

testimony of Mr. Richard Proctor, who is an elderly man that
I have known all of my life, since I was born and raised within
two miles of this spot,

Mr. Proctor testified, and, if you will

note, his testimony came in as:- not solicited but a voluntary
thing, that on this island he was asked a question and he

27
remembered going up» on the island and going into a cistern
and taking a mink„
We further had the testimony of Dr,

-- I am sorry

his name escapes me -- the gentleman with the stereopics
who could see.

Judge O’Sullivan could not; however, he

contended he found evidence of human habitation in the aerial
photographs of 1930«
Q

What kind of vegetation, and particularly trees,

are on the island •*- are on Luna Bar today?
MR, DREW:
Q

At this time, sir?

Yes,
HR, DREW:

At this time, sir, on the highest

elevation on the very top it is a field.

There are approximately

800 acres of land adjacent on the accreted areas that have
soft timber and willows that our foresters valued at $500 an
acre greater at the stump.

There are other species of trees,

hard wood, that this is quite valuable land, sir,
Q

Any red mulberries or black walnuts?
MR* DREW:

Q

Yes, sir,

There has been talk in the papers here about primary

growth and secondary growth and climax growth, which is very
unfamiliar to me —
MR, DREW;

The climax series of trees are all on the

higher elevation surrounding the field.

On the lower elevation,

there are only trees of the primary species.

Q

But on the higher elevations» are there red

mulberries -~
MR, DREW:

There are only trees of the secondary

and primary species on the highest elevations,
This was one of the things that one of the foresters
called the Court’s attention to.

Hot the tree itself and

the present living tree and its age, but the complete variety
of trees that are now growing there, is inconsistent with
trees with newly formed lands as contended by the State of
Mississippi*
The Mississippi River Commission itself, in the
historical study for the Tarpley Cutoff, made a survey, a
historical study which is Defendant's Exhibit No. 32, wherein
the State of Mississippi — the Mississippi River Commission
itself, made the historical study and a map showing the ac­
cretions and whatnot, from 1880 to date,

Their historical

study also does not support the presumption of the State of
Mississippi,
Further, Dr. Fisk, in the geological investigation of
the Mississippi River alluvial valley and its ancient courses,
from Cape Gerardo, Missouri, to Donaldsville, Missouri, which
was Dependant's Exhibit Ho0 30, completely supports the
contention of the State of Arkansas, completely supports
Dr, Durham and Mr. Spillers,

It completely negates the

presumption of the State of Mississippi.

29
In its geological investigation, Dr, Fisk shows
the area of the island we were just discussing with the
secondary and the primary frees thereon as Ancient Course
Ho. 10,

In the hierarchy of the years on the ancient courses,

they fixed them by centuries, 10th Century, 11th, 12th, up
to the present time, however, they go back to antiquity.
Dr. Fisk also shows that the higher elevation from
which the red mulberry, the walnut and all these others were
taken, as well as the type forestation,has to be in Channel
No, 10 or in existence more than several hundred of years.
Vie had the Defendant’s Exhibit Ho, 39 which is a
county map of Chicot County, prepared by Mr, W. A. Mala, who
at that time was the county surveyor, who shows clearly the
Luna Island bar area as being within the State of Mississippi,
It is the contention of the State of Arkansas that
the report by Honorable Mr. Judge O’Sullivan is erroneous in
that it adopts the depth or the elevation theory of the State
of Mississippi on a reference line without regard to the
true elevation of the island from where the physical facts
of antiquity were discovered.

Secondly, the map area does

not support the contentions in any way,

in fact, negates it,

Me believe that the State of Arkansas has completely
negated the presumption raised by Dr, Kolb or by Mr, Smith
with: physical, factual, evidence that makes the fact that this
would be a part of Mississippi an impossibility.
