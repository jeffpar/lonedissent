Mr. Friedman, you may proceed whenever you are ready
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESC?. ,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a direct appeal from an order of the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
which after trial dismissed a government civil antitrust case
challenging the condemnation of two large coal companies in
Illinois as violating section 7 of the Clayton Act.
As is true in most of these merger cases, the issues
relate to the proper definition of the relevant product and
geographic markets and, then the final question, whether within
those markets the effect of the merger may be substantially to
lessen competition.
Tile two companies involved are the Freeman Coal
Company, which in effect is the acquiring company, and the
United Electric Coal Companies, which is the acquired company.
There was not a direct acquisition of one company by the other
however.

The acquisition came about in this fashion:
Since 1942, a firm called Material Service Company,

4
which was primarily in the building trade material business,
owned all of the stock of the Freeman Coal Company.

Beginning

in 1954,, the Material Service Company started to acquire stock
of United Electric, the acquired company# and by 1959 it had
acquired 34 percent of the stock of United Electric.

At that

time, the President of Freeman became the chief executive of­
ficer of United Electric,, and at the same time, five new members
of the board were appointed to United Electric, four of them
being people connected with Freeman and Material Service,
Q

In 1959?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

You went a little fast for me.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

That was in 1959.

I’m sorry.

Material was the dominant stockholder in Freeman?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Material owned all of Freeman since

1942.
Q

Was the sole stockholder of Freeman.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
0

The sole stockholder.

And Freeman began acquiring United Electric's

stock —
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Material Service.

Material Service# not Freeman?

MR, FRIEDMAN:

That's right, it began acquiring United

Electric stock in .1954.
Q

And did so during the period between 554 and ’59,

at- which time it had acquired something over 30 percent?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Q

34 percent.

And at that time the — you were going to tell

us, the officers and directors —
MR. FRIEDMAN:

At that time, the President of Freeman

became the head of the executive committee of United Electric,
and there was a shift in the board of directors, there was a
nine-man board, five new members were appointed to the board,
four of whom were directly connected with either Material
Service or Freeman, that is the company or companies that had
control.
Q

And the other 66 percent of the stock of United

Electric in 1959 was broadly held, or held how?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Medium broadly held.

Some of it was

held I think by — I will come to that in a minute as to what
happened.
Q

All right.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

But I want to stress the fact that

both of the expert economists in this case, both the government
expert and the appellees expert, testified that as a result of
these

events in 1959, Material Service then obtained control

of United Electric.
Now, the next step in this somewhat complicated series
of transactions took place a few months later in 195?? when the
appellee General Dynamics Corporation acquired all the stock of

Material Service and# as a result of that acquisition, it in
turn got 34 percent of the stock of United Electric.

General

Dynamics then continued to acquire the stock of United Electric
and by 1966 —■
Q

Directly or through Freeman?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

I believe directly.

I think it -~

So then Freeman owned 34 percent of the stock

and General Dynamics began from zero number o£ shares and begun
building up its ownership?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

General Dynamics, of course, indirectly

owned all of Freeman through Material Service.
Q

But Freeman owned the 34 percent?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Freeman owned the 34 percent, but of

course at that point on General Dynamics has complete control
of Freeman.
Q

I know, but —

Q

2 thought Material owned 34 percent?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I'm sorry, Material, I’m sorry, Mr.

Justice.
Q

But not Freeman?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Freeman did not own any of the stock of

the — and it is my understanding that the stock after General
Dynamics

acquired control of Material Services, it was then

General Dynamics that in turn proceeded to acquire more United
Electric Stock until in 1966 it had, together with the 34

7
percent owned by Material Service , roughly two-thirds of the
stock of United

Electric.

At that point in 1966, General

Dynamics made a tender offer for the balance of United Electric
stock and got all of it, sad the following year, in 1967, United
Electric became, through a corporate merger, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of General Dynamics.
Q

Well, when in the government's view was the

acquisition then in this case?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

We say the acquisition was in 1959,

but we say moreover the acquisition continued to be solidifed
up until 1967.

But we think 1959 was the acquisition and that,

as I will develop, is an important factor in connection with
the claim —•
Q

I know it is, and therefore you can't say well

it was in '59 and it was also in 1967.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, we think it was in '59.

There is

a dispute as to that, but we think in 1959
Q

The date is quite important, isn't it?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

It is, yes, Mr. Justice.

And we think

in 1959 there was an acquisition because, as a practical
matter, as showing what happened, they got control of the
company..
Q

General Dynamics wasn’t there at all.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, United Electric —» Xasn sorry,

Material Services got control of United Electric and as a

resuit of Material Service wholly owning Freeman — and this in.
effect at that point resulted in a combination and the kind of
acquisition at which section 7 was directed.
Q

Now, is there any dispute between the parties to

this case (a) as to whether or not there was an acquisition
1

within the meaning of section 7, and (b) as to when that
acquisition took place?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

I don’t believe, Mr. Justice, that they

challenged there was an acquisition.

I think, I am not certain,

they may disagree that the acquisition took place in 1959.

I

am not sure of that.
Q

As I read your brief, you kept giving alterna­

tive *59 or 1966, and it seemed to rae that the date can be
rather critical,
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

I think, Mr. Justice, after

further study of the case, we would say that the acquisition
did take place in 1959.
Q

But you think there may not be agreement between

you and your brother on that?
MR, FRIEDMAN:

I think there may not.

Mr. Hedlimd

will have to answer that question.
Q

All right.

Q

When did the government file its complaint in

this case?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

In 1969 — I’m sorry, 1967, in

G

September 1967.
Now, there are in the United States four major coal
producing areas, and the one that we are concerned with in this
case is an area in the Midwest which we refer to as the Eastern
Interior Coal Province, a phrase that is derived from descrip­
tions in the U.S. Geological Survey maps.

It consists of

central and southern Illinois, parts of western Indiana, and
western Kentucky,

All of the mines of both of these companies

are not only located in the province, as I shall refer to it,
but in central and southern Illinois.
Both of these companies, Freeman and United Electric,
are old and substantial companies.
mine in .1922.

Freeman got its first coal

in the year 1959, it produced about seven

million tons, and it had revenues of $32 million.
Freeman's coal is mined from deep mines.

All of

They put shafts down

and mine the coal out of the deep ground.
United Electric is even older, it was formed in. 1919,
and in 1959 it had production of
$15 million.
company.

3.5 million tons, sales of

United Electric has been an extremely profitable

It had profits in 1959 of $1,.8 million, and it has

one of the highest profit margins of any company in the coal
business.

It, unlike Freeman, is engaged only in strip-mining.

It digs a hela, it takes the side off of a mountain and pulls
the coal out, without going deep down into the ground with a
shaft associated with deep mining.

There have been some rather dramatic changes in the
coal industry since World War II.

After World War XI, the coal

industry lost its entire railroad business, which at one point
had been its mainstay,to diesel oil.

In addition, there was a

sharp trend away from the use of coal in household heating
and in many industrial \ises.

And in the seven years from 1947

to 1954, the production of coal in this country dropped sharply,
more than a third.
But since 1954, coal has mad© a substantial comeback
as a fuel, due primarily to the tremendous market it has been
able to develop with the electric utility interests.

And as

there has been a great expansion in the production of electric
power in the last twenty years or so, so has the production of
coal increased, and the result is that by 1967 and 1968, the
production was almost back to the post-war 1947 level.
Now, most of the coal that is sold to the electric
utilities is sold under long-terra contrast, usually five to ten
years, some of them longer.

And, in addition, when a utility

is planning to install a large generating station, which is
going to call for a substantial amount of coal over the life of
the generating station, it insists, quite understandably, that
the utility be able to be certain of an adequate supply of
coal from the coal company before it will sign the contract.
That is, the coal company has to satisfy it that it has ade­
quate reserves.

11
Now, let mo speak, briefly of the reserves f because
that is a critical issue in the case.

At the time of the

acquisition in .1955, United Electric had 81 million tons of
strip reserves and 27 million tons of deep reserves, a total
of slightly more than 100 million tons.
Q

All in this area?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

All in the State of Illinois, Mr,

Justice, all in the State of Illinois.

The record shows that

since that time, most of these strip reserves have been com­
mitted,

although they still have what we consider substantial

strip reserves at this time.

They also, after that time,

acquired about 50 million ton in deep reserves which have not
been mined.
Now, when we talk of reserves, the description, of
them, they are always spoken of as being economically minable
or economically recoverable.

What is meant by that is that

they treat, as reserves coal which, with the present level of
technology and the present price structure of coal, can be
taken out of the ground and sold at. a profit.

Of course, as

we knew, what may be economically minable today may not be
economically minable next year.

Techniques, for example, have

improved remarkably in strip raining.

Coal that twenty years

ago was considered far too deep to get out of the ground can
now be extracted with new modern machinery.
We ar© all familiar with the energy crisis today, and.

12
it seems not unreasonable that, as other fossil fuels become
scarces efforts will be made to mine coal fchafch&itherto has been
considered not economically minahl©.

And it may well be that

as the price of coal goes up, the reserves that ware once con­
sidered rather hopeless will suddenly take a new lease on life.
In addition to that, coal people tend to be rather
conservative in estimating 'their reserves, and a former
president of the United Electric, Mr. Colby, testified that
©very strip mine that they opened in fact turned out to have
more reserves than they had estimated.

That statement is at

page 144 of the record.
Mow let me just describe briefly the situation within
both the Eastern Interior Coal Province and the State of
Illinois.

And I should add, I will com® to it in a few minutes,

the government alleged in this case that there were two relevant
markets, one was the State of Illinois, the other is what we
call the Eastern Interior Coal Province Sales Area, which is an
area comprising eight states contiguous to and surrounding the
province .
The production of coal in both the province and in the
State of Illinois is today highly concentrated.

We have set

forth at page 6 of our brief a table giving the statistics.

I

i

will not repeat fchara here because there are a lot of statistics.
But the fact is that a relatively small number of producers
have the major share of coal production in these two areas.

la the same period, from 195? to 196? —- .let me coma
back and say these tables we have in the brief also show that
from 1957 to 1967, concentration increased.
In the same period, the actual number of producers
of coal in the state of Illinois dropped 73 percent, from 144
to 39.

Now, it is quite true, as the appellees point out, that

many of these coal producers disappeared because they were
small producers whose mines were exhausted or who lost their
markets.

On the other hand, there is an exhibit in the record,

at pages 101 to 106, of what we call th© exhibit appendices
— there is an eight-volume printed appendix before this Court.
The transcript portions and the exhibit portions are separately
paginated.

And at pages 101 to 106, there is an exhibit

showing that 21 or 22 independent coal mines in the province
ware absorbed through merger from 1905 to 1368.
Nov?

within these two concentrated markets, the

province and the State of Illinois, Freeman and United Electric
each had significant shares.

Again, we have a detailed table

at page 58 of our brief giving these figures.

Freeman was the

second largest coal producer in both the province and the state.
It had 7 percent of production in the province and 14 percent
in the state.

United Electric was the sixth largest in the

province, the eighth largest in Illinois.

Xfc had 4„3 percent

of the production in the province and 8 percent of the produc­
tion in Illinois

The record also shows that Freeman and United
Electric «eII approximately half of. their production to common
customers, and the major portion of half of their production is
sold to the same facilities of the same customers.

That is,

each of them sells coal to the same plant of the same customer,
and the record also shows
0

These customers being electric utilities pri­

marily?
MR. FRIEDMANi

Mainly, primarily electric utilities,

a few heavy industry, there are some cement plants, but mainly
electric utilities.
Q

Is metallurgical coal used for fuel?

MR. FRIEDMANs

No, it is not, Mr, Justice.

let me explain the situation on that.

United

United Electric does not

produce any metallurgical coal.
Q

What about Freeman?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Freeman produces approximately 8 per­

cent of its product as metallurgical coal.

But the major share

the overwhelming share of Freeman’s production is coal that is
used for the same basic purpose as United Electric’s, that is
as fuel to produce heat,largely boiler fuel for electric
utilities»
The record also shews that even at the present time
salesmen from both United Electric and Freeman continue to
solicit the same customers, and the testimony is that they did

that before the merger as well as after.
In dismissing the government’s complaint, the District
Court basically made three holdings.

First, the District Court

said the relevant market in this case is not coal, as the
government contended, but a broader category which it described
as the energy market.

That is, in addition to coal, the

District Court said you had to take account of oil, natural gas,
and nuclear power.
Secondly, the District Court said that the government*
two proposed geographic markets, the Eastern Interior Province
Sales Area and the State of Illinois, were, as they described
them, unrealistic, and instead the District Court proposed —
suggested there should be ten different geographic markets
which the defendants had proposed.

We have set them out in

this little colored diagram opposite page 48 of our brief.
And in this diagram each special color is a single geographic
market, according to the District Court.
The way these ten markets were determined is as
follows:

There, are four freight rate districts within the

State of Illinois, and under the Interstate Commerce Commission
freight regulation, all mines in a single freight district
have the same freight rate to a single facility.

So the court

said we will take each of these separate freight rate districts
and treat that as a separate section of the country.

But then

the District Court did not include in the single freight rate

16
all utility and non-utility customers.

The District Court

broke it up and said one market is tbs utility customers in
th® freight rate district, another market is the non-utility
customers„
The District Court excluded, however, from these four
freight rate districts the largest customer of both companies,
which is Commonwealth Edison, to which each of them sells ap­
proximately 25 percent of its production, and said that the
Commonwealth Edison plant constituted a separate geographic
market.

Those are shown in the little black dots in our map,

and, rather interestingly,one of them is in one of the freight
rate geographic markets, another one is in the Chicago market,
which is the last market, and another one is in the third one,
and three of them are rot in any market.
And finally the court said that the Chicago Air
Pollution. Control District, in which there are certain special
requirements imposed with respect to avoiding pollution limita­
tions on the kinds of fuels you can burn and so cnf that was a
separate geographic market.
Then the court went on and said that in any ©vent, if
you looked at these markets„ and it said even'accepting the
government*s markets the result would be the same, they said
there was no adverse effect on competition.

The rationale of

that decision was basically two- or three-fold,
Pirst, the court said that United reserves are

17
presently committed, and the government hasn’t shown that
there were any economically minabis strip coal reserves that
United could acquire.

It pointed out, the court pointed out

that United Electric, having always been in the strip-mining
business, didn’t have the necessary skills, it said, to go
into the deep mining business, and therefore you couldn’t coneider United Electric's deep mines as reflecting any poten­
tiality to engage in meaningful competition in the coal busi­
ness.
And then the court finally said that it viewed
United Electric and Freeman as complimentary rather than com­
petitive.

Apparently, when one reads -the opinion, the theory

shems to be, again, because one is a strip mins firm and the
i

other is a deep coal mine.
' •’

Q

Well, part of it is the kind of coal they sell.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
0

It is the kind of —

And what kind of customers they have?

MR, FRIEDMAN:

It is seme of that, but it doesn't,

the court doesn't say that exactly.

What the court says at

page 61 of the jurisdictional statement, where the opinion is
repeated, what the court says is these companies have been and
are now predominantly complimentary in nature.

United Electric

is a strip-mining company, with no experience in deep mining
or the likelihood of acquiring it.

Freeman is a deep-mining

company with n.c experience or expertise in strip-mining.

And

18
then he goes on and he cays Freeman sells metallurgical coal,
United does not and cannot.
Now, again, as X have indicated in my answer to
Justice Powell’s question, Freeman's sales of metallurgical coal,
are a very small portion of its output.

Freeman sells a by­

product known as dust, which is primarily from its production
of ~~
Q

What about excluding Commonwealth Edison, none

of the sales by United Electric in the two critical years chosen
by you would have or culd have been competitive with Freeman had
the two companies been independent?
HR., FRIEDMAN:
Q

Now what about that?

We disagree with that.

Well, this is a flat finding though, isn’t it?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is a flat finding, but our basic

answer —
Q

Well, how are we going to — must we turn that

over for you to win?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I don’t think so, Mr. Justice.

Let me

explain —
Q

Well, let’s assume, you took that, let’s assume

you agreed with the District Court on his competitive, non­
competition findings.

Everything that he said you agreed with.

Wouldn’t if almost make irrelevant whatever may be wrong with
his product and geographical market?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, we don’t think so.

Wa don’t think

X<5

so, Mr. Justice, and let me explain the reason why v?e don * b
think so.,

We think that the proper approach in these cases,

as this Court has repeatedly said, is to consider the structure
of the market, consider the structure of the market to see what
happens in a market.
Q

I understand that, but some of the things he

says in his finding on competition, it wouldn't seem he me to
make much difference what the
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Well, I think, Mr, Justice —

-— even if you looked at coal as the market,

like you suggest, you would still arrive at his conclusion.
And even if you used -your geographical markets, you would
arrive at the same conclusion.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think, Mr, Justice, he is using .

when he says these sales are not competitive, he uses it in a.
very, very narrow sense, not as we define competition within
the meaning of section 7.

What he is saying is that he looks

and says here are 20,000 tons shipped to this plant and 30,000
tons shipped to this plant, and these are not competitive be­
cause if they had been separate companies obviously the one
wouldn't have sold to the other.

We think that is not the

kind of competition to which the protections of section ? are
restricted.
What we are dealing with hare is two large firms,
each of which is trying to sell its coal in the area, and that.,

it seems to us, is the critical thing and the critical thing
about this merger.

The vice of this merger, we think, is that

this is taken in a concentrated market, where there is an in­
creasing tend toward concentration, and this has resulted in a
substantial increase in the concentration, and that we think
the teachings of this Court have indicated that ie enough, that
is enough to make the merger prima facie illegal unless there
is sane justification presented.
Q

Well, let's assume wa agreed with you, that the

court erred in the product market, that, coal is a product
market.

Would the Court have to get to deal at all with the

District Court's views about effect on competition?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

y

Well, the Court could reverse on the

market definitions and remand for the District Court to con­
sider the case further in the light of those.

We would think,

however, since there is a. full record before this Court, and
since the basic facts on which wo base our case are really not
disputed, we think it would be appropriate, as the Court has
done in many other cases, if it finds there are errors in the
definition of the relevant markets to then go on and decide
the competitive issue in the case.
And let me address myself a bit to — let me just say
one other thing, if I may.

The last statement, at the end of

the District Court's opinion, at pages 65 to 66 of the juris­
dictional statement, just before the very end of it, he says,

21
under -these circumstances, that all the mining reserves have
been sold and United Electric has neither the possibility of
acquiring more nor the ability to develop deep coal reserves,
under these circumstances continuation of the affiliation be­
tween United Electric and Freeman is not adverse to competi­
tion nor would divestiture benefit competition even were this
court to accept the government's unrealistic product and geo­
graphic market definitions.
It seems to us that what the court is saying here is
basically the court doesn’t think that divestiture relief is
appropriate, that divestiture relief would in any way improve
competition.

That it seems to us is putting the cart very

definitely before the horse because before you decide what is
an appropriate remedy in the case, you have to decide whether
or not the merger violates section 7, whether its effect, may
be substantially to lessen competition.
Q

As I read this record — I haven’t gone through

entirely, of course, but I get the impression that we have
here in totality a rather large monopoly, a fuel monopoly, oil
companies, gas companies owning coal companies and owning
uranium companies.

Is that right?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Q

Well, there is no —

Does that bear upon this problem before us?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I don’t think so, Mr. Justice.

we do have I think is that we have the coal business.

What
The; coal

business here we think is controlled, there is an oligopolistic
type of market.

We have a relatively small number of producers

that own most of the coal and produce most of the coal.

In-

addition to that, we do have evidence relating to the competi­
tion between coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear power, and so on,
the different types of fuel.
But there is no claim here that there is any sort of
combined monopoly involving different types of energy.

Our case

here is directed against the situation in the coal industry.
Q

That is not affected by the fact that if this, if

I read the record correctly, there is a monopoly of oil and gas
over coal?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mo, no, no.

What there is evidence is

that in recent years some of the large oil companies have gone
into the coal business for —■
Q

I understand 25 of them have.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I don’t know how many, but we know

there is a substantial number.

Now, we do know, for example,

one of the things that I think is significant, the argument has
been made here that United Electric, because it is a stripmining company, couldn’t possibly mine any of its deep mines.
In 1958 or 1959, a subsidiary of the Humble Oil
Company, which is a very large company, opened a deep mine.
Humble Oil Company had never been in the coal mining business
at all.

It was able to acquire the skills and open a large

deep mine and it expects to produce I think thres million tons
a year and has entered into a contract to sell this coal to a
large utility.

Q

As I understand your argument, it runs exactly

counter to the suggestions contained in the question of Brother
Douglas, because the District Court thought that the relevant
market was the energy market, and you said he was quite wrong
in that, he should have confined himself to coal alone.
MR. FRIEDMAN: .Yes, but I thought — I?m sorry, per­
haps I misunderstood Mr. Justice —
Q

I was wondering if that is why the District

Court got off on that trail of the energy —
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No.

I think what the District Court

did was, the District Court concluded that because there is
obviously competition among these different forms of energy
in selling to the utilities, he concluded therefore you should
evaluate the impact of this merger in this broader energy
market.
Q

And you say that was quite erroneous, that the

relevant market is coal, period.
MR, FRIEDMAN:

That's right — well, if I may modify

that, Mr. Justice, we say that there may be an energy market
in some types of mergers, but we say that coal is an alterna­
tive market.

There is •— I think the teachings of this Court

have indicated there is usually no single relevant product

market, there may be product markets, and sub-market©.

And we

think that coal, under the practical, indicia test announced in
Brown Shoe, that coal is a relevant sub-market within which to
measure the impact of this merger upon competition.
Q

You don’t deny the existence of an energy market

area as such, do you?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, no, no.

And, Mr. Chief Justice,

for example, if we had a merger between an oil company, a
natural gas company and a coal company, the energy market might
be the relevant market.

All that we say is that whether or not

there is an energy market, there is in addition to that a coal
market, and that a coal market is a relevant market within
which to determine the effect upon competition, of the merger of
these two coal companies.
Q

And specifically within the geographic market of

the Eastern Interior Coal Province?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Coal Province Sales Area and the State

cf —
0

Which is what, one of five or four provinces?

MR, FRIEDMAN:

Well, there are basically four

provinces, and we have gone beyond the province to include a
slightly broader area which is where -the vast majority of coal
produced in the provinces — we say within that and the State
of Illinois is the geographic markets, and viewing the relevant
market for this case as coal, that within that market this

merger doer, met the standards that this Court has developed in
a large number of cases to determine prime facie the anti­
competitive effect.
Wow, the basic answer that was given by the District
Court in this case, and is given by our opponents here, is that,
well, as a practical matter, United Electric really isn't a
viable competitor at all.

They say United Electric, as of the

time of trial, was about to exhaust its resources.

United

Electric had almost all of its strip mines committed«.

United

Electric doesn’t have the capacity to mine the deep coal and,
therefore, they say the disappearance of United Electric
through merger could not possibly substantially lessen compe­
tition.
This, it seems to us, is basically another version of
i

the traditional failing company defense. In the traditional

failing company defense, the company is failing because of its
lack of financial resources.

It doesn’t have any resources.

Wow, it seems to us that this defense has to he

the same claim.

And the reason is it is fundamentally

It is fundamentally the claim that although it

might appear on its face- that an acquisition substantially
lessens competition because of the change it makes in the

structure of the market? in fact, it really doesn’t, because
if there hadn't been the. merger the acquired company would
have disappeared from the market anyhow in a short time, and
therefore the fact that it disappears as a result of a merger
rather than through the operation of natural economic forces
can’t be viewed as substantially lessening competition,,
We think this argument is Salacious for several
reasons, the first of which is that this Court has made it clear
that the validity of this defense must be tested at the time of
the merger, because the question is whether as of the time of
the merger the effect may be substantially to lessen competition
and you have to look and see whether the removal of this firm
by merger has an adverse competitive effect on the basis of
what its position was when it disappeared from the market.

And

therefore we think that the critical time was as of 1959.,
As of 1959, it certainly cannot be said that the con­
dition of this company's resources was so depleted, and so hope­
less that it couldn't possibly continue for any significant
period.

At that time, United Electric had substantial reserves

of strip coal.

There is nothing to indicate that at that time

all of those reserves were committed.

There is an indication

that since that time other firms had acquired strip reserves,
but more important than that, it is just impossible at this time
on the basis of hindsight fourteen years later to say what
United Electric would have done if United Electric had remained

an independent firm, how it would have solved its problems•,

The appellees point out that the mine was spectacularly un­
successful.

It lost money nine of the eleven years.

The tes­

timony, however, is not that it lost money because they didn’t
know how to operate the mine but because the mine was a bad
one, the roofing wasn't right, and the man said frankly "we
sold the coal for too little money.u
It can’t fairly be said — and we also have the ex­

Q

Mr. Friedman, what did Freeman do between 1959

and the date of trial with respect to the acquisition of addi­
tional reserves?
ME. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Of strip reserves or deep reserves?

Any kind of reserves.

MR. FRIEDMAN*

I am not certain- Mr. Justice, but

Freeman, of course, had a very large, much greater reserves
than United Electric at the time of this acquisition.

I would

suggest, Mr. Justice, that the whole history of extractive in­
dustries in America is that you have a problem if you are in
an industry where you are using up your raw materials» you
have to go out and acquire additional — they did around 1959
or 1960, United Electric did acquire this very large deep mins.
And also the testimony is that after 1959, United
Electric was willing to acquire more reserves but they only
wanted to pay farm prices for them, that is they would buy land
with strip reserves at the prices one would ordinarily pay for
farm land.

New, we don't know what an independent United

Electric would have done.

It might have concluded that it was

willing to pav more for tills land.
had to buy it.

It might have decided it

Jill that I am suggesting is it — I don't think

it can fairly he said at this point of time that if United
Electric had remained independent it would have found no way to
solve its problem.
Q

Did the total reserves of General Dynamics, that

is controlled by General Dynamics through these two subsidiaries
increase substantially between '59 and date of trial?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I understand so.

I don’t have the ex­

act figures.
Q

That would be in the record, I suppose?

29
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think so.

The record is huge and,

while I have looked through the 3,500 pages, frankly I haven’t
been able to check every exhibit.

But I am told by my

colleague who tried the case that the record dees show, and I
think it is a fair assumption that somewhere in the 17,000
pages of record there are statistics —
Q

The thought underlying my question is that

General Dynamics, with its vast resources, was perhaps in. a
better position to acquire additional reserves than either one
of these companies independently w~uld have been.

I wondered

whether it exercised that economic power that it had.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, let me say, Mr. Justice, there

is an exhibit in the record that shows that United Electric
was a very prosperous company.

It kept increasing its profits,

it paid substantial dividends to General Dynamics during the
period that General Dynamics controlled it.
of its long-term debts.

It paid off all

It might have found it more difficult

'than General Dynamics to acquire coal, but again we don’t know.
We fust can’t say,

And since section 7 is dealing with prob­

abilities, not with certainties, but probabilities, it condemns
mergers where the effect may be substantially to lessen compe­
tition.
Now, let me just say one ether thing with respect to
this failing company or failing resources defense.

This Court,

in both the Citizen Publishing case and in the newspaper case,

30
the cond.cs, Greater Buffalo Fresco, has said that, among other
things, for this defense to be available you have to show that
the firm to whom the property was sold was the only available
purchaser.

There is nothing in this record to show that

United Electric could have sold its property or dispose of its
property only to Freeman or Material Service.
The initiative for this transaction did not come from
United Electric.

United Electric, according to the record,

has nothing to show that it approached Material Service and said
we are in trouble, will you take us on.

To the contrary, the

initiative came from Material Service which looked and saw
this as an attractive company and it frankly said it was
attractive because it recognised that its resources were
dwindling, Freeman had large resources, and therefore it would
seem like an attractive opportunity for it to combine its resources with this company.
And nor is there any indication in this record -that
United Electric made other attempts to solve its problem, such
as seeing if some way couidn91 be worked out to.get this coal,
this deep coal out of the ground.

And we think that the

appellees have not, have not made the kind of showing that this
Court has said is necessary before a failing company or failing
resources defense can be sustained.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Friedman.

Mr. Hedlund?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF REUBEN L. HEDLUND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. HEDLUND;

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The government lost this case be lev? not because of
the legal issues that they would try to raise here but because
of the controlling facts in issue.

As I will develop in my

argument, these were head-on controversies which Chief Judge
Robson, as the trier of fact, decided against the government
on the basis of a meticulous two-year review of all of the
evidence in this lengthy trial record.

Thus, it is our posi­

tion, contrary to that of my distinguished opponent, that the
real issue before this Court on appeal is whether these find­
ings were clearly erroneous.
There are five factual determinations below which 1
particularly —
Q

Was there a finding that this merger would not

have an adverse effect on competition, is subject to that
clearly erroneous —
MR. HEDLUND:

I think that the facts which support

that legal conclusion are —
Q

So your answer is no?

MR. HEDLUND:

My answer to that is no.

There are five controlling factual determinations

32
balov? which

I

particularly want to list before focusing on

the evidentiary support and implications.

As to the central

facts found against the government s case,, these included,
first# the fact that the acquired company. United Electric,
is dead competitively in all of the markets alleged, including
those urged by the government., and it cannot be resurrected.
Second, it was found that United Electric and Freeman
would not and could not compete with each other to any substan­
tial degree, and that was a fact, whatever the lines of com­
merce and whatever the sections of the country chosen.
Third, it was found that the combination had been in
effect since 1959, and the evidence was that it had not adverse­
ly affected competition, however that competition was defined,
Fourth, it was found that present in the markets
served by United Electric-Freeman were large, sophisticated
buyers, wielding substantial bargaining power, and practiced
in the ability of playing one coal company against the other
and coal itself against alternative forms of energy.

This

fact spoke convincingly in explanation of why is the govern­
ment virtually admitted and, as the court found below, there
.had been abundant competition in the Midwest coal industry in
the past which was certain to continue.

Moreover, the fact

that purchasers of coal and other fuels were made by powerful
sophisticated buyers placed the merger in a totally different
factual context than that present in other section 7 cases

before this Court, most notably Von's Grocery, Pabsfc, and
Philadelphia National Bank.
Fifth, based on a virtual and unprecedented census in
this record of the very consumers on whose behalf this action
was purportedly brought, including carefully reasoned testi­
mony from buyers of more than one-half of all the coal pro­
duced in the Midwest, Chief Judge Robson found that, quoting
from page 65a of the jurisdictional statement, "Evidence from
numerous knowledgeable industry representatives f including
competitors and customers of United Electric and Freeman,
confirms the defendant's contention that the challenged combin­
ation has not led and is not likely to lead to a substantial
lessening of competition."
In developing these now, and turning to the facts —

Q

One of the findings that you have just reviewed

was that the acquisition took place in 1959, and you accept
that, X assume?
MR, HEDLUND:
our position at trial.

Yes, Mr, Justice.

In fact, that was

At trial the government took a con­

trary position.
Q

But now the government agrees with you?

MR. HEDLUND:
0

Now the government agrees with us.

So my earlier questions are red herring, X mean

there is no dispute about that.
MR. HEDLUND:

They have been answered, Mr. Justice.

34
Q

Is there any indication why, if this had the

adverse effect on competition, the government waited eight
years after the acquisition to bring the action?
MR» HEDLUND:

There is no explanation of that in the

record at all, Mr. Justice Relinquish, and which brings up a
point that we have made in our brief, that section 7 cases and
section 7 itself was designed to deal with insipient mergers,
with a merger whose anticompetitive affect was ripening.

This

factual situation, far from ripening into an anticompetitive
effect, first of all it never had one and, secondly, the combin­
ation is in effect over at this point.
In turning to the facts, I respectfully direct the
Court's attention to the proposed findings filed by defendants
in the trial court, and particularly the numerous citations to
the record that appear therein.

These proposed findings are at

pages 880 to 1016 of the joint appendix and are a virtual
encyclopedia of the facts and the evidence in this case.
Now, among the most compelling of the central deter­
minations made below is that United Electric is just not a
competitive factor in any of the markets alleged, including
those suggested by the government, and it cannot become one.
And while this was one of the most hotly disputed issues at
trial, the trial court's findings on United Electric's terminal
condition are no longer seriously challenged by the government
in this appeal.

35
I will say that X think that since the briefs and
Mr, Friedman's argument today that perhaps they have gone back
to that.

But in any event, as the court below found, United

Electric was and is a competitively moribund Illinois coal
producer which by the close of this current year will be oper­
ating only two strip mines of the six it had when the acquisi­
tion took place fourteen years ago.

Virtually all of United

Electric's minable coal reserves have bean sold pursuant to
long-term contracts with utilities and it has no realistic
hope of obtaining additional reserves to serve any of the
markets alleged by the parties to this litigation.
Precisely to this point was the trial testimony of
A. H, Davis, President of Central Illinois Light Company,

When

asked by the government on cross-examination whether he was in
any position to say that United Electric-Freeman combination
would have no effect on his company, he responded as follows
— this is at page 1213 of the joint appendix:

"Well, we have

studied the United Electric reserves, Mr. Sims, and we just
can't see where United Electric has the reserves to be a factor
in the coal business as far as we are concerned.”
United Electric is in fact a company that has been in
liquidation for a goodly number of years, and that process
cannot be reversed.

It was in anticipation of this that led

the company in the 1960*8 — I*m sorry, in the 1950’s unsuccess­
fully, as the court noted below — and that is at page 8a of

36

the jurisdictional statement — to seek affiliation with other
coal producers.

And when Freeman obtained control of United

Electric in 1959, it found a company with only a short-term
supply of rainable reserves.
Irrefutable evidence of this is contained in a lengthy
memorandum by the company’s land manager, United Electric's land
manager, soma twenty years ago, in November 1955, four years
before the control took place.
of exhibits, at page 1645.

This appears in the appendix

In this memorandum, Tom L&fcfimar,

in a desperate plea for United Electric to improve its coal
reserve position, .notes that "We had during the years examined
something over 200 coal fields.
only seven.

Of those, we have taken up

Some of the best were dropped, without going into.”

Uattimer further observes that "Practically all of our compe­
titors have a far better organization for prospecting than we."
The

memo ends with th© following —

again this is 1955:

"I

would like to discuss the entire problem at length with you
some place where we can have plenty of time to go over it
thoroughly, as I ara afraid we are not building up properly the
basis upon which our future lies."
Now. during his deposition, the company’s former
chief executive officer, who retired shortly after Freeman took
control, defended United’& reserve policy under his pre-merger
administration on the basis that the company had other uses
for its money and the company had lost half its business to

gas and oil.

That appears in the record at page 145.

Now, Mr. Lattimer*s prediction of some two years ago
unfortunately came true in spades, notwiths tanding the vigorous
but unsuccessful efforts of Freeman which, contrary to Mr.
Friedman's argument, are documented over and over again in
this record,

Freeman's and General Dynamics' attempts to re­

verse United Electric's liquidating position,

United Electric * a

reserve position was discussed time and again at board meetings,
commencing with control by Freeman.

That is in the record,

United Electric's Vice President for Operations
testified that he had an open book, an open checkbook to
acquire reserves.

The company’s former President at trial

testified that he put no restrictions on the company in
acquiring reserves as long as they were black,
So compelling was this evidence that even the govern­
ment stated at trial "that after 1959 UEC's management sought
to acquire economically recoverable reserves."

My distinguished

opponent t*ould try to walk away from that concession now, saying
wall that is talking not about the future.

But the fact is

that the question of future reserve prospects is one best
committed, as it was in this case, to expert testimony,
industry knowledge, and not lay speculation or, what we submit
is an incredible plea for judicial notice, contained in the
government's brief in chief,
Finally, on United Electric’s inability' to regain its

38
lost —
Q

It is an incredible plea for judicial notice?

MR. KEDLUND:
Q

Yes.

And what was it he asked to take judicial notice

of —
MR. HEDLUNB:

That United Electric will acquire addi­

tional reserares in the future.

That is what the plea for

judicial notice is, Your Honor.
Q

I see.

MR. HEBLUND:

Finally, on United Electric's inability

to retain its lost competitive position in the future —
Q

Mr. Hedlund, on this record isn’t there some in­

dications that estimates of future reserves were quite far of
the mark when they were made just relatively recently?
MR. HEBLUND:

To the contrary, Mr. Chief Justice, I

think the record is the other way.

While Mr. -Kolfoe did testify

that the company always —• that their mines ended up having more
coal than they had thought at the outset, the fact is that we
have the Mary Moors Mine of United Electric, that closed two
years earlier than anticipated.

We now have the Banner Mine of

United Electric that is closing this year, three years earlier
than anticipated.
Q

The point that I was driving at, I thought this

record indicated that earlier estimates
optimistic —

proved to be too

MR. HEDLOND:
Q

Oh, yes.

— that reserves ran out much sooner than they

thought.
MR, HEDLOND;

That, is correct.

Justice, I misunderstood your question.

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief
Yes, that is correct.

Finally, on United Electric’s inability to regain
its lost competitive position in the future, we need only
observe that this w&3 confirmed in the record by Paul Weir
Company, one of the world’s leading mining engineering consult­
ing firms, and one, I might add, who is frequently used by the
federal government itself, by the head of the Illinois
Geological Survey, by an experienced independent geologist
whose life work had been acquiring coal fields fox* producers,
and by other knowledgeable industry witnesses.
As Frank Nugent, President of United-Freeman, put it
in his deposition by the government — and I think this really
sums it up:

"Let me answer it this way, Mr. Cusack, and maybe

it will save some time.

The people who are in the business

knowledgeable, as I said before, such as Mr, Xelee, Mr. Mullins
and Herman Kelb, are fully familiar with the strip acreage
that, is available in this state, and there is not any neces­
sity for any conversation between me and people in the business
as to whether there are strip reserves available.
is not debatable.

The question

We know that they are not there, so there

just isn’t anything to discuss.

That goes down to d?xb

engineers who have just been in the business a couple of years.
There is not a utility man in the state, a knowledgeable utility
man in the state who does not know that the strip reserves are

not available,,

There is not a salesman selling shovels and

equipment who does not know that the reserves are not available.
They have a keen interest in it.

The Caterpillar Tractor

Company are knowledgeable in that area.
are not available.

They know the reserves

Their sales programs are directed else­

where because the reserves are not here.

This is not a question

that is debatable among coal people, it is an accepted fact
that reserves are not here."

That testimony appears at page 62

of the record.
Q

Well, I gather one of your arguments must be that

in terms of United's condition in 1959, anybody, no matter who
the acquirer was, could have acquired United without any damag­
ing? effect on competition because of its position in the market,
that it was just too worn out a company, to ineffective competi­
tively to bo a factor in a section 7 case.
HR, HEDItUWDi

That would be my position, Mr, Justice

White, but I don't believe I need go that far because in the
context of this case you have the lack, of competition between
Freeman and United Electric.
Q

Well, would you say ■— did Freeman get any cus­

tomers through United?

MR. HEDLUND:

Ho.

41
Q

Did they make some joint bids?

MR. HEDLimD:
Q

No.

Did Freeman help United carry cat some of. its

contracts?
MR. HEDLUNB:

There were four instances **- and I be­

lieve these are mentioned in our brief — where United Electric
was able to enter into long-term contracts.
1966 or so

This took place in

able to enter into long-term contracts because

at the tall end of the twenty-year period involved, Freeman
was willing to guarantee that there would be coal there for the
utility.

In. other words —
Q

Well, what did that do to other competitors?

MR. KEDLUND:
nothing.

To competitors of Freeman, it did

It has to be looked at, it seems to me, from the

ufcilitv *s standpoint.
Q

Well, what did it do to competition, to other

competitors, one or the other, who might want to get that
utility customer?
MR. HEDLUND:

It permitted United Electric to provide

more vigorous competition against the coal companies with whom
they ware competing.
Q

Because of the union with Freeman?

MR. HEDLUND:

That is correct.

Beyond United Electric'a terminal condition, whether
viewed in 1959 and 1.967 or at any other timef a second central

42
finding of the decision below on the basis of all the evidence
was that, contrary to the government8s allegations, United
Electric and Freeman would not and could not compete with each
other to any substantial degree.

This salient fact, one un­

questionably committed to the province of the trier of fact
and subsequently determined by Chief Judge Robson from all the
evidence is inescapable, as the court below recognised even
under the government's market definitions.
Prior to trial, the government admitted in its answers
to interrogatories that it could not name any customer of either
United Electric or Freeman who had been or would be deprived of
actual potential competition because of the combination.

Their

answers to interrogatories appear at page 305 and 318 of the
joint appendix.
At trial, however, the government relied upon charts
showing shipments to purported common customers of United
Electric and Freeman in its attempt to find actual and potential
competition between theta.

However, based on the evidence from

•the very customers involved on these charts, the testimony and
the testimony of the government's own economist

and the testi­

mony of defendant's executives, the government1s charts were
totally discredited and the information shown thereon was
demonstrated to be flat wrong.
Many of the shipments weren't, even to the same plant,
and others ware of non-competing products, albeit to the same

plant.

To illustrate, Freeman shipped Inland Steel metallurgies

coal for making steel, while United Electric shipped Inland
steam coal for power generation.

Others were unique situa­

tions shown at trial to be non-competitive.
ample.

Take TVA, for ex­

United Electric's shipments to TVA involved a situation

where adverse river conditions precluded it from making its
normal shipments.

TVA’s coal purchaser testified at trial that

United Electric was not a potential supplier of TVA.
government’s economist

The

agreed, the government’s own economist.

As hs put it — and this is at 1694 of the record — "The way
the thing occurred in the record, I would not say that that
particular shipment represented competition."

Executives from

other consumers listed on the government's charts similarly
denied that both United Electric and Freeman could have com­
peted for their business.
In view of the simplicity of the proposition involved,
the almost unlimited scope of pretrial discovery permitted the
government, the eleven-year period that the combination had
been in effect by the time of trial, and the fact that the
court had before it the testimony of purchasers of more than
one-half of the coal produced in the Midwest, there can
logically be, we submit, one reason why the government failed
in its attempt to shew that United Electric and Freeman were
substantial potential competitors, and that reason is simply
because they were not.

And this was because of the different

locations of the mines, the different modes and costs of trans­
portation available to each, and because of the varying quality
characteristics of their respective coals.
And, we repeat, those were the facts, whatever the
markets chosen, and specifically even if the market definition
issues in the litigation had been resolved the way the govern­
ment wanted them to be.
Another central finding below was that since 1959,
the year when Freeman obtained control of United Electric, a
fact, by the way, brought to the attention of the Antitrust
Division at the time, which took no action, the court found
that since 1959 the United Electric-Freeman combination had not
adversely affected competition, whether the markets used for
that analysis were those of the government or the defendants.
That finding was based upon an analysis made by the court of
the structure of the coal industry and its markets, upon the
testimony of industry representatives as well as experts, and
upon the government's own admissions.

This showed, first, as

1 have discussed, that United Electric and Freeman would not
and could not compete to any substantial degree.
Beyond that, the trial court specifically found that
the record was not only "devoid of any signs of anticompetitive
performance and behavior in the coal industry, but rather the
past performance of the industry suggests there has been in­
tense competition among coal producers«,“

In fact, the

government., in response to defendants' proposed findings below,.
was forced to concede that it ~~ and this is the government’s
own words — "it has never asserted during the twenty years
preceding .1967 that the coal industry was not competitive."
The government acknowledged, moreover, that tha mine mouth
price of coal in 1968 was less than at the beginning of the
post-war period, despite general inflation in wholesale prices,
and that there had been marked improvements in coal technology,
techniques and productivity.
The trial court specifically found "from all the
evidence presented at trial, it appears that coal producers
will bs under continuing pressure to reduce costs and keep
prices low if they are to continue to serve their last remain­
ing large market for steam coal.”

Among the factors which

made this clear were th© sophistication and market power of
coal buyers and the presence of a substantial number of viable
coal competitors
In addition, the court found particularly significant
the wealth of evidence dealing with the tremendous competitive
pressure placed on coal producers frcaa suppliers of alternative
fuels.

This pressure was expected to intensify in the future,

particularly in light of the ever increasing environmental
considerations.
Commonwealth Edison’s spokesman at trial summed up
the situation as follows, from page 1414 of the record:

"Well,

as far as Commonwealth Edison is concerned, we have sort of put
our eggs in the nuclear basket.

We believe that nuclear power

is the best way to provide baseload electric generation, and we
intend to move in this direction."
Indeed, a representative of the Atomic Energy Commis­
sion testified that in the long term the most economical way to
generate electricity would be a combination of nuclear and pump
storage facilities, together with gas turbine peaking units.
Moreover, even with respect to the government’s coal
production statistics, which we contend were improperly aggre­
gated and thus meaningless, and obscured the fact that United
Electric and Freeman were predominantly complimentary rather
than competitive companies.

It was shown that on the- govern­

ment’s statistics that excluding Peabody, the production shares
of the two, four and ten largest producers since 1939 remained
stable or declined.

This is shown at pages 1276 and 1277

of the appendix sub-exhibits.
The effect that Peabody * s increase in size has had on
the midwestern coal industry has, of course, been cured to the
government's satisfaction by virtue of the divestiture consent
decree it obtained against Peabody in 1967 and deconcentration
has bean further advanced by the entry of Humble oil into coal
production,

the establishment of the Midland operation

divested by Peabody and the continued decline of the UnitedFreeman position.

It should bo noted in this latter regard that the
evidence was that United Electric-Freeman combination accounted
for less of the midwest coal production in 1967 than it did in
1959»

In fact, as the court found below, the combination had

experienced more than a 10 percent decrease in its percentage
of such production since 1959.

The court anticipated that

this would continue to drop, as United Electric’s mines closed,
as their reserves played out.

That these predictions have be­

come true i3 a matter of which we submit this Court can tata
judicial notice by examining the post-trial publications of
the State of Illinois and the United States Bureau of Mines.
These show that United Electric7 s/Freeman’s combined coal
production for 1972 was almost four million tons less than the
14 million ton total in 1967, and that its share of midwest
production has dropped by more than a third.
The final factual find.big upon which 1 wish to focus
was the testimony of knowledgeable industry witnesses in this
case.

Notwithstanding a diligent government search before

trial for competitors or customers of the combination, whose
testimony would tend to prove the alleged adverse effect on
competition, the government was unable to find a single member
of the class for whose benefit this action was purportedly
brought to add any substance to its claims.
The defendants, however, did adduce evidence from a
broad cross-section of both producers and consumers to the

48
affect that the combination had not had and would not have an
adverse effect on competition.

This cam from large, medium-

size and small public utilities, a rural electric cooperative.,
a federal electric authority, a, retail coal dealer, and several
industrial concerns, as well as large and small coal producers.
And the significant thing here about this testimony of consumers
and producers alike is that it came from knowledgeable witnesses
who gave concrete reasons for their conclusions, as was re­
quired by this Court's admonition in Philadelphia National Bank.
The most dramatic example, X submit, of this took
place during the government’s lone attempt to establish that
these witnesses ware indifferent to and unsophisticated about
the competitive implications of mergers of coal producers.
This occurred during the cross-examination by the government
of Davis, President of Central Illinois Light Company,

This

elicited the fact that Hr. Davis had in the past taken the
initiative in complaining to the Antitrust Division when his
evaluation led him to conclude that another merger between
coal producers did pose a threat to competition.
The question was asked of Mr. Davis, "Would you be
concerned, Mr. Davis, as President of CILCO, if UEC and Freeman
merge with Truax-Traer?"
"As your Department undoubtedly knows/1 Mr. Davis
testified, "we made a complaint several years ago about the
merger of two coal companies in our area, and you have reached

a satisfactory settlement, I take it, with those two companies,

so anything that, we feel reduces the amount of competition in
our area, we are certainly not that bashful about making a
complaint.

If Truax-Traar were to merge with, say, Peabody in

our area, we'd make another complaint."
"Well, why would that bother you, Mr. Davis," the
government asked.
Mr. Davis said, nXt's a reduction of competition in
our area.
The government’s first response to these determina­
tions

Would you have the page in the transcript where

MR. HEDLtJNO:

I3m sorry, Mr. Chief Justice, yes, that

is page 1222-23 in the —

Q

Well, it is page 45 of your brief?

MR. HSDLUND:

That is correct.

The government's first response to these determina­
tions is that Judge Robson somehow did not make the proper
structural analysis dictated by the cases.
the trouble with -that argument is two-fold.

If seems to me that
First of all, if

does not avoid the hard reality of the specific finding by the
trial court that the combination would not have an adverse
effect on competition even if the government’s product and
geographic market definitions were accepted in full.

50
The second trouble is that the trial court did in fact
make the structural analysis which the government claims is
missing, and did so in conformity with the cases.

Almost one-

third of the opinion below is devoted to such considerations
as the rankings of the defendants in both coal production and
coal reserves, the background of the coal industry, the changes
in the demand for coal, the emergence of the utilities as the
principal market for coal, the changes that have taken place
in production techniques

,

the way in which coal producers

competed for their principal market utilities, and indeed one
section of the opinion is even titled "Changes in the Structure
of the Coal Industry."
Moreover, with the full point of Judge Robson*s
opinion, he declares that coal is the subject of the litigation,
Now, what the government really complains about, we submit, is
that the court refused to decide the case solely on the numbers
the government had put up on their charts.

Now. even if these

numbers had been something more than improperly aggregated coal
production statistics, which they ware decidedly not, it seems
to us that writing numbers on the blackboard is not enough in
the present case, where the issue is not whether the govern­
ment has not made out a prima facia case, but whether on the
basis of all the evidence, after a full trial, a likely adverse
effect on competition has been shown,
Even where the statistical data in evidence is not

misleading,, this Court has stressed in Brown Shoe that its
importance should not obscure, that only a further examination
of the particular market, its structure, history, probable
future can provide the appropriate setting for judging the
probable anticompetitive effect of the merger.
Square to the point here is the testimony at trial of
the government's own economist, James Folsom.

Now, during the

litigation, it came to our attention that while the Antitrust
Division was trying to split up United Electric and Freeman,
they were acting affirmatively at the same time to approve a
merger of two other Illinois coal producers that would have
been structurally indistinguishable from United Electric-Freeman
with the resulting combination in either situation constituting
the second largest coal producer in Illinois and in the
Midwest.
Now, at trial I submitted to Mr. Folsom a hypothetical
based solely upon the structural numbers of the merger which
the government said it would approve.

I asked him to assume

that the two companies were viable, and I asked him whether he
would conclude on the basis of those facts that the merger
posed a threat to competition.

Mr. Folsom was not prepared to

rest an appraisal on the numbers alone.

As ha put it, "I

would still want more information, I would still want to look
further.51
So in this case, if the government Vs numbers did

52
anything at all, and we say they didn't in view of, among
other things, their improper aggregation, the fact that pro™
auction data rather than reserve data was used, and the fact
that even then they included non-comepting forms of coal, they
created at the most a presumption that was rebutted and over­
come by the facts which defendants placed in evidence,
With Commonwealth Edison testifying that they had put
their eggs in the nuclear basket, with the documented loss of
coal*s position in other markets, with the undisputed fact that
a coal producer competes for long-term contracts, not with pro­
duction statistics, but with verifiable, uncommitted coal re­
serves, and with the government*s own economist challenging the
use of the Eastern Interior Coal Province Sales Area, as a
market, and failing to support the proposition that Illinois
was a market, we submit that the trial court was undoubtedly
correct in its finding at page 65a, that the only evidence
produced by the government to support their claim of a. substan­
tial lessening of competition -was statistics which failed to
reflect the very real competition coal faces from other forms
of energy, and which groups together coal producers into
economically unrealistic markets while ignoring ‘the key factor
in a coal producer’s market strength, coal reserves.
The government’s remaining and we submit late arriv­
ing argument also fails.

If there be any significance, and wa

say there is none, to the fact that Judge Robson entered no

specific findings with respect to United Electric's prospects
of 1959, it is because government trial counsel not only failed
to request such findings but asked the trial court not to make

them.
However, defendants did propose findings on evidence
that they had put in the record concerning United Electric's
debilitated condition in 1959, the reasons why that unhappy
circumstance had come about, and the merger efforts of United
before 1959 to try to solve the problem,.
In the fact of a lack of evidence to the contrary,
however, all the government could claim at trial was that those
findings were irrelevant.
If I may make a few more specific comments to certain
of the things that Mr. Friedman touched on as far as the state
of the record:

I would suggest a careful look at the govern­

ment's exhibit on mergers since 1959.

That is page 106, I

believe.
Careful analysis of that will show that almost all of
the mergers since 1959 have involved the Peabody Coal Company,
as I have already referred to, and that another rather largelooking one on the record was in fact an acquisition of an ex­
isting company in the Midwest from a company outside the
Midwest.
With respect to Mr. Justice Douglas’ observation
about a fuel monopoly

Q

Question

MR. HEDLUND:

Question — there is a .reference or at

least an aspect of that in Judge Robson{s opinion, in which ha
does note that 25 percent of the production of coal in the
Midwest has been produced by oil companies.
General Dynamics, of course, has no other fuel inter­
ests or utility interests, for that matter, other than these
two coal companies.
As to whether Ayrshire's attempt at deep mining proves
that anybody can go into deep mining, I would respectfully re­
fer the Court to the testimony of Ayrshire’s witness at trial
on that subject and we submit that it is four-square against
the government.
As fax as General Dynamics' reserve position, coal
reserve position in the Midwest or elsewhere in the country,
that has not changed except as a result of small increments
of the two coal companies involved since 1959.,
Q

Mr. Hedlund, would you comment on the nature of

the competition or however you would describe it between these
two companies with respect to Commonwealth Edison?
MR. HEDLUND;

Yes, Mr. Justice Powell.

The competi­

tion for Commonwealth Edison has to be viewed, it seems to us,
in three lights.

The first of which is that Commonwealth

Edison is a unique coal purchaser in the Midwest.

It purchases

one-third of ail the production in the State of Illinois, for

55

for example,

Unlike any other coal purchaser revealed by

either the government or ourselves, it must buy coal from a
variety of producing districts.

We believe that the real

competition then for Edison’s coal purchasers is among the
producers in a district and not between different districts.
Secondly, in view of Edison’s substantial size, their
real leading commitment to nuclear energy, the sophistication
and care with which that company makes every fuel decision, we
do not think that this combination could have any effect on
Commonwealth Edison as indeed was confirmed by their witness
at trial.
A dimension of this, I think, Mr. Justice Powell, is
the government's reguest or haste to point out, I should say,
at trial 'that Commonwealth Edison does not take unfair ad­
vantage of coal producers.
Q

Does the record show how many suppliers of coal

are used by Commonwealth Edison?
MR. HSDLUHD:

Yes, Your Honor.

Those are in defend­

ant's Exhibit 49 — I'm sorry, not 49, Defendant’s Exhibit 55
-— well, that discloses only the producing districts.

The

actual names of the customers I do not think is shown, but I
could be wrong.
To conclude, we submit that the decision below com­
ports completely with settled principles of merger law and
policy and signals no softening of or retreat from established

barriers to anticompetitive mergers.

The findings below, we

submit, were not clearly erronecnts? and we respectfully urge
that the judgment. be affirmed.
If there are no further questions, 1 would conclude
my argument.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Hedlund.

Mr. Friedman, you have a few minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ. ,
OH BEHALF OF TKE APPELLANT
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and. may it please

the Court:
The government doesn’t see this as basically a facfcua
case.

Our opponents have attempted to present tills as a case

in which th© District Court fully considered all the factual
issues, resolved them against the government, and therefore, as
they see it, that is the end of it.,
Ife think th© basic issue in this case is whether the
traditional standards that this Court has applied in passing
upon the validity of mergers under section 7, an analysis of
the structure of the industry, where the primary emphasis is
on increases in concentration in the concentrated market, where
Congress has made the judgment that increases in concentration
are a distressing trend in the American economy that should bs
halted in their insipiency.
Whether th® principles this Court has announced in

those casas are somehow not applicable to this industry be­
cause of fcha critical aspect of the reserves in this industry
and because of the weak position United Electric was developing
in its reserves.

And we think the whole question of whether

United Electric continued as a viable entity in this industry
has to depend upon whether they have succeeded in establishing
this failing company or failing resources defense.

We think

you can’t just say because it looked as though United Electric
in 1959 would have some trouble surviving therefore you
jettison all the analysis that this Court has made in the past
on this issue, and merely say it is therefore a factual ques­
tion that >7e let the District Court decide whether — and. the
District Court, by the way, did not make these decisions as of
1959, the time of the merger, it made them as of the time of
trial.

It said presently, whether we let the District Court

say that nevertheless this merger is to be approved because
on the basis of the record it concluded that in 1972 that
United Electric was unlikely at that point to consider as a
viable entity and that divestiture would be an appropriate
thing.
The suggestion has been made here that, wall, really,
the coal industry is terribly competitive, everyone is compet­
ing for business, people were fighting to get business — that
la not the standard for determining the validity of a merger
under section 7.

What Congress wa3 concerned with was changes

58
in the structure of the industry,, not whether people ware
vigorously competing.
1 dare say there are few industries X think more com­
petitive. more competitive than the retail grocery industry.
And I have no doubt that the industry, the retail grocery in­
dustry in Los Angeles, where this Court held the merger of
Von’s and Shopping Bag illegal, was at least as competitive as
the coal industry involved in Illinois, if anything it was
probably more competitive, but that didn’t change the Court’s
decision.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you, gentleman.

Thank you, Mr. Friedman.

The case is submitted.

{Whereupon, at 12:00 o’clock noon, the case was
submitted.3
