ORAL ARGUMENT OF SANFORD JAY ROSEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. ROSENv

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courtj
This appeal brings before the Court a challenge to a
provision of the Indiana election law that conditions political
party access; to the ballot on the making of a disclaimer that
the party does not advocate overthrow of government by force or
violence.
Plaintiffs tendered signatures on petitions for in­
clusion on the ballot on August 31, 1972.

The defendants, the

Election Board of Indiana, rejected the petitions the same day,
relying on the provision of Indiana law and an opinion rendered
on August 20th by the Indiana Attorney General*

The statute

specifically provides that the affidavit must state the party
does not advocate the overthrew of local, state or national
government by force or violence, and that it ia not affiliated
with' and does not cooperate with nor has any relation with any
government — any foreign government ot political party or
group of individuals cf any foreign government.

4
The opinion of the Attorney General took the statute
a step

or

so further, stating as to the particular appellants,

the party appellants, the Communist Party of Indiana, that "The
Communist Party would not ha eligible to appear on the Indiana
ballot even if its officers should sign an affidavit because
that would be an obvious perjury -in view of the Communist
Party's stated purposes#- end those Indiana officials who would
be responsible for placing th© Communist Party on the ballot
could be subject to federal criminal prosecution as well under
the Smith Act and th© Communist Control Act, somewhat in
terrorem.
The plaintiffs in this action# the Communist Party of
Indiana, candidates for the presidency and vies presidency under
that banner, candidates for electors of the president and the
✓

vice president under that banner, a voter and the class of
voters she would represent sued for injunctive declaratory
relief against the enforcement of this Indiana statute.

The

amended complaint, which is the basic document before the Court,
was filed on September 8, 1972»

h

hearing was held on September 28, 3.972, and a de­

cision was conducted on the same day*

The three-judge District

Court in Indiana ruled that the-affiliation clause of the
statute, a statute prohibiting affiliation with a foreign
government or segment thereof, was unconstitutional on its face.
It, on the other hand, specifically validated the advocacy

5
claud®.

The Communist Party? as a consequence of this action,

and a consequence of the fact that it had very little limited
tints in which to get on the ballot or to take steps to gat on
the ballot for the 1972 election, submitted & qualified
affidavit pursuant to the order of the court,

In that affidavit

the party stated by its officers that it did not engage in the
unlawful advocacy or the proscribed advocacy.
It went on to state, concerned obviously with the
opinion of the Attorney General about perjury sanctions? that
the term "advocate'1 used herein has- the meaning given by the
Supreme Court of the United States in Vates,

"The advocacy in

teaching of concrete action for the forcible overthrow of
government and not of principles divorced from action."
This affidavit was tendered and rejected by the
Election Board on September 29 by a vote of two-to-one.

There­

after, the plaintiffs went back to the District Court, requested
an order enforcing the previous mandate of the court, that
order was denied on October 4th.

h motion to amend subsequent!■Y

was made-, was denied on October 31st, and. various attempts by
the appellants here end the appellees on the other side were
also rejected in an emergency posture by this Court.

Both

sides then took appeals from the two different decisions of the
fch re. a - j udge c ourt.
On March 19, 1973, this Court summarily affirmed the
decision of the three-judge district court to the extent that

6
that court had invalidated the affiliation clause of the
Indiana statute.

At the same time, the instant case, the appeal

by the Coiarauhist Party, its candidates and voters, the court
entered an order stating that the question of jurisdiction has
been postponed to the hearing of the case on the merits.
How, what appellants take to be the question of juris­
diction in this case at this point, after all the emergency
appeals had been rendered, and after the various actions have
been taken in the District Court, is th® question of the
timeliness of the appeal.

.And I would like to rest so far as

that question is concerned on the brief, we brief that exten­
sively, possibly too extensively, but since the question was
.reserved and. this mia the question that appeared to us to b©
the jurisdictional question, we brief that from page 13 to 15
in the appellants' brief, and unless the Court desires specific
argutent on that issue, 1 would rest on the brief and turn to
the merits„
Plaintiffs request this Court to revere© and remand to
the District Court with instructions to void the advocacy pro­
vision of the Indiana statute,

-We have a number of arguments

which X think we have very extensively briefed, but it might be
helpful to go over them in order.
Oar first point concerns the nature of voting, of
standing for public office, and of political parties.
clearly fundamental interests.

These arc

Innumerable decisions of this

7
Court have stated that the right to vote is the fountainhead
of democratic rights la our society.

In the Bullock v. Carter

decision, the Court indicated that the rights of candidacy are
so bound up with the right to vote that they are basically in­
separable.,

And of course in Williams v. Rhodes, in other

decisions, the Court has indicated its extreme sensitivity to
the need of candidates and voters to bo affiliated with
political parties that are able to place on the ballot of a
state or of a national election candidates ’who are sponsored
and clearly stated to be sponsored by given political parties.
To this extent, then, this case involvas what the
coart has characterised as fundamental interests, and ifc
renders this case, this appeal different from the cases in
which the Court has evaluated oaths in other contexts.

This

is different from an employment oath nontext, it is different
from a barred mission context.

In neither of those other con­

texts, you have the interests being withheld as a result of
the oath, achieve the kind of fundamental internets that this
Court has defined voting and candidacy in political association,
The interest itself» the vote, the candidacy, in those cases
you have had a situation in which an Interest, admittedly a
valuable interest, has been conditioned upon the giving of an
oath or an affidavit, and evaluating the oath or affidavit,
the Court has been looking, however, so far as the constitu­
tional dimension is concerned, only at the oath or the affidavit

8
itself.
Eero you have to look at both.

Both have First

amendment dimensions, the vote, the candidacy and all, and also
the affidavit involves a First Amendment dimension.
Now, we submit 'that this context act of the primacy
of voting, that the state has an enormous burden of persuasion
of the. necessity for any limitation upon voting or candidacy,
particularly a limitation that, may encroach itself upon First
Amendment rights by inquiring Into political motivation or
ideology of a candidate or a party.

The state has no such

legitimate nor even — well, certainly compelling interests
in so conditioning voting and candidacy.
'She state at one point or another has spoken of fraud
and spurious candidacies.

Well, it is a little 3ate in the day

for anybody to fca suggesting that the efforts of the Communist
Party of Indiana or of the United States

to place candidates

before the electorate are fraudulent or spurious.
political party.

It is a

It has been a political party in thin country

for innumerable years, and it has fielded candidates for high
■ ;.

i

i.

office throughout most of the years that it has been a party
in this country.
Subversion, the state points to,

or the avoidance of

subversion as-being a legitimate and compelling interest —
indeed, that is a legitimate interest.

Obviously, the state

has an interest in avoiding its subversion.

So does the

national gm^ernraenfc., Whether it is & compelling interest in
this context is much more open to doubt , but we think that
actually it isn’t open to doubt, it is not of compelling in­
terest.

The state is asking an oath three steps away from

office-taking itself*
©secute the oath.

To get. on the ballot, you have to

To get to the point where you can subvert

the government from within, if that is the state's interest —
and I can't conceive of another interest that the state might
have and categorise as legitimate —* to get to the point of
subverting the government, you have got to win the election,
and then the government,'by the Constitution, article Ti and
Article XI, can certainly give the support oath and screen out
people who cannot take the support oath before office-taking

occurs *
So this oath is placed three stops before office-

taking,

Xt is quite an enormous fence that the state is placing

around its interests in avoiding subversion.

What do you understand the meaning of the phrase

"compelling interest" to 3ba?
B5E* R0S8H;

X understand it to mean that the state

has to coma forward with an interest that — X don't want to
us©

the

term "out-balances#M but —

Q

well —

MSL ROSffcs:

Well, I think the Court's analysis in

the Robal case of how legislation is to be evaluated in terms

10
of compelling interest Is perhaps the most apt.

As X recall#

it was la a footnote, in the Kobo I caso, that the Court diecussed the fact that it wasn't talking about balancing as such,
it recognised on the on® hand, that freedom of speech is an im­
portent interest to our society and. our government; on the
other hand, avoidance of subversion and sabotage is an important
interest as well,

When these two come at one another# seem to

be In conflict# then the Court must fall back to a eonvawhat
different analysis and not try to balance one against the other
necessarilyr but to try to evaluate whether the state has or
the government has oc-me alternative ways of securing the
legitimate intemstw which is compelling# and in that case# as
you recall# Justice Stewart# the Court ruled that the federal
government didirt demonstrate it lacked alternative ways.

And

In this oase- # too ■**’
Q
something else*

Well# the availability of alternative means
X didn't mean that my question was an easy one#

because 1 was really asking for information and for help.

What

do you think the phrase "compelling intereat" means constitu­
tionally?
HR. RDSEUs

All right.

Constitutionally# X think it

first means that a burden of proof is shifted# a burden of
constitutional proof? whereas# initially# on© who comes in to
challenge a state law has the burden of demonstrating that the
state lav? is bad wholly on his or her shoulders.

When you

11
establish a fundejnsmfc&l interest or if you are dealing with the
equal protection clausa, of course, the suspect classification.
Then the burden of proof shifts.

First the burden of going

forward, if you want to talk in evidentiary terms, shifts to
the government to come up with sortie legitimate reasons, scree
.reasons that go beyond more rationality, which would be the
ordinary standard to be applied in the equal protection or the

due process area.,
Mow, having coming up with these legitimate reasons.
when the Court, states that these reasons not only are to She
legitimate but also must be compelling, it seams to me the
Court is either talking shout a balancing test, which some
moisbars of the Court don't view with favor, or it is talking
about the least restrictive alternative teat.

And in either

event, it still connotes or pertains 1 think to a burden of

Q

"fou would think then —

HR. RQ$Mt

It new has become the burden of proof

question rather that*, the burden of going forward.
0

bo you think the phrase or the concept or the

notion of whatever that phrase may mean or reflect compelling
interest has any relevance at all in any area outside the area
of.the equal protection clause?
MR. &CSEKt

Yes, 1 think so.

1 think Robe1 indicates

that it has some relevance outside of that area.

1 knew that it

12
first originated in the equal, protection clause, but there eesm»
to m in later decisions of the Court to be something of &
spillover into the First Amendment area, because of the
paralle'lifcy in the two teats.
Q

Of «ourse# the .state — this is semantics, but

it seems to mo a little more than that and a little more funda­
mental than that —* if a state la# violates the First and
Fourteenth Amendments clearly» then a state can’t justify that

violation by showing its compelling interests, can it?
NR.. ROSBSI::

Because the lav/ is simply unconstitutional.

MR, ROSEN:

That’s right,

Regardless of how compelling

the state interest

might be.

Q

Correct.

Precisely,

That 'is what 1 don’t understand.

MR. ROSEN:.

And 1 wouldn’t want to try to meet the

hypetheticals at this point that the state might attempt to
articulate.

But 7 agree with you, Mr. Justice Stewart, that If

it is an invasion oi: the First Amendment, the state is justified «

0

That Is the sM of it, isn’t It?

MR. ROSEN.

That should ba the end of it»

However,

once you move through the opinions of this Court? we are caught
up with sometimes analysis that talks about compelling interest
and sometimes analysis that talks about least restrictive alter­
native .

I think in large part, on the basis of a legitimate

desire on the pert of the Court to avoid facing the pure First
Amendment question

unless it has to? so the Court presumably

would docide the cane on over breadth and vagueness grounds.
0

Wall, those are First Amendment concepts.

But

you do stick to your answer that this compelling interest
phrase and whatever concepts or ideas it may represent has
applicability beyond the area of the equal protection clausa?
MR. ROSEN;

Well, no, 1 would say that that is &

©econdary argument, that wo would agree with your initial argu­
ment, that if this is an invasion of the First Amendment, an
over breadth, say, resides in the statute —

1 wasn’t arguing»

MR. ROSEN:

1 am asking a question.

Excuse me, your question — that would

If the Court is compelled then by its own

decisions or by its own analysis of the issues to look beyond
that into something like a compelling state interest or compel­
ling governmental interest notion, or a least restrictive
alternative notion, than we would suggest the state cannot
meet the burden of proof, of constitutional proof that we lodged

14
on its shoulders,

Q

Mr, Rosen, tills colloquy prompts «s© to ask, do

1 can' t put ray fingers on them,

taking up from Justice Stewart's question — is that there is

The Court certainly had to media --

First, how

Well, first, in the

very pragmatic way, it interferes because the Communist Party
ms precluded from the ballot.

It attempted to articulate an

advocacy affidavit which was consistent with decisions of this
Court, namely the Yates case, which was then rejected by the
defendants and appellees.

It do®# not believe that it should.

It

believes that it is protected in its right not to have to make
that kind of a statement in order to gain access to the ballot,

The oath that it does not

without any further qualifications, goes well beyond all of
the oath© that this Court has heretofore validated in any other

MR. ROSEN;

it is impossible to answer, Your Honor.

X wouldn't want to have to answer that personally in some cirstsmatandos, the point being that it is too abstract and openended a question.

All right.

Rut we do have certain 'other

positions, and that is that so far as candidacy in federal
elections is concerned, so far as that kind of candidacy is
concerned, the state is limited to no more than the constitu­

The matter -of the jurisdictional question which the

of the case *
.* • *

■.*

The State of Indiana, as represented by its Indiana
General Assembly and upheld by the Indiana Supreme Court, decided
long ago that in conformance with the cases of this Court that
the state has a right of self-preservation and that in balancing
the rights of all of the amendments of the Constitution, that
this Court has never held that the First Amendment rights are
absolute or that any rights are absolute, that there has to be
a balancing of the rights.

And the history of Indiana would

chow that we have had difficulties and, as the reading cf our
oath would imply, our oath as it has bean trimmed down by the
federal court below and which we defend, is to the effect that

status of the political parties must have their officers sign
this oath and submit it

by force or violence.,

&nd besides the history of the thing

which would show you some background on Indiana’s consideration
here? we have the feeling, as expressed so well by Kr. Chief
Justice Burger in the Cole v. Richardson case, that since
there is no constitutionally protected right to overthrow a
government by fore®, violence or illegal or unconstitutional
means, no constitutional right is infringed by an oath to abide
by the constitutional system in the future.

Our feeling is

that once you pnss the threshold of moving' from the college or
the coffee klatch or the parlor discussion into the status of
an official political party where you are recognised by the
state and start out with an equal opportunity, no matter what
the odds are, for taking over the rains of government, that the
state has ths right to ask you to abide by the rules once you
cross that threshold.

To move from potential to kinetic in

terms of the battle for political power,
And the Indiana law in clear.

It la continuing.

It

applies to all political parties, reasonable men can under­
stand it, there are no criminal penalties attached.

MX official opinions ia Indiana are merely advisory.

The Attorney General of Indiana has no general criminal powers.
All he was doing in that opinion is stating a fact upon read­
ing tlie Communist platform as circulated in Indiana and reading
the fact that they failed to take the oath, he was stating the
fact that if they did t©k® the oath, as they state in'here that
they might not be tilling the truth or might be using semantics

Q

Mr. Sendak, what is the state's position, as you

represent it here, vd.th respect to whether the Indiana Election
Cosaraissionera could refuse a place on the ballot to a party that
signed the oath as upheld by the District Court just because
the Election Commisisionerk felt that perhaps the oath was not
truthful?

The state’s position has been changed by

the District Court below in cur failure to get the jurisdiction

is that, the State Election
requirement.

But the basic law in Indiana

Board must strictly comply with that

That is, if a group presents a petition with the

■requisite nvtiaber of signed registered voters and presents the
affidavit, the State Election Board must receive it.

The law

also states that the State‘Election Board shall then make an
Investigation as to the accuracy of th© petitions, which it had
no opportunity to do here because of the time element, and as
to the veracity of the affidavit.

It provide® no criminal

penalties, however, and the only action it can take at that
point, if it finds either th© affidavit is wrong, as if did in
another case and in this case, or that the petitions are insuf­
ficient, it

just rejects the party's position on the ballot.

In 1968, the same issue cam up before th© Indiana
Supreme Court, the Socialist hobor Party v. State Election

26
Board.

They submitted the required masher of petition aigna-

turea, but their Affidavit was incorrect, it didn’t strictly.,
follow the law, so they were thrown off the '.ballot and the
Indians Supreme Court ’said that the State Election Board has a.
duty of
strict compliance with the law.

comply strictly, would have to put them on the ballot.

We had a case

upon which \m relied for the state's construction, for example,

of the word "advocacy#* and that was the Butash case in 1937,

MR, SSHDSK:
state’s interests.

Ii I may, I would like to proceed to the

The Bullock case, to which counsel for

appellants referred, makes the statement that th© state has an

28
interest if not a duty to pre-teat the integrity of its political
pro-ceases from frivolous or fraudulent aandidaciea.

This Court

has uphold a loyalty oath.in Pennsylvania for political candi­
dates in Lis&ar in 19? X, /where the loyalty oath was much more
loosely worded.

Xt read something to the effect -that the po­

tential candidate was not a subversive parson, whatever that
would bo.

And thmi again in the Gerenda c&sa in 1951, where

it upheld the oath in Maryland for political candidates, where
they stated they were not engaged in one way or another in
activities c£ this nature.

She Healey case in 1971, involving

the SD8, this Court made & statement, a holding, 7. believef
that recognition may be denied to any group which reserves the
right to violate any valid rule with which.it disagrees, and
that is our connection here, that by their do-it-yourself oath
or custmsd oath, appellante presented to the federal court
below, which rejected it by the way, -that they are attempting
to reserve the right to engage in this action and therefore
their oath is not valid, they are performing at all with a

mental reservation.
As to the question that the oaths mat exactly parrot
the oath that the President of the United, states takes, this
Court has many tines held that that la not -so,

Xn the Olsen

case in 1971, I beli.we it was, or 1970, this Court held
specifically — those are almost the exact word* — that the
oaths administered do not have to parrot the oath of the

President.

SEKDAK;

Yes.

But X thought perhaps Mr. Justice

white meant if the State Legislature of Indiana were to pass
such an oath, it would fee fine.
0

Right,

MR* SEHDAK:

It would accomplish the same thing.

In

Cole v. Richardson, the words 5,to oppose the overthrow" in my
opinion are not different from "not to advocate the overthrow."
They are substantially the same.

And cur thinking docs one

have the right to advocate that which he has a constitutional
duty to oppose.
In th® very Fourteenth Amendment, 1 would like to
refer to section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which is very
rarely discussed, where a discussion of the oath really takes
place, where it. says, using the negative to begin with, "No
parson shall be an flector or official, uphold any public

office" — 1 put the word “public" in there — "any officewho, having previously token sm oath to support the Constitution
of the United state», shall have engaged in insurrection or
rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to the
enemies thereof."

There must have been this sente discussion at

that tina, and for the obvious reasons.

And this would go back

to the background as to why Indiana perhaps adopted this oath
when it did and in view of the background.
2*h© case of Ex Parta Milligan, with which this Court

is well acquainted, besides the ruling on habeas corpus, the
factual background wa© that Mr. Millgan was one of those who
engaged with southern sympathizers in overthrowing several
local units of government, and whan General Morgan’s raiders
and ether» cam in, they actually took over for a period of
days local units of government.

We had the same thing in

Indiana;'s background in a sense during the 1920’s and 1930*s

with the rise of the Klu Kluss Kl&n, and w® also had during
the 1930’s and up to world War IX vary radical areas as be­
tween the German-Amrican Etendfc and the Communiat Party in
Indiana, and these things* caused the Legislature of Indiana
curing the height of the war to pass this law and to apply it

to- all political parties.

That is the legislative background

on that law.
As to counsel for appellants’ reference to
Brandonburgf Yates, Uoto and those cases, they are. all. criminal

32

eases mid have a much more strict standard of proof than a civil
matter such as this.

If we had to set up our standards;, we

would say that in Indiana, following the construction of the
Indiana Supreme Court, that the advocacy has-to he linked to
f

,

notion, and that you cannot reserve the right, to take violent
action if you are going to cross the threshold and become
officially recognised as a political party.
One other thing, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to
refer to is the very platform of the Communist Party itself,
which was copyrighted in May of 1970, Library of Congress No.
79127023, and circulated throughout the country, including
Indiana, and as 1 mentioned earlier, a voter in the state of
Indiana who is properly registered could vote in 1972 by an
examination of his platform for everything for which the
o.mvftunist Party stood except one, ha couldn’t vote in Indiana
for those candidates? who advocato — who will refuse to say
V

>

they don’t advocate the overthrow of the government by force or
violence.

But the Communist Party goes on to say, if I say

quote vary briefly in point, that "they are campaigning for
their right.*? free from all social and legal restrictions,” page
61; page 64, “Wa Communists are not pacifists», we view violence
from the glass standpoint, accordingly we view nonviolence as
a tactic of struggle in some instances, but wo do not adhere to
it as a principle or a philosophy," and. then on page 93,
speaking about whether or not there would have to be \.a bloody

33
ordeal or whether they could snsuroe power through the electoral
process without it, it says, "of course, we roust be prepared to
Meet any eventuality, while we seek a peaceful path as prefer­
able to a violent one, this choice may prove to be blocked by
monopolist reaction, socialist must be sought therefore by
whatever msans and circumstances may impose," &n& then, finally,
and the words that they italicise are the words 1 will emphasise,
"The very development of present-day struggles -lays the basis
for making clear now the need to change the system and for
building now the movement for socialism in the United States,
he who does not work for these goals now will never be prepared
for revolutionary change.”

So they are advocating action now

which may prompt its hairs to take some unlawful action as
noted in Yates, page 322, quoting Dennis.
I mentioned the oases interpreting our law in
Indiana.

Indiana law is fair, .it does not violate anyone's

rights with respect to getting on the ballot if they will make
a coneci@nt.iou3 oath and effort and not reserve the right to
overthrow the government by fores or violence.

If it were, it would fea stale on the basis of many de­

On overfcre&dfch, in addition to the cases already
cited to the Court, so far as the Indiana Suprema Court's in­
terpretation of this or similar statutes is concerned» there
ie one-case that hadn't been cited so far, and that is State
v. Levitt, 203 Northeast 2d 821? .1965, in which the Indiana
Supreme Court impliedly upheld the constitutionality of a
broad sedition statute.
Further, so far as the Attorney General’s power to
interpret and enforce law absent a definitive determination of
the courts, w© agree thera is no literal power ia Indiana law
for him to bind officials? however, he is certainly authorised
.by statists to issue advisory opinions.

You do have -- X don’t want — 2 hope that the argu~
se^nt wouldn’t focus entirely on this point because we think
that we have sera very powerful other points than the overbreadth; point,

we do think that Article XI, to the extent that

.this is a case involving federal offices, is absolutely pre­
clusive on the states, that the states really have no power
whatsoever to impose any kind of a condition on candidacy for
president or ©lectors to the office of president, that the

44
oath of office realty precludes everythin# that otherwise# put­
ting any other condition on it, is an added condition of office
<

which this Court said can't be done, at least in the legisla­
tive context, for example, in the Cowell v. MCCorroaek ease.
So X wouldn't want my argument to and on this note that we are
relying entirely and exclusively on the overbreadth point,

We

think; we have ether arguments as well.

That is a fair statement but, I really am

■not quite understanding the questioner how it is being formalated r~~
Q

Well, Justice Stewart inquired whether anyone

bad suggested abstersion in the case -~
MR. RDSJEN:
Q

All right.

— tli© District Court abstaining to get a binding

construction of the statute from the Indiana Supreme Court.
my recollection is that tills was all pretty much a day-to-day

And

proceeding.
MR. ROSEN.;

Xn&aed it was very xmah & day-to-day pro­

ceeding with the party being put to fairly substantial dead­
lines which it undertook to me —
Q

Well, on the boardr too.

MR. ROSE?'?;:

On the board as wo.ll»

But the Attorney

General’s opinion, for example, on the party's ineligibility
even if it were to file an affidavit, and there is ©tach an
opinion by the Attorney General that preceded the District
Court decision? was dated August 28th? and the party tendered
its petitions on fchcs 31st and the asasaded complaint was filed
a week later? the hearing was three.weeks lator? the split
decision cam© down and then these emergency proceedings took
place? yes.

So for that reason, among others, 1 think no

abstension was suggested,

X don't think abstention.would have

been appropriate under Baggett v. Bullitt and other decisions
of this Court*
Q

of course? that situation is normal in election

cases.

MR. RCiSSi?:
bo.

It seems to be, Your Honor.

It seams to

We really do try to ©tag© our cases in s more orderly

f&ssfciess in the election context? but the deadlines do bar us.

Thank you

Attorney Genere1
