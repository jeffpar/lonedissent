MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 72-1176, North Dakota State Board of Pharmacy v.
Snyder’s Drug Stores, Inc.
Mr. Lucas, you may proceed v/henever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. WILLIAM LUCAS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LUCAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I am William Lucas, representing the petitioner in
this action.
In North Dakota, we have a statute which provides
that if a corporation applies for a pharmacy permit, that a
majority of the stock in that corporation must be owned by
a registered pharmacist in good standing, actively and regu­
larly employed in and responsible for the actual management,
operation and supervision of that pharmacy.

Now, the respon­

dent in this action applied for a pharmacy permit, and in their
application they disclosed that all of the stock in their cor­
poration was owned by Red Owl Stores, which is a large super­
market chain in the midwest, and that it was not known if any
of the shareholders of Red Owl were registered pharmacist.
The State Board of Pharmacy in North Dakota then de­
nied this application, based upon the reason that they did
not comply with the ownership law that I have mentioned.

4
‘The respondent then appealed to the District Court,
and raised various Constitutional questions — mainly, the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the equal protectio,
clause, and various Constitutional issues in the North Dakota
Constitution.

And, on a motion for summary judgement, District

Court relied on the Liggett v. Baldridge decision of this case,
and declared that this statute was a violation of the due pro­
cess clause, and also a violation of the equal protection claus<
and unconstitutional.
The petitioner then appealed to the North Dakota
Supreme Court, and the North Dakota Supreme Court basically
relied entirely on the Liggett v. Baldridge decision of this
Court in 1928, and stated, "Being bound by the decision in
Liggett v. Baldridge, and seeing insufficient reason to dis­
tinguish that decision from this case, we sustain the trial
Court's conclusion.”
Liggett’s decision was based upon a Pennsylvania
statute which —
Q

Mr. Lucas, before you go any further, my under­

standing of the procedural history of the case may be a little
bit different than yours — let me check it with you.
As I understand, the North Dakota District Court,
your Trial Court, gave summary judgement for the —- for Snyder*;
MR. LUCAS:
Q

That is correct.

And that was on the basis that the constitutional

provision that the North Dakota, law violated the constitutional
provision, and that the Pharmacy Board's conclusion that the
drug store didn’t meet the space
valid, for some reason.»

requirements was also in­

I take it the Pharmacy Board had two

reasons for turning down Snyder.
MR. LUCAS:

Well, there is the ownership compliance

problem, and then the physical safeguard problem.
Q

And then, when that was appealed by you to the

Supreme Court of North Dakota, the Supreme Court of North Da­
kota affirmed on the constitutional issue, but reversed the
District Court, didn't it, on the space issue, saying that the
Board should have further proceedings?
MR. LUCAS:

That is correct, your Honor.

They de­

cided. there was a fact question in regard to the physical
safeguards.
Q

Do you think this is a final judgement, then,

for purposes of our jurisdiction?
MR. LUCAS:
stitutional question.

Well, .it was final in regard tc the con­
It was remanded back dowx» for an addi­

tional hearing in regard to the physical safeguard problem of
the facility.
Q

And I suppose the Pharmacy Board could find

against Snyder's on that issue, and they could lose — they
could be denied the license, and there would be no more case.
would -there?

6
MR. LUCAS;

Well, it would be appealed, 1 imagine, by

the respondent again, if it was adverse on the physical safe­
guards feature.
Q

But very likely not on a constitutional basis.

MR. LUCAS;

No, I think that — the decision was final

in regard to the constitutional questions presented.

Now in

the Liggett decision, that involved a Pennsylvania statute
which required 100 percent ownership by a pharmacist.

And both

North Dakota Supreme Court and the Liggett decision were based
entirely on the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
We feel the basic issue here is whether the Liggett
v. Baldridge decision is proper authority for the North Dakota
Supreme Court to rely on.

Or, if it has been reversed, or if

it should be reversed.
Now, there has been a large change in the philosophy
of the Supreme Court in regard to what legal writers have re­
ferred to as economic due process since the Liggett v. Bald­
ridge decision.

In our brief we've traced this history, citing

the Lochner, the Adkins, and Coppage cases, and the later cases,
which have rejected those cases.

In examining the later cases,

such as Griswold v. Connecticut, Ferguson v. Skrupa, William­
son v, Lee Optical, Daniel v. Family Security, Seagram v. Hostetter, it’s very clear, in my examination at least, that the
doctrine that prevailed in the Coppage, Adkins, Lochner cases
has been abandoned by this Court.

This Court has stated, "We

7

emphatically refuse to go back to the time when we used the
due process clause to strike down State laws, regulatory of
business and economic affairs, because we feel they are un­
wise, imprudent, or out of harmony with some particular school
of thought."
The Court has stated, "We do not sit as a superlegis­
lature to judge the wisdom, need, reasonableness or merits of
State lav/s that touch economic problems or business affairs,
or social conditions."

That under our system of goverxment,

these issues are properly left to the legislative branch of
government.
Mow, in the Daniel v. Family Security Life case,
specific reference was made to the Liggett ca.3e, and it said
that the rationale followed in that case did not find expres­
sion in the Liggett v. Baldridge decision; and that there has
been a pronounced shift of emphasis since the Liggett v. Bald­
ridge decision.
Also, I5ve

cited various State Court decisions that

have said that the holding in Liggett has been seriously limi­
ted, if not completely undermined.
Now, based on these decisions, we feel there is an
extreme presumption of constitutionality and validity of State
Cour- — of State legislation — in this particular area, that
if the North Dakota Legislature determined that there was an
evil present, and this was a rational way to prevent this evil,

8
or to correct the exposure to this evil, that this is suffici­
ent to sustain the constitutionality and validity of this sta­
tute,

That if any set of facts can reasonably justify this

statute, we feel that it's efficient.
Now, the respondent, in their brief, have raised also
the equal protection clause; and the amicus brief of the Na­
tional Association of Chain Drug Stores devoted more time to
this.

And I think this, basically, is governed by the same

standard of review as the due process clause; that only invi­
dious discrimination is prohibited, and the States have wide
latitude in this regard.

I think it's got the same standard

as the due process clause, and, in effect, it should be also
left up to the States in their own wisdom and judgement, as
far as the passage of such legislation.
Now, the amicus, National Association of Chain Drug
Stores, also raised the commerce clause issue.

And this was

raised for the first time on appeal, and I don't think it's
properly raised, or should be under consideration here, when
it is raised for the first time on appeal.

However, the cases

they cite had to do mainly with a state's attempt to protect
local industry at the exclusion of national industry, or some
outside national commerce vehicle; and the cases they cite,
such as Dean v. City of Madison, were cases where the state
attempted to protect a local industry, such as requiring that
milk processed within five miles had to be processed within

9

five miles of the City of Madison.

And this particular statute

applies -that we have in this case equally to local corpora­
tions, local chain stores —* we have local chain stores within
the State of Worth Dakota, and this law applies equally to
those, as well as any national chain stores that they might
refer to.
Also, we do not feel that this statute has anything
to do with interstate commerce.

I think it's safe to say that

there are no prescription drugs manufactured in the State of
North Dakota; and I think I can also say that all prescription
drugs that are properly approved by the Federal government
are available in North Dakota.

And the volume and sale for

prescription drugs, of course, is governed by prescriptions
from doctors; arid if, for example, we let. a hundred more chain
stores — or if a hundred more stores open in the state, theo­
retically there would be no greater sale of prescription drugs,
because they are limited to prescriptions, and I think they
would have to point out that there are — there’s a demand for
prescription drugs which are not being filled in the state.
And there is no evidence, of course, in that regard.
Q

Mr. Luea3, what is, in your opinion, is the real

purpose behind this statute?
MR. LUCAS:
health and welfare.

Well, we feel it is related to the public
Do you want me to cover that point, I

would do it at this time —

10

Q

Well, historically, do you know what the impetus

was in this enactment in North Dakota, or Minnesota, or South
Dakota?
MR. LUCAS:

Well, the primary purpose at the time, I

think, or one of the main purposes, was to prohibit physician
ownership of drug stores,
Q

Precisely,

And what has that, therefore, to do

with public health?
MR. LUCAS:
Q

Well,—

I think you're quite correct when you made that

statement, and I —
MR. LUCAS:

In California, there was a Megan Medical

Clinic case, and they had hearings in there, and in the dec!"
sion it's documented, and there is an inherent conflict of in­
terest in physicians owning a pharmacy.

I can’t imagine a more

attractive situation —
Q

But it’s an ethical, not a public health, approach,

is it not?
MR. LUCAS:

Well, it’s related to the public health.

A physician, of course, can code the prescriptions — they all
have to go through his store — he can charge higher prices —
he can carry a lower inventory of items, and he can limit his
prescription to certain items which it more profitable for him.
The public may end up using more drugs—•
Q

On this approach, however, what justifies, then,

11

the hospital exemption in the statute?
HR. LUCAS:

Well, mainly because there a physician

can write or dispense his

own prescriptions, and I suppose,

in a hospital, they feel it will be supervised properly by
physicians in the hospital.
Q

They wouldn't —

Well, presumably a physician-owned pharmacy

would be supervised by a physician —
MR. LUCAS:

Well, in the hospital it won't be owned

by the physician, it will be owned by the hospital.
Q

Well, some hospitals are owned by physicians —

HR. LUCAS:
rect.

Apparently isn't that —

That is cox'-

I don't know that there are any in North Dakota, but

apparently the position is that it will be properly super­
vised and will not result in a danger to the public health.
Q

I have one last question.

Suppose a pharmacist

owning a drug store sells his stock down to 49 percent, what
happens, as a practical matter?
business?

Doe he have to go out of

Does the place have to go out of business?
MR. LUCAS:

If a pharmacist sells his stock down to

49 percent?
Q

Yes, to a nonpharmacist.

MR. LUCAS:
with the statute.

Yes, he would not be in compliance, then,

That's correct.

He could not do that and

still—
Q

Would your Board then put them out of business?

12

MR. LUCAS;

That has? never happened, to my knov/ledge.

I suppose it would, have to be a determination of the Board at
that time, but that is the way the statute reads.

I might add

that Pennsylvania and Maryland also that anti-physician prohi­
bition of ownership of pharmacy.

And, also in the United States

Senate, there is a Hart Bill, and they had various hearings in
the Senate, and I think it was determined that abuses were
shown in that record as well as the California case.
Q

Well, it was a distinct ethical problem at one

time, and perhaps still is.

You refer to the California situ­

ation —
MR. LUCAS;

I think it is.

Also, we feel that non­

pharmacist ownership results in a subordination of professional
responsibility and professional service to commercial motives.
Now, we feel they might emphasize profit, and there's a lot of
ways that they can emphasize profit, and the investors in non­
pharmacist owned stores, of course, are looking for a return
on their investment.

And they can do such thing as using drugs

for loss leaders to bring traffic in to sell their other pro­
ducts — furnace filters and grass seeds, and those other
things —*

They can keep their inventory down and only carry

fast moving items.

They can understaff a pharmacy so that the

pharmacist has to work long hours, very little break or rest
or time off for lunch, which results in mental fatigue, and
the possibility of error in filling a prescription —

13

Q

But isn't all of that equally true with a phar­

macist- owne d oharmacy?
MR. LUCAS:

Well, we feel that a pharmacist would --

a professional would have to be more sensitive to these prob­
lems, and more — realize the public service and public respon­
sibility — more of a policing within a profession, similar
to perhaps the law profession, that there — we have laws that
may protect these problems in some areas, but it’s an enforce­
ment problem.

And in Worth Dakota we have only one inspector,

and he is president of the State Board, and he has got all of
these other duties, and he simply can't enforce these problems,
and we feel that this, in some way, would result in a internal
policing of the profession, if pharmacists have control.
Q

Let me be sure of one fact.

If your opponents

prevail here, I take it they do not object to any provision
that the pharmacy itself shall be run by a registered pharma­
cist.
MR. LUCAS:
gard.

No, they have no objection in that re­

In their briefs they have admitted that prohibition on

physician ownership is a valid purpose — they recognise that
in their briefs.
Q

The other thing we're concerned —

Going back just a moment to the proposition that

Mr. Justice Blackmun was inquiring about:

even if it isn't

demonstrable, or provable, that the premises on which the le­
gislation was enacted are actually true, isn't the constitu-

14
fcional question whether a State legislature has the right to
think that they have an impact on public health?
MR. LUCAS:

I think that3s the point I'm trying to

make is that if they believe,, and if they voted it in, they did
believe it to be a rational basis, that statute for protection.
And I think if this is true, that is all that is required.
That the Courts are not going to try to second guess the legis­
lature on why they did this.

That it's a presumption that it's

a valid purpose and a valid statute.
Q

Mr. Lucas, how many states have s atutes as ri­

gorous as this, requiring that only pharmacists may own drug
stores?
MR. LUCAS:
ity requirement.

North Dakota is the only one with major­

Michigan has a 25 percent requirement — it's

gone to the Supreme Court three times, and it has not, to date,
by a majority decision, been declared unconstitutional.

It's a

very unusual situation there, and two or three of the Justices
wrote that they thought it was unconstitutional; one wrote that
was his opinion at first, and every Judge wrote his own opinion
— Justice wrote his own opinion, and there is no majority
decision in that Court.

And New York, I understand, passed

this legislation at a recent session, and that it was vetoed
by the government — or the governor
v. Baldridge decision.

based upon the Liggett

And Alaska, I believe, passed this re­

cently, which doesn't mean —

15

Q

You're saying that the State of New York does

not allow chain drug stores?
MR. LUCAS:
Q

They do.

Oh.

MR. LUCAS:

This prohibition was — or a statute

similar to ours was passed recently and was vetoed, as I under
stand it.
Q

Vetoed.

Oh.

Q

Well, the arguments you make in support of a

rational basis for this statute are not in the record,are they
MR. LUCAS:

They're not in the record because this

was decided on a motion for summary judgement.

We didn’t have

the opportunity to present evidence in this regard.

In Michi­

gan they had various hearings, and this is well documented
testimony from pharmacologists and practicing pharmacists in
Michigan, and various other individuals.
Q

In —

MR. LUCAS:

We wanted that opportunity but we did

not have it.
Q

You think you could produce evidence?

MR. LUCAS:
Q

Certainly.

Despite the experience in 48 other states?

MR. LUCAS:
dence.

Yes.

I'm certain that we can present the evi­

I’m sure there will be contrary evidence, too, but

certainly it will be very debatable question.

Yes?

16

Q

When was this statute enacted?

MR. LUCAS:
Q

1963.

Is there any documentary legislative history that

one can get from your State Legislature, Mr. — ?
MR. LUCAS:

I think that all is in the respondent's

brief — they have a short synopsis of reasons given at that
time, ■—
Q

At that time ---

MR. LUCAS:

But it's just in one branch, that either

the Senate or the House — it doesn' t cover both hearings.

But

I believe hearings were held in both houses, and this is —- was
their judgement after the hearings.
Q

Are the hearings transcribed, and — ?

MR. LUCAS:
Q

I think one of the —

No, they're not.

Not.

MR. LUCAS:

Just shorthand notes, or notes by whoever

is employed at the time.
Q

How far back does this kind of law go in your

State?
MR. LUCAS:
Q

Well, 1963 is itfhen it was passed.

Wasn't -- I thought there was one in 1920 or —

MR. LUCAS:

Not in North Dakota.

The Pennsylvania

and New York statute were 1928 and '29.
Q

Mr. Lucas, I'm not sure I could hear Mr. Justice

Powell's question, and I may be repetitious here.

If you should

17
prevail, would you wish to have the case remanded for the
development of the record on the issue of public health?
MR. LUCAS:
that would be fine.

Well, we had asked for that before, and
Basically, we'd just like to have Liggett

v. Baldridge, if it is to be reversed, clearly reversed at this
time, and the North Dakota Supreme Court relied completely on
Liggett v. Baldridge, so that would result in a reversal of
North Dakota Supreme Court, we believe.
Q

Wouldn't an early — the way that the rational

basis test is applied isn't by testimony and hearings in the
lower court, is it?

It's if any state of facts can be con"

ceived —
MR. LUCAS:
Q

Conceived, right.

— by the court.

You don't generally rely on

live witnesses and that sort of thing.
MR. LUCAS:

No, that's true.

That's why I'm throw­

ing out these arguments as relating it to the public health.
Q

I thought you said earlier that the constitu­

tional question was closed.
MR. LUCAS:

If it was reversed -- it was, in the

North Dakota Supreme Coxirfc, and that's why we appealed here.
And if this Court would reverse that decision, that would
close it.
Q

Well, I don't understand whether it's open or

closed as of right now —

18

MR, LUCAS;

Well, the question on the physical faci­

lities is still open, whether they have proper receiving areas,
so we don't have the cabbage and drugs coining down the same
conveyor belt, and things of this type.
sures around the facility is open.
is closed.

And the security mea­

The constitutional question

Against the —
Q

Would you also stop the drug store from selling

tractors, too, while you’re at it?
MR. LUCAS:

Well, that’s what’s happened.

They’ve

gotten into all these other areas.
Q

If the Snyder tort prevails here — in other words,

if the Supreme Court's of North Dakota decision remains standing,
under your North Dakota statute, could the Red Oil supermarket
have one side of the market for groceries and all the other
things they sell, and the other side of the same room for the
drug store?

Or are there prohibitions against that?

MR. LUCAS:

It could.

We require certain physical

safeguards, such as a chain door or a barrier of some kind,
which can secure the area from the rest of the area, so when the
stock boys are stocking shelves they are not walking in and out
of the pharmacy, too.

But they could chain off an area of some

type, as long as it was secured.
Q

Now —

Let's assume that the District — the Supreme

Court of your State had affirmed on both grounds that these
people were entitled — instead of reversing, assume they had

19

affirmed on both grounds.
MR, LUCAS:

Could you have come here?

That they would have declared our cons-

our statute unconstitutional, you mean?
Q

Yes.

But they had alvso said that they were not

entitled on other reasons —
MR. LUCAS:

No, I don't believe we could have come

here.
Q

Well, the — why can you come here now, then?

MR. LUCAS:
Q

Well, I think —

Because those grounds were before the — before

your Supreme Court.
MR. LUCAS:

Well, basically, I think because they

relied entirely on Liggett v. Baldridge, and subsequent de­
cision of this Court, I think — we think have reversed that Q

I know, but the — but they still may not be en­

titled to the license.
MR. LUCAS:
Q

Because of physical safeguards —

Yes»

MR. LUCAS:

Right.

But it would, still mean that our

statute was constitutional — the ownership statute.
Q

Well, that may be so, but let's as- — if the

Supreme Court had said (1) the statute's unconstitutional but
these people aren't entitled to it any way, for another reason
based on State law, you couldn't have come here just because
they declared your statute unconstitutional ™ ?

20

MR. LUCAS:

Well, we think that raises a constitu­

tional question which would allow us to come here.
Q

But there is an adequate State ground for the

kind of decision that Justice White is talking about.

That

whether they win or lose on the constitutional question here,
they’ll still be barred by a decision that’s adequately based
on State grounds.
MR. LUCAS:
Q

Right. Right.

So I don’t see that difference in the — than

the case -- that the case comes to us now?

It doesn’t seem to

me to be very much different.
MR. LUCAS:

Well, I think it's basically just

whether this is a proper decision of the Court in Liggett v.
Baldridge, since they relied entirely on Liggett v. Baldridge.
Q

We’re talking about our jurisdiction —

MR. LUCAS:
Q

That's what we’re talking about^ isn't it?

MR. LUCAS:
Q

Right.

Yes, sir.

Well, isn't this just another way of uttering

fir. Justice Rehnquist's question about the finality of your
judgement?

And it’s obvious that the Justices on either side

of me have some questions about it.
MR. LUCAS:

Well, our statute was declared a viola­

tion of the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution, and
that, I believe, gives the jurisdiction to be here.

21

Q

I would like to —

Q

That wouldn't forever bar you from getting here

on the constitutional question, would it?

If the next time

around with another drug operation they found them qualified,
and then rested on this prior holding, you could come up —
presumably you could try to come up here again, couldn’t you?
MR. LUCAS;

Well, if our statute was still determined

to be constitutional, and still in effect, I guess we could use
it again, but I don't think we would be —
Q

What you have to do in the meantime would be to

try to enforce the statute in the face of the adverse decision
of the Supreme Court of your own State.
MR. LUCAS;
Q

Which we can't do at this point.

Or, in this particular case, I take it, that if

the thing went back to the Pharmacy Board, and the Pharmacy
Board decides that the

space

requirements are met, you could

still appeal that through the North Dakota Supreme Court
system — you may lose on that issue — you'll certainly lose
on the constitutional issue, because there is no indication
the Supreme Court of North Dakota will change its mind.

But

then you would have a genuinely final judgement, where the
issuance or denial of the license turns on the constitutional
question and nothing else.
MR. LUCAS;
Q

That i3 correct, your Honor.

Of course, you also have a final judgement in the

22

sense that if you conceded — if the Board now conceded that
otherwise these people were entitled to — aisde from the
stock ownership, that these people were entitled to the li­
cense .
MR. LUCAS:
Q

That is correct.

Do you —■ I guess you don't, though, do you?

MR. LUCAS:

No, we don’t.

We think there is still

a physical safeguard problem, but I don't think it’s as serious
as the constitutional problem.
Now, we feel that professional pharmacies are going
to offer certain services that nonprofessional pharmacies may
not.

A lot of these services don’t result in any volume or

profit or anything to the pharmacy —* drug consultation is one
item which we feel that professionals will give — counseling
patients on interaction of drugs, or incompatibilities, or
abuse of this type.

A new area — it’s not too very new, but

in New Jersey they require the medication profile monitor, and
a pharmacy then keeps track of all drugs prescribed and dis­
pensed to a particular patient, and if he sees two or three or
four different doctors, the pharmacist has a record of all
items dispensed that that patient is receiving, and he can
monitor these prescriptions and then tell if there are any
incompatibilities or abuse or out-of-date prescriptions —
things of this type.

He also offers delivery, emergency hours,

and open charge accounts which a lot of these larger, chain-

23

store drugs don't.

And we feel that these are professional

services that are related to public health and welfare and
should be offered.
How, we feel that pharmacy is a profession —* it's
been decided by case law and statute, and we don't feel it
should be treated any differently than the profession of law,
medicine, optometry or dentistry — that we have two cases in
the U. S. Supreme Court on optometry and dentistry which state
that a corporation cannot practice through licensed individuals
those particular professions.

And we feel that the profession

of pharmacy should be treated the same way.
We submit that the philosophy of Liggett has been
abandoned, and we ask that it be clearly reversed at this time,
and that, therefore, the North Dakota Supreme Court also be
reversedy subject to questions that, I would presume —
Q

Mr. Lucas, may I ask you just one question?

I

think we'd all agree that practicing the profession of pharmacy
could be accomplished only by a licensed pharmacist.
we're talking about ownership.

But here

Now, they do not accomplish their

essential objectives of your law — ?
MR. LUCAS:

We don’t think so.

We want the people in

He just says, "You do this, or you lose your

that position*

And we want the policy makers to be profes­

sionals , so that they will offer all these services that we
think are necessary*
Q

Well, is the pharmacist, himself, bound by the

rules of the Pharmacists Association of the State?
MR. LOCAS:
Q

He is —

And this prevents him from doing such things?

MR. LUCAS:

He is, your Honor, but if a nonowner

said, "You do this or you lose your job," what are you going
to do?
Q

Well, you’d have a choice of losing your license

or your job.
MR. LUCAS:
Q

Right, but —

That's your choice.

MR. LUCAS:

We feel that the professionals would be

more sensitive —
Q

It's an essential choice to make —

MR. LUCAS:

Right.

We feel that the professional

pharmacist would be more sensitive in this area of professional
repsonsibility and professional service.

And we will not sub­

ordinate these objectives to commercial motives.
Q

And the pharmacists in North Dakota — they have

enough money to run this thing?
MR. LUCAS:
your Honor.

Well, they’re doing it, yes, sir. Yes,

25

Q

Your point on that score must be that if a phar­

macist was subordinate to a manager of the establishment, and
someone tried to get a prescription illegally, or to use an ex­
pired prescription, and he was put under the pressure that you
speak of, (1) he — if he committed the illegal act, he wouldn’t
be likely to report it to anybody —
MR. LUCAS;
Q

I assume that's reasonable.

MR. LUCAS;
Q

That’s correct —

That's correct, your Honor.

If he refused to commit the illegal act, someone

not a pharmacist might carry out the illegal act, give a pre­
scription that should no be given — give a medicine without a
prescription, which should not have been done, and thereby the
public health is injured.
MR. LUCAS:

We feel it is, your Honor.

Also, on

placement of responsibility — a nonpharmacist is not competent
to really determine the competency of a particular pharmacist.
And if he is incompetent and there is a misconduct, he'll say,
"Well, how could I know; I’m not a pharmacist.'1
Q

I've got a great problem about these stockholders

running the pharmacy.

I would think the stockholder wants a

return on his money, and he's not there to deny the — whether
you sell this prescription or not.

The stockholders are not

going to supervise the pharmacist, are they?
MR. LUCAS:

Well, majority ownership means control.

28

That gives you the majority on the board of directors which
determine policy, and this policy —
Q

That's the way you buy a nev? counter or a new

bottle washer, or what have you?

But I would assume that the

average stockholder wouldn't even know what a drug was —
right?
MR, LUCAS:

Well, we think that if they're pharma­

cists they're going to know.
Q

If they're —

Kow many pharmacists do you have in North Da-

kota?
MR. LUCAS:

I'm not sure, your Honor.

I imagine it

might be 200.
Q

I was wondering whether you don't limit the

number of pharmacies that way,
MR, LUCAS;

Well, they would be limited to — well,

one pharmacist could own more than one pharmacy, under this
lav?, if he has majority of control of each pharmacy.

We have

a local chain which probably has six locations in the six
major cities, and it could be owned by one individual if he
had majority ownership.
Q

We want policy determined by the —

And it could be that the pharmacist who is the

owner has given up his pharmacy — he just collects his money couldn't it be?
MR. LUCAS:

Well, it could be, but at least this law

would ensure that he would have some understanding of the pro-

27
fession and —
Q

But it wouldn’t ensure that he practiced it?

would it?
MR. LUCAS:

No, but it would be more likely that he

would watch it and understand the professional objectives.
Q

Again, does it not come back to whether it is

rational for the North Dakota Legislature to believe that it's
more likely — not whether you can prove that it's more likely.
MR. LUCAS:

That’s our point, that if any state of

facts can be conceived that that it justifies it.

And if they

voted it, they must have thought that there were facts —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR. LUCAS:

Very well, Mr. Lucas.

Thank you, your Honor.

Mr. Vogel?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MART R. VOGEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TEE RESPONDENT
MR. VOGEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
In response to the several questions that were raised
on the jurisdictional issue, this is not a final judgement.
The judgement entered in the case on remittitur by the trial
judge specified or directed the Pharmacy Board to hold a hear­
ing on the issues raised by the Board in connection with the
space for the pharmacy within 60 days.
Q

That was in response to the Supreme Court’s order?

28

HR, VOGEL;
Q

Yes, your Honor.

Yes.

MR. VOGEL:

If I may, I would like to take off a few

minutes to discuss the chronology of what took place —
Q

Well, by that are you suggesting there is no

jurisdictional question, in light of what you just said?
MR. VOGEL %

I'm merely answering the question that

Mr. Justice Rehnquist first raised, and that is whether or not
it was a final judgement.
Q

Well, if it is not, do we have any jurisdiction?

MR. VOGEL:
Q

I don't believe that it is.

Well, it's —■ it is questionable.

I notice in your response to the petitioners,

on jurisdiction you simply have a sentence:

"Respondent does

not question the jurisdiction as set forth..."
MR. VOGEL:

That is correct.

We did not in our

briefs — my own opinion is, I would like to see a final de­
cision out of this Court on the constitutional issue.
Q

Even though -— I know everyone who comes here

would like us to do that, but we do have limitations of juris­
diction, of course.
Q

You regretfully acknowledge that you can't con­

fer jurisdiction by stipulation —
MR. VOGEL:
Q

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

While we —

You could have — if there is no jurisdiction

here, and we dismiss, you've still got the benefit of your

29

own State Supreme Court having declared unconstitutional the
statute that you want declared unconstitutional.
MR. VOGEL:
Q

Indeed, sir.

We do have.

Is there any question about the rights if that

course were followed?

The rights of the State to try to get

back here again after they resolve the factual issues in your
State Court?
MR. VOGEL:

I should think that they could, based upon

a final judgement, assuming, for example, that the Board’s
finding with respect to the space requirement were not supported
before the trial judge, affirmed on appeal to the Supreme
Court —• I don' t — I assume that they could take the appeal
then.

If you ware -- not the appeal, but could apply again for

a writ and if you granted it, then we’d be back here.
Q

What you want us to do is say your Court was

right?
MR. VOGEL:
Q

We want, you to say our Court was right.

Even though you doubt we have the jurisdiction to

do it?
MR. VOGEL:

I'm merely answering a question, Mr.

Justice, about whether or not the judgement was a final one,
and, honestly, it isn't,
Q

Mr. Vogel, you don't have to testify being here

because you didn't corns hera of your own
MR„ VOGEL:

In fact, we were very stirprised, to tell

30

you the truth, when your writ came down.,
Q

All of these factors are not always disclosed

in the petitions and oppositions.

Did you — I don’t recall,

but did you challenge that in any way?
MR. VOGEL:
Q

Mr. Justice Brennan said you rather conceded

MR. VOGEL;
Q

No, we did not.

Conceded jurisdiction —-

— jurisdiction, which would perhaps lull the

further examination into that subject.
MR, VOGEL:

Yes, I’m sure that it would lull it,

and — well, we overlooked it, just to be honest about it —
I would like to go into this history a little further
than it has already been developed, because it, I think, es­
tablishes the real purpose, the object that the Legislature
had in passing this Act,
The law in 1963 came into being after an unsuccess­
ful attempt by the Board of Pharmacy was made to eliminate
by regulation doctor-owned pharmacies.

They attempted to do

that by the passing of a somewhat similar statute except by
regulation as we have now,.aimed at the physicians.

And, of

course, the expressed purpose of the statute from the minutes
of the Senate committee where this law originated established
that it was to prevent doctors from taking over pharmacies.
And to supply the means, or the legal remedy, to prevent that
from being done.

31
Now, Mr. Lucas made the statement that we agree that
doctor-owned pharmacies is or could be an evil.

We don't ad­

mit that, we don't concede it, and we've never said that.

We

merely indicated that there might be, assuming that there were
evidence to establish it, there might be a legitimate purpose
in preventing physicians from also owning or operating pharma­
cies .
Then, in 1968, the Family Center Drug Store applied
for a permit, and this was rejected by the Board of Pharmacy
upon the same grounds that the Board utilized in the instant
case.
Q

It*s very difficult for me to sit here and ima­

gine Liggett is still a good law.

I've been here quite a

while, and there’s never been here, as I recall, before, asking
for reapplication of it — reaffirmation of the principle.
But it belongs to something I thought had passed into the limbo.
Why doesn’t the State have the right to control corporations
and businesses — the State?
MR. VOGEL:
Q

They do have the right, but if I may —

This is the old subject of due process.

This is

the old cases -- well, you know -- you're familiar with them.
MR. VOGEL:
Q

Yes, I'm familiar with the old cases.

Counsel for Liggett was Owen J. Roberts.

J. Roberts later sat on this Court.

Owen

Owen J. Roberts was a

great advocate of substantive due process, which is all right.

32

I mean, that's a permissabie conviction.

But I just can't i-

magina — I must shepardize this thing and see if it's actu­
ally -- still exists.
MR. VOGEL:
Q

Have you shepardized it?
Yes, your Honor, we have.

Aren't you astounded that it's still around?

MR. VOGEL:

Wo, you've never overruled it, and you've

had the opportunity of overruling —
Q

You mean I personally have?

MR. VOGEL:
Q

I refer to the Court •—

Yes —

MR. VOGEL:

— in the plural.

In fact, in, I believe it was 1949, that ■—
Was it Mr. Justice Clark who referred to the Liggett case,
indicating that it had been narrowed, but not stating that it
had been overruled.
Q

And —

Why couldn't the State say that corporation

can't be used at all in this peddling of drugs?
MR. VOGEL:
Q

Beg pardon?

MR. VOGEL:
Q

The State —

That possibly the State could do that.

Just as they do with reference to the practice

of medicine, for example; the practice of law.
MR. VOGEL:

Perhaps that's right.

Corporations —

a foreign corporation coming into the S- —
Q

Then what's — what — how can you justify tills,

33

in terms of modern points of reference to the constitutions
via -~
MR. VOGEL:

Because, we say that the standard is

still the same as it was in Liggett.
Q

Well,, the due process clause of the Fourteenth

/Amendment is still in the Constitution.
MR. VOGEL:

And so is the equal protection still in

the Constitution.
Q

Well, Flanders v. Klein — do you think that

lends any support — ?
MR. VOGEL:
Q

Beg pardon, sir?

Do you think this Court’s decision last term in

Flanders v. Klein — a residency requirement for out of state
tuition -- lends some support to your position?
MR. VOGEL:

Yes, 1 think there are several cases from

this Court that lend support — recent cases.

Eisenstat --

the Eisenstat case, for example; the Lynch case — I think they
both came down in 1972.

I think there is the — is it the

Goldberg case that came down in 1971 —
Q

There is Griswold v. Connecticut, and there is

Roe, and there is Doe —
MR. VOGEL:
Q

Well, I think there are a number —

— or in the last term —

MR. VOGEL:

— of cases that indicate that there

could be at least some changing turnaround in the Court's view

34

of property rights as compared to the Court's view of liberty,
in the Fourteenth Amendment.
Q

In which category do you put the operation of a

pharmacy by a corporation?
MR. VOGEL:

I would put the operation in under both

due process and equal protection, and, as Mr. Lucas -Q

This is property you are talking about — inter­

ference with their property rights.
MR. VOGEL:

Yes, with the right to own property.

And not only corporations, Mr. Chief Justice, but also this
law strikes at an individual.

An individual can't, if he's

not a pharmacist, own a pharmacy.

And not only that, but otJ.r

law is more restrictive, even, than the Pennsylvania statute
was.
Q

Well, you can’t practice medicine in North

Dakota, T. assume, without a

meeting North Dakota standards?

isn’t that right?
MR. VOGEL:

That, of course, is true.

And you can’t

practice pharmacy without meeting North Dakota standards.
Q

Well, that's really what it comes down to, is

the legislature has said that the -- in effect — that the
operation of a pharmacy establishment is something for phar­
macists, primarily,

That’s the real contention here, isn’t

it?
MR. VOGEL:

Yes.

They put it on an ownership basis.

35
They say that you — it8s not the — really the operation of
the pharmacy — the pharmacy must still be operated by a li­
censed pharmacist; it must be run and managed by a licensed
pharmacist.

And we propose to do that.

So that when the

State comes in and says that no one except a pharmacist may own
a drug store, that’s where we say, in view of the showing that
we made before the trial court —■ and, although Mr. Lucas says
he had no opportunity of introducing any evidence to the con­
trary, he had every opportunity of doing it.

He could have pre­

sented by deposition, of course, by affidavit — and he was re­
quired to do so under our rule, with respect to summary judge­
ment, and also by the decisions of our Supreme Court.
Q

Could it say that no corporation can own a phar­

macy?
MR. VOGEL;
Q

I beg your pardon?

Could North Dakota pass a law saying that phar­

macies cannot be owned by corporations?

And I'm going to com­

bine that along with the law in Madison right after you answer.
MR. VOGEL:

Well, your Honor, given — given this

criterion — if such a statute bears a real substantial relation
to public health, safety and morals, then yes, I say that it
can.
Q

Well, why can the — say a lawyer cannot practice

as a corporation?
MR. VOGEL:

Well, the State does so.

I -- my view is

36

our view, and I think we've suggested it in the brief, is that
a lawyer and his client is an entirely, or represents an en­
tirely different relationship.
Q

Like physician and —

MR. VOGEL:

It is like a physician and patient, but

it is not like a physician and pharmacist, or a physician and
drug store.
Q

Mr. Vogel, your statement a moment ago about Mr.

Lucas being under an obligation to supply affidavits under
North Dakota summary judgement procedure — that would be
limited, wouldn’t it, to the situation where there was a dis­
puted issue of fact?
MR. VOGEL:

It would be.

And Mr. Lucas, in his re­

turn to our motion for summary judgement, flatly stated that
with respect to the constitutional issue, it is solely one of
law.

And he produced no evidence, which he could have.
Q

You know, I suppose the ordinary way, under the

rational basis test, that you justify a statute isn’t by a
parade of witnesses, but by arguments as to conceivable states
of facts that are really considered by the courts pretty much
in the abstract, aren't they?
MR. VOGEL:

Well, under our rule, as I remember,

there had — it must be more than mere argument.
Q

The —

Well, that may be under your law, but under the

Federal Constitution Law, as brother Rehnquist says, there is

37

no need for evidence, if you're just using a rational basis.
MR. VOGEL:
right.

Well, perhaps I — that, I guess, is

But before the lower court there is no indication what­

soever of any factual situations which could result in upholding
this statute as being one bearing substantially upon public
health, safety or welfare.

There wasn't the slightest indi­

And, as the Supreme. Court of North Dakota pointed out,

there was no assurance that if the Court had sent this back for
evidential hearing that evidence would or could be produced.

amicus, these imaginary situations which they call attention
to —• I — tax the credulity —■ I would think, of an impartial
judge,

the chain store drug business is interested only in commerciali­
sation — that the drugs that they put out could be poor drugs Q

Well, what do you say about the language, I think,

in McGovern v. Maryland, and perhaps some other cases, that if
any conceivable basis can be imagined by this Court, then we
must support — sustain —- the State action?
MR. VOGEL;

Q

Well —

You sav it's not conceivable that any of these

fears could be warranted by the Legislature.
MR. VOGEL;

That's what I think.

Surely if the re­

cent expressions of this Court in the cases that I quoted from
that you handed down last term, are an indication we are still

38

in the — on the proposition that the statute cannot be based
upon imaginary ills that could be dredged up, but the statute
must bear a substantial relationship to the public health,
safety and morals; and, furthermore, we have pointed out that
this statute — the object of it — and I think that's indi­
cated in the appendix to our brief — the only committee min­
utes which could be located — that the object was to prevent
doctors from taking over the pharmacy business, and to the
detriment of the local drug store owner.
Q -

If that was —

Wouldn't it almost follow that if they didn't

want doctors doing it, they would much less want businessmen
doing it?

If you reach out a little bit?
MR,VOGEL:

Number one, I think the argument is made,

and I think it was raised in California, that if a doctor owns
a drug store, whan a patient comes to him, he's going to see
to it that the drug business is funneled into his own drug
store.

And he may be over-prescribing drugs — I guess pro­

bably that was contended in the California casee, too, because
he has an interest in the drug store.
Q

I

Is your client is hooked up with a chain — a

big chain?
MR. VOGEL:

Yes.

The Standard Drugs, your Honor,

have, I think, something like 35 or 37 drug stores; they oper­
ate in five midwestem states:

Minnesota, Iowa, and so on,

and they've been in the business for a long time — I think

39

they employ something like 120 pharmacists.

They're a very

highly reputable organization, and a very efficient one.
Q

Well, does this record not show that Snyder Drug,

in turn, is owned by Red Owl?
MR. VOGEL:
Q

The supermarket chain?

MR. VOGEL:
Q
I missed
would

Oh, yes —

Yes, your Honor.

Mr. Vogel,

All of the stock is --

perhaps you've answered this? if so,

it. And, of course, this isn't your case,

but what

be your position if the PharmacyBoardregulation

was

merely directed at physicians owning pharmacies?
MR. VOGEL:
Q

From my — I'm sorry —

Go ahead.

MR. VOGEL:

From my own knowledge, and I think it's

common knowledge in Worth Dakota, there are a numberj in fact,
in Fargo I think all three of the large medical groups have
their own pharmacies.

It's a very efficient way of handling

the drug problem, to nave physicians, clinics, or individual
doctors.
Q

So that in your State, then, there is no Phar­

macy Board barrier against that kind of thing?
MR. VOGEL:
Q

Other than the ---

MR. VOGEL:
Q

Other than this —

Other than this statute —

— the ownership one.

If the Board should turn

40
around and do away with this one, but say that physicians
should not own pharmacies, what would be your attitude?

Again

I say, this isn't your case — I understand it's an unfair
question —
MR. VOGEL:

Well, California, as you know, has sus­

tained the constitutionality of such a statute.
ously question its constitutionality.

I very seri­

Absent — absence and

definite proof that out our way the physician doesn't operate
ethically, and would do the kind of act which the — such a
statute would be aimed at.

So I still say, that there would

have to be some indication, once the statute is attacked, that
the — that it does not —■ or rather that it does — I with­
draw that — rather, that it does bear a. real and substantial
relationship to the public health, safety and the morals of
the public.
Mr. Lucas did not respond to the issue of —■ on the
commerce clause that was raised by the National Association of
Chain Drug Stores in his brief.

He now says that it shouldn't

be considered because it wasn’t raised in the lower court.

We

hope that you do consider it, because we think that it is
applicable — we're sorry that we did overlook it in the lower
court proceedings.

But surely where an institution, such as

Snyder Drugs, with its large area of operation in these five
different states that I mentioned, to be prevented from cros­
sing state lines for the purpose of distributing its products,

41
in our judgement and in the judgement of the amicus which we
adopt, there is a very definite interference with the commerce
clause of the Constitution,
And, in fact, in this same note of the committee
meetings, I think one of the legislators referred to this
statute as "fence legislation" — to pxit up a fence around
North Dakota so that outsiders — chain drug stores — could
not enter,

not?

Well, that would be a legitimate stand, would it

If — I don't know — I like your state — very much —
MR, VOGEL:
Q

Thank you —

I've been there many times.

I don't know its

problems, but I could see that how, people living there — you
don't have many people — how North Dakota might become the.
subject of exploitation by Delaware corporations around the
country, using little vacuum cleaners to suck out of North
Dakota aLl the money possible and leaving nothing behind, on
which a tax base can be laid, and schools built, and so on.
could see a state saying, "We're going to stop them."

I

I don't

see why that wouldn't follow within as good a category as
health — it's certainly welfare — welfare in the sense of
selfare of the people, don't you agree?
MR. VOGEL:

No, your Honor, I can't agree.

I think

that that very definitely could be interfering with interstate
commerce.

Aside from the drug store business, chains —

42
Q

I'm just not talking about stopping movement

of goods — I'm talking about requiring every druggist in the
state — every merchant in the state •— to be a single entre­
preneur.
MR. VOGEL:
Q

You've had some discussion —

MR. VOGEL:
Q

Well, I can only go back to the —

— to the standard.

You've had some big revolutions in North Dakota.

Our Court sustained one in 1920 here *—
MR. VOGEL:
0

Yes, sir.

Remember that?

MR. VOGEL:

Yes, I do.

We also had a proposal by

one legislator during the early thirties that North Dakota
secede from the Union.
Q

Did they consider that recently?

MR. VOGEL:

It honestly was introduced to that ef­

fect.
Q

That might have solved the Turtle Mountain prob­

lem in tiie last case —■
MR. VOGEL:

Well, it would have solved this problem,

obviously, we wouldn't be here.
Well, I’ve just several minutes left.

I merely want

to say that we are not contending that the Fourteenth Amend­
ment wa3 intended to interfere with the reasonable exercise
of the police power — the —

We do contend that the Act here

43
is unreasonable in that the evidence produced by Snyders at the
time of the hearing before the trial court, to the effect that
its conduct of the drug business would be under North Dakota
pharmacists, strictly for the people's benefit, and that because
of the close regulation by Federal, State statutes, and the
regulation promulgated under those statutes — that there just
is no reason for this law, because die re isn't any evil.

And

we don't think that you have abandoned entirely the — and you
haven't abandoned this proposition of Liggett — that the legis­
lation — legislative means must substantially further legis­
lative ends.
Or, at the very least, we say that there must be a
showing made, by the state, of a minimal, rational means and
relationship to that — the object, of the statute.

We just

maintain that this statute makes no sense, insofar as the public
health, welfare —

It does make sense, if the purpose was tc

keep the druggists in business.

It could make some

3ense,

assuming proof, again, that the physicians should not own a
drug 3tore.
Thank you, sir.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Vogel.

Mr. Lucas, your time was expired, but we took up considerable
amount at the end.

Do you have anything urgent that you wish

to say for a minute or two?

ORAL CONTINUATION OF ARGUMENT BY A. WILLIAM LUCAS,
ESQ., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, LUCAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I don’t have anything real urgent, but I would like
to say that in my return to the motion I admitted that there
was no question of fact in regard to the basic ownership, as
to who owned the stock.

I think there’s an obvious question

of fact whether the statute is related to the public health
and safety.
And one point, as far as relating it, that I didn’t
mention:

in North Dakota, e£ course, we need small town

pharmacies, and when you get interstate highways, and ease
of trans- — getting to the bigger cities — when these chain
stores advertise five quarts of motor oil for a dollar, and
they all run to Bisraark to get their motor oil and pick up
their prescriptions, this hurts the small town pharmacies,
and as a public health requirement and necessity, I think that
the small town’s have their pharmacies.

And this is another

basis that could be used to justify it.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:50 o’clock a.m,, the case was
submitted.]
