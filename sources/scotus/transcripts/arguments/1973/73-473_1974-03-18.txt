PROCEEDINGS
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear

arguments next in No. 73-^73, Taylor versus Hayes.
Mr. Sedler, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT ALLEN SEDLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are two basic parts to this case.

One,

going to the exercise of the summary contempt power, the
other going to the right to trial by jury in cases of
criminal contempt.
With respect to the first part, the Petitioner
contends that this Court should hold that even if the trial
judge is going to be allowed to proceed summarily, there is
a minimal entitlement to a hearing, notice of the charge,
opportunity to respond and judgment.
Secondly, we contend that in the circumstances
of this case, the trial judge, the Respondent here, was so
personally embroiled in controversy with the Petitioner that
he could not impartially sit in judgment on the multiple
contempt charges that he leveled against him.
We would also ask this Court to consider, the
issue having been briefed by the parties, xihether the
summary contempt power itself is unconstitutional.

If the

4
Court is going to hold —
QUESTION:

Was that raised in the Kentucky Court

of Appeals?
MR. SEDLER:

Your Honor, not specifically.

The —

where it was specifically raised as such was in the Petition
for Certiorari.
It seemed to me that as we were developing these
arguments before the Court, it was impossible to separate
the inherent unfairness in the exercise of the summary
contempt power from questions such as the right to a hearing,
the embroilment of a particular judge.
If I may draw an analogy, it seems that long ago
this Court has recognized that the summary contempt power is
arbitrary in its nature and is subject to reviews and over
the years, it has worked out various refinements.

B'or

example, under Federal Rule 42(a), the charges must be
specified.

It has developed a doctrine of embroilment and

controversy, of bias.
Now we are asking the Court to come up with still
another correction on the doctrine, such as to make it clear
that there is the right to a hearing and It seems to me that
the Court, in so doing, is merely treating symptoms and that
the Court might wish to consider in this case going to the
disease, itself and the disease, we feel, is the summary
contempt power which combines In It the Inherently

5
inconsistent functions of prosecutor, judge and jury in the
same individual who is necessarily involved in the events
leading up to the charge and this is why —
QUESTION:
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:

How would the judge maintain decorum?
Pardon?
How would the judge maintain decorum

in his courtroom?
MR. SEDLER:

By citing the offending lawyer or

party for contempt.
QUESTION:
MR. SEDLER:

You think that is enough?
I think, your Honor, that that

should be a sufficient deterrent in all but the most serious
cases of persistent obstruction which all the empirical
evidence indicates is virtually nonexistent.
QUESTION:
big hunk?

Well, aren't you biting off a pi°etty

You don’t need that for this, do you?
MR. SEDLER:

This is true, your Honor.

We do not

need it for this case but I honestly feel the problem will
remain, the problem of the embroiled judge.

The problem of

the non-embroiled judge, who may try as best as he or she
can impartially to sit in judgment still cannot separate his
role from prosecuting judge, from trial judge.
I think that it is necessary to — if I may say
so — in order to ensure proper respect for the adminis­
tration of justice in this country, we must put the

6
responsibility where it lies and that responsibility is on
the court itself.
The summary contempt power, I would submit,
produces far more disrespect for the administration of
justice than any act a. disruptive client or a lawyer could
do and I think the exercise of that power in the case at Bar
shows the disrespect that can result.
QUESTION:

While I do —

Are you suggesting that the existence

of this summary contempt power in some way explains or excuses
the conduct of this lawyer in this case?
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:

Well, your Honor, I —
That this would have provoked him to

act that way?
MR. SEDLER:

I would take the position, going

back one step before, in the first place, I would respect­
fully dispute there was any improper conduct on the part of
the

present Petitioner.

The Court did not grant certiorari

on the issues of whether the conduct constituted criminal
contempt.

But I would, submit that the Petitioner here did

nothing more than vigorously defend, to the best of his
ability, his client

charged with a capital offense.

But armed with the summary contempt power, the
Respondent in this case could proceed as an activist seeking
combat, knowing that at any time he got the worst of the
exchange, he could always invoke the summary contempt power.

7
I think that comes out most clearly on Contempt
Number 3, where the trial judge had said to the Petitioner
and counsel for the other defendant, "You may have this
blackboard in the courtroom and you may ivrite on the black­
board the inconsistent statements that the case of the key
prosecution witness showed," and counsel and counsel for the
co-defendant did so.
At the

end of this, the trial judge suddenly

says, "Mr. Sheriff, remove the blackboard from the room."
Petitioner files an objection.
him with sarcastic

The trial judge overrules

comment — right in front of the jury —

"The time to argue your case is at the close of the
evidence."

The Petitioner responded in kind, "I'll

certainly keep that in mind, your Honor."
The trial judge, though, had the summary contempt
power and he says, "Contempt, six months in prison."
Now, this, I submit, is just fundamentally
unfair.

It is also interesting to note that the case that I

think sparked this concern about so-called "courtroom
disruption," the so-called "Chicago 7" case, when it was
tried before a judge appointed by your Honor, who was not,
certainly, personally involved -- embroiled in controversy —
this judge found that every act of the lawyer defendants and
every act of the non-lawyer defendants except coming into
court with judicial robes, that he found contemptuous, was a

8
response, albeit an excessive one, to preemptory action on
behalf of the judge.
I think the danger of the existence of the
summary contempt power may be threefold.

It encourages judges

to act arbitrarily and tyrannically, knowing that they can
always come down xvith the summary contempt power on a lawyer.
Secondly, it inhibits, it has a chilling effect
on vigorous and effective advocacy because if the lawyer is
found by the trial judge to have overstepped the line, the
trial judge doesn’t have to warn him or anything, the trial
judge, as the trial judge did in this case, can just say
"contempt."
This causes a lawyer to pull his punches.
Thirdly, I think that the exercise of the summary
contempt power causes the public to lose confidence in the
administration of justice.

When the public sees a judge

sitting up there as judge, jury and pz*osecutor and reading
out sentences totalling four and a half years.

This, I do

think, brings across the notion, well, what kind of justice
is there if the judge can do this?

And so I think it is in

the interest of the administration of justice that the
summary contempt power with its inherent unfairness be given
a well-deserved interment by this Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sedler, you say that the summary

contempt power makes a lawyer tend to pull his punches.

I

9
I take It if the judge is going to retain any control of the
proceedings there has got to be something that makes counsel
for each side pull his punches on occasion after the Court
has indicated their particular line of questioning will be
prohibit or something like that.
MR. SEDLER:

Well, I think that the — as the

study, "Disorder in Court" indicates, the judge does this
by maintaining control over the proceedings as the judge.

If

the lawyer —
QUESTION:
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:

But how does he maintain that control?
By ruling on —
But what If counsel doesn't follow

his rules?
MR. SEDLER:

Then the judge can say, "Counsel,

I've heard enough argument on this point.
QUESTION:

Let us proceed."

Well, and what if counsel continues

to argue?
MR. SEDLER:

At that point, the judge has the

power, and should have the power — we don't dispute that —
to cite the counsel for contempt.

There is no challenge to

criminal contempt.
QUESTION:

But no punishment can be meted out

during the course of those proceedings.
MR. SEDLER:

[Overriding]:

On the spot.

On the

spot and I would submit that, just as any other social —

10
anti-social conduct is considered deterred by the possibility
of punishment at a later date, the same should be true of
lawyer misconduct.
In other words, the judge will have cited the
lawyer for contempt.

The lawyer knows that as a result of

that citation, he will face a criminal charge of contempt
with possible Imprisonment and possible Bar disciplinary
proceedings.
QUESTION:

Doesn’t he know that when he is

admitted to the Bar?
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:
MR. SEDLER:

Well, he's aware —
Isn't he?
He doesn't have much choice.

I mean

the summary contempt po~wer exists.
QUESTION:
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:

I mean, when he takes his oa.th,
When he takes his oath, he is aware
He knows that if he gets out of line,

he is going to be punished.
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:

And punished summarily.
No, I didn’t say that.

I said he

knows he is going to be punished.
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:

Or can be punished.
So you say, by putting additional on,

he is saying, "We'11 try you later.”
Turnings.

So now he has got two

How many more are you going to give him?

11

MR, SEDLER:

I think that that would be enough,

What frightens me , your Honor —
QUESTION:

The two warnings would be enough.

The first one Isn’t enough.
MR. SEDLER:

Well, I think the problem Is not

so much a question of one.

I may say with all due respect,

I think we've focused on the wrong person.
on the lawyei*.

We've focused

I would respectfully suggest —

QUESTION:

Do you want the lawyer to hold the

judge in contempt?
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:
MR. SEDLER:

Well, there is an inherent —
Do you want to give him that job?
I think that the problem Is that

judges can act arbitrarily without any realistic sanction
whatsoever and I don't think we

ought to allow them the

summary contempt power which just simply encourages them to
act arbitrary and the rare judges

that will do so, one of

the things that all the empirical evidence shows is that the
summary contempt power is very rarely used by judges.
Most judges can maintain order and

decorum in

the courtroom without any resort to the summary contempt
power at all.

But the legitimate interest, the obviously

compelling interest, if you will, in maintaining courtroom
order, can adequately be maintained by citing the lawyer
for contempt.

12
Now, In the extremely rare case where a lawyer is
engaged on a course of persistent disruption, finding him
guilty of contempt isn’t going to do any good, either.

By that

time the trial will have turned into a shambles and the court
should declare a mistrial.
It is very interesting in this case, is that while
the Respondent castigates the conduct of the Petitioner and
says in his brief that it surely must have prejudiced his
client’s right to a fair trial, the Respondent not only did
not declare a mistrial, but when counsel for the codefendant claimed that the Petitioner's conduct prejudiced
their client’s right to a fair trial, the trial judge
rejected that contention and of course, that decision was
affirmed by the Kentucky Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

Well, didn’t your client move for a

mistrial?
MR. SEDLER:

He moved for a mistrial on numerous

grounds.
QUESTION:
MR, SEDLER:

On this ground.
No, because my client, I would

submit, and I think the record would reveal, v^as

trying to

vigorously defend his client in a highly emotionally charged,
situation.

He was coming up against a very hostile trial

judge who gave — I think the record will reveal — the
prosecution a great deal of leeway.

The prosecution’s case

13
took four days.

When the case for both defendants came up,

it only took a matter of three days and the trial judge kept
saying, "Let’s move along.
call this witness.

Let’s get it over.

He has nothing to add.

Let’s move it over."

You can't

Let’s get it on.

Six of the eight contempts occurred

during the defense part of the case.

This is the time of

the case where the attorney is most

vulnerable, where the

attorney has to do everything that he can to protect his
client, to present his case to the jury, all the while
battling with the trial judge, 30 to speak.
It is in this part of the case that the lawyer
is most apt to step over that line, the line where
permissable advocacy may constitute obstruction of justice.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Sedler, I think the way

many of us learned to practice law was that if the trial
judge was unfair to you or you felt was hostile to you, you
felt you had to abide his rulings, your

remedy was by

appeal, that you could get that reversed on appeal.
MR. SELLER:

Your Honor, when you take an appeal,

you run into the problem of substantial error,

The dynamics

of the trial show that what may seem an egregious error at the
time, when viewed by the appellate court in context with a
presumption of validity of a conviction, will frequently be
found to be harmless error and the dynamics of the trial re­
quire that the lawyer vigorously defend his client against

vrtiat he believes the hostile actions of the trial Judge.
Nows again, we are not saying that the lawyer
cannot be punished for criminal contempt.

When the lawyer's

conduct is contemptuous, he can and should be punished for
criminal contempt.
All we say is that this should occur in
accordance with the time-tested requirements of due process
of law, that the trial judge should not be able to proceed
summarily, that no matter how he tries, he cannot divorce
himself from the fact that he is involved in the events
leading up to the trial.
Moreover, in a criminal proceeding in which the
accused faced originally four and a half years imprisonment
and now is cut down to six months so as to defeat the claim
of the jury trial, you have the trial judge performing, the
necessarily inconsistent functions of prosecutor, jury and
judge.

I think that is one of the crucial things that is

wrong with the criminal conempt power.
Our system of criminal procedure is adversary
and accusatory.

The judge, jury and prosecutor each have a

well-defined role to play in the process.

We suddenly, for

this shibboleth of preventing disruption, combine it into a
single individual who is necessarily involved in the events
leading up to the charge and I think that no matter how you
put it, it is just fundamentally unfair and that in light of

15
contemporary standards of due process as recognised by this
Courts the summary contempt power should be declared invalid.
Certainly, at a minimum in this case, the Court
should hold that there is a right to a hearing.

By hearing,

I mean a separation,even if it’s on the spot, a separation
of the contempt proceedings from the other events involved in
the trial.
The lawyer has to be defending the interests of
his client.

He can't put his own interest in front.
QUESTION:

Suppose a lawyer is contemptuous to

the Supreme Court of the state, what court would sit on
that one?
MR, SEDLER:

I fail to see, your Honor — well,

let’s assume that the lawyer filed a false brief or
pleadings or something of that sort —
QUESTION:

No.

No, he stood up in an open court

and did all the things you and I know can possibly be done.
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:

Well, assume —
In absolute contempt of the court.

You say some other court should do it.

Now, what other

court?
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:
MR. SEDLER:

Assuming —
What?
—- in Kentucky, we have- a procedure

by which when all of the judges of the Court of

Appeals are

disqualified from hearing a case because of interest or

16
involvement, the Governor can appoint pro tem, special judges
to hear that contempt.
QUESTION:

And that would be the protection that

the Supreme Court would get?
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:
in his court.

Well, the terms of protection —
Well, suppose somebody is contemptuous

Nov;, what court will operate then?

All I am talking about, why do you say that all
summary contempts must be washed out with one stroke of the
pen?

Why all?
MR. SEDLER:

Well, I guess that the best answer

that I would give to your Honor is that the exercise of the
summary contempt power is inconsistent ’with those time-tested
principles of due process because it does combine the
inherently inconsistent functions of prosecutor, jury and
judge in the same person and it also is the person who is
necessarily involved in the event.
QUESTION:

You said that.

Well, that is the only

answer you have.
MR. SEDLER:

And the other answer that I would

give is that the Court has long held that judicial power must
be exercised by the means — not the least adequate but the
least extreme means that are necessary to achieve the
objective, but that would indicate, in answer to your Honor’s
question, that maybe there would be no choice but that the

17
Supreme Court or an appellate court, would have to exercise
summary contempt power.
But that Is not where the problem arises.
is not where the cases come up.

That

The cases come up from trial

courts and so I would say that the means — the power must
be the least adequate to deal with the problems presented,
then

this would Justify holding that the summary contempt

power is unconstitutional when exercised by the

trial judge.

Necessity justifies the power if at all, necessity should
impose its limits.
QUESTION:

I suppose, to that extent, your

position, if accepted, i\fould invalidate Rule il2(a), 'would
it not?
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
And also the underlying statute.

MR. SEDLER:

Well, I don’t believe that the

underlying statute — well, we are not challenging criminal
contempt.

In other words, we are not challenging the federal

or state statutes that provide for criminal contempt.

All

we are saying is —
QUESTION:

But I thought the federal statute

dealt by definition, doesn’t it, with what is a criminal
centempt?
MR. SEDLER;
a criminal contempt.

Yes,

We are not questioning what is

All we are saying, your Honor, is that

18
criminal contempt should not be punished primarily.
QUESTION:

So what you are saying is, you would

invalidate only 42(a).
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:

42(a).
And all contempt process would be

under 42(b).
MR. SEDLER:

Under 42(b) or, preferably, with a

jury and this, I think, moves up into the second Issue In
this case and here, again —
QUESTION:

Mr. Sedler, before you get there, just

as a matter of curiosity, is your client, Mr. Taylor, a
member of the Bar of Kentucky?
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
This wasn't a pro haec vise case?

MR. SEDLER:

Oh, no.

Mr. Taylor has long been a

member of the Kentucky Bar and defended some 100 capital cases,
extremely well-known to the trial judges,
QUESTION:

This is not a —

If this conviction holds up, Is he

likely to be disbarred?
MR. SEDLER:
disciplinary action

He certainly will be subject to

which could reach disbarment proportions.

I think that this is one of the reasons which shows why
criminal contempt is a serious offense whenever a lawyer is
involved and -- but —
QUESTION:

Excuse me, Mr. Sedler, if you follow a

19

rule '42 j if that is what you say constitutionally would be
required, 42(b) procedure, whether state or federal, what
issues would be determined at the hearing?
MR. SEDLER:

Whether the conduct constituted

criminal contempt.
QUESTION:

I see.

The judge in whose presence

the conduct was committed, could not say, that is contempt
and. —
MR. SEDLER:

[Overriding]

In other words, he

would cite and specify —
QUESTION:

He wouldn’t cite just for punishment.

He would cite for a determination —
MR. SEDLER:

For guilt as well.

It is somewhat

analagous to a grand jury indictment.
QUESTION:

Right and you would have a

you

are coming now, you would say that the Constitution would
also require a jury trial.
MR. SEDLER:
Court takes.

Well, depending on the view that the

The point that I — the submission that I

would make is that contempt of court, as defined by recent
decisions of this Court such as the Little case, necessarily
constitutes a serious offense within the meaning of the trial
by jury guarantee because it is the kind of offenses it is
material, intentional obstruction to the administration of
justice that is likely to be regarded as contrary to the

20

ethics of the community and., secondly, there are 3ome sub­
sidiary arguments.
involve lawyers.

Many of the criminal contempt cases
Lawyer's do suffer collateral consequences

which should be taken into account.

Moreover, the Court

itself, is sitting in judgment on a contempt charge.

If

justice must serve the appearance of justice, there is some­
thing, again, seriously questionable about a court sitting in
judgment on the charge of contempt of court.
But I think that those are subsidiary arguments.
I think the major argument is that contempt is a serious
offense because it is so regarded by the society as a whole
and I think in this regard it is because criminal contempt has
been defined by this Court not merely to include so-called
"disrespect for the person of the trial judge," but as
requiring an actual, intentional, material obstruction to
the administration of justice.
At least the Court should hold that where there
is the possibility of substantial imprisonment, let’s say
beyond the 10 days approved in the Dyke case, that contempt
should be —
QUESTION:

Don’t you think that 10 days should

be substantial imprisonment for a lawyer?
MR. SEDLER:

Well, I would argue, your Honor, in

light of Argersinger, that any Imprisonment —
QUESTION:

I would think so.

21
MR. SEDLER:

— makes the charge a serious one

within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of
right to trial by jury.
It seems to me, going on to that point, that the
Sixth Amendment speaks In clear terms of all criminal
prosecution and just as the Court has held that an attorney
I'm sorry, an attorney is required in all criminal prose­
cutions, so, too, a jury trial should be required.

The

only difference is the historical genealogy of the right to
trial by jury but when the Court has been dealing with the
7th Amendment right to trial by jury in civil cases, it has
disregarded historical practice, even though, under the
Kleinoff Doctrine, In actions the law is historically
equitable, the court could award damages without a jury.
This Court has held that every time there is a
claim for damages, there must be the right to trial by jury.
It seems to me that the terms of the Sixth Amendment are
just as clear and that, regardless of the historical
practice, the clear thrust of the Sixth Amendment is to
require the right to trial by jury in every case where any
imprisonment is involved and, obviously —
QUESTION:
Amendment, aren't we?
MR. SEDLER:

We are, though, with the l;-lth
Wasn’t this a state trial?
Yes, your Honor, but as I read

Duncan, it holds that the same standards apply — same jury

22
standards apply to the state courts.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the Court has never held that

the l^th Amendment Incorporates or absorbs or whatever the
figure of speech may be, the right to jury trial to be found
in the Seventh Amendment.
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:

In civil actions, no, your Honor.
No.

MR. SEDLER;

Your

Honor, I have reserved

rebuttal time.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sedler, let me go back to a

response you gave to Mr. Justice Rehnquist• If I followed you,
what you said was that the right to appeal Is riot a genuine
and meaningful remedy, if the court has overreached.
not fill in beyond that.

You did

Am I to take It that your view is

that since the right to appeal for the overreaching or
arbitrariness of the judge is not a meaningful remedy, that
then the lawyer Is free to try to outshout the judge?
MR. SEDLER:
QUESTION:
MR. SEDLER:

No.
Well, then, what are the alternatives?
Well, I think if I were to be put —

I was answering Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question in regard
to Chilling Effect, into the fact that the lawyer who must
try to protect the rights of his client may be chilled in his
efforts to protest trial errors at the time that they occur
and my point was that merely because he has a right to appeal

23

trial errors doesn't mean that he can ignore the trial errors
at the time that they have occurred.

His duty to his client

requires him to try to correct the trial error before the
judge because those errors cumulatively could have an impact
on the trial even though, taken by themselves, they might not
constitute substantial and reversible error.
QUESTION:

Would you think it is not contempt if,

after a judge — the trial judge has ruled and announced his
ruling, that the lawyer insists upon continuing argument of
the ruling which has been closed?
MR. SEDLER:
where the trial

I think that the line is drawn

judge says, "Counsel, I have heard enough

argument on this point.

Proceed."

See, one of the things that I think appears from
the record in this case, your Honor, was at no

time did the

trial judge say during this trial, "Mr. Taylor, I want you to
stop this behavior.
argument.

I want you to stop this line of

You are heading towards the line where advocacy

becomes contempt."

It was sort

of as if the judge was

waiting and waiting and then either something hit him
personally or he thought the line was crossed and pounced
down, as he put it in his tirade from the bench, "I have you.
Nine counts of contempt."

And I think that during the

course of the trial, yes, there comes a time when the trial
judge must be able to say to the lawyer, "Argument is stopped

on this point.

If you have any further thing you want to

say to the Appellate Court, say it in the record, for I want
to leave this matter and get on to something else,” and I
think at that point, if the lawyer proceeds, he could be
cited for contempt and although this Court has not granted
certiorari on the substance of contempt charges, I think a
cursory examination of the charges almost on their face will
reveal that they do not constitute criminal contempt under the
standards promulgated by the Court.
Thank you, your Honor, I’ve reserved rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Sedler.

Mr. Triplett.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY A. TRIPLETT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, TRIPLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
With the Court’s permission, I will deal first
with the question raised in this petition as to whether or
not the Petitioner Taylor was given a right to be heard
during the proceedings that insulted in his conviction for
criminal contempt.
It is our position, and we think the record
completely sustains it, that all during the trial and at each
time the Petitioner was cited for contempt by Judge Hayes,
that he was, indeed, given a reasonable opportunity to be

25
heard and, In most instances, he took it.

So it is our

position here that this is really not a question of law but
a question of fact as to whether or not this 15-volume
transcript sustains the position that Taylor was, indeed,
given the chance to be heard on the contempt and whether or
not iie was given the right to state the mitigating factors
which, if elocution does exist, in

a summary contempt

proceedings, he would be entitled to give.
It is our contention that the record does, indeed,
show that each instance that he gave a mitigating circum­
stance of which he was aware, these included a marriage, a
funeral, working without pay, long hours and being tired.
So, first, it is our position that the record
sustains a hearing.
QUESTION:

I missed what you said a moment ago.

Working without pay, long hours and being tired and what?
MR. TRIPLETT:

A marriage, a funeral and that

sort of thing, things that caused him to be tired and things
that —
QUESTION:

Who?

MR. TRIPLETT:

Who was tired?
Mr. Taylor.

And keeping in mind

Mr. Taylor ivas there, there were two or three other lawyers
representing the co-defendant in the trial and of course
the court would be the principals involved in this case.
we say the record is replete with that.

So

26

Second, we say that not only do we say that the
record does sustain that he \vTas heard, as we understand, the
decisions of this Court, starting with Terry and all the
discussions that have occurred since Terry about the
validity of Terry, it nevertheless remains that in Terry,
this was

the case where David Terry knocked a marshal down

after the marshal started to eject his wife from the court­
room and in afirming or, rather, refusing to grant a writ of
habeas corpus, this Court said that there was a right of
instant apprehension and imprisonment with no elocution.
Coming forward to the case involving Judge Medina,
the Sacher case, although this Court took that case solely
on the question of the bias of Judge Medina and his
qualification to hear the contempts involving the Attorney
Sacher, the premise of the case was that there was no
elocution as it is explicitly stated in the Federal Rules,
that is, the right to speak at the time of the sentencing.
However, in Sacher, the same kind of elocution
occurred as occurred here.

Throughout the nine months trial,

tiiere was continual dialogue between Judge Medina and the
lawyers involved and there couldn’t be much doubt that every­
body was pretty aware of what was transpiring and this Court
did not set aside that conviction because of a right —
because of no hearing.

And this seems to have

been the

procedure all through in the Sarafite case, the Ungar-Sarafifce

27
case, again, there was a lot of dialogue in the trial between
Judge Sarafite and Ungar, who was on the witness stand during
?
the trial of Hulynj ack and I think the hearing took place two
days after the trial.
Ungar appeared with a lawyer, the lawyer moved
for a continuance.

When the judge wouldn't give him a

continuance he withdrew from the case and then Ungar, all
he

said, was "I'm not feeling well.

I'd like a continuance,"

and that was the elocution in that case and this Court held
that conviction sufficient.
Now, next, I would like to return very quickly
to the right of a trial by jury in this case.

The

Petitioner stands convicted of criminal contempt.

The

highest court in the Commonwealth of Kentucky has said that
his ultimate sentence to be served is six months.
We say, taking the literal language in the
Bloom against Illinois

case, where the petitioner got 2 k

months for offering a will alleged to be forged and which
was reversed by this case and keeping in mind that the
Bloom against Illinois case, the opinion was released on
May 20th, 1968 the

same date as Duncan against Louisiana. .

It is said, under the rule in Chapman, when the
legislature has not expressed a judgment as to the seriousness
of an offense by fixing a maximum penalty which may be
imposed, we are to look to the penalty actually imposed as to

28
the best evidence of the seriousness of the offense.
QUESTION:

Mr. Triplett, I ara a little curious.

I realize the Kentucky Court of Appeals has spoken in this
case but apart from that, under Kentucky law, would the
sentences initially Imposed be consecutive or concurrent?
MR. TRIPLETT:

As they were initially imposed

by Judge Hayes, they were consecutive.
QUESTION:

Consecutive.

MR. TRIPLETT:

After they were imposed, Judge

Hayes corrected his judgment with the Court of Appeals of
Kentucky's permission and eliminated the requirement of
consecutiveness and it was the ultimate judgment of the
Court of Appeals that this meant six months.
Although we briefed the question of the rip;ht
of the trial court and of the Court of Appeals to submit this
correction, and of Judge Hayes to do it, thi3 point is
conceded by Petitioner on page 21 of his brief when he says,
"In addition, the Respondent makes much of the fact that an
appellate court has the power to modify sentences, this
Petitioner does not dispute."
QUESTION:

In that connection, do you have

Appellate review of sentences in Kentucky?
MR. TRIPLETT:

Yes, sir.

The right to modify and

eliminate and reduce contempt sentences in my mind is really
not open to serious question.

29

QUESTION:

When the Bar Association considers

this case, will they consider it as one six months or —
MR. TRIPLETT:

One six months, Mr. Justice

Marshall.
QUESTION:

How many counts?

MR. TRIPLETT:
QUESTION:

On eight counts.

Well, he'll be considered as guilty

on all eight counts.
MR. TRIPLETT:
Kentucky has

affirmed it.

Yes, sir.

The Court of Appeals of

This Court has refused to grant

cert on that question and if the Bar Association does do it,
they haven't yet, I don't know that they will, they would
have the ripjht to do it, but if they do do it, you are
exactly correct that they would consider the eight findings
of contempt as bearing on any disciplinary action that might
ultimately be taken.

I think I would have to state that to

you fairly.
QUESTION:

Well, what you are saying there,

really, is no more than that they would act on the whole
record.
MR. TRIPLETT:
correct, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

That is correct, sir.

That is

Mow —-

Mr. Triplett, is there any limitation

in Kentucky law as to the sentence that can be given by a
trial judge for criminal contempt?

30

HR. TRIPLETT:
was not.

Mo,

Mr. Justice Stewart, there

This was somewhat up In the air, although the trend

was away from It, but the Court of Appeals case of Taylor
against Hayes declared the limiting statute unconstitutional,
as being abridgement on the Court’s power to function.
So at this point in time, Mr. Justice, there Is
limitation.

We used to have the 30-hour or $30 rule —
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. TRIPLETT:

— that began to be eroded some

years back and they turned it off completely in this case,
QUESTION:

So now,

so far, at least as

theoretical power goes, a trial judge could send somebody to
be locked up for the rest of his life for criminal contempt.
MR. TRIPLETT:

Theoretically, that was true.

It

was true in Bloom against Illinois, yes, sir,
QUESTION:

Mr. Triplett, let me go back a little

bit to something you touched on in response to a question
partly from Mr. Justice Stewart.

At what stage and as to

which of the particular episodes did Mr. Taylor respond
saying that his conduct was accounted for by the fact that
there had been a funeral or a wedding and a lot of other
things?

'Were you drawing together a whole series of things?
MR. TRIPLETT:

isolated portions of it.

I was drawing a series of things,
It was all wrapped up in his final

argument to the jury when he said this, and this is —

31
QUESTION:

Where are you now?

MR. TRIPLETT:

On page 119 of the transcript,

Mr. Chief Justice, where Petitioner says this, "I want to
try to close.

I want to apologize to the Court if

I

have

been intemperate and state to the Court that it vrould have
only been because of the desire to see justice done and the
clear conviction and belief that my client is innocent.

I

want to tell you that life has moved on since this case
began.

There has been a wedding in my family, a funeral of

a dear friend of mine —" and those things are interspersed
throughout the trial, fir. Chief Justice and we think that all
of this, for example, Petitioner at one point during the
trial, asked to be excused on a Saturday afternoon, and the
transcript will support this, so he could go to this
wedding;.

A

relative was

flying in,

and we also contend that

the transcript shows a great deal of consideration toward
Petitioner’s problems by the trial court.
Wrapping up this jury matter very quickly, in
Frank

versus the United States in ’69, this Court affirmed

the judgment where Mr. Frank got a three-year suspended
sentence for a stock fraud case.
In the Cheff against Schnackenberg

case of 166,

this was where Mr. Cheff violated a cease and desist order
and three judges of the Seventh Circuit tried him and gave
him six months.

This Court held that it was a petty offense.

32
So we think that what happened here is well within
the decisions of this Court.
Now, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the
Court, I would like to turn to what I consider the third
phase of this case as I understand the questions upon which
this Court granted certiorari and that relates to the
alleged bias ans hostility of Judge Hayes as to render him
unqualified to pass Judgment on these contempts.
We start with Mayberry.
Mayberry occurred here.
of Judge Hayes.

Nothing similar to

There was no vilification by Taylor

There were no epithets hurled at Judge Hayes.

Second, vie come to Offutt.

There is nothing

similar to what occurred in Offutt here.
QUESTION:

What about— aha, now I got you.

MR. TRIPLETT:

I beg your pardon, Mr. Justice, I

didn’t hear you.
QUESTION:

What about the Judge saying, "Aha, now

I got you"?
MR. TRIPLETT:

We say that that occurred after

the judgments of contempt had been — wait a minute, sir, I
don't recall anything in this trial or this transcript that
says where Judge Hayes said to Taylor, "Now I've got you."
QUESTION:

That may not be exact words, but it

is close to it.
MR. TRIPLETT:

I dispute that, Mr. Justice Marshall.

33
I dispute that Judge Hayes said that.
QUESTION:

Well, I'll have to find it.

MR. TRIPLETT:
Now, let me be

All right, sir.
very clear and honest.

At the

time he imposed the sentences, there was language in there,
he says, "I have got you on nine contempts.1'
QUESTION:

Well, that Is what I was talking

about.
MR. TRIPLETT:

Well, I read that in a different

context, Mr. Justice Marshall, as saying, "Now, I've got you.
QUESTION:

Well, "Nov; I've got you on nine

counts."
MR. TRIPLETT:
QUESTION:

That is correct, sir.

I stand corrected.

I stand

corrected.
MR. TRIPLETT:
QUESTION:

I don’t mean to be argumentative.

I stand corrected.

All right, sir,

nine counts instead of one.
MR. TRIPLETT:
exactly what he said.

That is correct, sir.

That is

Now, it is our position, Mr. Justice,

and may it please the Court, that at the time of sentence,
the trial had occurred on the matter of contempt and at some
point, in imposing punishment, a judge must have the last say
and the last word.
occurred.

The right to be heard, we say, had

The reason for mitigation and defense had

3^

occurred.
It is not uncommon for judges at the end of a
trial — and I am not speaking only of lawyers at this point,
I am speaking of a defendant.

Suppose a judge hears a particu­

larly aggravated case that just shocks the conscience of any
human being.

It is not uncommon for state and federal judges,

and I have heard them both do it, to just absolutely take the
defendant apart when he imposes sentence.
Otherwise, there wouldn’t be much reason for the
disparity in some of the sentences that are imposed.

With

the sentencing power in the federal courts, certainly the
aggravating circumstances of a particular crime or a set of
circumstances will cause a federal district judge to impose a
larger sentence or even to probate and we say that just
because a judge comes down hard on a defendant at the time he
imposes a. sentence is not a predisposition of hostility,
particularly when we claim that the bias or claim bias
throughout this 15-volume record is just absolutely not
present and that is absolutely what we feel about it.
Let me address myself, if I may, just for a
moment —- excuse me, sir — if I may, to this proposition that
whenever a summary contempt occurs, that the trial judge must
recuse himself and allow it to be heard by another judge.
Let’s take a very practical question and
Mr. Justice Marshall alluded to it in a question to Mr. Sedler

35
when he asked which court would hear this?
Let's take Father Groppi’s case

in Michigan,

where the people were led through the legislature and let’s
assume that the Michigan General Assembly was in joint
session, the Senate and the House.

They cite Father Groppi

for contempt.
Mow, the fact that they saw this or they heard
this, which legislative body is going to try that contempt?
Let’s assume that if a trial judge is going to
have to ecuse himself in other cases, let’s see now who is
going to do that.

Is it going to be his brother trial

judge in the same district or the same circuit or the same
state?

Must it go outside the state?

Is it going to occur

as it occurred in Cauda-Speidi case which I understand is
going to be heard here next week?

Cauda-Speidi got his

second judge and what he said to the second judge is about
as bad as what he said — excuse me, sir,
QUESTION;

In the Groppi case, that liras Wisconsin,

not Michigan.
MR. TRIPLETT:

Yes, sir.

Excuse me, I’m sorry,

Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION;

In the Groppi case, I think the

opinion indicated rather clearly that had they seized him
immediately and proceeded with contempt, there might have
been a different result.

It was because Groppi went away

36
and then without notice to him —
MR. TRIPLETT:

He was in jail for disorderly

conduct and two days later, without the present hearing,
notice or papers, they imposed the punishment.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. TRIPLETT:
Justice.

That is exactly right, Mr. Chief

But would the bias or the disqualification be any

less because Father Groppi led the group past the Wisconsin
Legislature, you see, than the contempt occurring before a
trial judge?
We think not and we think that this displays some
fallacy in the proposition that they must be heard by
another judge or by some other form and perhaps that can be
dealt with in this case.
We think that the most important fact, and the
most Important protection of a judge and of a lawyer involved
In a criminal contempt case is that it appears on the trans­
cript.

There Is a record that an appellate court can view and

this is somewhat followed by — stated by the Weiss-Burr case
out in the Ninth Circuit, that when these things appear on
the record, this prevents a judge without any court reporter,
without any witnesses, must do It in public, prevents any
abuse in that respect.
Bringing my argument to an end, here, we think
that for a two-week period and including the ultimate part

37
here, Judge Hayes did a pretty good job In this trial.

If he

had imposed the punishments on Taylor at the time of contempts
heard — were heard — he could claim a psychological dis­
advantage to hurt his client.
If he didn't cite him for contempt and did
nothing, then there would be claim that he discreetly
searched the record after all this occurred.
What he did was at the time they occurred, was to
cite him, permit him to be heard in practically all instances
and then at the end of the trial, he imposed the punishments
that he thought proper and then he corrected them, as the
Petitioner has conceded, he had a right to do.
We think that it is highly necessary for the
Integrity of the judiciary which protects the freedom of us
all, that this judgment be affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. Triplett.
You have a few minutes left, Mr. Sedler.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT ALLEN SEDLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP PETITIONER
MR, SEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I think I ought to comment on two points.
Mr. Triplett says that the Petitioner had the right to
respond.

The record, of course, to which Mr, Triplett

38
refers, shows that this simply was not so.
More importantly, what we are in agreement on is
that there was no hearing insofar as the Petitioner had a
chance to respond.

It was only on counts 2 and 3.

response was strictly for the record and it

The

occurred at a

time when the Petitioner was required to argue substantive
questions to protect the interests of his client.

At least,

the Court should hold that due process requires a hearing in
the sense that the

summary contempt that the summary

contempt, if this Court is going to allow it go go on, be
separated from the other events in the case, that the trial
judge specify the charge, xvhich never occurred here.

He

didn’t specify the charges until three months later — specify
the charges, listen objectively to argument, the matters in
defense for mitigation, and then make a ruling.
With respect to the matter of embroilment, what
the Respondent says is, ignore my remarks at the time of
sentencing.

But there is no comment about everything else

that occurred during and after the trial.
Of course, it is a burden to prove embroilment.
Here, the Respondent was not very subtle.

He says to the

Petitioner before the jury, I am going to make an example of
you.

I am going to do something the Bar Association should

have done years ago.
It is true that there were no epithets hurled at

39
the judge by the Petitioners but it was just the reverse.
When the Petitioner argued, "I may have four or five months
of my life tied up in this case/'the judge said acidly,
"Before it is over, you might have a lot more than that,
provoking, all the time, you are putting on a show, I don't
like your antics."
Then he said, "You have accused me of rigging
the jury."

All of this occurs very early and throughout

the trial and then there is the axe of the judge where he
says, "You can't practice in my court any more."
refused to hold a bail hearing.

He

He refused to admit the

Petitioner to bail.
Now, if this does not show embroilment, then
what I think the Court must be saying is that there is no
such concept of being embroiled in controversy, but it does
raise the question of the — what I call the Inherent
unfairness of the exercise of the summary contempt power.
This case does present both narrow and broad
issues.

The Petitioner has not only argued his own case and

has not limited himself to the narrow issue that would
result in a reversal of the Petitioner’s conviction.
The Petitioner believes that the issues
presented in this case go far beyond the present Petitioner
and the present Respondent and have deep implications for
the administration of justice Itself.

40

Petitioner would ask this

Court to reverse his

conviction.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Thank you, your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen,

the case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:45 o'clock a.m., the case
was submitted.]
