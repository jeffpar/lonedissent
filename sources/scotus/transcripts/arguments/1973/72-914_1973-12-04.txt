P R O C E E DINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

lext in 72-914, Scheuer against Rhodes.
Mr. Geltner, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. GELTNER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GELTNER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, this case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
Jnited States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.
The plaintiff's decedent, Sandra Scheuer, was killed
by a National Guardsman's bullet on the Kent State University
campus in 1970.

Therafter the the plaintiff filed action in

Pederal Court alleging the deprivation of civil rights under
section 1903, section(1) of the Civil Rights Act of 1871,
specifically detailing the alleged conduct and misconduct of
,ne defendants charged.
The defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that while
the action was in form against the defendants individually, in
fact it affected the State of Ohio, therefore suit against tne
State of Ohio and barred by the 11th Amendment.
Appeal ifas taken to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit, and in a divided opinion a panel of the
circuit affirmed, again on the 11th Amendment ground.

Judge

Vhite in writing his majority opinion went beyond the 11th
Amendment ground and concluded that he reached the same result

4
under the doctrine of executive immunity which he held covered
the field in actions arising under the Civil Rights Act.
So we are here without a record.

We are here with

a complaint and] motions, and here on a theory which has hereto­
fore not been applied to actions charging individuals with
misconduct under the Civil Rights Act or against any other
jurisdictional basis which would otherwise lodge jurisdiction
in the court.
As to the first issue, the 11th Amendment sovereign
immunity issue, so-called,, the nominative issue is mentioned
in my brief.

It has been our position throughout the

litigation that this ground was repudiated long ago? it’s
inconsistent with our basic notions of federalism.

That the 14th

Amendment can be made to coexist with the 11th Amendment only
insofar as the doctrine of ex parte Young is and remains viable*
and. the doctrine of ex parte Young applies a fortiori in a case
in which, the plaintiff seeks damages against an individual
T.i.id charges the individual with misconduct.
QUESTION!

The petitioner here is an Ohio resident?

MR. GELTNERs
QUESTIONs

Yes, your Honor.

You make no point of the applicability

of the 11th Amendment in the case.
MR. GELTNERj

I understand your Honor’s dissenting

opinion in the Employees of the Department of Mental Health in
the Grate of Missouri v. the Department of Missouri.

I certainly

am willing to take advantage of that position.

I don't think

it's necessary to reach out to that proposition to decide this
case on that issue.

In point of fact, this Court has never

suggested that an action against an individual, an individual,
or here individuals, who are governmental officers which doesn't
seek in any way to get at the State Treasury or at public
property, is an action which falls under the 11th Amendment,
Therefore, I didn't feel it was necessary to reach out for the
proposition in your opinion, your Honor,
The Missouri case which is the most recent decision
of the Court on point, it seems to me, pins down quite clearly
that there has been no expression of sentiment in this Court
for the proposition that the 11th Amendment could conceivably
reach a case such as this one.

The majority opinion of Justice

Douglas makes it quite clear that if the Congress under
section 5 of the 14th Amendment were to attempt to lodge
jurisdiction even against the State if it were acting validly
within a grant, of legislative power, could do so.

Justice

Marshall's opinion for himself and Justice Stewart specifically
exempts actions against individual officers from the thrust of
his opinion which is that the 11th Amendment is a jurisdictional
limitation, in effect, a gloss on Article III.
So it is quite clear to me that what the Court of
Appeals and what the District Court did was simply express
its hostility to the plaintiff's view of the case by going out

6

on a grounded decision which is totally unsupported by the
precedents of this Court.
So we get to what I believe is the heart of the case,
and that is the question of whether or not an executive
immunity, so-called, or sometimes called a governmental or
official immunity attaches in suits arising under section

1

of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, specifically whether or not
i government official can say, "I am immune from suit, and
iherefore, although the plaintiff has charged me specifically
vith a deprivation of

a

constitutionally protected right,

nevertheless, because of one's position, one may not be sued,"
The precise issue has not been adjudicated before in
this Court.

We have Barr v% Matteo, which is a defamation case,

arising under the law of the District of Columbia in which the
Court framed what I view as a Federal common law defense to a
State

tort

action.

Barr v, Ha11eo, for reasons summarized

,i our brief, does not really cover the ground here.
lave a libel action here.

We don't

X expressed some doubt as to whether

:r not the same result would be reached in Barr v. Matteo

on

the basis of the law of defamation as it now stands after the
Court's opinions leading up to Rosenbloom.
pretty clear that Barr v. Matteo

And I think it's

does not cover this case.

The only expression of judicial opinion in this Court
of significance on the immunity question here is Justice
Harlan's concurring opinion in the Bivens case.

If you may

7
remember, the Bivens ease presented both the question of
whether or not there was a cause of action arising under the
4th Amendment and likewise the question of whether or not the
defendants were immune from suit assuming there was a cause of
action.

Justice Brennan's opinion for the majority did not

reach that second question because the Court of Appeals had not
reached it.

Justice Harlan noted at the end of his long

concurring opinion that it was not appropriate or necessary
for him to decide the question, but he believed it was
appropriate to venture the opinion that for the most flagrant
examples of governmental abuse of power, there would certainly
be a right to redress.

That is essentially the basis of the

claim asserted by the plaintiff in this case.
The issue has been spoken to by many courts of appeals.
By and large the courts of appeals have distinguished actions
arising under the Civil Rights Act from State tort actions,
have noted, as did

Justice Harlan, that a deprivation of a

constitutional right is significantly more serious than a tort
arising under State law.

For that reason they concluded that

irrespective of the State rule of immunity which might be
applicable, it was clear to those courts that there was no
such executive immunity under the Civil Rights Act,
This conclusion, it seems to me, is the appropriate
one.

It certainly fits the intention of the Congress.

The

Congress of 1871 perceived the problem before it as essentially

8

a problem of violence and saw the problem that was sought to be
reached by both sections

1

and

2

of that Act as governmental

and nongovernmental violence, the nongovernmental violence
being essentially covered by section

2

of the Act which is

presently section 1985, and the governmental violence being
covered primarily by section

1’ of the Act, that is, this

is an appropriate case fitting within the precise legislative
intention of the Congress.

The Congress' intention was recently

summarized for the Court in Justice Brennan's opinion in
District of Columbia v. Carter.

It certainly supports that

conclusion that that is what Congress was concerned with.
QUESTION:

Moyer v. Peabody, cited in your brief, I

take it you think there is not much left of that.
MR. GELTNER:

We discussed Moyer v. Peabody at some

length in our brief.
QUESTION:

It must be in your reply brief.

MR, GELTNER;
QUESTION:

It is discussed, I believe ~~
Well, don't trouble yourself.

I didn't

find it in your index.
MR. GELTNER:
long briefs.

There are two briefs, two relatively

There is a main brief and a reply brief.

We see Moyer v. Peabody, first of all, as being
substantially limited by the Court's opinion in Starling v.
Constantin.

Secondly, to the extent that Moyer v. Peabody

makes an expression that the Governor

of a State can do

9

whatever the Governor

- of a State believes it is appropriate

to do, is overruled by Sterling v. Constantin, and furthermore
fundamentally inconsistent with the thrust of this Court's
decisions preceding it as specifically inconsistent with
Ex parte Milligan, which was decided the year Congress passed
the statute.

The sole question that seeras as to the legislative

intention is what that Congress intended.

It is inconceivable

that that Congress with its viewpoint could have intended an
immunity of this kind for a State Governor in view of the fact
that State law enforcement was primarily what the Congress was
attempting to reach with both sesctions

1

and

2 .

So we get the prevailing history and it is pretty
clear that unlike the legislative history, legislative immunity,
which was recognized in 1871 both by the Federal Constitution
and by parallel State constitutions, and unlike the longstanding
doctrine of judicial immunity, there is no substantial support
for the view of executive immunity at the time this Congress
acted.

Congress simply must have seen it as an appropriate

purpose to reach governmental misuse of force, and there is no
basis to believe from the debates that Congress intended to
carve out any individuals as immune from the reach of its
legislative power.
QUESTIONt

In one of those three cases, Strauder,

wasn't that a judge involved in that case, wasn't it, Ex parte
Strauder.

HR. GELTNER:
QUESTION;

Hasn’t it one of them?

MR. GELTNER:
QUESTION:

Kx parte Virginia?

Yes, your honor, Ex parte Virginia.

The judge was involved.

MR. GBLTNERs

Well, we distinguish, clearly judicial

immunity here from executive immunity.

As I mention in my

brief, the legislative history, to my mind, does not even
sepport judicial immunity.
Jourt and Bradley v. Fisner

We've got
at

Pierson in this

that time to cope with.

Tnis

Is clearly a different issue.
Now, it is in fact true that many States now have a
doctrine of executive immunity for State courts and similar
actions.

It's likewise true that this Court has recognized

such an immunity in Barr v. Matteo with respect to a parallel
_ssue, namely, State libel actions involving Federal officials.
Uney don't cover this issue.

And, secondly, to the extent

that there is an implication in any of these opinions that it
is appropriate to distinguish for punitive purposes between
mini terial officials and so-called officials exercising
discretionary functions* we

believe that any such distinction

is basically inconsistent with the purpose of the Civil Rights
Act and inconsistent with logic.
There is, for example, in the remand opinion of the
Second Circuit in the Bivens case a suggestion that while the
particular parties before the court, their Federal narcotics

11

agents,were not immune,

possibly the Director of the Federal

narcotics Bureau or somebody else who made basically discretional'
decisions would be immune from suit.
Now, the distinction has never been applied in Civil
Rights Act cases.

In tox't cases the distinction has always

been the distinction based upon the immunability of lower level
officials to mandamus where there is a positive declaration by
law that they must do an act.

So, for example, a court clerk

might be subject to mandamus to compel the court clerk to give
a copy of a document to somebody.

Similarly, those courts

have said refusing to engage in an act which could be compelled
oy mandamus could be a basis for liability.

But those courts

have also said a discretionary act, that is one not subject to
mandamus, might be immune from suit.
Now, to hold that as to the Civil Rights Act Seems
anomalous.

You might, for example, have a situation in which

a semi-police official orders a policeman to engage in an
unco istitufcional act and a situation in which the person who
commits the act who had no basic decision-making powers xs left
holding the bag while the officer who made the decision to
engage in the constitutional deprivation is in fact immune.
That seems senseless in view of the fact that it was clearly
the purpose of the Congress to reach both.
In addition, there doesn't seem any sensible basis to
close the doors of the court with respect to that sort of an act.

12

Tae distinction between ministerial and discretionary acts,
when one clearly looks at it, breaks down.

In fact, at all

levels of government when we are dealing with the question of
use of governmental force discretion is exercised.

So that

at both levels the concept of a ministerial discretionary
distinction breaks down as being basically inconsistent with
the policy sought to be served by the Congress.
So what we are left with then is the bare frame that
if officials are subject to suit, it will be troublesome for
them.

They are too important to be called into court, they

will have to spend time, they will have to spend money, they
might be intimidated.

That seems to me that here the Congress

has declared a specific policy, tne purpose of which is to
prevent certain kinds of wrong, is precisely then that the
intimidation should attach.

And, in fact, tne threat of

liability is the way in whicn Congress attempted to acuieve
its results in 1871 of preventing the misuse of governmental
force on individuals.
Your Honor, I have requested that I reserve 10 minutes,
and I believe my 20 minutes are up.

So if there are no more

questions now, I would like to reserve rebuttal time,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Geltner.

Hr. Brown.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF

CHARLES E. BROUN ON

BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13
MR. BROWN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court, the issues in this case are such as to go to the very
heart of federalism.

They go to the very delicate balance

between our form of government.

And the issue is:

Can Federal

courts control the administration of State law.
I respectfully disagree with Mr. GoItner as to cue
issue of jurisdiction.

In our judgment that is a very important

issue in this case.
QUESTION:

That is the 11th Amendment issue?

MR. BROWN;

Yes, your Honor,

The court below, that is the District Court;, at the
time we filed our motion to dismiss under the 11th Amendment,
and as this Court 'well knows the 11th Amendment applies not only
to suits by citizens of one State against another State, but
by the citizens of a State against its own State, which is the
case here at bar.

At the time we filed our motion to dismiss,

there was pending before the district judge an affidavit of
General Del Corso that he was not at the scene, an affidavit of
General Canterbury that, he gave no order for anyone to fire,
and: there was the executive proclamation of Governor Rhodes that
a riotous condition, insurrection, if you will, existed in the
city of

Kent

and the Kent State University area.

Pursuant to that the National Guard was called out.
Now, at this point under Ohio statute, the members of the Ohio
National

Guard had no choice.

They, of course, had to go.

14
They were ordered to go.
It is important to note, and I would like to point out
to tiie Court that before this Court today we do not have the
issue of the Ohio National Guard.

There are seven named

defendants, and those are the only people before the Court today
and not the entire Ohio National Buard.
Now, under the 11th Amendment, 12(b)(1) motion to
dismiss which goes to the question of jurisdiction, and, of
course, as this Court well knows, the 12(b)(5) motion goes to
the question of whether a cause of action is stated, the Court
has consistently held that to determine whether or not a suit
is in fact against the State, you look behind the nominal
parties defendant named and look at what is the essential nature
and effect of the lawsuit.
Now, tills test was set out by this Court in the Ford
case.

Dugan v. Rank, which is a 1963 decision from tiiis Court,

defines when a State is affected, and if in fact a State is
affected, then you look behind anomalous parties defendant and
determine that it is a suit against the sovereign.

In Dugas v.

Rank this Court stated that if the judgment sought would expend
itself on tiie public treasury or domain or interfere with the
public administration, or if the effect of the judgment would
be to restrain the government from acting or to compel it to
act, then the act is considered to be one against the State.
Now, we submit here that the seven named defendants

15

are nominal parties only and that this action is in fact one
against the State of Ohio.
Nov, the case of Barr —
QUESTION;

Any more so than in the Starling case

against —
MR. BROWN;

The Sterling case is distinguishable.

That is an injunction action, your Honor, to enforce an
unconstitutional statute.

Now, we don’t have that situation

here.
QUESTION;

I know, but the claim at the outset was

that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit, and
this Court ruled that the Federal courts did have jurisdiction
to entertain the suit, that tnere was no bar, the suit against
the Governor was not a suit against the State»
MR, BROWN;
you.

Your Honor, I respectfully disagree with

I don't believe tne Court said that.

I think what the

Court said, because you have an unconstitutional statute you
don't have the State acting, therefore, it isn't the State
acting.

The State cannot enforce an unconstitutional statute.

As I read the decision I think that is what you said.
QUESTION;

As long

you think the Federal court in

this case would have jurisdiction

if there is an allegation

that the defendants violated constitutional rights .
MR. BROWN;

No.

If we were acti-ing under an

unconstitutional statute, your Honor.

There is a difference, if

16

I may say, between stating a cause of action and jurisdiction,
I am not to the stating a cause of action.
QUESTION:

That is the distinction you assert.

MR, BROWN:
in my opinion.

Yes, sir.

There is a definite distinction

And I am saying here that if the seven named

defendants were acting under a constitutional warrant at the
time, and there is no allegation or challenge to the contrary
by the petitioners, and if they were acting within the delegation
of

that statutory warrant, then they are agents of the sovereign

and the action may not be maintained.

There is no jurisdiction,

And as I pointed out a minute ago, your Honor, I will get to
the cause of action discussion later as it relates to the
doctrine of executive immunity.
But this Court in Barr in quoting from Gregoire
adopted Judge Hand's reasoning and logic to the effect tiiat
if actions are permitted to be maintained against State
officials, then you will have times when a State official will
abuse his power, there will go unredressed some wrongs, but
you. must weigh the equities, which is more important.
a pragmatic, a public policy argument, if you will.

This is
And, for

example, to illustrate that point, as Mr„ Chief Justice
mentioned a moment ago, in Moyer v. Peabody we had the question
of calling out the National Buard.
decision in that case.

Justice Holmes wrote the

This Court held that the calling out

of tiie National Guard was not reviewable, and Justice Holmes

17

stated, "As no one would deny that there was immunity for
ordering a company to fire upon a mob in insurrection, and that
a state law authorizing the governor to deprive citizens of life
under such circumstances was consistent with the 14th Amendment,
we are of opinion that the same is true of a law authorizing
by implication what was done in this case."
And in that particular case perhaps a man was
unconstitutionally deprived of his liberty? he was put in jail
for I think two and a half months.

But this Court held that

the discretion of the executive branch of a State government
in calling out the National Guard is his discretion.
QUESTION:
MR. BROWN:
QUESTIONs

That wasn't an 11th Amendment case, was it?
No, it was not, your Honor.
I thought we were talking about the 11th

Amendment, or have you moved on to the —
MR. BROWN:

Now, the petitioners on the 11th Amendment

argument rely on Sterling, Ex parte Young, those kind of cases,
all of which are distinguishable in our opinion because we are
talking about unconstitutional statutes.

And. in Sterling,

before the governor called out the Guard, the Federal court had
already enjoined the matter.

So he was flying right in the face

of an order of a Federal court at that time.
The Larson case applied the 11th Amendment immunity,
the agents of the sovereign were immune even if their actions
at the time were ultra vires.

18

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

I think we will pick

up at that point after lunch.
(Whereupon, at 12 noon, a luncheon recess was
taken.)

19

AFTERMCOH SESSION
(1:00 p.m.)
MR.

ailEP

JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Brown, you may

proceed whenever you are ready,
MR. DROWN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please file

Court, in going further on my jurisdictional argument as to
whether the court below under rule 12(b)(1) had jurisdiction,
I would like to point out that contrary to what ray eminent
opponent stated, Sterling v. Constantin did not in fact overrule
Moyer.

It cited it with approval, it stated they were dealing

with a different situation, the taking of property.
Moving on now to the effect test,that is,if the nature of
a lawsuit, even though naming nominal parties defendant, in
facts affects State government, then it is an action against
the State.

And this court in Dugan v. Rank which was a 1963

decision stilted the test.

The general rule is that a suit

is against the sovereign if the judgment sought would extend
itself on the public treasury, domain, or interfere with the
administration of justice,

if the effect of the judgment would

be to restrain government from acting or compel it to act.
Now, that is exactly what we are talking about here.
Granted, the Dugan case is a Federal Government case, but
which is more important, constitutionally granted rights to the
State, that is the 11th Amendment, or the common law interpreta­
tion of the immunity of the Federal Government?

20
Along that same line, as this Court well knows, in
Barr v. Ilatteo they quoted with approval Judge Learned Hand
in Gregoire v. Biddle, and I would like to quote a part of
Judge Hand's opinion.

"Again and again the public interest

calls for action which may turn out to be founded on a mistake,
in the face of which an official may later find himself hard
put to it to satisfy a jury of his good faith....the answer
must be found in a balance between the evils inevitable in
eithe r a1tern ative."
"In this instance, it has been thought in the end
better to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest
officers than to subject those who try to do their duty to
the constant dread of retalliation."
I submit to the Court that is exactly the situation
with which we are here confronted.

What would be the effect

on State officials in every State of the Union if Federal
court were to be granted jurisdiction in this kind of a situation?
Any vituperative, vindictive plaintiff wanting to vent his
spleen on a State official could file a lawsuit.

You could

literally tie up State governments, just mimeograph tnousands
of lawsuits against all kinds of people and tie up State
governments.

That is exactly how it could be affected.

QUESTION;

Judge Hand's comment in the Gregoire case

was not in the context of 1983.
MR. BROWN;

No, your Honor, it was not, but the same

21

reasoning would apply, it seems to me,
QUESTION;
MR. BROWN;

And that is also true of Barr v. Mateo.
Yes, that is true.

Yes, sir.

Let's just take a specific example of a National
Guardsman in any State in the Union called to active duty to
quell riots, insurrection, what have you.

If he knew that in

the performance of his duties as he was commanded to do by
tne Governor of the State of Ohio and his commanding officers
that he could be sued, would he diligently carry out his duties?
This is a very pragmatic policy consideration.

Should officials,

all State officials, be free to carry out their duties
unhindered and unhampered, or should they live in constant fear
of being sued?
We feel, as did Judge Hand, that they must be free
to carry out their duties.

Now, query;

Does that leave people

without a remedy if you have a dishonest official or somebody
acting vindictively?

It does not because they are still subject

to the electoral process and they can be recalled from office.
In conclusion, therefore, on the 12(b)(1) motion on
jurisdiction, we clearly feel the courts below were correct in
their interpretation of that matter and the 11th Amendment, and
further that the only material before the court when considering
the motions were affidavits which I previously mentioned which
incidentally were in the Krause case
but they are in effect companion

and not the Scheuer case,

cases.

And the court also

22

took judicial notice of the facts as they exited at Kent State
on this tragic day.

And I am sure this Court is well aware of

Judge Connell's concurring opinion in that regard in the Sixth
Circuit.
Going on now to the question of sovereign immunity,
first of all, 1933 says, as the Court well knows, all persons
who violate someone's rights are subject to suit, et cetera.
And yet this Court has held in

Pierson v. Ray, a 1969 decision,

that judges acting within their scope as judges are i; ,mune
under 1983 for acts within their discretion.

In the Tenney

case which is a 1950 case, this very Court held legislators
immune while doing things within their discretion.
Now, it seems to me in Congress that the people that
pass'

the laws and tiie people that interpret the laws have

immunity when the very person designated by the Constitution of
the United States and the constitutions of the respective
States would not have immunity to carry out the very laws that
the legislature imposes and the judiciary interprets.

I would

respectfully submit the petitioners are in error when they
state that executive immunity was unknown, prior to 1871
enactment of 1983, and we cite in our brief two cases, both
preceding 1983, Kendall v. Stokes and Wilkes v. Dinsman, an
1845 case and an 1849 case.

So executive immunity did, in

fact, exist.
And another point I think worthy of comment, our laws

23

as they were traditionally adopted in this country were a
carryover,, of course, from the common law of England, which has
known immunity for seme period of time.
Do we have executive immunity now?

In our judgment

the answer is clearly yes,

Barr v„ Matteo which once again

quotes Gregiore v. Bi ddle»

And as I previously stated Moyer v.

Peabody, the court there held that certainly the discretionary
act of the Governor in calling out the Guard was within his
power and right.
Now, we go on to the diversity matters in applying
the wrongful death, diversity
QUESTION;

Mr» Brown, could I inquire a moment?

Let's

assume that it is alleged that the State officials ■— this is
with respect to immunity.

It is alleged that the State

officials acted deliberately and knowingly to violate a
constitutional right in the sense that they intended to deprive
somebody of a constitutional right.

And let's assume that

it's proved and everybody can see that they knew they were
and they did it deliberately.

Would you still insist on

immunity?
MR, BROWN;

Probably not if they could prove all of

the things which your Honor has in fact stated.
QUESTION;

Well, would you say you would submit those

kinds of allegations to proof or not?
MR, BROWN;

Not the allegations, your Honor.

A court

is bound to determine the facts in the first instance as they
really exist, as they truly exist, and the court may do whatever
it wants —
QUESTION:

I understand that, but would you permit

a court to see if a plaintiff could prove those kinds of
allegations against a State official?
MR. BROWN;

Not normally, your Honor, unless there

were some evidence before the Court, concrete evidence, other
than sheer allegations and sheer conclusions of law and
unwarranted deductions of fact, not unless there was something.
QUESTION:

I know, but here is a complaint, let’s

assume, that says that the official has deliberately and
knowingly deprived a person, and intentionally has deprived
a person of his constitutional rights.

That is the allegation

and they want an opportunity to prove it.

Now, would your

claim of immunity stop that suit in its tracks before it ever
got started?
MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:

If in fact that were true, your Honor, no.
Well, I am saying all you have is the

allegation in a complaint.
MR. BROWN;

I would say that standing alone is

insufficient, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Well, then you would say dismiss the case

without any opportunity to prove it.
MR. BROWN:

Depending on the facts as they really

existed,if I were the Federal court —
QUESTION:
MR, BROWN:

Well, how do you know the facts existed?
Because some well-pleaded facts I think

the court should take note —QUESTION:

Well, let's assume that they are well-

pleaded facts.
MR. BROWN:

On that mere allegation I would dismiss

the complaint with nothing further before me, yes.
QUESTION:

So you would say that you would insist on

immunity even though it is alleged and somebody stands ready
to prove "™

attempting to make.

The court may call a preliminary hearing

and look into the facts.
QUESTION:
MR. BROWN;

This is the distinction I am

In the rare instance

Your immunity claim would not stop.
No.

Well, for example, let’s take a

gross situation where, let's say, two highway patrolmen stop
a drunk driver, summarily try

him and shoot him.

Certainly

I am not claiming in that situation that you would have immunity
I'm not.
QUESTION:

Here you are in effect reading in the

allegations of bad faith out of the complaint.
MR. BROWN:

I sun saying the court below properly

looked into the facts as they existed.

That is what I am saying

your Honor, yes.

And I would point out that the petitioners

did not even ask for a preliminary hearing.

The only evidence

before the court were the facts that we had before it plus the
judicial notice of the facts as they took —
QUESTION:

I don’t suppose you would suggest that

the State officials would be immune from criminal prosecution
under a Federal criminal lav;.
MR. BROWN;

I would not, your Honor.

I would not say

that.
QUESTION;

What about 242 that speaks of conspiracy

to deprive people of their constitutional rights?
MR. BROWN;

Are you talking about a criminal prosecution

there?
QUESTION;
MR. BROWN;

Yes,
I would say they would not be immune

to criminal prosecution,
QUESTION;

And if the same allegations were made in

a civil suit, that would have to be proved to prove a criminal
violation?
MR. BROWN;
QUESTION;

Yes„
Would you say that the immunity Would

apply there in a civil suit?
MR. BROWN;
QUESTION;
MR. BROWN;

In a criminal situation?
In a civil suit.
In a civil suit.

Just because it was

27
a criminal act?
QUESTIONS

No, just because the very same allegations

in the civil action are made

the State would have to prove

in tne criminal case, that the government would have to prove
in the criminal case,to succeed, you say there would be no
immunity in the criminal suit but there would be in the;civil.
MR, BROWN:

That’s right, your Honor.

That is the

position I take.
QUESTION s
MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:

That would apply to the Federal statute?
Yes, sir, in my opinion.
They both were enacted at the same time,

weren’t they?
MR. BROWN:

I believe they were, I am not positive

on that, your Honor.
QUESTION5

What justification do you have for taking

the criminal and not the civil?
MR. BROWN:

Pragmatic public policy considerations

to have public officials carry out their duties unfettered for
fear of a bunch of lawsuits.
QUESTIONs

Then you are telling me that Congress meant

to apply this criminally but not civilly, is that what you are
saying?
MR, BROWN:

Well, there are two different statutes

you are talking about, your Honor,
QUESTION:

You are passing the same batch of statutes.

28

MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:

Well, your Honor, of course -You are telling me the Congress said that

you are criminally liable but not civilly liable.
MR. BROWN:

Yes, sir, that is exactly what I am saying.

QUESTION:

And what in the world do you have to back

QUESTION:

I suppose one difference would be that

that up?

anyone can start any kind of a frivolous lawsuit but to get an
indictment, you have got to go through a grand jury.

One of

the historic purposes of a grand jury was to be a buffer against
frivolous, irresponsible charges, is that not so?
MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
Is that in the debate?

Of course, it’s

not.
MR. BROWN;

Ho, sir.

And neither is judicial immunity

in the debate, your Honor, or legislative immunity.

This is

court interpretations.
QUESTION:

Well, you would now interpret tiiis statute,

the 1871 statute.
MR. BROWN:

I am asking — this Court is going to

interpret it as it has in the past, your Honor, absolutely.
And they have applied it in certain situations.
QUESTION;

You want us to say that this man can go

to jail, but. he can't be subject to an injunction.
MR, BROWN:

We are talking about damages in this action,

2S

your Honor, and I am saying —
QUESTION:

Well, you say he can go to jail for five

years, but he can't be sued for $2 damages.
MR. BROWN:

Yes, sir, your Honor, I am saying that

lour! and clear, not based upon unwarranted conclusions of law
and unwarranted deductions of fact.

I am saying that.

Briefly, your Honors, as my time is running out, on
the diversity issue, there we clearly apply the lav/ of the form
Erie v. Tompkins, and there are a long line of Ohio cases cited
in our brief dealing with

the question, of executive

immunity with officials of State governments in doing their
discretionary acts.
Moving on briefly to the issue of justiciability,
whether or not the training and weaponry of the Ohio National
Guard is a justiciable matter which this Court should consider,
this Court set forth the guidelines in
elements.

Baker v.

Carr, six

This case,we feel, clearly falls into those.

This

Court recently heard the case of Gilligan v. Morgan involving
the very issue of whether or not this was a justiciable question
or a political question.

They decided that it was hot, that

the judiciary should not get involved in these matters, and we
feel that was a proper decision.

I see no distinction to be

made between an injunction, which was the Gilligan case, and
an ex post facto damage action which is what we have here.
Finally, your Honors, if the political question is

30

overruled, the Federal Government who sets up the standards
for training the National Guard and Congress who is given the
responsibility under the Constitution, the Federal Government
certainly would be an indispensable party in that regard*
In conclusion, therefore, we feel that the court
below considering Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6), properly
applying those rules to the issues of jurisdiction and executive
immunity, properly dismissed petitioner's complaint.
If the Court has no further questions —
QUItS TI ON:

Mr. Brown, I suppose your position does

undercut somewhat anyway section 1983, doesn't it, to the
extent you are asking for —
MR. BROWN:

Sir, in response to that I would say

this Court has applied 1983 to two classic cases, tiie Birnbaum
case and Ex parte Virginia, both involving civil rights
violations, one involving a Jewish gentleman and the other
involving a judge who refused to let black people sit on his
jury.

So those are classic situations for the application of

1983.

But extending it to abolish executive immunity, it seems

to me, is not proper.
QUESTION:

Moyer v. Peabody was under the Civil

Rights Act, was it not?
MR, BROWN;

This was the Governor of Colorado calling

out the National Guard.

No.

That was before the Civil Rights Act.

where Holmes said no one would doubt the Guard would have the
right to fire into a mob at time of insurrection.
QUESTION:

You are not suggesting that Ex parte Young

I am saying that if the elected public officials of this country
cannot constitutionally carry out their duties under the proper
statutory warrants, there will be a flood of lawsuits.

Now, if

they are acting outside of either of those two, and if they do
something wrong, clearly they are subject to lawsuit or

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Geltner.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. GELTNER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You agree that Moyer was

old 1979, present 1983, wasn't it?
MR. GELTNER;

Yes, Moyer was.

Your Honor, if I could mention

tne thing about

Moyer is Moyer was a case in which the Governor of Colorado
concluded that there was an insurrection.

As a consequence of

this conclusion that there was an insurrection, he imprisoned
the plaintiff, and the plaintiff brought an action charging
a deprivation of his constitutional right.
Nov;, the thing about Moyer, Moyer holds that the
Governor's decision of insurrection is unreviewable.

That part

35

of Moyer was clearly overruled by Sterling v. Constantin.

The

dictum in Justice Holmes’ opinion in Moyer to tne effect that
the Governor could do more than imprison, it seems to mo is
completely out of consonance with our traditions.

The concept

is basically that in an insurrection, which we did not have
here, in an insurrection the Governor can do whatever ne pleases
to put down the insurrection.

In fact, in Ex parte .Milligan

the Court held that there was only one thing that an insurrection
or rebellion changed and that was it permitted the writ of
habeas corpus to be suspended during the continuation of the
insurrection.

We don't have either of those issues here.

We

don't have an insurrection,; we don't have here the question of
whether or not the writ was properly suspended.
QUESTION:

It seems to me that would go to Whether or

a
not/complaint would state a cause of action rather than immunity.
MR. GELTNER
QUESTION;

Absolutely,

your Honor.

And wasn't there immunity talk in Moyer?

MR. GELTNER:

I view that talk as being basically

connected with the court's decision on the cause of action.
That is all that X see there.

And I think that the opinion

bears it out.
QUESTION:

Do you think the expressions that the

action of the Governor in Colorado calling out the Guard was an
unreviewabie action was a dictum by Justice Holmes?
MR. GELTNER:

No, I think that was the holding of the

36

case.

That aspect of the ease was specifically ovearruied by

Chief Justice Hughes' opinion in Sterling v. Constantin, the
specific holding of the unreviewability of the determination of
the existence of insurrection.

So what we are left with as

to Mover is the dictum that Justice Holmes issued.

I read that

dictum as being related to the power of the Governor to do
whatever the Governor feels —
QUESTION:

If that’s the way you read it, the case

has nothing to do with immunity.
MR. GELTMER:

Yes, your Honor, that's exactly the

way I read it.
QUESTION:

So that it doesn't make any difference

what Constantin did to it.
MR, GELTNER: Yes, your Honor, I read it taat way.
I read both cases as having no bearing on immunity but having
bearing on the cause of action.
QUESTION:

Mr, Geltner, is it essential to your

position that bad faith be proved?
MR, GELTNER;
QUESTION;

No, your Honor.

What would have to be proved?

MR. GELTNER:

Our position is that we rely for our

substantive theory — again going to the cause of action
rather than immunity issue

we rely on Monroe v, Pape, and

the few expressions in dictum in tills Court's opinions in
D. C. v. Carter and in Moor v, Alameda County, specific intention

37
to cause injury or to deprive one of a constitutional right
is a prerequisite to establishing criminal liability under
18 U.S. Code, section 241, which is the criminal analog of
section 1983.

In Monroe the Court specifically dealt with the

distinction and how that specific intention is not necessary;
rather, section 1983 was to be interpreted in line with the
intention of Congress to reach governmental misuse of force
and with the pre-existing body of tort lav/ which founded liability
on fault.

So that the only question that relates to the viability

of the cause of action is whether or not we have alleged and
proved fault on the part of the individual defendants, which
fault led to the deprivation of a constitutional right.
QUESTION:

You are using "fault" in the same sense

as the word "negligence" is used?
MR, GELTNER:

I am using "fault" in the sense of either

wrongful intention, recklessness, wanton and willful misconduct,
or negligence.
QUESTION:

Mere negligence.

MR* GELTNER:

Mere negligence.

Now, as to mere

negligence, this Court has not passed directly on that issue.
The weight of authority in the circuit courts is that mere
negligence when tied to a deprivation of a constitutional right,
for example, negligence leading to a misuse of weapons by
governmental troops, states a column (?)

under section 1983.

And in my brief I have cited the cases on which we rely for that

38

proposition.

I believe Monroe supports us.

QUESTION:

I was going to ask whether you read Judge

Celebrezze's dissent that way.
MR. GELTNER;

There again Judge Celebrezze’s dissent

didnH'.' have to reach out for the question of the cause of

we have no record before us, what we allege.

alleged wanton and willful misconduct.

We believe at this

We can't prove

QUESTION;

Do you consider a showing of negligence

meeting the standards you have just suggested if the evidence
was that the Governor had signed the proclamation for calling
out tiie Guard or signed the order on the basis of newspaper
accounts as to what was happening down in some southern county
in the State?

That is not the basis for liability in

We have alleged with great specificity what we

which existed, at the time in the Ohio National Guard, which
the Governor knew about, specifically the orders to carry loaded
weapons, the orders to march head on with bayonets out into a

These are matters of record as a consequence of

Gilligan v. Morgan, and we rely on that.

We do not rely on the

QUESTIONS

I don't remember whether it was Justice

QUESTION?

Mr. Geltner, what constitutional right is

it that you claim your client was deprived of?
MR. GELTNER:

Well, we are claiming that the

Constitution protects one from being killed or injured by tne
use of governmental force without due process of law, and by
due process of law we simply mean a hearing.

T’o the extent

that tiie governments can injure one or can kill one, it can
only do so insofar as it acts legitimately in defense of
appropriate interests or it does so through the criminal
process.

40

QUESTION:

Do you rely on any of our cases for that?

We rely

in District of Columbia v. Carter, and we rely on a long line
of Circuit Court opinions which reach the conclusion that tiie

cited in my reply brief, which explores the area most carefully

We

re3.y upon that case and the cases it cites.
Now, if I could, we have heard a lot in this case
about the facts.

It has been my feeling all along as expressed

by the opinion of the courts below that somehow they read the
newspapers and took judicial notice of the conclusion that
everything the Guard did was proper and that there was
insurrection or something close to it.

The fact of the matter

is there are no affidavits in this case, there are no such facts.
The affidavits Were filed in the Krause case.
not been consolidated.

These cases have

What we have here is a complaint.

And the newspapers and the opinions that the judges garnered
from the newspapers below doesn't seem to me to have any bearing

41

on the way in which tae precise legal issues ought to be
decided here.

To the extent that there is any document in

existence which has any bearing on the facts of the case, it is
the Scranton Commission report which is not in tne record.

It

is the only document of which under the rules of evidence this
Court can take judicial notice,

I do not propose the Scranton

Commission report as a finding of fact.

But if the Court feels

some necessity to go beyond the pleadings, it is the only
finding of the governmental agency which has dealt with the
subject matter.
Now, we have been hearing throughout the case the
view that this immunity is necessary because in the absence of
immunity, the courts are going to be flooded with complaints,
these complaints are all going to be frivolous, and as a result
of all of these frivolous complaints, the government is going to
stop, people are just going to stop acting.
It is not an inscription of this case a member of the
bar of a Federal district court should not be presumed to be
filing frivolous paper.

He signs -- rule XI requires the

complaint to be signed.

He is subject to disbarment if he

files frivolous complaints.

And, finally, the argument when

you analyze it closely comes down to tne old argument if you
permit this kind of suit, the courts are going to be flooded.
That is precisely the argument that was made in the Bivens'
case

42
QUESTION;
about the courts,

I didn't understand Mr. Brown to be worried
I understood him to be concerned about

Governors or mayors or individuals, including judges, who would
have to take time off, among other things, from their duties to
defend the suit and in a state of apprehension as they approached
the decisional process.

MR» GELTNERs

I understand the distinction.

But

underlying it is the view that the courts will be flooded by
complaints of this kind, which flooding will then result in
loss of judicial time, loss of attorneys' time, loss of
official time and intimidation.

In substance it’s the same

argument made in the Bivens case.

It's the same argument that

Congress has made that finding of fact.
these issues and the Congress acted.

The Congress considered

And at this point the

Court, in order to reverse the congressional decision, would in
effect be making a legislative act in the face of another
legislative act without any empirical basis to support it.
So I think all those theories are just untenable as
a basis for either the 11th Amendment ground or the executive
immunity ground.
Thank you, your Honors.

The case is submitted.
