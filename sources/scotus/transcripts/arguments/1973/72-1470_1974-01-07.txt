HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear

arguments next in No. 72-1470, Bob Jones University against
George P. ShuIta, Secretary of the Treasury, et al.
Mr. Todd, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. D. TODD., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TODD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
We are here , of course, on certiorari to the
Fourth Court of Appeals.

We represent Bob Jones University,

which is a unique university.
most unusual university."

It has a slogan, ".World*s

I think it can safely he said

that that is true.
'

y.

It is a university which has deep religious
background, deep religious roots.
opened and closed with prayer.

Its every class Is

The university admissions

policy requires an examination into the religious beliefs
of those who apply and who are admitted.
One of the religious beliefs of the university
is that the Scriptures prohibit the intermarriage of the
races and that it would be Scrlpturally wrong for members of
different races to marry.
Based upon that religious belief, which has been

4
its belief since the commencement of the university in 1927,
I believe, it has refused admission to blacks.
It has admitted a few orientals under a rule that
those who are admitted cannot date members of other races
while at the university.

The university feels that at the

college level is when most romantic attachments are formed
between parties and when their

life partners are frequently

chosen.
For that reason, it has adhered to the policy
that no blacks are admitted to the university.
Mow, certainly, since 1942, the university has
been an exempt organization under the provisions of- 50103.
It has met all the requirements of 501C3 as set forth by
Congress.

Those requirements are, briefly, that the

organization be one whose chief activity is religious,
educational or charitable, that its operations inure to the

substantial lobbying activities.
There has never been any question but that Bob
Jones University met all of those requirements.
In the letter from the Collector in 1943 — or
542 — it was stated that it was entitled to a tax exempt
status and that such tax exempt status would continue unless
there was some change in the operations of the university.
There has been no change in the —

o

What, was the situation between 1927, the date

of its founding, and 1942 — was it?
MR. TODD:
Q

Yes, sir.

The date of the letter?

MR. TODD:

We are sure they had tax exempt status

from the founding, but we have not been able to trace that
out.

We have — the first and only thing that we find in

the records of the university is the 1942 letter from the
District Collector of Internal Revenue at the time.

It

operated in the same manner from its inception until 1942
and 1942 was no different from any other year.

We just don’t

have any proof that were recognized as exempt by- the Inter­
nal Revenue Service prior to 1942.
Q

When did this practice of issuing letters

such as these begin in the Department, if they are not
authorized or recognized by any statute that I know of.
MR. TODD:
Q

The exact time when it v?as?

Yes.

MR. TODD:

Again, I do not know.

Of' course,

501C.3 was — has a history of about 62 years or so.
Q

Yes.

MR. TODD:

And — but when the advance letters or

assurance of acceptability was instituted, I cannot say.
has been a practice for many, years, certainly since 1942
and when an organization receives such a letter, it is

It

entitled to be listed in the Cumulative Index of such
organizations»
Q

Well, even before it receives such a letter,

that is, just as you suggested it, it probably — you say It
had been operating exactly the same way, or certainly was
operating exactly the same way, with the same policies, from
1927 up through 19*42 and beyond.

So, presumably, even with­

out a letter, it was entitled to exactly the same tax
treatment prior to 19*42.
MR. TODD:

Wasn’t it?

I think that is true and I think it

did receive such treatment.
Q

That is, and its benefactors also had their

gifts deductible from their ordinary income for tax purposes,
prior to 19*42.
MR. TODD:
Q

I think that is true, yes, sir.

I take it that you agree that the practice of

issuing the letter is beneficial to the recipients of these
contributions?
MR. TODD:

No question about it.

benefit and a privilege.

I understand that.

It is of great
It is a thing

that an organization -—
Q

Well, the importance is, I suppose, that it

clears the air and removes any doubt on the part of donors?
MR. TODD:
Q

That is exactly what it does.

So a wealthy donor will ask his lawyer, will

7
this be deductible?

And it is a very simple matter for the

lawyer to find out, now.
MR. TODD:

That is very true, and while the

individual donors don't, perhaps, get too much, certainly,
foundations do because if they make one contribution to an
unauthorized or unexempt organization, their deductibility
would be withdrawn, or probably would be withdrawn.

So it is

of vital importance to foundations and such organizations as
that,
Our .record shows correspondence between us and
the Nationwide Foundation in the insurance company in Ohio
where they had been making matching grants and where they,
in view of the questionable status of the university, refused
to make any more matching grants.
Q

It’s not the letter — the listing of the

letter in this list.
MR. TODD:
Q

Isn't that right?
That is correct, sir.

That’s correct.

And you can get on the list without the

letter?
MR. TODD:

Oh, yes.

Well, I think that is right.

I don't think you can get on the list without the letter.
Yes, sir.
Q

If you are on the list, then that is of some

benefit.
MR. TODD:

Yes, sir, it is of inestimable benefit

to an organization which is a nonprofit organization which
can exist only through donations of those who are impelled
to give to that organisation.

There, of course, is no

requirement that anyone give to an exempt organization.

It

is a matter of personal preference and. choice for each
person that happens to give.
Q

This whole practice, however, is extra­

curricular, extrastatutory, is it not?
MR. TODD:
Q

I think that is correct, yes, sir.

And as far as the law goes, a donation is

deductible from a donor’s taxable income if the donee meets
certain statutory requirements, period, regardless of any
letters or any lists.
MR. TODD:

Yes, that is correct, sir,

That

would be true.
Q
this case?

Now, what if there had been no letter in

Would you be entitled to go into a court and

ask for an injunction and have a letter issued to you?
MR. TODD:

If there had been no letter, if there

had been no Cumulative Index Listing I think -- no, I think
not.
Q

Why not?

You’d be in the same position you

are now because you wouldn’t be on the list.
MR. TODD:
Q

Well —

You say being on the list is the essential

9
qualification for you to maintain a viable existence as
Bob Jones University.
MR. TODD:

That is correct.

Being on the list

is of vital importance because donors presumably — well,
actually, we know they won't give if we are not.
Q
letter.

All right, so then I am assuming you had no

Therefore, were not on the list and you are

operating just as you have operated since 1927 and right up
through 19^2.

Would you be entitled, in your view, to go

into a federal court and ask for an injunction, mandatory
injunction requiring the Commissioner to issue you a letter
that you were tax exempt?
MR. TODD:
Q

And if not, why not?

Well —

Because if

not, you’d be in the same state

you are now, or you wouldn’t be on the list.
MR. TODD:

If —• if we asked for a mandatory

injunction, the defense of soverign immunity might apply,
which it doesn’t in this case because we asked for no
affirmative relief against any office of the United States.
We asked merely for an injunction.
That is the only difference that occurs to me.
That is a defense that the government pleased in this case
and advanced in the district letter but now concedes as
inapplicable to this particular case, the Doctrine of
Sovereign Immunity.

10
Q

Mr. Toddj as a matter of curiosity, does

Bob Jones* University still have its exempt status?

Has its

ruling ever been withdrawn?
MR. TODD:
Q

No, sir, it has not been ^withdrawn.

Despite the lower court8s order?

MR. TODD:

That's right, sir.

Court, of course, issued the injunction.
Appeals reversed.

The District
The Court of

But the advance assurance of the

deductibility has not been withdrawn.
Q

Mot because of the stay outstanding?

MR. TODD:

No, sir, there was no stay outstanding.

We applied for a stay and the court did not see fit to
grant it.
Q
your exemption.

But the service simply hasn’t withdrawn
Is that it?

MR. TODD:

I think that is right.

I think that

is right.
Q

Is your status in jeopardy in the interim,

so you are not assured of their deductions?
MR. TODD:

Well, our deductions — our contri­

butions have fallen off some.
had dried up.

I would not say that they

As long as we have that assurance, that

advance assurance, they have not dried up and we have not
suffered the irreparable harm that we would have suffered
had not the District Court originally granted the injunction.

11
Q

Is the advance assurance a regulation by the

Commissioner?
MR. TODD:

It is a practice by the Commissioner

and there is no statutory justification for it, as I under­
stand it.
Q

So you are certainly in as good a position

as you would be if there had been no — never had been any
letter, aren’t you?
The fact is, you are in a better position
because as of now, you are still on the so-called list.
MR. TODD:

Yes, on the so-called "list ."

Yes, sir.

I don’t think we would have been on the so-called "list,'1 had
we not had the letter to start with.
Q

No, apparently not, but if you hadn’t had the

letter, you’d be in just as bad a position — a xvorse
position than you are now, from the point of view of
attracting the beneficience of supporters and benefactors.
0,

Except that the Internal Revenue Service,

by revoking or purporting to revoke your clearance, has, in
advance, announced that it doesn’t think that your organiza­
tion qualifies.
MR. TODD:
Q

That is correct, sir, and —

And so that any people who were thinking

about giving money to you know they are going to have a fight
on their hands.

12

MR, TODD:

That's correct and, while, as I said

a few moments ago, the individual donors, the small individual
donors, I don’t think that
it does make a lot of

would make a lot of difference.,

difference to foundations.

I think

that is where the real damage came as a result of the
announcement by the IRS that it would be withdrawn.
Q

It is sort of like one litigant having

litigated with the IRS and lost; one donor has litigated his
tax return as lost.

Other possible donors are going to be

put off a little,
MR. TODD:

I think that is correct, yess sir.

I

think other possible donors would approach it with caution
and I think the donors that have given in the interim are
people who were firmly motivated to give and who were not
altogether swayed by the deductibility of their contributions.
But as I say, donations and contributions have
been much less free as they were before.
Q

Now

You mentioned foundations a couple of times.

Do I understand — and I think I have understood —- if a
gift is made by a foundation to an institution that does not
qualify, then the tax status of the foundation itself might
come into question or be altered.
MR. TODD:
Q

Is that it?

It would come into question.

Unlike an individual donor.

MR. TODD:

That is correct, sir.

That is correct.

13
That is a point of vital importance that a foundation not
give any gift to anyone whose eligibility -—
Q

Doesn't qualify.

MR. TODD:

— under 501C3 is in doubt.

At any rate, this announcement from the IRS to
the effect that the IRS could no longer grant advance
assurance of deductibility to schools who practised a
racially-diseriminator-y policy, no matter why they had that
policy, resulted in this law suit.
There was no act of Congress that added that
provision to 501C3 as one of the conditions for an exempt
organization.
Congress had very specifically set forth what
was necessary to be an exempt organisation and that didn’t
happen to be one of the requirements that was set forth.
At any rate, in the trial contention and the
lower court held that the Commissioner exceeded his statutory
authority given him, that he has authority to promulgate
regulations, but not to change laws and that that is a matter
for Congress to decide and we, of course, contend that that
is absolutely correct.
Nov/, it is our — we must concede that Bob Jones
University has a remedy at law.

Bob Jones University, if its

exempt status is destroyed, will be in a position where it
will have to pay not only unemployment taxes, but income taxes

14
as vie 11 and. we —
Q

Income taxes on what?

MR. TODD:

On the income from operating the

university, sir.
Q

I see, tuitions,

MR. TODD:

Yes.

Q

If you make

Q

Yes.

MR. TODD:

you mean?

Yes.

aprofit.

Well

I think it is one of the

university's —■
Q

That is pretty hard to do, isn’t it?

MR. TODD:

Yes, sir.

This university, as I said,

is one of the world’s most unusual universities and it has
made a profit which has been plowed back into plant and other
Q

You mean, after actually — after depreciation

MR. TODD:

No, not bothering about depreciation.

no.
Q

I didn't think they had.

MR. TODD:

They haven’t bothered about

depreciation.
Q

Well, haven't you made some reference

somewhere along here that your income taxes would be very
substantial?
MR. TODD:
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

And do you know that, in view of what you

15

have just said about not using depreciation and the like?
MR. TODD:
with

depreciation?

We have been exempt, so why bother
Bookkeeping procedures have not — the

auditors have not bothered with depreciation at all because
depreciation is —
Q

I know, but you say your income taxes

"would be substantial."
MR. TODD:
Q

Yes, sir.

If you had to go about filing an income tax

return, you certainly are going to start taking account of
depreciation.
MR. TODD:

No question about that and, perhaps.,

they would not be as substantial as we think, but we would
still have to pay them and that —
Q
besides tuition?

Well, of what does your income consist
Certainly not your donations; your

contributions are not income.
MR. TODD:

Tuition, room and board, the operation

of the Student Center and those things where they sell drinks
and — soft drinks, I might add.
[Laughter. ]
MR. TODD:
Q

To the students and faculty.

And the athletic program?

MR. TODD:
intermural athletics.

Not interscholastics.
They have —

They do have

16
Q

But nothing that earns money in a stadium

or anything?
MR. TODD:
Q

No, no, sir.

Well, I suppose you have — it would be

very unusual if you didn't have investments on which you had
income.
MR. TODD:
Q

Well, I —

Any private institution of learning that I

that I am familiar with has.

They never have enough, but

they have a good deal.
MR. TODD:

They do have.

They do have investments

which they have realized income from.
Q

Certainly.

MR. TODD:
Q

At any rate —

But, obvious3.y, it is an institution, as a

corporate entity, organized not for profit.
MR. TODD:
about that.

Is that not so?

I don’t think there is any question

The record so says and I don't think that there

is ever any question but what it is an organization operated
not for anyone's individual profit.

It inures to the profit

of no individual.
The university's beliefs have caused it some
detriment.

It could not conscientiously sign a certificate

of compliance under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and, there­
fore, It voluntarily has foregone all grants of any kind or

nature.

It received no grants of any kind or nature from the

Federal Government, any branch of the Federal Government or
any branch of the State Government.

It absolutely goes It on

its own, with its own operation and. its own donors.

It has

no gifts or grants of any kind -Q

Do you have a large student body?

MR. TODD:
Q

What is the size of the student body?

MR. TODD:
Q

Sir?

3,500 and a faculty of about 650.

And all undergraduates?

MR. TODD:

No graduate school?

Yes, no graduate degree, all under­

graduates .
Q

Mr. Todd, assuming you didn't have the pro­

cedure of the letter and the listing and IRS issued a public
statement that from now on you were not allowed deduction for
contributions to Bob Jones University.
MR. TODD:

What could you do?

That, substantially is what this case

is, your Honor, except that we have the letter and we have
the —
Q

Would you ask for an injunction?

MR. TODD:
Q

Yes, sir.

Against what?

MR, TODD:

Against the withdrawal of the

exempt status of Bob Jones University.
Q

The withdrawal of the tax exemption, tax

13
deduction, rather, to the contributor.
that ran

You wouldn’t think

parallel to the injunction statute?
MR. TODD:
Q

Why not ?

MR. TODD:
Q

No, sir, I wouldn't think so.

Because —

It involves collection of taxes.

MR. TODD:

As the District Court said in this

case, it involved taxes only very remotely.
Q

I!m not talking about this case.

I am

talking about my hypothetical case.
MR. TODD:
Q

Yes, sir.

Wouldn't that be barred by the injunction

statute?
MR. TODD:

Under the literal terms of the

injunction statute, any case involving —
Q

Oh, you agree that would be clearly a tax

case?
MR. TODD:

I agree that it would be barred by the

anti-injunction statute with no court rule, which is -Q

Now, you get to my next question, which is,

what is the difference between that and this?
MR. TODD:

The difference in that and this is

that the university —
Q
any listing.

In '27 didn't have any letter and didn't have

MR. TODD:
Q

Yes.

In ?ii2s had a letter and had listing.

now has no letter and no listing.

And

Now, that is different from

my hypothetical in what fashion?
MR. TODD:

For one thing, prospective donors with­

out the letter and without the listing, would not be
inclined to donate.
Q

I think that is the big difference.

I am talking about as to the anti-injunction

statute.
MR. TODD:

As to the anti-injunction statute, I

don’t suppose there is too much difference in the two
situations except — except that without the letter and
without the advance assurance of deductibility, we would
have been paying taxes and our donors would not have been
entitled to deductions from their income.
At any rate, if we read the terms of the antiinjunction statute
is no exception.
exceptions.

literally, there is no exception.

There

This Court has recognized that there are

It created exceptions in the Hill case, Kill

against Wallace .

It created exceptions in Miller against

Standard Nut Margarine.

And it created an exception in

Enochs against Williams Packing.
Nov;, the government suggests that if the rule in
Enochs against Williams Packing

is to be changed, then it

should be by the legislature rather than by court.

2.0

I respectfully invite the Court's attention to the
fact that the rule, Enochs against Williams Packing, is not a
legislative rule.

It is a court-originated rule.

It is a

rule that the legislature had nothing to do with, but the
Court, in its Inherent power to do justice between the
government and the citizens, evolved the rule in Enoch
against Williams.
Q

So really, then, it seems to me, not the

letter or the list that you are concerned about, but what the
letter and the list represent.
list are merely declarative.

That Is, the letter and the
One is a private communication

and the other is a public communication, stating what is the
legal ruling of IRS.
MR. TODD:

That, in effect, is correct, but we

have —
Q

But it is the ruling that you are concerned

about, isn’t it?
MR. TODD:

That is right.

That is right.

The

ruling is what we are vitally concerned about, plus the
publication of that news.

If the ruling is made in a

vacuum and not publicized, if the donors, don't know about
the ruling and and we can’t get it to them in any effective
way, then, of course, we are concerned about it.
Q

We are -~

You said earlier that the ruling — the

publication and the letter are beneficial.

If they are

21
beneficial, I suppose you mean or meant to say they are
beneficial if they have the right content.
MR. TODD:

Well — well, that's right, and the

ruling issued to us does have the right contents and vje are
listed in the Cumulative Index, or the list of exempt
organizations.
the university.

We are listed there and it is of benefit to
The position of the university really is

that the rule in Enoch against Williams Packing has no real
application to exempt organizations.

As was pointed out in

one of the previous arguments, the anti-injunction statute
was passed in 1867, long before we had any question about
exempt organizations, charitable deductions or income tax,
for that matter.
Q

And —
There has been no hesitation in applying the

anti-injunction statute to income taxes,

even though income

taxes were —
MR. TODD:

No

question about that, your Honor.

It does apply to income taxes and it does apply to exempt
organizations as the IRS attempts to enforce it. but we think
that as far as exempt organizations are concerned, whose
source of revenue can be dried up by a mere

withdrawing

of that advance assurance of deductibility, who can face ruin
as the Mlcah brief in the Americans United case pointed, out
and it is a matter that Mr. Thower, who was Commissioner at
the time,

made a speech in Dallas that said, "We understand

22
and realise that our mere refusal to rule on an application
can doom an organization," that under those circumstances —
under those circumstances a different rule than the one
applied in Williams Packing should be adopted.
Williams Packing

Obviously,

goes a long ways to protect the Internal

Revenue Service and the receipt of the government revenues
and obviously —
Q

The statute went that far in the district,

didn't it?
MR. TODD:
that far.

Oh, that’s right.

The statute went

It went farther, I think.
Q

It went even farther, didn't it?

MR. TODD:
Q
the statute?

That's right, it certainly did, sir.

Well, so what -- you ar’e asking us to repeal
Is that it?

MR. TODD:

No, sir.

No, sir.

I am asking the

Court to exercise inherent jurisdiction of the Court to
fashion a remedy that would be fair and applicable to the
Internal Revenue Service and to the charitable or exempt
organizations.
Q

Your fundamental aim is to keep your letter

in force so that the Internal Revenue Service, according to
its usual practice, would be forbidden or at least would
refrain from collecting taxes from your donors?
MR. TODD:

That is correct, sir.

23
Q

And. so the heart of the ease is whether the

Internal Revenue Service should or shouldn’t be permitted to
collect

taxes from your donors, based on their gifts?
MR. TODD:

That is correct,

your Honor, and I

don’t think that involves a question of assessment of a
collection of a tax against Bob Jones University, as is
apparent from the record in this case.

Bob Jones University

can pay every tax that the government intends to assess and
collect against it by purely and simply abandoning its
religious convictions and changing its admissions policy.
The record is clear from the deposition of Mr. Connett, the
assistant collector of Internal Revenue In charge of exempt
organizations, to the effect that if Bob Jones University
changes its admissions policy we would not revoke its
advanced assurance of deductibility.
So, really, we are not talking, in my opinion,
we are not talking about taxes.

We are talking about, as

Mr. Craiapton remarked in a previous case, "Some people try
to use the Internal Revenue Service as a club against those
that they don’t like or with whom they have differences.
We are attempting to keep the

Internal Revenue

Service from using the club of withdrawing our advanced
assurance of deductibility to adopt an admissions policy
which is not dictated by any act of Congress, an admissions
policy which is contrary to the firm and publicly stated and

publicly stated and long-held religious beliefs of the
university.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Todd, you are down

to four minutes now, so if you want to save some rebuttal
time, you may do that.
MR. TODD:

All right, sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Crampton.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT P. CRAMPTON, ASST. ATTY..GENERAL
MR. CRAMPTON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court —
Q

Is there any real difference In these two

cases, Mr. Crampton?
MR. CRAMPTON:

No, I think that the fundamental

procedure issue is the same and I think that this case
perhaps even more strongly emphasizes the need for the
application of the injunction.
Q

This involves C4 as well as C3?

MR. CRAMPTON:
Q

Or in the other one, either?

MR. CRAMPTON:
under 501C4.

No, C4 is not in this case.

Yes.

The other one was exempt

This one is not exempt under 501C4.
Q

I see.

MR. CRAMPTON:

And the question is whether it is

exempt from the 501C3.
Q

Well, it looks like this organization Is not

exempt under either, your claim is.
MR. CRAMPTOM:

That is our position.

position the Commissioner probably would take.

That is the
I’d say there

were certain administrative steps that were still to be
explored, but the injunction stopped all that.
Q

Yes.

MR. CRAMPTOM:
Q

But —

So this institution, the Commissioner would

probably hold, was itself taxable —
MR. CRAMPTON:
Q

That's

right.

— on its own net income, unlike the previous

case.
MR. CRAMPTOM:
like to make here.

Right, and that is the point I’d

I am somewhat shocked, as I think

Mr. Justice White indicated, that this taxi iyer was not only
making money, the accountant that handled its records for
some 2b years has filed here in an affidavit saying that
this corporation would owe $750,000 in tax for one year and
$500,000 in tax for another year, simply income tax and the
purpose of this act is to stop the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue from attempting to assess that.

And I say, this

comes in squarely under the tax payer's trying to stop the
assessment of tax and

the Williams Packing case, the

exceptions in the Williams Packing Case do not apply here and
it seems to rne that there is no Question but what there is a

26

chance here of the Commissioner• s prevailing, so that that
possibility would not —
Q

Mr. Crampton?

MR. CRAMPTON:
Q

Yes.

When did this letter business start?

Do you

know?
MR. CRAMPTON:

I'm not sure, either.

We were

looking at it when you first asked the question.
Q

Did you find out?

MR. CRAMPTON:

No, I didn't find it, but I did

find that we have cited in the briefs an historical review of
this ruling process.

It is In one of the New York

University Institute tax institutes in an article that was
prepared by former Commissioner of Internal Revenue Mortimer
Kaplan and I don’t have that with me, but I think that will
answer.

My recollection is that it must go back into the

20’s anyway.
Q

Do you still have the one-year waiting period

for for a new non-profit corporation?
MR. CRAMPTON:
statute awhile back.

I believe that was changed by

You can come in and make a preliminary

showing of what you plan to do and then as I recall, you come
in with a sort of a follow-up situation and say we did do it.
Q

But this is true, you still don’t go on the

list for a year, as I recall.

At least, that was the case

27
at one time, when I was trying to prosecute.
MR. CRAMPTON:

That used to be the ease.

not sure whether that is true any more.

I am

I didn't think it

had.
I wanted to answer a question that was asked
before about whether or not this injunction had been revoked.
It has not.

The District Court entered the injunction and

when it went to the Court of Appeals, there was an application
for a stay after the Court of Appeals handed down its opinion.
That was denied and then when the matter got back to the
District Court, petition for certiorari had been filed and it
was the position of the District Court that it no longer had
jurisdiction and, therefore, as it stands now, if the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue attempted to do anything,
he would run the risk of being in contempt of court.
Q

That is why the action was withdrawn?

Is

that it?
MR. CRAMPTON:

That is it, yes.

It hasn't been

and so these folks have been having an advantage for three
years that this has been pending of being able to remain on
the list and get the benefit of the tax-exempt dollars from
the donors.
Q

You said if the Commissioner attempted to do

anything, he would be — run the risk of being in contempt
of court.

Well, that's a little bit broad.

28
MR. CRAMPTON:

Well, I mean contrary to the

Injunction order.
Q

What is the injunction order?

Is it in the

Appendix?
In other words, could you attempt to disallow a
deduction for a taxpayer who had made a gift in some previous
year to Bob Jones University without being in contempt?
MR. CRAMPTON:

Oh, not for a previous year,

because they’ve been on the list and under that list, any
donor could look to that list and that is his license, so to
speak, to make a contribution.
Q

That is correct.

Q

That is practice, but it is not —

MR. CRAMPTON:

That is practice.

Well, I think the Internal

Revenue Service has sort of held off.
Q

Do you think that is estoppel?

MR. CRAMPTON:

I would think

so.

I would think

it would be very poor tax administration for us —Q

We11, that isn't what I asked you, whether

is legally permissable.

it

I thought it was just — would it

be legally permissable forthem to go back and attempt to
litigate a deduction for a prior year that a donor had taken?
MR. CRAMPTON:

After they had, in effect, held

out to the donor that if he relied on that —Q

This was with respoect to an organization on

29
the Ust •
MR. CRAMPTON:

I think estoppel would apply there.

There would be reliance on an act to the detriment of the —
now, whether estoppel goes against the government, you get
into a different — perhaps a, into a different set of rules.
Q

There are cases that say it doe3 not, are

there not?
MR. CRAMPTON:

Yes, there are and that is why 1

can't -—
Q

And, certainly, the service has been known to

change its mind.
MR. CRAMPTON:

Yes, but I don't think you have

found the service changing its mind with respect to rulings
when they have been made and under such circumstances, the
taxpayers were entitled to rely on them.

That is, the

service has issued rulings, we'll say, to taxpayer A and when
taxpayer B comes in, they've said, no, we've changed our
mind but they still will not go back and assess the
deficiency against taxpayer A, who may have acted in
reliance on that ruling under, maybe, a corporate
reorganization or something of that nature.
Q

To get specific, suppose a taxpayer asserts

a deduction that he made to Bob Jones University in 1973, in
a '73 return yet to be filed?
Court of Appeals ruling.

This took place since the

I take it, then, the service feels

30
It cannot challenge that deduction because the university is
still on the list?
MR. CRAMPTON:

That would be ray position and I --

Q

Well, I was just looking at the injunction.

Q

Where is it?

Q

On page A-128.

"You are hereby enjoined

pendente lite from revoking or threatening to revoke the tax
exempt status of plaintiff and further enjoined pendente lite
from withdrawing advanced assurance deductibility of
contributions solely because of the admissions policy of
plaintiff pending a final hearing and determination of this
cause on the merits," and you have the feeling, at least, or­
are operating on the impression that that injunction is still
extant against the service.
MR. CRAMPTON:
Q

Is that it?
Yes.

And why is that?

It was reversed in the

Court of Appeals.
MR. CRAMPTON:

Yes, and they came to this Court

for a stay and I believe Mr. Justice Burger denied the stay.
It went back to the — Mr. Chief Justice Burger — and it
went back to the lower court and by that time it was in the
Supreme Court on a petition of certiorari and the District
Court said, "I feel I no longer have jurisdiction," so he
refused to revoke the order which he had entered.
Q

Well, there isn't any injunction outstanding,

31
is there?
MR. CRAMPTON:
Q

Well, that — what?

Was the Court of Appeals’ reversal held as

an injunction?
MR. CRAMPTON:
Q

Well —

An unstayed reversal?

MR. CRAMPTON:

— this is the position the

District Court took.
Q

Did the ending ever come down from the

Fourth Circuit?
MR. CRAMPTON:
Q

I believe it did but —

Well, I would think the District Court perhaps

was out —
MR. CRAMPTON:

It was out of its jurisdiction.

Q

jurisdiction but it is within the

— of Its

jurisdiction of another court that reversed it.
MR. CRAMPTON:

Well, anyway, as a practical

matter we haven’t — the Commissioner has not done anything
and —
Q

Whether or not you

MR. CRAMPTON:
Q

can, you haven’t.

We haven’t,

So, if nothing else. It is at least a matter

of deference to the importance of the problem that is pending
in the courts.
MR. CRAMPTON:

That is right and that Is why we

32

are here hoping that this Court will give us some guidance
that we can use and I'll say we have had a multitude of these
cases coming along.

We feel the proper role of this

injunction procedure is a very Important one In the
administration of the tax laws and we think that the remedy
here is legislation and it Is not allowance of injunctions
because I think we are —• as I've indicated earlier, this
will only lead to chaos.
I think I have covered the point.

I owe the

Court time for review now.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have about three

minutes more, Mr. Todd.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF
J. D. TODD, JR., ESQ.,
MR. TODD:

I don’t believe there is any question

but what the IRS can apply the loss of deductibility
retroactively.

They don’t have to do it, but I believe they

have the authority to do it.

g,

I beliye the courts have so

held in many cases and the IRS has done it on occasion.
We feel that even if Williams Packing is the law,
even if it applies to exempt organizations, that we come
within Williams Packing.

The District Court and the Court

of Appeals both held that we had irreparable Injury, that
we would lose deductions which we could never recover and —
Q

Well, you can't -- quite apart from any

33
statute, you — there can’t even be an injunction unless
there is an irreparable injury.
MR. TODD:
Q

That's right.

I mean, if that were the only test, why,

there wouldn’t need to be any statute because that is a wellknown and well-settled, equitable doctrine.
MR. TODD:

Mo question about that.

addition, we feel that we meet the other test.

But in
We do not

believe that the government can prevail, ultimately, in this
case.

And our feeling for that is because the action of the

IRS, in effect, is an attempt to place a tax upon the
exercise of a religious belief.

It Is an exaction upon

religious belief which we feel runs absolutely contrary to
Sherbert against Verner, which runs contrary to Murdock
against Pennsylvania, which runs contrary to —
Q

It may be doing this as an establishment.

MR. TODD:
establishment.
Q

Well, sir, I don’t believe we are an

I don’t believe that the tax-exempt status put
Well, it is a substantial benefit the

government is conferring on it, isn't it?
MR. TODD:

Well, sir, I believe this Court

said it was an action of benevolent neutrality and to say it
is not a substantial —
Q

It’s a property tax.

MR. TODD:

Sir?

34
Q

That was property tax.

Q

That was an exemption.

MR. TODD:

Yes, sirs, but the opinion also

discusses income tax and says it is in the same category and
I'll admit that the amount involved would be considerably
different as far as Income tax and property tax is concerned,
but it is still a question of benevolent neutrality in Wals
case, we think, and it is an attempt to tax the exercise of
a religious belief which we feel Is in violation of the
First Amendment of the Constitution

and the government

cannot, ultimately, prevail on the merits.

If we prevail on

the merits and our deductibility has been withdravm for
two or three years, we have lost all the donations that we
would have gotten during that period of time, a very
serious matter as far as we are concerned.
Q

Who is the — and this is pure curiosity —

who was the — who is or was the Bob Jones after whom this
university was named?
MR. TODD:

Well, the original Bob Jones was the

founder of the university.
three or four years ago.

He died at the age of some-85
His son. Bob Jones, Junior, was the

President of the university until his father’s death and at
his father’s death, his son, Bob Jones the III Is the
President of the University.
Q

Named after the founder, in other words.

MR. TODD:
Q

Named after the founder, yes,

sir.

How long has it been in existence, now,

altogether?
MR. TODD:
Q

Since about 1927» I believe, sir.

Since 1927.

MR. TODD:

That’s what you said.

Yes, sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Todd.

Thank you, Mr. Crampton.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:49 o’clock p.m., the case was
submitted.]
