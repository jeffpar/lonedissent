MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Ho. 73-482, Michigan v. Tucker.
Mr. Patterson', you may proceed when you are
/

ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF L. BROOKS PATTERSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. PATTERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
My name is Brooks Patterson.

I am the prose­

cuting attorney of OaklandCounty in Michigan, representing
the people of the State of Michigan In this appeal,
Before stating the facts, there are four dates
I would like to stress because they have a bearing on the
facts of this case.
Chronologically they are the date of the Escobedo
decision in June of 1964.

Secondly, the date of the offense

in this particular case, April 19th, 1966.

Third, the date

of the Miranda decision, June the 13th, 1966 and, finally,
the date of the commencement of trial of the Tucker case,
October 18th, 1966.
The facts of the case:

On April 19th, 1966, it

is undisputed that Marion Corey was brutally beaten and
raped in her home where she lived by herself,

.She was

beaten so badly that she was never able to remember, nor did

4
she recall at the time she testified, or make any
identification of the Defendant as her assailant.

She was

discovered in her home by a coworker who summoned the police.
This coworker also noticed inside her home, a dog and since
Ms. Corey did not own a pet, he brought this to the attention
of the police.

The police followed this dog to the

residence of the Defendant, Thomas William Tucker.
After making inquiries with the neighbors about
the ownership of that particular dog, the police put out a
broadcast to pick up the Defendant and later that day he
was arrested and brought to the police station.
Before any interrogation of the Defendant, he
was advised of his rights as delineated at that time by the
Escobedo decision.

Specifically, he was advised of his

right to remain silent, that anything he said would be used
against him at court of law and that he had a right to an
attorney.
He was not advised, however, that he had a right
to a court-appointed attorney but that right was yet to be
mandated in the Miranda decision, two months hence.
During the interrogation that followed, the
Defendant said that he had obtained the —
QUESTION:

Was he told that he had a right to

have a lawyer then and there?
MR, PATTERSON:

No.

He had a right to an

5

attorney, but not in those specific

words "then and there."

During the interrogation, the Defendant told the
police that he had obtained the noticeable scratches on his
face from the flailings of a goose that he had killed and
this would also account for the blood on his clothing.

He

said that all of this could be confirmed by one Robert
Henderson, who he was with at the time of the alleged rape
and thereby creating an alibi.
Later, the next day, in an effort to confirm that
alibi the police sought out and talked to one Robert
Henderson, who not only failed to corroborate the story told
by the Defendant, Tucker, but actually gave testimony or
statejnent that refuted Tucker's claim.
Henderson indicated to the police that, indeed,
he did have a conversation with the Defendant on April the 19th,
1966 and that he had asked the Defendant how it cane that he
had these scratches on his face and whether he had gotten
ahold of a wild one or something, to which the

Defendant

Tucker had replied, "Something like that," and then, moments
later, added she was a widow woman in her 30's who lived the
next block over.
The case went to trial several months later on
October 18th, 1966.
QUESTION:

In the City of Pontiac?

MR. PATTERSON:

This was a Sheriff's Department

r

U

case in Pontiac Township, just outside the City of Pontiac.
On October 18th, it went to trial and because of
the intervening decision of Miranda, none of the statements
made by Defendant Tucker were introduced into evidence.
However, Henderson was called as a prosecution witness and
did testify.
The Defendant was convicted by a jury trial and
sentenced to a prison term of 20 to ^0 years in view of his
record.

Both the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan

Supreme Court affirmed that conviction with unanimous
opinions.
Upon application by the Defendant to the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Michigan for a writ of habeas corpus, the Petition was granted
under the theory that Henderson's testimony had. been
improperly admitted into evidence by the trial court because
of the trial court's failure to apply the fruit of the
poisonous tree doctrine.

The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals

affirmed that opinion and we petitioned for a writ of
certiorari which was granted by this Court on December 3rd,
1973.
We raise three issues this morning in argument.
The first is the question of the retroactivity of Miranda.
One week after the Miranda case was decided, this Court held
in Johnson versus New Jersey that Miranda would be applicable

7
to all those trials that commenced after the decision date in
Miranda and I think you can see from the 'dates that I set out
when I first commenced that we were caught in a limbo situation.
We had an interrogation under Escobedo on April
the 19th, Miranda came down in June and we commenced trial in
October

and even though Johnson stood for the proposition

that Miranda would be prospective in its application, we were
experiencing retroactive effect because we were caught in this
limbo and this is the particular injustice in this case that
we complained about this morning, that at the time the police
were interrogating the Defendant Tucker, he was properly
advised of his Escobedo rights and the police at that time
were doing nothing wrong and now, by operation of the Johnson
case and the retroactive effect, we start being told that the
interrogation is illegal.
We feel that the Court should modify the retro­
active application of Johnson because it places the — this
Court in the position of saying that Tucker’s interrogation
was improper but it only became improper by an ex post facto
situation.
We feel that to make Johnson or effective
J ohnson to conform to its rationale and make it prospective
would, be in order.

The Court has done this —

QUESTION:

Before we decide, however, that the

exclusionary aspect does not apply to live human beings who

8
are ready and able and willing to corae in and testify, then
you don't need to, because under these problems —
MR. PATTERSON:
QUESTION:

That right.

— about retroactivity, do you?

MR. PATTERSON:

No, we do not, Mr. Chief Justice,

and that takes me immediately to the second issue, which I
think is —
QUESTION:

Before you get to that, Mr. Patterson,

really, your first point is that Johnson versus New Jersey
be overruled, because it, itself, dealt with the

retroactivity

of Miranda and to say that the decision dealing with retro­
activity should be accorded only prospective effect is really
kind of building anew dimension onto the thing.
MR. PATTERSON:

Yes, your Honor, it should be

unless it is overruled because I think, according —
QUESTION:

In light of Angus, Miranda would be

retroactive.
MR. PATTERSON:
to overrule

No, your Honor, I think the —

Angus, you should use an activity date as

opposed to a trial date.
QUESTION:

So you would modify it?

MR. PATTERSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor, thank you.

Incidentally, how many situations like

this do you think can come up now, at this late date, under
Johnson?

9
MR. PATTERSON:

I wouldn’t believe that many,

your Honor.
The second issue —
QUESTION:

I don’t imagine you know of any likely

in Richmond, do you?
MR. PATTERSON:
not.

No, your Honor, I personally do

I've been Involved in prosecuting —

new trial.
MR. PATTERSON:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

After the appeal and that is covered

by Jenkins against Delaware.
MR. PATTERSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

We’d have heard of them by now.

MR. PATTERSON:

I would hope so.

Your Honor, the second issue is the doctrine that
you just mentioned, would be the application of the fruit of
the poisoned tree doctrine and more specifically, we raise
the question whether the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine
should be applied to the testimony and the identify of the
witness, who was discovered during what is now declared to be
an improper interrogation.
The Solicitor General has intervened on this

10

particular issue and will be arguing as well on this point,
so Ifd like to highlight some of the more salient points of
our brief.
This precise question of witness testimony being
suppressed under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine has
yet to be presented to this Court and I take that lead from
the footnote in Harrison versus United States, 392 U.S. in
footnote 9.

It would be, to apply the fruit of the poi­

sonous tree doctrine to a witness who testifies, I think,
would be an unwarranted extension of that particular doctrine.
It would be unwarranted because the immediate
distinction is that in this type of situation with Henderson
we have the testimony of a live witness and I do not feel
that we should automatically equate a live witness and all
that that suggests, the fact that he has his own memory
and his own perception and his own will and his own intellect,
which are all going to interact on that person when he takes
the stand, we should not equate that type of a human being
with physical evidence automatically because we have at least
that distinguishing characteristic which makes a human being
unique.
But I think, more argueably is the fact that this
witness, when he comes into court and takes the stand, is
going to be subject to the rigorous cross-examination bydefense counsel.

He is subject to impeachment and all the

11
devices the defense counsel has to cross-examine and this was
done in the case of Henderson when he took the stand before
the jury and he, a witness, has the ability to have come
forward on his own, possibly, as contrary to physical
evidence.
But I think more importantly, is the fact that
when Henderson's name was brought up by the Defendant Tucker,
at that point, the name Henderson was of no evidentiary value
as such.

It is not evidence, the mere mentioning of a name,

not evidence per se.

But independent labors of the police,

who sought him out and talked to him, at that point, he begins
to take on significance and when he comes into court and
testifies, he then becomes evidence.
And I believe this Court addressed this particular
problem in a case one week after Miranda, which Would be
June 20th, 1966, and Schmerber and the language ih Schmerbersaid, "The privilege against self-incrimination is a bar to
compelling one to be a witness, to give testimony."

But

the Court went on to state,but it is not a bar against that
compulsion which makes the witness or the defendant or the
accused the source of real or physical evidence and in this
case, Tucker was the source, we admit, of Henderson's
identity.

But it is not evidence, the mere mentioning of

that name.
The fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, rather

12

than being extended, should be curtailed and I think is
being

curtailed in decisions by this Court and I would cite

the Court a couple of the prime examples, would be the case
of Harris versus New York in 1970s when the Court permitted
the prosecution to use for impeachment the prior statement
of the defendant which he was not being permitted to use in
its case in chief, even though I think that would be the
illegal fruit, it ;vas still being — the prosecution was
being allowed some use of it and in U,S. versus Calandra,
evidence which was illegally obtained during an illegal
search and seizure was still being permitted to be brought
before a grand jury for the use of that grand jury in its
investigation.
The Court, this Court, has developed, as well as
some of the lower federal district courts, I think theories
which are now doctrines of law which permit or avoid the
harsh application of the fruit of the poisonous tree
doctrine, such theories as attenuation
source.

or the independent

These rules have been carved out judicially from

the announced doctrine in order to avoid the extreme, I think,
harsh application of the automatic exclusion of evidence by
the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.
But in the case that we have, the case of
Michigan versus Tucker, to apply the fruit of the poisonous
tree doct3?ine in the purpose of that application of that

doctrine5 is to deter unlawful police conduct.
In this particular instance would be, in itself,
unreasonable and unfair because the police, first of all,
were not engaged in any misconduct.

Their interrogation of

Tucker met the standards then in force under Escobedo and,
secondly, when they went out to talk to Henderson, this
'witness, they were following what was the alibi of the
defendant.

The defendant had given exculpatory remarks and

the police went out to check that alibi and had it checked
out, there would have been a good probable belief that
Tucker would have been released, had his alibi been
confirmed and if the police had ignored that exculpatory
remark, they would have been

derelict in their responsibility.

The final issue that we raised in our brief was
the question of Miranda itself, and we posed —
QUESTION:

If you’ll pursue that point that you

have made, suppose the police had found that Henderson would
exculpate the defendant here and they had not produced him as
a witness.

They would be in violation of Brady and other

cases, would they not?
MR. PATTERSON:

Absolutely, your Honor, and there

would be a very unfair and obviously unethical thing for the
prosecution or the police to have even considered, bo hide a
witness which would have been of benefit to the defense and
this is, again, we are now telling them, you have done

14
something improper, when, actually, what they were doing was
being very proper and very ethical.
The question we raise with regard to Miranda is
whether the standards which were enunciated in Miranda,
whether they are too restrictive in their exclusion of
admission and whether they are mandated by the U.S.
Constitution?

Well, the majority writing in Miranda, I

think, answered the second half of that question when they
said that"We cannot say that the Constitution necessarily
requires adherance to any particular solution for the
inherent compulsion of the interrogation process."
In those words, I think they admitted that the
Constitution did not require the standards that they
developed, but this was a judicially-developed framework to
protect the Fifth Amendment privilege.
is
The other half of the question,/are the standards
set forth in Miranda too restrictive?

And I thirik at this

point it is undebatable that the standards which were
enunciated in Miranda tolerate nc deviance.

The way the

phrases were couched, they were couched with the lise of the
word "must."

"These warnings must be given, waivers must be

obtained," and if there is any indication he does not want
to proceed, you must end your interrogation.”
So what the Court did in this instance, was to
develop an absolute, inflexible and rigid test and the Court

15
took what used to be circumstances the Court would loom to,
the advisement of certain Constitutional rights, and elevated
these in the form of standards to what are now almost fun­
damental Constitutional rights, the violation of which results
in the automatic exclusion of a statement made by the
defendant regardless if that statement might, in fact, be
voluntary.
The Supreme Court, way back in 1883 in Kopp
versus Utah, I think said that the •— dealing with the
question of confessions, that "We have wisely foregone to
mark with absolute precision the limits of admission and
exclusion"and I think they foresaw the problem when you do
mark with a rigid test what is going to be admissable and
what isn’t.
What now happens tin the trial court — and I am
sure this Court is aware of it —- the focus is shifted from
the will of the accused or what is on his mind or why he
made a statement and the first focus is now on the conduct
of the police officer and we look to see what he did — how
he acted in order to determine if this man made a voluntary
statement when, actually, the test the police officer goes
through, the advisement of those four rights and the
obtaining of a waiver, is not really bearing upon the
question, is this a voluntary confession?
And the police officer's scrutiny, if he makes

15
one fatal mistake in the advisement of the rights, or later
when he testifies in court, at the trial court in a hearing
like Jackson v, Denno, we call it "Walker” hearing, if he
testifies in his hearing about voluntariness and makes one
mistake in how he says he gave his rights, the court stops
at that point its inquiry as to the voluntariness of a
confession and because the Miranda standards have been
violated, maybe one had been

omitted or had been incorrectly

testified to, the inquiry stops and because of that
deviation from the standards set forth, the court trial court
will exclude any statement made by the accused.
The test is not longer now — Miranda, I believe,
was supposed to take us away from looking at the totality of
circumstances and we are supposed to look at this condition
precedent before we get to the confession.

There' is now a

condition precedent, namely, the four rights the officer
makes and Miranda was supposed to take us away from examining
the totality of circumstances and make it very simple to
determine if, indeed, the voluntary statement was made and the
old test of looking to the defendant to see if his will was
overborn or if there was any inducement or coercion upon him
or any threats to make him make a statement or obtain a
waiver was supposed to have been taken out of the examination
of voluntariness but, in fact, I think that we are fooling
ourselves if we don’t realize that we are still in the

17
trial court and very much immersed, in a total

circumstances

examinations a totality of circumstances.
We still look to all these factors in determining
whether the rights were properly administered.

We still,, the

trial court still looks to the totality of circumstances to
see how the rights were administered.

Were they administered

after three days of incommunicado interrogation or were they -QUESTION:

By "rights," you mean the warnings?

MR. PATTERSON:

The warnings, ye3.

And, well,

even though the warnings are there and it is a condition
precedent to getting into the next step of examining the
voluntariness, the court still brings in all the circumstance
of how that officer gave his rights, when did he give the
defendant his rights, under what circumstances were the
rights administered and was he intoxicated and so forth.
I think Mr. Justice White, in his dissent, fore­
saw some of these problems when he wrote, "Today's decision
leaves open such questions as whether the accused was in
custody, whether his statements were spontaneous or the
product of interrogation, whether the accused has effectively
waived his rights and whether ncntestimoniary evidence
introduced at trial is the fruit of statements made during a
prohibitied interrogation."
Mr. Justice White was absolutely correct.

We

now have these minitrials and the prosecution must prevail

18

in every one of these questions and more and should we fail on
just one of these questions, even though we might have
prevailed on six, if we miss on one of these minitrials, at
that point the inquiry ends and the judge automatically
excludes the statement that we obtain as a fruit or an
illegal confession.
QUESTION:

Mr. Patterson, you said that was — this

whole minitrial is step one and then you go on to see if, in
fact, the statement was a voluntary or involuntary one.

Are

there any cases in Michigan that hold that even after all of
the so-called Miranda rights were accorded, that the statement
was involuntary?
MR. PATTERSON:

Your Honor, I do not believe that

I can give a case, a specific case.
QUESTION:

I don’t think we have ever seen a

case here on a petition.
MR. PATTERSON:

No, your Honor, but you wouldn't

see it if the Court has ever ruled that way and I am sure
they have.
QUESTION:

Do you think they have?

MR. PATTERSON:

Oh, yes, I am sure they have, in

instances when the Court has found it involuntary, not
because the rights were violated —
QUESTION:

No, no, no — my hypothesis is, all

the rights were accorded.

He was told that he did not have to

19
say anything and he was told he could have a lawyer and if
he couldn’t hire a lawyer, the state would furnish him. one
then and there and all of that and are there eases in
Michigan that after all of that was done, that have held that
his statement was involuntary?
MR. PATTERSON:

Your Honor, I would cite this

case as an example when, at that point in time, in 1966,, all
the rights that were incumbent upon the police to be
administered were given and now we find that the statement —•
QUESTION:

There is no holding in this case

that the statement was involuntary.
MR. PATTERSON:

Oh, yes, and the statement that

Tucker made was never used, any of his remarks were —•
QUESTION:

I know, because the Miranda rules

were violated; there was no holding that this was Involuntary,
was there?
MR. PATTERSON:

No, that is correct.

The rights,

the warnings that would have to be properly administered were
not technically given and therefore —
QUESTION:

Therefore, his statement was inad-

missable under Miranda.
MR. PATTERSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And that is not at issue here at all.

MR. PATTERSON:

No, that part is not.

The totality of circumstances, the

examination

20
of all the factors surrounding the voluntariness of the
confession is a manageable test and it is still being used,
again5 the totality to examine how the warnings were given
and this Court has reaffirmed the viability of the totality
of circumstances test as recently as the Bustamonte case,
where totality of circumstances were examined to determine if
proper consent had been obtained in cinder to make a search.
QUESTION:

And the opinion of that case sharply

distinguished the Miranda situation.
MR. PATTERSON:

Yes, it did but I am going now to

the totality of circumstances as being the test that the
Court found a manageable and a workable test to examine the
circumstances under which the defendant then gave his consent
and the same thing in the case of Barker v. Win,go, when, again,
this Court used the totality of circumstances rather than a
fixed rule to determine whether the defendant had been denied
his right of a speedy trial.
I suggest that we adopt and we move forward to a
flexible standard of looking to the totality of circumstances
and use the Miranda warning as criteria in determining whether
the defendant had been properly advised and whether he had
given proper consent to waive his right to remain silent
and that I adopt the language out of the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act where they say that the absence
of any one fo these particular warnings should not be the

21
sole determining factor on the admissibility of that confession
but ought to be a factor that the judge takes into consider­
ation in determining the

voluntariness of a confession.

What is wrong with the warnings as they are
required today is what we find wrong in the Tucker situation.
I don't think there was any question that Marion Corey was
raped and there is no question that the Jury found the
Defendant guilty of that offense and there is no question
that the police were engaged at that time in a proper preMiranda situation, having advised him of his rights under
Escobedo and there is no question that the police were doing
something very proper in going out checking out his alibi
which might well have exculpated him.
But there is a question that if the warnings
Which are now required in the rigid test that they are in
the Miranda Doctrine, that they continue to be enforced in
the form that they are as the sole criteria in determining
the admissibility, there is going to be a question that
Marion Corey and the people of the State of Michigan can have
their day in court, but the bigger question is that in the
other cases that come after this one, whether defendants
who are only tied to their case by an admission can ever be
brought to justice.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

I'd like to reserve a little time.
One question before you sit down.

If

22
the Court should decide the the exclusionary doctrine cannot
apply to a live human being who is ready, able and willing to
testify, then we don't reach all these nuances, do we?
MR. PATTERSON:

That is right, your Honor.

I

have given the Court, I think, several arguments, any one of
which would allow Tucker1s case to be —- the conviction of
which would be affirmed, and we felt that the Miranda issue
did have a bearing because It backs up to the second issue
itself and this is how they got into the fruit of the poisonous
tree because of a violation of one of the warnings in the
Miranda doctrine.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Korman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD R. KORMAN, ESQ.,
Amicu3 Curiae, supporting Petitioner
MR. KORMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
We are not here asking that Miranda v., Arizona
be overruled or that Johnson versus New Jersey be overruled,
lather, the issue is whether the holding in Miranda versus
Arizona should be extended to interrogation which elicits
statements not admitted into evidence against the accused
but merely leads to discovery of other evidence.
The arguments of the party spoke as principally

23
on whether the so-called "fruit of the poisoned tree doctrine"
extends to the testimony of a live witness whose identity
was discovered as a result of interrogation without the
Miranda warnings.
The critical assumption upon which this
argument is based, of course9 is that there was, in fact,
the poisoned tree, that it was clearly a violation of the
self-incrimination clause to engage in informal and custodial
interrogation to obtain statements which were not admitted
against the sccused at trial but merely led to the discovery
of other evidence.
While we agree with the State of Michigan that
ifs in factj the tree here was poisonous, the fruit should
not be suppressed, it is our submission that this case
presents two analytically distinct issues.

The threshold

issue involves the scope of the protection that the self­
incrimination clause affords to a subject in the context of
informal custodial interrogation.
In Miranda, it was held that during such informal
interrogation, an accused may not be compelled to make any
statements which could be admitted against him at trial,
that custodial interrogation, even without the use of tactics
which would render the statement involuntary was inherently
coercive and that warnings were necessary to ensure that the
privilege against self-incrimination 'was not violated.

24
We believe that in the peculiar context of
informal .interrogation, this protection is adequate to
vindicate those bundles of values reflected by the privilege
against self-incrimination and there where law enforcement
officers elicit statements during such custodial interrogation
which are merely used to discover evidence, the privilege
against self-incrimination has not been violated.
We do not regard this claim as having been fore­
closed by Counselman against Hitchcock where it was held
that a witness subpoenaed before a grand jury could not be
compelled under a threat of contempt to answer questions
■where the only use which could be made of the statements was
to discover other evidence.
First, the Defendant In this case did not refuse
to answer any questions, nor did he assert his privilege,
nor is there, as a matter of fact, as opposed to presumption,
any basis for the assertion that his statement was compelled
in violation of the privilege against self-incrimination.
More significantly, in light of the values
reflected by the self-incrimination clause, there is a
substantial basis for distinguishing, first, between
compelled testimony before a grand jury, a Congressional
proceeding or similar Inquiry and informal custodial
Interrogation and, second, distinguishing between interroga­
tion! which leads to the admission of statements made by the

25
accused at his trial and the use of those statements to obtain
other- evidence.
Those values were the values reflected by the
privilege against self-incrimination, a cause comprehensively
set forth by Mr. Justice Goldberg in his opinion for the
Court in Murphy against the Waterfront Commission and the
relevant excerpt from that opinion as set forth at page 15
of our brief.
Unlike grand jury witnesses, the Defendant here
was not subject to the cruel trilemna of self-accusation,
perjury or contempt.

Moreover, he was not subject to inhumane

treatment, nor, given the circumstances which led to his
arrest, can it reasonably be said that his custodial
interrogation improperly infringed on the privacy values
which were reflected by the privilege against self•M

incrimination and here again, such interrogation is sub­
stantially different from that before a grand jury, or a
Congressional committee where a witness can be compelled to
appear without the slightest probable cause to believe that
he has any information to give to the grand jury.
Moreover,

there need, be no concern here that the

interrogation will lead to the admission at trial of selfdeprecatory statements of questionable validity.
concern was important to the Court's decision.

That
It was

specifically alluded to twice in the majority opinion

in

26
Miranda and also in the discussion of the purpose of the
Miranda warnings which appears in Johnson versus New Jersey.
We do not deny that such interrogation, which is
intended to obtain leads to other evidence does implicate
the policies reflected by the privilege, that is, that the
Government in its contest with the individual should shoulder
the entire load and, to a limited extent, the preference for
an accusatorial rather than an inquisitorial system but we
submit that it does not violate those values any more than
has already been

sanctioned by this Court in cases such as

Schmerber versus California, United States versus Dionislo
and Mara and other cases.
If, for example, an individual may be compelled to
speak —- and when I use the word "compelled," I mean under
the threat of jail so that a witness may be able to testify
at’ trial that his voice was that, for example, of the kidnapper
who telephoned to ask for ransom, why may not that individual,
if he is apprehended before his accomplices have released the
victim, be interrogated without any such overt compulsion
regarding the location of the victim and if the victim is
found alive, why should not her testimony identifying the
suspect so interrogated not be admitted?

Or if his finger­

prints are found at the location where the victim has been
found, why should they be suppressed?
Yet this is the import of the holding of the

27
courts below.

thetical.
QUESTION:
MR. KORMAN:

The possibility.
Well, it would, clearly come xvithin

the import of the holding of the court below and one could
only invoke the words of Mr. Justice Marshall in Miranda in
his Miranda dissent when he suggested that one is entitled to
feel astonished that the Constitution -QUESTION:

MR. KORMAN:

I meant Mr. Justice

Harlow.
One is entitled to feel astonished that the
Constitution can be read to produce

such a result.

It is

our submission that as long as the interrogation is not
marred by conduct which would be found offensive on due
process grounds that the values implicated by the privilege
would be sufficiently protected by the exclusion of state­
ments made by an individual if, in fact, the Miranda

28
warnings are not given and that the statements are therefore
regarded under Miranda as being compelled.
The leads derived from such statements should
not be suppressed.
The second aspect of our argument, Mr. Chief
Justice, goes to the fruit of the poisoned tree doctrine and
it based on the —
QUESTION:

Before we leave the first aspect, what

if we had here — a hypothetical case — a coerced confession
and in that coerced confession the — Mr. Tucker talked about
this witness?
MR. KORMAN:

I think the case

of coerced

confession would be more difficult because there we would be
dealing with police conduct that would be offense in and of
itself, regardless of what use is made of the statement and
there it could be reasonably suggested that what, we are
concerned about is simply deterring this kind of conduct
that it is the conduct which the police engaged in which is
itself offensive and therefore, perhaps, the exclusionary
rule should be applied to its fullest extent but we are
not engaged in —QUESTION:

Was it, in fact, applied to its fullest

extent, to use your words, back in the pre-Miranda days when
the Court thought that what was applicable here was the due
process clause of the 14th Amendment?

29
MR. KORMAN:

I believe it was, but I haven’t

been able to find cases to that effect although we do cite
cases at early common lav; at the time of the adoption of the
Constitution of cases involving this very issue, with a
live witness, The King versus Lockhart, which is cited in our
brief.

It’s an English case in which confession was obtained

which was excludable on traditional voluntariness grounds
and English courts held that the witness could be permitted —
QUESTION:

Well, that is the rule in England, I

know.
MR. KORMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, it is.
Of course, England does not have our

Constitution.
MR. KORMAN:

That’s true.

On the other hand,

when the framers who broke the privilege against selfincrimination sat down to write that clause, what they had in
mind was the law of England at the time, as your Honor
pointed out.
QUESTION:

Well, its phrased as a privilege

against compulsory self-incriminatlon, too, in the
Constitution, isn't it?
MR. KORMAN:

That’s correct, but as it was

understood at common lav;, again, this is a controversy that is
engaged in by both sides in the Miranda case.

At common law,

the notion was that compelled testimony and the compelled

30

statements which were made by an accused under compulsion,
under torture, under threats, were excluded as a matter of
a common law evidentiary rule, that those statements were
inherently unreliable and that when the privilege was written,
the privilege against self-incrimination ivas written, it was
basically intended to reflect the English rule that you
could not be compelled to appear under oath and testify as
a witness, but it was understood at the time of the adoption
of the Constitution that you could be subjected to informal
custodial interrogation and statements which were really
compelled under torture were excluded, not because it was
felt that the principle was violated, but because of state­
ments that were regarded as inherently unreliable.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We Will resume there

[Whereupon, a recess was taken for luncheon,
from 12:00 o’clock noon to 1:00 o’clock p.m.]

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Korman, you have

MR. KORMAN:

Yes , four minutes.

Just before — during the argument, Mr. Justice
Marshall, you asked for a case involving a potential
kidnapping.

There are several cases discussed on page 277

of Judge Friendly’s book, "Benchmarks5on which he suggests
and cites kidnapping cases and other cases where It may be
important for law enforcement officers to —

of the —
QUESTION:
MR. KORMAN:

Well, now we have one.
Well, there may be more.

Also,

Mr. Justice Stewart asked about whether, in a traditional
due process violation, the fruits would be excluded?

Of

course, in Wong Sun versus the United States, was a case in
which a confession was the result not of any coercion, but
as a result of an illegal arrest.
QUESTION:
MR. KORMAN:

Fourth Amendment violation.
Yes.

And the court applied the

fruit of the poisonous tree to tangible fruits.

32

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. KORMAN:

Of course, we think this case is

different from Wong Sun because there has been no Constitu­
tional violation.

That is, it is impossible to say and there

is nothing, of course, in this record to indicate that the
statement of this defendant was taken in violation of any
Constitutional right

and that is why it leads me to the other

point I’d like to make.
In many ways, the argument we make, although it
may be a somewhat broader one than the State of Michigan in
the sense that the analysis we suggest would apply to all
fruits in this kind of a case without distinction between
tangible evidence and live witnesses, it vrould only apply in
a Miranda-type situation and it would not necessarily have to
extend to where, in fact, there was a violation 'of the
Constitution.
On the other hand, the live witness, based as it
is on the notions of attenuation or notions that relate to —
that we can never know for certain, that this witness would
have not come forward or testified, but for the violation
would, of course, apply across the board to all cases and to
all exclusionary rules and, indeed, the cases in the District
of Columbia, if I recall correctly, were not Miranda-type
situations but Fourth Amendment violations.
There are several points that I would like to

33
touch upon as to why, even if we are wrong on our initial
argument, even if the Fifth Amendment does protect against
compulsion during the course of custodial interrogation
relating to both its statements and fruits, why that
exclusionary rule of Miranda should not be extended to fruits,
first, we not that most of the empirical evidence that is
available and that is cited in the brief for the Respondent
indicates that Miranda has very little effect on the decision
of a defendant on whether to make a statement or not.
In fact, all of the studies suggest that it has
had no effect on the decision, that is, where the warnings
ere given.
QUESTION:

Have there been a good many cases on

whether failure to comply with Miranda warnings results in
exclusion of physical, tangible evidence which is found
through the use of the answers to the questions?
MR. KORMAN:

Well, I know one case which is

cited in cur brief, the case called United States versus
Castellano, which is now pending on
QUESTION:

Say you asked where is the gun?

And

he says, It is under the dresser?
MR. KORMAN:

That is exactly the facts in United

States versus Castellano.
QUESTION:
MR. KORMAN:

And the Fifth Circuit suppressed it

3^

as the fruit of not having given the Miranda warnings and I
might add even though —
QUESTION:

And do you think that is an easier or

a harder case for you to win?
MR. KORMAM:
QUESTION:

I don’t -Do you think they are on the same

level?
MR. KORMAN:

I think they are on the same level.

I might say that it might be somewhat harder because when
you are dealing with a live witness, you have the additional
element that you would never even know.

He might have come

forward anyway.
QUESTION;

Well, of course, if the guy hadn’t

said anything, you still might have

seen the gun under the

dresser.
MR. KORMAN:

Well, that is exactly the argument

we make to the Fifth Circuit and they rejected that, also.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH M. MOGILL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. MOGILL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The first question presented for the Court’s
consideration in this case is whether there is any basis and
precedent logic or policy for- creating a distinction between
physical and verbal derivative evidence and refusing to
suppress from use in the state's case in chief the testimony
of a witness which was illegally obtained where it 'was the
existence and identity of that witness were learned solely as
the direct result of illegal — of admitted illegal.police
conduct and where it is stipulated by Petitioner that there
was no independent source for the discover of the witness'
existence and identity.
While this Court has not previously passed on
this precise fact situation, the distinction proposed by
Petitioner has never been accepted by this Court and

has,

in fact, expressly been rejected in circumstances closely
similar to those of the case at Bar.
QUESTION:

And what case was that you are talking

about?
MR. MOGILL:

In the Wong Sun case, where this

36
Court’s —
QUESTION:
MR. MOGILL:

Did they exclude a witness?
The sole distinction between this

case and Wong; Sun is that the verbal evidence which was
rejected in Wong Sun was that of the Appellant, rather than
the witness.
QUESTION:

It isn’t completely a parallel then,

is it?
MR. MOGILL:

Not completely, that is correct.

The sole distinction between Wong Sun and this case Is the
fact that the witness — the testimony excluding the witness
in Wong Sun, was that of the Appellant rather than a witness.
However, Petitioner suggests no circumstances which
distinguish VJong Sun from the case at Bar and In point of
fact, applying this Court’s traditional deterrence impact
approach to the exclusionary role cases requires1'application
of the same result in Wong Sun to the facts of the case at
Bar and if I might, I would like to go into detail

regarding

the circumstances regarding the proposed test which you
authored, Mr. Chief Justice, in the Smith and Bowden case
and which, I submit, may not be squared with the exclusionary
principles enunciated by this Court in Wong Sun and pre­
viously in Nardone and SiIverthorne.
The proposed distinction would have the
admissibility of the testimony of a witness turn not on the

37
relationship between the primary police Illegality and the
discovery of the witness’ existence and identity, but rather
on the voluntariness of the witness’ decision to appear in
court.
The test further distinguishes physical from
verbal evidence on the grounds that there is no guarantee
that a witness' testimony will favor the prosecution, that
a witness is subject to cross-examination and that physical
evidence speaks for itself.
A further condition which has been articulated in
this test is that the admissibility of the testimony of a
witness goes to the weight, but not the admissibility of
that test, of that evidence.
The voluntariness of a witness' decision to
testify is not an appropriate consideration for the reason
that it goes not to the relationship between the primary
illegality and the discovery of the witness and since the
focus that this Court has consistently applied in administering
the exclusionary rules is the impact of deterrence, this
focus would be ignored by such a test.
Moreover, voluntariness of the witness' decision
to testify is not an appropriate consideration because the
witness may be compelled to come into court and testify by
the subpoena powers of the court and if the witness refuses
to testify, the witness is subject to the threat of contempt.

38
QUESTION:

Would you then make a distinction

between witnesses who appeared

voluntarily and those who

appeared under a subpoena, the compulsion of the subpoena?
MR. MOGILL:

Such a distinction would have no

bearing on the purposes of the exclusionary rule because it
has no bearing on the relationship between the primary
illegality and the discovery of the evidence.
QUESTION:

Well, I wondered then why — I was

waiting for the point you were going to make as to the
distinction between the two.
MR. MOGILL:
v/hich is

My point was that the distinction

proposed by Petitioner is not appropriate because

the voluntariness of the 'witness is irrelevant, given the
Court’s subpoena power.
QUESTION:

You have to draw a line between

subpoenaed witness and voluntary ivitness, I submit.
You mean, If a witness comes in and says, "I
know about this case and I want to testify," that the bench
says "Uh uh."
MR. MOGILL;

No, certainly not.

Certainly not,

your Honor.
QUESTION:

I hope not.

MR. MOGILL:

I don’t mean to suggest for a

second that where a ’witness voluntarily appears, that that
witness may not be used.

However, in the case before this

39
Court right now, it is stipulated that there was no
independent source and once a primary taint has been
established, the prior cases of this Court consistently hold —
QUESTION:

Was this witness subpoenaed or not?

MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry?
Was this witness subpoenaed?

MR. MOGILL:

I have — I personally do not know,

although I would assume that he was.

As a matter of practice,

in state courts, subpoenas are sent out prior to trial.
The point I am making is that because of the
subpoena power of the Court, because a witness may be made to
appeal regardless of his voluntariness, apart from an
-5

independent source situation, the voluntariness of the witness
decision is irrelevant.
QUESTION:

Well, if I understand the State and

the Government. they say this witness might have volunteered.
MR. MOGILL:

There is no basis whatever in the

record of this ease —
QUESTION:

They didn't say it in the record, but

they said he might have.

And, of course, that is true, is it

not?
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:
MR. MOGILL:

It is possible.
Right.
It was stipulated, however, that

there was no independent source.

40
QUESTION:

The stipulation, as I understand it,

is that the state learned of this witness only through the
statement made by Mr. Tucker, which statement was made in
violation of his Miranda rights.
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:
MR. MOGILL:

That is correct.
That is a given in this case.
That is correct and the Petitioner

has never alleged that there was an independent source for
the discovery of the witness* identity.
QUESTION:

Do you think that precludes entirely

the possibility that, as happens in many cases, that
witnesses volunteer?
MR. MOGILL:

It certainly does not preclude

entirely, but because of the primary illegality, the burden
necessarily shifts to the prosecution.
QUESTION:

Your point is that that is purely

speculative?
MR. MOGILL:

That Is correct.

The distinctions that have been urged between
physical and

verbal evidence regarding the nature of the

evidence also are inappropriate for the reason that they
ignore the relationship between the primary illegality and
the discovery of the evidence.

But they are also inappro­

priate for the reason that, just as a search may not be
justified on the basis of what it produces, the admissibility

Hi
of the testimony of a witness has never turned, on whose side
it favors and the admissibility of physical evidence does not
turn on whether or not it is, in fact, marijuana, for example,
or oregano or is, in fact, heroin as opposed to, for example,
lactose.
Similarly, the argument that

live evidence is

distinguishable from physical evidence on the grounds that
live evidence is subject to cross-examination also does not
hold up for the reason that, in the case of physical evidence,
the defense attorney can and does cross-examine the expert
offering the testimony.
Similarly, the claim that the manner by which the
witness was discovered goes to the weight and not the
admissibility of that witness’ testimony is not an appropriate
consideration for the reason that the weight of a witness’
testimony is determined by his opportunity and capacity for
observation and on the basis of any interests or bias the
witness may have.
How the police came to find this witness is
irrelevant to that consideration and in point of fact, a
defense attorney trying a criminal case would not be
permitted to ask a witness how did the police find you?
QUESTION:

I suppose if the question were made to

turn solely on the reliability of the type of evidence, you
could make a pretty good argument that physical or

42
demonstrative evidence tends to be more reliable in many
respects than eye-witness evidence, or at least testimonial
evidence.
MR. MOCILL:

In certain circumstances — I'm

not sure I follow your question, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Well, if you are addressing yourself --

and I don't think perhaps you are, but you are at least
commenting on this, if we are talking about how reliable is
the evidence being excluded, I should think a case could be
made for the fact that the gun on which fingerprints were
might be a good deal more reliable than a witness who recalls
a particular encounter with the Defendant.
MR. MOGILL:

Certainly.

I am not relying on

such a distinction and, in fact, this Court’s exclusionary
rule cases do not consider the reliability of the evidence
as a factor in assessing whether or not to apply the
exclusionary rule.
I think that an appropriate case which is
analagous for the point of the scope of exclusion necessary
is this Court’s decision in Kastigar because the interests at
stake in Kastigar were the same as those involved here and
that is, protection of the privilege and according — Kastigar'
was considering the scope of exclusion necessary in order
to restore the privilege in order to maintain the privilege.
the only difference being that in Kastigar, the view was

43
prospective in maintaining the privilege where, in this case,
the view is retrospective in terms of returning the parties
to the status quo»
The Petitioner in Kastigar challenged the
sufficiency of the statute under consideration on the ground
that that statute would not protect against derivative use
of leads and names of witnesses.
This Court rejected that contention specifically
stating that not only would the statute not permit derivative
use of leads and names of witnesses, but that the statute
could not permit such use in order to be consistent with the
Constitutional command.
QUESTION:

In fact —
Then, of course, you have got a plain

violation of the Fifth Amendment of a man being compelled to
testify against himself, don't you?
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:
MR. MOGILL:

Certainly, your Honor.
That isn’t the case here.
Well, in this case there Is an

admitted violation of Miranda.
QUESTION:

Yes, but not of the compulsory self-

incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment.
MR. MOGILL:

This Court's holding in Miranda

was

that in the absence of all due warnings required therein,
the compulsion ihnei^ent in the interrogation process could
not be met so that any statement given was for Constitutional

44
purposes compelled.
QUESTION:

How do you define a holding?

MR. MOGILL:

I do not — I don't think that I am

in a position to argue holding versus dictum and I don't
think it is appropriate because even if Miranda was not
decided on Constitutional grounds, this Court has never
required a violation to be Constitutional.
QUESTION:

Especially if what is used against him

aren’t his words, aren’t his admissions, but some non­
testimonial objects, then the question is, how far are you
going to extend the fruits doctrine as a rule to implement
the basic purpose?
MR, MOGILL:

That is correct and it is my

position that —

What is your argument?

Assume a

question in violation of Miranda, where is the gun and he
says it and you find the gun and, independently, you connect
the gun to the defendant.
court.

You never use his admission in

would still be a direct and immediate result of a Consti­
tutional violation of the defendant's rights.
QUESTION:
MR, MOGILL:

But it isn't offering his words.
That is corrects but this Court,

since Mardone, has refused to distinguish between direct and
derivative fruits of illegal activity and, in fact, the
Court’s concluding paragraph in the Calandra case expressly
reiterates the notion that direct and —

MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

Calandra itself is a prophylactic rule
Certainly, and a prophylactic —
And so now you want to put — so now

you are suggestirg you should have a prophylactic rule on a
prophylactic rule, to be sure and get all the fruits in order
to make the prophylactic rule more prophylactic.
MR. MOGILL:

In order for Miranda to be more

effective, there must be removed any incentive to violate it
and if a police officer is able to use in court verbal
evidence which is directly derived from a violation —
QUESTION:
MR. MOGILL:

He isn’t using verbal evidence.
Certainly, the testimony of the

witness.
QUESTION:

Oh, but it is not his witness,

it is not the defendant's testimony.

I mean

46
MR. MOGILL:

It is testimony which was obtained

solely and directly as a result of a statement elicited from
the defendant in violation of Miranda.
QUESTION:

The question is still, though, how

far do you carry the fruits doctrine?
MR. MOGILL:

Certainly, and I think that this

Court has consistently limited the application of the fruits
doctrine to those situations where the deterrent aspect would
be met and I believe that on the facts of this case, there
was no distinction between physical and

verbal evidence,

that, in point of fact, an officer would be encouraged to
violate Miranda if he were able to use a witness such as
was found here and that the deterrent purposes recognized
in Wong Sun and in the prior cases would require rejection of
the proposed distinction between a witness and physical
testimony.
QUESTION:

You've got into some hypothetical

analogies so let me ask you another one that is based partly
on this case.

Suppose that Henderson, when the police went to

him, did what the defendant hoped he would and said, oh, yes,
he was with me.

And that, notwithstanding,as the prosecution

went forward on other evidence, that he was

called as an

alibi witness by the defense and testified affirmatively in
favor of the defendant's theory that he was somewhere else at
the time but then, on cross-examination, a vigorous

48
cross-examinations as it sometimes does , brought out the fact
that

he was not telling the truth and then he told all the

things which he testified to in this case.

Would you say

that that cross-examination must be stricken?

That he must

not be permitted to testify?
MR. MOGILLrOn the basis of the hypothetical as
you pose it, Mr. Chief Justice, I see no relationship between
any police illegality and the cross-examination of the witness
and for that reason —
QUESTION:

You say that the cross-examination

could come in?
MR. MOGILL:

In that case.

There would be no

relationship — there would be no evidentiary gain to the
prosecution from its misconduct, if I understand your
hypothetical correctly.
QUESTION:
hypothetical.

The

41
Let me make another variation in

question I would put to you on this

hypothetical is, would you extend the rule you are now
contending forth to this situation?

Suppose a kidnapping

case of the kind that has been mentioned before occurs and
the police have some word that the kidnap victim may be in a
particular house — group
house without a warrant.

of buildings and they go to the
They break into the house, find the

kidnapped victim and perhaps one of the kidnappers.

Would

you say that the testimony of the kidnapped victim must then

be excluded and suppressed because of the illegal entry and
break-in without a warrant?
MR. MOGILI»:

On the basis of the facts that you

have hypothesised, the question — I feel incapable of giving
a definitive ansiver,

I think that the question would

ultimately depend on the same principles —
QUESTION:

I am assuming in my hypothesis that

the police conduct was illegal but they finally got the
kidnap victim.
MR. MOGILL:

If there was no independent source

for the discovery of that victim, then, of course, the
witness' testimony would be Inadmissible.
QUESTION:
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

However —

Inadmissible.
Well, yes, however —
She would not be able — she or he

would not be able to testify that, yes, this man or this
man had —
MR. MOGILL:

However, I don’t think that would

be the result in your case because since kidnaps are
normally for the purpose of ransom, it is In the interest of
the kidnapper initially to make the identity of the victim
known so that there is no direct relationship between the
illegality of that act of breaking in and discovering the
existence and identity of the witness so that, in fact,
the witness testimony would be admissible

50
QUESTION:

Notwithstanding the illegal manner in

which the witness was found?
MR. MOGILL:

Because that did not lead the police

to the existence and Identity of the witness.

There may

be a partial exclusion involveds such as is involved in the
Wade and Gilbert situation, where if there is an independent
source for identifying a defendant apart from an illegal
line-up, the xd-tness may still come into court to testify
as to the identity of the defendant on the basis of previous
observations but not on the basis of the observation of the
line-up, so that the witness may well be permitted to testify
as a complaining witness, but, perhaps — and I don’t have an
answer to that right now — as to the offense related to the
illegal break-in.
The test which was proposed by Petitioner, I
submit, for the reasons I have stated, is inconsistent with
the deterrence principles of the exclusionary rule as
previously fashioned by this Court but I believe that the
test should be rejected for reasons beyond that because in
those courts which have attempted to apply this test, it has
proven to be unworkable.
To begin with, the test attempts to draw definite
conclusions from acts which are ambiguous, qualitatively more
so than many others which the law permits definite conclusions
to be drawn from and I think this is demonstrated in the

51
experiences of the courts which have attempted to apply the
Smith and. Bowden test.

Hone has articulated any consistent

standard for its application and, in point of fact, xvhile in
Smith and Bowden and Edwards, the witness’ initial reluc­
tance which was later overcome was viewed as an attenuating
factor which justified admissibility of the witness’
testimony;in the Tane case, the same factual context was
viewed

as exploitation of the taint, requiring suppression.
In the original proceeding in this case, in the

Michigan Court of Appeals, the same result as was reached
In Smith and Bowden was reached on the basis of the exact
opposite reasoning, the court presuming, without any
foundation in the record, I might add, that Henderson’s
testimony was probably voluntary, therefore, there was no
exploitation, therefore the witness’ testimony should be
admissible and in Smith and Anclerson, the witness initial
reluctance — I'm sorry, the witness’ initial willingness
was viewed as insufficient to break the causal chain of -the tainted chain.
There are no policy considerations which permit

I believe that the Smith and Bowden test has, for
these reasons shown itself to be unworkable and that the
principles previously enunciated by this Court have shown
themselves to be capable of minimizing the loss of evidence

test has been unworkable and I think that for this Court to
adopt it would, besides undercutting the established
principles of the exclusionary rule, would — the Court would
adopt a test which this Court can see today, on the basis of
the tests of the cases which have applied that test, is an
unworkable test.

QUESTION:

How do you distinguish the testimony

MR. MOGILL:

Well, in that situation, Mr. Wong

Yes, but they had no idea that he

was connected with this crime until — and they exploited
the information they got from Blackie Toy in illegal search.
MR. MOGILL:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

In order to know about Wong Sun.

They did it right then and there.

They found out about it

immediately and then the information, however, his testimony
came later or his information.
MR. MOGILL:

He came in.

That goes to a distinction, I think,

between the position of a witness who has no alternative of
not corning into court and testifying and a person who is
a potential defendant, such as Wong Sun who, after being
arraigned, then came in and this Court held that his
decision to testify was sufficiently remote —
QUESTION:

I would think it would run the other

way.
MR. MOGILL:

A witness has no choice not to

56
testify; once the police have come upon his existence and.
identity5 the court subpoenaes him.
QUESTION:

Well, he can have the privilege against

self-incrimination, the same way a defendant can.
MR. MOGILL:

I am distinguishing between the

situation of an accomplice witness who has the privilege and
a witness who is not an accomplice who doesn't have the
privilege.
QUESTION:

Well, but the reason for which both the

«defendant and the witness have the privilege is the same, it
is the privilege against self-incrimination, isn't it?
MR. MOGILL:

But In a situation of a witness to a

crime who is not himself a suspect, there is no privilege
which will permit that witness to come into court and say, I
refuse to testify just because I don't want to.
QUESTION:

Well, but in either case, it is based

on the notion of self-incrimination.

Typically, a witness

won't incriminate himself by testifying the way a defendant
would.
MR. MOGILL:

I don't believe I follow your point.

The second question which I wish to address goes
to the — is the Miranda, question and the question before
this Court at this point in time is not whether Miranda
should have been adopted, although I submit that it was
correctly adopted, but, rather, given the existence of

57
Miranda, has the operation of that decision in the last
eight years been shown to be so harmful to

law enforcement

in the exercising of Constitutional rights as to justify
departure from the principles of stare decisis?
The available evidence indicates that no harm has
come to law enforcement as a result of Miranda.
QUESTION:

Do you think the decision of the

co’urfc of appeals here isn’t some harm to law enforcement,
suppressing this particular evidence and not just going bade
to a new trial situation but, in effect, letting this guy
go scot-free?
MR. MOGILL:

I see no harm to law enforcement in

requiring the police to gain — in permitting the police to
gain no evidentiary advantage as a result of their own
illegality.
QUESTION:

So you say the decision of the Court

of Appeals here doesn't represent any harm to law enforce­
ment ?
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

Certainly.
This is so, even though the illegality

was not established until after —
MR. MOGILL:

Well, unless this Court overrules

Johnson, then this case must be viewed in the context of
a Miranda violation, which took place after Miranda.
QUESTION:

Do you regard Johnson as out of line

58
with Linkletter and some of the other retrospectivity cases?
MR. MOGILL:

I think that — well, I would urge

this Court not to reconsider Johnson —
QUESTION: You have to.
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:
MR, MOGILL:

But ~~
I say, you have to take that position.
Yes, I mean, what I — I am not

attempting to evade your question, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I’m
just attempting to put the various points of my ansv/er in an
order.
I believe that there is no appreciable impact
whatever on the administration of justice by reconsideration
of Johnson at this point in time and for that reason alone,
it should not be reconsidered.
However, in response to your question, I believe
that the centrality of the Fifth Amendment privilege to the
Integrity of the fact-finding process at trial sufficiently
justifies the decision In Johnson as to make that a closed
question before this Court today.
The Miranda decision was necessary —
QUESTION:
question.

Let me follow through with one more

What factors that were the foundation for the

Miranda decision are impinged upon in this case, in view of
the chronology of your case?

Improper police conduct is one

that is stated and yet at the time, this 'wasn’t regarded as

59
improper.
MR. MOGILL:

What this Court found, in Miranda, I

submit, is that application of the old due process test
had shown itself to be so incapable of protecting the
privilege that the integrity of the trial process wa3 in
jeopardy and that without a strict rule requiring the police
to inform a suspect of all of those rights which are most
critical at that time and reminding the police of the
restraints the law imposes upon them, that a trial was in
clanger of becoming a mere appeal from the interrogation
process.
These facts go so deeply to the heart of our
legal system that the decision in Johnson applying Miranda
partially retroactively, is certainly not out of line with
other decisions of this Court involving retroactivity.
The police today are familiar with the Miranda
decision and have fully incorporated it into their day to day
work and Mr. Gribbs, co-counsel representing the Detroit Bar
Association will address himself to that point in addition to
my remarks.
Miranda has had a beneficial impact on law
enforcement in toto in that it provides the police with a
clearer standard for determining what their own limits are
and what they may and may not do and it also has provided
the courts with an objective standard against which to

measure any claims of waiver.

And, as to the waiver question

Mr. Justice Stewart asked a question this morning as to any
Michigan cases on that point.

There is a recent Michigan

Court of Appeals case, People v. McClendon, the citation of
which escapes me but in that case the defendant had been
given the applicable Miranda warnings, had refused to sign a
waiver and had made a statement and the trial court had held
that there was a valid waiver.

The Michigan Court of Appeals

vacated that, the conviction, and remanded it for a hearing,
saying that the evidence v/as insufficient on those facts.
QUESTION:

Well, so the issue there was whether

or not there had been a 'waiver?
MR, MCGILL:

That is correct.

I believe that

that is what your question had been this morning.
QUESTION:

My question was, and I asked, your

colleague on the other side, did he

know of any case,

anywhere, really, where Miranda had been fully complied with
in every respect and there was a finding that the statement
was coerced.

It seems to me almost a contradiction in terms

but there was suggested an argument that going through the
Miranda is just step one and then step two is to find out
whether, even though Miranda was complied with, the statement
was coerced and I 'wondered if there was any case anywhere
holding that Miranda

was fully complied with

less, the statement was coerced.

but, nonethe­

It would seem to me rather

6l
an odd situation, if there is such a ca.se.
MR. MOGILL:

Unless one can imagine the situation

of a police officer brutalising a suspect and at the same time
reciting the learnings, while doing that.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Or threatening his family after giving

them the warnings.
MR. MOGILL:

I hadn't thought of that.

The decision in Miranda is also sound Constitutional
policy for — to paraphrase from the Escobedo decision, there
is no place in a democracy for a system of criminal law which
comes to depend for its continued effectiveness on citizens'
abdication through unawareness of the Constitutional rights.
The objections to the Miranda decision which are
urged before this Court do not go to any claim that Miranda
has caused an increase of crime., which it clearly has not,
but, rather, to its alleged inflexibility.

The modifications

which are urged, however, each of them, would swallow up the
rule and effectively overrule the case.
I think that it is incorrect to state that failure
to advise an indigent

of his right to court-appointed counsel

is a mere technicality, nor could it be considered a
technicality not to advise someone of the right to silence
and I see no basis for distinguishing among failure to advise
a person of any one of

those rights.

62
Inadvertence, like good faith, is irrelevant and
I would submit that none of the ~ for these reasons, none of
the modifications of Miranda, would be capable of
effectuating that decision, as each of them would swallow
the decision and I have yielded the rest of my time to the
Detroit Bar Association and Mr. Gribbs will address himself
to the experiences of the police in applying Miranda.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN 3. GRIBBS, ESQ.,
As Amicus Curiae, Supporting Respondent
MR. GRIBBS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As my brother counsel has indicated, I am
here on behalf of the Detroit Bar Association and have filed
an Amicus

brief in connection with issue number two that Is

presented by the Petitioner.

The brief speaks to that Issue

and I will limit my remarks to that issue and make them
fairly brief.
I would like to speak toward the rationale of
the Miranda decision ever so briefly and then the practical
results In the last seven and a half, eight years in
connection with Miranda and all of its implications.
Before I do, let me simply remind this Court,
that it is urged that the Court

step backwards into history

insofar as the practices and procedures required under

Petitioner alleges that Miranda is too restrictive
and thus urges this Court to allow the test to go back to the
totality of circumstances tested that had been operative
before Miranda.
Let me remind the Court that the Miranda warnings
were not all new in 1966,

One was added, the warning as to

a statement that is not to be used against an

the fact

that he need not make a statement was practiced before
Miranda — the fact that if he did and it was used, was
practiced before Miranda.

Escobedo established the practice

of an attorney and finally, Miranda said, "If you can't afford
It, the Court will appoint you an attorney," so that is the
four-fold statement and, of course, the requirements as to
waiver as was set forth, were clearly set forth to settle
that question.
QUESTION:

Mr. Grlbbs, which one do you say is the

only addition of Miranda?
MR. GRI3BS:
QUESTION:
MR. GRIBBS:

The last.
The fourth one?
Yes, the attorney appointed by the

court, although that Is not quite as clear, but assuming
Escobedo applied the fact that you can have an attorney
present and so construed and then the Hix^anda warning was

The rationale, may it please the Court, I am sure
is very well-known to this Court.

Let me simply point out

that what Miranda protects goes to the very roots of the
American criminal jurisprudence.

It puts life and meaning

into provisions that are in the Constitution.

What it really

does is put into the street, if you will, put into the police
station, the knowledge of the protective aspects of the
Constitution.

There are, as a result of .Miranda, and after

Miranda, confessions that are garnered in spite of the
Miranda warnings.

In the process of applying Miranda, the

court found expressly

in that case that, as my brother

counsel indicated, that other tests of measures to make those
that are uninformed aware of these rights and to prevent
police practices that were abrogating those rights, that
this was the minimum requirement before admissions or
confessions were allowed into court.
Court found that in-custody interrogations were
inherently coercive, be they physical or, in these modern
days, psychological, that there just is no contest between
the sophisticated police officer on this side and the
accused, that is, frightened, on this side.

It was really

an adversary and is an adversary proceeding every time that

there is an arrest, generally speaking, of course.
On one hand, we have Lieutenant latterson here
that is trained either, perhaps with a degree or years of
experience in interrogations and bringing out, if you will,
questions and answers that would incriminate.

On the other

hand, we have the accused that in all likelihood has no
education or very little and, certainly, no sophistication in
the rules of law,

that level, then, perhaps you could help me out.

What has

the impact of Miranda been?
MR. GRIBBS:
to, your Honor.

That is what I was about to speak

First — yes?

QUESTION:

Do you think it has deterred

admissions and confessions or not?
MR. GRIBBS:

Ever so slightly and in very-

insignificant fashion.
QUESTION:

And so it really wouldn’t make very

much difference whether it was overruled or not?
MR. GRIBBS:

No, I think it would make a great

difference because there are individual cases, I know, where
the warnings protect the innocent.
QUESTION:
MR. GRIBBS:

Sure, sure.
And that is the objective of the

law and that is the reason for the protective provisions in

the Constitution
QUESTION:

But you say the impact has been ever

so slight?
MR. GRIBBS:

Insofar as reducing the confessions

or admissions.
QUESTION:

I mean, if it has had a very slight

impact —
MR. GRIBBS:

Impact as to the number of confessions

that are introduced, may it please the Court, is what I
intended when I said that.

For example, a Pittsburgh study —

QUESTION:
MR. GRIBBS:

Well, what other impact has it had?
It has the Impact of professional­

ising the operations of the police department.

It has the

impact of advising individuals of their Constitutional rights
and in a number of cases, of voiding the use of their
admissions or confessions in their trial.
QUESTION:

Well, has it had the impact of

preventing some admissions that otherwise might have been
made?
MR. GRIBBS:
QUESTION:
MR, GRIBBS:

Yes.
A substantial -—
Well, in counting the numbers, we

can only cite what the surveys indicate and the numbers
indicate in one study in Pittsburgh, where there was a
reduction of about a third in the number of confessions

68
introduced;, there were no reductions — pardon me, there was
a one-half of one percent reduction in convictions in that
same court.
QUESTION:

Well, that isn!t what I am asking.

Do you have any evidence one way or another as
to whether or not it has prevented admissions or confessions
that otherwise might have been made?
MR. GRIBBS:
have been excluded.

Only the individual cases where they

But as to a study of the total

exclusions or not, we have just a few that are cited, in
general terms in the briefs.
For example, a study was conducted here in the
District of Columbia to determine the degree of increase or
decrease of interrogations after Miranda made in 568 and
cited in the Michigan Law Review and they said there was no
substantial variation in the number of interrogations here
in this area but that does not take away, certainly, and
there is no reason,, in fact, there is reason to retain the
Miranda rule for it does put life into individual cases and
it is not a deterrent to law enforcement as such.
The way to determine its impact on law enforcement
is to talk to those in law enforcement and there are state­
ments replete in the brief coming from prosecuting attorneys,
Mr. Younger, for one, who now joins the prosecutor in
opposing and filing a brief in opposition to Miranda but

several years ago, he stated as district attorney, that he
did not find any deleterious effects or impact as a result of
Miranda in his operations and likewise. Prosecutor Califf
in my area and I myself, may the Court please, have been in
law enforcement for some 12, 15 years as prosecuting attorney
and sheriff of William County, during this time of changing
of the rule.
Well, let me conclude, if I may, with just these
notations that in 1966 which I feel have bearing on the
practical impact of Miranda, in 1966 when this Court was
hearing the Miranda case, some 27 states joined in opposition
to the proposed then-Miranda Rule end they are cited in the
dissent.

Today you have but one brief joining the prosecuting

attorney in his urging that Miranda be overruled.
Miranda set standards that were minimal and to
be enforced, but they did not — and, in fact, the opinion
expressly says that if states so chose, as long as they met
the minimal standards, they could use a different means or a
mechanism to safeguard these standards.

To date,' not one

state has attempted to set up a different mechanism meeting
those same standards set forth in Miranda.
There is by indirection if not directly on
occasion, a reference in some of the briefs that"'be cause of
Miranda the increase in crime that has been reported over a
few years is the direct or indirect result of Miranda.

70

Well, the fact is that crime is going down in
many communities and in the City of Detroit, it has gone
down three years in a row.
In '72 It went down 16

In 571 it went down five percent

percent.

In *73 it has gone down

an additional five percent in round numbers.
So there is a decrease in crime in certain areas
So we urge, may It please the Court, that the rule not be
modified or rescinded.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Mr, Patterson, you have about six minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF L. BROOKS PATTERSON, ESQ.,
MR. PATTERSON;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court;
I’ll take the points raised by counsels for the
Respondent as they raised them serriatlm.
that

The first one

Mr. Mogill raised to the Court was a stipulation that

appeal’s in the brown Appendix on page 29 where, in his
formulation of the question, he said that we stipulated
that there was no independent source and says that there
could be no independent source and that is not our
stipulation.
Our stipulation was — I think as one of the
Justices indicated — was that we admit that we learned of
Henderson only through Tucker.

That is not to say that he

could not have come forward or would

not have come forward

71
on his own because of his knowledge of particular facts in
this particular case.
QUESTION:

But it is to say that the police had

no independent source.
MR. PATTERSON:

At that particular time, that is

right? Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
The next point raised by Mr. Mogill was that the
granting or failure to apply the fruit of the poisonous tree
doctrine to 'witness testimony would undermine the deterrent
purpose of that particular rule and I think there is a pre­
sumption here that the police are therefore going to go out
and violate Miranda in the

hopes of finding evidence of a

third independent witness type and then use him and that is
not a very good assumption to make'., the police are going to
deliberately violate the Miranda doctrine in the hopes of
finding a third witness which the rule doesn’t apply to.
Obviously, the police are going to try in all of
their interrogations to stay within their guidelines as the
police did in this particular case of interrogating Tucker in
April.
The — Mr. Mogill also indicated that Miranda
has not been harmful, as did Mr. Gribbs, that it has not
had any harmful effect.

They said there was no evidence as

such and Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointed out that here is a
case before

you where we have, I think, a detriment to

72
certainly the interests of justice as far as Ms. Corey is
concerned and the interests of the people of the State of
Michigan because we are here.
The Amicus brief that was filed with us

by the

International Association of Chiefs of Police on page 18 and
19 and 20 and 21 set forth nine or ten cases where the
Miranda —* a technical violation in how the rights were
administered resulted in a confession being suppressed and
the case either being dismissed or sent back for retrial, in
many instances tantamount to dismissal.
Mr. Gribbs, in his argument, said that the studies
showed that there has been no depreciable effect on law
enforcement and he cites the Pittsburgh study and in Pitts­
burgh, in that particular study, they called the remark that
Tucker gave an exculpatory statement and they didn’t include
that.

They said, well, we won’t consider that a statement or

admission or confession for purposes of this survey.

So that

report really is not applicable to the situation of this
case.
QUESTION:

But I always assumed that the purpose

of the situation we are discussing was to make it very
difficult for Government to do things

to citizens and you

apparently want it very easy for Government to do things.
MR. PATTERSON:

No, your Honor, I have no

intention of ever violating or would ever propose to come

before this Court said suggest that we would want to compel
somebody to be a witness against himself in a criminal trial.
I do not see that that is the situation in this particular
instance.

I safeguard the Constitution and the Bill of Right:

as much as any lawyer and any member of this Bar.

But I do

not feel at all dirtied by coming into Court and having a
proper statement to present to a jury that is tantamount to
a confession.

I think that is proper evidence.

It has

always been regarded by all the courts of this land as always
being reliable form of evidence which is good evidence to
present by way of a trial on the merits of the case.
QUESTION:

Which is not In this case.

MR. PATTERSON:

Nos it is not.

It is further

removed when it is a confession or an admission of guilt
because the evidence we are trying to preserve is that of an
independent witness and Mr. Mogill here says that you should
not draw any distinction between an independent Witness and
a direct statement from the accused and I think that you have
to see the distinction just on its faces the fact that this
witnesss and also all the reasons I enunciated in my argument
in chiefs could have come forward* might have been discovered
He Is a human being with all the interaction of his
characteristics.
QUESTION:

-- Miranda liras a prophylactic one to

perhaps act as a deterrent to the kind of interrogations that

74
shouldn't take place and to stop Interrogation if the witness,
if the defendant who is in custody doesn't want to talk.

If

that is the purpose of Miranda, then I suppose that purpose
is substantially implemented if you say that you may not
interrogate him about other evidence, even though you never
intend to introduce his statement.
I suppose if you prevail here, the officers may
continue to interrogate the defendant in custody as long as
their purpose is to build their case through independent
evidence or through evidence that he leads them to.

So that

would be, certainly, quite a motive to continue to
interrogate.
MR. PATTERSON:

It would all depend on, I

believe, Mr. Justice White, on this Court’s ruling on the
question of how Miranda is going to be continued.

If the

Court continues that particular —
QUESTION:

But if you win this case, I take it

one way of putting it is that there is nothing wrong with
continuing to interrogate to attempt to get leads to other
evidence.
MR, PATTERSON;

No, I was starting to say that

as long as that provision of the Miranda case which is now
something that guides the performance of police is still in
force, namely, xtfhen he says he does not want to be interro­
gated, he wishes to exercise his right to remain silent —

75
and the police do stop.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the police continue to

interrogate and they say where is the gun or where were you
at a certain time and lie finally gives an answer and says,
"Wells

was with Henderson."
MR. PATTERSON:

Mr. Justice White, I am saying

;hat
QUESTION:

And you would say that that was

admissible.
I®. PATTERSON:
not

do that

new

No, 1 am saying the police do

and they would not do that as long as that

particular provision of the Miranda majority is still in
force, namely, that xsrhen he says, "I don't want to talk, ,!
the police are instructed to stop their interrogation at that
point and allow him to exercise his rights.
QUESTION:

Well, just from the point of view? of

the police's own interest, I suppose if they did what
Justice White is suggesting to you they would do, they would
give up all chance of using a confession that the man might
make.
MR. PATTERSON:

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist and

that is the point I was making.

I think it presupposes that

they are going to deliberately violate the warnings that
are required to be given and so forth in the hopes of finding
independent evidence.

76
QUESTION:

Even though they won't be able to use

the confession anyway.
MR. PATTERSON:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

And then if they quit interrogating,

he certainly isn’t going to give one, so they still have a
motive to seek other evidence.
MR. PATTERSON:

Yes, Mr. Justice, but, in fact,

they do stop and they do obey in the great majority of the
time, as many times as we have influence on them, the
proscriptures that 'have been delineated in the Miranda
decision.
QUESTION:

Mr. Patterson, you are still malting

a distinction, I take it,

between the interrogation that

produces a pistol as Justice White suggested and the
interrogation that leads to finding a witness who then comes
into the courtroom to testify under oath.
MR. PATTERSON:

Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.

That is the premise of our whole second issue that we have
briefed and argued.
QUESTION:

But there is still questioning that

could keep on regardless of the man’s saying he didn't want
to talk any more on the theory that If he got enough and
the man made the mistake of taking the witness stand, he could
use it.
MR. PATTERSON:

Mr. Justice Marshall—

77
QUESTION:

Wouldn't that be an incentive for him

to continue?
MR. PATTERSON:

No, Mr. Justice Marshall, because

as we indicated also in our opening arguments, we feel that a
totality of circumstances approach to evaluating interrogation
would cover that type of situation.
QUESTION:

And you say that when he says, "I

don’t want to talk any more,'1 you cut it off?
MR. PATTERSON:
QUESTION:

Right, and I ™~

Didn’t he say that when you first

started questioning him?

I mean, he is not talking voluntarily

from the beginning.
Right?
MR. PATTERSON:

I respectfully disagree.

If he

has been advised of his rights and he is making a statement,
he is talking voluntarily.
QUESTION:

Well, I mean, before you advise him,

he doesn't want to be advised of his rights, he’d rather you
■leave him alone.
MR. PATTERSON:

Well, he’d rather not be arrested,

I would say.
QUESTION:

Well, that’s —

MR. PATTERSON:

Thank you, Mr. Justice.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Mogill, you

appeared by the Court’s appointment in this case and on

78
behalf of the Court 3 I want to thank you for your assistance
not only to your client, but to the Court.
MR. MOGILL:

Thank you., Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen,

the case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:00 o’clock p.m.s the case
was submitted.]
