MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-52S4, Dorssynski against the United States.
Mr. Friebert, you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT II. FRIEBERT, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FRIEBERT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please

the Court:
My name is Robert Friebert, and I represent the
petitioner, Douglas Raymond Dorssynski.

The respondent is

the United States of America.
This case involves a petition for certiorari to
the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and this case
originally arose out of an appeal from the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, the
Honorable Myron L, Gordon presiding.
The issue involves an interpretation of the Federal
Youth Corrections Act, and iii particular the issue involves
the procedural requirements which must be met before a youth
offender can be sentenced as an adult.
The Act, on the particular point in question,
states as follows:

And this is Title 18, 5010(d):

"If the court shall find that the youth offender
will not derive benefit from treatment under the Act" — I

4
paraphrase there — "then the court may sentence the youth
offender under any other applicable penalty provision."
Synthesised further, then, the issue before the
Court here is whether a sentencing court, sentencing a youth
offender, who is a defendant under the age of 22, must
articulate its findings of no benefit on the record? and,
further, when the sentencing court must support that finding
with reasons.
The facts are as follows s
The petitioner, Douglas Dorssynski, was convicted
of possession of LSD, in violation of 21 USC 844(a), at a time
when he was 19 years old.

lie was no longer a juvenile, but

he was subject to the provisions of the Federal Youth
Corrections Act.
The particular charge involved was a misdemeanor,
subjecting him to a maximum penalty, were he simply an adult,
to one year in jail or prison.
Petitioner pled guilty.

The trial court sentenced

the petitioner to a split sentence of 90 days in jail to be
followed by a probationary period, outside of jail, for
two years.
At the time of his arraignment and his plea of
guilty, he was not told that he could be sentenced under the
Federal Youth Corrections Act for a period of control in
essence of about six years, with four years.in prison.

5
At the sentencing proceeding, the trial court never
mentioned the Federal Youth Corrections Act, when it imposed
its sentence as an adult.

Past-trial motions were filed,

which challenged the adult sentence, and challenged it in
particular on the grounds that the trial court had made no
findings on his reasons why he rejected a sentence under the
Federal Youth Corrections Act.
At the time of the post-trial motions, the
sentencing court stated that the Act was not applicable, and
he further stated that he, when he sentenced the youth
offender as an adult, that there was an implied finding on
his behalf.

And he said no more.

The Court of Appeals agreed that the trial judge
did not have to explain his reasons in any way as to why he
did not sentence under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, why
he made a finding of no benefit under the Act, and affirmed
this aspect of the case.
QUESTION s

I have the impression that somewhere

in the record the United States Attorney had referred to
the Youth Act.

Was that at the arraignment?

MR. FRIEBERT:
at the arraignment.

Yes,

The Act was referred to twice

It was under the provisions of the Code,

the defendant had stated that he was going to plead, guilty
and a pre-sentence investigation was done before he came into
court.

So the proceedings at the arraignment were also a

6

sentencing proceeding with benefit of a pre-sentence report.
The United States Attorney, in court, stated that
the defendant was a youth offender and subject to the Youth
Offenders Act, but he did not state that the Youth Offenders
Act subjected the petitioner to a potential four years'
incarceration.
This was followed by the same Assistant United
States Attorney stating that the penalty maximum was one
year, vrhich was an incorrect statement of the law under the
circumstances, because the maximum penalty was six years in
actuality; and then the judge made that statement, and
further emphasised the one-year maximum to the petitioner.
After the plea of guilty was entered, the court
recessed to consider the pre-sentence investigation report,
which had been previously prepared.
Upon reconvening, the Federal Youth Corrections
Act was mentioned the second time, and that was by the
petitioner's counsel at that time, who asked that probation
be given to the petitioner and that this probation be under
the Federal Youth Corrections Act.
The trial court then imposed the sentence, the
split sentence of 90 days in custody, to be followed by two
years' probation, without in any way commenting upon the
Federal Youth Corrections Act.
The only time the trial court commented on the Act

7
was in the post-conviction hearing, when he said that a
finding that the Act was inapplicable could be implied from
the record in the case.

And he stated no reasons in the post-

trial, post-conviction hearings, either.
QUESTION:

Which you've already said -- at least

I thought I heard you say, that if he had been sentenced under
the Youth Corrections Act he might have got as much as six
years .
MR. FRIEBERT:

Correct.

That's correct.

QUESTION: All right.
MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

Which leads to —

Mr. Friebert, before you carry on,

suppose the court had stated, either on the record or in its
order, that it found that the youth offender would not benefit
from the remedies provided by the Act, but stated no reasons
for his finding, what would your position be?
MR. FRIEBERT:

Mr. Justice Powell, I would still

be here, saying that that was an insufficient record, that
he would have to support his finding with appropriate
reasons.
The record in this case demonstrates perhaps why —
QUESTION:
MR. FRIEBERT:

But what is it that you base that on?
He has to gain the potential

created by Congress in 5021 of Title 18, that upon an early
discharge from probation, that his conviction will be wiped

8

from his record and -that he will

■

QUESTION: Well, I know, but suppose it goes back
for resentencing under the Youth Corrections Act.
MR. PRIEBERT;

Yes.

QUESTION: What kind of sentence may the judge
impose?
MR. FRIEBERT:

On this record, I don't think, in

light of North Carolina vs. Pearce, and everything else, that
he'd be able to do anything but probation, unless he could
support that with intervening circumstances.

So probation

would be the only thing in the picture under the particularfacts of this case.
QUESTIONs Well, suppose he had

I gather your

position isn’t merely because of his age, that the district
judge had first to determine that the Youth Corrections Act
was inapplicable.

You don’t say that, do you?

MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

No, I — yes, I say —

You do?

MR. FRIEBERT:

— that the word "inapplicable” is

indicating that
QUESTION: Well, what you say, then, is that on the
plea being entered, the judge had, initially, to determine
whether he should apply the Youth Corrections Act?
MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

Correct.

And if he had decided that he should,

9
then what sentence could the judge have imposed?
MR. FRIEBERT :

He could impose probation under the

Act, he could commit him as a youth offender under the Act,
and as that commitment potential which puts him in a position
of facing four years —
QUESTION;

That’s the six years?

MR. FRIEBERT:

Yes.

QUESTION: That's the six years you're talking
about?
MR. FRIEBERT:

That's correct.

But probation is

available under the Federal Youth Corrections Act
QUESTION: Then I gather the argument of counsel
would have been, had the judge considered it and decided to
sentence under the Youth Corrections Act, counsel would —
what? — have argued nothing but probation for this?
MR. FRIEBERT:

Sure, that's what counsel argued,

probation under the Act.
The confusion, I think, in this record demonstrates
a serious question of whether the Federal Youth Corrections
Act was really considered by the trial judge.

The petitioner

is not properly advised as to the potential penalties which
he faced, which leads to a postulation, at least, that there
might have been confusion among the defense attorney and
everybody.
QUESTION:

If the district judge — it's up to the

.10

district judge to decide whether he should sentence under
the Youth Corrections Act, after making a determination of
benefit and so forth, if he does, and I gather that the
defendant, having pleaded guilty, he can't control vjhat the
judge does in that respect, can he?
MR. FRIEBERT;

I think that the Federal Youth

Corrections Act creates a policy by Congress that when a
youth offender is convicted, that the options available to a
sentencing judge are circumscribed by the Act.

He must

start out by favoring a sentence under the Act. Because
that is a favored position that the youth offender is in
by reason of his very age.
QUESTION: And so that if he decides that it would
benefit the defendant by sentencing him under the Act, that
he

must sentence under the Act, he has no option then to

sentence as an adult?
MR. PRIEBERT:
slightly:

I -would change the language

if he makes no finding, or if he has doubts, or

if he doesn't even consider it, the sentence must be under
the Act.

That the only time an adult sentence can be given

is if he makes a specific finding of no benefit.
QUESTION: With reasons.
MR. PRIEBERT:

With reasons, that's correct.

So I would ■— he does not, in my -QUESTION:

Does the legislative history to the Act

11
indicate that that's what the Congress intended?
MR. FRIEBERT:

I don't believe the legislative

history demonstrates that this issue was considered at all.
What the legislative history —
QUESTION:

What did Judge Phillips testify to, and

several other federal judges, including the Chairman of the
Committee of the Judicial Conference?
MR. FRIEBERT;

Those judges and those gentlemen

at the time, Mr, Chief Justice, indicated that this would not
— the Federal Youth Corrections Act would not have any
change in the traditional sentencing patterns given to a
sentencing judge.
I don't believe that those statements demonstrate
any consideration of the issue involved in this case.
That is the principal position of the government,
that somehow a statement of — that this doesn’t change
traditional sentencing alternatives of a sentencing judge,
•magically changes its form into a statement that a trial
judge is not required under this Act to state reasons.
In fact, the traditional sentencing prerogatives of
a court at no time gave a trial judge unfettered discretion
xtfithout any review of his discretion.
QUESTION;

The —

Well, is it your position, then, that

if the legislative history you don't feel is compelling, that
we must abide just the actual language of the statute?

12

MR. FRIEBERT;

Yes.

The actual language —

QUESTION; Well, where in the actual language of
the statute do you find the requirement that the trial judge
give reasons?
MR. FRIEBERT:

In the word of art, "shall find".

I think the phrase and the word "find" is a legal word of art,
which is not in any x*;ay confusing to anyone.

It means

findings and supported by reasons, because that is the way
I believe that lawyers communicate with each other. "If the
court shall find that the youth offender will not derive
benefit"

means just that.

He shall make a finding and

support it with reasons,
QUESTION:

Well, supposing in the analogous

provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure, where it says
that a court must make findings of fact and conclusions of
law, certainly a judge who makes a finding of fact that a
particular event occurred at a particular time isn't required
in addition to give you the reasons why he reached that
finding.
MR. FRIEBERT:

I think it's implicit in the record

that might be before the court as to whether his findings
conform with the evidence which was before him.
If you have a sentencing proceeding, you have
nothing but a most barren record.

All you have is a charge,

a pre-sentence report, and a judge not saying anything.

13
QUESTION: Well, there are a lot of pre-sentence
reports that aren't so barren.
MR. FRIEBERTs

Yes, there are, Mr. Justice White,

but that doesn't even indicate that the trial judge relied
upon the pre-sentence report.
QUESTION:

He said nothing.

Well, I know, but as Mr. Justice

Rehnquist says, strictly a finding of fact in an ordinary
trial doesn't necessarily have to refer to any evidence, or
even — it just has no reasons.
MR. FRIEBERT:

I believe and it's our position

that when the statement that the court shall find, with a
barren record such as we have here, that it must support its
findings. And that position —
QUESTION: Well, I gather, though, Mr. Friebert,
this is because — I now understand you ~ you derive this
out of paragraph (d).

Your position is that there must be

a sentence under the Youth Corrections Act unless a finding
that the offender will not derive benefit, found under (d),
is made„
MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

Is that it?

MR. FRIEBERTs
QUESTION:

Correct.

That is my position.

And your basic proposition is that

there must be a sentence under the Youth Corrections Act,
unless this finding is made, and there must be a record in

14

the form of a finding supported by reasons.
MR. FRl'EBERT:
QUESTION;

Correct.

In order that, on judicial review,

if the sentence is under some other penalty provision, it
can be said whether the sentencing judge erred or not? is
that right?
MR. FRIEBERT;

That is correct.

I might state that the government does not seem
to fervently argue that this should not be a record.

In

fact, they state that, at pages 48 and 49 of their brief,
that they would not oppose a requirement for an express
finding that the youth offender would not benefit under the
Act.
And this Court —
QUESTION;

Oppose that by whom, by Congress?

MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

By Congress?

MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION;

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

No.

The finding?
A requirement —

MR. FRIEBERT: The requirement of a finding.

I

first start with the proposition that the word "find" is a
legal word of art and that that is a statement of Congress.
QUESTION:
else.

No, no, I'm directing it at something

I'm directing it at your statement that they have

conceded that they would not object to such a requirement.

15
MR. FRIEBERTs

Yes.

QUESTIONs Do you construe that to mean they
wouldn't object if Congress wrote a statute that way, or a
court construed it that way, or what?
MR. FRIEBERTs

I think in the context of their

position is that if this Court were to establish such a
policy they would not oppose it.
QUESTIONS

Well, we don't establish policies, we

construe statutes.
MR, FRIEBERTs

And this Court also establishes

policies in the light of North Carolina vs. Pearce, to
effectuate an increased penalty, there must be a record with
findings to support an increased penalty after a defendant
has been reconvicted after reversal of his original
conviction.
That enforces a policy, a constitutional policy,
[sic]
Specht vs. Morrissey, x^hich is another sentencing proceeding,
in which a Colorado Sex Crimes Act was imposed as a sentence
after a conviction, this Court said that that type of
commitment, namely as a sex offender, required an additional
finding, and that therefore the sentencing judge cannot just
commit as a sex offender, even though he had been convicted
of a crime; but he must make the new finding, he must
support the new finding after notice and a hearing, and he
must state his reasons on the record as to why he made that

16

finding, so that it would be subjected properly to appellate
review.
QUESTION $ Did I understand you to say before that
if -this case went back, if you prevail and the case went
back, 'that he could not now be sentenced under the Youth
Corrections Act to any greater or different sentence from
the one that was imposed, that is 90 days plus probation.
MR. FRIEBERT:

Yes, I think that then the trial

judge runs across North Carolina vs. Pearce.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION;

Well, —
It's an increased benefit.

«•«* then the Youth Corrections Act

would be frustrated, wouldn't it?
MR. FRIEBERT:

No, I don't, think the Youth

Corrections Act would be frustrated, —
QUESTION:

Well, could you give him six years?

MR. FRIEBERT;
his 90 days; after

No.

The man has served, in fact,

he is now presently on probation.

We have not sought any stay pending a review by this Court.
The judge, what we would ask him to do is to
sentence him under 5010(a) to probation, under the Federal
Youth Corrections Act.

And that that would be the sentence

which we would be seeking which would not in any way frustrate
any of the policies enunciated previously, and is probably
the roost appropriate sentence under the facts of the case.

17
QUESTION! Well, what different position would he
be in than he is now, if that's all he had to do?
MR. FRIEBERT;

He would be able to have his

conviction wiped from the record, were he ~~
QUESTION:

Yes, I see.

MR. FRIEBERT:

discharged from probation at the

— prior to his completion of his probation period.

It's a

substantial benefit.
QUESTION:

Yes, and he would a different --

QUESTION:

That wouldn't be automatic.

MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION;

I'm sorry?

Excuse me.

QUESTION: That wouldn't be automatic.
MR. FRIEBERT:

No.

It would be automatic if he

were released from probation prior to the completion of his
probation period.

That would be 5021, I believe,

(b).

QUESTION: And he would be in different hands during
probation?
MR. FRIEBERT?

He would be in the hands of the

Probation Department, the same Probation Department that would
take him, whether he * s on probation under the Act or not.
QUESTION:

The same people?

MR, FRIEBERT?

Yes.

QUESTION: The same standards?
MR. FRIEBERT:

I believe so

I don't knew of any

18
standards that differ.

It would be with the Probation

Department of the Eastern District of Wisconsin.
So that the substantial — the substantial benefit
in this case is the ability to obtain an ending of the
incumbrance of his previous conviction.

And that's the

substantial benefit which the Act provides,, one of the
substantial benefits that happens to be, in this particular
case, the substantial benefit which brings us to tills Court.
And that being a substantial benefit, being a
substantial congressionally mandated benefit, is in fact a
right that he has, unless the Court, makes a finding of no
benefit.

And there was no such finding.
And since the finding of no benefit is the equivalent

of taking away a substantial congressionally created right,
then it's our position that both in this case —
QUESTION: Well, Mr. Friebert, if you prevail in
this and the case goes back, what's to stop the district
judge, then, from considering whether he derived benefit,
and arriving at conclusions with reasons that he wouldn't,
and then things stay just as they are?
MR. FRIEBERT:

Then we would be able to have a

determination as to whether those were appropriate reasons
under the Act.
QUESTION:
another review?

Which means

so you'd then have

1!)

MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

Perhaps.

But you also insist on a hearing in

connection with the determination.
MR. FRIEBERTs

Yes, the hearing ~~ I don't mean to

overstate that prospect. The hearing —
QUESTION:

Yes, but you would — you think there's

something involved here other than an ordinary sentencing
procedure.
MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

That you should then have a chance to

cross-examine a witness or present some evidence?
MR. FRIEBERT:

Perhaps present evidence.

so sure about cross-examining witnesses.

I'm not

In fact, the

government —QUESTION: But you would think he would not be per­
mitted to rely on an uncross-examined pre-sentence report.
MR. FRIEBERT:

I don't think there is, as a

practical matter, I've read this pre-sentence report, it's
not a part of this record, there is nothing that would affect
•chat in this —
QUESTION:

But if there were, I can imagine what

your position would be.
MR. FRIEBERT:

Yes, if the trial judge is going to

rely upon a statement in the pre-sentence report, involving
a witness or another person with which we disagree with,

\
20
I think we would have the right and the prerogative to
challenge that,, and I don't think that Wi 11 iams vs. New York
touches on that issue whatsoever.

Williams is the case

apparently principally relied upon by the government.
In Williams, the only challenge was that a sentencing judge
who had imposed the death sentence instead of life
imprisonment, after a jury came in with a recommendation of
life imprisonment, whether the defense had a right to totally
cross-examine and be confronted by the witnesses on evidence,
or statements which appeared in the presentence report.
QUESTION:

I have another problem.

Are you going

to use beyond a reasonable doubt, or what are you going to
use as your standard?
MR. FRIEBERT:
CHJESTION:
means hearing.

I think the court — I don't —

I personally don't see why a finding

I think you can make findings without a

hearing.
MR. FRIEBERT:

Well, it's got to be, I believe,

Mr. Justice Marshall, some kind of record.
QUESTION: Well, I would say a pre-sentence report
which shows that in the 30 years of this man's adult life
he's been in jail 29 years and a half, I don't think I
have to need a hearing to make findings.
Do you?
MR. FRIEBERT;

Perhaps.

It depends — first of

21
all, you have to be 22 years —
QUESTIONS

Do you?

MR. FRXEBERTs

Oh, there might be.

There might be

some basis for challenging the validity of the statement
in the pre-sentence report that — and a challenge of the
accuracy of it.

The District of Columbia Court of Appeals

has —
QUESTION:

I don't have any -- I'm saying that

this is a pre-sentence report, and it. says what I said,
29 and a half of his 30 years he's been in jail.

And you

say that is not enough, by itself, standing as if is alone,
for the judge to make a finding that this man is unfit.
MR. PRIEBERT;
that.

That's correct.

And several reasons why.
QUESTION:

I would challenge

Perhaps the —

I didn't use the word "perhaps" with

it.
MR. PRIEBERT:

Well, perhaps the defendant challenges

the statement as not being a fact.
QUESTION:

I said there was nothing else there but

that.
MR. FRIEBERT:

And the defendant says it's not true.

He hasn't been in prison 29 and a half out of 30 years.
He's entitled, I would think, to a hearing.
QUESTION: And what would the hearing be?
MR. FRIEBERT:

To determine whether that's true or

22

not.
QUESTIONt Well, what would the hearing be?
MR. FRIEBERT:

The hearing might be to -- if

there has been a mistake in the report, there's been a name
identification problem, the fingerprints are -QUESTION;

Then all you could do would be to

attack the finding.
MR. FRIEBERTs

Attack the fact.

The factual basis

of the finding.
QUESTION; The finding is the fact.
MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

Of 29 and a half years?

Right.

MR. FRIEBERT:

Yes.

He attacks that finding by

the Probation Department as not being true, correct.
QUESTION:

It would be your burden then, wouldn't

it?
MR. FRIEBERT:

Perhaps.

I don't know whose burden

it would be.
QUESTION:

I give up!

You'll agree on something

one of these days, without "perhaps".
MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

Well, I think I -- excuse me.

If I could interrupt for a moment.

Just on its face, subsection (d) seems to be triggered,
namely, the necessity for a finding seems to be triggered
only if the court proceeds under (b) or (c) .

23

MR. FRIEBERT:

No.

I think — the way I read the

entire 5010 ~«*
QUESTION:

This defendant was put on probation.

MR. FRIEBERT:

Correct.

Without any statement.

QUESTION: Well, I know, but what's the reference to
(b) or (c)?

There's an (a) here that speaks about probation.

MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

Correct.

And. (b) or (c) doesn't seem to

(d)

speaks only of (b) or (c).
MR. FRIEBERT:

Correct.

But it is the ~~ it is

the triggering device for bringing a youth offender into a
sentence as an adult.
QUESTION:

But (assays, quite independently, if

the court is of the opinion that the youth offender does not
need commitment, it may suspend the imposition or execution
of sentence.
Now, (d) , which you're relying on, has no reference
whatever to (a) .
MR. FRIEBERT:

Yes, that \70uld — that raises an

issue which I raised in the Seventh Circuit and which has
been uniformly rejected by every Circuit Court that has seen
it to date, as far as I know, and that is that there is only
one kind of probation under the Act.

Namely, if a youth

offender is placed on probation, he's automatically under the
Act.

24
I point that out at page 21 of ray brief, in the
footnote t that the iss'ae has been rejected? if that is a
correct interpretation, then he is on probation and under
the Act now.

In which case, the issue which I bring to you

is not here.
But

--

QUESTION:

That might require some other lawsuit,

but not this one.
MR. FRIEBERT:

But the general, at least consensus

is, of which I disagree, is that you can make a finding of
no benefit and go to an adult sentencing proceeding and put
the defendant on probation.
QUESTION:

Well, as a matter of fact, from what

you told me earlier, that as you now see it (d) — initially
tiie trial judge has to sentence under the Act, unless he
makes the finding called for by (d).
MR. FRIEBERT:

Correct.

And that sentencing under

the Act is either an (a) , (b) , or (c) sentence; either
probation, commitment, or (c), which is not applicable,
which would be extended commitment.
And without the finding under (d), that is his
opinion and nothing more.
QUESTION: Well, yes, but the thing that (d) speaks
about is treatment.
MR. FRIEBERT:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Treatments under (b) or (c) , and you

don't ordinarily think of this probationary period under the
same probation officers as an adult would be, as a youth
offender treatment.
MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

It is a youth —

That's why (d), it seems to me, speaks

of treatment, and it speaks of (b) or (c) .
This probation is under the same probation officers
as an adult would be under.
MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

Correct.

Under the same conditions.

MR. FRIEBERT:

that's tailored to anything special about the Youth Offender
Act.
MR. FRIEBERT:

It's a probation that is tailored

with an end result to be beneficial.

Yes, but it isn't treatment.

But it

isn't treatment.
MR. FRIEBERT: Well, I believe probation is
treatment.

Corrections — youth offender treatment.
MR. FRIEBERT:

It is

offense, a sentencing judge who believes a youth offender

you call that treatment.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD P. NORTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. NORTON:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think at the outset it would be useful to focus
on what the issues before the Court are today.
There has been a lot of discussion about the nature
of the hearing that must be held if this matter goes back
for resentencing, whether the judge were to reach the same
result after making a finding and statement of reasons,
whether that would be subject to appellate review.
The original issue raised by the petitioner in
the District Court was whether he could have been sentenced
under provisions other than the Youth Corrections Act,
where the trial judge had not made an explicit finding to

21

the effect that he would not derive benefit from treatment
under section 5010(b) or (c) of the Youth Corrections Act.
QUESTION;

Do we know, Mr. Morton, under

whether the trial judge at any time said "I am not going to
sentence under the Youth Corrections Act"?
MR. NORTON; The sequence was this;

The U. S.

Attorney mentioned, at the commencement of the arraignment,
that the case was one to which the Act might be applicable.
Petitioner's original attorney requested that he be sentenced
under the ACt, and asked for probation under the Act.
The judge, when he imposed the split sentence involving
probation under section 3651 of Title 18, did not make any
reference at that time to tine Act.
QUESTION;

So we ~ well —

MR. NORTON; At a later point, when tine *—
QUESTION; So at the time of sentence, in any
event, he did not say "I'm sentencing under the Act" or "I'm
not sentencing under the Act"?
MR. NORTON;

That's correct.

QUESTION; Right.
MR. NORTON; And then at a later point, when the
sentence was challenged, he ruled that he disagreed with
the District of Columbia cases that said that there had to be
an explicit finding, and his determination that petitioner
should not be sentenced under the Act was essentially implicit

28

in his sentencing him as an adult under probation.
QUESTION:

So he interpreted what he did at the

time of sentence as an interpretation *— as a sentence
outside the Act?
MR. NORTON:

That’s right.

QUESTION: Right.
MR. NORTON: And the Court of Appeals held that it
was not necessary under the Act for an explicit finding in
the words of 5010(d) , that he will not derive benefit from
treatment to be made.
QUESTION:

Didn't I understand your friend to say

that the sentencing hearing and the preliminary hearing
were at the same time, that this was a telescoped proceeding?
MR. NORTON;

Yes, there was a recess, but I

think it was —
QUESTION;

A rule 10 hearing is when he was

actually sentenced. - They didn’t go from preliminary hearing
to arraignment and then to sentencing here, did they?
MR. NORTON:

No, this was a case in which •—

QUESTION: This was telescoped.
MR. MORTON:

— the information was presented

at the time of arraignment and it was previous to the —
QUESTION: And that’s where the discussion of the
Youth Corrections Act occurred by the United States Attorney?
MR. NORTON:

That's correct

29

QUESTION:

So that ~

MR. HORTON: And also by petitioner’s own attorney.
QUESTION:

Yes.

So that there’s no question that

the subject matter of the Youth Corrections Act was brought
to the attention of the judge at that time?
MR. NORTON:

That's correct, no dispute.

The petitioner has referred to the fact that he was
not advised by the judge at the time of sentencing about the
possibility that, if he had been sentenced to treatment under
5010(b) , he might be subject to commitment for up to four
to six years.
Now, if he had in fact received such treatment,
he might have an issue, but he did not, and that is not an
issue that he has pursued in this case.
QUESTION:

Yes, there is one case in the District

of Columbia Circuit where, on a guilty plea, a sentence was
imposed under the Youth Corrections Act, and it was reversed
on appeal because it had not been disclosed to him that there
was a six-year potential under that Act, as distinguished
from ~
MR. NORTON:
QUESTION;

Yes, in the Carter case, —
Is that Carter?

MR. NORTON:
there was really twofold:

I'm aware of that? and the question
one question was whether the

defendant had been informed of that possibility, and the

30

Court found that the record was not clear, and they sent it
back for further determination.

The other issue was —* it's

rather a typical case, in that all of the litigation under
the Youth Act, until very recently, presented a defendant
who was sentenced under the Youth Act, complaining about it,
saying that "I should have been sentenced under the adult
provisions", because it might have been a misdemeanor, as
in tliis case, subject to six months or three months or
one year maximum.
And then they were subjected to a longer period.
On the question of whether an explicit finding
must be made, let me correct the statement of what the
government’s position is.
We do not, in our brief, concede that it would be
appropriate for the Court to impose a requirement of an
explicit finding, as petitionerseeks, that the defendant will
not derive benefit treatment under the Act.
What we have said is that if the Court were to

,
/

require that there be some indication in the record that the
Act has been considered, as there is in this case, then
that is sufficient, and we would not oppose that.
But we do not agree that there should necessarily
be any requirement of a formal finding, in the words of the
statute, or in any other particular manner.
It may be sufficient if the pre-sentence report

31

indicates that possibility, or if it’s referred to by counsel,
or the judge makes some reference to it.
QUESTION:

Is there any shewing in the record that

on the day of sentence the judge did or did not consider
this, on that day?
MRe NORTON: Well, the -- yes, it was — idle
proceedings occurred, if I’m not mistaken, on the same day.
The arraignment and
QUESTION: What time span was in that?
MR. NORTON:

I'm not sure.

There was —

QUESTION: The reason I'm asking ~~
MR. NORTON:

-— a recess while he studied the

pre-sentence report, and I'm just not sure how long.
QUESTION: Well, I still have grave problems as to
whether he — I mean I'm perfectly willing to assume he did.
But wouldn't it be better if the record showed that "I have
considered this, and I find that this man does not qualify
for it, and therefore I'm not going to give it to him”;
just one little sentence.
You don’t even want to agree to that much?
MR. NORTON: Well, we — we say that there may be —
there are reasons that such a requirement might be
desirable; but, on the other hand, some courts have noted
that there are reasons why it may be undesirable for the
court to state

32

QUESTION: Nell,, how do you show that he wade a
finding?

How do you show that?
MR, NORTON:

Well, just as you show in many other

instances that a finding has been made, -QUESTION:
MR, NORTON:

Like what?
— where it is a precondition to

further action.
QUESTION:
MR, NORTON:

Like what?
It is implicit in 'the alternative

action taken by the court.

Judges, no less than governmental

agencies,are entitled to a presumption of regularity.

And

if they — if this statute were to be construed as —
QUESTION:

If we overdo that presumption of

regularity in criminal cases, God help the Fifth Amendment,
MR, NORTON: Well,
QUESTION:

We look at it every day and examine it

as to whether it's right or wrong,
Why do you object to the requirement, requiring
tiie judge to say “I find that -this man is not entitled to
it"?

Why do you object to that requirement?
MR, NORTON: Well, our position is not one of

objection to such a requirement, necessarily.

The position

that we have
QUESTION: Well, I thought here —
MR. NORTON: «—> asserted here is that —~

33

QUESTIONS So would you object to it or not?
QUESTION:

Well, I take it that you're not here

to state whether you object to something or not, you're
here to present the government's case and to answer argument
about what the government's position is.
QUESTION: Well, what is the government's position
as to whether or not the.judge should make a finding, in
quotes.
MR. NORTON; The statute provides that the judge
has four options under the Act, and it is our position that
Congress intended

and this is amply demonstrated by the

legislatix^e history of the judges who proposed the Act —
that the judge would have complete discretion in determining
how to sentence a youth offender.

And that the use of the

word "find” — it's not "finding", incidentally, it's "find"
* "if the court shall find that the defendant will not
derive benefit from treatment under the Act" was not meant to
circumscribe in any rigid fashion the discretion of the
sentencing judge,
That he had the same discretion that he has or had
prior to the Act, to sentence a defendant.
The legislative history we think makes that
abundantly clear.

Now, we have set forth in our brief at

some length the various comments of the sponsors.
QUESTION: So your ansx^er is he's not required to

34

make a finding?
MR. NORTON:

That's right.

I was speaking only

to the statement that we have made a concession.

Our

position is that the Act does not require any explicit
finding on the record.
But we would not strongly oppose some procedural
requirement to indicate for sure, just as prophylactic
measure, that the Act has been considered.
But that isn't the heart of this case.
QUESTION:’

Now, which answer do I get?

You said

that you did not think he had to make a finding, and now you
say he should,
MR. NORTON: Well, we’re saying that in some cases
it might be necessary to spell it out, and in others there
may be other indications in the record that would make an
explicit finding unnecessary.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr, Norton, does this record

show —* I'll go back to the question I put to you before
does this record show that on the day of the hearing, which
was both a hearing under Rule 10, or an arraignment, and a
sentencing hearing, that, before the judge went out to read
the pre-sentence report, both the prosecutor and the defense
counsel had discussed and called to the court's attention
the existence of the Youth Corrections Act?
MR. NORTON: The prosecutor had definitely, I am not

35

sure whether defense counsel's reference to it came before
or after the recess.
QUESTION: But, anway, it was before the judge
pronounced the sentence that both —MR. NORTON: That's correct.
QUESTION:

~ both counsel had called his attention

to this in oral argument.
MR, NORTON:

That’s correct.

QUESTION:

I can't --excuse me,

QUESTION:

Mr* Norton, in connection with that

question from the Chief Justice, on page 13 of the Appendix,
as I read it — I wish you'd see whether this is right or
not — following the recess, and after the parties had come
back into the court, counsel for the defendant, in the very
last thing he said to the court after stating the extenuating
circumstances, including the age and family situation of the
defendant, concluded by saying:

"And I would ask that he

be placed under production *— on probation under the Youth
Corrections Act."
And Hie court then proceeded with the formal
sentence.
MR. NORTON: That's correct.
recess.

And that was after the

The recess is indicated on —
QUESTION:

That was after the recess, and prior

to the recess the United States Attorney —

36

MR. NORTON:
QUESTION:

The prosecutor.
— said fco the judge, and this is on

page 6, that you "may also be subject to the Federal Youth
Corrections Act."
MR. NORTON: That's correct.
The recess is indicated at page 11, and then the
sentencing followed immediately thereafter.
QUESTION:

Wasn’t that -- didn't we hear earlier

that there was some misstatement that the Youth Correction
Act had a maximen sentence of one year?
MR. NORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. NORTON:

Well, —
I can't find that in the record here.
— the statement was that the

petitioner was asked if he was aware of the maximum penalty
for the offense.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. NORTON: And he stated, yes, it was one year.
And that is true, the maximum penalty provided under section
844 for this offense is one year.
QUESTION:
MR. NORTON:

Yes.
He contended at a later point that

his guilty plea should be set aside, because he was not
then informed that, under the Youth Corrections Act, had
he been sentenced under it, in lieu of imprisonment for one
year under that penalty provision, he might have been subject

37
to treatment for up to anywhere from four to six years;
where it may be a shorter period of time# but that is the
outer limits.
That attack on his plea has since been abandoned.
Now, I'd like to turn to the,, really a threshold
question which is:

Does the Youth Corrections Act limit or

restrict the discretion of the sentencing judges.
As I indicated earlier, the legislative history
of this Act, which was drafted by judges and supported in
Congress by judges, makes perfectly clear that no intention
to restrict the ordinary sentencing, through discretion <S
judges, was intended.
Judge Laws had stated, for example, that it would
be purely optional, not an absolute mandate, the judges
don't have to use it if they don’t want to*
Judge Phillips, likewise, said that it was purely
optional, and the judge would have absolute discretion in
sentencing.
Similar comments abound, and we have set them
forth in our brief at pages 16 to 24,
QUESTION: Well, I take it, then, Mr, Norton, ~~ or
is this the government's position

that you never get to

any of these issues under (d) or anything else under the
Youth Offender statute until the judge decides that he's
going to sentence under the section.

33

In other words, what you've been saying to us is
that the proponents of this legislation had no intention of
stripping the judges of authority to sentence under some
other panelty provisions if they didn't care to use this
Act.
MR. NORTON: That's correct, and that’s what
subsection (d) does, it provides that
QUESTION: Well, really, it seems to me when you
parse this statute down, it appears that (a), which permits
probation, the judge decides, Well, I'm going to sentence
under this Act, but I don't want to sentence under (a), I
don't want to give him probation, I think he ought to be
incarcerated for treatment, and so I'll sentence him under
either (b) or (c) ? and then (d) comes into effect, when he
decides, well, maybe he wouldn't derive any benefit from
treatment under (b) or (c) , and therefore I can sentence
under any other applicable penalty provision.
MR. NORTON: That's right.
QUESTION: Which would be under some other statute,
or might go back to (a), the probation.
MR. NORTON:

That's true.

We don't think that —

QUESTION: Well, if that's so, Mr. Norton, it just
strikes me that if the judge has the option to use this
statute or not, you don't get at any of these questions
until he decides he's going to use this statute.

39

MR, NORTON: Well# we don’t see that you have to
get into any of these questions at all.

The way the

procedural issues raised in this case have come up is because
some courts# notably the District of Columbia Circuit, have
read the Act differently than we read it.

They say, as

petitioner claims here, that it constitutes a binding mandate
to the district judges, in sentencing youth offenders, -QUESTION: Right,

And if we don't agree with

that position and agree with yours, that the judge was free
to use this or not, and that on this record he decided he
wouldn’t use this statute, why isn’t that the end of the
case?

Without ever getting to the question of whether

there would have to be findings under (d) or not?
MR. NORTON:
QUESTION;
MR. NORTON:

Well, that is our position, basically.
Yes.
But the case is —- the question

presented is one of whether such explicit findings are
required, and whether it must be accompanied by a statement
of reasons.
The legislative hisetory again, and indeed the
statute itself provides absolutely no support for the
argument that this statute, when enacted by Congress in 1950,
was intended to impose on sentencing judges any kind of
procedural requirements at all.
Now, the use of the word "find" in subsections (b),

40

(c) , and (d) is not equivalent to the use of the word
"findings" in statutes pertaining to administrative agencies,
or even in the provisions of the Rules of Procedure that
say a judge must make findings of fact.
It is essentially the same as saying if the judge
concludes, or is of the opinion, or believes that such~and~
such is the case, then it may do this.
And again the use of the word "may” is crucial here.
All of the options outlined in section 5010 have the word
"may" in them.

The judge "may do this", he "may do that",

he "may do" a third thing.
It is not like some sentencing statutes, which
have a clearly mandatory requirement.

For example, in the

narcotics addicts rehabilitation statute, which this Court
considered in the Marshall case, there if the judg first
takes the discretionary step of having a defendant who it
believes may be an addict committed for treatment and gets
a report on whether he might be subject to rehabilitation,
then if the court determines that he is an addict and he
might benefit from treatment for rehabilitation, then he
shall sentence him to treatment.

He has no discretion.

It is sharp contrast to this statute, which leaves
all of these options open to the judges' discretion.
Now, the

— as I said, the D. C. Circuit has gone

off on a different premise, and from that premise has said

41
that all of these procedural requirements of explicit
findings, a statement of reasons, and appellate review, are
essentially -QUESTION;

Was that the case where, on the record

it appeared — I haven’t read that decision

that it

appeared that in fact the sentencing was under this
statute?
MR. NORTON:

No, the D. C. Circuit cases have

all — the recent ones -- have all involved adult sentences.
Most of them have been robbery or murder cases.

The

defendant was sentenced as an adult, and appealed, either -maybe on a guilty plea, so the sentence may have been the
only issue before the court. And the court, in a series of
decisions, has elaborated a series of rules, which now require
that before a youth offender, which is anyone under 22, may
be sentenced as an adult, or
penalty

under any other applicable

provisions, the district judge has to make an

explicit finding that he will not derive benefit from treatment
under the Act, —
QUESTION:

Well then, is that under an

interpretation of this statute as the statute which must,
if applicable, be used in sentencing a youth offender?
MR. NORTON: That's right.

They have read the

statute as mandating preferential sentencing under the
Youth Offender statute.

42
QUESTION;

I see.

QUESTION;

Is that not the conflict on which,

at least,
MR. NORTON;
QUESTION:

That's correct.
— certioari was sought, whether it

governed our decision or not?
MR. NORTON;
QUESTION;

Yes.
That was the conflict raised in

addition to cert.
MR. NORTON:

That is the basic conflict between

the court below and the D. C. Circuit.
They do not — the D. C. Circuit, which was
recently joined, on a prospective basis only, by the Second
Circuit -- they do not suggest that the procedural
requirements are called for by the statute itself.

There

is simply no language that they could base any argument like
that on,
QUESTION:

Has the CambrelI case, in the Superior

Court of the District of Columbia, been reviewed by the local
Court of Appeals?

Do you know?

MR. NORTON:

I don’t know the current status, it

probably would not have been decided by now, since it was
in January only.
But what the Court of Appeals in the District has
said is that you cannot sentence someone other than under

43

the Act unless you find that he's so incorrigible that he
will not derive benefit.

And then, in order to implement

that mandate, they say that these other procedures follow.
Now, the drafters of this statute in 1950, I'm
sure nothing could have been further from their mind than
that in enacting the Youth Corrections Act they were imposing
on sentencing judges an elaborate structure of required
findings and statements of reasons, and now appellate review.
Which, in the District of Columbia, has become very
substantial.

It is very difficult for an adult conviction

to withstand -the kind of analysis that —
QUESTIONS

And it's appellate review now in the

District of Columbia Court of Appeals resther titan the United
States Court of Appeals?
MR. NORTON;

No, this is in the U. S. Court of

Appeals.
Recently, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
decided, in the Reed case, in December, Chief Judge Greene
said that they would no longer adhere to the D. C. Circuit's
rule as to appellate review.

So that is only in the U. S.

Court of Appeals.
But the Second Circuit has joined.
QUESTION;

Well, how about requiring a finding?

MR. NORTON; Well, in that same case —
QUESTION:

Hasn't that — haven't they said they

44

will require a finding?
MR. NORTON:

In the same ease, the Reed case,

Judge Reilly's opinion said that in some cases it may not
be necessary for the judge to make an explicit finding,
if, for example, he is called for a discretionary report
concerning how to treat the defendant or how to dispose
of the case, and if that report, under 5010 (e) recommends
an adult sentence, because the defendant would not benefit,
then in a case like that it is not necessary for the judge
to reiterate that.
And he expressed some reasons why it might be
detrimental if that were required.

He pointed out that by

not sentencing under the Youth Act, the judge does not
turn his back on rehabilitation.
correctional institutions.

That is a goal of all

It is of particular emphasis

in the youth corrections system, but it is also a goal in
other institutions.
So that you would disserve the potential for
rehabilitation if you were to, at the time of sentencing,
in effect, hit the defendant over the head with the judicial
pronouncement that yo*i will not derive any benefit from
rehabilitative treatment.
So that they have, to a limited extent, departed,
in that respect from the D„ C. Circuit rule.
QUESTION:

Thgn is the decision which the judge

45

makes at that time, the choice of options, basically
different in any way from the decision to place the
defendant, a convicted person, on probation or not to place
him on probation?
MR. NORTONj

Essentially, no, in that this is a

fun deman tal distinction between tills case and, say, the
Specht case.
In any sentencing situation, the judge has to
consider the potential for rehabilitation of the defendant,
because probation, unless it’s a case where there are
limitations, but in the main probation is one possibility.
Early release, early parole.
The elements that the judge takes into account are
very similar, so that you are not, in this statutory scheme,
calling upon the judge to consider factors that he would
not ordinarily consider in sentencing an adult.
QUESTIONS But when he sentences the defendant, after
reviewing the pre~sentence report and hearing the right of
allocation exercise, he imposes a sentence of two to six years
by implication, he has rejected probation; is that not so?
MR. NORTONs That’s certainly true.
Let me point out something else that stems from the
D. C. Circuit reading of the statute, which petitioner
supports.
If the statute were to be construed as giving the

46

judge discretion to chooce between -the Youth Act and the
other applicable provisions, only in the case where he finds
the defendant is incorrigible and will not derive benefit,
then, on the one hand, you have an absurd result, because
only if you have someone who is incorrigible does the judge
have the choice, as between Youth Act treatment and the
other possibilities; but, in addition, you unduly limit
the judge's flexibility because there may be other provisions
which would be even more beneficial to the defendant than
Youth Act treatment.
And this may well be such a case.

This may be

precisely what the judge had in mind.
Youth Act treatment involves the possibility of
commitment and restriction on liberty for up to six years.
This defendant, the petitioner, received a 90-day commitment
to a jail type institution, —
QUESTION:

He never was committed to the Attorney

General? For that purpose.
MR. NORTON: For that purpose, no.
QUESTION:

He was just put in a jail.

MR, NORTON: That's right.

And the sentence was

explicit, and this is under 3651, Title 18, followed by
probation.

Which, had he received the Youth Act sentence,

he would not have had the same assurance, and the judge would
nothave had the same assurance that after a dose of custody

47
he would be free.
QUESTION; Was this what the — is this what the
pre-sentence report recommended?
MR. NORTON;
QUESTION:

Or do you know?

I do not know.
You don’t know whether the pre-sentence

report recommended treatment as an adult?
MR. NORTON;

I'm not able to answer, I have not

seen it.
Let me mention one other alternative that has
particular application in this case.
Under 844, Title 21, the statute Linder which
petitioner was convicted, the judge has the discretion —
this is a case of a simple possession, first-time offender,
of a controlled substance.

The judge has the discretion to

sentence the defendant to probation for up to one year, and
if the defendant satisfactorily completes that probation,
then he is automatically entitled to have the proceedings
set aside and completely expunged, for all purposes? a far
more comprehensive relief than is available under the Youth
Corrections Act.

And it is mandatory.

In idle present case, let’s take petitioner's
scenario, if this Court were to reverse and send, it back for
resentencing, if he were sentenced under the Youth Correction:
Act, and if he received probation — and we don’t necessarily
agree that that is the only alternative on remand -— but if

43
he did receive such probation, he would not be entitled to
have his conviction set aside upon the completion of that
probation.
The only time he can have it set aside is if the
judge — the court, in its discretion, decides to discharge
him from probation prior to the term set, it's only for
premature or early release that this remedy is available.
So it is not mandatory, as it would have been under
844.

Yet, under petitioner's own argument, the District

Court would have been disabled from sentencing him under
844 unless he first concluded that he was incorrigible,
or will not derive benefit from treatment under (b) or (c).
Now, he might well have thought that, well, maybe
he'll derive some benefit, but it's not worth subjecting
him to the added risks of extended incarceration that would
be involved.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't it possible in this

case, too, Mr. Norton, this xtfas a young college student,
wasn't it, in his second year in college?
MR. NORTON: That's correct.
QUESTION: The only time he had ever had any
difficulty in his life.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION;

Isn’t that right?

MR. NORTON:

I am not sure about the prior record.

49

QUESTION:

Well, as I see this record

QUESTION:
QUESTION:

That’s what the record shows.
— I would suppose the judge would

decide, I'll have to give him something, but I'll be as
lenient as I can be; and so he gave him 90 days plus
probation.
MR. NORTON: That would be my reading of the
situation.
QUESTION:

Otherwise, that this wasn't the kind of

offender who ought to be or who needed to be sent to the
custody of the Attorney General for treatment for four to
six years.
MR. NORTON: That's right.

In two more years of

probation he would —
QUESTION:
MR. NORTON;

Under (b) or (c).

Sure.

— be — after two years of probation

he would be out of college and so forth.
QUESTION: What do you do about expunging his record?
MR.. NORTON; Well, it is — first of all, he would
not be entitled to expungement as such, under the provisions
of the Youth Act, unless he were discharged from probation
or released from commitment prior to the term set.

So it's

really a matter of speculation whether that situation would
ever arise, were he sentenced under the Act.
QUESTION: But it cannot be expunged under this present

sentence, short of a presidential pardon, I guess, can it?
HR. HORTON: Well, it is, I think I would have
that is a question to which I am not prepared to answer.
The words of section 5021, which provide for expungement,
are — simply refer to a youth offender who has been on
probation.
In the structure of the Act, it

appears to refer

to probation under 5010(a), explicitly, it is not limited
to that; and whether it would refer to probation under
3651, which petitioner received, is an open question, which
I'm not — this Court certainly has not resolved.
QUESTION:

You don’t know of any case where it

was done, I’m sure.
MR. NORTON:

I don't, but I'm not sure that

there's any case that — where it has been sought and denied.
I think some of the cases have assumed that 5010
““ that adult probation is not subject to the expungement
provision.

But I'm not sure that there's any clear ruling

on that point.
QUESTION:

About a thousand of them? a whole lot

of cases on that.
MR. NORTON: Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
Mr. Friebert, you appeared here at our request,

51
and by our appointment.

I want to thank you on behalf of

the Court for your assistance to the Court and to your
client.
MR. FRIERERT:

Thank you.

[Whereupon, at 3s00 o'clock, p.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
