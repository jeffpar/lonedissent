MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

and No. 72-1491, Dougherty against Texaco.
Mr. Evans.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION
MR. EVANS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
These cases are here on writ of certiorari to the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

They

concern the validity of certain orders of the Federal Power
Commission adopting a new method of regulating the sales of
natural gas producers --- sales by a class of small natural
gas producers in interstate commerce.
Following my argument on behalf of the Commission,
Mr. Vaughan will argue on behalf of the other petitioners
for approximately five minutes.

They are among the class of

small producers that are effective by the Commission's orders
in this case.
It is now almost universally recognized that we
are experiencing an increasingly critical shortage of natural
gas.

The orders at issue in this case are part of the

Federal Power Commission's vigorous program for combatting
that shortage, by encouraging new exploration and development

4
of the natural gas reserves in this country.
The orders rest on the Commission's authority under
Section 16 of the Natural Gas Act, which gives it the authority
to classify persons within its jurisdiction and to prescribe
different requirements for different classes.
The class involved here is not a new one.

The

Commission has previously given specialized rate treatment to
this group of small producers, and this Court held, in the
Permian Basin case, that:
"The problems and public functions of the small
producers differ sufficiently to permit their separate
classification."
Those problems and public functions were described
in some detail in the Permian opinion, and the facts are the
same today.
Small producers account for only about 10 to 15
percent of the gas that is transported in interstate pipelines.
And their prices generally follow the prices that large
producers are able to get for their gas.
But while they contribute only a small portion of the
interstate gas, they have traditionally been responsible for
about 80 percent of the exploratory drilling; much of it in
areas that have not previously been explored — which makes it
a highly risky operation.
The result is, as this Court stated in Permian, and I

5

quote again:

Their contribution to the search for new gas

reserves is significant, but it is made ct correspondingly
greater financial risk and at higher unit cost.
The principal impediment to the small producers'
exploratory efforts has been a lack of adequate financing.
The comment submitted to the Commission in this proceeding,
for example, at page 84 of the Appendix suggests that small
producers must rely principally on revenues from current sales
in order to finance their exploratory activities.
That is so because the hazards of their exploration
are such that it makes it difficult to depend upon debt
financing, and because the small producers, unlike the large
producers, seldom have other operations to generate the
funds that they can use for exploration.
Given this situation, the Commission devised, in
this rulemaking proceeding, a new regulatory program designed
to take advantage of the small producers' unique situation.
I want to emphasize that this Court has before it
only the orders that would set up the program, it is not
reviewing any order applying this new program to the facts
of any particular case.

The Court's review, consequently,

is a limited one.
The only question is whether the Act prohibits the
Commission from experimenting along the lines that it has
chosen to follow

6

And this Court has stated on a number of occasions
that one who challenges the validity of orders of the Federal
Power Commission bears a heavy burden of showing that it will
lead to unjust and unreasonable results.
The Power Commission’s plans has these features;
First, instead of following the ordinary procedure
of having each new sale of natural gas certificated in the
public

as in the public convenience and necessity, small

producers are granted a blanket certificate, which covers all
sales up to a stated maximum annual volume.
This particular feature is not a new one, either.
A similar blanket certificate procedure was established as
part of the Permian proceeding and was approved by the Court
in principle in that case.
Second, the small producer acting under this blanket
certificate may sell gas at whatever contract price he is
able to negotiate.

Even if it is higher than the areawide

maximum rates that have been established by the Commission as
just and reasonable for other purposes.
Now, this aspect of the order is new.

The prior

blanket certificate procedure permitted sales at rates up
the area maximum but not higher.
The purpose in this order to give some play to
market forces, to see whether prices would in fact exceed the
area maximum and, if so, whetheir they would make it more

7
attractive and wore feasible for the small producers to engage
in the kind of exploratory drilling that's been his history.
A third feature of the order is that in order to
permit the small producer to rely on his current revenues in
planning his exploratory program, the rates that are collected
under the contract are not subject to refund.

Even if the

Commission later determines that the rates were higher than
the just and reasonable rates.
Now, this, in effect, is an advance determination
by the Commission that it will serve the public interest to
announce that it will not suspend and make subject to refund
the new rates filed by — new rates in the new small producer
contract, but, rather, will limit itself to acting
prospectively under Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act to reduce
any rate that it concludes is unreasonably high.
Under the Commission's plan, its review of the
reasonableness of the small producers’ rates will take place
not in a producer proceeding, but, rather, subsequently in
a pipeline proceeding.
Under the plan, the pipelines are authorized to
track the increased rates resulting from the new small
producer contract.
The tracking proceeding in which the pipeline

seeks

to pass on the increased rate to its customers is the one in
which the Commission will determine the reasonableness of the

8

underlying small producer rate.
The pipeline is required under the orders to show
that its operating expenses, all of its operating expenses,
in this case particularly its purchased gas costs, are not
unreasonably high»
QUESTION!

I gather, then, if in the pipeline

proceeding it's determined that the small producer rates are
too high, there's no requirement that the small producers
refund.
MR. EVANS:

That's right, there's no requirement

that the small producer refund to the pipeline.

On the other

hand, if the determination is made that the rates are
unreasonably high, the pipeline is not permitted to pass on
those increased rates to its customers.
This serves as a bond of protection for the ultimate
consumer, who thereby avoids having to bear the brunt of any
unreasonably high rates.
QUESTION;

Judge Fahy disagreed with that, didn't

he?
MR# EVANS s Well, Jxidge Fahy concluded that it would
be appropriate to strike the no-refund aspects of this order.
But really that would destroy the heart of the program, because
the no-refund assurance to the small producer is what the
Commission is hoping will give him a sense of security in his
current revenues that will permit him to make the planning

9

that's necessary, and at the same time it has the very
important function of giving an incentive to the pipeline to
bargain the prices down.
What the Commission has done is freed the small
producers and the pipelines to negotiate rates higher than
the area maximum/ but they want to leave some bite to the
market forces that would otherwise be applied.

And if the

pipeline is sure that it could always either pass on its
rates that are increased or get refunds/ if they're ultimately
determined to be unreasonably high/ it has a free passage
and it needn't be terribly concerned about the rates,
barring, you know, the ultimate consumer — if he's running
into problems with other forms of energy, of course, he's
got a different problem at the end of the line.
But ordinarily he’s not going to be in that
situation.
So the no~refund assurance is really at the very
heart of this program, and without it I don't think the
program has, at all, the meat that the Commission intended it
to have.
Well, the result of the features ,

Ifve described
<; !■

-

*

them, is that the small producer is assured that his current
revenues are not subject to refund, so that he can rely on
them in making his plans for exploration.

The pipeline which

faces this risk of absorbing the losses, if it enters into

10

contracts to run reasonably high, has an incentive to bargain
the prices down.
And finally, the consumer whose protection the Act
is principally designed to assure is fully protected because
there*s no — because no unreasonably high small producer
rates will be permitted to be passed on by the pipeline.
Now, the plan is, without doubt, an experimental
one.

And. the Commission intends to monitor closely the

results under the plan.
In particular, it stated, at page 145 of the Appendix,
that if it finds the program is adversely affecting the
interests of consumers, it will take appropriate corrective
action.
The Commission's plan is attacked on a variety of
grounds, but they can properly be reduced, I think, to three.
QUESTION:

Is there a definition of small producer?

MR, EVANS:

Small producers, Mr, Justice, are

defined -- I'm not sure where in the order; but they are
defined similarly the one they were defined in the Permian
case to include all -QUESTION: Footnote 5 on page 6 — page 5; footnote 3
on page 5 of your brief,
MR. EVANS:

Oh.

They**re defined to include all producers whose annual
sales in interstate commerce are below the level of ten

11

million Hcf, that is thousand cubic feet, of natural gas.
The first argument that's made against the validity
of the Commission’s order is that it abandons the statutory
standard of just and reasonable rates.

And this is the basis

upon which the Court of Appeals relied in setting aside the
order.
The second argument is that the Act does not permit
rate review in this indirect manner, that is, postponing the
review until the pipeline proceeding.
And, finally, it’s claimed that the plan is unfair
to the large producers and pipelines who purchase gas from
small producers.
The Commission’s order specified that its review
of the small producer, the reasonableness of small producers’
rates in the pipeline proceedings would be in accordance with
a standard that I think it might be worth looking at closely.
It appears at page 142 of the Appendix.

It’s stated

that, slightly below the middle of the page, that the
standard will be whether or not the small producer's rate,
that is, the increase that the pipeline seeks to pass on,
"is unreasonably high considering appropriate comparisons with
highest contract prices for sales by large producers or the
prevailing market price for intrastate sales in the same
producing area."
The Court of Appeals thought this was a departure

12
from the statutory just-and-reasonable standard, because it
erroneously assumed that the Commission was tying its
reasonableness determination exclusively to the two market
factors that the order mentioned; namely, the highest
contract prices and the prevailing intrastate rates.
Neither of which, of course, the Commission
regulates.
This reliance upon this reading of the order is
made clear by the Court of Appeals at page 12a of the Appendix
to the Petition.
We don’t take the position here that an order tying
reasonableness to those factors would never be appropriate»
In fact, this Court in Permian suggested that in proper
circumstances it might be appropriate.
But we do say this is not what the Commission did
in this case.
The order does not suggest that the two factors that
the Commission identified would be the only ones that would
be taken into consideration.

The standard is one of

unreasonableness — whether the rate is unreasonably high,
and the Commission emphasised that it would consider all
relevant factors.
QUESTION: Well, the order isn't all that clear, is it?
It takes;

a little bit of argument about it.
MR. EVANS:

I think that's right.

It's not the

model of

MR. EVANS:

QUESTION: The Court of Appeals didn't read it like
that.
MR. EVANS:

They didn't read it that way, but I

think it was an incorrect reading.

putting it another way?
MR. EVANS:

Well, the Commission believes that

Appeals might come up with a different result if you said

It certainly doesn't, no,
But there is a substantial problem of

The Commission believed that the order was

clear enough and that there was no need to remedy any
ambiguities after the Court of Appeals’ opinion.

I suppose this is one way of saying what

14
it means.

I mean you're now saying this is precisely what it

means and -~
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

That's one way.

This Court, in —

-— there's no use sending hack now that

you've said what it means.
MR. EVANS:

Well, in a sense, there's no, you know,

if the Court construes it the way we suggest it should be
construed, that's what tine order means.
QUESTION: This tiling began in 1970, didn't it?
MR. EVANS:

That's right.

Well, while there is some ambiguity that I have to
concede, it seems to me reasonably clear that while prevailing
market prices are unquestionably among the factors that are
to be taken into account, the Commission has not indicated
that it is the only, the only considerations that will be
taken into account; and for that reason it's not, the
standard is not an abandonment of the statutory just-andreasonable standard.
A second issue is where there is anything in the Act
to prohibit the kind of indirect regulatory scheme that the
Commission adopted in this case.
The respondents argue that the Act requires direct
review in a pipeline proceeding, but they have pointed to
nothing in the Act that so specifies.

And this Court has

repeatedly held, in Power Commission cases, that under the

15
just-and-reasonable standard it is the result that matters
and not the regulatory method that's used.
Since this scheme, in our view, is reasonably
designed to result in just and reasonable rates, it does not
matter that the indirect method is the one that is used, and
it does not matter that the Commission has departed from its
prior practice of viewing these matters in direct proceedings,
in producer proceedings»
In fact, this Court, in the Sunray DX case, in 391
U.S., upheld the similar indirect regulatory scheme.

The

issue there was whether the Commission was required, under the
Act, to consider, in a producer certificate proceeding,
whether there was a public need for the gas contracted for.
The Court upheld the Commission's determination that
the question could more appropriately be considered in a pipe­
line proceeding.

And the Court held that the Act requires

no more than that there be an adequate forurn in which the
issue is to be ventilated; and that a pipeline proceeding was
an adequate forum in which to ventilate it.
Finally, the pipelines argue that the Commission's
plan will be unfair to them, because it will impose upon them
what they refer to as nev; burdens and new risks, and because
the reasonable standard articulated in the order, in their
view is too vague.
The fact is, however, that the pipelines have always

16
borne the risk that an operating expense will be deemed by
the Commission to be unreasonably high.

In the past the

Commission has not required special justification of purchased
gas costs, because it was clear at that point that the costs
were reasonable, the Commission having already made that
determination.
But there is no reason to think that the pipeline
has, by virtue of this practice and tradition, become
insulated to closer scrutiny of those purchased gas costs,
where their reasonableness has not been determined in
advance.
The Commission here has not invented a new burden
or a risk, it has simply highlighted an existing one.

There’s

no question that the pipelines would be happier were they
guaranteed the right to pass on any rates that they were able
to negotiated with ~
QUESTION:

But you ~~ the Commission doesn't

contend that the order would permit refunds, if you —■ your
regulation is going to be wholly prospective, I take it?
MR. EVANS: With respect to the producer rates.
It does permit refunds if the pipelines file for an increased

QUESTION:

Oh, I understand that.

MR, EVANS:

Yes.

QUESTION:

That maybe the pipelines are on the hook.

17

m. EVANS:

Yes.

QUESTION: But tiie producer, if you determine that
the producer has been charging an unreasonable rate to the
pipeline, you've committed yourself, apparently, not to
order any refunds.
MR. EVANS:

That's correct.

QUESTION: Even though the

Now, that does not —
rate is determined to be

unreasonable.
MR, EVANS:

Right.

And, you know, the Act does

not require the Commission to order refunds in any case.
It's wholly within the Commission's discretion.
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

Yes.
I don't even believe it's a matter that

can be reviewed by the courts, whether, in a particular case,
a rate should be suspended and made subject to refund.
And what the Commission has done here is made that
determination, exercised its discretion with respect to a
class, for sales.
QUESTION; What about under the Federal Power Act,
is there any independent cause of action for refund by a
consumer or a pipeline?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:
confess ignorance.

You mean under the Natural Gas Act?
Yes, the Natural Gas Act.
I don't believe there is.

I frankly

I've never seen one, so I assume there's

18

not.

I believe the Commission —
QUESTION:

If there was, it wouldn't do you much

good to say that we're not going to order any refund.
HR, EVANS:

Well, I think that's right, except,

I suppose, the Commission could, by rule, make —■ oh, for an
independent?

No, I agree *

But I don't believe that there

is such a private —
QUESTION:

In the railroad business there's an

independent you can sue for it?
MR. EVANS:

Right.

I believe that the only way

that the refunds can be ordered under the Natural Gas Act is
by the Commission, in a proceeding under Section 4(e) of the
Act.

I know of no other basis for refunds.
Finally, the pipelines claim that the standard is

too vague for them to apply.

But that claim really is, in

the present posture, one that could be made with respect to
any standard that has not yet been applied.

In fact, the

statutory just-and-reasonable standard could be certainly
attacked on the same ground, as being too vague.
The problem is we're dealing with the standard in
the abstract, and the Commission has indicated too of the
factors that it will take special account of in making its
reasonable determination»
The only way to find out whether the standard is
really clear enough to be workable is to let it be put into

19

practice to see what happens.

The Commission, of course,

roust be judged in the end by the justness and reasonableness
of the results that ensue under the Act.

But it's not at

this point, there is no reason to anticipate that the
standard here will be so unworkable that the Commission should
not be permitted to put it into effect on an experimental
basis.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BEN F. VAUGHAN, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF DUDLEY T. DOUGHERTY, ET AL.
MR. VAUGHAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court;
I represent eight individual small producers, none
of whom sell more than 2 million Mcf of gas a year at prices
ranging from 14 to 24 cents.
The point which is central to this case, and
apparently concerns this Court most, is the risk of a refund
obligation existing, and yet not being paid by the party
who received the money.

That certainly is the crux to the

case.
What, then, is the risk that there will be a.
charge by a small producer that is too high?
And then we must look to the position of the small
producer
QUESTION:

Where would the refimd obligation ever

20

come from if it weren’t imposed by the Commission?
MR. VAUGtIAN:

It — Your Honor, it may be brought

in action by a public service commission, but it must be
brought in the forum of the Commission, and must be brought
by the Commission.
QUESTION; Well, if the — what's the source of
the obligation to refund, only if the Commission orders it,
isn’t it?
MR. VAUGHAN:

Only if the Commission determines

that rhe rate that was charged was unjust or unreasonable ,
Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, I know, but does it automatically
follow that there's a refund obligation if the rate is
determined to be unjust and unreasonable?
MR. VAUGHAN:

Not at all, Your Honor.

It’s for

the Commission's discretion, and, indeed, the court, this
Court denied, certiorari in a case called Prado Oil Company,
in which the Commission had taken equitable factors into
consideration, and had not

Well, there's never going to be any ~

under this order there's never going to be any refund
obligation, than?
MR. VAUGHAN:

No, Your Honor, and I would suggest

to the Court —
QUESTION;

Then there's nothing that —.

22

MR. VAUGHAN:
finish your question.
QUESTION:

Beg your pardon, Your Honor? please
I

I would suppose you could restate the

worry as being that maybe there ought to be a refund
obligation? is that what you're suggesting?
MR. VAUGHAN:

Yes.

It appeared to me that the

Court was worried that there should have been a refund
obligation. And it's my suggestion that the market position
which is occupied by the small producer will produce a rate
which the Commission could reasonably conclude would be a
refund for, that the market price should be the refund for,
where it is reviewed continuously by the Commission albeit
prospectively.

That the incentive granted by permitting

the small producer to receive his market price will enhance
the exploratory effort of the small producer and *.at least
it could so be determined by the Commission that this
enhancement would transpire.
The small producer does not have, either historically
or under the terms of Order 428, the power to charge whatever
price he like3.

Historically, the small producer leases land,

or subvleases land,
produrvs»r.

it’s called farming out, from the large

He is offset by the large producer.
He takes the land and does the drilling, and earns

a small portion of the acreage that the large producer has.
If he's successful in his exploratory well, the large producer

22
then drills developmental xfells offsetting him.

A pipeline

comes to the large producer, v?ho is directly regulated, and
says; Will you sell me your gas?

The large producer says

yes.
He comes to the small producer with the same rate.
He says; Will you sell me your gas?

The small producer.says

no.
The pipeline says; Fine, we’ll just drain you by
buying it from the large producer.
He has no market if he doesn't agree.
Secondly, —
QUESTION;

Mr. Vaughan, what is the economic

reason that, as Mr. Evans stated, eighty per-cent of the
exploratory work is by this small producer rather than the
large one, theoretically the small one doesn't have the funds
to do this?
MR, VAUGHAN:
QUESTION;

Why does all this transpire?

Yes.

MR, VAUGHAN:

Well, Your Honor, it — for one —

I think two basic reasons.

One is, is that the large

producers tend to hunt for big game; and another phenomenon
that transpires in the industry is that the geophysical
techniques, the science of oil exploration, does not yield and
has not yielded an increased success ratio over the years.
They are finding the same number of wells per — some number

23
of productive wells per wells drilled, now that they were in
the Twenties*

And the large producer says:

Small producers,

you go out and drill, we’ll invest our capital in large
lease blocks.

So that if you do find something, then we

can spend all our money in development.
The second class of gas, of course, is your flowing
gas;

and the contract prices now prevail for flowing gas for

small producers.
But if we look at how much of the contract prices
will exceed the directly regulated just and area rates,
we will see that there is only about 25 percent of the contract
provisions which permit the gas of the small producers, indeed
the gas of all producers, according to the study, gas of all
producers to exceed the just and reasonable area

rates.

And it is this increment, this 25 percent increment,
of the small producer production, or approximately three
percent of the total gas, upon which the small produced must
rely to finance his exploratory efforts.
I thank the Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Boland.

Very well, Mr. Vaughan.

24
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER T. BOLAND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF INTERSTATE NATURAL GAS ASSOCIATION
OF AMERICA.
MR, BOLAND;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I'm representing the Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline
Association of America,.which includes in its membership
virtually all the major pipelines in the United States.
I'm also arguing for the major producers in this
case.
Mr. Schiff, who is the general counsel of the New
York Public Service Commission, will follow me.
We have a rather unusual situation here, and this
may be a first.

The first time in my memory that the three

segments of the industry7 are unified.

We find the pipelines,

we find the major producers, and we find the consumers,
represented by Mr. Schiff, all unified in their attack against
Order 428 issued by the Commission.
Now, I'd like to make one point very clear at the
outset.

No one of us is opposed to giving the small producer

a higher rate.

We think that based upon a proper record

that the Federal Power Commission may well justify a higher
rate which is just and reasonable for the small producer under
the cir cunts tances.
But such is not the case here. There is no record in

25

this case.

Haere are a few comments and a transcript of an

informal conference.

And that's all we have.

Now, our friends here in the government have told us
in their reply brief that the issue is not whether the FPC
can exempt the small producer from the Natural Gas Act, and
they say that the Commission hasn't claimed this authority,
and they say they don't argue that the statute permits it.
And they say

that the contention that the Act requires all

producer rates to be just and reasonable is beside the point.
Now, the real issue, as we see it, is the exemption
of the small producer.

And no matter how you twist cr turr­

it, that is exactly what the Commission did in Order 428.
find in its notice, the original notice issued in
the rule-making proceeding, it was frankly captioned,
"Exemption of Small Producers from Regulation".

That's

shown in the Joint Appendix, page 1.
The notice also stated that the small producers
would be exempt from all the provisions of the Natural Gas
Act and regulations, other than an annual report on volume
of sales.
Mow, this is in the notice.
So let’s go to the order.

Joint Appendix 137.
How, we think that these, taken together, clearly
indicate that the Commission contemplated an exemption, and
indeed the Court of Appeals wasn't misled on this point.
But in the exemption the counterpart of the exemption, in order
to give some camouflage to some sort of regulation, what they
did was to shift the regulatory responsibility front the
Federal Power Commission to the pipelines and large producers.
And this, at a time when the pressures are on us as
purchasers to pay the market price, they are asking us to
substitute our regulation for theirs under the Natural Gas
Act.
.As mentioned, the two standards in 423 were given
as the highest contract price by large producers or the
prevailing market price.
IJow, we had some problems in the vagueness of these
two terms , but much less than we have as a result of the
reply brief, filed by our friends here, and I'll get to that
a little later.
Now, as to the large producers, they had a -third
standard, and they had to have a market differential that was
prevailing in the area.
But the purpose of Order 423 was absolutely obvious.
It was to give the small producers a price in excess of the

just and reasonable price.

Otherwise, there was absolutely

no purpose in the Commission issuing Order 428«.

It's clear

that this is what they had in mind.
And in so doing, and giving these standards, they
gave the pipelines what we thought was somewhat of an
assurance, they said the standards, these two standards,
the standards also provide pipelines with a more concrete
guide for their future action than would exist in the absence
thereof.
Simply put, the Commission wanted the pipelines to
know in advance the boundaries within which they could freely
contract the small producers.
As I've indicated, we think that is — the Order 428
adds up to complete exemption for the small producers.

We

think that it's in absolute contravention of the clear and
unequivocal terms of the Natural Gas het.
The Natural Gas Act says, Section 4 says:

All rates

shall be just and reasonable and any rate that is not just
and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful.
Section 4(d) says:

No natural gas company — and

there's no argument that a sale by a small producer here
involved in interstate commerce for resale is a natural gas
company within the meaning of the Act.

Section 4(d) says:

No natural gas company shall make any claim of undue
preference or maintain any unreasonable difference in rates.

28
Section 4(c) says:

Every natural gas company shall

file with the Commission schedules showing all rates for any
transportation and sale.
Section 5 is likewise clear.

It says: Whenever the

Commission shall find any rate chaxrged by any natural gas
company is unjust, the Commission shall fix the rate as the
just and reasonable rate.
How, the Commission, in Order 428 — and that’s what
we're dealing with here -- relied for its exemption, relied
on the fact that Sections 4, 5, and 7, which is the certificate
provision, are not mandatory but discretionary.

This is what

they said in the Order.
They're not arguing that now before this Court.
tills is what they said in the Order.

But

That it's not mandatory

and they cited Mr. Justice Clark's comments in FPC v. Hunt,
and also the Permian case.
Nov/, Mr. Justice Clark's statement was pure dictum,
he was talking about NLRB Act, which allowed the National
Labor Relations Board to decide whether or not it would exempt
certain types of activities.
There is no such similar provision in the Natural.
Gas Act.

And in the Permian case, the Permian case is no

precedent for what the Commission purported to do in 428.
In the Permian case, the Commission had taken small
producers, classified them separately, issued a blanket

23

certificate and said:

As long as you do not exceed the ten

billion cubic feet a year, you don't need any further
certificate authorisation for your sales in interestate
commerce, as long as and only under the condition that your
rate to the pipeline purchaser does not exceed the just and
re as on ab le rate.
And that's precisely what the Permian case stands
for, and the.re's no basis at all for the Commission's
exemption.

MR. BOLAND:
QUESTION:
MR. BOLAND:

Well, but they don't now.
They don't now, that's right.

But what they've substituted for it is, they say
that the sophisticated pipeline purchaser, and at the time
he's negotiating a contract, that he can ask the producer for
his costs.
Mow, the Federal Power Commission has been after
producer costs for twenty years, and hasn't been successful
yet.

Notwithstanding this, they have suggested that one of

the things that we do is ask the producer for his cost.
Now, that's going to be one of the guides that they
would take into consideration at the time they determine whether
we have to refund or whether vie don't.
They've also said:

Okay, the pipeline's need for

the gas, the availability of other gas supplies, the amount
of gas dedicated under the contract, the rates of other small
producers in recent sales.

Add what, and wny other considera­

tion that may suggest the reasonableness of the rate.
What kind of a standard is that?

What kind of a

guideline is that?
And what the Commission has done — here we are in a

33
seller's market.
market.

There is no question that it's a seller's

There's a terrific demand for gas unmet, and the

Commission is shifting the rate responsibility, the
regulatory responsibility to the pipeline purchaser in a
seller's market, and expects us to regulate the rate so that
it will corae up with a just and reasonable rate.
Now, we say that that's an impossible task, and
one that's absolutely contrary to the clear language of the
Natural Gas Act.
QUESTION: And tire re might be some problems of the
pipelines getting together, mightn't there?
MR. BOLAND:
in pipelines

Yes, I think there could be problems

getting together, and the producers are well

aware of that.
But, in any event, I've covered the Permian, what's
happened here i.s we've seen a patchwork post hoc by the
Federal Power Commission all the way through this.
The first thing that happened was the notice.

On

the notice there was clear language that the pipelines would
be able to pick up any increase for any price paid.

They

use the word "tracking”, that's what tracking means, in our art,
before the Commission.
In the order that came out, they said:

No, we're

going to put indirect regulation, we’re going to hold you
responsible.

34
And at tinis point there was no change in the producer
price at all, prospective or otherwise.

Nothing!

The first time we came across a reduction in producer
price was before the Court of Appeals, in the briefs filed
by the government, in their briefs in the Court of Appeals.
But at that time they were still adhering to the
fact that the provisions of the Natural Gas Act were discre­
tionary, and that they were recognizing, in effect, that they
were exempting the small producers, but within the purview
of their powers under Section 16 of the Natural Gas Act.
But now, before you, they've abandoned all that,
and they now say; That's all beside the point.

That's all

beside the point.
Well, we've got a new ballgame here, and what we're
now saying to this Court is that the rate ultimately will be
a just and reasonable rate and we're not abandoning *the
standards at all.

And the indirect regulation is nothing more

than Sunray DX.
Sunray DX had to do with the need for gas, not
rates, which is the heart of the Act, as found by this Court
in the famous Hope case.

The heart of the regulatory scheme

is the rate section.
But what they're talking about is a certificate
case, where the need for -the gas;

do you determine that in

the pipeline case, or do you determine it in the producer case?

35
I think that's a totally different, different case
than the one we have here, as to the direct rate responsibility
being shifted to the pipelines when the clear responsibility
is vested in the Federal Power Commission»,,
We think all of this is contrary to the rule of
the Champ Lin case.

We don't think that they can come and

patch their order up.

We think that this Court will decide

this on the basis of 428.
QUESTION:

What are you going to say, Mr. Boland,

about the current power of the Commission to experiment with
the new problems
MR» BOLAND:

I'm glad you mentioned that, Mr. Chief

Justice, because this is not an experiment, and they keep
talking about this, and Mr. Justice Rehnquist raised the
question, well, wasn't this started in 1970; it was.
The notice issued was issued on July 23rd, 1970,
and the Order 428 was issued on March 18th, 1971.
That's all — that's one month short of three
years.

And there wasn't anything experimental in the Act,

I mean in the Order.

The Commission didn't purport, is my

recollection, to do it on an experimental basis.

But even if

they had, they've had three years, three years to develop a
record, and there is no record in -this case to support what
they've done.
QUESTION:

Has it been in effect during that time,

36
or has it been stayed?
MR. BOLAND:

No, this has been in effect

now,

it could be that when the Court of Appeals issued its
decision, that might have had a modifying effect on the
action, but, notwithstanding that, it's never been stayed.
No.

The order is in effect.
QUESTION: Wei1, was the Court of Appeals'

judgment

stayed?
MR* BOLAND:

it's interesting to —
QUESTION:

Until the Court of Appeals set them

aside, I suppose?
MR. BOLAND: The Court of Appeals set it aside,
that’s right.
But the Commission is still operating under this.
And just, just last month almost in anticipation of this
argument —
QUESTION;

How can they be operating under it if

their judgment ~~ if their order was set aside?
MR. BOLAND:

Well, the pipelines are still entering

37
into contracts, and we had one just in Jamiary, a trunkline
pipeline —
QUESTION:

If the Court of Appeals set their order

aside,they set it aside, and that judgment hasn't been stayed,
has it?
MR. BOLAND:
QUESTION:

No.

No, Your Honor.

Well, have they violated the order

the Court of Appeals mandate, then?
MR, BOLAND: Well, as far as I know, they haven't
done anything one way or ~ well, they haven't done anything
to indicate that they're not operating under this thing, and,
as I mentioned, on July 31st of

I mean January 31st, almost

in anticipation of this oral argument, the Commission for the
first time issued an order
QUESTION:

against --

Was there an application for a stay

here?
MR. BOLAND:
QUESTION:

No.

No, sir.

There’s never been a stay?

MR. BOLAND:

No, Your Honor.

But on January 31st, just last month, for the first
time, they issued an order against trunkline, pipeline company,

wb.ere they filed a tracking increase, and they suspended it.
Because the price being paid to a small producer may be
unreasonably excessive.
This is the first monitoring that we've seen in

38

three years, of this great monitoring that mv friend, Mr.
Evans, has indicated,
I see my time is up. Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Schiff.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER II. SCHIFF, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
MR. SCHIFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
New York's basic concern in this case is that the
Commission's action, which we believe amounts to

deregulation

of small producers' rates, will result in passing on excessive
costs to consumers.

And inevitably so under just about any

construction of the Commission's order.
But I think it's quite clear that even if one accepts
the possibility of indirect regulation through the use of the
pipeline proceeding that the Commission's orders don't provide
for a determination of the just and reasonable rate.
And, notwithstanding your question, Mr» Justice
White, as to looking at the order the way they're now
interpreting it, I would at least, for the time being, in
my limited time, try to say what the Commission’s orders
in fact

said, and the Court of Appeals construed it quite

correctly.
I don't think any amount of rewriting can really

39

change it.
QUESTION:

three years?

You're paying the pipeline?
MR. SCHIFF:

We’re paying the pipeline rates.

QUESTIONs And those are regulated.
MR, SCHIFF:

Well, let me answer those in terms,

because — if you would turn to page 142 of the Joint Appendix,

40
which is the Commission’s Order 428, which is under review.
The Commission set a standard.

The Commission

determined that in order to encourage the small producers to
receive more money, and that -the pipelines would contract
above what had been fixed as a just and reasonable rate for
the large producers, that it was necessary to provide the
pipelines with some assurance of certainty.
They established the standard, which Mr. Eveins has
read to you, saying that the pipelines will be subject to
refund, or reducation and refund with respect to new small
producer sales, but only as to that part of the rate which
is unreasonably high,

considering appropriate comparisons

with -the highest contract prices for sales by large producers,
or the prevailing market price for intrastate sales.
Now, the next sentence is what I want to
concentrate on.

It says, "Tracking increases to the extent

they reflect small producer prices for new sales above the
standard set forth above may be suspended, and if so, will be
collected subject to refund."
Now, two sentences later, the Commission says:
where there's been a suspension -— now, remember, this is only
Where it is above the standard, then "The Commission shall
consider all relevant factors."
And we don't deny that the Commission may consider
the

relevant factors mentioned in the Footnote 3 of the

41
government1s Reply Brief, but that only cones into play, as
the Court below I think recognized, is when the rates are —~
that have been paid are above -the standard fixed.
How, the standard fixed is the highest prices paid
by

to a large producer. Contract price.

because it’s very importanto

I misspoke,

Traditionally, the way the

contracting has been done under the Natural Gas Act, at
least since Phillips in 1954, pipelines pay or contract at
higher prices than the Commission actually allows.
Certainly that's been true since there’s been
real regulation by the Federal Power Commission.
And what is discernible, as we point out in our
brief, from the files of the Federal Power Commission, is
•tii.at there are — the contract price may be 20, 30 or even 40
cents above the rate that has been determined just and
reasonable.
Wow, it is this high price which, I suppose, can
he a market standard, but it's an artificial market standard,
at that.

Which the Commission says:

anything up to that, we

will allow without tracking, without going through it all.
And that is what the Commission's Order does in this tiling, and
I don’t see how the government can say that they have now
rewritten it.
They just don't understand, their own order, or
at least they don't accept the impact of that.

42

Now, the court — the courts have traditionally
said that the reason for regulation of sales by producers,
whether 'they — it is direct or indirect, is because the market
is not an adequate basis for determining the just and reason­
able rates.
At least where gas is.in short supply and it's a
seller's market, and we most assuredly have the biggest
seller's market that there has been since the Phillips case.
And Permian

is — which the government promised and sought a

conflict with in their petition ~~ is not inconsistent with
that.

It's conceivable that there are times when the market

may be such that there is a buyer’s market, that competition
will infact produce a just and reasonable rate, or, indeed,
as in Permian, the Commission did look to market prices, to
look at how to balance rates between different types of sales.
But there is no suggestion that the unregulated
market price could be a just and reasonable standard.
How, til ere' s another problem with this order.

The

Commission, in dealing with the pipelines, or in both 428 and
420(b), the Commission said:

we have always been able to

examine the cost of purchased gas in a pipeline proceeding,
and the costs of other expenses.
And the Commission's order expressly — if I may
for a second ~™ at page 139, said:

"The Commission has ample

authority to inquire in these cases into the reasonableness

of all operating expenses and to disallow items of cost which
are imprudent.”
Now, this is very important.
imprudent expenses can be disallowed.

Of course, it's true,
And they sometimes are

termed as excessive or not reasonable from the point of view
of the purchaser.

But that is not the same as looking at it

from the point of view of the seller, as to whether a seller*
rate is just and reasonable, which is essentially related tc
costs.

At least it's a surrogate for costs, whether it has

to be based expressly on costs or not.
On the other hand,

the prudency reasonable test

is a market test, the ver/ test which is not permissible as
a basis for regulation under the Natural Gas Act.
Now, this is no different than when a pipeline
purchcises steel pipe.

The pipeline can’t determine what the

costs are of U. S. Steel.

The question of whether it’s

prudent or not is a matter of whether the pipeline has
exercised reasonable contracting practices and has paid —
hasn't just gone out on the limb and paid much more than it
had to under market conditions.
Now, I know of no authority, and this is where I
want to get to Mr. Justice White's question of Mr. Boland.
I know of no authority under which the FPC could, disallow
the cost based on anything other

purchases gas expenses

in a pipeline proceeding, on other, anything other than the

44
prudency test.

Or reasonableness, from the point of view of

the buyer test.
The only exception that I know of, in regulatory
annals, is where there is an affiliation in question, where
the seller buys from its affiliate.

Then you can get to cost

But otherwise it’s a market test.

And. so that the

Commission has to rev/rite its order, not only in the first
way that we discussed, but also has to rewrite the order on
what prudency means; and it has no legal authority to do that
And this is where the consumer will bear the brunt,
because the test isn't the same test.
Now, finally, -—
QUESTION;

The Commission's order says that;

The

action taken here, in our view, does not constitute deregula­
tion of sales by small producers.

We will continue to

regulate such sales, but will do so at the pipeline level,
by reviewing the purchased gas costs of each pipeline with
respect to small producer sales.
Now, is that just inconsistent with what they said
elsewhere in the Order?
MR. SCIIIPF; We 11, the regulation that they are
promising is a regulation of the purchases, and the standard
that they're setting is a market standard, which is not the
proper standard for what is a just and reasonable price.
And the prudency test is not a proper test, and it's the only

45
legal test for determining what is a- just and reasonable price.
So they are saying they're regulating, but the
practical effect is that the nature of the regulation is
precisely the kind of regulation that did exist before this
Court’s decision in Phillips in 1954.

Doesn't change one

iota, notwithstanding my friend's comments in their Reply
Brief,
But that was not considered regulation under the
Natural gas Act.

So that I think that's my answer to you,

and very basic to it, though, is that there just is no
authority, whether it is when our Commission, the New York
Commission regulates a distribution company or the Federal
Power Commission regulates a pipeline company.

There's no

basis on which we can disallow costs, simply because they
exceed what the just a-d reasonable level would have been
for the seller.
It's a prudency test, and that's all the
authority that a regulatory commission has, and the FPC can't
change it by saying it has some other authority in its briefs
The Commission's order is much more careful as to
its authority in this respect, I think, —QUESTION: Are you suggesting, Hr. Schiff, that if
we go along with the Commission, that's pro tanto, a withdrawal
from what we held in Phillips?
HR, SCHIFF:

I think yes„ inevitably so.

An issue

46

which is not really here, but —
QUESTION:

Well, it is, if what you say is right.

QUESTION: Are you suggesting we go the whole way?
MR. SCHIFF:
go the whole way.

Well, I certainly do not suggest you

I suggest that if you did that here, you’d

do it with respect to all of producer regulation, and I
suggest that, after 18, 19 years, that this is a decision
to be made in Congress.

There have been various bills proposed

in Congress for deregulation.

That, Your Honors, is the

proper forum for the attempt to deregulate.
Now, I think this is what the Commission is doing,
but this isn't the right forum.
I want to say with respect to existing contracts,
that the Commission did not even make a pretense at indirect
regulation.

Under existing contracts, which may have been

below the contract price, the just and reasonable price, they
let them go up, let them.be passed through, no indirect
regulation,

I suggest that, contrary to what is said in

the Reply Brief of the government, that we properly raise
that.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
about four minutes left.

Mr. Evans, you have

47
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION
MR. EVANS s
that

Let me respond first to the question

what the Commission has been doing in the interim

since the Court of Appeals decided the case.
Prior to the decision in the Court of Appeals, the
Commission had been issuing certificates under the Order.
Wien the Court of Appeals set aside the order, the Commission
ceased issuing permanent certificates under the Order and
began issuing what they call temporary certificates, which,
in effect, leave the matter entirely open, pending ultimate
disposition.
They are

the certificates that have been issued

since the Court of Appeals ruling have conditioned — have
had a condition that the producer will be subject to refund
if the court, if this Court ultimately determines that the
Court of Appeals is correct.
Along the same lines, it's very difficult for me to
understand the argument that we have had three years to
experiment.

These three years have been years of obvious

uncertainty, which is exactly what the Order is designed to
eliminate.
Until juducial review is at an end, there is no
fair basis for judging whether the order will have the
intended effects

48

Mr. Schiff has emphasized, to some degree, that the
market is — market prices are not the proper test, for just and
reasonable rates.
We don't say that that's the case. We don't argue
that the Commission has used it. But I might point out that
this Court, in the Sunray DX case, said that the true market
price, is the just and reasonable rate.
The problem with the natural gas industry is that
pipelines have traditionally been permitted to pass on their
purchased gas costs in -the forra of increased rates.

And, as

a consequence, there has been no incentive for the pipeline
to bargain the prices down.
Well, the purpose of the Commission's order, among
other things, is to give some sense of reality to the market
here and make it more of a genuine market.
So, to that extent, we have, we contemplate, the
Commission contemplates something approaching a true market
price, which would be the just and reasonable rate.
And I might add also that this Court, in Permian,
made it quite plain that it was permissible for the Commission
to take into account market factors in determining the just
and reasonable rates,
Finally, there seems to be a suggestion in Mr.
Schiffs argument that the standard of prudence is something
that inheres in the Constitution.

There is no constitutional

49
requirement that the Commission apply a prudent standard.
The constitutional limit is one of confiscation, that's all*
The statutory standard is what matters here, and that standard
is just and reasonable, and that is the standard that the
Commission intends to apply when it reviews the small producer's
rates at the pipeline level.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen*

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:54 o'clock, a.m. , -the case in
the above“entitled matter was submitted.]
