MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

first this morning in No. 73-679, Wolffagainst McDonnell.
Mr. Kammerlohr!, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELVIN KENT KAMMERLOHR
IN BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KAMMERLOHR;
-

the Court:

Mr, ’Chief Justice, and may it please
'

•

I had the honor of appearing here several years

ago on the issue of first impression whether or not the
States should be required to have a post

conviction remedy,

c

in the case of Case v. Nebraska, you will recall.

Just before

the time * rr argument, our State legislature passed a pos;
conviction remedy.
copies

So I came back armed with the certified

- unfortunately I don't have anything like that with

me today, but this Court praised the action of Nebraska, at
any r,ate, in the interest of State-Federal relations and in
the interest of comity for passing a post conviction remedy.
Unfortunately, our problems haven't been as strong
in this area as they have been in the- area of civil rights
actions, as this Court knows, and as the increase in Federal
courts is going throughout the Nation in civil rights actions.
But in the same spirit, I would like to urge this Court, and I
do urge this Court, that as the Honorable Chief Justice Burger
in his dissent to Goldberg v. Kelly and a companion case urged

4
at that time that as these administrative regulations are
evolving, that we should not make them of constitutional
quality and take away the flexibility but to give them a
chance to evolve.

And that’s what we are urging here as the

briefs on both sides.
what we want.

We are I think in pretty much agreement

People aren't, really saying that prisoners

shouldn’t have this or shouldn’t have that, but it’s more a
question of whether it should be a constitutional quality or
not.
The groups of various prison administrators are
constantly working and making model regulations and so on, as
the briefs also show.

So on that part we would strongly urge

that this not be raised to the question of constitutional
standards.
Mr. Justice Stewart also emphasized this in the
recent case of Preiser v. Rodriguez when he was pointing out
'

-

—

"

\

the need for exhausting State remedies in cases of habeas
corpus type and he specifically stated in regard to the
-orisons, "Since these internal problems of State prisons
involve issues so peculiarly within State authority and
expertise the States have an important interest in not being
bypassed in the correction of these problems. ”
I think the same with equal authority could be
stated in this kind of a situation.

Of course, the question

also gets down to whether the inmate has actually lost liberty

s
in instances where, say, he is taken from the general popula­
tion and placed in an adjustment center or solitary confinement,
lias he lost liberty within the meaning of the Constitution, or
was this contemplated at the time of his due process trial,
his due process sentence, and possibly his due process revoca­
tion proceeding of probation?

Was this liberty then taken from

him?
What does the judge mean when he says, "I sentence
you to the penitentiary," after all this due process has been
given?

What does it actually mean?

I think a lot of judges

probably themselves don’t know the situation of the tiers of
the cells and how much time the inmates in one institution
work and how much in another they work or how much they are
involved in this or that.

Blit what does the judge mean when

he says, "I sentence you to the penitentiary"?
I would next move to another very important issue
in this case, your Honors, and this involves the interpretation
of Johnson v. Avery in wnich this Court said that if one
inmate would not be permitted to assist another in preparation
of legal petitions in habeas corpus proceedings, then the
prison must provide some alternative.

And the Court of Appeals

for the Eighth Circuit in the present case went on to say
that we must also consider whether this alternative is
satisfactory; we must also consider civil rights actions.
And itfe say this is an extension, a great extension of Johnson v.

6
Avery, because vTohnson v. Avery in several places specifically
limited the case to habeas corpus proceedings in providing
this alternative.

And if it’s extended to civil rights

proceedings, it's going to mean a terrific increase in the
number of cases.

And as this Court knot^s from reading the

multitudes of cases throughout the United States in the Federal
district courts and the U.S. Court of Appeals, these inmates
will sue on every conceivable possible thing in nearly every
step the administration takes or doesn’t take.
QUESTION:

What do you understand the Eighth Circuit

to have said, Mr. Kammerlohr, xvith respect to what the warden
would have to do in connection with
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

I understand what you mean, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist, that when it was remanded to Federal
district court where the District Judge determines whether
or not Nebraska was providing a reasonable alternative to
permitting one inmate to help another, that they must take
into consideration civil rights actions as well as habeas
corpus proceedings.I think they meant are we furnishing
inmate assistance for civil rights actions and are we doing
it sufficiently.

And I think this is giving a completely new

constitutional right that wasn’t meant or even contemplated
by Johnson v. Avery.
QUESTION:
little thing.

Mr. Kammerlohr, I am troubled about one

Do we have a final judgment here?

7
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

I believe we do, Mr. Justice

Blackmun, in the sense that I see what you are getting at.
The Court did say that the district court should on remand
determine some of these issues, such as whether -- in what
situations right to counsel, for example, is required in a
disciplinary proceeding.
However, we are also arguing another point

that

certainly was granted in this case, that who should make
the initial determination?

Should it be the district court

or should it be the prison administration, and then review
those particular things.
court

In other words, shouldn't the

set the guidelines as it did in *- if it's going to

set guidelines -- as it did in Morrissey v. Brewer as to
future cases and then the prison administration within those
guidelines would have to set the rules.

So I suppose you

?
t '%

can argue all around whether it's false judgment or isn't
because of the nature of the;Way these things arise.
QUESTION:

Do you view the Court of Appeals has

made a constitutional decision in general outline?
MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

Yes, yoixr Honor, I do.

Did they leave the details to be worked

out -MR. KAMMERLOHR:

On the question of right to counsel

they did say that there must be some case where there is right
to counsel, which is a new extension, and also presume then

8
that there are constitutional rights to some due process in
a disciplinary proceeding.

The court said that we had

admitted as far as revocation of good time, because Morrissey v.
Brewer came back in the meantime, reversing the Eighth Circuit,
and we did then concede that as far as good time is concerned
that there was due process due in Nebraska because good time
is directly related to eligibility for parole.

But we didn’t

concede that there was any due process due in any other
disciplinary proceeding as our brief in the Eighth Circuit
clearly points out.

Also, we couldn't concede constitutional

rights one way or the other anyway.

That’s for this Court

and not for us to be conceding x*hat the constitutional rights
are or what they aren’t.
I would briefly like to hit one more issue and then
I will be through, your Honors.

That is the question of

opening attorney-inmate mail for contraband.
the Eighth Circuit rules :

We feel that

that they set down in this

case would be difficult to administer where they say a simple
telephone call to the attorney whose name appears on the letter
would determine whether the attorney had actually sent the
letter or not.
First, it's not a matter of a telephone call,
especially in the Federal prison system where they might have
to call all over the United States.

A lot of attorneys are

hard to get hold of on the first call.

We think it would be

D
much simpler if there is some -- they also stated that in
appropriate circumstances, the mail could be opened in the
presence of the inmate.

But we don’t know what appropriate

circumstances are.
QUESTION:

Nebraska doesn’t follow the Federal

pattern of having the mail opened in the presence of the inmate
if he wants it done that way?
MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

You do or don’t?

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

We' do.

We think it would be very

reasonable to open the mail for contraband in the presence of
the inmate, not to read it, but merely to open it in the
presence of the inmate, in any case where they question it
without saying they have to make a telephone call to somebody
first or something like that.
QUESTION:

Is that the procedure now?

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

No, this is a procedure that the

Eighth Circuit indicated in their opinion in this case.
QUESTION:

Has that been adopted by Nebraska?

MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

I don’t believe so, your Honor.

So they are still following the same rule.

I thought your answer to the Chief Justice was that you had
• V. -

changed.

I was wrong-

v.

You haven't changed it-

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

My answer was that they want to have

a rule where they can open the mail in the presence of the

10
inmate for contraband.
QUESTION:

They could do that today, couldn't they?

MR. KAMMERLOHR:
opinion in this case

They don’t feel they can under the

from the Eighth Circuit which merely

says "in appropriate circumstances."
QUESTION:

If they did it in all circumstances, then

you would have no problem, would you?
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

That’s right, your Honor.

QUESTION:

That’s what the Federal system does.

QUESTION:

Well,the Court of Appeals for the Eighth

Circuit would be required to do more thap that.
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

They say if there is any question,

if it is from an attorney, a simple telephone call would answer
the question.

Then they went on to say in appropriate

circumstances if fluoroscoping and bending would not reveal,
then they could open it in the presence of the inmate.

The

only trouble there is when -QUESTION; The Eighth Circuit would not permit you
simply to open every piece of mail in the presence of the
inmate without more -- you have to have a better reason than
that to open mail,
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

Yes, your Honor, that is the way I

interpret that opinion.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

Yes.
Thank you, your Honors.

II
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT II. BORK FOR THE
UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING
PETITIONERS
MR. BORK:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

The United States is quite concerned about the decision

of the Eighth Circuit and

the possibility that the

constitutional rules formulated in this case might impair the
freedom of the Bureau of Prisons to continue its evolution of
prison disciplinary procedure's.

We have described that

evolution to date in the appendix to our brief and I won't
pause to discuss it here.
But the Government does believe that its current
procedures in disciplinary actions in Federal prisons accord
that process which is due in the unique setting of prison life.
It is a process whose objective must be an inmate's correction
and rehabilitation and not punishment.
The constitutional rules devised

by the Court of

Appeals for the Eighth Circuit we think in this case are
dangerously simplistic because they ignore both the objectives
of prison discipline and the realities of prison life.

These

rules, I think, would really damage the mission of the Federal
Bureau of Prisons and the inmates of those prisons.
We have discussed in our brief the reasons why the
rules laid down by the Eighth Circuit should not be applied

12
in any event retroactively.

But I will leave that to the

brief and discuss here the rules and due process itself because
we are primarily concerned with the future impact of these rules
The basic error, we think, in the opinion below is
the mechanical application of prison disciplinary procedures
of the procedure requirements laid down for parole and proba­
tion revocation hearings by Morrissey v. Brewer and by Gagnon v,
Scarpelli.

The Morrissey opinion of this Court itself warned

against this very error of thoughtlessly transposing rules
devised for one factual context to a totally different factual
context.

In Morrissey this Court stated that what process is

due under varying circumstances is to be determined in the
light of the private interest5 affected and the precise nature
of the governmental function involved.

The Court of Appeals’

opinion here, I think, discloses very little evidence of
consideration of either of those factors.
We have outlined at pages 13 and IS of our brief,
13 through 15 of our brief, the similarities and the differences
between Morrissey-Scarpe11i standards and the present Federal
Bureau of Prisons standards.

I won’t pause to discuss them in

detail, but I would call your attention to the fact that in
many respects the Bureau's procedures today meet the requirement
laid down by Morrissey and Scarpelli.
QUESTION:
factors

Mr. Solicitor General, you said two

you thought had been largely disregarded by the

13
Court of Appeals, and I missed those.
MR. BORK:

What were they?

Those were the factors specified, Mr.

Justice Stewart, in Morrissey for determining what process is
due under varying circumstances.

The first is the private

interest that is affected, the deprivation.

The second is the

precise nature of the governmental function involved, the
governmental interest.
QUESTION:

From cafeteria workers, that sort of test.

MR. BORK:

That the Bureau is sensitive to degrees

of deprivation, I think is shown by. the ^act apparent from the
chart on pages 13 through 15, that more procedural safeguards
are provided for forfeitures of good time, which is a greater
deprivation than for lesser disciplinary actions within the
prison, and that these procedures are effective, I would
suggest, is shown by the fact that as the Bureau informs us
the Washington office reverses and remands from 20 to 25
percent of the good time forfeitures ordered within the prison
system.

I think that shows effectiveness and not the contrary

because we all knoTtf the Federal courts also have a reversal
rate and we usually regard that as corrective and proper rather
than evidence of something being \tfrong at the lower level.
I would also point out
QUESTION:

X suppose it has a tendency to harmonize

or homogenize in effect, the treatment of prisoners in all the
60-odd Federal prisons by having a review in Washington.

14
MR. BORK:

It does, Mr. Chief Justice.

There are

certainly obviously bound to be differences in attitude among
various wardens and chief executive officers in Federal
installations, and this procedure does, just as you say, tend to
make uniform the treatment with respect to forfeiture of good time

I would also emphasize that the lack of an automatic
review in the lesser disciplinary actions is more a formal
matter than a real matter because any prisoner who is subject to
disciplinary action of any sort has available the prisoners'
mailbox through which he can send uncensored, unread mail to
any member of the Executive Branch, including the Attorney
General, the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, and any
Congressman.

And as a. matter of fact, any judge.

And the

result is that those claims are referred to the legal office
of the Bureau of Prisons and they are reviewed there and often
the legal office, I am told, investigates on the scene to
determine the proprietary of disciplinary action.
The principal differences between the standards of
Morrissey and S carpe Hi and present Federal procedures lies in
four areas.

The first is the right to confront and cross-

examine adverse witnesses.

The second is the right to full

disclosure in every case of all the evidence that may be relied
upon.

The third is the unqualified right to present witnesses

of your own.

And the fourth, of course, is the right to counsel

Those are rights that are, of course, associated with

15
criminal prosecution.

Parole and probation revocations

I think much more closely resemble criminal prosecution in their
effect upon the individual’s liberty than does a prison
disciplinary hearing.

The individual in the former may be,

as this Court has put it, condemned to suffer grievous loss.
The prison inmate is in a different position.

He has already

been convicted of a crime and 'is living in a prison and has
already been deprived of liberty in the most pervasive manner.
He lives, in fact, in a thoroughly regulated and controlled
. ^
society.

- *
When he is brought up for disciplinary action, he

faces a range of sanctions, ranging from reprimand,

temporary

loss of television viewing time, perhaps a period in segrega­
tion, at the utmost a forfeiture of good time.

The deprivations

he faces in that sense are minimal and not on the same scale
of magnitude as those faced b'y a man who is liable to be
removed from free society and put behind prison walls for a
period of years.

Thus I think the private interest affected

in prison disciplinary actions doesn't suggest, much less
require, that Morrissey-Scarpelli standards be applied to those
actions.
When we look at the other factor in the due process
equation, the governmental function involved, I think it
becomes apparent that in the prison setting, the MorrisseyScarpelli standards are not only not appropriate, they are

16
impossible.

We can start by considering the asserted right to

confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.

Suppose that an

inmate observes other prisoners beat a man senseless or perhaps
he observes group homosexual rape.

If that witness must be

produced at a disciplinary hearing, identified, confronted, and
cross-examined and then returned to a prison population, it may
be doubted that he will have a life worth living and in fact
it may be doubted that he will be allowed to continue to live
his life, and the Federal prisons, as other prisons, have had
just such episodes of the murder of inmate informers.

Transfer

to other Federal prisons does not solve the problem because
enough prisoners move between the prisons that the man is
again identified in his new prison, and we have had murders of
men who had been transferred because they have informed in a
prior prison.
I think we should consider also what effects that
kind of a procedure would mean for prison life for the rest of
the prisoners and for the ability of the Bureau of Prisons to
carry out its mission.

Witnesses to prison violence or to the

acquisition of drugs, weapons, or other contraband simply
cease to come forward.

They would be completely unwilling to

subject themselves to identification and to reprisal.

And

without information on such matters, it would be impossible
for the Federal prisons to maintain discipline, and without
that, it would be impossible to try to effect rehabilitation.

17
Prisons would become in effect jungles ruled by bands of
violent inmates.
Under such circumstances, I thinlc the possibility
of an existence for inmates that could be termed human would
be impossible, and certainly there would be no question of
rehabilitation.

And I might point out that the latest figures

indicate that despite the fact that the Federal prisons are
steadily receiving a tougher and more sophisticated band of
criminal, still their recidivism rate is declining gradually.
I don’t thinlc the Constitution can be interpreted
to require that kind of inhumanity to the very persons it is
invoked to protect.

It xvould be an irony, I think, if due

process were interpreted to require savagery within the prisons.
The right to counsel poses similar problems, one of
them a, sheer burden.

In fiscal 1973 there were 19,000

disciplinary proceedings within the Federal prisons.

So that

a right to counsel would impose a staggering burden.

But more

importantly, I think, the presence of lawyers on both sides
would change the procedure completely from one that is aimed
to rehabilitation to one that is aimed towards confrontation
and delay.

As the Scarpelll opinion itself recognized, when

you bring counsel into an informal proceeding and make it
formal, you change the nature of the proceeding altogether.
Changing these from rehabilitative and corrective
procedures and rather informal discussions between an adjustment

18
board and the prisoner and turning it into a confrontation
between the accused and the prosecution is bound to polarize
the prison community with a consequent increase in tensions
and violence.

I think we can see that on a minor scale.

Anyone

who has lived for example through the recent period of turmoil
in the universities knows what happens when ordinary and
■A

informal disciplinary processes are suddenly made formal.

The

demand for rights and procedures is in itself a sign of anger,
and when they are granted to a close community, the result is
to insure polarization.

Every disciplinary trial in a law

school becomes a contest betx<reen the student body and the
faculty.

When convictions occur, disruptions break out.

If

that occurs in the best law schools in this country, and it
did, I think we can imagine what is going to happen in the
Federal prisons if we go through the same kind of a process.
We have within the Federal prisons & large body of men, many
of vrhom have already demonstrated their propensity for violence.
I don’t think, therefore, these rights belong in the Federal
disciplinary proceedings.
I will say more than a word about the prisonerattorney mail matter.

In the Federal prisons, mail goes out

unopened and unread to attorneys.

Mail that comes in is

examined only for contraband -- money, drugs, weapons, and so
forth.

If the prisoner wishes and. the attorney wishes, that

mail will be opened only in the presence of the inmate so it

19
cannot be censored and cannot be read.
discovered.

Only contraband can be

I think that is a minimal safeguard and one that’s

entirely proper and necessary.
In sum, the United States thinks the decision of
the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, insofar as it
applies Scarpelli and Morrissey rules should be reversed.

As

law, we think it insupportable; as penology, we think it
disastrous.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Duchek.

In view of

the lateness of the amicus brSlef filed by Solicitor General,
you may respond to that if you wish in the usual way.

A week

or ten days, what would you Tike?
MR. DUCHEK:

Ten days.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Ten days?

All right.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS F. DUCHEK
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. DUCHEK:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I think that perhaps a brief history of this case

would be in order at this time.
This case was originally filed by Mr. McDonnell, pro
se, in the United States District Court for the District of
Nebraska, and it was really -a broad scope and broad brush
challenge to most of the rules, practices and procedures of
the Nebraska penal and correction complex, In fact, the entire
rule book is attached as an exhibit to Filing 42, which is

it

•»

\ t

,

20
the stipulation of facts in this case.

Several of the

challenges were settled by stipulation in appropriate order
prior to trial.

Mail was no longer stopped that was meant for

judges; mail was no longer censored and deleted that was meant
for judges.

Certain library rules were loosened, and other

relief was given by consent or by stipulation in appropriate
order at trial.
However, the case was appealed to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and then the plaintiff,
Mr. McDonnell, filed a cross-appeal after the State appealed
from the trial court's decision.
The State decided to file a petition for writ of
certiorari to this Court, following the Court of Appeals’
decision, and raised five questions.

But it appears as though

three, really, are the thrust of the State's discussion before
this Court.
The first is, should Morrissey and Scarpelli rules
govern that prison disciplinary hearings

which may impose

serious penalties or a grievous loss on an inmate be conducted
in a fundamentally fair manner?

Do the Morrissey and Scarpelli

generally attach to prison disciplinary hearings?

The State

concedes that when good time sentence credits are involved
the Morrissey-Scarpelli procedures in a general fashion attach.
The Eighth Circuit has outlined four of those generally that
would attach.

21
Good time, although after Preiser v. Rodriguez could
not be restored in this action» still in this action to the
extent that it is a grievous

loss or a substantial penalty

which is present in every disciplinary hearing at the Nebraska
, V

penal and correctional complex, because good time in Nebraska
is conferred for good behavior and faithful performance of
duties, and when you are called up before the disciplinary
committee because of an alleged misconduct, the finding of the
investigation and the report of that committee when placed in
the inmate’s file will affect the eligibility of that inmate
to accumulate future good time and to be eligible for
consideration for release on parole or mandatory release under
supervision at a certain time in his sentence.
QUESTION:

...

the State proceedings to review of

the deprivation of good time?
MR. DUCHEK:

The Eighth Circuit asked the parties

to address themselves to that point after the case was under
submission by the Eighth Circuit.

And Mr. Kammerlohr and I

did do that in letters to the Eighth Circuit, and that is noted
in a footnote in the Court of- Appeals' opinion.

It was my

argument in the letters that we addressed to the Eighth Circuit
that there really is no adequate State remedy and the Court of
Appeals reserved that decision for the district court on remand.
Nebraska does not have a great writ like the Federal great writ
Its

writ is only available to challenge the legality of the

22
sentence in that was the sentence imposed within the confines
of the statutory mandate.
QUESTION:

Is that true even under the new Post

Conviction Relief Act?
MR. DUCHEK:

Is that followed in the case of Nebraska?
It is my understanding that the Post

Conviction Relief Act that it would not be available as a method
to challenge a matter in the prison affecting your good time
credit» because that has to cfo with the proceeding whereby you
were incarcerated in prison.
QUESTION:

Mr. Duchek, the appendix, as I read it,

does not set out the complaint in full.

I take it Mr. McDonnell

was the only named plaintiff in this action.
MR. DUCHEK:

Am I right?

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the complaint

reads Robert 0. McDonnell, individually, and on behalf of all
prisoners in the same class a;s plaintiff incarcerated in Nebraska
penal and correctional complex, Lincoln, Nebraska, and on
behalf of all other persons who in the future may be confined.
QUESTION:

Did he allege in the complaint that each

of these procedures which are complained about had actually
occurred to him?
MR. DUCHEK:

I don't know that he alleged that each

of the procedures complained about had occurred to him.

Some

of the evidence that xvas produced at the trial and in preliminary
hearings demonstrated that each of the complained procedures
had taken place against members of the inmate class, and

23
QUESTION:

Of course, we have held that a person

can’t represent a class of which he is not a member.

And I

would think you might have some standing problem unless he had
alleged that each of the things about which the complaint
sought adjudication had occurred to him.
MR. DUCHEK:

He alleged that they had either occurred

to him, as I remember the complaint and as his complaint was
drafted, or their presence chilled his rights to exercise
certain other of his rights which the regulations appeared to
prohibit.

The court made findings under rule XXIII-C that

the plaintiff class representative, R. 0. McDonnell, was a
proper representative, that there were questions of law and
fact common to the class,that Robert 0. McDonnell was a proper
person to present such questions of lav/ and fact to the court
and that there were common grievances and that common relief
't*

.

would he appropriate.
QUESTION:

Where is that found?

MR. DUCHEK:

That is found in 342 Fed. Sup. in a
found
paragraph that says the courts*Ahis is a proper class action,
and it is found at, I believe, paragraph 13 or 14 of the
amended complaint where we set forth the allegations as to the
class.
QUESTION:

Do you have a record citation, or is it

in the appendix?
MR. DUCHEK:

What is that, Mr. Justice Relinquish?

24
QUESTION:
MR. DUCHEK:

The finding you are referring to.
If you will look in the brief of the

Nebraska’s petition for certiorari at Appendix 2, on page -well
QUESTION:
MR. DUCHEK:

Somewhere in the district court -That's right, your Honor.

I am sorry

I don't have that marked.
QUESTIOK:
MR. DUCHEK:

Don't waste your time looking for it.
Thank you.

But if you will check

Appendix 2 in the petition for certiorari, you will see that
the court made an express finding that it was a proper class
action.
I would point out that in the amended complaint,
only the inmate class representative sought restoration of the
good time he lost, and the balance of the amended complaint
seeks preparatory and injunctive relief as to the legal rights
and relations of the plaintiff inmate class and the persons
who are named as parties defendant.
The real thrust of the Morrissey and Scarpelli issues
before the Court today can be found in the languge in Morrissey
that says that whatever the State and society has at stake in
these cases, whatever possibility there is to return the
inmate to a useful and normal life within the law.

Morrissey

goes on to say the State and society have no interest in
having erroneous factual determinations which can impose --

25
which find that a person has violated conditions of parole
or prison conduct rules, and the State or society has absolutely
no interest in taking action in response to a finding of
misconduct which factual record doesn't clearly indicate the
response that is required.

Therefore, it is really society's

interest that is perhaps paramount in this case because, as
the Joint Anti-Facist League case points out, Justice Frankfurter
concurring opinion, this society, a democratic one and a popular
one, will only continue to be effective when not only is justice
clone toward an individual but the community sees that justice
is done.
Now, when an inmate is called before the disciplinary
hearing, be it for a substantial allegation of misconduct in
which he can be placed in the hole or segregation, and in which
he can have a notation made in his record that will continually
I

affect his eligibility for release under parole or some early
release, or when he/

placed in a dry cell, has anything

taken against him in the prison that results in his being
removed from the prison population and put in a solitary state
where he is isolated from other prisoners, from the programs
of the prison, from the privileges which would normally attach
to his movement within the prison society -- and I think these
privileges parallel to some extent what the Chief Justice
described as the other enduring attachments of everyday life
available to a person when he is outside the Prison -- when the

26
inmate comes before the disciplinary committee hearing and
has these kinds of interests at stake, then he faces a grievous
loss and a substantial penalty

which our society has always

held that due process is meant to protect.
Why would the Bureau of Federal prisons and the
States provide the real wealth of protection that are currently
provided if it was not recognizing that it was,one,imposing
a penalty on this individual for alleged misconduct or, tiro,
taking some action that substantially affected the individual.
I would direct the Court's attention to Appendix A
of the brief of the respondent which contains the chart of
disciplinary proceedings xvhich are currently given by the
various penal systems in the country.

It was prepared by

a division of the American Bar Association, and it sets out
nicely and by percentages what elements of disciplinary process
are currently provided.
QUESTION:

Well, the only ones you are complaining

of here apparently are the solitary confinement and being
placed in a dry cell.
MR. DUCHEK:

Well, I think there has to be some

definition made of what is a grievous loss.
QUESTION:
MR. DUCHEK:

Pardon?
I think there does have to be a

definition or a determination made of what amounts to a grievous
loss xtfhen an inmate is to be punished inside a prison.

The

27
respondent believes -QUESTION:

I don’t find that in anything that has

been decided so far.
MR. DUCHEK:

Wells 1 think the Court of Appeals

said that any time there was a substantial penalty which could
be imposed, such as solitary confinement or placement in a
dry cell
QUESTION:

Those a'ife the only two you mentioned in

your brief.
MR. DUCHEK:

That’s correct, your Honor.

additionally the effect on good time.

And then

I think that any time

that good time is to be taken from an inmate -QUESTION:
MR. DUCHEK:
that.

They elimiminated that.
I don’t understand what they meant by

They did remand the case for hearings-to determine
•

n

k

and this gets to the final judgment question that was asked
in my opinion also -- they did remand the case for hearings to
determine itfhat procedures were necessary to give procedurally
fair process, and if those procedures were being met except
that the court in the district court could not restore good
time.
QUESTION:

Are there some disciplinary procedures

the end result of which would not be and can never be loss of
good time?
MR. DUCHEK:

Well, I wouldn’t think there vv'as.

28
QUESTION:

You don’t think there were.

MR. DUCHEK:
QUESTION:

Not under the definition of how good
I suppose where one has not accumulated

good time, obviously -MR. DUCHEK:

That's right.

Well, you can only

accumulate good time by good behavior and faithful performance
of duties, and you are called before the disciplinary committee
hearing -- and again, there are very few prisoners that are
called before the disciplinary hearing.

The appendix points

out most are resolved at what Nebraska calls the investigation
stage where confrontation and cross-examination takes place,
by the way.

If you are called before the disciplinary committee

hearing and the report goes in your file, that surely must be
an indication that you have not been faithfully performing
your duties or on good behavior.

Therefore, while accumulated

good time is not forfeited necessarily, and that may be what
you were getting at, certainly while you are placed in solitary
confinement, it doesn’t appear that the prison will be crediting
you with any good time there because you had failed -QUESTION:

Well, I gather your answer is that there

is a risk in every disciplinary proceeding, whether it. is a
hearing before the committee, that one may either lose
accumulated good time or risk accumulation in the future of
good time.
MR. DUCHEK:

I cannot see how it can be interpreted

29
and understood any other way, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Then your submission is we ought to treat

all the problems raised by this case against that background?
MR. DUCHEK:

I think that to consider placement in

solitary confinement and to consider placement in a dry cell
without realizing that you are also considering good time
accrual is not to give the case its full attention.

And I

think the case warrants that the Court understand that that
is what’s involved.
I understand that there may be some Preiser v.
Rodriguez issues in this case, but I think that the Court of
Appeals resolved those by saying that the preparatory and
injunctive relief could be entered, but good time could not
be restored.

If relief is given for those situations in which

an inmate can

be

placed in solitary

or confined to

a

dry cell

a fortiori, good time will also be affected because they won’t
give any less protection for those kinds of matters than they
will for the other kind of matters.
There has been much attention made and raised towards
this idea of counsel.

And I think it's important for the

Court to know that this respondent and this plaintiff has never
asked that counsel be provided in a good time hearing.

We have

urged that a counsel substitute is necessary and counsel
substitute is provided in Nebraska, and this plaintiff has
offered that counsel substitute, I am informed, and that's not

30
in the record anywhere, but the prisoners recognize him as
someone who can be an effective person to help explain their
side of the story.
Now, counsel substitute can be any number of people.
It can be a staff member; it can be another inmate; it can be
a law student.

There is a law student program at Nebraska.

However, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals did go the one
step farther when Gagnon came down and said in those instances
where fundamental fairness requires it and where I take it
there is a timely and tolerable claim

a request for counsel

based on a timely and tolerable claim, et cetera, that then
counsel should be afforded.
Nov/, the examples raised by the Solicitor General
are interesting in that regard, and they also get to this
idea of the impossibility of giving fundamental fairness in
a prison situation.

If there was an assault, an assault and

battery on another prisoner, if there was a forcible rape, I
would understand those to be matters of conduct for which
prosecution is possible.
handled by prosecution.

In fact, they are probably best
And if that’s the case, there is going

to have to be a v/itness called forward and there is going to
have to be evidence put on, and that v/itness is going to swear
and be on the stand.
QUESTION:

Don’t you want to leave with the prison

administration some range of discretion as to whether or not

31
they should treat an infraction o£ rules as a criminal act or
merely a disciplinary?
MR. DUCHEK:
does the respondent.

I certainly do, Mr. Chief Justice, as
And this will be the gray area where

rehabilitory prison expertise can best exercise.

But Morrissey

also provides room for those instances that the Solicitor
General has raised, where it is simply for security reasons
impossible to disclose the identity of the informant.
Now, I would put it to the Court that if

a'

man

is x-irritten up for the kind of situations described by the
Solicitor General, he is going to have a pretty good idea,
if a guard didn’t see it, that one of the members of the party
told the administration about it or that one of the members in
the party told someone else about it so it is going to get
back to the participants one way or the other.

This record,

the record now before the Court in the great majority of
instances will disclose employees instigating the write-up.
In fact, testimony

yin the appendix never once mentions an

inmate instigating the write-up.

It talks about a supervisor

or an employee seeing conduct he believes is not proper conduct
in initiating the write-up.
In that regard, Mr. Kammerlohr couldn’t bring a
certified copy of the statute to the Court, but there are new
rules at the Nebraska prison which have been in effect since
October of 1973.

I believe they are reflected in the chart

32
which is in the appendix in the respondent's brief, and they
are also briefly discussed in appendix B to the respondent's
brief which is a recapitulation of certain rights prepared by
the New Jersey Attorney General's Office in a lawsuit there.
Counsel substitute is now part of the Nebraska proceeding,
and if the Court will read Warden Wolff’s testimony at one of
the evidentiary hearings in this matter, the Court will note
that in the investigative stage of the Nebraska prison
disciplinary proceeding, a corrections officer calls before
him the accused inmate and the person -- and it’s usually a
job supervisor -- who did the accusing, and he sits them down
before him so that they may talk about the alleged misconduct.
Now, that is confrontation in a very real sense of the term.
They are there together.
The record does not really bear out in very much
detail what kind of cross-examination goes on, but I don't
think that adversarial cross-examination is what anybody is
talking about.

I think they are talking about a kind of

testing of the evidence that this system, this Anglo-American
system, always found necessary and always found the only way
to make actual determinations when persons are to suffer a
grievous loss or a substantial penalty to their living
conditions.
As the Court pointed out in, I believe it’s a footnote
in Scarpelli, and I think it's a sound belief, the State has

33

it within its pov^er to very creatively respond to the burdens,
the constitutional burdens, that this Court hands down because
of what it feels is constitutionally required.

And I have

every confidence that not only the Bureau of Prisons but the
State of Nebraska and all the States can respond in a creative
fashion to any constitutional mandate this Court would hand
down.

And all that we’re talking about is basic fundamental
>■....

.

fairness that, to my thinking, is the foundation upon which
our system is constructed.
The idea that some 'of the things which we are
requesting in this case are in the antithesis of good penology
is subject to much debate.

In organizing this case, an

indigent prisoner in Nebraska' penal complex does not have at
his command the resources that certainly the Solicitor General
"-•tv.

and the United States Government has at hand or for that
matter that the State of Nebraska has at hand.

And therefore,

the respondent had to assign some responsibilities and ask
for some help in this area.
On March 7 we came 'to Washington and we had a meeting
with certain groups that mightbe called public interest, groups
to assign and dole out areas of responsibility on the briefs
with the only thought in mind' if we could prevent overlapping
the amicus brief would save this Court’s time in reading things
that it had read before.

Therefore, I would specifically

direct the Court's attention, ©specially, to the amicus brief

34
of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency which the
respondent believes does answer some of the questions about
sound penology which the Solicitor General has raised.

That

amicus brief in summary does point out that by reducing the
sense of injustice felt by most prisoners, the provision for
due process protections in disciplinary hearings alleviates
prison tensions and enhances the possibility for a corroborative
institution.
In 1870 the American Prison Administrators Society,
the American Prison Association in its declaration of principles
acknowledged that an inmate should play an integral part in
his own rehabilitation and should take responsibility for that.
I believe that opening up prison disciplinary hearings and
allowing for an input and a testing and a more formalization
of the determinations of facts which will have a substantial
impact on the prisoner is what the American Prison Association
was talking about in 1870.
There is an interesting notation in the case of
Carothers v. Follette which involved John D. Carothers who
was at the time in segregation.

He wrote a letter on

September 30 of 1969 to his parents

-- and he was later

disciplined for that letter by the way -- in, which he was
reacting basically to the fact that he was in solitary
confinement, and the bitterness and the frustration and the
complete rejection of the processes that had put him in solitary

35
confinement, I think really buttresses the National Council
on Crime and Delinquency's argument that to not implement
procedures which, one, are designed to bring about fair
results, but, two, are seen by the community at large to bring
about fair results is to really do a disservice in the American
correctional system that perhaps the Constitution mandates
nothing more than perhaps due process, mandates nothing more
than that the nature, the time and the duration and the nature
of a man's confinement bear some relation to the purposes of
his commitment.
QUESTION:

Could I ask you, what is the very first

step in Nebraska in a disciplinary proceeding?
MR. DUCHEK:
alleged misconduct.

Well, there would be an observation of
Right?

Then, as I understand it, there

would be a formal —
QUESTIO:

Not "would be."

Is.

There is, this is

the existing procedure.
MR. DUCHEK:
remark.

Well, let me then just make one preparator

I think the existing procedures, as I have them, there

has been a thought that everything is stayed, the mandate of
the Court of Appeals that was' stayed

holds everything in limbo,

and it's very difficult to know what is actually being done
there.

But I believe what is being done is after the write-up

after the observance of misconduct, there is a formal write-up
<of that incident, a notation made of it on a form

that the

36
prison has designed.

That form then goes to the Chief

Corrections Officer, and he looks at that form and he sees, one,
who did the writing up or who is doing the accusing, the
accusation, who made the charge, and, two, who is the accused.
That is the Chief Corrections Officer's responsibility to
conduct an investigation into the allegation of misconduct.
And he proceeds to conduct that investigation, and he does that
by bringing the person that is doing the accusing and the
accused into his presence and sitting them down, I would take
it, and discussing with them this charge.

And he has at his

command the ability to make such further investigation as
is required.
QUESTION:

That is the procedure which you think

doesn't go far enough, is inadequate to satisfy constitutional
rights, just that kind of an informal hearing.
MR. DUCHEK:

If that was done in front of the

disciplinary committee which had to make the decision about
what kind of disposition -QUESTION:

But it never gets to the disciplinary

committee until or unless the correctional officer sends it.
MR. DUCHEK:

That's right.

The correctional officer

if he can't resolve it at that point, the testimony in the
record is that most are resolved at that point.
QUESTION: That’s one of the things I wanted to ask
you about.

I take it that the vast majority of disciplinary

37
matters are resolved at that point.
MR. DUCHEIC:

That is the testimony of Warden Wolff.

QUESTION:

Do you object to that phase of the --

MR. DUCHEK:

No.

a substantial penalty
QUESTION:

At that point there would not be

or a grievous loss.
How about your counsel or help right?

Are you going to say there is' a need for representation at
what amounts to a plea of guii'ty?
MR. DUCHEK:

No, sir.

Again, because at this time,

as I understand it, it does not go to the disciplinary
committee.
QUESTION:

But if tlie prisoner says* yes, I did do

that, then you say the officer disposes of it at that' time.
MR. DUCHEK:
QUESTION:

That's' right.
How does he dispose of it?

MR. DUCIIEK:

He

disposes by reprimand or he says,

O.K., you better stay out of the cafeteria for a week, or you
better not watch TV -QUESTION:

What if he says -- does he have the

power to put him in solitary confinement?
MR. DUCHEK:
committee then.

No.

That moves on to the disciplinary

That was exactly what I was going to come to.

If he thinks it is of such substantial nature that the
disciplinary committee has to’ impose punishment, then he would
send it on.

38
QUESTION:

With the report that the prisoner has

admitted the matter?
MR. DUCHEIC:

To some extent, yes.

is what would be in his report.

I take it that

And this then would be where

perhaps the Gagnon ideas might come into this.
Let’s say that there was a reason that the conduct
occurred, a reason which the inmate would like to explain.
Well, at that hearing, perhaps the inmate would need counsel
substitute to present his case.

I think the better approach

would be, frankly, .if the matter cannot be resolved ac that
level, that there be a factual hearing in front of the
disciplinary committee.
QUESTION:

Yes, but let’s suppose there aren't any

factual matters involved.

Let’s assume there is an admission,

yes, these events occurred.
MR. DUCHEK:

All right, so you are just sending it

on to the disciplinary committee for -QUESTION:

Because T take it the chief correctional

officer hasn't got the power to impose certain kinds of
punishment.
MR. DUCHEK:
QUESTION:

I think that’s the case, yes.
All right, you still would say counsel

or some substitute.
MR. DUCHEK:

Well, to the extent that the disciplinary

committee feels it needs to Have an adequate factual record

39
before it to judge this conduct so that it may impose the
kind of sanctions against, this prisoner that are directed
toward rehabilitation.

It is respondent's position that an

orderly hearing has to be held -QUESTION:

They don't even do that in criminal trials

when you are getting a presentence report.

Well, the presentence

report the accused doesn't participate in making.
MR. DUCHEK:

They do in Nebraska, your Honor, to the

extent -QUESTION:
MR. DUCHEK:

Many times they don't even see it.
The accused participates to the extent

that he has an interview with the probation officer.
QUESTION:

He has had that here.

He has; been brought

before the Chief Corrections Officer and allowed to say anything
he wants to say.
MR. DUCHEK:

That'S-' right.

I would assume that he

could -- well, if he admits it, your Honor, quite frankly,
the problem is not as great as if he denies it.
contest that for a moment.
QUESTION:

I will not

If’ he denies it, though --

In other words, you will concede that if

he had admitted it, all that gets to the disciplinary committee
is the correction officer's report which includes the admission.
Perhaps without violating constitutional guarantees the
disciplinary committee may impose discipline without affording
him any kind of a hearing?

40
MR. DUCHEK:

Well, it would seem that if the prisoner

wants to present a version of the story to justify
QUESTION:

Does he have notice?

, MR. DUCHEK:

Yes, he would have notice.

QUESTION:

So he does get all the facts.

MR. DUCHEK:

Notice of the disciplinary committee

hearing, even after the confrontation before the Chief
Investigating Officer, he will have notice.
QUESTION:

So at the time he gets there and he would

say, well, what, the corrections officer report states is true,
I did all those things, that would be the end of it, you think?
MR. DUCHEK:

I think that if he wanted to have

assistance in explaining x^hat happened and why it happened,
counsel substitute would be appropriate.

And as I understand

it in Nebraska he would get it.
QUESTION:

In other words, if he said, "Well, look,

I know, that's so, but this is why,"

then he has to be allowed

some help.
MR. DUCHEK:

That's right.

These are not articulate

people.
QUESTION:

You say in Nebraska he ought to have a

counsel substitute and he gets it.

Well, ivhat is this case

about in that aspect?
MR. DUCHEK:

Well, we are here as respondent and in

that aspect I'm not quite certain, your Honor.

41

QUESTION:

You. mean he gets it under the Eighth

Circuit’s decision?
MR, DUCHEK:
QUESTION;

Well —
You don't know what he gets, do you, right

now.
MR. DUCHEK;
QUESTION;

I have the rules, your Honor.

But you don't know what actually happens

as of now.
MR. DUCHEK;

I have the rules and I know what R„ 0.

McDonnell tells me usually happens.

I also know that the

decision of the Court of Appeals, the mandate has been stayed.
And you heard Mr. Kemmerlohr attempt to explain that they are
in a little limbo out there about what they are supposed to do.
But I believe that the chart that’s in the appendix -which was
prepared by Warden Wolff, the responses of Warden Wolff, will
indicate what they are doing as of the date of the chart.
QUESTION;

Then the answer is yoxi don't know what

they are doing today.
MR. DUCHEK;

That’s correct, except I know —

QUESTION:

That’s the only question I have.

QUESTION:

Is this disciplinary committee hearing

something where the Eighth Circuit opinion went further than
you really think the Constitution required it to go?
MR. DUCHEK:
QUESTION:

No.
The colloquy between you and Justice White

MR, DUCHEKs

No, I don’t believe so.

1 believe that

the colloquy between Mr. Justice White and myself would be
perfectly within the decision of the Eighth Circuit.
QUESTION :

But is it the existing practice in Nebraska

so far as you know ?
MR. DUCHEK:

To the extent that I can read that chart

which spoke as of the date that's indicated in there, I think
It's October 1973, and to the extent that the evidence of
Warden Wolff in the record of this case said that most admit
their guilt and it would only go on to the disciplinary committee
for imposition of a substantial penalty, that's an accurate
description of what Nebraska now does, and I think that’s
within the mandate of the decision of the Eighth Circuit
Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

Did I understand you to say in

response to one of the questions, that under the present Nebraska
\
rules, at that point they have a counsel substitute?
MR. DUCHEK:

I know that they can have a counsel

substitute before the disciplinary committee.
QUESTION:

Under the Nebraska rules as distinguished

from the Court of Appeals opinion.
MR. DUCHEK:

The Court of Appeals only held — the

Court of Appeals held that Gagnon v. Scarpelli might dictate
certain instances where a lawyer is required, when fundamental
fairness requires a lawyer.

43
QUESTION;

And that's the fundamental difference

between the Court of Appeals and Nebraska.

Nebraska says

that Gagnon v. Scarpalli do not apply at all.
ME. DUCIIEK:
QUESTION:

Not to anything other than good time.
Yes.

MR. DUCHEK:

Exactly.

That's exactly right.

And to answer your question,. Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
I think to the extent that they feel Gagnon would never requite
a lawyer, ever, within a prison, that's part of their concern.
QUESTION:

Now, is it part of your submission that

in those instances where a qualified lawyer is not required
but a counsel substitute is, that Nebraska does not provide
an adequate substitute?
MR. DUCHEK:

No.

If I understand the question, it

seems to me that in most disciplinary proceedings a counsel
substitute, be it staff member, another lawyer, or law student,
because they would be there and they are a little better able
to organize, is fine.
QUESTION:
MR. DUCHEK:

And satisfies the due process.
That's right.

Procedures adequate to

meet the interests that are at stake, however informal,,
QUESTION:

So if you credit the testimony and the

statement in your brief, in the vast majority of the situations

-

there wouldn't be a fact-finding issue anyway.
MR. DUCHEK:

That's what I understand the situation

44
to be from the testimony.
QUESTION;

This chart to which you referred appears

you are talking a bout?

That's the chart.
Thank you.
You will notice that a hundred percent

QUESTION;

Does it come in the size you have it

MR. DUCHEK;

I can get it in this size.

I would be

happy to furnish it in this size.

That would be helpful.

It is difficult;

to read this one.
QUESTION;

Take the average age of the Court, I think

45
you are wise in doing it,
MU. DUCHEK:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Why don't I —

If you would submit it to the clerk, he

will inake a number of xerox copies.
MR. DUCHEK:

Why don't I just get you xerox copies

of the ADA study in total and submit those to the clerk?
The chart would point out a hundred percent of the
answering jurisdictions claimed,, and the chart defines "claimed"
simply to mean they said they did, and we didn't do any
hearings to determine whether or not it is true ™ a hundred
percent of the answering jurisdictions give written rules
specifying offenses and partial tribunal, inmate personally
appears, inmate hears the evidence, and inmate may make his
own statement.
Ninety-eight percent inmate receives copy of the
rules, inmate receives written notice of the charges, and
inmate receives prior notice of the hearing.
Eighty-four percent or higher, 39 percent

the

inmate may be represented by counsel substitute,•35 percent
based the decision solely on evidence of the hearing? the
decisions rendered in writing -n 38 percent of the time,
inmate has appeal in 4 percent of the time; and over 90 percent
of the time inmates may appeal the decision and records are
made of the hearing.
Seventy-nine percent of the jurisdictions allow a

46

brief continuancef and 54 percent an inmate may call witnesses,
and 64 percent inmate may confront witnesses, and in 57 percent
the inmate may cross-examine adverse witnesses.
Now, that cross-examination is not a trial type of
cross-examination by any scope of the imagination, and it is
described in greater detail in Appendix B of the brief of the
respondent which is that recapitulation from the Attorney
General of New Jersey.
Moving on to some of the other issues which have been
raised before this Court today, the respondent believes that,
with regard to the mail issue, that really the remedy fashioned
by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals is perhaps a simpler
method than that advocated by the State or perhaps allowed by
the Bureau of Prisons.

The amicus brief of the American Bar

Association on this issue points out that we do have a
substantial interest at stake, that being access to the courts
and attorney-client privilege, and that unless there is really
a probable cause or a reason to think that there might be
contraband in correspondence addressed to an inmate, is there
any justifiable reason to interfere with this preferred First
Amendment right?

It seems to the respondent that, having to

take the mail out and open it in the presence of the inmate,
have him come to a room where you open the mail in his presence
there, begins to get into and to make decisions that become
burdensome and that the most you would ever have to check on

47
the sender of the piece of mail would be once, and if you
determined it was a proper piece of mail to be delivered? it
could be delivered and that would be the end of the matter.
But it seems that the relief fashioned? not only
— this was fashioned by Judge Denny who in Nebraska is a
trial judge and felt this was a proper relief for the interest
involved on the Government side and on the inmate side — it
seems to the respondent that this is not burdensome and that
the argument of the respondent in this regard in his brief
as well as the argument of the amicus? the American Bar Associa­
tion, clearly underpins this position.
QUESTION:

What is the constitutional objection to

the system used in the Federal institutions where there is no
reading? there is no interception? but merely an examination
for contraband?

Do you see a constitutional objection to

that?
MR. DUCHEK:

Well? the constitutional objection

would perhaps be that First Amendment rights are preferred
and that —
QUESTION:

How is the First Amendment violated if

the content is not read at all?
MR. DUCHEK:
QUESTION:
MR. DUCHEK:
QUESTION:

Only by the delay? your Honor.
The actual opening.
That's right.
Does this record contain any information

40
about the frequency of narcotics being introduced into prisons
by mail?
MS. DUCHEK:

I don't believe it is reproduced in the

Appendix, but you will find it in the record, I believe in
volume III, which is a transcript of the preliminary hearing.
QUESTION:

This has been a significant problem.

Are

you aware of that?
MR. DUCHEK:

Yes, I am aware of that.

And Nebraska

said in the preliminary hearing testimony that it had devices
that could detect some drugs, and that’s part of the reason
that I think the trial court was influenced in the decision
it made.
QUESTION:

Well, if the prison authorities in a

given instance are willing to take on what is a very substantial
burden in terms of the use of personnel of opening but not
reading, do you really see in this context a significant
constitutional problem?
MR. DUCHEK:

The constitutional issue is the exchange

of ideas, your Honor, and that must be sacrosanct, however
that can be done.
QUESTION:

And the Federal practice doesn't interfere

with the exchange of ideas, does it?
MR. DUCHEK:

Not if it’s properly run, no.

I think to the extent that mail is ever opened, there
is the possibility that something would be read.

If it's not

49
read, then the First Amendment is protected — protection is
afforded.
One thing which the respondent would like to talk
about briefly is this idea of expungement from the record of
determinations of misconduct arrived at in hearing which did
not provide the inmate procedural due process protection»

,

Expungement is not retroactive application of procedural
rights at all.

It is simply giving the full application of

the law to the decision that has been reached and that has
traditionally been the practice of this Court, and Li-nklo'.
Walker was a deviation from that practice.
QUESTION:
MR. DUCHEK:
revocations

It wasn’t in the Morrissey case, was it?
Well, it was held that future parole

would be conducted —

QUESTION:
MR, DUCHEK:

According to the Morrissey standards.
But really the situations are

entirely different because the inmate is in the prison and
lie is going to stay in the prison, and expunging from his
record determinations of misconduct held in hearings where
the facts are unreliable is not going to allow the prisoner
for any earlier release.

It may allow him for earlier
But in those situations where the

prison feels society's interest is that there be a notation
in this man’s record of serious misconduct, they can hold
the hearing.

QUESTION:
ago.

What if the events occurred five years

You say there are no problems about conducting now a

given proceeding?
MR. DUCHEKs

I recognize those problems.

But I

think they can try to hold the hearings, and again it doesn’t
allow a man to get out, it only allows him to be considered.
QUESTION;

The Morrissey holding did not provide

for retroactive effect.

It was recognized that some people

might have had a parole revoked pre-Morrissey in circumstances
where conceivably it might not have been finally revoked
after Morrissey.

And that was a deprivation of almost total

freedom, wasn’t it?
MR. DUCIIEK: You're right.
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Whereas here it. isn't a deprivation of

total freedom, hut discipline.
MR. DUCHEKs

I just think that the burden on the

State is so much more less, expunging the record is so much
less that there need not be the kinds of considerations about
giving this decision for application of the law that would
attach to a decision like Morrissey where you are turning
somebody loose perhaps.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Hammerlohr.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELVIN KENT KAMMERLOHR
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to

comment for a moment on rebuttal.
First, on the question of raising good time problems,
the question of good time in this civil rights action, which
this case is, rather than in a habeas corpus proceeding as
required by Preiser v. Rodriguez, I would like to merely point
out that in Preiser, as the Court specifically points out,
there is not only direct good time involved, but these men,
aithough the petitioner, I believe, as you asked, Mr. Justice
Rehnquist, in that case also did not accumulate good time
while they were in segregation as a result of the disciplinary
proceeding for which they lost good time.

So they were both,

the good time and the good time which did not accumulate.
And this Court there said nevertheless you must bring a habeas
corpus unless you are asking for damages.

And, of course, the

damage' issue is not in this case either.
Secondly, we answered the Eighth Circuit when
Preiser came out, they asked us for a supplement, and the
State of Nebraska answered the Eighth Circuit that we did
have declaratory judgment remedy, mandamus remedy, and
possibly mandatory injunction remedy to the question in State
courts whether or not good time is being deprived, illegally
since the good time is provided for by statute.

52
Next I would like to point out briefly, or emphasize
one more time, that I think it is a very serious question
v/hether an inmate has a grievous loss in any of these
situations.

I think his grievous loss is back when the court

sentenced him to that penitentiary or when the court decided
to revoke that probation.

As this Court knows much better

than I do, we have come a long way on the question of what's
cruel and unusual punishment since the Constitution, from
disembowelment, pillories and all that kind of punishment
we used to have.

But I think the basic question really

involved is a prison, or are some prisons cruel and unusual
punishment?

If not, what is contemplated when a judge

sentences a man to this place, is that not his grievous loss?
Pointing out the statute that is cited in our brief
at the beginning of our brief, in Nebraska the statute says
the court shall determine when it sentences a man how much
time he shall spend in solitary confinement, what period of
his sentence.

So suppose a judge says, "I sentence you to

one year in solitary confinement."
punishment?

That seems to me has to be answered first..

QUESTION:
your State?

Is that cruel and unusual

Is that practice followed generally in

Does the sentencing judge when he imposes sentence

specify how long a period is to be spent in solitary confinement?
MR. KAMMERLQHR;
very often.

I don't believe it is, your Honor,

I believe they usually have a pat phrase that

53
they say.

"No part of this sentence shall be in solitary

confinement except for violation of prison rules,” is pretty
much the standard wording of it.
QUESTION:

So the —

MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

I am just saying it could be possible.

But it's pretty much of a dead letter so

far as the facts are ~MR. KAMMERLOHR:

But it happens all over the United

States, your Honor, in county jail cases where a person may
be sentenced to — especially in smaller counties, where a
person is sentenced to a county jail and there may not be
another prisoner in there for months and he might spend a year
in county jail, up to a year for misdemeanors, and so on.
QUESTION:

Well, that’s not the ordinary concept of.

solitary confinement of being alone in a great big jail.
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

There aren’t any programs.

Some of

these county jails have as many cells as for maybe 12 people,
but there may be only one person in there for a long time, or
maybe one here and one over there somewhat.
QUESTION:

What in the world has that got to do with

this case?
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

It’s the question of what is cruel

and unusual punishment.
QUESTION:

Is that allegation in here?

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

No, your Honor.

But the question

54
of a grievous loss is in here.

And I'm merely saying that the.

QUESTION:

I understand you to be saying the State

of Nebraska could go on and quarter it, but since they didn’t
go that far, they could go anywhere else they want to go.

Is

that your argument?
MR. KAMMERLOHRs
QUESTION:

That’s part of it, your Honor, yes.

I thought it was.

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

Yes.

I believe that this is a question which needs to be
answered, your Honor, Mr. Justice Marshall, that if we send
them to prison, what is contemplated.
QUESTION:

Take it for the State of Nebraska, as its

law officer, you make a statement like that.
MR. KAMMERLOIIR:

I'm just saying what is contemplated

when w@ send them to prison, your Honor.

I'm not advocating

it by any means.
As I opened, and I would like to say in closing,
your Honors, I think we are all after the same thing.
after rehabilitation.

We are

We do have programs for work release

which are being expanded all the time.

We have extensive

parole programs, and all of these things are developing.

The

programs from what used to be done have come a long way, and
as this Court has stated many times, I believe

that these

evolving programs should be allowed to continue to develop

without the strict constitutional guidelines at this time*
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

Mr. Duchek, you appeared here by appointment of the
Court and at our request, and on behalf of the Court, I thank
you for your assistance not only to your client but to the
Court.
Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 11:20 a.m., the oral argument in
the above-entitled matter was concluded.]
