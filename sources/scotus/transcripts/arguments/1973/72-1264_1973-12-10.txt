MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first in 72-1264, Mayor of Philadelphia v. Educational Equality
League.
Mr. Mattioni?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN MATTIONI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. MATTIONI:

Mr„ Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This matter arises out of an action commenced in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania, wherein the respondents sued the Mayor of the
City of Philadelphia, then James H. J. Tate, and the members
of the Educational Nominating Panel.

The allegations made

contended that appointments to that panel discriminated on the
basis of race and therefore it was requested that the appoint­
ments made by the Mayor be stricken as invalidly made under the
Constitution.
In order to fully understand what the. case is all
about, it is necessary to understand something about the
educational home-rule charter provisions of the City of
Philadelphia and the method of selecting and appointing members
of the School Board.
In 1965, the electors of the City of Philadelphia
adopted a new home-rule charter establishing home rule and

4
a home-rule school district.

This was as a result of a com­

mission appointed by Mayor Tate which studied the problem and
the nature of the school district some years before the City
of Philadelphia having obtained almost complete home rule in
all other aspects.
The Legislature of the Commonwea1th of Pennsylvania
had authorized now, something new, home rule for the school
district of Philadelphia as well.
A commission was appointed and, because of various
problems,came up with what essentially is experimental — was
experimental in nature and also represented something of a
compromise.

The method of selecting members of the School Board

which is not in issue in this matter before the Court, was
determined essentially as follows;
The Mayor of the City of Philadelphia would appoint
13 members of the Educational Nominating Panel.

Those 13

members would in turn for each vacancy on the board recommend
initially three and, if the mayor requested, an additional three
persons from which the Mayor could make the appointments to the
Board of Education.
The 13 of — of the 13, 9 were required to be appointed
from certain classes of organizations within the City of
Philadelphia.

They were supposed to be city-wide in scope and

representative of such groups as the labor, commercial interests,
intergroup relations, parent-teachers associations, public

education representatives? general community organizations of
citizens? organizations for the purpose of improvement of local
government? higher education in the form of someone who is the
head of a higher education institution in the City of
Philadelphia? and a group concerned with the physical resources
of the city»
Q

Ware these groups indicated by name or by cate­

gory?
MR. MATTXONI:

By category? Your Honor.

They were not

—■ the charter did not specifically say Group X must be the one
from which appointments were made.? but rather said, for ex­
ample? with respect to labor organizations? a council or other
organization of labor organizations in the city.
not say that it had to be a particular one.

And it did

the charter? being aware and being concerned with the fact that
if you specified a particular organization now? that might go
out of existence in the future, or it might become invalid in
the sense that

although still in existence it might shrink in

size and not be city-wide.
Q

Mr. Mattioni? perhaps you have covered this.

want to be sure.

I

There is no attack made here on the composi­

tion of the school board itself as distinguished from the
panel?
MR. MATTIONI:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

The attack here is solely on the appointments made to the

6
Educational Nominating Panel, not to any appointments made to
the School Board or the School District of the City of Phil­
adelphia.
Furthermore, there is no attack made on the charter
scheme for appointments to the Board of Education, nor any at­
tack made on the validity of the nine categories, and then after
those nine there is four that — four appointments in essence
at large by the Mayor, where he has total discretion in terms
of those four.
As I say, I believe that this is essentially an ex­
perimental type concept, at least until this attack it seemed
to work reasonably well.
The heart or guts of the whole procedure was that you
wanted to have on this panel persons who represented in essence
all of the various kinds of problems that a School board and a
School district could come —* would have to deal with during
the course of its existence.

For example, as we all know, in

large urban school districts now, and indeed in many of the
smaller ones, there are frequently substantial labor-management
relations problems.

Of course, in Philadelphia, where we do not

escape this, in the last couple of years x-?e have been subjected
to rather extended and protracted labor disputes with school
teachers and labor disputes with other support personnel in the
school district.
The school board has to contend with economic problems

of rather major proportion.

And again the purpose of the

charter was to make sure that we had represented on the nominat­
ing panel people who could screen applicants and possible
nominees for the school board to insure that they met at least
minimally all of the necessary requirements.

And the concept

was to have people on the nominating panel who had expertise
in their particular areas, as for example an organization deal­
ing with inter-group relations, because it is quite clear that
urban school districts have substantial race relations problems
and other problems of a similar nature.

And I think this is

brought out by the fact that the head of the charter commission
wrote — and it is quoted in respondents' brief — the panel's
composition should be so arranged in the charter that it can
always constitute a balanced representation or cross-section of
the entire community, all of the community’s ethnic, racial,
economic, geographic elements and segments.
And the point here, and the reason why I am dwelling
on this is, it is important to understand that this charter
and this charter's scheme was intended to be representative in
a very much broader sense than simply on the basis of black
and white.

Respondents would have it that the only consider­

ation is representation on the basis of black and white.
I believe this is further borne out by the fact that
we are here dealing with the fourth largest city in the United
States, a city with a population of approximately two million

3
people, a city which has in its populace persons from all kinds
and all manner of racial and ethnic backgrounds.

For example,

there are large concentrations of Italian-Americans, RussianAmericans, German-Americans, there is a large concentration of
blacks, and of course blacks, like all other people, can't be
put into a bov/1 and mixed up, these are diverse peoples.

If

nothing else, they can be divided into tv/o broad general cate­
gories, blacks who were in Philadelphia for hundreds of years,
Who predated even the Constitution of the United States, and
those who are of very recent migration from areas in the South.
But in addition to that, in addition to the variations
in population, Philadelphia is a large industrial cit y*

It has

heavy industry, oil refineries, smelting industries, it is a
large commercial center, it has banks and brokerage houses and
stock exchanges, it has large commercial areas in retail sales
and the like.

It is a major port facility in the United States.

It is probably the third or fourth largest port in the United
States in terms of tonnage.

And Philadelphia, perhaps mox-e

important than all of these things, is known as a residentialcity,

And, of course, it is a city with problems, very sub­

stantial problems.

But those problems are being dealt with

here notwithstanding all of that.
Respondents came into court alleging

that Mayor Tate

was guilty of discrimination on the basis of race in making his
appointments to this Educational Nominating Panel.

This was

9

by the respondents almost entirely on a strictly statistical
basis.

But at no time in the court below did the respondents

ever prove that the statistics upon which they relied had any
statistical significance.

Not only did they not prove statis­

tical significance, but they never prove the practical and
actual significance in an ordinary, every day sense.
What they did prove was that in 1971 Mayor Tate ap­
pointed two blacks out of 13 members to the nominating panel,
that from 1965 through the appointments made by — in 1971,
blacks appointed to the nominating panel on the basis of an
average of two out of 13 or, in percentages, approximately 15.4
percent.
They also attempted to prove discrimination in ap­
pointments to the nominating panel on the basis of alleged dis­
crimination by Mayor Tata in his appointments to city govern­
ment, and that was purported to be done by establishing from
the records produced by the City of Philadelphia that of all of
the persons appointed -- not necessarily by the Mayor, but
employed by the City of Philadelphia, earning $24,000 or more,
that only approximately 9 or 12 percent — and the particular
percentage escapes me at the moment — were black, as opposed
to a population of 33 percent black, and that in the boards and
commissions, the Mayor appointed 12 percent blacks as opposed
to the same population of 33 percent.
The respondents went further than that and said that

10

because the population of the school district in terms of its
pupils was approximately G5 percent black, that this necessitated
some additional consideration of race, I believe in this instance
a new category never before sanctioned by any court, referenced
to the school population as opposed to the city population, a
person who should be considered as eligible for nomination —
appointment to the nominating panel.
Counting this, the petitioners submitted evidence —
first of all took the position that there was no statistical
significance proved, and second of all submitted evidence that
the Mayor’s appointments to various positions in city government
insofar as the relationship between black and white was con­
cerned was substantially better than private industry in the
' ,

i

same city, substantiallv better than national averages in the
United States, substantially better than other governmental
agencies.
More importantly, petitioners put in evidence which
was not contradicted in any way, shape or form, that the city
of Philadelphia's work force is 41 percent black, as opposed to
33 percent in the population; that 24 percent of the middle
management was black, that somewhere between 9 and 12 percent
of upper management was black.
Nov/, from this, of course, the respondents would de­
rive some kind of discriminatory pattern.

However, it was

further established that under then Mayor Tate's regime, as

11

chief executive officer of the City of Philadelphia, the pattern
of employment of blacks in all levels, in the lowest levels, in
middle management and upper management, had increased substan­
tially over the eight or nine or ten years that he had been in
office, that he had continually taken pains to insure that
qualified blacks were continuously appointed and promoted and
reappointed and repromoted as fast as could be done under the
circumstances, and without infringing upon the rights of any
other parson or persons in the community.
The only complaint in essence that respondents have
is that in their view it wasn't done fast.enough and because
there was some alleged statistical .under-representation of
blacks, that all of a sudden this had to prove racial discrim­
ination on the part of Mayor Tate.

But quite the contrary is

true when considered in complete context.
Respondents went one step further.

They said that

they proved actual discrimination on the part of Mayor Tate in
his appointments, and this goes back then to the question of
what that evidence was.

And bearing in mind that the District

Court judge who heard the evidence refused to find actual dis­
crimination, the Court of Appeals, on the other hand, found
that there was evidence of actual discrimination which was not
rebutted on the record.
We believe that the Court of Appeals clearly violated
rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because the

finding or the refusal to find discrimination by the District
Court judge was not clearly erroneous and was in fact supported
by substantial evidence in the record.

The only evidence of

alleged actual discrimination was the testimony of W. Wilson
Goode, who said that in 1369, two years before the actions of
which complaint is now made, Mayor Tate had publicly said
at the time the Mayor made a public statement that he was not
going to appoint any more Negroes to the board because in his
feeling they had adequate representation and that he was going
to appoint someone from the nominees to the 3oard of Education,
Well, I submit that that is rather thin ice upon
which to bottom a finding of actual discriminatory intent on
the part of the chief executive officer of the City of
Philadelphia,

Not only is that rather thin evidence, but it was

clearly refuted in evidence by the person who had been inst.ru- '
mental in making the appointments, acting as an aide to Mayor
Tate.

He specifically said that Mayor Tate was an old war

horse politician and that he took into account all of the
necessary things in his — one of his primary criteria in making
appointments was to be sure that everybody had adequate repre­
sentation on these kinds of boards or commissions, including
the nominating panel.
And of course, in the final analysis, the question
really comes down to looking at the Educational Nominating
Panel itself, considering what its purpose was, considering

13

what it was intended to do, intended to achieve, and how it
was intended to achieve it, a finding of discrimination, whethe
inferentially based on statistics, of which the significance
was never proved, or based upon the meager testimony of W.
Wilson Goode, which was contradicted and which was not accepte'3
by the trial judge who heard the testimony, is grossly unfair
to the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia.
Indeed, it does more harm to the City of Philadelphia
than good in every way, shape and form that could be imagined
or considered.
The respondents placed particular emphasis on several
decisions of this Court, and I believe that they rely most
strenuously upon Calvin Turner v. Fouchs, a decision by this
honorable court in Januarv of 1970.
The difficulty I believe with that, in placing reliance upon that case, which must of course be. read in tandem
with Carter v. Jury Commissioner of Green County, is that there
the issue involved appointments to a jury panel, a grand jury
panel which in turn then appointed the school board.

And the

evidence showed rather clearly and dramatically that discrim­
ination was involved in the selection of grand jurors by the
jury commissioners.

Noxtf, the jury commissioners in that case

stand essentially on a footing, on the same footing with the
Educational Nominating Panel in this case.

Interestingly

enough, the plaintiffs in that case wanted to set aside the

14
appointment of the jury commissioners, and this Court refused to
set aside that appointment, notwithstanding that all of the
jury commissioners were white, and notwithstanding it was proved
that they were guilty of discrimination.
In the matter before the Court now, there is not one
iota of evidence to establish that the Educational Nominating
Panel, the very panel which is being attacked by the respondents,
acted in any way in a discriminatory manner in making his recom­
mendations for appointment to the Mayor.

There isn't even a

contention made here that the Mayor discriminated in making his
appointments to the School Board.

That is the board whic^ is

charged with the responsibility of running the school system,
not the Educational Nominating Panel.

It was simply an instru­

ment to aid the Mayor in making nominations to the School Board.
Of course, the reason why no contention was made to
that affect is rather clear.
'•? .

‘ <:■' |

At the present time, 33 percent

of the School Board is black, and at the time that this case
wa£ in suit, 24 percent was black, and the School Board has
never been eithout black representation, nor has the Educational
Nominating Panel been without black representation.
Indeed, if the criteria sought to be established by
respondents were accepted by this Court, we would have an almost
insurmountable problem because every recognizable ethnic
minority, every recognizable minority of

any kind, be it

Asiatic, be it italian-American, be it Russian-American, black

15
American, would have the same right to proportional representa­
tion on this panel-

But this is a panel of 13 members, and

that is an impossibility.
Respondents5 witnesses testified, for example, that
the Puerto Rican-Americans in the City of Philadelphia were
absolutely entitled to representation on this panel.

But the

problem with that is that on a proportional basis they couldn’t
be entitled to representation because they represent less than
three percent of the population of the City of Philadelphia,
and one person on the Educational Nominating Panel represents
eight percent, so that they don't even have enough to say that
we are entitled to half of one person on the panel.

And if we

were to accept that proposition, then no person who was Puerto
Rican could ever be appointed to the panel because he is not
entitled to his proportion on that panel.

No person of

Chinese-American extraction in the City of Philadelphia could
ever be entitled to such representation because although we
have a strong and viable Chinese-American community in
Philadelphia, it is small, and it is too small to be entitled
to a proportionate share on this panel.
And so under those circumstances it would represent a
gross inequity to all other minorities, and indeed to those who
might be considered as a majority, if there is one, in any
urban center in the United States today.
Q

Mr. Mattioni, let me get this evidence in focus.

16

Is it correct to sav that —• well, 1 ask, is there any evidence
other than the statists Serial, the newspaper cogent, and f
the Deputy Mayor’s alleged lack of knowledge that supports the
decision of the Third Circuit here?
MR. MATTIONI:

I believe there is not, Your Honor.

I

believe, however, that respondents could point to one other
piece of evidence, and that is the fact that the School Board of
the City of Philadelphia is under an order to desegregate the
school system of the City of Philadelphia.

However, that

doesn’t really bear on the Nominating Panel, because the
Nominating Panel has absolutely no responsibility with respect
to running the School Board.
Q

One other question.

Is there any allegation of

discrimination here that is not directed personally to Mayor
Tate as distinguished from the current Mayor?
MR. MATTIOHI:
Q

1 believe there is not, Your Honor.

And yet you have injunctive relief granted.

MR. MATTIONI:

Well, the Court of Appeals indicated

that an injunction should be entered against the present Mayor
because Anthony Zecca, the Deputy Mayor to James Tate, is still
on the staff of Mayor Rizzo.

Of course, his position on that

staff is substantially different.
connection.
Q

That is the only nexus or

Other than that, there is none.
Is there any indication that the Deputy Mayor

who is held over exercises independent judgment free from the

17
Mayor's supervision?
MR. MATTIONI:

Absolutely none, Your Honor.

Of course, one thing I have not touched upon which
also should be kept in mind by this Court is the fact that we
are here dealing with the appointments by the chief executive
officer of the City of Philadelphia.

Of course, at first blush

one might say, well, what has that got to do with all of this?
I mean, after all, he is not the President of the United States.
But it has this much at least to do with it;

He is the chief

executive officer, he is clearly the representative of the
executive branch of government, and he — we are here dealing
within the context of the appointments to be made, a clear
question of executive discretion in the appointment power of
the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia.
Now, the Court of Appeals took the position that
petitioners had argued that if we could only refrain from in­
terference with appointments of the Mayor or chief executive
in terms of appointments that are close and personal, in other
words 1 think they were suggesting that only those personal
staff members of the chief executive officer were considered,
were entitled to any kind of protection.
We submit to this Court that that is not an appro­
priate method of approaching the problem at all.

In a long

line of cases in this Court, appointments of executive officers
of the President of the United States have been protected again

IS
and again and again and again.

This Court has determined q\iite

clearly that where the President of the United States exercises
discretionary power committed, to him, that courts either should
not interfere or certainly should be loathe to interfere except
on the weightiest of evidence.
The Mayor of the City of Philadelphia is not the
President of the United States, but he is an executive officer.
Of course, we do have other problems here.

We have problems of

the federal-state relationship, which we have not briefed be­
cause I don't think those are really terribly important here,
but they have to be kept in focus as well.

And we are noitf

talking about a man who was charged by the people who elected
him with exercising his discretion in making the very appoint­
ments that are here under attack.

And we submit very respect­

fully that it would be totally inappropriate, it was totally
inappropriate for the District Court to even consider the matter.
It was inappropriate for the Court of Appeals not only to
consider the matter —
Q

Are you talking about the cases where federal

courts have ordered cities to employ a certain number of police­
men of a certain race?
MR. MATTIONI:
Marshall.

You have forgotten those, haven’t you?
I have not forgotten them, Mr. Justice

Indeed —
Q

on one side.

Well, you said there was a long line of cases
There is a long line on the other side, too, isn’t

19

there ?
MR. MATT I OH I:
Q

I submit, Mr. Justice

And you do admit that the Mayor is bound by the

Constitution, so why try to get too much out of it?
MR. MATTIONI:
Marshall.

Well, except for one thing, Mr. Justice

The cases you are talking about did not really and

truly involve discretion at all.

When you are hiring supposedly

on an objective basis, on a basis where people come in, they
taka a test and either they pass it or fail it, they take a
physical exam, they pass or fail, there is no discretion.
Q

You mean that the Mavor of the City of Philadel-

phis can say I am not going to hire a Negro under any circum­
stances and nothing can be done about it?
MR. MATT I ON I:

Of course, factually that did. not

occur here, Mr. Justice.
Q

Well, why try to go too far?

MR. MATTIONI:

I believe that nevertheless, it is

necessary
Q

Why don't you rely on the fact that you say it

wasn't proved in this case, without saying that, he is exempt
from being looked into?
MR. MATTIONI:
Q

I think, Mr. Justice, that even if —

Do you say that the Mayor cannot be questioned

by a federal court?
MR. MATTIONI:

I believe that in a case of this type

20
he should not be,
Q

Let me get it straight»

The Mayor could announce

openly that he is not considering for the Nominating Panel any
Negroes.
MR. MATTIONI:

If he did he would hardly be reelected

in Philadelphia.
Q

That isn't what I ask you, is it?

MR. MATTIONI:
Q

I know, and I —

Well, how about that?

How about under the 14th

Amendment, would the Mayor be subject to any kind of legal re­
dress?
MR. MATTIONI:

I submit that he would not, Mr. Justice,

and the reason for that is this -Q

Does your case depend on that?

MR. MATTIONI:
Q

Sir?

Does your case depend on that?

MR. MATTIONI:

No, it does not, because I don't be­

lieve that anything like that has been proved.

On the other

hand, I believe that, if nothing else, sir, what must be kept
in mind here is this, that this is the chief executive officer
of the City of Philadelphia and I certainly —
Q

Would you take the same —

MR. MATTIONI:

*— of that fact is necessary which

requires a court to at least step back and say, well, before I
am going to get involved in this case, there has got to be some

21
weighty evidence establishing allegations of actual discrimintion.
Q

Would you take the same position

if

the Mayor

was appointing the School Board members directly and he an­
nounced that he was not considering any Negroes for the School
Board?
MR. MATTIGNI:

I believe I would, Mr. Justice, for

this reason —
Q

And judges and anybody that he had a part in

appointing?
MR. MATT I ON I:
that is simple.

Yes, Mr. Justice, and the reason for

This is still a tripartite form of government

and if we are to have faith in the electors of our country and
in our cities and the whole works, if we a.re going to have any
faith in that system at all, we have got to trust to the good
judgment of the electors that if we have somebody who acts in
that gross a fashion that he will be turned out of office,
post haste.
Q

Are you aware that this Court has ruled against

governors of states?
MR. MATT I. ON I:
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall.

Well, would you say the mayor has got more than

the governor has?
MR. MATTIGNI:

In different context, the mayor is

fully subject to every order of this Court, and this Court has

22
full authority, but I am saying in this kind of context this
Court should not —
Q

Well, what do you mean, this kind of context?

MR. MATT ION I:

In this context, where we are dealing

with a question of executive discretion as opposed to other
types.

If the Mayor, for example, got up and said I am not going

to obey —
Q

Do you consider calling out the National Guard

in the same category?
MR. MATTIONI:

It depends on the circumstances, Mr.

Justice.
Q

Well, in Constantine this Court didn't have any

trouble questioning the governor about that.
MR. MATTIONI:

But again, Mr. Justice, I think it de­

pends on the particular facts in a given case.
Q

Your difference is this is Philadelphia.

MR. MATTIONI:

No, not that, Mr. Justice.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN D. WOLF, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. WOLF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
It is a great honor for any lawyer to appear here.
am pleased that I am here younger than my grandfather, who
didn't appear here until he was 80, and my father hasn't

I

appeared here at all.
I represent the respondents in this case.

In a way,

you see in me a stand-in for the United States Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit, for it is their decision and their opinion
that I am here defending.

My clients therefore come before

this Court not as plaintiffs, which they were below, but as
parties who were

found by the Court of Appeals to have proved

their complaint of a violation of the 14th Amendment,
I make this point at the outset because our argument
today is that the issue before this Court is whether there is
anything in the decision of the Court of Appeals that warrants
this Court's attention,

The essence of our argument is that

there is nothing, that the Court of Appeals dealt thoroughly
and carefully with the unique facts situation, applied its
earlier: decisions and the decisions of this Court in an unex­
ceptional manner and neither developed nor applied a legal
principle that warrants the attention of this Court.
The underlying facts of the case have been stated by
the petitioner.

I would like to add just a couple of points.

First of all, with regard to the purpose of the panel, the de­
fendants be lev; introduced a substantial amount of material
which purported to represent the legislative history of the
composition and the establishment of the Educational Home Rule
Charter.
One element that they did not mention that emerges

24
from these documents is that there was a good deal of discussion
below before the enactment of the charter about the question of
whether the School Board should be elected or whether it should
be appointed.

There was substantial support for the election
The compromise that resulted was this nominating

And particularly in Exhibit D-7-X is a statement by the

Chairman of the panel, a leading industrialist in the city,
that the panel was supposed to be a counterpart of popular
election.

I think that notion is important in considering ex­

actly what the concept of representation means.
Q

You mean the selection of the panel or the func­

tion of the panel after it was selected?
MR. WOLF:

The function of the panel after it was se­

The panel was supposed to play the role of an election

in a democratic system.
Q

Would you say there is quite a difference in the

two?
MR. WOLF:

Oh, yes.

Oh, yes.

Because, as was pointed

out in response to Mr. Justice Blackmun’s question, we are not
attacking the action of the panel.
Q

How many Catholics, for example, are there on

this nominating panel at the time of this litigation?
MR. WOLF:

I don't know exactly.

probably two or three, as best I can tell.

I think there were
We didn't inquire

as to religious affiliation at the trial, so it is hard for me

to tell.

I know that —
Q

Well? don't you think that is of any importance?

MR. WOLF:

Well, I think that in this case we were

trying to establish only that, there was exclusion from consider­
ation of qualified blacks to the panel, and I think that that is
an important notion about our case.

We have never maintained

that blacks are entitled to any particular proportion on the
panel.

We are not — the Court of Appeals did not hold that,

the Court of Appeals did not order proportional representation
as a remedy.
Q

Do you know what proportion of Catholics live in

the City of Philadelphia?
MR. WOLF:

Yes, I know that there are more Catholics

than there are blacks.

I think it is about 40 percent.

How­

ever —
Q

But they have only two members on the panel, did

you say?
MR. WOLF:

There are not very many Catholics who are

in the public schools because there is a substantial archdiocese
school district in Philadelphia.
Q

Well, would that in turn make a difference in

your mind?
MR. WOLF:

No, because, again, we are not talking

about whether everybody is represented.

We are talking about

whether there was an a priori exclusion of blacks from

26

legitimate consideration as members of the panel.
Q

You don’t know whether there was any such exclu­

sionary attitude with respect to other minorities?
MR. WOLF:

No, we did not inquire into that.

And our

clients would not have had standing to raise that argument.

Catholic.

Of

I don’t know whether they are

I didn’t inquire into that, because the issue that

we are concerned with is the exclusion of blacks from consider­
ation.
The first element of proof that we developed was the
composition of the nominating panels.
whites and 3 blacks.
blacks.

In 1965, there were 10

In 1967, there were 11 whites and 2

In 1969, there were 12 xdiites and 1 black.

And in

1971, initially there were 12 whites and 1 black, and subse­
quently one of the whites indicated to the Mayor that he was no
longer the chief executive of an organization and he was re­
placed by a black.
This three, two, one, two pattern, I would suggest,
and was found by the Court of Appeals not to be conclusive
proof of racial discrimination, but was considered by the Court
of Appeals to be evidence that was consistent with an inference
of racial discrimination.
The second thing that we proved that the District
Court found as a fact, and the Court of Appeals accepted as a
fact, was that there were black organizations that met the

27
standards set forth in eight of the nine categories in the
charter document.
We also proved, and the District Court found as a fact,
and the Circuit Court accepted as a fact, that the person who
in fact put together the list of names, the Deputy Mayor, Mr.
Secca, did not know of many of these black organisations.
These are findings of facts 16 and 17 in the District Court's
opinion.
We subsequently proved a pattern of under-representa­
tion of blacks in other appointments by the Mayor.
prove discrimination.

We did not

We did not go into that issue.

What we

did prove, however, was numerical under-representation.

And I

think if you look at the appendix, pages 5 to 23, and you see
— you can see in a very graphic way the — what I would regard
as a litany of exclusion.
Q

You have lists ~™

What pages?

MR. WOLF:

Pages 5 to 23 in the appendix, Mr. Justice

Stewart.
Q

Thank you.

MR. WOLFs

— particularly with regard to the boards,

commissions and authorities of the City of Philadelphia, begin­
ning on page 17.

If you look at the third column, and you see

the number of black persons, on most of these there is either
zero or one.

That is a litany of tokenism, I think.

And al­

28
Q

What does this have to do —- would you relate

that to the panel problem that we are dealing with?

Do you mean

this shows an attitude on the part of the Mayor or someone?
MR. WOLF:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the

principal issue in this case is how do you prove a case of
racial discrimination.

Last term, in McDonnell"Douglas v. Green,

Mr. Justice Powell set out in some detail the order of proof and
the method of proof in a case of racial discrimination.

And one

of the things that he said was that when you have a respondent
or a defendant or an employer coming forward to say that he had
valid reasons not to hire or to have taken the personnel action
in question, that you could look at other employment patterns
by the same person to determine whether his defense was pretectual — is the word that Mr. Justice Powell used.
course, this

And, of

is what the lower federal courts have been doing

ever since Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was en­
acted „
The question of the general employment pattern, al­
though not determinative, is relevant as a matter of a prima

evidence.

And it x^ras for that reason that we introduced that
And in the District Court's opinion, some of that

was the subject of a finding of fact, 17 to 19.

There was a

reference to some of this evidence.
The Court of Appeals did not refer to it, although,
on the other hand, the Court of Appeals did say that it was

29

considering the record as a whole.
The final evidence that we introduced was testimony
by one of the plaintiffs, Wilson Goode? and 1 think that testi­
mony is important not only for the purpose that it was cited, by
the Court of Appeals, but also to give this Court an idea of
what was going on, what the black community was feeling about
this Educational Nominating Panel, and. what their response was
to this particular pattern of appointment.

And in that context,

what happened in 1969 does become important and does reflect
on 1971.

And, as the Court of Appeals said, it is consistent

with an inference of discrimination.

Again, it does not prove

that in 1971 the Mayor discriminated, but it is evidence —
Q

Is that a correct standard of review for a

Court of Appeals, reviewing findings of the District Court?
MR. WOLF:

find that

Yes, because the —

Well, can the Court of Appeals reverse if they

MR. WOLF:

Well, in this context, they can because

the issue is not a factual inference to foe drawn but a legal
inference to be drawn.

And the legal inference is was there

sufficient evidence in the record to establish a prima facie
case.

If there was sufficient evidence to establish a prima

facie case, then the burden shifts.

This also was made clear

in McDonnell-Douglas v. Green last term.

And that is why the

30
question of the Court of Appeals was the right question.

And I

think that they were correct in concluding that a prima facie
case of racial discrimination was mads out, because a prima
facie case is not conclusive proof.
When I was an Assistant District Attorney in Philadel­
phia, a prima — in trying criminal cases, a prima facie case
was merely the establishment on the one side of the elements
necessary to make out an offense.

It was not the determination

beyond a reasonable doubt or beyond any kind of doubt.

It was

simply the establishment on the record of elements with which,
if unrebutted, would be sufficient to make out a prima facie
case.

That is a question of law, and that is the question that

the Court of Appeals addressed.

And it is the question on which

it reversed the District Court.
Mr. Goode's testimony discussed the efforts of the
black community to convince the Mayor to appoint additional
blacks to the Nominating Panel and to the .School Board.

He

recounted that in 1369 the efforts of the black community had
had an effect on the then existing Nominating Panel, and that
the Nominating Panel had submitted fcvro cut of three — in sub­
mitting three names for a vacancy that came out, submitted two
black names.

And he also testified that the Mayor became

angry at this and made a public statement that he was not going
to appoint any additional blacks to the panel — to the School
Board.

And I think it is important that this testimony is

not testify from the newspaper article.

But Mr. Goods did
In fact, the newspaper

article itself stated that it was based on statements that the
Mayor made on television and, although Mr. Goode did not
testify to this, and perhaps this was an omission of mine, he
did see it on television.

He was not cross-examined by the

City Solicitor to determine whether his information was hear­
say, and the record only shows that he testified that he knew
that the Mayor made this statement.
The questioning of Mr. Zecca in this regard brought
forth only that Mr. Zecca did not recall the incident.
was on page 66 and again on page 93 of the appendix.
was asked, "Do you recall?"

That
Mr. Zecca

And he said, "No, I don't recall."

Well, those I think are the principal facts.

With

respect to the facts in defense that the city developed, I
think it is important to note that Mr. Farmer, who was the
Chairman of the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations, did
testify that there were 41 percent blacks in the Philadelphia
City Government.

I had always assumed at trial, beginning at

trial and until I received the reply brief from the city, that
the Mayor did have something to do with the personnel practices
of the city, but according to the reply brief apparently the

32
personnel director is independent of the Mayor,
at the charter, I found that that is true.

And in looking

So I ant not sure

that the 41 percent city employment does prove anything about
the Mayor.
On the other hand, the testimony of Mr. Farmer showed
that he — neither he. nor anyone on his staff knew that there
was a drastic reduction in black employment in the Philadelphia
Police Department, which was shown in another action in Federal
District Court, brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
alleging employment discrimination in the police department.
That is on page 110 of the appendix.
And Mr. Farmer, in his capacity as the chief city
officer responsible for discrimination in employment in the
city, simply didn't know that this had occurred in the
Philadelphia Police Department.
Well, to go back to what the Court of Appeals did:
The Court of Appeals reviewed these facts and stated with regard
to them that they were consistent with a finding of racial dis­
crimination, and then applied the standard developed in the
jury cases of how do you prove racial discrimination.

And they

said the way you prove racial discrimination is first of all
you get a — you find an under-representation of blacks,
second of all, /ou find an opportunity for discrimination, and
then that is enough to make out a prima facie case.

And if

there is no rebuttal or at least no rebuttal of any legal

weight, then you conclude that the case has been made out.
Now, again, 1 think that what we are always concerned
with is what. is the record in the case.
that was before the court.

What is the evidence

Now, it may be that if Mayor Tate

had testified, he could have satisfied everybody.

He could

have satisfied the District Court, the Court of Appeals, this
Court.

He might even have been, able to satisfy the plaintiffs

in the case that he did not discriminate.

But he didn't

testify.

And the Court of Appeals made this point in its

opinion.

It said the Mayor didn’t testify, and so we don’t

really know.

But what we do know is what the evidence is on

the record.
Q

Do you think Mayor Risco ought, to have a chance

to testify before an injunction is entered against him?
MR. WOLF:

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

And I think the

Cburt of Appeals also made that clear.
Q

But the injunction was directed to issue against

him.
MR. WOLF:

Well, I think the Court of Appeals — the

Court of Appeals began its discussion of remedy by saying it is
for the District Court to determine the precise nature of the
relief.

It did, however, suggest that prospective relief is

appropriate.
Q

You. say then that without further proceedings,

an injunction should not issue against Mayor Riszo?

MR. WOLF:

Yes, that would be my position.

But, on

the other hand, I think as —
Q

That isn’t the Court of Appeals position, is it?

MR. WOLF:

Well, the Court of Appeals I think was

speaking to the proposition stated by Mr. Justice White most
recently in Alexander v. Louisiana, quoting Louisiana v. United
States, with regard to the obligation of a federal court not
only to declare racial discrimination when it sees it, but also
to grant effective relief to see that its effects are eliminated
and that it does not recur in the future.
that will be before the District Court.

That is the question
And I cannot tell you

right now whether I think an injunction should issue against
Mayor Rizao, or if, if it should, what its terras should be.
Q

I thought the Court of Appeals rather emphasised

the fact that the Deputy Mayor remained the
MR. WOLF:

same person.

Well, the Court of Appeals said, in Foot­

note 21, on page 49 of the petition for certiorari, which is
the point that I was just making, nevertheless on this record
Mr. Zecca continues as a Deputy Mayor.

And since this court

finds that plaintiffs have shown on this record discrimination
in regard to the present panel, the federal courts must assure
that the appointment of the 1973 panel is free from taint.
And I think that in this whole discussion of remedy,
which appears in really only one paragraph, on pages 48 and 49
of the petition, that there is an emphasis on the fact that

35
they are dealing with a record.

For example, the last sentence

in Footnote 21 says, also we repeat that the defendant Mayor
never testified and the court passes no personal judgment on
him,
Q

Well, you suggest in any event we read the Court

of Appeals opinion as though it did not direct the District
Court to issue an injunction against the Mayor?
MR, WOLF:

I think that’s true.

I would, as a prac­

tical matter, I would take that position -Q

And that if the Mayor did absolutely nothing

on remand and injunction should not issue until the other side
notices some further proceedings?
MR. WOLF:

I am not sure that I — the Mayor has al­

ready appointed a 1973 panel.
Q

Yes, but the Mayor ■— but with respect to whether

an injunction should issue against him or not, the burden is not
on the Mayor to go in and have some injunction vacated?
MR. WOLF:

Mo, no.

Wo, and that is one of the prob­

There is no order of the District Court

There is a suggestion of some of the considerations

that the District Court should keep in mind when it comes to
entering an order.
Q

So I take it then you really — it sounds to me

as though you would really be satisfied if whatever part of
this judgment was declaratory was affirmed?

36
MR. WOLF:
Q

Well, I think that I would not read —

With respect to the Mayor.

MR. WOLF:

I think that the appropriate disposition of

this case, as far as I am concerned, is to remand it to the
District Court for further proceedings to determine the precise
nature of the relief to which plaintiffs are entitled.
Q

Do you think there is still the case of contro­

versy there?
MR. WOLF:
Q

Between Mayor Rizzo and the plaintiffs?

MR. WOLF:
controversy.

Oh, yes.

Oh, yes, there is definitely a case in

Of course, as cases go up on appeal, the underlying

facts change, and the city government went on.
Q

Yes.

MR. WOLF:

We initially sought to enjoin any action

by the panel, but we were denied that irelief and the panel did
act.

It did submit names to the Mayor, the Mayor did appoint

members to the School Board for a six-year term, and they are
presently sitting.
Q

I suppose that if this suit were brought, had

been brought for the first time now, after a new Mayor had
been elected, and all you attack was the activities of Mayor
Tate and introduced no more evidence and purportedly introduced
no more evidence than you introduced in this case, you might
have some trouble about having a case of controversy.

37
MR. WOLFi

No, because there are people sitting on

the School Board as a result of the activities of the 1371
panel.

And like in Turner v. Fouche, on remand, the remedy is

to remove them.
Q

Well, that isn't what you — you aren’t suggest­

ing that the School Board members be removed, are you, in this
case?
MR. WOLF:

That is a possible remedy on remand, and

the Court of Appeals again said in its amendment to the opinion,
which was filed in February, at our request, on remand the
District Court — this is on page 53 of the petition for
certiorari — the District Court should consider the continuing
effectiveness of appointments to the board made after August
1971 on the basis of all the facts which may be developed at
the hearing on such remand.
Now, it is entirely possible that the District Court,
in its exercise of equitable discretion, could conclude that it
Will not remove these members of the School Board, for one
reason or another.
to do so.

On the other hand, it clearly is open to it

And by analogy to Turner v. Fouche, where the order

entered by the District Court on remand was in fact to remove
the School Board members who had been appointed as a result of
the unconstitutional process, that would be a possible remedy
her®.

And 1 think that as far as my clients are concerned, if

we are successful here, and if the case is remanded to the

38
District Court for the entry of an order, we will conduct some
discovery and we will take testimony and then we will have to
decide as a matter of the public interest what remedy we desire
to seek.
Q

Mr. Wolf, supposing that after the 1976 presiden­

tial election, whoever is then President-Elect is asked whether
he plans to appoint a Catholic to the Cabinet, and his response
is no, I don’t, I didn't get any support from Catholics in this
election and I really have no intention of considering them for
a Cabinet post.

Would you think then that a representative

group of Catholics could go into some federal court and under
equal protection component of the due process clause of the
'

'

5

Fifth Amendment and get some sort of an injunction at least
. /:
J
rogiiirimg him to consider Catholics?
MR. WOLF:
questions there.

Well, I think that you are asking two

One is whether they would have a right to

attempt to prove that Catholics were excluded a priori from
Consideration, and, second, whether they would succeed.
Q

By hypothesis, I give you the fact that the

President-Elect himself states that they are excluded.
MR. WOLF:

Well, I suspect that with regard to a

Presidential appointment to the Cabinet that the President
would introduce or at least there would be argument regarding
the confidential personal nature of the relationship between
the President and a Cabinet member, regarding the political

39

nature of the appointment, that is that the appointee is to
carry out the President's policy.,

And that becomes relevant

as a matter of rebutting the prima facie case.

If you are

asking me whether a President or any other appointing authority,
having made that statement, offers no defense or no explanation,
whether that would constitute a violation of either the Fifth or
Fourteenth Amendments equal protection clause, I would say yes.
And I would say that relief could be granted.
But I think, as 1 said, that the issue in this case
and in that case would be not the right and not the power of
the federal court but whether the plaintiffs made out their
case.

And that goes to the simple legal question of what con-

stitutes a prima facie case of racial discrimination and what
constitutes an adequate rebuttal to a prima facie case of
racial discrimination.
Q

Well, would it be different if the Mayor of

Philadelphia announced that he just wasn’t considering any
members of a particular political party for a position on the
School Board?
MR. WOLF:

No, I don’t think the equal protection

clause protects members of a political party as opposed to
another.

After all, the 14th Amendment says — talks about

race.
Q

It talks about equal protection.

But you may

discriminate against somebody, the Mayor may discriminate

40
against somebody on the grounds of his political beliefs»
MR. WOLF:

I think that is right, but I don’t really

think that that was — I don't think that is what was intended
under the —
Q

It is not only under the equal protection area

but the First Amendment area.
MR. WOLF:
Q

That's right.

Justice White’s question.

And yet you argue or

at least concede the validity of that sort of discrimination,
do you?
MR. WOLF:

Well, I think that, first of all, it is

really not involved in this case.
Q

Well, it may be, in analysing this case.

It may

well be.
MR. WOLF:

I thin]’, that the equal protection clause

would apply, and I think again in that situation, what you
have is an overwhelming defense, overwhelming explanation, that
is we are in a political situation, we are making political
appointments, and this person is not of the same political party
as I am and therefore that is all the reason in the world not
to appoint him.
Q

What if the political party were the lily white

party?
MR. WOLF:

Well, I think that you begin to get into

Mr. Justice Powell's word of "pretextual."

Q

No, no.

nothing pretectual, nothing undercover

about it.
MR. WOLF:
Q

Well, what I mean is that you —

The political party would be a.n all-white party.

MR. WOLF:

What I mean is that you begin to get to

the question of whether saying that he is not going to appoint
any members of that political party is a pretext for not ap­
pointing any blacks.

And if you find that is a pretext, then

I think that it is subject to the 14th Amendment or the Fifth
Amendment, depending on which it is.

0.

Well, to pursue that line for a moment, even

though it may take us quite far, suppose the Mayor, having —
a mayor, having been elected, has an analysis made of the precints and wards from which his support came and he announced
that since he only had 10 percent support in the Negro voting
districts of the city, he was going to appoint

only 10 percent

Negroes, not exceeding 10 percent to the panel, the nominating
panel.

Now, that is a political decision, isn't it?
MR. WOLF:

That's right.

that would not be valid.

That's right.

I think that

I think it would not be valid because

it is an a priori limitation that is exclusion from consider­
ation of members of a particular race.
Q

Well, how do you distinguish it from the response

you gave to Mr. Justice Stewart, that it is a decision baed
on political support?

Says he, I am going to have people

appointed within my appointing power who have supported me.
MR. WOLFs

Well, I think that is a tough case.

think it is a lot tougher than

the one we have here.

I

And I

think that —
Q

Is there just something about the difficulty of

having judges make these philosophical analyses?
MR. WOLF5

Oh, there is no question that determining

whether a case has been made out is always a difficult one.
And the thing that you have to look at is — under the law, is
first of all whether the plaintiffs have presented evidence
which, if unrebutted, would establish a case of discrimination,
and, second, whether the defendant has brought forth evidence
in mitigation.
The real problem with this case, frankly, I think, is
that the District Court said on a couple of occasions, remember,
if the plaintiffs bring forth the prima facie case, you have
got to rebut it.

And it was only after the conclusion of

plaintiffs' case, as a matter of fact, the following day, that
defendants indicated that they did want to put on some testi­
mony, and we did it about a week later.

But I think that here

there really wasn't the kind of political evidence that the
two hypothetical situations you have given me would suggest.
1 think the Mayor could have come in and said I am only gong

to put on this panel people who supported me in elections.

But

he didn't say that, and I think if he had we might have had a

43
more difficult case.
Q

Mr. Wolf, what worries roe is, up until just a

few minutes ago, I understood you were not after the School
Board members at all.
MR. WOLF:

And now you are.

MR. WOLF:

No, no.

MR. TtfOLF:

Well, I don't think so, because the question

of relief is always a matter —
Q

Well, do you want us to rule blindly on this?

MR. WOLF:
Q

that when yon went back, yon more than likely would ask that

That8s right, and the reason is because

the process by which they were appointed violated the Constitu­
tion.

And if the process violates the Constitution, then under

Louisiana v. United States —

We have to ignore what, you said that they aren’t

They are.
MR. WOLF;

Well, when I said they were not involved,

what I said was there is no attack on the racial composition of
the School Board.
Q

There is no attack on the —

Well, why do you want them taken off?

MR. WOLF;

Because the procedure, the process whereby

they were appointed was constitutionally invalid.
Q

Even if they were Negroes, they have to go?

MR. WOLF:

Even if they were Negroes, because the

process was unconstitutional.

That is why we have constantly

tried to make clear that we are not in any way attacking the
actions of the panel.

We are only attacking the process whereby

the panel was appointed, and we maintain that that was done in
a racially discriminatory manner.
Q

Mr. Wolf, let me ask you one final question,

that you may or may not be in a position to respond to.

I

noticed in Footnote 21 that you referred to on page 49, the
Court of Appeals has the statement, in about the center, "This

*2

D

Court finds that plaintiffs have shown on this record" — and
so forth.

I notice in several other places in its opinion, it

uses the term "finds*' or "found."

Judges, when they use that

term ordinarily mean they are finding a fact.

Do you consider

that an appropriate function for the Court of Appeals?
MR. WOLF:

I don't think they were finding a fact.

X think that they were relying on the findings of fact in the
court below with the one exception of Mr. Goode's testimony.
Q

You think they were just using this term inad­

vertently and inartfully?
MR. WOLF:
law, X think.

Yes, because you also find conclusions of

Or I guess you make conclusions of law, don't

you, as opposed to findings of fact.
Q

Well, when judges use those terms, I think they

use them more carefully normally.
MR. WOLF:

Well, X think though that the question of

whether a particular set of evidence makes out a case of racial
discrimination is a conclusion of lav/, and that kind of conclu­
sion of law is appropriate for a court of appeals to draw.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you, gentlemen.

Thank you, Mr. Wolf.

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 11:07 o'clock a.m., the case was
submitted.3
