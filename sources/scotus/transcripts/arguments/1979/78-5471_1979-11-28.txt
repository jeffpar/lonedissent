P RO CE E DINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume the

arguments in Whalen v. the United States and at this point
Mr. Prey, I want to inform you and Mr. Wasserstrom that we

will enlarge your time two minutes and since with our aid
by questions Mr. Wasaersfcrom used all his time, we will
allow you two minutes for rebuttal„
Mr. Frey.
FURTHER ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J„ FREY, ESQ,. ,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice,, and may it pleat;®

the Court:
Preliminarily I would like to point out in response
to a question that Mr. Justice Whits asked my colleague
yesterday, the Petitioner did argue in his opening br:.ef in
the Court of Appeals that the sentence violated the double
.i
;<

jeopardy clause.
QUESTION:

On his sentences.

MR. FREY:

On his sentences, yes.

So I think he

did preserve the constitutional ~~
QUESTION:

Yes, he preserved it.

The Court of Appeals

never addressed it, really.
MR. FREYs

It didn't address it in constitutional

terms, no,
QUESTION;

Mr. Frey, to get back perhaps to as you

34

say fundamentalsr my understanding of the reading of the
double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment is 'that nor
shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice
put in jeopardy of life or limb.
Was the Petitioner here tried separately1twice?
\

ME» FBEY:

No.

But there is of course language scattered about in
opinions of this Court going back as far as Ex Part® Large
which suggests fch&t the double jeopardy clause msiy have ecmbearing on punishment as -sell as on successive trials.
QUESTION:

It squarely held that the double jeopardy

clause permitted dual punishment for one offensef didn’t it?
MR, FREY;

That it permitted it, or prohibited it?

QUESTION:

Prohibit it ~
/

MR, FREY:

Well, the Ex Part® Lange

QUESTIONS , — for a single offense. "

^

MR. FREY:

Ex Parte Lange in © —

QUESTION:

It didnct have to hold that* but. it did

hold that.
MR. FREY:

Yes, I think it reefed its holding that to

imposs a sentence that the legislature had not authorised on
the defendant violates the double jeopardy clause.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Frey, why don’t you suggest that Lange

is just another brand of two trials.
sentencing proceeding©

Lange involved two

35

MR. FREY:

Wall —

QUESTION:

And there isn’t any case that X knew of

that speaks about double punishment that didn't involve two
different proceedings.
MR* FREY:

Wall, let met say — wall, there are of

course Blockburgar line of statutory cases which did not
involve two separate proceedings.
QUESTION:

They didn’t involve the punishment.

MR. PREY:

Wall# Blockburgar involved punishment and

not successive trials.
I think the point that I am making which — and I
agree with you

but this case involves a single sentencing

proceeding following a single trial.

It doum not involve

multiple trial such as North Carolina v. Pearce involved.
Nor does it involve bringing the defendant back after he has
been once sentenced for ra~sentencing.
And our contention here is that the double jeopardy
clause has — imposes no restrictions on the sentencing court.
It eatab1ishas no teat that must be satisfied in imposing
sentence in a single sentencing proceeding following a ©Angle
trial.
\

NoWf we have said in our brief that the double jeopardy
clause restricts the sentencing court to imposing a sentence
that has been authorised by the legislature.

And we say that

because there is language in this Court's opinions, going back

36

to Ex Part© Lange* that suggest that»

But X think that is an

essentially trivial proposition which I would not have
ascribed to the double jeopardy clause myself* but to the due
process clause.
QUESTION:

Well* the Court applied that doctrine in

North Carolina v. Pearce* didn't they?
MR* PREY:

Yes* but of course was a case involving two

trials and two sentences.
QUESTIONs

No, it vias also a case involving a subsidiary

issue in that case* wasn't it*

It involved precisely the Ess

Parte Langa doctrine* as I remember.

I haven’t re-read it*

and I didn't write it.
MR, PREY:

I am not sure what you are referring to*

but the question was whether the defendant once having bsen
sentenced to a particular sentence for a particular crime
could have in place of that sentence following a re-trial*
a higher sentence imposed.

And the Court indeed said th at the

doable jeopardy clause didn't bar that.

QUESTION:

They barred part of it though.

MR. PREY:

It barred not giving the credit —

QUESTION:

They had to give a credit.

MR. PREY:

That is correct.

las Farter Lang® —

MR, PREY;

Wail, in Ex Parte haage what happened wm

a sentence was imposed that th® legislature had not authorised;
• and not only that; but the judge when he went to correct, it
in Ex Part® Lang© and ha said, "Well, I will eliminate the
fine and I will just leave you with the jail sentence,® the
fine had already been paid and there was no way for returning
ito

So ©van though th© judge said he was only sentencing him

to prison in Ex Parts Lange, in fact he had to pay a fine and
g© to prison,
QUESTIONS

la that in th® opinion, that they couldn’t

get it bad:?
MR, FREYi

l believe it is.

That is my recollection

the last time 1 looked at it,
QUESTION;

Was Es? Parte Lange a case; from a State

court or from this Court?
MR® FREY; . No, it was a Federal case,
QUESTION:

That could well be under the supervisory

power of this Court, that you just don’t impose sentences in
excess of those authorised by law,
MR, FREY:

Well, it could well be,

need to resort to the supervisory power.

I don’t thin!: you
If seems to ms that

in a Federal case if a sentence is imposed that Congress has
not authorised, then all you do is apply the sentencing

38

provision of the statute to ravers® th® sentence,
QUESTION:

You don* t -need a constitutional docket,

MR, FREY:

But

X

would have to say -chat in a *»» if

<

you had a Stats case in which the defendant i®’-which the
sentence was authorized by statute was five years Imprisonment
: and the trial judge said, 59We 11, this is such a heinous vorsica
of this crime that 1 am going t© give you ten years imprison**
want,® X have two cosnaents about what would happen when this
• case got up here.
The first is that nobody would really suggest ‘that that
was a double jeopardy ease,
tod th® second is that 1 think everybody would agree

*

X certainly would — that that violates the due process
clause,

Now, in North Carolina v, Pearce it w-»o

not a Federal case but a State ease,
MR, FREYs

That is true.

MR, PREY:

Well, I am not *—

39

QUESTION:

That is not just casual verbiage»

That is?

the ho Ming of the court*
MR» PREY:

Well, 1 have not sought to Maintain the

position that the doubl© jeopardy clause has nothing to do with
sentencing,,

The position I am maintaining is that the double

jeopardy clause has nothing to do with & single sentencing
proceeding following a single trial.
New, there is a petition before you that we filed in
a case called United States v, DiFranceseo which involves the
right of the Government to appeal a sentence.

Now* that

involves an issue under the double jeopardy clause
see that.

*»- X can

And I suppose if the judge sentenced sosebody to

three years imprisonment for an offense where he could have
sentenced him to 10, then after the three years were up he
called him back in and said*

13X have changed say mind, X think

you deserve more,” that X think would involve a double jeopardy
question.
But this does not involve a double jeopardy question.
I simply don't see where it cones from.
QUESTION*

Mr, Frey* can I address your theory with

a thought that has been running through my mind.
You remember a year or two ago

X think you argued

the case, it cam© from the Seventh Circuit ***> there were two
gun control statutes.

One provided I think a three-year

sentence and the other a one-year sentence which overlapped.

40

And the Seventh Circuit had held that sines it was basically
the sane crime yon can only impose the leaker sentence*

to<

1 think yon persuaded mi to reverse and say« well the ©com­
ment can choose between the 'few© and we can impose — go under
the section that allowed 'th® longer sentence*
1 take it your view now would be that they could apply
both, even though, they are. precisely th© a mm offense they could
impose 40 years*
MR® FREYs

X didn*t argue that: case.,

QUESTIONs

Of course th® Government didn't have to in

that ease®
Is -that correct?

tod similarlys if in th® confusiori

of legislative process they had enacted the same provisions
14 different times throughout fcha Criminal Code they can
impose **•*- cumulat® all 14 sentences even though they are the
same offense*
ME, FREY:

I don't -fellink that —

QUESTION:

There would be no constitutional problem,

that is what you said*
MR* FREY:

1 don't think that that need trouble the

Court because that kind of case is always dealt with as
a matter of legislative intent*

We are not suggesting that

the intent of the legislature should bs ignored by the Court
and in your hypothetical^ f and I think it is certainly true
in title IV and title VII of the —

-I understood in your opening that you

suggested -that this statute and its history shows that Congress

■■■-■

MR® FREY:

Well,

~m

do argue that, although of course

we have also argued that that is not a matter that this Court
ought t© reach»

But our constitutional argument, Mr* Chief

Justice, does not depend directly on the fact that ia this
case Congress did authorise®

Our constitutional argument is

that you simply don't have a double jeopardy inquiry in this
kind of case»

All you have is your conventional inquiry into

42

legislative intent which can be aided by the Blockhurger test
or anything else.

I near; I just — I haws

not attempted to deny that the double jeopardy- clause -applies
4.< *

"

in 'the situation in North Carol!n-a-V. Pearce-»

But any point

here is that this is a very different situation»

We are .

not talking about punishments being imposed twice on the
defendant except in a very hypothetical sense, which is
derived from — well, let us look at Brown v. Ohio for a
moment»
Because the Court said in Brown,» anci 1 think it #as

14

clearly in passing, that -fee Blcckburger test is the test for
determining the propriety of multiple punishments under the
double jeopardy clause.
Now, I think you would have to agree -that Brown did
not. involve any multiple punishment issue except © derivativa
of a successive prosecution issue,

Fmd elsewhere in the same

©pinion the Court says that the rol© of the double jeopardy
clause is not to restrict th© legislature but to make sure
the courts and prosecutors don't exceed their legislative
authorisa-ti.cn.
Now* we have a case her® where if you accept th©
statutory construction of th© District of Columbia Court of
Appeals it is clear that the sentence imposed on this
Petitioner did not exceed fch© legislative authorisation.
And what Petitioner wants to do is to say even though
Congress meant to allow this man to receive this sentence
for the crimes that he committed, the double jeopardy clause
somehow and in some mysterious way by virtue of the .
Bloekburgsr test and by virtue of the fact• that a lesser
included offense is the same offense* bars this,
i

Now, I cannot see that it is appropriate to take a
dictum

and let 'me say also that the statement in Brown

about the Blockburger test being the test for ~~ constitutional
test for multiple punishments sprung full blown like Palice
Athena from nowhere,

There is nothing in the prior decisions

45

of this Court: that ever suggested that the Blockburgar test
was & cons fcl tuti on a 1 test for suitip la punishments in a
context such as we have in this case.

Indeedt in Xannelli

which was X think two terms before Brown, the Court expressly
said that the Blockbtsrger test is the test for ascertaining
legislative intente

Indeed* it said that about Wharton*®

rule in a case where the substantive offense necessarily
involved conspiracy, the Court said 'that is & test for
ascertaining legislative intent®
How, I certainly submit to the Court that the dictum
in Brown ie at this point subject to reexamination and ought
not to ntand in the way of adopting a rule that is consonant
with fcho purposes ©f the double jeopardy clause and doesn't
apply in an area where it doesn't really fit®

And what is

being done with the Blockhurger test if Petitioner has his
way, is to pervert the test from its original purpose
which was to foiled the legislative intent Into a test which
is being used to thwart the intent off the legislature®
QUESTIONs

But you wouldn't *— you sue© not arguing

against using the Blocskburger test as to when there can be
separate: trials®
MB, PBHY:

We are not opposed t© using that.

W© think

it is appropriate but I might note -that as Harris v. Oklahoma
indicates and, indeed, as in re Hellson indicates you
may go beyond th© Blockhurger taste

This is a very murky

what happens with felony murder and tha underlying felony,
because felony murder carries a sentence of life imprisonment
with a minimum of 20 years«

We are not talking about a lot

■ that is at stake in the particular context of the felony murder
statute.
It is of course important that the double jeopardy
clause b® understood in a consistent and rational way,

ted

it is vary important to us as applied to the firearms statutes,»

Thst is Section 924(c)»

Mow, there you hams a statute which

is exactly parallel t© tha felony murder statute.

You must

have a Federal felony and the use or the unlawful carrying of
a firearm in the course ©£ that felony.

Se whatever the

Federal felony is, highjacking, bank robbery — although
there are some problems with bank robbery — assault,
homicide, you must prove that felony in order to prove the
violation of 924(c).

QUESTION:

But his original conviction was for

burglary, rape and felony murder? is that correct?

MR* PREY:

Two counts of felony raurier.

And the

i

burglary was reversed.not because of any failure of evidence,
but because of the Court of Appeals view of

parte bar,

in permissible amendment of the Indictment.
But as the case now stands, he stands convicted onlj7
of rap® and of felony murder based on the rcpe.

That is all

we have here.
Our position is that there is nothing in the Constitution
that prohibits if Congress wants to say 15 years for the raps
and 20 years additional for the felony murder.

There is

absolutely nothing in the Constitution.

Harris v, Oklahoma makes no mention of fche
Harris vQ Oklahoma cites only successive

double jeopardy clause addresses something <as insignificant
as how man;’/ statutes Congress chooses to put something in*

Mid let me make another point»

To go bad to Justice

Stewart*s reference to Ex. Parte Lange and the bar in multiple
punishmentsf multiple punishments for a single crime are an
every day "occurrence in the Federal courts*

The defendant

can be .Imprisoned* he can be fined* ha can suffer a forfeiture,
he can be sentenced to a term of special parole*

How, a fin©

followed by a term ©f special parol© for exactly the same
offense

sounds like two punishments for ©ns offense*

But

if it is imposed following a single trial a.«d a single
sentencing proceeding, nobody I think would suggest that:
there is anything the least bit wrong with it*..'- tod I simply
cannot bring myself to believe that the double jeopardy
clause, to cow back to 924(c) , means that Congress eanr.ofc'

say if you us® a firearm in the commission, of a ' Federal
felt-ay you are to receive a consecutive

sentence of two

years - 'imprisonment, or whatever it may be, beyond the sentence
imposed for the underlying felony.
Congress has done,

That is exactly what;

tod if Petitioner is right, the double

jeopardy clause prohibits that.

I sissply te*t think it.

You are only raising a question that

goes to the intention of the legislature»

You may'say that

you are not satisfied that the legislature has sufficiently
clearly expressed its intention*
arguing here is:

But the point that I am

May the legislature — may it constitutionally

provide for puaiehaent

Nell, let me turn to that point»

While it is ordinarily true that this Court will not

■ decide a constitutional question if it can settle the case on
statutory grounds# that is exactly the situation that existed
in pemell v„ Southall Realty, exactly*.
Pern-all va Southall Realty»

There was a statute

The statute provided under the

■ construction of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
for the elimination of a jury trial in certain kinds of
eviction actions or something*

And the issue came up here

as a Seventh Assendiaant is.-rte and the Court in an opinion by
Mr* Justice Marshall recognised that it night be able to avoid
■! reaching the constitutional issue by construing the statute
-differently»

But it said in the most unequivocal terns that

a decision ©£ the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
construing a statute of local application will not be reviewed

by this Court on statutory grounds', even to avoid reaching a
constitutional issue»

Rather# that court will be treated as

the' highest court ©£ a State®
QUESTIONS

IF&snsfe there a companion case to Perns 11

which had been written by Justice Stevens in the Seventh
Circuit which it said qaits unequivocally that even though

56

Congress had denied the right to a jury trial, th® right, to
jury trial was constitutional and therefore notwithstanding
the right to

the congressional intent would have to fail

when the constitutional provision was involved?
MR* FREYj

Well, I ara not sure, although I have no

doubt that if the Constitution required a jury trial Congress
couldn't do sway with it, if that is the question»
QUESTION:

Actually we held that because of the

constitutional issue, we construed the statute to avoid the
constitutional issue»
MR* FREY a

But in 'this case 1 think it is clear that

you can't, and I am sorry 1 didn't have time, to espial a why*
QUESTION:

Your first argument is that we should accept

the construction of the statute put upon it by the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals*
MR» FREYi

That is correct»

QUESTIONs

Just as we would the construction put on a

State statute by a State court»
MR. PREY:

And after all, there are 50 other States

that this case could as easily have come from and you would
have had no choice to reconstrue the legislative intent*
it is hardly a very damaging precedent.
QUESTION:

And that construction you say doesn't

violate any constitutional right.

Absolutely

I think th© Court has to decide the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SILAS J. WAS SERSTHOM , ESQ.,
.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WASSERSTROMz

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
To begin with, it is argued that if Congress did not
intend consecutive punishment here, did not authorise such
punishment, then whan the lower court makes a mistake of that
sort it is making a mistake which results in the denial of
the defendant’s constitutional rights.

And therefore this

Court should, and must, review that legislative

that

determination of legislative intent, it is not like other
kinds of errors in ©onstrtdng legislative intent.
' On th© constitutional issue itself though, it is our
■3oeifcio.il — and w@ submit .it is borne out by this Court's
decision in the companion css© of Pearoe v. North Carolina,
the case of Rica v« Alabama, in that case the defendant pled
guilty and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.

Two and a

58

half years into his term he successfully challenged his
convictions in a petition for quorum novus relief in the
State courts.

He ’then was tried on the same charges that he

had pled to and he was convicted.

judge imposed a sentence

and ordered that credit not be given for time served.

He

imposed a 25-year sentence and ordered -that no credit for the
2-1/2 years b© given for time served'.
Now* this Court pointed out that -the judge could have
given a 27-1/2-year sentence with credit for time served.
That would have been within 1*® statutory maximum permitted
for th® offenses ©£ which he was convicted.

Neverthelesse

this Court vacated and ordered that credit be given — it
didn’t vacate it* but ordered that credit be given for time
served because by failing to give credit for time served*
the defendant was twice punished for the same offense* ©van
though he could have bean punished to the same extent with
credit for time served.
That decision was a unanimous decision of that
Court.
QUESTION*

It was a second sentencing proceeding.

MB. WASSEBSTBOMs

Certainly when a defendant moves

to have his sentence set aside, he waives any kind of double
jeopardy claim he might have with respect to the fact that a
second sentencing proceeding occurs®
have turned on the fact that —

So that case could not

sentence»

This has nothing ;.o do with a larger.*

It may well be as this Court held in Pearce that

a longer sentence after appeal is illegal because ©f clue
process considerations»

Pearce is not a double jeopardy casej

it is a companion casehowever.

Rice v. Alabama is a double

jeopardy case, it relies on Ess Parte Lange»

And the Court

made it clear that the double jeopardy clause forbid the
State from giving him a sentence which did not give him credit
for time served even though it could have given an equivalent
sentence with credit for time served.
