MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-]522, Andrus v. Utah.
Mr. Buscemi, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER BUSCEMI, ESQ.,
ON BEHAL* OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BUSCEMI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is on here on writ of certiorari to the.
Unite! States Cout of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and
presents a question concerning the discretion to be exercise!
by the Secretary of the Interior in reviewing state applica­
tions for public lands to replace lost school lands and the

!I

roots o£ this controversy go back a long wav.
.

As new states were created out of federal territories;
throughout the 19th Centurv, Congress granted the states one or
more enumerated sections in each tox^nsh Lp for school purposes.
When Ohio joined the union in 1803, it became the first state
to receive such a grant.

Throughout the first half of the loth

Century, most states received one section oer townshio, section
16, and

;hen beginning with California

In 1853 the general rule

was two sections of township, and Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico
were the only states that upon joining the union received four
school sections in every township throughout the state.
Now, the problem presented in this case arises from

4
the fact that the designated numbered sections specifically
granted to the states by Congress were sometimes unavailable
for any one of a variety of reasons.

Sometimes a given sec­

tion was homesteaded or it had been placed in a national park
or a national forest, or perhaps an Indian reservation, and
most obviously, sometimes a township was fractional and'the
enumerated section simplv didn't exist.
So recognizing that possibilitv, Congress provided
for it and said that states that receive school lands could,
if any of the specificallv enumerated sections were unavailable,
select other unappropriated public lands as replacements for
the lost sections.

The selections authorized bv Congress are

called indemnity selections or in lieu selections.
Now, this case concerns a series of 194 such selections filed bv the State of Utah between 1965 and 1971.

The
!

selections -i

QUESTION:

How raanv sections in a full township, 32? j

MR. BUSCEUI:
QUESTION:

36.

3 6.

MR. BUSCEMI:

That's righto

The Utah selections
■

cover about 194, 157,000 acres in the northeast portion of
the state.
QUESTION:

Why has it taken the secretarv so long to

pass on any of these selections?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnauist, there are

5

a variety of reasons which we've set out in some detail in the
brief.

In addition to the controversy over the grosslv dis-

parate value policy before the Court today, there has also been
a delay associated with the actual anpraisal in estimating the
value of the base lands and the selective lands.
QUESTION;

I 3an see where there could be a delay of

.

several years, and I can see why there could be delays on
particular sections, but to just have a complete blockage for
a period of more than tan vears strikes me as nuite unusual.
MR. BUSCEMI:

j

IJell, I mean, for one thing this case

has been in litigation now for five vears, so that takes it
back to 1974.

Now, that's about nine vaars from the date of

the beginning selection.

But there was an intervening event,

the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act in 1969
which raised the question about the applicability of the en­
vironmental impact statement requirement to a state indemnity
selection.
Now, that question is not before the Court toda'?.

To

some extant the resolution of the question ma^ deoend on the
outcome of this case.

If the secretary has the discretion that
J

he contends he has, then his decision to aoprove or disapprove
selection may involve a major federal action that would require
an environmental impact statement.

But that all is not here

now because of the way the District Court and the Court of
Appeals resolved this litigation.

So —

6

QUESTION:

There has also been a change in policy

.

in the Department of the Interior, hasn’t there?

A change in

position as to the secretary's right?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Not to the best of mv knowledge.
-

QUESTION:

I thought there --

MR. BUSCEMI:

■— the district value policy is still

the policy of the Department of the Interior.
QUESTION:

But I thought it had not been the — the

department did not follow that policy at an earlier date?
MR. BUSCEMI:
chronology here.

Well, vou have to understand the

I mean, in 1953, Congress for the first time

provided that states could select mineral land as a replacement
for lost school land.

That provoked a ferment within the

department and the question arose as to what, if anv, discretion
the secretary had when a state selected lands that were much
more valuable than the lands that they lost.
Now, in 1963, the Attorney General rendered an opin­
ion at the request of the Department of the Interior stating
that he believed the secretary had discretion, for which he now
argues, and then in 1965 the secretary did support proposed
legislation that would have added the equal value concept to
.

governing indemnity selection statutes.

So it has beexx the

department's policy for at least 14 years now, perhaps 15 or 16.!
QUESTION:

But he didn’t get the legislation?

MR. BUSCEMI:

No, he did not.

QUESTION:

But then, how long has he been following

formally the equal value concept?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, the first statement signed by

the Secretary of the Interior is dated January 16, I believe,
1967, but in answer to Mr. Justice Rehnouist's question, when
I said he had been following it since '63, I was basing it on
the fact that there was this series of communications between
Representative Aspinall, the Chairman of the House Committee on ,
•

-

!

the Interior, and the Attorney General and the Secretary of the!
Interior, which discussed the general question of his discretion
under Section 7 of the Taylor Grazing Act and the applicability;
or the availability of that discretion as a means of imnorting
this evaluation policy into the process of ruling on indemnity
selections.
Now, as we pointed out in the brief, approximatelv
10,000 of the 157,000 acres at issue in this case are the sub­
ject of two prototype oil shale leases right now, but those
aren't really involved in any direct sense in this case because
Utah has agreed that it did not object to the leasing program,
and it will regardless of the disposition in this case, it will
honor the leases in the event that it prevails.
Now, Utah filed this suit in March 1974, challenging
the propriety of the Secretary's grossly disparate valxie policy,
and that policy appears in the memo signed by Secretary Udall
to which I just referred in the appendix at pages 43 to 45.

8

Briefly stated, the Secretary's policy is that in
most cases he'll refuse." to approve state selections of public
lands that are substantially more valuable than the lost school
sections they are intended to replace.

Now, the policv doesn't

come into play at all unless the estimated value of the selected
lands is more than $100 per acre.

If it is, and if the selec­

ted lands have an estimated value per acre higher than the lost
sections, the secretary will routinely approve otherwise accept­
able selections only where the difference in value is $100 per
acre or 25 percent of the value of the base, the lost lands,
whichever is greater.
So for example, if the lost lands are worth $100 an
acre, the Secretary would routinely approve an otherwise ac­
ceptable selection inhere the value was up to $200 an acre.

On

the other hand, if the lost lands were particularly valuable,
say $1,000 an acre, the secretary would then routinely approve
anything up to $1,250.
Now, Utah contends that the Secretary simplv lacks
the authority to apply this grossly disparate value standard to
state indemnity selections.

In the state's view, the only

legitima ;e criteria for evaluating a proposed selection are
found in the statute generally authorizing such selections.
Now, that statute traces its origin to two laws enacted in 1826
and 1359.

The laws were revised and consolidated in Sections

2275 and 2276 of the revised statutes in 1874, and then amended

9

again in 1891 and again in 1958-

They are now in 43 USC 851

and 852.
The Secretary's position is that in addition to those
provisions, another statute is highly relevant to his action on
state applications.

That statute is the Taylor Grazing Act of

1934, and in particular Section 1 of the act and Section 7, as
amended two years later in 1936.
QUESTION:

Now, as you understand your brother:s
I

position, is that position that the Taylor Grazing Act, particularly Section 7 thereof, is wholly inapplicable?
\

MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes.

At least that's part of his posi- ]

tion.
QUESTION:

That's what I thought.

QUESTION:

Mr. Buscemi, you referred to Secretary

Udall's approval of the memorandum on pages 43 through 45 of
the appendix.

Do you think there is any inconsistency between

that memorandum and the opinion of the solicitor of the department on page 41 of the appendix?
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Yes.

The department has, then, changed policy?

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, the date of the solicitor's

opinion is September 1962.

Now, that was a date earlier than

any I discussed before in ans\*/er to vour Question.

It may have

been thathere were some lower officials in the Interior De­
partment who thought in 1962 that the equal value concept was

10

simply inapplicable.

I don’t deny that.

We discussed that

memorandum briefly in Note 26 of our brief on page 61.
If that ever did represent the policy of the secre­
tary and the department as a whole, it no longer does.

And to

that extent there has been a change.
QUESTION:

And to that extent the present policy does

not stand on quite the same footing as if it had been contem­
poraneous and consistently followed under the traditional rules
we've applied in giving validity to administrative interpreta­
tion of congressional acts?
MR. BUSCEMI:
tent.

Well, that is right to a limited ex­

You have to talk about it in two parts, I think.

The

secretary's assertion of discretion under the Taylor Grazing
Act has been a consistent policy since 1935, and that is the
main and the broad issue that is before the Court today.

The

subsidiary question, and the one on which there may have been
this change, is the question of the validitv of the grossly
disparate value policy as an exercise of that discretion.
QUESTION:

With respect to mineral lands?

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, the grossly disparate value

policy as it is stated in that memorandum applies to all lands,
and there is no limitation to mineral lands.

Now, it is of

course —
QUESTION:

So to that extant the policy, one way or

another, would predate the statute permitting mineral lands to

11

be selected?
MR. BUSCEMI:

I am sorry, I don't think I understand

your question.
QUESTION:

Well, the first time the disparate value

issue might have come up, wouldn’t be when the mineral lands
were approved as open to selection?
MR. BUSCEMI:

It’s older than that.

Well, the possibility for it is older

than that, certainly, but I think the point is that the likeli-

i

hood that such a problem would arise was substantially increased
in 1958 with the congressional decision to allow states to
select mineral lands.
Now, whether in the period between 1936 and 1958
the secretary approved a lot of selections —
QUESTION:

Well, are you saying that if there ever

was a policy the other way, that’s contrary to what you're now
pushing, it was only between '58 and
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

'62?

Well --

Only then, because that’s when they first

began hassling about it?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, Mr. Justice White, my point is

that between '36 and 1958, I don’t know what every approval of
indemnity selection involved.
QUESTION:

There may have been soma —-

Well, was there a policy during that time

that you can point to, or not?
MR. BUSCEMI:

I cannot point bo any statement of a

12

grossly disparate value policy between 636 —
QUESTION:

Well, the solicitor in 1962 stated a posi­

tion that you don't now agree with?
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

That's right.

Well, had that been a policy of the de­

partment?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Not as far as I know.

I think that

the solicitor's opinion in 1962 reflected the general —
QUESTION:

That’s the first time that anybody in the

department had really said anything about it?
MR. BUSCEMI:

I think that that's basically true.

I

don't think that there had ever been an active consideration of
this equal value question —
QUESTION:

So there wasn't any policy in the depart­

ment prior to then?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, to the extent that the department

had to act on individual state selections, they obviously had
a method of determining whether to approve or disapprove.
QUESTION:

You think there was a practice which re­

flected such a policy, even though the policy itself was in­
art icu la ;ed?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, I simply don't know, because in

the indemnity selection rulings, I don't think that there is
any discussion of the —
QUESTION:

You can't tell.

13

MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION?

— values.

That's right.

Maybe I misunderstood.

I thought you —

oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were saying that there was no occasion
for a policy to be formulated until 1S58 when mineral lands
could first be used in the in lieu of selection.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, that certainly provided the major

impetus, but I can't deny that there may have been some in­
demnity selection before 1958 that for timber or other reasons
involved lands that were substantially more valuable than the
:

i

lost land.
QUESTION:

Should be the fertility of the land; I

mean desert land against very fex'tile farmland.
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

It was never formalized, whatever the policy

was, if there was one.
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Precisely.

\

That's right.

Do you know the length of Congressman

Aspinall's tenure as chairman of this House Interior Subcommit­
tee?
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

No, I don't.

Well, you shouldn't be blamed for net

remembering that long.
I am sure it began well before your birth.
(Laughter.)
.

14

!

I

MR. BUSCEMI:

Now, the critical issue in this case, I

think, as we have seen, is the relationship between the indem­
nity selection statute and the Taylor Grazing Act.

I would

like to demonstrate why we think the District Court and Court
of Appeals ware wrong about that, but I would like to just make
a few quick preliminary points to eliminate some extraneous
possible questions and issues in the case.
First of all, the Utah Enabling Act is not directly
involved here any more because in 1902 Congress provided that
the indemnity selections should taka place under the General
Indemnity Selection Statute, notwithstanding the — anything to
the contrary that may have been in the enabling act.

Except

of coursj for the grant of the original school sections, the
Utah Enabling Act really isn't a problem here.
Nov/, secondly I'd like to say that under the original
!

indemnity selection statutes in 1926 and 1859, there is very

'i

little question from the language of the statute that the
secretary, originally the Secretary of the Treasury and then thfl
I
Secretary of the Interior, had complete control over the indem-j
nity selection process.

I am not saying that those old sta­

tutes are dispositive now. A lot has happened since then.

But

I just think that it is important to keep that in mind in in­
terpreting the subsequent congressional action.
Now, third, there —
QUESTION:

When you say ha had complete control, you

15
i
don’t mean that he could simply flatly refuse to allow a new­
ly admitted state any sections?
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Not at all.

Well --

MR. BUSCEMI:

What I mean to say, Mr. Justice Rehnquis;t,

is that the 1826 statute said in I think so many words, the
:

Secretary of the Treasury, because there was no

Secretary of

the Interior then, "shall select the lands for the state."
Now, the third point that I want to make as a pre­
liminary matter is that when Utah joined the Union in 1896,
the selection statute on which the stats now relies provided
that no mineral lands could be selected.

For 62 years after

Utah joined the Union they simply had no right tc select any
mineral lands and indeed, as a result of this Court's decision
in Sweet in 1918, even the original grants in place that may
have contained mineral lands did not go to the state —- that
may have contained minerals did not g.o to the state if they did.
Because che Court ruled in Sweet that Congress simply did not
.

intend to give the states mineral lands even if they fall with-

j

in the numbered sections.
So the state's discussion of the bilateral compact
between che Federal Government and the state, as if that's some
sort of binding contract that gives the state a right to mineral
lands, is simply inaccurate on the historical records.

There

was no right to mineral lands when Utah joined the Union.

16

Now, finally, I just want to repeat once more that
the primary question in this case is the secretary’s discretion.
i
l

Even if for some reason the mostly disparate value policy is
deemed to be an abuse of that discretion, which we think it.’*;
not, the major issue of importance here is that the secretary
does have some discretion under Section 7 of the Taylor Grazing
Act to manage the public lands that have been placed in grazing
#

districts, and that we think is the most important point.
QUESTION:

You think the secretary is under any duty

*

to act within any time limit or reasonable time on a state’s
request for lieu lands or state selection of lieu lands, assuming that he does have discretion?

1
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, I think it’s certainly true that

the secretary should act as expeditiously as possible.

.

|

I think '

that in che past few years there have been a number of develop­
ments that have prevented him from acting quickly.

In the past,

I think if you look at some of the older indemnity selection
decisions by the Interior Department that were cited, you'll see
that the selections were approved more quickly, but there have

j

been some special problems in the recent years.
Now, as the indemnity selection statute stood after
the 1891 amendment, it authorized the states to select lands
from any unappropriated surveyed public lands not mineral in
character within the state where the loss of school sections had
■occurred. Now, it didn’t say anything about the Secretary of

t

17

the Interior's role, but it certainly didn't purport to change
that role in any way.
i

Now, it is not entirely clear from looking back at the
old Interior Department decisions what the prevailing assump­
tion was about the extent of the secretary’s control over
selections around the turn of the century, but the Court set­
tled that matter in Payne v. New Mexico and Wyoming v. United
States.

Those cases held that once that indemnity selection

had been filed, the secretary could not refuse to approve it
I

because he had returned the base lands to the public domain,
i

and thereby given than back to the stata, or because in the in- i
terrain, vhile the selection was pending, the President decided
he wants! to withdraw the selected lands.

Payne and Wyoming

said that the secretary could not do that.
Now, it is not necessary, we think, to reconsider
Payne or Wyoming.

We can accept then as correctly decided, and

we don’t have to argue about whether there was an error there
because the Court did not consider the meaning of the 1826 and
1859 predecessors to the 1891 statute, not to mention •—
QUESTION:

Don’t you have to accept them?

MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes.

Well, we could argue that they
-

were incorrectly decided and they should be, the Court should
not follow them now, but we don't need to because of the inter­
vening act, or the passage of the Taylor Grazing Act in Section

7.

18

QUESTION:

Can you point to anything on the, in the

debates or in the committee reports, which looks unfavorably on
Pavne-Wyoming ?

i
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

You mean to say the debates in the —-

Anything in the legislative history.

Anything.
MR. BUSCEMI:

No.

But I do want to point out, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that
it is clear from the legislative history of the Taylor Grazing
Act that the act was designed to create a new system for con­
trolling the public lands and to insure the orderly improvement

j

and development of those lands under the supervision of the

S
Secretary of the Interior.
.

QUESTION:

But its basic thrust was to open up more
I

public lands, wasn’t it?
MR. BUSCEMI:
Relinquish.

To private development?
I don’t believe that’s so, Mr. Justice

I don’t see any evidence of that in the Taylor

Grazing Act.

The point was that Congress was concerned that

this land not be let alone out there without any person looking
after it and watching out for what kind of entries were made on
it.

So it authorized the secretary in his discretion to

establish grazing districts and thereby to withdraw the federal
land included, placed in those grazing districts, from all
forms of entry or settlement.
QUESTION:

But the grazing districts themselves would

j

19

then be subject to Taylor Grazing Act leases to private indi­
viduals?
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Well —

I mean, you don't have a grazing district,

and the idea wasn't the government was going to graze cattle on
those grazing districts.
MR. BUSCEMI:

No, that's not what I mean to say.

All

I mean to say is the secretary, the placement of the land in
the grazing district was designed to enable the secretary to
supervise and watch over the usage of that land, and to allow
entries of a private nature or the state indemnity selection
statutes or state indemnity selection applications or anything
else, only when he deemed it proper.
Now, Section 1 of the act makes it absolutely plain
\

in the language of the statute, without any reference to the
legislative history, that that's what Congress had in mind.
Congress said that the creation of the districts withdrew all
the affected lands from all forms of entry or settlement.
Nox?, Utah contends that state indemnity selection is
not a form of entry or settlement.

But that can’t be, because

we know from this Court's decisions in Wyoming v. United States
and the later case, United States v. Wyoming, that a Pickett
Act withdrawal by the president, which withdraws public lands
from, quote, "settlement, location, sals or entry," can defeat
a state indemnity selection.

20

The Pickett Act says nothing about indemnity selec­
tion, nor do most executive orders withdrawing public lands
under the authority of the act.

But nonetheless, the Court has

recognised that a state indemnity selection, indeed even the
original grant which was involved in United States v. Wyoming,
the 1947 case, is defeated if the Pickett Act withdrawal oc­
curs before the selection or, in the case of the original sec­
tion, before it has been surveyed.
QUESTION:

Did the 1947 case distinguish between the

various four nouns, settlement, location, entry, or —
MR. BUSCEMI:

Not that I remember, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist.
Now, Utah complains that we haven't cited any legis­
lative history of the kind that Mr. Justice Blackmun suggests,
that placement of public lands in a gracing district specific­
ally renders than unavailable for school selection.

But in.

light of the structure and the purpose of the act and its word­
ing , it should be incumbent on the stats to demonstrate that a
particular form of entry was deliberately exempted fron the
xd.thdrawal effected by the creation of a grazing district.
It is hardly surprising that when Congress said "all
forms of entry or settlement," it didn’t stop to specify each
kind of entry that was covered.

They are all covered.

Now, moreover —
QUESTION:

What’s wrong with the House report you

21

cite on page 55 and 56 of your brief?

Is that not in point,

or not?
|

MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Well —

j

You certainly think that there is congres- -

sional affirmation of the secretary's role in selecting lieu
lands?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes, I agree, Mr. Justice White, but I

understood Mr. Justice Blackmun’s question to concern the
legislative history of the '34 act at the time it was adopted.
The 1958 report to which you refer on page 55 comas considerably
fchereaftar, although we definitely argue and think that it re­
flects congressional approval of the secretary's discretion.
QUESTION:

Well, this was in connection with amend-

meats.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes, that's true.

Now, this brings us to Section 7 of the act, which I
just want to address briefly before reserving the remainder of
my time.
Now, we say that when Congress saw what it had done
in 1934 and realized that all of the land placed in a grazing
district had been withdrawn from all forms of entry or settle­
ment, when it looked at that in combination with the executive
order of November 1934, withdrawing all public lands in 12 of
the Western states from settlement, location, sale or entry
under the Pickett Act, it realized that this public land was

22

simply unavaliable.
Now, th© Senate hearings on the amendment of Section 7
in 1936 make this absolutely plain that this is what they ware
concerned about.

They knew that they had simply precluded all

forms of entry, and that’s why they amended Section 7.

And in

the amendment — before, in the original statute, Section 7 had
allowed the secretary to ©pen grazing district lands to home­
steading.

So in the amendment, Congress simply expanded the

secretary's discretion and said, ‘'Now you can open them to any
form of entry if you find that the particular land is proper
for acquisition in satisfaction of an outstanding lieu right or
land grant or any on© of a number of other things that are
listed in Section 7,”
Now, Section 7 as it stands today makes it absolutely
clear.

It says that the grazing district lands should not b©

subject to disposition, settlement, or occupation until classi­
fied and open to entry.

And it authorizes the secretary to make

those classifications.
Now, w© have canvassed the legislative history in our
brief and I don’t want fc© repeat it here, but it demonstrates
that this sort of entry is precisely what Congress had in. mind,
and the 1958 amendment didn’t do anything to change that.

It

simply said that mineral lands are now available on the same
terms that other lands would have been available, and that meant
that Congress had to classify thsm for entry, excuse mo, that

23

the secretary had to classify them under Section 7.
Unless the Court has further, questions;, 1 would like
to reserve the remainder of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. DEWSNUP, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF UTAH
MR. DEWSNUP;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Court;
On® or two responses I would like to make briefly to
some of the questions that have been raised, before I move into
my argument.
I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked whether Wyoming
v„ United States in .1921 or United States v. Wyoming in 1947
had made any distinction between the type of reservation with­
drawal.

The Court didn’t, but th© Court had before it with­

drawal for federal purpose in putting it in federal forest
reserve for us© as a federal purpose.

While the government

consistently states it is absolutely clear that any withdrawal
will be sufficient to defeat a state indemnity selection, that
is not true.

Thera is not one word anywhere in any decided,

case that we’re aware of or any implication or suggestion that
lands net withdrawn for federal use, that is land simplv with­
drawn for classification \/ithout any determination as to what
uses they would be put to, because the 1930 withdrawal order,
Executive Order 1532, I.believe it was, in 1930, withdrew every

24

inch of the land in seven or eight Western states, including all
of Utahv for classification.
I am sorry:

That was the. oil shale withdrawal.

But

in 1935 withdrew every acre for classification and since 1935,
that executive order has continuously been in affect, and to­
day every inch of the State of Utah is in a Taylor grazing
district.

My house is in a Taylor grazing district.

The Utah

State Capitol is in a Taylor grazing district.
So that about one-half of Utah is unreserved public
domain for no particular public use, whereas the forests, the
parks, and areas reserved for public use, we admit we can't
select that.
QUESTION:

Well, you describe Utah as though it were

like some other states I can think of.
MR. DEWSNUP:

I think it is, but I think Utah had a

particular problem in that Utah was settled 50 years before
statehood was granted because of polygamy and other problems
that delayed it.

The practical effect of this is that the

homestead laws and other laws caused the farms to be established
where water was available, forests were reserved.

The only

things that were left by 1896 basically were the wastelands
where water wasn't available, the Alpine forests weren't there,
and that meant we not only didn't get our original grants in
place, these more desirable areas, but the lands from which we
could select were likewise limited to the wastelands.

25

Now, it happens that we believe that there are oil
shale deposits in part of the barren desert out in Uwinah
County and we've made filings on those.
But I simply want to repeat that despite the govern­
ment’s claims, and maybe Mr. Buscemi will come up with some­
thing he hasn't done yet, there is no indication that federal
lands, the unreserved public domain withdrawn simply for classi­
fication will defear school indemnity selection.
Then, in response to a question or comment from Fir.
Justice White about congressional acquiescence, my comment is,
to the extent there was congressional acquiescence in the
secretary's classification procedure, it was a perfunctory
thing.

There wasn't a word of debate during the amendments of

43 USC 352.
QUESTION:

Do ycu think the House Interior Committee

knew what the secretary was doinq, for <2xample?
MR. DEWSNUP:

I doubt it.

within the secretary's report.

There was no amplification

Roger Ernst from Arizona wrote

one of t.iose reports.
QUESTION:

You don't think the staff and the chairman

of the committee, for example, knew how this was being ad­
minister ad?
MR. DEWSNUP:

With respect to school indemnity selec­

tion, there is not any kind of explanation or amplification at
all, and if they did, there is no indication, not one word of

26

debate or discussion that Congress focused on that issue, that
was not an issue of the legislation.
classification was not controversial.

But more importantly,
Despite what’s been said,

it was always on acre for acre basis, and there has not to this
day — and we repeatedly for the last five years have asked
Interior — has there ever been an instance where there’s been
an equal value criterion applied to school indemnity selection,
and there has not.
In fact, on February 14, 1974, when Secretary Morton
wrote to Governor Ramp and he said , "One of my main problems
in that I haven’t acted on these indemnity selections is that
I don’t know whether or not I can use the equal value criterion,
but that was a policy established by Secretary Udall in 1967,
and when I get ar ound to doing something about vcur school in­
demnity selection, I intend to apply that policy."
QUESTION:

Whan you say "that policy," the equal

value policy?
MR. DEWSNUP:

The equal value policy.

That’s why I

think its highly misleading for this 40 years of continuous
administrative practice.

It was relatively nonccntroversial

because whatever classification might have consisted of, it
was essentially applying the criteria of Section 852 of Title
43, which is the applicable public land for school indemnity
selections.
So if there has been any congressional acquiescence

27

that's relevant, it is acquiescence in a classification process
which utilized the criteria of Section 852«,
Now, I would like to begin my argument.

Very briefly,

I would like to mention that the 11 Western states, Continental
Western states, are all before the Court.

Utah, of course, the

primary party? the State of Idaho filed a separate amicus brief;
the State of California with eight other states also filed an
amicus brief jointly.

All 11 states present a uniform position

before this Court in accordance with the position of th© State
of Utah and the unanimous decision of th© Court of Appeals of
the 10th Circuit! below.
Secondly, I would like to mention very briefly that
the solicitor of the Interior of the United States gives too
short a shrift of th© purpose of the school indemnity land
grants.

In the Western states, and the State of Utah is still

67 percent owned by the United States, the proparty tax is a
basic tax for supporting fundamental governmental purposes and
the most important, dollar-wise, is support of the public
schools.
The State of Virginia or Maryland as original statas
could tax virtually 100 percent of the property.
Utah couldn't.

The State of

It had to forego as a condition of statehood

any taxation of federal or Indian lands.

As a quid pro quo

created by bilateral compact, the United States agreed to grant
to the State of Utah for tha support of th© common schools

28

certain lands in consideration for the state not taxing federal
and Indian lands.
And so this is one of the most fundamental government­
al purposes.

The state is to derive from this school land

grant revenues to compensate it for the tax it otherwise would
have received from the general property taxing power over fed­
eral and Indian lands.

And that's why in Section 6 of the Utah

Enabling Act, Congress says, "Whenever you don’t get these ori­
ginal sections in place"

and the reason Utah and Arizona and

New Mexico got for section is because they’re desert states and
so much of the area was marginal or wasteland ■— "other lands
equivalent thereto to fch© original sections in place could ba
selected/1 and said,

"Other lands appointed thereto are hereby

appropriated for the state to select in such manner as the state
legislature may direct, subject to the approval of the secre­
tary o"

And as the Wyoming and Mew Mexico cases point®! out,

that approval is a ministerial function to see whether or not
th© statutory criteria that Congress set up in Section 3 52 of
Title 43 have been satisfied.
appropriate base lands?

That is, have you identified

If you’re selecting mineral lands, the

base land is mineral in character.

If you're selecting lands on

a producing oil and gas field, were your lands in place similar­
ly producing oil and gas.
In that connection, I'd like to observe that with
respect to this equal value, Congress has made the determination

29

as to what is fair and what is not fair „

Congress in about two

pages that we have cited, Section 8 52, has carefully laid out
the balances of what it considered to be a fair compensation in
school indemnity selections, and there is no way that Utah,
speaking of fairness, it's unlikely that Utah will ever get a
true cross section of land within its borders as was originally
envisioned.
Nor will this case have any great substantial adverse
impact in any way upon federal lands of the Secretary of the
Interior's management; if all seven states still having indemnity
selection rights left exercise those rights, a totality com­
bined acreage of all seven states would amount to less than one
percent of the federal land in Utah alone.
And even on the oil shale resources wa pointed out,
the land that Utah's applied for her© are only a fraction of
one pereant of that resource, so it's not as though Utah would
in any event obtain some lion's share or even significant part
of that resource.
With respect to the equal value concept further, I
have said that the Secretary of Interior has never to our
knowledge, or he has not disclosed at any time despite requests,
that this equal value concept has ever been applied in any
particular case or instance.
I mention briefly th© Utah Enabling Act said other
lands of equal acreage, Title 43 USC Section 351, making the

30

general appropriation of lands for indemnity selection says
that lards of equal acreage are hereby appropriated»

Congress

made it very clear that the discussion of equal cicreage is not
equal value, and it was not until 1967 this doctrine or policy
of Secretary UdaXl finally was formulated and even then, it
was very strange that it was never really promulgated.
wasn’t published anywhere.

It

It wasn’t in the Federal Register.

It tv&sn’fc sent out by way of instruction sheets, and in 1976
the Interior Board of Land Appeals decided Nav; Mexico decision
and some reference to that Udall memorandum had been made and
the Interior Board of Land Appeals said that this so-called,
memorandum ws've naver heard of and wa haven’t even been able
to find it.
So it wasn't very wall known in the Interior Depart­
ment itself.

We've cited that case in our brief.

Now, I think that New Mexico and Wyoming decisions
which can® along in 1921 are so clear and so dispositive, I’m
sure the Court through reading of the brief and reading of the
10th Circuit Court opinion below are just absolutely on point,
and the government concedes that but claims that somehow this
Taylor Gracing Act enacted in 1934 and invented in 1936, with­
out saying one word about it, emasculated this whole school
indemnity land grant, this sols and bilateral compact, as this
Court has said and the 10th Circuit Court has said, between
two sovereigns to permit the public land states to carry on

31

fundamental and essential governmental purposes.
I would like briefly to run through,, simply by
idenfcification, a few of the arguments that we made in a brief
that the government has criticized as being too long.
think any parts of the brief are unnecessary.

We don't

We think there

is just so much evidence in support of our position that it
took 100 pages to say it.
First of all, Section 1 of fch© Taylor Grazing Act
contains an express exemption that th® act will not apply to
any part of any grant to any state.

The government’s response

to that is that was intended to apply only to the original
grants in place of the school land grant, Section 216 32 and
36 in th© case of Utah, but not to indemnity selection.
There is no legislative history to justify any such
intent to make such a limited exception, and besides th® land
grant, it scans to me, is a unity, it’s indivisible.

If Utah

is granted Section 2, arid that's a land grant to the state,
and we don't get a part of that grant as our' indemnity selec­
tion, we get Section 2 or w© get to select land and that
satisfies our Section 2 school land grant.
is a fanciful argument.

And I think that

In fact, I admire th© way the govern­

ment at this juncture, and their theory has evolve! during
the five years we've been, litigating, they have now sutured
together a rather plausible superficial case of what might
have happened in th© past.

32

But I submit that the arguments are constructed after
the fact and ignore the basic nature and purpose and importance
of the school land grants.
Second, when the Taylor Grazing Act was amended in
1936, the discussion in the Senate Committee Report clearly
said that we're doing this to facilitate private entries, classi­
fication for disposition of the public domain through private
entries.

This is entirely consistent with the exemption in

Section 1 that any part of any grant to any state is not in­
cluded, and the amendment in 1936 was identified as applying
to private entries,
QUESTIONs

Ordinarily you don't call a Taylor Grazing

Act leasa an entry, do you?
MR, DEWSNUP%
QUESTIONi

A Taylor Grazing lease an entry?

Yes,

MR, DEWSNUP:

No,

I think that would not be an entry.'

A typical entry I think would be under homestead laws, under
mining laws, those kinds of — I am not sure I fully appreciate
the question.

The administration of th© act and th© granting

of grazing allotments, they are tantamount to leasing, if you're
talking about the grazing uses as certain allotments are made to
certain users within a particular grazing district to graze so
many cattle during so many periods of tine.
I would not refer to that as an entry, because these
entries ware to be compared with the.alternative entry use.

If

33

someone mada an entry and that entry was more valuable for
the purpose of the an'try than for grazing nativa forage, then
the secretary would dispose, or was authorized to dispose of
the land for purposes of the entry, to classify that for dis­
position .
I would like to mention at this juncture that the
Taylor Grazing Act sets forth specific criteria for a particu­
lar type of entry.

If you make a homestead entry, you’re

entitled to complete the entry, if you can proves that the
agricultural use of th© land is more valuable than the graz­
ing.

If someone wants to make a private trad® of land, even

if there’s to be a state trad© as distinguish©! from indemnity
selection —- Ism going to elaborate on that a little bit more
in just a second ■— then there are elaborate criteria.
But if school indemnity selection were to bs in­
cluded, they’re exempt from the act, there is no indication
they’re included, there’s not on© word about it.

This would

ha the oily kind of classification under the Taylor Grazing
Act where the secretary would be free of any guiding criteria.
Th© most fundamental important use of the land, th©
exercise by the state ©f that indemnity right, the secretary
would be totally free.

We’ve said that there would ba no

judicial review because that would be under th© secretary view
agency discretion committed by law to th© agoncy, which under
Overton Park is not subject to judicial review.

34

The solicitor responded in a reply brief

to

just got

last night, delivered to our hotel — we’re thankful for that saying yes, there would, but he cites no authority for that
proposition.

I think that's highly unlikely.

Very briefly, the cases that have been decided that
come anywhere near having relevance are discussed beginning on
page 93 of our brief, and I think the significant 'thing is, in
every case they have distinguished the Wyoming and Payne cases,
because none of the cases decided have dealt with school in­
demnity selections, as having been decided under other statutes
There is not the siigbest word or suggestion in any of these
cases that Payne and Wyoming are no longer good law, and while
these are lower court decisions, none of those cases ware de­
cided by this Court, none of the cases subsequent to Payne and
Wyoming.
I would like to make a brief comparison to exchanges.

Now, an exchange of course is whan the state simply wants to
make a trade.

It lias a right of selection when it doesn't

gat its original grants in place.

But if it does get its

original grants in place, it can still ask the Federal Govern­
ment to trado, and those tradas are covered under Section 8 of
the Taylor Grazing Act, and they are discussed separately, and
there the secretary is given authority to approve an exchange
either on the basis of equal acreage or equal value.
Now, it doesn’t make much sensa for just land trades

35

to be exempt from classification, and under the secretary’s own
regulation, exchanges are clearly exempt.

He does not classify

under Section 7, and yet to draw a school indemnity selection
in by the heels and claim that they have to be classified and
under the guise of the classification, the secretary can reject
the selection for whatever reason he might think is in the pub­
lic interest.
And another interesting thing about exchanges is,
Section 8 (c) of the Taylor erasing Act makes it mandatory.

The

secretary is told when the state selects land for an exchange,
th© secretary will proceed forthwith and accomplish tha ex­
change.

The school indemnity selection which th® secratary

again tries to drag in by tha haals in the classification
process, he says he not only doesn’t have to approve the ex­
change, he doesn’t have to proceed with all reasonable dispatch.
The whole thing just doesn’t make any sense that exchanges
somehow would receive such careful treatment and consideration
by Congress while indemnity selection wouldn’t.
And the reason for that, of course, is indemnity
selections were exempt, exchanges were not, because they’re
not a part of a grant to any state.

Thay ar© simply a request

by a state for a trade, and even there, th© 1935 Act which re­
ceived a pocket veto, and th© legislative history of which is
discussed at soma length, because th® government brought it
up — th© only legislative history they could find is in an

36

aci; that didn't become lav; — we responded to it that states
were really upset because under the 1934 Act., while there was

«*

an exemption for any grant to any state, it did not appear to
exempt exchanges or trades that the state wanted to make, so in
1936 Congress did that.

It made exchanges exempt, told the

secretary to get off his tail and accomplish the exchanges,
and let him do it either on the basis of equal acreage or equal
value.
Briefly, we've said that tha statute should he con­
strued to avoid doubt as to its constitutionality because of
the implication of this bilateral compact.

In the brief w©

received last night the secretary said that's not so because at
the time of the bilateral compact, the state was not entitled
to mineral lands, but it has been brought out in this discus­
sion, this Uda.ll memorandum policy is not limited to mineral
lands.

What he is trying to do on the basis of equal value

would apply whether or not the selections war® mineral or nonmineral lands.

So that doesn't make much sens©.

And another significant and telling point, and I think
almost as conclusive as the othear arguments, is under the Taylor
Taylor Grazing Act the secretary has no authority at all fee
classify th© mineral astata for disposition.
to hear an argument to that.

And I would like

We can mat© tha argument? w©

never get a response to it.
That's limited exclusively to surface uses, and the

37

minarai estate, except for private entries under the hard rook
minerals, the hydrocarbons, were reserved from any kind of
disposition in 1920 under the Mineral Leasing Act and are subject to mineral leases.
QUESTION:

As a matter of fact, it took an act of

Congress in the 19605s in order to prevent mineral usage from
being allowed on areas in some of the Western states where
hones had been built, did it not?
MS. DEWSNUP:

Yes.

And the executive order of 1930

which withdrew oil shale from leasing, that’s the only wciy it
could be disposed of, in 1958 was lifted and Congress specific
ally said that the states can now select lands containing oil
shale, and the United States lias contrived a fantastically
sophisticated argument here that I don’t have a lot of time to
identify, but the gist of it would be that Congress was so
perceptive that it decided to say that the states could select
oil shale lands but Congress really didn’t mean that because
in removing, eliminating the effect of the 1930 executive
order, Congress without saying so intended to leave two other
barriers, and one was the withdrawal of Executive Order 6910
in 1934, which withdrew all the lands for classification, but
then that was amended so that any land within a grazing dis­
trict, so long as it remained within a grazing district, would
be exempt from that withdrawal, so the only hurdle we have
left is Section 7 requiring classification, and so the

38

secretary first can decide whether or not he classifies, and
if he doesn’t classify for school indemnity selection, the
express mandate of Congress is cat off at the pass.
Congress didn't say a word about it, but the govern­
ment has sutured together this theory that Congress really
intended exactly the reverse of what it said.
A final point we make, well, a final point I'm go­
ing to comment on for this brief, as the Court said in Wyoming
v. United States, ordinarily public land grant statutes are
strictly construed in favor of the government.

You don’t

grant anything, you don't approve anything that Congress
didn't specifically declare, but in the case of school in­
demnity selection grants, the reverso is true.

This is such

a fundamental trust program created by bilateral compact that
the intent is to do everything you can to give reasonable
subsham a and support and effect to the creation of the pub­
lic trust, and therefore you construe the grant liberally,
construi; any question, statutes questions of grants liberally
for the purpose of fulfilling the public trust.
Now, as I say, last night 1 got a 12-page brief.

We

filed cur hundred page brief, which we hope is not too repeti­
tious, about two months ago.

QUESTION;

it was filed here in the Court on December

MR. DEWSNUP:

Oh, fine? I appreciate that for

clarification and identification.
But the thing that pleases me is that the government
hasn't laid a glove on us, in my judgment, in the seven points
that they have picked and choose to respond to in the 60-day
interim since we filed our brief.
I have about four minutes left.
light here.

I have a timekeeper here.

I have a whit®

I want to mention these

seven points that are shots at what are presumed to be the
vulnerable points cf our position.
Humber on®, the government says that Utah argues
that the exemption of Section 1 of the Taylor Grazing Act ap­
plies only to grants in place, and I have already — but there
is no discussion at all as to how you can sever or distinguish
the indemnity right to replace the lost land with indemnity
selecticn, nor is there any legislative history purporting to
male© that distinction.
Number two, tha government criticises Utah for dis­
cussing the legislative history of the 1935 statute that
passed but did not become law because it had a pocket veto.

40

We admit that that had marginal or no relevance, but we
responded only to the fact that the United States? raised that
for the first time ever in this litigation in their appellant’s
brief.
The third argument, the government argues that the
use of the word "private entries" in the legislative history
of the 1.936 amendment really can be construed to include state
indemnity selections as well.

And there is a reference to the

word "selected" or school selection by Senatory Hayden in the
1935 Act.

But a careful reading of that indicates that the

probability that he was talking about a selection for exchange,
when the state decides it wants to trade this piece for that,
it’s selecting the piece it wants to trade for.

You’ve got to

be careful — selection can mean either a selection for a trade
or a selection for school indemnity.
QUESTION:

When you say a reference in the act, do

you mean, in the text of the act enacted by Congress or in the
legislative discussion?
MR. DEWSNUP:

I am referring here simply to a

response by Senator Hayden to attorney Richard Page in the
June 35 19 hearings, to a statute that received a pocket, veto
and never became law.

That’s pretty far out, but. .it’s as

close as the government’s been able to come on any legislative
history.
Point four, and this is a. very important point that

41
I should have emphasised in my argument; I didn’t.

If there

is to be classification, then it should be limited to the kind
of classification the secretaries always perform, and that is
the criterion, Section 352.

How, in responsa to that argument

the government simply says Utah ignores the secretary's inde­
pendent classification authority under Section 7.

That just

simply tegs the question that he's got independent classifica­
tion authority, and even if he does, there is no response here
as to why that, the exercise of that discretion, is not limited
to the criteria Congress has set forth in Section 853.
Number five, and I mentioned this before, the secre­
tary, or the government, argues that there would in fact be
judicial review of classification decisions if it were arbitrary,
unreasonable.

We've said Overton Park -- that's just incon­

sistent with Overton Park.
I see the red and I 'm in the process of sitting down.
Number six says there's no constitutional issue be­
cause we did not get minerals at the time of the bilateral
compact, but the government's new value policy is not limited
to mineral exchanges.
And Section 7 simply attempts to rehabilitate the
origin of the comparative value criterion.

And I think we

have shewn that that is a very murky strange legislative his­
tory.
I thank you very much.

I am sorry for the extra 15

42
seconds.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, we've given you that

extra minute because of the lateness of the filing of this
brief.
MR. D77JSNUP:

That's an adequate quid pro quo.

Thank

you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Buscemi?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER BUSCEMI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. BUSCEMI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I just

have two quick points.
The first is that the State of Utah relies heavily on
the language of Section 1 of the act to demonstrate, as Mr.
Justice Stewart said before in the question he asked me, that
the act is simply not applicable to school indemnity selections.
That language is reprinted on page 35 of our brief.

It says

that the secretary's establishment of grazing districts shall
not affect any land heretofore or hereafter surveyed which
except for the provisions of this act would bs a part of any
grant to any stata.
Mr. Dewsnup has suggested that the school indemnity
selection would be a part of the grant to a state and there­
fore this act does not apply, but it is absolutely clear that
that provision in Section 1 was added to indicate that Utah

43
would retain its unsurveyed but enumerated school sections,
notwithstanding the creation of a grazing district.
Senator Wagner said to the assistant solicitor of
the department,

“Mr. Poole, we'd like to have to give us a de­

tailed explanation of the bill," and then Mr. Poole started
going through the bill, arid he said, "Now, on page 2, refer­
ring to this provision, protection is given to prior valid,
rights of private individuals or entries such as grants to
railroads, unperfected homestead entries, and settlement
rights, and also unsurveved school sections."

That is stated

generally.
And the land commissioner of Arizona who testified
later in the same Senate hearing said the same thing.

"In

the State of Arizona we have approximately six and a half
million acres of unsurveyed land and 750,000 acres of those
are school sections which under the terms of the Enabling Act
should, when and if surveyed, become th© property of th© State
of Arizona.'3
"I notice that the House bill has foaen amended in ary.
attempt to safeguard and to finally bring to the state those
particu1ar s ec tion s."
And then he goes on to say, "But I think the amend­
ment has been inadequate," because he wants to be protected
for the school indemnity selections as well.
change was made.

But no further1

44

The only other point I'd like to make, Your Honors,
is that Section 8 of the Taylor Grassing Act which counsel has
relied on, as just purely a point of information for the Court,
has now been repeal®! by the Federal Land Policy and Management
Act of 1976.

That's found at 90 stat 2792.

For the reasons I've stated here and in the brief,
we think: the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be re­
versed .
QUESTION:

Mr. Buscemi, I have a question or two

I’d like: to ask you.
Do you think that the Taylor Grazing Act impliedly
repealed any earlier federal statutes relating to federal lands?
MR. BySCEMI%

Well, I don't think so.

I’ra not sure

exactly what Your Honor's question is leading to.
QUESTIONi

Well, provisions relating to allocation

of lieu lands to the states, the Western states, and that sort
of thing»
MR, BUSCEMX:

Oh.

There is, as we have said in the

reply brief, there is no question in this ease of the secretary
trying to extinguish the state’s rights to indemnity selections.
I mean, that is purely a red herring.
QUESTION;

Well, after the enactment of the Taylor

Grazing Act, do you think the president could, or the secretary
acting for the president, could have withdrawn all public land
in any state for the purposes of classification, even against

45
a request by the state for lieu lands?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, the withdrawal has occurred.

But the question is, could the secretary refuse to classify any
lands ard thereby defeat all of the indemnity selection rights
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. BUSCEMI:

— and we have naver argued that he

could„
QUESTION:

Well, what remedy did the state have in a

case where the secretary for 15 years has refused to approve a
request for lieu land?
MR. BUSCEMI;

Well, Mr. Justice Kehnquist, I mean,

I’va stated before, and I think that delay is a bit overstated
here, but in any event, the stata, if the secreteiry simply re­
fused tc act on an application, which is not the allegation in
this case and the state is not complaining about the secretary'
refusal to act, it’s complaining about the basis, the stated
basis for the secretary's action whan it comas.

But if there

is a problem with unnecessary delay, I presume that there could
bs a lawsuit to mandamus the secretary to perform his classi­
fication duty, in the same way that there had been a series of
lawsuits under the Social Security Act, for example, to com­
pel the secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to act on
Social Security applications.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you.
