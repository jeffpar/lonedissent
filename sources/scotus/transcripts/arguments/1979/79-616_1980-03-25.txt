ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS MEAD SANTORO, ESQ.s
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRo SANTORO;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue before the Court in this case is
whether a charge of employment discrimination against
the petitioner Mohasco Corporation was filed within the
meaning of section 706 of Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 196*1, as Emended, and was the filing timely.
Cn June 15, 1976, the Equal Employment Oppor­
tunity Commission received a letter from the respondent
Ralph H. Silver charging Mohasco Corporation with
terminating him 291 days earlier because of his re­
ligion.

That day the EEOC deferred the charge to the

New York State Division ©f Human Rights pursuant to
section 706(c) of the act, and 55 days later, 58 -days
after receipt by the EEOC, Mr. Silver actually filed a
charge with the New York State Division of Human Rights»
Cn August 20. 19?6S 66 days after receipt of
the charge by the EE0Cs the EEOC sent a notice to the
petitioner that the charge of employment discrimination

4
had been filed,
Moh&aeo responded fco the EEOC with an objection
to its Jurisdiction on the ground that Silver had. failed
fco file a timely charge.

Ultimately, after a finding of

no probable cause by the Mew York State Division of Human
Eights, affirmed by its appeal board, and a finding of
no reasonable cause by the EEOC, this action was commenced.
The District Court on the timeliness question
-granted fehs petitioner Mohasco ’ s motion for summary
judgment, holding that the charge was not timely and
that the court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdici *'

fcion.

proceedings with a state agency with authority to grant
or seek relief.
days,

Such charge shall be filed within 300

Section 706(c)

states that in a deferral

state3 such as flew Yorks no charge may be filed by the
person aggrieved before the expiration of 60 days after
the proceedings have been commenced under state law
unless such proceedings are earlier terminated, and
706(c) also contains a deexaing provision for commence­
ment purposes under state law.
There are three interpretations of the statute
being urged before this Court, two by the petitioner
and one by the respondent and the government.

The first

is that in a deferral state the statute requires that a
charge of employment discrimination be filed with the
state agency within l80 days, in which case a complain­
ant will he ve 300 days to file with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission*
The second interpretation being asserted is
that in a deferral state the statute requires the
charge to be filed x^ithin 300 or less days provided de­
ferral of c.n appropriate period, either 120 days or 60
days or less, as appropriate, has been completed.
And the third interpretation -—
QUESTION:

So that equates with the 140 days.

MR. SANT0RG:
in.

Depending on the state you are

If you are in a state with an agency which is less

than one year old, the deferral would necessarily be

€

.120 days, as that is required by the statute.

If you

are in a state which has an agency which is older than
one year, then it would be 6Q days or such lesser time if
that state agency completes its proceedings in 3.©ss than

60 days.
The third interpretation is that in a deferral
state the statute requires the charge to be filed within
300 days and all else is irrelevant.
Mow, each has received the approval of
District arid Circuit Courts, but we feel that the
majority support the first interpretation, that in a
deferral state the statute requires the charge to be
filed within 180 days, and we think.this can be shown
by subjecting each of these three interpretations to a
three-part analysis, asking first whether the interpre­
tation comports with the language of the statute;
second, whether it comports and if it is even needed
to resort to legislative history, the statutory purpose
and intent; and the third Is an analysis of the resuite,
whether they are fair and equitable, understandable or
consistent and predictable <>
Dealing first with the first interpretation
that you must filed with a state agency within 180 days
— which, by the way, means really filing somewhere
within 180 days, because if by chance one files with

the EEOC, the statute mandates that th© EEOC defer, so
we assume that under this first interpretation the l8o
days will be accomplished even if a person mistakenly
goes to the EEOC first.
language.

It comports with the statutory

706 (e) clearly states that a charge under

the act shall be filed within l80 days except with re­
gard to the initiati instituting language.
Secondly, I don't think there is any need to
resort to statutory history because, quite frankly,
vrhen the words of the statute are clear, I don’t think
there is any necessity to resort to legislative history.
But if you do, you find that the statute as enacted in
1964 specifically required a great deal of diligence.
The Dirksen-Mansfield compromise which per­
mitted this statute to pass had in mind two specific
goals, a short limitation period in which an individual
complaining; of discrimination should act and prior re­
sort to state proceedings.
This is further supported when the *?2 amend­
ments came along by Congress* failure to change 706(c)
in any way and its retention In its lengthening of the
time periods in 706(e) of the 120-day spread which
clearly relates, Mr. Justice Blackraun, to the 120 days
allowed to defer to a state with a fair employment
practices agency which is less than one year old.

8
And further, the results are exceedingly fair,
understandable and consistent»

The I30-day rule is the

same, no matter what state the complainant is in. whether
or not it is a deferral stato.

Across the United States.

the rule is the same, it is understandable, and so
thought many courts that have considered it.
The Eighth Circuit , in Olson v. Rembrandt
Printing, the Sixth Circuit recently in Geroaetfce,
certain District Courts in California and Ohio, and
under this interpretation, the respondent, Mr. Silver,
is clearly not timely because he filed nowhere within
X80 days.
The second interpretation subjected to the
same analysis, the second interpretation being that in
a deferral state you must file within 300 days or less,
providing the appropriate deferral has been completed
within 120, 60 days or less, depending on haw quickly
the state disposes of it.
First, does It comport with the statutory
language?

Well, arguably, yes, and the courts have

felt that it did, but I submit that one need to take
no particular close attention to the fact thajfc the
i

i

clause In which the exception is contained isj no more
than a clause, and it uses the past tense, "has
initially instituted."

I submit that although it is

consistent with the statutory language,, it is not per­
haps as consistent as one might wish„
With regard to the second analysiss does it
comport with the legislative history.

In the first

place, you definitely need to resort to the legislative
%;

£;V .

history because you have to rely on a remedial purpose

;'

.

of the statute type of reasoning in order to reach this
'result.

It seems to run against the diligence required

by the Dirksen-Mansfield amendment that a short statute
I

|

is/.one of those two requirements since it is going to
lengthn that time period in deferral states in a way

which has not lengthened them in all other statesV
:

j

lastly, with regard to the results, the re­

sults will very probably bo inconsistent,
QUESTION:

j

Mr, Santoro, before you leave the

legislative history, you really haven’t squarely dealt
with the comment in the conference report approving of
the Vigil case in the *72 legislative history.

It

seems to me that is a rather important thing for you
to face squarely.
MR. SANTORO:

1 submit, Mr. Justice Stevens,

that that is the view of at most a single member of
Congress perhaps.

Senator Williams I believe is the

author of that report.

It is not contained in the

joint explanatory explanation, it is merely a section

10
by section analysis and it further conflicts with a
statement by Rep. Dent who explained the procedural re­
quirements as requiring a filing within ISO days regard­
less of whether one is in a deferral state or not®

And

so it seems to me that to credit the statement of
Senator Williams over the statement of Rep. Dent makes
no particular sense * especially in view of the fact
that Congress specifically declined to change the
language in a way which would have very clearly indi­
cated that this change was intended.

I think it is a

bit extreme to argue —
QUESTION:

Is there any reason for their'

failure to change the language other than Senator
Williams T explanation?
MR. SANTORO:
QUESTION:

Excuse me?

Is there any explanation for their

failure to change the statute insofar as relevant here
except the explanation given by Senator Williams?
KR. SANTORO:

Yes, that they did not intend

the change to he made., and that in fact 706(c) was in­
tended to require deferral.
QUESTION:

Is it correct in your view that

if you prevail here then the Vigil ease was incorrectly
decided?
MR, SANTORO:

Yes,

11
With regard to the results* they are very
probably, inconsistent»

They are dependent in each state

upon the state’s statute of limitations.

Now* in the

first place* of course* one must file a timely state
charge in order t© be entitled to the 300 days* no matter
hosr you view the statute,

You must still file within

180 days if you happen fcc b® in a state with a hew
agency because you are going to need that 120 days to
defer.

You must file within 2^0 days in other states

or you risk being late if the state does not dispose of
the charge in less than time period®

It does not mean

that your time would, necessarily be timely but you do
subject yourself to a risk and it seems to me that
that is not a result which is desirable in interpreting
the statute„
Nonetheless* the interpretation has received
considerable support* not the least of which being the
Fourth Circuit in Doski and. of course* it was first
suggested* Hr. Justice Stevens* in a footnote in your
tV

opinion in Moore in 1972»
Under the second, interpretation* again the
respondent Silver is not timely* although he submitted
to the EEOC within 300 days and commenced state pro­
ceedings at least under the deeming provision of 706(c)
within 300 days* namely 291 days* the charge could not

12
be filed under ?06(e) until August 1*1* 19?68 352 days
after the alleged discriminatory practice, wall beyond
the 300 days.
An alternative view of these same facts is
that Silver Is not even entitled to the 300 days because
he did not initially institute state proceedings for
706(e) purposes.

706(e) has no deeming provision and

he never did at any time within 300 days commence the
proceedings.

Both of these interpretation which w©

urge, of course, require that the word wfilew within
the statute

as contained in 706(c) and (e) be read to

mean the a me ■thing.
The last view, that urged by the respondents
and the government, is that in a deferral state you
have 300 days to file with the EEOC, no matter what.
Now, the position urged by the government and the
Second Circuit majority below I think does not bear up
under the three-part test.
Does it comport with the statutory analysis?
It clearly does not.

In fact, it requires the word

*®file” to be read differently when reading each sub­
section, and so the Second Circuit majority held in
order to reach the conclusion that it did.
Secondly, does it comport with the legislative
history?

Well, it is certainly necessary to resort to

13
It.

In fact, It is required If you are going to find any

support for this view.

It requires a resort to what X

consider & rather tortured scouring of the legislative
history for a kernel of support in this section fey
section analysis which would seem to completely ignore
the legislative compromise which permitted, the statute
to pass in the first place,
With regard to the results, it mandates that
the results be inconsistent between deferral and nondeferral states.

It la manifestly unfair in that it

favors the complainant who avoid state proceedings.
If you want to file, say, within 180 days with the
state agency, which terminates its proceedings quickly,
we will still get less than 300 days ; whereas a person
that files later under this rule with a state who
doen'fc terminate quickly is going to get the 300 days
any way you slice it.
kohaaco argues that this third interpretatlon is simply not supported by the words of the statute
or its intent9 and although it preserves the complain­
ant's day in court, It does so at an intolerable price.
It refuses to credit the literal words of the statute,
It

penalises employers in deferral states with statutes

•of limitations in excess of 180 days by taking away a
substantive right to be free from claims filed after

180 days bestowed by the same Congress which created the
previously nonexistent right for alleged victims.
Perhaps most importantly, it constitutes a
rejection of the democratic process of compromise which
permitted passage of this laudable statute.

Ho doubt,

the respondent and the government would prefer a statute
which gave them what they seek here, out perhaps it is
ture that the greatest thing about a democracy is that
nobody gets exactly what they want.
What we ask is that the statute be interpreted
as the Congress intended it, arid in closing I would say
that perhaps Mr. Justice Cardosa, when he was still on
the Court of Appeals in my native Hew York, said it
best, that the wisdom of fairness of the statute I
make no attempt to vindicate, our duty is done when we
enforce the law as written.
If Congress had intended a longer statute of
limitations, it could have provided one»

We submit that

it did not and that the judgment of the court should be
reversed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH P. VLADECK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MRS, VLADECK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue here today is the meaning of a sentence
in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, section 706(a), and
the particular phrase with which this case is concerned is
the

which states that in a deferral state a charge shall

be filed on behalf of the person aggrieved within 300 days
after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.
Me are told that there are three possible inter­
pretations:

the 300 days may not mean 300 days; that it

may mean 240 days, although SHQ days does not appear in
the statute; or that it may mean 180 days, which would
require a rewriting of the statute or complete amendment
of it.

days within which to file with the Buffalo office.

Having

been told that* he was told something which was the con­
sistent policy of EEOC sine® 1968:

That is, in the deferral

state* to give the larger tine provided by section 706(e)
or by its predecessor which had permitted only 210 days.
Had he called Hew York State Division of Human
Rights, he would have been told he had one year within
which to file with that agency.
Mr. Silver filed with the EEOC within 291 days
©f his termination.

EEOC deemed his filing to have been

timely, deferred to the state agency in accordance with

17
another* provision of section ?06s that is 706(c) 9 permitted
the state agency to act upon the charge 9 resumed the process­
ing of it at a later date* more than 60 days later» and
ultimately issued to Mr. Silver the right to sue.
The company, without reaching the merits., de­
fended on the ground that the charge with EEOC had been
untimely,

The varying decisions of the District Court and

of the majority and of the minority in the Circuit Court
show that, although we are told that the language, is plain,
it certainly seems to be confusing enough sine® with all
of the attention given to it# there were three separate
views of what 300 days meant.
The majority of the Circuit Court said 300 days
means 300 days,

Th® minority in th© Circuit Court said

it does not. it means X8o days;

the District Court • having

-found that It really meant 2k0 days.

The question is when was the charge

filed.
MRS. I'Ll DECK:

291 days after the day of the

occurrence of the action complained of.
QUESTION:

Then what do you do with the language

in 706(c) that says no charge may be filed under subsection
(b) by the person aggrieved before the expiration of 60

days after proceedings have been commenced under state law?
MRS- YLADECK:

1 read it aa Congress intended

that It should be read and as it said it should be read in
the 1972 amendment or in the discussion prceding the 1972
amendments»

I believe that reference was made to a state­

ment by Senator Williams during that debate which I think
may not have characterised it entirely correctly.
In 1972 or preceding the 1972 amendmenta5 there
was the proposals a Senate bille which would have changed
706(c) so that the language s;no charge my be filed” would

You may well be right.

You would

reading that is directly contrary to its plain reading of
it?
MRS. 7LADECK:

I think it is necessary to under­

stand what Congress understood, whether it understood
correctly or incorrectly.

I think what it understood

the language to mean is what is dispositive, and what it
said it understood was that it did not have to change
the language because that had already been don®.

The

interpretation of the language which it would have se~

i.

leeted had been achieved for it by a decision of this
Court and by a decision of the Tenth Circuit, both of
which is referred to very specifically in the section by

way it read.Love, whether it did sorestly or not, and
that it read Vigil in a precis© fashion.

MRS, VLABECK;

I say that resort to a state

300-day statute, but it can be resort to the agency
through the deferral procedure which has been developed
by EEOC which has approved in Love.
Mr. Silver did not have to walk to the State
Division office first and then to EEOC's office, although

made all the difference, had he gone to the Mew York

I would add to the discussion of what happened

in 1972 a statement that at that time not only did the
Congress have and did it refer explicitly to Love and to
Vigil, it had before it and was familiar with and attached
to the '72 amendments the EEOC regulations.

At the time

that Title VII was enacted in 196ft by express provision,

22
EEOC was given power from time to time to adopt regulations
to create procedures»
The EEOC has uniformly applied the section as

there was a tacit endorsement of what EEOC had don©.

it is very important to state that when this statute was

or the localities.

?:1
While there was a compromise, there was; ho ab­

dication»
There was a very express development of
statutory proviaion that guaranteed deferral to the ■
state.

That was a primary concern and the primary in­

gredient of that compromise.

It remains intact*

There

is no question but that EEOC and its processes In this
case and others have permitted the state and the local
agenda's to act.
By 1972, Congress had learned a lot»

In the

first instance, it had not spent too much time or effort

23
In developing procedures In 196$.

It was concerned about

very broad strokes about basic policy kinds of pronounce­
ments .

It left very largely to ESOC and to the courts

the development of the procedures.
By 1972. It was a different time and a different
place and Congress had a different approach to the
problem of dealing with discrimination in employment.

recognised again, as the courts had done in the develop­
mental period, that this was a statute largely used by
laymen, it was a statute which could not be hypert®cli­
nically applied.
Congress also recognised that its hope and plan
for conciliation as the primary method of disposition of
employment discrimination appeared to be less likely to
be fulfilled and emphasized more and more the need for
litigation and more and more to remove barriers rather
then to create them.

-

In order to find the hidden 2k 0 days 3 on® must
reject all of the congressional statements that were made
at the time of the 1972 amendments.
I would like to point out that Mr. Silver was
pro se in this case as are virtually all persons who
initially file with state or with EEOC, so —
QUE3TI0M;

That goes to the question — I sup­

pose ho relied on the EEOCs they gave him his legal

24
advice that he had 300 days, so it really wouldn’t have
made much difference what the statute said, he just relied
on what they said.
MRS. VLADECK:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

But If he had read the first two

lines of the statute of limitations, he would have been
told that he had. to file within 180 days unless he had
previously filed, with the state agency.
MRS. VLADECK;
QUESTION:

Yes, he might., have.

I don’t think the language of the

■statute is deceptive.

You have to read a long ways, before

you get into any intricacies.
MBS. VLADECK:

Yes, you do but you have tffi —

I think if we are talking about legislative intent’» 'we
have to keep coming back to the fact that it was Congress
that said it. was going to create this dual system," it
was going to have deferral states and non-deferral states,
and Congress
QUESTION:

Did they ever explain why a person

should be allowed more than ISO days in some states to

25
start a proceeding but should be required to act within
l8o days in other states?

Is there anything in Congress’

legislative history to explain why there shouldn’t foe the
same rule throughout the country?
MRS» VLADSCK:

There is nothing that makes any

sense- Your Honor, nothing that I have found.

I certainly

don’t think there was any clear understanding in ±9'qM of
how long it was going to take either at the state level,
the local level, or at the federal level to wend one’s
way through the administrative procedures.

There were

references in the legislative history to three, five,
seven days of a deferral period.

That doesn’t make any

sense to anybody who hears it today, I don’t believe.
Similarly, there isn’t very much sense ©r
rational kind of structure in any of the state system.
We have within the states variations from 30 days to
three yeasr for filing.

Three years is a recently, 1979

enactment in North Dakota.

Hero in the District of

Columbia, precisely what happened to Hr. Silver ,could
have happened to one of the residents of this District.
You have a one-year statute.

In other places there are

90 days.
The numbers game can go on endlessly, but It
is clear that Congress decided on two sets of numbers,
one in deferral states and on® in non-deferral states.

26
Mr, Silver lived in a deferral state.

And I might suggest

that Congress might have been sympathetic to the victim
of discrimination who had to make his way through the
various of the administrative agencies before he could
hope for a federal remedy.
In Hew York City, you may even have three
choices or four.

There- are counties, there are city and

state —
QUESTIOH:

Yea, but Is it not correct that under

your view of the statute it could simply have said in nondeferral states fch© charge must be filed within 180 clays
and in deferral states it must be filed in 300 days,
period.

MRS. VALDECK:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

That is what you say all this:

language means, isn’t it?
MRS. VLADECK;
of it.

That is a very simple stfet.^asrrk

part of the 1972 amendments to Title VII.
With respect to these 1972 amendments9 I would
like to make several points.

First, the reference to the

Vigil case in the section by section analysis introduced
by Senator Williams that counsel for petitioner has re­
ferred to5 this’Is not simply the statement of a single
member.

An identical section by section analysis w&b

introduced on the House side following the submission of

28
the conference report by Rep. Perkins who was the Chairman
of the relevant House committee.
QUESTION:

What do you mean by Introduced?

MR. KNEEDLER;
QUESTION:

To whom?

MR, KNEEDLER:
QUESTION:

Submitted into the Record.

What record?

MR. KNEEDLER:
QUESTION:

Submitted, I'm sorry.

The Congressional Record.

The floor debates?

MR, KNEEDLER:

That's right.

The section by

section analysis, as 1 mentioned, waa submitted in
identical form by the chairmen of the respective full
committees in the House and the Senate.
QUESTION:

Weren't they part of the committee

report?
MR. KNEEDLER:

tion with it.

They were submitted in conjunc­

They were not officially part of the

statement of managers, the joint statement of the.managers
of the House and Senate, but they were introduced into
the Record at the same time,

The conference report itself

does contain a specific reference to the Love case and
what the conferees said is that the conferees left exist­
ing law intact with the understanding that the decision
interpreting ;he existing law to allow the commission to
receive a charge but not act on it during such deferral

29
period is controlling,
QUESTION:

Mr* Kneedler, if we adopt that inter­

pretation of Love, the plaintiff loses here because then
the charge wouldn’t be filed until the 60-day period, went
by and we would treat it automatically as being filed on
the 3^1st day or whatever it is*
MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

The way the conferees were

interpreting Love ~~ and again whether or not this inter­
pretation was correct or not Is for these purposes beside
the point, I think — what the conferees were equating X
believe is the notion that the commission may receive the
charge as being the -equivalent of the aggrieved person
satisfying the filing requirement* because if you look at
the —
QUESTION:

You don’t suggest that Love held

that though?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No» but I think that that reading

of Love is at least a. reasonable one.

I think we have to

recognise that Love had been decided several weeks earlier
at the time the conference report ~~ I guess a month
earlier» at the time the conference committee earns through.
And what the language in Love said was that the charge
filed with the commission may be held in suspended anima­
tion while there is a deferral to the state, and. X think
that it could be a reasonable interpretation ©f Love that

30
suspended animation would mean that the aggrieved person
has satisfied hie filing requirement, but that the eommission could not formally file it, and the Love ©pinion
uses that phrase "formally filed it after the deferral
period."
So the deferral period limits in a sense the
commission's control of its own docket, it cannot enter a
case onto its investigate rolls until the deferral period
is over.

But that controls what the commission can do,

so the commission is not going to intrude on what Congress
believed should be handled by the states in the first in­
stance,,
But it doesn’t follow from that that the ag­
grieved person should be thought not to have satisfied
his filing requirements within the statutory period.

So

I think it is in that sense that Congress understood Lore,
as upholding the right of the commission to receive-, the
mere image of the commission's receiving is that the in­
dividual has filed his charge.
QUESTION:

It is correct though then that you

do give the word "filed" two different means in the ■
statute under that meaning?

HR. KNESDIsER:
QUESTION:

Yes. in that sense.

The 300-day one you treat what was

done on the 291st day as a filing and under 706(c) you

31
treat the 60-day later period as the filing, you say that
it is —
MR. KNEEDLER:
QUESTION:

Yes, in that —

So the same word refers to two dif­

ferent dates.
MR. KNEEDLER:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

I don’t mean to suggest that ends th©

ease or anything like that, but you do ~~
MR. KNEEDLER:

No, as a purely literal matter,

yes, there is that difference, but again this comports with
what Congress understood to be the different purposes of
subsection 706(c) and (e) and this was stated in lipve it­
self, that subsection 706(c) is designed to allow the
state to have a prior opportunity to look at the charge
before the federal government brings its resources' to

bear and —
QUESTION:

May I just ask you on® question to
:

i

be .sure that you do have a chane® to respond'to Ity in
case it is missed.

Is there anything at all to suggest

that there was a reason why. Congress thought there was
a reason why someone should need more than 180 days to
file his first piece of paper somewhere in a deferral
state than in a non-deferral state?
MR. KNEEDLER:

I think that conclusion follows

from the underlying policy of section 706 itself, which

32
is deferral to the states*

I'm not suggesting that

Congress believed that delay should be excused in some
situations rather than in another, but Congress must surely
have been aware of the varying procedures and limitations
and substantive laws of the various states, and Congress
did not attempt to finely tune section 706 so that therewould be- a perfect matching of federal Jurisdiction and
state jurisdiction»

It was addressing the generality of

state statutes and in doing so it decided that 300 days
or some additional period of time was appropriate to
allow a person t© resort to state proceedings»
It is not uncommon in an analogous area, for
example, if there is a federal statute that is silent on
a statute of limitations for this Court to borrow the
V&ppropriafce state statute of limitations as controlling
a federal action because of the deference to the states
whore there would be no countervailing fedeahai policy»
Here there is on the very face of the act a
policy of deferral to the states and there doesn't seem to
V

be any federal interest to be served in requiring a .person
.

\

to file within 180 days.
QUESTION:

You don't think there is a federal

interest in having these proceedings start promptly?
MR. KHEEDLER;

Oh, yes»

Nos I am not suggesting

that, but Congress addressed that with the 300-day «-

33
QUESTION:

Well, didn't it address it in the

first sentence when It says the normal rule shall be 180
days?

Isn’t that the federal policy, the l80 —
MR. KNEEDLER:

That is the federal policy where

there Is no state law to defer to,
QUESTION:

But it doesn’t say that.

It says ex­

cept where there has been an initial — that isn’t quite
what it aays.
MR» KNEEDLER:

Well, the statutory language is

where the aggrieved person has initially instituted state
■{

proceedings.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Now, the phrase "initially in­

stituted" does not suggest that it be filed — there is
' )

no mention, for Instance, in the deferral state part that
a person must file within l80 days in a state.

The phrase

"initially instituted" I think ties in with subsection
706(c) which Is that the person must commence his state
proceedings, either directly himself or by the EEOC’s re­
ferral of the charge to the state on his behalf within
that period,
Of course, under the EEOC regulations, that will
automatically happen, even on the 300th day, because the
EEOC’s regulations require the commission to forward a
charge to the state if the aggrieved person has not don® so.

3^

QUESTION:

But true only In a deferral state.

MR. KNEEDLER:

That?s right.

So the state will

get a notice — will receive the charge as soon as the

commission does, according to the coaaaission’s regulations.
Now, the purpose of the limitations period in
section 706 was identified by the Court In the Occidental
Life Insurance ease, that a statute of limitation is in­
tended to put. the respondent to an EEOC charge on notice
that & charge has been filed to allow him to prepare, to
retain recorda to prepare for a possible lawsuit 3 a con­
ciliation settlement or whatever.
But even under petitioner’s construction, of the
act as, for instance, requiring the filing within" -.18,0
days, nothing in section 706 requires that the empldjyer
receive any notice of the charge filed with the state
within 180 days.

For instance, 706 requires deferral to

a state if the appropriate state law Is & criminal pro­
ceedings and It would be unusual that a state would
promptly notify a possible target of the criminal investi­
gation that he is under criminal investigation.
So the one purpose that can toe Identified with
a federal limitations period would not necessarily be
served under petitioner’s construction of the law because

there would be no guarantee that the employer would re­
ceive the notice at that period of time.

But in our

construction of section 706(e), as soon as the commission
does receive the charge the commission would be required
to promptly notify within 10 days the employer*

So the

300-day limitation period that Congress has set on the
outside as an outside limit for filing a federal charge
would insure that prompt notification of the employer.
I see that ay time is up.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Santoro, do you have anything further?

MR. SANTORO:
things.

I would say in rebuttal only two

With regard to the respondent’s reliance on any­

thing that the E’EOC may or may

not

have told him, 2 would

refer the 'curt to the appendix, page 3, the actual complaint letter where it is clear that whatever th$sy told his
should have no the issue in this case.
I would also add that the purpose of the statute
is to protect the defendant as well as to notify them, in
response to what Mr'. Kneedler has Just said.
Other than that, if there are no questions, from
the bench, I —
QUESTION:

Appendix page 3?

MR. SANTORO:

That is the complaint

letter, and on the first line it indicates that ~

36
QUESTION:

RI have only 300 days in which to

file a claim.w
MR, SANTORO:

Yes*

To the extent that the re­

spondent may claim that he was misled by the E£OCs to the
extent that the statute requires a filing within l8o days*
nothing that the EEOC did in this ease prevented the re­
spondent, who made no attempt obviously from the language
of his own complaint letter* to file one prior to that.
QUESTION:

Mho is Mrs» Lyn Miller?

MR. SANTORO:

Presumably an employee of the

EEOC.
QUESTION:

The Buffalo office of the EEOC.

MR. SANTORO:

I would also correct one other

item which came up in Mrs. ¥ladeekts argument.

The actual

charge was filed with the New York State Division of
Human Rights on the 3%th day»

For purposes of the

deeming provision of section 706(c) only 'would we deem
it to be commenced on the 391st day when EEOC deferred.
QUESTION:

If the complaint had been filed di­

rectly with the state agency on the 291st day, would the
i

same arguments be mad© here?
MR. SANTORO:

Yes, they would., depending upon

the interpretation adopted, however.
difference in the result in this ease.

It would make no
If the first in­

terpretation which I suggested, the 180-day interpretation

37
is correct, then clearly it would not have been timely.
If the second were adopted then it might have been timely
if the state had completed Its proceedings within 300 days.
QUESTION:

But it didn't.

MR. SANTORO:

But it didn't and it would not

have been timely,
QUESTION:

The EEOC would be making the same

argusienfc and the government would be making the same argu­
ment «.
MR. SANTORO:
QUESTION:

Yea * I believe so.

If it had been filed directly with

the state agency on the 291st day?
MR, SANTORO:
QUESTION:

I believe they would, yes.

Under what provision —* Is that

covered by their regulation, too?
MR. SANTORO:

Well, perhaps I am misunderstanding

your question.
QUESTION:

Here it was filed with the — here

It was first received by the EEOC and referred to the
state, wasn't it?
MR, SANTORO:
QUESTION:

ThatTs correct.

Suppose it had never been received

by the EEOC mid they had never seen, it until 60 days
after it was filed with the state agency?
MR. SANTORO:

In that case, then I think there

3S
is no question that under any interpretation it would not
have 'been timely» unless somehow the EEOC obtained a copy
of that charge, if someone filed it on his behalf or if
the state —
QUESTION:

Well, 1 assume that it has.

So if

ora the 291st day or anytime after 240 days there ie a
direct filing with the state agency and the EEOC doesn't
get it at all until after 300 days, that is the end of it?
MR. SANTORO:

It would h® not timely, that'®

correct.
QUESTION:

Perhaps I should h&ve asked your op­

ponent this question, but there has been.an awful lot
written about the EEOC and problems related to this.,.

I

was just wondering, has there any study been made about
analysing how many late complaints ■— how ©any complaints
are filed within the•period of between 180 and 300 days,
what percentage of them are filed more promptly than 180
days, or anything of that kind?
MR. SAJfTGBO:
QUESTION:

I'm not aware.

They do an awful lot of business, I

guess, at the EEOC.
MR. SANTORO:

They do and I am not aware of any

study that has been mad© as to how many such cases there
are.
