PROCEEDINGS
MR9 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Zwiener, you may

proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LONNY F„ ZWIENER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS_
MRo ZWIENER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case, Vance v. Universal Amusement Company,
has had a very long, tortuous history, starting off with a
number of separate cases in the State of Texas and some 20
of those cases being consolidated before one three-judge
court.
As a consequence, many issues got obscured.

But

I think that the issue that is presented today is clear and
that is whether or not there can be any prior restraint imposed
in the First Amendment area.

Can there be any? if

procedures that protect First Amendment rights are adopted,
can there then be the type of thing we have here, an injunction
against the future showing of, in this case obscene movies
even though those particular movies have never been judicially
determined.
QUESTION:
5

Mr. Ziener --

MRo ZWIENER?
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

May I say so, with all due respect, that

it is a little difficult reading the briefs to discern what the

4

issues are in this case, at least it was for me.
But, in any event, may I aslc you:

Do you concede

that Article 4666 is not involved in this case now before us
and you do so because you concede the unconsticutionality of
that article?
MR o ZWIENER:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Well, i thought you did.

HR. ZWIENER:

The brief says that we concede.

have said it has never been involved.

We

Our briefs to the Fifth

Circuit
QUESTION:

And the holding of the court that this

article is unconstitutional, and I am quoting from your brief
now, is not questioned by these appellants in thi3 Court?
HR. ZWIENER:
QUESTION:

In £his Court, that is tv>ue.

Now, isn't that the equivalent of

conceding?

•
MRo ZWIENER:
QUESTION:

All right, Your Honor, —-

Or if not, then correct rae.

tRo SivTEHER:

Sell, all right, that interpretation,

yes, sir, we are conceding it.,

But I hate to concede it, because

because, of the brief of the amicus in this case;' Charles Keating,
argues that it is constitutional and we will —
QUESTION:

Another amicus argues that it is

unconstitutional.
MRo ZWIENER:

Yes, sir.

5

QUESTION:

And yet you say it is not an issue.

MR» ZWIENER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

It wasn’t an issue below.

That is one of the many reasons that

cause me not a little confusion in reading this brief.
MRo ZWIENER:

As a matter of fact, I think ---

this case, as 1 say had gotten -- there were so many different
cases, with so many different issuas, that this issue never
really got squarely presented I suppose until it did get to
the Fifth Circuit.
QUESTION:

But it is an issue now.

MRo SWISHER:
QUESTION:

That is true, Your Honor.

Because, in effect, you do not question

the holding that it is unconstitutional? is that it?
MR. ZWIENER:
QUESTION:

I don’t ---•

In that sense.

MR. ZWIENER:

All right, the brief says that this

particular point may have been in error in making that state sent
because of -QUESTION:

I am more confused now.

MRo ZWIENER:

Weil, I think that the Court can

correct me if I am wrong.
QUESTION:

Well, you are presenting your case here,

and I just wonder what case you have.
MR. ZWIENER:

All right, vre will tell the Court —

7. think this case could have been settled early on if Moore

s
Simms had been decided, and we will suggest to the Court
— and I do suggest to the Court that if you apply Moore v.
Simms, you can hold that the court below should not have taken
this case at all.
QUESTION:

?ou don’t make that argument in your

brief.
ME. ZWIENER:

Ho, Your Honor, I don’t.

This brief

was written of course before Moore v. Simms, at least before
it came --it was brought to our consciousness.

&nd it

actually occurred to us when we passed a new obscenity statute
which was contested in Texas.
QUESTION:

What court decided Moor© v. Simms?

MRu ZWIENER;

This Court, Your Honor.

It is a —
QUESTION:

What is the citation?

MR„ ZWIENER:

Oh, I don’t know, Your Honor.

It

was decided in June.
QUESTION:

I recall that case.

QUESTION:

It was the one involving the juvenile

statute.
MR. ZWIENER:

That is true, Your Honor.

i\n& this

Court decided it on the principles of abstention, and we
would say that that discussion in Moore v. Simms probably would
have required the court below in this case to have dismissed
ail the cases and that the State courts construe its own

?

statutes.
QUESTION :

Well, it wasn’t decided on --

MRo ZWIENER:

That is why — Your Honor, I don’t want

to concede 4666, even though I may have said so.
QUESTION:
opinion

Well, it wasn’t decided -- I wrote the

it wasn’t decided in the Pullman extension at all.

It was decided on the civil counterpart of Younger v. Harris
dismissal abstention.
MRo ZWIENER:

Well, Your Honor, if it was decided

on that basis, I am sorry I misrepresented, Your Honor, to
a couple of courts, because I said that there was no reason
to discuss Pullman if it didn’t have some meaning in the case,
because obviously Younger is present as far as a pending case,
a case is concerned.
As I say, I probably argued that case incorrectly,
from what Your Honor has just s(aid.
QUESTION:

I share Mr. Justice Stewart’s confusion

about your position.

*

I want to be sure about one other thing.
MR, ZWISHER:
QUESTION:

All right.

I take it that the attorneys’ fee issue

is not before us.
MR0 ZWIENER:
jurisdictional statement.

Well, we did mention it in our
We have not argued it in our briefs.

I would hope that the Court would consider that in deciding

3

this case, because — again, because we have these multiplicity
of cases we are going to have attorneys' fees possibly levied
against a county attorney who never did really anything in
this particular situation, this big mass of cases.

We just

suggest that maybe a lease should be canceled, or at least
talk to the landlord which precipitated this case.
QUESTION:

Isn’t it listed in your questions

presented?
MR» ZWIENER:

All right, Your Honor, we will hope

to resolve it, the issue below.
■■

But I would like to clear up some of the things that

-tire have here.

4667 is involved, and that statute says if the

habitual use of —- or of premises for a certain purpose will
be enjoined.

It says the use, and not the property.

That is

why we were saying no prosecutor really tried to apply in the
State of Texas 4666 and close the place for a year.

The reason

they didn't is because there was under the old obscenity
statute, before it was amended some years ago, a section 13
which permitted enjoining premises for obscene -- the use of
premises for obscene matters.

And that did not permit closing.

So when the obscenity statute was amended, and the injunction
provisions removed, no one --''at least in the prosecution area,
that I know of •—» ever considered trying to padlock for a year,
which is provided for in 4666.

It just didna t occur to them.

Now, as far as the prior restraint, the other question

9

in this case is whether an injunction can he drawn that enjoins
the use of premises for the future showing of pictures which
have not been judicially determined to be obscene where
the injunction is drawn in explicit terms as far as the sexual
conduct enjoined and also cites the requirements of Miller.
QUESTION:

According to your brief, if not to your

oral argument today, that is the only issue presented to us in
this case?
HR» ZWIENER:
QUESTION:

The one you have just stated.

MRo ZWIENER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Do you agree with that?

That is what

your brief seeias to say- seems to say to me.
MB. ZWIENER:
Honor.

That is what my brief says, Your

QUESTION:

And you say that today?

MR. ZWIENER:

I say that today.

I will ask the

Court later to set aside the decision below on the basis of
Moore

-V,

Simms, so that I won't be caught by that position.
QUESTION:

If the District Court shouldn't have

dismissed this case entirely but was correct in considering
the merits on the merits -MRo ZWIENER:.
QUESTION:

That is my single issue.

And the only issue.

MRo ZWIENER:

Yes, sir.

10

QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

General Zwiener, you say that later today

though you are going to argue another issue.
MR. ZWIENER:

Well, no, it is just that

QUESTION:. You are going to say that Moore v. Simms,
which Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointed out, was a case involving
a pending State proceeding, which under Younger barred the
Federal Court

from proceeding under the court's holding.

And

here the District Court, as I understand it, expressly held
the Younger abstention did not apply because there is no
pending State proceeding.
MR0 ZWIENER:
QUESTION:

That is true.

Now, way are you going to ask us to do

something different under Moore v. Simms?
MR. ZWIENER:

Well, in most of the ca?es the

consolidated cases, there were pending civil -QUESTION:

But not in this one.

MRo ZWIENER:

But not in this one.

And I was also going to ask you, based on what I
thought Moore v. Simms said about the Pullman abstention, and
I thought that was a basis of the Moore v. Simms holding, that
where you had a State statute that was capable of constitutional
construction by the Stata courts, the Federal courts would
give the State courts the opportunity to consider the statute
and make those constitutional constructions.

And I

I
11

would

'
■QUESTION:

Well, that is -- as I understand it, that

Pullman abstention, but it was not applied in Moore v. Simms.
That is not argued in this case, I as understand it.
MRo ZWISNER:
■

Well, until you had told me, Your

j .

Honor, what you have told me, Your Honor, you do discuss the
Pullman,<doctrine.
QUESTION:
v. Simms.

Well, it certainly is discussed in Moore

I did not recall it as

being the main focus of the

thing, &1though I am sure it is cited in the case.
MR0 ZWIENER:

But let's talk about the procedures,

which is criticized by the Appellee that in Texas to obtain
ah injunction, Mr. Frierson argues that a temporary restraining
order can be obtained without notice.

I would again refer the

Court tc Article 16 of the old obscenity statute 527, which
required notice.

And again, in most situations Mr. Frierson

points to a situation in the case in Dallas where apparently
there was not notice, I point to a case that came out of
Austin and have the injunction issued in that case, which is
a part cf the consolidated cases where the courts expressly
said there will be no temporary restraining orders issued.
There will have to be no dissenting hearing before there will
be an injunction in this type of case.
I would say, Your Honor,, becaiise that notice is
required, and 1 think that in most instances the Texas courts

12

will provide it.
Now, there is a hearing,again ray opposite number
as far as counsel is concerned, disagree.

I say at the hearing

on the temporary injunction that the question of obscenity is
considered and decided and a temporary injunction cannot issue
without that decision.

And we cite in our brief Roth v.

State and Richards v. State, and it is apparent in those cases
if the question of obscenity was considered at the injunction
hearing and also on appeal, which is another point raised,
and I differ.
QUESTION:

Mr. Zwiensr. what is the question of

obscenity when you are talking about unknown films or books
in the future? what can that be?
MR. ZWIENER:

All right, what we do -- well, of

course there has to be some use of the property and that is
QUESTION:

An identified --

MR. ZWIENER:
QUESTION:

All right.

— pictures or books in the future.

How

can you determine the question of their obscenity?
MRo ZWIENER:

Well, I would say that wa are not

entitled to even seek injunction unless -—
QUESTION:

My question was simply:

What do you

mean when you say the question of obscenity is considered?
MRp ZWIENER:

All right.

future use of the premises, again we

Well, then as far as the
the injunction does

.13

recite the specific, or should recite the specific sexual acts
that are prohibited and enjoined; and that those sexual acts QUESTION:

I thought we are talking about books or

movies.
MR. ZWIENER:
QUESTION:

We are.

And not conduct.

MRo ZWIENER:

No, sir.

And those sexual matters

must be taken in the light of Miller.
Nowi let us suppose an injunction issues under
those circumstances.

A temporary injunction is appealed in

Texas and, by the sayt, in Texas as in the Federal courts
the hearing on the temporary injunction is usually the trial.
And very often, probably more often than not, attorneys agree
that the temporary injunction and the permanent injunction
hearing will be held at the same.time.

So the evidence is

presented there and for all practical purposes that is the
end of the case, because avcsrybody has put on just about every
thing he has at that point.
A temporary injunction is appealable in Texas, it
is an expedited appeal, the record must be filed in 20 days,
and the f court can consider it even without briefs in order to
expedite consideration on appeal.

So this kind of injunction

does have that protection in expedited appeal.
But here is where we come to, I guess to me, the
proposition that makes me wonder why we have come all this

14

way a except it is a matter of principle, and I shouldn’t have
said what I said.

I think this is important.

But in Texas tfhea there is a contempt hearing
all right, we have an injunction against some premises
enjoining the showing of obscene movies.
saying that injunction has been violated.

A complaint is filed
The complainant,

who ordinarily would be the county or district attorney, must
come into court and prove that the injunction has been violated,
which means for any move to be shown or any book to be displayed
in a book store he has got. to go through the same type of
proof that he would if he defiled a criminal obscenity case.
QUESTION;

Well, it is part of the burden of proof.

MR, 2WISNER:

All right, the burden of proof

probably in getting the injunction in Texas at this time would
be preponderance of evidence.
QUESTION;

No, I am not —

MR, ZWISNER:
QUESTION;

I would say —•

As far as the burden of proof on the

issue is whether the injunction has been broken.
MR.o ZWISNER;

All right, I think in that situation

probably the test is a clear and convincing test.
QUESTION:

Not beyond a reasonable doubt.

MR, ZWIENBR:
QUESTION;

Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
gQ in that respect, if no other, it

differs from a criminal trialj right?

15

sRo ZWIENER:
QUESTION;

That is true, sir.

You mean you are trying criminal intent?

MR„ ZWIENER;

Well, I mean if you issue this

complaint — say there has been an outstanding injunction and
there is a claim it has been violated, then you issue a complaint.
And is this for a civil or a crirainal contempt?
QUESTION:

Well, I would sa.y it is civil.

But I

cannot tell precisely.
MRo ZWIENER;

If it is civil of course there may not

be -«■
QUESTION:

Well, I postulate

the reason I said

what I did is because the burden of proof has changed in Texas
in the commitment of the mentally persons and — well, I
don’t think that is involved here, but

But you don’t suggest that Texas is

jail on proof; less than beyond reasonable doubt?
QUESTION:- He just did.
QUESTION:

*

Well, he didn't; he said he didn't knot

whether it was civil or criminal.
MRo ZWIENER:

I take that from the law of Texas.

16

My guess is a Texas court would hold in this kind of situation,
since a jail term is involved, again looking to the cases
where persons have been committed to mental institutions, that
probably a Texas court in all fairness will use the clear
and convincing test.
QUESTION:

Would the defendant have a right if he

Yes.

MRo ZWIENER:

-- the courts of Texas have never told

me what criminal and civil contempt is, I don’t know what the

If I could have,it would have been in a brief.
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Mr. Zwiener, in any event, whatever the

proceeding is, civil or cirainal, he would get a jail term?
MRo ZWIENER:

He could be confined to jail until

he purges himself.
QUESTION:

How much of a jail sentence?

MRo ZWIENER:

Until he purges himself.

That is

permissible.
There is also a statute that sets a fine.
QUESTION:
himself?

If he has violated, how does he purge

HR o ZWIENER:

He purges himself by not showing this

particular movie or taking that particular magazine off the
shelf.
QUESTION:

Well, that is not like civil contempt.

QUESTION:

you, in effect, hold the key to the jail-

MR a ZWIENER:
QUESTION:

Right.

Yes, but he already has by definition

according to the State violated the injunction.

How can he un-

ring a bell; how can he purge himself?
MRo ZWIENER:

He hasn't violated an injunction un:ii

it is proved that he has shown an obscene movie, that is true,
and that —
QUEST 10::.':

So that the trial, the issue on whether

he has committed contempt would be determined by deciding whether
he has shown an obscene movie.

I am not sure there is any difference.

That is

the best I could do.
QUESTION:

Well, what if someone is convicted for

second degree murder in Texas and let's assume the statute
permits the imposition by the jury of 20 years.

Now, does the

standard of proof for conviction of a clearly defined crime
in Texas require that it be beyond a reasonable doubt?
MR o ZWIENERs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

General Zwiener, I know there are a. lot

of unanswered questions, how this statute will be construed.
But am' I correct in assuming this much:

that in determining

whether there is a nuisance under this statute, the sole inquiry of
the Court would be as to the content of the motion pictures or
books alleged to be obscene and there would be no consideration
of the character of the neighborhood or the location of the
theater, or anything like that?
MR„ ZWIENER:
correct.

.

t

That is correct, Sir.

That is

.. **

What we are saying, that 4667 imposes no more
burden, threat to free speech than does a penal statute.
I think that is the bottom line.
)

I do invite the Court to the brief filed by amicus
Charles Keating in which he argues that under general common-”
wealth principles 4666 is -- would be constitutional and he

19

cites Art Theaters Guild v. Evring -- I believe it is an
Ohio case -- cited in his brief as authority for this Court's
approval of a closure statute.

And as I would have closed,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with Moore v. Simms but
QUESTION:

--

I would say I have sent for Mcore v.

S'

Simms, and I was too critical of your analysis of it.

There

was a good deal of reference in it to the Pullman abstention
doctrine.

And I think I owe ay apology to you for that.
MR, 2WIENER:

Well, thank you. Your Honor.

But I do think that if Moore v. Simms does not
extend Pullman to this type of situation, that this Court
should c.ive consideration where there is a State statute that
is capable of constitutional construction by the State
courts, that an extention of Pullman would seem dictated,
or at least desirable.

It would save the time of the Federal

courts j it would give the State courts a chance to construe
their own statutes, and the Texas courts have accepted the
invitation of this Court in Miller to construe the statutes
in conformity with this Court's opinion.
Thank you.

Mr. Gravies.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRIERSON

GRAVES > JR., ESQ ,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MRo GRAVES:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

20

Mr. Zwiener mentions prior restraint.

I would like

to state to the Coxirt some reasons why I believe this statute
shows that it is an impermissible prior restraint.
QUESTION:

Well, why is this a prior' restraint?

Is it. your contention that the issuance of the injunction or
the passage of the statute is a prior restraint?
MR. GRAVES:

The issuance of the injunction against

unnamed future films which subject the motion picture operator
or otherwise to the various types of either somebody looking
over his shoulders, the judge acting as the censor, the
unlimited discretion of the trial judge in issuing that
injunction, the broad language that is permissible in the
injunction, it is doing for the future what Near v. Minnesota
applied to a newspaper say shouldn't be done.

And now they

are attempting to expand that to say because there has been
shown an obscene motion picture and we come in and get a single
judge or. a preponderance of the proof to issue an injunction
and the judge therefore sets out the broad language of what
he might consider to be obscene in the future, that it becomes
a prior restraint because we have that facing ~QUESTION:

field, because —
QUESTION:

Eyen though from time to time opinions

of various courts have suggested that is the way -- that was th
best way to deal with obscenity.
HR. GRAVES:

lour Honor, the -- the only limited

exception that I believe this Court has really looked at is the
model statute in Kingsley Books v. Brown in which there was
r

a movie brought before

or a book brought before the Court.

That particular book was enjoined and then if there was any
violation in the future, then the person could be punished.
And even in that decision the Court said, well, it is possible
that even while we are waiting to try the obscenity finally
on the merits, New York might not even punish for contempt if
they continued the sale of the book during that period of
time.
But to extend this doctrine — and I know the Court
has said maybe the best possible notice of whether or not a
motion picture is obscene would be to have a civil injunction
against It and then if there was a further exhibition of the
motion picture you would know --QUESTION:

That would be a particular motion

What is defined in the code is sexual inter*

the injunction says or you are permanently enjoined from showing
any motion pictures or iaaga sines or selling those or other
materials which contain representations or descriptions of
ultimate sax acts, normal or perverted,actual or simulated.
So yea have an injunction that the court says that you have
a description in the book of a simulated sex act or if you
have a description or depiction in a movie, then if it violates
the tern of the obscenity law you can be punished for contempt

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

The criminal laws.

I'Vl

MR. GRAVES:

The criminal law.

But when you have

an injunction that says not only will we determine whether you
have violated the injunction but we will also subject you to
air months in jail, which is the penalty in Texas for criminal
contempt, that is it.

But you don't have what you are entitled

to in a criminal trial.

It hasn't gone through the hands of

a criminal complaint, a grand jury proceeding.

All your

protection that you have, and what you have in this statute
which is beyond the criminal, is that this statute allows a
private individual without injury to bring the suit for
injunction.
QUESTION:

Well, you say the nuisance route that

has been occasionally referred to in opinions of this Court is
than actually a worse one from the point of view of the
defendant than an outright criminal prosecution under an
obscenity statute, since the defendant in the nuisance routs
doesn't have the safeguards of the criminal procedure.
MRo GRAVES:

No, sir, I■am not saying that for a

24

civil injunction against the showing of a particular movie
in existence which is brought before the court and there is
no dissent or hearing on that raovie and if there is an
*

injunction on it, then only in the future if you disobey that
injunction by showing that particular movie.

But tvhen you

have here an injunction that says just as the criminal statute,
if you happen to show any particular material that has a
simulated setback in it, you can be brought back before the
court for a contempt action, then that is going beyond whac is
the limited exception that you have looked at for civil
injunctions in Kingsley Books v. Brown or the other model.

Yes, sir.
A specific, identified name.
That is right.

This is against

unidentified, unnamed films that — or magazines or books
that are not even in existence.
QUESTION;

Isn't it true thought before you can be

held in contempt that a move that it is claimed violates the
injunction would have to be found to be obscene?
MR, GRAVES:

Not necessarily so, sir.

And I say

this because —
QUESTION:

with you on that — let’s assume that you are wrong on that and
that before you could be held in contempt you have to have the

same kind of finding you would have to have under the statute,
the same kind of determination of obscenity that you would
have to have under the statute.
HS, GRAVES:

Hould you still -~

You would have if they were trying the

to produce the movie -- if the court said, I issue a show cause
order, yon are arrested, under the procedures admissible in
?esas you are arrested, and not just a citation for show cause,
you are put in jail, you are brought into court and you fail
to produce the motion picture.

And the court says, bring

QUESTION:

Let us assume he does have regular film

and there is no issue like that in the contempt proceeding.
Before he can be held in contempt, there will have to be a
determination of obscenity of the film that he has shown.

You would have to be, but you are not

entitled to all the procedures you would be if you were a
criminal trial.

QUESTION:
MRo GRAVES:

;

;

GRAVES: ; Your Honor, in the Richards case and

■
•i
i

‘i

A

Am I right?
You are right, sir, because the State

of Texas, while they did, the injunction says though, taken as
waoj.s, but -the

Locke v. State and the Richards case says

27

fco state that sexual intercourse and offend, that is obviously
obscene.
QUESTION:

Even though it is just an isolated

incident.
MR. GRAVES:

Even though it is an isolated incident.

And, Your Honor, that is the problem,that it can go beyond to
do this, the fact of what is done.

There is an appeal now

in the Fifth Circuit of a civil injunction against an issue
of Penthouse Magazine.

You will find that when a private

citizen can bring an injunction suit to get to say that this
particular magazine is obscene, find a judge that can do it,
there is a broad general injunction for every unnamed future
publication.

And petition after petition can be brought and

it will get the courts into what this Court didn’t want to be,
as a nation-wid© censor» in that the judge becomes just like
the administrative censor.
In fact, in the Locke v. Stata case, where there
was another problem, which was an agreed order of procedure and
the agreed order of procedure was that if a motel operator had
a film that he wanted to show and thought it was a borderline,
he would take it down to the court and ask for a ruling, or
risk contempt.

And when you have got that, then the Judge could

be faced with magazines', motion picture films, books, anything
like that.

And we are not talking about jusu explicit

sexual movies, we are — you might even be re-litigating Lady

23

Chatterly’s Lover, because that has descriptions of it, as
opposed to that, while that might have serious valiae, you
would say, well, something that goes along with The Happy
riboker, then that has the description of it and some book­
store say3, I don’t want to do that because I may be facing an
original injunction.

And then I have the duty to look into

each and every book that I want.
How, we always know that there are some people that
are going to take the chance that they are not going to be
caught, they are not going to be prosecuted, they are not
otherxfiss do it, and they are going to take that chance under
the criminal law.

And when we have always thought that in

the First Amendment that it is either that -- in crimes that
you look at both either punishment or education to determine
whether or not you would do this.

And that the First

Amendment you are entitled to a broad protection on prior
restraint.

And that was the purpose of it, to stop it.

Let the man have the subsequent punishment.
Bow, this contempt action is not just subsequent
punishment.

Mot only don't you have all of the things of

criminal procedures, but you can say a petition is brought that
a man showed-the motion picture a month ago and now he is
charged with contempt.

It is ridiculous to say that every

action will always be civil contempt, and I have the keys to
the jail because I stopped showing the motion picture.

It has

23

been shown a month ago.
QUESTIOJJ':

We 1X ; what if following the Heller

approach that this Court decided along with the Miller case,
I)

a lav? enforcement officer goes, views a film, files an affidavit,
presents it to a magistrate and the magistrate issues a search
warrant for the seizure of the -- of one copy of the film.

..

injunction against

and.you if you go out to show me a show cause order, under

Heller, X continue even with the criminal charge to show the
motion picture because I believe ghe jury will find me not

i

33

guilty.

Under this case, if I continue to show the motion

picture the Judge can say, I told you, you are under an
injunction and you are both civil and criminal because it is
past actions of showing it and in the future you can't show
this unnamed picture now identified any more.

So you have

gone even beyond Heller by saying not only you seise the film
but you have that particular injunction.

I just believe that

when we are talking about the First Amendment and the idea
that the First Amendment's chief purpose is to not have a
prior restraint and that

you would try to say that you

wouldn't, that the least tolerated and the most seriotis type
of provision under the First Amendment is to try to identify
this in the past.

The contempt, the injunction, becomes just

the same thing as a criminal statute.

It is sitting there but

you have that official sanction of someone looking over your
particular\shoulder every time, with that particular judge
being % censor, for something that is so loose in identification,
because

jo

still have in Smith v. U.S., we still said it was

a real' fact question as. to whether or not the material appealed
to the parient interest or was faintly offensive according to
contemporary standards of the community.
QUESTION:

You have something looking over your

shoulder under a perfectly valid statute, under Paris: Adult
Theater in Miller, depending upon whether a jury were to define
whether or not it met the test laid down by that statute, don't

31

you?

,
MR', GRAVES:

Yes, sir, but you hava the normal

checks and balance of a government as to xvhethar or not there
will be a criminal indictment or a possible grand jury hearing
on it, because there are other criminal procedures to you,
as opposed to the fact that just like in McKinney v. Alabama
some people* won’t want to challenge the fact when they have an.
injunction, whereas if they are distributing a magazine or a
book or a motion picture which has some isolated incident
of sex act. in it, are they going to say that this freezes, it
doesn \‘fc just chill, it freezes, the provisions and becomes what
i believe is an impermissible prior restraint in that, action,

sir.
The contempt? action,' this also is really self/

censorship? because the person must look at esch and everything
when kb Is under an injunction.

In a criminal prosecution if

a bookstore operator receives a book, a written book, and he
doesn’t read it completely and he is not in the adult business
where he » screens

QUESTION:

What about the proprietor of an adult

film theater which shows sexually explicit film?

32

MEo GRAVESs

This particular case, Your Honor,

involved the original case, Universal Theater Amusements v.
Vanca-involvsd Deep Throat.

It was tried twice in Houston,

Texas, there, mis-fcri&ls both times.
