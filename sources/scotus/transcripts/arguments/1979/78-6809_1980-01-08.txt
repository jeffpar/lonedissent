ORAL ARGUMENT OF
CARL ZIEMBA, ESQ* f
. On behalf of the Petitioner
ROBERT A.
On behalf of -the Respondent

HR. CHIE? JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in the Jenkins v. Anderson.
Hr. Ziemba.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL ZIEMBA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ZIEMBA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
If there is one major shortcoming in the administratio)
of criminal law in this country it is in the restricted
interpretation given to the concept of the presumption of
innocence.

In my years at the criminal trial bar I have so

often heard trial judges instruct the jury the defendant is
presumed to be innocent and that the presumption starts at the
beginning of the case and continues on until his guilt is proven
beyond reasonable doubt.

I think that that is a misleading, x£

not mistaken, notion of the presumption of innocence.
I think that we are all as members of this society
presumed to be innocent of the commission of crime.
QUESTION;

Wouldn!t you say that Bell v. Wolfish

last year that the presumption of innocence was something a
word of art peculiar to criminal trials?
MR. ZIEMBA:

Yes, but I think that that is a

restricted concept of if.
QUESTION;

You disagree with ****

4
HR. SIEMrAs

I agree with the Court’s declaration so

far as the Court went»

But X would say that the reason why

a police officer has to have probable cause to believe that
somebody has committed a felony or to see the person commit a
misdemeanor in his presence before he can lay hold of him is
because that person is presumed to be innocent of the commission
of crime»
I think that the very genious of our system of
criminal jurisprudence starts with the presumption of innocence
which invests every member of our society and it must folios';'
from that in our system of jurisprudence, criminal jurisprudence
that if a person is presumed innocent he cannot be burdened
with the duty of proving his innocence»

And therefore if the

State accuses a person of crime the State has the burden of
proving that crime»

And then of course they have evolved all

of the facets of the principle of the right of nonincrimination
investing every individual, which moans to say that if the
State chooses to charge a parson with crime the State has the
burden of proving that charge beyond a reasonable doubt without
any assistance at all from the defendant»

And there is no

burden upon the defendant to make an explanation or to make
exonerating statements»
QUESTION:

Well, the defendant can be called before a

grand jury and required to give blood samples, handwriting
analysis, and that sort of thing; can he not?

3

MR. ZIEMBA:

That is true, hut we have said that
i

that is not testimonial in nature, have we not.
QUESTION s

Yes, but I take it the State wouldn’t do

it if it didn’t f

It was helping prove its case.

MR. ZIEMBA:

Well, I suppose not.

Of course that is

not to say that X am in absolute agreement with the concept
that giving blood samples and things of this nature is not
compelling a person to give evidence against himself.

But of

course I am in the minority on that point of view.
But we do recognize the fundamental principle that
when one is hailed into court and put on trial and all of the
State's evidence marshaled against him is presented in court he
still has the right to remain silent.

And nobody can comment

upon that, upon the fact that he did. remain silent.
QUESTION?

But once ha takes the stand in his own

behalf the situation undergoes some change, doesn’t it?
MS, ZIEMBAs

Yes, it does; but we cannot -■» we cannot

punish a person for exercising a constitutional right simply
because he exercises another right, and that is the right to
give evidence under the Sixth Amendment,
we have

in other words, here

we have the potential of a person reading in the

newspaper that the authorities suspect ;h'im of. the commission of
some crime though there is no formal charge made against him
but still it is brought about that X has done so and so.

Now,

X must decide instantaneously fen before any charge is formally

6
filed against him whether he is going t
if it should ever come to that, you see.

in .
Because if he intends

to testify in his trial he had better come out with an
explanation in the face of there rumors and the stories in -the
newspapers now.

Otherwise, he is going to be damned on trial

by his pre-trial silence in the face of these accusations.
I do not think that supports our basic tenets and
principles of fairness and justice.
Mow, if it is true that it is true that a person
who is stopped on a street by a police officer and is asked
questions about the commission of some crime has a perfect right
not to answer the police officer, then how can we say that any
duty devolves upon that person when he hears that he might be
charged with crime or that he is suspected of a commission of
crime has a duty to seek out the police, go down to the police
station, stop the police of:

t ie street in a scout

car and says

You have got to go along®

“One moment, please.

1 acted in self defense.

Or, aIfc was an accident,” or '

KI wasn't there," or whatever the case might be.
\

Yes.
QUESTION:

lid the lo-rzr court held there was a duty

on the-part of the defendant to do any of these things?
MR. ZIEMBA:
QUESTIONs

No, but 1 think it is
That the failure to do them if brought out

on cross-examination' may undermine his credibility.

duty,
QUESTION:

Not necessarily*

1 think he could

have said and the trial judge could have told the jury he had
no duty to go in and talk,-. and you should decide) for yourselves
whether there is any inconsistency between

I don't understand

why you necessarily say there was a duty*
The question is one of credibility ultimately, isn't
it?
It-u ZiEMBAs

But isn't it a matter of credibility if

a person is subpoenaed before a grand jury and he claims his
right under the Fifth?
QUESTION:

Well, that is right but he wasn't

summoned before the police and didn't assert any such right*
He just didn’t volunteer to go to the police*
MR* ZIEMBA:

I. think it is an awfully strange
»

*

doctrine that says that if a person is hailed before a grand
jury he may exercise with impunity Lis Fifth Amendment right’’
\;o remain silent.. If he is hailed before Congress or any
investigatory body and he is propounded questions, he may
exercise the Fifth Amendment to remain silent.

'If he is

placed under arrest whether ha is given his warnings or not he
has the absolute right to refuse to answer questions.

If he

xs stopped on the street he has the absolute-, right under, the
Fifth Amendment not to answer any questions*

And still we say

a
•that if a person is sitting in his living room and he hears on
television that he has been acjused of crime, that there is a
warrant out for his arrest, before he is arrested he must
answer the telephone, go down to the police station and. moke
protestations of innocencee
QUESTION:

Bo you suggest as a — well, you certainly

don’t suggest as a general rule of evidence that silence is
irrelevant.

Let us assume this is a civil case and in the face

of accusations you remain silent.

I thought the' normal pule of

evidence was -that silence is a very relevant factor»

And the

only reason that silence isn’t in criminal cases is gust to the
extent the Fifth Amendment forbids it, wouldn’t you say?
MR. ZIEMBA:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Well, isn’t silence in civil cases n

perfectly relevant matter to be brought out?
MR. ZIEMBA:
QUESTION:

In civil cases we are dealing with —
Well, I know b\it 'that isn’t because there

is any duty of anybody to talkv but it is because it is relevant
as Justice Stevens suggests.•
MR. ZIEMBAs

But in civil cases we are dealing'with

such inconsequential things as money and ~~
QUESTION:

But the only reason it is different in

criminal cases is because of the Fifth Amendment, it isn’t
because it is irrelevant or not meaningful, it is just —*

9

MR. ZXEMBMs
QUESTIONs

Well, that xaay be Mr. Justice -~
But isn't your argument -chough that the

Fifth Amendment forbids this; isn't that the amendment of your
argument?
MR. ZIEMBA:

Right.

And further that the Fifth

Amendment extends out into the community in all circumstances.
‘QUESTIONs

Well, Mr. Ziemba, to take the last

hypothesis that you proposed of someone sitting in his living
room and hearing a radio broadcast that there had .been a crime
committed and perhaps he was a suspect and he was ultimately
indicted and tried, took the stand and the prosecutor sought
to impeach him because he had failed to rush down to the police
Station and give his version.
Don't you. think the Supreme Court of Michigan would
have decided this question on a non-constitutional ground just
that it is not relevant it doesn't impeach the man's credibility
. for him to have failed to rush down to the police station?
MR. ZIEMBA;

X think that the Supreme Court of the

State of Michigan would probably decide the case on the face —
on the basis of People v. Bobo cited on page 26 of the Petitioner*
brief where the court said;
"Whether his {defendant's) silence was prior to or
at the time of arrest makes little difference —* the defendant's
Fifth Amendment right to remain silent is constant.H
”If silence in 'die face of specific accusation

10
’may not be used'

(against a defendant)., it would fcc a. strange

doctrine indeed that would permit silence absent such an
.
accusation to be used as evidence, of guilt»81
QUESTIOH:

Wall, why did the ~~ your client have to

go to 'the Federal courts to get relief here if the. Sup re ns
Court of Michigan feels that way?
MR.ZIEMBA:

Mr» Justice White, 1 keep asking that

question time and time again»

My practice in the state of

Michigan is almost exclusively criminal work and I cannot
answer these questions, why in a certain case the court will
invoke the Constitution'of the United States and of the State
or Michigan and reverse a conviction; and in other cases *•*»
well,

X

can’t discern any fact the difference the court gives

me an unpublished opinion in which they say;
the record and find no error."

"We have examined

I have no explanation for it*

for that phenomenon; I am sorry.
But let us imagine two persons engaged in an
activity and the police surprise -them and one is seised and
the other runs and makes good his escape.

The one who is

seised is .immediately told by the police;

"Now, you have the

right under the Constitution not to say anything."
his Miranda rights.

He is given

And the second culprit has remained at

liberty for two weeks., he hasn’t come forth with any explanation
or he hasn’t stopped in a police office, he hasn’t gone into
any police station.

But'

\ sntually he

;aken into custody

11
and both placed on.trial,»

The chap who had the misfortune or.

good fortune to be arrested at the scene and given his Miranda
warnings, he can risk complete impunity

,

take the witness stand

and give exculpatory evidence without being damned for erercdsin
his right to silence»
The fellow who was at liberty for -two weeks, ha gats
on the stand and he is impeached, he is shown to be lying on
trial because he .remained silent in those two weeks he is at
liberty «—
QUESTION;

It is a little more than that, isn't it,

counsel; he just didn't remain silent, he fled from the scene
of a homicide situation
MR, ZIEMBA:
QUESTION: ■

- a man was stabbed to death»

_.

■

MR* ZIEMBA:
for two weekso

Yes,

i

The man remained without .communication

That kind of silence is a little different

from just remaining silent after you have got a Miranda warning,
isn’t it?
MR. ZIEMBA:
QUESTION;

I am not sure. Your Honor.

You make so much importance, you have

devoted 10 minutes or 12 minutes to*

Did trial counsel- make ah

objection at the time this issue arose in the trial court?
MR» ZIEMBA:
QUESTION:
MR. ZIEMBA:

No, he did not.
Was it raised in the first appeal?
In the — petitioner here had court-

12
appointed - counsel on his appeal as a right to the Michigan
Court of Appeals.

And the specific issue before the Court

today was not raised to the Michigan Court of Appeals in
appointed counsel’s brief»
You see we have in the State of Michigan a procedural
device available to the prosecution wherein the prosecution
can file a motion to affirm the conviction on the basis that
the issues raised by the appellant are so unsubstantial as not
to need any form of submission in argument»

And if the court

agrees with the prosecutor an order affirming the conviction
might enter.

And that was done in this case, the Court of

Appeals of Michigan entered an order affirming the conviction
on the basis of a motion to affirm by the prosecutor.

Then

the petitioner here being dissatisfied with his appointed
t£2ounsel0s brief, filed a motion for reconsideration -- an
application for reconsideration to the Michigan Court of
Appeals within the time allotted by the rules.

And he raised

this specific issue and the- application for reconsideration was
denied.
The petitioner then proceeded pro se to make
application to the Michigan Supreme Court in a discretionary
appeal and he presented this issue before the court, among
others, to the Michigan Court -- Michigan Suprema Court.

And

the Michigan Supreme Court denied leave to appeal, stating
that they are not persuaded that the questions should be review

13
ad by that court«
How, I might point this out: that the. State of
Michigan neither in the Court of Appeals nor in the Michigan
Supreme Court nor in the Federal District Court on the petition
for writ of habeus corpus nor on the appeal to the Circuit
Court of Appeals

for the Sixth Circuit raised the issue that

there was failure to make a contemporaneous objection at-trial*
In other words, that issue has never been raised in this case
until it has corns here under petition for certiorari.,

And

I -think that if the defendant is chargeable for neglecting to
object on the ~~ on trial, the State of Michigan is chargeable
for not. raising that objection any place during the appellate
procedures and processes until it has come before this
Court»
And X might point this out further, Your Honor, that
in the State of Michigan we do have a plain error doctrine and
it is invoked most frequently when constitutional rights are
involved*

So the Michigan’. Court of Appeals and/or the Michigan

Supreme Court could have -*'•» could have entertained this
question and reversed the conviction even in the absence of
an objection by the petitioner at the trial level*
QUESTION:
MR. ZXEMBA:

But they didn't*
They did not? no.
iould not be

considered to be an issue.before this Court*

How, Your Honor, 1

that any kind of a killing of an individual must .be an emotional 1’

And 1 know this from my practice in the

anxious to fall into the hands of the police officer®
going to be frightened*

He is

It is a natural reaction for any

individual.
QUESTION?

Maybe, a white person would be?

HR* ZIEMBA:

Well, I don’t know that that would be

the case, Mr* Justice*

Here wa have a black petitioner.

He

He was so frightened of the

police that before he turned himself in he made arrangements
with the black mayor of the city of Detroit to surrender him­
self through the mayor's office because he was afraid*
QUESTION;

Did-he have a prior criminal record?

MR, ZIEMBA:

I am not sure*

He — he might have had,

Your Honor? not a serious one*
QUESTIONj

Well, there is some »-

MR. ZIEMBA:

tie had no

no, no, in point of fact

I recall, Your Honor, .he gave the explanation that he was -that he was in addition fearful that because he had been placer
on probation just recently by one of the judges of the court
of the city of Detroit*

So, he did have ~~ he did have a prior

But -of course
QUESTION: ■ He was not wholly m fetal liar with the

MR. ZIEH&h:

processes.

So that-.the —» the jury in this case in point of

fact the petitioner was tried with murder of the first degree.
The jury took, four and a half days

four and a half days to

come back with a verdict of manslaughter.

In the Stats of

Michigan we have murder of the’-first degree, second degree and
then voluntary manslaughter.
Mow*,, it was the defendant's testimony which was
crucial to this case.

He asserted a defense of self defense.

He said that he stabbed in self defense.

Now, if.his

his imps adunent by the prosecutor in the form that we find
in this case seriously'undermined his credibility in the eyes
of the -“'of the lay juries, and that is where the basic
unfairness and the violation of the Constitution principle is
involved.
Are there any further questions?

16

QUESTIOH:

I notice from the record that there

apparently was no objection to the prosecutor's references to
his ~~
HR. ZIEM3A:

There were no .objections to the .arq.fronts

of the prosecutor referring to the exercise by the petitioner
of his right to silence; there was not, Your Honor, no.
QUESTION;

But you say that this ~~ at least I got

the impression you said this case turned entirely on his
testimony.

The jury had the choice of believing eye- witnesses

brought by the prosecution and eye witnesses produced by the
defendants and these witnesses ware in complete conflict with
each other, ware they not, as to

who had the knife in 'the

first place?
HR. ZXEMBA:

Yes, I would say ->-* I would say that

was a fair representation, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION;

The jury verdict came down to whether

they were going to believe one set of witnesses or believe
another set of witnesses?
HR. ZIEMBA:

I think ™- well, no, I think -«'no,

my experience is that the jury wants to hear from the defendant,
what's his side of the story.

And it is very important I think

in a criminal case to put the defendant on the stand.

-If I

can possibly put a defendant on the stand I will put him on the
stand because the . the

the: -oh area a of relief without

giving the defendant the stand are materially reduced, you see.

17
How, the defendant rvrcs on the stand and he swears,
you see, that the deceased had the knife and that the deceased
was coming at the petitioner because the petitioner had report ad
>

-

i

that the deceased had committed this crime a few days earlier.
And that he wrestled with the petitioner and he turned ~~*
tussled and wrestled with the deceased and turned the knife of
the deceased on the deceased and stabbed him with his own knife,
you sea*
/

How, it is my impression -- it is my impression that that jurists come to jury service invested with the fo!
Wisdom»

For instance, you can stack the jury until the cows

come home, that a defendant need not prove his alibi.

That is

the law in the State of Michigan, that it is sufficient if the
evidence on alibi raises a reasonable doubt as to the presence
of the defendant of the scene of the crime that is committed®
But nonetheless it is a fact of jury trials that if the jury
believes that the alibi witnesses are lying, they will says
"Uh# he must be' guilty, because they are lying*" you see»

And

so they also come ~~ they also come to a jury trial with the
preconception that if a defendant has nothing to fear* he is
not guilty, why doesn’t he get up on that witness stand and
say so®

Why doesn’t he get up there and deny his gui.lt, you

see &
And then when, the defendant gets on the' witness
stand and the .prosecutor- says:

"You can’ t believe him, you

18

can’t believe him because
today is true he would have cone voluntarily into the poll
department soon after that onslaught as he possibly as he
possibly could get and explain; ’You have got it all wrong. I

position in the case.
You don’t rely at all, as I listened to your argument,

is correct but the Doyle case seems to say. that the police

All that Miranda says is, ’’Look, will

that he has a right to remain silent because otherwise he may
not know and he may ba frightened into making a statement,”
you see*
But if a person is taken into custody and he is a
constitutional scholar and he remains silent even and is not
given his Miranda rights, why do we shore him of his right to
remain silent, exercise his Fifth- Amendment rights?

It doesn’t

make any sense.

OPAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. DEREMGOSKI, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DERENGOSKX:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Bearing in mind that the most basic tenet of the
Fifth Amendment right to not incriminate yourself is compulsion,
the State of Michigan takes a position that in this cause
there is no Fifth Amendment violation,

This man was not

compelled to testify against himself»
The contention is that by exploring his flight and
concealment that his "silence” was infringed upon.

I have

difficulty in conceiving this voluntary flight and voluntary
concealment to be in the category of silence* certainly not
in a testimonial sense,

A man contends,that once be exercises

his Sixth Amendment right, takes -the stand with counsel at his
side and testifies and speaks of his absence, he brought it all
on* that we are barred from cross-examining on ’that issue»
Incidentally, of the 30 or more pages of the
testimony given by this man,' loss than a page I think «,« it is
less than a page in the appendix concerning the examination by
the prosecution on cross-examination of this flight and
concealment»

I doubt whether it had any serious impact upon

the jury at all®

In fact keep in mind that this man was charged

under Michigan law with first degree murder, conviction of
which requires mandatory life sentence»

But evidently this

story of an alibi — or s
impact upon the jury»

They cams in and found him guilty . of-

manslaughter, which is a 10- to 15-year sentence which he did
receive0
How, it is not Doyle case at all *

Doyle held that

because of the oppressive conditions of the police station and
♦

the features'thereof that once he was given his Miranda warning
and so forth that you couldn' t infringe upon -that and make
mention of that*
But here in this case he brought it up*

•■•here was

no compulsion, no Fifth Amendment problem involved.

This

Court way back many years ago r think in Raffel said that once
the accused takes the stand the prosecution has full sway in
the matter of issues pertinent to the cause and to cross-exarai
‘tine re on,
1 move along a bit .to perhaps a knottier problem
involved here, and in Doyle was a due process question.

The

4

question is whether ~~ did the probative value of examining
him on his escape and concealment* or flight and concealment,
did that outweigh the prejudice that was done to him.

I would

have to say wNo,a and I think the finding of a lesser — guilt
of a lesser offense definitely proves that.
r

Has there such a fundamental unfairness in his trial! .
I think not.

Oh, the prosecutor made the rather shall 1 say

tacky remark that perhaps during his flight and concealment he .

was lining up witnesses.

I think he also refor.red to that in

one sentence in his summation to the jury.

But you know that is

not all bad, it is a perfectly normal thing for a p .r.'-ion.
has explained ha was frightened.
for his flight and concealment.

ie

That is another explanation
And perhaps the jury did

believe him, that he was frightened and that is the reason why
he fled.
Mow, it would certainly ba a most normal thing
i

.

I would certainly not take exception to the claim that any
intelligent person running off like that would sure try and
line up

i wiiv.iCSSoa

That \ >ulc 1 a the 1 t II: Jr Sr thing

and not necessarily a meretricious act.

But to contend that

a person may be involved in a -felony and then go on, escape
for more than two weeks, conceal himself, come back and give
a self defense plea when his flight and concealment was
certainly inconsistent with such a plea,-to permit that I say
to the Court would certainly handcuff prosecuting authorities
throughout: this country in many * many cases.
/

QUESTIONS

Well, whether.it was inconsistent with his

plea or not was a matter for tLo jury to decide.
MR. DEBENGOSKI:

Yes, sir, and they made their

selection.
QUESTION:

and you suggest that they -vers influenced

to the extent- that they re da cat this by too grader, from first,
degree murder down, to manslaughter.

ISE* DERkitOSEI;

QUESTIO:!:

Yest sir

I see*

HR. DERENGOSKI:

2 say with the acceptance, of a theory

such as that and making it part of the law of this Nation, I
say the hanS
occur.

I can foresee where all you have to do is skip. out,,

stay concealed, take the stan

'

slf-defense

witnesses and you could not be —
QUESTION j

Do you think that a man charged with a

crime is obliged to give himself up?
MR, DERENGOSKI:

Oh, no, sir, I don’t think there is

any constitutional duty of that, sir.
QUESTION;

I thought that is what you were saying»

MR. DERENGOSKI:
QUESTION:

I do not.

No, sir.

I misunderstood you.

MR. DERENGOSKI ;

I am sorry. •

No, I say that we have the right

once he takes the stand to attempt to cast doubt upon his selfdefense plea and his escape and concealment is certainly an
act inconsistent

and that has been generally held — with

a plea, of self defense.
Unless the Court has any questions, I conclude.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Thank you gentlemen« the case is submitted.
