Commission of New York.
Taylor, 1 think you may proceed whenever you
are ready now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP TELFORD TAYLOR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR, TAYLOR:

Mr, Chief Justice, and nay it please

the Court:

This case also involves an order of the Public
Service Commission, it is in our brief on page 3» and is
mercifully short:

"All electric corporations are hereby

prohibited from promoting the use of electricity through
the use of advertising..."
I think the Court will readily see that the
constitutional questions raised here are distinct from
those in the case that has Just been heard.

The bill

insert ban closes a particular channel to speech on
public issues; this is a complete ban on speech described
as promotional advertising.

That, of course, falls within

the general category of speech.

That in the decisions ©::

this Court has been called commercial speech, but I think
It will appear In the course of the discussion that the
line here between commercial speech and other speech is

not as clear as it has been in some of the other cases in
this Court.
Now, I think I should say a word about the
genesis of this order- because it is different from the
chronology of the bill insert case.

The ban there in the

same language as on page 3 was enunciated by the commis­
sion i i & summary emergency fashion in December of 1973
at the time of the Arab oil boycott following the ArabIsraeli war, at a time when there was a genuine and
acknowledged belief of a shortage of oil which might not
enable the utilities to continue service, and it was put
in on that basis at that time, together with an order for
voltage reduction.

Months passed, the shortage eased

-and the voltage restriction was restored, but the pro­
motional ban was retained in effect.
In 19"6, the commission inaugurated a proceed­
ing to review whether the promotional bail should be con­
tinued.

Central Hudson and other companies urged that it

should be lifted.

We urged that unsuccessfully, and

after losing before the commission and rehearing denied,
this litigation was commenced in the New York state courts
arid, of course, therefore is here on appeal on federal
constitutional grounds.
I might also Just mention to the Court that a
brief has been filed here in amicus on behalf of the Long

5
Island Lighting Company.

That was a litigation started in

the federal courts, in the Eastern District of New York,
in which Judge Pratt ruled that this promotional ban was
indeed unconstitutional under the First Amendment but up­
held the bill insert ban.

That case Is pending and has

been argued in the Second Circuit but has not been decided.
Mow, before 1 come to the two matters that I
think are very basic here, I would like to mention three
things which either are or should be uncontroverted and
which I think msy clear up a couple of things and avoid
the necessity for colloquy»
In the first place, in this case there is no
question about who pays for promotional advertising.
There is federal legislation declaring federal standards
which require that promotional advertising be paid for
by the shareholders and not the rate payers.

The commis­

sionis own view is to the same effect and therefore we do
not have here ary question about the source of funds for
promotional advertising.

The owners of the company bear

it.
QUESTION:

World this bar, Mr, Taylor, ads in

the form of esss.ys, as is sometimes done, promoting the
more efficient use of electrical energy?
MR. T/YLOR:

Yes.

The ban is phrased in terms

not of consumption of oil or energy resource but the

6
amount of electricity and therefore if we urge by the use
of an appliance or in any other way something which will
increase the use of electricity, even though it might be
a net saving of energy, it comes within the ban.

I will

be coming in more detail to that point in a few moments.
QUESTION:

But it wouldn’t ban advertising in

promoting the non-use of electricity —
MR. TAYLOR:
QUESTION:

No.
— If the advertising said turn out

your lights when there is nobody in the room.
MR. TAYLOR:

You’re quite right.

If the use

reduces the amount of electricity used, it is not: within
the ban.

The promotional ban is defined as anything which

might be expected to increase the use of electricity.
In the second place, neither the commission nor
'any other authority, state or federal, has done anything
which prohibits the underlying activity here, that is there
is no restriction on the distribution, sale and. use of
electricity«

It is perfectly lawful, and the coramission!s

brief said that they haven’t even tried to discourage the
use of electricity for heating and therefore it is beyond
argument I think that the effect of this ban is to with­
hold from the public information about an activity which
is perfectly lawful.
In the third place, although this ban in Its

7
origin in December of 1973 was based on an actual shortage
ox oil, that is not the case with the commission's de­
cision in 1977 which continues the ban*

There is nothing

in the record, there is nothing in my opponent's brief,
there is nothing which indicates any present or approximate
shortage of oil.

The conservation theory which has been

invoke! in support of the order is rather that there is a
continued dependence on foreign oil.

That is the conser­

vation factor which is primarily relied on in the commis­
sion's decision in the Court of Appeals and therefore, of
course, I will be addressing that value which is invoked
to support the ban I hope before I sit down.
QUESTION:

Mr. Taylor, supposing that a drug

manufacturer sent out; a letter saying ask your doctor to
prescribe morphine for your pain you have, now the pre­
scription of morphine is perfectly legal in most statess
but you do have to get it by prescription.

Would you say

that that was a violation of the First Amendment?
MR, TAYLOR:

Well, if it was encouraging him te

get it without a prescription, it would, of course, be
advocating unlawful conduct and I suppose it would fall
within the tradition?,?, category of speech which can be
limited.

But the point of my making lay so-called point

two there was precisely that:

There is nothing unlawful

about the use of the electricity, the sale or the

8
distribution and indeed —
QUESTION:

But; my hypothesis simply says the

drug company 3ends to the occupant of every house "ask
your doctor to prescribe morphine" .

MR. TAYLOR;
QUESTION:

Well* that —
— so it would be in compliance with,

state law —

MR. TAYLOR:

That is encouraging the use of

what are called controlled substances, well 'mown to be
dangerous„

It is very much like, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

I take it the tobacco ban on advertising tobacco which is
lawful to smoke, which lour Honors did uphold in the
tobacco case»

Of course, the nature of using morphine

and the nature of using electric heating is different as
night from day In terms of general opinion about whether
this is good or bad.
May I come to the two points which seem to me
of the greatest importance here and which I chink go
further than anything else to show why the court below
and the commission have fallen into constitutional error
here*
In the Court of Appeals., these two things 1 am
about to mention led the court to say that Central Hudson's
First Amendment rights are in this case at the "nadir”
and having them put them in that low a state, of course,

9
it was unnecessary to scrutinise very carefully the value
factor invoked to support the ban because so low a cate­
gory Is placed on the speech itself.
Now, the most important point here I believe is
in our brief on page 15<>

We have quoted the governing

paragraph in the Court of Appeals decision which, as Your
Honors would see, treats this case as simply one where,
since we have a monopoly in the distribution of electric
energy and since the price is controlled by the — the
rates are controlled by the commission, that there can be
no value in discussion about the use of electricity.
Consumers have no choice regarding the source of their
electric power, the price of electricity simply may not
be reduced by competitive shopping.
Well, Your Honors, we say that that demonstrates
a very fundamental misconception about what the speech
Involved in this case is.

Of course, it is true that the

price of electric energy to the rate payer is regulated.
Of course, It is true that, as a substantial matter, our
company is the only source of it.

But it wholly overlooks

the fact that people don't take electric energy for its
1

own sake because it can be turned Into heat and light anet
power and to goods of that kind, and that in terms
i

especially of temperature control, of heating and cooling,
the companyfs share of this is not only not a monopoly.

10

It is very much a minority share „
QUESTION:

There is

I suppose if the state said we want

to cut down the use of energy in this state so we are
going to put a quota on what, the utilities may Sells we
are going so somehow say you can’t sell to any one customer
more taan a certain amount or you can’t sell any more then
you sold him last month or something like that,

I suppose

you would accept that as a
MR. TAYLOR:

Well, that question can’t be

answered fully without taking account both of statutory
matters which I don’t think are relevant here and con­
stitutional matters.

There would be statutory problems

about the commission’s authority to do that.

What you

suggest has been specifically authorised by statute in
the case of gas., but not in the case of electricity.
Now, if that —
QUESTION:
tion.

Let’s get past the statutory ques­

How about.the constitution —
MR. TAYLOR:

right away.

Yes, I was going to go past it

If the statutory question is resolved, why*

then, of course, there would, be no First Amendment problem.
There would stiLl be ~
QUESTION:
MR, TAYLOR:

Or any other problem?
Well, there would be a matter of

showing if there was a .reasonable basis for the restriction

11
and* of course* ordinarii;- the standards of review on that
are very relaxed.

If this were a prohibition which began

to impinge on existing service to customers and reduced
them to a bad circumstance in terns of heat* why, then,
you might well have a stricter standard of review to show
the necessity.
QUESTION:

But there wouldn*t be any consfeitu—

tional problem, would there*

assuming that the state

statute clearly authorised it, if the utilities commission
could say no electric utility in this state shall take on
any new customers for the next twelve months.
MR. TAYLOR:

If a satisfactory substance show­

ing could be made In support of that regulation, the
answer of course is they could do that* assuming the
statutory questions were cleared up* there would be no
First ibaendaent problem.
QUESTION:

'

Or no constitutional problem of any

kind* would there?
MR. TAYLOR:

If a satisfactory factual basis*

there are none.
QUESTION:
MR. TAYLOR:
QUESTION:
Mr. Taylor.

Right.
That’s right.
Well* let’s narrow that a little bit*

Suppose the notice was no utility shall here­

after cake on any new customers for heating* space heating

12
by electricity, any problem about that?
MR. TAYLOR:

Me different problem, Your Honor,

no.
QUEST:.ON:

You think it is no different from the

other?
MR. TAYLOR:

Mo, this would still be a restric­

tion on the activity itself, it would not raise a First
Amendment problem,
QUESTION:

But you nevertheless say that the

state may not achieve an equivalent or roughly the same
end by telling the company not to advertise the use of
electricity0
MR, TAYLOR:

Yes indeed because the situation

we have now is that the public or the consumer is entirely
free to use electric energy, the company is entirely free
to make it available, there are many alternative ways of
using it. some of which are more effective than others,
and —
QUESTION:

Yes, but the state has decided that

they have a very good reason for limiting the use of
electricity.

They considered' very heavily putting a quota

on or a limit or a ban of new customers, but they just
thought they would limit the* promotional activities of
the company If for no other reason to save the new
customers money., the company money and It wo aid have an

13
equivalent effec-to

But you think —

MR. TAYLOR:

I don't believe they can do that,,

Mr* Justice White, it seems to me because that rests on
achieving this consequence by keeping the public in ignox5-anee to matters they are entitled to know.

The option of

electric energy is not an offensive one or an unlawful ones
it is one which the commission has deliberately left open,
it has not found a basis for doing the rationing restric­
tion that you suppose and under those circumstances I think
they can’t say to speak put a slow brake on it by the device
of holding this Information from the public.
In alii the other commercial speech, cases ©f re­
cent vintage, there have been arguments made to show that
a policy might fee furthered but in those cases the balances
had to be weighed and the policy has been found insufficient
and it seeais to me that is the case hero, too.
QUESTION:

Are you going to get to Ohralik?

MR. TAYLOR:

Yes, I will.

Yes, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist.
Well, to complete my point there, sine© the
commission — the court, in other words, in this passage
on page 15, wholly mistook the nature of the- market which
is involved here.

The monopoly and the supply of electric

energy does: not mean at all that the company is not in
sharp competition with other energy sources.

Now, the

14
facts and circumstances about the relative merits of these
energy sources are matters of public interest.
cisely for that reason

It is pre­

that I said that in this case the

line between the commercial speech and the so-called con­
troversial speech Is a thin one because advertising which
would tell the consumer what the benefit of heat pumps are,
what the benefits and detriments of electric space heating
are is Information of public interest and of great interest
to the consumer. and therefor© the whole approach to the
advertising taken by the Court of Appeals was mistaken.
Now„ the other ~~
QUESTION:

Do you see any analogy, Mr. Taylor,

in a rationing program, rationing gasoline, for example,
with coupons?

Is this not an effort to equalize on the

part of the commission, to hold down consumption so there
will be enough to reach everybody?

la there any analogy

there?
MR. TAYLOR:
Justice.

It would seem to me not, Mr, Chief

In the first place, thia would bring me to the

fourth point in my brief, that if this were regarded as
an equalising measure, it is a strange one indeed because
7.5 percent or more of the heating is by home oil furnaces
and there is no restriction on. the advertising and pro­
motion of heat derived from that source.

It is limited to

the distributior, of electric energy and therefore far from

15
it being an equalising thing, it is a discriminatory thing
because only this one relatively small side of the energypicture is covereda

The other matter on which it seems to us the
Court of Appeals and the commission have been led astray
is because, in addition to the point I have Just discussed,,
they have relied here heavily on the thought that because?
Central Hudson is a regulated public utility., that by that
fact in and of itself our First Amendment rights are less.
I would have thought that the Belotti ease had
laid at rest that point of view.

Of course, I am aware

that that ease was decided by a closely decided Court, but
I don't think that the area of disagreement in the Belotti
case has much tc do with what is before the Court now.
In the Belotti case, the state value invoked to limit the
corporate speech was itself in the nature of a First
Amendment value, the idea of a prophylactic rule that
would prevent public discussion from being dominated by
corporate resources s and the Court had to strike a
• ■

v

balance between those and they disagreed on how to strike
the balance.
But m don’t have that situation here.

•'(
What is

being Invoked or. the other side her® is not of the same
character or stripe at all and therefore the considerations
in the Belotti case that led. to the division in the Court

16
don't seem to he of bearing here.

Certainly I think it

is clear in the Belottl case that both the majority and
minority thought that corporate entities do have the rights
of commercial speech and in the majority opinion the
standard to be used was exacting scrutiny, both of the
dissents recognized the seme thing, and indeed Mr. Justice
White!3 dissent strongly suggested that corporate rights
in the commercial area might well be greater than the po­
litical area because of the closer nexus with the corpora­
tion's own business.
In that connection, can I remark in conclusion
here on this aspect of the case that we have here none of
the factors which the Court has referred to in some of
these eases# the common sense differences between commer­
cial speech and other speech.

We have none of the factors

which the Court has mentioned as reasons for giving com­
mercial speech a lesser degree of protection.

This order

has nothing to do with whether speech is deceptive or
misleading or anything cf that kind.

It has nothing to

do with over receding solicitation# as in Ohr&llk.

There

are several cases, including Friedman v, Rogers» in which
the Court has tabulated these distinctive features of
commercial speech and none of them are present here and
therefore for all those reasons that I have now covered,
we strongly urge that the speech in this case is highly

17
akin to public Issue discussion;, that there :ls no reason
In this case why the saute standard should not be applied
to speech that was applied, in the Belotti case.
QUESTION:

Do you agree, Mr. Taylor, that If you
v

thought; the state was giving a compelling interest, was
using a compelling interest to justify this restriction,
that It would fee all right?

Or do you just say that you

just can’t do it?
MR. TAYLOR:

Of course not. Your Honor —• excuse

rae for putting it that way.

But I would suppose that in

any case if you come forward with a sufficiently compelling
reason, that the amendment gives way.
QUESTION:

Then suppose the state just out and

out says, well, we offer you a compelling interest, we
don’t know of any more compelling interest than to save
energy and we think this is an effective: way of saving
energy, is that — of course, you disagree that that would,
be a compelling interest, I suppose, or would you?
MR. TAYLOR:

We do not at all dispute the idea

that the conservation of energy is a great value.

Whether

the means you used here display a means calculated to seim
the compelling interest is another matter.

The point I

have been endeavoring to make so far, Mr. Justice White,
is

»
QUESTION:

Well, if you didn’t think your

18
advertising was effective, you wouldn^t really be worry™
ing very much, would you?
MR. TAYLOR:

Of coursee the advertising must be

effective -QUESTION:

You would it is effective or you

wouldn't be spending your money on It.
MR. TAYLOR:

Right.

The advertising which, as

our brief indicates, we desire to do, the advertising of
heat pumps, is rot the kind of advertising which will in­
crease the net consumption of energy.

And of course, one

of our complaints against the order is that In that sense
it is over-broad, and It is indeed the over-broad portion
which most directly affects us because there are electrical
devices, including the heat pump, now available which very
greatly diminishes the use ©f electrical energy and would
not increase the use of foreign oil.
QUESTION:

I take It you would be unsatisfied

if just the over-broad portions were clipped off of the
order?
MR. TAYLOR:

MR. TAYLOR:

Although over-breadth you think —

Hell, we believe the over-breadth

doctrine is available In this case because- it is not &
situation where we would come within the legitimate scope
ox the statute in s complaint that it might apply to some­
one else.

Indeed, here the over-breadth part is the part

that especially and immediately affects us.

But frankly,

In answer to your question, no, we would not be satisfied
because we believe that the order is invalid insofar as it
applies to resistance heating or other uses and for the

same —«•

energy, we think that is a compelling Interestthen what

QUESTION:

If we disagree with you on that „ you

lose?
MR. TAYLOR:
QUESTION:

Ho.
No?

MR. TAYLOR:

Because we still have the over­

breadth argument and we still have another argument which
in point three of our briefs which we think is equally
compelling»

The statute here is the orthodox kind of

public utility statute with only the standard of public
interest, public welfare in it.

It can be not seriously

contended that the legislature has ever intended to convey
on the commission the powers to regulate speech.

Of

course, the construction of the statute is not under review
heres but the fact that the Court has given that construc­
tion that the commission is vested with powers to limit
speech does inevitably raise the question of whether the
standard for it is adequate9 and we suggest that it 3s net*
that the standard for regulating speech mu3t be a good deal
more precise than that and that there is nothing in the
context or general application of the statute which gives
any guide here sufficient for First Amendment purposes.
So that is another reason why on which basis you would net
have -QUESTION:

Even though within that broad author­

ization the commission perhaps comes up with a much narrower

21
Justification aiid says what we are really talking about is
saving energy?
MR. TAYLOR:

Under the question of the standard

though, what they have done here is only one thing that
they might do for lack of the standard, and also the con­
servation xs not the only point the consuission Is making,,
of course.

They are also asserting the right to control

promotional advertising because of its effect on the rate
structure, an area in which they have full powers under
their right powers to deal with it in other ways.

So that

the assertion of power here by the commission is pretty
open-ended* Mr. Justice White, and it seems to us that the
lack of the standard is fatal.
May I come back* if I may* in conclusion* to
the matter of conservation because I think this is crucial»
Since the matter is not one of shortage of oil but of
continued dependence on foreign oil* we have a problem
which is primarily a national problem.

The federal de­

cision Is a considered one* the matter of prohibiting pro­
motional advertising was raised* the comit tee report
quite specifically says it is not intended to accomplish
that.
Mo ether state except Oklahoma has attempted
this* and there th© state court immediately held it un­
constitutional.

So we think that that is highly relevant

22
in determining the substantiality of invoking conserva­
tion»

Of course, conservation itself is a compelling in­

terest but I don91 think it all fallows from that ~ and
look at the Linmark ease9 where the state objective was
desegregated housings admittedly an important one —

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER H. SCHIFF, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE APPELLEE
MR. SCHIFF:

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As mentioned before,

this case arises from

the same order e.s the previous one, although with a. some­
what different history.

Certainly Mr. Taylor has explained

one of the reasons why we imposed the ban on the promotion
of electricity by utilities.
I want to say that our ban has been on all pro­
motion of electricity by the electric utilities.

Our

order did consider in seme detail the requests by some of

23
the utilities that they should be allowed to promote offpeak uses for particularly space heating which is in the
form of

. in two forms, one is electric resistance heating

and. the other is in terms of the heat pumps»
Mow9 the primary reason for this ban is; that New
York is terribly oil dependent and any time an additional
kilowatt hour of electricity is generated in Mew York* at
just about any time, day or night, winter or summer, addi­
tional oil is burned.
in Mew York state.

Oil is what is burned at the margin

Ninety percent —

QUESTION;

Do you suppose the state legislature

o.f Mew York would pass a law saying that no company en­
gaged in the oil business shall engage in promotional

oil or of any kind of petroleum product?

formation in commercial speech cases that the Court has

price information to customers.

That was true in the pre­

scription drug ease9 it was true in the routine legal
services case.

In terms of the oil jobbers advertising

as to what the costs are for the individual jobbers, you
will have again price information of that type being pro­
vided.

They can advertise their relative

advantages ~>~
QUESTION:

And that advertising may promote the

consumption of oil, I assume?
HR. SCHIFF:

Yes, and there are appliance dealers

who can promote and say why electric heat is better than

QUESTION:

Let me just be sura.

I take it the

reason you decline to answer say question is you rest ex­
clusively on the regulated monopoly character of this in­
dustry?
MR. SCHIPF:

That fact — well, primarily,

I

mean 1 think the facts of this case have to be judged in
the context that; this is a regulated monopoly, that even
though there is competition on a small portion of the
regulated company’s business, and my understanding is that

in electric heating, although that figure is not too easy
to come by, a much ©mailer amount involves how much is
added at any one time since these ere not thing that are
added very quickly.
QUESTION:

Well, there is nothing in the Consti­

tution that prevents Mew York from making every single
enterprise conducted in the state a regulated monopoly,
is there?
MR. SCHIPF:

Well, we can’t very well make some­

thing a regulated monopoly if the business 1st not essen­
tially monopolistico
QUESTION:
MR, SCHIPF:

Electric utilities —
Mow, wait a minute.
Oh, we could regulate them but not

as monopolies.
QUESTION:

Well, couldn’t Mew Yoi-k simply have

27
a system of state socialise where the state owns all the
means of production and so forth?

There is nothing In the

Constitution that prevents that.
MR. SCHIFF:

Well, if'you are talking about

state ownership} 1 suppos® we could have that.

I think,

yea9 I suppose we could have that but that is not what is
involved here.

In the ease of the utilities, as I indi­

cated before, the state has Imposed an obligation —
QUESTION:

Utilities is Just a descriptive term

for those types of businesses that the state has chosen
to heavily regulate and franchise, isn’t it, and there is
no magic boundary between a utility and a kind of semifree enterprise type of business.
MRo SCHIFF:

I think there Is, Your Honor.

Historically, the electric utilities became regulated be­
cause it is a matter of economics and as a matter of
esthetics, It made sense only to have one company serving
one area»

And there was no competition for most of its

services and there is no competition for most people get­
ting electric service»

QUESTION':

You mean you can’t economically!

You

C£.i®t economically, but you could constitutionally, couldn’t
you!
MR» SOEIFF:

Oh, constitutionally, sure.

But

«rhat I am saying is that utilities., monopoly utilities* the
reason the state has regulated them is a matter of historic­
ally because utilities really requested the regulation in
order to be protected from having public power,, which is
true in so many other countries, but they are different in
terms of how they operate and the competition that we have
here is very limited.
The Court of Appeals was perfectly correct in
at least recognising that the dominant aspect of electric
utilities was serving as a monopoly.

Now, In terms of the

conservation here, the reason that this is important, we
think that having utilities promote — now, by promoting
it is not giving price information, it Is essentially say­
ing to the public, go out arid use electricity and at the
same time they firs supposed to be telling the public to
save electricity.

And the more oil that w@ use, the more

pensive in the country, I suppose because it is the lowest

In

addition to that, we have a rate problem, at least in New
York, where the rates unfortunately are probably the
highest in the country,

I looked this up.

7, say with

regret that the average price used at the time of highest
consumption, which is basically in the summer time in the
areas served by Central Hudson as well as LILCO, is priced
below what the real cost to the society is or what the
consumer is, but we have not yet been able to develop the
marginal costs,

W© haven’t had all the inf©mat ion or

the equipment that is necessary to do that»
In the meantime, t© have people add these
services on the basis of the prices that are now being
charged, encouraging to do that, promoting It, which is
net just plain advertising, it is asking them to add
that service, is really inherently misleading as we ex­
plain in our brief»
Mow, re realize, of course, that in banning we
are intruding on the commercial speech rights, the First
Amendment consideration? that were considered by the com­
mission, but this case is different from the other case

QUESTION:

Of electricity„

MR. SCHIFF:
QUESTION:

of electirieity, right.
On your point that the information is

generally available about prices and the like and there is
nc choice, as Mr. Justice Stewart points out, as contrasted
with other commercial speech cases, suppose a feig company

was concerned about the relative advantages and disadvan­
tages of using heat pumps and using electric space heating
rather than other kinds of space heating, isn't that in­
formation equally inaccessible except from the company it-self —
MR. SCHIFF:

No, because'that was my next point,

that the utilities are really not uniquely qualified to
speak on that*

They don't sell this equipments they are

Just selling the electricity.

The entities that are

uniquely qualified, the ones that are comparable to the
pharmacies are the appliance dealers or the manufacturers.
It is not the utilities*
QUESTION:

I take it that by refusing to answer

earlier, you would agree that you could not prohibit them

32
from advertising the advantages of using their equipment?
MR. SCJHIFP:

Wells we eertainly couldn't.

Your

question relates, to —
QUESTION:

No, but my question of could the

legislature put some kind of an oil conservation board
into effect that would censor advertising generally that
tended to promote the usage of oil.
MR. SCHIPF:

I think that would be -- I 'would

really doubt that we could do It except in. eases of ex­
treme emergency, but we certainly haven't attempted to do
that.

The problem here — one of the things the commission

did point out is that there were other alternatives —
QUESTION:

But it seems to me that you might

have two different cases, one in which you say you can’t
advertise where the consumer has no alternative choice
such as providing electricity for burning lighting or
i

something like that, but why do you have to extend the baa
all the way into areas in which there is a legitimate
difference of opinion as to whether electricity is the
most efficient energy source?
MR. SCHIPF:

lour Honor, the reason that the

monopoly aspect of this is very important is that, for
i

example, it might be beneficial for a customep?, an in­
dividual customer to tale on an electric heat pump, the
electric heat pump is normally — Central Hudson says

33
there are some without air conditioning, but afc least they
have never advised ub of that — normally carry with it
air conditioning in the summer, and the comsalssion found
that this would, result in air conditioning that would not
otherwise happen.

The commission found that the conse­

quence of this would be to increase the rates of -all the
other customers.

What re have is a problem that perhaps

the individual customer who can gat information elsewhere
might be benefited by taking a particular appliance, tout
the rest of the customers are hurt and this is very differ­
ent, as we point out in our brief, from the area of free
competition of the pharmacist or others who aren’t going
tc engage in the. promotion unless they think it is going
to be overall gc>od for them.

The company may think it is

overall good for the®, but you have to remember that most
c.f the cost of this 9 the tab will be picked up through
their monopoly rates.

There is no way of really separat­

ing the consequences of the kind of promotion they do.
This is why the fact that this is a monopoly makes this
l

ease very different from any other case that you have
previously considered in this free speech area.
QUESTION:

Well. I understand heat pumps, of

©curse3 but I don’t know why the competition for., say, a
new subdivision is being; developed by a huge builder or
a new 100-story office building, they have a choice as to

what kind of heating, space heating it shall employ,
electric, coal, and so forth*

Isn't that just old-

fashioned competition in that area?
MR. SCUFF:

Well, you see, the resistance heat­

ing problem is that it uses substantially more oil and
there really is not- much argument and the situation in
.flew York may be different —
QUESTICM:
MR. SCHIFF:

It clearly is not a monopoly then.
— when, we have conversions to

coal, but we don’t have that now.

It is competition at

that level, Mr. Justice Stevens, but in this case the
utility —
QUESTIO;?:

Isn’t that the place they need the

advertising the most, is where there is competition?
They wouldn’t spend a lot of money to tell people about
rates they have to pay anyway.
MR. SCHIFF:

The problem is when the utility

does this advertising, the extra costs from using addi­
tioni oil and from the rat® structure problems which the
utilities can equally work on with the commission, that
problem is one that is going to be to the detriment of
the rest of the consumers, so you really have to say,
well, we can let them advertise to a fare-thee—well. and
the other consumers be damned, we can't control that even
if you can’t control it by putting in a — suppose we

35
said* well, you can promote but put in © label that this
is dangerous to the general rates, that wouldn’t help the
other consumers because it is encouraging that U3e which
in itself —
QUESTION:

Why don’t you Justify it on grounds

of projecting other consumers rather than saving oil?
MR« SOHIFF:

Well, that is part of it because

— no, we want to save oile

We are also troubled that

any promotion, the commission found that any promotion
that is done, including for heat pumps — and this is
mass media advertising that we are talking about, because
we are not talking about one-to-one promotion, this sort
of doesn’t go to that — Is going to give them mixed
signals that electric heating is going to be advertised
primarily in the summertime when it would be installed or
frequently in the summertime, and the consumers say how
do the utilities tell us it is okay, how can we accept
the fact that wo shouldn’t be using electricity for other
purposes»

This Is one ball of was*

The utility is one

entity and it is. very difficult to disaggregate that and
I — now, there is an argument here on over-breadth —
QUESTION:
is intelligent?

Shouldn’t w& assume that the consumer

Here you don’t assume —

MR. oC-HIPP:

I think that the consumer is Intel­

ligent and we think that an intelligent eons timer Is going

36
to accept the fact that if a utility is promoting gener­
ally., that it doesn’t really mean what it says about con­
servation o

1 mean I think that is what I would think an

Intelligent consumer would be doing,
QUESTION:

You reject then

Mr- P. T. Barnum's

oft-quoted maxim that no one ever lost a dime under­
estimating the intelligence of the American public?
MR, SCHIFF:
intelligent«

I think the consumer is reasonably

I think that wa point out that it is very

difficult to really compartmentalize this* but that is why
the fact that the ban is being ™- it does not apply to
other dealers, to appliance dealers where you do not have
mixed signals.

We think that it does provide consumers

with a great deal of information and that they are not
really being deprived of essential information.
I would like to get to an important; point I
think and that is the position that Central Hudson has
taken that, regardless of how good the reasons are that
we have for banning it, we can’t ban promotional advertis­
ing because we haven’t banned the use of electricity and
we haven’t banned electric heat pumps or resistance heat­
ing,

I think that the First Amendment does not require

that kind of a conclusion.

This Court in the Virginia

Pharmacy case ssid we are confident that people will not
— that doctors will not over-prescribe, but you did also

say In the Texan Optometry case that the fact that the
state wanted to limit, the commercial optometrist or had
not cut out eoranercial optometrists did not mean that you
couldn’t put reasonable restrictions on that in terms of
the trade name.

And I think there is a vast difference

in discouraging or not encouraging the use of electricity
It may b© on® way of permitting people to use that elec­
tricity without excessively pushing up the rates or
without putting an undue pressure on the oil requirements
and that you don’t have to go to the draconian means of
saying, well, some people can’t be attached,

flow, I

would be terribly troubled with saying that new customers
couldn’t attach or new people couldn’t move, and I think
it is just plain absurd to say that you caa*t put some
limits on promotion simply because you have not banned
the use of electricity or restricted the use of elec­
tricity.
I think this Court has certainly used a common
sense approach In these cases of commercial speech and
frankly I am appalled to say that we have to be so
draconian that the utilities can’t be prevented from
encouraging their usage.
QUESTION:

Well, are you arguing that because

you could be so draconian you can have this much narrower
but effective ban?

38
MR, SCSKIFP:

Well, I think certainly — I don’t

think the facts would warrant trying to be that draconian
at this time*
QUESTION:

N e but you could* you night say,

and therefore we can certainly do this.
MR» SCHIFF:

Well, w© certainly did that back i

*7'3» when the oil was practically running out in the Con Sd
territory and seme other places,, we recognised that there
were alternative means of doing it and that instructing
promotion was a better means of doing that than saying you
simply cauldn5t — that you close down the electric system
alternately throughout the system.
There are common sense differences in the com­
mercial speech area and — well, regardless of commercial

-speech* I think — but especially in the commercial -area,
where you may have to take other alternative mean's, if
this is a sensible means, more sensible than saying

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TELFORD TAYLOR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT — REBUTTAL
MR, TAYLOR:

Mr» Chief Justice, and Bay it

please the Court; :
I would just like to mate© an additional comment
with respect to the question that Mr» Justice Stevens
addressed to Mr, Schlff. suggesting a newly developed
housing area, should it fea resistance boating or soae
other form, and Mr* Schiff*s reply was that .resistance
heating would taka more oil»
That of course may be true if the energy is
electrically fired, but may I call your attention to Mr.
Schiff *s brief which says on page 18 that the commission
bar. jjever taken the position that electric space heating
should fee discouraged, and also says that there is no
sufficient basis for any action banning electric heating.
That is certainly true, there is no shortage
of oil, there is no shoi'fcage of electric capacity, there
is no ised for rationing.

These circumstances which might

43
ce,11 those powers into play are not here.

There are ad­

vantages in electric apace heating —
QUESTION:

Are you saying that is the commis-»

sion’s position3 Mr. Taylor, that the commission has not
found any of those things?
MR* TAYLOR:

Is that it?

That is what It aays, yes, sir.

The advantages, of course, of electric heating are that
It Is clear, its use In the home is pollution free, you
don!t have gas trucks running over the place and polluting
and burning up gas, and we say that under these circum­
stances that —
QUESTION:

Are you urging that the Justifica­

tion they submit or they tender Is insufficient?
MR. TAYLOR:

It is concededly so.

It is con-

cededly so, Mr, Justice White.
QUESTION:
HR. TAYLOR:

Well, I didn’t he as? him concedo»
Well, X read it though at page 18

of his brief that there is no basis for the restrictions
on electric heating, and we say if that Is so that you
cannot put a sort of slow brake on it by forbidding th©
public to be Informed about the advantages that are there.
Now, cm other thing which X would like to
mention, the notion that if we promote electric energy
we are giving the public misleading signals about conser­
vation-

You will find in our reply brief an example of

what has been dons here.

We have save energy programs in

which various wsys of saving energy are indicated to the
public and. by display., and so forth, accompanied however
by information shout the heat pump.

The commission has

questioned our doing that under this ban.

There Is in fact

a vagueness problem with this ban, too, though I have not
stressed It because I think there are more fundamental
arguments, but there Is that vagueness argument and the
"

fact Is that, despite his adverse comments on the. heat
pump, the Hew York Legislature has recently required us
to finance their installation under some; circumstances
