PROCEEDINGS
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

first this morning in National Labor Relations Board against
International Longshoremen’s Association.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE;

Mr. Chief Justicer and may it please

the Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace.

MR. WALLACE:

In this case, the Court of Appeals

for the District of Columbia Circuit set aside the Decisions
and Orders of the National Labor Relations Board in two sep­
arate cases which are the most recent in a series of Board
Decisions dealing with the validity under the Anti-boycotting
Provisions of the National Labor Relations Act of various
previsions and applications of the Rules on Containers which
arc in the East Coast labor contract

between the Respondent

union and the shipping companies governs major
ports on the East Coast.
The Board Decisions, in our view, represent a con­
sistent pattern of factual findings, inferences, and conclu­
sions; and prior to the Decision in this Case, the Board
Decisions had been upheld by three Courts of Appeals in vari­
ous applications; and indeed, this Court had denied certio­
rari in one of those cases, the Conex case, a leading case.

that the Second Circuit Court of Appeals had decided.
The Court below, ir our view, drew different fac­
tual inferences from the Board? and on the basis of those
inferences, rejected its conclusions thereby resulting in a
conflict in the Circuits which requires resolution by late
spring or early summer if the negotiations for the new
labor contract are to proceed since we now have conflicting
views expressed by the Courts of Appeds with respect to the
Rules on Containers in cases that indeed involved the same
Rules as applied to the Pert of New York.
The particular incidents that led

to the refusals

to deal at issue here involved the consolidation of less
than container load cargo into containers by freight for­
warders in the Port of New York and. so-called short stopping,
which was the stripping of containers as the unloading is
called, that were full shipper’s load incoming cargo, that
were stripped by truckers in Baltimore and Hampton Roads
port areas.
In both instances these incidents were performed
within 50 miles of the port, and the essence of the Rules on
Containers in the collective agreement, as here pertinent,
is an attempt to reserve to the members of the responding
union all stuffing and stripping of containers within 50
miles of the port; either by requiring duplication of the
work or by imposing prohibitive fines found by the Board, in

6

this case

to have the effect of requiring a boycott or by

the explicit requirement of the refusal to deal with the
offending companies.

And the essence of the Board's holding

is that in this respect the Rules overreach; go beyond
work preservation to an attempt to acquire work that had
traditionally been performed by others.

The distinction

between primary and seconder}7 activity that has been drawn
by this Court in the National Woodwork and Pipefitters
cases,
As the Board viewed what had occurred here c the
Respondent union was attempting to compensate for the
increase in productivity caused by containerization and for
the reduction in manhours therefore required on the docks by
attempting to take away work traditionally done by others.
In essence, the Board's findings are that there have tradi­
tionally been two markets performing related but separate
functions, depending on which market the shipper chose to
utilize.

In some instances, the shipper would sand goods

directly to the pier loosely to be handled by the longshore­
men and loaded or unloaded that way and picked up at the
pier.

In many other instances, they worked both prior to

and since containerisation through what had been known as
freight, forwarders or freight agents whose function was to
sort and consolidate cargo to provide for its expedition, to
provide for its sequential handling at the pier, which would

7
result in faster loading;, less time

that it would be sub­

ject to damage or assessed on the pier? and sequential
unloading at the port of its destination.

And there had.

indeed been an evolution of the use of containers which we've
recounted in some detail in our Reply Brief prior to the use
of containerized ships which has been the big advance in
technology

and which has to a large extent, made the old

cargo method of loading and unloading ships obsolete.

And

all during this evolutionary process and indeed in the early
years of the use of container ships, the same breakdown in
work functions has existed arid been carried forward until
the response in these Rules on Containers„
Something of this background and traditions of
functional differentiation in the industry will be elaborat­
ed by Mr. Lips who will be arguing next.
Now, as the Board viewed the case, and as we view
it now, of course, it would be permissible for the Respond­
ent union to seek to preserve the aspect of the work they
have traditionally performed:

the on-pier stuffing and

stripping of containers on behalf of shipp ars who choose to
deliver their cargo without the services of these middlemen,
the consolidaters or freight forwarders.

They would have a

right ’to take action against their employers if the
employers were to subcontract,

the work that, they

had tra­

ditionally done on the pier, they might also seek to induce

3
their employers to take measures to attract more business in
this way by perhaps having the steamship companies make
available, if they saw fit to, trucks to carry the goods to
the pier and schedule the on-pier loading of containers in a
way that would attract more of the business to the area
where the Respondent union has traditionally done their
work»
But the Rules on Containers go considerably beyond
this kind of measured and proper response under the Labor
Act and include, at least as an object which is enough under
Section 8(b)(4) and under the Court’s Decision in Pipefit­
ters, the acquisition of the areas of work that have tradi­
tionally been performed by others.

They are, at least with­

in the 50-mile gone, an effort to say that only the on-pier
work can use the new technology? and those that have tradi­
tionally engaged in the off-pier practices must be denied
the benefits of the new technology.
QUESTION:

As I read the Majority Opinion of the

Court of Appeals, and I believe it was Judge Robb’s dissenting
Opinion here, where he said that if a container is part of a
whole — a very large crate would have to be part of a
whole, too — I had the feeling that one would have to know
the business pretty well to make a judgment on that,

.tod I

had thought that that was a matter that was pretty much left
to the Board subject to review by the Courts of Appeals for

9
abusive discretion.
HR. WALLACE:

Well * I couldn't agree more with

that suggestion, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
The Board has heard extensive evidence about this
industry in case after case and necessarily has more cumu­
lative information about the background of this industry and
the practices than any reviewing Court of Appeals has been
favored with and has drawn its inferences accordingly in
what we believe to be a consistent pattern of decisions.
And with proper deference to the factual inferences drawn by
the Board, there would have been a consistent pattern of
Court of Appeals Decisions and really no need for this Court
to be drawn into the area.
But there*re only the two places where uniformity
of result can be expected:

the Board or this Court, in the

circumstances here.
QUESTION?

Only because there's only one of each.

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

There are times when the Board's pattern of deci­
sions may not be as consistent as it has been in this par»
fcieular area, but here there has been a consistent

pattern.

And 1 do think the Court of Appeals erred in faulting the
Board for ignoring the precontaineristation work traditions
of the industry.

The Board's Opinions refer quite

10

specifically to the precontainerization background.

We have

set out on page 20, and also on pages 21 and 22, of our
Brief, some excerpts from, first, the Conex Opinion on which
the Board specifically relied in the Hew York case before
the Court now, in which it talks, at the beginning of the
second paragraph on page 20, about the precontainerization
background? and then in the second sentence, that the advent
of containerization didn!t change this.
The same thing is true of the Administrative Law
Judges Opinion adopted by the Board in the Hampton Roads
case that is also before the Court.

First, at the bottom of

page 21, there is discussion of the precontainerization
background; and at the top of page 22, the advent of con­
tainerization did not change this.
So the Board having found the work traditions to
be what they have been really was at the end of the case as
far an they were concerned.

The case seemed to be .ruled by

principles this Court has established.

The Court of Appeals

having rejected the Board's factual conclusions, went on to
reach more specifically the interrelated question of right
to control the work and whether the employer had the right
to control the work that's in issue here.

And we believe

the Court of Appeals erred in this respect as well»
The difference between this case and National
Woodwork with respect to the right to control is that in

National Woodwork, the employer had. the unilateral choice
whether to install the prefinished doors or whether to
engage in his traditional practice; and this case much more
closely resembles the Pipefitters case where customer choices
were directing the employer's course of conduct.

Here ifc9s

the shippers who are choosing to use the consolidation or
deconsolidation services of the middlemen.
QUESTION;

Mr. Wallace, you're telling us that the

Court decided the right-fco-confcrol issue erroneously, or are
you telling us that it was wrong to get into the issue at
all?

Or both?
MR. WALLACES

eously decided.

Well- I am telling you it was erron­

Perhaps it's an issue that the Court should

have asked for the Board's views on initially, but the Board
did brief the issue before the Court of Appeals and argue it
because it seemed clear to counsel for the Board -- and
we've briefed it in this Court — that the case is con­
trolled by Pipefitters.
QUESTION;

And in any event —-

Therefore, the right to control issue

is not really relevant?
MR. WALLACE;
QUESTION;

Well —

These were customer decisions.

Not

employer decisions.
MR, WALLACE:

Under Pipefitters, there wasn't a.

right to control, as we view the case; and therefore, this

12

was an unlawful boycott even if the Court of Appeals disagreed with the Board’s findings and factual inferences about
the work traditions in the industry.

The Board didn’t have

to explicitly state anything about the right to control.
But the issues do have a close interrelationship, and we
think Pipefitters governed it, and we told the Court of Appeals
as much.
And in addition, there is a new wrinkle on right
to control in this case; and that is that the Shipping Act
and the Federal Maritime Commission interpretation of the
Shipping Act make it clear that there is no right to control
in the manner exercised by the Rules at issue here because
the Rules amount to a discrimination between customers with­
in the 50-raila zone and customers beyond the 50-mile zone of
exactly the kind that the Shipping Act prohibits.
And curiously enough, in the Court of Appeals'
Opinion which did not address the Shipping Act question, the
Court relies very strongly in a footnote in its Opinion on
the distinction between those within the 50-mile zone and
these beyond the 50-mile zone.

The very violation of the

Shipping Act.
QUESTION:

At what page is that?

MR. WALLACEi

This is on page 51(a) of the Appen­

dix to the Petition for Certiorari, in footnote 177:

To

avoid what the Court itself characterizes as the reductio

13
ad absurdum of its Opinion, it relies on the violation of
the Shipping Act to show the reasonableness of the Response
that has been adopted here»

While the fact is, were it not

for the discrimination in violation of the Shipping Act, the
reasoning of the Coixrt of Appeals, likening the loading and
unloading of containers to the loading and unloading of a
ship's hold would permit Respondents to follow containers all
over the country, and to insist on monopolization of the
loading and unloading of containers anywhere in the United
States.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the Opinion, Mr.

Wallace, to suggest what would be the result if, in relation
to that footnote, the ILA negotiated a contract for 100
miles on the next negotiation?
In other words ■—
MR. WALLACES

address that ■—*

crimination that violates? the Shipping Act.

a heavy burden indeed for the Rules to bear.

Which is

Of course,

it's always the Labor Act which is before the Court in this
case.

But I don't think it should be viewed in isolation.
QUESTION:

Is there any litigation involving the

Shipping Act?
MR. WALLACE:

There now is litigation to review

the Maritime Commission's Decisions in these cases.

MR. WALLACE:

Yes.

We refer to this on page 12 of

our Reply Brief.
QUESTION1

And where'they presently stand?

MR. WALLACE:
any Court*

They have not yet been decided by

but Commission has made its determination, and

there’s no primary jurisdiction problem.
QUESTION:

Is there on-going antitrust litigation

involving the ownership of tie containers by the shipping
companies?
MS. WALLACE:

There's a pending petition .in this

Court, Mr. Justice, Which the Court has not acted on from a
Third Circuit case which is an antitrust claim.
QUESTION:

Private?

MR. WALLACE:

Or government?

It’s a private case.

The govern-

raentfs views had

been requested by the Court, and we filed

a Brief -~
QUESTION:

Having to do with the ownership of the

containers by the shipping companies.
MR. WALLACE?

Yes.

Having to do with the"concert­

ed refusal to deai^wifch containers owned by the shipping
companies, pursuant to these Rules.

We suggested in our

filing that the validity of the Board's interpretation of
the National Labor Relations Act should be decided first.
Now, the customer choices that are involved here
are based on important economic considerations which are a
part of the totality of circumstances to which the Court
referred in Pipefitters.

The Rules in the application we

are talking about now really threaten to eliminate the
intermodal advantages of containers which can be affixed
directly to a truck chassis and moved from there directly
into the ship's hold and vice versa, and to eliminate the
services of the off-pier indoor consolidation and deconsol­
idation businesses with the advantages of expedition and
protection against damage and theft that experience has
shown that they provide, and that has*in the market place,
attracted a .large share of the business to them.
And one further consideration bearing on these
economic advantages is that in National Woodwork, both the
Court and Mr. Justice Harlan in concurrence emphasized the

16
lack of Congressional guidance in this area other than Con­
gress's traditional reliance on the bargaining process and
the hope that the problems of technological innovation will
be worked out there*
There has been some change in this situation since
the decision in National Woodwork-

There is an Act that we

refer to on page 52 of our Brief in footnote 35e The Nation­
al Productivity and Quality of Working Life Act of 1975,
which states as the policy of the government to
stimulate a high rate of productivity growth, and which pro­
vides that the laws of the United States shall be so inter­
preted as to give full force and effect to this policy.
Now, this was not relied on by the Board in arriving at its
interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act.
QUESTION;

Woodworkers*

You have suggested that

if we had had this statute at the time of Woodworkers we
would have reached different results,
MR. WALLACE;

Well, perhaps not in that case.

But

1 think that this Act and the policies of this Act should
certainly be taken into account by a reviewing Court before
it rejects the Board's interpretation of the National Labor
Relations Act when the Board's interpretation is consistent
with the policy of this Act, and a rejection of that inter­
pretation would seem to be contrary to the policy of this
Act-

17
Congress has provided further

guidance

available to the Court in National Woodwork.

than was

It doesn’t

mean that the result in that case was incorrect.

The Board

is living with National Woodwork.
QUESTION:

You say this argument v/as not made in

the Court of Appeals.
MR. WALLACE:

It was not made in the Court of

Appeals.
QUESTION:

And would the .Board rely on this at

all?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

The Board did not rely on it.

Doesn’t that make a difference?

MR* WALLACE:

Well, -the Board's interpretation on

the National Labor Relations Act turns out to be consistent
with the policy of this Act; and before a reviewing Court
rejects that interpretation, it should take the policy of
this Act into account, to the extent the reviewing Court —
QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting we ought to

s:rd it hack to the Court of Appeals, and tell them to redo
the case in light of that statute?
MR. WALLACE:

Wall, I'm not making that suggestion

at ail.
QUESTION:

But you're suggesting that we do it.

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I'm suggesting that the

Board's interpretation under the National Labor Relations Act

13
even without this Act in the picture# should have been
upheld by the Court of Appeals? and this is just another
reason that corroborates the reviewing Court should not
reject this interpretation when the rejection would result
in contravention of this policy as well,
'»> ;■' «V* V;

But I certainly am not suggesting that the case be
remanded to the Court of Appeals«.

I think resolution of the

case is very important to labor peace in the East Coast
ports and the ability to negotiate the new contracts this
summer.

And that was the basis of our expedited petition to

this Court very shortly after the Court of Appeals denied
rehearing„
So this statute, as well as the other reasons I
have suggested, seam to us to .indicate that the Court should
uphold the Board's determination that Congress did not
intend the answer to containerization to be a boycott agree*'
ment adopted at a bargaining table at which many of those
most profoundly affected# the; shippers# the truckers# the
consolidators# and deconsoliclators# and all of their employ­
ees, were not represented.
I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for
rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. ALAN LIPS
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

19

MR. LIPS:

Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.

May it

please the Court.
The work in issue here is the loading and unload”
ing of cargo to and from the containers.

And the only real

question is whether or not the geographic location of that,
work, when it’s done, is work that is traditionally within
the jurisdiction of the ILA or, in this case, the truckers
and the land-related transportation industry.
The record is complete in this and other cases
that containers per se, that is, large boxes have been used
for years, since before World War II, in and out of the
ports on the East Coast covered by these Rules.

And for

years, the ILA never took the position that this was their
work.

They passed these containers through frequently; both

by those shipped by consolidators or the principals in this
case for Dolphin Forwarding company were called nonvessel
operating common carriers.
QUESTION:

But this technology has been an

evolv­

ing one, has it not?
MR. LIPS:

It most certainly has.

But the question becomes:

at what point could or

should have the XLA said "this is our work."

They

cer­

tainly weren’t ignorant of containers that passed through
the ports, and they 1st them through for years without
claiming this work which, to us, suggests very strongly that

20

they didn't consider this their v.7ork.

Traditionally, non-’

vessel operating common carriers solicited their own custom­
ers,,

They shipped their own goods.

of lading.

They issued the bills

They were responsible for the movement, not only

from the time it left their facility across the land, but
across the sea, too.

So they were the shipper, as it. were?

and they assumed responsibility for the packaging of the
container; and this was historically done for years.
It's only when the container became so efficient
that it began to eliminate the work of longshoremen on the
piers that the longshoremen looked for a way to replace that
work; and the way they

seized was to replace it with work

that was somebody else’s work; .by bringing it back on the
piers.

Now, the truckers on the import side had tradition­

ally done the same thing,

In Hampton Roads and Baltimore,

even after the modern container came into use there around
the mid-60's or '65 or a little bit before, it wasn’t for
three more years in those ports that the ILA claimed that
that was their work.
Of course, it wasn’t their work because the truck­
ers had been doing it with the modern containers as well as
the old containers for years.
The ILA!s chief argument in this case is a very
simplistic one.

It simply says;

we will draw an arbitrary

50-mile line; and within that line, all work that relates to

21
containers is our work.

And it can just as easily ba done

itself is new.

But the work

The container is designed to go from point

to point which is not necessarily from seaport to seaport.
It's from the point at which the customer and the intermod­
al transportation system desire that the cargo foe put in to
and taken out of the container; and if it's limited to sim­
ply the port, from one pier to the next, then the container
has no more function than the cargo net.

It’s simply

a

metal box that lifts cargo up to the ship and takes it off
again„

The reason that the work is different and cannot
be done on the pier is interrelated to why shippers use con­

QUESTION:

Mr. Lips, we are here discussing purely

facts, I take it.

They do.

Are these facts that were found by the

Board and approved by the majority of the Court of Appeals?
Or were they upset by the Court of Appeals?
MR. LIPS:

Well, they were clearly in the record

before the Board and found by the Board.
The Court of Appeals slid over the factual find­
ings by saying that the test that was applied by the Board?
that is, this work is traditionally related to truckers’
work

was a test that was developed before an analysis of

the facts.

When in reality, that conclusion was based on

these factual developments.
QUESTION:

So you say the Court of Appeals second

guessed the Board, in effect.

27
MR. LIPS:
They did.

Yes, sir.

I certainly believe they do.

The Court of Appeals said that the conclusion the

Board reached as to what these facts showed was a focus of a
test that prevented the Board, from looking at all of these
facts; but a close reading of the administrative law judge's
decisions and the Board's decisions indicates that it very
carefully looked at the sequential order of the pilferage,
the breakage of cargo “~
QUESTION:

Let me ask just one factual question

with your colloquy with Mr. Justice Brennan.
The situation you describe, I take it, assumed
that the consolidation into one large container occurred
more than 50 miles from the pier.

Is that right?

I was under the impression that the loading of the
container by the consolidate:;;- had been within 50 miles,
that the I LA was reopening ar.d restuffing those containers.
MR. LIPS:

honor, until about 1975.

MR. LIPSs

The Board in the associated case on the

import side, the administrative law judge found that the
union was only aware of or only took action against about 7
or 8 containers over a period of a two-year period.

They

actually levied fines over containers that were stripped in

New York on the export side, for example, and says that

QUESTION:

Now, the fines were levied, not against

your client, but against the steamship companies.

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. LIPS:

Because the XLA's real dispute is with

the trucker that's doing this work; and the only way it can
get at the trucker and force this work back on the pier, is
through the economic pressure against the seacarrier.
It’s hard for me to understand why, that if the
ILA says, as it admits, that the full shippers load containei:

We have abandoned that work.

It can

Then those containers, let's say 100 of them in a

week, leave the pier,- the XLA's given up on those contain­
ers, and all of a sudden because they're stopped within 50
miles and converted, to road equipment for some good business
reason, then all of a sudden the union is prejudiced in some
way.

They’ve lost their work, they claim.

It's illogical.

Once they've given up that, work, it’s gone; and the fact,
that it’s stripped within 50 miles, doesn't convert it back
to their work.

They5ve lost nothing more than they lost

when they let it off the pier to begin with.
QUESTION:

At what point do you say the secondary

activity begins in this sequence of events?
MR. LIPS:

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Lambas.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CONSTANTINE P. IAMBOS
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. LAMBOS:

Mr. Chief Justice.

And may it please

the Court.
I stand before this Court tills morning on behalf
of the steamship industry operating in the North Atlantic
range to state to you that we made an agreement with the ILA
in 1968; that we made additional Rules of enforcement in

1973; that we fully believedthen and believe now * we had
fully resolved

&

critical issue of automation; and that we

had done so under the Rules set forth by this Court in
National Woodworkers and reenforced by this Court in Pipe­
fitters t or restated by this Court in Pipefitters.
I think it is important that we ask certain ques­
tions initially.
Whose job loss?

Whose automation?

Whose job depletion?

Whose labor relations?

And I think that under the principles of National
Woodwork, we find that all of these questions must be
answered on the facts found by the National Labor Relations
Board in favor of the longshoremen.

And that the industry

which suffered strike and strife in .1968, and in 1971, and
in 1911, in order to resolve this issue, should be held to
have conformed to the traditions of National woodwork, and
to have applied that law correctly.
It is our position before this Court that the
Court of Appeals aptly and properly decided this issue as a
question of law.

As it stated below, in quoting from the

Board's brief, the Board now seeks to make this a factual
question.
The Petitioner's real complaint is with the Board®
analytical framework and not its findings of fact.
We say to this Court, and to your honors, that
there is such error of law in this case, that the Board

33

bears, that the Court of Appeals properly remanded the mat­
ter back to the Board; and it did so on the basis of the
ignoring by the National Labor Relations Board of the entire
issue here.,
Let*s go back.

QUESTION:

I,for example, don’t know what long­

shoremen did before so I have to get it out of the record.
MR. LAMBOS:

I think that you will find that the

Board specifically stated in various cases.

You can look at

the Conex case in the decision of the administrative lav;
judge.

Because basically the Conex case starts this whole

trilogy of cases, although the Conex case itself is not
before this Court.

We have Dolphin and San Juan involving the

Port of New York; and then we have the Houston associated cases
involving the Ports of Baltimore and Hampton Roads — all

I said earlier, strike and strife sought to resolve, an
issue where tens of thousands of longshoremen lost their

where we brought in beautiful, new, automated ships,

where we wanted to pay low price for it,

and where we were

compelled by strike and strife to seek to make a lawful,
proper arrangement.
QUESTION;

You say you accept the findings of the

I take it that you think it's a question of law that

the Beard resolved when it said, that this work in dispute
did not traditionally belong to the longshoremen.
MR. LAMBOS:
QUESTION;

Yes, your honor
I take it they said that there were two

different markets? and two different traditional ways of do­
ing things.

And the consolidater's business was tradition-”

ally a separate business and never was the longshoremen's
business.
Is that what they said?
MR. LAMBOS:
QUESTION:
MR. LAMBOSt

They roughly said that.
You don't accept that.
1 don't accept that as a conclusion

of law.
QUESTION:

That's a classical factual determina­

tion.
MR. LAMBOS:

I would disagree with that, Mr.

35
Justice Rehnquist, because I think that the facts upon which
the Board acted, straight upon the record, indicated one
basic error of law.
QUESTION:

But then you’re accepting ~ or not

accepting — the historical findings of fact of the Board?
MR* LAMBOS:

I am accepting the historical find­

ings of fact of the Board which say that the longshoremen
did the work initially; that the consolidator brought down
the cargo piece by piece for the longshoremen to stuff it
and strip it; and I quarrel with the Board's starting its
examination into this matter by looking at what happened
after the innovation and not —
QUESTION:
MR* LAMBOS:

That’s a factual inquiry, too.
I disagree with that, your honor»

I think that where you start is a matter of law.
And where you start is where the Board went wrong.

Because

if you define, as the Board didj if you define the work
after the innovation, obviously there is no such thing as
job preservation.
QUESTION:

Well, what if the consolidators busi­

ness had started a hundred years ago, and had been just accepted
by the longshoremen?

They consolidated in the sense they

had: boxes and crates and they would take little packages and
put them into bigger boxes; and a lot of things that used to
have been done on the pier wasn't done there anymore.

I would say it’s a work preservation -Even though it had been going on this

way for a hundred years.
MR. LAMBOS:

QUESTION:

And as long as they had done it a

hundred years ago.
MR. LAMBOS:

The longshoremen did it, yes; hun­

dreds and hundreds of years before that as well on a pieceby-piece basis.
And you must bear in mind, your honors, the prin­
ciples that you enunciated National Woodworker, where you
said:

x<7hat is the threat of displacement here?

Tens of

thousands of jobs have been lost.
Obviously, we welcome the advantage of innovation,
and obviously, we have had the advantages of innocation.
Because what is the philosophy of the Rules, and what has

37
the ILA said?
They have not said as was stated heres

everything

within 50 miles of the pier must come down for stuffing and
stripping*

They said:

that which goes to the beneficial

ovmer, to the shipper, or the consignee, even within the 50mile limit, may go.
What we are looking for is that which might rea­
sonably be performed on the pier without intruding upon this
innovation.

We are willing to give you 80%? but in return

for the millions and millions of manhours of lost time, and
in return for giving up so many of our workers and their
livelihoods, we would like to have that part of the work
which we may keep on a practical basis.
QUESTION:

You say that this does not intrude on

this new technology?
MR. LAKBOS:

It does not intrude on this technolo­

gy because what it has permitted to do is for unions and
management to sit together and work out their problems with­
out the union saying, as it may say here, if we have to go
back to square one;

we say nay, and we on our side

say yea? and there is no compromise possible because we
don't know how some finder somewhere down the line may
accept any compromise? and therefore, the only alternative
appears to be industrial warfare.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS W, GLEASON, JR.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. GLEASON:

Mr. Chief Justice.

And may it

please the Court,
I think the first thing that we should point out
here is the fact that:

what are we talking about when we

talk about the rules on containers?

41
We are only talking about containers that are
owned or leased by the steamship companies.

We are not

talking about containers or boxes that belong to the ship­
pers.

If a shipper brings down a box, and he has done it*

or a consolidater has done a box and it's his box.- no matter

There is no stopping of the con­

tainers if they belong to a consolidates, a shipper, or any
body else*

The only thing that we talked about are those

containers that are owned and leased and in the control of
the steamship companies.
QUESTIONS

Milo GLEASON?

your honor, even used, because when you go into some of
these cases; what they had done, some of the companies, the
consolidates:

they had gone out, got a container off a

railroad company, and they came back, and then the steamship
company would pick up the lease on the container.
of these containers were not marked.

And most

In fact, we had to

amend the rules so that we asked the steamship companies to
mark those containers that had to be stripped or not strip­
ped.

And that was the basis of the contract in 1968.
QUESTION?

Well, do I get from that that two con­

tainers which would be precisely the same dimensions, per­
haps manufactured by the same manufacturer, one owned by one

42
party, and the other owned by a different party, would be
treated differently by the I LA.
MR, GLEASON:
QUESTION:

No, your honor,

You wanted a label on them so you could

identify which ones had to be stripped.
MR. GLEASON:

Those containers that were owned by

the steamship company and also those containers that were
moving to the consignee, whether it was outside the pier, a
shippers load, or whether it was in another area.

They

indicated only those containers that were consolidated con­
tainers or containers that had to be stripped that were go­
ing to go within the 50-mile radius.
QUESTION:

And what function does - - what econom­

ic function does the stripping of this one container perform?
MR. GLEASON:

Well, if you strip the container,

and the problem we have is:

we had to protect? we're look­

ing to protect the work of the longshoremen,

i

the long­

shoreman strip the container within the pier area, that
meant work.

The problem was that the moment the carrier was

able to take those containers and give them out to consciidafcers who were only people that, the record is clear, that
only came into business after containerization , they

would

do it at substandard wages*, tTIrnyy would be working at three,
four dollars an hour, and therefore, the automated carriers

If a container came in and it was a

consolidated3 container, then they

would look to see

whether or not the work was done within the 50-mile radius.
QUESTION:

And then if it is within the 50-nile

radius.
MR. GLEASON:

If it was done within the 50-mile

radius, we would tell the company that this was a violation;
we’d have to strip the container,

sayi

hey, you're giving containers out to consolidators who

are not entitled to do this work.

If a consolidater wants

to bring his freight down to the pier, let him bring it down
to the pier»

In fact, going to a consolidater is an addic­

tions! step in the process because:

why should a man who

has a piece of cargo, five cases, and he has it within a 50"
raile radius

why should he take it and bring it to a con­

solidater where thex-e, can be pilferage and what have you
breakage —- just like any other company»

And then take it

from the consolidater to the pier, when he could directly
take it from his place of business directly down to the pier
to the longshoreman where then he could load it into the
container*
So you have the added step then here*

Take the container off the ship and

MR. GLEASON:

No, your honor.

What they would do is, if they have a container
that's coming in on a ship into Hew York and it then was go­
ing to be flown to California, they would take that contain­
er and they would bring it over to the airline; and probably
if it was one owner and it was his container, then it would
probably either he stripped over there,

and if it wasn't,

it would be stripped at the pier, and they would bring a
container over and load it in it.

It depends on who owned

If the new consol-

And if airplanes are going to handle

all the cargo in the country by helicopter, we’re out of

Would you just address yourself a little bit to

MR. GLEASON:

56
When we sat down and we negotiated1 'this in 1968, of
course, we had a strike? and the President of the United
States appointed a Special Mediator, David Cole, to come in*
And we sat down, and we argued back and forth:
bast?

what was

And we finally come to the conclusion, with the help

of David Cole, that in the port area, those little pieces of
freight that normally came down to the pier, we could still
have that»
Outside the 50-mile radius, we did not want to
impede automation? therefore, just as the Board points out
in its brief, they talk about a container coining from
Chicago to Mayaguez<
right through*

That’s just a consolidated container? goe

Nobody stops it.

It's only those pieces of

cargo that are corning from a shipper or into that area where
there would normally flow right down to the pier as it
always did»
If Houff prior to containerization had ten cases
of cargo coming from out in West Virginia, and he was making
a delivery, he wouldn’t take it down and strip it at his
platform.

He’d take it on that truck and bring it right

down to the pier where the longshoremen would handle it, and
take it off and put it on pallets or put it in slings and
await loading on the ship.
QUESTION:

Well, what do you say about the argu­

ment that the -■* say, like in the Mew York area, where —

and it’s certainly argued in this case that the forwarders

stuff, but they do more than that.
MR0 GLEASON:

Your honor»

I must say this:

that

prior to containerization, the freight forwarders, that was
the consoiidaters? they only done the paperwork.

They would

make arrangements with truckmen to go pick up the freight,
and do this work»
And I think on page 8 of our Brief, in a footnote ~QUESTION:

So you say that whatever it is, it isn't

much.
MRo GLEASON:
QUESTION:

No.

It isn’t.

But why 'would a shipper ever go to a con*»

solida ter or a forwarder rather than taking it down to the
pier unless there was some real — Ee was paying for it.
There’s obviously a market for their services.
MR. GLEASON:

Your honor.

One of the problems

that we have is that some of the steamship companies have
set up tariffs? and in the tariffs, they give part of their
fees to the consolidate!" to do this work .
In other words, the consolidater gets about five
hundred and something dollars off the steamship company plus
a part of the revenue.

So what he’s really doing is:

he

58

would rather have it done outside by nonunion labor.
a fixed cost, and this is the way they operate.

He has

And the

problem is, it’s really subcontracting out the work.
QUESTIONS

But that's not work done traditionally

by longshoremen.
MR. GLEASONs

Sure.

We always did the work.

Consolidaters never — steamship companies never
paid
QUESTIONS

But, I mean, consolidation done, say,

50 or 100 miles away from the port.
MR. GLEASON:

Your honor, I may say this:

that I

don't know of any consolidation that was ever done 100 miles
away from the port prior to containerization.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't a primary function of con­

solidators to take care of less than car load shipments or
less than truck load shipments?
MR. GLEASONs

Consolidation really years ago, I

think, was in the railroad industry.

And I might say the

longshoremen did that work in the Port of New York, too.
When they brought down, it was only on domestic cargo which
was handled by railroads.
It was only, as I said on page 8 that we have a
footnote.

And I think Mr. Ullman in his role of the

American Ocean Freight Forwarder spells out that when they
were going out of business, containerization started to hurt

59
them? they had to get into a new business.

And so they

started to go into consolidation.
And one of the things you have to look at is the
consolidater.

And this was the problems that we had.

And we thought that we had the problem solved in 1968.

And

as pointed out, we had no strike in 1974 because we agreed
the rules were there.

We're not going to change them.

But, again, having longshoremen looking and say lugs

ers before.

They came in and they could add or decrease the

cost of that minimum, depending on the amount of service.
But the service, again, of that freight forwarder

that

NVO before was really doing the paperwork; and so therefore,
when it came in, in order to get the freight, the steamship
company, in their tariffs —- it's a matter of record — is
really giving back to the consolidater — I think it's
around $500 roughly plus I think a percentage.
Now one of the arguments has been in negotiations:
hey, what you did. to us, you tariffed us right out of our
business.

You know, you're getting the work and having sub­

contractors doing the work by putting this in your tariffs.
And therefore, causing problems because, in most ports, it's
based on the manhours that goes into the pension and welfare

62
funds.

Now, we have this problem in New York»

In fact, we

had a work stoppage in 19 — I think it was 1970 — where
because of the hours generated by the conventional operators
was going into the fund, and the automated carriers, espe­
cially Sea Land— they ware the only ones -that were really
in the business until, I think 1970?

Yet, the tonnage they were passing through

the port was tremendous.
And so finally, they got around in New York, and
they changed to a tonnage basis; but they don’t do this in
Hampton Roads, and they don’t do it in Baltimore, and they
don’t do it in Norfolk.
And we see ports like Wilmington, North Carolina,
where they're bringing containers in.

And there’s no work.

The funds, the pension funds, the welfare funds are all in
serious trouble.

Nov?, if they’re going to take that and

give the work, that little work, that’s going to give it to
consolidators who don't own any equipment.

63
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have any thing

further, Mr. Wallace?
MR. WALLACE:

Just two or three points, Mr. Chief

Justice.
One of the difficulties in this case, is that the
Board dealt only with the incidents that were before it, and
did not make comprehensive findings about the apparent dis­
crepancies between what the Rules provide and what we are
told are the practices under the Rules.
As we point out on pages 9 and 10 of our Reply
Brief, the Rules in terras apply to containers owned, leased,
or used by carriers; and indeed, there’s testimony

in this

case that their application was not restricted to those
owned by the carriers? and findings in Cenex.

I'll recount

on page 10 of our Reply Brief to the same effect.

I don't

know why the Respondent union emphasises so strongly that
the Rules are restricted to those owned by the carriers
because, those are the ones that are facilities of the com­
mon carrier as to which obligations under the Shipping Act
cause special problems; .rather than, the ones where it's
easier to justify the discriminations that the Rules appar­
ently require.
QUESTION 2

Whatever the actual day-to-day

64
practices are, however various they nay foe, there is the
Agreement, isn’t there?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

And isn’t it claimed to foe —

violation.

There is the Agreement.

The Board found it to foe an 8(e)

That is correct.
And under that Agreement, there is a requirement

that those stuffed within the 50 miles and certain others,
that weren’t at issue in this case, that extend beyond the
50 miles, be stripped and restuffed at the pier or a heavy
penalty will be assessed.

It has the effect of requiring

the cessation of business.
How, it*s true that, those either weren’t detected in
some instances; or if they were detected, the Rules weren’t
applied.

We’re told that there have been payoffs.

I can’t

really testify as to what has happened here and answer these
factual questions.
But the fact is:

that is the Agreement that the

Board has held to be an 8(e)

They purported to use the tradition­

the Courts that reached the opposite result in the other
cases.
QUESTION:

Haven’t we said that really the Courts

of Appeals ought to be the final word on evidentiary things?
On factual findings about the Board?
MR. WALLACE:

That was the position that we took

66

And this Court

denied certiorari*
But now, we are faced with two Courts of Appeals
purporting to apply the same standards and reaching contrary
results about the Port of New York*

QUESTION;

MRs WALLACES

There’s a need for resolution because

think that this Court errs in — it did apply the standards
that the Board should apply.

But those are not the stands

arcis that a Court of Appeals should apply*

The Court of

Appeals was in a sense undertaking a reevaluation of the
facts under standards that the Board should apply, and it
disagrees with the inferences, drawn by the Board.
QUESTION;

So you do say they applied the wrong

standard in reviewing -«■*
MR. WALLACE;

Well,- in that sense, I do.

I do.

And I want to emphasize that we’ve recounted on
page 3 of our Reply Brief the use of consolidation boxes and
containers of various kinds prior to the advent of contain­
ers: that we are now dealing with; and the fact that the his­
tory was that that kind of sorting, as was found in the
Cenex case, was done indoors, off the pier, by these freight
forwarders and were not unpacked and. reloaded on the piers.

67
That was traditionally the work of the freight forwarders
and consolidaters as the Board found.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
the case is submitted*
