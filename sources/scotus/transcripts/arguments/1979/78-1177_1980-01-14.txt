PROCE E DIN
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

GS

Mr. Wake, I think you may

proceed whenever you are ready now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEIL VINCENT WAKE,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR.WAKEs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
This case deals with the permissibility of certain
State taxation concerning use of tribal and Bureau of Indian
Affairs roads on the reservation when use is made by a nonIndian logger as a part of a tribal forestry enterprise.
The White Mountain Apache Tribe and its logger
Pinetop Logging Company, actually one of its loggers, submits
that the State taxes are barred by two separa.te principles of
Federal law.
The first ground for a claim of defense to these
texes is that they are preempted by comprehensive Federal
regulation of the fields of managing and harvesting Indian
reservation timber.
Our second defense is the doctrine that State laws
Key not be applied even to non-Indians with respect to their
oral mgs with Indians on the reservation where to do so would
Infringe on the tribal self-government.
QUESTION:

I am not saying it is entirely immaterial,

but it isn't in the case.

4

MRp WAKEj

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Is there any reason why you didn't take

it as an appeal?
MR, WAKE:

I considered either option available, and

was not entirely sure, and filed to serve petition.
QUESTION:

Well --

MR, WAKE:

My co-counsel Mr. Michael Brown will

address himself to the claim of infringement of tribal selfgovernment .
The facts upon which this case arised can be stated
summarily as follows:
Over a hundred years ago President Grant set aside
a reservation for the White Mountain Apaches in a remote and
mountainous part of Arizona.

Virtually the only significant

resource on that reservation is the timber that grows in the
mountains.

Fortunately for this tribe, that resource holds out

the potential for a perpetually renewable resource if v?isely
managed.

And, indeed, the tribal timber enterprise is the

principal financial support for the entire tribal government
in. all other tribal programs.
In addition, the tribal timber enterprise is a
major on-reservation employer of members of the tribe.
Obviously an essential part of the program of
harvesting this timber is getting the trees from off the
mountain down to the tribal mill in white River, Arizona.

That process requires the building and the maintenance of an
extensive road system throughout the reservation and, indeed,
there are literally thousands of miles of roads throughout
this reservation.

Most of these roads, almost all of these

roads are built and maintained by the tribe itself either
directly or through its loggers.
I have brought with me and intend to submit to the
Clerk's Office for illustrative purposes only, the most recent
U.S. Geological Survey map of the reservation which gives some
indication of the extent of the road system that is to be found
thereon.
QUESTION:

But do they use the State road to some

MR. WAKE:

Your Honor, the loggers have occasion to

degree?

cross the State roads and to use them from time to time and,
indeed, the Pinetop Logging Company keeps precise records of
all of its use of State roads and it pays taxes with respect to
those uses.
This lawsuit does not involve an attempt by the State
of Arizona to obtain tax payments with

respect to the use of

its own roads that it owns or builds or maintains or polices.
Rather, this lawsuit has to do with intent by the State of
Arizona to derive windfall profits for the benefit of its
State road system, not from the use of those roads but from the
use of wholly different roads which are built and maintained

6

and owned solely by the tribe and by the Bureau of Indian
Affairs.
QUESTION:

Well, you don't contend, do you, as a

matter of general tax apportionment law that a Stats could not
exact a license fee for the use of a vehicle and devote the
proceeds of that tax to maintenance of roads and base it on
the value of the vehicle; and that the owner of a vehicle
could nonetheless say, well, I only drive my car to church on
Sunday, so although your tax would come out to be
computed $100 I am paying you $3, which I think is the value
that I use your road.
MRo WAKE:

Your Honor, we certainly do not make

that contention and the principles to which you1 refer are
general principles of municipal and public law with respect
to taxing authorities of various taxing entities.
What we are discussing in this case is a different
body of law which is a body of Federal law which has to do
with when a specific congressional regulatory scheme dealing
with specific subject matters preempts interfering State laws.
So the answer to your question is "No," but I submit that
does not answer the question before the Court.
QUESTION:

Well, then why does Pinetop keep specific

records of its use on Arizona State highways?
MRo WAKE:
simple.

Your Honor, the reason for that is very

First, our client as a practical matter thought it

7

fair to pay those taxes, and as a practical matter we choose
not to bring that lawsuit.
QUESTION:

So, in effect, you say that you might be

able to challenge those laws but you are electing to pay a part
of the tax that is levied.
MRo WAKE:

Your Honor, wa do not choose to challenge

the State's collection of taxes with respect to the vise of its
own roads.

We do not admit liability, we simply have no case

or controversy before the Court with respect to that question.
QUESTION:

How about the licenses on the trucks?

MR, WAKE:

The trucks are licensed, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And they pay license fees?

MRo WAKE:

I believe that those license fees are

paid and I would point out that they are de minimis in amount
so far as my understanding.

That again is another lawsuit

not —
QUESTION:

Mr. Lake, can I ask you another question.

With respect to the 8-cent-per-gallon fuel tax, the statute
says "For the purpose of partially

compensating the State for

the use of its highways," and so forth, the 8-cent tax is
imposed.
Supposing the statute said in order to generate
general revenues for the State, the tax in this amount is
imposed and went into the general funds.
the same?

Would your case be

3

MRo WAKE:
different case.
same.

1

Your Honor, that would be a slightly
submit that the answer would probably be the

And let me elaborate on that answer for a moment.
Again, the fundamental concern x^hlch we submit the

Court must address itself to is what the subject matter and
the purposes of the Federal regulation is and whether those
purposes require the exclusion of these State taxes.

Now, in

this case the Federal Government has regulated the entire
field, we submit, of managing and harvesting Indian timber.
These particular State taxes are offensive not because of what
they are used for but because of how they bear upon the Federal
scheme.
'We submit that the fact that these State taxes are
used for the building of unrelated State roads is part of what
makes these taxes worse, it is not necessarily what makes them
bad.

What makes them bad is the fact that the attempt of the

State of Arizona to derive tax revenues out of the tribal
forestry program runs at cross purposes to the specifically
identified and articulated Federal purposes of the management
and harvesting of tribal timber.
Therefore, wh.et.he3r the State uses these taxes for
other purposes or not, is not necessarily controlling.
QUESTION;

How is that different from charging a

tax say -- sales taxes or something like that on the purchase
of the

vehicles which are used exclusively in the logging

9

business ?
MRo WAKE:

Your Honor, I would, submit that in order

to draw the boundaries of the reach of the preemptive force
which we submit must be recognized here, one would have to
look to a number of considerations.

And there is no bright

line test but there are a number of overlapping

considerations

that are adequate for purposes of identifying the specific
needs to protect against specific State intrustions into the
regulatory scheme.

1 may list a fev? of them.

One is the nexus of the State assertion of juris­
diction with the direct subject matter of the Federal
regulation.

Here Federal regulation deals specifically and

directly with the process of getting the trees off the
mountain down to the mill.

That is the core of the entire

statutory and regulatory scheme.

And these taxes are an

attempt to derive revenues off of that very subject matter.
Nov? -QUESTION:

Except that the taxes imposed on the gas

is pumped into the tank, I suppose.
MR a WAKE:

Your Honor, the tax is imposed under

State lav? on the conjunction of two incidents.

One is the

burning of fuel to move a motor vehicle; and the other is the
moving of it on a highway or road, as it is defined.
QUESTION:

But isn't the tax just added to the price

per gallon of gasoline?

10

MRo WAKE:

Not in this case, Your Honor.

Our

client Pinetop Logging Company purchases its diesel fuel in

If it please the Court, I do anticipate the need for
some rebuttal today and therefore I would like to yield to my
co-counsel, Mr. Brown.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Brown.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. BROWN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, BROWN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The taxation which the State seeks to reimpose in
this case is an infringement upon the sovereignty of the White
Mountain Apache Tribe and its right of tribal self-government.
It interferes with a fundamental purpose, as well as the basic
nature of the reservation.
One of the mo3t basic principles of Indian law is
that those powers vested in an Indian tribe are not delegated
but are rather inherent powers of limited sovereignty.

They

are inherent in that that sovereignty preexisted both the
sovereignty of the State of Arizona as well as the United States
of America itself.

12

Williams v. Lee has said that the test of sovereignty
when you are dealing with the affairs of non-Indians on
reservations is that the tribe and the State law, that each
have legitimate interests but that the right of reservation
Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them shall remain
inviolate.
Congress has -QUESTION:

Has violated -- if it so chooses, can it

not under -NF.o: E'FCWN'r Yes, sir, Congress has the power of
defeasance to take away the sovereignty which the Indian tribes
retain, but it has not yet done so.

And the indications from

Congress of course are quite to the contrary.
The Congress has given, for example, in 1953 five
States the right to extend both their civil and criminal juris­
diction to Indian reservations, and to allow those States to
accept the benefits of that as well as the responsibilities for
the tribes in Public Law 280.

arizona, while not one of

the

five delegated States, had the right and the power by several
means to ascribe to Public Law 280 and accept the responsibilities
for the White Mountain Apache Tribe and the other tribes
with reservations within the State of Arizona and refused to
do so.
I

This lawsuit is essentially about roads and trees.
The State would like to say that it is about taxes.

13

But it is about the fact that the White Mountain Apache Tribe's
reservation, which is the Fort Apache Reservation, — it is
in northeastern Arizona and it is 1,600,000 acres, it is rural
and it is mountainous and it is widespread and with people all
over that reservation.

It is not an urban area and the major

rural or urban area is White River and it has maybe 1,000 to
1,500 people living in it.
One of the designed secondary purposes of the tribal
timber industry is the creation of roads.

The timber industry

must in fact create roads to get to the trees so that they can
be logged, the forests can be logged.

But also it is necessary

to create adequate roads into those rural and remote areas
so that v?e can have the ability to deliver food and essential
services to remote areas of the reservation and to maintain
communications with those areas.

And that is a direct and

design product of the roadbuilding and the maintenance program
of the tribe and the Fort Apache Timber Company and the loggers
who are agents to create a good number of the roads and by
contract of course maintain the roads pursuant to the Bureau
of Indian Affairs criteria a5id regulations of the Federal
Government.
In Hoe this Court said that States in dealing

V* A. til

actions on reservations involving Indians and non-Indians that
tha State would be allowed to tax those kinds of transactions.
If there was a significant interest that the state had in some

.14

real economic benefit was going not to the Indian party
involved in the transaction but to a non-Indian.

And that

essentially what was happening was that this transaction, or
attempt to cloak this transaction in immunity was merely an
end run by the non-Indian around legitimate taring interests of
the State.
We would submit to the Court that that is a valid
test and that there ought to be soma way that this Court can
draw a line quite apart from the preemption argument made in
Warren Trading Post along the infringement of tribal sovereignty
and the infringement of tribal self-government.

to consider at least four things.
Number one, the location.

Indian policy is effectuated.

Another issue is:

Does it interfere with the

fundamental purpose or nature of the reservation.

And it is

inconceivable to me that with the geographical make-up of the
reservation that Congress

and the President in making up the

reservation could not have anticipated that a tribal timber
industry was going to be necessary.
Number three, where does the burden truly fall,on the
Indian or the non-Indian.

Clearly it doesn't make any differ­

ence what you call a tar.

You can call it a sales tax, a

privilege tax, an excise tax, a motor carrier tax.
is where does' the burden fall.

The question

That is just what the State

wants to do with the taxing scheme.
In this case it is admitted that the economic -- the
total economic burden and direct economic burden falls on the
tribe and the tribal timber industry

in that dollar for dollar

the tribe must pay to planter all the money the money they
expend for the tax.
In this case, another issue and thing that I think
that the Court ought to look at in formulating a test is the
legitimate interests of the State in the tribe.

The other thing that I think that the Court wants to

this tax and the transaction that you are dealing with is
wholly on the reservation that there is no potential for
abuse.

We are not dealing with Montana chain smokers or any

of that sort of thing.

and .it is directly on a tribal enterprise.
Mrs, Stillman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS0 ELINOR H= STILLMAN,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
Mrs. Stillman.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
It is the position of the United States that the
State of Arizona may not impose its motor carrier license tax
or its use fuel tax on the logging and hariling activities of
petitioner ,pinetop Logging Company on the reservation of the
White Mountain Apache Tribe.
That position rests we believe on a number of
mutually reinforcing considerations and it is no answer to our
argument to examine anyone in particular and to say that it
is insufficient to validate the taxes.

Before discussing

those particular considerations in this case, however, X would
like to examine or identify the barter principles that underly

20

oust

analysis, hoping to show the Court that in fact it rests

securely on priciples that this Court has recognized in recent
Indian tax decisions.
QUESTION:

May I ask you just one preliminary question

and then I won'1 interrupt any more.
Assume that the logging companies did half their
business on the reservation.

Would they be entitled to a 50

percent exemption from both taxes?
MRS. STILLMAN:

Yes.

I assume that this is very

much tied to the reservation locus and I will explain
QUESTION;

It is apportioned on the basis of how

much of their business -MRS o STILLMAN:

Yes.

Yes.

Before discussing those considerations here, however,
I wish to identify these broader principles.

These principles

have been summarized in this Court's decisions in Warren
Trading Post, in McClanahan, in Mescalero Apache Tribe and
in Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes.
First, as Moe and Mescalero made quite clear, Federal
instrumentality doctrine no longer answers questions in this
area and we do not rely on Federal instrumentality doctrine
at all, which is to say we don't say simply because a burden
falls on a tz’ibe which has a connection with the Federal
Government that that alone invalidates a tax.
QUESTION:

You are saying this is true of commerce,

21

'I suppose.1
MRS» STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Excuse me?

And the same is true on the Indian commerce

argument.
HRS. STILLMAN: The Indian — I -QUESTION:

I mean just as such, imimplemenfced by

any statutes.
MRS. STILLMAN:

No, I don't concede that, Your

Honor.
QUESTION: Well, you go ahead then anyway.
MRS P STILLMAN:

I wish to adopt and rely on the

remarks by Mr. Claiborne with respect, to the Indian commerce
clause.

Our position does not rely on that doctrine.
Second, although the concept of tribal sovereignty

is still relevant it is now defined to a large extent by
treaties and by Federal law.

And as the Court noted in

McClanahan and in the year since Wooster v. Georgia notions of
Indian sovereignty have bean adjusted to take account of the
State's legitimate interest in regulating the affairs of nonIndians.

But to adjust something is not to eliminate it.

And when you are talking about State regulation of affairs of
non-Indians that take place upon a reservation you simply
cannot automatically assume that they have impunity to do what
they wish to the non-Indians.
The Court considering whether a particular, exercise

22

OF State power on a reservation rau3t take account of the claims
of tribal, sovereignty as well as the customary powers of the
State in dealing with its residents.
Two tests for making this determination have been
suggested by the Court's decisions in Warren Trading Post and
in Williams v. Lae.
The first test is:

Does the exercise of State power

in some way- -- is in some way preempted by Federal scheme.
And the second test is does it in some way infringe
on tribal self-government.
The two tests are independent and the State's power
may be defeated by either one.

Nevertheless» the two are not

necessarily unconnected and we believe that is in the
circumstance of the present case Federal law may reflect a
judgment of Congress concerning what conditions are essential
to the continuing existence of tribal self-government.
QUESTION:

You say they are independent.

MRSa STILLMAN:

They are independent bufe they may at

MRS, STILLMAN:

No, I can understand that might

QUESTION:

Well, maybe that is very superficial but

superficially it sounds they seem inconsistent.

If we are

talking about tribal independence, that means independence from
anything and everything.
MRS, STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

We are --

MRS. STILLMAN:

No, I believe this Court has always

talked about a quasi-sovereignty, a dependent sovereignty.
QUESTION:

Quasi-independence,

MRSo STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Quasi-independence.

Independence from State but not from Federal

controls, is that it?
MRSo

STILLMAN:

That is correct; yes.

And what I

mentioned — when I talk about tribal self-government and tribal
sovereignty I am referring to that concept.
QUESTION:

Right.

MRSo STILLMAN;

State actions likely to undermine

the conditions which would

which Congress in its scheme has

defined as essential to preserving the tribal government of its
own relation within its

reservation would fail both tests.

Of course as the Court observed in Bryan v. Iteska County the
Government can also authorise the State in derogation of this
sovereignty;

And if it does, you might have a situation in

which the State fails the infringement test and then is saved

24

Eome sort of congressional authorization.
We believe that the taxes at issue in the present
case fail both of the first two tests and are not saved by the
third.
First, as we have explained in our brief, a
comprehensive network of laws and regulations governs the
operation of tribal timber enterprises which are conceived
of as a means of securing a secure economic base for the
continued self-government of tribes having extensive timber
lands on their reservations and for proi^iding a source of
employment for tribal members within their reservations.

In

other words, as we conceive the Federal scheme here it is not
just a scheme for cutting down timber and supervising roads.
It is a scheme for making these tribal timber enterprises a
basis for making the tribe self-sufficient within their
reservation for their members within their reservation and
make it a going concern.
Now, the Arizona taxes at issue --QUESTION:

The tribal scheme totally self-

sufficient so the tribes operated the logging enterprise them­
selves, then they would'be tax exempt.
MRS» STILLMAN:

Yes, except that the tribe has found,

and J. believe this is in the record in one of the. affidavits,
that it is not economical for them to try it.

it at one place in the reservation and found that it cost them

To the extent that that is either a burden

MRSo STILLMAN:

I am not sure as to what

The Arisona taxes at issue here would fall upon all of
the logging contractors, not just Pinetop? and can reasonably
be assumed as a practical matter to be passed on to the tribe.
I don't think that is really contested.

The State argues

instead that legal incidence is what makes a difference.
The record docs not show x^hat all of those taxes have
amounted to in any given year.

But the important points is this:

The tax rate is determined by the Stata quite independently of
what the tribe's balance sheet might show in any given year.
It is just an uncontrollable financial burden that could be
quite substantial and ie inconsistent with what we think is

the

thrust of the Federal scheme.
Second, the taxes infringe on tribal sovereignty and
they do so in two ways

As we have argued, they interfere with

26

scheme that Congress has' devised to foster and assure a viable
tribal self-government.

And they also represent an intrustion

into the geographical territory of the tribe without the warrant,
of any strong State interest other than the desire to augment
its general revenues.
Now, the argument here is almost somewhat metaphysical.
I think that is something of what makes Indian law a little
difficult and complicated.

It is a notion of what it means for

a sovereign or a quasi-sovereign to have authority over its
territory.

And although the tribes clearly do not have absolute

authority of their territory, cannot block the State at the
boundaries of the reservation, nevertheless it says something
in derogation, in serious derogation of its powers over its
territory for the State to corae onto the reservation and tax
some activity with no interest, no legitimate interest, no
regulatory interest other than- just a desire for more money.
It is just a treatment of the boundaries as if they can be
casually passed over without any seriousness to do so.
QUESTION:

Isn’t that wholly consistent with Moe?

MRS* STILLMAN;

Well, in Moe, yes, I think it is,

because in Moe what you had on the sale of the; Indian trader to
the non-Indians was a serious State interest in having -QUESTION;

Here they come onto the reservation, collect

monsy, make the Indians collect it, and return it to the State.
MRSo STILLMAN;

Yes, but what was happening there I

27

believe the State there was losing revenue that had otherwise
people would be coining onto the reservation to buy things that
they otherwise would have bought -QUESTION:

But the geographical matter is not --

MRS o STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

No.

-- of talismatic significance.

MRSo STILLMAN:

No, it is not talismatic but 1 am

saying that the weight of the State’s interest has some
significance here.
QUESTION:

Well, you haven’t made a commerce argument

yet? I guess you aren’t.
MRS o STILLMAN:

Your Honor, we would rest upon -- I

would assume that the argument made in our brief in Central
Arizona Machinery would apply her® as well.

We thought that in

this case that regulatory scheme required somewhat longer
examination and we didn't make that argument hare.
The taxes here, third, we do not think have been
authorized by Congress either in the Buck Act or in the Hayden®-'
Cartwright Act.

For reasons that this Court found convincing

in the Warren Trading Post case it found that the Buck Act
does not apply to a tax on someone on an Indian reservation
who is selling to Indians.

And that is what the gross recepits

tax, the motor carrier license tax here is absolutely in many
ways identical to the tax here,
I sas my time is up.

Thank you.

MRc

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Macpharson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN Aa MACPEERSON, ESQOJ
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MRo MACPHERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

tha Court:
At the outset. I think what I would like to do is
address a couple of questions that ware raised by the Court
during Mr. Wake's opening remarks, Mr. Brown's opening remarks
and the United States' remarks.
Specifically, it is my recollection that Justice
Stevens was inquiring as to the question of whether or not we
were talking about the same principles, were we talking about
a general gross receipts tax.

What about Vfeyerhauesur or some

other company operating on the reservation, would they be
subject to a gross receipts tax if in fact we weren't talking
about either the use fuel tax or the motor carrier tax.
The answer to that question is "Yes."

In Footnote

13 of the petitioner’s opening brief we find a discussion of
Arizona Revised Statutes Section 42-1303 and 1312.

Now, those

were the statutes that were under consideration by this Court
in Warren Trading Post.
An examination of the transaction privilege tax code
will reveal in ARS Section 42-1321 an exemption for the trans­
portation of tangible personal property from Point A to Point B
within the State of Arizona if the outfit being purportedly other

29

wise subject to the transaction privilege tax pays a tax under
40-641.

The point is under 40-641 they are subjected to the

motor carrier tax which has a relationship to State roads at a
rate of 2-1/2 percent.
Under section 42-1310, which is under the transaction
privilege tax code, they would otherwise be subject to the
transaction privilege tax with respect to hauling within the
State of Arizona.

They are exempted by virtue of State law

under section 42-1321.
So theanswer to Mr. Justice Stevens’ question is
yes, a transaction privilege tax would apply to that trans­
portation.

Again, that is not the case that wa have here this

morning but if that case were to come Up, then the question
*

becomes would it be permissible as a matter of Indian law.
Again, it would remain the State of Jiriaona’s position, yes,
we are dealing with a non-Indian entity on an Indian
reservation.

Any economic burden of either the Arizona trans­

action privilege tax, the motor carrier tax or the use fuel
tax which may be visited upon the Indian reservation arises
solely by virtue of contractual negotiation, nothing else.
There is absolutely no requirement of the State lav? under any
of those three taxes that these costs be passed on or that
the legal incidents be shifted over.
QUESTION:

You then would just draw the empirical

line I take it that if -- between a tribal transportation

30

operation and a non-tr.ibal transportation ooparation.

I suppose

if you win this case and then the tribe liquidates Pinetop and
operates itself,the transportation owns the trucks and operates,
that you wouldn't tax them.
MRo MACHPERSON:

We would not tax them?

That is

correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr. Maepharson -V-

MRo MACPHERSON:

Yes, Justice Marshall.

QUESTION: Take a big farm.

Could you tax the trans­

portation of the farm material from one end of the farm to the
other?
MR* MACPHERSON:

On the theory — well, does your

hypo -QUESTION:

Any theory.

MRo MACPHERSON:

Does' your hypothetical perceive

those roads to be private roads?
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

MR» MACPHERSON:
QUESTION:

No, sir, we would not.

Well, what is the difference?

MRo MACPHERSON:

Well, at this point, Your Honor, I

think it would be appropriate, and I have discussed this with
/

the Court's leave, with Mr. Wake, by way of explanation as to
the record in this case *—
QUESTION:

Yes.

MRo MACPHERSON:

There apparently was some misunder-

31

standing with respect to exactly what issues were before the
Arisona courts with respect to what roads and what taxes we
were being

we x^ere taxing the use with respect thereto.
QUESTIONS

Well, I am thoroughly confused, because

you said that some State roads are used, some local roads are
used, and I guess some are hybrid.

I didn't get it from either

one the two, so why don’t you tell me what roads are involved.
MACPKERSON:

Well, very good, Your Honor.

It is

my understanding that the Pinefcop operation occurs totally
within the confines of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation.
There are several types of roads on that reservation, including
State highways.

And this gets to the question that one of Your

other Honors asked;
highways?

What about this fact that they use State

With respect to the travel on those State highways,

they have paid the taxes without protest.

It is my recollection

Mr, Wake indicated that they choose not to challenge that.
Certain other travel occurring on BIA-designated
roads., tribal roads and other types of roads on the reservation
are the subject of the lawsuit here.
With respect to travel on the BIA roads, it is the
State of Arisona’s position that the assas3ment in question
relates to those — the use of those highways and pursuant to
Federal law, even without regard to the Hayden-Cartwright Act,
travel on those roads is specifically authorised by virtue of
the Coda of Federal Regulations

32

QUESTION;

Well, what is the difference between BIA

roads and farmer Brown's roads, in my hypothetical?
M.Ro MACPHERSON:

In your hypothetical, Your Honor,

farmer Brown's roads are private roads.

By virtue of Federal

regulations BIA roads are "open to free public use," by mandate
of the regulation.
QUESTION;

And that is the distinction.
Well, then, if farmer Brown says anybody

wants to use those roads, if he used it he would be in trouble.
MRo MACPHERSON;

Mr. Justice Marshall, trouble -~

he would perhaps travel on those roads would be subjected to
the tax.

But so long as the road remained a private thorough farts

they would not be so traveled and use of those road would not
be subject to the State tax.
With respect to the argument that this entire area
has been preempted, it is the State of Arizona's position that
quite the contrary,the Federal regulatory scheme speaks in
terms of sound management of the forest resource.

The

Federal objective is to protect the forest resource, to protect
it from disease, fire, various other plagues and famines that
might occur that would destroy or harm the forest resource.
The State of Arizona respectfully submits that that
preempts Area A, and we are talking about Area B.

There is

nothing in either the Federal statutes or the Code of Federal
Regulations upon which Pinetop and the tribe rely to indicate
a congressional intent or, indeed, an intent on behalf of the

33

Commissioner of Indian affairs to preempt costs.

Indeed, the

Code of Federal regulations specifically provides with respect
to the Bureau of Indian Affairs that administrative costs up
to the extent of some 10 percent of the gross receipts of
the tribal enterprise might be subjected to a charge to cover
these administrative expenses.
So the congressional objective, v/hile it may be to
protect the forest resource, there is nothing in the regulation
as was present in Warren Trading Post with respect to the
prices that a trader could charge.

There is nothing in these

regulations to suggest that the cost that Pinetop incurs in
pursuing its activities on the reservation are similarly pre­
empted.

We are talking about two different things.
Mr. Brown mentioned that Public haw 280 was passed

for purposes of permitting States to assume criminal juris­
diction and civil jurisdiction over civil positive action.
Well, in fact this Court's decision in Bryan v. Itasca
County establishes that that grant of authority by Congress
does not extend to States if they desire to impose the direct
legal obligation of State taxes upon reservation Indians.
Quito the contrary, Public Law 280 was construed by this
Court to extend to civil causes of action, tort cases, contract
cases, access to the State courts.
So if the suggestion he that had Arizona adopted
Public Law 28Q this would be a different case, Arizona would

34

submit it is just not so.
Bryan v.

Itasca County»
QUESTION:

time.

This Court would have to ignore

Maybe I am not interrupting at a. good

I am not sure I understood everything, your entire

responsa to Justice Marshall.
You said there ware different kinds of roads on the
reservation.

One was the State roads, and everybody agrees

taxes are paid on the vise of those.

The other was the BIA

roads.
Are there also roads that are not public highways at
all that are involved, such as roads going into the depth of the
forest or anything like that?
MRo MACPHERSON:

Mr. Justice Stevens, yes, there

are.
QUESTION:

And you are asserting the right to tax

on those two.
MRo MACPHERSON:

Yes.

That puts the issue right

before us and I -- this relates again to the discussions that
Mr. Wake and I have had since arriving in Washington.
The Arizona Court of Appeals opinion, which is before
this Court > does not differentiate between BIA roads and tribal
roads.

The fact is however that the assessment that was made

by the Arizona taxing authorities related only to the taxes
attributable to Pinetop's operation upon BIA roads.

Use on

tribal roads was extracted,that was not subjected to taxation.

35

Nov;, it is true, I must confess, that that position
was not specifically or clearly advocated in the appellate
briefs, nor does the Court of Appeals opinion make that
distinction.
However, the fact of the matter is that under current
State law, under the legislative scheme that exists in Arizona
right now, Arizona has no intention of going forward on some
purported theory that because the Court of Appeals decision
says we can, that we can go ahead and tax use on these tribal
roads-

1 hai^a been assured of that by my client by telephone

last night.

And other than that we would put that before

the Court to apprise the court of what the true facts are.
The fact of the matter is however that that goes
to the question of magnitude of what the burden is.

By that

I mean Mr. Wake's argument presumably will be -- and I don't
mean to put words in his mouth -- but it is my understanding
that if we were talking about use on tribal roads too there
would foe a lot more -~
QUESTIONS

Lot me just interrupt you again, if I

may.
The fight is over the use of tribal roads.

That is

where you are really in dispute, is that right?
HR, MACP'HERSON;
QUESTION:
sorry

Well --

The BIA roads — I mean BIA roads.

I am

36

MRo MACPHERSON:

That is correct, Your Honor, BIA

roads.
QUESTION:

You say are public roads but under the

Arizona Supreme Court's opinion it is broad enough to cover
those roads even if they weren't public roads?
MRo MACPHERSON:

QUESTION:

Pardon me?

MR0 MACPHERSON:
QUESTION:

Mr. Justice —

No, if I may correct

I mean you don’t defend that position,

reading the opinion, I thought it would apply to that.
MRo MACPHERSON:

Well, the Court of Appeals opinion

states that with respect to all the roads, private roads, BIA
roads, all of the roads, go ahead and impose these taxes.
QUESTION:

And you don’t defend that position.

MR, MACPHERSON:

I don’t defend that position.

I defend it to the extent that the term "tribal
roads" .includes BIA roads.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR a MACPHERSON:
QUESTION:

Because there was no differentiation.

What I meant to say is your real fight is

over the right to tax on BIA roads.
Does the record tell us xuuch about those roads, for
example does it.tell us whether the State police are on those
roads or whether they have speed limits or things like that?
MR, MACPHERSON:

Your Honor, the record does not

37

specifically go into that much detail.
QUESTION:

However, it presents us with a hypothetical

case quite different from the one you asked us to decide.
MRo MACPHERSON:

Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, the case

is -- we felt it necessary as an ethical consideration to apprise
the Court of what the actual situation is.
But, having said that, the. issue, the legal issue, if
it pleas® the Court, may still be decided with respect to the
BIA road use.

The fact of the matter is that BIA roads

pursuant to Federal -- the Code of Federal Regulations are
reauired to be open to free public use, as a matter of Federal
law.
QUESTION:

Yes, but does that tell us whether the

State spends any monejr in their maintenance and protection and
policing, and so forth?

You know, the case would be different

depending on what the facts are.
MR. MACPHERSON:

The record does not specifically

present ns with those facts.

However, there are facts in the

record to indicate that the posting of speed limits, for example,
are done by other than — at least with respect to the tribal
roc.ds are done by jurisdictions other than the State of
Arizona.

QUESTION:

Well, what about the BIA roads?

MR. MACPHERSON:

My recollection, Your Honor, is that

we do not take the position that v?e may establish speed limits

38

on 3IA roads.

Perhaps Mr. Wake can fill me in on that.

only roads that wo exercise jurisdiction over

The

and, again,

only with respect to non-Indians -- the law in Arizona is that
even if we have a State highway through a reservation we cannot
assert direct jurisdiction over Indians on those roads.
QUESTION:

Yes, but these people are not Indians.

MRo MACPHERSON:
QUESTION:

That is quite correct.

Well, I don't know what we are supposed to

decide here, frankly.
MRo MACPHERSON:
position is this:

Wall, if it please the Court, Arizona's

The legal question as to whether or not these

State taxes may be applied under notions of this exists in an
area other than a preempted area or under notions of the
application of the Hayden-Cartwright Act can be decided on the
BIA road issue alone.
The fact of the matter is that if we talk about the
tribal roads, as I was attempting to explain, Mr. Wake's argument
probably will be — and, again, I don't mean to put words in
his mouth -- but if we are talking about the authority of the
State to impose these taxes on tribal roads as well, then the
amount, the economic burden of these taxes is going to be much
greater.

And therefore Mr. Macpherson's argument that the

magnitude of these taxes is of some relevance goes out the
window because the footnote that we have in our brief based
upon the record attempts to establish a percentage of what the

39

true economic burden is with respect to a particular time
period.

That percentage would change by going up if the State

were taxing tribal roads as well.
But that is a consideration apart from the question
of BIA road use and whether or not the Hayden-Cartwrlght Act
applies.
QUESTION;

Mr. Macpherson, quite apart from the

question in this case which involve© Indian tribes, what about
a private owner of land

whether it is the Weyerhauseur

Company or a rancher who owns many square miles of ranch land,
does Arizona impose a tax upon his fuel if the vehicle that he
owns is used exclusively on his own private property 365 days
a year, or this year 366, and never on the public roads of
Arizona?
MR» MACPHERSON;
QUESTION;

It does not?

MR» MACPHERSON;
QUESTION;

It does not, Your Honor,

That is correct.

Could it?

They were not -- or, excuse me, taken out of
But they were not taken .out by virtue of the

fact chat they were Indian roads.,
QUESTION;

That is what I thought.

MR„ MACPHERSONs

They were taken out by virtue of the

fact that they were private roads.
QUESTION s

Yes.

MRo MACPHEkSON:

And that is the current state of the

law.
QUESTION:

Does Arizona also allow a taxpayer to

allocate on the basis of mileage driven in say New Mexico and
subtract that in some x;ay from the amount of the tax due to
Arizona?
MRo MACPHERSON:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, yes, it does.

Is the same privilege accorded to a tax­

payer with respect to mileage driven on Indian reservation
roads ?
MRo MACPHERSON:

Your Honor, it is not; and that is

the question that we have here.

At least chs argument is being

advanced — my understanding of the argument being advanced by
Pinetop is that that is the vice in the Arizona statute.

It

does not allocate between use of State roads within the
reservation and roads other than State roads on the reservation.
QUESTION:

Well, I have not understood Pinetop's

argument to be a question of discrimination.

I have understood

it to be an argument of preemption and it seems to me that
perhaps a narrower ground might exist here where the Arizona
tax is faulty in that if it allows such a deduction for travel
in Nov»? Mexico but not on the White River Reservation roads is
it entitled to make that sort of discrimination under the

41

Constitution.
MR0 MACPHERSQN:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, 1 would submit

that it is not, for this reason.

In the first instance, the

tribal outside the State of Arizona occurs in a jurisdiction
beyond the jurisdictional reach of Arizona.
that, the question becomes:

Now, having said

Is the Fort Apache Indian

Reservation beyondttha jurisdiction of the tax reach, if you
will, of Arizona?
Arizona would submit that, no, it is not.

Number one,

this is based, on this Court's decision in Surplus Trading v.
Cook.

It would also presuppose the existence of a State within

a State or a: nation within a State.
QUESTION:

My question was phrased I believe:

Is

Arizona allowed to make this d.istinction?
You answered:

"It is not."

MR. MAC PEERS ON :
QUESTION:-

Excuse, me.

The follow up indicates to me that you

meant it is allowed to make that assumption.
MR. MACPHERSON:

That would present a different case

you know, that there would be — well,

I am not sura but there would likely be litigation on that
point, as well.
QUESTION:

Did I understand you to say that Arizona

42
has no responsibility for maintaining the BIA roads?
MRo MACPHERSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And did it contribute to the construction

of those roads?
MRo MACPHERSON:

So far as the record shows,

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Question:

Can the State

That is a separate question.

But --

What about the tribal roads? can you

respond as to that, maintenance of tribal roads?
MRo MACPHERSON:

The State does not contribute to the

maintenance of tribal roads.

However,

if it please the Court,

we have attempted in Footnote 35 of our brief to explain that
that is a State law question that has been specifically decided
against the position advanced by Pinatop Logging.

The fact

of the matter is that under this Court's decisions in Thomas
v.

Guy and Kelly v.

Pittsburgh, which is cited in Thomas v.

Gay, there is no ironclad requirement of benefits burdens
for purposes of determining whether the tax is applicable or

43

not.

Surely it is one of the considerations and it is one of

the considerations that Pinetop is making — they are basing
their argument upon.
But the fact of the matter is as a matter of State
law it is Arizona's position that that question has been resolvc:d
against them.

The thrust of their position is based upon

notions of preemption in Indian sovereignty.
And with respect to the discussion of both, or all
three of the counsel this question of self"government which
continues to he discussed, Arizona would submit should not be
considered in a vacuum.

The fact of the matter is that an

attribute sovereignty is the negotiation of contracts.

There

is no requirement of State law that these taxes be borne by
them.

If they want them away, that is fine.
With respect to a final question asked by Justice

Stevens in the opening remarks, the competitive advantage of
the tribe that would be enjoyed if the decision of the Court
of Appeals were reversed, merits a little closer examination.
The fact of the matter is that there is nothing in the statutes
or the Code of Federal Regulations that Arizona can see, at
least, that suggests that as a matter of economic principle
and in connection with the Federal objective of providing or
permitting the generation by the forest resource of the -whatever profit ~~

AFTERNOON SESSION
{1:04 PoMo)

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Macpherson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN Ao MACPHERSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS (RESUMED)
MRo MACPHERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I believe when wa broke for lunch I was attempting -to
respond to one of the questions that Mr. Justice Stevens had
asked of counsel for the amicus curiae United States with
respact to the competitive advantage enjoyed by the tribe with
respect to a situation if these taxes were voided.
The State of Arizona finds nothing in the Federal
scheme, either the Code of Federal Regulations or the Federal
statutes, which would suggest a prohibition upon the tribe as
any other business and profit-motivated entity from itself
seeking to recover these costs when it engages in the business
of marketing the timber product.

We concede that that is not

sufficient grounds in and of itself to substantiate the
imposition of the taxes upon the non-Indian in the first place.
QUESTION:

Would there be anything constitutionally

wrong about the Congress undertaking to give the Indian tribes
some competitive advantage?
MR, MACPHERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think not.

Vt'r y°~x'-'e-ou > however, that they simply haven’t

It

done that.

46

What Congress has done through the enactment of the
Federal statutes and what has been authorised insofar as Federal
regulations is concerned simply does not concern that area.
It concerns the preservation and maintenance of the forest
resource.

And contrary, at least in Arizona's position, to the

argument advanced by PinetaP, there is no articulable objective
in the Federal scheme mandating that the entire economic benefit
of the tribal resource come to the tribe.

Rather, the language

used is whatever economic benefit it may generate.

It is one

thing to state that the entire economic benefit should come to
the tribe, thereby suggesting that any and all cost which
somehow burden the accomplishment of that objective are
prohibited.

In fact the Federal regulatory scheme contemplates

just the opposite with respect to the administrative charge
provision when the Bureau of Indian Affairs is involved.
So the State of Arizona's position on Mr. Justice
Stevens’ question is that, yes, there may fo® a competitive
advantage if these taxes are voided.
However, Congress — neither Congress nor the
Commissioner of Indian. Affairs, in our estimation, has acted
to insulate the Indians from those cost burdens? and, in fact,
in pursuance ©f the Federal objective it would seem that they
could recover these costs just as they recover the costs of
the actual board feet charge that is contemplated under the
contract with Pine top.

It is sound business; practice.

There

is nothing in the contract.

Indeed, it is a good objective,

And they may follow that.
With respect to the Hayden-Cartwright Act, although
it is stated in the petitioner's reply brief that the State's
principal defense of its use fuel tax of the Hayden-Cartwright
Act, I feel it incumbent that the Court be aware that the
Hayden-Cartwright Act at least ia so many words, that it was first
raised by the petitioners in an attempt to demonstrate that it
did not apply by the petitioners in an attempt to demonstrate
that it did not apply.

But upon further examination, the

Hayden-Cartwright Act in the State of Arizona’s estimation does
indeed, even if all these other arguments be rejected, does
constitute the type of specific Federal regulation contemplated
under Williams v. Lee.

The rule in Williams v. Lee of course

is that absent congressional enactments the question becomes
whether or not the State law infringes upon the right of selfgovernment .
If all of Arizona's previous arguments be rejected,
the fact remains that the Hayden-Cartwright Act appears to be
precisely that kind of legislation contemplated by Congress.
He have cited and direct the Court's attention to another
Solicitor's opinion, 57 ID-129.
Solicitor

In that particular opinion

Margold as I recall discusses the application of the

Hayden-Cartwright Act to the operations of the Menominee Mills,
,s.nd in that opinion he specifically states that while sales of

48

motor vehicle fuels for usa in the direct operations of the
Menominee tribal saw mill would foe exempt from the State motor
vehicle fuel taxes in Wisconsin.

The fact is that he decided

that3 or he opined that in the context of a Federal instrument­
ality.
In the present case we don’t have a Federal instrumentality.

We have a non-Indian independent contractor, and there

is some dispute as to the terminology -- I think the record
speaks for itself in the verified complaint -- establishes
that Pinetop Logging is an independent contractor who is a
non-Indian who bears the legal incidents of these taxes.

As

a matter of contract doctrine, he passes them on.
The opinion goes on, however, to specifically opine
that the Hayden-Cartwright Act was intended by Congress to apply
to Indian reservations.

The Solicitor goes through several

discussions and tracings of evidences in the legislative history
of the Hayden-Cartwright Act which established in his mind an
attempt on behalf of Congress to permit the application of
these taxes on Indian reservations including, in Arizona's
estimation as we read the opinion, the direct application of
these State motor vehicle fuel taxes to Indians on the Indian
reservation, provided only that they be not imposed upon the
operations of the Menominee sawmill itself.

Indeed, employees

of the mill, Indian employees of the mill, at page 140 of the
opinion, are specifically opined to be subject to the tax.

49

In point of fact, the Solicitor refers to his memorandum for
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs of February 4, 1938,.

I

would submit to the Court that in the tracing of the history of
both the Hayden-Cartwright Act and the Buck Act, that particular
memorandum of February 4, 1938, which is now available, in the
opinions of the Solicitor, establishes some very interesting
points, primary amongst them being the fact that where the tax
under consideration is a true sales tax, that is a vendee
responsibility tax, then,

and for that reason, must the State

tax be voided with respect to its application to Indians on
Indian reservations.
An examination of the opinion, however, will also
reveal that it discusses it in the context of the Utah sales
tax.

At that point in time Utah had a true sales tax.

The

taxable event was the transfer of tangible personal property,
the liability for the tax by mandate of State law, was upon the
vendee.
It is not surprising, therefore, that in that opinion
he arrived at the conclusion that to impose these taxes upon
an Indian tribe on the Uintah Reservation in Utah would be
impermissible,

whether the taxes be imposed on transactions

by the Indians or purchases from the Indians.
In that regard, the opinion in the Moe case seems
to have eroded somewhat even that determination.

Joe Wheeler

The record is unclear as to whether or not he

.is a licensed Indian trader but clearly he appears to have been
engaged in that kind of activity on the reservation that fits
the definition of Indian trader.

We don't knew if he is an

Indian of the whole blood and therefore exempt.

Nevertheless,

he was an Indian on the Indian reservation, he was subjected
\

by mandate of State law to the pre-collection of the Montana
tares.

This Court upheld it in a unanimous opinion.
The fact of the matter is that when Mr. Wheeler

charged or added the price of the tax on to the non-Indians,

MRo MACPHERSOHs

Excuse me, and you are quite correct,

Your Honor, that is correct.

Shat is correct.

But the rationale of the decision makes it clea that
the reason that the tax was upheld, contrary to the prior three
sections of the opinion; in other words, we are talking about
section 4 of the opinion right now, in the prior three sections
we are discussing situations where the direct legal incidents
of the Montana taxes under consideration there were upon Indians
On the contrary, with respect to sales to non-Indians in Montana
the legal incidents of the tax x*as upon them.

And this pre-

collection requirement was not as a result of contract or any­
thing like that, but by mandate of State law.
So we view the Moe case as being highly relevant in
that regard.
With respect,

again, to Mr. Margold’s memorandum of

February 4, 1938, if one goes even further to examine the
surrounding circumstances of that memorandum, it will be
discovered that almost without exception, at least to the extent
I have had time to do the research on it, the impression that
existed with respect to that opinion was that invariably a
sales, tax was a vendee responsibility tax.

In the context of

that opinion, he was talking about the Utah sales tax.

The

iJtuh. sales tax at that time was a vendee responsibility tax.

This is also true with respect to the Buck Act legislative

52

history with respect to, for example, Congressman Dempsey’s
view as to the application of the sales tax.

He makes some

references to this tax is required to be collected by the vendor
and remitted to the State.
Mexico.

That is true.

Ee was from New

At that time New Mexico had a vendee responsibility

to sales tax.

So it is not surprising that

in the discussion

of the situation surrounding legislative history of the Buck
Act one finds upon an examination of the facts that I have been
able to discover in the legislative history that the over­
riding concern of the people who are testifying with respect
to the Buck Act was over legal incidents of State taxes required
by mandate of State law to be

imposed upon Indians.

We have no problem with that.

Those
Under the

present state of the law, Indians on the reservation are
exempt from the direct legal aapplication of State loss.
But there is nothing, I would submit, in the histories
of either the Hayden-Cartwrlght Act or the Bttck Act and,
indeed, the indications are just the contrary, of an Intention
on the part of the Congress to insulate Indians from nondiscriminatory, contractually assumed costs, just like anybody
else.
Arizona does not have at least, with respect to the
Pinetop situation, no requirement of Stats law whatsoever, that
these taxes be passed on

and visited upon an Indian entity.

With respect to the argument that somehow the Hayden-

53

Cartwright Act does not apply because supposedly there is no
sale occurring on the reservation, Arizona would submit that
that simply does not comport with the legislative intent as
supported by the legislative history of the Hayden-Cartwright
Act.
Quite the contrary, the legislative history as
demonstrated through Mr. Margold’s opinion, supports the notion
that it was the intent of Congress in the var ous amendments thait made after the initial enactment of the Hayden-Cartwright
Act rather than restrict the rights of the States,to expand
the rights of the States to impose these taxes even on Indian
reservation si.

My good friend, Mr. Macpharson, has just said some
remarkable things.

reservation which are not Bureau of Indian Affairs

55

If that Is what he has said, then I am delighted to accept his
accept his concession.

But I must also correct soma of the

suggestions he has made.
His predecessor, the Attorney for the State of Arizona,
argued in the State appellate courts that the State was claiming
the right to tax tribal roads.

The judgment of the lower court

gives the State the right to tax tribal roads.

And that is the

judgment wo are burdened with and that is the judgment which we
bring to this Court,
. Our opening briefs state that is the issue.

Their

briefs acknowledge that is the issue, and that was the issue
before the Court.
Now,
QUESTION:

That has some importance.

I wonder if

my understanding is coincided with Yours as to the concession
made by the Attorney General.
ME. WAKE:

Ho, Your Honor, what we have discovered

recently in the last few days is that the amounts of taxes that
were paid under protest by virtue of an administative agreement
did not include all the taxes that might be allocable to all
the use of all tribal and BIA roads.

Trial counsel, Mr.

Ba>is who is here, informs sao over the lunch period that his
understanding was that administrative agreement included the
payment of certain taxas allocable to tribal roads.
QUESTION: Well, as I say, that is of some importance,

56

at least to me, whether there is an issue to taxes, either fuel
or gross receipts taxes imposed on vehicles insofar as their
use was confined to tribal roads.
Is there, or is there not a dispute?

MRo WAKE:

They are also public

Those tax statutes 'merelj? require that the roads be in fact
used by the public.

Now, 1 gladly accept his concessions.

I am a little

disturbed at the implication that perhaps there is something
here that we 'have proffered to the Court for decision without
having fully made the record -QUESTION;

Well, why is —

MR0 WAKE:

-- on the issues.

QUESTION:

Well, why is a public road in the State

of Arizona not subject to public taxation?
MRo WAKE:

There are a numbef of reasons, Your

Honor.
The first reason is that you must go back to the
regulations which speak to Bureau of Indian Affairs roads.

The

Secretary has the authority to construct roads on Indian
reservations for the benefit of Indians.

Now, the regulations

require that they be open to the free use of the public.

As

a matter of fact the tribal roads are open in that regard also.
But the point of that provision of the Secretary’s
responsibilities to Indians is to benefit Indians.

It is not

to excuse State taxation that otherwise would be impermissible
because of the requirements of preemptive Federal regulatory
schemes.
Now, the fact is it is a public road in a factual
matter.

We can see that, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Could the Government terminate that public

character; is it at sufferance?

60

MR. WAKE:

I think that is entirely correct, Mi j

Chief Justice
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Where it is a State highway, that is land

that has been ceded and it no longer belongs to them.
MR, WAKE:

That —

QUESTION:

And that is the difference.

MR. WAKE:

That is precisely the distinction.

The

State of Arizona does nothing, the Secretary operates thsse
roads for the benefit of the Indians.
Now,
QUESTION:

Do you think there is a difference for

Federal preemption purposes between the private roads -- that
is the tribal roads and the BIA roads?

I don't understand your

opponent to concede there is a difference for Federal pre­
emption purposes but rather* to say it is a matter of Arizona
law the tax isn't imposed on the tribal road.
MR, WAKE:

Your Honor, I do not concede there is

any difference whatsoever.
Again we must come back to the principal task at hand
which is understanding and applying the Federal regulatory

61

scheme in a way to promote the congressional objectives and
with respect to those .Federal purposes it does not matter
whether these roads are tribal roads or BZA roads.
not State roads.

They are

They are up there for the benefit of the

Indians, the State doesn't have anything to do with them.

It

doesn’t police them, it doesn't regulate them, it won't write
an accident report on them if you have an accident there.
Mow, again, -QUESTION:

Well, why doesn't your preemptive argument

then cover State roads, too?
MRo WAKE:

Your Honor this comes back to one of the

first questions asked this morning.
QUESTION:

You say it

consider it and you don't assert it?
MR, WAKE:

in the other side.

It might, Your Honor.

I can see equities

Our client chose* not to finance that law­

suit, is the truth of it.

And their intention is to continue

to pay taxes allocable to the use of State roads.

And I might

add that was done before getting the benefit of counsel.

They

thought that was fair and that is the way they want to do
things.
And, in any event, the funds allocable to the State
road I don't think are significant enough for us to trouble at
this point.
Thank you.
