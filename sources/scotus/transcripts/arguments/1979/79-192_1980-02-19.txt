MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

next in 79-192, New York Gaslight Club v. Carey,
Mr. Proujansky, I think you may proceed now
whenever you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OP ALBERT N.PROUJANSKY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, PROUJANSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This ease is here on a writ of certiorari to
the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

The issue involved

in this case is a novel one and has not had judicial
determination before the determination made by the Second
Circuit.

It involves the issue of whether or not under

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. which author­
ises the award of attorneys fees as a part of costs to &
prevailing party, whether that statute extends to state
court proceedings.
This case was initiated in early 1975 by the
filing of a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.

In accordance with the statute, the matter

was referred to the State of New York which has an anti­
discrimination statute and has had one prior to the 1964
Civil Rights Act.
In accordance with the procedures under the

4
state statute, the hearing was held and the complainant was
awarded an, affirmative judgment»

The employer was directed

to offer her an opportunity to accept employment, which was
done, and she is currently an employee of the Hew York
Gaslight Club, and back pay to compensate her for the loss
of wages that she sustained as a result of the conduct found
to be violative of the statute, was awarded to her and paid.
While this matter was proceeding before the state
court or before the state civil rights division and subse­
quently the state courts, the attorney for the complainant
importuned EEOC for the issuance of a right to sue letter
which the EEOG granted to him in July of 1977» and in
September of 1977 he commenced an action in federal court
Seeking to redress the same grievance which was then before
the state board.
At that stage, at the time of the commencement of
this action, at the time of the Issuance cf the right to
sue letter, the commissioner of the Hew York Human Rights
Division had awarded relief to the plaintiff, all of the
relief to which she was entitled.
QUESTION:

Mi’. Proujansky, you just referred to
>

the commencement of this action, I believe.

As one reads

through the *64 federal act and the *76 Attorneys Pee Amend­
ment , you read the terms "action” or "proceedings” and
"actions" — do you think that Congress was extremely careful

5
and precise in the terms it chose as between "actions" and
"proceedings” and "commencement" in those various actss or
do you think that it may have occasionally simply used one
as the synonym for another?
MR0 PROUJANSKY:

I think

if Your Honor contrasts

the language with respect to attorneys fees as contained in
the Fair Labor Standards Act with the language that appears
in the Civil Rights Acts we have a difference between day
.and night.

In the Fair Labor Standards Act, the statute

says specifically that an action under- this act can be main­
tained in federal or state courts and any judgment shall
include an award of attorneys fees In addition to costs.
Now. the statute -QUESTION:

Of course a. the Fair Labor Standards Act

was passed in *38 and that doesn’t necessarily mean that a
Congress sitting in *64 or *76 might not have used somewhat
more ambiguous language and still meant the same thing.

FPo PR0UJAN3KY:
what Congress had in mind.

It is hard to determine exactly
There is very little legislative

history, as this Court has pointed out With respect to
section 706(a).

But if .a look at the purpose and the pro­

cedure of the two statutes contrasting the federal procedure
with the state procedure, perhaps some insight will flow
therefrom.
Under the EEOC, assuming the State of New York had

6
no anti-discrimination statute, a complaint would be filed
before the EEOC, no hearing would be held, an investigation
would be conducted by the EEOC, and then either the commis­
sion itself would commence an action in the federal court
or it would by a right to sue letter authorize the complain­
ant to commence an action in the courts.
The statute that we are dealing with, ?06(k),
follows closely after a number of sections dealing solely
with procedural as distinguished from substantive matters»
There is no constitutional right to attorneys fees, and
only this morning Judge Powell announced the decision in
which he noted that an American rule is that attorneys fees
are not normally paid, it depends upon the existence of a
statutory section.
Mow, it is moat unusual for Congress to pass a
law with respect to costs in the State of Hew York or in
any of the individual states.

Had Congress intended that

attorneys fees as a part of costs, that is the language
of the statute, was to be applied in state court proceedings.
It seems to me that Congress should have mads clear its in­
tent so to do, and absent such an indication, I draw the
consequent inference that Congress did not intend this
statute to apply to state court proceedings.
All of the

preceding sections of (f), (g), (h),

{JK (k) relate solely to matters dealing with federal court

7
proceedingso
QUESTION:

Well. I don’t read the Second Circuit’s

opinion as holding that if the respondent here had simply
gone before the New York Human Relations Commission and
appealed to the New York courts and never filed an EEOC
complaint that nonetheless state courts of New York would
have been obligated to award her attorneys fees.
MR. PROUJANSKY:
QUESTION:

As I read —

Just because the filing in the federal

court that brings into play the ’76 amendment* isn’t it?
MR» PROUJANSKY:

Mr, Justice Rehnquist, as I read,

the Circuit Court of Appeals decision9 they framed the issue
as to whether or not an attorney is entitled to compensation
for services rendered in a state court proceeding.

As I

read their decisions they authorised the commencement of a
suit in the federal eourts solely for the purpose of col­
lecting attorneys fees,

even if the matter has been success­

fully concluded in the state courts. They have extended
736(It) far beyond what I think Congress intended it to be
extended.
There is no need, in my view, for that extension.
The human rights law functioned very satisfactorily in New
York State prior to the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act.

Judge Monticello in the Lopino case, which is cited

in lay brief

at a lower stage referred to the fact ’’the

8
state division has a staff of competent attorneys to aid
potential claimants and thus it is not necessary to retain
private counsel to obtain relief from that agency."
A hearing is conducted before the New York State
agency, the hearing officer develops a record with or without counsel.

As a matter of fact, in this ease, with

respect to the principal witness, Mr. John Anderson, who
testified in this case.

The cross-examination by the

complainant’ s counsel took eleven pages of stenographic
minutes, the interrogation by the hearing officer took 23
pages of stenographic minutes.
The Human Rights Division in New York functions
very well and adequately protects complainants, and I am
totally appalled as a eitisen of New York State by the po­
sition of the Attorney General of the State of New York in
the amicus brief which he filed in this case, where he
totally dei^ejgrates the activities or the ability of the
State Human Rights Commission to function adeuqately.

I

think he should be here standing up for the State of New
York.

In fact, if there is anything wrong with the manner

in which the Human Rights Commission functions, why isn’t
the Attorney General paying attention to what the Human
Rights Commission is doing, instead of saying no, we need
the intervention of attorneys because New York has a fiscal
problem, and this is going to save it some money.

I don’t

9
think these principles should be decided on the basis of
the fiscal problems of the State of New York.
Moreovers I would like to point out that under
706(k)j 706(k) which to seme extent use3 the same language
as section 54 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, refers to
attorneys fees being awarded to a prevailing party.

Now,

there is no question that Ms. Carey was the prevailing party
in the state courts, but Ms. Carey was not the prevailing
party in the federal court.

The federal court action was

dismissed as moot, with the consent of Ms. Carey’s counselo
The only thing that was retained was that part of the cause
of action which sought to recover attorneys fees.
Now, this whole procedure that has been adopted
here was one that was calculated to get to this point where
the attorney for Ms. Carey can get attorneys fees.

Under

the provisions of Title VII. a complaint should be filed in
the state — with a state agency if the state has an agency
which provides for redress against discrimination.
was not done.

That

The complaint was initially filed before the

EEOC.
After the plaintiff had won. at the first stage of
che proceedings before the

,State Human Rights Division,

counsel for Ms. Carey began to importune the EEOC to issue
a right to sue letter.

Ultimately that right to sue letter

was granted in July of 1977.

In August of 1977s the

10
employers appealed to the Human Rights Appeal Board and re­
sulted in an.affirmance of the earlier decision of the
Commissioner of Human Rights.
On September 30th, Ms0 Carey commenced an action
in federal court.

At stage stages virtually at the same

time that the action was commenced In federal court, counsel
for the employer filed a petition

for review In the

appellate division of the Supreme Court of the State of New
York.

This review resulted on November 3* 1377 in an af­

firmance.

Thereafter, leave to appeal was sought and was

denied, and the matter was closed as far as the state courts
were concerned.

The award made was satisfied, the complain­

ant was hired.
The question has arisen in the Circuit Court of
Appeals as to whether or not In making an interpretation of
70S(k) we are saddling the federal courts and the federal
agencies with a great deal of work by awarding attorneys
fees or are we lessening their burden by denying attorneys
fees«
If this case is any example, in an effort to ob­
tain attorneys fees, they have involved unnecessarily the
EEOC in this case, they have involved the federal courts
unnecessarily in this case.

The question of attorneys fees

is a matter, as Judge Morgan pointed out In the dissent In
the Circuit Court of Appeals, !iit seems to me to be

11
fundamental that remuneration of private counsel successful
in state agency and state judicial proceedings in vindicat­
ing rights under state law should he determined by the law
of the state which established the substantive right,
created the agency and provided for Judicial review.”
I have serious question in my mind as to whether
or not if this statute be construed to impose costs in state
court proceedings, whether it does not run afoul of the
Tenth Amendment which reserves to the states the rights to
control their courts and procedures.
I wish to point out further that when the 1964 act
was enacted. Congress knew what the procedure would be in
a federal court and they knew because they were establishing
an appropriate procedure, they knew whether costs or
attorneys fees should be awarded, whether there was a. need
for attorneys fees to be awarded.
But in 1964 there were very few state antidiscrimination statutes and Congress did not set out any
procedural safeguards as to the method in which
discrimination claims should be prosecuted.
to the various states to determine.

anti­

This was left

Conceivably, many of

the states, as does New York, provide some alternative means
in lieu of awarding attorneys fees.

If those means —• those

means may or may not be adequate, but I suggest that that
is a matter that ought to be left to the several states.

12
I respectfully submit that the judgment should be
reversed.
I would like to reserve any additional time for
rebuttal.
QUESTION:

Counsel* could I just ask one question.

ME. PROUJANSEY:
QUESTION:

Surely5 Your Honor.

In the governmentEs brief they quote

the 1976 Attorneys Fee Act as well as the provision of the
*64 Act.

Is that statute involved in the case at all*?
MR. PROUJANSEY:

Nos it is not, Your Honor.

Section 1988 of the U.S. Code does not pertain to Title VII
actions.

I assume there was no necessity for extending

that to Title VII because the language is virtually identical
with the Title VII statute.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Meyerson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES I. MEYERSQN, ES'Q. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MEYSRSON:
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice;, and may it

My name is James Meyerson, and I repre­

sent the respondent. Ms. Careyt in. this matter.
There are several points which I would like to
elaborate upon to the Court In order to be in proper focus
to the case.
I think at the outset we should recognize that
the petitioners were found to violate the New York State

13
human rights law in that they discriminated against a citizen
of the United States because of her race in employment oppor­
tunity s and in so finding upon a deferral by the federal
agency authorized by Congress to enforce the anti-discrimina­
tion lav#s the State of Mew York in that proceeding in effect
enforced the policy enacted by Congress in 1954 to end
discrimination based on rases among other things s in employ­
ment.
It is a policy that has uniform application through­
out the United States of America* and it is a policy that in
1964 the United States Congress gave its highest priorities
to and which this Court has so acknowledged in many of the
decisions that have interpreted Title VII since its inception.
Deferral to the State Division of Human Rights was
envisioned by the United States Congress as an integral part
of the enforcement of-the federal policy.

It is in effect

an extension of the federal proceeding.
QUESTION:

Mr. Meyerson* let me put to you the

same question I put to your opponent0

Supposing this pro­

ceeding had never gone into federal court at all and simply
had been a proceeding before the New York Human Rights
Commission and then an appeal for review through the New
York courts.

Do you think that the *64 act of Congress

authorising attorneys fees would have required the New
York courts to award attorneys fees if New York did not as

14
a matter of policy or law award them under its own law?
MR. MEYERSON:

Well, in response, Mr. Justice

Rehnquisfc , the only way in which the respondent in tils case
got into federal court was as a consequence of securing a
right to sue letter fi’om the EEOC.

The situation which you

posture9 sir, I do not believe could occur because at the
time a complaint is filed with the New York State Division
of Human Rights, assuming arguendo is filed there before
the EEOC, there will be an automatic slide of that complaint
sixty days thereafter or perhaps even sooner to the EEOC,
representing precisely the issue that is in focus here, the
significant, interrelationship between that state proceeding
and the federal policy under Title VII.
QUESTION:

You mean even if the complainant

never calls it to the attention of the EEOC and the State
Human Rights Division never calls it to the attention of
the EEOC, Title VII requires that it go automatically?
MR. MEYERSON:

I suggest to you that once a com­

plaint is filed in the New York State Division of Human
Rights, that is automatically kicking off the Title VII
process because the State Division of Human Rights auto­
matically makes the EEOC aware, as a sister-brother agency,
whatever, a deferral agency, that it has an employment
discrimination matter pending before it because it is in­
volved by contract and otherwise with the EEOC, it is

15
obligated and does make known to the EEOC the existence of
that complaints Just as in the EEOC”s procedures here where
Ms. Carey initially filed with the ESOC, the EEOC made it
known to Ms. Carey and the State Division of Human Eights
that she was to go tc the State Division of Human Eights
and —
QUESTION:

Well, that is pursuant to act of Congress

but I take it that New York's procedure of advising the EEOC
is not pursuant to any act of Congress.
MR. MEYERSON:

I would defer to the United States

government in that regard.

There is a contractual relation­

ship to the EEOC
QUESTION:

Well, let's assume there is no provision

in Title VII that requires New York to make known to the SECO
if no filing is made with EEOC, would you still say that the
Title VII provision for attorneys fees requires New York
State courts to award attorneys fees?
MR. MEYERSON:

No, the New York State courts have

indicated under the human rights law that

attorneys fees

are not proper and the state legislature has not seen fit
to incorporate into its legislation the award of fees to a
successful prevailing plaintiff or complainant In the state
division, so therefore I don't think the courts in the State
of New York would have the option and they have not seen
fit to assume the option of providing attorneys fees to

16
a prevailing complainant in the division.
QUESTION:

And Title VII wouldn’t require them to

do that if it never got into federal court?
MR. MEY.ERSGN:

No, 1 donsfc think that the case in

the Circuit Court below superimposes federal law on the
state courts.

What the case below suggest is where the

state proceeding is inadequate„ where Ms. Carey was involun­
tarily sent thei’e — she started out in the federal agency
and if the relief in the state agency is not satisfactory
to make her whole, once she has been — once it has been
established that she was discriminated against because of
her race, she has the ability. Your Honor, to secure a right
to sue letter and seek the more comprehensive and complete
relief that was envisioned by the United States Congress as
necessary to effect its anti-discrimination policy.
I might point out to you that the sole purpose
that Ms. Carey went to the federal court was not to allow
her attorneys to get fees, it was to effect a complete relief.
This Court has recognized, based on the congressional legis­
lative history of Title VII, that attorneys fees are designed
to give effect to the purpose of the act.

They act as a

deterrent to those who have been found to have discriminated
and for those who might seek to follow
QUESTION:

Which act are you referring to now?

MR. MEYERSON:

Title VII, in terms of its purpose

17
in specifically providing for attorneys fees, it is designed,
as this Court has so stated on numerous occasions, to make
someone whole, it is to give as complete relief as possible
and thereby act as a deterrent —
QUESTION:

Doesn’t Title VII provide that an

employer who relies in good faith on a ruling of the EEOC
is not subject to liability?
MR. MEYERSON:

I’m not sure I understand the import

of the question.
QUESTION:

It is my impression — assume for the

sake of argument that it does, would you say that Congress
intended that to apply to New York proceedings, too?

MR. MEYERSON:

Without doubt. Congress — and I

think this Court has so recognized — drafts legislation
with specific words, and this Court has acknowledge that it
must give meaning to each word in a piece of legislation
unless it is inconsistent fith the intent of Congress.
Congress set up a multi-step state-federal scheme for enforc­
ing Title VII with both state administrative and Judicial
processes and federal processes.

It clearly envisioned

proceedings in addition to federal court actions.

There is

legislation that Congress has drafted in the same 1964 Civil
Rights Act, Title II, whie.-i makes no mention of proceedings.
That is because Title II is strictly a judicial avenue.
Thus, when Congress included proceedings or actions in light

18
of the multiple administrative-judicial scheme that it set
up., it clearly was envisioning that one would be addressing
the discrimination in a proceeding, an administrative pro­
ceeding as well as a judicial proceeding, and —•
QUESTION:

And a state administrative proceeding*

too?
MR. MEYERSON:

Clearly, because Congress mandated

that there would be involuntary automatic deferral by the
EEOC to a state proceeding where a state forum existed for
the purposes of assisting it, the EEOC, in enforcing the
federal policy.
QUESTION:

Well, what if in this case then the

employer had come into the New York Human Rights proceeding
and said, look, EEOC under Title VII issued a ruling saying
this was not discriminatory, I relied on it, and even
though I am in a New York proceeding and Irve never filed
a federal complaint, the federal law controls and you. have
no business ordering reinstatement.

Do you think Congress

intended to reach that far into the state proceeding?
MR. MEYERSON:

No, 1 don't think Congress means

to superimpose anything on the state proceeding, and I
don't think the Second Circuit does superimpose any federal
law on the State of New York.

What It suggests is that as

an independent but related mechanism for securing complete
relief, the prevailing person in this case Ms. Carey, who

19
was discriminated against because of race, who was not able
to get all of the relief envisioned by the Congress under
Title VII, having secured the necessary right to sue letter
to go into federal court seeking supplementary cumulative
comprehensive relief that because of the inadequacy or the
limitations of the state proceeding she was not able to
3ecure,

QUESTION:

Mr. Meyerson, could I follow up on Mr,

Justice Rehnquist’s question.

As I understand it, you are

taking the view that the word "court” in 706(k) describes a
federal court and not a state court, because I gather there
is judicial review of the state proceeding, i3 there not?
MR. MEYERSON:
QUESTION:

In New York, that's correct.

Now. if the word "court" just talks to

federal court, it seems to me somewhat inconsistent for you
to say the word "proceeding" which is in the same phrase
refers to state proceeding.
MR. MEYERS:

I might respond to that this way:

If

you go back a little bit further- into the EEOC and to the
Title VII legislation and look at 2000(e)(5)(B), (C) and (E),
I believe, when it is addressing the deferral, it refers to
state proceedings.

What I arn suggesting, Your Honor, is

that there are administrative proceedings clearly envisioned
in the legislation.

The E30C is an administrative proceeding

and the deferral state proceedings, and the Congress clearly

20
under —
QUESTION:

Under separate proceedings, or is the

state proceeding a part of the federal proceeding?
MR, MEYERSON:

I suggest to Your Honor that it Is

clearly part of the federal proceeding.

It is an intregal

part of the legislation, it is an extension —
QUESTION:

Well, is

the proceeding before the

New York court on review a part of the federal proceeding?
MR. MEYERSON:

I would suggest that it is, yes.

a part of that proceeding»
QUESTION:

Then why is not the New York court a

court referred to in this sentence, and why doesn’t that
court, then have the power by virtue of the federal statute
to award fees?
MR, MEYSRSON:

Well, it refers to courts and I

don’t think —
QUESTION:

It says if any action or proceeding

under this title, the court in its discretion may allow
fees as part of the costs.

I understand that probably the

New York court could allow costs, but you say it couldn’t
allow fees as part of those costs even though the proceeding
that is referred to is part of the federal proceeding.
MR. MEYERSON:
human rights lax»/.

It couldn’t allow fees under the

I do believe that the New York State

courts, yes, could on the precedent enunciated in the Second

Circuit and hopefully affirmed here could thereupon of its
own accord indicate to prevailing complainants upon a re­
view by a failing employer that fees under Title VII, of
which the state proceeding is an integral part, are appro­
priate o

I would like to —
QUESTION:

I'm not sure I understand.

MR. MEYERSON:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry.

You are saying that if wa affirm in

this case, then the New York courts could allow fees in the
state proceeding.

Is that what you are saying?

MR. MEYERSON:

Under Title VII, yes, even though

as —
QUESTION:

I understood you to take a contrary

view with Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
MR. MEYE.RSON:

I'm sorry, I was under the impres­

sion that he was talking about whether they were compelled
to do that.

I don't think they are compelled to —

QUESTION:
to.

Well, the federal court Isn't compelled

It may allow it.

It is a grant of authority„

MR. MEYERSON:
that.

I think the state court could do

Certainly it would not change the State of New York’s

basic position that under the human fights law Itself it is
not necessary to —
QUESTION:

To your knowledge — this Is a ’64

statute and the first time we’re getting this problem, some

22
sixteen years later.

Has anyone argued in the New York

courts to your knowledge that as a matter ©f federal, law a
prevailing party in a New fork proceeding,- a New 'York subpart of the federal proceeding is entitled to fees awarded
by New York courts?
MR* MEYERS ON:

I - don’t think it has been argued„

and we elected not to argue-it* Your Honor, because we finely
believe that Congress meant to allow us to come into a
federal court —
QOBSfIO.li

Wouldn’t it be more efficient to have

it dm»® as part of the New York aspect, rather than starting
a new lawsuit?
MR* MEXERSON:
Honor

Wall, let me suggest to you, Your

and I night point out that we wore forced to go into

the federal court in effect involuntarily because after we
sustained our burden before th© Mew York State Division ©f
Human Rights and the appeal board, which entered its- decision
ih August of 1977s immediately thereafter the respondents,
on a very questionable appeal as reflected by the absence

of any legal or factual discussion by the New York courts
on that appeal, was in effect a perfunctory affirmance,
immediately thereafter went into the New York State courts.
Why?

They had nothing to lose — no attorney fees.

It was

at that point in time-, almost 90 days after we had involun­
tarily received our right to sue letter, in which I said

23
we had better go Into federal court, fix© our complaint in
case for sose reason, which I didn’t anticipate, the ease
was reversed by the state courts*
In other words. It was again the- respondent, Ms.
Carey, being involuntarily dragged into the state court, as
she had been. involuntarlXy dragged., so to speak, into the
state proceeding which

precipitated the need ultimately

for us to go into the federal court to get the relief which
we would have automatically been entitled t© if we had gone
into and permitted to go into the federal court initially.
In other words, if ws were not in a deferral
state, four Honor — and. you must remember that Congress
envisioned a uniform policy throughout this country

If

we weren’t in a deferral state, having filed ray EEOC com­
plaint on behalf of Ms. Carey, we would hay» gone after 90
clays or 60 days or l80 days, whatever the appropriate time
period, .into federal court.

Having filed an EEOC complaint

In Or deferral state, we were compelled pursuant to that
statute 3 in order to enforce the policy of that statute,
to go; into Hew York.
QUESTION:

I suppose there are some so-called

deferral states which have an administrative system without
any intervention of state courts.
MR. MEYERSON:

There may vary well be.

In reading

the amicus brief, I believe the Stats of New York and the

State Human Rights Division,, I do believe there is only one
state where deferral takes place where fees are authorised.
I believe that is the State of Alaska.

S© X would suggest

r that —
QUESTION:

But there say b® others where it is

: exclusively an administrative proceeding.
MR. MEYSRSQN:

That Is correct* lour Honor.

Our position la effect is that at the bottom line
the Respondeat has enforced the congressional policy* she
‘ prevailed here.

She wee discriminated against and one of

the things that Congress sought to
i atioh based on race.

The only significance of th© words

MRS. SHAPIRO:
the prevailing party.

That*3 right.

But clearly she is

The first point is that she is th®

prevailing party In the federal proceedings, and under any
reading of 706 that means that she is entitled to attorneys
fees.
If you don’t agree that she 5.3 the prevailing
party in the federal proceedings or if you want to approach
the statute under the way that w® think is preferables it
is enough that she is the prevailing party in the state
proceeding..

In the state proceedings s they are for the

reasons that Mr, Meyerson explained and as are explained in
our brief, they are proceedings under Title VII.

There is

such a close Integration that she is — th© fact that she

prevailed in the state proceeding» means that she Is the
prevailing party under Title VII.
QUESTIONs

Mow do you answer Mr. Justice

Rehnquist * b question?

Could the Mew York court under this

statute say it has the right to giv® her fees?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

I think it depends.

As I understood

Mr. Rehnquist*s question3 he was saying supposing she had
simply gone into the state courts* gone into the state
administrative agencygone through the state courts, had
never filed a charge under Title VII.

In that casiv it is

hard to see how this would be a Title VII proceeding -at all.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You ss&y resume where you

left off,
HHS. SHAPIRO:

Th® important thing to remember Is

that Carey is a. Title VII plaintiff because she filed a
charge with the EEOC under Title VII and was required by Title
VII to go to the state agency for the relief in the first
Instance*

It doesn't follow that the state administrative

agency or state courts are enforcing Title VII.

They are

enforcing th® state equal employment law and they are simply
within th® confines of the state law, so that they are not
required by Title VII to award attorneys fees.
Press the point of view of the employee, this is
part of her route through the state proceedings on her way
to the EEOC and ultimately to a court that has jurisdiction
to enforce Title VII.

That almost always is going to be &

court.

Arguably that could be & state

We don’t believe that the jurisdiction to enforce

Title VII is exclusively in the federal courts*

At any

rate* she has to get her right to sue letter and before
she Is in a court with jurisdiction to enforce Title VII.
QUESTION:

Has that ever been decided?

Has

there ever been a Title VII action brought in a state court?

j

32
MRS» SHAPIRO:

There are a few eases in state»

courts holding that there is concurrent Jurisdiction.

I

gather there is also one court saying that there Is not „
but the majority agree that there is a right to haw a stata
court enforce & Title VTI action.
Our fundamental point is that the statute» Title
VII, authorizes any court having Jurisdiction over a Title
VII action to award attorneys fees for proceedings under
Title VII.

The state proceedings here were under Title VII

because the employee was required to resort to fch@;s under
that statutory schemeand for that reason she is entitled
to attorneys fees for those proceedings.
The only other point that I wanted to make Is
that it really makes no sense to penalise & victim of employ­
ment discrimination simply because she happens to live in a
deferral state and therefore has to go to the state agency
first.
QUESTION:

How many so-called deferral states are

there now?
MRS, SHAPIRO:

A vast majority of them are de­

ferral states.
QUESTION:

A vast majority are row deferrals.

MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Weil, how are you

penalizing her

other than requiring her to resort to state court process?

33
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Because if she was not in a deferral

state» then she would go directly to the EEOC» she wouldn't
have to go through the state proceedings and -»->
QUESTION:

And there would be no question of her —

• MRS. SHAPIRO:

— then she would be entitled to

attorneys fees frosj the beginning.
QUESTION:

She wouldn*t get them automatically?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

That’s right, it does but, on the

other hand, this Court has emphasised that when the statute
says may give it* it means that she is entitled absent
specific circumstances indicating that such an award would
be unjust.

So you are right, it is not a statutory right.
QUESTION:

If' she had gone first to the state

agency before she ever went to EEOC and was turned down
and then to EEOC, let’s .Just assume that the time limits
could be satisfied.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Then she would not be proceeding

under Title VII until she went to EEOC, and that is the
polht at which the proceedings are under Title VII and the
attorneys fees —
QUESTION:

In which event; — and then if she

•went to the EEOC then and eventually got; a right to sue
letter and sued, she couldn’t get attorneys fees for bavin
gone to the state
MRS. SHAPIRO:

That is our position, yes.

She

34
has to get Title ¥11 — she has to first go to th© EEOC In
order* to start the Title VII procedures.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:

Thank you*

Do you have anything further, Mr. Proujansky?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT N. PROUJANSKY* ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL
MR. PROUJANSKY:

Just a few words if I may, sir.

I think the concept that th© federal and state
statutes are integrated is erroneous.

Senator Dirksen and

Senator Humphrey were the cosponsors of the state deferral
section.

In the course of the debates on this sectiona

Senator Dirksen said this section was enacted to keep primary
exclusive jurisdiction in the hands of the state commission
for a sufficient period of time to let them work out their
own problems at the local level.
The federal statute is intended as a standby only
in the event that the state system does not work.

Now, in

this particular case, instead of going to the state as the
statute mandates, the complainant went to the EEOC and they
in turn deferred her to the state.

The right to sue letter

which triggered or necessitated the commencement of the
action in the federal court to preserve the plaintiff*s
rights was solicited by counsel for the plaintiff* and the
record contains letters between counsel and EEOC requesting

35
a right to sue letter*
I disagree with the position of the Solicitor
General.

There was no need ever for Ms. Carey to have a

Title VII complaint.

All the relief that sh© was entitled

to she obtained from the state agency.

There was no need

and, as Judge Worker pointed out below, the right to sue
letter Issued by the EEOC after the state had awarded
affirmative relief and during the time of the appeal was
unwise and did not justify the award of attorneys fees in
this particular case*
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case Is submitted.

:he abova-enfcitled matter was submitted.)
