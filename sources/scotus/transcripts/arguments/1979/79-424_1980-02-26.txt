MR. MESEHVE:

" :

Mr. Chief Justice, and my it

please the Court:
This case hers an certiorari raises really four
issues, the first being whether the District Court erred
in giving declaratory Judgment3 that the Board of Regents
had violated Mary Tommio * s civil rights by not giving her
a hfe&ririg; the second being the extant to which the District
Court and Circuit Court of Appeals should have been bound
by the Mev; eor-'c State Court-a interpretation of state law$
and the other two being a unique interpretation of the

Second. Sircu.it Court of appeals with respect to the defenses
(

of res judicato and. the statute of limit anions:.
Since this is a due process case, I think i" is
important to start with a brief outline of the as sene rat
facts to which that duo process has got to be applied.
Mary Tomanio practiced chiropractic in the state of her
York for e, few years before the fir >t chiropreetic licens-ing statute was enacted», effective in July 1963-

of qu&iifio- ..ti u... dr what

ere celled grandfather appli­

cants which was intended to take into account the fact that
they had been out of school for a while and t; at they had
been acquiring valuable experience through actual practice.
A limited series of four special examinations
was provided for the grandfather applicants.

At the time

the cls.sc action was bre ighf contesting the constitutionalifcy of the licensing statute * Waamuth v. Allen* cited
in our brief*

Subsequently * the four examinations originally

However,, three saonths later,, in February 1972: in

our first response to the abate court litigation£ those
reasons were given in writing andt in full, therefore she
had notice of the reasons for the denial of her application
in writing own four years before the institution of this
federal act ton.

ted I would submit that that issue really

is really no question that she has had reasonn for denial
of her application from the beginning in this ease-'
Wifei" raonect to the" hearing, the federal district

9
court judge ac: ths majority

the circuit court held that

she- should have been given a borval hearing or lor ap;; Ilea
tier for waives-.

Mo*;, there is r.o statutory provisio:. lor

such, no hearing was requested by her at any tree although
she was represented by an attorney throughout, and this
Court 3 as a matter of facfcs had not yet decided Eoth and
Sinderman»

So we are being hit with a bit of a lack of

anticipation of the decisions of this Court when you put
this into the perspective of 1971 when the decision? wap-

made .
Secondly, any right fee practice which she. may
have had had been terminated in our opinion by her failure
.to qualify by i isvb.-.g one of the serior of special examination».
She had no reasonable expectation,’ much less a
mutual expectation that the state would waive a requirener/i
if she proved unable to meet it.

And I don't think that

Ic&tion under those circumstances eont

fcinued a right or should have been construed as having;
reinstated the right really for purposes of considering
the cue- process to which she was entitled on the second
application.
I think the court; below erred in lumping the
original licensing application, and fens waiver ef-j. licw.-.c
together.

We ??ould also argue that she nad in ej. aCci,

at­
torney in the valuer application. she had a full opportunity
to present her arguments in

'

were simply that she had almost passed, she was licensed in
two other states, a standard which we did not regard as
equivalent, and she had passed a private licensing examina­
tion which the state also did .not accept as equivalent.
She was given eventually the reasons for denial
an! she had a fully adequate record for Judicial review
which is prove-', by the fact that it wa

In fact reviewed,

and the state courts found that cue d5 " not have the subs1antial eanivalent.
QUKSTi.CN:

Well, do you so® now ashing for a

hearing to give the reasons for denial or is she asking
for a hearing to give the reasons for failure to give her
a waiver?

MR. MSERVE:

I think she is now belatedly ask­

ing that we give her a hearing on her 1971 application and
*

start all over again, followed I suspect by fir or; more
state courts and three more federal courts.
QUESTION:

Well, what did. the federal court order,

The District Court decision merely

said that we should have given her a hearing.

MR.. RESRIWE:

Ho 3 too Court of Appeals in the

appellate division decided that

this was argues before

theia. fher© in no question about this —- that the evidence
that she had submitted n her application was not the sub­
stanti.;.! equivalent, and also. Your Honor, that the statute

QUESTION:

Of a waiver?

MH. HESEHVE;
QUESTION:

— of a waiver.

And you say the Mew York courts have

construed the statute relating to waivers so as not to ap­
ply to this type of situation?
CRn -.IfBIdvE;
type of situation .

It has never been applied to this

It used to be that the statute 'explicitly

referred to foreign applicatus.

There was a general ra-

codification in 1;>71 of all of the flew York statutes relat­
ing to professional licensing» and the present provision
no longer contains an implicit restriction to out-of-state
applicants.

But the interpretation placed, upon it by the

department and by the .appellate division and the Court of
Appeals in this case is the same as the interpretation
placed upon tie former section vie in fact t; e Court cf

QUESTION:

Well, would the board have had power

to waive in this case?
HR. MESBETE:

No.

The decision of the appellate

division in the New York courts held, and it is cited in
