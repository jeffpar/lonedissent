ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A, RYAN, JR,
%

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR, RYAN3

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
The Appellee in this case, Laurence Terrazas, was
born in the United States in 1947.

In 1970, he took an oath of

allegiance to Mexico, in which he explicitly renounced his al­
legiance to the United States. He contends that despite this
act he remains a citizen of the United States.

The United

States contends that by that act he expatriated himself, and
is no longer a citizen of this country.
The facts of the case are theses

Because Appellee

was born in this country of a Mexican parent, he was a citizen
of this country under the Fourteenth Amendment, and a citizen
of Mexico under Mexican Law,
In I960, he left this country to attend college in
Mexico.

In September of 1970, at age 22, he signed an appli­

cation for a certificate of Mexican nationality.

This appli­

cation is a one-page document of three paragraphs, the most
important of which reads in pertinent part, as follows.

4

I quotes

531

,

therefore,, hereby expressly renounce

United States citizenship, as well as any submission, obedience
and loyalty to any foreign government, especially to that of
the United States of America,” or North America, depending on
the translation,
QUESTION?

Mr# Ryan, what was the year?

MR# RYANs

This was in 1970, Mr# Justice Blackmun#

Th,September of 1970, he signed this application, by his own
testimony#
Continuing the quotation;

"And, furthermore, I

swear adherence, obedience and submission to the Laws and
Authorities of the Mexican Republic#"
This application was duly submitted to the Mexican
Government, and on April 3, 1971, that government issued the
Appellee a certificate of Mexican nationality, which repeated
that Appellee had sworn allegiance to Mexico and had renounced
allegiance to any other government.

Appellee received the

certificate,in Mexico#
There matters stood for approximately four months,
until August of 1971#

At that time, Appellee visited the

American Consulate in Monterey, Mexico, and told the Consular
Officer there that he felt more Mexican than American, that he
intended to stay in Mexico, and that he was concerned about
holding two citizenships#
The Consular Officer told the Appellee that there was

5

nothing illegal in holding dual citizenship, but he warned
Appellee not to obtain a certificate of Mexican nationality.
Appellee revealed at that point that he had, in fact, received
such a certificate..

The Consular Officer told him that he had

probably expatriated himself, but that a final determination
could be made only by the Department of State in Washington,
At the Consular Officer’s suggestion, the Appellee
took with him forms to fill out, so that a determination of his
citizenship could be made, and he returned to the Consulate two
months later with those papers.

Because expatriation is a sen­

sitive matter, these forms essentially consisted of three docu­
ments s

First, an affidavit in which the individual describes

the possibly expatriating act# second, a lengthy questionnaires
designed to elicit the factual background and the individual
state of mind# and third, a letter in which the individual can
state whatever ha wishes about the matter,
The Appelles executed an affidavit in which he
stated that his oath of allegiance to Mexico was;, and I quotes
"My free and voluntary act, and that no influence, compulsion,
force or duress was exerted -upon me by ariy other person, and
that it was done with'the intention of relinquishing my United
States citizenship,“ end quote,

\

In the questionnaire, the Appellee gave conflicting
\

answers,

He stated that he had taken the oath, “willingly and

voluntarily,”

He also stated, and I quotes “There comas a time

b

in everyone5 $ life when he has to sit down and decide what he
wants to do with his life*

1

did this and decided that my

future happiness was here in Mexico.

For that reason, I became

a Mexicanend quote.
On the other hand, the questionnaire asked, BDid you
intend by this oath or affirmation to abandon your allegiance
to the United States, or transfer your allegiance to the foreign
state?”

And the Appellee answered, "No.11

And in his letter

he said, at one point, ”By taking this oath, I did not consider
that 1 was relinquishing my rights as an American citizen»*’
QUESTION?

When was this document signed?

MR, RYANs

These documents were signed in October,

I believe, of 1971»

This was after the visit to the Consulate»

These papers were submitted to the Department of State, which
determined that Appellee had expatriated himself, under 8 U.S»
Code 1481 {a} <2)«

That statute provides that a citizen shall

lose his citizenship, by ^taking an oath or making an affirma»
tion or other formal declation of allegiance to a foreign state,"
Accordingly
QUESTION?

Excuse me.

On the expatriating act point,

the document he signed which you read really kind of contains
two different thoughts, one,that he swore an oath of allegiance
to Mexico, and secondly, that he renounced his United States
citizenship,
MR, RYANs

That's correct.

QUESTIONS The issues,, as I understand them# would be
precisely the same if the second half of the document had not
been in it.

In other words# it’s the oath of allegiance# rather

than the renunciation# that'is legally significant# because it
was not before a Consular Officer# is that correct?
MR. RYAN*
Stevens.

That is entirely correct# Mr. Justice

The expatriating act here is the oath of allegiance

to Mexico# although we do contend that the State Department was
entitled to consider the circumstances under which it was made.
But the expatriating act Is not the renouncing of United States
citizenship# because# as you state# the statute requires that
that be done in front of a United States officer, which in this
case it was not»
QUESTION*

Mr» Ryan# does the record show whether he

vras or was not fluent in Spanish?
MR. RYANs
in Spanisho

The record shows that he was very fluent

That was his testimony.

The State Department issued the Appellee a certificate
of loss of nationality# certifying that he was no longer an
American citizen.

When the Appellee received the certificate#

he went to the Consular Officer in Mexico and asked what he
could do to gat his American citizenship back.
The Consular Officer advised an administrative appeal
within the Department of State# and Appellee took such an ap­
peal.

The Board of Appellate Review# following a hearing#

issued an opinion affirming the issuance of the certificate of
loss of nationality, and the Appellee then brought this action
for a declaration of his citizenship.
At this point, let me refer to the statute that
Congress enacted to prescribe rules of evidence for proceedings
such as the one Appellee commenced»
Code 1481(c).

It is 8 United States

It provides two things, both of which the Court

of Appeals held unconstitutional.

First,, it states that in any

action where loss of United States nationality is at issue, the
party claiming that such loss has occurred — in this case,
that is the Government *—» has the burden of proving such loss
by a preponderance of the evidence.
The second provision proceeds on a premise that is
not in the statute itself, but that the Government has always
recognized, namely that no act can be expatriating unless it is
dons voluntarily*

Thus, the second provision of the statute

states that any person who performs an expatriating act — in
this case, taking an oath of allegiance to Mexico —- shall be
presumed to have done so voluntarily, but the presumption may
be rebutted on a showing by a preponderance of the evidence
that the act was not performed voluntarily.
The United States District Court for the Northerns
District of Illinois held a four-day trial, da novo, on the
question whether Appellee had lost his citizenship.

Faithful

to the statute's standard, the court held that the United

9

States had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that
Appellee had taken the oath of allegiance to Mexico, and that
Appellee had not rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence
the presumption that such an act was voluntary.
On the Appellee’s appeal, the Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit reversed.

It specifically stated that

assuming the District Court had applied the proper standard or
*

proof, the record fully supported its findings that Appellee
had voluntarily taken the oath of allegiance touMexico ,

And it

recognized that the standards that the District Court had ap~
plied were those that the statute commanded it to apply.
But the Court of Appeals held the statute unconsti­
tutional,1 under the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment,

The Court of Appeals concluded that that clause,

as construed by this Court in Afroy.im v. Rusk, required that
the Government prove by clear and convincing evidence that
.

■

Jtr^'

Appelles had voluntarily committed an expatriating act, and
that he had done so with the specific intent of relinquishing
his citizenship,
QUESTIONS

I take it those are two different issues?

MR, RYANs

Those are two different issues, Mr, Justice,

in our view.
The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District
Court for a determination of whether the evidence in this case
met the higher standard of proof that the Court of Appeals had

10

formulated»

tod the United States took tills appeal to this

Court»
The questions that this Court must decide are three»
First, whether an act of expatriation to be valid, as such,
must be undertaken with a specific intent to surrender American
citizenship, or whether, as we contend, a citizen may lose his
citizenship, regardless of his specific intent, if he volun­
tarily performs an act that is both designated by Congress as
expatriating and that inherently manifests a transfer of al­
legiance to another country, that is inconsistent with re­
tention of American citizenship*
Second, whether Congress may constitutionally- provide,
as it has done in 8 USC 1481(c), that in a lawsuit where loss
of citizenship is at issue, the party claiming expatriation may
prove such expatriation by a preponderance of the evidence»
We submit that such a standard of proof is not in­
consistent with the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amend­
ment, and that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that it was*
*

The third issue that this Court must decide is
whether Congress may constitutionally provide, as it has done
in that same statute, that an act once shown to have been dona,
is presumed to have been done voluntarily, unless the party
claiming that no expatriation has occurred shows by a prepon­
derance of the evidence that it was not done voluntarily*
We believe that such a presumption is constitutional,

11

at least on the assumption that expatriation does not require a
showing of specific intent to surrender citizenship#
QUESTION?

I suppose if ws disagreed with you on the

intent in the matter, the ease is over or not?
MR, RYANs

If the Court disagrees with us on the

intent matter —
QUESTION*

Namely, if we say that intent is essential,

MRo RYANs

If the Court says that intent is essential,

the case is not over, because it would still be

Following* the

Court of Appeals® remandF it would still be available to show
that that test was met here,
QUESTION*

But the case is over here,

QUESTION?

The judgment oft&a Ccmrt "of Appeals

'would be affirmed,
MR, RYAN?

The judgment of the Court of Appeals would

be affirmed.
QUESTION?

So we

woulflr^t reed to reach the other

issues?
<

MR, RYAN?

•

*

Well, if this Court holds that specific

intent is required, I think it then becomes necessary to
address the other two issues, for this reason.

The statute

says that voluntariness must be shown by a preponderance.

And

it says that the voluntariness of the act is presumed- unless
shown to the contrary by a preponderance.
The question then would become* Does voluntariness,in

12

what context, mean specific intent?

If it. does mean specific

intent, then the case is over in this Court.
It is our contention that voluntariness does not
have that meaning, and that the Court has consistently rejected
any suggestion that it does.
QUESTIONS

I just have before me

so I have an

advantage over you who don't have before you
opinion in Afroyim v. Rusk.

the Court’s

There is constant use and reuse

of the phrase "voluntary renunciation."

And, of course, in

Afroyim, as you all know, the voting in the election in Israel

,

IT ‘

was a totally voluntary act.
MR. RYAHg

Yes, it was.

But in Afroviro the voting

in a foreign election was not an act which demonstrated a
transfer of allegiance to any ocher country.
Our position is that before one looks at Afroyim
one should look at Chief Justice Warren’s dissent in Perez,
because the Court in Afroyim specifically approved that dis­
sent, in announcing its holding.

Peres was, like Afroyim, a

case where a citizen had voted in a foreign election and this
Court, sharply divided, held that was sufficient to expatriate
him under the statute, as an exercise of Congress’ power over
foreign affairs.
Chief Justice Warren dissented, in a lengthy dissent,
which recognized what Chief Justice Warren called the "longrecognized principle that citizenship may be lost not only by

13

explicit renunciation, but by other actions in derrogation of
undivided allegiance to this country,
QUESTION;

But he held that voting in the

He

thoTjght that voting in the Mexican elections was not an act in
derrogation of undivided allegiance to the United States?
MR, RYAN;

That is correct.

QUESTION;

And your submission is, I suppose, that

if Afrovim had done two things, voted in the foreign election
and sworn allegiance to another country, that he.would no longe
be a citizen?

Do you think the Court would have upheld the

one but not the other?
MR, RYAN;

I think that is true,

QUESTIONs

The fact is that several States, historic­

ally, have allowed aliens to vote in their elections.
MR, RYAN:

Including in this country up until 1928.

QUESTION s

That’s what I mean, in this country.

Mil, RYAN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION;

Mr. Ryan, do I correctly understand that

’lander your submission if the CIA agent took an oath of allegi­
ance to, say, Cuba, so he could perform his duties well, but
did not intend to give up his American citizenship, he would
nevertheless give up his American citizenship?

Because it

would be clearly an oath of allegiance, a specific expatriating
act,
MR, RYANs

In a situation where he was doing it in

14

an undercover capacity ~
QUESTIONS

Yes, but he did it voluntarily, just as

this man did„
MR. RYANs

Well, I would have some question as to

whether it would be voluntary in that case, because it would be
done in the course of his official duties.

And it may have been

something that he was directed to do.
QUESTION?

Wouldn’t it be vulnerable also to the sug­

gestion that it was not a real, not a genuine act?
MR. RYANs

I think it could be subject to that very

narrow category of extrinsic means of showing that it was not
a free and voluntary act.
QUESTIONs

What if in this case,when he signed this

piece of paper down in Mexico, he had put a little asterisk and
said, "P.S. I don’t intend to give up my United States citizenship"V
MR. RYANs

If that were the case, I think that the

State Department, on reviewing that sort of submission, would
say to him, "Look, you can have one or the .other.
■

a Mexican citizen or an American citizen.

v

You can be

Which shall it be?

You cannot take this oath ~~ B
QUESTION?

But what if they hadn't said anything to

him, but that's just the evidence.

He says at the bottom, 811

I didn't intend to give up my U*S. citizenship"?

MR» RYANs

I think what the State Department would

do in that situation, if they were

In the first place, it

would be done, if the individual wanted, with a hearing, at
least at the appeal stage»
to have this evidence»

So they would have the opportunity

But if it were contradictory in that

nature, they would —
QUESTION;

I thought your position was that intent

was irrelevant, that if he signs this piece of paper, his
intent is irrelevant»
MR» RYAN s

That is our position.

QUESTIONS

Then if he put that at the bottom, that

P»S» at the bottom, you would say it is irrelevant?
MR» RYANs

If it was clearly his — If that was his

understanding, yes, I would say that it would be irrelevant»
But the problem is that the State Department does not want to
go around revoking —
QUESTIONS

But your submission, your basic sub™

mission is here, it doesn’t make any difference what his intent
was»

I take it, even if you conceded that he did not intend

to give up his United States citizenship, he nevertheless has
done so by swearing allegiance to Mexico»
MR. RYAN:

That is our position»

QUESTION?

But the fact is he already was a citizen

of Mexico, wasn’t he?
MR. RYANs

Yes, he was, by birth»

16

As well as a citizen of the United States.

MR» RYAN%

Correct.

QUESTION?

You said he was born in the United States»

MR0 RYAN;

His father was a Mexican citizen, and under

Mexican law, he therefore was also a citizen»
QUESTION;

So he had dual citizenship at the time he

made the renunciation?
MR» RYAN;

Yes, that is correct. Hr, Chief Justice,

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. RYAN, JR» (Resumed)
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR, RYANs

Mr» White, I want to make sure that I

made myself clear in answering your question earlier»

If the

Court should decide,contrary to our submission, that specific
intent is an element of voluntariness, it would still, in our
view, have to address the other two questions, namely —
‘

QUESTIONS

Both of them,

MR» RYANs

Both of them, although as we say in our

brief, we would not defend the constitutionality of the presumption in those circumstances»

But the question would still

be whether clear and convincing evidence is required of volun\

taririess, or whether the statute is constitutional» v And we
presume the Court would address the presumption, even though we
d on * t d a f end it.
X think our position is best stated by Chief Justice
Warren

in his dissent in the Perez .case, which as I noted was

specifically approved by the Court, in Afroyim.

We think that

this Court should recognize, as Chief Justice Warren did, and
I quotes

“The principle that conduct of a citizen showing a

voluntary transfer of allegiance is an abandonment of citizen­
ship, and thus

that any action defined by statute by which the

citizen manifests allegiance to a foreign state may be so in­
consistent with retention of citizenship as to result in a loss
of that status,*
If the conduct described in the statute manifests what
Chief Justice Warren called a'Milution of undivided allegiance
sufficient to show voluntary abandonment of citizenship,** then
the Government may give formal recognition to the inevitable
consequence of the citizen’s own acts without regard to specific
intent,
We submit that taking an oath of allegiance to a
foreign government is such conduct,
QUESTIONs

Now, you address that to what, particular

facet -of the issues before us?
MR, RYANj

The first issue, Mr, Chief Justice,

The

question whether specific intent is a necessary element of an
expatriating act,
QUESTIONS

Not to the burden of proof issue?

MR. RYANs Well, that —* In our view, that question
has to be addressed before -the burden of proof issue rs
addressed.

In our view* that is the touchstone of the Perez

dissent and the Court’s opinion in Afroyim, one which the
Court of Appeals did not follow hero.
QUESTION;

As indicated by my question before lunch,

what bothers.me in this case is the applicability of this
statute to this particular case.

This person already was a

.19

citizen of Mexico and owed allegiance to Mexico, therefore»
MR, RYAN;

Yes, he did, Mr, Justice Stewart.

QUESTION;

In this particular case, why did his

statement of his allegiance to Mexico change the status quo
at all?
MR. RYAN;

Under Mexican law, Mexico, like United

States, does not favor dual citizenship, and it has this
certificate of Mexican nationality which formally recognizes
the individual as a citizen of Mexico.

But in the process of

doing so, it requires him to surrender his allegiance to any
other country, particularly that of which he is also, a national,
QUESTIONi

But before he signed anything, this person,

Mr, Terrazas, was a citizen of Mexico, owed allegiance,as such,
to Mexico, was also a citizen of the United States, and owed
allegiance, as such, to the United States,
Mexico or the United States j.<_

And whether either

"* dual nationality, he was

a citizen of each state, of each country.
MR. RYAN:

That is correct,

QUESTION:

And, therefore, why did this signing of

an oath of allegiance, or an af firmanti on of allegiance to
Mexico change the status quo at all?
MR. RYANs

Change the status quo of his dual nation*”

QUESTION:

Yes,

ality?

MR.RYANs

Because he took the oath of allegiance to

20

Mexicoe
QUESTION; Why did that add anything to what he
already owed?

He was a citizen of Mexico.

MR, RYAN;

Well, as a dual national, his allegiance

is in something of a tension.

He owes —

QUESTION;

Precisely, but in fact he was, wasn't he?

MR. RYAN;

In fact, he was a dual national, yea, sir.

QUESTION;

Had he ever given an allegiance formally

MR. RYAN;

Not before this act, that I am aware of.

QUESTION;

Would he have lost his Mexican citizenship

to Mexico?

if he had never signed an oath of allegiance?
MR, RYAN;

I don’t believe so, Mr. Justice Brennan.

QUESTION;

Then I share my brother, Stewart's

MR. RYAN;

Ha testified that he believed that he had

to sign this certificate, or this application for Mexican
nationality, in order to graduate from the college that he
was attending.

Now there is evidence in the record that says

that was not so, hut regardless of that his testimony was that
he.believed he could not graduate from the school unless he
signed this application for a certificate of Mexican nationality.
QUESTION;

How does Chief Justice Warren's adjectiva

"undivided®1 allegiance bear on this, if it does at all?
MR, RYAN s

It bears on it because by applying for a

certificate of Mexican nationality, by swearing his allegiance

21

to Mexico, he demonstrates that he allegiance to the United
States is certainly divided, and in fact nonexistent,
QUESTIONS

Why?

Didn't he already owe allegiance

to Mexico if he was a citizen of Mexico?
MR, RYAN;
X assume he did.

I assume he did.

As a national of Mexico,

But.' he, for whatever reason, he thought it

was to his advantage to ■—
QUESTION;

And you are not relying at all on his

renunciation of United States citizenship in this case?
MR, RYAN;

Well, as I answered to Mr. Justice

Stevens earlier, w@ are not relying on that as the basis,
because the statute, as we describe, I believe, on page 48 of
our brief, has foiar or five specific expatriating acts,

Re~

nunciation of citizenship is one of them, but — on which we
are not relying,
QUESTION;

When you talk about renunciation, do you

include with that the election that comes — that most dual
citizens have to make sometime in thair lifetime — and, as 1
understand, under United States law,as well — to choose one
or the other citizenship?
MR, RYAN;
that renunciation.

2 wouldn't want to say that I would call
I don’t know that I wouldn’t.

It would

have to depend on the specific act that he did in furtherance
of this election.
QUESTION;

Do the laws of the United States provide

22

that a dual national has to elect at sometime or other during
his lifetime, after he reaches 21, to —
MR0 RYAN?

Not to my knowledge, sir.

QUESTIONS

He could have gone through his entire

life being a citizen of each country?
MR» RYAN?

As far as I know7, yes, sir»

I am not

aware of any provision of United States law that says a dual
national has to elect at some point with one or the other»
QUESTION %

What could Mexico do, for example, about

enforcing any obligations of citizenship, except when he was,
perhaps,within the boundaries of Mexico?
MR» RYANs

As a dual national, there probably was not

much that Mexico could do»
QUESTION?

What could we do if ~~ the United States

do, for example, about military service, if he was in Mexico?
Would he be in default if he were drafted, for example?
MR, RYAN?

He i^as subject to the draft and, in fact,

he was given a physical at one point, and was subject to the
normal process of the draft»
QUESTIONs

If that occurred x*?han he was in Mexico

and he just didn’t respond, he would be in some form of AWOL,
wouldn’t he?
MR, RYANs
trouble, yes, sir.

I assume he would be in some sort of
He was in Mexico, and, in fact, I think

the record shows that he did respond.

He did come up and take

his physical, and so forth
QUESTION:

Similarly, I suppose, if he were in the

United States and he were a citizen of Mexico, and Mexico had
the draft, he would be in default in Mexico.

So his citizen»

ship — His being a Mexican citizen does involve some obliga­
tion, some duties to the country?
MR. RYAN s

I would assume that under Mexican law

he does have some obligations to Mexico.

That is one of the

reasons that dual nationality is not a particularly favored
status in any country.

But in this case, as the Consul told

him, there was nothing illegal about it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ryan, what is the purpose of the

affidavit on page 38 of the Appendix?
MR. RYAN:

On page 38, that is the affidavit that

the Appellee signed before the Consul when he came back with
the forms that the Consul had given him to be sent up to
the State Department for a final determination of his nation­
ality.
}

QUESTION*
an intention?

Why don51 you rely on that as establishing

He uses the word ”intention” to relinquish

United States citizenship.
MR. RYAN)

He doss use that phrase.

There are other

statements that he made at the same time, in which.ha•said,
“I have no intention of giving up my citizenship..”
just squarely contradictory.

They are

24

QUESTIONS

Was the other statement also sworn to?

MR* RYAN:

It was not sworn, no, sir,

QUESTIONS

Wasn’t that to be resolved by the State

Department?
♦

MR, RYAN:

The State Department did resolve it,

although the exact weight that they placed on intention I
don’t know.

But they resolved that he had lost his citizenship,

And the Court of Appeals has remanded this case to the District
Court, because it also has not passed on these conflicting
statements of intention»
QUESTION: Was this affidavit executed for the purpose
of making clear that he was not subject to draft in the United
States?

/

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Ditkowsky,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH K. DITKOWSKY, ESQ,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR, DITKOWSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice and Members of

the Court, may it please the Court:
The issue to b© determined, as v/e understand it,
is whether a native-born American citizen can be denaturalized
or denuded of his American citizenship by a minimum standard
of proof,equal to or less than that of a simple negligence
case.
We believe also that Addington v, Texas is espoused
under this particular issue.

The Court considered the applica­

bility of the Fourteenth Amendment to the .standard of proof in
Addington,
QUESTION:

When you say "or less than that of a simple

negligence case,1* is that an issue here?
MR, DITKOWSKY:

Well, when you talk about preponder­

ance of the evidence, when the reviewing court looks at pre­
ponderance of the evidence, the reviewing court looks to

determine if there is one scintilla of evidenc'd that would sus­
tain the verdict of the District Court.

If they find that

scintilla of evidence, then they sustain the verdict.
that may or may not have been a preponderance.

MR. DITKQWSKYs

He is not only Confined -- He is

confined without the 'laws of the United States, because not
being a citizen he doesn’t have the right to American citizen­

I would like to see proof beyond a

I would like to see the most stringent proof

required, rather than the standard of clear, convincing and
unequivocable»
As pointed out in the Addington case, there were three
standards of proof that were determined»

The first standard of

proof was the minimum standard,which was preponderance»

This

involves cases where society really doesn’t have much at stake»
Then you have the cases where society has a great,deal at stake,
and cases in which the risk of error can't be tolerated.

Those

primarily are the criminal cases.
Than you have the middle ground cases, and they are
divided into two basic sections»

The first section is the

private case, where you have civil fraud and action to declare
a child born in wedlock illegitimate, an action to enforce an
oral contract to make a bequest»

To these we apply the standard

of clear and convincing.
Then we have the more public cases

Unfortunately, that is not a true

This

He believed that he had to do specif­

ically what his attorney told him, what his Consul told him.
And on that basis, because of the fiduciary relationship that
was imposed on him, or he believed it had occurred, he was
misled and led to sign the documents that were not in accord
with objective reality.

This should not be sufficient to take

away his citizenship.

This does not read — at least in my

experience — like something that someone told him to write.

QUESTIONS

Well, you wouldn't say the two cases

are the same, would you?
MR. DITKGWSKY;

They are not identical, but our

court and our State Department has said that in order to
renounce you've got to do it in a particular manner so
that that intent is clearly made possible.
QUESTIONi

But you wouldn't be relying on the

renunciation as a separate matter, but you would be relying
on a renunciation in order to inform you as to what the
intent was in connection with the swearing of allegiance,
MR. DITKGWSKY;

I want to point out that there was

no oath in this case because there was no oath possible.

MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr. Ryan,

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. RYAN, JR,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR, RYAN;
of this Exhibit 14A,

I ’would like to clear up the status
But before I do that, I would like

to be very frank with this Court as to the precise problem
that the United States sees in the Court of Appeals deci­
sion.
That decision, as I stated, requires that the
United States prove, by clear and convincing evidence, a
specific intent to surrender citizenship.

It is the com­

bination of those two requirements that creates the dilemma
to which I referred earlier.
Should this Court hold, as we believe it should,
that specific intent is not an element of expatriation and
that expatriation can arise regardless of specific intent,
if the citizen performs voluntarily a statutorily designated
act that demonstrates a transfer of allegiance, then in all

candor, I must state that the clear and convincing standard
applied to proving the commission of the act of expatriation
itself is not an intolerable burden»
QUESTIONS

Mr» Ryan, under prior cases, is it

any of the Government's business to say what — when and
under what circumstances a citizen loses his citizenship?
I thought that was the business of the citizen to give
up his citizenship,
MR» RYAN:

It is the business of both, because

the Government has a legitimate interest in knowing who is
a citizen and who is not.

It cannot depend on the subjective

intent of —
QUESTION:

I thought, arguably at least, on the

prior cases, a citizen doesn't give up his citizenship
against his will,
MR. RYAN:
ship away from him.
QUESTION:

The Government cannot strip his citizen­
That is Afroyim.
Unless he actually knows that -“at

the minimum, he actually knows that some act that he- is
performing is — Well, unless he intends to give up his
citizenship.
MR', RYAN:

That is not, respectfully, what

Afroyim holds in our view, and we ask the Court not to
hold that now.
QUESTION:

You haven't gotten much help out of

53

the Court of Appeals, have you?
MR» RYAN; No,
QUESTION?

As a matter of fact; Courts of. Appeals

all read Afroylm that way, against you,
MR, RYAN:
Circuit both have.

The Second Circuit and this Seventh
The Ninth and the Fifth Circuit look

the other way, we think, although it is not a square holding.
We discuss those cases in our brief.
It is the standard of proof here applied in con­
junction with the specific intent requirement that creates
the tough problem,
QUESTION:
just wrong?

Why wouldn’t you say that Afroylm was

Here the United States said voting in a foreign

election is an act which the Government says amounts to a
renunciation of your citizenship.
MR. RYAN:

We don’t believe Afrovim is wrong and

we are not asking this Court to cut back ~~
QUESTION:

Then why should you be able to say that

swearing allegiance to a foreign government is a renunciation
of your citizenship?
HR. RYAN:

Because, unlike voting in a foreign

election, swearing allegiance to another government, especially
when that is dene in the context of renouncing United States
citizenship,is an act that —

54

QUESTION:

But that isn’t your argument.

You

don’t even make that argument, apparently, that swearing
allegiance in connection with renunciation makes it stronger
than if you just swore allegiance.
cast your argument, is it?
MR. RYAN:

That isn’t the way you

Certainly not in your brief.

Well, we said that circumstance would

be taken into account.

But even if it is ignored, we think

that swearing allegiance to a foreign government is an act
intrinsically different from simply voting in a foreign
election.
QUESTION;

You are saying that’s what the Government

says that act should mean,

I thought Afroyim, at least

arguably, says that we really have to have some proof of
what the man subjectively intended by this act, not what
some government says.
MR. RYAN:

It is Chief Justice Warren, sir, that

I read that statement as coming from.

In his statement *—

QUESTION;

Chief Justice Warren was in dissent,

MR. RYAN:

He was, but that dissent later became

the basis for Afroyim.
QUESTION:

Well, it didn’t, because that wasn’t

the issue in Afroyim, was it?
QUESTION:
eJ.ection

Afroyim was voting in a foreign

MR. RYAN:

It was the same case as Perez, but Chief

Justice Warren, in his dissent in Perez, said that there is
a difference between voting in a foreign election and naturaliz­
ing one’s self in a foreign state.

That was the particular

example he used.
QUESTION:

You still say that if in Afroyim there

were two people and one of them had voted and one of them had
sworn allegiance, the two cases would have come out differently.
MR, RYAN:

Would have come out differently, yes, sir,

QUESTION:

Even though the one who swore allegiance

was already a citizen of that government?
\ vv

MR. RYAN:

Under the circumstances of this case, yes.

The individual there —
QUESTION:

How can it be that if you are already a

citizen of Mexico that a certificate stating that you are a
citizen of Mexico changes the status?
MR, RYAN:

Because under Mexican lav/ there are certain

things that can be done only by a person holding a certificate
of Mexican nationality.

It is an official solemn document that

youaare a full-fledged citizen of Mexico.
QUESTION:

lie already was.

MR. RYAN:

No, lie was a dual national,

QUESTION:

He was a full-fledged citizen,

I don’t

know what a half-fledged citizen is.
MR. RYAN:

It is my understanding that there are

56

certain things that a dual national cannot do in Mexico, even
though he — half of his legal nationality is Mexican»
QUESTION:

There are things nobody can do in Mexico

legally.
To what are you referring?
MR, RYAN:

I am referring to certain acts — and I

don't have them specifically at hand, but there is testimony
in the record, in the documents, that the Mexican Government
requires that those who are born dual nationals have a certifi­
cate of Mexican nationality in order to carry out certain things.
For example —■
QUESTION:

Well, that's just a matter of proof of

what was already a fact, concededly in this case.
MR. RYAN:

Yes, and so he proceeded to be -- inrhis

interest to take out the certificate of Mexican nationality.
QUESTION:

To prove what was already a fact, i.e.,

that he was a citizen of Mexico, and also a citizen of the
United States.
MR, RYAN:

It, apparently, was not sufficiently a

fact to the Mexican government.
QUESTION:

My only question is:

How in this case,

at least, can it be considered to be inconsistent with American
citizenship to simply preserve the status quo?
MR. RYAN:
quo.

Because he was not preserving the status

He was pledging his whole obedience

57

QUESTION:

Mr. Ryan, why don’t you use the argument

you have already used in part, that because in this case he
not only swore allegiance, but the same as said, "And further­
more I intend by this swearing of allegiance to renounce my
•

V-c

citizenship."
QUESTION:

Well, the reason you don't is, as my

Brother White has already said, you haven't relied on that
throughout —
QUESTION:

He does now,

MR. RYAN:

I can make — I will tell you precisely

what my position is on that argument.

The statute says renounc-

cing United States citizenship before a United States officer,
that is an expatriating act.

That is not what happened in this

case, and so the Government does not rely on the statute that
says —
QUESTION:

No, but I asked you *— There are two parts

to this document, one,an oath of allegiance, and second, re­
nunciation language.
Would it be the same legal issue here if we left out
the second half of the document and you said yes.
MR. RYAN:

I say yes right now.

The only significance that that renunciation has in
the context of this case is that it is a piece of evidence which
the State Department and the courts could consider along with
all the other evidence in the case,to determine just what

58

happened here»

It is notr—A

we say in our brief , we are

not suggesting that the renunciation is an independent

legal

basis, because it doesn't fit the statute.
QUESTION:

You are saying that, but why isn't the

case different if you've got the two together, than if you
had just the swearing of allegiance?
For instance, the roan swears his allegiance -- assume
in this case he had sworn his allegiance and then in parenthesis
he said, "find furthermore, I intend by this swearing of allegi­
ance to give up my citizenship in the United States," close
parenthesis,

7vnd then the question is:

by your swearing of allegiance?

What did you intend

Isn't, that a different case

than if he just swears allegiance?
MR, RYAN:

That may make it a stronger case for

expatriation, but it does not change the legal basis on which
the expatriation occurs, which is the swearing of allegiance,
not the renunciation of American citizenship,
QUESTION:

You hope that's the rule.

What if we need an intent?
MR. RYAN: Well, we are saying that intent is not
needed.
QUESTION:

I know you do, but what if you lose on that?

MR. RYAN:

If we lose on that, then

QUESTION:

Why don't you say that intent is here?

MR. RYAN:

As I said before lunch, if we lose on that

59

issue we may well go back to the District Court and say the
intent is here»

But the fact is that the Court of Appeals

made no finding on that issue* and we did not think it proper
to come up and argue to this Court that it should make a
finding* which is in fact what I believe the Appellee is doing*
asking this Court to rev/rite the record and —
QUESTION:

The finding to be made would be in the

District Court in the first instance, perhaps is:

What is

the significance of the statement of renunciation of American
citizenship* and how does that bear on the first half of that
point?
MR. RYAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, that is evidence of

his intent to surrender his American citizenship.
QUESTION:

Strong evidence* I suppose you would say?

MR. RYAN:

I would certainly argue that in the

District Court* if it comes to that, yes* sir, whether it
is ultimately persuasive or not.
of intent.

It is not the only statement

There are contrary statements* and that is a matter

for the District Judge to make findings on in the first instance.
MR, CITIEE JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. RYAN:

Very well.

With the Court's leave, I could explain

the situation of Exhibit 14* although my time has expired.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

About 14?

It is available

to us now* is it not?
MR. RYAN:

Yes* Mr. Chief Justice* it is.

It is in

60

the Clerk's office of the Court,
there.

The original exhibits are

What happened is, 14 and 14A are both copies of a

preprinted form called The Questionnaire, designed to find
out what happened in an allegedly expatriating act.

The Vice

Consul, in this case, when he first met the Appellee said,
"Here, take this questionnaire back home and fill it out and
bring it beck to us." The Appellee did so.
he filled it out.

He came back and

Unfortunately, although not unreasonably,

he proceeded on the,answering the questions as if he had been
naturalized as a Mexican citizen, which in fact he was not.
He was a Mexican citizen by birth.

The Consular officer, the

Consular assistant, Maria Ibarra, testified — and this is all
in the record.

There is no Svengali influence here — that she

sat down with Mr. Terrazas and she went through question by
question.

She said, "Avctually, you are not a naturalized

citizen, you are a native-born citizen, so this question
shouldn't be answered."
he was there,

She went through page by page while

lie never said anything in response.

He just

took her instructions as to the proper way of filling out the
form.

She said, "Fine, now that you understand it, please

take this fresh form home and complete it with the correct
questions answered',' which he did.

None of this business about,

"I feel more Mexican than American," and so forth, was ever
dictated in any v/ay, shape or form by anyone in the Consul.
The record simply doesn't support that.

The question

of treason.

There is absolutely no evidence in the record that

anyone told him that he was committing a treasonous act.

In

fact, the Vice Consul flatly and repeatedly denied that he had
ever said any such thing.

The only place that ever shows up

is in various statements outside the record, or outside the
trial testimony that the Appellee has made.
I would be distressed if this Court were to character­
ize the record as my opponent has characterized it, because I
think those facts are simply not in the record.

The record in

a four-volume transcript, and a number of documents which we
believe are self-explanatory.

This Appellee was not forced or

coerced or hounded by any employee.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think we have your

point now, Mr. Ryan.
Thank you, Gentlemen.

The case

submitted.

(Whereupon, at 1:56 o’clock, p.m. , the case v/as
submitted.}
