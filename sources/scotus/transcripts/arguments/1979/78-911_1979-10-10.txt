PROCEEDINGS

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BUgGER;

W<a will haar arguments next

in Industrial Union against the American Petroleum Institute,
and the related case.
Mrc Alsup, you may proceed whenever you’re ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM ALSUP, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PARTIES
MR. ALSUP:

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it pleas© the

Court i!

Th© issue in this case is whether th© Secretary of
Labor's

occupational standard for bensene satisfies the

statutory requirements of the Occupational Safety end Health Act.
of 1970»

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth

Circuit hold that it did not satisfy those requirements, and
the ease is here on the petition of the Secretary of Labor and
v,

the Industrial Union Department of the AFL-CIO.
QUESTIONS ’

Could you describe those statutory raquire™

gents'?
MR. ALSUP:

The specific statutory requirements it

issue are several. The Fifth Circuit held principally that the
0

statutory requirement that was violated was a requirement that an
occupational health and safety standard be, quote, “reasonably
necessary or appropriate to achieving healthful and safe working
places.”
Th© Court held that the standard which is not reasonably

5

necessary, if it does not bear

&

reasonable relationship -- the

benefits of the standard bear no reasonable relationship to the
clause of the standard, and that, in addition, it dose not satisfy
that clausa if they are not quantifiable banafits.
QUESTIONS

What's the government's position on the

meaning of the statutory language?
MR. ALSUPs

Well, with respect to that particular

clause, Mr. Justice Rehnquiat, we believe that that is an
enabling clause that appears in many statutes that confer rule­
making authority on agencies.
QUESTION:

What's the government's position as to the

meaning of the words "if feasible"?
MP.„ ALSUP:

Achievable.

QUESTION:

In what sense?

MR. ALSUP:

Economically achievable, technologically

achievable.
I

QUESTION:

Did Congress give any more gu:ldance to the

Secretary than that?
MR. ALSUP:

Wall, in tha first sentence of Section

6(b)(5), which we believe is the heart of the Act, Congress gave
a very definita guidance to the Secretary of Labor.

That

sentence says that in sotting health 3Candards for toxic
substances, th© Secretary shall set the standard which moat
adequately assures, to the extent feasible, based on the best
available evidence, that no employee shall suffer material

/

impairment of health or functional capacity., even if he is
supposed to the hazard dealt with for his entire working life.
QUESTION:

Well, what does the word "if feasible" mean

in there?
MR. ALSUP t

Well, we think that it means achievable,

and the legislative history, we believe, supports our interpreta­
tion .
QUESTION: Achievable in what sense?
MR. ALSUP:

Technologically achievable means either

that the technology is available to Implement the engineering
controls necessary to meet permissible exposure levels, or that
as

although this is not involved in this case, as the Circuits

have held -- that the technology, even though it's not available
at this time, it’s reasonable to conclude that it is, as one
of the Circuits said, looming on the horizon.

And there it is a

technology enforcing statute in that sense.
QUESTION: Well, doesn't that almost take us back to ?the
Schacter case in th® Thirties, where Congress simply turns over
to the agency the job of making legislation?
MR. ALSUP:

Absolutely not.

Here there is a vary

clear directive that says that if Congress in fact meant
technologically feasible, achievable, and economically achievable,
>
it's a clear directive, a mandatory directive to the Secretary of
Labor to set that standard. This is not a blank check for the
Secretary of

Labor to do anything he vrants.

Congress has set a

7

-- weighted its own balance of health benefits versus health
costs and has struck that balance and described it in the first
sentence of Section 6(b)(5), and has directed the Secretary of
Labor to follow that standard in every health standard that's
issued for toxic substances»
QUESTIONS
MR. ALSUP:

If feasible.
If feasible.

QUESTIONs But it doesn't define the word "feasible'9.
MR. ALSUP:

Well, the statute does not, but it has

used that word in numerous other statutes and beyond that the
clear legislative history here shows that they meant by the
word "feasible", "to the greatest extent possible".

Vie don't

think the legislative history is ambiguous on this point.
QUESTION:
MR. ALSUP:

But how about the legislation itself?
Well, the legislation itself uses the word

"feasible" and we believe that that moans achievable.

It does

not mean -QUESTION:

Mr. Alsup, would you discuss your under­

standing of what "economic feasibility" means?

Is that dollars

only?
MR. ALSU?:
QUESTION»
MR. ALSUP:

Well, »«■
I so understood your brief.
-- the economic feasibility means, in

our view, that it is bearable by the affected industry.
QUESTION: By the entire industry or by each component

s
of it?
MR„ ALSUP:

By the entire industry, not by each

employer»
QUESTION:

You'd put some out of business?
Congress contemplated that there would be

MR» ALSUP *

a substantial economic injury to some companies»
Section 22 of the Act,

In fact, in

they provided that the Small Business

Administration is authorised to make small business loans to
companies that, if they can demonstrate that they will be
this is the wording of the statute

and

suffer a substantial

economic injury as a result of compliance with the Act»

There

is no question but that Congress recognised the achievement of
the health and safety goals would ba expansive»
QUESTION:

Suppos® you put every company in a

particular industry out of business?
MR» ALSUP:

That case has never arisen and it's not

likely to arise»
QUESTION: 1 know, but undor your more or less
absolutiva view, what would the situation be if that did arise?
MR» ALSUP:

Mr» Justice, we do not have an

absolutist view in this.‘.case»
.

We believe that standards must

*

be feasible 9 at a bearable cost»
•/

QUESTION: Bearable to whom?
-■ MR» ALSUP s
QUESTION s

Eearafol© to the industry.
Industry-wide

9

MR. ALSUPs
QUESTION:

Industry-wide.
Well, the example I just put started out

being industry-wide, but you lost

take th@ automobile industry,

there are only four major eompanies in it, 2 think. Would you
let two go down the drain, or how would you draw the line?
MR. ALSUPs

I should begin by saying that that

question is not presented by this ease.

Could I **- because it's

important to understand that that question is not presented by
this case.
QUESTION:

I understand it*a not, but your brief leads

one to wonder about it.
MR. ALSUPs

Well, first let me say that in this case

th© Secretary found that the cost® were well within the financial
capability of the affected industry.
QUESTION:

These ware very large corporations and only

about 10 or 22 of them, as I understand it.
MR. ALSUPs

There an 20 industries all together.

QUESTIONS

Twenty.

MR. ALSUPs

With hundreds ©£ companies involved, not

just 12 companies; hundreds of companies in 20 different
industries that are affected by this standard.

At a total cost

of engineering controls of $266 million, recurring annual cost
of $34 million, and first-year operating coats of $186 to $205
million.
industries

Spread across hundreds of companies in 20 different

.10

Now, you raise a question»

We do say that all the

Secretary has to do with raepect to economics is to shoi* that
fcha industry can afford it.

The Third Circuit and, I believe,

tha D. C. Circuit have gon© bo far as to say that what economic
feasibility means is that so long as th®r© is no “raasaiva
dislocation” of the industry, tha standard is economically
feasible.
This Court does not have to decide whether or not it
would take th® word "feasibility51 to that point.

Although the

Secretary believes that in © proper case we might make that
argument.

In this case this is ao clearly within th®

capability of the affected industry that it is clearly a standard
which is economically feasible.
QUESTION:

I3 it within th® capability of the affected

industry even though particular enterprises or corporations
within th® industry might fail as a result of it?
HR. ALSU?i

That’s correct,

QUESTION: And do 1 understand th© government's position
still to ba that within any conception ©f the meaning of
feasibility that th® Secrotary need give no consideration whatever
to the benefits to be derived, health benefits?

Your brief so

states.
MR. ALSU?j

Wall, could X explain how th© Secretary

considers benefits affd costs in deciding to issue a standard?
QUESTION:

As you do that, bear in mind that your

11

brief, on pago 48, in black letter®, says "Section 635(b)(5)
prohibits basing a standard on a cost-benefit teste"
MR. &LSUP:
QUESTION:

Oh, that ia correcto
That's your position?

MR, ALSUP:

That is correct that once the Secretary

decidas to issue a standard, he cannot trad© lives against
dollars,

Ha must either set a safe level or a level which is

achievable at a bearable cost even though it's not a -QUESTION: Doss that mean no consideration whatever
can foa given to the benefits?
MR, ALSUP:
how that works.

No, that is not correct.

Let me ©xplain

First of all, there are thousands of

carcinogens in industrial work places.

The Secretary and the

National Instituta for Occupational Safety and Health are
trying to gather as much information as they can on the various
extents of risk that each of these types of carcinogens and
other toxic substances pe@®,

In fact, the Secretary has not

regulated that many substances up t© this point. But in
making the decision *#hieh ones to r©gulafcs first, th© Sacretary
does considar whether or not a substance is dangerous, it
affects a lot of employees and there 1® a lot to be gained by
attacking this carcinogen problem first.
So that's the first way, in a rough sonca, the balancing
of benefits and cost come into play.
The second —

12

QUESTIONS

You now say that balancing is contemplated

by the Act?
MR. ALSUP;

In tha priority setting phase, Your Honor.

As I say, the Secretary «—
QUESTION?
regulated?

In determining which industry is to bo

In selecting the industry.

One® you’ve selected the

industry to which a standard is to be applied, is balancing than
permitted?
MR. ALSUPj

That's not tha way

the Secretary just

doesn't cast his gaze across industry and pick on one? rather, it
comes to his attention that there is a serious problem with
particular industrial carcinogens.

Then the Secretary says,

which industry is that thing being used in, and let's take a
look at it.

So that’s the way tha priorities are set.

QUESTION:

One© that industry is selected -- I'm

perhaps not understanding you •*- may the Secretary then consider
the benefits in terms of being beneficial to the health of tha
individuals in tha industry, as compared with the cost?
Your brief says not, as I remember it.
The state simply leaves no room for the conclusion
that the Secretary must balance coats against benefits in
setting an exposure level.
Now, perhaps fey balance you could argu® abgut what
that means, but my question is whether the Secretary, . one®
having chosen an industry, must consider whether or not tha

13
health benefits are rational, reasonable
MR. hLSUP:
QUESTION:

Yes
-- bear any relationship whatever to the

expenditure of money.
MR. &LSUP:

Yes. The Secretary does consider that.

QUESTION:

He does?

MR. &LSUPs

But I have to make a vary clear distinction

here between a decision to issue the standard at all versus
one® the Secretary decides to issue the standard, where dees he
have to go?'
Now, in th© first question, the prior question of
after all the evidence is in what does the Secretary do, does
hs decide that it’s worthwhile to go ahead and isssu® the
standard, the Secretary does consider whether or not the
standard required by 6(b)(5) has, in a rough sense, benefits
and has, in a rough sens®, costs.
The answer is clearly yes, and we have stated
in our brief, certainly in our reply brief, that the Secretary
does consider costs and benefits and balancing them for feha
purpose of whether or not to issue the standard at all.
But, Mr. Justice, my point is that once th© Secretary
decides to issue th© standard, having decided that it's worth»»
whil®, he has to go to the standards required- by the first
sentence of Section 6(b)(5)? and that Is, either a safe level
or the lowest feasible level that can b© achieved

14

QUESTION:

To the point where no employee may suffer.

That's the language of that ssnfeaaca.
MR. ALSUP:

To the point where it is most adequately

assured, to the extent feasible, that no employee will suffer
material harm.
QUESTION:

If he ware to go to th© extent where no

employee would suffer, he would simply ban the use of benzene,
would h® not?

Because there's no known use in which it’s safe.

MR. ALSUP?
that could be done.
bensene.

Well, if it war© feasible to do that,
In this? ease it's not feasible to ban

And therefor®
QUESTION:
MR. ALSUP:

How does he datormina that it's not feasible?
Mr. Justice, there was a very long rule­

making hearing, a voluminous record, in which industry after
industry came in and testified as to the ways in which bensene
is used, and it w&a very clear from th© preamble that th©
Secretary wrote and from the evidence that it would be impossible
to say to industry:

You can't use bensene at all.

I could add at this point that that's been true in
all of the carcinogen standards issued by tha Secretary.

There*s

never- bsan any suggestion by tha Secretary that he intends to
ban a particular substance altogether.
QUESTION:

Mr. Alsup, may 1 ask you two questions

about tha -statutory language?

The first santenca, the toxic

materials sentence says that "The Secretary shall set the

15

Standard which most adequately assures”, and so ha’s got to
piek the one which is most adequate»
Now, is tha word “standard” as used in that sentence
the same or something differant than the word "standard" as
defined in Section 3, subparagraph (8)?

Where tha "reasonably

necessary or appropriate" language is used in the definition of
the word "standard"»
MR» ALSUPs

The answer to that is that the word

"standard" as used in Section 3(b) certainly includes a
standard that’s used in Section 6(b)(5)»
QUESTION:

Does that m®an that any standard within tha

meaning of this statuta must be one that’s reasonably necessary
or appropriate?
MR. ALSTJP:

That’s correct»

QUESTION; Than that’s a different position from the
on® you took in your brief»

You seem to argue in your brief

that the reasonably necessary or appropriate language did not
apply to toxic materials standards»
MR, ALSUP3

Well, our position on the phrase

"reasonably necessary' or appropriate" is that Congress, in
statute after statute, has said to agencies that they may issue
regulations deemed by that agency to be necessary to carry out
the purposes of the- Act»

That is essentially what that

definitional provision provides»
In case after ease, this Court has said that that sort

16

of enabling language "necessary or reasonable" or "reasonably
necessary" ~~ the case has never

com

up yet actually that said

"reasonably necessary or appropriate"? but "reasonably necessary"
has, "appropriate" and "necessary"»
Not*, in all of those cases the Court has said that
what that means is that any regulation which the Secretary
concludes advances the purposes of th© Act falls within that
language»

It is not a balancing test, it's a rational basis

test»
QUESTION: Well, putting to one side for a moment what
the language means, I just want to gat; fixed in my mind your
position on whether or not that language modifies the word
"standard" as it appears in 6(b)(5)? and I understand you to
say yes.

But ail it requires is that it fulfill the objective

of the statute»
QUESTION:

It doesn’t so much modify the word as

QUESTION:

Part of the definition»

that’s --

QUESTION:
MR» ALSUP:

includad in the definition of the word»
That’s correct? the Secretary is only

authorised to issue standards that are reasonably necessary and
appropriates..
QUESTION: So that if this stand is not reasonably
necessary or appropriate, than even if it’s -- then it is not
permitted by the statuta oven if it’s feasible to the new

17
s fcandard.
MR« ALSUP:

Well, that would b© theoretically correct»

But — —
QUESTION: But you just differ on the meaning of
"reasonably necessary or appropriate”»
MR» ALSUS»:
differ,

I don't think it’s just a natter thzit wa

We think the Court's precedent on fcha words like

"reasonably necessary” and "appropriate” are quits* clear that
this is something that advances the purposes of the Act and
therefor® meats that definitional question.
QUESTION:
question»

All right»

Let me. ask you ny second

You place a great deal of emphasis in your brief on

the fact that this is toxic materials standards, and that the
feasibility is the only test you have to moot basically ir* a
toxic: materials area»

But what if this were a regular work

practice rule, vrhat would bta the guideline that the. agency would
follow there?

Thera's nothing else in the statute

that 1' can

find that providas a different standard for work practice
rules than the one it provides for toxic materials'.
MR» ALSUP:

Wall, the first santanee of 6(b)(5)

only

covers toxic substances and harmful physical agents like
radiation„
QUESTION:
MR. &LSUP:

I understand that.
It does not -«• correct,

cover safe work practices.

it does not

Those, however, can bo what, we call

18

6(b) standards„
QUESTION: The real thrust of iny question is:

If the

introductory language cf “reasonably necessary or appropriate”
is not the criterion that guides th© administrator, what is it?
For work practice rules or anything alse»
QUESTION:
MS, ALSUP:

Like slippery floors or something like that
WE11, for a slippery floor the

Secretary’s only requirement -- well, really twofold require­
ments,,

One is the second and third sentences of Section 6(b)(5)
QUESTIONi
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:

But you said they are just procedural.
Those are procedural, that's correct.
But we're talking about the substance,

what is it that avoids this being the Sehechter case, as Mr.
Justice Rehnquist pointed out?
MR. ALSUP:

Well, as long as the standard is something

that a court could find to rationally advance the purposes of
the Act, and the Secretary is authorised to promulgate that
rule.
Now, that's in connection with safe work practice type
regulations.
QUESTION:

Any regulation that may produce an

appreciable safety benefit is authorised by this Act.
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:
MR. ALSUP:

That’s correct.
Is coal mining covered by this Act?
No, there’s e separate law that covers

19

coal raining»
QUESTION 5

Yes,

But you couldn't apply that, the

sentence you rely primarily on, to the coal industry without
shutting it down, could you?
MR» ALSUP:

Well, you know, there is somewhat similar

language in the coal mining safety Act.
QUESTION j
MR. ALSUP:

Has it been so construed?
Mr.

Justice, w® don't contend that wo

would shut down industries.

I’d like to root that out right now.

We do not contend that w® would talc® a standard to construe
"feasible" to the point where we would shut down an entire
industry.
QUESTION:

Well, I understand the entire industry,

but perhaps the coal industry might ba different.

But you havo

agreed that the Secretary could adopt standards which shut down
segments of an industry.
MR. ALSUP:
who

Marginal employers.

Marginal employers

are surviving because they ar© able to survive because

they don't give their employees ths kind of health protection
they deserve.

That's specifically what this statute was

designed to prohibit.
QUESTION:

It dapsnds on whether health protection

ever can be absolute in terms of protecting against all of the
hazards

of this life, particularly in certain employment.
MR. ALSUP: But, Mr. Justice, wa don't contend that

20

absoluta protaction can aver be achieved undar the Act,

We

simply say feasible protection can be achieved under the Act»
QUESTION:

Could I ask3

You suggested that there

has to be an appreciable health benefit before he should issue
a standard; is that it?
MR» ALSUP:

Wall, I don’t want -- the word

'’appreciable'* has gotten a bad lead in this casa»
QUESTION: Well, what did you mean?
MR. ALSUP :

What I meant by that was that it

QUESTION: Well, you used the word.
MR, ALSUPs

1*11 explain that.

It rationally

advances the purposes of the Act.
QUESTION: So it doesn’t have to have an appreciable
health benefit?
MR. ALSUP:

It has to have a benefit.

It haa to

QUESTION: Does it have to have a health benefit?
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:

Yes.
What’s th® evidence in this case that

v

it might be a health benefit or that there was?
MR. ALSUP:

Well, sevaral points.

First of all,

the Secretary concluded that there i® at least general agreement
among scientists that there is a d©e®*»r©sponse ralati bnship.
That moans that lass exposure to bensene is better than higher
exposure to bemsonm, and that toy reducing the standard from
ten parts per million to on© part per million there would be a

21

benefit .
Even the Fifth Circuit said that they wers convinced
these would ba some health benefit by going from tan parts per
million to one part par millions

In addition, there are many

cases and studies in the record which show that even at levels
as low as two to 25 pasts per million, people have died of
bensena exposure to leukemia.
Take a look at Exhibit 154 in this connection, which
is a study by Dow Chemical Company which showed that for three
employees exposed at levels between two and nine parts por
million, there was a statistically significant increase «—
QUESTION:

Well, what about the level that is

permitted in this case?
MR. ALSUP5
1e not a safe levels

Th© level that ia permitted in this case
It is, however, the lowest feasible level

that could bs achieved»
QUESTION;

So you do say that *•« well, I guess you

would say the decision to issue a standard is always reviewablo?
MR. ALSUP: We would say that in a case in which there
is clear evidence that the -- in the rule-making proceeding —
that the standard wiiJJL not promote the purposes of the Act in a
broad rational basis ssnse, that a Court could say the decision
to issue that standard was arbitrary and capricious.
QUESTION: And that would b® based on the fast that
there would ba so little haalfch benefit® the costs weren’t

22

worth it; is that it?
MR. ALSUP:

Not under the test that the Fifth

Circuit used.
QUESTION:

Well, what about your test?

1 thought you

said that that sort of. consideration should go into the decision
whether to issue a standard at all.
MR. ALSUP:

2 have to agree.

Under a rational basia

test there could ba a very limited amount of balancing, but not
the kind of balancing that calls for quantifiable benefits or
the rational, reasonable relationship test that the Fifth
Circuit looked at.
QUESTION:

The balancing would go to which hazard to

MR. ALSUP:

Mo, not at all.

attack?

QUESTION:

Well, let's say you had a regulation

attacking some kind of h&sard that everybody agreed was very
minor compared to 20 other much raora threatening hazards, that
the Secretary hadn't attacked at all.

Would that ba a legitimate

inquiry?
MR. ALSUP:
settings.

Nov?, that’s a question of priority

Lot's ba sura we understand the hypothetical.

Let's say that there are several very serious carcinogens that
people ara asking the Secretary to regulate.

And instead he

postpones/ that momentarily to take on another carcinogen.
QUESTION:

Well, he just postpones it, we don't know

23

if it's momentarily or not»
MR. &LSUP:

And that is a decision on how to allocate

the internal resources of the agency and I don’t think it’s
reviewable.
QUESTION:
MR. ALSUP :

Is that reviewable?
No, that decision is not reviewable.

But one© the Secretary decidas to issue a standard, it may be
that that decision itself to issue a standard is reviewable
under the Administrative Procedure Act, under the arbitrary
and capriciousness standard.
QUESTION: And in determining whether or not it was
arbitrary and capricious, do you think there’s any room for
inquiry into the comparative need for it?
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:

Not on the comparative need but on the -Let's say ha issues a standard attacking

mice or rate fecoa in a factory, in factories around the
country, and it's shown that that’s not good and it’s harmful,
but compared to all sorts of twanty other different harmful
environmental conditions and carcinogens and poisons and
whatnot, that it's miniscule, it just isn’t that an appropriate
subject for judicial inquiry isr reviewing the standard, or the
v

decision by the Secretary to attack one problem and not others.
MR. ALSUP s

The decision to attack which problem to

attack first is not a reviewable decision.

However, once a

decision and standard is issued, pursuant to decision to regulate

24

a particular area, wa think that th@ Court reviewing that could
step back and say: Was it arbitrary and capricious to issue this
standard?
QUESTION: But you said there can be no quantifiable
balancing,
MR, ALSUP:

In that review the court has never

required, under the arbitrary and capriciousness test, that
any agency come up with quantifiable benefits.

All we're

asking for is the same sort of deference that the courts have
traditionally given to agencies and decisions to

issue

regulations.
Now, we would have to meet

a separate question is

whether or not we would meet the first sentence of 6(b)(5);
granted. But on the threshold question of whether to issue the
standard at all, at most the arbitrary and capriciousnese
standard of review would apply.

And that does not call for

quantifiable benefits,
QUESTION: But don't you concedo that you would have to
show that the worker would be batter off under this standard

Yes, and we do that. We do that by
Your Honor, scientists and medical export

after medical expert came in and said bensane is a carcinogen,
it kills employees; no safe level is known; and the prudent
thing to do is to take it to the lowest feasible level.

And that's exactly what happened hears»
That is enough to satisfy the rational basis test for
arbitrary and caprisiousness standard of review.
QUESTION:
away from this case.

Lat rue ask you on© that takes us a little
Twenty years ago, approximately, the

Surgeon General of the United States said that if spinach, as
sold in the supermarkets, was as dangerous as cigarette
smoking, and the prevalance of cigarette smoke in the atmosphere,
he, the Surgeon General, would take it off the market in 24
hours.
Now, since then, the Department of HEW has pursued
that up to the most recently resigned Secretary of HEW.

It is

pretty well established that there are casrcinogens which come
into the atmosphere from cigarette smoking, not only from the
smoker but from those exposed to it.
Now, would the Secretary, under this statute, have
authority to ban all smoking in a particular work place?

Not

has he thought about it, but would ha have the authority to do
it?
MR. ALSUP:

Wall, I don't know whether the Secretary

has thought about that particular problem.

But if the

Secretary were to conduct rule-making proceedings and if
scientists and doctors, physician*-ifers to coma in and testify
that smoking by other persons in a work placa causes a health
threat to the other employees working in that work place, and

26

that cigarette smoking should b© banned, this statute clearly
would give the Secretary the authority to issue a rule which
would limit or prohibit smoking altogether»
b© feasible to do that.

We think it would

Unless it could ba shown, for soma

reason, that that is necessary, and I think that would ba vary
unlikely; necessary to continue th© business»
MS, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

your time five minutes and assfcend your time th® same quantity»
If there are any other questions; if not, you may ■*■MR. &LSUP:

Well, I would like to take five minutes.

I think it is very important for the Court to focus —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You will be using your

rebuttal time in this casa».
MR. ALSUP:

Well, that’s fin©; 1 won’t have any, than.

1 think it is vary important for tha Court to understand the facte of this case because the facts of this case
hava somehow been forgotten and it’s been elevated to hyperbola
and extreme hypothetic®!® that hava not occurred in this case
and are unlikely to occur in the fufcmra.
Here is what the Secretary found, and these
conclusions are based 'on substantial evidence.
First, benzene causes cancer, it causes leukemia»
Thar© a.r© hundreds of deaths reported in th© record where
psopl© are dying from leukemia where the doctor

.attributed it

2?

to benzene,

It causes aplastic anemia, which is fatal.; it's a

blood disease» And it causes chromesonaX damage.
Respondents do not dispute these findings.
Now, then, the second inquiry came along because
industry witnesses or some of them said, Well, maybe there is a
safe threshold of exposure,

We’r® already at tan parts per

million, maybe that’s already safe»
Extensive evidence was taken on that point.

And a lot

of negative studies were presented by industry which were found
to have serious epidemiological flaws, and, in addition,
scientist after scientist testified that no safe level for
exposure to benzene could yat b® determined on the basis of the
best available evidenca.

That is also a conclusion the

Secretary adopted, and that's based on substantial evidence,
QUESTION s

There’s no empirical evidence, is there,

Mr. Alsup?
MS, ALSUP:

Well, there is.

There are

in the

Dow Chemical Company study, for example, let me give you -~
QUESTION:
respect?

Is the Fifth Circuit opinion wrong in that

There’s a sentence that l*n sure you've read several

times, on page ISa of the Appendix to the Petitions

"Tha lack

of substantial evidence of discernible benefits is highlighted
when one considers that OSHA is unable to point to any
empirical evidence daeusnsnt&fcing a leukemia risk at ten parta
per million*

28

MR» ALSUP:
QUESTION:

Well, in that connection,
-« even though the standard had been in

effect since *71»
MR, ALSUP:
QUESTION:
MR, ALSUP:

I think the Fifth Court is wrong on that»
Right»

You just disagree»

We disagree with that, and let me direct

your attention to Exhibit 154 and the Secretary's discussion of
that Dow Chemical study»

It was a study in which three

employees at exposed levels of between two parts per million
and nine parts per million over various durations died from
leukemia, at a time when only »8 persons should have died from
leukemia in that population»
Now, our reply brief says that was not statistically
significant.

We were wrong»

It was statistically significant,

and the- report so states»
Now, I should say th© Dow Chemical doctor said.
Well, there are flaws in our study, we can't really be sura
that there was a causal nexus.

Nonetheless, there is a

concrete example where, at least statistically significant
evidence, such as the type that the Fifth Circuit seemed to
want, showed that there was a risk at those low levels of
exposure»
In addition, the Stallone study, which was actually
on© of the negative studies that was presented by industry,
in which it also showed an excess risk of leukemia, something

29

like 21 versus 20 that should have occurred; that one was not
statistically significant, but, nonetheless, there is evidence
that there is an excess risk»
Those levels war© down around two parts per million»
It’s unclear exactly what th® risk «•- the exposure levels were,
but it was in the refining industry, where those companitas are
already at or almost below the on© part per million standard
now»
In addition, there was scientific testimony that there
is, in general, a dose-response relationship **- that means
less exposure to carcinogens is bettor»

And we have to keep in

mind that wg'r® dealing with a statute that requires that we
protect employees or th© Secretary protects employees, even if
they work 40 or 45 years in that industry»
QUESTION:

Mr. Alsup, this is **“ you’re bringing in

really a different argument than you rsade in your reply brief»
t

You’re now contending that there is evidence in the record
pertaining to th© area between one and tan parts per million»
But I do not understand that th© Secretary relied on any such
evidence, but, rather, ha assumed that wo didn’t know the
answer in that area, but thare may b© a danger, and th© ’’may b3"
was enough»
ME. ALSUP: Wall, that’s not quite ~QUESTION:
ME. ALSU?:

Isn’t that correct?
Well, that’s almost correct»

What the

30

Secretary said was that no .safe level could be identified on
the basis of the best available *■» nothing that w© could say
“this is a safe level"„
QUESTION : Right.
MR» ALSUP :

The Secretary did, however, say, and

relied on the Dow Chemical study as evidence that is consistent
with the possibility that «•»
QUESTION!

That there would be some risk in this area.

MRo ALSUP:

*•« there is a risk at those low levels.

QUESTION?

But I don't think he really mads a finding

that the evidence establishes a risk in this area, 2 think his
-- at least I certainly didn’t read him that way.
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:

Hell, he did not make a finding -»
And I didn't understand your brief to rely

on that, and us looking into the background to see if there's
evidence.
MRo ALSUP;

That’s correct.

We do not rely upon

being able to go out and perform studies which show that at
these low levels you are always going to be able to prove the
risk.

The important thing about this case, Mr. Justice, is

that that can't be done for carcinogens, for most carcinogens;
for soma it can.

For benzene, the data is just not there.

And if this Court adopts a rule that says you have to show
quantifiable benefits at these low levels, than the Secretary
is going to be disabled from acting tc protect workers against

31
carcinogens in a whole host of areas»
QUESTION:

Because --

Well, there are other things he could do

besides banning it or cutting it down, for example

you could

make a big point -- or I guess that*a your colleague, making a
big point about whether workers exposed for a full lifetima or
just periodically would make a big difference»
Mayfo® you could just say they could only work for a
year in these exposed areas, or something like that»

That would

be something to do»
MR, ALSUP:

No, that would foe less feasible,

That

might he lass feasible in those industries where
QUESTION:

Less feasible to give temporary assignments

than to spend a half billion dollars?
MR» ALSUP:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Alsup.

Mr. Cohen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE H. COHEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER INDUSTRIAL UNION
DEPARTMENT, APL-CIQ
MR. COHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;:
What I plan to do with th© time allocated to me is to
highlight to the Court our belief that Section 6(b)(5) of the
Act ia in fact the focus and contains the charters and indeed
the command to the Secretary of Labor as to how he should set
and how he must set standards governing occupational exposure
to toxic substances.
However, in order to frame the argument, 1 think that
it's important to keep in mind that w« bring to this Court a
Secretary of Labor's determination, based on findings of fact,
supported by substantial ©vidc-snca which was not upset by the
Fifth Circuit.

That not only determined that exposure to

benzene causes leukemia or cancer, that not only that hundreds
of workers had already died of cancer, and that indeed 30,000
or mors workers will fee exposed to this hazard ©very single day
of their working life; and that, based on experts

scientific

opinion tesfcisaony, th® determination was made that there is no
level, there ia no level that can b® considered safe for
employees who aza in fast exposed to benzene

33

Sow, the Secretary of Labor didn’t rest on that, the
Secretary endeavored to ascertain what that would mean . in terms
of the risk, the magnitud© of the risk on employees in this
work place»
The Secretary just didn’t say, "Let’s forget about it”,
the Secretary endeavored to do that and took an enormous amount
of testimony, and ended up concluding that there simply was no
way to do it» There was no way to make an educated estimate or
to quantify the benefits»
QUESTION: Why didn't he then simply ban the use of
benzene?
MR» COHEN:

Well, Mr» Justice Relinquish, there is a

statutory procedure here» The guiding light of 6(b)(5) says you
do what will most adequately protect»

But there is one

constraint, there is on© restraint, this» is not an absolute
statute, you must do what is feasible» And the Secretary went
on to find that one part par million was in fact feasible,
and it’s our understanding that finding has not been challenged,
was not ups01 by th© Court of Appeals,
QUESTION:

How does the Secretary know what is

feasible under this statutory language?
MR» COHEN:

Well, 1 know you were exploring that with

counsel for the Solicitor»

The answer to that, of course, is

not a simple on®, but there is an evidentiary record made»
Engineering controls, wor2s practises •”*» in ©thar words, a whole

34

serias of iteras have evolved during the proceedings, in which
companies come in, engineering experts coma in, plant
superintendents come in, and they says
eliminate?

Now,' what can we do to

This is not a mystical practice„

We’re talking hers

about gust and amission from the sourca of a machine going into
the sir» And testimony comes in, how can we eliminate it?

And

to what extant can we eliminate it?
And, for example, in th® Appendix, at page 141 in
this case, there’s discussion about th© nsed to replace burners,
the need to replace pumpsa

Thera ar® systems, as the product

goes through the plant where thas® amissions are detectable,
and where possible, feasible, available kinds of things can

be

dona, and customarily what’s grown up, Kr„ Justice Relinquish,
is a series of things that sr® done»

You look to eae hood

ventilating machinery equipment? you look at what kind of
work practices can be brought to baar? you look at a whole slew
of .possible ways to deal with the hasard, and that ends up in a
determination on the record by tha Sacjretary as to what level
can bo achieved»
For example, in many of those standards, employers
have •*“ or certain employers in an industry have reached a
{

certain leva! and they brin#'people who .testify, and undor
direct and cross-examination it is explained and determined on
what basis they were able to reach that level? and those kinds
of findings in turn bscom® th® predicate for the Secretary’s

35

technological feasibility determination, And I want to
emphasize, Your Honor, as ®a understand it, that question is
not before this Court,

Industry doss not, challenge its

capacity, through engineering controls and work practices, to
reach the one ppm level,
QUESTION: Well, when you say “industry” 1 understand
you to mean an entire industry in the sens® of the coke
procsnsors, or the oil industry,

I also understand that the

Secretary considers th® statute to authorise him to impose
controls which would make it impossible for a particular
company within that business to continue to do business, using
those controls,
MR, COHEN: Wall, I think we have to take a look back,
I think we have to sea what was going on in Congress’s mind
wh@n they passed this statute,

And what was goinc on in

Congress’s mind was this parade of experiences hac demonstrated
that there were all those known toxic substances cut there,
that indeed with the new technology and processes coming to tha
fore, it was expected that ©very twenty seconds another substance,
a potentially toxic substance was going to be introduced into the
working- environment„•
And, as you know, Your Honor, there is no pretesting
requirement under this statutes or any other.
So the Congress of tha United States knew and under*»
stood this, and they knew another things

they knew that the

36

stafc© of the scientific knowledge at this point in time was
such that since most of these particular diseases had what we
refer to as a long latency period -- in other words, 20 or more
years from the time that you initially begin to inhale these
particular substances until the disease actually manifests
itself.

That they knew that there was not.1., going to be immediate,

imminent scientific certainty in this area.
And in the face of that, and because fcho Congress
decided that the overriding concern hers had to be to maximize
the protection to employee work, avon in the face of the
scientific uncertainty, they, in 6(b)(5), started out, not only
with the mandates of the Secretary »« and I want to discuss that
mandat® -- but with the use of a very carefully chosen phrase,
we believe, Hbest available ©vidssnee „"
In other words, what this Congress contemplated that
the Secretary, on the basis of a.record submitted before hin,
would take the best available evidence, everything that the
Secretary knew for sure, and also having to deal with the
reality that things would not b® known.

And, for example, in

response to Mr. Justice Stevens’ question, one of the things
that was not known her© was what would happen to employees who
were currently exposed at 10 ppm.
And I believe the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals
opinion at Pet*Ap 18a was a correct statement, but it misses the
mark.

it was correct in this sense:

there is no direct

37

empirical evidence as to what ifould happen to people at .10 ppm,
because the vast majority off people today have been exposed in
excess of that number, and there have bean no studies that have
demonstrated what would happen to you»
There was no direct empirical evidence,,

Worse them

that, there is no reason to believe there will bs such direct
empirical evidence for many ye&ra to come, precisely because of
th© problem with the latency period,,
In 1971 the statute was passed, but for anyone to make
an intelligent and rational judgment as to what the impact will
be, they have to take into consideration wo have a latency period
here of approximately 20 years»
So that any study, any study that would begin to say
there is no problem at 10 ppm unless there was a latency period
of a minimum of 20 years, certainly could not be a valid basis
for going ahead and regulating»
QUESTION:

But ««

Mr» Cohen, all of what you nay makes

sense, except for the words "if feasible"»
MR. COHEN:

QUESTION:

Rll right.
Which sound to mo as if Congress is simply

completely passing the buck to th© Secretary.
MR. COHEN:

Completely the opposite, Your Honor.

Let

me spall that out.
We have to start out first of all -QUESTION:

If I may, just to be sure I understood your

38

last one, and I don't want to interrupt your answer to ray
brother Rahnquist; but it's your submission, therefore, that
even if the answer to this question, what happens to employees
exposed to 10 ppm of benzene, and ©van if the answer to that
question turns out to b© nothing happens to them at all, nothing;
nonetheless, this is a perfectly and completely valid regulation,
MR. COHEN;

All right»

Now, you've asked raa if that's

part of the balance and I'll respond just as candidly as I can.
Yes,

But is there reason to think that, I'd have to say no»

We have 30,000 —
QUESTION; But your point is we don't know, and it's
©van»
MR. COHEN:

That's right, we don't know» We do know

this much -QUESTION: And ao if we don’t know, it's possible -if w© don't know, then it's certainly possible that the answer
io nothing.
MR. COHEN:

That's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

But 33,000 workers are exposed, w® know that, and we know that,
notwithstanding industry's ©ffort to identify 10 ppm as a safe
level, th© Secretary, after carefully reviewing and analysing
all of those studios, concluded that those studies simply do
not stand for that proposition, and indeed, Mr. Justice, indeed
that for th© Secretary to have acted on the basis of those
studies would have been a reckless and irresponsible act, because

39

the studies didn’t stand for the answer that industry was sub­
mitting them for.
So what w© bars said in our briaf, and we think this is
the posture that this caa© comes to this Court, that we are in &
situation where there is a potentially great adverse consequence,
albeit of unknown dimensions. And I think -QUESTION s
MR® COHEN:

¥as, potentially aero consequences,
That’s right,

T. can’t say it is not zero,

I certainly would suggest when you read the literature and you
see what has happened to data, you would not want to come to that
conclusion,
QUESTION: Nell, if you don't know, you don’t know.
And then you —
MR, COHEN:

That’s right.

If you don't know, you uaa

your best available ©vi&sno©, and that’s what ths Congress had in
mind.

Of course, if you don't know and if you conclude, in

thase circumstances, that you are not going to regulate, then,
t

notwithstanding what the Fifth Circuit said as a disclaimers
that this is not a statute in which wa have to wait for a body
count; wa submit that ia exactly what has got to happen.
And the reason why it’s got to happen here is the end
product of what I was daveloping in my answer to Mr, Justice
Rehnquist:

the direct empirical evidence at 10 dees not

©Kiat and will not essisb for years to come.
QUESTION:

Wall, then this would be true of any

MR. COHENi

No, it would not.
Why not?
Because, as this record makes clear,

QUESTION; Because anything used to excess can be
harmful, including drinking water.
MR. COHEN:

I don’t mean to suggest that.

What I

thought I was responding to was your question as co whether or
not with respect to all toxic substances, is it impossible to
create a dose»response curve?

The answer to that is no, it is

not.
Indeed, Dr. Krabls of tha National Cancer Institute,
on the record in this case, bemoaned the fact that he tried,
he tried to come up with a dosa^rasponss curve for bensen©, and
he points

to the fact, as I did with respect to vinyl chloride.

And then ha resorted to tha language of the -«•

Rehnquist'e question.
QUESTION:

Oh, you forgot it.
Isn’t this a fairly common situation in

which medical research finds itself?
MR. COHEN;

Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I certainly

think under this statute it is conceivable that this will be
something that will happen at least on occasion, but, conversely,

41
«*» and I want to emphasis® this — the experience under several
of th© other very serious carcinogens that have bean regulated
to date by th© Secretary, thara were in fact adequate doseresponse curve® produced,,

That was true, for example, in vinyl

chloride, as I just mentioned; and that was true to a major
artent in th® so-called st®el Industry coke ovens* emission
standard, which is here in a companion case pending before the

When th© Secretary of Labor regulated amployee oxposur®

Regrettably, thrss years latar but well after

MR, COHEN:

Oh, I'm sorry,

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR, COHEN:

I wish I could say I remember it,

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, than, Mr, Justice

Rehnquist can try again,
QUESTION:

X don’t remember, either,

MR, COHEN:

I do know that I was trying to articulate

to you a legislative history of 6 {b} JS) on you,
understand that 6(b)(5)

J' want you to

just didn’t throw those words

"feasible" at us without a vary carefully conceived formulation.
Senator Javita, th® ranking minority member, introduced
an amendment to add after th© words "moat adequately" the-, words
"and feasibly".

And when he did so he mads it clear that ha

was concerned that th®r& might otherwis® ba interpretations that
ws have an absolute safety and health standard.
They then reported tha bill out and a mejor dabat®
7

took placa on the Senate Floor, and that debate fccuasd on th®
question of feasibility,

And Sanator Dominick, who was th®

loading spokesman for the minority aide of the aisle on this issue
'time and again was concerned that the words "most'» adequately

and

43

"feasibly” sure could literally be read to Man the most,
adequate way of doing if is shutting down the business,
shutting down industry and banning tho occupation» That was on
the one side»
He did not want perfection, he wanted possibilities,
QUESTION;

Of course at that time the bill read

"any impairment"
MR, COHEN;
QUESTION:

Excuse m® , sir?
ht that time the bill read "any impairment

of health" as opposed to material impairment,
MR, COHEN;

Yes, but I think we gave that argument

the shrift that it is entitled to. Those t*?ords, "Material"
QUESTION:

I agree, that argument doesn't answer

this case, but I think it may answer the concern in the
legislative history at the time,
MR, COHEN:

No, I think the "material impairment"

language wont directly to the physical condition of human
being3
QUESTION:
MR, COHEN:

Right,
and that language, although the legis»

lativa history is almost silent, is a marvelous little statement
by Senator Saxb© in his classic fashion saying, "Wall, with just
the word 1 impairsaant' , and we've got a provision which says even
if that individual was regularly exposed through© it his whole
working life, what if a bunch ©f mosquitoes keep coming back

44

©vary month and biting this fellow, are we going :o be in a
position that some bureaucrat is going to say 'that’s an
impairment within the meaning of Section 6(b) (5)*. "
I believe that the word ^material" was inserted,
although 1 don’t have any definitive citation for you, to
eliminate that kind of a possibilitya

Not, I want to emphasis®,

not because Congress wanted to inject a cost-beneiit analysis
concept» This

is a legislative history that there was not.one

single mention,, not on© reference., with all the discussion and
all the focus on what they meant by "technological feasibility"
or "feasibility”, never was there an allustion to the concept
of a cost-benefit analysis.
QUESTION: But in a critical point like this, where
we’re talking about the artant feasible, why should wa have to
look to vague legislative history that is subject to ambiguous
construction when Congress could have said aithar this or that
or the other?
MR. COHEN:

My only disagreement, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, would bo your description of this is vagus.

The

focus of the battle that Senator Dominiok generated was the
n©ad to eliminate impossibilities. And h® kept emphasising
repeatedly, "2 don’t want to. create a Utopia which is
impossible of achievement^ that won’t accomplish anything; 1
do want to accomplish tirhat can toe achieved through the state of
the art" at 480, 481 and 482 of the legislative history that was

45

th® focuso

And it was a very clear focus and it was the one

constraint, the on® constraint that the Congress was willing to
put on what otherwise, we believe, is a singular dedication and
devotion in that language of 6(b)(5) to the broadest possible
— the maximum possible employee protection»

issue.
But this case is far simpler, I believe, than my
opponents have made it appear»

Th© Fifth Circuit held that the

»« that OSHA must shoulder the affirmative burden of showing, by
substantial evidence, that its standard is reasonably necessary
and otherwise complies with the Act.
Here OSHA failed to show that the standard would do
any discernible good, and th© Court of Appeals reversed.
The decision and the result reached by the Fifth Circuit should
be affirmed.
Congress wanted OSHA to issue standards that are
reasonably nacessary to protect workers.

My opponent, Mr. Alsup,

has suggested that that provision is nothing more than a broad
enabling statute

broad enabling provision.

But, in fact,

there is in this vary statute enabling language in another
provision which says ~~ this is Section 8(g)(2) which says
that OSHA may issue such rules and regulations as ha may deem
necessary.
1 don't believe, when Congress has so clearly used

enabling type language, one can construe a reference, such as
in 3(8) as an enabling provision.

Quits the contrary. The

47

terra "reasonably necessary" ha® consistently and uniformly bean
construed by the Court, Plr3t Circuit, in tha Bean case and the
Fifth Circuit in the Aqua Slid© case, to be fully consistent
with what this Court held in th® Benaane case.
How, tha purpose that Congress wanted OSHA to follow,
namely, to aet reasonably necessary standards, is carried forward
in Section 6(b)(5),,

That provision intends for the Secretary

to set feasible standards which, the legislative history shows,
were to encompass reasonable and practical steps, to control
material health hazards»
Such standards ars also to b© based not on views
evidenced in arguments, and there is a great deal of legislative
history, or some legislative history about this? but instead on
substantial evidence.and th® best-avallabla evidence»
The Fifth Circuit -*• and in each of these instances,
the doterminations on these issues are required by the statute
to b© supported by substantial evidence®
The Fifth Circuit, in light of these provisions,
held essentially two things:

it hold that OSHA must show that

its standard will produce discernible benefits; and, secondly,
that there is soms reasonable relationship between the benefits
expected and the coat of the standard»
My opponente have both mentioned that there are, as
Mr. Alsup said,

thousands of carcinogens in the work placa,

1 believe he said, and Mr» Cohen notod th© Congress envisioned

48

every twenty seconds a new chemical going into the work place*
Now, it's our position that the statute expected
OSH& to be reasonable under the circumstancea, and that if the
overfall aims of the statute, which are to protect workers, are
going to be achieved, they c&n only ba achieved if there is a
judgment made that each individual standard is going to
f

accomplish some discernible good, and is going to benefit tha
worker, because obviously unless that sort of determination,
that fsort of reasonableness da termination is mads with every
standard in the first instance, what you’re going to find is,
ten years from now, industry will have spent fortunes to
control what could turn out to be ds minimis, or hazards which
really are not terribly significant*
QUESTION:

When you say "discernible" do you mean

quantifiable, measurable?
MR. WARREN:
question is:

Wall, let’s «- I think the key to that

what does best-available evidence mean?

But let’s first try to answer the question, were there
discernible benefits hers?
We’ve talked a lot back and forth about the question
of whether there is any evidence under a hundred parts per
million — and I say a hundred parte per million because there’s
really no evidence below a hundred parts per million

as Mr*

Justice Stevens noted, th® Fifth Circuit said there was no
empirical evidence below ton*

49

My opponents have brought tjp the Dow study»

I felt

that with thesis: reply brief we had seen the end of last-minute
ex post facto rationalizations of counsel, but we have yet a new
study brought on fcha seen©» And 1 just call your attention to
page IS of the Joint Appendis, which is EPA’s interpretation of
that study.

It says that the Ott study, that’s the Do*? study,

indicated no excess risk of leukemia with relatively well»documented exposures.
I cross-examined the witnesses for Dow in the
proceeding, and 1 will tall you that there is evidence that soma
of the exposures in that instance were up in several hundred
parts per million.

They varied all over fch® lot.

There were

different groups of workers exposed to different amounts.
I don’t bolieve I’ve really answered your question,
though, because, coming back to the question of discernible
benefits, we feel that here there are no demonstrated benefits
whatsoever.

There is no empirical evidence of any harm under

a hundred parts par million.
Now, the question
QUESTION:

Thera was an industry practice of reducing

it to 10 ppra, wasn’t thara?
MR. WARREN:

Wasn’t that haw it wont?

Well, it’s not an industry practice,

It’s a consensus standard; and the consensus standard has the
effect of law.

It is law.

It was adopted without rule-making

pursuant to Section 6(a) of the statute.

50

QUESTION:
MR. WARREN:
QUESTION:

The 10 ppm.
Yea. And it’s been in effect
You*re not in any way attacking that, are

you?
MR. WARREN:

No, we're not attacking that.

In fact, *>?s

think that standard is providing fully adequate protection to
the workers.
Coming to the question of whether those benefits ought
to be quantifiable or not, our position on that issue ia that
it's controlled by what the best-» avail able evidence is..
Now, in this instance, you'll recall that the
Environmental Protection Agency did quantify the benefit, was
able to make estimates of what the standard would accomplish.
The same was true of Dr. Wilson, EPA's own contractor in this
case, who testified that it could conduct a cost-effectiveness
type analysis which would encompass some sort of estimate of
this type.
The Fifth Circuit noted that in its decision and
was fully aware of the capability in this regard.
So I think in answer to your question, Mr. Chief
Justice, the best-available evidence language is controlling with
respect to the degree to which

quantification can occur? but

I think the evidence is overwhelming in this case that such
quantification can indeed be don®, because it was done by EPA'a
sister agency, the Environmental Protection Agency.

51
Now, the important thing, I think, her® is that if
yon carefully analyse what the Fifth Circuit said, it boils down
to really three things®

It says, first of all, that the agency

must carefully consider and address any evidence on benefits
submitted by the parties®
Secondly, it should attempt to estimate,

as wall as

possible, what the standard is intended to accomplish®
And third, it ought to explain and justify the standard
which it ultimately promulgates in terms of what it is expected
to accomplish®

What is this going to accomplish for the

worker?
Now, I submit that no on© can seriously contend that
that was dona in this eas®.

I don’t think any of those things

was done in this case®
It’s probably the best evidence, perhaps, that this
wasn’t done in this case is that the Secretary has felt called
upon to submit a vary lengthy addendum to ita reply brief,
which sets forth what I think it wishes it had said but didn’t
say about benefits in this case®
To me this tests the limits of what the ex post facto
rationalisation of counsel doctrine must mean® This takes it
awfully, awfully far®
Mow, Mr® Justice Relinquish eisked a question earlier
about how feasibility was determined in this casa.

I think

that bears a short discussion, because here’s what happened®

52

Th® Secretary saidj le have a health hazard here, and
the Secretary said to the contractor, not should we set a standard
at one or five or tan, and what1a feasible, or even one-half;
what he said is, We're talking about a on© part per million
standard, can you go out and show us that industry can com® up
with the hardware to accomplish this, and that it won’t drive
the industry out of business, or it won’t require the industry to
be shut down?
That's all that happened in this case»
consideration of alternativos»

There was no

Tho contractor was given no

discretion to look at any of the questions which \re • re talking
about here today»
21 is for that very reason, of course, that we
presented evidence and discussed this question at length in the
.*■

hearings» Tha kind of evidence we prasentsd «»- and I might add

£f
that the Council on Wag© and Frio© Stability was weighing in

1
?

there,

oh

exactly the same basis -■» was that this statuta is

sufficiently flexible to permit th® kinds of things that th®
Fifth Circuit said»

We're not talking about elaborate cost-

benefit analyses, what we're talking about is reasoned, rational
decision-making in a situation where Congress wanted ultimately
the most protection for workers to be accomplished» But that
can't bs accomplished by taking a tunnel vision approach as was
taken in this case to one hazard, and a hazard, indeed, where
the evidence

.strongly suggests we don’t have nearly as great a

53

problem as we've had with others, and will probably have with
others in the future»
QUESTION:

But a form of that protection could

certainly be accomplished by simply banning carcinogens»
MR» WARREN:

1

think that of course adequate protection

could bo accomplished by banning carcinogens, but the
problem
QUESTION:
MR» WARRENs
wouldn't

Everybody agrees that wouldn't be feasible»
Yess

that wouldn't be feasible, It

it just is an affront to common sense, and I

don't ~QUESTION:

Well, Congress, by putting in the

language "if feasible” apparently ruled out that»
MR, WARREN;

Congress definitely ruled that out»

I don't think that ~~
QUESTION: But, x*hafc did it put in its place?
MR» WARREN:
Now wa have to ask:

Wall, it puts the word "feasible" in»
what was "feasible" intended to accomplish?

Let me talk about the legislative history for

&

minute, because I think there are two key points on the legis™
latlve history which tell us that Congress wanted, that terra
"feasible" to mean reasonable and practical»

Things that are

really very consistent with Section 3(8), the "reasonably
necessary" language»
First, Senator Javifca was the author of the original

54

Administration bill on occupational health and safety»
submitted in 1963»

It was

That bill provided for standards to ba set

by an independent board and the standards would be set based
upon a report regarding the standard's feasibility, which the
statute says in so many ’words would include reasonableness,
practicality and technical feasibility»
How, Senator J&vifcs was the principal proponent of
the feasibility amendment»
Senate Committee»

He added it as an amendment in the

It is reasonable -- it is unreasonable in

fact to assume anything els® «**» that whan Senates: Javits put
that "feasibility" word in there, that is precisely what he
meant»

He did not mean this to maan some sort of arbitrary

business shutdown criterion»
QUESTION:
meant»

Wall, you say that's precisely what he

What is precisely what ha meant?
MR» WARREN:

Well, I think what ha meant was that the

standard ultimately ~~ it's the ultimate objective we're
talking about, the standard should bs reasonably necessary»
I think that's consistent with saying that it should be
-- protect the worker to the extent feasible»
Now, the ultimate objective is that the standard be
reasonable, the standard foe practical.
What the Fifth Circuit is doing is telling us how
that objective can ba achieved»

How that goal of reasonably

necessary standards, how that goal of reasonable and practical

55
standard can be achieved.
It's saying, first of all, that the agency must show
some discernible benefit? and, secondly, that there must b©
som® reasonable relationship between the costs and the benefits
And it’s giving us a means of doing that0
It seems to me that this whole approach is strongly
supported also by the evidentiary requirement, including the
substantial evidence test.

Congress put the substantial

evidence test in for a very clear and important purpose, 1
think. Congress was concerned that the Secretary of Labor
would issue arbitrary, unreasonable, unexplained, unsupportable
standards.
Soma of the original bills had the arbitrary and
capricious review standard in them.

That was felt by Members

in the House to be insufficient protection.

It was changed in

the Senate to provida additional protection through the
substantial svidance test.
1 don’t think there’s,any question that the —- the

feeling was that in return for letting the Secretary of Labor
establish the standards, that there needed to be guarantees
so that the Secretary of Labor,would not go overboard. That’s
what I believe the substantial evidence test was for in this
instance.
I make the.same point to the second and third
sentences of Section 8(b) (5), which, incidentally Mr. Alaup,

contrary to his opening brief, now appears to concede-’, apply
to both health and safety standards,

Those provisions were

put into the statute in response to the concern stated in the
House by the House minority members who had, I think, an
immense power in this legislative debate.
The House originally passed the Daniels bill. The
Daniels bill was thought by the minority members to be too
oriented towards the labor point of view.
passed through the House the

They ultimately

Staggers~Sikes substitute, which

was the new Administration bill.
In any event, the House minority members criticised the
Daniels bill as allowing standards to be set on the basis of
views and argument,

Xn the Senate that was remedied by

including the second and third sentences of Section 6(b)(5),
Those provisions require that standards ba based on
research demonstration and experiments.

It requires that in

addition to the health and safety protection, that the agency
consider the latest scientific data in the field and the
experience of other health and safety agencies.
We think the experience of other healfcl and safety
agencies is very significant in this ease, too.

We called,

throughout the proceedings, to the Secretary's attention the
fact that other agencies, and 2 include EPh as a prims example,
war© making the vary kind of estimates of bans fifes that we *r®
talking about in this caesa.

That was never addressed in their

57

decision,, That point is still, I think, unaddressed by the
agency»

Why EPA can engage in the kind of exercise that the

Fifth Circuit contemplated and this agency can*t is absolutely
beyond any understanding, as far as I can sea»
QUESTION;

Mr» Warren, can 1 ask you, if you believe

the Secretary's authority with respect to
about his duty but his authority

I'm not talking

with respect to standards

concerning toxic materials is any different from his authority
with respect to work practices, such as cleaning floors and
ths like?
MR. WARREN;

Well, 2 think there are differences which

reflect only one thing»
to both»

The reasonably necessary clause applies

The first sentence of section 6(b)(5) applies only

to toxic substances»

The second and third sentences of

section 6(b)(5) apply to both health and safety standards»
The third sentence of 6(b)(5) mentions feasibility, so that I
think safety standards comprehend feasibility»
But 1 do think there's a difference, and I think
that difference is why the debate arose and why there is a
separate provision, and that is, section 2(b)(6) recognises
that there are differences in toxic substances because there
are the problems that Mr. Cohan was referring to, the problems
of determination of causa and effect relationships and
determinations of latency period.
I don't think that Congress wanted any different, you

58

know, level of stringency of protection. But I do think that
Congress wanted the agency to recognize, and 1 chink the
language of the first sentence of Section 6(b)(5) does this,
however inartfully, that there were going to be somewhat
different problem© presented,,
QUESTION:

Well, the first Sentence imposes the duty

on him to take — put on the. toughest feasible standards9

But

wouldn’t he have the authority as opposed to the duty to take
the toughest feasible standard in anything he regulates?
Now, I’m asking you if his authority is any broader,
rather than -- I'm not asking ««
MR. WARREN:
same.

I think that the two are really the

If you ask me, at the level of stringency, 1 think they

come out the same, frankly.
QUESTION: So that he would have authority in a
different, as Justice Stewart suggested, cleaning floors or
something, if a certain cleaning practice wasn’t followed
there might be a risk of. people slipping and killing themselves»
He'd have authority to change that practice.
MR» WARREN:

And I think in coal mining, although it’s

not covered by the statute, is an example* too.

Thera are

going to be industries where it’s very dangerous to work in
those industries, if you’re working on tali buildings or
construction projects, obviously it* s a terribly, terribly
dangerous thing to do»

And X think the Secretary should be

59

equally concerned about those hazards®

I think Congress was

equally concerned about those hazards, really, because the
legislative history reveals & discussion of, 1 think it was,
14,000 deaths a year and some 600,000 injuries, And most of
those obviously are related to health and safety problems,
related to construction accidents end so forth and so on»
So 1 think that, in terms of the level of stringency,
we should be coming out about the, same place,
2 think it’s significant, though, ones again, to
point out that the Secretary’s opening brief seemed to pin almost
its entire case upon some distinction between toxic substances
and safety standards, and now I think they concede, if I
understand Mr. Alsup correctly, that safety standards are
covered by the second and third sentences of section 6(b)(5),
and it

oasis to me the reference to feasibility there must mean

that w@*re talking about roughly comparable levels of
stringency.
I don’t want to leave the substantial evidence test
/"

without a little more discussion, because I think that is so
critical to the ease,

we must remember wo don’t have any

evidence her® of actual problems below 100 parts per million.
Mow, it's important to recognise that industry in
this case has looked, and looked vary hard, to discover whether
there are any problems. There have bean numerous epidemiological
studies covering tens of thousands of workers.

To be sura, the

so
Secretary has faulted the methodology of some of those studies »
tout every epidemiological study has the same problems, including
the ones they are relying on.
The studies we are talking about have been relied on
by, for instans©, the National Academy of Sciences, who felt
that the Thorps study which was don® toy the petroleum industry
showed there just couldn't be any significant problem there,
regardless of any minor methodological defects,

you just couldn’t

have a big problem, there just isn’t a big problem that we're
talking about h& re„
QUESTION:

Is this much the same argument that was

made in the asbestos case?
HP.. WARREN:

No, Your Honor, this is a very different

case than the asbestos case.

The asbestos ease was a

challenge by ny friend, Mr. Cohen, here to the asbestos
standard, it uae not a challenge by employers•

Employers

didn't .participato except as amici in that ease at all.
They mad® no arguments, snoh as S*m making here today? nobody

There's no harm from bsnacne recorded

That’s true. And there’s been a

lot of effort to find harm.
What wa'ra talking about her® is a theoretical
construct, really; we’re talking about a substance where some
harm has been demonstrated at high levels and where we’re
theorising that there must be some harm at lower levels, and
frosa that theory, and nothing also, the Secretary is
constructing an argument, which is unsuppostad by anything,
that there are so-called depreciable benefits,

Thera certainly is a theoretical case.

There were witnesses who testified to that theoretical case

Mr. Warren, what troubles me about your

position, frankly, is what happens if you win and it go&s back
and they say, Well, we *ra going to acoapt -- I forget the name
of tho doctor’s finding? wo think that two deaths in six years

S7

ara predictable, and will occur»

And a half billion dollars

is worth saving those two lives.

Then what happens?

MR» WARREN:

Well, that’s an important question, I

think, which — the first point is that once the proceedings
begin to focus in on what I think is the real questions
What’s this going to accomplish for the worker?

I think wa'ra

going to find the diffarancaa between sides narrowing»

I

think we’re going to find people beginning to agree about
what’s useful protection and what’s less useful protection,
1 don’t think that if the hypothetical you poss ware
to occur that tho Secretary would issue this standard,
really don’t believe that,

I

I don't believe that, in light of

the other standards which have been issued, which 1 think can
easily be demonstrated and indeed hat'© bo©n demonstrated to
produce much more benefit than this, I just don’t believe this
would occur.
There may coma a time when the Secretary does some­
thing as flatly unreasonable,

X woul d say unreasonable is

bad, and X think in that event we can argue about it, but
we’ll be arguing about it at a time where the assumptionson
both sides are clearly stated, where the evidence supporting
the assumptions on both sides are eisarly stated.
Where wo really have substantial evidence which can
be reviewed on both sides of tho question. That's not what w@
have here.

So it seems to ms that’s a question that

63

theoretically arises, but 1 don't think it will happen in the
real world»

These questions are going to be resolved, rationally

and reasonably once people start looking at what really matters»
And. what really matters is protecting these workers that Mr,
Cohen and 1 both would like to proteat.

That's one of the reasons there’s so much history
underlying its us©,
But to make the tires,

skilled builders use semi™

automated techniques, where hand contact with these solvents
containing trace amounts of benaana simply cannot be avoided,
/

OSH& has never disputed that particular fact,
OSH&’a ban on skin contact, however, consequently,
would bring tire manufacturing to a standstill,
Mow, the Court of Appeals set aside the dermal
provisions, the prohibition on two fundamental scientific
grounds,

The Court ruled, first, that OSHA didn’t have any

factual basis for regulating skin contact at all, lot alone
for banning contact entirely.
The Court said, and I" quoto, "Th© record fails to

70

support the finding that bonsaae is absorbed through the skin.
If you got th® solvent with th© trace amount of benzene on
your akin, there is no evidence in th® record that the skin
actually would absorb the benzene, so that you would get the
benzene in your body.

The skin, from the evidence in th®

record, would fo® a barrier, and since your body wouldn't take
benzene in, you wouldn’t have th© type of exposure hazard that
you get with airborne concentrations„"
In short, the Fifth Circuit concluded just flatly
that regulation wouldn’t be necessary, let alone reasonably
necessary as section 3(8) of the statute requires.
Now, as a second separata and independent ground, the
Court concluded that OSHA had set the dermal contact prohibition
without gathering what it called "bo readily available” research
evidence on the basic skin absorption issue.
The Act expressly requiras, as haa been di®cussed,by
Messrs. Alsup ©nd Warren, in the second and

third sentences,

that OSHA havo research demonstrations and experiments and
the latest available scientific information in the field.
Her© OSHA issued th© skin contact prohibition based
on a so*"callad policy which was offered in lieu of scientific
evidence on absorption.
Because the Fifth Circuit ruled on fchesa two basic
grounds, it didn’t have to get into what it called th© feasibility
issu®.

We had briefed in th® Fifth Circuit the fact that in our

71

view the dermal contact prohibition was not feasible under the
terms of the Act, because the rubber companies didn’t make tires
under its terms.
They say the Court just didn't feel it had to get to
that issue, it expressly reserved it®
QUESTION: And you think that the two grounds on which
it relied, each one is independently insufficient, and that
there were alternative grounds?
MR. LETTOW:

Yes.

I think th© Fifth Circuit's

opinion, Mr® Justice Stewart, is clear on that particular point.
QUESTION: Well, I take it you would suggest then that
under the test that your friend on th® other side indicated
should be applied to whether any standard should have been
issued at all about skin contact, that those findings would
suggest that no standard should have been issued at all?
MR® LETTOW:

Well, yes, that’s correct, Mr. Justice

White, and certainly no prohibition, because that wasn’t
reasonably related to what the ©vidsne© showed.
So we have a caisa on the skin contact provision where
we're dealing at a different level of analysis than we are
with airborno®

Her®, with skin contact, w® aren't even sure

that there’s any real exposure.

QUESTION: Well, what if there had b?an a prohibition
against any employ©a boing permitted to keep his arm in a
bucket of benE©n© for mora than five minutes?

Now, would you

12

be here saying that there's just no evidence whatsoever that
that sort of exposure would hurt you?
MR. LETTOW:

Wall, Your Honor, there actually is not.

As a matter of fact, some Italians did tests like that and
didn't find that it hurt -*»
QUESTION:
MR. LETTOWs

So your answer -- is your answer yas?
It happens that I wouldn't be here today,

because the rubber companies wouldn't raise an issue like that»
But, as to whether or not they actually had evidence
like that, I would say, to be honest about it, no»

There’s

evidence -«*
QUESTION:

Unless you had a cut on yourself or

something?
MR. LETTOW:

Something like that, that's correct.

As a matter of fast, wa think the Fifth Circuit is
right, at least on the exposure element of what it decided,
based on the things that OSHA itself has said,

When it first

proposed to issue the permanent benzene standard, the agency
said in the preamble to its proposal:

Studies indicate benzene

is not readily absorbed through Intact skin.

That's a fairly

simple statement.
And then, similarly, whan it issued the final standard,
it put a set of medical surveillance guidelines in that standard
as an appendix, or with it as an appendix, to tell doctors and
other physicians about the standards? and it said that inhalation

73

was the primary rout© of exposure, and people should be
concerned. But it also said, in the aame breath, the extent
of absorption through the skin is unknown.
How do you gat a prohibition on skin contact from
something like that?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll resume there at one

o'clock, Mr. Lettow.
thereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at 1:00 p.ia. , th® same day.]

AFTERNOON SESSION
[ 3. t 0.1 p. ra»3
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr» Lattow, you may

resume»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES F„ LETTOW, ESQ»,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS — Resumed»
MR» LETTOW:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Regarding both the exposure and the research evidence
grounds that the Fifth Circuit had for its decision to set
aside the dermal contact prohibition, we have nothing further,
really, to add to the points that they put forward in response
to the action by OSHA, except for one thing»
In its reply brief in this Court, OSHA makes
reference to a 1976 publication by the American Conference of
Governmental Industrial Hygienists»

That’s the group that set

up th® consensus standard that provides the 10 parts per million
level that’s now in effecto

And it says, in 1976, that

ACGIH put forward a skin notation for bensene.

I just want to

call the Court’s attention to th© fact that -- and only because
it’s in the government’s reply brief «« that for two years now,
*78 and ’79, the ACGIH has no skin nctation for benzene»

It’s

absent» They juat focus on the airborne hasard»
The one other issue of statutory construction that
arises with respect t© the research evidence ground is that

75

what is best available evidence?

The Court can find a

definition for best available evidence fairly easily by just
going to Webster’s Third How International Dictionary, and
that s&ys:

wavailable" means that which is accessible or may

bs obtained»

And indeed one of the examples that the

dictionary uses for that type of usage is “the latest readily
available information”»
How, "readily available" is actually what the Court
of Appeals used as it was defining that terra»

And that is

fairly easily explained also by what Congress did, because the
second and third sentences of 6(b)(5), section 6(b)(5), were
actually taken from -«* or the terras of them, the words were
taken 'from the research provisions of the bill that was enacted»
The research provision® were there first»
And the research provisions in section 20(a),
especially 20(a)(3), make a roforanaa to rasearch,demonstrations,
and experiments.

That’s where that language comes fro®.

So they knew what they were talking about.

They knew that

OSHA had to do some research in order to bs able to come up
with standards under some instances.
QUESTION:

Earlier in your argument, Mr. Lefctow,

you suggested 'chafe if this standard prevails, that the tir©
industry just won’t make the grade, that it will shut down»
Did I understand you right or not?
MR. LETTOW:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, *■**»
You made some remark

76

MR* LETTOW:
QUESTION:

Yes, t did.
-- a pretty strong remark, and your

colleague on the other side indicatas that it must be feasible
and that the Secretary should not just close down an industry*
MR. LETTOW:

The issue of feasibility is one that w®

have argued strongly in the Court of Appeals*

But because they

didn't decide it, they said that was the issue that was most
affected by the amendment to thes standard that came at the eve'
of oral argument, literally on th® eve, the afternoon before*
We argued that issue in supplemental brief to the
Court of Appeals* But because it didn't dacide it, it hasn’t
fcasn briefed here*
QUESTION: Well, it’s open then?
MR* LETTOW:
QUESTION;

It is open and
And if you're right, you'll win*

If ycu’re right, you'll win*
MR. LETTOWs

Yaa} sir, that’s right.

But you can

understand why we didn't brief it here, because the Court of
Appeals didn’t decide it*
QUESTION;

I understand, but -» the Court of Appeals

didn’t decide it, so that issue is still open.
MR. LETTOW:

Yes, sir, it ia still open* And it is

referred to in the OSHA reply brief, and of course we disagree
with them, and if you’re interested in that subject we would
suggest going back to the briefs on the merits in the Fifth

7?

Circuit.»
QUESTION:

Well, X take it the Secretary must believe

that tha standard is feasible,,
Or do you think the Secretary doesn’t support the
view of your colleague that h@ should not close down an industry?
MR» LETTOW:

Well, Mr» Justice White, the Secretary,

that is OSHA, doss raaka a reference to fch© fact that in the tire
industry you need akin contact, you need dermal contact with
solvents»

They have put forward, and the basis for the

feasibility claim is now based on the percentage exclusion to
the standard, whether or not that’s sufficient in terras of these
solvents»

That is what is actually briefed»
QUESTION:

Well, if the feasibility issue would have

to be remanded, would it be remanded to the Court of Appeals
or to OSHA?
MR» LETTOW:

Your Honor, I honestly don't think that

it ever left the Fifth Circuit»

When you granted certiorari

you didn’t get to that Issue, and 1 guess the question you
would have in your action in this Court ia whether or not you
would agree with the Fifth Circuit on tha two grounds they
adopted, if you did or did not it would go back to the Fifth
Circuit»

If the Fifth Circuit had *»» wall, the Fifth Circuit

would decide th® feasibility question and than it would or
would not go back to QSHA»
QUESTION:

Wall,if you war® right and it was not

73

feasible, and that meant the standard was not valid, it would
certainly save us an awful lot of work.
K3. LETTOW:

Yes, Your Honor, it would.

Thank you.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
