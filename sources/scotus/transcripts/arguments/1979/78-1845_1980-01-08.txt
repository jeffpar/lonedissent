MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next In 78-1845, Illinois v. Vitale.
Mr. Veldman, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. VELDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. VELDMAN:
Good morning..

Thank you very much, Your Honors.

My name is James S. Veldman, and I repre­

sent the people of the State of Illinois.

We are your

petitioner here.
We are concerned in this case with the applic­
ability or I might say our position being the complete
lack of applicability to the facts in this case of the
double jeopardy provisions of the Fifth Amendment to the
United. States Constitution.
On November 20, 1974, John Vitale struck with
his automobile and killed two young children.

On

December 23, 1974, he was found guilty on a traffic
ticket which was issued at the scene of the collision,
charging him with failure to reduce speed to avoid an
accident.

On the following day, December 24, 1974,

Vitale was charged with two counts of involuntary man­
slaughter and because he was a minor at the time those
charges took the form of a petition for adjudication

of wardship.
The judge in the juvenile court branch of the
Unified Circuit Court of Cook County finally dismissed
the involuntary manslaughter charges out among other
basis, on the basis of double jeopardy and the people
have appealed up through the state court system and now
come before Your Honors.
As Your Honors undoubtedly know, the Supreme
Court of Illinois has certified that its decision was
based squarely upon its interpretation of the Fifth
Amendment double jeopardy clause.
As you also know, I am sure, there was a very
strong dissent in this case and I rely on a great deal
of the logic and thinking of that dissent in my argument
here,
It is our position that these offenses are not
the same offenses for double jeopardy purposes in that,
one, they are not the same offense as defined under
double jeopardy purposes and, secondly, that the traffic
offense is not a lesser included offense of the offense
of involuntary manslaughter.
It is absolutely clear, Your Honors, that a
person may not be twice placed in jeopardy for the same
office.

What the clause protects is it prevents multiple

prosecutions and/or punishments for the same offense.

5
And those are the critical words, as this Court well knows,
the same offense.
The identity of the offense and not the act or
series of acts involved is the crucial question presented
in a double jeopardy case.

Blockburger v. United States,

Ciucci v. Illinois.
Where one act or a series of acts is a violation
of more than one statutory provision and where those
violations are not the same offense as defined under
Blockburger, that there is no prohibition about twice
trying, convicting or punishing the defendant upon those
charges, Blockburger as I have indicated, and Gavieres
v. United States.
QUESTION:

My problem, Mr. Veldman, in this

case is. as you might have anticipated would be the
problem of one or more members of the Court, is that
whatever we might independently think about it, the
Supreme Court of Illinois through the opinion of the
late Mr. Justice Dooley has told us that in Illinois
this is a lesser included offense.

And to be sure,

there was a very vigorous dissenting opinion, but that
is the construction of the law of Illinois by the
Illinois Supreme Court and we have no choice but what
to accept it, don't we?
MR. VELDMAN:

Might I suggest to Your Honors

6
that you do have a choice, and I suggest to you this:

In

Brown v. Ohio, as I attempted to note in my secont point
in my

reply brief, in Brown v. Ohio the question of

whether the offense was a lesser included offense came
before this Court more or less as a fait accompli.
QUESTION:

The Supreme Court of Ohio or the

Court of Appeals of Ohio held that it was a lesser in­
cluded offense.
MR. VELDMAN:
QUESTION:

Precisely.

And here the Supreme Court of

Illinois has held that it was a lesser included offense.
MR. VELDMAN:

But I believe that the difference

here is that it was not contested.
QUESTION:

There is a dissenting opinion that

I used to have a law teacher who told the whole class
chat dissenting opinions were subversive literature.
(Laughter)
MR. VELDMAN:
QUESTION:

If that were —

In any event, the court has spoken

through tie late Mr. Justice Dooley, that is your court,
the highest court of your state, and it has told us that
in Illinois this failing to stop or rather driving at
excessive speed is a lesser included offense of manslaughter.
And we can’t independently reexamine that holding, can we?
MR. VELDMAN:

I believe that you can, Your Honor,

because I believe that this Court must look at Mr. Justice
Dooley’s holding and I believe that you must consider it
in light of3 number ones the dissent, which I don’t think
of as subversive in this particular case at any rate, and
also in light of the very clear definition of what is a.
lesser included offense.
1 don’t think this Court must find itself bound
by a holding of a state court which would, of course, in
»

effect

if Your Honors feel bound by Mr. Justice Dooley’

determination, then you must apply Brown v. Ohio, and for
this Court to be put in that position where it has no
choice but to follow Mr, Justice Dooley I submit is cut­
ting unnecessarily down on what are obviously the powers
of this Court,
QUESTION:

Well, you would concede, would you —

you would ag;ree, I suppose, Mr. Veldman, wouldn't you,
that if a state legislature passes a law saying that some­
thing is black and the supreme court of that state says
what this really means is that something is white,
have absolutely no power whatsoever to disagree Tvith the
construction put upon that law by the highest court of
its state, do we?
MR. VELDMAN:
QUESTION:

Unless —

Do we or not?

MR. VELDMAN:

I would say —

8
QUESTION:

And why is this different?

That is

the —MR. VELDMAN:

I would say in the ordinary case,

no, unless the construction put upon the -— of whether it
is black or white so encroaches upon that constitutional
question that it deprives this Court of the right to de­
cide the constitutional question, and that is what I am
saying, that -—
QUESTION:

Well, what authority do you have for

that exceptional submission?
MR. VELDMAN:
QUESTION:

I -— I beg your pardon.

I mean, in other words if the statute

as passed saying there shall be no hearing in this kind
of a situation before somebody is fired and the supreme
court of that state says, well, what it really means is
that there shall be a hearing, then can we entertain a
due process attack upon that statute upon the ground that
it purports to provide for no hearing?
MR. VELDMAN:

If the supreme court of the state

had said that -~
QUESTION:

Construed the statute to say what it

really means is that there will be a hearing in accord
with due process of law.
MR. VELDMAN:

No, but do you not feel, Your

Honor, that if the supreme court of the state were to

9
hold that a statute which said there shall be a hearing
and the supreme court were to say that statute means there
is to be no hearing* do you not feel that this Court would
be empowered to overturn that undue process grounds, not­
withstanding the state court decision?
QUESTION:

Are you trying to suggest to us that

when a state court is construing the federal Constitution
that presents a different situation?
MR. VELDMAN:

I am.

I am in a very true sense

because I feel that, as I have attempted to do under the
second point of the people's principal brief here, there
is a very definite and standard definition of vr'nat is a
lesser included offense and this offense simply does not
fit into that definition.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Veldman, didn't Mr.

Justice Dooley recognize that in page

A? and page AS of

the petition for a writ of certiorari, at the bottom of
the page, where he says,

’As is usually the situation be­

tween greater and lesser included offenses, the lesser
offense, failing to reduce speed, requires no proof
beyond that which is necessary for conviction of the
greater, involuntary manslaughter.

Accordingly, for

purposes of the double jeopardy clause, the greater
offense is by definition the ’same’ as the lesser offense
included within it,"

10

CouldnTt you read that as itself being constrain­
ed by his view of the double jeopardy clause?
MR. VELDMAN:

Well, I think that is his view of

the double jeopardy clause.

I think that the problem that

I see in that is, number one, that you will notice. Your
Honor, that the case lav? which I cited to this Court is
very clear, that — I am not attempting to depart from
your question but perhaps approaching it a little ~~
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there

at 1:00 o’clock, counsel.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the court was in
recess, to reconvene at 1:00 o’clock, p.m., the same
day.)

11
AFTERNOON SESSION — 1:00 O’CLOCK, P.M.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Veldman, you may

resume whenever you are ready.
MR. VELDMAN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Afc the time of the luncheon recess, I was at­
tempting to answer a question by one of the Members of the
Court,
Mrc Justice Dooley, at page A7 of his opinion
as it appears In the petition for certiorari seems to be
defining lesser included offense under the concept of
double jeopardy, and I submit to you that one of his
errors is that he misdefines it.

He speaks in terms of

what the fact of the lesser offense must usually contain
and no element not found In the greater*,

And I would

submit to this Honorable Court that it is abundantly clear
from the cases such as Brown v. Ohio, such as, for example
Virgin Islands v. Aequino in the intermediate appellate
court, that for double jeopardy purposes the lesser in* !

eluded offense situation is thusly defined:

The greater

offense will always and of necessity include all of the
elements of the lesser.
QUESTION:

Could you cite where on page A7 he

says that it is usually included?
MR. VELDMAN:

He says — if Your Honor will bear

with me for just a moment.

On page A7, three lines from

12
the bottom., a new paragraph begins.
QUESTION:

Well, it says, "As is usually the

situation between greater and lesser included offenses
MR. VELDMAN:

the lesser offense, failing

to reduce..— but, you se©3 he says, Your Honor,
it is usually the situation, and I think, unless I misin­
terpret his language, I believe that that indicates that
he has misapprehended the rule, the rule of the definition
there,
QUESTION:

Well, he says, in any event, in this

case the lesser offense requires no proof beyond that which
is necessary for a. conviction of the greater.
MR. VELDMAN:

Which, of course, I submit to

this Court is totally not true.
QUESTION:

Certainly the corollary is not true,

that the manslaughter charge requires proof of the
homicide, whereas the lesser included offense doesn't
involve a homicide or even an accident.
MR, VELDMAN:

Yes, the so-called lesser in­

cluded offense involves no element of death, it doesn't
even necessarily involve an element of collision with
any person.

The so-called greater offense, on the other

hand, can be easily proven in a number of instances with­
out proving the lesser, since voluntary manslaughter, as
Your Honors can see defined statutorily, and I have set

13
it out at page 16 of our principal brief, clearly you
can commit involuntary manslaughter in Illinois easily
without the use of an automobile and therefore under no
stretch of the imagination.
QUESTION:

I have two problems with your argu­

ment and I would like you to perhaps comment on it.
First of all, in the statute which is set out at page AS
in the petition, there is an w(a)” on the manslaughter
and there is a ”(b)" that says, "If the acts which cause
the ddafch consist of the driving of a motor vehicle
and then it goes on, which is I take it a sub-category
of the voluntary manslaughter.
MR. VELDMAN:
QUESTION:

It is ~

Which is, of course, the sub-category

we have here.
MR. VELDMAN:

It is the offense which is known

in Illinois as reckless homicide.
QUESTION:

Right.

Which is, I gather, a lesser

included offense within -MR. VELDMAN:

It is characterized in the statute,

if you will notice, as an included offense.
QUESTION:

Now, would you say that the reckless

driving of a vehicle is a lesser included offense within
the offense of reckless homicide?
MR. VELDMAN:

Would I say that -

in
QUESTION:

In other words, what I am suggesting

is a sort of a pyramid, the broadest category is the in­
voluntary manslaughter, included within that category is
the species reckless homicide and an even lesser within
that category is the reckless driving of the vehicle.
Each is lesser of the next step up.
MR. VELDMAN:

Well, perhaps if we had the reck­

less driving of the vehicle, you might have an instance
where it might be an included offense, but what I think
you cannot -- even in Your Honor's pyramid of setting up
sub-categories, you cannot make failing to reduce speed
a lesser included offense even a reckless homicide be­
cause all that you are talking about in failure to reduce
speed is a simple violation of due care by not reducing
speed even to avoid, say, an empty wagon which on the
highway.
QUESTION:

But the statutory definition of

failure to reduce speed is not limited to eases of failure
to reduce speed but also include driving at a speed that
is greater than reasonable and proper and so forth.
There are a lot of —
MR. VELDMAN:

Well, I think a great many things,

as Your Honor can see at page 17 in the people's principal
brief, there are a great many things which are included
within this particular section of the Illinois Vehicle Code.

15
And I think there are a number of separate and distinct
offenses which might be committed under this section.
QUESTION:

Right.

The question is, I suppose ~

let me put it a little differently — the indictment for
manslaughter that is quoted on page ^ of the appendix
alleges that John M. Vitale has on or about so-and-so
committed the offense cf involuntary manslaughter.

In

that, he without lawful justification, while recklessly
driving a motor vehicle, caused the death of George Keeh.
COuld they prove that charge without also proving a
violation of failing tc reduce speed?
MR. VELDMAN:

I don’t think that is clear as

the case In the posture in which this case comes before
this Court.

There was a police report which indicated

that Vitale had violate a number of Illinois traffic
lawso

We don’t —~ I don’t think that at this juncture,

as the case presently comes before the Court, that we can
say •— and I certainly personally cannot say — whether
the proof of the involuntary manslaughter would have in­
volved the failure to reduce speed necessarily or not.
I think that had the case not been —
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t It necessarily have proved

that he was driving recklessly and without proper regard
to traffic conditions and the use of the highway in a way
that endangered the safety of any person or property?

16
Wouldn't it necessarily prove that he endangered the
safety of the person he killed?
MR. VELDMAN:
QUESTION:

Ch, it would —

That is what the statute calls —

that is the statutory definition of -MR. VELDMAN:

But do you notice, Your Honor,

that the statute — the statute begins — we are talking
about traffic statute
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. VELDMAN:

The statute begins, "No vehicle

may be driven upon a highway of this 3tate at a speed
which is greater than reasonable," efc cetera, and it
goes on and it makes a number of what I would consider to
be possibly separate and distinct traffic offenses, one
of which is failure to reduce speed.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. VELDMAN:

And I think Mr. Justice Underwood

commented in his dissenting opinion on this very subject,
that it was impossible to know which of the number of
possible violations committed under this or other sections
might have been the basic proof in the involuntary man­
slaughter.
QUESTION:

Was all of this argued before the

lower court, the fact that this was not double jeopardy
and the fact that under Illinois law this was not — was

all of this argued?
MR. VELDMAN:
wasn' t.

No, actually. Your Honor, it

The ~~
QUESTION:

Well, you had an opportunity to argue

It, didn’t you?
MR. VELDMAN:

The way the case came, if Your

Honor will note appendix B of the petition for certiorari,
the way that the cause came to the Supreme Court of
Illinois, the Appellate Court of Illinois for the First
District had decided that they had not said much or any­
thing about the double jeopardy question involved in the
ease,

They had simply based It on an Illinois statute»
Mr. Justice Dooley and the majority of the

Illinois Supreme Court in their opinion said we find an
even more compelling rationale in the Fifth Amendment of
the United. States Constitution.

This forum, the forum

before this Honorable Court is really the first time in
which a full-fleged argument on the double jeopardy
aspects of this case has been made, as I see it,
QUESTION: , Is this the first time there was an
opportunity to argue it?
MR. VELDMAN:
QUESTION:

No, and I believe the

You are not saying that you didn’t

have an opportunity, are you?
MR. VELDMAN:

Well, I don't think that — I'm

18
sorry, I don’t think I follow Your Honor’s question*

I

beg your pardon*
QUESTION:

All you are entitled to is an oppor­

tunity to present your argument, that is all you have

a

right to?
HR. VELDMAN:

Yes*
*

QUESTION:

You don’t have a right to ask some­

body else to do your arguing for you?
MR. VELDMAN:

No, you do not, Your Honor, but

the point is I think that —
QUESTION:

I shouldn’t think the State of

Illinois would need any help.
QUESTION:

Did you make all these arguments to

the Illinois Supreme Court?
MR. VELDMAN;
QUESTION:

No, we did not because —

Were you arguing just the state law

question?
MR. VELDMAN:

Basically the people’s brief

which is in the Supreme Court of Illinois, which I might
point I did not either write or argue —- dealt basically
with the state law question which came up from the
Appellate Court.

We have the procedure in Illinois of

leave to appeal, and one’s petition for leave to appeal
Is normally limited to those questions in the Appellate
Court which are considered error by the petitioner.

So

19
we were somewhat limited in what we could argue before the
Supreme Court of Illinois.

And the briefs for respondent

in the Supreme Court of Illinois really did not bring out
the double jeopardy question which under Illinois court
procedure, again., limited the people in that we were
compelled basically to keep our answer within the bounds
raised by the party appellee there.
QUESTION:

You say that the Illinois Appellate

Court relied on the Illinois statute barring prosecutions
analogous to double jeopardy?
MR. VELDMAN:
statute in Illinois.

The so-called compulsory joinder
The Appellate Court opinion I think

can be pretty much condensed down to the fact that this
prosecution violated sections 3-3 and 3-^ of chapter 38
of the Illinois Revised Statutes in that all of these
offenses could have and should have been joined before a
single court for trial.
The Supreme Court of Illinois,

totally departed

from that rationale.
QUESTION:

Has there ever been an adjudication

on the merits of either of these two charges?
MR. VELDMAN:

Of these two charges, an adjudica­

tion on the merits?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. VELDMAN:

Yes.

There has been an

20
adjudication of the merits9 although we don't have s. tran­
script so we don't know xfhat took place.

But Mr. Vitale

has been found guilty and he did not plead guilty.

He was

found guilty in the traffic proceeding and was fined in
the sum of $15.

And I can only assume that there was

there some sort of trial and adjudications although we do
not have a transcript before us,
QUESTION:

Mr. Veldman, it occurs to me that as

a matter of Illinois law, we do have an opinion of the
intermediate, the Appellate Court to the effect that these
two offenses are the same offense within the meaning of the
Illinois Criminal Code.

That holding was not reviewed by

the Illinois Supreme Court which apparently went on
federal grounds.

But the highest court of the state

which has spoken to the issue has told us that as a matter
of Illinois law we have the same offense, isn’t that true?
MR. VELDMAN:

The highest court that has spoken

on the issue, yes.
QUESTION:

And aren’t we bound by the teaching

of the highest court of Illinois that tells us anything
about a state law issue?
MR. VELDMAN:

You do not have a final determin­

ation of that issue by the highestreviewing court.
QUESTION:

But it is unreversed at least,

MR. VELDMAN:

Yes, it is unreversed in the sense

21
that it is untouched.
QUESTION:

In other words, the Illinois Supreme

Court may have merely said yes and, oh, by the way, it
also violates the federal Constitution,,
MR. VELDMAN:
Your Honor.

No, but they did not say that,

They specifically, in answer to our petition

for certiorari 78-2, when this Honorable Court sent the
ease back, the Supreme Court of Illinois specified that
its opinion was based on the Firth Amendment, so they
declined to decide the issue, and I can understand that
because the committee comments appended to section 3-3
ancl 3-4 — and those committee comments in Illinois are
proper source of legislative intent — indicate that
what those sections were basically meant to cover was an
instance involving multiple prosecutions under a single
act or a series of acts which were not covered or barred
by the concept of double jeopardy in the Fifth Amendment,
and it may have very well been that finding, as they did,
that the Fifth Amendment barred the prosecution, that
the Supreme Court of Illinois thought it superfluous to
discuss the Illinois statute under those conditions.
QUESTION:

Suppose, Mr. Veldman, hypothetically

— this is a further hypothetical «— you could persuade us
that there was some basis for reversing the Supreme Court
of Illinois on their federal holding, would there be

22

anything to prevent that court when the case x?as remanded
from in effect adopting the Court of Appeals opinion and
putting it on state grounds and therefore impervious to
any challenge?
MR. VELDMAN:

I think that having determined

that in the basis of its opinion was purely federal con­
stitutional grounds, that the Supreme Court of Illinois
would be precluded from so doing.
QUESTION:

I should think that —

How could anyone preclude them from

saying, as Mr. Justice Stevens just suggested, the inverse
of what you suggested, as a matter of fact, that if the
is the attitude of the Supreme Court of the United States,
all right, we will decide it on state grounds and then
decide it just ehw ay the Court of Appeals did.
MR. VELDMAN:

Well, I suppose that in theory

there is nothing to prevent them from doing it, but I
think that in actuality the proper remedy — and"I think
that if I were before the Supreme Court of Illinois, I
would argue that the proper remedy, having decided it on
federal constitutional grounds and been then reversed,
would be to return the case to the Unified Circuit Court
of Cook County for further proceedings under this indict­
ment, and the question there, I think we would then have
perhaps the question of the applicability of the statute
but I think it would be raised properly in the trial court.

I think it would ill-behoove the Supreme Court of Illinois
to say, well, we decided our opinion was on one rationale
but since they won't buy that we will just go l80 degrees
the other way, and I cannot conceive,

being somewhat

familiar with the Justices on the Supreme Court of Illinois
that they would do that.
QUESTION: They wouldn't be going the other way,
they would just be reaching the same result.
MR. VELDMAN:

Well, they would be reaching the

same result but they would be reaching the same result on
a completely different rationale.
QUESTION:

That is all right but they would be

going on state grounds whereas now they have decided it
on federal.
MR. VELDMAN:

But they have said. Your Honor,

in answer —
QUESTION:

At least if we disagreed with them,

we would have told them that they were wrong on the federal
ground and leave It to them to decide it on state grounds.
MR, VELDMAN:

Yes, if nothing else.

And as I

have said, their specific answer to the inquiry of this
Court under the petition for certiorari, the original
petition for certiorari in this case was, the question
presented to the Supreme Court of Illinois was have you
decided this case on state grounds, federal grounds or

both, and the answer was federal grounds alone.
QUESTION:

But that doesn’t prevent them, if we

tell them they were wrong on federal grounds, when it
goes back to them, saying, all right, we were wrong on
the federal grounds, we will now address the state grounds.
MR. VELDMAN:

Yes, I suppose they could do that»

They could •—
QUESTION:

You certainly took the state grounds

to them, didn't you?

You must have.

MR. VELDMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, we did.

That is about the only ground you

took to them.
MR. VELDMAN:

And they ignored it.

They in

fact ignored it.
QUESTION:
correct?

Mr. Veldman, is that really quite

At page A3 of the petition, after reviewing

the proceeding in the Appellate Court, they conclude
that that court had concluded that the Appellate Court
concluded that the acts in both the offense of failure
to reduce speed
and the offense of involuntary mant
slaughter were identical with the exception in the man­
slaughter offense a death was involved.

Then they said,

it follows from that that under the Illinois statute 3(b),
since the prosecutor knew about both at the same time, as
a matter of state law dismissal was required.

Then they

25
said after that there is an even more compelling reason
for dismissal giving this hypothesis,, that is that the
double jeopardy clause of the Federal Constitution also
requires dismissal.
Now, what is the federal error in that analysis?
MR. VELDMAN:

The federal error in the analysis

of the state statute?
QUESTION':

What federal error did the Illinois

Supreme Court commit, given the identity of the offenses
which the Appellate Court had found and which the Supreme
Court of Illinois did not disagree with but merely said
we need not rely on the state statute that requires dis­
missal when identical offenses are involved, we can rely
on the federal Constitution that requires dismissal when
identical offenses are involved.

What is the federal-

error that that court committed?

MR. VELDMAN:

I think the error which was com­

mitted by that court was first in its interpretation of
\

the double jeopardy clause, and secondly in finding that
under Illinois law those offenses are the same offense.
QUESTION:
law question.

Well, the latter theory is a state

What was its erroneous interpretation of

the double jeopardy clause?
N

MR. VELDMAN:
it this way:

But I don’t think — let me put

I don’t think — I see my time is expired,

26
but I would like to answer Your Honor’s question if I may.
I don’t think that you can quite divorce the two things
in the way that Mr. Justice Dooley wrote his opinion.

He

seems to interpret the Illinois statutes but on federal
constitutional grounds, and I think that one cannot
divorce the two things.
QUESTION:

And I think the federal —

What do you mean by that?

How can

you —
MR. VELDMAN:
QUESTION:

For example, he defines —

— err on state statutory laxf on

federal constitutional grounds?
MR. VELDMAN:
QUESTION:

He says —

If as a matter of state law first

degree murder includes manslaughter, say, how is that
affected one way or the other by the federal Constitution?
MR. VELDMAN:

Because unless I misread the po­

sition taken by Mr. Justice Dooley and the majority of

the offenses were the same offense for double jeopardy
purposes but then the statute barred them.

Yes.

Therefore under BroWn v. Ohio we

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. DIRKSEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DIRKSEN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

My name is Lawrence Dirksen, and I represent

the respondent, John Vitale.
Your Honors, I believe, to clarify seme of the
questions that first came out, I can probably fill the
Court in a little bit on the history of this case because
this is the first time that double jeopardy really has
ever become an issue.

This case has been all over and

every conceivable argument that could have been made
against John Vitale by th= State of'Illinois has been made.
Originally, they challenged us on jurisdiction.
Just to take a step backwards, John Vitale was tried on
the minor traffic violation.

His uncle represented him

31
on that matter.

He was tried in the suburban court not

too far outside of Chicago.

Prom the conversation I had

with his uncle, there was a full trial.

Not only did the

witnesses testify against John Vitale, John Vitale testi­
fied himself, which is neither here nor there.

But if I

had been representing him, I certainly would not have
allowed him to take the stand, but he did testify, so it
was a full trial.
As I see this case, I have absolutely no argu­
ment — in fact, I entirely agree with Judge Dooley's
opinion.

But really what we would be talking about here

would be multiple trials if the state would prevail on
this final argument because as I say, they had gone from
jurisdiction originally.

That didn’t work.

They said

v/e can do one thing in the traffic court and we can do
something else in the juvenile.

Well, John Vitale is no

longer a juvenile, but in those days they thought that
they could prosecute him on traffic here and perhaps on
the manslaughter over in the juvenile court.
The fact of the matter is that they couldn’t do
it as an adult.

I raised that question in the Circuit

Court, I raised it

in the Appellate Court, and I asked

the state in front of the Illinois Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

You raised that on state grounds?

MR. DIRKSEN:

Your Honor, my original motion

32
was to dismiss the petition for adjudication of delinquency
and it was based on statutory and/or constitutional grounds
of double jeopardy which had compulsory joinder statutes -~
QUESTION:

Federal double jeopardy?

MR. DIRKSEN:
QUESTION:

Federal or state?

MRo DIRKSEN:
won both ways.

Pardon?

It was a joint motion, yes.

I

The Circuit Court ruled on the compulsory

joinder statutes that the matter should have been joined
in one trial, one proceeding.

The Appellate Court said

the same thing and they further reiterated that —
QUESTION:

Could I ask you a question about the

argument in the Illinois Appellate Court.

I gather you

did represent —
MR. DIRKSEN:

Yes, Your Honor, I represented

him since the juvenile court.
QUESTION:

Did the state argue that even on

the assumption that the offenses are identical, one
being included within the other, nevertheless the Illinois
state compulsory joinder statute is not applicable because
it doesn't apply to juvenile proceedings or doesn't apply
to traffic offenses or something of that character?
MR. DIRKSEN:

No, 1 think it was very clear,

there was never a question that it did not apply to
juveniles.

The state argued that but the court

33
QUESTION:

The state argued that it did not apply

then?
MR. DIRKSEN:
QUESTION:

Right.

And so is it possible that what the

Supreme Court of Illinois was saying Is, well, we have
identical offenses here, we don't have to decide whether
the state compulsory joinder statute applies because in
any event when you’ve got the same offenses you’ve got
the protection under the federal Constitution.
MR. DIRKSEN:
Honor.

I believe that is correct. Your

A juvnile issue was entirely dismissed because I

think we all recognize, and. everybody did In the courts,
the nine judges from the State of Illinois thus far,
that juveniles have all the same rights as adults and
that is what I was saying when I back-tracked, the state
abandoned that argument.

*

They said, okay, forget about

the juvenile question.
QUESTION:

How are we to understand the remand

and the answer that the court gave?

Did they say they

decided the case solely on double jeopardy grounds?
MR. DIRKSEN:
Honor.

I didn’t read it that way, Your

I read it the way Mr. Justice Stevens said.
QUESTION:

Well, what did they say?

MR. DIRKSEN:

They said that Appellate Court

held under the compulsory joinder statute that the state —

3*5
QUESTION:

I know, but what did the state say in

answer to oux° remand?
MR. DIRKSEN:

Oh, they sent us back to you and

said solely on federal constitutional grounds.
QUESTION:
that or not?

Well, are we supposed to go behind

The said solely on —

MR. DIRKSEN:

Well, Mr0 Justice Dooley who wrote

the opinion died.
QUESTION:

Well, they are clearly given, given

.identity of offenses which they found, then as a matter
of federal constitutional law there is double Jeopardy.
That is solely constitutional grounds.
MR. DIRKSEN:

Your Honor, there is no question

they are right.
QUESTION:

Of course, you agree that we can’t

examine the basis of the state holding.

MR. DIRKSEN:
QUESTION:

I absolutely do, Your Honor.

Is Mr. Justice Dooley, now deceased,

the former Jim Dooley, the noted personal injury lawyer?
MR. DIRKSEN:

Yes, he is. Your' Honor, and I

believe this was the last opinion that he -wrote.
Your Honors, I think it is important for the
Court to note that there is not much for me to elaborate
on on Justice Dooley's opinion.
QUESTION:

I simply agree with it»

If you are right, there isn’t

♦

35
anything more to say, is there?
MR. DIRKSEN:

And if there are no further ques­

tions, then I will conclude my argument.
QUESTION:

May I just ask this question,

MR. DIRKSEN:
QUESTION:

Certainly.

Is speed a necessary element in a

manslaughter conviction?
MR. DIRKSEN:

It wouldn't necessarily have to

be. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

It would not?

MR, DIRKSEN:

It would not have to be in every

case.
QUESTION:

You could have a guy driving down

the street at four miles an hour, couldn’t you or —
MR. DIRKSEN:
QUESTION:

Correct.

Or you could have a car trying to

leave a parking space that backed up at one mile an hour
and crushed somebody behind it.
MR. DIRKSEN:

Certainly you would, Your Honor.

I think maybe I should say something about the case be­
cause I have known it that long.
QUESTION:

Doesn’t that suggest that speed is

not an element?
MR. DIRKSEN:

You see, here wa are not talking

about the amount of speed, we are talking about tie fact

that he failed to reduce it, the fact that he failed to
reduce speed resulted in a collision with a person, and
the death of that person resulted in another charge or
two other charges being filed against that same man,
those charges being involuntary manslaughter.
QUESTION:

Suppose you had a mechanic underneath

an automobile and one got in it and drove off without
looking, he would drive off, how could he reduce it below
zero?
QUESTION:

Well, he could reduce it to zero,

couldn’t he?
MR. DIRKSEN:

He could. Your Honor, and I

think —QUESTION:

From five miles an hour he could

reduce It to zero and then he wouldn’t have had a collision.
MR. DIRKSEN:

I say I simply think the state in

this ease, they simply erred

and .they are coming before

this Court and saying would you please rectify our error
because we don't want to set a bad precedent in Illinois.
This wouldn’t happen In an adult case.

It would not

have happened if the state had kept its eye on things.
After all, this young man was charged on November 20,
197^., with a traffic offense.
They had plenty of time.

He was tried a month later.

The juvenile officer in South

Holland necessarily had to go to the juvenile court,

37
which is loaded with states attorneys, get the necessary
petitions to file for an adjudication of delinquency, he
obviously had those in his —- I mean this is supposition,
but he had to have them at least the next day after the
trial because we are talking about a trial that John
Vitale went through, and now the state is saying we want
another trial because he only had a $15 fine.
QUESTION:

Well, you are not saying under no

circumstances under federal jeopardy could he be tried
for two totally separate offenses, are you?
MR. DIRKSEN:

No, Your Honor.

I don’t have

the argument with the offenses, I have the argument with
the multiple trials.

There can be separate offenses

tried in a single proceeding, but I don’t think you can
take one act and carge a number of offenses out of that
act and then have separate and successive prosecutions
except in extremely limited circumstances.
QUESTION:

How about the statement in Ash v.

Swinson that you could bring a person to trial for
killing six different poker players if he had not been
acquitted in the first trial?
MR. DIRKSEN:

Well, I agree completely with

the holding in Ash v. Swanson because, as I understand
that case, it was simply a question of identity and —QUESTION:

There was an acquittal In Ash0

38
MR. DIRKSEN:

I know, but I mean double jeopardy

applies whether there Is an acquittal or a conviction.
QUESTION:

But It doesn't necessarily mean that

you can’t try a man for two different offenses„
MR. DIRKSEN:

In extremely limited circumstances.

They have certain

requirements that are placed on them.
QUESTION:

Would you be here, would you be

making this argument except for the state statute, the
compulsory joinder rule?
MR. DIRKSEN:
QUESTION:

Not —

Well, let’s suppose that there had

been no state rule at all and there had been these same
prosecutions in the Supreme Court of Illinois who said
this was double jeopardy.

QUESTION:

But you would say that there is a

one transaction test, or don't you?
MR. DIRKSEN:
need to go that far.

Mo, Your Honor, I don't think we
I am very aware of Mra Justice

Brennan's and Mr. Justice Marshall's transaction test.
I don't think we even need go that far.

I agree with them

but I don't think we need to go that far because we are
not talking about one transaction, we are talking about
one act.

There was an act of an accident, that accident

resulted in a traffic charge -and two deaths.

And as I

pointed out In my brief, :Lf you can take that one act,
you could create not only the offense of failing to
re.duce speed to avoid an accident, you could also erea.te
involuntary manslaughter, you could create reckless
homicide, you could create reckless conduct, reckless
driving, failing
QUESTION:

You are asking them for a principle

that has never been enunciated by this Court if for one
act you can only be charged once.
Ohio doesn't say that.

Certainly, Brown v.

MR. DIRKSEN:

No, I’m not saying that, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

You at least say you must abandon the

offense test.

MR. DIRKSEN:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, all I am saying —

You suggest that even if the offenses

are different, and even if to prove the one you don’t need
to prove something that is involved in the other --MR. DIRKSEN:

No, I say you could prosecute those

offenses but you have to do it in one trial.

You can’t

take one after the other.
QUESTION:

I know you do.

I know you do, but

that has not been the rule —
MR. DIRKSEN:

No, that is what I started with,

Your Honor, in our own compulsory joinder statute.
QUESTION:

I know, but I want to know, aside

from your compulsory joinder statute»
MR. DIRKSEN:

I still think all charges that

arise out of one act, the separate offenses can be tried
but they have to be tried together.
QUESTION:

What case do you rely on from this

Court for that proposition?
QUESTION:

Hopefully this one?

You are standing on the Illinois

law when you make that argument, aren’t you?
MR. DIRKSEN:

Well, our compulsory joinder

42
statute does provide that, so that is a good place to start.
I mean, it —
QUESTION:

It is a good place to finish, too.

QUESTION:

It is a good idea to abandon a!sos

because that is a matter of your state law.

That has

never been held here as a matter of constitutional double
Jeopardy law»
ME. DIRKSEN:
QUESTION:

Judge, I am not going to —

On the other hand, Brown v. Ohio was

decided by this Court under the double Jeopardy provision
as applied to the states for the Fourteenth Amendment and
that involved lesser included offenses, and I would think
that your argument would be based squarely on that ease.
MR. DIRKSEN:
with you.

Your Honor, I couldn’t more agree

I am simply stating my position philosophic­

ally, but I do agree with the decision of Justice Dooley.
QUESTION:

.All right.

Mr. Dirksen, can I ask you, under

'

che failing to reduce speed statute in Illinois, I notice
your client was only fined $15»

What was the maximum

penalty under that statute?
MR. DIRKSEN:

Your Honor, it was a Class C

misdemeanor, it could have carried up to a $500 fine and

43
30 days in jail.
QUESTION:

Thirty days.

MR. DIRKSEN:

Yes.

Court.
