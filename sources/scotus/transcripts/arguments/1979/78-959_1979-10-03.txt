ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD B. BOUDIN, ESQ,,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR„ BOUDINs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas® the

Courts
The issue in this case, one of statutory construction
with constitutional implications, is whether Congress, in
using the term "bribery** in 18 USC 1932, the Travel Act,
intended to ref©:? to bribery

of

public officials, a® used

in the common law, or whether included the term, commercial
bribery, under—which is involved solely in this case.
- ..'-I

The Travel Act, as this Court will recall, insofar

as relevant her®, makes it a crtm®, a felony, punishable by
$5,000 or five years in prison—$10,000—to use intarst&t®
commerce, including the mails, for the purpose of facilitating
an unlawful activity.
And on© ©£ the unlawful activities described here
is bribery.

The facts not being before this Court, in view

of the limited certiorari, it is sufficient for me to say that
the petitioner in © private consulting geologist, wh© was
convicted after a jury trial, charged with participating in

4
tha bribery of a private employee of a privat® concern?, and
that there appear to be two telephone sails and ©nes interstat®
shipment; non® incriminating data involved in this casa»
Now, in construing the statute—and it's a most
interesting problem of statutory construction we have here—-the
problem is to determine what Congress, and only Congress,
intended in the bribery act; not to determine what a state
intended, or as Nardello—*to which 1 will refer later—points
out, what a state» label was.
What did Congress intend?

In considering the intent

of Congress», we have the familiar but controlling and important
canons-of construction in a ©as© ©f this kind.
First, of esare®, is whether tha ton® "bribery" has
plain meaning,

And 2 must say that the government's arguments

that bribery is not to be considered as a common law formulation
but is to b@ determined by the Oxford Dictionary--or
Webster's—doos not. seem persuasive, particularly when one
realises that if one turns to the legal dictionaries, like
Bowler or Black, on® finds that they us® the term-including
the most recent edition of Black—in the technical, common
law sans©,
Just to taka on® example ©f Black, 1911 just raad the
first few lines*

"The offering, giving, receiving, or

soliciting of anything of value t© Influence actions as
official, or in discharge of legal or public duty....3

3
In contrasting these two definitions, on® has to
remember Mr, Justice Holms * statement, which I read recently
in Justice Frankfurter8s Gardosa lectures many years ago, that
Congress is prosumad to have intended to us© familiar legal
expressions in their familiar, legal sens®.
So I would say that on balano®

:

we probably com® out

bettor in our conception.
But let us turn to th® legislative history.

As Mr,

Justice Marshall pointed out in th© Lewis ease, it is a very
meager or limited legislative history.
The hearings clearly indicate, as Nartiello says and
Lewis says, that this was an attempt by Attorney General
Kennedy to give a package ©£ organised crim© legislation t©
the Congress.

And there ar© statements! made, particularly in

th© course of testimony before th© Committe®, by Attorney
General Kennedy himself, and in a supplementary letter to
Congressman Cellar, signed by Deputy Attorney General, now
Mr,, Justice Whit©, indicating that this was an organised ©rime
statute, and that shakedowns war© used by organised crime.
Th® interesting thing i® that there is no testimony
in the record, no claim by Attorney General Kennedy or by
his assistant, Mr* Miller of the criminal division, that
organised ©rim® ever used commercial bribery.

And what there

is in this record are two or three vary interesting statement®,
which we've quoted in our brief, of Attorney General Kennedy

6
in which th® subject of bribery, the only times when it is
\

mentioned in th® «sours® ©f th® Senate and Bourn® hearings „ is
always with reference t© th® bribery of government officials,
QUESTION:

Mr, Boudin?

MR, BOUDIN:

Yes£, lour Honor.
TJo you fael that th© old decisions ©f

QUESTION:

this Court, Justice Storey, Hudson, Goodwin and so forth,
help you or hinder you when they say there is no federal

comooh

law of crime?
MR, BOUDIN:
hindrance,-

1 donet think they hav© any help or

They are merely statements that the Federal Code

does include common law crimes.

But they are not a reason

why Congress does not turn to tfe® common law definition, and
why th© courts d©n*t look to sommn law definitions to determine
what Congress had in mind.
And I think, actually, that was done to some extent
in th© Dunn case.

But I will com® t© that, Your Honor,

As I say“«sorry, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

In the legislative history, is there any

reference to labor racketeering and bribery of labor officials,?
MR. BOUDIN %

Yes, I noticed the government, in its

brief, made reference to some problems of labor corruption.
But th© Court will not©, which I hav© r©g retfcably not noted
in ray reply brief, that that referred to a different bill, a
different bill dealing with immunity, which was before th©

7
Congress., and which referred to labor and the Taft-Hartley
law.
It never--there was never any reference to discussing
this bill, to labor racketeering.

I hope the Court will read

that record to see that I am correct.
Now, the government says, by referring to current
books, that labor unions, or labor“-sorry, that organised
crime now does use commercial bribery.
Itc s & little hard to take a book written in 1972 or
1973, and to draw the conclusion that this Congress, in 961, and
these committees, were considering a subject they never
discussed, namely, the use of commercial bribery by organised
crime.
QUESTIONS
MR. BOUDIN?
QUESTIONS

Well, Mr. Boudin—
Yes, Your Honor.
—what is the occasion for a Court to

delve deeply into the legislative history, unless it is assumed
that the word bribery is ambiguous?
MR. BOUDINs

Yas.

Well, 1 think that I must say that

the word bribery here—I would prefer to say that the word
bribery has an absolutely clear meaning, and should be considered
in its common law definition.
But as I balance the dictionaries, and as I realize
the history of bribery for so many years, and the us© in
penal codes, and the use by the draftsmen, to which I will

8
refer in a few minutes, you sea that bribery has a very special
limited official connotation.
If one, for example, were to look at the Federal
criminal code as it existed in 1961, on© would so© that
Chapter XI refers to bribery, graft and conflict of interest.
And the one section there entitled "Bribery,M deals with—
Section 201--with the bribery of government officials.
I would like to be. able to say that the situnticr.
is absolutely clear.
"bribery" means.

There is no dispute what the word

But candor requires that we ..-assess the

situation to say, yes, this term, as used in the statute, is
ambiguous? and that's why we turn to the legislative history,
and to the other canons to which I will rafer.
Now, just to continue for a moment, if I may, Mr.
Chief Justice, with respect to legislative history, as I said
I don’t think that given that the--that a book written
currently, or even a book written earlier, which was not before
the committee, and which it didn’t, consider, is very ps:
evidence as to the meaning of the word bribery.
And I prefer, if I may say so, the words of Judge
Gerfain who wrote ths Brecht opinion on which we relied in the
Second Circuit.

And it describes—

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER (CONT'D)
MR. BOUDINs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
My reference when we ended to Judge Gerfein in the
Brecht case had in mind his long history as a prosecutor of
organized crime in the labor racketeering field.

And, I give

some weight, as against soma of these books that are mentioned
by the government, to his statement that organized crime does
not usually use commercial bribery as a component, and he
described, it as an establishment crime.

It is not.

But the question is, what

And the government says, and we deny,

II
that organised crime, according to the legislative history,
used commercial bribery,,

Whereas, as we have pointed out, the

government, in its brief, in Nardello, and the view expressed
by—-adopted by this Court in footnote 11, page 293, said,
bribery has traditionally focused on corrupt activities by
public officials»
Now, if I may turn to the next principle on which I
rely, it is that of the common law definition assumed to be
that of Congress,

I touched on it in an answer to a question

put by Justice Rehnqulat, and I want to leave that by simply
referring this Court to its decisions in Turley and in

?
Morrisett,

particularly to M:r, Justice Jackson's comment in

Morrisetfc, that when Congress borrows terms of art, which “.re
accumulated legal tradition meanings of centuries, it normally
intends to adopt those views.
Turning next to the federal complex of statutes and
stata statutes, X treat them briefly, because all they are ar©
guideposts,

And the significant aspects, if Congress looked at

the state statutes and said, what is considered bribery?, the
significant aspects are, in contrast to Nardello--which again
1 will touch on, or fully—there is a clear line of demarcation
between the state statutes dealing with bribery and called
bribery, although the name is not critical-— it9s the line
demarcation that’s important—and state statutes dealing with
commercial bribery or various variations.

12
And this lin® of demarcation is followed by the
codifiers,, by those who prepare™the American Law Institute
people—who prepare the model penal codes? by the working
papers of the Brown Commission? and indeed,, by the very
legislation now pending before tha Congress, the current new
criminal code, in which a distinction is recognised, as it is
in tli© textbooks, like Perkins and others, to which the
government refers, between crimes against sovereignty, and
crimes against property,
I have in our brief delineated

the

examples of

that.
How, I want-"-sorry, Your Honor,

MR. BOUDIN'S

It's very hard—it's a sort of sport, if

I may us© the expression.

Xt9s a special kind of situation in

which you have so many state bribery statutes involving sports.
If I had to categorise them, I would say it's a variety of
commercial bribery, or perhaps it reflects the special concern
of the American legislators, and people, for that particular

13
aspect, which was a national scandal, 1 think, in about 1962

was a football player on a state-supported, state university
football team, or a professional team, as to whether it was
public or private?
MR. BOUDINj

I don't think so,

I think the real

question is what Congress had in mind in passing this
statute,

had Congress did not have in mind, if I may say,

despite Senator Keating's passing observations, and the other
congressional hearings, with respect t© its sports bribery
statutes.
To me, the critical problem which we fas© her® before
the Court is that on which the government takes issue with us.
And that is, what is the meaning ©f Nardello?
I already said what the Court said in Nardello with
respect to bribery.

But why did the? Court decide Nardello as it

did?
It would be vary strange if the Court expanded
bribery in this case—this Court expanded bribery in this
case, or used the term broadly? I don't want to beg the
question—when the broad definition of extortion in Nardello
was based on the government's argument in Nardello that this

14
broad definition ©f extortion was required because there was a
narrow ooBoeption of bribery.
Now talcing Nardell© on the merits , Nardellc was
based on a legislative history in which Attorney General
Kennedy said that organized crime used extortion; it was
based upon the blending by legislation and judicial decision
of extortion and blackmail,, unlike our line of demarcation

her®; it was based upon the fact that, as the government pointed
out so well in its Nardello brief,, upon which most of my
/

knowledge comas' here, that extortion by legislators alone was
inconsistent with a statute directed at extortion by organised
crime.
And finally the Court said, and obviously we refer
to that,, have no problem with it* that lab®Is of blackmail
could not obscure the fact that Nardello was engaged in
extortionate conduct even under stata law.
Now, 1 want to suggest also to the Court, as w© have
in the last pages of our brief, that an expansive interpre­
tation of the term "bribery" would, under Lewis and many other
decisions of the Court, alter sensitive federal and stata
relationships, by transforming minor offenses into federal
felonies.
And I think that as the Court said in Bass—I think
it was Mr. Justice Marshall who wrote the ©pinion, there--unless
Congress conveys its purpose clearly—I'm using the Justice9s

15
words--than this kind of restructuring to take car© of minor
crimes is impermissible.

And ind@©d, this restructuring is a

rather strange thing, because it is an anachronism even in the
federal system.

Thus, for example, 29 USC 138(a)» which deals

with gratuities to trad® 'anion officials, is a misdemeanor.
■v

Section 215 of 18 USC refers to gratuities received by a banking
official? it’s a misdemeanor.
This statute,, which would mice a telephone call to a
banking official, or from him, or a telephone call by a labor
union agent, a felony.

I think, therefore, that you have a

problem with respect to the restructuring of the federal system
as wall as the states.
Now this is, in my view, if I may suggest it, exactly
the kind of case with which this Court dealt in discussing
the principle of lenity.

It is a case where, in the word® of

Batchelder and Culbert, words do not plainly impos® meaning.
We don6t which dictionary definition was chosen, even
in th© Oxford, to take the government's example.
whether the common law should be disregarded.

We don't know

We don't know

?

whether the principle of

Wiltberger, namely, that you

construe

penal laws narrowly, should be disregarded.
You take all of those considerations, and it calls
hare for a principle of lenity, which this Court, I think, in
th© Bunn case, pointed out has a constitutional basis, in ®x
post facte principles, and*»-

16
QUESTIONs

Was that raised as a constitutional

question in the courts below?
MR, BOUDIN %

Yes.

The issue of notice liras raised

in the court below at page 192 to 192 of th© transcript.
QUESTION'S
MR. BOUDIN %

The constitutional question?
Yes, the constitutional issue ©f notice.

But I don't think that is really th© problem her®,
I think the problem her© is th® construction of a statute,, and
that construction of a statute, whether the issue had been
raised below or not, calls for th© principle of lenity,
particularly where you have here a very minor—-I think a small
fish, I'm paraphrasing, was the word used by Judge Rubin
dissenting in th© court below in this easa.
I would also urge, the Court, in considering this
problem, to not© that this is probably th© third case in
18 years involving the applications to commercial bribery of
Section 1252.

At least, we have not been able to find any.

And of course we know in Brecht, in Brecht th© Court cam© to a
different conclusion.
So we are left her© with a Pomponio,
Perrin's situation.

and Mr.

This is clearly th© kind of case where

we cannot say what was said in Scarborough, that there is a
clear history.

It’s the kind of © eas© in which wa--fche history

is on our side.
And I think the construction ©f th© words, bearing in

1?
mind its long history,, is on our side.
f

Now, to conclude, at least for the moment, let me
suggest to the Court what it is asked by the government to do.
It is asked by the government feo define a criminal statute
which is at best ambiguous% which has been @n£oread against the
defendant twice—or group of defendants twice—in 18 years.
It is asked to construe it differently from the
common law; broadly .rather than strictly, although it*s a
penal statuta? under a. definition which, among others, may be
found in popular dictionaries, or even learned dictionaries
like Oxford? under a definition which is contrary to all
legal, dictionaries that I've seen? which when they use the
term "commercial bribery," use it as a separate heading.
It is asked to construe it contrary to legislative
/ •

history, of which there is vary little, but whatever is on
our side.

It is asked t© construe it contrary—contrary—to

the views expressed do this Court by the Solicitor General of
the United States in ffardallo, in the passage to which I have
referred Your Honors, in the original brief.
Pid I submit my vary high regard for that office, and
I'm sure tie courts, of course, leads us to conclude that the
Solicit©/ General did not suggest that bribery had a narrow
definition—if I can call it narrow—limited to public officials
for strategic reasons in Nardallo, but had stated its view in

Mr. Shapiro?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TEE RESPONDENT.
MR. SHAPIROs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Court?
The government contends that th® Travel Act prohibits
the use of interstat® facilities to promote all forme of
bribery illegal under state or federal law, including
commercial bribery.
In establishing that proposition, we rely on the
text of the Travel Act, the contemporary meaning of the words
used in the Act, and felt© Act's legislative history.
In addition, we rely on ‘this Court's decision in the
case of Unitsd States again Nardello, which provides.'the rule
of statutory interpretation which w© believe is controlling
here.
X would like now to take up ©aeh of thee.® points
r>

separately.
The literal terns ©£ the Travel Act extend t©
brib@ry in violation of the laws ©f th© United States, or th®
state in which the crime is committed.

Unlike other federal

criminal statutes, such as the official bribery statute, the

/

/

19
Travel Act does not limit ite coverage to a particular kind of
bribery,,

Without any limiting modifier, the term "bribery”

has a generic meaning? that is, th® giving or the receipt ©f
something of value in order to corrupt th© judgment or fch©
action of someone in & position of trust.
The ordinary meaning of the word “bribery" includes
official corruption, but it's not limited to official
corruption, as Webster's dictionary reminds.
Counsel has nonetheless contended that th© weight of
authority in legal dictionaries i® differant from the weight
of authority in th® Oxford English Dictionary, and in
Webster6 s dicfcionary„
QUESTIOM%

But Mr. Shapiro, wouldn't on® expect, in

view of the very specific language in—-about th® payment of
federal excise tax in 1026, that the bribery, if it be
federal bribery her©, be a violation of a specif is briberystatute, and not just of some generic concept ©f bribery?
MR. SHAPIROs

W® think that Congress deliberately

selected a general word without reference to a particular kind
of bribery, because it meant to embrace various federal and
various state bribery statutes, and it didn't wish to include
a long enumeration of: those statutes, or state arson or
extortion statutes.
It would h© quit© a lengthy and a cumbersome statute
if each on® of th© specific offenses was ©numerated.

20
QUESTION?

And what federal bribery statute do you

contend was violated h©r@?
MR, SHAPIRO?

We contend that it was a state bribery

statute that was violated through use of interstat® facilities#
giving rise to a violation of the Travel Act,
QUESTION?

So w© ns©dn9t worry about actual federal

bribery statutes on the books# because you need# in order to
succeed# in order to show that the Louisiana commercial, bribery
statute was violated?
MR, SHAPIRO?

That6as correct# Your Honor,

We d®p©nd

on a violation of a Louisiana statute facilitated through the
us© of interstet© facilities.
Counsel has contended for a common law definition of
the word "bribery/'5 pointing to the legal dictionaries# which
he contends are different from th© popular dictionaries.

But

Black * s law dictionary defines a bribe# bribery# as the offering
or soliciting of anything of value to influence action as an
official# or in discharge ©f legal duty.

And it gives a °»

examples common law bribery and commercial bribery.
Th© same is true in Wharton's Law Lexicon which
define® a bribe as a gift to any person# office# or holding a
position of trust# with* the ©bjeet ©f inducing him to disregard
hi® official duty or betray hie trust.

Again# the examples

that are given ars official bribery and bribery of agents and
employees

21
The legal dictionaries use the term the same way
Webster’s dictionary and the Oxford dictionary usas th© word,
as a generic designation covering both official and non-official
bribery,
Instead of designating a particular kind of bribery,
such as official bribery, th® statute refers to bribery offenses
prohibited under the laws of Congress or th® laws of the states.
Because the scope of th© Act is delineated by reference to
state or federal bribery law, we believe that it is most
significant that a large number of state and federal bribery
laws have prior to th® enactment of th© Travel Act, explicitly
extended to non-official bribery.
This pattern of statutes confirms that in contemporary
legal usage, in 1961, the term bribery bad a far broader
meaning than official bribery.

Prior

to

enactment of the

Travel Act, Congress prescribed non-official bribery in a
variety of different criminal laws.
x

For example. Congress prohibited bribery in'’-the sale

©f liquor? bribery in the procurement of interstat® transpor­
tation? and bribery

of contestants appearing in television

quis» shows,
Th© situation in the states was similar.

By 1961,

43 states? had adopted criminal laws prohibiting various for®»
©£ non-official bribery, including bribery of employees, of
agents, bribery of workers in particular kinds of industries,

22
bribery of labor union officials, and bribery of athletes
participating in sporting events.
Because this statutes coverage is defined by
reference to state and federal bribery law, the widespread
existence of statutes forbidding commercial and other forms of
non-official bribery is a strong indication that 'the Travel
Act should have a. oo-extensiva reach.
We submit that it would be highly inappropriate to
assume that Congress was unaware of th® fact that most of the
states in the union had enacted criminal laws forbidding nonofficial corruption.

And it would be even more extraordinary

to assume that Congress was unaware of its own criminal legis­
lation making commercial bribery a crime.
Although the legislative history of th® statute is
limited, th© hearings show that the proponents of this statute
understood the contemporary generic meaning of th© word
"bribery."
QUESTION*

If Congress has made commercial bribery

a crime, why do you have to rely on Louisiana statutas?
MR. SHAPIRO*

Congress* commercial bribery statutes

refer to particular industries where th© problem was felt
to be ©specially acuto, for example, bribery in interestate
transportation? bribery in th® sal© of liquor.
QUESTION’S
here, then?

You couldn't convict under those statutas

23
MR, SHAPIRO:

That1s correct, Your Honor,

You ne@d

the Louisiana statute a® a predicate.
Senator Keating, who was a proponent of this statute,
and who participated in its drafting, stated specifically that
he understood that the Travel Act would apply to bribery in
sporting events.

This shows pretty clearly that Congress

did

not envision the statute as applying only to official bribery.
No contrary views war® ever expressed during the
hearings.

And during the hearings ©n this bill and a

companion bill, which were heard altogether in a package,
several of the witnesses, as well as the Attorney General,
stated the view that various forms of non-official corruption
were bribery? for example, bribery of labor union officials
and bribery-«bribery in sporting events „
No Congressman or representative from the Department
of Justice ever suggested that the Act should be limited to
official bribery.
The legislative history als© shows that the dominant
purpose of the Travel Act was to cut off the flow of profits
to organised criminals by depriving them of the use of inter­
stat® facilities to carry ©n their illegal activities,

Por

this reason the statute prohibits arson and extortion, both
of which ara used by criminal® t© play on honest business
firms, and to increase illicit revenues.
Commercial bribery is likewise used by organised

24
crime to increase the flow of money which Congress meant to cut

off«
Congressional hearings, both before and after enact­
ment of this statute, confirm the extent t© which criminals
snake use of commercial bribery to infiltrate honest business.
Organised crime uses commercial bribery to steal securities
from brokerage houses; to pledge them with banks and other
lending institutions, who sell worthless ©r fraudulent stock
to institutional investors; end to steal valuable cargoes
through the connivance of bribed workers.
QUESTION;

1 suppose organised crimes—crime uses

various other—or offends various, other local laws that
concededly are not covered by the Travel Act, too?
MR. SHAPIRO?

Well, that®s quit® correct, Your Honor.

We contend, though, that treatment of commercial bribery as a
subspecies of the offenses of bribery would .promote the
congressional purpose to cut off the flew of money—
QUESTION?

Well, so would inclusion of a lot of

other crimes that are local crimes that are not—that are
concededly not covered by the Travel Act.
MR. SHAPIRO;

That’s quit® true.

If they don’t fall

under the word "bribery" —
QUESTION *

So that3 s the questions

isn’t it covered?
MR. SHAPIRO?

Well, that's true.

Is it covered ©r

25
QUESTION8

Not whether organised crime uses these

extends generically to different varieties of bribery, including
commercial bribery.

Mr. Shapiro, counsel indicated that this was

a rare prosecution, ©r ©fe least was an early one.

Do you

agree?
MR, SHAPIRO?

There have b®®n relatively few

commercial bribery prosecutions under the statute,, du© in
part to the difficulties in detecting these offenses.'

But

there have been some.
There have been three reported decisions in the
Courts of Appeals, involving commercial bribery prosecutions.
Thar© have been two reported decisions in the district
courts, and four other casas are referred to, unreported
opinions, at the District Court level.
The Department, at present, has investigations
pending into td.despread commercial bribery which may, in th®
future, result in additional prosecutions.

Companion bills that were considered in

And we think that these references by the Attorney

General, and the other Congressmen who participated in the
hearings, show that these Congressmen understood the contempo­
rary generic meaning of the word “bribery.”
Because Congress prohibited bribery under the Act in
general terms, without limitation to a particular king of bribery,
and because the legislative history supports a generic reading

of the statute, In our view, the Court of Appeals correctly
concluded that this Court8® decision in United States against
Nardelie provides the applicable rule of statutory interpre­
tation.

In Nardello, this

Court held that the word "extortion/3

which appears in the same portion of the hot as the word
"bribery/* should be given a generic meaning, and should not ba

QUESTIONs

What «about the footnote in Nardello that

your opponent relies upon?
MR» SHAPIROs

The Court did, indeed, point out that

bribery has traditionally focused on corruption of public
officials»

But the Court, did not undertake a comprehensive

r@\7iew of the offense.
If it had gone into the details of the development of
!

this offense, it would have seen that by 1906, commercial
bribery was a criminal offense in Great Britain, and that by
the turn of the century. Congress had enacted criminal laws
forbidding commercial bribery, and, the states had as well.
I think the| Court’s footnote statement is a fair
generalisation, but it doesn’t purport to exhaust th© subject.
QUESTION?

How about your brief in that case?

MR. SHAPIRO?

I don’t think our brief goes any

further than that footnote.

I think it a imply says that

traditionally—traditionally, that offense is referred to

30
public officials.

But as a matter ©£ fact;, by 1906, it had

gona quit® beyond that in Great Britain, and shortly after,
it had gon© far beyond that both at the federal level and in
the states*

official misconduct.

What was the purpose of the government pointing out
in the Nardelio brief, and in this footnote, that bribery was
traditionally narrowly limited to public officials unless it
was the government's view that bribery was so limited under

MR, SHAPIROs

X think that the brief speaks in

generalities, and that it meant only to indicato that, at
common law, that this was the traditional focus of the
offense of bribery.
I don't think it purported t© go into a detailed
analysis of th® development of the offense.

But it's not correct—

Why not just call it a dictuip?

MR. SHAPIRO:

I think it9® fairly described as a

dictum in both the opinion and the brief, and that further
research into the development of tills offense shows that there
is more to the story than that brief summary.
In contending for a limitation of the Act to official
bribery, petitioner argues, of course, that in common law the
term "bribery"’ was limited to various forms of official
corruption? and that the Travel Act should be limited to that
same scope.
In our view, the Nardello case really is a sufficiant
answer to that assertion.

Nardello declined-to adopt th©

common lav; definition ©£ th® word "extortion,” concluding that
the modern generic interpretation was better suited to serving
Congress' purposes„

MR. SHAPIRO:

Absolutely.

It's the very same issue.

Petitioners also argued that the Travel Act cannot
b© applied her© because extension of the Act to commercial
bribery without ® proven association with organised crime
would result in the prosecution of insignificant local offenses,
anet would extend federal jurisdiction over state crimes.
We note in response that the present case is far
from an insignificant on©, involving as it doss a well
organised criminal venture intended to exploit stolen geologi­
cal data showing the location of oil deposits.
And as a general matter, ther* is no reason to assume
that commercial bribery is likely to involve an insignificant
offense.

Both official and commercial bribery have the clear

potential to injure the public§ in addition to enriching
■ «fcv.

criminals and inflicting private losses, commercial bribery
has til© potential to cut off honest competition, and feo e©us©

th© distribution of inferior products to the consuming public.
Th© prosecution ©f commercial bribery under th©
Travel Act, like prosecution of official bribery, will
naturally involve an ©st©reis@ of authority ovar parsons who
violat® stata law.
But th® Act was clearly intended to have just that
effect.

It explicitly applies to bribery illegal under

federal or state law.

" ’;i" :‘

As this Court has repeatedly pointed out, th© very
purpose of th© Act was to aid local law enforcement officials
by planishing parson® who use interstate facilities to
carry on the designated illegal activities.
And there's nothing improper, w® submit, about
applying substantial penalties to violations of th© Act when
it’s triggered by state law offenses„

Congress believed that

interstate schemes to carry on bribery in violation of either
federal or state law posed a serious national threat.
And where the facilities of interstate commerce atr®
used, it is for Congress to select the means necessary to
punish and deter th© offenders.
Petitioner's final contention, of course, is that
his conviction must be reversed under th© rule of lenity.
H© argue®, in this connection, that the statuta is vague,
and it must therefor© be narrowly construed in his favor.
But th© Travel Act does not present a vagueness

40

probi®®,

Th© statuta literally read extends to bribery without

limitation on its kind.

The literal, dictionary meaning of

the word "bribery" is generic.
When the hot was passed, the word "bribery" had
been applied repeatedly to commercial corruption in a wide
variety of different federal and state criminal laws.

Tha

legislative history of the Act, although it's sparse, shows
that its proponents viewed the term "bribery" in a contempo­
rary generic sans®,
And the dead Rant statutory purpose, that is, cutting
off the flow of money to organised crime, strongly support the
view that commercial bribery should be covered.
This is not a cas© in which the defendant has a plausi™
ble claim that he could not hav® known that his conduct was
subject to criminal sanction.

He was well awar® that his

actions were wrongful, as th® evidence at trial showed.

E©

Louisiana criminal statute, which triggered application of th©
Travel Act.
QUESTION:

Have any charges ever been made against
/

this1 defendant under tha Louisian® law?
MR, SHAPIRO %

They have not, Your Honor.

He was,

of course, also on notice from this Court5s Mardell© decision

and would not fe® restricted to common law meanings.

to criminal penalties.

That3® our only point, that this isn’t

an innocent individual who believed that th© actions he was

petitioner became in his scheme—became involved in th© scheme

eommersial bribery.
That's e unanimous decision in United States agaitsfc
Pomponio.

This has not been a case in which th© defendant

We're talking about now about the

MR. SHAPIRO:

Whan there's no intarstat® commerce, than th©

Federal interest is no longer significant, but th® local

case, the nil© of strict construction is not required, where,

with that phrase, to say that now it only meant that it was
a central issue, ©r that it was 90 percent of time true.

You can also play around with the fact

that th© present Solicitor General does not take that position.

45
MR. BOUDIN:

Yas, of course.

And of course, the

Court in Hard®lie , in its footnote„ seemed to accept that
position.
Mow, if this is a question of a narrow construing,
not only of the meaning ©f the term "bribery," but we5re
now construing what the government's concession meant, just
simply adds another element to the indefiniteness of what we
are treating.
The government-»-and of course I hav© reference, with
all due respect, to than Deputy Attorney General's tying in
of the term bribery to the term ''official bribery,81 or
limiting it to that.

And the same idling was true of the

Attorney General Kennedy.
Your Honors will recall what government counsel just
said when h® was asked about what’s the major legislative
support that he has for believing that bribery means aerrr tq! ~
bribery—means that--commercial bribery.

And his answer was,

Senator Keating's observation on sports bribery.
If you will look at, if X may suggest it, th®
hearings in th® case, and you will see how the somewhat
personalised statement by a tingle legislator that nobody
caught on to, that was passed ovar, and this Is considered
th© largest legislative support.
1 suggest that if w® want to see other support for

ay position that w® look.at 18 USC 1961.

1951 is a statute

4S
which talks about bribery in on© case, refers to section 201
as relating to bribery, and then talks about sections 224 and
others relating to bribery;, others relating to sports bribery.
At best we have an ambiguity hers as to th© meaning
of th® term.

Th® government ha& referred Your Honors also to

references to labor corruption.

I touched on it a moment

before.
Your Honora will see, at pages 31 to 46 and 272,
of the House hearingshaven't put that in our brief.» but
perhaps 1 can shortly in a letter, if Your Honor permits—-th®
government was talking about the Immunity Act.

There is not a

word—a proposed Immunity Act—there is not a word in
dealing with this statute about labor corruption.
The government pulls out now what th© Congress must
have known about a statute passed in 1906 in Great Britain.
Again, if this is how w® are to interpret legislation, then I
suggest it gives an aura of ambiguity to th© statuta.
Under dictionaries, I have addressed myself t© that.
X would urge Your Honors t© look at those dictionaries and
a©a whether those dictionaries consistently in ray favor, if
they are legal dictionaries.
But quit® a@id@ from that, all they do really is
indicate that there is an ambiguity in the meaning of th® word
"bribery.*

And th® question is, whether in this ©as®, unlike

many other®, a penal statute, whether ©r not th® statute is to

47
be construed broadly or narrowly.
A reference has beon made to the open-ended aspect of
the statute, as read by the government.
suggested that there are wayn out for it.

And it’s been
But if you take my

construction ©f the statute, which I think is Congress’, and
it is only Congress’ view, and not what a state law says, and
not what one dictionary-or another says, it is Congress8 view,
mine gives a non-open-ended situation, because public bribery,
governmental bribery, has a precise meaning.
Under the government9® definition, the moment a state
passes a statute like Wisconsin, for example, providing for a
§25 fine for a gratuity—because ©fa gratuity paid to a
chauffeur*—we then have a real open-ended, situation.
Did Congress intend to make the §25 gratuity to a
chauffeur, or §100 to a lumberman in some other states, did it
intend to include that in the term "bribery"?

There is no

suggestion inthe l@gislatJ.va history that it did.
But if ©a® looks at it, if wo can stand aside and
say, what could Q&ngrees have meant in passing a statute
directed at organised crime where it had no evidence that
organised crime was using commercial bribery, it had a concrete
function and purpose, which a. national legislature would
have.
There is a vary sarious crime in the bribery ©£
public officials, the ©a© referred to by Deputy Attorney

\

43
General Whit®, by Attorney General Kennedy.

Bribery of public

officials is a critical mattery deserves their national
attention? and is the most reasonable application of the Travel
Act,
But to eay now that because bribery could be
interpreted by some definitions.to be broad, when commercial
bribery has a line of demarcation that Isv® indicated before,
is also to disregard what a reasonable Congress would have
intended in addressing itself t© this problem.
Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?
