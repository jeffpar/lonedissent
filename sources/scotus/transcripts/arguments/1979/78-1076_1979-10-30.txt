MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-1G76, Rhode Island against Innis.
Mr. Attorney General?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS J. ROBERTS, II, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This matter is before the Court this morning on a
petition for certiorari directed to the Rhode Island Supreme
Court.
The respondent in this case, Thomas Innis, was found
guilty of kidnapping, robbery and murder by a Superior Court,
sitting with a jury, on November 12th, 1975.
During that trial, the Superior Court had denied a
'motion to suppress a shotgun that had been seised under the
circumstances that give rise to this petition for certiorari.
The case began on midnight, or shortly after
midnight, of January 16th, 1975.

A cab driver named Aubin

complained to the Providence Police Department that he5d been
assaulted by a man carrying a sawed off shotgun.

While he was

in the police department giving a statement, he observed
photograph

a

of the respondent, Thomas Innis, on a bulletin

board in the police department, and spontaneously identified
I'

his assailant as Thomas Innis.

i

/

4
The police put out a bulletin for a. search in the
area of the city of Providence where the cab driver had
dropped Innis off* the Mfc. Pleasant area.

At about 4?30 in

the morning, a patrol officer on Chalkstona Avenue in the
city of Providence saw Innis on a sidewalk and apprehended
him, handcuffed him, and gave him his Miranda.
QUESTION:

Previously, another cab driver had been

shot and killed?
MR. ROBERTS:
Your Honor.

A cab driver had been shot and killed.

The case which is before the Court this morning

involves the shooting and killing of that cafe driver, who at
that time had not yet—the body had not. yet been discovered.
The first patrol officer gave Innis.his Miranda
warnings for the first time.

Within a few minutes after that,

a Sergeant arrived and gave Miranda-«-gave Miranda warnings for
the second time to Innis.
Within two or three minutes after that, the
commanding—the night commander of the Providence Police
Department at that time, Captain Leyden, arrived on the scene
and gave Innis his Miranda warnings for the third time.
At that time, Innis assarted his right to have
counsel, at which point Captain Leyden directed that all
interrogation cease, that he be placed in a caged police car
with three police officers, and taken to the central police
station

5
This was done.

He was also specifically advised,

I should point out, that the--the suspect not be interrogated
on the way to the police station, and that there be no
conversation, no questioning, directed to him.
QUESTION;

You said he was placed in a caged

police car with three police officers?
MR. ROBERTS;

There were two police officers in the

front, seat, Your Honor—
QUESTION;

And one in the caged—

MR. ROBERTS;

—and one in the cage with Thomas

Innis.
Along the way--they had gone approximately two
minutes, and traveled approximately one-half mile to a
mile—-at that point the police officer on the passenger side
of the front seat said to the police officer in the driver’s
seat, it would be a shame--and X9m giving the substance of what
h«j said now? I'm not attempting to quote—it would be a shame
if one of the retarded children who goes to the school for the
handicapped in this neighborhood, should find that gun and
hurt himself.
At that point, Thomas Innis, to whom this had not
been directed as an interrogatory, volunteered;

Okay, take

me back to the scans? I'm going to show you where the gun is.
Thomas Innis was taken back t© the scene.

Captain

Leyden who was still there, removed him from the back seat of

6
the caged vehicle, and gave him for the fourth time his
Miranda rights.
At that point, Thomas Innis said no, X would like
to show you where the gun ia.

15m concerned that some of

the handicapped children at the school for the retarded in this
neighborhood might get hurt.
Thereupon, he took the police officers into a field,
and after a little bit of looking for it, they located the
sawed off shotgun.
He was subsequently charged with the murder of John
Mulvaney, the cab driver who had been missing at this point
for three or four days.

He was found guilty of kidnapping,

robbery and murder.
The sole issue before the Court this morning is the
question of suppression of the shotgun.
Mow, in a 3-2 opinion, which reversed the conviction
of Idle trial court, the majority of the Rhode Island Supreme
Court relied heavily on

the Brewer case, Brewer v. Williams.

Mow, Brewer of course specifically failed to consider
the Miranda doctrine, or the voluntariness of Williams5
statement.

Miranda played no part in Brewer, which strictly

was a Sixth Amendment case.
And as the Court pointed out in Brewer, the key to
invocation of Sixth Amendment rights must be, the commencement

of some kind of judicial proceeding, as clearly existed in

7
Brewer.
He, of course, had been arrested? he had been
arraigned? he was represented by two counsel? he was charged?
ha was on his way back to Bes Moines for further proceedings.
None of that is applicable in Innis.
QUESTION?

Welly isn't the basic issue here* in the

case before us, whether or not there was interrogation of
Innis?
MR. ROBERTS;

This is true, the question is whether

there—
QUESTION:

Isn't that really the question?

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I think there are several

questions, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, if there was no interrogation, you

win, don't you?
MR. ROBERTS:

If there was no Interrogation, I win.

However—
QUESTION;

And in Brewer, that was not an issue.

MR. ROBERTS:

No, it wasn't? it was clearly

interrogation involved.
QUESTION:

And every court that examined the Brewer

case described that so-called Christian burial speech as
interrogation.
MR. ROBERTS:
Stewart.

That is correct, Mr. Justice

In fact, Detective—

8
QUESTIOH;

That was not an issue in the case.
?

MR. ROBERTS;

Detective Captain Learning conceded

that his purpose was interrogation—
QUESTION;

Right,

MR. ROBERTS;
QUESTION;

-"in that case.

So we—

Well, not only in this Court, but every

court along the way; that had not been an issue.
MR. ROBERTS;
QUESTION;

That is true, Your Honor.

The issue in that case was whether or not

there had been a waiver.
MR, ROBERTS;

Well, waiver can become an issue in

this case.
QUESTION;

I know it can.

MR. ROBERTS;

If the Court concludes that there was

interrogation.
QUESTION;

Yas, I know.

MR, ROBERTS;

The State*5!?

position is, basically,

there was no custodial interrogation.

We don't dispute

custody, but we do dispute interrogation,
QUESTION;

Right.

MR. ROBERTS;

If there had been by some action of

the police--he had scrupulously observed the constitutional
rights of the accused—if there had been some custodial
interrogation, there was certainly knowing and voluntary
waiver by Innis on two occasions;

First, in the squad car,

9

and secondly, when he returned—
QUESTION:

But

you don't get to any question of

waiver if there was no interrogation?
MR. ROBERTS:
Justice Stewart.

That is absolutely correct, Mr.

That's absolutely correct.

The—and the question of interrogation, of course it
seem© to me, should turn on the question of intent to elicit
an incriminating response.

In other words, were these police

officers intending to trick the man?
There is much argument in respondent's briefs in
support of the conclusion that this was a skillful interro­
gative trick by a skillful police officer,

It overlooks the

fact that according to the record, Officer Gleckman, I believe
it is, who was the officer who made the statement, had gone
on the Providece Police Department in 19—November of 1973.
These events transpired in Jamiary of 1975.
patrol officer.

Ee had been a

He was not, as Captain. Learning was in

Brewer for example, a skilled interrogator,

The duration of

the trip was, I think they said, two or three minutes, and a
half-mile to one mile.

There was apparently an off-handed

remark made by one officer to another.

There was no attempt

here by a skilled interrogator to go after a known psychological
weakness, if you will, of a man who was known to be an
escaped mental patient and a religious fanatic.
All of the elements that applied to lead to the

20
conclusion that there was undoubtedly an interrogation in
Brewer do not apply in Innis.
So it seems to ms that in the Rhode Island Supreme
Court's reliance*, the majority's reliance,, on Brewer* they’re
both doctrinally and factually way off bass.

And it seems

to me that on that grounds alone* the decision of the majority
in the Rhode Island Supreme Court cannot stand.
When

you get into Miranda questions* the accepted

standards of Miranda* the State submits* could lead to the
mandate of a reversal.
we do have a waiver.

Because we don’t have interrogation,"
And further* the application of a per se

exclusionary rule* the extension of Wong Sun to the Miranda
procedural safeguards under the Fifth Amendment* simply is
not justified by the teachings of this Court* and is not
justified by principle.
As we go through the steps* everything that could
be found to support

the respondent's position, and support

the views of the Rhode Island Suprema Court’.* falls.
If there were interrogation* there would be a
waiver.

If there were an interrogation and there were no

waiver, the exclusionary rule should not b@ automatically
applied in this case* because the exclusionary rule should
turn on the totality of circumstances in the case and the
reliability of the evidence, and not upon a mere per se
extension of Wong Sun* Fifth Amendment, and beyond Fifth

11
Amendment , into the exclusionary—into ‘'die prophylactic
safeguards of Miranda.
So under all of these Miranda-typ® tests, the Suprema
Court decision below cannot stand.
There is another interesting alternative, which is
?

proposed, by Professor Granne--Professor Granno, in a
criminal law review article, this past summer's issue of the
Criminal Law Review, 17 American Criminal Law Review page 1%
He discusses

what he refers to there as th© rationale

approach to Miranda.

He distinguishes that from what I've

been discussing during the last few minutes, that is, the
black letter approach, he called, to Miranda.
The rationale approach, as I read it, is essentially
a voluntariness test of Miranda.
QUESTIONs

And what it turns on—

Well, that would overturn Miranda, of

course, wouldn't it?
MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, it certainly would, Your Honor,
\

QUESTIONs

That’s the overruling approach to

Miranda?
[Laughter.]
MR. ROBERTS:

I suspect that probably lurks around

in the back of Professor Granno's mind somewhere, Your Honor.
QUESTION :

And yours?

MR. ROBERTS:

And mine?

Well, Your Honor, from th®

point of view of prosecution, I feel—I feel that this Court

12
can. appropriately reserve the decision below merely by
consideration of Miranda standards.
On -the other hand, if the Court wished to pursue
something like Professor Gr&nno is suggesting in his rationale
approach, a voluntariness test, we certainly have no—we
would have no objection to the Court proceeding on that
ground.
1 think it’s a perfectly valid—perfectly valid
grounds for decision, Mr. Justice Whit©.
QUESTION2

How, you referred to the doctrinal and

factual distictions, or leak of it, by the Rhode Island
Supreme Court.

If you taka Innia out of the back seat of

that car and put Brewer in it and have the Christian burial
speech mads by -die two men in the front seat, you'd have
this case all over ©gain, wouldn't you?
MR. ROBERTSs
QUESTIONS

1 don't believe so, Your Honor.

This fellow had never been charged.

MR. ROBERTS;

This man was not charged; we did not

have the commencement of any criminal—
QUESTIONt

Ha was under arrest and in custody,

wasn't he'?
MR. ROBERTSs

He was in custody, Mr. Chief Justice.

But there had been no formal arraignment; there"d been no
formal charge.

He was being brought t© the station.

I'm

not aware of any case which has extended back to the point of

13
custody th©—~
QUESTIONs

Whan we talk-—Miranda daa.Is with

custodial interrogation, .doesn’t it?
MR. ROBERTS:

That is correct, Mr, Chief Justice.
\

QUESTION:

And Massiah deals td.th something quits

different?
MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

It certainly does? it certainly does.

What did—what violation was found in

Brewer?
MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

Violation of Sixth Amendment rights—

So, said Miranda is a Fifth Amendment

case, isn’t it?
MR. ROBERTS:
ye®, sir.

Mr. Justice White, that’s correct,

It’s a Fifth Amendment case, and as Professor—I

think excellent language illustrating the purpose of Miranda
is Professor Granno’s article—
QUESTION:

But you should be able to say at the

outset that Brewer is irrelevant?
MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

I believe that Brewer is irrelevant.

Because the Massiah approach isn’t

applicable here.
MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

Correct, the™

There's been no charge.

MR, ROBERTS:

No commencement of judicial proceedings,

which is -the key to the commencement of your Sixth Amendment

14
rights, under Massiah or under Brewer.
Now, there is some, X guess, scholarly debate about
whether or not you should extend back- to the point of custody
the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment.
QUESTION:

But you still, ©von if Brewer is

irrelevant.
MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

'

And Miranda isn’t—

MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Miranda is not.

And neither is-—hence, neither is the

question of interrogation irrelevant?
MR. ROBERTS:

Correct.

Interrogation is at the

very heart of Miranda, and it6s the very heart of Jnnia, now,
in the innis case. We are facing a situation where Innis
had overheard an observation made by poiicman A to policeman B.
It wasn't the Christian burial spaechin the sense of
a 160-mile drive with a Texas captain who prides himself on
-

being a skillful interrogator, preying on -the weakness, if
yon will, developing an inherent coercion on Williams who was
in that car.
QUESTIONS

Well, you5ve said that, in response to

questions from my colleagues, that the Brewer case was
written, as I understand it was, to—-on a Sixth Amendment
basis, and what we have hex® is s. Fifth Amendment question.
And yet is there an element of interrogation in

©aeh?

Or is interrogation only in the—only in this

particular ease?

Did Brewer not involve any question of

interrogation?
MR„ ROBERTS :

Oh, Brewer clearly, Mr» Justice

Rehnquist, involved interrogation.
QUESTION *

It did not involve an issue of

interrogation»
MR. ROBERTS:

It did not involve an issue of inter­

rogation.
QUESTION:

Everybody had agreed—

MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

--in the Brewer case that that was

interrogation.
QUESTION:

Wait a minute.

There were some of

QUESTION:

No, I’m talking about ©very Court.

us—

Every Court.
MR. ROBERTS:

The court majority, Mr. Justice

Blackmun.
QUESTION:

Every court.

/

MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

So—

Well, let’s have that clear, because I

think it bears on this case in a way.
Incidentally, you referred to the American
Criminal Law issue.

It’s of interest to me that in that

16
same Issue„ there's another article taking the opposite side
of the case.
MR. ROBERTS s
QUESTION?

Professor White—

Yes.

MR. ROBERTS s

--would extend Your Honor the—he

would make the case a Sixth Amendment case.

I believe theres a

nothing in the doctrines taught by this Courts nor is there
anything—-any matter of principle which would call for that
conclusion.
To extend Sixth Amendment rights back to the point
of custody would, 1 think, be clearly detrimental public
policy in the effect it would have on law enforcement to
function at the scene of an investigation.
QUESTIONS

Wall,, if—although not contested—-there

was an “-“interrogation was on© ©f the elements in the holding
of Brewer, and you say the question of whether or not there
was interrogation here is important in the Fifth Amendment
context? then is the question of interrogation in th® abstract
involved both in the Fifth Amendment Miranda-type situation
and in the Sixth Amendment Mssslab-type situation?
MR. ROBERTS s

Absolutely, Your Honor.

The whole

purpose of Miranda and. its warnings is to reduce the
pressure of custodial interrogation.

Now, if there was

interrogation here, then we'd have to move on to the question
of was there waiver, or should the per ae exclusionary rule

1?
be applied.
But as X believe Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out a
few moments ago, if there is no interrogation here, if the
statements by patrolman A to patrolman B, ”1 hope non© of the
children

at the school for the handicapped are injured," if

that doesn't constitute improper custodial interrogation,
then the respondent's whole position is lost.
The*—the—there must be some finding that that did
constitute interrogation.

And while there's much argument

about it, I would point out that the record in this case is
not only silent on the inquisitorial intent behind that
remark? in fact, the record goes the other way.

The record

suggests that this was just casual conversation, "I happened
to say to him," or something like that.
QUESTION %

He wan just philosophising? is that

your suggestion?
MR. ROBERTSt
suggesting that.

No, Your Honor, it's—I'm not

I'm suggesting that he was a patrol officer

who patrolled that area, and would have five different
concerns on his mind than would Detective Captain Deeming in
Brewer, or Detective Captain Leyden, for that matter, here.
I think if Detective Captain Leyden had. made a—
had gotten into this kind of a dialogue, it might well have
bean with a whole different intent, and with a whole
different constitutional meaning.

18
QUESTIONs

What is the difference if this officer

wanted to find the gun—
MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

This officer was—

Probably interested in where the gun

was, wasn't he?
MR. ROBERTS:

No, I don't believe so, Your Honor.

I believe this officer was interested in discharging
what he was ordered to do, and that is, take the man to the
station without asking him any questions.
QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about—

QUESTION:

Well, why8d he do that?

MR. ROBERTS:

He didn't ask him any questions, Mr.

Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

Well, then after—he got him turned

around though, didn't he?

At the request of fcha man, didn't

he?
MR. ROBERTS:

The man volunteered.

"Take me back? I'll show you the gun."

The man said,

He was than given

his rights for the fourth time outside the polls© car.
QUESTION:

But my point is, I don't know just how

innocent that conversation was.
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, ofcourse that is what respondent

is attempting to provoke the Court to believe.
QUESTION:

The—”

You know I have a great difficulty with

deciding how much major intelligence the two-year-on-the»force

I have a lot of

difficulty.
MR. ROBERTS;
QUESTION;

Well, the point—

I mean, I think a police officer who’s

had two years training with the FBI might be equal to a police
in a country place that had never seen a city.
MR. ROBERTS;
QUESTION;

Well, the—

I -just don't see the purpose of the—

seat.
They were qualified police officers.
MR. ROBERTS;

They’re police officers? no question,

Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION;

Qualified.

MR. ROBERTS;
QUESTION:

That’s right.

Well, why try to make them unqualified?

MR. ROBERTS;

I’m not trying to make them unqualified.

that we have a situation that prevails here, where these men
were instructed to do a specific thing.

They’re patrol

QUESTION:

Well, do you think it!s the same as then

discussing what happened in the World Series last night?
MR. ROBERTS;

I think you have to have some kind

of evidence that it has inquisitorial intent.

And that's

totally absent here.
In fact, these people—
QUESTION:

It wasn’t totally absent:

They were

looking for a gun.
MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

These men—

And they were discussing a cran.

MR. ROBERTS:

They were in fact--they were in fact

And they were discussing this gun.

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

MR. ROBERTS:

They were discussing his.gun.

Right,

MR. ROBERTS:

That's what they said.

MR, ROBERTS:

Yes, exactly»

That's true,

Mr, Justice-—
QUESTION:

When you say it was not on a—-when you

say it was not on a long ride, how long a trip was it that
these officers were instructed to make?
MR. ROBERTS:

The testimony—-well, the trip they

were instructed to make was considerably longer than what
eventually happened.
QUESTION:

They travelled a half-mile.
A half-mile?

MR. ROBERTS:
suggests.

A half-mile to a mile, the record

And they were gone, there's reference to a couple

of minutes, a few minutes.
QUESTION:

And then they turned around and went back?

MR. ROBERTS:

They turned around when the—when

Innis volunteered to go back.
to the scene.

They turned around, went back

The Captain then removed him from the—from the

back seat of the squad car? once again gave him the Miranda
warnings? and he replied, "No, I want to show you where the
gun is.

I know my rights, but I want to take you to where

the gun is,,"
Which gets into point number two:

If, in fact,

that did constitute an interrogation, here is the second
waiver of whatever rights may have accrued to him under
Miranda„
QUESTION:

Maybe he was counting on the fact that

22

you can ’t do ballistic tests on a sawed-off shotgun the way
you can on a .38 caliber pistol? is that possible?
MR. ROBERTSs

I don't know what the state of his

knowledge was, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But he certainly—

1 mean, you’ve referred to the Christian

burial speech of Brewer several times, and we have, too.

In

Brewer, wasn't it also a fact that beside—in addition to
referring to a Christian burial, there was reference to the
fact that if the child, who had been kidnapped, was still
alive, it might not survive in that—
MR. ROBERTSs
QUESTIONS

In that

—climate?

toather.

Now, wasn’t the duty of the

officer—all the officers in the Brewer ear—the same with
respect to trying to retrieve and recover that living child,
if it was living, as the officers in this Innis automobile
to recover that gun?
MR. ROBERTS:

I submit, Your Honor, under what I

would expect to be the ordinary standards of police work,
they probably—their duty should be to carry out the directions
of their superior officer.

In the Innis case—I have no

information at all about Brewer, obviously—in the Innis
case the commanding officer had other policemen at the scene
who were doing, continuing investigative work.

These three

men were directed to take Innis to the central station.
QUESTIONs

General Roberts, following up on the

23
Chief Justice's point,, the trial judge specifically said*
we have three officers who are out at four in the morning or
later, and have been prowling around searching for a weapon
which they had reason to believe was there.
These very men, 1 understood, were charged with the
responsibility for locating that weapon?
MR. ROBERTS;
QUESTION;

That’s what the trial judge said.

MR. ROBERTS;
QUESTION;

These three men had been at the scene.

Looking for the weapon.

MR. ROBERTS;
QUESTION:

No, these three men had been—

Looking for the weapon; they had been.

And is it not a fact that the trial

judge’s decision was based on waiver.

That’s the reason the

trial judge—-he says in so many words that it was a waiver,
clearly, on the basis of the evidence that I have heard, an
intelligent waiver of his right to remain silent.
And he did not make any finding one way or another
on the issue of interrogation, whereas the Supreme Court of
Rhode Island did.
MR. ROBERTS;
QUESTION;

That’s correct, Mr. Justice—

And you’re in effect asking us to make a

new finding of fact on the question of interrogation; is
that right?
MR. ROBERTS;
QUESTION;

No. Well, no—

Well, who should make the finding of fact?

24
MR. ROBERTS:

The issue of waiver was certainly

paramount in the trial judge's decision.
QUESTION:

It was the grounds of his decision.

MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

Clearly stated.

MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

He found a waiver to exist.

And he did not pass on a finding of

interrogation.
MR. ROBERTS:

Exactly; exactly.

I don't believe that

on the record before -this Court that it constitutes making a
new finding of fact to determine that--*
QUESTION:. Well, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island
did decide the question, didn't it?
MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

They—yes.

They decided—

Would you characterise it as a question

of fact or a question of law?
MR. ROBERTS:
as a question of law.

X believe they treated it essentially
Because I felt—I believe that they

were mandated--they believed that they were mandated by the
Brewer case to conclude that this was an interrogation.
I believe that they automatically applied, if you
will, the Christian burial speech, despite the numerous
factual distinctions t arid the fact it was a Sixth Amendment
case o
They applied that—

25
QUESTION?

Wall, but that doesn't affect the

interrogation issue, as I understood your answer to Justice
Rehnquist.
MR. ROBERTS;

Correct.

Correct.

No, I think the

interrogation issue and the waiver issue do, clearly, stand
as separate issues'?—

MR. ROBERTS;

view to—■
QUESTION;

But I'm still interested in your

answer, not your interpretation of the Suprema Court of
Rhode Island,

What is your position on whether the

interrogation issue is a question of fact or a question of
law?
MR. ROBERTS;
it is before this Court,

I believe it's a question of law, as
I believe interrogation certainly

could be a question of fact in the Superior Court.

When the

Supreme Court gets it and applies Brewer and says, Brewer—
QUESTION;

And the rule of law would be that unless

the remark is directed at the defendant, it's not interro­
gation.

Would -that be the rule you ask us to adopt?
MR. ROBERTS;

I would ask you to adopt the rule

that unless it's directed at the defendant, and unless it’s
interrogative in nature—it doesn't have to have a question
makr at the end'—•

26
QUESTION:

Well, obviously, Brewer establishes you

don't need a question mark.
MR. ROBE RTS;
QUESTION:

Co r re c t.

But you would say that i£—-that even if

it was intended to bring forth the response, if it was not
directed at the defendant it would not. be interrogation?
MR. ROBERTS:

If it was intended to bring forth a

response?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ROBERTS:

And it was not directed—well, then

I would think that you would have to find that in fact it
was directed at the defendant.
QUESTION:

What if the-»-what if the trier of fact

were persuaded that the reasonable probability of the
conversation were to bring out a response from the defendant?
Would it be interrogation, regardless of what the subjective
motivation of the defendant?
MR. ROBERTS:

Yea, because then I think you would

say that that was, in fast, directed at the defendant.

It

doesn't have to—-I don't have to say, "Mr, Jonas."
QUESTION:

So you don't have to direct it in terms

ir which I'm speaking to you?

It just has to be directed in

the sense of intended, or likely, to bring out a statement—■
MR. ROBERT'S:
QUESTION:

In fact—

—by the—because that happened here,

27
didn’t it?
MR. ROBERTS:

No, that didn’t happen here, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

It didn’t bring a—well»™

MR. ROBERTS:

It was not directed at him, and in

fact, all the testimony*-™
QUESTION:

The trial judge describas what the

defendant does as his response to the statement.
MR. ROBERTS:

But it was not directed at him in

real or implied fashion, and I think all the record evidence—QUESTIONs

Well, how do

MR. ROBERTS:

we know that?

Because there’s absolutely no

evidence in the record to support -that conclusion.
QUESTION:

Well, the Rhode Island Supreme Court

thought there was.
MR. ROBERTS:

The Rhode Island Supreme Court, if I

may say so respectfully, I think misread Brewer in such a way
that they felt the Christian burial speech holding in Brewer
mandated a finding that anything which is said, which elicits
a response, whether or not it's directed, intentionally or
unintentionally, at the defendant, that that’s going to be
sufficient to call for invocation of Miranda.
QUESTION:

We don’t have any finding here on what the

intent of -file officer was, do we?
MR. ROBERTS:

Thar© is a--the Superior Court

28
finding, Your Honor is correct, goes to the question of
waiver? it does not involve a finding of fact.
But I submit that all the record evidence on which
the Rhode Island Court based its decision is on the--is
assuming that as a matter of law Brewer mandates the conclusion
that this is an interrogatory.
QUESTION:

Well, of course, I suppose you could say

that there was—or you could argue, at least—-that even if
there was sufficient interrogation in Brewer to make out an.
invasion of the right to counsel, it might not have, in
Brewer, been an interrogation for the purposes of Miranda—
a Miranda violation.
MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

I'm troubled by that—

I mean, interrogation may not be

interrogation in every possible context.
MR. ROBERTS:
is very likely true.

That's very interesting, and certainly
I'm troubled by the fact that Detective

Captain Leeming admits in Brewer that in fact his purpose was
to interrogate.
QUESTION:

Now, I take it you're—

QUESTION:

That may be so, but—

QUESTION:

Well, he may have admitted that a—if it

had been a Miranda issue, he may have been--admitted a
violation there.

Which wouldn't necessarily mean that

Miranda was violated here, even if there would have been a

29
Sixth Amendment violation„
QUESTION:

That's right.

MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

That's quite true.

In the Seminole Massiah case, there was

a conversation in the front seat of a car between Massiah end
his friend who was wired for sound.

As I remember, that was

not interrogation, as one might ordinarily characterise
inte rrogation.
MR. ROBERTS s

Except for the fact that the Federal

Marshall was sitting a block away.
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, I know that,° Massiah * s friend

was an agent of the police.
MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

That's right.

And Massieh doctring has nothing to do

whatsoever with coercive circumstances.
MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

Unlike Miranda.

MR. ROBERTSs
QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart,

That's correct.

But as I remember the facts in Massiah,

it was not a Q and A sort of interrogation.
MR. ROBERTS:

It was just a statement—a statement

he made that was incriminating and overheard by the Marshall
because the friend was in cooperation-™.
QUESTION:

Suppose, sine© we're psychoanalysing

these officers, would your position be that what took place

30

In the car, whatever it was, was the sarae as though, over
the car radio from headquarters, came a massage from the Captain
or Inspector saying, aWn@n you deliver Innis, when you’re
through with him, get some men out into that area and try
to find that shotgun so that some of the children from the
handicapped—handicapped children from the local schciol
won't hurt themselves?8*
MR. ROBERTSs

I believe the intent and the

constitutional meaning of both statements would be the same,
yes.

Yes, that’s corsrect, Mr. Chief Justice.
With the Court's leave, I would like to reserve the

rest of my time—
QUESTIONS

General Roberts, there’s this difference,

I suppose, that the suggestion the Chief Justice makes, it
would have been new information to the police.

But you're

talking about here three police who had previously been
searching for tha gun and were familiar with the area.

Which

makes it a little different from the hypothesis.
MR. ROBERTS a

The question, I believe, Mr. Justice

Stevens, still goes back to the question of intent to
interrogate.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERj

Mr. MacFadyen.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. MacFADYEN, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MacFADYENs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

31
the Court;
This case raises questions regarding the legal
effect of a request for counsel made by a suspect in custody.
Given the fact of this request, it also raises
questions regarding the effect of what the respondent would
term an emotionally evocative conversation which followed
immediately upon the request,
Finally, it raises questions regarding the admis­
sibility of tangible evidence that was seised as a result of
admissions evoked from Innis in the police wagon.
Respondent contends that once he had unambiguously
asked for an attorney, the police violated the Miranda
mandate when they exerted further pressure on him to incrimi­
nate himself, even though this pressure did not take the
form of a direct statement or a question.
As this pressure resulted in an incriminating
statement, the violation could not be cured by an immediate
subsequent rendition of the Miranda warnings, and a repetition
of the inculpatory statement made previously.
Finally, the respondent would argue that where the
police from the very first were seeking an item of tangible
evidence, and they succeeded in locating it only by frustrating
his exercise of his right to counsel, the tangible evidence,
as well as the earlier admissions, should be suppressed from
evidence,

32

The Attorney General for the State of Rhoda Island
has outlined the facts in this case,

I would—-I would simply

like to illuminate several of those facts and perhaps mention
a few that were overlooked.
First of all, it would appear clear from the
record that Thomas Innis realized that the police officers
were looking for tha shotgun.

At the time ha received his

second set of warnings, police officers were already searching
the area for the gun.

And at that point, Innis was apparently

out of the patrol car that ha had originally been placed in,,
Secondly, there's some indication in the record
through testimony by Officer Gleekman that he was instructed
by his Captain not to interrogate or coerce Innis in any way
en route to the police station.
There's no indication in tha record that Innis,
in fact, could hear what might be termed these reassuring
instructions.

In fact, the evidence indicates that at that

time he was in fact inside the wagon with the closed—with the
doors closed, and that he could not hear those instructions.
Also, the State has raised the point that Officer
Gleekman was what I think the dissent in Innis termed a
street cop, and therefore, putting it somewhat bluntly, that
he wasn't smart enough to coma up with this kind of a ploy.
I frankly can't presume that a street officer

33

doesR51 have th® creativity, even in the brief time allotted
to him, to produce the kind of statements that he produced here,
and moreover to produce them with an intent to gain information
regarding an item of tangible evidence.
Finally, 1 think it is crucial to note in this
case, and perhaps most crucial, that the record here does not
purport to contain anything more than a synopsis of whatever
happened in that police car.

The police officers, when they

took -the stand in the mini-suppression hearing that was held
in this case, simply were not asked precisely what they said.
They simply summarized, in a sentence or two, the general
tenor of their conversation.
The most we have are a few details, and those
details, I would suggest, are purely emotionally evocative.
Officer Gleekman apparently talked in terms of, "Gee, it would
be too bad.

Perhaps some one—& little girl, perhaps--would

kill herself."

Not merely injure herself, but kill herself.

And a second officer provided what on® might cynically term
counterpoint to that saying, 13Gee, that really is too bad.
We really need to find the gun."
Ism not trying to suggest that the record in this
case evokes visions of thumb screws.

But what 1 am trying

to suggest is that it is very hard to tell what happened in
that '-oar,

but that the details that we do have—and one

is forced to draw inferences from very few details--is that
these comments were of_a peculiarly evocative nature, and—

34
QUESTION %

Wellt Mr. MacFadyen, would it be fair

to say that just as Miranda was propounded by the Court
because it was so difficult to actually analyze the factual
circumstances in which a prisoner claimed a confession was
beaten out of him involuntarily, the Court felt a prophylactic
rule was necessary, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, which
you now support, feels that now it!s so difficult to decide
whether Miranda learnings have been respected and Miranda
assertions of—claims of Miranda rights have been respected

by the police, that we need another tier of prophylactic rule
in order to make sure that Miranda isn't violated?
MR. MacFADYENs

I'm certain that the Supreme Court

of Rhode Island was concerned about its ability to essentially
read Officer Gleckman's mind through the printed page,
especially when that printed page is vary short.
I don't believe, however, Mr, Justice Rehnquist,
that they were adding an additional tier of prophylactic
protections.,

I think

instead they took a reading of ffche

record, informed by their own experience in Rhode Island,
based on a number ©£ confession cases where there have
been—where the Providence police have used psychological
ploys to extract information.

And they concluded, on the

basis of the limited record before them, that first of all,
this conversation was in their words ej subtly compelling."
They also usied the words, it constituted psychological pressure

35
I think secondly—
QUESTIONs

But is that wrong, under Miranda?

Under

Brewer it's clearly wrong if the man is in custody and has
been arraigned, but is that wrong under Miranda?
MR. MacPADYEN;
Miranda.

X believe it’s clearly wrong under

I would suggest that Miranda was founded on a two-part

predicate:

First, that the suspect be in custody? and

secondly, that the suspect be subjected to some further
pressure.
It’s clear even from the decisions of this Court
that a simple question by a police officer to a suspect in
custody will amount to interrogation.

If, for instance, did

the police officers in this case had said, "Thomas Xnnis,
please, we're worried about the little kids, and could you
possibly—of course, we won't hurt you—tell you where the
shotgun is?”

I think there'd be no doubt that this would fall

within a technical definition of interrogation of Miranda.
And X have major trouble seeing the difference—
QUESTION:

What holding are you relying on of this

Court for that proposition?
MR. MacFADYEN:

X think the Roseoe v. Texas involved a

one or two sentence interrogation, and this Court found that
to be interrogation.
QUESTION$

Well, from what you say, I take it that

if the arrested person, person in custody, was taken in, and

36

sat down, and the desk sergeant said, "The first thing X
want to know is, give me your name and address/5 and the
answer was, "Never mind my name and address, I want to
confessj 1 killed so-and-so."
an

That would be interrogation,

impermissible absent a waiver under Miranda and following

a Miranda warning, 1 take it.
MR. MacFADYENs

No, Your Honor, I would not say that

was interrogation on—
QUESTION;

Wall, I thought you had said something to

the effect that as soon as they asked the question, or words
to that effect, the interrogation began?
MR. MacFADYEN:

The reason for saying no, I think,

is really in two parts.
First of all, I think a distinction can be drawn
between routine administrative questioning, where in general—
QUESTION^

Procedural as distinguished from substantive

questioning?
MR. MacFADYENs

Those words always trouble me, but.

perhaps that’s fair.
But I think the point that should be drawn from
your hypothetical is, in the situations where, in general, it
is unlikely that the police ©r other law enforcement agencies
are seeking to gain incriminating information, it is highly
questionable as to whether Miranda applies.
1 mean, I think in effect the Court has said much
the same thing in the grand jury area, where they first

37

pronounce the rule -that the Court—-that society has a right
to everyone's evidence? and they operate# and they say that
the prosecution may operate on the presumption# when a witness
goes before a grand jury# that that witness first of all

will not be incriminating himself# and secondly# that the
prosecutor in fact is not trying to incriminate that witness»
tod that is tha major reason for holding that they
need not be given Miranda warnings# at least in certain
circumstances.
So where you're talking about simple administrative
processing# absent some showing that it in fact was some kind
of a ploy to gain incriminating information# I think a strong
argument could be mounted

that that would not constitute

interrogation within the meaning of Miranda, even though in
fact in that case questions were asked of the suspect,
I think that# in regard to—the Attorney General
has also mentioned here that the span of time is a very short
one# indicating that somehow this means that the pressures on
Innis were lass.

And ha has contrasted this case with

Brewer# where there was a ride of several hours duration.
QUESTION?

Well# the Messiah rule has nothing

whatsoever to do with pressure,
MR, MacFADYENs
QUESTION^

I would agree with that# Your Honor.

Just nothing.

Or custody# or coercive

circumstances# or anything such as—-similar to anything such

38

as that»
MR. MacFADYENs

I would use Brewer in this ease

simply as illustrative of another fact situation»

I'm not

trying to suggest that the legal rule in that case turns on the
presence or absence of coercion.
But the Attorney General here has suggested that
because—
QUESTIONS

But in Massiah was—what was the activity

of the police or others that interfered with consultation
with counsel?
MR, MacFADYENs

To the best of ray understanding of

the opinion, it was that he was in fact indicted, that—
QUESTION?

And that he was out on bail.

MR. MacPADYENs
QUESTIONS

That he was out on bail,

And talking to a supposed friend.

MR. MacPADYENs

And instead of going through an

attorney, just as a civil lawyer would always contact the
lawyer on the other side rather than going directly to the
client, they set him up.

And certainly that did not involve

coercion in any sense of the term.

And it was a conversation

between friends, on© of whom proved to be falsa.
QUESTIONS

Not a vary good friend.

MR. MacPADYENs

Or a good friend, depending on
*9

your point ©f view.
QUESTION;

There seems to ba general agreement among

39
members of the Court and your opponent and you that Brewer
and Miranda and-“-are not the same cases at all.

Brewer

specifically said that it was not a Miranda holding,

And

yet the Supreme-~we8 re concerned with the decision of the
Supreme Court of Rhode Island that made a great deal of the
similarities between this case and Brewer.
MR. M&cFADYENs
QUESTION?

Your Honor—

Which—and Brewer was not a Miranda case.

MR. MacFADYENs

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would

suggest that the Supreme Court of Rhode Island simply used
Brewer as an illustrative case.

It clearly noted that Brewer

was a Sixth Amendment case* and it was deciding Innis on
Fifth Amendment grounds.
I would suggest, however, that there are certain
aspects of Brewer that bear relevance to Innis,, without attempt
ing a one-to-one correspondence.
As Mr. Justice Powell noted in his concurrence in
Brewer, that the fast of interrogation, and the fact of some
degree of pressure in that interrogation was potentially
crucial to the question of whether there had been a voluntary
waiver in that case of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
It would seem to me that Brewer .is useful to the
decision of this case insofar as it
problem concerning
QUESTIONs

discusses a factual

psychological pressure.
But if factual similarities to Brewer

•«Ii

can be relied on you, why can't factual dissimilarities, such
as the totally different exposure of time, be relied on by
your opponent?
MR. MacFADYEN:

I think he can rely on those.

As I

was about to suggest, I think that the dissimilarities in
time between Innis and Brevyer are deceiving? that I would point
out that in many decisions discussing the activities of
police officers at the moment of arrest, this Court has
very carefully recognised the extreme degree of stress that
the police officers undergo? that street encounters are
inherently dangerous things.
I would simply ask this Court to extend that to the
suspect as well? that from the suspect's point of viev?, it is
a highly stressful situation, and without trying to push this
too far, 1' would suggest that the facts—that the events in
Innis proceeded one-fcwo-three, the whole sequence of events,
from his request for counsel to his second admission to
Captain Leyden was probably less than ten minutes.
I would say that things were happening so fast that
if anything they aggravated the pressures in the situation,
rather than minimised them,,
QUESTION?

Well, but, to follow up on what my brother

Rehaquist has asked you, you would agree, would you not, that
as far as the Court is concerned, the issue in Brewer v„
Williams is whether or not there had been a waiver?

41
ME. MacFADYEN:
QUESTION:

Yes , Your Honor.

There was conceded, at least in the

CourtE—now some members of this Court disagree—but in the
courts, every court that had considered Brewer v. Williams
had conceded that there was a constitutional violation.
the question is:

Had there been a waiver of that violation?

In this case, the
question iss

And

preliminary, primary, first

Was there a violation at all?

And those are

two quite different questions.
MR. MacFADYEN»
QUESTION:

Absolutely.

And you would agree with that, wouldn't

you?
MR. MacFADYEN:

I would agree that the primary, and

perhaps most crucial question here, is whether Inn is8 Miranda
rights were violated initially.
QUESTIONt

Correct.

MR. MacFADYEN:

That if they

were not, that if he

in fact, in that police car, spontaneously volunteered to lead
the police to 'the shotgun, it 1b the end of the case.
QUESTION:

Every court, in Brewer v. Williams, had

held that Brewer's Maasiah rights had been violated.
question is:

The

Had he waived them?

MR. MacFADYEN?
QUESTIONi

That's correct.

In that-»

Esseissa me, just to pursue that point,

that although all the courts resolved the interrogation issue

42

in the same way, that was an initial basic question that had
to be put to ©n© side before you reached the waiver issue.
You first had to decide there t*?as interrogation.

And there

was a powerful argument to the contrary that Mr. Justice
Blackmun had made.
QUESTION s

Right.

QUESTIONs

So although it's true that everybody,

all the courts decided it, the fact that the interrogation
issue in both eases is very similar makes the analysis in
Brewer quite relevant hers, it seems to me.

Because you don't

take the position, do you, that the interrogation--the
question whether there's interrogation differs under the
Sixth or the Fifth Amendments?
I mean, on the interrogation issue, it really doesn't
matter whether it's a Massiah case or a Miranda case?
MR. MacFADYENs

No, I would agree that interrogation

is interrogation, regardless of what the legal pigeonhole is.
QUESTIONs

Well, what if it were unknowing, such as

in the original Massiah ease?

Then would any of the rationale

of Miranda be applicable about coercive statements—-coercive
circumstances?
MR. MacFADYENs
QUESTIONS

X think that is a harder question.

If it ware totally unknown to the

interrogas that he was being interrogated.
MR. MacFADYENs

Mr. Justice Stewart, I think that's

43
a harder question, and 1 would answer it in this ways

That

while on the on© hand, Mirande—I believe that the thrust of
Miranda was to provide extraordinary protection, where a
suspect is both in custody and subjected to some kind of
pressure-QUESTION:

The further distress under which ha is

under—suffering.
But if he doesn’t even know he is being interrogated,
how is that stress relevant?
MR, MacFADYENs

But what 1 was going to add is, I

think there is a second prong to Miranda, which comes into
play where a suspect has invoked his rights.

Where youere

talking about the so-called second-stage protections of
Miranda, you’re talking about a requirement that the police
scrupulously honor the invocation of the right.
And I would have a very difficult time understanding
how police who surreptitiously seek to gain information from
a suspect, while that suspect is totally unaware that they
are in fact doing that, are in any sense of the English language,
scrupulously honoring his rights.
And that requirement io part of Miranda as further
explicated by Mosley,
QUESTION:

What would you say in response to my

hypothetical question to the Attorney General, that if the
same words that were spoken here in the front seat of the car

44
had come over the car radio from headquarters of the police,
no one in the car had uttered them, and then the—all of the
events following that would be the same, what would you say?
MR» MacFADYEN:

I would find it a very hard case.

I think—
QUESTIONs

Even though the words are precisely the.

same?
MR. MacFADYEN:
QUESTION;

That they are precisely the same?

Yes.

MR. MacFADYEN:

Ho, I don't think they’re precisely

the same.
QUESTION:

Ho, my hypothesis was that over the car

radio, exactly the same words which were uttered in the car
on this record cam© over as a direction to the police in the
car to find that gun to prevent injury to children.
what would you say?

Then

Would you call that interrogation or

suggestive psychological pressure?
MR. MacFADYEN:

If the dispatcher was aware that.

Innis was in ‘the car, I would say it’s precisely the same case.
QUESTION:

Well, let’s assume he was not.

MR., MacFADYEN:

Assuming he was not, I would see it

as a different case, and that it would be very difficult to
apply the Miranda rationale to it.

I think the reasons for

that is, that even talcing an objective test for interrogation,
which is the test that we argued for in this case, that

45
a dispatcher making that message could hardly be deemed to
have felt it was likely that his comments would induce an
incriminating response.
Now, if, for instance, the dispatcher had said—had
essentially uttered a threat over the radio, if -the dispatcher
had said something to the affect that either you guys find
that gun or else Innis is a dead man by the time he gets back
to the station, I would still have difficulty analysing that
under Miranda, but I would suggest that in all probability
any incrimination would ba involuntary within the meaning of
the Fifth Amendment.
As 1 think the general tenor of the arguments have
indicated here, the really crucial problem is the content
of this conversation.

We suggest that absent an actual

admission of intent by the police, the standard must be an
I

objective one? that it8s rarely easy—subjactive intent is
rarely an easy issue, and that the motivations of officers
are usually complex, they?re many faceted.

And in fact, an

officer testifying & year later might well not even know
precisely why ha uttered the comments he did,

I would merely, and requestfully, suggest the
trial court shouldn't b© required to guess whether a police
officer's motivation, or his testimony as to those motivations,
are accurate or merely convenient.
QUESTIONS

Do you agree that none of the police

officers purportedly, purported to direct their remarks to
Innis, any of their remarks at issue here?

MR. MacFADYEN:

„

“-entirely clear on that point.

In attempting to resolve this question, and resolve
the question of whether this interrogation was as a matter of
fact subtly compelling, and by inference, therefore, intended
to be compelling, I think that the Court should note that this
is a case where the factual findings of a State court of last
resort served to uphold the Federal right.
In those circumstances, I would respectfully suggest
that, if not biriding on this Court, they should be given
extreme deference.
The bottom line of what I'm saying is, this Court
should take this case as the Supreme Court decided it, and
not create a different ease on the facts? find then leading

the Court to a different conclusion
If it is assumed that Thomas Innis was in fact
subjected to psychological pressure, X think that ‘the
argument that a clear Miranda violation has occurred follows
directly? that this simply is not a situation where they
scrupulously honored his rights.

than warnings, followed by a request for counsel, followed
by psychological pressure, followed by an admission.

You use the term "psychological pressura.

I'm equating the two.

All right.

ease that there have been interrogation?

Placed in custody—

MR. MacFADYENs
QUESTION;

Yes, but by—

There was custody.

—and then add interrogation to custody.

MR. MacFADYENs

.And by interrogation, I mean

some further pressure.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. MacFADYENs

2 think that as the Miranda Court

noted, much of modem police interrogative procedures are
psychologically oriented.

And I simply cannot believe that

they are limited to questions.
QUESTION?

And you think that whether or not there

was interrogation is a question of law or a question of
fact?
MR. MacFADYEN;

I think the ultimate question of

whether there was interrogation is a question of law, but
oftentimes it will be determined by findings of fact.
QUESTION;

But we don't have any findings her®.

MR. MacFADYENs

I would suggest that the Su-'v"erae

Court of Rhode Island made several vary clear findings of
fact.
QUESTION;

Well, they rejected the contention that

no interrogation occurred because the defendant was not
addressed personally.

In other vjords, they rejected, apparent

ly, a contention that there be a per se rule that you must
rej.ect—but I don*t

find they mad© any findings of fact.

MR. MacFADYENs
QUESTION:

I would suggest-"*

Nor did the trial court.

He found

waiver.
MR. MacFADYEN;

I would suggest, Mr, Justice Stevens

that the Suprema Court ©£ Rhode Island based its conclusion
that this was interrogation within the meaning of Miranda
on essentially two findings ©£ fact, on© of them made very

49
clearly; and that is, that objectively speaking, the comments
in the car were compelling# that they concluded that it
was psychological pressure, and therefore it was interroga»
tion.
Implicit in that is an objective standard that the
police should be held to intend the natural and probable

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

That's your warning sign,

counsel.
MR, MacFADYENs

My warning light.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?
you have five minutes more.
MR. MacFADYENs
will

In case you have more,

Four minutes, to be precise,

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice,

I

attempt t© be very rapid hare.

!

If it is concluded that Thomas Innis was interrogated
within the meaning of Miranda, it is our contention that both
of his subsequent admissions must fall.
I think that, ©specially regarding the second
admission, where the police claimed that Innis later waived
his rights, wa would simply argue that a fresh set of warnings
only minutes after th@ violation occurred essentially cannot
undo tli© harm already don©.

so
In this instance, the record, makes abundantly clear
that Captain Leyden scrupulously honored the suspect's rights.
The problem is that Officer Gleckman did not.
And effectively,, that if a second rendition of
Miranda warnings served to insulate from judicial censure a
violation that took place minutes previously, there would
be literally no incentiva to obey the mandate of Miranda in
the first instance.
QUESTIONS

Well, what the Supreme Court of the

State thought was erroneously admitted into evidence here
was the shotgun itself, plus testimony as to the circumstances
of its discovery? is that correct?
MR. MacFADYENs

Well, and testimony regarding

two incriminating admissions made by Innis.
QUESTION?

Which ware what?

MR. MacFADYENs

They were, in effect, two agreements

to lead Innis to the shotgun.
QUESTION:

Well, that5s the circumstances

which it was discovered.

under

That's what I intended by that.

He didn’t make any admissions with respect to his guilt of the
underlying offense with which he was charged, did he?
MR. MacFADYENs
QUESTION:

No? the record indicates no.

So it’s the introduction of the shotgun,

and the fact that he had led the officers to discover it?
MR. MacFADYENs
physical conduct.

Yes, both his oral and actual

51
QUESTION:

Is there any issue of inevitable discovery

in this case?
MR. MacFADYEN*

The State raised inevitable

discovery on a petition for r®argument that was denied on
procedural grounds.

The Supreme Court of Rhode Island never

reached the issue on,the merits.
QUESTION?

Didn't discuss it?

MR. MacFADYEN:

And I would suggest that at least

on the present record, the issue is not capable of factual
resolution, let alone legal resolution.
While it is clear that the shotgun was reasonably
near by, it is unclear how, in effect, successfully it was
concealed.
QUESTION*

And how, in fact, was it concealed, and

where?
MR. MacFADYEN*

To the best of my knowledge, on a read­

ing of the record, that it was concealed in some field under
some rocks.
I don't know whether one would have to excavate
the entire area to find it.
QUESTION*

Evan if the gun would inevitably have

been discovered, that wouldn't answer the problem about the
oral testimony linking the defendant to tha gun?
MR. MacFADYEN*

No, and in that regard, I would like

to emphasise that it is really the oral testimony that we're

52
most concerned with.

The shotgun itself is probative only

insofar as it is linked t© Thomas Xnnis.
And while the State has made an issue of'--a brief
issue of harmless error. I think it overlooks this signal
point, that if the admissions were obtained in violation of
Miranda, then the gun, in many respects, is virtually
da minimus.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Attorney General, you have about three minutes
if you have anything further.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS J. ROBERTS II, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROBERTS %

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Just a few points.
Essentially, my brother’s argument rests in whole
on the fact that Miranda precludes interrogation under stress»
ful conditions, which he reads that of course, it seems to
me, to be any observation made after the time of custody.
In other words, after the man has been in custody
and once assarted his Miranda rights, it seems to me the
argument is coming that he cannot thereafter waive those
rights.
This is a point--there is no—in this record before
this Court this morning, evidence of any kind of compulsion

53
or coercion in any roall sens® of that term, unless fha mare
fact of custody itself is sufficient coercion; and 1 submit
that it's not.
On this question-»
QUESTIONs

Well, that5 s—Miranda held that it was,

didn't it?
MR. ROBERTS %

Mere custody; I don’t believe it did,

Mr. Justice—
QUESTIONS

Yes, and then any interrogation of a

person in custody.
MR, ROBERTSs

Oh, yes, yes.

mean to be understood to say that

I'm sorry, I didn't

that was not precluded

by Miranda.
What I'm saying is, that where there's custody,
and we have this whole idea of inherent compulsion which
precludes waiver, that that's a—that that was never precluded
by Miranda.
And when we do talk about the scrupulous observance
of constitutional rights in this particular case, we do have
to remember that the man was taken back to the scene, was
taken out of the ear in which he was sitting with the three
officers, was spoken to again by Captain Leyden, and told
Captain Leyden, "No, I want to taka you to the gun because
I don't want the children to be hurt.'9
ha took them to the gun

And then immediately

54

That's the second waiver away from whatever offense
may have occurred.

So it seems to me that that's overlooked,

and not given sufficient attention by respondento
Two transcript references, if I may, and it please
the Court.
There v?as reference made in my brother's argument
to the fact that there wasn't any testimony concerning what
was really said in the police car.

In fact, the ©pinion—

I should say the Appendix„ at pages 43 through 45 contains
what was said in tha police car.

Granted, it's not

much, but that's all there was.
Gnca the--that's on® of -the State's positions,
that if this little bit of observation, byplay, in the
front seat of the automobile constitutes impermissible
interrogation, it's taken Miranda way beyond its original
facts.
Tha second point, made by my brother is, the Rhode
Island Supreme Court really didn't rely on the Brewer case
in its decision.

At page SA of the opinion of the court, in

the petition for writ of certiorari, the basis of the Rhode
Island Supreme Court's distinction is set out.

And I submit

that any fair and reasonable reading of that basis of the
opinion is to rest that court's decision on this Court's
holding in Brawar v„ Williams,.
What we're dealing with here, may it please the

55

Court, Is a situation where the respondent, it seems to me,
respectfully, is attempting feo extend the prophylactic
safeguards of Miranda into a situation where it violates what
members of this Court have referred to over the year’s as
the strong public interest in convicting the guilty»
And it's respectfully submitted that the Court should
not permit that result? that the decision of the Rhode Island
Supreme Court should be reversed.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
