I don’t think that was the focus of it,

MR, EIRE Y s

Clearly the purpose of the eras s~exasd i: at ion

in this case was to try to giva the lie to his testimony that
he hnd no • involvement in the cocaine saiur jling and he had no
involvement is preparing Mcleroth*s shirt and so on on the last
trip .by calling him t© account for evidence that existed, the

QUESTION:

If is perfectly

2. rule would be perfectly

rational under both Agneilo and Walter that said that Goverrj&ent
cannot use the illegally seised evider.ee in its case in chief
and that defendant would move to dismiss or to close the oasr-s
in chief under Agnello if the cocaine had been introduced at
the Government's case in chief,

And still if the defendant

chooses to take the stand 02- if thm Government

Ho then took the stand end tsstifiad and the

What happened then was that his answer

be? : iWallg how do you explain the fact that you have in your

.But it

would'never be necessary to introduce the shirt separately from

to deny ::his guilt, to deny his involvement with the smuggling,
to deny, his involwr.-wont - with th& preparation of the shirt.

In this case the statement 85sought to

therefore it is clearly distinguishable on the facts fro:;Walter, Harris and Hass.

And falls, we believe, within

the four corners of Agnello and requires this Court to
overrule Agnello if it is going to gr at the Government the
relief that they seek.
Just to continue on briefly with the facts I
want to pursue this because it si

McLeroth in addition, as I have pointed out to
having been shown to be untruthful on the matters of his

income vas shown by his own banker who was called to put his
bank records in to have told him that in this instance he
was importing cocaine for the Government,

A Government

agent was quickly called to the stand and denied that that
was the fact.
The Respondent Havens testified in his own behalf»
was never shown to have any prior i.-.r/ol'. ament in criminal
activities, was shown to have traveled :broad on the same hind
of export-import business that he testified he was on in
Peru.

His partner in that business was called to corroborate

that.

He put character witnesses into evidence and that did

not elicit any response from the Government, to shew anythin j
negative about him.
And? in short, it was the T-shirt, this cut up
T-shirt that was the only piece of corroborative evidence
that corroborated —
QUESTION s
MR. LEE:

Why did he keep that cut up T-shirt?
We respectfully submit, Your Honor, time

the evidence does .not establi sh that he did. and let me pursue
that point.
The Government in it*

argument, Your Honor, clearly

inferred that Mcieroth’s testimony was that this shirt
manufacturing process took place in connection .with the

upon which these two were arrested.

That is not.true.

McLetoth1s testimony as that this shirt manufacturing process

•

took place earlier in September in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
QUESTIONs

Well, the jury convicted him, .didn' t

they?
•'MR. LESS s

I understand that, Your Honor, and my

point is that with this on® piece of corroborative evidence
which we contend was improperly submitted, this jury was out
nine hours and finally convicted the Respondent in a case
which, contrary to the Government93 Footnote 1, can most
charitably be described as & very skinny case.
QUESTIONS

But there at© skinny cases and fat

cases.
MR. LEE;
QUESTIONs

2 understand that.
All wo look at is jury verdicts when

we are talking about sufficiency of the evidence.
ME, Lils

I understand that.

But what I am trying

to point out is that this piece of evidence, tor which tuer©
is no logical connection, why would the Respondent have
tram -.ported a cut up T-shirt that was manufactured weeks
earlier from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Peru and then transport
it back to Miami International Airport?
And furthermore, he was not -QiJESTICMs

They were traveling together, weren't

they?
MR. LSEs

They were traveling on the 3am® piano.

They were not down there on the earns business, according to

34

the Respondent'*: testimony.
QUESTIONS

Do the records show who financed.

McLerofch* s four trips to South America?
MR* LEEs

The records show, I think, h© substantially

financed it himself, although I believe in one instance he
said that he ran out of money while they were there and that
Havens helped pay his hotel bill and/or some other expenses.
But the point is there is no logic to the
Governments position that he would have transported a
T-shirt remnant from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Peru and back
to Miami, international Airport where it would have been in
his luggage when he was .arrested on October 2.
The 'conflict which the Government elicited -on
cross-examination was when Havens was asked did you hu/e
this cut up remnant in your baggage when you were arrested
on October 2, ha said, !:Mot to my knowledge.n
Then i.;; went on to explain at . some length that he
did acknowledge that when his luggage was returned to hi-a
•■he next day •Agent Martinez in a very elaborate ..process
went through hitj luggage mirabili dictu'discovered the. ,
T-shirt and gave him a receipt for it..
Martinez testified when he put the shirt in that
in fact he wetfc through ..the luggage : u Cotobor '2, found the
T-shirt# disclosed it to Havens and. iclked to him.
Martinss never denied the conversation on October

3 and the question I would .-raise just as a practical matter
since there has been a lot of discussion of credibility?
why would an experienced, drug agent discover a T-shirt
which was patently related to, according to the Government's
position,* the courier that they had arrested four hours
earlier and not take it into their custody at that time?
■r

Why would they leave it in the luggage, after having first
discussed it with Havens? allegedly? on October 2„ to
rediscuss it with him on .October 3 and give him the receipt
for it at that time,
■QUESTION t
MR. LEF.8

Did you show that to the jury?
X did not personally«■ Your Honor*.'.' -But

And the jury said "No,"

1 think that is correct?because they

4

1 would like to touch on the matter of the two
sub arguments
First X have discussed the matter of the alleg ,,i
perjury.

The Government of course -has maintained throughout

;.its principal brief that the reason, that Agnsllo need. • to
be overruled is to protest r.'ha trial process from perjury
by the defendant on cross"a^sminrtion.

And they stoutly

insist throughout their principal brief that that is clearly
what mi have here

36
I think a fair reading of the evidence demonstrates
that it is not.perjury*

There is a conflict between whefche

Havens admitted" that he first became aware of the T-shirt
on October 2 or October 3,
QUESTIONS

Well, it doesn't make any difference

as to a. credibility attack whether there is outright perjury
or whether there is faulty recollection.

You can undermine

credibility of a witness fey showing much less than perjury,
can't you?
Ml* LEE?

But the question then becomes, Year

Honor, d© we overrule# in effect, as Mr. Justice Marshall
pointed out, hi® Fourth Amendment right because of & mere
conflict that you want to impeach him on vis-a-vis the
opportunity to demonstrate that he has committed perjury .
In other words the Government takes the position that it
needs this extraordinary remedy in order to curtail or
p3tm<! at perjury.

And that is what they talk about in

their principal brief.
And then when they filed their brief after we bad
taken them to task to some extent, they say, well, maybe it
was just a matter of credibility and we ought to be permitted
to do it anyway.
And it is our position ’that simply impeaching
someone or attacking their credibility in sone particula:,:'
msy be appropriate fern it doesn't justify doing away lite

their Fourth Amendment right.
Hotv, pursuing a point that Mr. Justice Marshall
raised and of course the Court; of Appeals of the Fifth
Circuit saw this very clearly when it said as we- quota 1.1
our brief* according to the view of the.trial judge and
the prosecutor the defendant could be asked on cross»
examination a question which,answered affirmatively, would
admit the incriminating tendencies of the illegal evider. ;e
and answered negatively, would allow the subsequent intro­
duction of the illegal evidence for the purposes of imps ..ich*

sent,
What the Government is really asking this Court fco
do by overruling Agnello is to do away with the Fourth
Amendment right of any defendant who elects to testify on
his own behalf# because if any prosecutor or deputy
prosecutor or United States Attorney isn't clever enough to
devise a line of cross-examination which would bring within
the scope of the direct some object or fact which is in fact
somehow connected with the avent, ha is going to get it in»

QUESTION:

1 —
Let me remind you what Mr. Justice

Frankfurter saidi
"It is on© thing to say that the Government
cannot meho an affirmative use of evidence unlawfully
obtained*

It is quits another to say that the

defendant can turn the illegal method by which the

evidence in the Government’s possession was obtained
to his own advantage and provide himself with a
shield against contradiction of his untruth.”

proposition.

MR» LEE:

In that case the defendant offered the

testimony in question on direct ©lamination.

He was in

fact, as Justice Frankfurter pointed out, on direct
examination trying to build a defense, affirmatively, arid
shield himself from this imp©raissiveiy seised evidence.

QUESTION:
MR, LEE*

Whet did ha say about that?

The only thing that ha said that they

were relying upon on direct examination is that — and Mr*
Frey read it:
"And yon heard Mr, McElroth testify earlier
as to something to the effect, that this material war
taped or draped around his body and so on.*'
S1U

Yes, 1 did,

**©♦

Did you ever engage in that kind of

activity with Mr, McElroth and hgousto or ziz,
McElroth and anyone else on the fourth visit to

Limaf F©ru?
1 did not,u
Ws contend under the Weaks eases that that is simply
a general denial of his involvement in the crime,

And I

would suggest to the Court that if you would got to the point
where you would rule that this direct testimony, which X
consider to foe attenuated, to us© a word that was used in
earlier argument, in it» relationship to the T-shirts, X
submit that you are going to have all sorts of oases in
which you are going to foe asked then to" examine the specific
phrasing and context of attenuated answer» like this to
try to tie them up to something specific like a T-shirt or
a. gun or ''the cocaine oapaulo and agnello, or whatever-*
But 1 do think' that there is a distinction bet' reen

Walter and this case# and a very important one# because in
Walter the defendant on his own initiative attempted to
build a defense and shield himself from the improperly seised
evidence.
