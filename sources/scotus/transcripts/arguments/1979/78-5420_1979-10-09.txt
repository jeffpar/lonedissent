MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument next

In 78-5^20 and 78-5^21, Theodore Payton v. Mew York, and ' ie
Riddick v. New York.
Mr. Hellerstein, 1 think you may proceed when you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP WILLIAM E. HELLERSTEIN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
These cases are before you on reargument»

They are

appeals from the New York Court of Appeals which by a vote of
four-to-three sustained the constitutionality of New York's
arrest statutes which allow, even in the absence of exigentcircumstances, a warrantless entry into the home for the
purposes of arrest.
Briefly I will state the facts which I think in both ,
cases are manifestations of t;he operations of the statute,
that in real terms demonstrate the importance of the warrant
requirement which I think this Court will require or should
require.
In the Payton case, you had a situation where on
January 12, 1970, there was a homicide in the course of a
robbery at an upper East Side gas station in New York City.
Two days later, the investigating police obtained information

5
as to who they could believe was the probable cause to have
committed the crime.

That information led them that date to

go to the premises, to have the premises pointed out to their;
and to do nothings to spend the rest of the afternoon, the
entire evening, until 7:30 the nest morning when then a sub­
stantially group of detectives went to the premises, an
apartment on the fifth floor in a building in the South Bro. •
-— in Manhattan, Ifm sorry, and after trying to force the
door open and unable to do so, called for assistance which
arrived a half hour later and with the use of crowbars the
door was forced open.
Once they police entered the premises and they caw
that Mr. Payton not even there, they proceeded to ransack
the apartment, seized a number of items and all of which was
suppressed by the trial consent on consent of the prosecution
except for a .30 caliber cartridge that was found in plain
view on top of the stereo set.
The lower courts and the majority of the Mew York
Court of Appeals, finding that the police were lawfully in
the premises since they did not need a warrant, could have
seized what they saw in plain view.
The Riddick case is another striking in some re­
spects example of the essentiality of a warrant requirement.
In Riddick, the crime was committed four years prior to the
arrest.

The police had a probable cause and could have

6
known and could have gotten Mr. Riddick a long time before
they went into his apartment.

They waited two months before

they decided to arrest him in Ms apartment without a warrant,
even though they knew his address.
They went in — his three-year-old son answered the
door, they entered, Mr. Riddick was sitting in his bed with
some underwear on but naked to the waist, and he was arrestee.
I think the entries in both of these cases are
cardinal examples of why, as I understand where this Court
has gone so far with respect to warrants, the warrant re­
quirement should and must be imposed with respect to entry
in non-exigent circumstances Into private premises.
QUESTION:

If the police had had a warrant, that

wouldn't have prevented them from arresting the latter
petitioner in his underwear, would it?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

No, Mr. Justice White.

didn’t arrest him in his underwear.
dressed to leave.

They

I mean they let him get

I just — the reason I emphasized his

underwear is that we are talking about the home and this is
the heart of privacy and in order to enter a' home and seize
citizens in that context I think, as I understand the warrantrequirement j it has always been to insure that a magistrate
has determined even before that type of entry is made.

The

probable cause determination should be made by someone other
than a police officer who has to make subjective judgments

that are not always correct.
QUESTION:
were a motel?

Gould you make the same argument if this

You would make the same argument if this '.are

a motel?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

0h9 yes, I would, depending on the
\

expectation

of privacy that the residents of that motel

.ay

have.
QUESTION:

So that the word "home” doesn’t have any

particular magic in it?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

I think that the Court has said

quite clearly that the Fourth Amendment protects people, rot
places, but people in the context of where their expectation
of privacy is the highest and we would draw no distinction
with respect to motels and homes.

So it should be actual

residence, and I think a motel room can be home to a person
who is there, that there would be no distinction.
QUESTION:

In each of these cases, the petitioner,

both Payton and Riddick, were arrested in their own residences,
were they not?

\

MR. HELLERSTEIN:
himself in.

No, Mr. Payton was —- he turned

He was not home.

QUESTION:

Oh, that's right.

But in any event, the

entry was into the residence of each of Payton and Riddick as
well.
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Yes, sir.

You are correct, Mr.

8
Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

And in each case the residence was what,

an apartment in New York City?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

In Payton’s it was a multiple

dwelling tenement, fifth floor, apartment 5~A.

I would say

it is a typical New York, Manhattan tenement.

In Riddick, it

vias a two-family private house in Queens.
QUESTION:

Half a house.

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

The majority below approaches the

case along the lines that an entry to arrest is less intru­
sive than an entry to search.

That was its first premise.

Its second premise was that an arrest in the home is less
embarrassing than an arrest in public and therefore this
Court’s concern in Watson was even less forceful..

For reasons

I will 3tate, 1 disagree with both.
Again, the Court of Appeals thought that the common
law was very one-sided in terms of trying to ascertain the
— the claim was one-sided — the
common law allowed entries.
\
\

\

I submit, I think in our brief extensively we come to quite
an opposite conclusion.

So we think these assumptions were

wrong, they are erroneous,
I think it is noteworthy that since the opinion of
the Court of Appeals In this ease, a number of the courts,
high appellate courts have refused to follow it5 I think be­
cause It is a bitter pill for a lot of courts to follow, a

9
warrantless entry of this kind.

And the Eighth Circuit has

just recently, in the Houle case, which is in our supplement ;-0
brief, refused to allow warrantless entires, and the high
courts of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania also refused to follow
the Payton case as decided by the majority.
There is some significance I think at least in the
sensitivity of a number of courts as to the federal issue.
Our basic line, basic view is that if one thing is
clear about this Court’s decision is that physical entries
of the home is the chief evil against which the Fourth Amend­
ment stands, and that is what this ease is about.
The arrest warrant provides protection at the very
least against that type of entry without a manner of deter­
mination that on the facts known to the officer there is
probable cause to believe that a defendant has committed a
;

crime.

l

.

i think for us the logical starting point for our
argument has to be the plurality opinion in the Coolidge
case, where the Court said that no warrant for an entry to
arrest wes per se unreasonable In line withthe Court * s de­
cisions, and absent well-defined exigent circumstances there

S'.

could be

no warrantless entry.

'

'' ’

Further than the Coolidge case, the Court said in
Warden v. Hayden, which has come to be known as a "hot
pursuit" type of case, stands by which negative implication

10
that an arrest warrant is required.

These two statements of

the plurality in ColXidg© have led most if not all, but a
substantial and predominant number of courts to read the
language in Coolldge to come to a conclusion quite opposite
that which did the majority below.

No, the Ninth Circuit would go a

little bit more* and I was glad to have it* but I would t

e

the position that I think was at least touched upon in this
Court’s opinion in the Dalia ease.
QUESTION:

Which one?

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Which case?

Dalia v. United States* a surrep­

titious entry case, where Mr. Justice Powell* writing for the
Court* specifically noted that an arrest warrant* first of
all* is a useful document.

Secondly* a magistrate cannot

always focus on every aspect of the privacy intrusion but
that the important thing is an arrest warrant in the officer’s
hand.
■>V

Now* as far as I see it in a ease such as this,
where there is no warrant at all Is required as a praelio ta
for entry* at the very least the Fourth Amendment should
require and does require an arrest warrant.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hellerstein* are there some courts

jj

that say that all you need is an arrest warrant or that —

I

say there is a court that says you need only probable cause
to "enter the house* you don’t need a warrant at all.
they say

But do

» don’t some of those courts say that at the time

you enter the house you must have probable cause not only to
arrest but to believe the man is in the house?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

I think, yes, I think there is a

•1

— I don*t recall if they specifically talk about the second
aspect * but I would say that it would be fair to guess that

13
even a court such as I think the Seventh Circuit which does
not require a tf&rrant, would say that even though you are
going with probable cause on a crime , also have to believe
that the fellow is on the premises.
QUESTION:

Is that what the New York courts held

here?

The Mew York ~~ that issue did not.

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

So they did have reason to believe there

was somebody in there.
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

In each of these cases, you concede that

there was probable cause?

NR. HELLERSTEIN:

Of the crime.

Yes, and therefore that an arrest warrant

could have properly issued?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Yes, I do.

I think the informa­

tion as to both —
QUESTION:

What about the probable cause to believe

that somebody is -— that the defendant is in the premises?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

I think that the officers, had

they gotten a warrant would have, if it was an arrest warrant,

would have had probable cause in both cases to execute that
warrant.
QUESTION:

So that the narrow issue here is wb. ther

you need some kind of a warrant»
MR, HELLERSTEIN:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Mr. Hellerstein, earlier in your argu­

ment you placed great stress on using Coolldge v« New
Hampshire, Justice Stewart's opinion as a starting point.

I

take it Justice Harlan's concurring opinion wasn't necessary
to make that a majority opinion?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:
QUESTION:

|i

by saying

Yes.

And as I read his opinion, he starts out

from the several opinions that have been filed in

this case, it is apparent that the law of search and seizure

4

-

is due for an overhauling and then he goes on and says I
—-

would begin this process of reevaluation by overruling Map v.
Ohio and Kerr v. California.

How, I take it if one were to

follow Justice Harlan's views, which were necessary to make a
j

majority, that you wouldn't have much of a case.
*

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

I guess it would depend upon the

composition of the Court at the time, first of all, Mr.
Justice Rehnquist.

I think that — and 1 don't presume to

speak for Mr. Justice Harlan — that considerations that he
spoke to in those cases were his views of federalism and the
Fourth Amendment, and I know that you for one do share

15
perhaps with respect to Map at least that view, but I think
often in Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion he was extremely sensi­
tive as he says in Jones, too, forcible entry into the hone
to make an arrest, he said a great constitutional question
is presented by that issue which is the issue we have here.
The approach which the Court of Appeals below t o.;:
in the majority opinion by Judge Jones really I think denegrated It or underestimated tremendously the nature of
warrantless entry.

For the court to be able to say that an

arrest entry is less intrusive than a search entry, this
doesn*t square factually with arrest entries or the facts of
this ease.
First of all, when police enter a dwelling, as
they did in these cases, they are affecting the privacy of
all of the people where there may be more than Just the de­
fendant.
■

But the manner of the entry is not designed to

•

5:

safeguard the privacy interest but to minimize it.

We have

in our brief cited manuals, standard operating manuals of
what police are supposed to do when they g© into a premises
to arrest a felon to protect themselves.
out and engage in protective sweeps.

They are to fan

That is pretty intru­

sive and can be very often much more intrusive than a search in
which you find the item or items that are specified in the
search warrant, to be very unobtrusive.

The entire premises

are open to scrutiny, items that people hold dear to them are

16
private9 have nothing to do with whatever they are being
sought for, can be seen by officers.

The search incident to

an arrest can be very intrusive.
On the other hand9 a search can be minimal.

There

was nothing minimal about the entry in these two cases.
QUESTION:

Well* in these two cases, even if the

state is corrects that wouldn't lead to a lot of intensive
indiscriminate searching.

The search incident to the arrest

vrould be limited by the contours delineated in the Chime 1 case

ject to plain view.

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

But I think it

uras sort of in a way a psychological point that the Chief

limiting, telling the officers or directing them that when
you have this fellow and you have probable cause to believe
he has committed a crime, you go and arrest him, that is all
you are supposed to be doing.

The plain view doctrine would be an ex­

ception to all of that.

MR. HELLERSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

If while they are standing inside the

door of the arrestee, and he says let ma get my clothes on,
they see a pistol or whatever, they can take that, of course

18
can’t they?
MR. KELLERSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I am not- saying —

It is unlawfully there.

MR. HELLERSTEIK:

Yes , unlawfully there.

Our posi­

tion is that in this case they were not lawfully there with­
out a warrant.

And as I stated earlier, as I see it, the

minimum requirement is for an arrest warrant, is what this
Court in the majority in the Dalia ease have given meaning
to an. arrest warrant, then that is the kind of warrant that
should be required and is required with respect to arrest
entires.
QUESTION:

How about arresting somebody In the

third person9s home?
MR. HELLER3TEIN:
of the Tfay scholarly

There I think, at least in terms

discussion has gone, in some circuits,

such as the Third Circuit, there is a greater concern that
in that situation particularly, perhaps only a search warrant
will do the job because there the magistrate is not even
focusing on the person whose premises it is.
this Court has to get into that in this case.

I don’t think
These two

cases involve arrest entries on premises —
QUESTION:

Well, would the magistrate ordinarily

focus on whos j: home other than his own the person might fee
in?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Not in an arrest warrant contexto

19
He would if he were required to get a search warrant.
QUESTION:

Would you he satisfied with an arr

:3

;

warrant even to support the search, the breaking in the iv ■
of John Smith because the officers suspected that the obi set
of the warrant might be there?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Some courts have 30 held —

QUESTION:

Or Mary Smith?

QUESTION:

Some courts have so held that again I

think the logic would be that it still requires» once you
have a valid arrest warrant, the judgment left to the officer
under an arrest warrant that the person is in the premises
sought must be based upon probable cause.

I don’t think that

is an optimum solution, I want to make myself clear, but
for the purposes of this case and the issues presented, X
don't think I have got to convince you that you need go
further.
I would point out that the Court has amended Rule
\

4l of the Federal Rul©3 of Criminal Procedure to provide for
search warrants, not arrest warrants, when persons are being
sought, without limiting it to third, person premises.

I can

only say that there is logic to that amendment and it would
be wrong for me to say anything other than that.

But further­

more, if the Court had a desire to harmonize Rule 4l# which
at least you at times said implemented Fourth Amendment con­
cerns, then the most sensible reconciliation of the difficult

20
issue would be to require a search warrant so that Rule 4l
would totally conform with what the Fourth Amendment requir
but I do not think that it is necessary in this case.
The prosecution -— Mr. Zirarofch talks a great deal
about the burden to police if you impose either type of re­
quirement .

I know that in the warrant contest you heard

that argument many times and you rejected it many times.

Yo,

rejected it many times because you placed the importance of
that warrant requirement in the constitutional scheme in a
very high level, and when you combine that with the home.,
the premises, parts of the home, I think the prosecution
should have an insurmountable burden in terms of policy ;.-.r,com­
ments .
If we start with the premise that we are talking
»

non-exigent circumstances, then I can see no weight at all to
Mr. Zimroth* s argument that a warrant requirement imposed
by this Court would be a burden (to any legitimate concern of
police officers..'-'

;

If it is not exigent, circumstances are not exigent,
then the police have time to do a number of things and I
think these two cases pointed out —- In Riddick they had an
awful lot of time to make a slight detour and get an arrest
warrant.
QUESTION:

In our Watson decision, certainly we

didn't decide that on the basis that it would be just a

21
terrible burden on the police to go get a warrant to arrest £
man in a public place.

We went on the tradition that it ha

always been done that way, and that is what the Constitution
must have meant.

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

I think in Watson you must have

felt yourself freer to do it based on the fairly one-sided,
almost exclusively so, history of the common law with respect
to arrest.

That is no so with respect to going into homes

to make arrests.

I think that at the very least, and I

think the Court ir. Miller v. United States a long time ago,
1957, pointed out that the law with respect to arrest entries
into the home was not letter clear.
QUESTION:

Miller was a statutory case.

MR. HELLERSTEXN:

Yea, that was section 3109*

But

In a footnote of Mr. Justice Brennan, in writing for the
Court, acknowledged — first of all, he pointed to Judge
Prattyman* s opinion in the Akaweno case where Judge Prettyman

I think makes a very substantial brief that the common law
was very one-sided our way.

And if I had to argue I would,

but I don't think that what was available to the Court in
Watson, the common law going the other way, can possibly be
available here, and It is not.
QUESTION:

Don't you think it is quite important that

under section 3109 Congress had given specific Instructions
to federal officers as to the precise, very precise manner in

22
which the warrant was to fee executed?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

That was with respect to knock

and announce and —
QUESTION:

It was more than that, announce their

purpose and their authority and their identity —
MR. HELLERSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Purpose and authority9 yes.

* but I think the opinion said a few

more words would have sufficed.

They announced part of what

the statute required but not all, if I recall correctly.
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

I think the Court was quite clear

in Miller that that was a very important intention by
Congress in 2109® but what was not before the Court —
QUESTION:

Congress expanded what the Constitution

required.
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Well, the Court did not hold in

Miller, as I understand it, Mr. Chief Justice, that it was
construing the Constitution in terms of knock and announce.
It -was —
QUESTION:

No, I say Congress expanded what the

Constitution required and the officers had not met that ex­
panded requirement.
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

It may well be.

It may well be,

but that has nothing to do with the issue in this case in
the sense of the question of
warrant.

being able to enter without a

It was not presented.

23
The prosecution in closing out its brief

„

I don't

think the arguments of a rush to get the warrant — we fr
not talking about exigent circumstances which can be vrry
substantial.

It talks about such things as the rubber si ..r;;-,

that if you hold that the warrant is required for a felony
arrest within the home in this case, the magistrate is going
to begin to rubber stamp these things.
I think that is entirely out of sync.

It is not

synchronised with what this Court feels about the role of
the magistrates and the importance of the independent judg­
ment of the magistrate.
Another argument that the prosecution makes is that
if you require a warrant — I call it the irrevocable arrest
of the innocent argument# which Mr. Zimroth puts forths that
once a warrant is issued it must be executed, that if an
officer gets a warrant that says you are directed to bring
to the court this fellow, he must do so, but that is not
true.

It is not true under the New York law, and it is not

true under any law that I know.

If an officer gets informa­

tion that undercuts the basis for that warrant, he isn't
obligated to go and arrest an innocent man.
There are two arguments that the prosecution makes
that —
QUESTION:
man

But he is still authorised to arrest the

whom he now thinks is

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

But he doesn’t have to do it.

can —
QUESTION:

It is an authorisation, not a command,

that is your point»
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Yes, sir.

The last two arguments that Mr. Zimroth makes is
that if you require & warrant you are going to reduce the
scope of suppression hearings because there will be less for
defense lawyers to do.

And tied to that is the reduction of

possible damage suits against officers because they now have
warrants.
I should have thought of those arguments.
sorry I didn’t in my brief.

I am

But those seem to be exactly

the kinds of arguments that should come as a logical conse­
quence of the warrant — it should be a desirable outcome.
Why should we have to have extensive suppression hearings
based on who did what, to whom, and if there is a warrant
that a magistrate has passed upon?

More importantly, why

should police have to be at their peril with respect to
making these judgments?
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t it just transfer all the focus

of the suppression hearing from the grounds to the warrant
to whether or not there were probable cause to enter the
home though?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

It has been my experience that

25
hearings which are directed to contraverting warrants* and my
experience has been greater In the search warrant area, are
much more limited* namely they really go to whether it Is
perjury in the underlying affidavits.

They do not rehatch

all of the factual determinations which were presented to
the magistrate unless there is a — I think this Court has

That being the case, I would say none of the policy arguments
are worth this Court declining to follow the logic of the
decisions and to hold that a warrant is required In nonexigent circumstances for an arrest in the home.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER L. ZIMROTH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. ZIMROTH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Mr. Hellerstein is asking this Court to in a very
drastic manner change the balance of accommodating interests
that have been with us from the earliest of recorded history

2.6

on this subject until relatively recently.
The accepted manner in which the lawfulness of an
entry into a home to make an arrest of a felon was quite clear
and that is that the officers brought the defendant into cus­
tody and then the judicial system mobilised in a very substan­
tial manner to test two things, first the factual predicate
for the arrest, and, second, the manner of execution of the
arrest.
This was a Judgment of people who were very sensi­
tive to the needs of privacy and in fact the very same people
created the protections that subsequently became the protec­
tions of the Fourth Amendment with respect to search warrant
In fact, the system that I have outlined, if 1 may borrow the
words of Mr. Justice Powell in the Gursten v. Pugh case,
where he said there are indications that the framers of .the
Bill of Rights regarded it — meaning this system that I have
just outlined — as the model of a reasonable seizure under
the Fourth Amendment.
Mr. Hellerstein I think is simply incorrect when
he says that there was a substantial dispute about this
prior to the adoption of the Fourth Amendment.

There were

many disputes about the manner in which the lawfulness of
arrests were to be tested, but those disputes were about the
standards to be applied In the litigation after the defendant
was brought into custody and not disputes about whether or not

27
there should be a magistrate interposed in the on-going s:

n,

of — on-going investigation.
The entire — the common law authorities an-

the

framers of the Fourth Amendment recognised that this was an
accommodation of competing interests, it was a substantial
protection against illegal arrest in the home and elsewhere.
There was an additional protection against illegal arrests in
the home by the requirement that the officers knock and
announce their authority, as the Chief Justice mentioned
earlier, which is now law in most states, in many states by
statute, and the purpose was to minimise the need for force,
to give the people inside the ability to submit peacefully
to the authorities of the officer, but again these standards
were tested in litigation after the defendant or the subject
was brought into custody.
The entire burden I think of Mr. Hellerstein*s
argument is that we have a search warrant requirement and
therefore we must have an arrest warrant requirement.

And

if I may summarize the many reasons I think that those two
powers arid warrants are vastly different before I get into
the argument.
In the first place, the community * s interests are
vastly different in the two kinds of powers.

The effect on

the law enforcement function are vastly different; and,
thirdly, the search power is much more extensive and more

28
intrusive than the arrest power and the need for a warrant re­
quirement is much greater,

These are the very reasons vrhy the

two powers have been treated differently for so much of or
history.
Mr. Hellersteln says that there will be no burden or
law enforcement if you interpose a magistrate before the
arrest.

This Court has examined that argument twice relative­

ly recently, once in gersten v. Pugh, where Mr. Justice Powell
called this an intolerable handicap for legitimate law en­
forcement.

That characterization was repeated in Watson both

by the majority and then by Mr. Justice Powell'in concurrence
again where he said that the interposition of a magistrate
will "severely hamper effective law enforcement#" and in fact
it would severely hamper effective law enforcement.

Any one

requirement will have to be seen from the perspective of the
police officers who are going to have to live with this re­
quirement.
Just as an example, where Mr, Hellersteln criticizes
the police in Payton for not getting a warrant after the
afternoon of January 14th, he says that they knew the name of
the defendant and that they kne%f — they looked at his build­
ing and he says they did nothing.

He says they did nothing

after that until the next morning.
Well, that Is simply untrue.

What they were doing

is further investigation, the kind of investigation that

29
should be fostered by this Court, and the police should not be
diverted from that kind of investigation in order to go get a
warrant which would be a very time-consuming process,

In

fact, what they were doing was trying to put together a photo
array so that they could know what the defendant looks like
and also what they were doing was to try to find out where :.;V
defendant was.

Knowing where the defendant's apartment is is

very different from knowing where the defendant is.
Here we have a defendant who two days earlier shot
and killed the manager of a gas station and on that same night
he goes to his friend and admits to the friend that he did it
and also tells the friend that he is going '’somewhere."

This

is the same defendant who must have known that two, perhaps
three people in the gas station knew the defendant.

It seemG

to'me knowing the defendant’s address in a circumstance like
that is, as I say, very different from knowing where he is at
any particular moment.
It also seems to me that that is exactly the kind of
situation in which the police should be encouraged to do fur­
ther investigation and should not be diverted from that in­
vestigation by the very time-consuming process in which a
warrant would be.
QUESTION:

How long does it take to get a 'warrant

in New York?
MR. ZIMROTH:

Mr. Justice Marshall, in this particular

30
case, since there was no warrant requirement, there is nothing
in the record; however. In a ease -QUESTION:

But since you and I both know Manhattan,

I wonder how long —
MR. ZIMRQTH:
amount of time.

I think it would be a very substantial

Can I go through for you the steps that the

police would have to do to get a warrant, so you could see hcv
substantial it would be?
The first thing the police would have to do from the
moment they decide, well, non is the time we have to get a
warrant, they would have to gather together all the facts.
Now, in this particular investigation there were many police
officers who were doing this investigation, not just one.
They would have to gather those facts and put them into some
presentable form to present to a prosecutor, not to a judge
but first to a prosecutor.

And the reason for that is that

under New York law, as is true in some other states, you can­
not get an arrest warrant until you initiate tie criminal
prosecution.

That is net a police decision, that is a prose­

cutorial decision.
So you have to take all of those facts and you have
to go down to the prosecutor’s office.

Now, I have personally

been involved in questioning police officers about their In­
vestigations.

It is not a process which any responsible

prosecutor would just slough off because it is the initiation

31
of a criminal prosecution that is at stake, and the more com­
plicated the investigation, the more complicated the question­
ing in —
QUESTION:

Did he do all of this before he broke in

the man’s door?
MR. ZIMROTH:
QUESTION:

Your Honor —

Did he do all of this before he got the

crowbars and tore the man’s door off?
MR. ZIMROTH:

No, sir, he did not.

There was no

warrant requirement.
QUESTION:

Well, shouldn’t he have?

MR. ZIMROTH:

No, sir, he should not have because

it —
QUESTION:

He shouldn’t have thought over very care­

fully as to whether he had the right man or not?
MR. ZXMROTH:

Of course he should have thought very

carefully whether he had the right man,
QUESTION:

I thought so.

But after that couldn’t he

have just dropped by the magistrate’s office?
MR. ZIMROTK:

Absolutely not.

He cannot drop by the

He has to first drop by the prosecutor’s

office and -—
QUESTION:

Well, did he drop by the prosecutor’s

office before he tore the man’s door down?
MR. ZIMROTH:

No, sir.

32
QUESTION:

So he can tear the man’s door clown with­

out going by the — not only without getting a warrant , but
he doesn’t even have to check with the prosecutor to tear a
man’s door dovm.
MR. ZIMROTH:
QUESTION:

Under the law --

Isn’t that your theory?

Isn’t that your-

theory of the law in New York?
MR. ZIMROTH:

Absolutely, it is, yes.

After he

goes to the prosecutor’s office in order to get a warrants
there is still much more that has to be — then at that time
you first get into the problem —
QUESTION:

May I just be sure I follow your argument.

Are you saying in substance that there are a good many cases
in which police officers think they have probaDie cause but
the prosecutor says there isn’t enough here to justify a
warrant?
MR. ZIMROTH:

No, sir, but there are cases in which

the prosecutor would say you have probable cauae but I am not
going to authorise the initiation of a criminal prosecution
because I don’t think we have enough to convict.
QUESTION:

Then In those cases would it be appro­

priate for the police officer to go out and arrest him?
MR. ZIMROTH:

Yes, it might.

It might, because,

for example, one reason might be that the typical situation
is if there has been a photo array, as there was in this case.

i

33
We know, as prosecutors, that photo arrays, although there v.
may not be

probable cause, are not the most reliable in t-

of convincing a jury.

The police may have to get the defendant.

into custody first so that they can have a lineup.

In order

to have a lineup and if the complainant picks the defendant
.

out of the lineup, then you obviously have a much stronger
case.
■

So all I am suggesting is that this warrant process
is not a one, two, three affair.

It is a very•• time-consuming

situation —«

QUESTION:

I don’t know that you finished really.

You say that it is a several step process, and I think you
have just given us the first step, you go to the prosecutor.
I assume you persuade the prosecutor that there is enough
evidence for him to initiate a criminal prosecution.

Then

what?
MR. ZIMRQTH:

Then you have all of the paper work

attendant to filing the case In court, and if you are lucky
the court will be open at that time.
QUESTION:

You can’t get —

This is a matter of New York law, a

matter of New York law, all of this has to precede the issu­
ance of an arrest warrant?
MR. ZIMRQTH:

So then the prosecutor files the

have that, but I do know that New York is not alone in this.

So he files the information — New York

does not require grand jury indictment, does it?
MR. ZIMROTH:
QUESTION:

For a felony, yes, it has to be —

For the purposes of a search warrant, it

can be just information.
MR. ZIMROTH:

It will be a prosecutor probably and

Then you go into court and if the judge — who
■

by the way is doing a lot of other things at that time — will
see you, he then has the option to question the police officer
or question the basis.

Prior to this criminal procedure law,

there was some suggestion in the law that he was required to
go beyond just what was before him on paper and question the
police officer, and then if he is satisfied that there is
probable cause he would issue the warrant.

I don’t think that it is fair

to suggest, however, that the requirement will somehow be a
quantum of additional protection to what the residents alCj • .

I mean it seems to me you have to be concerned

with the fact that you are talking about thousands and
thousands of cases and the possibility of trlvialising the
warrant process.
QUESTION:

Mr. Zinsroth, do either of the respondents

challenge the probable cause for arrest in these cases?
MR. ZIMROTH:

say, was there probable cause to believe that the defendant

MR. ZIMROTH:
QUESTION:

MR. ZIMROTH:
QUESTION:

No, sir,

— but does state law require probable

cause to believe that he is in his own home?
MR. ZIMROTH:

Absolutely.

It is in some ways one of

my points, more protection than a tfarrant requirement would
be.
QUESTION:

Except that a warrant requirement requires

the disinterested third person to evaluate probable cause,
that is the protection.
MR. ZIMROTH:

Probable cause to believe that the

defendant committed the crime, it is not probable cause to
believe that the defendant is in a particular location which
is required in the state law which i3s as I say, more protec­
tive than the warrant requirement would be, assuming that it
is an arrest warrant — which, by the way, Mr. Justice
Rehnqulst asked this question — every court that I am aware
of has held that there needs to be a warrant requirement,
says there has to be an arrest warrant requirement.

The

Prescott case, which is a Ninth Circuit case, that Mr.
Hellerstein refers to, was a ease of an entering of a third
party^s residence.

Although I do concede that there is dictum

in that case which suggests that the Ninth Circuit would re­
quire a full blown —QUESTION:

It is based on dictum when it says the

warrant, whatever it is, the warrant must deseriht the place
to be searched and the thing to be seised, which irr this case
is a person.

MR. ZIMROTH:

I agree.

I mean that particular entry

I think was in the girl friend's house of the defendant, it
wasn5t the defendant5a apartment or house in that case.
QUESTION:

Well, what do you conceive to be the real

practical difference, if you want, to talk practicalities, be­
tween the jurisprudence that your prudential approach ©n
persons and things?

You say historically you don’t need a

warrant to enter a house to make an arrest, but I take it —
I guess you were going to say because people are so mobile
and can escape.

But how about things?

They c&n leave the

person with the person.
MR. ZIMROTH:

It is not only that the people are

mobile and can escape* but in many situations when you talk
about arrest, it is fair to suppose that the defendant or
suspect knows of the police interest before the police — at
the very same time that the police are examining the evidence,
it is fair to suppose that the defendant knows of the policeinterest makes it a very volatile situation which is verydifferent from the search warrant situation.

QUESTION:

Isn't part of the montage or whatever

j-

you want to call it* the argument analogous to Mr. Justice
Stewart's comment In the earlier case that perhaps the most
logical thing to do in connection with the Fifth Amendment is
to ask the suspect did you do it or not, and if not tell us
♦
where you were and so forth? It is logical® but the Fifth

Amendment prohibits it, and there are lot of things in the
Constitution that are prohibited that perhaps if we ware to
reexamine them today we wouldn’t necessarily incorporate.
But by the same token —
MR. ZIMROTH:

What it means by its terras is it

talks about reasonableness.
QUESTION:

Yes. but by the same token It dervies

historical antecedence and if there are a long chain of
historical antecedents perhaps you would say that logically
one situation may not be too different from another, but it
has been long established that you need probable cause to get
a search warrant for a gun in a house and the contrary may be
true if —
MR. ZIMROTH:

Absolutely, I think they are both

true, but it is not only historical antedecence, I think there
l

is great logic to it, and the logic of the difference between
the way that the twjo situations are treated is, as I have
suggested that the arrest situation is much more volatile,
also the community’s interest in the two situations is very
1

different.
Obviously, it is very important for polies officers
to gather evidence to convict someone of a crime, but that
I

interest it seems jto me palls next to the interest of the
community in getting the defendant into custody so that the
civilising processes of law can be brought to bear on bis

46
particular case, so guilt or innocence can be decide' by a
court.

There is no — in my Judgment9 there is no law on-

"|

forcement or community interest that is greater than that,
and that is another reason why *— and, there is a third reason
why — and maybe I am up to the fourth or fifth reason why
■

there is a big difference, and that is that the power to
search is a much broader power.

Evidence of a crime can be­

anything, it can be anywhere, and it can be in anybody’s
custody, especially now.
The need for a requirements even independent of the
finding of probable cause, to limit the scope of the search,
to tell the police officer xthafc he can look for and where,
•

'

and also to tell the subjects of the search what can be
■*sv

looked for and where is crucially important, and that is
very different from the arrest power which is by its nature
;

very, very limited.

It is obvious to everybody concerned,

you don’t need a warrant to tell, police officers what the
object is.

It is on® particular person, and what to do with

that person is to bring him before a court, and those are
some of the reasons for the historical difference, Mr.
Justice Relinquish.
And unless there are any further questions ~~

QUESTION:

You haven't addressed yourself orally to

that point at all.
HR. ZIMROTH:

No, sir.

What I e&n say about that.

Your Honor, is that in 1970, when these officers made entry
into this apartment, there was almost nothing that they could
have seen around them that would have led them to believe
that they should not follow the statute that they ware fol­
lowing.

That statute had bean on the books for a hundred

years, it was not a dead letter, it was part of the living luv
of the state of Mew York,

It was not a Jarring exception.

Thirty out of thirty-six states that had legislated on thi<
subject had precisely the same authorisation.

There wasn't

a hint in anything in this Court that any sort of that con­
duct was illegal in any way,
QUESTION:

Well, there were hints from this Court,

weren1t there, in 1970?
MR. ZIMROTH:

Certainly one, and that is Coolidge.

How about Jones.

So ~

Weil, what is Mew York law said — what

if a statute of New York said in this state no warrants of
any kind shall be required for any searches and seizures of
any kind, the law had been clear for a hundred years?

MR. ZIMROTH:

There is no law enforcement official

in this country who would not tell a police officer-, I don’t
care what that statute says* you had better watch out. there
is trouble ahead if you obey that statute.

If these police

officers had come to a group of law enforcement officials
and professors of law and judge© at that time and said, what
should we do, shall we follow this statute, I think what
those people would have said is absolutely, it is the law

Well, you are employees* you are officers

of the state of New York and that la the legislature of the

state of New York.

That is very natural advice to give.

it would also I guess with my hypothetical statute.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP WILLIAM E. HELLERSTEIN, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

I have nothing further., sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE PURSER:
QUESTION:

Very well.

Mr. Hellerstein, I have a question, Mr.

Chief Justice, if I may.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
QUESTION:

By all means.

Do you agree with him about how long it

takes to get a warrant?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Not at all.

I didn't think you did.

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

First of all, just to answer that,

Mr. Zimroth Is talking within the eontext of our existing
statutory framework that says the court will only give you
warrants when you commence prosecution, you have to see the
prosecutor.

But that isn’t what this case is about.

We are

police officers, can get warrants without having to see the
prosecutor as they do In those jurisdictions.
QUESTION:

Thank you,

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:28 o’clock p.a,, the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
