MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-1654, Branti v. Finkel and others.
Mr. Parris, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARC L. PARRIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PARRIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I believe there are two central questions before
this Court:

First, whether sponsorship alone infringes

upon the constitutional rights of these respondents; and,
secondly, whether it is in the best interests of this country
to virtually end the patronage system.
In this case we are not dealing with full-time
teachers, janitors of deputy cheriffs whose only income is
their government jobs which they have more than some ex­
pectancy of continuation.

But rather before this Court

come the respondents, attorneys with private„practices who —
QUESTION:

Your second question, counsel, whether

it is in the best interests of this country to end the
patronage system is not really a constitutional question
over which this Court would, have jurisdiction, is it?

It

is up to New York or Nassau County, unless there is a
constitutional provision to the contrary, to make that de­
cision for itself.

MR. PARRIS:

True, Your Honor.

I was just talking

on the point of the effect it would have on my county
especially as I see it.
QUESTION:

Your county could set up a civil

service system for public defenders and prosecutors if it
wanted to, could it not?
MRo PARRIS:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

In fact,

it —
QUESTION:

The 3tate legislature could do the

same thing, could it not?
MR. PARRIS:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

ever, if you want me to espouse on that, there Is politics

from the top three and he could find his friend even sixth
or seventh if you wait until the exam comes out or when the
exam is published, some of the top people have already
received positions, and you can work that up

In fact, out of 2,000 employees, there

approximately that are in this exempt patron­

age situation, of which 3^ are attorneys.
QUESTION:

But neither the state legislature nor

your legislative body in Rockland County has undertaken to-—
MR. PARRIS:

No, they have not opted to do that.

QUESTION:

— do it xvifch prosecutors or public

defenders.
MR. PARRIS:

Nor assistant county attorneys or

assistant district attorneys.

They have found it works

better and is more responsive —
QUESTION:

Well, whether it works better or not

is of no concern to the courts.
MR. PARRIS:

I understand that.

We xtfould argue that there is no compelling —
we don’t; have to show a compelling state interest because
in fact we see no denial of any constitutional right in
this case.
Unlike Elrod, there was no coercion here.

No

one asked the respondents to leave the Republican Party
and to contribute to the Democratic Party, to swear
allegiance to the Democratic Party.

In fact, they were

simply ignored, not rehired, and I cannot see where that
is a denial of their right to freedom of association.
They do also make a claim of some sort of an
expectancy, however I do not see any objective expectancy
equalling any property right or any denial of due process
under the Fourteenth Amendment.
In this case, the respondents serve at the
pleasure of the appointing authority.

they also terminated.

He was being replaced.

By lav/,

On January 1, when my client, Mr.

Branti —
QUESTION:

What provision of the New York law

do you rely on for that latter statement, that the
assistant’s terms ended when the public defender’s term
ended?
MR. PARRIS:

In the civil service interpretation

of the lav/ by our personnel director, and I would refer
the Court to pages 138 and 139 of the appendix where this
discussion takes place, in which he states quite clearly
that they serve at the pleasure of the appointing authority,
and when the appointing authority is no longer there, their
term ends when his term ends.
QUESTION:

That to me is a very, very important

issue, as you might —
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, I believe it is very germane.
— get from reading my concurring

opinion in Elrod, and the District Court talks about —
in talking about 6(a) of the appendix to your petition for
writ of certiorari — talks about — he says on that date.

7
that is soon after his appointment as public defender, he
began the process of executing termination notices for six
of the nine assistants who had served under Barone, which
would seem to indicate that they were being discharged.
That is what termination notices mean.

But then later the

District Court says — and I just, for example, look at
page 25a of the appendix to the certiorari petition, sub­
section (c) of the opinion — plaintiffs were not reappointed
solely because of their political beliefs.

So to me this is

a very important issue.
MR. PARRIS:
those points.

I would like to elaborate on both of

The first one Is —

QUESTION:

Maybe over the lunch break you can be

thinking about that.
MR. PARRIS:

No, but I didn’t want you to neces­

sarily answer it now.
MR. PARRIS:

Okay.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there

at 1:00 o’clock,
(Whereupon, at 12:00 noon the court was in recess,
to reconvene at 1:00 o’clock p.m.)

8
AFTERNOON SESSION ~~ 1:00 P0M.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Parris, you may

continue.
MR. PARRIS:

Thank you.

In answer to Mr. Justice Stewart’s questions, as
to the termination notice referred to in 6(a), that is
actually purely a ministerial or pro forma act In order to
indicate to the various county departments, such as the
treasurer and personnel that the termination has taken
place, otherwise you would have people continued as to
pensions and payroll.

It is really a bookkeeping type of

thing.
QUESTION:

Mr, Parris, were these people part-

time?
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION;
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.
Just part-time.
Part-time.
Did they practice on the side?
Yes, sir.
But you tell us as a matter of fact

and of law that these people’s employment automatically
expired subject only to this ministerial certification of
that fact —
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
— as

the public defender himself

9
left office,
MR. PARRIS:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

I think

the best example can be myself because I am the county
attorney of Rockland County.

I have similar employees,

the exempt class attorneys, the asslstanc ounty attorneys.
I hope to be reappointed next month.

I will be then re­

taining these employees who will then have to go and swear
an oath.

If they had some sort of a continuation, why

would they have to swear their oath again next month after
I retain them?

It is because they serve at my pleasure.

QUESTION:

You say you reappoint them, not retain

them.
MR. PARRIS:

That’s right, I reappoint them.

Then they have to go and swear an oath.
they have to do that?
QUESTION:

Now, why would

They serve at my pleasure.
When they were originally appointed,

did they receive a document or a certificate, something
like the one that the President gives to the members of his
Cabinet which ends with the words "at the pleasure of the
President"?
MR, PARRIS:
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:
MR, PARRIS:

I don’t believe so, sir.
They don’t get any piece of paper?
No.
The law says it though?
Excuse me?

10

QUESTION:

The law says it though?

MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, the law does, right.

Yes.

Is that a statute or an ordinance or

what ?
MR. PARRIS:

No, Your Honor.

Of course, there

is no statute.
QUESTION:

Well, is there an ordinance that says

"at the pleasure"?
MR. PARRIS:

It goes through the civil service

department of the State of New York, interpreted by our
personnel director.
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:

So what does it say?
Well, as he stated in —
Where do we find that in the record?
Page 133.
That is what I have here.
Toward the bottom.

The question:

Is there such a thing as a permanent appointment of an ex~
empt man so that he can remain in office and succeed his
appointing authority?

Answer:

No, sir.

Question:

When

an individual is appointed to an exempt position, is he
required to take an oath of office?

Answer:

All employees

are required to take an oath of office, including those
appointed to the exempt class positions.
QUESTION:

What did the District Court have to

11
say on this subjects do you remember?
MR. PARRIS:
tion as to Ju

Well, also

he had asked the ques­

Roderick on 25a and above he does state

the third and final requirement of the Elrod concurrence
that the attempt to remove plaintiffs from their jobs have
been based upon the sole ground of their political beliefs.
But down about six lines from the bottom of that same page
he writes the incident was not a ground for defendant’s
decision not to renew plaintiff Finkel*
QUESTION:

And his caption for that section of

the opinion is plaintiffs were not reappointed, but beyond
that is there any findings of the District Court which you
remember on this subject?
MR, PARRIS:
QUESTION:
about this.

No, Your Honor.
Mr. Parris, could I ask a question

You said they would have to take — your

people have to take an oath in the new term.

Well, this

testimony doesn’t say that and no statute says it, if you
recall.

Why do you say they have to take a new oath?
MRo PARRIS:

It is by civil service law.

They

are now serving a new —
QUESTION:

What in civil service law says that?

What if they just stayed on and nothing was done?

As I

understand the way this is written, he began the process
of executing termination notices for six of the nine

12
assistants who had served under Barone.

I thought you in­

dicated that if he had done nothing they would have just
continued on the payroll, wouldn't they?
MR. PARRIS:

They may have but they wouldn't have

continued —
QUESTION:

There is nothing in the law that says

they would not have stayed on the payroll, is there, if he
had done nothing?
MR. PARRIS:

They could have by error because

the ministerial act didn’t take place.
QUESTION:

Well, how do we know it is error?

Your witness doesn’t say that and the law doesn’t say that
and the regulations don't say it.
MR* PARRIS:

Well, basically I know that because

of the ’act that I am the county attorney and I am involved
in —
QUESTION:

It is a requirement that you imposed,

right?
MR. PARRIS:

Well, it is an involvement that I

know because I handle these matters.
QUESTION:

But if you didn't impose that require­

ment at all and nothing at all was done -—
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:

Right.
— is it not true they would continue

just to get their pay checks in the ordinary routine and

13
continue their work?
MR. PARRIS:

No, Your Honor, because they serve

at the pleasure of an appointing authority.

That is stated

in Mr. Anderson’s uncontroverted testimony.

If the person

is gone and you are serving that person and his term ends,
they also self-destruct.
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t it necessarily a predicate

for the District Court’s judgment that you couldn’t fire
them, that they couldn’t be fired for their political be­
liefs, that their term lasted beyond the expiration of the
term —
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, that —
— of the public defender?
— that was in error.
Don’t you think the District Court

read New York law as saying their term does not end with
the term of the public defender?
MR. PARRIS:

I believe that was an error on the

part of Judge Broderick.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but we don’t usually

second-guess District judges about state law.
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:
appendix.

I understand that, Your Honor.
Counsel, what about page 32a of the

I am wondering how semantical and how substan­

tive this discussion we have been having is.

We have

Footnote 10, where Judge Broderick says the fact that
plaintiffs are removable at the will of the public defender
is, of course, irrelevant to the determination of the con­
stitutional issue presented herein.

Do you see a substan­

tive distinction between a person being removable at will
and a person ’whose term expires at a given point?
MR. PARRIS:

Yes, I do, Your Honor, and I would

like the Court to take notice of Judge Hall’s concurrence
in Ramey v. Barber, because he made a point that it is not
a termination.

There is a difference if you are going to

talk about someone you are not rehiring.

For instance,

really it comes down to I think that sponsorship to nine
vacant positions, absence the coercion in Elrod, leads me
to believe that you couldn’t violate anyone’s constitu­
tional right.

Where is this right of liberty, does it

extend to someone who has another job and who is just not
rehired?

And I believe that —
QUESTION:

I suppose you could argue that it is

fair to read in Judge Broderick’s opinion as saying it
doesn’t make any difference whether it is a — whether the
term expired or not.

The failure to reappoint is subject

to the same constitutional rule as if the term was held to
extend until fired.

That poses a completely different

question if he held that.
MR. PARRIS:

Yes, but

15
QUESTION:

And I am sure you would say it did.

MR. PARRIS:

Yes.

I would also like to return,

if I may, to the question of expectancy.

We have a case

here where one of the respondents, Mr. Pinkel, changes
registration to a Democrat several months prior to January
1978.

That doesn't sound like someone who has an expectancy,

an objective expectancy of returning.
QUESTION:

MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:

But it didn't work?
Excuse me?
It didn't work?
It didn't work, yes, Your Honor,

obviously.
QUESTION:

You haven't mentioned anything yet —•

and I hope you will at some point at your convenience — of
the policy relationship that exists between the management
of the office and all of the staff.

MR. PARRIS:

Yes, I plan to, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

All right, do it at your own time.

QUESTION:

As part-time employees.

MR. PARRIS:

That's correct.

Also historically

the respondents had some people in this office that had
been rehired, others that hand't been.

They both tried

and used political friends to try to receive recommendations.
That doesn't sound like someone with an abjective expectancy
like in Perry v. Sindermann.

16
QUESTION:

Well, could I ask you, suppose the

terms did expire and the public defender, the new public
defender put out a notice on the wall and said only Democrats
need apply or only Republicans need apply, I am just not
interested in hiring anybody but Democrats, does Elrod
cover a situation like that or not?
MR. PARRIS:

It may in that case, but that is not

what happened here.
QUESTION:

Well, of course, it wasn't Elrod, was

it?
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:

No, it wasn't Elrod at all.
Are you referring to the plurality be­

tween Elrod or to the -— there were several separate
opinions in Elrod.
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:

As to which issue?
In response to my brother White.
I don't think I made -~
Let’s assume that these employees,

everybody agreed that these employees vrere policy-making
and confidential, let’s just assume that they were not.
Assume they were not policy-making or confidential and
you put on the sign on the wall "Only Democrats need
apply," we are in a process of rehirlng and your terms
have expired but none of you who is a Republican need
apply.

Does Elrod cover that or not?

17
MR* PARRIS:

I think if the Court wanted to ex­

tend it to that —
QUESTION:
MR, PARRIS:
QUESTION:

So you say it doesn’t?
No.

It doesn't, but it might.

The Elrod judgment was supported by

five members of this Court.

Three joined in one opinion

which is called correctly the plurality opinion, and two
joined in the judgment based upon another considerably
shorter opinion and that second opinion joined the judgment
only on the basis of the proposition that an employee can­
not be discharp;ed or threatened with discharge from a job
that he

is satisfactorily performing upon the sole ground

of his political beliefs.

And if there is no discharge

here, then, as you say, you would have to extend Elrod and
Elrod would have to be extended to cover it.
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:

I agree, Mr. Justice.
Correct?
I

MR. PARRIS:
here.

And there is one important point

We talk about solely for political reasons.

I

would like to point out that there were two Democrats in
that office i?ho wer“e not rehired.

One of the people that

was rehired is a registered blank —
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:

A registered blank?
In fact, the record also shows that

my client had spoken to a Republican legislator about —■ he

18
was very Interested in a law secretary, a Republican law
secretary, and Legislator Dusanenko, a Republican, stated
I am not interested in him, he has a job, I want to find
a job for Tabakman.

So there was I think no denial of

political beliefs in the sense of their being Republicans.
What you had was, as I see it, nine vacant positions, 280some-odd attorneys in Rockland County, all with a possi­
bility if they could qualify as criminal attorneys.
QUESTION:

Could the public defender on his own

decide that he does not want to have part-time assistants
any more and just abolish the positions?
MR. PARRIS:

No, Your Honor, it would have to be

done by the legislature of Rockland County.
QUESTION:

The legislature itself f.\xes part-

time and full-time?
MR. PARRIS:

Yes, sir, they could change it to

full-time and again they do control that.
power of the purse.
nine assistants.

That is the

They could have three assistants or

It i3 the local legislature.

Now, as we stated before, we don’t believe we
have to show a compelling state interest because we don't
believe that any constitutional right was lost.

In fact,

however, we believe we have shown a compelling state interest
in that attorneys are special.

I think this Court recognized

that attorneys were special in Bates v. State Bar of

19
Arizona.

They are special in our civic, cultural, and

political life.
I would like the Court to envision a political
ladder right here.

At the bottom rung are assistant county

attorneys, assistant public defenders, assistant attorney
generals; up at the top the U„S. Congressmen, U.S. Senators,
governors and, of course, judges.

And I think this Court

will recognize that attorneys do have a higher proportionate
share than other occupations or professions as to these
high and lofty positions.
What I am saying is if you affirm the lower court
decisions, you will effectively set up an entry barrier for
young, intelligent, ambitious male and female, black and
white attorneys from starting on that ladder and moving up
to those lofty positions.
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:

Did you make that argument below?
No, Your Honor, because below we

believed that there was no constitutional right that was
lost and we didn’t have to show a compelling state interest.
Rut I think it is an important interest.

I think that

myself — and this is really why I am here, because I do
believe in the patronage system, our patronage system in
Rockland County, a moderate one, and I am an example of it.
So is my co-counsel, Mr. Apotheker.
In 1974, the Democrats took over the legislature

20

in Rockland County, the majority, and I was appointed as­
sistant county attorney and from there I moved to first
deputy county attorney.
attorney.

Two years ago I became county

Leaders have spoken to me recently about running

me for state office and possibly a county court judgeship.
Mr. Apotheker was just recently elected to a town justice
seat in Haverstraw«
And that is what I am talking about in the ladder.
I don’t want to leave the ladder to the rich who don't need
the political machinery, they don’t need to party strength
to move up that ladder.

They can skip all the rungs, they

can go straight with their money and run for U.S. Senator
or Congress.
QUESTION:

Since you are arguing that kind of an

issue, is it not also, assuming this is relevant, would it
not be equally relevant if this is related to the existence
of the two-party system?
MR. PARRIS:

Absolutely.

I believe in the two-

party system and I believe that both parties in Rockland
County, Democrats and Republicans, should still be able to
attract these intelligent, young and, yes, ambitious
attorneys to move up this ladder.
QUESTION:

The question still remains whether

that is relevant to the issues in this case, however.
MR. PARRIS:

Maybe, Your Honor, but it is something

21
1 wanted to say to this Court because I deeply believe it.
QUESTION:

What happens to the poor independent

lawyer who doesn’t belong to either party?
MR. PARRIS:

Well, as I say, through that party

system —
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:

What?
Attorneys generally, as they come

out of law school, to a great extent most of them do get
involved in politics.

That is why they are different than

deputy sheriffs and janitors and we recognize that if
Bates —
QUESTION:

So the non-partisan lawyer becomes a

j anitor?
MR. PARRIS:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

He

still has a right to run but —
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:

But he ends up a jenitor.
No, Your Honor.
I don’t see where you get this special

privilege of a party member.
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:

Party member?
I don't see ^^here you get that In the

Constitution.
MR. PARRIS:

Well, not in the Constitution but

the Court can take judicial notice of the importance of the
tt^o-party system which has been for the past 200 years.

22
Recommendations or patronage, whatever you want, is in all
of our public and our private lives.

Everyone recommends

someone for something.
QUESTION:

I know a very great prcsecuting

attorney in New York that had both parties endorse him
every time he ran.
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:

That happens quite often.
Isn't the real question not whether the

patronage system is desirable or undesirable or whether New
York has chosen it or not, but this was a civil rights
action where Judge Broderick found that Rockland County's
application of it violated the federal Constitution, and
unless it violates the federal Constitution New York is
free to choose as baaarre a system of promotion as it wants.
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
So far as the federal courts are con~

cerned.
MR. PARRIS:

Yes.

What I believe this Court

should be following, as I said

before, is the reasoning

especially of Judge Hall's concurrence because there 1
think is a tremendous resemblance between Ramey v. Harber
and this case.

In both cases, you don't have the coercion

of Elrod and in both cases you have terms that came to an
end.

Yes, and in Ramey v. Harber it was by statute, but

it was also the question of a small office, looking for

23
loyalty as opposed to the deputy sheriff's office in Cook
County, which was 3,000 or 4,000 employees.
QUESTION:
MR» PARRIS:

Where is Rockland County, Mr. Parris?
It Is about thirty miles north of

New York City, northwest of New York City.
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:

New York City, is It —
It is across the Tappanzae Bridge

from Westchester County and right above New Jersey.
QUESTION:

The Tappanzee Bridge comes into

Rockland County?
MR. PARRIS:
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:

Correct, from Westchester.
South of Bear Mountain.
Exactly.

Exactly.

As to the relationship of the public defender and
his assistants and as to whether a public defender is in
fact a policy-maker, I have a great deal of problem because
I really — at the time I read Elrod, I have been troubled
by itfhat this Court meant by policy-making confidential,

I

think that lower court decisions, legal periodicals are all
in the same position.

Possibly Harvard Law Review is the

closest when they said janitors and elevator operators
definitely are not, department heads probably are, and
everyone between would have to be decided on a case by case
basis by the court,
I think that one point I would like to make is

2>i

that the assistants are the alter-ego, the extension of the
public defender.

They are in these just 23 justice courts

around the county, and they are the public defender when
they walk into those courts.

official for a term of four years —
QUESTION:

Which is it?

QUESTION:

In the case of the U.S. Attorney, I

think It is both.
QUESTION:

And the four years can expire and if

you aren’t reappointed you are through.
MR. PARRIS:

In the case of the assistant public

defenders or assistant county atfco3?neys -—
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:

No, no, U.S. Attorneys.
Oh, I am not familiar with that,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:

United States Attorneys.
As I earlier stated, I had this

problem about public defender but I would like to give this
example possibly, because I am not sure whether public
defender is a policy-holder or who is a policy-holder,
just a legislator and his confidential secretary, is it the
judge and his lav/ secretary, and then what about the others

26
in an office?
I thought about this and I took the example of
the possibility of a public defender stating we will have
no more pleas on marihuana cases, and he gives that to his
assistant public defenders and they go into the courts to
implement that policy.

But he is the one up front, he is

the one in the courts, he sees the witnesses, the judge,
the jury, and when he comes back and they discuss it in
the public defender's office and he states that on this
case, chief, we must take a plea, I've seen that witness,
I’ve seen that judge, this one we are going to change your
policy.

Are they not in a confidential relationship with­

in the making, the implementing and the changing of a policy?
I reserve whatever time I have left for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Wagner, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID MacRAE WAGNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WAGNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to begin by addressing myself to the
issue that was being dealt with by Mr. Justice Stewart just
before the luncheon recess, which is the question is the
permanency of the appointments of assistant public defenders.
I think the record will show firstly Mr. Finkel

27
was appointed with less than a year remaining in the term
of his appointing public defender, Arnold Becker.

Page 94

of the record further shows that Mr. Pinkel left another
job to take that job and he testified not only did he be­
lieve his appointment permanent subject only to the right
of the public defender to discharge him for improperly
performing his job, but that he would not have left one
job to go to another job with only nine months tenure re­
maining.
QUESTION:

Counsel, what do you make of Footnote

10 in Judge Broderick’s opinion at page 32a of the
appendix, the fact that plaintiffs are removable at the
vd.ll of the public defender, not for cause but at the will
of the public defender?
MR. WAGNER:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that

the District Court found that a set term or lack thereof
was irrelevant in his application of E3.rod to the facts in
this case.

I don’t think he decided whether there was or

was not a set term.
QUESTION:

Well, the very page of the record to

which he referred us indicates the awareness of the witness
that he could be dismissed without cause, which means
employment at will.

I am looking toward the bottom of the

page there, the last question and answer.
MR. WAGNER:

Well, respectfully, Mr. Justice

28
Stewart;, this Court has held in the past that while employees
can be dismissed for no reason, they cannot be dismissed for
the wrong reason»
QUESTION:

Yes, I know that, but I was just in­

dicating that this question and answer and without more
support of Footnote 10.
MR. WAGNER:

And I might furthei* go on to point

out that Mr. Finkel, whatever the procedure is in Mr.
Parris5 county attorneys office, Mr. Finkel testified that
when Mr. Barone replaced Mr. Becker, he was not formally
reappointed, he took no formal steps to remain in the
office, he was merely told casually and verbally to stay
on.

This is a far cry from the situation that Mr. Justice

White describes where there is a 3et term and you must take
an oath of office or you have no

egal standing whatsoever.

The court I think very accurately perceived the
situation here, there is a big void, there is no statutory
provision setting a fixed term or an unfixed term for an
assistant public defender.
QUESTION:

And yet the District Court labeled a

whole heading of its opinion, beginning on page 25a,
"Plaintiffs were not reappointed."

That is quite a differ­

ent thing from discharged, and if two of the necessary —
of the five votes necessary to support a majority judgment
in Elrod v. Burns limited themselves to the question of

29
whether it was unconstitutional to discharge people because
of their political beliefs , if these people “were not dis­
charged then Elrod is not applicable.
MR, WAGNER:

Then* Your Honor, I would refer back

to Perry v. Slndermann where there is a very similar situa­
tion.

There was an underwritten agreement in essence that

untenured teachers in fact did by tradition have tenure»
The —
QUESTION:

But Sindermann had. a contract, didnEt

he, year by year?
MR. WAGNER:

Yes, which expired, as I recall

the facts correctly, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Running for ten consecutive years which,

as I recall, the Court thought created an expectancy of
continuation, at least that wa3 a factor.
MR, WAGNER:

Well, Your Honor, I might respect­

fully point out that Mr. Finkel, who was in the public
defender’s office for seven years, saw under Mr. Becker
four Republicans and four Democrats; under Mr. Barone
approximately the same mix, four-four and one unregistered,
and certainly Mr. Tabakman, who came In later, had the same
expectation that succeeding public defenders would continue
the nonpartisan policy of the office.
QUESTION:
MR. WAGNER:

Nov?, is that in the record somewhere?
The number of —

30

QUESTION:

Nos no, his expectation that this in

fact, whatever the law was, in fact this was an appoint­
ment of an indefinite duration.

Is that in the record any­

where?
MR. WAGNER:

Yes, Mr. Finkel testified explicitly

that he thought the appointment was permanent.
QUESTION:

Where is this?

MR. WAGNER:

I believe It is on pages ?6 and 77 of

the appendix, and also page 9^ on either recross or redirect,
I believe, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, on page 77 there is the question,

about the middle of the page, did you approach Mr, Barone
about being retained in your position.

Answer, no he just

continued me in office.
MR. WAGNER:

And I submit, Mr, Justice Rehnquist,

that that militates against a set term.

The fact that

there was no formal requirement of taking a new oath or any
formal requirement other than just remaining in the same
office, doing the same job for a new boss.
QUESTION:

But the answer was he continued me in

office, not I remained in office.
MR. WAGNER:

Well, I concede the wording which,

of course, implies, as we have conceded, that these assistants
serve at the pleasure of the public defender.

But it also

indicates to me that there is a continuing employment in the

31
absence of an action on the part of a Mr. Branti who at­
tempts to terminate.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you this:

Is your basic

claim that this is a Perry v. Sindermann and Roth v. Board
of Regents type of case where even though the people had
no job tenure claim, they were fired for the exercise of a
constitutional right of free speech, or an Elrod v. Burns
case, or do you see no distinction between the two?
MR. WAGNER:

Well, Your Honor, we took the posi­

tion in the District Court that these were in effect con­
tinued employments, they were not as in Ramey set by statute
at a fixed term.

The District Court judge, as I interpret

his decision, took no position on that —
QUESTION:
MR. WAGNER:
QUESTION:

He said it made no difference»
Exactly.
Even if their terms expired with the

public defender’s term, the failure to reappoint them for
this kind of a reason was constitutionally wrong.
MR. WAGNER:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Justice White.
And that is the judgment you are de­

fending here.
MR. WAGNER:

That’s correct. Your Honor, and in

view of the fact that —
QUESTION:
is it?

That is not covered by Elrod at all.

32
QUESTION:
said at all.

That is not what the District Court

At page 25a., he said the third and final re­

quirement of the concurrence in Elrod is the attempt to
remove plaintiffs from their jobs had been based upon the
sole ground of their political beliefs, I find that this
requirement has been satisfied.

Isn't that a finding that

the only reason fox'* the removal was their political beliefs?
That is the way the Court of Appeals interpreted it on page
2a.

The Court of Appeals said Judge Broderick found that

the appellant had attempted to terminate their employment
on the sole ground of their political beliefs.
MR. WAGNER:

No, but —

QUESTION:

But you concede something else.v

QUESTION:

But you don’t take any position —

you say the District Judge didn’t take any position on
whether it was a termination or a renewal.

That is \*hat

you were saying.
MR. WAGNER:

Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice

Stevens, as I read Footnote 10, Justice Broderick says the
fact that the plaintiffs are removable at will is Irrele­
vant to the determination of the constitutional issue,
therefore I don’t think Judge Broderick reached that.
QUESTION:

So you are saying even if this was a

failure to reappoint, even if their terms had expired and
it was only a failure to reappoint, the fact that they

33
refused to reappoint because of their political beliefs is
constitutionally wrong, like the District Court concluded.
MR. WAGNER:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
Elrod covers it unless they are con­

fidential or policy-making?
MR. WAGNER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

I be­

lieve Elrod read in conjunction with Perry the expectation
of continued employment I believe covers the situation.
QUESTION:

But then don't you. have to argue here

that or sustain the holding below that these positions were
not in fact confidential or policy-making?
MR. WAGNER:

That is correct. Your Honor, and I

believe that, first of all, the District Court did so find
and the Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed that finding.
Secondly, I think, although my learned adversary has made
much of the fact that lawyers are not janitors, a fact
which I would be the first to concede, these lawyers are
very unlike other lawyers in government.

These are not

people vjho give advice to town boards, to zoning boards.
They are not hired by the government to advise the govern­
ment.

They are hired by the government to represent Indi­

vidual indigent defendants.
QUESTION:

They —

What about a situation where the new

public defender comes in and says the new policy of this
office for which I am responsible will be that we will take

34
no guilty pleas at all, or alternatively he says the policy
of this office will be that you are to direct all your ef­
forts to negotiate a plea, we’ve got to get this calendar
moving

now, does that not involve a very high policy in

terms of operating that office?
MR. WAGNER:

The policy-setter himself, yes, but

he has instructed his assistant public defenders as to what
they can and cannot do.

In fact, Mr. Pa.rris gave a hypo­

thetical example, I can give the Court an actual example.
The District Attorney in Rockland County has established a
policy that he will not accept pleas to a lesser offense in
cases of driving while intoxicated where the blood alcohol
reading is in excess of .20.

This is a policy that all

his assistant district attorneys must follow.
The District Attorney, like the public defender,
himself sets the policy, the assistants disobey that policy
at their peril and they aresubject, as the plurality in
Elrod pointed out, to dismissal for cause.
QUESTION:

But how?

How is the prosecutor or the

public defender, the head of the staff going to follow what
each one of the nine assistants is going to do on each
specific case, in many instances that assistant will be
handling ten or twenty cases in one day.

MR. WAGNER:

Well, Your Honor, I think we are

drawing a distinction here between cases by case discretion

35
which, both Mr. Barone and Mr. Branti indicated that in­
dividual assistant public defenders have and broad, the
broad overall goals of the office as referred to in the
plurality where the public defender says it shall be the
goal of our office to concentrate on marihuana pleas,
driving while intoxicated, whatever you choose, and then
it is up to his employees to follow that drug policy scope.
But they do not decide in the initial instance what the
policy of the office will be.
QUESTION:

My point was is it possible, feasible,

with the volume of cases you would have in these relatively
minor offenses, to monitor what each one is doing or is he
not entitled to select a person of his own choice in whom
he has confidence and sure knoxfledpje that they will carry
out his policies?

Is that a factor in. this case is what I
I

am asking.
MR. WAGNER:

Mr.' Chief Justice, I think the

sheriff in Elrod was entitled, the sheriff’s deputies who
followed his policy directives, and of course any employer
is entitled to have loyal employees.
QUESTION:

I thought you had already conceded

that there is quite a difference between a deputy sheriff
and a lawyer.
MR. WAGNER:
basis.

There is a difference on a general

But when you look at the specific duties that these

36
gentlemen performed, is there such a great difference between
trying a case, an individual case on a case by case basis
within the guidelines laid down by the public defender and
the decisions made by a deputy sheriff?

The deputy sheriff

has the decision of life and death over a fleeing perpetra­
tor.

Any job that Involves any degree of discretion, there

are some case by case policy decisions to be made.
For example, the deputy sheriffs may be instructed
alxifays fire one warning shot before you shoot at a fleeing
felon or never fire your firearm under certain circumstances
That is a policy directive.

Or they may be given a certain

latitude with regard to whether they use their firearm in
isolated areas or in metropolitan areas.

These case by case

decisions I submit are not the policy-making referred to by
this Court in Elrod.

There is always in practically any

occupation some degree of case by case review by the in­
dividual.
Now, Mr. Parris, my learned adversary, indicated
in some detail the value of a system which enables young
attorneys to enter the political system and in effect get a
leg up into politics and, like Mr. Parris, I got my start
in politics the same way.

I don't quarrel with that system.

However, that is not the way it; works.
Of the appointees made to these positions, they
were the people, as Mr. Justice Marshall pointed out, who

37
were given the chore, the politically active, the successful
who xfere able to get these favored jobs.
QUESTION:

Who said that?

MR» WAGNER:

Your Honor Indicated — I may have

stretched your point a little bit, but Your Honor indicated
that —
QUESTION:

I though there were quite a few inde­

pendent unregistered lawyers that I know personally that are
pretty good lawyers and making a pretty good living, and
they didn’t have to join any party.
MR. WAGNER:

Your Honor, I thought your point was

that in order to get ahead in politics you had to join one
of the parties.

I am not saying he will make a good living

without it, but you have to be a member —
QUESTION:

I did not say that and I don't believe

that.
MR. WAGNER:

Well, I am sorry I misconstrued Your

Honor's comments, in that case.

But that does not take

away from the point that I was attempting to make, which Is
essentially that it is not the young attorneys fresh out of
law school who get these positions, because they with rare
exceptions, unless they have some family political Influence,
they are not in a position to obtain these appointments.
QUESTION:
in Rockland County?

Is the pay pretty good for these things
In some parts of the country, it is

38
pretty much pro bono.
MR. WAGNER:

Ho, Your Honor, it is a fixed salary.

The reason that it is part-time is because, as Mr. Parris
indicated, there are 23 justice courts and it is more im­
portant to have a relatively large number of part-time
employees

and fewer full-time employees because a lot of

this is night work, and with 23 courts to be covered it is
necessary to have a large number of personnel available
several evenings a week plus days in the office.
QUESTION:

They work fixed hours, or how is their

time assigned?
MR. WAGNER:

Your Honor, my understanding is

they are assigned two days a week in the office plus each
attorney is assigned certain specific courts, in Which they
appear and handle regular calendars.
QUESTION:

MR. WAGNER:
sessions.

In the evenings?
Some are evenings, some are day

It depends on when the Individual court happens

to sit.
QUESTION:

Do you think this is any different

than some county rule that says in the next year we are
probably going to have ten public construction projects but
only Democrats or Republicans need bid on these or limit
the bidding opportunities to Democrats or Republicans?
MR„ WAGNER:

I think that is exactly the situation

39
here, as the District Court found.

No one who did not re­

ceive sponsorship of the Democratic caucus, which consisted
of the majority of the county legislature, was considered
for employment as an assistant public defender.
QUESTION:

Well, that is the issue here then, it

is not covered by Elrod v. Burns, is it?
MR. WAGNER:
QUESTION:

I believe, Your Honor, it is.
Well, a construction job isn't the same

as a confidential or policy-making assistant.
MR. WAGNER:

Your Honor, I don’t believe that

these gentlemen are policy-making or confidential.
QUESTION:

It may be, but for the reason suggested

by my brother Stewart, I don’t think the answer to a question
about whether construction jobs are assigned only to
Democrats or Republicans answers the question of whether one
may choose only Republicans or Democrats for confidential
or policy-making positions.
MR. WAGNER:

Your Honor, I agree with you perfectly,

if these were in fact confidential or policy-making posi­
tions .
QUESTION:

But it does get you across the bridge

that there is no difference between this charge and reappoint­
ment .
MR. WAGNER:

I believe that that is what Perry

read with Elrod in effect says.

I don’t think that there is

a. significant constitutional distinction between holding
and serving in a position that you are serving in well,
whether it is a fixed term or a determinate term.

I do

not for a moment concede that there is a fixed term in
this Instance.

I think it is an indeterminate term.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wagner, on that point your witness,

Mr. Pinkel, said he thought he had a permanent appointment.
Did that mean until he reached retirement age or what does
it mean?
MR. WAGNER:

No, Mr. Justice Powell.

I believe

if you read his testimony in context with some later crossexamination, he realized he served at the pleasure of. the
public defender but that he would not be terminated as long
as he did his job properly.

This was the experience under

the two prior public defenders of Rockland County.
QUESTION:

That is a different point from saying

— that is a much stronger expectation than saying I serve
at his will and he can fire me for any reason he wants to
except my political beliefs.
MR. WAGNER:

Well, isn’t that what thi3 Court has

said, that —
QUESTION:

Well, that is a difference, too,

nevertheless and it is completely different from what you
just said.
MR. WAGNER:

Someone who

serves at will can be

terminated for no reason but not an improper reason, and I
would submit —
QUESTION:

That Is as far as you need to go, I

QUESTION:

You are saying he could only be fired

gather.

for cause, is that the substance of your view?
MR. WAGNER:

Well, I wouldn't go quite that far,

Mr. Justice Powell.

I would say that he cannot be fired

for a constitutionally impermissible reason. QUESTION:

Well, couldn’t he be fired to replace

him with his brother?
MR. WAGNER:
QUESTION:
MR. WAGNER:

I mean that is not —
Yes.

Yes.

Well, that is not for cause, is it?
No, that is why I would not go as

far as to say only for cause.
QUESTION:
MR. WAGNER:

Yes.
I will not go any further than to

say
QUESTION:

You would say that he couldn’t fire

him because of his political beliefs.
MR. WAGNER:

Right, I will not go any further

than to say he cannot be fired for constitutionally imper­
missible reasons.
QUESTION:

Would he have an entitlement to a due

process hearing before being fired, as in Arnett?

42
MR. WAGNER:

If he is discharged allegedly for

cause?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WAGNER:
QUESTION:

Not statutorily, Your Honor.
But constitutionally?

MR. WAGNER:

I believe that that would be a con­

stitutional right to that, but not under the statute.
QUESTION:

If he had alleged that he had been

fired for an unconstitutional reason, then —
If it were alleged that he had in

MR. WAGNER:

some way improperly performed his duties and he claimed he
had not improperly performed them, I believe he would be
entitled to a hearing.
QUESTION:

Certainly there is —»

Why would you say that?

You just

conceded -— what if he said, well, I was fired, I was
doing my job well but I was fired because — not because
I didn’t do my job well but because he wanted to replace
me with my brother, he wouldn’t p;et any hearing.
MR. WAGNER:

That's correct.

I said, Your

Honor, if he were allegedly dismissed for improperly per­
forming his duties, he would have a hearing.

That would

be discharge for cause.
QUESTION:

But he is not entitled to be dis­

charged only for cause.
MR. WAGNER:

No.

Again, Your Honor, I have to

^3
fall back on my statement that he can be discharged for any
reason except an impermissible one, except a constitution­
ally abhorrent reason.
QUESTION:

Well, what are those that are involved

in this case?
MR. WAGNER:

Specifically in this case, as the

District Court found, these assistant public defenders were
not continued in their employment solely because they were
not members of the majority political party in Rockland
County

and were not sponsored by members of that party.
QUESTION:

Okay.

Then you’ve got to show in

addition to that that they were not confidential or policy­
making officials?
MR. WAGNER:

Absolutely, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

and that is exactly what we contend, that they are — the
District Court so found, the Court of Appeals affirmed that
finding, they are case by case representatives of the indi­
gent.

They do not make government policy, they do not

advise government boards, they do not even advise the public
defender other than to say here I am, give me my files to
go to court and I will represent the indigent.
QUESTION:

Well, what if one of them comes in to

the public defender and says I think we’ve got a real
problem with Judge so and so in such and such a precinct
and I think we ought to try to transfer all the cases we

can out of that precinct to another one»

Isn’t there some

sort of confidentiality there?
MR. WAGNER:

I don’t believe there is any more

confidentiality there than a deputy sheriff or a police
officer saying so and so's bar in downtown Rockland County
is a hangout for young alcoholics and there are fights there
every night and we ought to increase our police —
QUESTION:

Or that we are having trouble getting

search warrants from a certain judge.
MR. WAGNER:

Exactly, Your Honor.

Again, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist, I think that is a recommendation to a
policy-maker which may or may not be acted on.

The publie

defender still has the absolute right to say you are wrong,
we are not going to do it.
QUESTION:

He makes the policy.

But frequently a confidential employee

or one who makes a recommendation to a policy-maker and not
himself a policy-maker, is not that so?
MR. WAGNER:

I believe that that was Judge

Broderick’s definition of confidentiality whieh I think is
a good one, one who stands in a confidential relationship
to a policy-maker.

But he, as I, limits that to, for example,

the confidential secretary to a town supervisor, a confiden­
tial law secretary to a judge, someone with whom there is a
very close interaction.

I don't think that, as I read Elrod,

this confidentiality extends to an entire office of people

who are essentially employees.

Undoubtedly, the chief as­

sistant public defender is confidential because he is the
alter ego of the public defender, just like Mr. Newcomb in
the Newcomb case, who was the deputy city attorney, who
made policy, made law, was in line to succeed as mayor of
the City of Milwaukee, I believe it was, certainly he was a
policy-maker but the city attorneys under him were not.
QUESTION;

Do you think that the assistants some­

times give legal opinions to their superiors as to what
should be done about a case?
MR. WAGNER:

Yes, Your Honor, as to what should

be done about a case, but that again, as the plurality
points out, is decision-making on a case by case basis, not
broad overall implementation of policy such as concentrated
on a particular type of crime —
QUESTION:

If he is doing that, he is in the

relationship of a lawyer to a client essentially, is he
not?
MR. WAGNER;

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

I

think it falls into Mr. Justice White’s analogy of the
police officer who says we’re having trouble getting a
search warrant from a certain judge.
QUESTION:

That certainly is a confidential

matter, isn’t it, if nothing else?
MR. WAGNER:

Well, Your Honor, I would submit that

probably the lowliest clerk of the FBI must keep his in­
formation confidential» but does that make him constitution­
ally unprotected as a policy-maker?

I don't believe it

does.
QUESTION:

Well, let’s stay with this situation,

an assistant who says let’s keep away from Judge Jones, he
just never will give us a warrant.

Now, is that a confi­

dential communication within that office?
MR. WAGNER:

I believe the communication is con­

fidential, but I —
QUESTION:

He hopes it is.

MR. WAGNER:

— but I do not believe that that

creates a confidential relationship, as this Court meant
in Elrod, because if you are going to make that many employees
confidential, then aren't you in a sense in essence vitiating
the

holding in Elrod?

I think the plurality in Elrod very

meticulously detailed the reasons for excluding confidential
and policy-making employees and left the others protected by
that holding, and the reason was,, as I interpret it, that
the policy-making and confidential employees were in a po­
sition to in effect thwart the goals of the newly appointed
public defender or sheriff or whatever, whereas assistant
public defenders, the only way that they could embarrass or
interrupt the operation of the public defender's office
would be if they did not competently perform their jobs and

47
then, of course, they could be discharged for cause.

So I

submit that they do not come in under the heading of those
who must be excluded from the Elrod holding because they
are in a position to obstruct their supervisor.
QUESTION:

Don’t you think a defense counsel

could throw a case, as it were — you know what I mean by
that —
MR. WAGNER:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes.
— and do it, if he did it skillfully,

in a way that it would be very difficult to establish that
fact?
MR. WAGNER:
QUESTION:

Well, It may be difficult —
Say it is a very unpopular defendant

and the community is aroused and wants that fellow to go
to jail and the assistant defender is politically ambitious
and so he just lets this fellow go down the drain.

That is

a possibility, isn't it?
MR. WAGNER:

Of course, it is a possibility,

Your Honor, but then again he is not properly performing
his job, just as —
QUESTION:

Do you think it' is easy to monitor

that kind of thing?
MR. WAGNER:

Corruption is never easy to monitor,

any more than it is easy to monitor a corrupt deputy
sheriff who takes bribes to let felons escape»

It happens.

48
We try and prevent It, but it is going to happen no matter
how hard we try.

I don't think that that is the setting

criteria, in my opinion.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
further, Mr. Parris?

Do you have anything

You have about two minutes left.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARC L. PARRIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. PARRIS:

If I could make two quick points.

I

don't want to leave this Court or have this Court left with
the impression that Democrats in Rockland County don't rehire Republicans.

Two of the leading people in the county,

Mr. George Renk, who is director of our audit and control,
is a Republican.

Initially —

QUESTION:
MR. PARRIS:

There are some they don't?
Some they don’t, right, but we have

quite a few and I don't want to leave that impression.

I

would just leave the Court with, as to the question of
continuation of employment, which I think is paramount,
as was stated by Mr. Justice Stewart in the Board of
Regeants v. Roth, "It stretches the concept too far to
suggest; that a person is deprived of liberty when he simply
