P ROC E E D I H G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

this afternoon in Fred H. Walker against ARMCO Steel
Corporation.
Mr. Manners, I think you may proceed now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DON MANNERS, ESQ.,
ON BEHAI,F OF THE PETITIONER FRED N. WALKER
MR. MANNERS:

Mr. Chief Justice and Members of

This Honorable Courts
Fred Walker was a carpenter, and on August 22,
1975, he was driving an ARMCO nail into a piece of wood and
it shattered, putting out his eye.
He came to my firm and eventually we filed a suit
on August 19, 1977, within the two-year statute of
limitation in the Federal Court.
what shall we say, lost?

And the summons were,

We thought the marshal had them

and the marshal thought the Clerk had them.

And we did a

file review some 90 days later and we found them in our
filing cabinet.

We took them down there.

I want to be

square with you.
QUESTION:

In your filing cabinet?

MR. MANNERS:

Yes, sir.

I can’t find who — no one

will admit in the firm ever bringing them, back but, anyway,
we found them in an unmarked folder in the filing cabinet
on a file review.

That8a how we found out they didn’t gat

to the marshal .

In any event# the summons are taken to

the marshal and ARMCO is served some 104 days later.
Now# Oklahoma has a statute that they must be
served within 60 days beyond the statute of limitation#
part of their statute.

It’s a question of whether or not

it is procedural or substantive# I guess.

And# of course#

under Rule 3# you don't have that problem.
Anyway# service was had and then the Ragan Case
casae like a falcon out of the skies and struck down our
lawsuit# and here we are.
QUESTION:

The Ragan Case was decided somewhat

before your lawsuit# wasn’t it?
MR. MANNERS:

Yes# sir.

The Hanna Case is a group barn burner on our
side, but it didn't overrule Ragan.
QUESTION:

There are only nine of us up her® too.

MR. MANNERS:

Anyway# Judge Doyle of the Tenth

Circuit# when he wrote his opinion# the last paragraph
states# "The Supreme Court would perform a great service
if it were to clear away the dilemma which exists as
a result of the conflict between Ragan and Hanna."
He says# "We recognise that decisions are
frequently allowed to die on the vine# so to speak.
recognize under such instances death does not# as a
practical matter# take place.

If# however# Ragan was

Wa also

5

intended to die a natural death, ifc failed to happen,"
So what we are here — I am attempting to
persuade-QUESTION?

You come not to praise Ragan,but to

bury it, I take it?
MR. MANNERS:

I come to bury Ragan, if possible.

Now, Chief Justice Warren in the Hanna Case wrote
a spectacular decision, well-reasoned, well thought out.
And Justice Harlan in his concurring—
QUESTION?

And carefully saved Ragan.

MR. MANNERS %
QUESTIONs

And carefully saved Ragan.

Well thought, out.

MR,, MANNERS s

Well thought out? carefully saved

Ragan,
But Justice Harlan state* in his concurring
opinion that he thought Ragan was wrong.

And you know,

going back at the beginning, under 28 — Section 2072, when
they enacted the Rules, the Federal Rules, it said, 51 All
laws in conflict with such Rules should be a little further
forre or effect unless, of course, they invade the
sub stantive portion."
So, really what we are talking about is whether
or not the Federal Rules of commencement of an action in
service are procedural or substantive.

You know, I am

legislature had enacted?
MR. MANNERSs

No, sir, because Oklahoma Courts

are not covered by Rule 3.

QUESTION:

This is a Federal question.

MR. MANNERS:
QUESTION:

A Federal

question,, right.

What is the principle you want us to

adopt?
MR. MANNERS:

I want you to adopt the principles

illucidated in Hanna.
QUESTION:

And v/hat are those?

MR. MANNERS:

Those are for uniformity, the

This case turns on

Rule 4 1(d), which is where the statute requires that you

Federal Rules, the Rule having to do with service would

QUESTION:

What if the Federal Rules had no

provision which was a counterpart to Oklahoma's provision
here?
MR. MANNERS:

What would I do?

I would be defending

a case of malpractice; that's what I would be doing,
probably.
QUESTION:

You say that there must be an affirmative

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure covering this point?
MR. MANNERS:

Without Federal Rule 3 and

Federal Rule 4, I have no standing.
QUESTION:

You don't urge us to go back to

8
Swift against Tyson, or the days of the Federal common law?
MR. MANNERS:

Mo, sir.

The Federal Rules set up

for the maintenance and the handling of Federal cases in
this country, I think should be controlling of cases filed
in the Federal Courts.

Now, I am embarrassed, and I should

be that this matter happened at: my ' law firm.

But.

under the pure question of law that Fred Walker is entitled
to relief.

I think that: the Federal Rules, Rule 3 should

govern what commences an action.
The Federal Rule states it very succinctly.

It

says, it's told when the case is filed, under Federal Rule 3,
Now, your Rule 4—
QUESTION:

Does Federal Rule 3 say "told"?

MR. MANNERS:

Let me get it exactly, Your Honor.

Rule 3, "A civil action is commenced by filing a
complaint with the Court.'’

That is what it says specifically.

Rule 4 puts the burden upon the Clerk.

It says,

"Upon filing of a complaint, the Clerk shall forthwith
issue a summons and deliver it for service to the marshal
or persons specially appointed to sarvfc it.
QUESTION:

What is there in the Rule though

that says that the beginning of an action is just the
filing of the complaint satisfies the State's statute of
limitations?
say that?

I mean, it may start the action, but does it

9
MR. MANNERS;

It says, "A civil action is commenced

by filing a complaint with the Court.”
QUESTION;

I know a civil action is commenced,

but what makes — why is; that ~ would that necessarily —
what if a State law said just specifically that, and by the
way, we mean what we say, just the starting of an action does
not satisfy our statute of limitations.
MR. MANNERS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor—

It has to be some other event that

happened before the statute of limitations is satisfied.
MR. MANNERS;

Oklahoma State law does provide

that an action is commenced by the filing of the petition,
but it has an additional statute, two sections down, that
cays if you can't get service v/ith due diligence within
60 days that you're just through.
QUESTION;

What is there in Rule 3 to prevent

the State from having such a provision?

This is a matter

of State law, a State statute of limitations law.
MR. MANNERS;

Excuse me, Your Honor.

There is

nothing to prevent the State from having that law.

My

position is that under the Federal Rules, Fred Walker is
entitled to the Federal Rule law, under Hanna, which goes

You don’t have uniformity under

MR, MANNERS:

Your Honor.

I say you don't under the substantive

MR. MANNERS:

No, sir.

What's the virtue of uniformity, as you

pUj., ..-..h f on the procedural side when basically you are
dealing with practitioners in Oklahoma City or Tulsa who
practice in both the Federal and State Courts?
MR, MANNERS:

Well, it would make it a lot easier

on the Circuit Courts, for one thing, because they would not

11
have the higgledy-piggledly mess of each State having a
different set of semi or quasi substantive or procedural law,
Procedural or substantive is a difficult question at best.
But, if you file a case in Court,you ought to go by that
Court9s procedures.

QUESTION s

What if the statute of limitations in

Oklahoma said that the statute of limitations will run until
a complaint is served?

Unless

the complaint is served

within the period, the case is over.

Rule 3 wouldn't

prevent that, would it?
MR. MANNERS?
QUESTION;

Well, Rule 4 did in the Hanna Case,

Why?

No, it didn't.

That isn't,

what the Court said there.
MR. MANNERS;

Your Honor, they served the executor

by leaving it with his wife.

The State statute provides

that you had to serve the executor in hand.

And they held

that the Federal Rules of Service circumvented the State
Rule required that the executor be served in hand.

There

is very little difference between that and the Riile 3, of
following the Federal Rules so far as filing the case
commencing it and the service being sent out by the Clerk
to the marshal and served.
Rule 4 gives the Clerk the duty—'
QUESTION;

But Henna didn't say — Hanna certainly

12
didn’t say that if the State law required service to toll
the statute, that just the filing of the complaint will toll
the statute too.

That isn’t what Hanna held.

It didn’t

say that at all.

It said — what you are suggesting to us

is that that is what we should hold now.
MR * MANNERS:

No, sir, I am saying if you extend

the Hanna rule to cover Rule 3, like the Second Circuit
thinks it should be-—
QUESTIONS

Does the Second Circuit think it should

be, or do they think that’s what Hanna did?
MR. MANNERS:

They think that Hanna overruled

Ragan.
QUESTION %

Whs.t ’ s the virtue of unif ormity on the

procedural side if you’re not going to have it on the
substantiva side?
MR. MANNERS:

Well, I guess the virtue would be

that under the Federal Rules and under the Federal system to
make them the same.

Each citizen and each State would have

the Sima rights under the Federal law.
QUESTION:

Well, that was the same justification

that Justice Storey advanced for Swift against Tyson,IN
1842, that the law doss not lay down one rule in Athens and
another rule in Home? that the law should be uniform
throughout the Federal Court System substantively.
don’t agree with that, I take it?

You

MR. MANNERS;
QUESTION %

Why not?

MR. MANNERSs
QUESTION;

Bof sir.

That’s the way life is.

That's your answer to Brother

Rehnquist’s question whether or not you agree or don't
sigree^ that is the law.
MR. MANNERS;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

That under Erie) Railroad against

Tompkins, Federal Courts and diversity actions are required
to apply State substantive law.

It is equally well-settled

that; as a matter of procedure, and everybody agrees that it
is a matter of procedure, then there is a uniform l^eral
law applied, in diversity cases, in Federal Courts as well
as all other cases in Federal Courts.
MR. MANNERS;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Whether that’s good or bad or

philosophically supportable or not, you don’t need to say.
It is the law.
MR. MANNERS;

Sir, I do feel very strongly that

service of summons and the ltol.es about commencing an action
are procedural.
QUESTION;

Well, let's assume that Rule 3 does

cover when an action is commenced for Federal purposes, and
that there is nothing that the State can say that will'
change that, that if you file the complaint, the action is
commenced, the State doesn't argue with you ab cut that.

14
Your opponent doesn't have to worry about that.

He will just

say, however, that that just _tsn5-,': enough to start to toll

The State law says you have to

They say our statute of limitations runs until

a complaint, but you must obtain service within 60 days.
QUESTION;
this case?

What was the statute of limitations in

You've got two years and 60 days.

And you have

MR. MANNERSs
don't say that though.

That's correct.

The Federal Rules

And I think we out to follow the

Federal Rules in this case.
QUESTIONs

Let's go back a step.

What was the

purpose of the diversity provisions of the Constitution?
That was just giving what was thought to be a neutral forum.
MR. MANNERS;
QUESTION?

Stop forum shopping.

Now, how does uniformity advance the

idea of getting a neutral forma.* one where citizens of
another State were at least thought to have a better chance
to get fair treatment in a Federal Court than a local
court?

How is that advanced, that concept advanced by

15
saying that the service or process must be uniform?
MR. MANNERS %

It would advance, each person would

know from whence they hailed that the same rules applied
insofar as procedure in their courthouse in Milwaukee would
apply so far as procedures are concerned in the courthouse
in Oklahoma City.
QUESTION?

Isn't it more than that, Mr. Manners?

Isn't there also the point that you do have cases in the
Federal Courts that are not diversity cases.

And I presume

there is some advantage in having the same rules apply in
Federal trials, whether it raises a Federal question or a
State law question or a mixture of both?
MR. MANNERSs
QUESTION;

And man cases are a mixture of both.

MR. MANNERSs
QUESTIONs

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Isn't there another question here?

If your Federal Rules apply, as X understand them, the duty
to affect prompt service is rested with the Clerk of the
Court?
MR. MANNERS;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Delivering the summons to the marshal.

How does the procedure work under Oklahoma law?
Is it your burden under Oklahoma law?
MR. MANNERS:

You go up to the Clerk's office and

you file it, and there is a big basket there, and they pitch

16

it in the big basket, and if you don’t want it three or four
days getting to the Sheriff; you say, "Let me have that"and
you take it back and give it to the deputy.
QUESTION?

Are you talking about the Federal Court

or the State Court?
MR. MANNERS:
QUESTION:

State.

In the State Court, in other words,

there is a responsibility of the plaintiff and his counsel
to cause the marshal to be delivered — to cause the
summons to be delivered to the marshal?
MR. MANNERS:

No, sir.

They put it in a basket,

but if there is a two or three delay getting it to the
Sheriff, if you want it down to the Sheriff that day, then

you ask them to give it to you and you walk down and give
it to the Sheriff.
QUESTION:

I see.

But you have told us already

that you never got around that far? you didn’t get it into
the basket.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY M. GALT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT ARMCO STEEL
CORPORATION.
MR. GALT:

MR. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
I am Jay M. Galt, from the Law Firm of
Looney, Nichols, Johnson £• Hayes, Oklahoma City, representing
the Respondent ARMCO Steel Corporation, an Ohio corporation.
The facts of the ease are much as outlined by
Mr. Manners.

However, I would like to point out to the

Court that ARMCO Steel Corporation retains a National
Service Corporation as its resident agent in the State of
Oklahoma, whose office is located within four blocks of the
Federal Courthouse.

And when service was effected, 101 days

after the statute of limitations had run, that was the very
first notice, the first notice that ARMCO had received
of any claim by Mr. Walker against ARMCO for injuries he
allegedly sustained by reason of a defective nail.
The Petitioner in this case is a resident of the
State of Oklahoma, took advantage of the diversity statute,
and chose his forum in the Federal Court.

The Petitioner

admits that had he filed, this case in the State District
Court, and, in fact, it might have been an after thought
that he filed it in the Federal Court, his initial pleading
is denominated a petition rather than a complaint, and in our

19

State Court we would call our initial pleading a petition,
he chose the Federal Court, and has admitted that had he
filed this in the State Court, and the same facts had
existed, no service for 101 days, without question, his case
would have been barred and dismissed»
But because he was fortuitous enough to file it in
the Federal Court, we are now before this Honorable body
today asking and questioning whether or not Ragan should
prevail as the rule covering this case.
It is the

position of the Respondent, obviously,

that Ragan is good law and that if this Court were to
reverse Ragan and hold that Hanna applied, and that the
commencement of this action by filing with the Clerk tolled
the statute of limitations.
QUESTION:

How can wa — How is a Federal matter,

when you say that for State law purposes, the statute of
limitations is tolled?
MR. GALTs

I don’t think you can.

What the

Petitioner in this case is asking that you do is rule that
by filing under Rule 3, that mere act tolled the statuta of
limitations, and
QUESTIONi

And that th® State is incompetent to

require another step.
MR. GALT:
agree with that.

That's correct.

And we honestly don't

We think that Rule 3 does not apply.

State

20

law applies, and the State law is very clear that if you file
your action within the appropriate statute of limitations
period, from the time that that statute runs, you then have
60 days to affect service.

And there is a case Taylor v. Taylor

that Judge Doyle cites that is out of our Court of Appeals,
that says that the filing commences the action, but there is
one step more required to effect jurisdiction of the State
District Court, and that is service on the Defendant.

And it

sets that other step that the Petitioner in this case failed
to take for reasons that he has been very honest with the
Court about today.

The

important thing that I see in this

case is that should this Court decide that Rule 3 commences
an action to toll the limitations, what happens to the
diversity defendant who has the same case filed in the State
Court, the same facts being present, no service for 101 days,
and then mistakenly that diversity defendant to obtain the
benefits of the diversity rule removes his case to the
Federal Court, files his motion to dismiss and finds that it
will be overruled.

Because had he stayed in the State

Court, his motion to «dismiss would have been sustained but
because the Federal Court —

MR, GALT?

Mr, Justice Rehnquist, the procedure

in th ;.t case would ba that had the summons not been issued
for six years, we had no similar statute, the Defendant
would most likely file a motion under Rule 41 to have the
case dismissed for lack of diligent prosecution,

I believe

that's the correct rule.

QUESTION^

Mr, Galt* can I ask you a question?

MR. GALT2

Sure„

QUESTIONs

About the Oklahoma practice* because I

have been a little confused.

I thought I heard some

argument to the effect that as a matter of Oklahoma law*
this action was commenced * but then there just wasn't
service within 60 days.

That’s not right* is it?

The

action was not commenced* as a matter of Oklahoma law* as
1' read the statute.

It says it is commenced at the time

the summons is served on him? isn’t that right?
MR. GALT;

That is what 120897 says*

23
Mr. Justice Stevens, but the Taylor v. Taylor Case that is
cited in the Tenth Circuit Opinion would indicate that
Oklahoma would say that it was commenced when the petition
was filed, or the complaint.

But to toll the statute of

limitations—QUESTION s

It was commenced at that time if service

was made within 60 days?
MR. GALT:

Yes.
Really, what I think Taylor says is

the case is commenced, for the purpose of commencing, let's
say, the word "commencing" means filing, the case was filed—
QUESTION:

That's not what the statute says.

The Oklahoma statute says, "shall be <2Seemed commenced upon

The Taylor Case—

Oklahoma?

QUESTION:

Is the Taylor Case a — I don't recall—

MR, GALTs

It is a State Case.

It is really a

State Court of Appeals case, but it seems to say that you
fila your case and that means commence with the connotation
of the word "file", and than a second step is required in
that Plaintiff must effect service to give the Court
jurisdiction within 60 days.

24
QUESTION;

The second step is required for what

to have occurred;, for the action to have been commenced?
MR. GALTs

Yes, to give the Court jurisdiction

to toll the statute of limitations.
QUESTION;

The statute of limitations says that

Does it say "file", or what does it say?

QUESTION;

Because I think that’s rather important

what the statute of limitations requires to toll the
statute.

If it required service of process, I wouldn’t

think there would be much of an argument.

But if it says

MR. GALT;

Our statute says you have two years

for bringing a personal injury action.

It has never come up.

We have talked

about 12 OS 97.
QUESTION;

Well, why wouldn't it come up, because

25
that's the question.

If the states said you only toll the

statute of limitations by painting the State Capitol red,
it wouldn't help you to commence the action in Federal
Court„
MR. GALT:

No.

QUESTION:

And if it says, if the statute of

limitations says the statute runs until you serve the
ccraplaing, is that what it says?
MR. GALT:

No, no.

I think it's best that we

supply that to the Court.

Court said

QUESTION:

Well, we've got it in the statute.

QUESTION:

Counsel, does it help any, the District

an action is commenced in State Court when

process issues, provided, process is actually served within
60 days.
MR. GALT:

I think that's 12 OS 97.

QUESTION:

I want to know what--

MR. GALT:

That I can't answer, Your Honor.

That is

correct.

It is the position of the Respondent that we
believe that Ragan and Hanna, in the vernacular of
6U; Diplomatic Corps, can peacefully co-exist.

.

I think

that Ragan looks to the State law to determine what it takes
to toll the statute of limitations while Hanna is a service
case dealing with what is necessary under the Federal Rules?

26

to effect actual service of process.
QUESTION:

What about page 3 of the Opinion of the

Tenth Circuit, in the Petition for Writ of Certiorari?

I

think it is probably A-3, where it cites Oklahoma statute
annotated Title 12, Section 97 , "An action shall be deemed
commenced within the meaning of this article”, and then
it goes on to say "intent to commence an action”? is that
the-MR. GALT:

That is not—-

QUESTION:

That is not a statute of limitations,

MR. GALT:

The Oklahoma Court has construed

97 to be an integral part of the actual statute that
created the Plaintiff's right in this case.
QUESTION:

Since we don't have the statute of

limitations before us, assume for a moment it provides
that it runs until ---- I mean, an action must be commenced,
what is your position as to the time, if ever, when the
action against your client was commenced?
MR, GALT:

The action against my client was

not commenced until we were served with summons sons 101
days after tha statute of limitations had run-—
QUESTION:

Again, if you had been served, say

35 days after the complaint was filed, you would say the
action was commenced on that 35th day? is that right?
MR. GALT:

I would think for the purposes of

27

filing my answer that I would calculate from the 35th day.
QUESTION s

In other words, your view is that the

action is commenced upon the date of service.

If that is

true, X fail to see any relevance whatsoever to the 60-day
Provision in the Oklahoma statute.

It is either commenced

when the complaint is filed, which the Federal Rule provides,
and you disagree with it

so does Ragan — or,

alternatively, it is commenced upon service, or attempt to
make service.

You say it is the latter and your opponent

says it * s the former.

So why do we have to look at the

60-day problem?
MR. GALTs

Because our Legislature in whatever

wisdom has said, "We are going to give you two years to file
a lawsuit and you must effect service within 60 days from
that date." And if you do not effect service within
26 months 5ram the date of the injury—
QUESTION 5

All that means is that your statute

of limitations, instead of being 24 months long is 26
months long, but you have still got to commence the action
within the 26 months.

served.

MS. GALTs

That83 correct.

QUESTION %

It is commenced for your purposes feeing

That is what you are arguing.
MR. GALTs

That's correct.

QUESTIONS

On the other hand, if commenced in a

28

Federal lawsuit means filing the complaint, we don’t have
to t^orry about the 60 days either»

1 just don't see how the

60 days affects the case.
MR. GALT;

Well, if this Court were to hold that

the mere filing of the complaint tolled the statute of
lira it at ions, then we are going to have different results
obtaining in the State Court ar,d a Federal Court.
QUESTION;

Mr. Galt, it is not a question of

tolling the statute of limitations? the action would have
been commenced within the statutory period, if that is an
adequate commencement of the action.
of tolling.

There is no question

The question is did they commence the action

before the statute ran.
MR. GALT;

I suppose the question is what does

the word "commence" mean?
QUESTION;

That is the issue.

MR. GALT;

Yes.

And Rule 3 does not say that

commencement ~
QUESTION;

Rule 3 is perfectly clear it says it

is commenced when you file a complaint.

But you just say

it doesn’t apply.
MR, GALT;

That’s correct.

QUESTION;

If you say Rule 3 doesn’t say that

commencing an action stops the statute of limitations, or
means that after that time, if it was filed within the
statuta of limitations, the statute of Imitations has no

29

more applicability.
MR. GALT;

I think that's what I am saying.

QUESTION;

I

wasn't too clear.

sm

not sure, the question certainly

What you are saying,, as 1 understand it,

is that the commencing of the action doesn't put the
statute of limitations out <pf the picture under Rule 3, even
though the action was commenced within the appropriate
statutory period?
MR. GALT;

That's correct.

QUESTION;

I understood in your response to on©

of the questions where you said that for purposes of filing
an answer> you would compute from, the date of service.

That

doesn't really answer the question as to when the action is
Commenced for me.
;

MR. GALT;
QUESTION:

Well—
I can see where, for purposes of

filing a responsive pleading, that you would compute from
the date of service, as distinguished from the date of
commencement of the action, if it relates back under
Oklahoma practice.

And somewhere in these briefs I have

the impression, isn't there a State Court holding that it
does relate back?
MR. GALT;

I don’t believe so, Mr, Justice Blackmun,

but. in doing the research and preparation for this argument,
it appeared to me that the drafters of the Rule, when they
looked at Rule 3, thought about putting a proviso in there

30
that filing the complaint would toll any statute of
limitations problem.

They thought better of it and did not

include that.
Some of the writers have said that the word
"commencement'' is in the Rules to have a figure to calculate
time from.

The only thing I can relate to in answer to the

Question is that the Oklahoma statute says that the
action is commenced when you are served and* for my purposes,
as a trial lawyer, defense lawyerf when an action is commenced,
it is commenced on me when I receive service, and that is
whe r< X start my preparation for a defense.
QUESTIONs

Conceivably, it might commence for

one purpose under the statute of limitations and another
purpose in terms of tolling your time, in determining your
time to respond.
MR. GALTs

Yes, sir.

QUESTION s

On the matter of supplying this

information, while it’s true we have the statutes available,
yot are both Oklahoma lawyers, you submit whatevaryou wish
to submit on it as promptly as possible.
QUESTION?

That section is Section 95, two sections

ahead of this.
MR. GALT:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

You perhaps can do that before you

leave the building

31
MR. GALT:

Yes, sir, we will.

Thank yon very much, Mr. Chief Justice.
Thank you for permitting me this opportunity.
QUESTION:

Thank you, gentlemen, the case is

submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:18 o'clock p.m. the case was
submitted.)
