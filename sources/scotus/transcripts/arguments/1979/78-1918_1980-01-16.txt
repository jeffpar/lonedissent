PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Ms. Walsh, you may

proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. MARYANN WALSH , ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MSo WALSH:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
This Court is quite familiar with the complexities
of fch© Clean Air Act.

la 1977 Congress substantially amended

the Act, including th© judicial review provisions of section
30? t;b) Cl).

That section now gives original jurisdiction—to

the Court of Appeals for the District Qf Columbia to review
t

the administrative actions under certain enumerated sections
of the Act and other final actions which have nationwide
application or effect.
The regional Courts of Appeal are given original
jurisdiction over other enumerated sections of the Act and
'any other final action of the Administrator under the Act"
of local or State-wide effect or application.
We contend, SPA does, that section 30 7 (b) CD means
exactly what it says, that the Courts of Appeal have original
jurisdiction to review all action, all final actions by the
Administrator taken under the Act.and to explain this
interpretation first —
QUESTION:

That is to the exclusion of District

4

Courts, your position is.
MSo WALSH:

Yes, Your Honor; right.

Except for

the provision under the citizens' supervision under section
304, right; yes.
QUESTION:

Does the legislative history ravaal

whether the authors of that amendment, all others, had any
idea of the scops of its impact?
MSo WALSH:

To some extent admittedly the legislative

history on section 307(b)(1) in
QUESTION:
MS. WALSH:

It isn't very helpful, is it?
It is not extremely helpful but it is

not unhelpful either, Your Honor.

It is obvious that Congress

was most concerned with and addressed the problem of allocating
M»n« between the Courts of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and
the regional Courts of Appeals.

Congress did indicata however

that they were placing reviaw of all rules and orders of
regional, Statewide or local application with the regional
Courts ©f Appeals.

And this was an expansion of th® juris­

diction under th© 1977 Amendments.
Another significant fact is that th® House bill that
th© House Report that this legislative history is in was address­
ing, at that point tha only amendment to what had been the
prior section 307(b) CD was the "any other final action"
language.

So the legislative history was addressing that

addition to section 307(b)(1).

5

Se limited as the legislative history is, it does
indicate that Congress was aware of an expansion of juris­
diction.
I would like to discuss the particular final action
involved in this case and then explain why our interpretation
is the most manageable, practical and efficient way of
interpreting section 307(b)(1).
In August 1971, the Administrator promulgated
proposed new source performance standards for stationary
soitrces, which included amission limitations for sulfur
dioxides.

The statute at that time

and it still does, as

amended defines new stationary sources to include sources
which were modified or constructed after the date of the
proposed regulations.

And stationary sources wore also defined

to include fossil fuel-fired steam generating plants such
as SPG has at its Lake Charles, Louisiana facility.
Now, in May 1975 33PA wrote PPG and asked that PPG
provide additional -- not additional, but provide information
as to the operation of its facility and what was included on
the possibility that the new source performance standards
might be applicable to the Louisiana facility.
In May and in June of that year PPG responded with
their interpretation of whether the new source performance
standards would apply or not.

They provided detailed diagrams

of their facility, purchase order as to when the different

6

parta of the facility» because only one section of the overall
facility, chemical manufacturing facility was particularly
involved,

Purchase orders for those parts of it.

In October of 1976 EPA concluded that th© new source
performance standards would be applicable to the facility be­
cause of the construction date, the date construction had
commenced after th© date of the proposed regulations.
PPG requested a reconsideration of that and
submitted additional material.

A meeting was later held be-

tween PPG officials and EPA representatives and EPA concluded
that its original determination was still in fact in effect.

In April of 1977 PPG, as permitted under EPA's
regulations,' formally asked for a "determination of construction"
and along with that "determination" request, which was
essentially a request for EPA to reconsider its prior
conclusion, PPG submitted a memorandum of law and a memorandum
of facts, once again setting out its interpretation.
Thera is no indication here

that PPG was ever

prevented from adding all of the material it wanted to to the
record.
*

nevertheless,

EPA determined in June of '77 that

its original conclusion still held, that despite further review
of the facility and the standards, that the standards
were applicable to PGG*s facility.
PPG subsequently filed a petition for review with' the

7

Fifth Circuit.

The Fifth Circuit at PPG's request dismissed

the petition for lack of jurisdiction under section 307(b){1).
Th© Fifth Circuit concluded that Congress could not have
intended to place review of final actions in the Courts of
Appeals where the action by the Administrator was based on
what it termed was a skeletal recjord, as in this case.
The Fifth Circuit was also apparently quite
influenced by the lack of discovery apparatus, the mechanical
limitations that were inherent in Courts of Appeals v.
District Courts.

And on that basis, the Fifth Circuit read

final action very narrowly.

They did not provide a criteria

for interpreting that phrase, however.
QUESTION:

Ms. Walsh, do you agree with the

characterisation of the Fifth Circuit that the record in this
ease was skeletal?
MS, WALSH:

No, Your Honor.

We believe that it was

sufficient for SPA to make the determination that was
involved.

Granted in comparison to administrative records

in ether cases where the issue involved, the legal issue and
th© factual matters arc much mores extensive, it was small as
compared to numerous boxes of material.
QUKSTXOH:

But it --

Isn't the real question though not

whether it was sufficient for EP& to make the determination
hut 'whether it was sufficient for the Fifth Circuit to determine
whether the 3P& had acted correctly?

8

MSo WALSH:
both ways.

Well, that analysis of the record goes

Was it substantively on the merits; was it

sufficient to uphold EPA's decision.
1 suppose is:

But the primary question

Was it — if record sizes are criteria or

jurisdiction or determination of jurisdiction, then that
would be the appropriate question.
We contend, however, that is not the criteria for
determining jurisdiction and on that basis it would not be
necessary to analyse the size or the quantity of the record.
QUESTION:

In your view, if the record is one which

is sufficient to satisfy the agency, is it automatically
sufficient for appellate review in the Court of Appeals?
Does it always follow that then it is suffici«2nt for the
r e v i a w i n g ao u r t ?
MS® WALSH:

Mot necessarily, in that if there is

a record,and the Administrator's decision must be based on a
record to be sustainable, certainly.

How, Congress has

provided that on petitions for review there will be a
sufficient record presented to the Courts of Appeal under
28 OoSoC. 2113.

That specifies what the agency must certify

to the Court of Appeals on a petition for review and that,
then, constitutes the reviewable record.

And that assures,

contrary to what the Fifth Circuit assumed in this instance,
that a reviewable record will always be presented to the
®a appellate court

9

How, if that standard can't be mat, if there is no
record to certify, than on that basis there would not be a
jurisdiction over that particular action.
QUESTION!

Let's assume that in a particular case

the agency considers the record adeqxjate but the Court of
Appeals asked to review it and concludes that it is inadequate,
just assume that.

I take it you would agree that could

happen?
MS, WALSH;
QUESTION:

Yes.
As it did here now.

Could the Court of

Appeals appoint a special master or a referee to take testimony
to fulfill the function that might have been fulfilled by a
District Court,

Is there any inherent power in a Court of

Appeals to do that?
MS. WALSH:

Wall, 1 believe that 1 would assum®

that option would be available to the Court of Appeals.

The

way to interpret the statute is that what is necessary to
supplement the record to determine whether the Administrator8s
action was sustainable or not would be remand to the agency
for supplementation or the other options that would be
available to the Court of Appeals which might in soss instances
be the appointment of a special master.
QUESTION:

It is an obvious alternative, isn’t

it?
MS. WALSH:

Yes

10

QUESTIONs
MSo WALSH:
QUESTION:

Always.
Yes, four Honor.
Yet one of your arguments is that you

want to speed up the process of review so people will know
what is expected of them under the EPA.

And if the Court

of Appeals remands to the agency, that certainly isn't going
to speed up the process.
MS» WALSH:

But what wa are concerned with is

speeding up ---• certainly speeding up the application and
determining the finality of the Administrator's actions.
And we are not saying that this is a way for it to

that

EPA gets by by making decisions on inadequate records,
certainly not.

But without having to -- without tying

jurisdiction — without tying jurisdiction to record size,
that hurdle, that initial hurdle of the analysis of the record
as the determiner of jurisdiction is removed.
Now, certainly that doesn't remove the necessity
to analyse the record on its substance under the judicial
review of the Administrator's actions as supported, by that
record.
QUESTION:

Well, 2 had read the Fifth Circuit's

opinion and its use of the word "skeletal" not as meaning that
It was less than 20 pages or less than 15 pages, but skeletal
in a sense that it was simply correspondence largely between
the private party and the EPA? and it was skeletal for purposes

11

of review.
MSo WALSH:

Well, on the basis that it --- certainly

there is that indication in the Fifth Circuit's opinion.
However, on the basis of what it termed a skeletal record

it

refused to take jurisdiction, determining that the skeletal
quality of the record is what prevented it under section
307(b)11} from taking jurisdiction which then, under the
Fifth Circuit's opinion and readisig the Fifth Circuit's
©pinion and reading what the Fifth Circuit did, means that
analysing the record and the skeletal or non-skeletal quality
of it is the basis on which jurisdiction must originally bo
determined under section 307(b)(1).
2 think the Fifth Circuit characterisation of the
record has to be recognised as first going to jurisdiction as
well as to the substance of the record.
The reason that we feel that section 307(b)(1) must
be determined. to place original and exclusive review over all
final actions in the Courts of Appeals is that, as I have
indicated, this is a final and definite way of determining
jurisdiction from the outset.

And this servas the purpose

not merely of EP&, and probably EPA is the last party it
serves, but most importantly it facilitates actions moving
through the courts

in the Courts of Appeals.

It does not

causa an inefficient waste of time in either the District
Court or the Courts of•Appeals.

It works to —

12

QUESTION:

Well, can I ask you a question about

the final -- 1 lust confess -- I know the parties don't argue
this, but I have some question about the finality of the June
0 letter itself.

Now, that is the final agency action that

is under™ review, the June 8, 19 77 letter.

That refers to the

fact that the agency .refuses to change the position it
expressed in its October 5, 1976 letter.
One thing 1 would like to know is whether you regard
the October 5, 1976 letter as also having been final agency
action.
MSo WALSH:

I would say that, yes, it would be —

it could have been considered final agency action, because
that, certainly is
QUESTION:

It is just as final as the June 8

letter was?
MS* WALSH:

Yes.

The reason why the June 8 is

characterised as final action, certainly for these purposes,
is that the October letter indicated that it was the agency's
final decision but I believe it also referred to the fact
that if PPG had any further questions or requested a -~
QUESTION:

Well, but it was still open to PPG after

the June 8 letter to ask further questions, because they had
further correspondence.

And on August 18 they got. still

another final agency action, didn’t they?

Don’t we have

three different letters, each of which has an equal claim to

13

finality, that is at the moment it was received?
MSo WALSH:

Yes, I believe so.

If PPG had made

no request or submitted a petition for review after receiving
the October letter, that would have constituted final agency
action that was reviswable.
How, EPA and PPG kept open the reconsideration of
the determination at that point, with PPG supplying further
information
QUESTION s

Couldn’t PPG today write another letter

and say, “We have got another idea, we will only use 90 percent
oil and 10 parcent gas," or something like this.

Would that

change the situation if you wrote back and said, "No, we
adhere to our October 5, 1S76 position."

Would that also be

a final action?
MS. WALSH:

In the sense that they could now file

another petition for review on that basis, no, because it
would b® the same — is the same determination that is
involved and we are already involved with a petition for
review on the particular ~~
QUESTION:

Does it effect, to file a petition for

review; is that the reason?
MS„ WALSH:

Yes, but there has been no change in

the particular agency action involved.
Now, under the -QUESTION:

But there was none bettfeen 5 77 and '76

14

either, was there?
MS. WALSH:

Mo, not between -- not between June and

the subsequent June letter which reaffirmed the October
decision.
By referring to the lator determination we give advantage
to PPG or to whatever affected the party.

Now, thore is a

provision in the section 307(b)(1) that I would like to
emphasise, and that is the publication.
QUESTION:
MSo WALSH:

All right.
Congress specifiad because of problems

that had previously been encountered in the Act as to what the
proper filing time was. Since there is a cut-off date as to
when that filing can be made, that the Administrator was to
publish in the Federal Register notice of the publications,
actions, determinations and that the time to file a petition
for review would start 60 days from that notice.

Now there

— and as EPA recognises in this case there was no Federal
Register publication, EPA's policy as they have reiterated now
is to publish ail the determinations.
The only problem! is that it goes to how long the
affected party has available to seek a petition for review.
In this instance the situation — the effect was that it worked
to the advantage of PPG.

In other words, that 60-day time

period naver never started running.
QUESTION:

Would the October 5 determination -- say

15

there had been a criminal proceeding or something like that
late-r on and If there is a failure to seek review of a final
action vrhich is subject to review in the Court of Appeals,
as I remember the statute, you cannot attack the determination.
If there were no publication in the Federal Register and no
review sought from the October 5, '76 proceeding and sometime
in October or November you start a criminal proceeding®
0©uld

they have attacked the action in such a proceeding?
MS„ WALSH:

Yes, they could have, because there

was -- the opportunity for review remains open if that Federal
notice

has never bean published.
Now, an enforcement action is brought, we would

contend that the appropriate -- the circumstances, the
scenario at that point would be to file a

file a petition for review of the Administrator's action under
307(b)(1).

And that probably the enforcement proceeding

should be held in abeyance pending that determination.

But

excuse me, (b)(2) does

not go into effect because the opportunity to challenge it
still remains open.

That is why EPA is making efforts t© see

that all of its final actions will foe published in the Federal
Register.

QUESTION:
MS, WALSH:

Unless we change our mind.
What you are saying is the agency does

not lose jurisdiction after it has taken a purported final
siction and an appeal has been filed in the Court of Appeals,
:;nlike a District Court, for example, would have lost juris-

18

diction and could not, except by leave of the Court of Appeals,
modify findings or a decree.
MSo WALSH:

But you say --

That's right.

QUESTION -- say the agency does not lose jurisdiction
even after it has pronounced a final action in the cases in
the Court of Appeals.
MS o WALSH:

Yes, Your Honor.

it as purported final action.

I wouldn’t characterise

It is a final determination.

Certainly, as this case represents, there has been no
determination of the applicability of the new source performance
standards, to my knowledge, for the other emission category
such as the nitrogen oxides.,

and a final action by EPA or

a decision that those regulations apply to the PPG facility.
QUESTION:

Well, in your brief you concede that

under our former cases even if the action of the EPA is final
action and therefore subject to appellate review, it may not
be ripe for appellate review✓

Do I read your footnote

correctly?
MS o WALSH:

Yes, Your Honor? right.

In other words,
QUESTION:

Then if they remand it, if the Court of

Appeals would simply 3ay this is not ripe for judicial review,,
appellate review, then that would be subject presumably to
examination here to see whether we agreed that it was not ripe .
Is that so?

19

MS0 WALSH:

That would he subject to examination

here or the Court of Appeals would have the option of remanding
to the agency for completion of the administrative proceedings
or further administrative hearings, whatever is involved.
The critical factor and the issue we are directed
at today is that the rightness or the substantiality of the
record, of supporting the Administrator’s record -- decision,
rather, does not go to determining jurisdiction under 307 Cb) (1) ,
the language of 307(b)(1) that the indication and the intent
of Congress is that jurisdiction be a definite concept.

And

the way to make it a definite concept consistent with reading
the statute is to make exactly what this section says, to make
all final actions reviewable in the Courts of Appeal.
QUESTION:

I suppose if the Court of Appeals

had said in this cases,

"This is not ripe for review," EPA

could then have proceeded to expand the record.

But in this

ease, you were not in a position to expand the record because
they said there was no need for it.
MS e WALSH:
was not

Wo, they said that it -- they said if

they had no j ur-isdiction, because it was not — it

of Appeals was really irrelevant because neither the Court
of Appeals nor the District Court had that option available
to thorn whan reviewing the administrative record.
Therefore the most efficient way to interpret
section 397(b)(1) and the way that is consistant with the
integrity of the statute, the statutory language,is to read
it. as definite earmark or determination of jurisdiction in the
Courts of Appeals.
I reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Lettow.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES Fc LETTOW, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MRo LETTOW:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We disagree directly on the construction given

/

the other final action catch phrases at the and of those two

sentences,

at the beginning of section 307(b)(1).

But every

21

once in a while one of the old Latin statutory construction
phrases makes sense when applied in a modern context to the
Federal statute or construction problems.
We think this is a classic case, actually, for appli­
cation. of the doctrine of statutory_construction ejusdem generi
to construe the catch phrase at the end of a statutory
series like those that are similar to it in the enumeration
that proceeds it.
But the key thing I think the Court has to remember
in focusing on this case is that the agency is arguing for
original, exclusive and preclusive jurisdiction in the Court
of Appeals that section 307(b)(2) bars anybody from raising
an issue in the enforcement proceedings or anything that would
come along subsequently, if that .issue could have been raised
under a direct review action under section 307(b)(1).
Mow, I recognise that in this particular case the
briefing might not be especially helpful, at .least the opening
brief of EPA ia cryptic.

Otir responsive brief and EPA' s

reply are really where the arguments are found.
In addition to the problems of just discussing the
type of action that took place in this case, whether it is
final, we believe that EPA has misread seriously three
statutory provisions, as well as our position in the case.
What I would like to do is take a few minutes at
the outset and summarise our arguments and .position and perhaps

22

support the case in the context and then focus on the detailed
points.
I remind the Court that Congress established the
special judicial review provisions in 1970.

It mandated at

that time review in the Courts of Appeals for certain
specifically enumerated actions.

Other actions were

definitely at that time reviewed in District Courts under
the generally applicable Federal question jurisdictional
grant and then the Administrative Procedure Act.
actions

Those other

or

the actions that were brought in District Court
*
included uetions to review the application of the new source
standards,

i'n fact the application of the new source

standards at issue i:i this particular case.

There were a

series of District Court actions that too3i place between
1970 and 1977 on these precise types of matters.
In 1977, however, Congress added a number of further
specific sections to the listing that was in section 307
and it added those other final action catch words at the end
of the two sentences.
Now, SPA’s arguments are based on the broadest
conceivable reading of those other final action catch words.
They are so broad that they would male© the specific listing
that precedes it redundant and useless.

The words "special

enumeration" might as well not be there at all.
You can construe the other final catch words in

light of the enumeration, however, because that specified
list of actions, both in the first sentence and in the second
one, deal with a consistent class of actions.

Those actions,

if you look at them and analyze them in detail, all are either
ruling actions or they are adjudications where SPA has to act
on the basis of an opportunity for a hearing to the affected
party.

And that opportunity for a hearing brings into play

the formal adjudication provisions of section 554 of the APA
and it insures that the Court of Appeals has a record
available to it for review.

And accordingly, and make no

mistake about it, our position on jurisdiction is in no way
unclear.

In short, and I would like to reiterate it again,

say that a ejusdem generic Construction of the other
final action catchwords would include either EPA action which
is rule-making or adjudication where the statute on its face
provides an opportunity for a hearing, bringing into play
section 554 of the Administrative Procedure Act.
We recognize -- the rule-making, by the way, would
either have to be subject to section 553 of the Administrative
Procedure Act or to the further provisions that actually in
the Clean Air Act in section 307(d) that displace the
Administrative Procedure Act’s provisions and are more
stringent in certain respects, especially insofar as keeping
a -docket' and' making a record.
Now, we recognize that ejusdem generis construction

24

construction of the other final action catch words would not
include the section 112 reference in listing in the second
sentence because section 112, while it refers to hazardous
substances, does not call for an opportunity for a hearing on
the part of the private party.
Section 112 however deals with three different kinds
of actions.

It deals with an approval by EPA, actually EPA,

not a State, of an application or a notice for permission to
either build or modify a plant that emits hazardous pollutants.
In the second part it deals with violations of
hazardous pollutants.
And in the third part it deals with waivers from
that hazardous pollutant standard.
Section 11.2(c) does require in each of these three
instances that SPA make statutorily defined findings before
it takes its action.
Accordingly, we believe that section 112 (c)'s
provisions can be taken into account in a ejusdem generis
construction of these other final action catch words if the
Court wants to, because it could add to the categories of
adjudication which are covered by those catch words those
actions which are taken by EPA

where the statute expressly

requires that certain determinations or factual findings to
be made in support of its action.
We don't think, and the reason we don't put that

25

forward as a favored

construction of the statute is that

section 112(c) is an exceptional provision in the statute.
This Court has had the Adama Wrecking case before it, it knows
that the Act has special provisions for enforcement as well
as judicial review for hazardous pollutants and we think that
section 112(c) is an exception and you don’t need to include
it within this usdaia generis cla33.
But either way, whether the Court would adopt the
optional construction or not,you wouldn’t have reached the
action in the present case because here you don't have the
requirement at all stated in the statute that EPA make these
types of final determinations.
We do agree with EPA that it is a final determina­
tion.

PPG was in the process of building that plant.

It was

just about built at the time this all started and, indeed, it
had to know whether or not those standards in the fossil fuelfired generating unit requirements that EPA had put forward
were applicable or not.

It had to govern its conduct by them

as it operated this particular plant.
We do think in construing the statuta that the
Court should be particularly concerned about EPA's most
expansive reading, because it would really have a strong
adverse affect on judicial administration.
You heavily burden the Courts of Appeals with
review of actions by EPA that were taken outside the administra-

26

fcive record.
As Professor Currie points out,anytime you have
an adjudication that does not take place under section 554
the agency can go outside the administrative record and grasp
grounds for its decision.
QUESTION:

Well, your alternative would burden the

District Courts rather than the Courts of Appeals.
MR, LETTOW:

No, it.wouldn't necessarily, Justice

Jiehnquist, for two reasons.
The first is that you are going to have many more
petitions for review filed in the Courts of Appeal under this
reading than you are any other reading of the statute.
that is because of the review preclusion provisions.

And
You are

going to have people who realise that they only have one
chance to get review.

Unless they carry forward any possible

claim they might have within the 60-day time period,they lose,
under the Yakus case,the right to review those issues entirely.
You have got to remember *—
QUESTION:

Why wouldn't that be equally true with

respect to the District Courts?
MRo LETTOW:

Because if you were in the District

Court you would be outside the roach of section 307(b)(1)
and section 307(b)(1) in the judicial review provisions an
section 307(b)(2) in the review preclusion provisions have a
juxtaposed scope.

The preclusion provisions get carried along

27
or drug along by the coverage of the judicial provisions»
So if you were in District Court you wouldn't be under the
special review provisions at all.
QUESTION:
MR» LETTOW:

I see.
And the saoond reason, though, as

this Court has pointed out in the Overton Parle case, a
District Court can use discovery means, it has those procedures
available to prove out tho non-record aspect of the agency
action.

It can use them.

It doesn’t have to use discovery

in aid of a trial of da novo facts but it uses the discovery
to prove out the basis for the agency's action.
QUESTIONs

But under the Government's reading of

the statute where it concedes the Court of Appeals can remand,
couldn't the Court of Appeals remand for similar supplementation
of the agency record?
MR. LETTOK:

Your Honor, it could but as Justice

Marshall's opinion in the Overton Park case where the Court
points out,

I think it is at page 420,

anytime you remand

to the agency, when you have got a circumstance like that,
you are going to risk post hoc rationalisation and the
opinion in the Overton Park case warns that you don't give
deference, or the Court doesn't give deference to what results
*

from the remand,because of that danger.

Now, the Fifth

Circuit was acutely aware of that.
QUESTION:

Didn’t the opinion leave open the right

*

of a District Court to send it back?
MRo LETTOW:
yes.

Yes, it did; it definitely did that,

You warned that that might ba a consequence of it.
QUESTION:

MR, LETTOW:

Yes.

But in any event what w@ are, saying is the Fifth
Circuit was acutely aware of this because it had had a case
called Save The Bay -QUESTION;

What is wrong with a little post

I thought we remanded sometimes because

somebody hadn’t rationalised enough.
MR, LETTOWi
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, we tried -We send them back and say, "Look, it is

fine if you want to reach this result if you just give some
reasons.

You didn't give enough reasons ,

Nov; give some."

And they have post-rationalised and send it back.
MR, LETTOW:

We would have liked to have had some

readings for the application of the new source standards in
this particular case that focus on the particular requirements thj
fere placed on the waste heat

boilers, because as the court knon-

from looking at the briefs and the record, these are not your
standard every-day boilers.

They fit in the midst of a

cogeneration system there the actual air feed to the boilers
come is the turbine exhaust gas.

You cannot measure, aa a

consequence, the pollutants in the exhaust, if you will, from

29

the waste heat boilers and get the numbers where the pollutant
parameters are actually specified in EPA’s new source
standards, because you have a combination of the pollutants
from the supplemental fuel there along with those from the
turbines, which are completely separate and apart.

And EPA

as a consequence couldn't directly apply the new source
standards in this case.
One of our problems has alvzays been that it applied
special ad hoc requirements that we say are not specified in
the statute and, indeed, at that time were not authorised.
But we never have really gotten to that claim.
on the particular difference between

We are focused

a wa8te heat boiler -an

a cogeneration system and a regular boiler, because we have
been arguing about, among other things, jurisdiction and
review.
QUESTION:

Well, if you weren't you might have gotten

to it.
MRo LETTCW:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon, Your Honor?
You night have gotten to the merits if

you weren't fighting about jurisdiction.
i*>Ri LETTOW:

Well, at the time we filed, and this

goes back to the timing of the particular letters where you
.save -eo realise that we had a letter on August 3 that basically
3aid the requirements applied only at the time we were operating
0j-

^was operating those boilers with 100-percent fossil

30

fuel, no input from the -- or no waste heat from the turbines
at all.
And then the Clean Air Act was actually passed or
enacted by the President's signature on August 7.

Then we gat

the letter of August 18 that says we were wrong on.August 3,
what vie are really going to do is apply the new source standard
and we are going to apply the specific ad hoc requirements
without necessarily any statement or reasons by the -QUESTION:

Even the Government perhaps have different

views of what the universe of reviewable matters would contain.
I suppose you might have a different view if 99.9 percent of
the final judgments really would have an adequate record.

I

take it yon think that an awful lot of them wouldn't have an
adequate record.
MRo LETTOW;

No, Your Honor, I wouldn't think so.

1 think there are a lot of informal actions that EPA takes that

We11, I know a lot of them, but I take it

you must think that an awful lot of them wouldn't have enough.
MR„ LETTOWs

In this particular case the agency

could have had an adequate record for review.

In fact, folio-

is.g along with a question that Justice Stevens asked earlier,
after we got the August 18 letter we went back to the agency
and had a meeting at -mich we tried to discuss the particular
ad hoc requirements that were imposed that weren’t set out la

31

the standard-

And we did not get any resolution of thatj

there ware no letters written, there was no correspondence
at all that is reflected in the administrative record in this
particulas case.
If we would have gotten a series of, again, amendment
if you will, to the final order to take those further matters
into account, then I think we would have come closer to having
an adequate record for review.
But that was in part why

especially the Court of

Appeals said, "We don’t know why they chose these particular
requirements, it is a skeletal record insofar as that is
concerned.*
QUESTION:

Sc you think that if EPA really does its

work they probably can have an adequate record in almost any
case?
MR0 LETTOWj
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Even if it is informal adjudication.

So we should let the possibility of an inadequate
record,just because of ineptness send all these cases to the
District Court?
MRo LETTOWj

No, Your Honor.

Justice White, that is

why we put forward very carefully a bright line ejusdem generis
construction of those catch words at the end of the statute.
This problem didn’t arise prior to the 1977 Amendments,
because you had Court of Appeals exclusive and preclusive

32

jurisdiction limited to specific enumerated actions.

And as

1 said, those actions were the rule-making or they v/ere
adjudication where the agency on the statute had a responsi­
bility to provide the affected party with an opportunity for
hearing unless you brought section 554 of the AFA into
play.
And it is only when you get these unclear and
ambiguous words on a final action that you have a problem.
And we think those words are ambiguous only standing alone,
because if you take the contest of the sections, section.
307(b)(1), and what happened in 1970 in particular, when
Congress put that in place, because Congress at that time
put it in place with a careful recognition that it was apply­
ing the special review listing only to actions which would
have an adequate record for review in the Courts of Appeals.
With the action that it actually took in 1977, you do not
get the very broadest possible reading that EP&, has put
forward.

Instead you gat

®jusdam generic construction.

That

is the other final action really means things that are like
the things that are in the listing, not anything.
QUESTION:

You don't think the special review

proceeding depends on -— going to the Court of Appeals depends
on an ad hoc evaluation of the record but that the likelihood
of a skeletal record is why you apply the ejusdam generic
construction.

33

MR. LETTOW:

Precisely.

That is precisely — we

agree with the agency completely.
QUESTION;

The likelihood of somebody having made a

mistake.
MR. LETTOW:

Well, we

Justice White, we agree

with the agency completely, the union of bright line juris­
dictional rule, you mean something that you can tell on the
face of the statute before you even go into one of these
proceedings whether or not you are going to be subject to
at the end, exclusive and preclusive review in the Courts of
Appeals or whether you are not, and you can raise defenses
in enforcement cases or go to the District Court for review
if you want to.
QUESTION;

Wall, if you predicted only about one

out of a thousand final actions might have an insufficient
record because somebody made a mistake, it certainly isn’t
much of an argument.for your construction.
MRo LETTOW:

But Justice White, the application of

EPA's rule would mean that you would have everything from, oh,
I think of EPA’s decision to black list a company from Federal
contracts, it is informal adjudication; it doesn’t have a
record attached to it.

You could have -- 1 suppose if EPA

ever gets to the point where it puts up auto inspection
stations in those States that won’t do it themselves for
emission requirements. individual cars going through that auto

34

inspection station, that would be a final action by the
agency, certainly insofar as that particular car is concerned.
QUESTION:

I want to be sure I understand what

you think the phrase "any other final action" in the present
307(b)(1) means.

You say ejusdem generis.

It means actions

similar to those which are specifically enumerated?
MR. LETTOW:

Yes, that is precisely right.

Bat that

isn’t the criteria V-ren for bringing section 554 in play,
it is just providing an opportunity for a public hearing.
Asad, indeed, 554 as fch® Court well knows provides summary
judgment opportunities in the administrative contest and other
things, too.'
But it is the fact that; the- statute provides as
opportunity for a hearing that distinguishes it.
119 is precisely the

same.

Section

It provides after notice and a

In other words,

you get an opportunity for a hearing under s@ct.ion 119 as
well.

Sad we think the agency's putting forward this

grant denied dichotomy is a mis-reading ©f the statute,

and

that those two sections do fit within this general plan.
Mci as a matter of fact Courts of appeals have actually made
such construction.

They have used this ejusdem generis idea.

But fro® the reverse vantage point, they have construed the
substantive 'provisions that are actually listed in the special
judicial review provision is light of the record desired for
Court ©£ appeals review.
an example — and it is sot cited in our brief -- is
the Marathon Oil case at SS4 F.2ad 1253.

la that case the

Court had before it the question of whether the hearing required
for a Clean Water Act discharge permit was a formal adjudicatory

l. . ?

: ■
f

MR. hlSTTQW-

V;| :

That is precisely right.

And in fact

the Marathos Oil ease; is on® of them, because. in. that case
the Court construed the reference, the substantive provisions
reference listing in th® special judicial .review provisions
to- have some. impact oa what those actual requirements ware
for that particular substantive statute.

And the Court

paid, actually quoted from the Attorney General’s manual on
the &PA

or

the subject.

The Attorney General’s manual had

39

said that a requirement that administrative deciaiooa beyond
the record can be clearly implied in the provision for judicial
review in the Circuit Courts of Appeal.

'Shat was where

the actual statute called for a hearing but didn’t say whether
you had on the record such that you would also bring 554 into
play.
And decisions that are consistent with Marathon
Oil are the-U.S. Steel case in the seventh Circuit and the
First Circuit Seacost Anti-pollution League Case, those are
at 556 F. 24' and 572 F. 2d respectively.

So the courts have

used this ejusdem generis idea but they hav© used it frets a
reverse vantage point.
There is one final thing 7. would particularly like
to cover and that is SPA’s bread construction would actually
introduce an internal conflict into section 307 itself.

As

The Court knows, in the first section of section 307 the
Courts of Appeals are reviewing, among other things, and if
says that SPA’s action in promulgating any standard under
section 202 of the Act, but then right away a parenthetical
clause appears, other than a standard required to be prescribed
under section 202{b)CD of the Act, this section deals with
auto emission standards.

SPA’s broad reading of the catch

phrase in the sentence would actually draw back into the
ambit of Court of Appeals review that iters which is specifically
excluded by the parenthetical exemption.

40

S2& argues ia its reply brief that section 202(h)(1)
o£ the parenthetically exempted part of the statuto doesn't
call os the agency to take any action which is reviewable in
aay court.»

i’lmk is wrong» and that is wrong for the re&ons

that are stated in Professor Currie's report to the administra**
tive conference which actually produced the recommendations
that went to Congress and formed the basis for the 19??

Amendments.
As Professor Currie pointed out» section 262 does
require or does have in it particular provisions which call
for numbers xa the auto pollution standards.

Pilose numbers»

f.o.jr ©sample* are things like 1.5 grass for a vehicle nils
hydrocarbons:,.

But in every case the statute says that EPA

standards say sot exceed that level.
standards cah be more stringent.

In other words* spa

And as Professor Currie

paints out. la his report.» which is in the Iowa Law Review
reprinted there» you have to have court of review or you have
•co have the opportunity for court review whether or sot EPA
properly exercised its power to make the standards more

First of all* aa we discussed in our reply

that there will be aa opportunity for a hearing and a hearing

The Administrative Procedure Act in
