MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We v.y.il 1 hear arguments

first this morning in Q’Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center,
78-1318.
Mr. Watkins, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN J. WATKINS , ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WATKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Skilled nursing home services sr.e publicly funded
under both Title 18 and Title 19 of the Social Security Act.
V

Title 18, commonly referred to as-^Med-idare, sets forth the
standards and conditions which skilled nursing homes must meet
whether or not they participate in Title 18 or Title 19.
standards are set forth in Title 18.

The

Title 18» Medicare, is

primarily administered by the Federal Government, Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare.

Title 19, on the other

hand, is primarily administered by the states that participate
i

in Medicaid.
In this case, Pennsylvania’s Department of Health
is the responsible agency for determining whether or not
Title 18 and Title 19 providers of skilled nursing care meet
the conditions and standards which the statute and regulations
require of nursing homes.

The federal role in this process is

basically one of oversight; however, with respect to Title 13

5

providers in particular, the Federal Government retains and
often exercises the independent authority to survey the facil­
ities and make an independent judgment as to whether or not
they meet the requirements established by Congress.
The survey function is performed annually and
generally involves a survey by professionals in the field to
determine whether or not the facility meets all of the very
specific conditions of participation in the program.
Town Court,, the respondent facility in this case, is
a dual provider; that is, a participant in both Title 18 and
Title 19.

As such, th© facility had dual responsibilities to

both the Federal Government and the State of Pennsylvania.
Since 196? Town Court has participated in this role and has had
a checkered history with respect to compliance with the statu­
tory requirements.

/

From 1967 to 5?3, the lower court acknowledged that
Town Court’s participation in the program was basically con­
ditioned upon a number of plans of corrections that have been
accepted by th© governments to allow them to participate,

in

j.
■

1974 the State of Pennsylvania determined that Town Court was
so substantially out of compliance that it recommended that idle
facility b© terminated, and it was.
It was readmitted after successive applications in
1976? however, later that year a grand jury was impaneled and
returned indictments against the facility and its management

6
with respect to care»

That prompted the Federal Government to

conduct an independent survey of the facility,, whereupon HEW
found substantial non -comp 1 i arse ® with the statutory require­
ments and requested Pennsylvania to conduct its own survey of
the facility, which was performed.

After successive confer­

ences and negotiations and, indeed, surveys of the facility,
Pennsylvania, ultimately recommended to the Secretary of HEW
that the facility be terminated.

- *-V

'

Effective June 20, 1977, the facility was terminated,
having been given 30 days prior notice by both the United
States and the State of Pennsylvania.

Indeed, seven major

conditions prompted the action by the governments.

These con­

ditions are set forth in the appendix at page 295A, and th©
statutory references are included there.

But they run the

gamut from medical services to administrative responsibility
being taken by the facility.
Town Court is provided with a serias of administra­
tive reviews post-termination, which it began to exercise after
th® action by the governments.

However, before those proce­

dures could be exhausted, this action was instituted.

Town

Court joined by six individual residents of the facility sued!
both th© Secretary of HEW and th© Secretary of the Pennsylvania
Department of Public Welfare, charging that it was a violation
of its, the facility’s, du@ process rights and its patients5
due process rights for th© facility to be terminated without

7
prior notic® and hearing; indesd without a prior evidentiary
hearing be provided to the facility and independently to the
patients.
After several hearings the District Court ruled
against Town Court and against the patients,, finding that the
statutory procedures were sufficient for the facility and that
the patients were entitled to

no

pre-termination hearings.

The patients and the facility appeal®!.

The Secretary of HEW

cross-appealed because the District Court also ordered that
the governments continue to make Medicare and Medicaid pay­
ments to Town Court.
QUESTION

%

And your client's predecessor did not

appeal?
MR. WATKINS;

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

The view taken by my client5s predecessor was, with respect
to the funding order, which was the only adverse order, that
our fate rested with the Federal Government.

If the Federal

Government was successful on its appeal, rightly or wrongly,
ray client's predecessor assumed that its obligation would also
fall by the wayside.

The Court of Appeals specifically took

issue with that and that's a question, I think, that is really
not pertinent to the merits.
QUESTIONs

On the merits --

But if is a question that remains here,

as to whether or not w® have jurisdiction of your petition?
MR. WATKINS;

That's correct.

We have addressed that

8

question in our reply brief * the Solicitor General has ad­
dressed it in both his reply and opening briefs, and briefly,
it's cur position that the arguments which are being advances
her® on the merits were advanced properly to the Court of Ap­
peals, were decided by the Court of Appeals? indeed, the Court
of Appeals took the position that it was deciding the cas® on
behalf or against both Pennsylvania and the United States»
Pennsylvania as an appellee in the Court of Appeals
on the issue of primary importance is clearly, under our view,
entitled to seek review of an adverse ruling which she suffered
in the Court of Appeals in this Court»
QUESTIONs

And the ruling of the Court of Appeals was

in favor of the government, wasn't it, of the United States?
MR. WATKINS:

Well, it's a little confusing.

The

ruling on the merits was against both th© United States and
Pennsylvania, basically holding that the patients had a due
process right.

It would seem to follow then that th© funding

order would have to be reversed, but my reading of the opinion
indicates that th® funding order was not reversed, and I think
it's somewhat inconsistent.
QUESTION:

W© pointed that out.

But the United States is a respondent in

this court?
MR» WATKINS:

Technically, th® United States is a

respondent; however, they have filed briefs in support of th®
position of th© petitioner.

9
QUESTION:

How about Town Court?

Did the Court of

Appeals grant the institution any rights?
MR. WATKINS:

No* Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc.

The Court

of Appeals followed the precedents in that area and decided
that Town Court had sufficient protections post-review that
wer® granted by the statute.
QUESTION:

AM Town Court didn?t petition this Court

for certiorari?
MR. WATKINS:
QUESTION:

Town Court did not seek certiorari.

So Town Court is not here?

MR. WATKINS:

Town Court is here technically as a

respondent* I would assume* inasmuch as they were a party in
the Court of Appeals.

But they ar® not here seeking any relief

The Court ©f Appeals addressed the cross appeals and
issued two en banc decisions.
/*>

QUESTION:

Just on th© Town Court point* they have

not filed anything at all* have they?
MR. WATKINS:

That5s correct.

They have filed

nothing.
QUESTION:

How about in the Court of Appeals?

Did

they take a position with respect to whether or not the
patients have standing?
MR. WATKINS:

Yes* they took a position in support

of th® patients* but th© primary thrust of their assertion*
and they war© independently represented* was that Town Court

10
itself had this right.

Thus if they were successful, the

patientse interests were really of no consequence to them.

But

they did not seek review of the adverse ruling that they suf­
fered in the Court of Appeals.
The Court of Appeals issued two ©pinions, first as I
mentioned, ruling that Town Court was adequately protected by
the procedures set forth in the statute and regulations.

The

second, departing, in my view, from at least two ether circuit
courts, held that the patients, contrary to the facility, were
entitled to pre-termination — and whan I refer to termina­
tion, I mean termination of the facility — pre-termination
evidentiary hearing.
The court9s rationale is not found in the opinion but
rather in a companion case decided the same say, Klein v.
Califano.

In that opinion, the ^fourt recognized, indeed

acknowledged and conceded, that Title 19 does not specifically
guarantee ~ ©r Title 18, for that matter — does not spe­
cifically guarantee any rights to the patients, or indeed any
role for the patients in the determination of whether or not
a particular nursing horaa provider is qualified under the
program.

However, the court looked to three distinet provi­

sions and inferred from those provisions that as a matter of
policy and in view of the grave consequences that it perceived
in the decision to terminat® that the statute should b@ con­
strued s© as t© protect this, quote, “property interest,®

11
unquote.
Further articulation of this position was given by
Judge Adams in his concurring opinion which may well be, as the
Solicitor General points out, the majority opinion in this case
because it was joined in by two members of the majority.

But

Judge Adams further expounded on this and noted that because
of the prevalence of social welfare programs in today's
society and because of these provisions in the statute, which I
will get to, h® perceived a landscape with three distinct
points on it that created a property interest, indeed, quote,
"a new typ® of property interest,” unquote, that w@ all should
b® alert to.
With these rationales in hand th® Court of Appeals
then determined that the patients were indeed entitled to a
pre-termination evidentiary hearing.

As we point out, each of

these provisions lias no bearing whatsoever on th® question and
providas no basis for th® ruling.

Th© fact of'the matter is

that the recipients of skilled nursing horn© car© are only en­
titled t© ree©iv® skilled nursing horae car® from a qualified
skill®! nursing home.

Indeed, if a nursing horn® does not

meet the conditions of ' participation, it9s not a skilled
nursing home under Title 19 and 18.
Th© Court of Appeals overlooked this and found that
th© freedom-of choice provision and th© transfer limitations
all created aa aura of property.

W© submit that it is not for

12
the judiciary to lightly overlook the clear intent of Congress
that the relationships between the patients and the government
and the contractors and the government be distinct.

The r®la-

tionsbip between the contractor and the government is on© which
is specifically detailed in th© statute arid does not encompass
any rcl© whatsoever for th© patients in determining the eli­
gibility of the contractor.
Similarly* the contractor has no rol© in determining
th© eligibility of the patients, and that is the way Congress
envisioned it.

As Judge Friendly said, common sense suggests

that there must b© some floor below which no hearing of any
sort is required, and I suggest that th® Court of Appeals has
dipped below that floor in failing to recognize that th® en­
tire thrust of Title 19 depends upon th© qualifications of
both th® provider and the recipient, and her© the Court of
Appeals is granting a recipient a role in determining th®
qualifications of a provider, which Congress never envisioned.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. ALLEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ALLENs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
Mr. Watkins has discussed ’the scop® of th© Medicaid
statutas and regulations, and we &gr@© with that discussion, as

13
©ur briefs reflect.
I would like this morning, if I may, to focus not so
much on th© statutes and regulations as ©a the constitutional
principles that the decision ©f the Court of Appeals seeras to
reflect, because although itBs not entirely clear from the
court's various opinions, its ; decision in this case sesias t©
be based not so much on a misreading of what the statutes and
regulations provide as upon what we eontend is a basic mis!

understanding of what th® Constitution requires.
QUESTION:

Mr. Allen, before you get into that, I

notice in your reply brief, page 7, the statement, KHEW intends
to institute rulemaking with respect to patient participation."
How does that matter stand?
MR. ALLEN:

My understanding is, Mr. Justice Brennan,

that it is still under active consideration, and. when I last
checked, which ms last weak, they still intend to institute
rulemaking.

Exactly when is something I can't say.

QUESTION:

But if they diS\ and provide for patient

participation, might we hav© a situation where w@ don’t have to
<

reach a constitutional -MR. ALLEN:

Well, wa can only speculate as to what

the rulemaker would provide with respect to typ© of patient
participation in this case.

As w® stated in our reply brief,

we believe that the constitutional issues &r@ very important
because w@ think a rulemaker should b© free to consider th®

14
various policy consid©rations on both sides, free from a judi­
cial decree based on an erroneous view of its constitutional
obligation,
QUESTIONS

Has HEW fixed any timetable?

MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Not as yet.
Would this be a protracted proceeding?

MR. ALLEN?

It would be in my view unlikely to b®

completed before this Court reached a decision on the question.
That's my speculation.
QUESTION %

A matter of months, you mean?

MR. ALLEN;

Months, I would say.

It would be an ex­

tended notice in comment rulemaking, with whatever judicial re­
view follow®! from it.
QUESTIONS
MR. ALLEN:

You mean months after it began, or -—
Well, I'm only speculating, but this is
r

a question of considerable importance.

It would concern the

interests of nursing hornas throughout the Nation.

I presume

that there would h© substantial comments ©n whatever notice of
proposed rulemaking went out.

Th® agency would have t© digest

these, the arguments, finally the agency would case out with a
proposed rule, and in my experience these things are not don®
in two months ©r so.
QUESTION?
MR. ALLEN %
QUESTIONs

AM it hasn't begun y©t?
It has not.
You really wouldn’t want to speculate that

15
it would fe@ completed before the and of this present term of
fch© Court, would you?
MR. ALIEN:
Your Honor.

I really — my guess is as good as yours.

My guess is that ifc6s doubtful.

QUESTION:

And of course, Mr. Allen, neither you cor

anybody ®ls© knows what the rule may turn out to be.
MR. ALLEN;

That’s correct? that's correct.

Despite the considerable complexities of the Medi­
caid and Medicare statutas and regulations* fch© significant
facts in this eas© ar® fairly simpla»

Th« statute provides

eligible patients with a right to recall?a certain kinds ©£
medical care frcsa qualified providers like nursing homes, that
is, providers that the Secretary of HE?? or appropriate state
officials have determined meet the statutory standards &isd re­
quirements.

If a home is found to be qualified, HEM or the

appropriate state agency enters into an agreement with the
home a ad the agencies, those agencies directly pay the home
for servic®® that the horn® provides to eligible patients.

In this case, HEM determined that Town Court Nursing
Center was not a qualified provider within the meaning of the
statute, and accordingly petitioner's predecessor attempted to
terminate the home's participation, terminat® fch® homo's
Medicaid agreement with petitioner's predecessor as HEW regu­
lations required him to do.
The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the decision

16
to terminate the horn© weald not affest the rights of any patient
to receive qualified care under the statute from any other home
/

found to be qualified.
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

This horn® waa in Philadelphia?
I believe it was; yes, Your Honor.
I was just wondering, there were therefore

alternative providers, qualified providers?
MR. ALLEN:

Well, there is some dispute as to the sa­

tent c£ alter nativa space at the time this matter was before
the District Court.
QUESTION:

This has®, in other words, was not in a

small town where there was not —
MR. ALLEN;
QUESTION;
MR. ALLEN;

It was not in a small town.
— was no other nursing heme around?
No, there are other nursing homes in

Philadelphia, very definitely.
QUESTION;
MR. ALLEN;

How many patients were involved?
I believe the home has seise 190 patients,

90 percent of whom are Medicaid patients.
QUESTION s

This would mean termination would require

their transfer t© other *—
MR. ALLEN;

In practical effect, it would mean that

if the home war© terminated, the patients would have to find
another qualified nursing home in order to receive benefits
under the statute

17
QUESTION:

And that the bard©-* wonId b©

ok

the pa™

tients to d© this, would it?
MR. ALLEN;

Well, tbs st&t® arid HEW have, services

infe®nd©d — and do — the Stats of Pennsylvania has a very ef­
fective service to assist patients t© relocate to other hemes.
QUESTIONs

Is this a fairly large': number, relative­

ly?
MR. ALLKNs
QUESTIONt
MR. ALLS!;
QUESTION:

190?
Yes.
I don’t knew that, Mr. Justice Brssanan.
Mr. Allen, your brief states flatly on

page 6 that it is in Philadelphia, 198 bods.
MR. ALLEN;

It is in Philadelphia; yes, sir.

What the Court of Appeals held in substance was that
because the decision to terminate a nursipg home in the program
has a significant effect on the patients’ fexereise of their
statutory rights, the decision therefor® constituted in sesa®
way a deprivation of the patients5 statutory rights and there­
for a deprivation of their property interests.

Accordingly

the Court ©f Appeals concluded that the patients have a right
under the due process clauso to notice and an opportunity to b®
heard on the merits of the decision to terminate the home.
It’s our basic submission that this theory of the
due process clause is incorrect.

It would mean that govern­

ment agencies would have to provide notice and hearings in an

18
almost infinite number of situations in which, governmental ac­
tion affects the exercis© of people’s statutory or constitu­
tional rights.

To take the theory to its logical conclusion,

it would moan, that if the government cancelled a defense con­
tract, it would have to provide hearings to all of th© defense
contractor’s .employees who might b@ affected by that decision.
• i

•

'

To take an example that’s perhaps more pertinent i:a
this contest, suppose that a state medical licensing board
sought to delicense a doctor ©a the grounds that h© was pro­
fessionally incompetent.

Under the Court of Appeals theory,

not only th© doctor but all of his Medicaid patients would have
a constitutional right to be heard on th© question of the doc­
tor's qualifications.
These and other examples, we submit, are no different
in principi® from this case, and 1 think ifc^’s interesting that
the respondent patients have not responded, at least in their
briefs, to the obvious implication ©£ their! position to in!

numerable other governmental decisions on in an aliae context .
I

Th© fact that the Court of Appeals decision would
have fsr-reaehingj implications, of course, doss net necessarily
mean that it was incorrect.

Indeed, this Court has never

directly faced tHd kind of claim ©£ derivative constitutional
rights that th® patients are asserting in'this cas®.

Oar

contention that the Court of Appeals was 'Wrong ia based ©a th©
basic proposition that this Court’s decisions reflect, that th©

19
procedural protections of the da© process clause must foe con­
fined by some limiting principles, that government could hard­
ly function if it had to provide notice and evidentiary hear­
ings to all persons affected by governmental action.
As this Court has said many times, the relevant
question concerns the nature and not the weight of the interest
that is affected.

And it is our submission that in consider­

ing the nature 'fof the interest that is affected., courts must
also identify whose rights are being affected9 whose rights
are being primarily affected by the governmental action.
In this case, the termination decision is directed
primarily against the nursing home, and no on© disputes that
the nursing horn® has a statutory right and a constitutional
proparty interest that is affected, and therefore a right to
some kind of notice and opportunity to fo@ heard in the merits
of the decision.
It is ©ur submission that so long ©s the person whose
rights are primarily affected by governmental action is given
an opportunity to contest that action and a notie® of the ac­
tion, the due process clause does not require hearings on the
sam© decision for other par-sons whose rights ar® indirectly
affect®! by that action.
QUESTION:

I suppose if the Court of Appeals w®r©

right and a defendant w@r© convicted of a crime and incarcer­
ated but decided not to appeal,, a second cousin whom he*d been

20
sending $30 a month to would have a right to appeal his con­
viction?
MR. ALLE2I:

That is our submission, Mr» Justice

Rehnquist, of the logical implications of the Court of Appeals
decision.
Mow, at this point it might b© asked, "Well, apart
fros th® logical implications of the decision, what is the
harm in giving patients some opportunity b© heard in this mat­
ter?98

Wall, th© harm is this;

Let us assume, at least for

the sake of argument, that a particular nursing hcsa© is in
substantial noncoraplianca with th® statutory standards and re™
quiraments, and thus.poses a genuine threat to the health and
safety of the patients.

Th® most effective sanction that the

regulatory agencies have for either inducing compliance by
the hem© or for protecting th® patients is to terminat® the
home's participation in the program.

If agencies could not

exercise their right until they gave hearings to all ©f th©
patients in the ham®, the effectiveness of that sanction would
be largely nullified.

The credibility of the sanction would

largaly evaporat®.
I cannot pet it bettar than th® Court of Appeals to
th® 9th Circuit in rejecting a similar claim with respect to
a claim by patients of a veterans hospital in a case we dis~
©ussad in our brief Moore v. Johnson:

Referring to th© impact

of the decision on patients of a decision to close certain

21
facilities? the court said;

"Similar burdens always attend

the extensive distribution of benefits by government.

Ines­

capably, few get exactly what they want whil© most, it is
usually assumed, get more than what they would have otherwise.
All would get less if invariably the complaints of the many
required elaborate hearings with all the trappings that only
lawyers and judges can fully appreciate.*5
Thank you, Your Honor.

I would like to reserve fchs

balance of my time for rebuttal by fcfa© petitioner.

MR. POSNERs

At this point nothing is before th®

court because during th© course of the hearing, whan th© court
was hearing evidence on our request for injunctive relief, an
appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals in th® interruption of
the evidence at that time, and I will r®f©r,fco that in just a

HEW cannot be involved in a suit by the patients against the
Commonwealth ©f Pennsylvania under our statutory law.

They

have no right, nor should they b@ permitted to attack th® renand
order for the ecsapXetion of th© case involving th© Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania.
Patients n@v©r sought any rights against HEW.

Their

rights hav® always beer, against ‘the Ccsaasonwealth, and HEW has
no right to interfere with their claim for protection.

QUESTION:

Yes, but now in this Court --In this court ~
The United States is technically a

respondent,
MR. POSNER:

I don't think so, sir.

I think this

case lies between us -- and I say "us,” the patients; we, the
patients -- and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and as to
whether or not the Fourteenth Amendment has been involved or
should be invoked.

MR. POSNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Is there* Mr. Posner* any possibility of
'

incompatibility between, the rights of the patients and the
rights of the nursing home?
MR. POSNER:

If that occasion should arise, sir,

should take place.

They believe a hearing

Should some issue arise, and it has not

arisen, Mr. Coyle, who is seated in this courtroom and whose
name appears on this brief, will take over on behalf of the
patients.

Until that time, I believe our courses are parallel

and at this point I am representing only the patients.

But

should there be any slight suggestion, sir, I personally would
walk out and would ask Mr. Coyle, or h© would demand that I
walk out.

So I see no problem there, sir.
QUESTION:

Is there any incompatibility really be­

tween the oosifcion of HEW and the present position of the
Secretary of the Commonwealth?
MR. POSNER:
QUESTION:

Incompatibility between —
Aren't their interests basically the

same?
MR. POSNER:

I would suppose to some extent the

answer must be yes to that, sir.

But let me put it this way —

Oh, I am sorry,
QUESTION:

So that the ~ the Third Circuit really

had presented to it all the arguments by HEW that this Court

27
is now being presented?
MR. POSHER:

No, sir,,

HEW was not concerned with

the violations of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Our case, the patients' case is strictly against the Common­
wealth of Pennsylvania.
QUESTION;

Well, we're not concerned with the viola­

tion -MR. POSHER;

Well, that's th® only problem that is

before this Court today, as I see it.
QUESTION;

Well, I thought it was your claim that the

laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were what conferred a
property right.
MR. POSHER;
QUESTION;

That is right, sir.
And the Constitution of the United States
,*

is what confers a due px*oc@ss right not to be deprived of that
property with a hearing.
MR. POSHER;

That is right, infringement under the

Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION;
MR. POSNER;

Isn't that your argument?
That is correct, sir.

Shall I proceed?
QUESTION;
MR. POSNER;

Yes, as far as I am concerned.
Th© legal issues involved her© are few

but I think it resolves itself, if you please, as to whether
or not these patients are entitled to a pr@--teyiftination

hearing before they are removed from their present home to a
non-designat®! place not yet selected by the authorities.

say the issue therefore is one of due process.
QUESTION:

Do the authorities in Pennsylvania have a

legal obligation under their statute to tell them where to go?
MR. POSNER:
it.

Well, sir, there's a real question about

The patients in the first instance should be able to find

their ham© according to the authorities in Pennsylvania.
QUESTION:

Did these patients who are now in the home

select this home, or were they mandated there by the state?
MR. POSNER:

To a large extent, sir, I would say to

a great majority, they selected this home* either themselves
or their relatives or by referral of physicians or by hospitals
You see, hospitals usually refer patients to a skilled nursing
institute when their program cannot encompass the treatment of
such patients, which require just constant nursing care.
We have what is known in Pennsylvania as the Medical
Assistance Program which does not permit transfer of patients
to another facility without first affording those patients a
factual hearing as to whether the move is for the welfare of
the patients, and during the course of this argument, I am
going to constantly say to Your Honors that the welfare of the
patients has been forgotten by both HEW and by the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania.

They are only interested in rules and regula­

tions which I will refer to

29

QUESTION :

You don't have any doubt# do you# that if a

non© of our business how Pennsylvania construes its laws?
MR. POSNER:

I don’t think it is any of your busi­

ness# if Your Honor puts it that way# as to how Perm sylvania
construes it# but if they construe it contrary to th© law of
the land ~
QUESTION:
MR. POSNER:

What do you mean# the law —
becomes a violation of th® Fourteenth

Amendment due process clause, then it becomes the business of
this Court.
QUESTION:

Then you are saying any time that this

Court thinks that any state has construed a state statute
pertaining to contracts# torts or anything else contrary to the.
way that statute should have been construed# it raises &
Fourteenth Amendment question?
MR. POSNER:

I think anything# and I will not restrict

it to contracts# sir, anything that involves# as I will argue#
life# liberty# and property dealing with personal rights that
is offended or affected by a stafe© contrary to its own sta­
tutes therefor® becomes a violation of the Fourteenth Amend­
ment and we have the right to request a Federal court to enjoin
th© commonwealths from acting contrary to th© wishes of those
people.
QUESTION:

What if th© Shat® of Pennsylvania had a

statute of limitations provision applying a two-year statute

30

to a certain type of cause of action»

Tha Pennsylvania court

said that statute applied in a particular case.

Could you

bring that case here on a Fourteenth Amendment claim, saying
that under the

— that Pennsylvania had misapplied its sta­

tute of limitations law?
MR. POSNER;

I won’t answer that question, if Your

Honor pleases, because I am concerned now with something much
more serious, the immediate removal from a home of people that
regard this as the only home they have in the world.
QUESTION;

Well, what stout fch© claim of a widow who

has missed a substantial negligence recovery because of the
statute of limitations bar?
MR. POSNER;

Isn’t that a fairly serious thing?

I think it might be very serious, sir,

and whether that is a violation of tha Fourteenth Amendment, I
don’t know.

I couldn't tell Your Honor at this point that that

would or would not be a violation.

But if there comes a

problem, I will try to answer it.
QUESTION;

Mr. Posner, you mentioned that as a mat­

ter of Pennsylvania statutory law the patients have a right to
a hearing before they're transferred to another facility?
MR. POSNER;
QUESTION;

That is correct, sir.
Do you rely on that statute as giving

them a right to, statutory right to participate in this pro­
ceeding?
MR. POSNER;

Statutory right to participate in this

31
pr©e©eding, sir?
QUESTIONS

Yes.

MR. POSNERs

When you say the matter before tha

Supreme Court?
QUESTION^

Well; but I mean a hearing, to partici­

pate in a proceeding to determine whether or not the hone shall
be disqualified?
MR. POSNERs

Definitely, sir, pre-termination hear­

ing so that they can offer —
QUESTION:

Really, one of your arguments then is it

is a matter of Pennsylvania law, you're entitled to the hear­
ing you seek?
MR. POSNER?

That is correct, sir.

And I will show

you that the Code of Federal Regulations also provides for
that hearing.
QUESTION;

What is to prevent, preclude, or hinder

the hone from calling, one at a time, every me of the patients
as a witness in the proceeding to disqualify the home?

Would

that not accomplish —
MR. POSNER?

If Your Honor pleases, in this very

case, five witnesses were called.

Every on® of them experts,

to testify concerning their experience in fch® field and why
this home was most proper and fitting to be a skilled nursing
home and should be licensed.

As a matter of fact, later in my

argument I will state to Your Honors that despite what HEW has

32
directed the Secretary of Welfare to do in Pennsylvania, the
authority, as Mr. Watkins very well put it, the determining
factor is Department of Health, and the Department of Health
has given us the license.

There is a license to Town Court in

this matter that they can exist as a nursing home.
The only problem is that the Secretary of Welfare
will not honor that statement by the Department of Health
because HEW says well, let them go somewhere els©..

Wow, 1

sjb

anticipating an argument I intended to make in fch® future, but
1 think it’s most important to point that out in this court at
this time.
We, patients, say that this is a legitimate nursing
home.

We the patients say that th© Commonwealth of Pennsylvania

through its Department of Health has given a license to this
place to operate, and it is in existence today.
QUESTIONS

The nursing home did have a hearing, did

it not?
MR. POSNER;
QUESTIONS
MR. POSNER:

Did not have a hearing, sir.
No hearing of any kind?
No.

They’re only entitled, according

to the Court of Appeals, to a post-termination hearing.
QUESTION;

Well, you’re not concerned with the de­

prive! of Pennsylvania license in this ease, are you?
MR. POSNER:
QUESTION:

No, sir, but what I3m trying to say is —
Wall, maybe the federal standards ar©

33
different from th© state standards,
MR. POSNER 5
QUESTION?

Pardon rae?
I say, m&yfo© th© federal standards ars

different from th® state standards.
MR.'POSNER:

That may be, sir, bat w« are not trying

to qualify under federal standards for these patients.

These

patients ~
QUESTION:

Weil, you ar© to th© ©sctent that you want

Medicare and Medicaid.
MR. POSNER;

No, sir.

These patients ar© entitled to

assistance under th® Pennsylvania law through an act of the
Legislatar® of Pennsylvania which gives the right to them to
secure assistance, which means nursing care, ®t cetera, and a
provider agreement is entered into between th® Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and a nursing home for skilled nursing car© to
those people.

HEW has nothing to do with that.

These people

Their only claim her© is that th®

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is defeating them of their rights
to maintain their horn®,
QUESTION:
MR. POSNER;

By violating its own law?
By violating its own law?

I would say,

sir, the Secretary of Welfare is adhering to th© request of
HEW.

The Department of Health says this is a very proper place

for these patients to h©„

We'll give them a license to operate

and they hav© given them a license.

34

This is not a place that you would say is to the
detriment of these people.

It is perfectly proper, and if they

had to be removed from another home to another placa, your
Department of Health in Pennsylvania would definitely take the
position that this was a proper nursing home for them to go to
because they are a licensed nursing home.
QUESTION:

Well, those are all a craestioh of

Pennsylvania law that w® have nothing to do with,
MR. POSNER;

I submit to Your Honor you have nothing

to do with the Pennsylvania law,
stated that on many occasions.

Mr. Chief Justice Burger has
But where there has been a

violation of the Pennsylvania law so that it affects a person's
rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, it. becomes a federal
matter.

That is ray position.
QUESTION;

Well, that’s just a jump to a conclusion,

so far as I can see.
MR. POSNER:
QUESTXGN:

Well ~
Well, your point is that if a state con­

struas its law, statutory or common law or state constitutional
law, in a way that contravenes th© Federal Constitution, then
it becomes a matter for this Court?
MR. POSNER:
QUESTION:
MR. POSNER:

That is correct, sir.

one of the patients in the home cone in and take part in it in
the sense of justifying?

and we have one five years old that hasn’t taken place, the

You couldn’t

been done.
QUESTION:

who do you say is responsible for not hav­

ing completed that hearing?
MR. POSNER:
ing home is concerned?

The post hearings?

As far as the nurs­

HEW.

We have an action instituted in the District Court
of Pennsylvania through one lawyer representing this home
which takes the position that this Court has taken, and I am
referring to the horse trainer case that Your Honors recently
ruled upon, that the failure of the government, HEW, to grant
that post-termination hearing in due time forbid them from
proceeding in any fashion toward the decertifying of this hone.
But that is a matter before the District Court now.
What I must, do here, sirs, I must draw not a picture,
a sketch, if you will, of what these patients call home, and
why the removal of them from that horns is a deprivation of
their life and liberty.

3S
Their world, if the Court please, these patients -they are 75, 80, 85 years of age — has been reduced to the

the attendants.

The other patients, the nurses,

Visitors, relatives, occasionally visit them.

They are chronically ill persons.

They are infirm.

They suf­

fer from many diseases, from cancer to cardiovascular problems.
They know each other, and they know each other's problems.
They talk together about their aches and pains, and even world
problems.
Despite the fact that they are ill and infirm, if
the Court pleases, the small world that they have is their home,
the only home; they know.

The people in there are their friends.

It had been reduced to that.

The nurses in there know them.

They don't apologise because of the serious condition that
causes a nurse to take car© of a situation that embarrasses the
patient.
They are not there to await death, because in the

Suddenly, this hone is decertified.
mean to them?

They have to go elsewhere.

What does it

Will their friends

go with than to these other places, and where will they go?
No one has the answer.

Imagination, fear creeps into the

minds of these people.

Will fch© nest placa have windows., for

instance?, "Will the nurses understand my problems?"

Where will

37

ifc be? "Another city miles away from the few visitors I have?

V

What will be the conditions there?"
This is a real fear? I submit to Your Honors.

Their

;

home has been destroyed.

Can the real fear of transfer trauma

affect the health of these people?
QUESTION :

Keep in mind —

Does the —

ii

MR. POSNER:

-- th© serious condition of these

people, as it was.
QUESTION:

Does transfer trauma come, is it life ,

is it liberty, or is it property?
MR. POSNER:

I say transfer trauma, sir, to a large

extent in the case of a seriously ill patient, can mean life,
Th® shortening of that patient's life by one day is a depriva­
tion of life, as far as my argument goes.

I think it is also

a breach of liberty where the government, HEW in this case,
has taken th® position which I will argtie, if I get the
opportunity, that we're only interested in the monetary moneys
that w© supply to your state.

We have no interest in th©

psychic effects or benefits that might accrue to these people
because of th® money.
QUESTION:

But I think the Court of Appeals said

you had a property interest.
MR. POSNER:
QUESTION:
property?

They did, sir.
So you say you have life, liberty, and

38

MR. POSNER?

Oh yes, sir.

I say to Your Honors, in the medical testimony even
in this case is to the effect that mortality —• we had a doctor
testifying, a psychiatrist of note, if Your Honors please —*
can bring about many serious conditions, such as heart attacks,
cerebral hemorrhage, high blood pressure which might bring on
death in an elderly person.

Bo doctors say that the patients

will suffer as a result of removal.

If true, I ask this Court,

haven't these patients been deprived of not only their property
rights, the home in which they live, the only home they know,
but the shortening of life, whatever life still remains to them?
QUESTION:

Is it not possible that the State of

Pennsylvania and the Department of Health and Welfare has an
obligation to see to it that adequate care is provided that
will not bring on any of this train of circumstances?
MR. POSNERs

That is right, sir, and that a pre-

termination hearing is their obligation to demonstrate that.
And all X am saying to this Court, and Your Honor has summed
it up, the Court of Appeals said this case was interfered with.
It wasn't completed.

No appeals were taken by the petitioner.

Send it back to the lower court, let th®sn complete the hearing
that they started.

If they decide there is no violation of

the Fourteenth Amendment w© don't belong before the Supreme
Court of the United States.

But if they decide that there was

an interference with these patients’ rights, that it was a

39
deprivation ©f life, liberty,, and property, then w® may be back
here again.

But certainly at this stage of the proceedings,

without the completion of the testimony to demonstrate that
these patients will be hurt and hurt badly, and that has al­
ready

been testified to by Dr. Linden, as I noted, a psychia­

trist of 32 years9 standing, who examined two to three hundred
of the patients in this heme, over a period of years, who felt
that high mortality rate might take place as a result of
transfer trauma, who felt that this place was proper and suf­
ficient for the needs of these people.
I say that we have a situation her© where HEW says,
"We don’t have to find these people a home.

MR. POSNER:, Eligibility for Medicaid® is under the
Pennsylvania statutes, and I would refer t© it if I have enough
time, sir, but it is undar the Pennsylvania act, the determina­
tion of what is needy and who is medically ill is their deter­
mination, not HEW33 under Title 19.

MR. POSNER;

QUESTION;

I am talking about the quality of the

provider, the -- however, if you don’t understand ray question,
you don’t.
MR. POSNER;

I do understand your question.

I am

trying to find an answer to you, sir, because you have nursing
homes that qualify both under 18 and 13.
QUESTION;
MR. POSNER;

I’m sure you do.
The disqualification of a home, the de­

certification of a home, canes about if there’s a violation of
18 and they then say you’re disqualified under both 18 and 13.
We say the patients are not affected by that.

They have a

right under the Pennsylvania act to secure medical assistance,
which includes nursing homes.
QUESTION;

That’s your basic argument; I understand

it.
MR. POSNER;

And that’s the reason I hesitate in

answering your question.

And again, the regulations, federal

are concerned.
Now, I hav© also argued in my brief the question of
third party rights, third party beneficiary rights under
Pennsylvania law.

I will not go into it for the purposes of

time, if I may, because the cases in support of that under
Pennsylvania law are found on page 27 of my brief.

Other

states have held in similar situations that these people are
third party beneficiaries.

I raust say to Your Honors that any

disruption of cars, services and treatment under the provider
agreement is a violation of the rights of these people.
MR. CHXBF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your time has expired now,

Mr. Posner.
MR.. POSNER:

I ass so sorry, sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Is there any rebuttal?

You hav® five minutes remaining.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN J. WATKINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER ~ REBUTTAL
MR. WATKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas© th®

Court:
Several matters I would like to address.

First, th©

question of whether or not th© petitioner is properly her®.

43
Respondeat makes apparently two claims in that re­
gard;

The first is, as I understand it, that the order that

his proceedings ia the District Court were interrupted.

I

assume h@ is suggesting that th® order of the District Court
was not appealable.

He fail®! to point out that he appealed

from that order, and it is indeed that appeal that brings the
petitioner to this Court, because as w@ have pointed out, we
participated as appellee in the Court of Appeals, responding
to his appeal on the issue of primary importance, that being
the patients' due process rights.
Secondly, he concedes that if HEW is properly her®,
then of course plenary review may be granted over the question
presented in th© certiorari petition, but he argues that HEW
is not properly hare because they never sued HEW on this issue.
I ask th© Court t© look at the complaint.

The prayer

for relief very specifically runs against bo4h HEW and
Pennsylvania, and well it should, because HEW provides over
half of the funding for th© Medicaid© patients which my learned
opponent is representing.
QUESTION;

What is the specific order against

Pennsylvania?
MR,. WATKINS;

Th© order against Pennsylvania and

HEW is that Medicaid© funding be continued until the patients
are relocated.
QUESTION:

This is a prospective order to pay money?

44
MR. WATKINSs
QUESTION?

Yes.

Yes, it is.

Against the state?

MR. WATKINSs

Against the state and HEW.

Indeed, it

would have to b© against HEW because, as I said, they provide
over half of the funds that are involved.

So that the fact

that there are no Medicare patients is of little consequence,
and is easily explained — easily explains why HEW was sued by
these Medicaid® patients, because HEW has an extremely large
rol® in the administration of Medicaid©, and without them as a
defendant here, the relief could not have been complete.
QUESTION:

Was any Eleventh Amendment question ever

raised?
MR. WATKINS:

No, Mr. Justice White.

My opponent asserts in the alternative that his claim
edicafced only upon state law, a contract theory which we
have addressed in the briefs, and state law, which he has not
pointed out her®.

B® has yet to point t© a provision in

Pennsylvania law that requires a hearing for th®s® patients be­
fore their Medicaid© certification — before the nursing hone
certification is terminated.
QUESTION:

In fact there is none.

Well, I understand his argument.

His

point is that the failure of — any failure to provide for a
hearing for the patients is the violation of the Federal
Constitution.

That8s what I thought ha was arguing.

MR. WATKINS:

That is what I assumed h® was arguing

45
until this morning,, when I believe that h@ argued that it was
not federal law that h@ was concerned about? h@ was concerned
about provisions of state law which, if they existed, of
course, would be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

The

fact of the matter is he has pointed to none? there are none.
W© have supplied the Court with a copy of the precise contract
which was utilised between th® State of Pennsylvania and Town
Court Nursing Center which in th® clearest of terms points out
that th© contract is terminable forthwith should th© facility
fall out of compliance with federal and state regulations
governing th© operation of such facilities.
Finally, I should point out that throughout th©
proceedings, th© state law questions never surface from th®
respondents, never have th© patients asserted that Pennsylvania
-was breaching its own law by terminating th© facility, and in*

de©d, th® first mention of any such, the first allusion to
this is in this Court, and as I pointed out, no specific pro­
visions were pointed cut.

Indeed, they couldn't be because

they don't exist.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, gentlemen.

Th® case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:06 o'clock a.m., th© case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
