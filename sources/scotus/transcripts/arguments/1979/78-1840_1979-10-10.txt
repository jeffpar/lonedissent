PROCEEDINGS
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments next

in City of Roms against the United State®.
Hr. Brinson, I think you may proceed when you’re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT K. BRINSON, ESQ.»
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. BRINSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
I represent the City of Rome and two of its citizens
in a Section 5 matter, which is somewhat broader than a Section
5, Voting Rights Act of 1965 matter.
The City of Rom® is a city of soma 30,COO persons.
It lisa 65 miles or so northwest of Atlanta, Georgia.
I am on my 23rd visit to the City of Washington in
an effort to get preclaaranee of my city’s growth and government
under Section S, the pr®clearance provision of the Voting
Sights Act, a provision which we her® challenge.
The City of Romo is gov©rn®d by a Council-Manager
form of government, which has been elected at large since
1918.

In 1966, during a time when, or soon after this Court's

raapportionmenfc cases, and during those

r®apportionment

cases the City Attorney, upon request from the then governing
council, recommended to th® City Council that certain changes
needed to be mad®, as h© understood th® r®apportionment casas,

as they existed at that tim©.
The reason for his recommendation was the City of
Rome was divided into nine wards of very disparate size, and
©van though the City Council was ©i-cted at large there was a
residency requirement.
At that tima there was a case pending under the title
of Dusch v. Davis in the lower court, where that system of
government had been challenged.

And that ultimately made this

Court and it was reversed. But at that time the law was in
question.
The City Attorney recommended that certain provisions
of the charter of fcha City of Rom© be changed at that time.
Among which ware the wards situation, should be changed from
nine to three; and, at fch© sam© tima, soma housaeleaning mafctars
in the government should ba also char,gad.
As of that time, in 19S4 the Georgia election cod®
required a majority vet®; and although that cod© did not
specifically apply to municipalities in Georgia, it ££d serve
as an unofficial guid® for local charter.
He recommended that majority vote be instituted.
And noting that there was a tendency from time to time for
both the county government and the city government to b® swept
completely out of office, he recommended, in order to assure
soa® continuity of government, that staggered terms be
instituted.

And tha etsggersd terms, the bast way to safe them

5

up would b© to provida for numbered posts»
He also, to make consistent the charter with respect
to the city Commission and the Board of Education, recommended
that residency requirements be instituted for the Board of
Education, as they war© required for the City Commission=
So that these electoral changes which were mad© in
1966 by the Georgia Legislature were:

the majority vote;

numbered posts; staggered terms; and residency requirement for
ths Board of Education»
QUESTION: And reduction of nine wards to three»
MR» BRINSON:
QUESTION:

And reduction of. nine wards to thro©»
With the Commission or Council now still

elected at large and still the same number of members, but
requirement that they reside, some of them reside in each of
th© three wards; is that it?
MR» BRINSON:

That is correct»

These changes took placo -•> and it is important to
note that at the same time theses changes took place, on the
Stato front, on th© general Stats law front, the Georgia
Municipal Election Cod© in 1968, which also contained majority
vote provision and a numbered post prevision, for Statewide
application, was submitted to the Attorney General and pra~
cleared»
It is also important to not© that when the changes
of tho City of Rome ware mad©, it was prior to this Court's

6

decision in Alien vs a Board of Elections* and Perkins vs.
Matthews„

And quite a while prior to* in fact five years

prior to the time that the Attorney General even had regulations
governing the manner in which submissions under Section 5
war® to be mads0
The City of Roma in 1974 had an annexation of a
rather large — at least for the city of Rome ~~ section over
its objection; that is, over the City Government*s objection.
It was imposed upon them by the Stats Legislature

because of a

groat need of sewer services within this Island in the City of
Rome.

It was an island, the City of Rome surrounded an

unincorporated area.
So that the -•« over the actual objection of the Roma
City Commission, the Stats of Georgia, the local legislative
delegation imposed the annexation of that area on the city.
It was a Stats law by which that annexation took place, although
annexation can also take placa by ordinance.
In 1974 that annexation was submitted tofche Attorney
General by the then City Attorney.

The Attorney General wrote

back and said that he could not preclear it until'he learned
about the City Government and what it was like.
Whereupon, the city provided additional information
as to what the city, how the city was structured, and that
included the 1966 electoral changes.
The Attorney General than refused to preclear both

\
7
that annexation and tha electoral changes» And, in addition,
h® had inquired about th® number of annexations which had
occurred since 1964» There war® a total of 60 annexations,
which had taken place during a ten-year period.
QUESTION:

And these annexations had been by way of

an ordinance or by way of legislation in the State Legislature?
MR. BRINSON;

Four of them had bean State Legislature,

and tha balance were by ordinance.
QUESTION:
MR. BRINSON:

By ordinance.
That's correct.

So that after the exchange between th® City
Attorney and the Attorney General of the United Statos, there
remained the unprecleared electoral changes and 13 of the
annexations.
In the meantime, the City of Rome had conducted some
five or six elections under the changes which they had made
in 1966, including the staggered terms provision.

So that

there were members right in the middle of their term.
It was determined, as of th© objection time, that no
further elections war® feasible under th© then existing
interplay of fedaral and Stats law.

So that no election has

been held in Rome since 1974.
QUESTION:

Nhat is it, except for this situation,

is it a biennial or election every two years?
MR. BRINSON s

Yes.

No, I believe it's ©very four

years
QUESTION:

Every four years,

MR, BRINSON:
QUESTION:

Yes,
And the terms at first, I guess, ware

of differing lengths, to introduce the staggered terras, but
thereafter -«
MR, BRINSON:

That's right, to initiate the staggered

terras»
QUESTION:

Thereafter they ware four-year terras?

MR, BRINSON:

That's correct,

Whereupon the City of Rome filed suit in the only
jurisdiction in which it can file suit, the District Court of
the District of Columbia, to seek not only a review of the
Attorney General's action or the constitutionality of the
Attorney General's action, but bail-out.

And at which time it

also challenged the constitutionality of Section 5, and also
asked that it be permitted to bail out under Section 4 of the
Voting Rights Act,
The District Court of the District of Columbia made
many findings of fact, to which I commend this Ccurt for its
careful reading, which we have itemized in the brief and have
shown that there have been soma 18 particular findings which
are characterized according to the Simmer standards, under
Simmer vs, McKeithen,

The City of Roma took the position that

in order to carry its burden approving no purpose and no effect,

s
that ths Simmer standards were applicable, at least were a
guide by which they could prove the lack of discriminatory
effect in the changes and annexations„
The Court below found that there was not, had not
been used in the City of Rome any literacy test for the 17-ysar
period required by the Act,
discriminatione

The Court also found’no past

The Court also found a total access to the

political process, and, to quota the Court, it said that the
city officials of Rome were quit© responsive to the needs of
the minoritiesc,
And, most remarkably, with respect to the political
power of minorities in the City of Rome, I quota the specific
findings of the Court below:

Blacks often hold th© balance

of power in Rome elections»
And in Rome politics, ths black community, if it
chooses to vote as a group, can probably determine th© outcomes
of many, if not most, contests«
The many others, detailing and generalising th©
findings as to the raprossntations provided by the City of
Rome for th© minorities are set out on pages S through 7 of
th© brief*

Quite frankly, 1 think they ar® remarkable, and

Irm proud of my city for having conducted its own affirmative
action plan? that"a about what it amounts to»
QUESTIOHs

Mr» Brinson, it* s boon a while sine© X

read the briefs in this eesas do I recollect correctly that

10

tha population makeup o£ your city is about three-quarters
white and one-quarter Negro?
MR® BRINSON;

'rhat is Correct, almost exactly®

It’s

about 76 to 23»4 percents,
QUESTION;

You’ve read us that finding, have there

been Negro office holders in the city?
MR. BRINSON:

Thar® have bean no elected black

officials in the City of Romo.

However, there’s been only on©

black citisen who ran for office after tha change times, and
only one significant candidate who ran before the electoral
chsmges were made.
QUESTION; But neither on© was elected?
MR. BRINSON:

Neither on© was elected.

Thera is on® appointed on the Board of Education,
which is a six-member board.
QUESTION:

And th© ©lection was at large both before

and after 1S6S?
MR. BRINSON:

That*s correct.

The city takes th® position that, among its basic
positions that it did take from th® very beginning, at the first
instance, was tha unconstitutionality of the Act, and that is
th® power of Congress to enact a provision, that is Section 5,
which permits th© attorney General or the Court to deny proclearance merely on effect.

Because the lower court found the

City of Rom® completely innocent of any purposeful discrimina-

tion in any of its electoral changes or annexations» That was
a specific finding by the lovfsr court»
Thus the question is squarely presented to this
Court whether or not Congress indeed has the power to prescriba
those changes which may have arguable discriminatory affect
alone.
QUESTION:

You say, than, that Section 5 of the

Fifteenth Amendment permits Congress to provide for implements"
tion of the proscriptions ofth© amendment itself, but it does
not permit it to enlarge the rights created by the Fifteenth
Amendment?
ME. BRINSON:
argue that point.

That is correct.

We do that» Wq do

That is Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment.

The enforcement clause.
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, I was confusing Section 5

with respect to those things, too.
MR. BRINSON:
Section

■'}

We eay that the substituta provision,

of fcha Fifteenth Amendment, controls just what they

can enforce, that Congress can only enforce tha substantive
provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Of course the Court has hold otherwise

with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment.
MR. BRINSON:

Hasn't it?

I don’t agree that it has, I —•

QUESTION: Well, 1 thought it did? I didn’t agree with
the Court whan it did so, but

12

MRe BRINSON:

We have analysed the Kafcasanbach

vb

.

Morgan cas©
QUESTION:

That’s the case I’m talking about,

MR, BRINSON;

And Oregon vs, Mitchell as well.

And we found that, nevertheless, it is based on some rational
fact-finding, that in that case what, the Court did was analyze
what Congress had done and Congress had specifically, with
its fact-finding powers, had determined that the abolition of
the literacy test would

that the existence of a literacy

test denied services to non-English speaking people, and that
also it denied the voting rights, and that a specific way to
counter that would be to prohibit the literacy test. But that
was based on a fact-finding with specific reference to the
literacy test itself.

The literacy test, the national

application of the prohibition of literacy test was also subject
to that fact-finding in Oregon vs. Mitchell,
QUESTION: But then it wouldrft have been a sufficient
answer in those cases for the Stats or city to have coma back
and said the literacy test, although they say'have had
discriminatory effect, were not discriminatory in purpose.
MR. BRINSON:

The point that wa make is that, as was

noted in Oregon v. Mitchell, that there ar© three

as

Justice Black noted in Oregon v. Mitchell, the three things
that Congress can do a,s® to enforce th© substantlva provisions
of the Constitution and sannofc strip th© States of their pow@r

'13

~~

I'm

going to get into that -- b«t with reference to States,

it cannot strip the States of their power, and can only
enact appropriate legislation, appropriate with respect to the
State power reserved to it»
We contend that, first of all, and the question that
I’ve not yet reached, that the Fifteenth Amendment does
prohibit only purposeful discrimination, a question which we
say -- and I’m not sure that it has been decided, I-;know that
it is before tha Court now in another case *»*» it is also
before the Court in this case»

But such a holding would be

consistent with th® Court’s treatment of the Fourteenth
Amendment, as reflected in the Washington v„ Davis, and more
recently in the Finney case,,
But it 3.3 also consistent with Gomillion va„ Lightfoot,
and the Wright case, as well as Nevatt vs„ Sides, a case from
the Fifth Circuito
But the question becomes whether or not Congress
does have the power to expand the' substantive provision of
the Fifteenth Amendment of Section 1,

If Section 1 does not

proscribe innocent electoral changes, then we contend that
Congress cannot proscribe innocent electoral changes,
because to do so would be to expand that provision»
And the appropriateness of such legislation with
respect to th© States, which is th© test as established in **>»
QUESTION:

As I get it, the only way for that

14

would ba for the Legislature to say: Wa are doing this for the
express purpose of discriminating against the minorities.
Now, if thoy don't say that, that's it.

Is that

your position?
MR. BRINSON:
QUESTION:

No, Mr. Justice Marshall, -Thank you.

MR. BRINSON:

-- it is not.

Because the other way that has been justified is that
there is some nexus or some prior discrimination.

In every

other voting rights case there has been some indication of
discrimination otherwise.

Some prior discrimination which has

a present nexus to the existing affaet.
And that dooa not exist in Rome. That was found to be
excluded with respect to past discrimination.

It was found

that the present -- it was an actual finding, it was not. just a
lack thereof. The City of Roma proved that there was no
purpose to the satisfaction of the District Court of the
District of Columbia.
QUESTION:

/ Aud the Civil Rights Act of 1954 and

specifically Title V2I thereof was enacted under the commarce
clausa power,

2 suppose?

MR. BRINSON:

X understand.that it has been held to

ba also enacted under the Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION: Well, the amendments maybe.
MR. BRINSON: Right

'IS

QUESTION:

But they would be, I suppose, under the

commerce powg, at .least arguably»
MR. BRINSON:

Yes, sir»

Now, however, it is my understanding that this Court
has never addressed the question of whether or not Title VII
can be applicable to cities or States, because of the reserve
power of the States, and that fchsr® is an additional
consideration»

Because of States qua States, as we’re reminded

in the National League of Cities case»
I realise that that was a commerce clav.se case,
nevertheless, it revivified the existence of the Tenth Amendment
and federalism principle»
1 think that Pitapatriek v» Bitser, which was an
Eleventh Amendment case, is not inconsistent with that holding»
And that where there's application tc State action or to
States as States, that an additional consideration is there,
and that is the federalism’

principle of the Tenth Amendment

and of the fourth section «*•
QUESTION:
MR» BRINSON:
QUESTION:
MR» BRINSON:

That’s Article IV, Section 4»
The guaranty clause»
For the republican form of government»
That’s correct»

One of the considerations, 1 think, that has been
discussed in these cases is that, wall, Congress considered the
federalism principle whan it enacted the statute in question»

16

And that may be true» but I remind the Court in this
case that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act is an entirely
different animal from such remedies ss Title VII»

It is an

entirely different kind0 and on© that has been observed to b©
a vast departure from our ordinary concepts of federalism»
And I would remind the Court also that it has
application only to a few States»

Therefore, when Congress

passed Section 5, it could not have been considered to uphold
the federalism principle because it was applicable to only a
few States,
This has boon particularly noted, I think, by Mr,
Justice Powell, who, in his various dissents with respect to
tha Voting Rights Act, has noted that it is mads more noxious
by its applicability to a few Statos»
The National Lsagu© of Cities decision -- again,
although a decision involving commores power -- points out
that federalism principles prevent Congress from enacting a
law,; that interferes with tha State's separate and independent
existence»

We have attempted to show in our brief just how

this interference has occurred.
It has baen a criticism for quite some time, and it
was indeed a criticism on theoretical basis in the Katssnbach
case.

And we1 r© not asking thii? Court to rehear the Kataanbach

case, we have attempted t© saak@ that clear, that Kataenbaoh
is clear -*> many times from the language of Kataanbach, that

17

the Court was than addressing and that Congress was addressing
purposeful discrimination»
The very terms that ar® used throughout the Katssanbach
case refer to the evil of purposeful discrimination»

The

contrivances of discriminatione
Moreover, it was also important in South Carolina
vs, Katzenbach, and they noted, and based their justification
of Section 5 on the temporary nature of the Act? that is, the
intent of the Congress at the time was that it would last
five yearso
QUESTION: So you submit that the effect language in
the section is unsupported, is unsupportable under the
Constitution?
MR. BRINSON:

Wa do not, Your Honor; we have

suggested to the Court a construction of the statute which
would be within our argument about the constitutionality»
So that Congress could not be considered to have expanded
the limitations on Section 1, or limitations provided by
Section 'I of the Fifteenth teendsmnt»
That construction is that in determining whether or
not »«
QUESTION:

Wall, you do argu© that Congress has no

power,”»
MR. BR2NS0M:
QUESTION:

Wa do.

-- to prohibit electoral changes that have

no discriminators? purpose?
MR. BRINSON:

Wa do indeed argue that, Your Honor,

except that we argue «■QUESTION: Why do you argue that at all?
MR. BRINSON:

Because wa feel that the Congress

unless the statute is interpreted th® way we suggested, that
it has expanded those limitations of Section 1.
QUESTION: So you do argue, then, that Congress had -that the effect language in Section 5 a® it permite — if it
forbinds changes without discriminatory purposes, unconstitu­
tional?
MR. BRINSON:

No, sir, we argue -»■

QUESTION: Well, if the effect language bans changes
that took place without discriminatory purpose, you say that
th® effect language is unconstitutional.
MR. BRINSON:
Congress so intended.

That*a correct.

To the extent that

Or to tho extent that it's bean applied

by the District Court of th® District of Columbia.
,«

QUESTION: and you say wo have never held otherwise?
MR. BRINSON:

I don’t believe this Court has,

I

believe that wherever this Court has had a voting rights case,
it has involved purposeful discrimination.
QUESTION:

What about Beer?

MR. BRINSON:

In Beer there was «■“ it was at least

noted in th© dissent that there was purposeful discrimination,

19

that it was involved.,
QUESTION: Well, that’s nice, talking about the
dissento

That was ms,
[Laughter» 3
QUESTION: What about the majority?
MR» BRINSON:

Well, in that case, Your Honor, I

think the fact that there had bean discrimination in the city,
there had been a history of discrimination, but in looking to
effect, the issue was not before the Court at the time, but
in looking at the affect, there was the cognisance that the
city had had a history of racial discrimination»
QUESTION:

We wouldn’t reach a constitutional claim,

Z take it, if thar© was some nonconstitutional basis upon
which wa could dscid© the case?
MR» BRINSON:

I believe' that would be correct»

QUESTION: And we reviewed s. three»*judge court’s
findings on a clearly erroneous basis?
MR. BRINSON: The findings in this case would
support our proposition, because they are exactly and
specifically that we have no discriminatory purpose»
QUESTION:

Wall, except that that necessarily includes

your constitutional premise»

Supposing you ware to show that

not only was the District Court correct in finding there was
no intent, but that it was wrong in showing there was no
effect, that the annexations, for example, ware de minimis?

20

MR. BRINSON:

Well, we do vary well, that is still

another argument that we made, that there is no effect under
the Act.
QUESTION: Well, that would not require any
constitutional holding on our part.
MR. BRINSON:

That's correct.

QUESTION: But that would require us to overturn the
finding of the District Court?
MR. BRINSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, it would.
And therefore, at least we would be

obliged to find that that finding was clearly erroneous, I
suppose?
MR. BRINSON:

That's correct.

And wa do argue that principle.

We argue, first of

all, that it's unconstitutional, as being expansion of
substantive provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment.

We argue

that if you can construe the Act to provido that where there's
purpose, then there should be no praclsaranca.
the, also, on effect.

If there is

If it's not clear whether there's purpose,

then you look at the effect that exists and see if you can
infer purpose.
And then if there: is effaefe alone, that **- without
purpose, or if there can be no inference of purpose, then the
provision should be precleared.
QUESTION:

Is it «» more fundamentally, Mr. Brinson,

21

do you contend that this particular constitutional issue was
not decided in Katssenfe&ch, in South Carolina against
Katsanbach?

Or ar© you conceding that it was decided and

asking us to revisit, reconsider that decision?
MR, BRINSON s

It was not 'decided, we contend,

Your Honor, because the question, first of all, was not before
the Court, and it is clear from the Court's decision that it
was considering purposeful discrimination; that those *?er@
the evils to which it was directing «•" to which Congress V7aa
directing the Act, and the reasons for justifying the Act wars
tha- unique circumstances existing at tha fcims.
And ea contend that those vsniqua circumstances don’t
exist now, and did not exist at the time that the Section 5
of tha Voting Rights Act was re-enacted in 1975«
V?e contend that the fact that thsra ware unique
circumstances was the way that the Court justified the
intruaiveneas or tha uniqueness of the Section 5 other remedy,
QUESTION:

In South Carolina against K&txenbach?

MR, BRINSON:

Correct,

QUESTION: And you're telling us now they have
changed circumstances, which would imply that you're conceding
that this issue was decided in Katsenbach,
MR, BRINSON:
QUESTION:

No, sir,

That*«3 what confusos me.

MR, BRINSON:

Well, we do r.ofc concede that issue,

22

but we say that
QUESTION:

Well, even if the conditions have not

bean changed* you're telling us that in any event this is a
new question before this Court,
MR, BRINSONj
QUESTION:

I am saying in any event.

Yes.

MR. BRINSON:

I am saying that.

Because we have

several alternative approaches to this, and the fact, first
of all they were looking at purposeful discrimination, that
was the evil to which tha Court and Congress were directing
in 1965 and *66.
But that in any avent, in looking at it today, there's
© different sat of circumstances, and in the re-enaetnent in
1975 there was a different set of circumstances.
QUESTION: That wasn't true in Morgan v. Kataenb&ch,
though. The claim there ■wasn't purposeful discrimination.
MR. BRINSON:

Ho, Mr. JuEtica Rehnquist, but the

claim there was that non-English spee.king people had been
intentionally discriminated against, with respect to city
services, or, rather, services, governmental services.
And that there had bean an intentional discrimination of the
right to vote previously.
But that the particular change, tha particular
literacy requirements had been utilised intentionally, and
therefor® it was promiscuous under the congraosienal fact-

23

finding to outlaw.
Here, to show the Court our effect argument, the fact
that whether or not Congress e&n outlaw non“purposeful
discriminatory changes, there is no effect hare,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court»
In our viev?, vsry little, if anything, is involved in
this case, other than faithful application by the District
Court to th© facts before it of the principles established by
this Court’s pertinent decisions.
QUESTION:

Do you think 'w©

mad© a mistake in

expired.

Well, that is not for m® to say,. Mr.

Probable jurisdiction was noted bafor© the time for
Our response to th© jurisdictional statement had
Otherwise the ease would have been put over th©

summer whan the Court made that decision. And l‘m not her®
to question the Court’s determination of that question.
2*m hera to state our contentions about what’s involved in

24

the case *
The rule of reteograssion, established in Beer vUnited States -- and i<rs * va set out the pertinent quotation in
our brief at page 33 ■»*■> was largely fieterminativ© of the outcom®
hare, as the District Court analysed the case.

And I might

point out that that rule was developed by this Court in the
context of a question about the effect of the changes that
were involved in Beer, the question of discriminatory purpose
had not been reached by the District Court in Beer, and therefore
was not before this Courts

It was something to be considered

on remand in Beer* after this Court's docision0
So the rule of retrogression was adopted by this
Court in Beer, entirely in the context of the effect test
under Section 5„

That was the rule applied quite properly

here, in our view, by the District Court0

The kinds of

changes at issue here, particularly annexations of predominantly
white areas, and the imposition of meijority vote requirements
where previously there had bean election by plurality, and
th© run-off elections that went along with that, and th®
imposition of staggered termo wore all devices specifically
mentioned in the Committee Report accompanying the 1975
extension of the Voting Rights Act, as devieas threatening
diminution of black voting strength»
QUESTION:

Mr» Wallace, on® of your statements was

annexation of predominantly whit® areas.

As I understand it,

25

if one took the population of the area whan it was annexed^
frequently it was virtually unpopulated»
HR, WALLACE:

In those, in 4 7 of the 60 annexations,

the Attorney General pracleared them after that became
apparent.

And his objections wore interposed as to only 13

of the 60 annexations that had taken place.

With respect to

those, there was an addition of., I believe it was, 2,000»&nd«“
some white voters.

Wo h&v© the figures in the brief.

But -QUESTION:

Does that change the percentage vary

much?
MR, WALLACE:

Not very much, but measurably, Your

Honor,
QUESTION:

Lass than one percent?

MR, WALLACE:

It was a total of two percent; it was

a on® percent increase in whit® registered voters, and a one
percent decrease in the percentage of black registered voters
for a difference of two percent.
We have that set forth in a lengthy footnote in
our brief, in which wo analyse the statistical evidence
it * 3 on pages 38 and 39 «« a little bit differently from the
way the District Court did,
QUESTION:

You think that ties in with the holding

in Richmond?
MR, WALLACE:

It &e®3 tl© in with the holding in

26

Richmond, Fir» Justice, but it ties in ©van more closely with
the holding in the City of Petersburg»
And in just a moment I would like to speak further
about the annexations»

1 just wanted to say with inspect, to

the other changes, as wa pointed out in our brief, unlike the
typical Section 5 case, in this case the District Court did
net have to predict whether there would be a retrogressive
effect as a result of the other changes because elections had
taken place for eight years under those changes, without
their having been precleared, and in the 1970 election, in
which- Reverend Hill, a black candidate to whom counsel for
the petitioner referred, ran for office»

He would ha\?e bean

elected under the old procedure, indeed, arguably, ha was
elected since the run-off election and the majority vote
requirement had not bean procleared end ware a nullity»
But there has been a subsequent election, so that issue is,
for practical purposes, moot»

But, arguably, ha was elected

because he received a plurality in the initial veto, and than
was defeated in fch® run-off, in which a majority vote was
required as a result of fch@ change»
So there was no speculation, required about whether
a retrogressive offset was involved in the changes at issue
hero»
Mow, with respect to the annexations, this cas®, in
ear submission, differs only in degree and not in any way in

27
principle from the Petersburg case, which was decided
summarily by this Court in Volume 410, U.S., and was referred to
extensively in the Court's subsequent opinion in City of
Richmonds
In affirming that judgment, this Court necessarily
rejected petitioner's basic statutory argument here, and
implicitly rejected his constitutional argument as well»
And for the convenience of the Court, in order to clarify this,
I have asked the Clark to circulate a. Xerox copy of the motion
to affirm that was filed by the United States in City of
Petersburg, and that was granted by seven Justices of this
Court, all of whom are present here»
QUESTION:

Isn't it fairly well settled, that when

wa affirm a judgment in the District Court we don't affirm the
reasoning, we simply affirm the holding?
MR. WALLACE:

That the Court doss not necessarily

affirm the reasoning, and that is why I thought it wise to
take a look and see whether there's some other conceivable
basis for the affirmance, and why I'd like, if the Court
please, to turn now to pages 6 and 7 of that motion to affirm,
because I think that the government there fairly laid bare
exactly what was at issue in this appeal, based on the
findings that had bean raado by the District Court in the
holding there»
And with the Court's leave, I'd like to just read a

28

short passage here»
Appellant argues that bscav.se the court below found
nothing in the annexation which indicated that it had a racial
purpose, judicial Inquiry in a suit of this nature, into the
effect on the Negro voter of an extension of the city limits
into white suburbia is foreclosed.,

The plain language of

Section 5, however, refutes this argumento
And there we quota that the burden is to show that
the change does not have the purpose and will not have, the
affect of denying or abridging the right to vote.
Then we say, the District Court therefor© properly
did not end its inquiry upon finding that the Petersburg
annexation was, quote, "a necessary measure to allow the city
to expand its tax baso and its potential for growth and
development.It looked further to ascertain whether, as this
Court stated in a related context, designedly or otherwise,
the extension of the city limits under the circumstancss of
this particular case would operate to minimise or cancel out
the voting strength of racial elements of the voting population,
QUESTION:

Well, is it your position that although

sa do not adopt the opinion of th© District Court whan we
summarily affirm w© adopt th© statement of th® government*®
motion to affirm?
HR, WALLACE 3

Mot necessarily, Your Honor,

But I

bolieva that by looking at this th© Court’s recollection will

29

be refreshed as to precisely what was before the Court and
whether there was soma other basis on which affirmance was
granted»
As a matter of fact, to a large extent, the
reasoning of the District Court was subsequently endorsed in
the City of Richmond's opinion», The reason why this decision
happens to be more closely on point is because hers the
District Court denied preclearanca to the annexation, whereas,
after appropriate adjustments war© made in voting procedures,
this Court upheld the annexation, and the City of Richmond
applying what to all appearances are precisely the same
standards on which this denial is based and was affirmed by
this Court,
QUESTION:

Mr, Wallace, it*® sort of hard to refresh

my recollection, because 1 wasn’t her©; but on page 8 of your
motion you point out that in that case the majority whits
Council had been generally unresponsive to the expressed needs
and desires of the blade community, and we have

i.

precisely

opposite finding in this case, don’t we?
MR. WALLACE :

Wall,

1

*ra aware of that difference

between the two cases.
QUESTION:

That difference could hava been critical,

couldn’t it?
MR, WALLACE:

There was a different finding here,

which, arguably, could make a difference either in the relief

30

that would be appropriate or in the finding of whether there
was a retrogressive effect,

But it doesn't make any difference

in the basic statutory constitutional question; whether, having
fouxxd nondiscriminatory purpose, indeed a purpose that is
referred to in one quotation we have from the opinion, in a
footnote on page 11, there's a compelling need for the
annexation 0
The District Court nevertheless was correct in
striking it down, because the city did not meet the burden
of showing that it nonetheless did net have an effect, in
the absence of ameliorative changes in other voting
procedures, in effect proscribed by the Act,
It seems to me that is the basic statutory and
constitutional contention that is being made on the other
side of this case, which would require the rejection of this
affirmance „

And I would jxisfe point out that again on pages

19 and 1.1 we laid bare that that was what was at issue in
City of Petersburg,
Here the diminution In the black voting strength
resulting from the annexation, although measurable, was
obviously less in degree, which is why I say the case differs
in degree but not in principle from the City of Richmond case.
And the District Court took proper account of this difference
in degree in devising the remedy, or, that is, in stating what
remedy would b® appropriate in order for preclearanc© to b®

31

granted.
The pertinent portion of the District Court’s
opinion begins at page 54b in the Appendix to the Jurisdictional
Statement, and there the District Court looks very properly
to the standards spelled out by this Court in the City of
Richmond case.
There was a two-sfcap analysis.

The first was that

the Court found the impact,because we find the impact on
black voting strength to be significant, a measurable retro­
gressive impact.

And we have spalled, out the magnitude in

that lengthy footnote in our brief.
We must inquire further, we must proceed to the
second step, whether the black community, after the annexation,
has a fair opportunity to obtain representation reasonably
commensurate with its post-anaajmtion numerical strength,
which is a paraphrase of the standard adopted by this Court
in City of Richmond.
And while in both City of Richmond and Petersburg,
a change to single-member districting was required under the
facts of these casas, in order to ameliorate the retrogressive
effect that the annexations would have, here because the effect
was lass extreme fcha Court refused to say that that was the
only possible way of ameliorating those adverse effects.
And, as w@ pointed out in our brief, there are several
alternatives that are open to tho city to ameliorate those

32

effects* The other changes in voting procedures, particularly
the change to majority voting requirement having bean
eliminated*

As a matter of fact, the Attorney General no

longer interposes an objection with respect to the Board of
Education elections, no longer interposes an objection to the
annexations for that purpose, but only because ameliorative
changes of one kind or another should be mad® with respect to
the City Commissioner ©lection*
And we have spoiled out on pages 40 to 42 of our
brief tha thras possibilities that are ©pan to the city to
provide an appropriate amelioration under the standards of
City of Richmond,
QUESTION:

Why does it treat the Board of Education

different from' the City Commissi©nore with respect to
annexation?
MR. WALLACE;

Well, fch© difference is because of a

residency requirement for City Commission elections, which
did not exist under feh® old procedure for the Board of
Education election, Tha residency requirement, in the context
here, was we have explained in some detail on page 41, servas
tha function of a numbered post requirement, and results in
head-to-head contests that, in effect, results in majority
vote requirements.
As a practical matter, that's foesn the effect of it*
And th® residency requirement could either b© drepped or

33
adjusted to a requirement based on the three wards that ware
later adopted rather than the nine wards, as we suggest;
so SiB to ameliorate the adverse effect of adding this larga
number of additional white voters wa have on the pre-exiating
numerical opportunity that black voters had to elect a
candidate of their choice, which was demonstrated in the 1370
election, when Reverend Hill did win a plurality on the first
vote. „
Now, the statutory standard, as we say, was, in our
view, settled in Petersburg and Richmond, and certainly is
described similarly in Boer and in other decisions, and has
bean endorsed by Congress in the Committee Reports with respect
to the re-enactmentso

And the constitutional power of Congress

to adopt those statutory standards was implicitly uphold in
all of those decisions«

Starting with South Carolina v*

Kataenbach itself*
There really have bean four dacl®ions under the
Voting Rights Act which show that Congress is not restrictive
in adopting legislative measures to taking aotaion against
only what could be proven to fee violations of Section 1 of the
Fifteenth Amendment»

South Carolina v. Kataenbach is itself

such a decision, and has in common with two others, Gaston'
County v* North Carolina and Oregon v» Mitchell, the fact that
the Court upheld a eon'graseional ban on the use of literacy
taste, in Oregon v* Mitchell a wider bang in Gaston County an

34

application of the ban to particular circumstances

upheld

that ban despite the fact that this Court had held in Lassiter
Vo North Carolina that the use of literacy test was not a
violation of Section 1 of the Fifteenth Amendment, or at least
had not been proven to be a violation of Section 1 of the
Fifteenth Amendment, such that the Court could strike it down»
QUESTION:

In that case; in that case,

MR. WALLACE:

In that case.

But the congressional province was not really
to overrule the Court’s holding in Lassiter, nor did the Court
itself find it necessary to re-examine Lassiter; InBtead, 1
think 'what the Court did in all of these cases is very well
described, if I may say so, in a paragraph of Mr. Justice
Stewart’s opinion in Oregon v0 Mitchell, and I would like to
quota this opinion, which was joined by the Chief Justice
and Mr. Justice Blaekmun, and this is on page 284 of 400 U.S.
"Because of the justification for extending the ban
on literacy test to the entire nation,1*--» the dials haza wan
being mads fey Arizona, that the ban on literacy test should not
b© extended to it «- "need not, because o£ th© justification

access to the

In the interest of uniformity, Congress may paint

with a much broader brush than may this Court, which must
confine itself to the judicial function of deciding individual
cases and controversies upon individual records, compare
Lassiter v, Northampton Election Board,"
The findings that Congress made whan it enacted the
Voting Rights Act of 19S5 would have supported a nationwide
ban on literacy testa
Instead, at that time, Congress chose to limit its
attention to the geographic areas where immediate action seemed
necessary, quoting South Carolina \r, Katzenbach,

Experience

gained under the 1965 hat has now led Congress tc conclude
that it should go the whole distance.
This approach to the problem is a rational one,
consequently, it is within the constitutional power of Congressi,
under Section 2 of the Fifteenth amendment.
And the eight Justices who reached this question
under the Fifteenth Amendment

Mr, Justice Douglas upheld it

under the Fourteenth Axuandsaent «- the eight essentially .agreed
on this point, tho disagreements were on other points,

Mr,

Justice Black’s opinion, Mr, Justice Harlan’s opinion,, and the
joint opinion of Justices Brennan, White and Marshall wer© not
in disagro@me.nt on this basis point about legislative power.
That there need be a rational nexus to the kind cf discrimia®"

36

tion that would be a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment, but,
as Mr» Justice Stewart said, that Congress can paint with a
much broader brush®
And as we show in our brief, there are re silly two
ways in which this legislation has a rational nexus®

One is

the fact that it applies in areas where there is reason to
presume that in many, perhaps most, of the areas to which it
applies, there has bean purposeful voting discrimination,
the effect of which can be perpetuated by changes without
this prophylactic device of preclear&nce provided, for in
Section 5„
And the other is that in light of the findings of
racial bloc voting that were made by the District Court in
this case, changes can lend themselves to the facilitation
and promotion of private purposeful discrimination, and
therefore are connected with the principle of Terry v, Adams
and other decisions of this Court under Section 1 of the
Fifteenth Amendment®
So there are two ways In which there is a wholly
adequate legislative nexus her®, a rational nexus with
purposeful discrimination®

And the case therefore falls

well within the principles this Court has previously settled®
On the remaining point, we *11 rely principally on
our brief®

It is clear in our view that the change at issue

her© were not precleared in 1968 at the time of the Attorney

3?

General preclearing the State law which didn't make any
specific reference to Soma.
)

As this Court pointed out in the Sheffield case,
which we think is controlling on this point, it hears re*emphasizing at the outset that tha purpose of Section 5 is
to astablish procedures in which voting changes can be
scrutinised by a federal instrum@nta3.ity before thay become
effective. And unless the Attorney General’s attention is called
to them, the purpose of tha Act will not be served; there
will be no scrutiny. Thara was no scrutiny of what changes
would occur in the City of Rome.

I

And, for reasons expressed in our brief, w@ believe
the Attorney General properly interpreted his regulations with
respect to the request for reconsideration that had been
submitted to him, and acted in a timely manner under those
regulations. And even if he had not, ha nonetheless had
interposed an objection within the time specified by the
statuta.

And we don't see why the protections of the statute

would bo abrogated by tardiness under the regulations in
consideration of the request for reconsideration.
QUESTIONi

Mr. Wallace, may X interrupt?

Will you

refresh my recollection on how a State may be relieved from
th© obligation to comply with Section 5?

You take the

position that a city may not bail out under ,any circumstances?
how does a State get out?

33

MR» WALLACE:

Well, there is a provision in fch©

Act for the bringing of a declaratory judgment action to
exempt itself from the coverage
QUESTION:

I understand that» What must it show?

MR, WALLACE:

The provision is set out on page 43 of

our brief* Mr» Justice.

It must show that no test or device

has been used during the seventeen years precedirg the filing
of the action for the purpose oi: with the effect of denying
or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color
within the entire covered jurisdiction»
QUESTION: Does that mean if on© county failed to
comply with that, that the rest of the State would remain under
the Act?
MR» WALLACE:

That question has not bean decided

by a court, but so far as X*ra aware that would be the meaning
of it, because there is no provision for piecemeal bail-outs
which would be for the reasons wa stated a vary impractical
way to proceed»
QUESTION:

So that the smallest unit in a Stats can

hasp th® entire State under the Act indefinitely?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, th© Act, of course, is a temporary

on© o
QUESTION:

The Act in .temporary?

MR, WALLACE:
QUESTIONs

Well, It extended »»

That's what Ka&aenbach said.

39

MR. WALLACE;

It was extended by Congress in 1975

to seven additional years, so it presently expires in 19S2.
Many of the advocates of the extension at that time had been
advocating a ten-year extension.

The Attorney General had

advocated a five-year extension. Congress, after lengthy
hearings, determined that seven years would be the appropriate
extension, and I'm sure the question will come up again in
13 32 o
QUESTION;

Mr. Wallace, if you're correct that the

city can’t bring an action to bail out, and we acre© with you,
is the

case over?

Do we reach any other issue?

MR. WALLACE;

Well, the city is sayirg that the

District Court erred in refusing to preclear its changes.

It

brought an ordinary preclaarance suit in the District Court.
So that that question is also before this Court. Those are
separate counts of the complaint, and the District Court
reached them and decided them against the city.
QUESTION;
MR. WALLACE:

So that we must reach the other issue?
Yes.

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentleman.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:05 p.m., the case in the aboveentitled matter was submitted.3
