MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-777, United States v. Crews.
Mr. Frey, I think you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
ICR. FREY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case began on January 3, 1974, when Carol Owens,
a student visiting Washington, D„ C. for a brief course of
study, was robbed at gunpoint and sexually molested by the
respondent in a stall of the women’s rest room near the
Washington Monument.
During th© course of what must have bean a most
harrowing experience, Owens had an extended opportunity to
observe her assailant at close range.

She promptly reported

the crime to the polie® and provided them with a description of
th© robber.
Three days later two other women were robbed under
similar circumstances in the same rest room and they too gave
the police a description of their assailant which generally
corresponded with th© description given by Owens.
Subsequently, on January 9th, two Park Policemen oa
duty at the Monument grounds spotted th© respondent who appeared

4
to them to fit the description given by the robbery victims.
They approached him and during a brief conversation were told
that his name was Keith Crews, that he had walked away from
school, that h@ was 16 years old.
After the respondent went into the men's room, the
officers conversed with a tour guide who told him that he be™
lieved respondent had been at the Monument grounds on the day
of the Owens robbery.

On the basis of this additional infor­

mation the officers detained respondent and called for the
assistance of the detective who was investigating the rob­
beries.

He arrived shortly and attempted to take a photograph

of respondent, but was unsuccessful.
He thereupon ordered that respondent be taken to the
nearby Park Police station, which was done.

Respondent was

detained at the station for perhaps as long as an hour, during
which time his photograph was taken and his school was called.
He was then released.
Several days later the photograph taken during the
detention was 3hovm to Owens, the robbery victim, in a photo
array, and she identified respondent as har assailant.

On the

basis of this identification he was arrested, again identified
in a lineup, and ultimately brought to trial.
Upon respondent's motion to suppress all identifica­
tions of him, the trial court determined that the act of taking
respondent to the police station was an illegal arrest.

The

5

pretrial identifications were a fruit of that arrest and must
be suppressed, but that the:'in-court identification of
respondent by his alleged victims had an independent basis
derived from their substantial opportunity to observe him dur­
ing the course of the crime and would not be suppressed.
The trial was then held.

Owens positively identi­

fied respondent as her assailant, and he was convicted by the
jury of armed robbery.
On appeal, the an banc District of Columbia Court of
Appeals reversed.

It concluded that Owens5 in-court testimony

identifying respondent as the robber should have been sup­
pressed as the fruit of the initial illegal detention of Owens.
Mow, we argue in this case for reversal of the judg­
ment of the Court of Appeals on three separate grounds, any
on© of which would be sufficient to justify reversal.
The first ground is our contention that the in-court
identification testimony was not a fruit of the illegal police
conduct.
The second ground is that under attenuation analysis
any taint, if it was a fruit, should be held attenuated.
The third ground is that in any ©vent, under the cir­
cumstances of this case at least, if not generally, the testi­
mony of the victim of a crime, particularly a crime of vio­
lence, ought not to be excluded as
rule policy

&

matter of exclusionary

6
Now, I’d like to consider first the question which I
think is a perplexing one of whether Owens* in-court identifi­
cation testimony was a fruit of the illegal detention of
Respondent Crews, a subject on which both sides have spilled a
great deal of ink.
It is a given in this case that from the time of the
robbery to the time of trial Owens possessed, on the basis of
her observations during the robbery, the ability to identify
her assailant.

Nothing that happened during tha course of tha

investigation of this case altered or enhanced that ability
except in one respects

Respondent was in court to be identi­

fied because of a chain of events proceeding from the unlawful
taking of his photograph, and of course if h© ware not present
in court, Owens could not have identified him as her assailant.
We stress the untaintad nature of Owens* inherent
ability to identify the respondent, while he stresses the use­
lessness of that ability without his presence to be identified.
What is really going on here?

Is it, as the Court of

Appeals and respondent insist, simply a wholly conventional
application of tha fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine?

Is

th© victim's identification of her attacker really no dif­
ferent from drugs seised from a houss during an illegal,
warrantless search or a firearm seised from the person of an
illegally-arrested suspect?

It doesn't seem to be the same on

th® surface, at least, to us, but let’s look more deeply and

7
see whether the superficial appearances are deceiving»
Now, w® submit that a close look at this case re­
veals what is actually happening her®, and that is that the
court is suppressing the defendant’s presence at trial on the
ground that the probable cause underlying his arrest and in­
dictment is fch® product of the illegal detention.
Respondent would agree, I think, that the court was
not suppressing and could not properly have suppressed Owens8
testimony describing the circumstances of the crime or gener­
ally describing her recollection of the assailant.
inconceivable that those things could be fruits.

It's just
Th® only

arguable supprassibl® ingredient of her testimony concerns her
ability to point to the respondont in the courtroom

and say,

“That's th© man."
Now, th® reasoning of the Court of Appeals in this
regard is perhaps most clearly laid out in a portion of fch©
opinion where they are actually discussing th® temporal proxi­
mity factor, and this Is at page 38A to 39A of 'toe Appendix to
th© petition.

Th® court says, "While fch© initial arrest and

fch® taking of th© photograph did occur on January 9, 1974, the
illegality in this case did not end on that date.

The eventual

r©arrest" —
QUESTIONt

Did not and on that date?

MR. FREYs

Did not ©nd on that data.

"The eventual

rsarrest and confinement of Mr. Crews and his ultimate

8
appearance at trial were all based on tainted facts.

The

government demonstrated no independent basis for rearrest."
QUESTION;

Well, on that basis I suppose yon could

argue that you could never try a person after an illegal ar­
rest?
That is —* based on any evidence, because you can't
have a trial unless ha's there, and if he's there, ha’s only
there because he's been illegally arrested, and hone® you've
got ~
MR. PREY;

In fairness to the Court of Appeals, I

think the issue is a little bit more complicated than that,
because the court I think suggests and I believe respondent
suggests —•
QUESTION;

You hops'it-.isn’t, though, don't you?

MR. FREY;

You may have an independent — no, even

if it is more complicated, we're still going to win this case,
I think.

But the court suggests that if you had an independent,

wholly untainted basis for probable cause, then there would b
no problem ©van though ha may have been illegally arrested at
some stag© in the proceedings, because you could justify bring­
ing him into court on that basis,
‘QUESTION;

That may be so, but you still have got him

there by an illegal arrest? you got possession of him by an
illegal arrest.
QUESTION;

Isn't it, in logic, my brother White's

9
suggestion inevitable?
MR. PREY %

Well, if where we’re heading is toward

fch© K©r~Frisbia kind of problsn, I will get to that in just a
moment, because I think ife is very pertinent fco this, and if
you will just bear with ra@ very briefly, I'll be right there.
What the Court of Appeals said ms the entire course
of ©vents was aescmplishsd in violation of the Fourth Amendmenfcj since apparently there was no independent probable cause
for official detention fch© wrong thus continued.

And respond”

®nt in his brief also suggests that, I think it's page 45,
Not© 37, that the identification testimony by Owens would not

h® suppresaibla if the government had untainted, independent
probable cause fco try the respondent.
And 1 think, although you'll have to ask him, that
he would accept that view even if the proceedings in some way
originated with an illegal arrest of the respondent.
Now, w@ are prepared to accept the notion that the
respondent's presence in court in this ease was logically a
fruit ©f his illegal detention.

What we do not accept be­

cause it ia contrary to settled law, is that his presences in
court is subject to suppression.

That a defendant may not

object to being tried on this ground that his presence in court
is the product of an illegal seisure of his person is settled
by the Ker-Frisbie lin© ©f cases.
And this Court said in Garstein against Pugh the

10
following on this points

"In holding that the prosecutor’s

assessment of probable causa is not sufficient alone to
justify restraint of liberty pending trial, we do not imply
that the accused is entitled to judicial oversight or review
of the decision to prosecute.

Instead we adhere to the

Court’s prior holdings that a judicial hearing is not prere­
quisite to prosecution by information, nor do we retreat from
the established rule that illegal arrests or detention does
not void a subsequent conviction."
Now, in ray view there is only one arguably material
distinction between the Ker-Frisfoie line of cases and the
present case, and I think that the Court of Appeals relied on
it, and I should address it.

The distinction is that in the

Ker-Prisbie line of cases, the probable cause to try the de­
fendant was possessed by the police prior to the time that the
defendant was kidnapped in violation of his Fourth Amendment
rights and brought to court for trial.

And I think respondent

would say that is a critical difference.
We say that distinction does not help the respondent
and we rely for that on the Costello-Blue-Collander lin© of
cases, and we have not discussed that in the brief, so I do
v

'

*/

want to stress it her©.

:

It’s the fruit of some further thought

in the course of preparing the argument.
He is saying,' "You can’t bring

to trial because

in affect the Grand Jury proceeding that found probable causa

11
to try me was tainted.

It was based on illegally-seised evi­

dence, this photograph and the out-of-court identification.
You have no business having me in this courtroom and therefore
the inchoate ability that the police already possess to have
Owens identify me should not ba usable by the prosecution be­
cause it canst properly be put together with her pointing the
finger at me."
»

Now, however, Collandar .establishes, Costello
establishes, Blue establishes that you cannot attack the in­
die tonent or your presence in court on the basis that 'that is
predicated on illegally seised evidence or, indeed, on the
general lack of probable causa to support the indictment.

So

if wa ar© right that respondent cannot suppress tha fact of
his presence in court, than the only logical basis for his
claim that Owens’ in-court identification was the fruit of
his illegal d@tanfci.on disappears.
Maw, I would like to present a hypothetical at this
point which I think is quite illuminating.

Let us suppose

that during the course ©£ the robbery Owens had a camera and
sha took a picture of her assailant, and whan she went to th©
police sh© gave tha polic© th© undeveloped roll of film, and
she said, "I think I hav© a picture of him on this roll of
film."

Sha also gave the general description, as she did in

this cas®.
While the film is being developed th© polic© officers

12

see the respondent.
on.

Exactly the same procedure as here goes

They say to th®nselv@s, "We'd better get his picture so

that we can compare it with what may come out on the film."
They get his picture, they compare it with what came out on
the film, and they say it's a perfect match.

He's indicted,

he's brought into court, we introduce the picture and we say
to the jury, "Look at this picture.

Look at the man.

It's the

same man."
Now, in our view this undeveloped photograph is the
same thing as the mental image that Owens had of the crime and
of her assailant, and w@ do not see how it could possibly b®
concluded in the photograph hypothetical that the photograph
is a fruit.
QUESTION:

Mr.'.Frsy, suppose you have an arrest, line

up, . and the parson is identified and he is then, a charge is
filed against him or h© is indicted, and the same person who

,

;g

identified him in the lineup is going to testify in court.

So

\

as it turns out, the lineup was invalid, there was only on©
person in the lineup or something, just invalid.
mines

What deter­

and let’s assume that that's the only reason for the

arrest, for the continued custody, was th© lineup.

Otherwise

they'd have turned him loose.
MR. FREY;

You're saying invalid on Stovall or Wade

grounds, or invalid on Fourth Amendment grounds?
QUESTION;

Whatever those grounds are, Mr. Frey

13
The lineup was bad, and if there hadn't been an identification
at the lineup, they would have turned him loose.

Now, cer­

tainly the identification in the courtroom isn't necessarily
barred?
HR. FREY:

Definitely not.

QUESTION:

And if there is some independent basis

MR. FREY:

It has to be found that it's untainted by

QUESTION:

Well, is that any different than this

MR. FREY:

Well, the Court of Appeals, and I'm sura

for the —

the —

case?

that my colleague x*ill perhaps be more motivated to answer
that question than I am.

The Court of Appeals believed it was

different because it believed that in the case of a Sixth
Amendment violation, different policies were involved than in
the case of a Fourth Amendment violation.

Thav said.what they

had her© was a fruit of the poisonous tree case under the
Fourth Amendment under Wong Sun and Brown v. Illinois.

And

therefore they said the cases like Manson that say you can
us© the identification if it's not tainted by the improper
out-of-court identification or not controlling.
Nov;, we say that they are at least instructive on
the matter of exclusionary rule policy.
QGESf£qn:

I would think this case would bs a

14
fortiorari from those cases»

Suppose the arrest is, the so-

called probable cause is based solely.on an illegal show-up
and anyone would agree that the arrest is invalid,
MR, PREY:

Well, the Court of Appeals --

QUESTION:

The arrest was invalid, they never let us

put him on trial, and he is identified in the courtroom.
MR, PREY:
couldn't be.

cases,

Isn't this a case where the witness has independent, reliable
basis for her in-court identification?
MR. FREY:

That would be necessary in Justice White's

hypothetical.
QUESTION:

And I would\in my example say that the

person has independent basis for the identification, the testi­
mony comes in, it doesn't exclude it.

The past cases pf this Court that have

dealt with the Wade-Gilbert-Stovall line of cases have
addressed it in terms of due process and Sixth Amendment right
to counsel policies.
Now, I think they are instructive.
helpful.

I think they are

But when we analyse the thing through, we did not

15

feel that they were necessarily controlling, in the same sense
that I feel analysis leads us to the conclusion that Frisbie
combined with Costello and Collander are necessarily control­
ling here.
QUESTION;

In those cases, Mr. Frey, wasn't it in­

dicat®! that the defendant can of course attack the in-court
identification by showing that it had this tainted basis, in
an effort to persuade the jury to disregard the in-court
identification?

Or tc undermine it?

MR. FREYs

Well, but those cases are concerned in

part with reliability, and I take it the Fourth Amendment ex­
clusionary rule, as the Court said in Ceccolini, does not
focus on the reliability of the testimony that is or is not
subject to exclusion.
I think that my colleague will be far more motivated
to press these distinctions than I am.
Now, if I can move from this point, although it
could be discussed at some length? to a second point which is
also hotly disputed between us, /in connection with the
attenuation analysis, we

— -excuse me a -second.

The Court of Appeals and respondent and we all seem
to be agreed that the focal or critical concern with regard
to attentuation, and I am now assuming that you somehow con­
clude that this is a fruit and attenuation analysis is proper,
/

is the gravity of the constitutional violation.

16
Now, our
in this regard.

submission is relatively straightforward

First we say that there is absolutely no

basis in this record for concluding that the police acted in
knowing or willful disregard of their constitutional obliga­
tions.

In fact, the Court of Appeals does not deny that they

had a reasonable suspicion of respondent's possible involve­
ment in the crimes.

H@ fit the general description? he was

identified as having been at the scene on the day of the rob­
bery? and the police had at least substantial cause to wonder
what he was doing at the Monument grounds on a rainy January
day,.
Now, under the circumstances it was entirely reason­
able for the police to detain him briefly, even to the extent
of trying to get his photograph.

Now, it may be, es the

lower courts hav© held, and w© haven't sought review of that
question hare, that the basis for their suspicion was not
enough to justify the further step of taking him to the police
station, detaining him for an additional hour or so, taking
hi© photograph and calling his school while he was being held
there.
But whether that's so or not sc, it simply, seems
inconceivable to me that it can be argued that their actions
wera a flagrant violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of
this defendant in the same sens© that it was concluded by the
court in Brown v. Illinois,

17
Indeed, I might mention that there are cases of the
%

District of Columbia Court of Appeals that suggest in closely
analogous situations that a suspect detained on reasonable
suspicion may be taken for a show-up to the scene of the
crime»

Mow, perhaps those casas would not control this case,

but in any event, I think there is no basis for concluding
that the officers knew what they were doing was wrong and
flagrantly ignored their —
QUESTION:

Well, the present posture of this case,

Mr. Frey, you necessarily conceded arguendo that there had
been a Fourth Amendment violation?

MR. FREY:

Yes.

QUESTION:

I'm correct in that understanding, am I?

MR. FREY:

That's correct.

But —

We do not challenge that.

W® do not ask the Court to review that, except insofar as the
Court reaches fch@ question of the flagrancy of the violation
as a consideration in attenuation analysis.
How, it's equally significant that th® scope of the
violation in this case was not serious.

I mean, compare it

to Brown v. Illinois:

Th© police break into Brown's apartment

when he is not there»

Whan he comes home -they grab him with

guns drawn and say he's under arrest.

They tak© him down to

the stafcionhous© with, mind you, no basis at all for doing this,
and they hold him for I think six hours, during which he's
interrogated♦

13
QUESTION:

Mr. Prey, I’d be interested in knowing

whether you think th© flagrancy or lack thereof of the Fourth
Amendment violation is a proper consideration in attenuation
analysis?
MR. PREY:

Yes, I think it is proper.

QUESTION s

You do.

Do you — so you don 9t think

attenuation is a matter of causa and effect, but it’s kind of
a balancing act?
MR. FREYs
fect.

It is not just a matter of cause and ef­

I think this Court5s decisions make that quite clear..

It's certainly not a matter of but for causation,

ir-

In Ceccolini I think the Court stated that we are
not talking about causation in the sense of the physical
sciences, but a different concept, and I think Justice Powell
in his concurrence in Brown, if I am not mistaken, said that
what we ax© trying to do is determine the circumstances in
which exclusion is useful as a means of controlling police
misconduct as. against th© cost to society of the result that’s
being achieved by excluding the evidence.
QUESTIONS
view.

I understand there is support for th©

I just was interested in whether you think it’s a

correct approach.
MR. FREYs

I think it’s definitely a correct approach,

yes.
Now, respondent repeatedly asserts in his brief that

19
ther© was bad faith and. that the officers knew they didn’t have
probable cause and that this was a flagrant violation» but I
have read it carefully and all I find are assertions.
Now» 1 think I’d like to conclude, because I want to
save some time for rebuttal.

Respondent in his brief has re™

peatedly accused us of using abstruse metaphysical concepts in
arguing this case.

All right.

Let's put sophisticated legal

argument aside, and let’s look at this case as an intelligent
layman might.
Common sense simply crys out for reversal of the
decision of the Court of Appeals in this case.

Thera is

simply no process of dry logic that ultimately can justify the
holding that Carol Owens may not stand at the bar of justice
and identify to a Jury th© man who robbed her, when her
knowledge of the man and his actions are th© product of her
experiences during th® crime itself, and not of any subsequent
polic© misconduct.
The D.C. circuit aptly summarized this common sens©
policy aspact of th© case in Payne» where they said, "The
consequence of accept lag appellant's contention in th© present
situation would b® that th© witness would b® forever precluded
fro® testifying against th© defendant in court merely because
he had complied with th® request of the polic© that he come to
police headquarters and had there identified th© defendant as
th® robber.

Such & result is unthinkable.

Th© suppression of

20

the testimony of the complaining witness is not the right way
to control the conduct of the police but to advance the ad­
ministration of justice."
Accordingly, for that reason and the others that I
have discussed, we submit that the judgment of the Court of
Appeals should be reversed, and I will reserve the balance of
my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. GARY KOHLMAN, ESQ.,

MR. KOHLMAN:

We, too, ask this Court to use common sense ultimate­
ly in deciding this ease, and we submit that common sens© dic­
tates that if there ever is a, case in which the exclusionary

rested respondent.

The police illegally ar­

They deliberately, according to th© Court

of Appeals and th© Trial. Court” s findings, violated his
Fourth Amendment rights.
QUESTION:

And they had a purpose.

So you would have a different case if she

had seen him walking down the street and went to a policeman

21
and said, "That's the man.,"
MR. KOHLMAN:
QUESTION;

No question about it; yes, Your Honor.

If there were an accidental encounter of

that kind?
MR. KOHLMAN;

That's correct, Your Honor.

But in

this particular case, the police at the time they made the
arrest knew only the following;

They were looking for a sus­

pect that was from 15 to 17 years old, was a Negro youth, and
had a smooth complexion.

And the police happened to be in a

public area, the Washington Monument, six days after the of­
fense.

They also knew that the respondent might have been in

that public area six days earlier.

That's all the police knew

at the time that they arrested the respondent in this case.
And they did put him under arrest.
The Court of Appeals, further looking at these facts,
saw that they put him under arx*est for a purpose, for a design.
They wanted one specific fruit:
testimony.

They wanted identification

The record is absolutely clear on that and,

in

fact, the police officers at the hearing conceded that, that
that was their purpose for conducting this flagrant unlav/ful
arrest.
QUESTION:

What if the policeman taking the picture

at the Washington Monument, right at the outsat, had succeeded
and got a good picture and she identified that?
here?

Would you b®

22
MR. KOHLMAN:

That is a closer question, Your Honor.

The respondent never had to address the illegality of either
the first detention, when they stopped and talked to the
respondent for three to five minutes, or the second detention,
if they had just simply been able to take his picture, because
this particular event went much longer.

This respondent, Your

Honors, was taken to the police station, held for over an hour.
E® was fingerprinted, searched, questioned, and his picture
was taken.
QUESTION;

How does that affect the identification

in the courtroom?
MR. KOHLMAN:
QUESTION;

As the Court of Appeals saw it --

As the matter, now, I take it, you have

adopted the standard of the intelligent layman exercising
common sens®?
MR. KOHLMAN;

Yes, Your Honor, and we do at this

point have an exclusionary rule, and if there ever is a case
in which th® exclusionary rule should be applied, it's in a
situation where the police hav© identifiable fruits in mind at
'the tim© they conduct th© illegal arrest.

And in this case the

record is clear that the police wanted the fruits of a photo­
graphic identification, a lineup identification, and an incourt identification, and common sms© dictates, common sans©
dictates
QUESTION 3

What would you say if th® police

23
illegally arrested, as they did in this case, to the station
house, and they bring a witness down to identify, he's identi­
fied and ha goes on trial, and they don't us® that particular
witness, they use another witness, another victim, this par­
ticular victim, say.

Would you say that that testimony has to

excluded beeau.se of fcha illegal arrest and the illegal pretrial identification?
MR. KGHLMAN:

Perhaps not, Your Honor, and the rea­

son for it is again the question of foreseeability, and it
would go to the question of the police's intent at the time
they committed the illegal arrest.

If they in fact had the

scenario in mind that Your Honor just described, than yes,
again, the exclusionary rule ought to bar that, as the Fourth
Amendment in fact does, ought to bar unlawful arrest.
QUESTION;

You're just saying that once you —

really, if you deliberately arrest somebody unlawfully, you
shouldn’t be able to try than?

MR. KOHLMAN:

No, Your Honor, not at all.

And let

me give another example —
QUESTION;

Well, you would if you would exclude this

testimony b£ the second witness.
MR. KOHLMAN:

Only in this sense would I say that

it should b® excluded, Your Honor, and that's if the police1 —
QUESTION:
they have?

Well, suppose that's fch© only evidence

24

MR» KOHLMAN:

If it 5s a situation whore the police

are in fact creating a situation as Your Honor described? then
I think the exclusionary rule ought to bar that.

If they're

setting up an illegal arrest to get one identification and

The only sense it’s a fruit is in the sense

that th® fallow’s in the courtroom? and h® is therefor© subject

MR. KOHLMAN:

AM my answer in response? answer to

25
the Court Is simply that if the police had that in mind, if
they had the idea of a subterfuge, that we will illegally ar­
rest the defendant, have hint seen at the police station by
Witness A so that we'll have a basis for bringing him into the
court so Witness B, his brother, can then make an identifica­
tion, then as we see it, that is a fruit of the illegal arrest»
Now, a different set of facts —
QUESTION;

Well, suppose they say,

"Let's just ar­

rest a man illegally, we really believe he’s committed this
crime but we don't have probable cause, but we’ll arrest him
and we'll get the evidence,” and they do»

They put him on

trial,
MR, KOHUMAN;
QUESTION;

The case that this Court —

Do you think the conviction should be sat

aside because of fch© bad intentions, which I think are not very
desirable either, but is the conviction vulnerable?
MR. KOHLMAN:

No, Your Honor.

At least as respondent

views th© Court of Appeals decision, it is much, much more
narrow than that.

In this particular case, the police had an

identifiable fruit in mind at the time that they committed the
illegal arrest.

If it's a situation where they just illegally

arrest somebody and hope serendipitously that other evidence
will com© to their attention, we submit that that might very
well pr@se.nt a different type of case.

It may or may not be

the fcyp© of case..that th® Court would want to consider applying

26

an exclusionary sanction.
Another type of case that this Court has decided is
Davis v. Mississippi.

Davis was illegally arrested and his

fingerprints were taken, and that was the basis for him being
in the courtroom at the time of his trial.

To the suprise of

the police, to the government’s surprise, the complaining wit­
ness in Davis made an in-court identification.

Now, wa don’t

necessarily see that as a fruit of the earlier illegality, be­
cause the police did not foresee that particular fruit.

But

in this case, the police clearly had that fruit in mind at the
time it committed the illegal arrest.
QUESTION;

It made no difference to your argument,

then, that the trial court here concluded that he would ex­
clude the photographic identification, but that there was an
independent satisfactory basis for the in-court identifica­
tion?
MR. KOHLMAN:
for this reason;

That’s absolutely right, Your Honor,

As the Court of Appeals pointed out, the

independent source determination of the trial court only went
to the reliability of the in-court identification.

Now, that

is a Fifth Amendment doctrine that has nothing whatsoever to
do with the Fourth Amendment doctrine of -QUESTION;

Do you think the Court of Appeals opinion

Do you

MR. KOHLMAN:

Well, to the extent that —

.yes, Your

To -the extent that the Court of Appeals opinion pri­

marily focuses on the question of deterrence, does it make
sense in this particular case, what kind of message are we
going to give the police in the District of Columbia based on
our holding?

Are we going to give them a message that they

can conduct an illegal, flagrantly illegal arrest, and be able
to profit or benefit from the fruits, or instead are we going
to give them a different message, that in the District of
Columbia, at least, that type of police practice is improper?
QUESTION:

Well, what kind of message are we going

to give robbers at the Washington Monument?
MR. KOHLMAN:

Well, Your Honor, this comas down to

the basic question of the exclusionary rule in the first place.
As we see this case, however,

it really doesn’t turn on the

message in the sense that the Court is using it, as far as the
exclusionary rule.
QUESTION:

Wall, you used the term "message,” I

didn 8t.
MR. KOHLMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

But what really is

operating here, and the whole reason that we’re in court to­
day, is because of a violation of the Fourth Amendment? not

28
necessarily the exclusionary rule, but the Fourth Amendment.
It's the Fourth Amendment that tells the police or should tell
the police that when they have a general description and no
more, that -they can’t make an arrest based on suspicion for
the attempt of trying to produce evidence.

It’s th© Fourth

Amendment that stands at the bar on January 9, 19™ —
QUESTION:

You say ’’produce evidence."

Do you mean

have a lineup in which someone, possible victims, can identify,
is that producing evidence? is that what you mean by producing
evidence?
MR. KOHLMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

As we sea it -~

Then are you attacking the very idea of

having a lineup?

No, Your Honor.

We only mean producing

In the District of Columbia on arrests

such as this based on, a photographic identification is almost
inevitably going to lead to a lineup, the request for a lineup,

situation where there’ll be a courtroom identification.

The

They had in mind all those

is that we have to exclude all those fruits, not just simply

MR. KOHUMANs

Your Honor, this case stands out as a

unique case on its facts, in th© sense that — as to fch® degree
of the flagrancy and the bad faith of the police misconduct.
And I think that’s exactly why th© District of Columbia Court
of Appeals felt it .incumbant to decide the case the way they
did, because it really is out of th© mainstream.

Th® police

misconduct here is mush much more s suere than is usually th©
typical polio® practice in th® District of Columbia.
QUESTION;

MR. KOHLMAN*

W© think of this ease and the decision

this case, because the out-of-court identifications were exeluded and the government was able, however, to introduce the
in-court identification.

And th© police, upon seeing that a

tion can still corn® in, notwithstanding the flagrant miscon­
duct, we submit again, the message to the police is very cluar.

QUESTION:

Well, we submit that that, again —

What’s th® message to tha police then?

MR. KOHLMAN:

Well, in tho3G situations, as this

Court has mad© clear, there ar© mixed reasons for suppressing
the lineup identification.

In part you want to deter th©

government from having counsel-less lineups, for instance, or
unduly suggestive lineups, and therefor© you might exclude
th© lineup.

But it would accomplish too much in those situa­

tions needlessly to also exclude reliable evidence at trial.
We know that th® Fourth Amendment, however, contem­
plates in certain circumstances, because this Court said so in

33

Davis v. Mississippi, excluding even reliable evidence at
trial, and that*» why ws submit that the independent source

Th© easiest case for applying th© ex­

You think this is raora flagrant and more

purposeful than the conduct c£ th® police in bringing Frisbi©
to trial?
.MR. KOHLMANs

Well, in Friable the police already

had, th® government already had probable cause, mid frankly,
excapt for notions of federalism, th,® idea that the police can

go into a neighboring stats and bring somebody back when they
already have probable causse, wh©a th&y have a basis for
prosecution, is not that shocking to respondent.
QUESTION 2

Wh@n they do it by kidnapping instead of

using th© §§stradition procedures?
MR. KQHLMANi

Well, as the Court has pointed out in

Friehie and in Ker, it could vary well b® that Congress itself
would.want to create remedies or sanctions against the
municipalities ©r government that actually did that, but as
far as Fourth Amendment law go@s, again, th© defendants in

35
those cases, the government did have a prosecution, did have
probable cause, and tha difference between the two cases is
exactly why th© ©xclusionary rule needs to be applied in this
particular case.

Because her® the government, the police had

nothing; they had no way of solving this particular offensa
unless they committed th© illegal arrest.

And they knew that.

They clearly knew that.
QUESTION;

They were acting in a purposeful manner;

do you mea» that they knew they were violating tha Fourth
Amendment, or that they intended to find out if this man was
th® on® who perpetrated th® crime?
MR. KOHLMAN;

In both sensos, Your Honor.

Th© Court

of Appeals found that this was a deliberata Fourth Amendment
violation in the sense that th® polio© knew that they did not
have probable cause but committed tha arrest anyway.

It was

also purposeful in th® sons© that they had an object in mind,
a .specific fruit in mind, and that is identification testimony.
So in both senses, th© illegal arrest was exactly what this
Court found in Brown v. Illinois, a situation where th© polio®
committed a flagrantly improper arrest and they had a deliber­
at® goal in Brown in mind as well, a fruit in mind in Brown,
and that is the confession.

And in a situation where you can

sea what th© police are doing or why they’re doing it, w©
submit that that is a classic situation where th© exclusionary
rule nsads to b® applied

36

Now, as far as the question of Frisbia goes and as
far as th® question of th© grand jury goes, we are not challeng
ing, and the Court of Appeals made it clear that we are not
challenging the jurisdiction of th® court to try this particu­
lar case, and if th© government had independent evidence they
could have elicited th© in-court identification, or if they had
other evidence they could have convicted the respondent in the­
cas©.

But they did not.

As it turns out in this particular

case, the only evidence the government did have was the in­
court identification, the very fruit that the police had in
mind at the time th® illegal arrsst was mad®.
As we s©@ this case, th© decision that this Court
makes will really 'be very similar to the decision that the
Court of Appeals made when they faced these facts, and ‘that
again is a question of whether or not tb

-auction police mis­

conduct in a situation where they have deliberately overstepped
th© line with a specific fruit in mind.

And if this Court up­

holds th© Court of Appeals decision, we think again the mes­
sage will fc© as clear as this Court had mad® it in Brown v.
Illinois and Dunaway v. New York, and that is that th® police
cannot overstep th© Fourth Amendment with a specific purpose
in mind, and if they do so, that that fruit cannot bs used.
Thera are no further questions?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
anything further, Mr. Frey?

All right.

Do you have

37
ORAL ARGUMENT BY ANDREW L. PREY, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. FREYs

Just a couple of things, Mr. Chief

Justice.
First of all, respondent states that th© Court of
Appeals found that th© police knew they were acting unlawfully,
and I simply have not found that in the Court of Appeals opin­
ion anywhere.

It is true that the Court of Appeals character­

ised the action as flagrant, and the basis for its characteriza­
tion of it as flagrant was that it was purposeful for an in­
vestigative motive.
Now,. the difficulty that wa have with respondent's
effort to use that as a touchstone is that it sweeps far too
broadly.

Virtually all searches -- there may b® a few excep­

tions — aro made for an investigative motive or detentions of
suspected individuals, and you may have the occasional case
lik© Ceccolini where it’s random curiosity, or a case where
they’re investigating one crime and sfeumfcl© across evidence of
another•

But normally it's the element of purpose,

b© th© ©nd of the analysis.

That can’t

It must fe© that in determining

whether this is th© kind of conduct that justifies exclusion
under the circumstances you look at the flagrancy and the
wilfullness of the misconduct,
How, her© it has been suggested that th© police had
no way of apprehending Mr. Crewe and carrying on their

38
Investigation of this quite serious crime if they didn't take
him illegally to the police headquarters to photograph him.
Now, that obviously is not so.
he was a student.

They knew his name; they knew

If they had realised that what they were do­

ing was illegal — which by the way had the consequences of
costing them the out-of-court identifications and which for all
they knew at the time might have cost them the in-court iden­
tification , if the trial court had not found that to bs inde­
pendent — they could have called the school system, said,
"Where does Keith Crews go to school?*

They could have sent

an officer out there and taken his photograph at school.
So it isn't as though this was a question of the
only way to enforce the law is to violate the Fourth Amendment,
which is what they seem to ba saying.

There were other alter­

natives.
.And the conventional deterrents© that derives from
excluding conventional fruits of an illegal search is, in our
view, ample to deter this kind of misconduct*

Of course it

won’t always deter it, but it's clear that the policy of this
Court is not to press the principle of deterrence inexorably
to its furthest point.

All one needs to do is look at the

standing cases to see that there are other factors that must
b® balanced against deterrent.
One final thing, with regard to this argument that
focuses on the purpose to gat a particular kind of evidence,

39
the consequere as of that argument is that in a case like Davis
against Mississippi or Bynum, which Davis discussed, the first
fingerprint taken from the scene of th© crime ought to be suppressoi, because th© purpose of the police in arresting or
rounding up people was to take their fingerprints to match
against the fingerprints at th® scene of the crimes,
Now, I don't think that there's anything in Davis
that remotely suggests, and indeed it approves Bynum with the
notion that at th© re-trial, you could still use that first
fingerprint,

And her© we say that Carol Ownes' recollection

of th® robbery is like that first fingerprint,

QUESTIONS

Well, the prosecution wants to introduce

at th© trial evidence of both th© out-of-court identification
and the in-court identification.
MR. PREYs

I think our position in this case is that

the in-court identification, if it were found not to be a
fruit of the out-of-court identification, would be admissible.

No, it's independent, everybody agrees
