MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in United States against Gillock.
Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed whenever
you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. McCREE, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
Mr. McCREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the question whether Rule 501
of the Federal Rules of Evidence encompasses a common law
legislative privilege analogoiis to that under the speech or
debate clause of the constitution that prohibits the Federal
Government from adducing evidence of the legislative acts of
a state legislator in a Federal criminal prosecution.
Respondent is a Tennessee State Senator, at least
for all relevant times in this litigation he was,* elected
from Shelby County in the State of Tennessee.
He was indicted in the United States District Court
for the Western District of Tennessee on five counts of
?
violations of the Hobbs Act, the Travel Act and the Riekle
Act, the racketeering and corrupt practices act.
It was-—these three indictment-these several counts
of the indictment charged him essentially with two transactions
in which he is alleged to have abused his official status.

4
The first related to an effort for a bribe to
prevent the extradition of a Tennessee prisoner to the state
of Illinois.
The. second transaction related to, in consideration
for a bribe, introducing legislation in the state legislature
to enable electricians who were licensed in states with
fairly lax requirements to practice their trade in counties
that had a more stringent requirement for licensure.
Respondent moved to dismiss the indictment and to
suppress evidence of his legislative acts.

The District

Court granted the motion to dismiss the Travel Act portion of
the indictment, but allowed the other two statutory violations
allegations to stand, but did recognize a legislative—-an
evidentiary privilege which would exclude evidence of
legislative acts in the prosecution in the United States
District Court.
The government appealed, and the case was remanddd
to have the District Court specify the legislative act
concerning which evidence could not be presented.
The district court again recognized an evidentiary
privilege specified the legislative acts concerning which
evidence could not be presented.
And the government has-—the United States Court of
Appeals affirmed the finding that Rule 501 did create an
evidentiary privilege relating to legislative acts, and

5

disagreed in part with the identification of certain acts,
evidence of which could not be adduced»
We do not quarrel for the purposes of this appeal
with the United States District Court's determination about
specific acts.

And the only question presented to the Court,

at this time is whether Rule 501 creates an evidentiary
privilege analogous to that under the speech and debate
clause benefits only a member of the Federal Congress.
We assert in our argument three essential points;
First, that the Federal common law does not recognize a
legislative privilege akin to the speech or debate clause
in the absence of an underlying immunity from prosecution?
second, that the separation of powers doctrine that informs
the speech or debate clause, does not apply in a case
involving a state legislature; and third, that admission of
this evidence is not incompatible with the due regard for
the independence and functioning of state governments.
On the first point, we begin with the proposition
often asserted by this Court that the government is entitled
to every man's evidence, and that a privilege that would
seek to keep out of a prosecution relevant evidence obstructs
the search for truth.
QUESTION;

General, how do you reconcile the

application of that principle in this case with Tenney v.
Brandhove?

6
MRe McCREE:

Well, Tenney v. Brandhove was a case

that recognized a common law immunity from prosecution—1
beg your pardon, a common law immunity for civil liability
for legislative acts.

And this was to—on balance, the

immunity protected the legislator in the performance of the
duty for which he was elected.
He was not immunized

from criminal liability.

And this is a case where the respondent was indicted for
violation of Federal criminal law.

And we feel that this

distinction is sufficient, because there is no interest in
protecting the legislator from responding for criminal
behavior as there would be for his non-criminal legislative
acts.
QUESTION:

Weil, isn't there some interest akin

to that spoken of in Mr. Justice White's dissenting
opinion in Brewster that if this man is offered a bribe
by the electrician—some out of state syndicate to introduce
legislative language favoring electricians, that

he will

thereafter simply shy away from that issue for fear that he
will be prosecuted, even though he in good faith believes
\

that such legislation should be introduced?
MRo McCREE:

Yes, there is validity to that point.

But the Court has never gone that far.

And we submit that

the Court should not go that far.
QUESTION:

And Brewster was a speech or debate

7
clause-MR0 McCREE:

And Brewster was, as you point out,

Mr. Justice White, a speech or debate clause case.

And

the speech or debate clause, as this Court has said, is
informed by the values protected under the principle of the
separation of powers.

And it is to prevent a member of the

Congress from being prosecuted either criminally or civilly
for anything he does in the way of a legislative act, and-QUESTION:

Justice Frankfurter, in Tenney v.

Brandhove, said that 1983 was informed by the common law
understanding of legislative privilege.
MR. McCREE:
suggestion.

Tenney v. Brandhove does make that

But subsequent rulings and decisions by this

Court have made it clear that Tenney v. Brandhove is founded
in the common law civil immunity of a state legislator, and
not the speech and debate clause.

Lake Country Estates v.

Lake Tahoe is a decision of this Court in which it is
recognized that Tenney v. Brandhove is not dependent on the
speech or debate clause of the United States Constitution.
QUESTION:

And. as you pointed out, Mr. Solicitor

General, Tenney v. Brandhove involved immunity from civil
liability.

This case involves an evidentiary privilege.
MRo McCREE:

An evidentiary privilege in a

criminal prosecution.
QUESTION:

Right.

8

And there's no claim that the respondent in this
case is immune from prosecution, is there?
MRo McCREE:

No, there isn't, Mr» Justice Stewart»

And we point out that where there is no underlying immunity,
there is no need to protect it with an evidentiary privilege»
against introducing any proof of any legislative act»
QUESTION:

And we've—there are also remarks in

certain cases, I should remember since I was responsible-—
MR0 McCREE: 0sshea v» Littleton»
QUESTION:

—where we've indicated that the

non-speech or debate clause executive privilege, or privilege
for Federal employees, doesn't reach criminal liability.
MR® McCREE:

That's indeed so.

said this on several occasions.

The Court has

And the privilege, the

common law privilege, or the common law immunity from civil
liability, it was recognized early in Tenney v. Brandhove,
and has been refined in subsequent decisions of this Court,
is not an absolute civil immunity.
It is a civil immunity from damages, but not from
injunctive relief, as this Court has indicated Bond v. Atlanta,
the case involving Julian Bond who was elected to the
Georgia legislature and was denied a seat.

And this Court

found no obstruction to ordering the legislature to seat
him.
Which means that the civil immunity is jus£. for

9
money damages, and not from injunctive relief.
Contrariwise, in the case involving Adam Powell,
Powell V. McCormack, I think it is, this Court said that the
speech or debate clause, on the other hand, immunized the
Congress from all liabilities, civil and criminal, and in
this context of civil liability, from injunctive relief.
And the relief ran against subordinate officials of the
House, but not against members of the Congress.
QUESTION:

In the Brewster case, to which you have

made some reference, it was not necessary for the government
to prove any—-or offer proof of any legislative act of
Senator Brewster, was it?
MR, McCREE:

Well, the Court—I believe in the

Brewster case, the Court held that there could be no
showing of legislative acts, but that the—
QUESTION:
MR0 McCREE:

It wasn't necessary, was it?
That's right.

If the charge could

be proved by evidence of non-legislative acts, and he
would be liable for that.

Because where there was no

immunity, there was no need for a legislative-—for—
QUESTION:

There he was charged with taking

money in consideration of a promise to do certain legislative
acts—
MRe McCREE:
act.

Which is not, of course, a legislative

10

QUESTION;

And I think the Court's opinion said

that the criminal act was complete when he took the money,
whether or not he ever performed any legislative acts
because of that payment.
MRo McCRSE:
Justice.

That is my understanding, Mr. Chief

And for the non-immunized act, there is no

evidentiary privilege to protect.

And this is what—-this is

one of the distinctions that this Court has made.
The separation of powers doctrine, obviously,
doesn't apply in the case of a state legislator.
only at a tier of the Federal Government.

It operates

And the state
*

legislator, if at all, can make some claim, as respondent
does in his brief, for considerations of federalism.
And we urge in our brief that the admission of
evidence of his legislative acts is not incompatible with the
due regard of the independent functioning of state government, because state officials have been prosecuted in
Federal courts for violation of the Federal law, without
any suggestion that, there is any danger of interfering with
theproper function of state law, state governors, state
legislators, state --indeed, state judges, for

Federal

offenses, are duly prosecuted.

And it's not like Usery v.

the National league of Cities,

where there was an inter«

ference with an essential function of the state government.
Here—

11
QUESTION:

Nonetheless, here you do have a

restriction on the legislator’s ability to follow his
normal instincts, or respond to his constitutents, in that
you have another force, a fear of Federal prosecution, that
may prevent him from perfectly honestly responding to the
judgments of his constituents.
MR0 McCREE:

That is so, and we recognize that.

We suggest, however, that when weighed against the desire
for relevant evidence, and to prevent the criminal corruption
of state government, that that is a small price to pay.
And this Court has never said that that price
should be paid, the price of excluding it.
QUESTION:

Well, why is it the business of the

Federal Government to prevent the corruption of a state
government?
MR. McCREE:

Because the members, persons who

function in state governments, are also citizens of the
Federal Government, and are subject to its laws.

They

should not be immunized from obedience to its criminal
laws unless there is a very cogent reason for so doing.
And it’s never been suggested that state govern­
ments cannot function and at the same time have their
officers or officials responsive to Federal criminal lav/.
In fact, it would be a scandalous proposition.
QUESTION:

Is it not just a coincidence that this

12

gentleman happens to be a state official?

He's being

prosecuted under the same generaly type of statute as in
7

the Perrin case which we decided last week, is it not so,
under the interstate—
MR0 McCREE:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

The Hobbs Act is--—

Well, Tenney was charged under the

same sort of 1983 civil complaint as any other private
citizen could have, as I recall it.
MR0 McCREE:
was sued to

But Tenney was sued civil.

civil damages.

Tenney

And this Court made a judgment

that the common law immunity for liability from civil
damages was not. too much a price to pay to allow him to
function in the capacity for which he was elected.
He was not indicted for a criminal offense, which
of course is a more serious matter.

We point out in our

brief—I think the case is United States v. Anderson, or
perhaps the style of it is Anderson v. United States—at
page 10, and we cite other cases in other courts, United
States v. Rabbitt, United States v. Maszei,

where

regularly

criminal indictments against state legislators have been
conducted in the United States courts.

And it’s never bean

thought, up until this time, for the consideration of this
Court, that that could not be done.
And we suggest that two of the three lower
courts that have considered the proposition that

13

Rule 501 affords a legislative privilege, have decided that
it does not.
The First Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, en banc,
reversing a panel of the Seventh Circuit, and the Third
Circuit, by dictum, suggest that there may not be such an
evidentiary privilege, until this decision, which speaks of
a ’’felt need" for this.
But we submit that the case is not made for the
"felt need," and that the price, as we point out, is too
great a price to pay.

We paraphrase Mr. Justice Cardozo in

our brief, saying that given these overriding Federal
interests, recognition of the legislative privilege would
simply entail payment of too high a price for whatever
minimal increment of security it might give to the mind of
a state legislator.
QUESTION:

In any event, the conflict is on the

testimonial privilege, which is the issue before us in this
case.

Not on immunity.
MR. McCREE:
QUESTION:

Not on immunity.
All agree that there's no immunity to

prosecution under these statutes.
MR. McCREE:
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

Exactly, Mr. Justice Stewart.
And that5s conceded in this case—
It's conceded in this case that there

is no underlying immunity.

And this Court has held, and

14
we submit correctly so, that where there is no underlying
immunity, there is no need to protect it with a legislative
privilege»
We suggest, of course, concluding as I began, that
the lav/ is entitled to every man's evidence.

And that

whoever would suggest that a privilege should keep out
relevant evidence, and obstruct the pursuit of truth, has
the burden of showing that there is a necessity for it»
We submit that necessity has not been made here.
With leave of the Court, I would like to reserve
the

balance of my time for rebuttal.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE:

Very well, Mr. Solicitor

General.
Mr. D'RAmus.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES V„ DORAMUS, ESQo,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT0
MRo DORAMUS?

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
Our position before the District Court, the
Court of Appeals, and before this Court, is that a state
legislator in a Federal criminal proceeding is entitled to
the same evidentiary privilege asserted and upheld in
Brewster and Helstoski,
This Court has never held that a state legislator
in a Federal criminal prosecution either does or does not

15
have a Helstoski--type privilege for legislative acts»
But the government concedes, or this Court has
held, that in every other combination in which a legislator
can get. into court—state court, Federal court—in a civil
case or a criminal case, and there are eight combinations of
that, and the other seven, in each case, a legislator can
look to the speech or debate principle for some relief»
QUESTION;

Do you agree that we're not talking

here about immunity but about an evidentiary privilege?
MR6 DORAMUS:
QUESTION;

No, Your Honor.

You don't?

MRo DORAMUS:

No, Your Honor.

The immunity,

which we have not asserted-QUESTION;

Well, I didn’t think you had.

MRo DORAMUS;
ment.

—-is under this particular indict­

The distinction between immunity and

privilege, in

our view, is in effect if a principle excludes evidence,
in some cases that may amount to immunity, because it
excludes an essential element of the government's case.
But that is an effect.
separata.

That is not something

If it's a privilege, it takes something like

corroborative evidence, as in Helstoski? it says you can't
use corroborative evidence.

That is privileged.

If it

had taken away an essential element of the government's
case, it would have been immunity.

16

But the principle, the underlying speech or
debate principle, is the same.
QUESTION:

Did you move to dismiss the indictment

on the basis that you were immune from prosecution?
MRo DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor»

And how did you fare on that?

MRo DCRAMUS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,
And how did you fare on that?

MRo D0RAMU3:
QUESTION;

And was that appealed?

MR* DO RAMUS:
QUESTION:

Not, by us, Your Honor»

Hm?

MRo DORAMUS;
QUESTION;

The District Court denied that,

No, Your Honor»

Well, it certainly wouldn't have been

appealed by the government»
MR» DORAMUS;
QUESTION;

That's correct, Your Honor.

So it wasn't appealed, was it?

So that's not an issue?
MRo DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, it was not appealed.

That's not an issue before us here, is

it?
The issue is one of evidentiary privilege, is it
not?

That's the way the Court of Appeals opinion was

written, and that's the way the briefs are written, and
that's the way the oral argument was made by the Solicitor

17
General.
MRo DORAMUS:
here.

Your Honor, immunity is an issue

If the privilege sustained in our particular case,

in some other case, that same privilege may give rise to
an immunity.
QUESTION:

May give rise to an inability to

convict, but hardly to any immunity from prosecution.
MR» DORAMUS:

That's right, Your Honor.

And

if that is the point—
QUESTION;

Well, which is right?

Are you right,

or am I, in my question?
MRo DORAMUS:

Your Honor, we—it is our position

that there is an underlying immunity, as the government
uses that term.
QUESTION:

Is that an issue before us here?

MRo DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

It wasn't mentioned by the Court of

Appeals.
MRo DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

It wasn't necessary—

The district court held that you were

not immune from prosecution, you just told me, and that
was never appealed.
MR* DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Then why is that an issue before us?

MRo DORAMUS:

Because that is the result of a

18

privilege in another case; not our case,
QUESTION:
convict.

Maybe the result is, an inability to

But that's quite different from immunity from

prosecution.
Do you disagree with that?
MRo DORAMUS:

No, I would say that's exactly

right, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, it was never tried, was it'5

MRo DORAMUS:

This comes on the government's

motion to review the suppression order of the district court.
QUESTION:

Well, if you didn't bring the'—as a

respondent, I don't think you can raise the immunity issue
here, because that would mean there could be no trial at
all.
And you haven't cross-petitioned, have you?
MRo DORAMUS:

No, we have not, Your Honor.

I

?

suppose that under the Helstoski v. Mener v

there is a

question of whether we wTould have an appeal, a direct
appeal, from a denial of our motion to dismiss.
But I do not believe that we have waived that by
waiting for the trial.
QUESTION:

It isn't just a question for- the judge

and jury, that you could not have appealed the order denying
your motion to dismiss the indictment; that's not an
appealable order, is it?

19

MRo DORAMUS:

That was our view at the time, Your

Honor.
QUESTIONs

It may not be appealable, but that

doesn't mean you couldn't have asserted it as a respondent
in the Court of Appeals.
You weren't the appellant?
MR» DORAMUS:
QUESTION;

No, Your Honor.

No.

MR, DORAMUS:

It is our position on immunity that

that does not make a difference in this case.

We go back

to the original speech or debate principle, and apply that
in a civil case or a criminal case.
Indeed, inthe Federal context—
QUESTION:

You don't draw any distinction between

the criminal and the civil?
MR0 DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, we do.

Well, the way you just said, criminal

or civil, I thought-—MR, DORAMUS:

It is our position, it has a

different application in a civil case than in a criminal
case.

For instance, you could move for summary judgment

in a civil case; in a criminal case, there's no such
procedure.
And we would maintain you would be entitled to an
evidentiary privilege excluding the evidence of legislative

20

acts.
And we would also point out that there's no
immunity in the Federal arena that you may not introduce
evidence of legislative acts against a Federal legislator,
but that does not mean that he is immune from prosecution»
QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR. DORAMUS:

And that is what we are asking in

this case, is that the principle be treated in the same
manner as with respect to a Federal legislator.
QUESTION:

Well, they're a little different.

The

Federal one is in a particular, written form; isn't it?
MR. DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

It's in the speech or debate clause.

And you don't have that?
MR0 DORAMUS:

Your Honor, according to the

opinions of this Court, we have a Federal constitutional
provision that comes from the very source that we assert here
today.
It is our privilege that came first, in Federal
common law.

The English experience.

The states, before the

Articles of Confederation, before the United States
Constitution, had this same privilege.
If anything, it would be our position that the
Federal written provision is more limited than the broader
scope of the common law.

QUESTION:

Doesn't Tennessee have a speech or

debate clause?
MRo DORAMUS:

Yes, Your Honor»

It's almost

substantially identical to the Federal provision.
QUESTION:

Virtually substantially identical.

MRo DORAMUS;

Yes, sir.

And as we point out in

our brief, this is a hallmark of state constitutional
government.

All states have some form of protection for

speech or debate; even Florida which has no statutory or
constitutional provision has a state common law speech or
debate principle.
I believe that the Court—-the government, in view
of the Court's precedent, will have to concede that the
Federal provision was modeled after the common law which we
assert here today.
And not only that, but the reason for the clause
is not to protect people from civil suits, but as this Court
has repeatedly stated, the instigation of criminal charges
against critical or disfavored legislators is the chief
fear that justifies the clause in the first place.
The--QUESTION:

You're not suggesting it doesn't give

protection against civil suits, are you?
MRo DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

What about a civil suit for libel for

22
a speech made on the floor of the House or Senate?
That’s protected by the clause, isn’t it?
MR, D ORAMUS:
QUESTION:

It certainly is, Your HOnor.

But—

Well—go ahead.

MR0 DORAMUS:

It is just our position that the

criminal immunity, or criminal privilege, came first.

Back

when the Crown was prosecuting Parliament, they were not
afraid about civil suits; they were afraid that they would
foe put in jail.
QUESTION:

Well, are you making a constitutional

argument here?
MR0 DORAMUS:

We're making a constitutional

argument—
QUESTION:

That the United States Constitution

forbids the Federal Government from prosecuting a state
legislator for a state legislative act?
MR. DORAMUS:

We're making a constitutional

argument in the sense that we look to other provisions of
the constitution to supplement what we view to be a common1
law.
It's not—
QUESTION:

I thought—-perhaps I wholly misappre­

hended this case; I'm beginning to think perhaps I have—but
I thought that you reliance, and the reliance of the Court
of Appeals, was on common law evidentiary privileges; not on

MR. DORAMUS:

Your Honor, it is unnecessary to

reach the constitution, because of—■
QUESTION:

But now you tell my Brother White you're

relying on the constitution.

The Court of Appeals didn't.

Your brief doesn’t.
MR, DORAMUS:

I believe that our brief does

mention.principles of federalism.
QUESTION:

That's right.

MR, DORAMUS:

And it mentions the republican form

of government, and it mentions the Tenth Amendment.

We do

not say, because we do not think we have to say—
QUESTION:

Well, do you say—is it your claim that

if the Congress of the United States said specifically in a
criminal statute, "This statute will apply to state
legislators for their legislative acts,” would you say that
you would be invalid under the Federal constitution?
MR, DORAMUS:
be invalid.

Your Honor, I would say that would

I would—that is a more serious question.

For

instance, if the statute said, "No state shall have a
legislature."
QUESTION:

Well, that's a different question.

That’s a different question.

Eut just a criminal statute

that without question applies to state legislators.
would say that would be invalid?

You

24
MR <, DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Well, let's assume you're wrong on that.

Assume you're wrong on that.

What argument in addition to
*

that are you making here, that Congress could not have
intended to include state legislators within the reach of
this particular criminal statute because of the common law,
or what?
MR0 DORAMUS:

Your Honor, before Congress takes

away from the state tb.i3 old and well-established right,
we thirk that they ought to specifically say that that’s
what they're doing.
The statutes under which Senator Gillock is
charged-—
QUESTION:

You're making an argument—like in

1983, this Court has said that Congress didn't intend to
invalidate, or not to recognize, or to set aside the
common law immunities.
MRo DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

Under 1983.

And you're making a

similar argument with respect to the criminal statutes'7
MR® DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

That Congress, just as a matter of

legislative-—just as a matter of statutory construction,
we should construe the statute as not reaching legislative
acts of state legislators?

25

MR. DORAMUS:
QUESTION?

At least that's one of your arguments?

MR. DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

That5s correct, Your Honor.

That's correct.

But it's also your position, as I

understood your answers to Mr. Justice White, that Congress
constitutionally could not specifically say that these
criminal statutes are available to be used to prosecute
state legislators, and that if, in any such prosecution,
the legislators were to have no evidentiary privilege
for legislative acts.

You say that would be unconstitutional

MR. DORAMUS:

Yes, Your Honor.

The—
QUESTION:

And just which section of the

constitution does it violate?
MR. DORAMUS:

It would be the guarantee of a

republican form of government, and the Tenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Fifth Amendment?

MR. DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

Tenth, Your Honor.

You're saying that the speech or debate

clause Is an essential part, indispensable part, of
republican government in each state; is that it?
MR. DORAMUS:

That.1 s correct, Your Honor.

It was

a part of the states long before there was a Federal
Government.
The government has taken the position that there

26
is no speech or debate privilege or principle at all for
state legislators.
Brandhove

That flies in the face of Tenney v.

and Lake Country Estates, which recognize the

common law as setting up a Federal coromon law speech or
debate principle.
QUESTION:

What!s your answer to the holding of the

Court way back in the early part of the century that the
Republican form of government guarantee is a political
question, and can't be considered by this Court?
MRo DQRAMUS:

Two answers, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

The first is that we do not depend on that for the result
in our case.

That is—-the guarantee itself is some evidence

of the Federal common law.
The second answer with respect to the political
question is that in Baker v» Carr it lists the type of cases
which are political questions.

I am unable to find any

case where the Federal Government has i nterfered with
something that has been thought to be such an essential
element of the state legislature.
And I read Baker v. Carr

as saying that it is

not always a political question.
1

QUESTION:

«,

Do you think Baker v. Carr, then,

undercut Pacific Tel & Tel v, Oregon, the early case?
MRo DORAMUS:

To some extent, Your Honor.

The government has argued that there is no damage

27

to a state legislature, no harm, if this is not—this
privilege is not recognized in a Federal court.
As the court found in Helstoski, there is harm
to Federal legislators, even for the introduction of
corroborative evidence.

And it’s an interference with the

same interest that is protected-—ought to be protected in a
state prosecution.
In fact, the threat of criminal prosecution in the
states vitiates the state provisions.

It's our position it

doesn't, make any difference whether there's one executive
looking over your shoulder over what you do, or whether
there's two? that the threat of prosecution by either Federal
or state—legislators is the same harm, and hurts the same
interest that are protected by the principle.
And perhaps more importantly, the state legislators
are pos erless to protect themselves against the Federal
executive.

This is much closer to the scheme which gave

rise to the privilege in the first place, when the Crown
could prosecute parliament, and parliament could not do
anything about it.
They--the state legislator is virtually powerless
to do anything against the Federal executive.

The Federal

executive can act, if he chooses, at his whim.
The government has noted a measured hostility
against, this principle, or against an evidentiary privilege.

28
Time and again this Court has considered the
legislative privilege; has weighed its value in relation to
the use of evidence at trials.

And in every instance the

Court has determined that the principle underlying the
clause has beenheld to be more important than the eneed for
the evidence.
It is a limited privilege.

It may be waived, but

it may only be waived in a Federal prosecution by a clear,
unequivocal and express waiver.
QUESTION:

Congressman—

Well, hasn’t the Court indicated that

a member of Congress, if he’s acting outside the reach of
the speech or debate clause, if what he’s doing isn’t a
legislative act, because a claim that—but he claims in
defense the Federal common law legislative privilege of a
Federal official, that that privilege, that common law
privilege, doesn't reach—doesn1t immunize him cfrom criminal
liability?
MRo DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

It does indeed, Your Honor.

Well, we’ve—but we’ve held that it

hasn’t.
MRo DORAMUS:
preclude prosecution.

You have held that it does not
It is not immunised.

The extra­

legislative act of bribery is not something that is
protected.
But what is protected*—and all we ask in our case

29

is that the fact that a Congressman standing on the floor
of the Senate and voting for a bill should be excluded; the
same protection that is given to the Federal legislator»
QUESTION:

Well, but you've—in order to really--

you really would want to elevate a common law privilege or
immunity to constitutional status then»

You would want to

equate it to the speech or debate clause, which is in the
constitution.
MRo DORAMUS:

Yes, I would, Your Honor.

And the

reason for that is because the Federal provision comes from
the common law.
QUESTION:

Well, this Court has certainly taken

the Federal speech and debate clause far beyond its
literal terms, hasn’t it?
MR. DORAMUS:
agree ^ith that.

Your Honor, I'm not sure I can

Because the literal terms are, "shall not

be questioned in any other place."

And perhaps in the

area of whether it extends to an aide acting instead of a
congressman, yes.
But the literal scope of the privilege is quite
broad.
The government has raised the argument that there’s
a different in the power of the Federal Government with
respect to injunctions, and that a state legislator may be
enjoined, while a Federal legislator may not.

And it

30

depends on Powell v. McCormack for that.

,

In ray view of Powe 11 v„ McCormack
expressly reserves that question.

footnote 26

It says, given our

disposition of this issue, we need not decide whether the
speech or debate clause, petitioners would be entitled to
maintain this action solely against members of Congress
where no agents participated in the challenged action.
It’s clear that you cannot enjoin a legislator
himself.

But in Bond v. Floyd it's also clear that the

Court could have enjoined the clerk to administer the oath
to Mr. Bond without ever enjoining any particular legislator.
The government has taken the position that they
have routinely prosecuted state officials.

The cases cited

in their briefs are prosecutions for Congressmen acting
outside the scope of legitimate legislative activities.
For example, they may not have any authority to
act at all? and they maintain that they act under color of
law, and they receive money for using their influence.
is not a legislative act.
those cases.

That

The issue could not be raised in

And that is not the type of privilege which

we’re asking for.
There should be a reason that a legislator is
treated differently in a state than the Federal executive or
state executive or a state judge.
the clause.

Because of the history of

A legislator has always been thought to be

31

different.
And tills Court's words in Lake Country, it has a
unique status and enjoys a unique historical position.
Indeed,, in the Federal arena, evidence of a president,
evidence of a judge, is admissible, the official acts of
those gentlemen.

But the evidence of the legislative act

of a Federal congressman is not admissible.
And that is all that we are asking in our case.
The government has mentioned briefly the case
0'Shea v, Littleton, and how official immunity has never
been applied in a criminal case.
That is correct, except for the case of in re seagle
where a United States Marshall was given official immunity
for shooting a man in California in the course of defending
a judge.
He—a writ of habeas corpus was issued by this
Court granting him official immunity for his acts.
More importantly for our case, when O'Shea v,
Littleton said, we’ve never extended official immunity for
criminal actions, it’s my reading of the case that theyrre
talking about the official immunity that may apply to an
aide, as in the Gravel case, the people acting outside the
legislative privilege in the—-who work for legislators-do
have an official immunity.
And it is those—■

32
QUESTION:

Are you arguing immunity now, again?

MR. DORAMUS:

No, Your Honor; I am saying that

official immunity does not apply--is not a principle that
this Court should consider.
Your Honor, the Court has considered the
separation of powers argument, whether the difference
between the coordinate branches of the Federal Government and
the state government, and the relation between those two,
makes a difference in this case.
I submit that it does—-it does not make a
different; that in fact, the power of the Federal Government
to act without any check toward a member of the state
government is a more compelling reason to recognize the
privilege than when the other branch has the opportunity to
respond.
QUESTION:

In that connection, can you give us

any instances of historical abuse of this kind of thing?
MR. DORAMUS:
abuse.

Your Honor, I cannot point to any

The Court has, in the history of this country,

protected against that abuse when it might aoccur.
To my knowledge, this range of
QUESTION:

cases—

When you say that, are you overlooking

the conflict in this issue in the Courts of Appeals?
MRo DORAMUS:
that.

No, Your Honor, I was getting to

Except within -the last several years, to my

33

knowledge there has not been a case into conflict.
It is our position that there are few, if any
privileges which are as well founded in reason and experience
as the principle that legislators should be protected from
criminal actions for legislative acts.
The speech or debate principle was established to
protect legislators from intimidation by criminal actions
by an executive, if the state or the Federal—the state
privilege pre-existed the Federal constitution.

The express

provision is drawn from the common law, and based on the
English experience.
QUESTION:

Of course, there are lots of common

law evidentiary rules that not only were not adopted in the
constitution, but are not part of the Federal Rules of
Evidence, such as the inability of a defendant in a criminal
case to testify at all.
That's just one rather conspicuous example

very

deeply embedded in the common law.
MR. DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Are there any statistics, or if not

statistics, figures in the briefs of either party indicating
how often, and how recently, state legislatures have been
prosecuted under Federal statute?
MRo DQRAMUSs
Honor.

We have no such statistics, Your

The statutes themselves are relatively recent vintage.

34
I believe the Travel Act and the Hobbs Act within the last
15 or 20 years? and

definitely

the Racketeering Influence

and Corrupt Organisations Act is within the last several
years.
QUESTION:

So Congress didn't really authorize

it until that time?
MRo DORAMUS:

Not to my knowledge, Your Honor,

unless a wire fraud or mail fraud prosecution under the
Isaacs theory could have been brought years ago; to my
knowledge, none such were brought.
QUESTION:

I understand your argument to be that

before our constitution was adopted, the common law was that
all legislators, Federal, state and local, were covered; is
that right?
MR0 DORAMUS:
QUESTION s

Yes, Your Honor.

And then Congress adopted the speech

and debate clause, which was limited to Congress.
Is that right?
MR„ DORAMUS:

Your Honor, it would appear

to be

limited to Congress, because it's in the section defining
the—
QUESTION;

Because it says Congress, right?

MRo DORAMUS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, can you tell me why they did that,

why they didn't make it broader?

35

MRo DORAMUSs No, Your Honor, I cannot tell you why
they did not make it broader.
QUESTION;

So I'm still in trouble.

QUESTION;

Of course. Congress didn't adopt--the

constitution doesn’t contain any speech or debate privilege
for state legislators in connection with 1983, and yet one
was found in Tenney V. Brandhove.
MRo DORAMUS;

That’s correct, Your Honor.

In fact

one was found for regional legislators in Lake Country Estates.
QUESTION;

In Lake Country Estates.

QUESTION:

Well, now can you give me the reason

why it was left out?
MRo DORAMUS;

Your Honor, the best answer I have

for that is that the constitution did not purport to set up
the scheme of government within individual states.

It

recognized that states would retain some degree of
sovereignty, but it did not propose to set out the rules
under which a state would govern its internal affairs.
Your Honors, before I close, I would like to add,
with respect to our initial argument on immunity, that the
reason that immunity is not before this Court is that the
District Court held that the indictment was not based on
legislative acts.
When the principle applies, we submit it applies
to criminal cases as well as civil cases, and that the

36

privilege is recognized in Federal common law, in Lake
Country Estates,

Tenney v. Brandhove.

The opinion below recognized an implied limited
evidentiary privilege.

The same privilege applied in

Brewster. This holding is a reasonable accommodation between
the interests of the Federal Government and prosecuting
state legislators, and the necessity to ensure the inde­
pendence of those legislators.
MRp CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Solicitor General?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H0 McCREE, JRe , ESQ *,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRo McCREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Just one or two very quick points, if I may.
My brother asserts a claim of immunity here for the
first time, as the Court has observed; and that's also our
understanding.
In answer and response to Mr. Justice Stewart's
inquiry about the large number of common law privileges
that were not carried over into the Federal common law,
in 1972 when privilege—a number of privileges were proposed,
superseded subsequently by Rule 501, which did not enumerate
them, wthis privilege was not one of those listed.

And it

would appear that if it were such a fundamental privilege,

37

that it might have been listed there»
In response to Mr, Justice Relinquist's inquiry
about the number of pending prosecutions of this kind, at
the time we briefed this matter, we were aware of only one
?

other, a case called United States v. Wall, pending in the
Seventh Circuit.

There may be others at this time.

We would therefore, asserts for the reasons—
several reasons that we make in our brief and reply brief
that the judgment below should be reversed.
Thank you.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The ease is submitted.

the abo/e-entifcled matter was submitted.)
