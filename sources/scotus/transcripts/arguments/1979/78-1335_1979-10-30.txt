PROCEEDINGS
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 78-1335, Village of Schaumburg against Citizens.
Mr. Siegel,, I think you may proceed whenever
you’re ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK M. SIEGEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SIEGEL;

Mr. Chief Justice, and ma.y it please

the Court;
This case involves one question, the question of
whether the First and the Fourteenth Amendments invalidates
the provisions of Section 20, paren g, of chapter 22 of the
Schaumburg Village code.
Thase sections require that as condition to
receive a permit for charitable solicitation within the
Village there must be presented a certified audit or
other comparable evidence that 75 percent of the proceeds
will be used directly for the charitable purposes of the
organization seeking to solicit.
Tlia ordinance covers both door-to-door solici­
tation, and the use of public streets and public ways
within the Village.
The District Court held that specific provision
alone, to be unconstitutional
on its face.

The action was initiated by declaratory

4
judgment action brought by the Citizens for a Better
Environment, an

allegedly environmental group that sought

a permit and complied with all other requirements of the
ordinance except the 75 parcent provision.
On appeal the Seventh Circuit held that the
ordinance was not necessarily unconstitutional on its face,
as applied to what the Court said was the more traditional
forms of charitable organisations? but nevertheless,
sustained a summary judgment, and held that the statute in
question—the ordinance in question was unconstitutional
when applied to an organisation which allegedly was
involved in the dissemination of information and political
discussion,
Our position her©, Your Honors, is first, that the
ordinance is not unconstitutional on its face? is not
unconstitutional as applied,
QUESTION:

At the very least, we suggest-**

The posture of the case now, we take

it that this—these distributions do involve the dissemi­
nation of information?
MR. SIEGEL?

Your Honor, that’s a question—that

remains to be—

pleadings?

You said there was summary judgment?
There was summary judgment.
And they acted—the court acted on the

MR. SIEGELt
QUESTIONS
MR. SIEGELs

Th© court acted on the pleadings.
find that’s alleged in the pleadings?
It’s alleged in the pleadings,

Your Honor, and it's denied in our answer.
We allege as affirmative defense is the fact that
a substantial portion of the funds in fact go to the solici­
tors and to the organisers of the group? and we suggest
that a summary judgment was improperly granted.
Wa think it's apparent from the Seventh Circuit’s
opinion that th® Seventh Circuit had great problem

with

this issue? it in effect held that this ordinance was not
unconstitutional on its face, but was unconstitutional as
applied.
ted yet we suggest that thsy—that that court
could not have reached that conclusion without some
evidence.

Th© only affidavits in support of the motion were

the very skeleton affidavits which appear at page 40 and
43 of the Appendix,

These affidavits, in essence, say that

this organization was created under the laws of Illinois;
that it’s a not-for-profit organization; that they maintain
& group of solicitors? and that they go from door to door?
and that they give out environmental information, and take
complaints„
QUESTIONs

Mr, Siegel, is this ordinance typical

of villages in Northern Illinois?

6
MR. SIEGEL2

No* sir* it is not.

This case was

initiated by the CEE against 22 villages and cities in
Illinois.

Judge Marshall at the district level sustained

summary judgments on a number of ordinances* most of
which simply required a permit* and left discretion with
either the police department or

-he

village board.

Our ordinance* we believe, is substantially ,
different from the other ordinances in question* becstuea it
does not vest any discretion in the administrative officers.
It sets forth what we believe to be definite standards
guiding the issuance of a permit.
And if the applicant meets all the requirements of
the permit, the Village is required to issue a permit.

And

that is uncontested.
Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals
treated the ordinance as, in fact, a mandatory requirement
if all the conditions ware met.
QUESTIONs

What about guys by national organisa­

tions * like Boy Scouts, Rod Cross—
MR. SIEGELs
QUESTIONs

I believe, Your Honor—
--and the likes

Are they subject to

this ordinance?
MR, SIEGEL%

Yes, they are.

And I indicated in

my reply brief the substantial number of national organi­
sations that have, in fact* complied with this ordinance.

7
QUESTION?

So that they have met the 75 percent

requirement?
MR. SIEGELs
QUESTION?

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Would your argument ba any different

if it were 90 percent?
MR. SIEGEL?
ness.

1' think it*s a question of reasonable­

I think the Pt. Worth case, which held an 80

percent requirement valid, indicates that it's a question
of reasonableness.
We view this, Your Honor, as not an attack on
freedom of speech at all, but as a police power regulation
in which the local community has made a determination that
in order to protect its citizens both from physical danger,
if you will, from annoyance, from disturbance in -their
homes; but also from what we’ve loosely referred to as
fraud; that wa have the right to require that when a
terrible organization comes into town and says that it's
soliciting for charity, that in fact it devotes a substantial
portion of their funds to charity.
QUESTION?
operate?

Mr. Siegel, how would this ordinance

And I*m asking just as a bit of information.

If

the sole charitable purpose of the organisation ware to
advertise, to advertise the plight of the American Indian,
or to buy advertising in periodicals lamenting the plight
of the Vietnam refugee or whatever, and that was its sole

8
charitable purpose, and that a 100 percent of its funds,
net funds, would b@ used for advertising.

And yet you have

to deduct advertising expenses under this ordinance, as I
understand it, before you count the 75 percent.
MR. SIEGELs

Well, Your Honor, I think if the

sole purpose was advertising»QUESTION*

Yes.

MR. SIEGEL *

--then the ordinance would permit

solicitation.
QUESTION s

It doesn’t say so.

It doesn't seem

to say so.
MR. SIEGEL*

Well, I don't—I think, Your Honor,

first of all, it doss say so.
QUESTION§

I think the section of the—

It says—it's 20(g) of Chapter 22 of

•the 'Village, subsection 2, requires the deduction of
advertising expensas before the 75 parcent figure.
MR. SIEGEL*

I take it that advertising is in

conjunction with the solicitation.
QUESTION:

It would not cover—are you suggesting

it would not cover advertising if it were directed at
public education?

Is that your point?

MR. SIEGEL*

If -she only us a of the funds was

for public education—
QUESTION:
MR, SIEGEL*

For advertising.
—and that was for a charitable

9
purpose, whether it be advertising—yes—
QUESTIONs
MR, SIEGELs
QUESTION;

Well, ray question is advertising,
—in a broad sense, certainly.
Because that's what—advertising

expenses is what the ordinance says.
MR. SIEGELs

That's correct.

But the advertising

expenses go to the operation of the solicitation.

If the

sole objective of the organisation was advertising, then
100 percent of the proceeds would go to the charitable
purpose for which it was organized.
QUESTION?

I see your point,

You—your submission

is that administrativa expenses of the organization,
including but not limited to—
MR. SIEGELt
QUESTION;
MR. SIEGEL2
QUESTION;

That’s correct.
--advertising.
We're talking about—
Therefore administrative expenses of the

organisation limits the terra ’’advertising”?
i
MR. SIEGEL; Absolutely. Yes, sir.
QUESTION s
for-profit

Your ordinance also requires license for

solicitations, doesn'tit?
MR. SIEGEL;

Yes.

That’s a different subsection

of the chapter of the municipal cede,
QUESTION;

Then, did the respondents here ever

apply under that section?

10
MR, SIEGELs
QUESTIONs

No, sir, they did not.
Did. you—'has it aver been interpreted

by the Illinois courts?
MR. SIEGEL?
QUESTION:
MR, SIEGEL?

This particular—
Yes?
No, it hasn't.

I cited in my brief

the case of Scott: v. Folia® Hall of Fame, which interpreted
or at least passed upon the Illinois Charitable Solicitation
Act, statute.
In that Act, there is a 75 percent requirement in
which the charitable organisation is permitted to deduct
the cost of solicitation before it arrives at. its 75
percent figure.
That statuta was attacked on the grounds that it
invaded the First Amendment? the 75 percent requirement,
regardless of how you calculated it, was an abridgement os:
the First Amendment, presumably based on the theory that
anything that they did in the course of collections was
immune, because ©f the First Amendment.

And the appellate

court, which is not, obviously, the Suprema Court, held
that there was no violation of the First Amendment by
putting that 75 percent—
QUESTION;

Did either party request the District

Court to abstain so 'that the state courts could engage in
some of these constructions ©f the ordinance?

11
MR. SIEGELs

No, sir.

the CBS in the Federal court.

This case was brought by
To the best of my knowledge,

•the state court has never bean asked to pass upon this kind
of the ordinance.

The CBE has been active, as -they say

in their brief, in a number of Federal cases.
Our position, of course, is that this is a
matter which is peculiarly susceptible to local determination.
We do not believe that this is really a First Amendment
case? 'this is a police power case.
QUESTIONS

Well, but certainly there- are consti­

tutional cases from this Court saying that you can't lodge
total discretion in the power—in the chief of police to
issue ordinances, and things like that.
But my thought, was that the constitutional
result may be entwined with how you interpret your own
ordinance, and that that is something that is a province of
the state court.
MS. SIEGEL:
Your Honor.

2 would suggest that is the case,

2 did not suggest that—-they filed a motion

for summary judgment the same day they filed their amended
complaint.

I was given 15 days in which to answer both.

And it happened very rapidly.

There was no disec very, -there

was no nothing in this case.
I think the record is very bare, as I suggest in
my argument that summary judgment is totally inappropriate

12
based upon this reoord.
QUESTION?

Isn’t lfc--I takes it from

reading this

ordinance that it wouldn’t apply at all to an organisation
that, cams in and said, ”Wa want to go door-to-door,

but

we aren’t the least bit interested in raising any money.
We just newer solicit contributions."
MR. SIEGELs
QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.
So you could go door to door, and put

out the word ©bout the environment or anything else as much
as you want to without any permit?
MR. SIEGELs
QUESTIONS

That8© absolutely-So this applies only to the act of

raising money.
MR. SIEGELs
QUESTIONS

That's right, Your Honor.
What about door to door, if they were

going to urge people to vote for James Johnson for City
Councilman and ask for a contribution to his campaign?
QUESTION*
it would apply.

It would apply.

Certainly, I suppose

Because that’s what normally happens.

I think it would apply.

in this case.

I would say that they would meet the

If they had paid solicitors, which is admitted
If they said, we want to elect James

Johnson? give us $10; we'll keep the $5 for ourselves and
we'll give $5 to Jamas Johnson.

That's the sort of thing

that this ordinance is intended to prevent.

Because we

recognize that there is a very serious problem—at least
there was in Schauraberg—of people knocking on the doors
at all hours of day and night.

And Your Honor, in the

Hynes ease said, that there's no constitutional right to
knock on anybody's door on private premises.
We feel the legislative body made the determination
■that whan all the funds go to a charitable purpose, we ar©
willing, particularly in the light of the other requirements,
to permit this Invasion into the privacy and the possible
threat to our householders.
But when organisations parade themselves in the
man,tie of charity, and in fact have

m

undisclosed amount

going directly to the people who solicit the funds, rather
than for the charitable purpose, then we have the right,
as this Court has said over arid over again, I think going
back to Cantwell, going back to Martin, certainly in Hynes,
indicating that this is*—that these are very important
public rights that the municipal government has full power
to preserve

14
As. I Indicate over and over again in my brief, I
think the closest case before the Court of Appeals decision
in this ©na was that Ft. Worth case in 1969 in the Fifth
Circuit where the Court of Appeals there said that

a

municipality can deny permission to solicit if the cost of
solicitation is excessive.

And they, relying on cases

that predated Hynes, actually

recognized this Court's view

that this was an important municipal interest.
So our position, Your Honors, is simply that
this is not a ease of prior restraint.
of interference with freedom of speech.

It’s not a case
We have no desire

to keep CBS or anybody else from spreading the message.
Our desire, and we think this ordinance is a
carefully drawn and a clear ordinance—our desire is simply
to protect our householders from the problems .of invasion of
privacy, from fraud if you will, from misrepresentation, and
to preserve what we feel is vary important, a constitutional
right, perhaps, almost as important as -the First Amendment,
that is the right to be left alone.
I think that in Hynes this Court quoted Professor
?
Chafee writing back in 1945 where he indicated that this
was the least likely type of expression to receive
protection under the Sixth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Well, why wouldn't it be just as

effective, if those are your aims, to require anybody who

15
wants to raise money from any of your citizens to have
written down on a little card what percentage of its budget
it spends for this, that or the other thing?

And lot

difference.

Well, do you think that—do yen

MR. SIEGEL:

All these—the religious cases,

Your Honor--and those obviously,, the Schneider v. Irvington
and Martin v. Strubbers, beginning with the Jehovah's
Witnesses cases, all involved door-to-door solicitation by
people who denote themselves as evangelists or missionaries

QUESTION?

They could do that without a license.
Yes.

MR. SIEGEL:

It's the question of collecting the

money that brings them within the purview of our ordinance.
QUESTION?

But they ware doing both, as were the

Jehovah's witnesses—
MR. SIEGEL?

They were doing both, and we were

denied the opportunity to inquire into just what in fact
they were doing.
I trust that Your Honors will look at the
affidavit© on page 40 and 43, and perhaps look at that
District Court case, the Smith case, where they say the
major constitutional questions should not be decided on
motions for summary judgment, that the record should be
fleshed out.
Mid we were prepared to flesh out the record.
We war© prepared to show & substantial number of organica™
tions, only © portion sf which I've listed in my reply
brief, who operate, and operate vary efficiently, under
our ordinance.
I think, Your Honors, that there are certain

18
basia constitutional propositions which ara dispositive of
the ease here.
First of all , w® believe that Hynes v. Grade 11
holds there is no right under the constitution to knock
on a private person's door for any purpose.
We believe there is no constitutional right to
make public solicitation of funds for charity.

I cite the

National Foundation v3 City of Ft. Worth.
We believe, both under the National Foundation case,
and actually implicit in the opinion of the

Court of Appeals

in this case, that a municipality can deny permission
to solicit if the cost of solicitation is excessive.
1 think the court below in this case recognised
that.

In this Court, in Hynes v. Oradall, citing Martin

v. Stgathers, citing Cantwell, said that there are
important municipal interests at stake, and these include
protection of fraud, peaceful enjoyment of one’s home, and
prevention of crime.
Also, this Court has always

held that time,

place and manner, even assuming the exercise of a First
Amendment right, was critical? the nature of the form is
important.
The right of privacy in the home is to be
protected.
Heights,

And of course in the Lehman v. City of Shaker
both the majority opinion and the concurring

19
opinion ara heavily weighted toward 'die fact that no one
should be subjected to unasked for bombardments of
voices or conversation or music or anything under the guise
of the First Amendment.
QUESTIONs

Welly except—except this ordinance

doesn't, at least by its tarns, direct itself to protecting
the privacy of homeowners and leasees, but rather, with the

But when the, if you will, quasi™

QUESTIONS

And that was its purpose, to protect

the cifcisjanry from soma sort of species of fraud, not in
the technical sens®, hut of beings-paying out their money
thinking it was going to a cause, a worthy cause, and—
MR. SIEGELs
QUESTIONS

Exactly.
--and more than 25 percent of it was

not going to the cause.
MR. SIEGELs
QUESTIONS

That's correct, Your Honor.
But that's different from protecting

the privacy of households.
MR. SIEGELs

Well, I think there are two or

three different bases which are served by this type of
ordinance.

One—and these - are coupled together in the

cases, from Cantwell on down—fraud, misrepresentation,
privacy, crime; the litany is recited in all of these
cases, because these are fundamental aspects of the police
power which the municipalities have always held—been
held to have the power.
Now1 it happens in Illinois that towns over
23,000 such as Schaumburg are home rule, and we get our
home rule police power directly from the constitution.
So we didn't have to go through the intermediate question
of whether ’there's & statute.

And we do have the authority

21
to regulat® and to enact ordinances in any area where the
general assembly has the authority? and there's no question
that the regulation of charity is, in fact, a proper
exercise of the state8s police power.
QUESTION:

Mr. Siege1, is there anything in the

record or the ordinance itself to explain how the village
fathers came up with the figure, 75 percent?
MR. SIEGEL:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

I can

We looked--

we looked at the state statute, the 75 percent restriction.
QUESTION:
MR. SIEGEL:

Is it the same restriction as-No, it is not.

MR. SIEGEL:

Right.

MR. SIEGELs

And 1 felt at that time that

We could have taken

could have taken 80 percent.
But that, to my mind, that opinion—

And if Ft. Worth had been a hundred

you could have taken 95.
MR, SIEGELs

Wall, perhaps we would have.

I

think if Ft, Worth had said there was an absolute bar, w©
might have considered that.
But it didn't say that, and this Court denied

So ws assumed -chat for—at -that time at least there

we were able t© find on this particular subject* and we had
a state statute which recognised that the 75 percent
cutoff was a reasonable cutoff as between what is administra­
tive and what is otherwise.
That would—non© of that's in the record.

affidavits.
We had both a ©worn complaint and supporting
affidavits, and those contained very specific references
to precisely the kind of activity that was involved here
with Citizens for a Batter Environment.
What Citizens for a Better Environment concedadly
does, on this record, is to employ canvassers who are
engaged in door-to-door activity in the metropolitan area
who distribute literature on environmental topics and
answer questions ©f an environmental nature when posedj
solicit contributions to financial support the organization
in this program) like traditional charities, this
organization does not survive on air, although it deals
with air.
On© of its purposes, if it’s going to disseminate
literature, is that it has to

have funds with which to do

it.
QUESTIONs

Suppose the ordinance prohibited all

solicitations for funds entirely.

Do you think it would be

unqonstitutional?
MR. SHADURs

Your Honor, it would be unconstitu­

tional as applied to organizations that require the
obtaining of funds in order to exercise First Amendment
rights.
QUESTION?

Well, thay all-can you think of any

25
organisation that would not require funds to conduct—
MR. SHADUR*

Your Honor, I would—I think that

perhaps, although I can't read the mind of the Seventh
Circuit, 1 think that perhaps the reference to the tradition­
al form of charitable organisation, as distinct from -the
kind her© that is directly involved in programmatic
activity, is the possibility that fund raising for charities
alone may not carry with it—and 1 don't, perceive the specific
exampla“-but could not carry—’necessarily carry with it the
desire to communicate ideas.
1 would think that the traditional charities
ar© subject to the same provisions that, the American
Cancer Society, which wants to educate the public on issues
of cancer, and needs funds in order to do that, would also
be in a position to attach the ordinance that Your Honor
suggest® as unconstitutional.
QUESTIONS

Well, an ordinance says that—a city

doesn't say you can't canvass and spread your ideas? you
can spread them all you want to,
raise money door -to door.

But it says you just can't

Raise it any other way, by the

mail or by meetings? do it any way you want to.

But just

stay away from doors in raising money.
Now, you say that’s unconstitutional?
MR. SHADURs

Yes, Your Honor»

I think that just

staying away from say dooi.% to quote the old song, is

26

really inappropriate, in light of the decisions of this
Court0

lt°s been true for at least 40 years.
QUESTION:

But it wouldn’t ba unconstitutional

to say, stay away from all the doors that have signs on
them: "Stay Away»”
MR. SHADURs

That’s correct, Your Honor.

The

reason it would not be unconstitutional is that that places
the judgment exactly where this Court says that it should
be.

It places that judgment on the individual householders,

not in the community.
The community is not in a position to make a
collective judgment for everyone, that may be very, differant
from what the individual judgment.
QUESTION:

Well, do you have any cases that

say that raising money is speech?
MR. SHADUR:

Not raising money alone, but

raising money for purposes—

But Your Honor—
tod it doesn’t—-it doesn’t prevent

spreading the word.
Where is the authority for the fact that raising

27
money is speech?
MR. SHADUR:

Beginning with this Court's decision

in Martin ?t Struthars, for example, when we're dealing with
the—when we're dealing with the raising of money-™»
QUESTION2

Tell me anyone of those cases that

involved only solicitation.

In those cases,, if yon wanted

to go around and canvass or solicit, you had to gst a
license.
MR. SHADURs

But Your Honor, if the organisation

were raising money for the sake of raising money, then
you would be dealing with a for-profit organisation.

The

for-profit organisation that may not be engaged in communi­
cations would have no protection by the First Amendment.
But the organisation that raises money for its
purposes, for its purposes being the charitable purposes,
which is what this ordinance talks about.

And those—and

after all, that's precisely what the ordinance is directed
at, the raising of money for charitable purposes.
QUESTION2

Well, could you forbid the people

trying to sail magazines from door to door?

Schaumburg might have done with an ordinance-™
QUESTIONS

The case before the Court is an

ordinance that forbids only solicitation for money? talk
about that.
MR. SHADUR:

m,

I a

Your Honor,

It forbids

solicitation for money by charitable organisations, and
it’s being attacked by an organisation that wants to
.solicit those funds to permit it to engage in First
Amendment rights.
QUESTION;

What, Mr. Shadur, if the ordinance,

instead of requiring satisfactory proof that at least 75
percent of -the proceeds of the solicitations would foe used
for the charitable purposes, said that if—before issuing
a license it would require satisfactory proof that at least
t

some of the proceeds of such solicitations would be used
for the charitable purposes?
MR. SHADUR;

Your Honor, if we were dealing with

a requirement that dealt directly with the question of
bona fide, which is what that ordinance would deal with,
that is, that at least one percent, at least some of the
funds are used, under those circumstances, the community
could seek to justify the organisation—could seek to justify

29
the ordinance as a means of preventing fraud.

But 1 would

call Your Honor’s attention to one—
QUESTION?

Well, that’s really the basis on which

the ordinance is sought to be justified her©,
MR, SHABURs

Your Honor, let me, however, give you

the examples—
QUESTION %
MR. SE&DURs

So is the argument about the 75 percent?
No, Your Honor, it is not.

Take

the organisation that’s just starting up, the organization
that by definition has to use all of its initial funds
for administrative functions to permit it in that first,
year—that’s an example that’s been given by one of the
amicis here, the organisation that's in its first year, in
order to gat itself started on what is concede cl ly a
charitable purpose, must nevertheless use those initial
funds for purposes of getting itself geared up.
QUESTIONS

So in short, if instead of 75 percent

the ordinance said, at least some, it would be equally
invalid?
MR. SKADUR t

MR. SHABURs

As—
It would also b® invalid, in any event,.
On over-breadth grounds, although

MR. SKADURs

30
QUESTIONS

I just thought it's violating the

First and Fourteenth Amendments.
MR. SHADURs

Yes, Your Honor, that's what I

meant by over-breadth grounds, the First Amendment.
Let me—let ms

return to what we're dealing with

hare in terms of the organisation,, and what this ordinance
seeks to do.
This ordinance characterizes charitable purpose
in a sort of extraordinary way.

Because it doesn't say

charitable purpose in a way that, for example, the state's—
the state statute deals with.
This characterises charitable purpose-“-and nowhere
in counsel's reply brief or anywhere else has this been
denied—as applying to all salaries or commissions -that are
paid to canvassers, even though, on the uncontradicted
record, they're people who in addition to soliciting funds
exercise rights that are First Amendment rights.
It excludes all other salaries, yet this is an
organization, an environmental organization, that has on
its staff—and has to pay for—an in-house research staff,
an expert on nuclear power, a physicist, a biochemist, a
geneticist.

All thos© funds that are used for that

purpose are part of the prohibited 25 percent, and not
part of ‘the permitted 75 percent.
Lawyers9 fees are characterized as part of the

31
non-permitted amount, yet the organization that98 involved
in environmental activities, by definition, is constantly
dealing with the structura of the environment; that means
dealing with the government, dealing with the private
utilities; and it has to engage in enforcement activities.
QUESTION %

Mr. Shadur, could your client have

gotten' a license under article II rather than article I?
MR. SHADUR:

Your Honor, our organization is not

a for-profit organization.

But, in response to your

question, if our—i£ our organisation had to cope with the
provisions of article II, then we would read directly,
as the patent lawyers would have it, on the cases that this
court has dealt with early in these areas, and that is
saying that giving discretion to the public officials is
not permitted.

Because the second portion of this ordinance

requires--provides—and I'm reading now from record pages—
page 19 in the Appendix—when the chief of police makes, or
causas to he made, an investigation to determine the
character and reputation of the applicant, and that no
license shall be issued to an applicant who is not found to
be a person of good character and reputation, or to any
firm, corporation, partnership or association.
Under those circumstances, what happens is that
power is vested in the municipal official to make that kind
of determination, and the decisions of this Court say that

32
that9@ not permitted,,
QUESTION?

Well, you say, in effect, then, there5s

no way that a municipal corporation can accomplish the
result that they want to accompli ah her©.

They can’t do it

by lodging discretion in the chief of police, and they can’t
do it by the objective profile that they've attempted to do
under Article I.
You’re saying, in effect, that people can. come
around and solicit money, and that there’s simply nothing
they can do about it.
MB. SHABURs

Well, no, Your Honor, I haven't said

that at all.

But what’s wrong here is that that’s very
different from this ease.

What is done here is to create a

sort of conclusive line that says 75.1 is not fraudulent?
74.9 is fraudulent,

tod in which the standards that are

employed in going to those percentages has no relationship
at all to 'the concept of fraud.
There's nothing in the activity that Citisens
for a Better Environment is engaged in as established by
the record in this casse, by these affidavits, that goes
into the prohibitive side of it, that constitutas
fraudulent activity.
All of these things serve the direct First
Amendment rights, and serve the functions of the public as
well.

We’re dealing with both sides of the coin.
QUESTIONt

What if the solicitors for CBE take

the money they’ve raised in two weeks of soliciting and
just take it to the Caribbean?
MR. SHADURs

In that case, Your Honor, there are

statutes that permit that? indeed, it was precisely that
kind of activity that gave rise to the Police Hall of Fame
ease that was tried, and the Council ha© referred to, and
that was the unfortunate genesis of this very different
kind of ordinance.

first mad® in Martin v» Stgutfoera, and that I believe

And there's

nothing wrong with requiring that kind of evidence.
QUESTIONS

Wsll? what's the difference in the

constitutionality of doing it individually and collectively?
MR. SHADURs

The difference. Your Honor, is the

question of who does it. individua}.ly and who does it
collectively.
When it's done individually, no ■ matter by how
many individuals, the individuals ara making a judgment for
themselves.

When it’s done collectively, in the way that

the Village of Sehauburg has sought to do it, it's a sort
of Big Brother activity that operates whether or not the
individual-individuals who also have First Amendment
rights.

The individuals have First Amendment rights to

hear messages.

They also have First Amendment rights to

communicata their complaints.

That’s, as 1 say, the other

side of both coins that Citizens for a Batter Environment

37
is engaged in.
That's a very different kind of standard.
QUESTION s

And—

Well—

MR, SHADURs
QUESTIONt

Yea, Your Honor?
—could the Village reverse the

presumption you're talking about and say that soliciting
is prohibited except on property where there is a
soliciting

permitted sign?
MR. SEABORe

1 think that would present very

serious constitutional problems.

And the reason that I

think that is that—that you would have to have coupled
with that somehow the notion that all people are presumed
to know the law in a vary literal sense, as distinct from
tha theoretical sense
it.

in which the law usually treats with

QUESTIONS

But the Martin ordinance presumed

that they knew—that they had to know the law that they
would have to post a no-soliciting sign,
MR. SEADUR;

Yes, Your Honor, because when you

deal with First Amendment rights, you have to have anarrowly
drawn statutes.

I would suggest that a presumption that

33
flip-flops in the manner that Your Honor lias suggested
would be a serious impediment.
QUESTION:

Well, where is the First Amendment

right to the unregulated solicitation of funds?
MR, SHADURg
QUESTION:

But Your Honor, this isn* t—~
Unregulated,

MR, SH&DURs

But Your Honor,. 1 must return to the

refrain that what we8re dealing with here is not the
solicitation of funds in a vacuum.

What wa’re dealing with

hors is the solicitation of funds that's irrevocably
coupled with and tied to the exercise of speech rights.
It's not that they're-—they're not raising funds
to go to the Carribsan.

They are raising funds 30 that

they can deliver messages dealing with the environment?
so that they can engage in educational activities dealing
with the environment? so that they can take complaints
dealing with the environment? so they will know what kind
of positions to take in litigation, in connection with
legislation.

All those things are not simply the raising

of funds.
They’re the raising of funds which, necessarily
carries with it the tie-in with the exercise of First
Amendment.
That's a notion that -this Court has accepted
ever since the Jehovah's Witnesses cases.

The Jehovah's

39
Witnesses cases road© the strong point that the--that it is
the poor organisation,, the one that is most often in need
of the ns© of funds to exercise First Amendment rights to
whom this privilege is the most important.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Yarmolinski?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM YARMOLINSKX, ESQ.,
AS AMICI CURIAE OH BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR, YARMOLXHSXIs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I propose to argue briefly two points.

First, the

ordinance is constitutionally invalid not only as to so-called
advocacy organisations, but also as to more traditional
charitable organisations.
Second, in assessing the constitutionality of
this ordinans®, one must bear in mind the developing
patchwork ©f other local ordinances not addressed to interests
appropriate for local government to protect, and having a

particularly chilling effect on the fundraising efforts
of national, voluntary charitable organisations.
QUESTION•

National?

MR. YARMQLINSKX
QUESTION?

National.

%

Why do you limit to national?

MR. YARMOLINSKI:

I don't limit it to national?

I'm simply speaking on behalf of a number of major,
national voluntary charitable organisations.
I suppose regional organisations, organizations
whichhave to deal with large numbers of local regulations,
which aren’t simply solicitingsin one area, and therefore
can adopt their solicitation practices to the needs fof that
area or that municipality.

New, the court

below declined to decide the

reasonableness of the 13 percent requirement as applied to
solicitation by traditional charitahel organizations.

The

amici for whom I’m arguing include the major national
>v • ' .

-

(

traditional organisations, and the arbitrary percentage
limit puts, I submit, an unconstitutional burden on these
organisations«
Solicitation, including door-to-door solicitation,
is essential to the continuing existence of these organi­
zations.

And what -these, organisations are engaged in is

communicating public means, whether advocacy or more
traditional means? whether they're preaching environmentalism

44
or whether they’re selling Girl Scout cookies, or soliciting
money for the Heart Fund.
Solicitation involves their right to communicate,
and it involves a citizen5s right to receive that communi­
cation.

And I would even go so far as to suggest that on

the citizen’s side, contribution is a form of association.
There have been several references to Martin v„
Strothers,

which recognised the distinction and said that

the community can’t substitute its judgment for the
judgment of the householder, the judgment in this case of
spending 25 percent of contributions on what the village
authorities deem to be administrative costs, is a bar to
solicitation.
I do 'think one has to distinguish commercial
organisations.

That distinction was recognised in Schneider

and other eases.
One has to distinguish governmental organisations
which can call on the taxing power.
The amici for whom 1 speaking in many eases Would
have difficulty surviving under the regulations governing
commercial peddlara6 licenses.
Now, 2 suggest that there are two reasons why
the ordinance is an unreasonable restriction as applied to
all charitable organisation®, not just to advocacy
organisations.

45
Th© proportion of contributions that goes for
fundraising is largely beyond organisations' control,, beyond
the control of the organisation that's doing the fundraising.
For example, sometimes causes tend to attract large
contributions from comparatively well-off people? other
kinds tend to attract small contributions from lower income
people.

Some solicitation goes on in areas where population

is concentration? others in areas where it's less concentrated.
There are more

popular causes? less popular'.

Better

established? less better established.
And there’s even a question

of weather, which

influences the ability of solicitors to cover ground.
We don’t suggest that the charitable organisations
for whom I’m speaking use the cloak of charity to mask a
commercial purpose? quite the contrary.

They need the

cloak of charity because it's the only cloak they've got.
How, secondly, ordinances like this one imply
judgment about the means

by

which the organisation should

pursue charitable purposes*' a judgment which, we submit, is
beyond th® power of government, and certainly feayond the
power of local government.
How much the organisations give directly to
beneficiaries? how saueh they spend on what local authorities
deem to be administrative purposes.

And certainly that

determination involve*! a degree of discretion which seems

46
inconsistent with cases in which the Court has bean concerned
about the degree of discretion that's accorded to local
authority.
QUESTIONj

So, Mr. Yarmolinskl, you would say

that if the ordinance requires proof that some of the
money went to the purported charitable purposes, it would
still be invalid?
MR. YARM0LINSK1 t

I would say that if it required

•that proof for an initial period, it would certainly be
invalid because we all know of cases in which validly
charitable organisations must spend even more than they
can raise, and borrow money, in order to survive for an
initial pariod which may run more than a fiscal year.
QUESTIONS

What if the ordinance required that

the—after the first year of operation that the solicitor
hand out a card saying that in the past fiscal year X
parcent was devoted to administrative expense, and X percent
was devoted to the ultimate purposes?
MR. YAPMQLXHSKI;

I foalieve that that would

almost certainly bs a valid constitutional ordinance.

I

would raise a—at least a question as to the appropriate
jurisdiction to enact such a ordinance.

And that goes to my

patchwork point, which I had mentioned earlier.
Because there is a good deal of discretion and a
good deal ©£ flexibility involved in defining what is an

47
administrative expense„

There's an extensive footnote in

our brief on the difference between the 1974 position of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the

1977 position, which happens to work against the major
charitable organisations which I represent»
And I simply suggest,, perhaps not as a matter of
constitutional law, that if you told me that such a
provision was being enacted by state—-by states, or by the
Congress, it seems to ms that would be a very happy
solution to what is a real problem, and what involves*—as
any case reaching this Court does “--a balancing of interests.
QUESTION'S

How about a statement that as a

solicitor of CBE I receive $8.50 an hour for my work?
MR. YARMOLINSKIs

I can't see any constitutional

objection to that requirement.

Again, unless it gets into

the patchwork quilt.
QUESTION:

Unless it gets into the--?

MR. YARMOLIRSKI:•

Into the patchwork problem, the

problem of how dc you get the word around to all your
solicitors.
The problem of door-to-door solicitation—and I'll
just take 30 seconds on this point, because I think it is a
First Amendment issue--it's increasingly difficult for even
the largest and best established organisations not only
to maintain their operations, but to collect the money they

48
need--part of the money they need to collect from door-todoor solicitations, because you can't got solicitors,
because people are unwilling to open their doors at might?
because you can't—-because they're not home, because the
members of the household are not home during the day;
because you have two wage-earner households»
So that what we’re dealing here is an economic
problem that, I suggest, takes on First Amendment dimensions.
QUESTIGMs

How about a limitation that such

solicitations could be mad© only between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.

MR. YARMQLINSKIs

Yes, but only, Mr. Chief

Justice, on behalf of charities? not—
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. YARMQLINSKI!

Not on behalf of—not by the

parson who's putting himself through college.
QUESTIONS

Hot the way they do it at the airport,

where the solicitors are soliciting largely for themselves?

Well, I won't comment on that,

What's the matter with the individual

Because—

He thinks he will really educate th© public.

Now, I believe, Mr. Justice

White, that this is again on© of those balancing questions.
We do not permit the—
QUESTION:

So you'd balance him out?

MR. YARMOLINSKI:

I suspect that you would balance

him out.
QUESTION:

Well, fcha First Amendment doesn't—

refer ©specially to charities, does it?
MR. YARMOLXNSKXt

No, but the First Amendment

has been restricted--has been interpreted not to be a
completely unrestricted opportunity.

After all, this

Court doesn*t—this Court permits individuals to put out
signs saying, "Don't talk to me.

Don't knock on my door."

That is a restriction on the First Amendment right, but it
is regarded as a reasonable restriction.
It might foe argued that to deny tax exemptions to
/

the contributions to an individual, as Congress has done
except under very limited circumstances, is a restriction on
First Amendment rights.

But I don't think that challenge

will get very far.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr.

Yarmolinski.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JACK M. SIEGEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, SIEGEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think it's quits

51
clear from the .remarks of ray opponents that they think the
charities are entitled to soma specific protection, which
I do not read in the First Amendment.
They make an assumption that the First Amendment
gives an unrestricted right to solicit funds.

I read

nothing in the First Amendment, or in any of the cases
that this Court has dasidad, which could lead to that
conclusion.
Mr. Yarmolinski complains that the ordinance is
invalid as to traditional charitable organisations.

Hot

even the Seventh Circuit, whose opinion I disagree with
almost 110 percent, was willing to go that far, and that
issue is not before the Court.
Mr. Yarraolinski decries the possibility of a
patchwork of ordinances.

This nation is a patchwork of

municipalities and statos, each of which have local problems
and local needs which better ought to b© addressed by those
governments closest to them.
QUESTION s

What would you say about an ordinance

that totally prohibited charitable solicitation in the
Village?
MR, SIEGELt

Your Honor, I don't find anything

in the First Amendment that would prohibit that.
QUESTION %

You'd -think that ordinance would be

veil id, in other words?

52
MR. SIEGEL$

Yes, sir, 2 do.

I don’t think it’s necessary to decide that
question hare.

But I think that what counsel is really

seeking is an unbridled right to solicit, because these are
quote, good causes.
They may be fins causes.

I have nothing against

the Heart Fund, the Cancer Group, the St. Judes, the dosens
who solicit in Schaumburg.

1 may not even have anything

against the CBE if I find out what, it's about.
QUESTIONS

Just the Girl Scouts cookies,

apparently.

Pardon me?
I guess the Girl Scouts can solicit?
Girl Scouts are fine, Your HOnor.
I don’t see how they comply with tha

They do.

expanses.
MR. SIEGEL:
QUESTION %
MR. SIEGEL:

Well, they—fehey-~they--'they serve—
Maybe you make an exception r"for them?
W® don't make any exceptions? no,

Your Honor.
QUESTIONs

It would follow from your position that

53
an ordinance which prohibited* absolutely and totally* all
door-to-door solicitation for any purpose would be valido
That would include commercial * which you said everyone
agrees has somewhat less protection.
MR. SIEGEL:

Your HOnor, I mean as far as the

First Amendment was concerned.

There might be other

considerations.
QUESTIONS

Such as?

MR. SIEGELs

Wall* 1 think if it was drafted in

such a way as to make distinctions* if it was an outright
prohibition* I suspect it would probably not violate the
First Amendment.
I

don't

regard, in short* solicitation for funds

alone as a violation—»& prohibition of such soliciation as
a violation

of the First Amendment.

I find nothing in

any of the cases that would indicate that.
And I think it’s quite interesting—I’ve got at
least a half a dozen briefs from the various amici, as
well a» Mr. Shadur, arid I find no cases in any one of them
that goes that far.
It’s always* solicitation coupled with something
els-?,.,

Our ordinance is not a prior restraint.

ordinance doesn't care what your message is..

Our

God biass you

with your message.
But when you start asking for money* then we say

54
that the community,, through its local officials, have a
right to make &. decision.
And I would point out* because I know your Honors
are well aware„ that the Breard case said, in its substance,
that the community could substitute the collective judgment
for that of the individual.
And the mere fact that you post a sign that
says, no solicitors, doesn't keep solicitors out.

He had

that no soliciting sign for four years in our ordinances
before we adopted the present ordinance which is here in
contention.

Because unfortunately, when commissioners—when

solicitors work on a commission, they don't always payattention to such signs? and unfortunately, bewildered
housewives-«and I don't maan to paint a horrible picture
here—“but it's a terrible burden on an individual housewife
to have to go through -the procedures, in Illinois at least,
to file a complaint for trespassing.
1 think it's unrealistic to say that the
traditional remedies against fraud and trespass are
sufficient to deal with this problem.
In the case of pur© First Amendment freedoms,
exercise of freedom of speech and freedom of religion, we
certainly can say that that inconvenience is outweighed by
the social benefits.
But when the objective is to raise money, and most

55
or a substantial portion of the money does not go to the
charitable purpose, I suggest that the municipality and
the interests of the public safety are entitled to enact
the kind of ordinances we’ve enacted here without
infringing upon the First Amendment.
I ask that the Seventh Circuit be reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentleman.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3s00 o’clock p.m., the case in the
above •“entitled matter was submitted.]
