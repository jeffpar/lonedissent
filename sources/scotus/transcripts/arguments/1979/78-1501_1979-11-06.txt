OEMs ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. VINET, ESQ. P
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. VINET:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Courts
This is an anti-trust suit.

It was brought seeking

triple damages and an injunction against the real estate
brokers in New Orleans, Louisiana,,
The plaintiffs are buyers and sellers of one- to
four-family homes in New Orleans.

They bring this suit on

•their own behalf, and also as a class action.
The defendants are two

local professional associa­

tions of realtors; six real astat®; firms who variously dealt
with the plaintiffs in their own transactions; and finally,
a defendant class consisting of all the real estate agents
and brokers who

operated in the New Orleans area during the

limitation period of the suit.
Your Honors, the suit charges price fixing in
commissions for the sale of real estate brokerage services.
The effects on the plaintiffs are alleged to be that the
prices of homes are artificially raised to buyers and/or
that the proceeds received by sellers, when they sell their

4
bossesr are artificially reduced.
The factors of interstate commerce involved in the
transactions ares

the financing aspects of the sales? the

title insurance aspects of the sale? and also, governmental
loan guarantees through the Federal Government.
Defendants, after the suit was filed, moved to
dismiss the case on the grounds that it failed to state &
el&isa upon which relief could be granted, or that alternatively, any claim that it might have stated didn’t arise under
either Federal question jurisdiction or under diversity.
The realtors state that their activities are not in
interstate commerce, and their activities don't substantiali]"
affect interstate commerce.
The suit was filed in October of '75, and in the
fall ©f '76, the trial court ordered discovery to be had on
the jurisdictional issue.

Specifically, the discovery was

designed to show whether or not there was a substantial
involvement of interstate commerce in the real estate trans­
actions? and secondly, whether brokerage—or real estate
brokerage—was a necessary and integral part of the trans­
action. which was, in the words of the trial court, inseparable
\

from its interstate aspects.
Pursuant to the discovery order, depositions were
taken and submitted to the court.
dismissed.

Thereafter, the case was

The trial judge failed to find a sufficient nexus

5
with interstate commerce to justify the exercise of Federal
jurisdiction,
The judgment was later affirmed in the Fifth
Circuit Court of Appeals, and this past May, this Court
granted certiorari.
May it please the Court* Your Honors, the alle­
gation ©f the complaint, and the evidence that w© developed
from discovery, support the exercise of- anti-trust jurisdiction
in this case.
Because these transactions involve land does not
limit the application of traditional jurisdictional analysis
to the facts that we alleged and the facts that we adduced.
Realtors don’t sell land, Your Honors? they sell
service, or more properly, an array of services which are
indispensable t© the buyer or seller of homes in today’s real
estate markets.
QUESTION:

:Mr. Vinet, let me make sure 1 understand

your contention.
It isn’t that you should have had more of an oppor­
tunity to present evidence on the interstate commerce or
affecting interstate commerce aspects in the district court.
It’s that as a matter of law the district court should have
ruled in your favor?
MR. VINST:
Honor’s question

I’m not sure that I understand Your

6
I think wa'.ve raised the point in th® Fifth Circuit
that rfer@ had no discovery on the issue, or the merits, the
price-fixing issue,

tod we’ve contended that the—-that the

ultimate fact of the lawsuit—the price-fixing is also a
jurisdictional fact.
That wasn’t the point I was making just now, however,
Your HOnor.
QUESTIONS

What is your position with respect to the

necessary connection with interstate coamerce, which th®
trial court found was lacking?
Is it that you didn’t have enough chance to develop
your case on that, or that the trial court, affirmed fey the
Fifth Circuit, siaply was wrong on the evidence before it?
HR. VINETs

It’s a little bit of both, Your Honor.

But essentially, I think the trial court interpreted this
Court’s decision in Goldfarb to require something alone the
lines of an in-commerce showing in order to

justify

jurisdiction.
That’s why he talked about necessary and integral,
■and inseparable from the interstate aspects.

I think he

was looking for some sort of a procedural relationship, much.'
like—you’ve got to have a title—
;‘V

QUESTIONt

i.

So your answer is that the district

court on the facts before it should have ruled for you?
MR. VINETs

Yes, Your Honor, but not because it

7
found facts that didn’t exist; but because it applied a
standard that wasn’t broad enough.
QUESTIONs

Well, that’s—but on the facts, if it had

applied the right standard, you should have won?
MR. VTNET:

‘Hsat’a erectly right; Your Honor.
v

QUESTION:

Arid by the right standard, do you mean

the standard that—or something like the standard that was
applied in Go Id fa rb?
MR,, VXNEYs
this case.

Your Honor, Goldfarb is distinct from

Goldfarb--well, yes, in the sense that Your

Honor cited the ©pinion by saying that, were they engaged
in interstate commerce, or did fchsir activities substantially
affect interstate commerce?
Well; I believe that Your Honor found, in fact, that,
they were more engaged in interstate commsree than they were
affecting interstate eomiBsrce, in the sense of the Mandevills
Island kind of cases.
It’s more like Yellow Cab, where the ride between
the train stations was part of 'the journey.

That’s what

the title lawyers were like.
Now, we’re saying the realtors aren’t like that.
They’re a little bit different.

Their effect on interstate

commerce is more of an economic thing? it’s more of a
structural way that the real estate market functions.
fact, I was just going to talk ©bout that, about how

In

g
the real estate market actually works:.
QUESTXOHs

But that’s basically a factual question.

You have a factual finding by the district court, affimed
by the Court of Appeals, against you on that point, don’t
you?
MR. VINETs

We have a factual finding to the effect

that real estate brokers don’t stand in quite the s&nva
relationship to the transaction as title lawyers do, Your
Honor,.

And in that sense, we lost the ease.

Because I

believe that we—“the district court and the Court of Appeals
expected us to show that.
But—
QUESTION:

You say they should have applied a

different standard?
MR. VXNET;

That’s it, Your Honor.

They should

have applied an affectation of eossmerce standard as opposed
to an in-eomssree standard, is essentially what we’re---”
QUESTION:

And supposing we agree with you?

Do

we then send the ease back for those courts to apply the—what
we decide is the proper standard?
MR. VXNET:

On, no, Your Honor, I believe that the

evidence we’ve developed, taken in conjunction with the alle­
gations of the petition, for which there was neither evidence
nor discovery, would support a jurisdictional finding.
I believe 'that Your Honors could find that in

fact

And

jurisdiction does exist on this record, as it exists right

now in terms of the evidence.

QUESTIONs

Well, didn't we ©my in the Hex ess© a

couple years ago, written by Justice Marshall, that summary
judgment rulings, rulings on a question as a matter ©f law,
were not favored in this kind ©f a ease?
MR. VIHETs

Indeed you did, Your Honor? that9a

vary correct.

QUESTIOBs

And what you3 re asking ns to do is to

make—to find a summairy judgment, is to enter summary
judgment here.
MR. VXNETs
a summary judgment.

Well, no. Your Honor, w© weren't seeking
The realtors were in the sense of that.

On the jurisdictional issue, Your Honor, all
we're asking you to say is that we!re entitled to go back
and have & trial.

Yes, btsfc weren’t there factual disputes

MR. VINET:
disputes. Your Honor.

The question was simply what facts

we had t© show.

If we had t© show that real ©state brokers are
like title lawyers, and that you can’t get along without a
real estate broker, well then, no, we didn’t show that.
because that's not true.

10

If we had t© show that what a realtor does in
bringing together a buyer and seller is a necessary concomitant
of the real estate market just as finding your title—finding
your financing in interstat® commerce , and that without both
of those elements working together, you don't have a real
estate market; if we had t© show that, I think we have shown
it, and I think that justifies the Court exercising juris­
diction.
QUESTION3
that?

You say your opponents in effect concede

What you just said?

There isn't any factual dispute

about it?
ME. VINET?

Well, I think that they would—they

have, in fact, testified that the majority of real ©state
transactions, in fact 60 percent ©f real estate transactions
in New Orleans—-15m sorry, in a majority in New Orleans, they
testified, are handled through real estate brokers.

Nation­

wide the figure is about 60 percent.
I think that from that w© can deduce that 60
percent of loans are granted, 60 percent of title policies
are written, 60 percent of VA and PEM. loans ar® granted,
because somehow, somewhere, a real estate agent has performed
i

his function of getting a listing, finding a buyer, bringing
them together, and confecting a purchase agreement.
I think -that that—-that's a conclusion that can

that the price goes up because ©f the price-fixing.

If the

Well, Mr. Vinat, there's a© indication

in the Court of Appeals opinion, which I just read over,
that your claim was that you were limited in your deposition

to showing only whether or not this was in commarce.

And

the Court ©f Appeals opinion discusses at great length
both th© question of whether ©r not the defendants8 activities
were in commerce, and whether ©r not their activities
affected commerce.

''■'effect that the listing agreement, or the purchase agreeseat
will provide that a good faith effort has to be made to
get the loan, but payment of the eossaissioa is contingent
upon the obtaining ©f financing.

How# if th© local housing market depends on real

We'v© at great length in our brief talked about all the
substantial amounts of money involved? about how it comes
fro® depositors whs are located out of state or in-state?
how advances are secured by homesteads from the Federal
Horn© loan Bank? about how the secondary market operates
and paper is discounted—paper is discounted and sold

20
into articles—-and the notes tia@ja@©lv@s cross state Hess.
QUESTION:

Mr» Vinet, let ®s ask you one more

question.
At page 39A of your petition for certiorari, which
is a part of the Court of Appeals8 opinion, the paragraph
beginning at the bottom of the page*

“With our endorsement

of the district court*s determination that this particular
real estate activity neither occurs in, nor stab stanti ally
affect©, interstate commerce..."
How, d© you say that’s the wrong standard to be
applied for jurisdictional purposes?
MR. VINETs

Well, Your Honor, it’s the right

language, but it wouldn’t make sense.
QUESTION:

Well, then you’re attacking a factual

finding.
ME. VINETs
QUESTION!

Well, no—
And two courts have decided against

you.
MS. VINSTs Mr. Justice Rehnquist, what I’m saying
is that “substantially affects,85

for the purposes of the
<

Court of Appeals and the lower court, meant the same thing
as 53in commerce."

They were the same test.

"Necessary and
:

'

\

integral part ©f the interstate transaction, inseparable
from its interstate aspects," which is what this—the Court’s
language in Goldfarb.

That’s how the Co*rrt found jurisdiction

21
ia Goldfarb.

And our opinion, or ©ur position, i® that -the

district court and the Court ©f Appeals perhaps failing that
land is completely unique end it doesn't cross state lines,
or it doesn't mow in cossaerce, feeling all that to be the
case, that the district court just took that same language,
■ and they said, wail, -that9® the way the Supreme Court found
jurisdiction in Goldfarb, and that9® the only way it can fe©
found.

Because land is, they say, the quintessential local

product.
And they use th® language, substantial effect.
Your Honor, but if you read th® opinion, you're going to
®@© that what they wanted isa to show was that

real estate
.4

brokers ar© like title lawyers.

And we didn't show that.

What w® showed was a market dependence on local
activity of real estate brokers ?,and upon interstate
commerce, to keep tha market going.

If realtors make th©

market, interstate commerce permits it to survive.

But you say that real ©state was whafc

the Court of Appeals thought was involved.

The quotation

I just read from their ©pinion says, this particular real
©state activity, which I take it, is brokerage.
HR. EASTERBROOKs

I understand that, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist.
QUESTIONs

Hew 3© you explain it?

MR. EASTERBROOKs

The Court of Appeals opinion is

internally inconsistent in that respect.

There are other

portions of the opinion that appear to say that they8 r©
asking the question whether reel ©state itself, rather th&n
the brokerage services, is part of interstate eosamares.

23
1 take it that raal estate is not part ©£ inter­
state coasaerce, unless you haws a river meandering, and
you have an original jurisdiction ease*

But till© is quit©

a different matter entirely.
The argument—the argument, I think, is a rather
straightforward ©rgusaant, one of practical economics, as
the Court put it in the Rex Hospital case.

And it runs

almost identical to th© argument that this.Court accepted ii
Burke v. Ford.
It runs something like this?

Brokers sell

information and assistance in conducting transactions.
Their services aren't tied to the land, but rather, ar®
tied to the clients and to the clients * money.
h price-fixing agreement, setting the price of

those services, increase© their price.

When the price of a
/

commodity is increased, less of that commodity is purchased.
If less brokerage service is purchased, it is less likely
that buyers and sellers will get together on a real ©state
deal.

And that's particularly important for interstate

movers, who often rely on brokers as their sole source of
information about th© market of th® state into which they"re
moving.
QUESTIONS

Is it your understanding of Hex that it

held, as a matter of law, that there was jurisdiction, or
simply it said that th© trial court should have decided

It as a factual question?

m„ EASTERBROOK s

It said that it had to be

decided as; a factual question.

It did say, hoW¥«r, that

the standards, the legal standards used by the lower court
for disposing of that factual question were erroneous? the
same kind of argument w@ sake her®.
That—the final touch ©f that is that a reduction
in the number of real ©state transactions which is caused
by this increase in the price of in for» at.ion and sarnie©
will affect the interstate money market at th® ssssa time as
it affects th® interstat® movement of people.
That's a rattier straightforward argument.

Th©

affect on commerce can be traced clearly and unambiguously
in th® same way it was traced in Burke v. Ford.

Ami there­

fore , we think the Court of Appeals was wrong in saying
that, plaintiffs should not @vsa ba allowed to prove at
trial that interstat® commerce was affected by this
transaction.
In fact, if th® Court of Appeals argsmsnt is
'that plaintiff isn't even to be allowed to'-prove it at trial;
the contention is that the activities of brokers are
completely outside th© powers of Congress under the commerce
clause.
Th® Sherman Act, At9s been held, ©^presses all
of th® power that C©agr®s§® has t© exercise.

And if the

25
Sbsman Act expresses all of the power Congress has to
exercise, and if, m the Court ©f Appeals held, the Sherman
Act does not apply to the activities of brokers at all,
it must follow that Congress has no power over brokers.
\

That seems an extraordinary proposition that
Congress has n© power over & multibillion dollar industry
that affects, according to the census figures, at least
/

3 million people who uove Ss&m state to state every year.
That* s a rather significant affect ©a commerce
for a e&e© In which the Court of Appeals argues that there
is non®.
In & series ©f earlier cases—-take, for example,
the P®res case, which held that the eoaasere© claws© reaches
local loan-sharking activities; ©aa $2,000 loan made on the
streets ©f one city; a® proof of interstate commerce; but
the ©esaasree el&uge applied because lending activities as
a whole affect interstate commerce „
QUESTION:

Well, but that5® not the same standard

as you us© on an anti-trust case.

Yota have to prove the

fact that your particular ease has an affect on coisanerce.
MRo EASTERJ8R00K:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, itBs

one of the oddities, I think, of the Sherman Act cases, that
that is the standard at the same time as the holding is
that the Sherman Act expresses all of the power that
Congress has to exercise.

26
It’s a difficult argument.
QUESTION:

But is it nonetheless--

MRo EASTERBROOK:

It is nonetheless the holding.

But it applies sometimes in--it applies with more or less
rigor.

And there is an interesting difference, I think, in

the treatment ordinarily, in a ease like Rea: Hospital, and
the treatment in what might be called the failed conspiracy
cases.
Take, for example, the Socony Vacuum Oil case,
the famous early per se rule case, in which the Suprema
Court held that the Sherman Act applied and banned the agree
menfc in tha Socony Vacuum Oil case.
Ev«in though there was absolutely no proof that
the agreement had been successful; the Court said: Well,
it may be that this agreement was a miserable failure, but
the Sherman Act applies nonetheless.
Now, if you assume that the agreement was a
miserable failure, that it did not achieve its obj ectives,
you8re assuming at tha same time that no commerce at all was
affected.

So if you follow it to that step and say that

in a particular case there's always a need to prove
substantial affect on commerce, that's also the same thing
as saying that the failed agreement cases, the attempt cases
the conspiracy that breaks down before it gets off the
ground, are outside the scope of the .Sherman Act.

27
QUESTION: Well, would you say it's impossible to
logically conclude that the real estate board of Greater
New York City is engaged in activities which affect commerce,
?.

but the real estate board of a town in the Shenandoah Valley
in Virginia is not engaged in those activities?
MRo EASTERBRCOK:

I think it would be extremely

difficult to do that unless the real estate board of the
small town in that hypothetical was able to show that no one
had moved into or out of that town within the period of the
statute of limitions,
QUESTION:

So there’s no substantial requirement at

all?
MRo EASTERBRQOK:

The requirement, I think, and it’s

a way that the failed conspiracy cases can be dealt
the

with at

same as cases like Rex Hospital, is that the commerce

subject to the conspiracy be substantial; that is, :Ln the
failed conspiracy cases, one of those failed conspiracies
was the business of oil.

There was a lot of interstate

eoMEarce in oil; everybody agreed that was substantial.
In the real estate business, the kind of commerce
involved is interstate commerce in the movement of people
from one state to another, in the movement of money from
banks across state lines in the secondary market in real
estate financing purchases by institutions like the
government National Mortgage Association.

28
That’s clearly substantial here.

It’s substantial

in the same way that it was substantial in the failed
conspiracy cases.
QUESTION:

Mr. Easterbrook, I want to be eure I

understood your answer in your colloquy with my brother
Rehnquist.
Do you concede that—logic aside-“-the test in the
ease—in & case such as Peres, i.e. did Congress have
constitutional power to enact this legislation, and that in
this particular case, if there were generalised power on the
part of Congress to enact this legislation, the petitioner
Perez cannot be heard to say, ’’Well, X—say loan was not in
interstate commerce"?
MRo EASTERBROGK:

I think that to be the holding

in Petes.
QUESTION:

That is, I take it, the holding in

Peres from which you know I--with wjhieh you know I disagreed.

MR» EA3TERBR0GK:

MRo EASTERBROOK:

QUESTION:

Do you concede that this»-the test was

Oh,, yes; the two have certainly
They've been applied differently

quite traditionally.
But that difference in application , however the test
has been phrased, has never made & difference in the result,
ever since the Mandeville Island

Farms case, which was the

first of the cases holding squarely that the Shenaan Act
reaches transactions that affect commerce, even though they
aren't in it.
And since the Mandeville Island Farms case, that
difference in the phrasing of the test--surely an important
difference in the phrasing ©f the test just looking at words-has never made & difference in the outcome, at the same time

QUESTION:

Well, to the Perez case, Congress might

have worded the criminal statute to have said that loan­

state commerce, and did not affect it."

That would--that would make it a„_

Of course, and that8s what most of

QUESTION:

MRo EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

But there's—

—that are in or affect?

MRo EASTERBROOK:

Oh--huh, but there's been an

interesting difference even between those eases and the Sherman
Act cases, Mr, Justice Stewart,

In the gun cases, there has

been a series of decisions that the travel of even a single
gun from one state to another, the statute that says, "in or
affects commerce" meets the in-or-affects-commerce test.
If that's what "in or affects commerce" means, and
the gun cases certainly hold that, the same reasoning applied
to the Sherman Act would mean that travel of even a single
dollar or a single person.

And there’s some tension between

\

that line of cases and the language in the Sherman Act cases
saying,the effect has^to be substantial,
QUESTION:

Right,

MRo EASTERBROOK:

Even though the language of the

statutes is very similar.
QUESTION: You read the—-you seem to read the Fifth
Circuit

holding as meaning—as holding, in fact, that

under no circumstances can the real estate brokerage business
ever be read as in ©r affecting interstate commerce.

31
MRo EASTERBRGOK:
saying*

I think that’s what the Court was

There is, in fact, a brief paragraph on pages 41 and

42 ©£ the Appendis: to the petition saying that we recognised
that w® have today made the very strong holding that Congress
has no power over the real estate business*
QUESTION:

Well, then, what do you think-on page

39A, the paragraph that was read to you before, "With our
endorsement of the district court’s determination that this
particular real estate activity***", do you take--say that
phrase, "this particular real estate activity," means all
real estate brokerage business, ©r the one claimed and shown
here?
MR0 EASTERBROGIC:

Certainly, the Hew Orleans real

estate brokerage business, Mr. Chief Justice*
QUESTION:

All Hew Orleans real estate?

MRo EASTRRB110QK:
it gotfc©

I think so*

As the court, before

page 39, had just spent two pages discussing the

argument that plaintiff should be allowed an opportunity to
i

prove on trial some of the allegations in their complaint.
And it said they weren’t entitled even to that opportunity
to prove—
QUESTION:

That is, some allegations of the price™

fixing?
MRo. EASTERBRGGK:

Yes*

And in the allegations

with respect to interstate commerce, one of the questions

32
that the plaintiffs propounded in an Interrogatory, for
example, was:

State the number of people who cross state

lines to use your service? who go from one state to the other
by use of your service?'

That question appears in the

interrogatories at pages 91 and 101.
The respondents, the defendants, objected even to
answering that interrogatory; it was never answered.

And so

the Court of Appeals holding is that interstate commerce—it
can be known to a certainty that interstate commerce is not
affected, even though we have no idea how many people cross
state lines to use the service.
That is, X think—
QUESTION:

Did the plaintiffs take that unanswered

question to the judge?
MRo EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

Urn sorry, Mr. Justice White?

Well, did they attempt to get an order

to answer the question?
MRo EASTERBROOK:

j
The judge, after receiving the

response, simply took the case under advisement, and than
dismissed it tinder Rule 12, without ever dealing with the
i

objection to the taking of the interrogatories.
QUESTION:

Well, before—

MRo EASTERBROOK:

There was no motion to compel

discovery.
QUESTION:

And the plaintiff didn’t assign that as

33
error?
MRo EASTERBROOK:

H@~~cn appeal, the plaintiff

did not assign as error any of the particular refusals to
answer, but instead made the more general argument that he
was entitled to a fcyrial.
That more general argument I think would compre­
hend the particulars of, ’’they didn’t answer this question,
the didn’t answer that question, they didn’t answer the
following question.”
But there was no motion to compel discovery; in
that sense, the procedural ”t’s” were not crossed.
QUESTION:

I take it the—on the theory the Court

of Appeals used, if the brokerage rate, agreed-upon brokerage
rate, was 20 percent instead of 6, or even 50, that the
result would have been the same?
MRo EASTERBROOK:

I think the result would have

been quite the same, from the Court of Appeals point of view.
y

QUESTION:

And I take it your argument would be the

same if it was 1 percent?
MRo EASTERBROOK:

If--it would be the same if the

fee were increased by any amount by the price-fixing.
QUESTION:

Yes.,

MRo EASTERBROOK:

Let me suggest, by the way,

that that’s an important difference between—
QUESTION:

Well, you—I take it your assumption

34
is that inevitably the price is higher than it would be if
the agreed rate--the price of real estate is higher than if
the agreed rate were one percent?
MRo EASTERBRGOK:

Yes, yes.

But I think it’s

important, though, Mr. Justice—
QUESTION:

And that if there was competition,

prices would be lower in some cases?
MRo EASTERBRGOK:

Yes, that's certainly our

assumption.
But I think it's important to understand, and this
complements the Goldfarb arguments , the Goldfarb ease was
decided on the explicit assumption that what the lawyers did
had no effect on prices, something that the court's opinion
said twice, that is, there had been no claim that in fact
prices went up.
The problem in showing interstate commerce in
Goldfarb, on the assumption that the lawyers* prices had not
been increased by this fee schedule, was how to show any
effect on commerce at all.
QUESTION:

In that sense--

Well, to the contrary, there's—you'll

find statements in there also that no lawyer felt free to
charge anything less than the fixed rate.
MRo EASTERBRGOK:

Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice.
<s<-. .

QUESTION:

And the evidence in the case was, that

of all the 36 lawyers who were fooled, as it were, they all

35
said they were not free.

MRo EASTERBROGK:
way.

Oh, I'm not disputing that in any

My observat.ion was only that they all felt free to

follow this fissed rate.

There had been no particular alle­

gation that this fixed rate was higher than the rate that
would prevail, in the market.
And so in that sense, finding that the lawyers
ware indispensable to the interstate commerce was essential
t© finding an effect on interstate commerce.

Her© the alle­

gation is that the rate has been changed, and so you find a
different change of causation—different chain of causation
to the effect on commerce.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. McCall.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY McCALL, JRos ESQ 0,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS0

MRo McCALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Court:
I would like initially to respond to Mr. Justice
Rehnquist’s question, because 1 think this is one of the more
important questions before this Court.

And that question

was, whether w® contend that there was a factual issue?
And the short answer to that question is, we not
only do not concede that there is no factual issue, but we
contend that there was a factual issue, and that that factual

36
issue was adversely resolved against these petitioners, and
that absent some showing of clear error, that that factual
resolution should stand.
Second, as to the contention that these petitioners
ware deprived of the opportunity to ©how the affect on
commerce, and that they were restricted by reason of the
district court's order limiting them t© the Goldfarb ease,
the fact of the matter is that these petitioners embraced
Goldfarb closely and joyously from the very beginning.

The

term that they used in some of their memoranda was that
"Goldfarb loves the Instant case."
How it followed from that that when the district
judge called his pre-trial conference in September and
suggested that there be discovery, he was following precisely
the lead that petitioners had suggested that he follow.

H®

said, You have talked about Goldfarb; I'm going to give you
an opportunity to show that Goldfarb did, in fact, as you
say, love this case.
The question was asked whether there was any
objection on petitioner's part to that alleged limit to
petitioner's discovery.

And the answer is, no.

This record

will be examined with care, and there will be no indication
of any objection whatsoever.
The plain fact of the natter is that this concept
of affecting interstate commerce through the alleged affect

37
on the gale of houses by reason of the supposed fixed
commission is an afterthought.

And what this Court is being

asked to do is, to supply what these petitioners didn’t
supply in the lower court.
This Court is not be ring asked to review whether,
on the facts before it, the district court reached the correct
decision.

It’s not being asked whether, on the record before

it, the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the holding of the
lower court.
What this Court is being asked to do is to go
behind the record, and to assume that had these petitioners
put on a different case, that the result would have been
difforent„
QUESTION:

So you don’t read the Fifth Circuit

opinion as your friend does, namely, that the brokerage
business, real estate brokerage business could never be shown
to affect: interstate commerce?
\

MR, MeCALL:

I think the answer to that, Mr, Chief

Justice, lies in the portion that was read either by
'yourself or one of the other Justices, namely, on this
.particular case.

The Court of Appeals didn't make—

QUESTION:

I didn’t

quite say, on this particular

ease.
MRC MeCALL:
QUESTION:

Or these particular circumstances.
It's

page 39, "this particular real

38
estate activity.”

There’s a certain ambiguity in the word

"activity,” perhaps.

That is, if he was talking about the

activity embraced in the pleadings, or--that’s one thing; if
it’s the activity in the whole metropolitan area of Hew
Orleans, that’s something else.
But you read it narrowly?
MRo McCALL:

1 stand corrected, Mr. Chief Justice,

on the language in the Court of Appeals decision.

But as I

read the phrase, "this particular real estate activity," it
relates tc the particular activity with respect to which
there was evidence before the Court; and that what the Court:
of Appeals did was, that it restricted its holding to the
facts which it had before it; and that it did not make a
sweeping holding that under no circumstances could there ba
a situation in which real estate brokers might not have
some affect--effect--on interstate commerce.
QIJEST10H:

In this sense, is it your position

that this is roughly parallel to a complaint and a showing
where there--depending on diversity of citizenship, there’s
either a flawed or no ©1legation of diversity, and nothing to
supplement that, and fche court then decides that this is not a.
diversity ease, and therefore, no jurisdiction?
Is that the kind of situation we have, in your
view?
MRo McCALL:

Ho, Your Honor, I don’t think so.

39
I think we have a better situation than that, because this-“it
must be borne in mind—decision was not on the face of the
complaint.

But this decision was rendered after these

petitioners had the opportunity to adduce evidence in support
of their allegation.
And I think it is important for this Court to
realise, to recall, that it was in September, I believe early
in September, that the district judge entered Ms order
saying that discovery should take place.
And as I have pointed out, there was no objection to
that.

The record is completely silent on any objection by

these petitioners at that time, or at smy other time, to the
supposed limits on discovery.
How, what the judge did was, he said, I'm going to
order discovery-“all this appears in the record.

And a month

later he called another pre-trial conference, and he said:
”1 will give you until December 31st"—it was then early in
October—f; in which to complete your discovery."

Ho objection

at that time, no suggestion that the breadth of the discovery
should be increased.
It was not until the middle of December that the
first notice of taking a deposition was issued.

On or about

December 21st, I think it was, these petitioners moved to
extend, the time in which their discovery could be conducted.
And it will be noted that that motion does not

40
recite that they were improperly restricted as

to what

their scope of discovery should be.
The basis for that motion was, that they didn"t
have time to set up the depositions, that they ware having
difficulty in getting the deponents»
So I would say that I think that we should lay at
rest .my suggestion that; the district court improperly, in
any way, limited the discovery by these petitioners»

Because

had they really thought that there was such limit, clearly it
was incumbent upon them to say so.
You don51 come to a Court of Appeals and say, the
court has improperly instructed the jury, without taking
exception to the jury charges.

And for these petitioners

now to say, "Well, we tried our ease ©n one theory below, and.
we adduced evidence on that, but had we thought about it as
we now think about it, we would have put in different
evidence.53

MRo McCALL:

QUESTION:

But it seems to me normally, when you

have a motion to dismiss supported by affidavits and treated
as a summary judgment, you basically say, well, the issues
are either undisputed, or if there is a dispute, you take the
view of the facts most favorable to the losing part}?.
Isn’t that the customary rule?
MRo McCALL:

In general, I think, yes, that is the

rule.
QUESTION:

Then why wouldn't that rule apply to

this case?
MRo McCALL:

But X don’t think it applies in this

case, because you don't, have a motion to dismiss or summary
judgment in the conventional sense.

where the petitioners have the opportunity to take their
evidence, and actually do so by contradictory depositions-QUESTION;

And the judge, in effect, says, ’’Well,

I take everything you have proved,' and assuming it to be
true, it's still not enough.”

Isn't that the normal way you

do that?
MR„ McCALL:

Hot where evidence is submitted by

both sides, as I appreciate it, as it is in this ease.
QUESTION;

Well, but the trial court can’t resolve

factual disputes, if the plaintiffs' affidavit shows one
thing and the defendants* another, he can't make a finding
of fact.

Ha--as Justice Stevens says, he has to resolve say

dispute like that in favor of the party against whom the

43
motion to dismiss is directed.
MRo McCALL:

That is correct, where you haw

But

what we had here, in effect, was a separate trial on the
issue of jurisdiction.

QtJESTIOH:

Well, how— X*m not—I don’t think I

fully understand that.

Because you could have & proceeding

on affidavits plus depositions, or you could have by consent
or presumably by the trial judge5® order, a severed issue from

MRo McCALL:

to Rule 56.”
It seems to me at the very bottom line of his
opinion is, after everything's all over, is, there is no

Stevens and Mr. Justice White asked me:

They couldn't do

anything else..
However, then the question becomes:

Have they

shown, or can the evidence in anyway be construed or
resolved to show a substantial effect on interstate commerce?
And we would submit that both of the courts correctly
resolved that issue.
Now, let me if I may address that.
QUESTION:

Well, what if it--what if real estate

brokerage were 50 percent?
argument or not?

Would you be making the same

An agreed-upon--an agreement among brokers

not to compete, and that their agreed brokerage rat® was
50 percent.
And I suppose you would concede that that kind of
a brokerage charge to a seller might cause him to raise his
house price?
MRo McCALL:

I think that the question would be

48
somewhat more difficult in that case.
QUESTION:

So is it the question of what is

substantial?
ME* MeCALL:

i think that addresses the question

of substantiality.
QUESTION:

And so it does that?

You would agree

that that would have an effect?
MR* MeCALL:

Let me say, with reservations 1 will

agree to that.
QUESTION:

And sir percent doesn5t have enough of an

effect?
MR* MeCALL:

Well, the point that I wanted to make

on that is--and I3aa sorry not to answer your question more
briefly and directly--is -that what we're talking about is the
b±x

percent commission on the first $100,000.

It's a sliding

scale; it goes down after that.
If the

suggestion is that the maintenance of a

sis percent rate on housing has an effect on the lending
and title insurance, 1 would submit first that there is no
evidence—
QUESTION:
MR* MeCALL:
QUESTION;

Let’s don’t skip over one—
All right.
Do you agree that it has an effect on

house prices?
MR* MeCALL:

No, I would not agree to that.

49
QUESTION:

If there was no agreement, sad people

were free to compete, you don’t think house prices would
ever be lower?
MRo McCALL:

Wall, the way you have stated it,

Mr. Justice White, I think I would have to say, yes, they
might be.

But I would say—
QUESTION:

If some broker decided to cut his

rat© to two percent, I suppose a seller might be willing to
cut his price some.
MR, McCALL:
QUESTION:
MR, McCALL:

Well, let me—
Is that right or not?
1 think this is a possibility.

But

what I would strongly suggest to this Court is, that we're
not dealing with possibilities in this case.
QUESTION:

Does this record, Mr. McCall, show the

aggregate amount of commissions in New Orleans- in a given
year on all real estate transactions in which & broker was
involved?
MR, McCALL:
QUESTION:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.
It would run into, I would assume, &

good many millions of dollars, wouldn’t it?
MR, McCALL:
QUESTION:
MR, McCALL:

Not, the commissions, no, sir.
Not so?
No, 1 would be greatly surprised if

50
sis percent commissions amounted to that much» to millions
of dollars.

X don't know.

It's conceivable.

But what I would**»
QUESTION:

Well, then, it*a quite different from

Washington, D„C0, because the aggregate commissions here
mist easily match the figures in this area.
But let’s assuae»-let's assume—
MR0 MeCALL:

X won’t dispute that, because X don’t

know.
QUESTION:
given year.

Well, let’s assume it’s $5 million in a

Then th® next step would be the response that you

gave lit. Justice White:
price of houses?

Does this have an affect upon the

And I think you conceded that probably it

could have some effect.
MRo

MeCALL:

like to say, is that
but

I

What X think X said, and what I would

X

would have to accept the possibility,

would say that X don’t believe it.

And. what X think is

most important, for purposes of this decision is, there is
no evidence to that effect; none whatsoever.
Mow, if we talk about th® effect of real estate
commissions on the cost of houses, the price of houses,
certainly in the Mew Orleans area there has been what X
would describe as a quantum leap in the cost of residential
houses.

The level of real estate commissions has not changed

in any respect.

51
QUESTION:

Well, it doesn’t have to, because in

& dollar amount, it goes up,
Mo MeCALL:

It does in dollar amount, that's true.

But where, then, is the demonstration that the level of real
estate commissions has had any effect on the price of houses?
QUESTION:

Well, yon wouldn't ask»-you wouldn't

ask for independent proof if the rate was 50 percent, would
you?
You just said you wouldn't.
MRo MeCALL:
os. 50 percent.

All right, sir, X won’t ask for proof

But at 6 percent, I will.

QUESTION:
MRc MeCALL:
QUESTION:

Hasn't the rat® itself gone up?
No, sir.
It has in most places from 5 percent to

6 percent in the last ten years or less.
MRo MeCALL:

Let ms say that the record is silent

on that.
QUESTION:
MRo MeCALL:
QUESTION:

Well, I thought the question was—
But I don't think it happened.
Wasn’t the question, wouldn’t there

necessarily be an effect on th® price of housing if you had
free competition by contrast with a priee-fised commission?
That was the question, wasn't it?
QUESTION:

MRo MeCALL:

Yes.
Have I not answered that» Mr. Justice

52
Stewart?
QUESTION:

Well, we were talking about whether or

not a commission has an effect on housing.

Of course it

does, on the price of housing; we will assisae it does.
But that wasn’t the question.
MRo McCALL:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry.
The question was:

If there were free

competition among real estate brokers, and some of them
sight fix their rate at one percent or two percent or three
percent or seven or eight percent, depending on the indi­
vidual house to be sold, perhaps, or their economies of
scale, or their efficiencies, or whatever, wouldn’t free
competition, at least arguably, make some housing cheaper
than it 5.8 now under a price-fixed six percent rate?
That was the question.
MR, McCALL:
a

I think the answer to that is, there5e

theoretical possibility it could.

that it will.

But I’m not persuaded

And I think you have a question of how far

down can real estate commissions go?

And people stay in

'business.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose—what should a trial judge

do, for anti-trust purposes, when he’s making a--when he’s
going to resolve that at the beginning of a case?

Should he

resolve that in your favor or the other side’s favor?
you say, X just can’t be sure that it would.

When

53
MRo McCALL:

And your question is, how should he

resolve it?
QUESTION:

And he should say, the plaintiff hasn't

proved it, or what?
HR» McCALL:

I should think, Mr. Justice White, that

if he gives the plaintiff an opportunity to prove it, and the
plaintiff doesn't prove it, that he is justified then in
resolving it adversely to him.
Let me if I may—
QUESTION:

Of course, even if yon admit all this,

it's irrelevant so far as the Federal anti-trust laws go if
it's all in intrastate commerce?

MRo McCALL:
QUESTION:

Well—
No matter how egregious the violation

might be of the anti-trust laws if it were affecting inter­
state commere®, it*s no violation of Federal—so far as- the
Federal laws g© if it doesn't affect interstate commerce, or
isn't in interstate commerce,
QUESTION:

But isn't the only way—-isn't the only

way that—or is it the only way that the agreed-upon brokerage
rate can affect the mortgage market by interstate travel is
by affecting the price of the house?
MRo McCALL:

It's fch® only way that I can conceive

of its doing so.
QUESTION:

Yes.

So the first step is fc© talk about

54
the price ©f the house»

And the next question is, wall,

even if the price would go up or go down depending on whether
there’s an agreement or not, is the mortgage money market
affected, interstate mortgage money market affected?

Or

the interstate sale of houses affected?
MRo McOALL:
devoid of any proof.

That is where the record i3 completely
And if I may continue on the line

suggested by Hr. Justice Stewart, I think we should bear in
mind that the activities of real estate brokers as such are
clearly intrastate commerce.
Now, the suggestion is that you bridge the gap
between that intrastate commerce and the, I would say,
undisputed interstate commerce in lending and title insurance,
is that you accept as a given, without any proof, that the
price of houses will, if increased by maintenance of the
percentage on real estate brokers’ commissions, and that that
in turn will affect the number of transactions and the
amount ©£ sales and the amount“-therefore, the amount bought.
We say first, that that is not by any means proven.
s.

But second--and I think it sis important for me to make this
point—we would respectfully submit that what we’re talking
about is"an incidental effect.

It is not such an effect as

is contemplated by th® line of decisions which has been
mentioned her®, and I wish t© treat that particularly.

55
Thase petitioners rely heavily on Mandeville Island,
Now, Mandeville Island was a very special ease* because the
whole process of growing sugar and refining sugar was so
closely integrated that this Court concluded that they were
inseparable.
But Mandeville Island was not the genesis of this
affectation doctrine.

¥e have t© go back to the Shreveport

?
rate eases.

We have to go back to first and second Coronado,

we have to g© back to Apes Hosiery against hieder.

And as I

appreciate what was held in those cases* Shreveport rate
held that it was permissible for the anti-trust—“for the
Interstat® Commerce Commission to act with respect to purely
intrastate rates because they directly affected interstate
rates.

In first Coronado* and in second Coronado* what

this Court held* &s I appreciate it, is that the activity
of the union in not only calling a strike but in the
violence and all of that in first Coronado was held not
i

to fee in interstate commerce because it was not intended to
affect interstate cmsaerce, nor was it inevitably--nor would
«

it inevitably do so.
QUESTION:

But—
The Coronado Coal eases were criminal

cases, weren’t they?
Mlo McCALL:

U.S. against--yes, they were both

criminal eases; both of them.

But in second Coronado* they

want back aad they took evidence, and the critical finding

56
there was that the purpose of the strike was to diminish the
amount of coal which was available in interstate commerce.
And the Court said, with that» we now find that you have &
direct affect on interstate commerce.

You have a substantial

affect.
Now, when Apes Hosiery cam® along, you had another
strike (this was not a criminal case) .

This was where the

strikers pulled a sit-down strike, and they prevented the
movcraaent in interstate commerce of substantial amounts of
hosiery.

And what this Court held was, that that was not &

cas© which affected interstate commerce in the sense required
for application of the Sherman. Act.
And I submit—
QUESTION:

Well, that, of course, was not the kind

of restraint--not a business-type restraint, rather than
because the commerce power dida51 re&eji it, wasn't it?
MR0 McCALL:

I'a sorry. Your Honor, you say was

that a business-type restraint?
QUESTION:

In the Apex case, it sort of went off

m. the theory that a labor dispute is not the kind of
restraint that the Sherman Act is—
MRo McCALL:
it.

No, sir, that was not the basis of

As I appreciate the Ap®ss Hosiery opinion, the Court

made no distinction as to whether it was s labor dispute or
an industrial

dispute—an industrial restraint.

They said

57
that the criterion was whether the object of the restraint
was on the interstate commerce, or whether it was a-“had a
purely local intention.
I could stand corrected on that hut-QUESTION:
MRo MeCALL:

T. believe it did, too.
—I'm quite sure that that’s what

Apex Hosiery stands for.
So that---I see my time is running out--let me just
conclude by saying that I would respectfully submit that the
criterion is:

Is there a real affect?

not answer these questions.

Mandeville Island does

You have to go back of Mandeville

Island,
And if you go back to the origin of this doctrine
of the affectation of interstate commerce, you will find that
the activities of thee© respondents, who are clearly engaged
in intrastate commerce, dp not meet the requisite test for
affecting interstate commerce so as to come within the
Sherman Act,
