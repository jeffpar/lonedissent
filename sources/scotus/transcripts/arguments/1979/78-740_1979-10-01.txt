MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 78-740„ Andrus, the Secretary of the
Interior against Allard.
Mrs. Shapiro,, you stay proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. HARRIET S. SHAPIRO
OH BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MRS. SHAPIRO*

Mr, Chief Justice and May it Please

the Court:
This case is here on direct appeal by the Government
from an order of a Three-Judge District Court in Colorado,
The District Court entered a declaratory judgment
and an injunction restraining the enforcement of two "acts
■ /

designed to protect our nation's birds, the Eagle Protection
Act and tbs Migratory Bird Treaty Act*

,

Those acts prohibit the sale of any parts of
protected birds,
The District Court decided that neither act applies
to birds killed before the. act prohibited the sale of the parts
and that means that under the District Court's decisioni, that
items containing ©Id feathers, that is, preprohibition feathers,
can be sold*
V

Appellees have various commercial interests in
things made by Indians.

The Allards, the Bovises and Ward own

4

stores that trade in Indian items.
Kelley works in the Bovis store and Eros is ©a
appraiser for the Indian items*
Some ©f these items are quite old and rare end
some are made * in part* of feathers.
In response to interrogatories., the Appellees have
identified about 40 such items they own and apparently wish to
sell.

The items contain the feathers of birds protected by

either th© Eagle Protection Act or the Migratory Bird Treaty
Act, feathers that Appellees claim are preprohibition.
Almost all ©f the feathers ©re eagle feathers.
The Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird
Treaty Act both prohibit the sale of any parts of the birds to
which they apply.

They also, of course., prohibit hunting or

killing those birds or any commercial dealing in the birds
the selves,
We have discussed the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in
JK

our main brief and our reply brief in some detail but the first
.

■

i

point 1 want to emphasise today is that this is an Eagle
Protection Act case far more than it is a Migratory Bird Treaty
Act case.
The question of whether the Eagle Act applies to
nil feathers is more important, both to the Government and to
the Appellees than whether the Migratory Bird Treaty Act applies.
QUESTIONs

And if you are correct about the Eagle

5

Act- you wixi, don't you, without consideration of the Migratory
Bird Treaty Act?
MRS, SHAPIRO %

Wall, wa win — assuming that the

Appellees d&n'fc want to take the eagle feathers off of the items
r

they own and sell them as —
QUESTION %

Well, if they wanted to take them off

and took them off, they would be exempt under the ether act,
would they not?
MRS, SHAPIRO:
■ /QUESTION:

No,

Why not?

>

MRS, SHAPIROs

Because fcher© are about seven arti­

facts, 1 think'-*
QUESTION %

Yes,

MRS, SHAPIRO:

That contain both eagle feathers

and Migratory Bird Treaty Act feathers,
QUESTION:

I see.

MRS, SHAPIRO:

So as to those,■ • they could take

the (• •gle feathers off and then there would ba a question as to

whin her they could sell them and that would turn on the.,Appli­
cability of the Migratory Bird 'Treaty Act.
QUESTION:

Now that I have interrupted you, what

do you say about the hypothetical case advert-ad to by your
colleague on the other side, that the vendor or the sailer could
simply take all the feathers off these artifacts and sell the
artifacts without feathers and then make a gift Qg

f©athero?

6

MRS. SHAPIRO;
be a violation.

Well,, that:, we think, would certainly

It would be an evasion of the act.

The act

prohibits the sale, exchange or bartering of the feathers,
QUESTIONs

But not gifts.

MRS* SHAPIRO:

Not gifts and if it was. part of the

same sales transaction, merely separating the artifact would
not make it a different sales transaction.
QUESTION:

Well, it would be a matter of litigating

the facts.
MRS• SHAPIRO:

It certainly would.

That is the

ultimate question,- is that the tryar of fact would have to
decide whether this was the sal® of feathers or a barter or
exchange that was within the prohibitions of the statute.
QUESTIONs

Mrs. Shapiro, the Court did not reach

f-

the constitutional question, did it?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
groi nds.

Ho, it,decided the case on statutory

It stated that the reason that it was deciding it on

statutory grounds was in part to avoid serious constitutional
questions.
QUESTION:

What was the occasion, then, for

continuing a Three-Judge Court?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, wa argued in our jurisdictional

statement that, in fact, the Three-Judge Court was not necessary
because the constitutional questions were not substantial.
QUESTION:

Well, then, should this case not have

7

gone to the Court of Appeals?
MBS* SHAPIROs

That was the argument that; we made

in the jurisdictional statement.

The difficulty waa that the

appeal to the Court ©f Appeals was filed, on© day late and w@
sought —
QUESTIONt

But have w@ not, ©a some occasions,

directed the putative Three**Judge Court to enter a new judgment
and to allow an appeal to the Court of Appeals?
MRS. SHAPIROs
QUESTION t

Yas.

Do you think that would be an appropriate

solution here?
MRS» SHAPIRO:

Yes, that is the solution we urge

this Court to adopt in its jurisdictional statement.
QUESTION:

But despite your urging we noted probable

jurisdiction, did %m not?
MRS, SHAPIROs
QUESTION:

That is right.

Yes.

It is not too late to follow th&t ©ours©

now, ia it?
MRS* SHAPIROs
QUESTION2

No.

On your submission that the constitu­

tional issue is frivolous?
MRS. SHAPIROs
QUESTIONS

Yes.

And despite the three judge® thinking to

the contrary.
MRS. SHAPIRO?

That is right.

Th© reason this case **— that the Eagle protecti©*’
Act Is acre important to this cess for the Appellees is because
almost all the items that they have identified contain ©agio
feathers*

Almost non© contain Migratory Bird Treaty feathers*
The Eagle Act is more important to the Government

in this context because the Appellees* artifacts

are typical.

The question involved her© is more likely to arise
in enforcement of the Eagle Aat than ©£ the Migratory Bird
'Treaty Act.

The question comes up mostly in connection vith

Indian items and the. feathers in those items are usually"'eagle

X turn now to those two -points.

:M

.■

St also .prohibits the possession, sale or purchase of
...v -

eagle parts.
There are only a few carefully™limited exceptions
to this total ban.

The most important for this case is the

exception that permits the possession and transportation of the
parts of eagles taken before the act applied to them.

That is.

9

the «ct says that no on® may possess, purchase or sell eagle
Parti; except that preprohibition eagle parts may be possessed.

Wm submit that the negative implication is absolutely
clear.

Mo on© may purchase or sell preprohibition eagle parts.
This is not a case whore you have to decide what

Congress would have done if they had focused on the problem.
Congress did focus on the problem of preprohibition parts and
decided that they could be possessed but not purchased or sold.
Th® total ban on any sale of eagle feathers?
including preprohibition feathers, is an important part of th®
legislative plan for protecting the living eagle population.
Thera are thro© related factors that justify th©
ban*

First, there is the difficulty in distinguishing between

old and new feathers.

There is no scientifically reliable way

of proving hew old a feather is and certainly not whether, it
come*" from 'an ..'eagle killed between 1940.,

'

Second, there is the high value of feathered Indian
artifacts.

Appellee Ward has a ceremonial shield that: he claim©

is worth $7. ,.500 and the other appellees have identified 12
other items that they have valued at 'more, than $1,000 each.
Third, there is the very real possibility that the
Bald Eagle, our national symbol, may become extinct in..this
country outside of Alaska.

That was the reason Congress passed

the act in 1940, the reason it extended it to the Golden Eagle
in 1962

the problem apparently is that Golden Eagles and

10

Bald Eagles can't be told apart before they reach maturity and
th© reason that Congress strengthened the act in 1S72.
Tha possibility of extinction still exists today,
A recent survey indicates that there are fewer than 800 eagle
neats in th® original 48 states*
The value ©f old, feathered artifacts plus th® ease
of passing off new feathers for old, taken together, give a
strong incentive to counterfeit artifacts for sale or at least
to replace lost feathers in genuine artifacts that are offered
for sale*
Eagles will fe© killed to supply the necessary
feathers and a total ban on. sales destroys the Market and saves
those ©agios,
Evan if a relatively few eagles are saved this way,
those few may be important to th© survival of the species in
the original 48 states.
Congress could have decided that less drastic
methods would be good enough.

It could have struck a different

balance betweehrthe importance of saving the eagle and the
interest of ashlers in Indian artifacts but the point is that
any less drastic measure, for instance 'the registration system
that the District Court thought would be sufficient, would
provide less protection to these eagles.

If there is

any

market for old feathered artifacts, they are so valuable that,
they are likely to be counterfeited»

11

A counterfeiter who believes ha can persuade a
purchaser that the feather® in his article are old» it is also
likely that ha can persuade a registrar end, ultimately, a
judge ©y a. jury ©£ that feet»
For that reason, the most effective deterrent to
counterfeiting and to the eagle killing it requires, is to
abolish the market by a total ban on any sale of feathers and
that is the solution that Congress chose.
That choice violated no constitutional right of
•Appellees.

The violation they claim is the 'taking of their

property without just compensation * •
A® wa explained in our briefs. Appellees have no
;

.

stan ling to raise this constitutional claim with regard to
either act because they have not alleged that, they# themselves,
owned any of these feathers when the act first applied to them«

if wa acquire! the feathers after the relevant acts were passed,
the statute is unconstitutional as it is applied to us.

They

have standing to make that argument#
Surely they have standing to do it.

But you may

thirds the argument is, there is even less to it than the
constitutional issue with respect to feathers that were
acquired prior to the act but they certainly can assert it.

Are you not arguing that they do not

as it applies to pre-Act feathers?

What it did was prevent

them from obtaining something when they acquired the feather©

QUESTION*

Mrs* Shapiro# we have got you interrupted

and '£ would like to ask you one other question# if 2 may»'

You

mentioned the figures on the number of eagle nests in the 48
states.

What is the relevance of the eagle population in

Alaska and what is it?
MRS> SHAPIRO*

Well# the eagle population in

Alaska is somewhat larger than it is, in the lower 48 statos.
am sorry# I do not have the figures on that.
QUESTIONi

There is no shortage ©f eagles in

I

15

Alaska* is theca?

X© your necessity argument valid?

Xs not

this a nationwide statute, not just 48 states covered by
MRS, SHAPIROs

it.

Well* it certainly is a reasonable

conclusion for Congress that the eagle deserves very strict
protection.

The fact that there ar© somewhat more eagles in

Alaska does not alter the fact that the eagle Is in a rather
perilous situation and that Congress was perfectly reasonable
in concluding that a very strict law was appropriate,
QUESTION st

You do not rest on the fact that there

are — X mean* the eagle population really is not terribly

relevant to your argument* then?
MRS, SHAPIRO s

It is relevant to the extent that

Congress was legitimately concerned about preserving eagles.
QUESTION 5

In 48 states or 50?

MRS, SHAPIROs

In 48 states and killing in"Alaska

also interferes with the population up there and they are not
limitless,

QUESTION*

Mrs. Shapiro* this is an inconsequential

question but X am curious.

The Eagle Act was passed in 1940

and the regulations cam© along in 1963» 23 years later,

MRS« SHAPIRO?

No* the Eagle Act was passed in 1940,

The first regulations were in 1941* X believe.

We discussed

this in footnote 7 of our stain brief.
QUESTION s
the other Act?

When did the regulations come out under

IS

MUS, SHAPIRO»

The Migratory Bird Treaty Act?

Well?

X am ear© there have been regulations of stm kind# since
shortly after the Act was enacted,
QUESTION *
but than# you may

he

I did get that impression from the briefs
right*

MRS. SHAPIRO:

The regulations have been certainly

expanded and modified as new birds' are added to the Migratory
Bird Treaty Act but it is rot a question of their not having
been there.

For Instance -**

QUESTION:

If there were a delay# 2 would be

interested in why but you say there has not bean,
MR3, SHAPIRO:

There certainly has bean no delay

unde* the Eagle Act and the regulations under the Migratory
Bird Treaty Act originally were fairly minor.
Tha Migratory Bird Treaty Act is primarily" a
hunting act and it was --** the regulations were modified in
early 1913 to mjafce absolutely explicit 'the Secretary* spinterprefcafclon of the Act as applying to pr@~prohibition feathers.
Before that, they were arguably ambiguous but there certainly
have been regulations.

Well, they have been regulations sine®

1968.
QUESTION:

How can you Bay they are arguably ambi­

guous when they almost parroted the language of the statute,
which you said was abundantly clear?
MRS, SHAPIRO$

Well, on th© theory that regulations

that in the Eagle hat Congress did specifically focus on this

the statutory language itself?

a very limited period and only after, he has made the determina­
tion that that won't interfere with the survival of the popula­

QUESTIONt

Without those specific exceptions' that

would have been'prohibited by ths'statute*
MRS, 'SHAPIROs

Oh# yes, . Yes and the religious

Wa also pointed out in our briefs that under the
Regional Rail Reorganisation Act cases# tha remedy of any me

19

who doaa have standing Is a suit in the Court of Claims under
tha Tucker Act for just compensation.

We do not suggest that

anyone could prevail in such a suit baaaus® we do not think that
these acta under any circumstances involve a taking in the con­
stitutional' sense.
Bui; ©van if we are wrong about the merits* these
acts could in setae factual circumstances involve taking of
property requiring just compensation.

Tho®© circumstance# have

not been shown here.
This record just does not provide an adequate basis
for deciding the novel and complex issues that would have to he
faced before a court could properly conclude there.had hem a
taking here.
For examplej. Appellees' claim is that th© Acts

:js

ha 1 mentioned before* we do not agree with" the

20

Appelle®®* suggestion that the hm can fee avoided* either by
separating the feathers and attempting to sake them a separate
transaction or, of course, that the article can be sold intact
and just claimed that it was a sale of the artifact without the
feathers and a gift of the attached feathers.
But it is still true that the Acts prohibit only th@
©ale of feathers and of products composed of feathers,
Appellee Ward* for instance# could remove the nine
©agio feathers from his ceremonial shield and sell it without
violating the Act*
There is no way of telling from this record «hat
the value of the shield would be in that condition but any
burden on ktrd is limited to the difference between, the value
of ■; ha shield with the feathers and its value without them,
discounted, probably, by his right to retain possession of the
shield intact if he chooses to do so.
Since the record does not show how much the value
of any artifact would be reduced if its feathers were'removed,
there is no way of telling what burden the Act places on' any
Appellee, let alone of concluding that the burden is on® which
in fairness and justice must be shared by the public.'
But there is no need for this Court to advance into
that thicket,

Appellees have simply not met their burden of

showing that the Acts take their property without just compen­
sation.

OH BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR, AKOLTs

Mr* Chief Justice and May it Please

the Courts
Thi Appellant®* argument has solely addressed-itself
to the preservation of existing wildlife*

In this particular

provide for the maximum encouragement of ithe- continued pre­
servation of such.items by private noons.
Whatever else might be said 6£ the regulations by
essentially having mad© it unlawful to continue with the ability
to preserve such artifacts by private means

,

they are certainly

contrary to th© express policy of the Historic Sites and
Antiquities Act.

Thia action is specifically concerned, with 42 pre­
set feathered Indian artifacts*

Thay stand admitted in the

record as being pre»Aofc and additionally they stand admitted as
feeing valueless if they are unable to fee sold with' the feathers
intact*

QUESTIONi

Well, the District Court apparently

approached the case on the basis that even if your client did
accr ire these artifacts after the passage of the Acts, th®
relevant Acta just did not apply to them.
MR, AKOLTj

That is correct. Your Honor,

Upon

the basis —
QUESTION 8
MR. AKOLTs

And that was your position?
That was our position as well, buttressed

by the prior determinations of several federal district courts
from the 1020* s on that have stated specifically with regard to
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act that, such Act did not include pre­
existing feathers.
Those various cases from Montana and Tfjseae were

24
the only statutory interpretation ©£ th® Migratory Bird Act
until this case i® to be resolved by this Court so as inter­
preted by the Federal District Courts throughout the country
there was a universal interpretation that the Acts did not
apply to pre-existing artifacts.

So long­

The Appellees

make no claim whatever to be entitled to any rights to own,
tra6.®* barter or whatever with respect to poat«Act artifacts,
artifacts that are mad© with feathers ©f any illegally-taken

We claim no continuing right to the taking of

QUESTIONS

But is there not some tie-in between

the standing question and when your clients acquired the
feathers in question as with respect to the passage of the two
Acts?
MR, AKOLT;

If the Acts had been interpreted as

applying to. pafts-Act items, the Solicitor General's office does
have a point that-we would never have acquired the rights which
could thereafter have been claimed to have been taken by die
unconstitutional regulations which were sought to be upheld.
That is not the ease, that is not the status of the

25

MR*. AKOLT:

With respect to these artifacts.
That is correct*

The premise of the Solicitor General's office is
that, these ifceas must be totally banned from commerce upon the

27
basis that ther® £® an existing market for counterfeit Iteras
which mast fca supplied by the taking of existing birds fffea the
wild.

These promises are not supported by the record and their

position is an impermissible attempt in’ which to infer a nega­
tive; from an

omission in the statutes or, more particularly,

to infer a negative from the positive statement, none of which
%

can be statutorily sustained*
QUESTION*

Mr, Akolt, do they not start the plain

language argument and then they say this is the reason for the
plain language and how do you read their plain language argument,
that, the coverage of the Act is broad on barter, sal© and so
forth? the only exception is with respect to pra-Acfe items,
their possession and transportation,
MR, AKOLTi
QUESTION*

Yes, Your Honor,
How do you meet that argument?

MR, AKOLT:

The Act® themselves do not specifically

inoliwl® pare-*Act items.

They are concerned with birds and parts

of birds whereas this Court and the issue concerned with this
Court is something in addition to birds and parts thereof*
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act alone also includes
the term "products" which products I will address shortly .
Mr-y, Justice Holmes, in McBoyle versus the United
Statea 283 United States 25, was concerned with whether or not
the term "motor vehicle® included.a boat or an airplane and he
said, "In common terms it called to mind a picture of a thing

moving across the land s an automobile."
Th® same determination can be applied to the use
of the term "bird” and "bird parts,* in these statutes.

include pre-existing Indian artifacts any more than ifc would

QUESTION:
Act products?

But you say the Act 'would apply to post.-

32
MS. AKOLT%

The Act would apply to post*Act products

because necessarily the transaction would have applied to
-illegally-taken birds and fchesre can be no property rights in .
such birds.

So it would apply to post-Act products is our posi­

tion that the Act did not contemplat:© then-existing artifacts
at the time of the passage of the Act.
The premise of the Appellants is not supported by
the record on this case.

Obviously, their concern with what

might be counterfeited does not have any relevance to what is
admittedly a pre-Act item nor is their presumption shown to be
any legislative concern.
I have alluded to the fact that in the entire history
of the Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Birds Treaty

Act

there is not a single Congressional reference to any concern
In 108 Congressional Record

with respect to pre-existing items.1

at f-ge 5511t as cited by the Appellants in their reply brief,
ther* was a reference to the legal taking of eagles at the time
of the passage of the Amendment to'the Eagle Protection Act.
The concern of the Congress at that time was to
..

i

stc* what was not only legal but was ^encouraged by the payment
of bounties by various states during the early part of the 1960s►
It does not relate to any concern with pre-existing
iteras and it does not, in fact, relate to any concern with any
illegally-taken eagles.
The concern of the Congress was to stop the legal

33

killing of eagles which was taking place at that. time.
Nor is their premise one which can be justified by
the case law which is reported under either the Migratory Bird
Act or th© Eagle Protectior* Act.

In the nearly 60 years of

administration of the Migratory Bird Act and nearly 40 years
of administration of the Eagla Protection Act there is not a
single reported decision in which the age of a particular item
was involved in th® prosecution with the exception of the 19?5
ease in the Western District of Oklahomae United States versus
Blanket, which hah bean cited in our brief.
In that case, it may be noted that th© government
prosecutor prevailed and was able to distinguish between a
post*~&ct artifact and a pre-Act artifact.

Nor is th® existence

of a counterfeit market sustainable from the Appellants* own
knowledge.

In reply to Interrogatory number 11 as cited at

page 8 of our brief, the Appellants themselves have stated
that they have no knowledge or information with respect to the
taking of illegal wildlife for tha purpose of the creation of
counterfeit craft items.
The premises are not sustainable from the record
and not being based upon fact, their regulations are not
rationally based.
Mr. Justice Cardoso, in DaParkay Company versus
Evans, 29? U«S. 216, suggested that in considering the applica­
tion of a statute one must consider its several part® and their

34
relation* both physical and logical to each other.

The permit sections particularly* of both the Eagle
Protaction Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act* Section 668A
and 704* focus exclusively on permission to have the Secretary
permit the continued killing of eagles and other migratory birds
under the various acts.

Hon© of th@ discretionary matters

which h© had to consider* which include such things as breeding
habits* the times and flights of migratory birds* have any
applicability to pre-existing artifacts.
5

..

All of the factors are relevant to the taking of
existing bird© and it is solely that

to

which the Secretary8©

discretion is directed.
The statutes themselves do not contemplate that pre­
ach items would have become regulated and made unlawful.

Cer­

tainly* as the- Appellants suggest* in Section 668A they say
there is no authority ©van to make such a disoretionary decision*
to permit the acquisition of a cultural object by a museum or
any other institution but the Act specifically does provide
that the Secretary has the discretion to permit the continued
killing of eagles from the wild.
It is not logical to suggest that if the Acts were
contemplated to apply to pre-Act items and in light of the
express policy of the Congress that these are items which are
to be preserved* it is not likely that they contemplated that
all sales of pre-Act items would be completely foreclosed

35
without any discretion whatever having been granted to the
Secretary to permit the sale of what cannot be a threat to
©listing wildlife*
QUESTION?

Well, now, I take it that you are not

suggesting that the Secretary has discretion to permit this,
either, if that would simply ba conceding that the Act applies»
MR, AKOLTs

We do not think that the Acts granted

him that discretion because wo think that none is required.
That is correct-

But it is not logical to state the negativa,

that he has no discretion whatever in light of the existing
policy.
With respect to the Migratory Bird Act and the us©
of the term "products,*5 that Act was amended in 1974 to conform
with the language of the convention between the United States
and Japan which had been concluded in 1972.
The Act, for the first him© in 48 years of its
passage, referred to products but which products is clarified
by the reference to the convention between the United States
and Japan as cited in our brief at page 14.
It. is clear that the convention, which are the
operative terms of the Migratory Bird Act, stated that birds
and parts thereof and products thereof which had been taken
illegally were contemplated as being subject to regulation, a
specific exclusion of the intent to Include pre-existing items.
I think the crosslight of the subsequent statute,

3S
particularly the Endangerd Species Act of 1973;, throws consi­
derable light on the Congressional intent in these Acts with
respact t© pre-existing property,
Th© Endangered Species hat of '73 is not simply a
comparable statute but it Is, in fact; a co-applicable statute
with respect t© the bald eagle t© which the Appellant® have
drawn ©ur attention,
A® this Court noted in Tennessee Valley Authority
versus Hill; the Endangered Species Act of 1973 was passed to
afford th® greatest protection to truly endangered species but
that Act and the regulations adopted pursuant to that Act..
Section 1538B, clearly provide that the Act does not apply to
fish or wildlife held in captivity or controlled environment
an the effactive date of the statute, which was December 28th,
1973,

*
Thp -Act does not apply to the object itself unless

it was being held on that date for a commercial

purpose.

In

'V*. v . ■

large part, the objects being considered by this Court•in this
action Would qualify for such an exclusion under the Endangered
Species Act as they were being held in private collections as
private property.
Under the Endangered Species Act, the one that
protects, that gives the greatest protection to truly endangered
species, the artifacts could subsequently be sold.
Is it logical to state that under the Migratory

37
Bird Act, which protects such birds as millions of blackbirds
that the Appellants themselves were called upon to kill by the
millions in 1976, that an artifact containing one of those
feathers is illegal?
But under the Endangered Species Act where Congress
did specifically consider pre«Act items, the exclusion is
granted?
Similarly, in the Marines Mamautl Protection Act,
16 U«S« Cod© Section 1361, the specific exclusion ©f then*»
existing artifacts was granted,

The rational conclusion which

is to be drawn from the lack of administrative enforcement
during the last 50 years in which not a single case from the

1920*3 until the prosecutions that have culminated in this
appeal were made with respect to pre*Act items should foe consi­
dered by this Court as a determination of what truly was being
regulated by the Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory' Bird
Act*

It ie our position that Congress was

•P

-

...

not considering the inclusion of the passage of the Eagle
Protection Act and tha Migratory Bird Act.
This Court itself has recognised that the subject
of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act was living birds.

Th® Act

was originally upheld in Missouri versus Holland based upon the

39

fact that the subject of the Act was living birds, not birds
that had been reduced to possession, not artifacts but living
birds which had no permanent habitat in any particular state.
It was upon this basis that the federal power to
enact the Migratory Bird Treaty Act was upheld,.
This Court originally inquired as to whether or
not the direct appeal was appropriate from the Three-Judgo
District Court»

It is to be noted that the constitutional

issues upon which the determination of the District Court was
made remained in the case until it® determination.

Those

constitutional issues show additionally that it was improbable
that Congress intended this Act to apply to existing artifacts.
The improbability is shown by th® analysis

that

this Court provided in th© Penn Central Railroad case decided
last year.

In that case, the Court extensively analysed the

fairness of a provision regulating the ability to make use; of
the Grand Central Terminal.

In short, based upon tha constitutional principle

no provisions for fairness or adequate determination as to

MRS. SHAPIROs

The first, til© Appellee suggests

that the exemption in tha Endangered Species Act for articles

We do not agree.

We believe that the exemption in

tha Endangered Species Act is, in effect, has precisely the

A® we point out in our reply brief on pages 3 and
4 and particularly the footnotes, the Endangered Species Act

43,
persons holding such goods and animals for other than commercial

that although the original purchaser, the original holder, as

MRS• SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

— to cover a sale.

MRS, SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes,

That is right.

Mrs, Shapiro, I think that Mr. AkoXt

has made one argument that I am not sure you have answered yet.
He argues that the statute

expressly permits the Secretary to

exempt present takings if necessary for museums and exhibitions
and rare situations.

But that there is no statutory permission

no statutory authority for the Secretary to exempt fch© sale of
an existing artifact made of pre-Act eagles and that does not
make much sense.
Do you agree that there is no statutory authority
in the Secretary now to say to these people, "Well, we know you
have pre-Act items.

We will let you sell them to the Smith-

soninn Institute if you want.*
MRS. SHAPIROs
QUESTION:

You cannot do that, can you?

You have to give them to them.

And it does not seem to be very logical

if it gives the Secretary the authority to permit more killing
of birds but will not let the Secretary even allow us an
innocuous sale like that to take place which tends to siggest
'

-'7

.-I

that the Act was really focusing on live birds rather than. preAct birds.

How do you respond to that argument?
MRS■ SHAPIRO:

The point is that the only time tha

43
Secretary can issue permits for the killing is in the very
narrow situations identified in the statute and only after a
decision that it will not hinder the bird population.
QUESTION:

How do you explain the fact that if

Congress thought of that problem* why did not Congress also
give you the authority to permit the sal© of a pre-Act artifact
which certainly could not be harmful to anything?
MRS* SHAPIRO:

The problem is that as long as you

have any sales of any artifacts* pre or post-Act, then you gat
into the problem of being sure that those artifacts — that the
feathers in the artifacts* not so much the artifacts themselves
but that the feathers in the artifacts are, in fact*

pre-Act;

as long as you have any kind of a commercial incentive to make*
to substitute post-Act feathers for pre-Act feathers* then that
is the kind of thing that Congress wanted to guard against.
It is once the commercial incentive —
QUESTION:

But surely* how would the policy "of the

Act be thwarted if the Secretary of the Interior had the au­
thority to say to these people* "You can sell your present
inventory for $5*000 and if we ever catch you with another
feather you are going to jail but you can sail what you now
have*" how would that do any harm?
V

MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Well* that would — I mean —

Well* why would not Congress allow that

if it would allow them to go out and kill some more eagles?

44
MRS* SUM?IRO;

Congress3 theory was that you out

off the market» that that was the most effective way ox
stopping the killing; as long as you permit any market, you
have got an incentive to try and counterfeit.

It is the

commercial incentive that Congress was worried about, plus the
value.
QUESTION?

But it would permit — it does have the

authority to let a live eagle be killed and sold to a museum,
even though it is done for commercial purposes.
MRS, SHAPIROS

That is right, if it is for a

scientific purpose —

MRS. SHAPIROs
