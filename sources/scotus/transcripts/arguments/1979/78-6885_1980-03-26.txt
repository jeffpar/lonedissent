ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M.

EBEL,

ESQ,,

OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. EBEL;

Mr. Chief Justice, anti may .it pleas®

the ('our;;
This is a sentencing procedures ease end it
raises Important constitutional questions about the pro­
cedures that need to be followed in sentencing defendants«.
This is not a case that challenges inherently
habitual sentencing statutes, and it is not a case' .that
challenges the excessiveness of a ^10-year sentence for a
person who commits the kind of crimes that the defendants
Hicks bar» committed.
Rather, it is a case that challenges the method
of imposing that sentence on him,
man.

Hicks is a young blade

He was 28 years old at the time of the trial.

He

and his 2'odefondant were convicted by a .jury in Oklhaozea
of a single sale of heroin worth $50.
Now, Oklahoma, has a peculiar statute which says
that a defendant in. Oklahoma has a right to be sentenced
by a jury, and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has
said that that is a sacred right that may not be lost

except by express waiver,,
Ho», because neither defendant her® waived that
right, the jury was reconvened to sentence these two de­
fendants*

Hicks5 codefendant received the minimus sen­

tence possible under the heroin statute, that is five
fears.

Kicks, on, the other hand, was charged under the

habitual criminal statute in Oklahoma,

And I should

pause for a minute to tell you that Oklahoma has two
habitual criminal statutes, 51(A) and 51(3).
V

51(B) is a

'

■ i‘

mandatory statute and it says that if you have been eonvieted of two prior felonies, you muct be sentenced to
the %axlmm term permissible under the third offense
plus an additional 20 years, and that formula here would
•calculat® to a 40-year sentence for Hicks,
How, the other statute is 51(A) and that is a
discret.ionary statute.

1:1 •, j

That statute says that if you

eonasitted one or more prior offenses, that the jury may
\

:

'

;

-|fp

sentence you to anything it wishes between ten years; and

lit

%.

.

■ ! I'
•

} ;j

?

Well, at Hicks trial the Jury was given ‘evidence
of two prior felony convictions.

Hicks did not challenge

that evidence, so the judge instructed the jury that if
you find. Hicks as guilty of the two prior felonies?, you

mutt fir A him guilty under 51(B) and you must sentence
him to

0 years in jail*

5
The jury listened to those instructions carefully
and it followed them and it returned a 4o«year mandatory
habitual, criminal sentence against him.
How. while that case- was pending on appeals, the
Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals decided a second
ease that was called Thigpen v. State, and in that ease
the: Oklahoma 'court held that 51(B) was unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

Do you think Thigpen rested on state

constitutional grounds or federal constitutional grounds?
MR. EBEL:

Your Honor. I think it rested on

federal constitutional grounds s although It doesn't say
•

" :

-

•

.

\.

i

I

• v :

so in the opinion, and ay opinion that It rests on
federal grounds rests on the fact that the appendix
ati
•

i

fcachsd to the opinion la premised upon federal grounds,
and1 it appears to have been cited with approval by the
majority opinion.
QUESTION:

The District Court of Oklahoma?

MR. EBEL:

That's correct,

QUESTION:

So when you said a little while ago

that Oklahoma has two statutes e you really mean now It
has only one?
MR. EBEL:

That’s correct, Your Honor, now it

QUESTION:

Well, what if W2 were to conclude

has one.

that Thigpen was incorrectly, decided as a matter of

6
federal constitutional law?
MHo EBEL:

Well, I think, Tour Honor, that that

issue is n' t directly before this Court, because Thigpen
was not appealed here.

At least when Hicks was sentenced

at the Court of Criminal Appeals, I think that Thigpen
represented the law as interpreted by Oklahoma, and so
fox5 the case at least of Hick© we can assume that 51(B)
was improper»
QUESTION:

Well, there is a certain abstraction

about the whole thing perhaps on both sides.

The Oklahoma

legiul&tir® passes a statute, the Oklahoma Court of
"Criminal Appeals says it is unconstitutional on federal
groundsc

Say this Court now were in this particular

proceeding to conclude that that conclusion was wrong.
The statute is still in existence, it is just two courtshave expressed two different opinions as to whether or
not. it 1$ consitutlonal»
MR* EBEL:

No, I don't think the statute- is in

existence any more because it has been declared unconsti­
tutional by a final decision by the state's highest court
before tiis case ever came up here.
QUESTION:

Your view is that unless the state

took an appeal to this Court on the assumption that there
was i federal question involved, they have acquiesced in
that matter?

7
HR. EBEL:

Thatfs correct.

1 think it might be

said to fee bad law today,
QUESTION:

Let lie ask you this':

Supposing that

after Thigpen had been decided and after this ease had
been decided one way or the others this Court were to
cose down with a square ruling that indicated that made
clear that Thigpen was wrongly decided if it rested on
federal constitutional grounds p would you then say that
Oklahoma legislature had to enact a new statute rather
than sit:ply having the old on© revived?
HR, EBEL:

Oh* absolutely* Your Honor.

I think

that once Thigpen is final and not appealed* that that
statute is invalidated because the law changes* it doesn't
spring back* all the legislation around the country that
might hrve bean stricken under on® interpretation of the
law.

I think the legislature would clearly have t© re­

enact the statute.
QUESTION:

What is your authority for that?

MR. EBEL:

I don't have any to cite to you at

this tire. Your Honor* but I believe that to be the law.
We site in this case both due process and equal
protaction and Eighth Amendment arguments.

Because of

the shortness of time* I a® going to argue primarily the
due process case Issues here* as 1 think it Is primarily
a procedural case

8
Our first due process argument Is that Hick®
was denied due process when he was sentenced in violation
of the state*® own laws.

Mew* there is no doubt that

Oklahoma, has created a right to be sentenced by a jury.
The Oklahoma statute

926 explicitly says so.

The

Oklahoma Court of Crimina?. Appeals has explicitly said

v|Jf
that there is such a right end it Is shored.

;§
if v

The state in its responsive brief at page 24
acknowledges this fact when it says* *Although the United
■?

-

j

States Constitution does not mandate the imposition of
punishment by a Jury* the State of Oklahoma has statu­
torily created such a right.w
QUESTIONi

When Thigpen was decided during

the pendency of this appeal, could the state have gone
•back to the process of new sentencing?

You would have

to reconstitute the original Jury* would you* if you
were to try that?
MR. EBEL:

I don't think you need to recon­

stitute the original Jury* four Honor,

X think that: the

statute simply requires & jury sentencing.

It doesn't

say that it has to be the same jury* ao X think it could
be a new Jury.
QUESTION:

If we hypothetically agreed with

you now5 would Oklahoma assemble a jury and go through
the sentencing process under the surviving statute?

9
MR. EBEL:

Yes, I believe so, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And h© might get *10 years or he might

not got *50 gear’s.
MR, EBEL:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

It Is mandatory under 51(B) but per-

missive unver 51(A), is that correct?
HR. EBEL:

That* s correct 8 and 51(B) is what

has been thrown out and which we think is now a final
decision in the State of Oklahoma,

So unless it were re-

enacted,, 51(A) is the statute under which they would
have to proceed.
QUESTION:

You probably can’t tell us, but was

there any indication that you are aware of that the
state considered that possibility?
MR, EBEL:

Of reenacting 51(B)?

QUESTION:

Ho, of a new sentencing, remanding.

MR, EBEL:

Your Honor, there appears to be no

indication that the Court of Criminal Appeals considered

that.

They

.just simply said we are going to impose a

new sentence under 51(A) because it Is not going to
prejudice you, since we are going to issue the same
length of sentence as before.
QUESTION:

And you say that when the Supreme

Court did that, they were usurping the jury’s function.
MR, EBEL:

Absolutely

10
QUESTION:

Perhaps the state will tell us about

that a little later,
MR. EBEL:

All right*

Your Honor,, there Is no doubt that the sentence
here was issued by the Court of Criminal Appeals rather
than the jury because the defendant Hicks does come before

this Court sentenced only under 51(A) and the jury never
purported to l&sue any sentence under 51(A) itself, only
the Court of Appeals presumed to do that.
Further, 51(A) requires the exercise of discre­
tion and the jury nerer presumed to exercise discretion.
'In fact., it war. instructed that it could not exercise
discretion.

Only the Court of Appeals

QUESTION:

I want to be sure I understand your
‘

position,.

- 'if I

I did not read the Court of Appeals opinion

as imposing a new sentence*

I thought they affirmed the

sentence that had been imposed mandatorily before,'

They

said we must —•» all they said, in ono sentence, we must
fin'd, however9 that the defendant was not prejudiced by
this use of this statute in that the sentence Imposed is
within the range of punishment authorised by 51(A)*

Does

that cay they have imposed the sentence themselves?
MR. EBEL:

Your Honor, they didn't impose a

new length of sentence, they incorporated the old length
but they based the sentence upon a different- statute.

11
And under* Brown v. State in Oklahoma, and another* ease
that we also cite In our briefs, as well as the Lang
ease decided by thin Court, a sentence under an unconsti­
tutional statute is T©id, is go»©, there is nothing to it.
Oklahoma law says that.

And they have said that 51(B)

was mecnetitutionala so under Oklahoma? s own law the
sentence under 51(B) has disappeared»
QUESTION:

Well, they don't say that.

MR. EBEL:

Well, the Oklahoma. —

QUESTION:

You say be right as a matter of

Oklahoma law, but that is not what their opinion says*
MR. EBEL:

Well. I think. Your Honor, it in

essence does say that because It says that we are..going
to sentence under 51(A) * it is a different statutory —
QUESTION:

It does not say that.

That is my

very point, it does not say we are going to sentence
under 51(A).

It simply says that the defendant was hot

prej idiesc. by the use of this statute in that the
sentence imposed

and they are referring to the one

imposed by the Jury, as I read it ~~ is within the. range
authorized by 51(A)*

That doesn't say we're imposing

a sentence under 51(A) as I read it anyway.
MR. EBEL:

Your Honor —

QUESTION:

I don't know if It makes any differ­

ence, but I Just raise this question. -

22
QUESTIONt

I understand your point to bo that

the jury was instructed

that it had to return a 40year

sentence., is that it?
MH- EBELt

If the Jury was instructed it had to

return a 40~year sentence if it found that Kicks had two
prior felony convictions.

but that.

-

A

The Oklahoma law, as I said, which isrs’t ;dis-

pufred, I don’t believe, that the sentence under*' 51(B) is
void., either there is a new sentence imposed on Hicks or

he standi today with no sentence at all, and I am sure
the state isn’t going to say he stands with no sentence
at ail.

And if he doesn’t stand under a sentence that

was valid undo? the Jury, somebody h&s had to put a new
sentence on him and that somebody has to have been the
Count of Criminal Appeals.
QUESTION:

I*a not sure you are making your

strongest argument®
MR. EBEL:

Wellif that is true, then several,

things have happened that have violated Hicks 9 due process
rights.

First, this sentence was imposed by somebody

other than the jury, and we think that that violates one
of Oklahoma’s sacred rights.
QUESTION:

Well, that doesn’t involve a federal

question» does it?
*

MR* EBEL:

Oh, I think It does. Your Honor*

iiie way ,#e read the due process clause, & state has to
l

'

‘ -v

follow its own procedures when substantive and substantial
•

a

' rights are Involved, and if it deviates from Its own pro­
cedures in fonts of substantive rights, that is aviolatib.i of She due process clause.
QUESTION:: You mean if a — do you think It is
unconstitutional for an appellate court to sentence?
MR. EBEL:

No, Your Honor, I —

QUESTION:

1 mean a state appellate court to

MR. EBEL:

I think If the laws permit it and if

sentence.

the appellate court gives the defendant notice and a

14
hearing* then an appellate court may impose sentence.
QUESTION:

Well* if an Oklahoma appellate court

from time to time says it is not inconsistent with
Oklahoma law in any way, every now and then we will just
sentence ourselves when we think the defendant deserves
it, the state statute may say something but we will just
sentence him ourselves.

Doss that violate some federal

constitutional
MR. EBEL:

I think so.

I think the due process

clause says that the law and order applies to the state,
to -the court as well as to the citizens 9 and if the state
and' the courts decide that every now arid then we are just
.not going to follow our law because it is more convenient
for us rot to, the due process clause doesn't permit that.
QUESTION:

But isn’t the state court *s reading
i

of Jits cum law the final version of It so far as we are

concerned?
y

,

ME. EBEL:

•

*

Well, the state court here naver in­

terpreted 926 as having been abbrogated by any abilities
that it had.

It never said that its rights to modify

sentence s could be used to cut off a jury right.

The

state court never interpreted the law in that regard
0

and this Court in the retention doctrine has said that
when there is a clear state statute it can rely on that
state statute without looking to any requirement that

15
the state*s highest court interpret that statute.
But isn't there a presumption of

QUESTION:

validity to a conviction coming from a state court that
the state has at least Insofar as its own laws &v& eon—

is the final interpretor of them?
MR» EBEL:

I don't know of any presumption of

validity, Your Honor»

I think that the due process

clause doesn’t have such a presumption, and this Court
can look at the procedures and see if the court has followed the law.,

I don't know of any law here that gives a

.greator presumption to a coert that may not be following

gests to you that the Oklahoma law is what the' Oklahoma
court says it is, and if the Oklahoma statute says: Jury
sentencing but the Oklahoma Supreme Court says, well,
from tiL.e to time we can sentence ourselves in the right
circumstances and that this is not inconsistent with
Oklahoma law, how does that violate the Constitution?
MR. EBEL:

Well, the Oklahoma court didn’t say

that whf.t it was doing was not inconsistent with Oklahoma
law*

It didn't say this is not inconsistent with your

16
Jury rights.

It sals simply this doesn’t prejudice you,

and I an saying it does prejudice Hicke,

They are not

saying that Oklahoma law doesn’t give Hicks a Jury right.
They are- saying we can do this because we don’t think it
Is prejudicial to you, and I think it was prejudicial to
Hicks.
QUESTION:

There is nothing implicit in that.

Isn’t there a holding also that it is not a contraveniIon
'■oli' their own state constitution?
MR. EBEL:

MsXI. If there is such an implicit

holding, then X think state courts are virtually immune
fro® any challenge- that they are not following their own

QUESTION:

It has to he implicit.,

You don't

think they said to themselves, oh, we are going to do
this but we think it violates the federal Constitution.
MR. EBEL:

I don’t —

QUESTION:

They must have .implicitly thought

that it didn’t.
MR. EBEL:

I think what they 3aid was this may

not comply with all the procedural safeguards we have,
but we don’t think it is prejudicing Hicks and so why
dees he care, because we are going to give him the same
length of sentence.
QUESTION:

The question here is whether there

IT
is some federal constitutional right 0

You said that you

thouijht that federal constitutional rights were violated
in several respects.
MR. EBEL:

That?s correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

You have given us one.

Do you have

another one?
MR. EBEL:

Yes, Your Honor,

The other one Is

we think that the federal Constitution requires notice
and hearing before you can impose a sentence and that «—

we sentence you to blank years?

argue on. that is that —

I am not asking for syllogism, I

13
MR* SBEL:

Well, they said that we are sentencing

you — they said you were sentenced under 51(B), that Is
an unconstitutional statute, but we don’t think you are
prejudiced if w© affirm a ^O-year sentence under 51(A),
QUESTION:

Wells isn’t affirming differant from

sent encing?
MR* EBEL:

Well, I think it is a different word

but I think it means the same thing.
QUESTIOH:

I see.

QUESTION:

Well, they said we ages with you,

Mr, Hicks, that the statute under which you were sentenced
is unconstitutional.

It would then follow, I suppose,

that- he was not sentenced at all,
ME. EBEL:

That’s correcto

QUESTION;

It was a void or invalid sentence.

HR. EBEL:

That is wh&t Oklahoma law says.

QUESTION:

Therefore, if he is under any sen.»

tenee at all, it has to be as a result of his sentence
imposed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma.
MR, EBEL:

That’s right. Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And you say the Supreme Court has no

authority to fix it at this 20 extra years.
MR. EBEL:

What I would argue on the second

point, Your Honor, is that we think the U.S, Constitution
requires the defendant to have an opportunity for notice

19
anci a heaping before a sentence can be imposed, and we
think that Hicks here did not have such an opportunity to
present any evidence on his behalf under 51(A), and that
that violates the United States Constitution quit® apart
from any of your readings of the Oklahoma law.
QUESTIOM:

And you think the only remedy avail­

able; by the time the appeal was argued in the state
Supreme Court was t© send it back to the trial court for
a new sentencing procedure under 51(A)?
ME. EBEL:

That’s correct,, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Because, as Mr» Justice Stewart sug­

gested. at the time of the oral argument in that court,
the Supreme Court, there was no valid sentence outstanding»
MR., EBEL:

Right, and the Oklahoma court cases

are absolutely explicit on that point, the Brown case and
the otl er one that I cite in my brief»

When the Oklahoma

Court of Criminal Appeals faced Kicks and said that 51(B)
was unconstitutional, Hicks stood before them without a
valid sentence at all.
QUESTION:

I understood you to say before that

you would be quite satisfied if the

even if your client

were not, as a matter of law you would be quite satisfied
If this Court were to have the case go back down through
the Supreme Court to the trial court for resentencing
under the procedure of 51(A)»

20
MR. EBEL:

Thatf s corrects Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And you might —

MR. EBEL;

Tour Honor, not necessarily under

51(A) .j because out third argument is that we think 51(A)
itself is unconstitutional on its face, but at least we
would be satisfied if he were resentenced and we think
the sent?nee ought to be conducted under the basis heroin
statute rather than 51(A), but at least to be sentenced.
QUESTION:

That would avoid the enhancement of

the sentence?
MR. EBEL:

That?s correct, and It would ©ntit1©

him to be punished somewhere between five years and
twenty which is the spread permitted under the —
QUESTION:

Then my first assumption has fallen

apart, feisn*t it, that you would be satisfied if it went
back for resentencing.

I thought you had told in© earlier

that you wanted to be resentenced under 51(A) in my prior
questions to you»
MR. EBEL:

Tour Honor, what I meant to say was

that we irould be satisfied with resentencing.

We are not

asking to reopen the guilt phase of this trial, and we
think fchit resentencing could be under a newly constituted
jury and would not need to be under the old jury.

If I said that we would be satisfied with resen­
tencing under 51(A), I misspoke because our third due

21
process argument is that 51(A) is unconstitutional on its
fae© because it is excessively broad and gives no stand­
ards and direction for the jury in the sentencing process,
and we think therefore the proper sentence would toe under
the heroin statute„
QUESTION:

That never having been decided in

the Oklahoma court, it would be no question for us to
reach her®, would it?
MR„ IBEL:

Well, it was not presented before

the Oklahoma court, Year Honor,

I think, however, that

under a variety of doctrines that this Court has articu­
lated in the past, which you are very familiar with, it
could be readied by this Court for Judicial economy,
that is >—

federal constitutional issue were not raised in the state

Isn’t it true generally, Mr, Efoei,

that in Oklahoma Juries are given wide latitude in impos­
ing sentences?

Yes.

When it is out of your own life.

You raise Eighth. Amendment questions.

MR» EBEL:

Yes. Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And equal protection?

MR, EBEL:

Yes, Your Honor,

QUESTION:

Are you just submitting them in your

brief o•*—
MR, EBEL:

Your Honor» I think probably I don't

have the time to go into those in car®.

The equal protec­

tion argument that I would assert primarily is that the

state has treated two categories of people dlfferently 9
those that were originally sentenced under 51(1) and those
like Hicks who were originally sentenced under 51(B) and
then resentenced under 51(A),
QUESTION:

How isany of these issues that you

are relying on here did you assert as constitutional
federal issues in the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals?
MR., EBEL:

The only two that clearly were not

raised bslow were our third and fourth due process argu»

'■4

the failure of the court to give any reasons for its

Beyond that, it is a little hard to tell :®x~

aptly what was raised because the constitutional arguments
asserted below just broadly speak about violation of the

United States Constitution and they did not articulate

QUESTION:

You didn't argue the case than "in

the Court of Appeals?
MR, EBEL:

/
No,

4 ' §

I am court appointed by this

Co art to represent Hicks here on certiorari.

He was

represented by the public defender below to the decision
of the Court of Criminal Appeals9 and when the Court o
Criminal Appeals sentenced

him under 51(A)3 he carried

the case on then pro se himself and filed Ms petition
for certiorari in this Court pro se and was granted pro se.

25
QUESTION:

Mr„ Eh elt one of your due process

arguments, as I understand it6 is that whoever fisea the
sentence5 there should have been notice and an opportunity
on behalf of the defendant to argue what the sentence
should be.
MR. EBSL:

That8s correct.

QUESTIOH:

But he did not receive that in the

trial court because the Jury was instructed that there
was a mandatory requirement of forty years9 and h® didn’t
receive it. in the Court of Appeals because the Court of
Appeals Imposed the sentence.
How8 if we should accept that argument, would
it not be the appropriate relief simply to send it back
to tlie Oklahoma Court without any instructions about jury
sentencing, because presumably as far as the federal
Constitution is concerned the Court of Appeals can do its
own /sentencingj, as long as they gave you a fair opportunity
to say that what the sentence should be before they simply
affirm on the basis of an invalid trial court action «>
MR. EBEL:

Well, unless it is accepted fey this

Court that there is a right to be sentenced fey a Jury in
Oklahoma and the failure to observe that right is itself
a duo process violation.
QUESTION;

We11, we could send it back to the

Court of Appeals and they could decide whether there is

26
such a right in Oklahoma which they would o© much better
able to decide than we would»

Presumably, if they thought

there was they would follow their own law, I think we haw
to presume that.
MR. EBEL:

Well, we think, Your Honor, that the

Oklahoma law is already bioar on that, and this Court can
leelie that on the basis presented by the Court of
Criminal Appeals which was that Hicks wasn’t prejudiced.
And I think this Court could say that it was. he Was and
it needs to be sent back for a Jury to sentence,,
Your Honor, I see that my light light is thrown
on and I would like to reserve a few moments for rebuttal,
so I will rest.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANET L. C0X3 ESQ,,

MS. COX:
the- Cour t:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it- please
1

Opposing counsel and myself do not differ on
the basic premise that the sentencing stage of a trial
proceeding is protected by the due process clause of the
14th Amendment.

The difference between ray position and

the position of my opposing counsel is that there is a
determination that needs to he made as to what process is

2?
due.

The petitioner argues that the failure of the
Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals tc remand this cause
for Jury sentencing deprived him of a procedural right
under section 326 of the Oklahoma Constitution»
The petitioner has gone through the fact's ad©'.' y r-V

of due process, but merely that it did not comport with

28
Mow 9 the petitiones?* & ©nfcis?® argument is predi­
cated on the fact that the invalidation of 51(B) completely
voided his sentence, and this is not true.

So long as the

sentencing statute contains the severability clause„ which
in this

2ase

it did — and I must remind this Court that

wo are not talking about two statutes, we are talking
about on a that merely said divided two classes of indi­
viduals. that being habitual offenders.
QUESTIONS
stand yei.

Ms. Cose, may I Just be sure I under­

Are you saying that the Oklahoma Supreme Court

;A

or Court of Criminal Appeals, whichever it was, in Thigpen
did not sold 51(B) unconstitutional?
MS. COX:

I am saying that they held it to be

vague and illusory and because it —
QUESTION:

I understand.

Did they hold it to

be unconstitutional?
MS, COX:

Yesj, they did hold it unconstitutional

but not m the basis of the federal constitutional issue,
that it denied due process.
QUESTION:

So we must accept that as a matter

of state law that statute is unconstitutional, si that
true ?
MS. COX:

That is correct, and we are not try­

ing to litigate the constitutionality of 51(B) but only
as to what the court tried to do when it invalidated the

29
statute*
QUESTION:

Then you disagree with your opposing

counsel that Thigpen was based on federal constitutional
grounds?
MS a COX:

Yess Your Honors I do»

I believe it

was an interpretation of a state statute based upon state
law and procedure»
QUESTION:

For purposes of this ease,' it prob­

ably doeanft make any difference, does it?
MS. COX:

Mo, it really doesn’t except that he

has predicated the invalidation of section 51(B) on the
fact that if voided the petitioner's sentence and there­
fore the- Court of Criminal Appeals in effect resentenced
the petitioner.

And what I am trying to say —

QUESTION:

That would be true regardless! of the

basis for declaring 51(B) unconstitutional.
MS« COX:
QUESTION:

That * s true.
Hypothetically, If this case went

back, have you suggested that the new Jury could give a
life sentence In the exercise of its discretion?
MS. COX:

Yes, I have. Your Honor.

Unfortu­

nately, the state- of Oklahoma does not have any procedural
devise which would reempanel a new Jury,

I am also argu­

ing that the Court of Criminal Appeals exercised its
authority under section 1066 to either modify, affirm.

30

remand or otherwise reverse a ease,
QUESTION:

Now, Ms. Cox, you are emphasizing

that and you have argued that and it is very clear fro® the
statute that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals does
have that revisory authority,

May I ask you this:

D© you

know of any case where the Court of Criminal Appeals has
increased a jury-imposed sentence in the exercise of that
authority?
MS, COX;

No, Your Honor»

In fact* I believe

that they would b© prohibited from increasing a sentence.
QUESTION:

If they have acted at all* they have
j.

only decreased one?
MS, COX:

i

Yess that1s correct, either the same

••sentence or decrease It, which they have done under the
decisions following Thigpen where the defendants w@r:-a
sentenced under section 5KB),

. :.:J

In same cases they" have

\V

modiflee and in some cases they have affirmed them, j
QUESTION:

But when you modify, it Is only to

decrease?
MS. COX:

Decrease» yes.

QUESTION:

You know of no case and in fact you

doubt the power of the court to increase a, sentence im­
posed by a jury.
MS. COX:

I think It would be highly improper

and an exercise of --

31
In any «vent, you know of no ease

QUESTION:
where that was done?

Mo» Your Honor* there has been none..

MS* COX:
QUESTION;
here?

In fast, isn’t that what was done

If there was no jury sentence and they Imposed a

forty-year sentence, didn’t they increase It by forty
years?

And if bo, haven’t you acknowledged that the

action was Improper?
MS» COX;

tence was void.

If you buy the premise that the sen­

What I am trying to distinguish from

here is the right fco resenfcence by jury under 926 and
the asserted right of petitioner to be resentenced
following appellate review»
QUESTION;

Well, is it your view — let ate just

be sure I understand your theory.

Is It your view that

■what the Court of Appeals in effect did was affirm the
seatene;? imposed by the jury?
MS. COX;

QUESTION:

That Is correct*
Then where did the defendant get

his opp >rtunlfcy fco have somebody decide how long he
should >e in jail?
MS* COX:

Because at the trial court- level he

was glvan an opportunity during the second stage of the
proceedings fco be represented by counsel fco attack the
underlying convictions.

That was all that due process

32
requires in tills case0

Me are talking about two separate

levels.
QUESTION:

You said a moment ago that due process

applies to the sentencing procedure*
MS. COX:

It does in the sense that the trial

court; le/els and that is what we are talking about in this
case.
QUESTION;

Wells what due process was there if

he had a right to have the Jury decide between ten and

forty and the Judge said to the Jury* you must give him
forty?
MS. COX;

Because the sentencing statute* 51(B),

required a mandatory Imposition of *10 years.

This Court

has already held that that type of an instruction;» in
Ruru&el v. Estelle last week, is not improper,
QUESTION:

Except it was simply Invalid in this

ease,
MS. COX;

That is what petitioner argues, it

was simply invalid,
QUESTION:

Maybe not improper if there had' been

a valid statute authorising it* but there wasn’t,
MS, COX:
QUESTION:

I would. ~
Do you think if they went back and

did it all over again, the Judge could give the same in­
struction?

33
MS, COX;

Wells section 51(B) has been reenacteds

antS that pwti.cn which would provide for the maximum under
the underlying felony has been deleted from the statute,
I am not saying that he would be resenfcencad. under 51(B)2
but the same •—
QUESTION:

So your answer Is that the same in­

struction could not be given a
MS. COX:

Thatfs correct9 because the statute

has been ©tended,
MS, COX:

Then how can you defend the procedure

In-.the trial court that was followed!

I don11 understand

your argument,
MS» COX;

Because due process only affords the

right for him to be represented by counsel tc attack the
underlying convictions.

The petitioner in this case

relies upon the case of Klimas and in that case the
Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals was presented with a
problem similar to this case only they did not determine
that the underlying statute was invalid.

What they de­

termined. was that the defendant had been prejudiced because during the second stage certain convictions had
been improperly admitted upon which the jury was consider-’
:mg the punishment.

They felt that this afforded him

substantial prejudice and reversed it and sent It back
for- res ent enc ing,

Ws don't have that problem In this caa®.

The

same evidence would be admitted at the trial court level

on a second hearing in this ease as In. th® first one*,
ovBn though the mandatory punishment statute could not be
given as an Instruction,

How can anyone be sentenced under —-

The

court said that the defendant was not prejudiced by the
rules of this statute in that the sentence imposed is
within the range of punishment authorised by the provisions
of 51(A),
MS, COX:

What the court did when it Invalidated:

51(8) was take away that class ©f individuals and lumped
Xy]

them all to 51(A).

That Is where the court came with the

in Thigpen they were trying to protect those

MS, COX:

Isn't that shifting the rules-?
I don't know what type of rules you

are tailing about,

the Court of Criminal Appeals said ha could have,.
MS» COX:

Mo, they merely affirmed the punish-

merit as being within the limits of —
QUESTION:

They affirmed 51(B)?

They said

they couldn't affirm 51(B) so they affirmed 51(A),
MS* COX:

No, they merely said that the sentence

was in 'he range of punishment

that the legislature pro­

vided for the enhancement of habitual offenders.
QUESTION:

So if you have a death penalty for

37
first degree murder and five years for manslaughter, if
they sentence you to the death penalty to life imprison**
merit for manslaughter s that is all right* because they
could have sent you to death*
MS. COX:
QUESTION:
MS, COX:

Hot if that —
There is something wrong with that.
Mo* that creates — let's talk about

the death penalty eases in Furman where a number of states
had numerous individuals on death row.

This Court in­

validated, especially in Woodson., the death penalty.

The

Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals invalidated those
sentences and commuted them to life, and it is the same
analogy that we have in this case,
QUESTION:

Well* they didn’t commute this sen­

tence 9 they affirmed it,
MS, COX:

because they have the authority to affirm the sentence
of the jury if they find, that there is no

was subsequently found to be unconstitutional, and I

agree.
QUESTION:

From the way I read, it, it was un­

constitutional before Thigpen, according to what the
court said.

The court said and it was laid to rest in

Thigpen, which meant it had been dead before®
MS. COX:

Thigpen was decided after the peti­

tioner in this ease was sentenced.

I am talking at out what the Court

of Criminal Appeals said.

Didn’t it say that?

Your Honor, I would say that -is what

QUESTION:

Ms. Cox, I suppose in any ease

where toe legislature has validly provided for a mandatory
a enteric 3 upon conviction or habitual offenders or that
sore of thing, the right of allocutions the right of the
defendant to get up and speak before- the jury if there
is jury sentencing or befare the judge if there is
judicial sentencing, really is a fantasia
sentence has to he mandatory®

almost if the

40
MS, COX:

I would have to agree with that state­

ment, that what good would It do for the defendant to get
on the stand unless he were taking the underlying convic­
tio:! upon which the enhancement was laid, that for him
to be presenting the mitigating circumstances, it would
not affect the range of punishment because the Jury had
been instructed to return a mandatory sentence„
QUESTION:

If that is constitutional, to give

a lot of arguments why you shouldn't be given a mandatory
sentence that is required, it isn’t going t© do him any
good,
MS.. COX:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I missed your question,
For the defendant to give the Jury

or the judge a lot of reasons why a less than mandatory
sentence shouldn’t be imposed on him isn’t going to do
the defendant any good if the legislature has said con­
st isuti snally that this mandatory sentence shall be
imposed,
MS, COX:

That's correct.

Of course, the pe­

titions p argues that ha should be, if he was in fact
sentenced under 51(A), that the legislation should con­
tain minimum standards in order to determine within the
range of punishment that he is to have.

Of course, I

really feel that the analogy in this case does not apply
simply because if you have sentencing standards, as in

hi
this death penalty ease, you are really looking toward
the individual, and when you have discretionary sentence
the Jury is looking not only towards the offense hut the
individual offender, and the only thing that the stand­
ards ani guidelines would provide in a discretionary
sentence would facilitate appellate review.
QUESTIONi

;

Did you argue this case in the Court

of Criminal Appeals?
MS. COX;
QUESTION;

Ho5 I did not.

So you don’t know any more than Mr.

Ebel, I take it, except from briefs what were raised as
federal constitutional Issues?
MS- COX;

That’s correct, I did. not argue it

at the ferial court level,
QUESTION:

Do I understand correctly that you

have agreed with your friend that the Court of Appeals
of Oklahoma could have remanded that case for resentenc­
ing by a new jury?
MS. COX:

No,

The only thing that the Court

of Criminal Appeals could do Is reverse the entire case
and start completely over.
QUESTION:

They could have remanded it.

If the Court of Appeals could not

do it- then can this Court, could this Court remand it
for resentencing?
MS. COX;

I know of no procedure whereby the

Hz
State of Oklahoma could raempanel the jury „

X*s sure

this Court eould, but how eould the State of Oklahoma
facilitate that request.

It would require legislation

or a violation of this Court * s order.

Basically, all the state is saying Is that
fc sic due process requires a hearing on the trial court
level, which was given in this case.

On the appellant

level. where the court — where the state of Oklahoma
has granted & lot of review, the only thing that is re­
quired in that instance under due process is the right ~~
in this case the petitioner was entitled to an attorney
at public expense» the right to a public transcripto

He

was entitled to brief his cause and to present errors
and his only expectation in the Court of Criminal Appeals
was that the court would render a fair and impartial re­
view of his sentence and look for fundamental errors.
That is all due process requires,
QUESTION:

If we remanded and the Court of

Criminal Appeals decided as a matter of state law that
contrary to your view of the matter a new jury could be

of Appeals be reviewable here?
MS. COX:

MS, COX:

I would think so, yes.
What would fee the federal question?
Well, there wouldn't fee unless the

defendant raised one if he was — if in fact he went
back and was resentenced and got a greater punishment,
life, surely ha would contest that it was a denial of
due process possibly to send him back for resentencing.

I know of non® off the top of say head.
Assuming that the Court rejected

your brother’s attacks on 51(A), he presents federal
questions in asserting that 51(A) itself is constitution­
ally Invalid,
MS. COX:

Yes3 and that that legislation

should contain minimum sentencing standards.

I believe
i

that Is a due process question..
In conclusion., the respondents, as I said
before, submit that the petitioner In this case has been
afforded the full panoply of the duo process requirements
and-procedures which the laws of the State of Oklahoma
*

create.

The Constitution of this country does not pro­

vide for a defendant to be resentenced anew.

It is not

a part of the due process clause ani is net protected

by the due process clause.
There can be no possible conceivable relation-*
ship between oh® notice requirements at the trial court
level and applying them to the appellate level other
then what has been create by state statute.
The state would submit that there has been

*J5
notice In all due process.

The petitioner also raises

questions of equal protection, but this Court In Hummel
last week indicated that the state has a right to create
classes of individuals under? the H&bitural Criminal Act.
1 don’t feel that there is any suspect classification or
any reason — there is no procedure for anyone sentenced
Under 51(A) or 51(B) which would violate the procedures
of"' the State of Oklahoma,
For that reason, the State of Oklahoma asks
this Court to affirm the judgment and sentence of the
Court of Criminal Appeals,

Well, if we agree with you, counsel,

presumably what we would do is be to vacate the judgment

of the Court of Criminal Appeals and remand the case to
that court and let it decide what it wants to do about it.
MR. EBEL:

Yes ? sis?*

The second point is our

discussion about the power of the Court of Criminal Appeals
to modify sentences.

That has always been Interpreted

under the Oklahoma law as the power to modify the length
of* the sentence when it is excessive.

Obviously,, they

didn’t feel this sentence here was excessive»

To my

knowledge, that statute' has never authorised the Court
of .Criminal Appeals to modify the basis for which the
sentence was issued., to modify the statute under which
he was tried, to change the statutory basis entirely.
Finally, in response to Justice Relinquish5 s
question., if Mr* Justice Rehnqulst will review again the
petition for rehearing, the petitioner here, specifically
in the petition for rehearing, Tom'5 Honor, did complain
about being sentenced under federal constitutional
grounds ">y the Court of Criminal Appeals and did ask to
have that xafcter remanded for sentencing In accordance
with state law..
QUESTION:

What did the Court of Criminal

Appeals io?
MR. EBEL:

They denied the petition for rehearing.

QUESTION:

Sc there is no ray of knowing whether

they considered it or not?

MR. KBEL:

No, but it eoulda’t have beers raised

until the petitioner for rehearing because that is the
frustration that- Hicks faces her®, until the Court of
Criminal Appeals decided that h® was to fee sentenced
under this new statute,, the error hadn’t occurred.

This

is unlike the case where the error occurs at the trial
lev®, and then you can raise it at the Court of Appeals.
This error didn’t even occur until the Court of Appeals
handed Iowa its final decision.

cause

ks

He couldn't raise ~

QUESTION:

You say that was the first opportunity.

MR. EBEL:

That was the first opportunity, be­

are not claiming error at the trial, we are

claiming it at the appellate level.

So there was no

chance to raise it except here.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

•;
Thank you, consol.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:27 o’clock a.hi., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
