MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

sesct in Colby and Walters against Driver,
Mr. Neinser, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARL H. NEM8ER, ESQ. *
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. NEMSERs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Chief Justice Burger pointed out in this morning's
arguments that the facts of these eases, the Colby ease and the
tandem case—-the Stafford case this morning—are not the most
important elements of the ease, because we're dealing with a
relatively narrow personal jurisdiction issue.
But I thought I would just briefly give you the
jurisdictional facts in the Colby case.
Til© jurisdictional facts are that Colby has no
presence in Rhode Island, and that Walters has no presence in,
Rhoda Island.,

Colby was Director of Central Intelligence.

Hi® office was in Virginia.

He resides in Maryland.

Walter® was Deputy Director of Central Intelligence.
office was in Virginia.

Ha resided in Virginia.

General
His

He now

resides, in Florida.
Judge Pettine found, in the District Court in
Rhode Island, that Colby and Walters did not have sufficient
presence in that district to satisfy the Rhode Island long am

4
statute, which is ana of the broad ones that esc tends personal
-jurisdiction as far as Fourteenth Amendment due process will
permit.
The facts, of course, in Colby involve a mail-opening
program, and I think they’ve adequately been covered».
The-—there is on® tiling this morning that was
discussed that I'd like to touch on before I talk about the
two points I plan to talk about»

And that was, Mr. Justice

Stewart, you had a discussion with Mr. Brown, and the
question was, what about habeas corpus, and what about
SchXanger, and wouldn’t you have to—or would you not have t©
reverse Sehlanger if you didn't find for us in this case.
i

!

I think you'd have to reverse Ochlanger.

The

argument for not reversing Schlanger would be that, in habeas
corpus there is a special jurisdictional section, and the
First Circuit held-that habeas corpus falls into the other>

wise-provideci-by-law section in 1391(e).
Well, it does- not.
times.

I just read it again.

I read 2243. at least a dozen
And I read Strait v. Laird;

2241 does not provide for jurisdiction; if does not provide
■for the venus»

All it says is that the courts can issue -the

writs within their respective jurisdictions.
QUESTIONi

Well,

"otherwise provided by law"

doesn't necessarily mean, otherwise provided by statutory
law, does it?

5
MR*, KEMSER:

I would presume that that’s what

Congress would have meant»
QUESTIONS

Now—

And how about the last sentence in footnote

four in the Schlanger opinion?

1 read it this morning? I don't

have it in front of me»
MR„ NEMSERs

That last sentence is, that habeas

corpus is like, in all respects, every civil action»
QUESTIONS

Every civil action generally.

So it5s

the rules ©f law governing habeas corpus.
Mli0 NEMSERs

Wait a minute.

The law governing

personal jurisdiction in habeas corpus is set forth in Straight
-

v«. Laird,

where the Court said, and Mr. Douglass™-Justice

Douglass wrote, that jurisdiction over the custodian is like
any other rule of jurisdiction.

You've got to be present,

and he cites International Shoe.
\

QUESTIONs

Yes, well he also wrote Schlanger, as

jwe knew.
MR„ NEMSERs

He also wrote Schlanger, and in

Schlanger what he said was—the interesting thing about it
was—he-vSchianger he said the commanding officer, and I'll
quote, but he was neither a resident of the Arizona judicial
district, nor amenable to its process.
Now if 1391(e) makes federal officials amenable
to process all throughout -the country, you have to reverse
Schlanger.

6
QUESTION:
so that

As you know* I dissented in Sch.la.nger,

wouldn't bother me.

•:

MR. NEMSERs

I know, but I don't know why you

dissented, because you didn’t file an ©pinion.

You didn't

dissent in Straight.
The two points I want to make- is %

what standard

do you.have to apply in evaluating this statute?

And I say

that because of two sources, one, Justice Brandeis' opinion
in Robertson, and second, Mr. Chief Justice Burger's opinion

!

in NLRB v„ Catholic Bishop of Chicago, the standard is, this

statute cannot he interpreted to supply personal jurisdiction
i

I

over federal officials throughout the United States unless
there is clear expression of legislative intent.
That coaies from Robertson.

The standard from

Catholic Bishop is, because there's a substantial constitutional
question presented, you can't read the statute to provide
jurisdiction unless there’s an affirmative intent of Congress
c.'Learly expressed.
QUESTION?
question?

Well, what's the substantial constitutional

I mean, this is one country.
MS. NEMSER:

This is one country, but personal

jurisdiction is no longer, and it has never been held by
this Court, to be based solely on territorial power.
QUESTION:

The Securities Act provides for nation­

wide service of process.

7
MR, NEMSER:
limited.

Of course it does, but it's carefully

It says, you only have venus where the causes of

action arose., where the defendants reside, or where an act

|
took place by a defendant.

So it certainly satisfies Fifth

Amendment due process, because there's sms affiliating
circumstances with the district.
And t© go to the district when you commit securities
fraud for a defendant action doesn’t seem to me to place an
intolerable burden on the right to defense.

To cause Colby

to g© to San Francisco, Rhode Island, Hew York, to defend the
«sime action, to bring his witnesses, to go there for deposi­
tions , I say, imposes an intolerable burden on his right to
defend, his right to be hoard.
-

ibad in Boddie v. Connecticut, where to get a

I
divorce you had to file a $12 filing fee, this Court held,
at a minimum due process—and this isn't Fifth ©r Fourteenth
lfeisendmant--afc a minimum due process requires a meaningful

f

f.

opportunity to be heard.

And if you don't hav© the $14

•for a filing fee, you don't have that opportunity.
Our client cannot afford to run around the
country defending actions because, while they were federal
officials, someone has a gripe,
QUESTION?

But if Nelson Rockefeller, when he was

alive, had been named as a defendant, presumably he could be
sued under your interpretation of the statute,

He couldn't

certainly raise the an© means" claim.

MR» NEMSER:
face.

No, X*m looking at the statute on its

And I say on its face, to require someone. Nelson

Rockefeller or .anyone else, to expend such a substantial
amount of his assets to travel around the country defending
lawsuits, where they didn’t ask for it, they didn't step
into a. district, would place an intolerable burden on that
right to defend.
And ‘the Court has never done otherwise.

Every time

the Court's been faced with the issue of whether there's
bean any Fifth Amendment limitation on Congress' power to
provide nationwide jurisdiction, they point it out.
In the case before rheas, well, here there’s no
intolerable burden.

In our casse, -there is one.

And I point

out in my supplementary brief that in LeRoi ease, just recently
!

decided, in the dissenting opinion—I believe it was written
by Mr. Justice White—he said, of course there’s nationwide
jurisdiction which is constitutional in the < federal courts
because there's no Fifth Amendment limitation.
•he cite?

But what does

No decision from this Court, because there is none.

He cites a Seventh Circuit case, the Simmons case, which we
discuss, but he doesn't point out there's even a split in the
Seventh Circuit.

In Meta Apparatewerke, cited in my brief,

the Seventh Circuit said, yes, there is a fairness limitation
on. the exercise of power to—Congressional power to provide

9

nationwide jurisdiction.

.Sad it’s fundamental fairness,

fair play, similar to the International Shoe standard.
The thing that I believe it would be unconstitutional
if you applied it in our case.

But I believe there is no

question that- there8s a substantial question raised.

Henry

Hiirta Hart and Wechslerdiscuss it, and says It's a substantial
question.

The Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment

have the same language, due process.
QUESTION:

What about this venue situation before

■3.962, when someone who felt he'd been wronged by government
actions and wanted to sue a government official, clearly had
to come back to the District of Columbia, or Maryland or
Virginia, where that citizen resided, and sue them.

Couldn't

sue them anywhere else in the United States?
MR. NEMSER:

That5s right, because only Maryland or

DoCo could issue mandamus.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn't that suggest the same

i

•fairness problem?

Hare's someone maybe wronged 3,000 miles

■«.way?
MR. NEMSER:

Unfair to the plaintiff, you mean?

Well, due process protects defendants.

You shouldn't have

your property taken away without due process of law.
QUESTION:

Wall, it may—"'the complaint of this

person maywe11 have been that the government agent living
in Maryland or Virginia or the District of Columbia took

I

10

State of Washington,
MB.a NEMSERs

And it would be fundamentally unfair

to make him travel to Washington to prosecute his case ass a
plaintiff?
f

QUESTION:

It seems to me, that would be as

reasonable in argument as th© one you're making now,
>

MR. NEMSER?

I think it™-I would be sympathetic to

his plight, and Congress was.

But the question of what due

process prevents, in a litigation—in a litigation protection,
a litigation setting, it protects defendants.
>

And it3 s been pointed out by this Court—
QUESTION?

Well, due process is applicable only

when we're talking about the jurisdiction of a court.

This—

we're dealing her® with a venue statute.
i

MR. NEMSER?

Well, the question in this case also

is? whether this statute provides personal jurisdiction.

We

have a section in our main brief which is devoted to that,
artel we say, it supplies only venue, not personal jurisdiction.
>

The question of whether it provides—if it didn't

provide personal jurisdiction, we would be out of the cess
because there'd be no basis to have personal jurisdiction over
us'.

Our argument was discussed in the First Circuit's

opinion and rejected.
I believe if is a valid argument.

I believe it is

11
validi because Congress oftentimes provides for service of
process»

The Federal Rales tell you ho1» to serve process»
But they don’t tell you when someone is amenable

to service or subject to jurisdiction»

That whole area is

biased on another area ©f the law; presence, a specific

And the Robertson case is instructive

The court should not interpret a statute to provide

'in personam jurisdiction, because we have general rules about
it, unless-”

MR® NEMSER:

Service of process is nationwide.

MFU NEMSER;

The service of process isn’t the same

For example, in New York, the

long arm statute-QUESTION;

Jurisdiction is not the Same as venue?

tlnat was the point of my question,
MB.» NEMSER:
talking about;

Right,

There are three things we’re

service, venue and personal jurisdiction.

12
The general rale of personal jurisdiction set
forth in the Robertson case is that you get sued# defendants
got sued where they live# where they’re present, where they're
found.

Robertson said -there have been very few departures

from this general rule# and they've all been carefully
guarded and clearly expressed,

ted it shouldn’t be lightly

assumed that Congress intends to depart from long-estellished
policy.
So what d© we have to get Congressional intent.

Ms.

Peterson this morning said we had a lot of discussion about
damage actions? we did not.

As Justice Stevens pointed out,

there’s © passing reference in the hearings Where four
Congressmen were present—just four-—where m^cGuineas- -and if
you read the hearings# you could tell this subcommittee did
j

i

not like MacGuineas. He was bothering them.

He told them# you're

/giving us problems that—the committee said to • Mac'Guiheas.
yon * re giving us problems that we don’t want to deal with.
You’re telling us that we’re going to go to officials’
pccketbooks.

We’re not dealing with that# and we don't want

to do that.
By the way# you're too busy to study -tills, you
tell us, -they say in the hearings, you're too busy trying
cases.

Bring someone else down from Justice to talk to us.

They were tired of hearing from him.

So what did they do?

They put in their committee report the thing that was before

13
all the congressmen, what was interned by the statute.
What does it say?

It's got oas theme:

These

a:re government suit®,, suits against the government.

It says#

it covers suits against government officials that can now be
brought only in D.C.

Wot my case? not the personal damage

cases.
Suits to compel a federal officer to perform a
duty.

Three times it says# suits in essence against the United

States.
l

Twice it says, we're talking about suits nominally

'

«gainst officials.
It goes on to ©ay, we're talking about suits
against, officials as individuals, but when we sue then under
the fiction that they're acting as individuals.
And it says, there's no problem in this ease—it
tells Congre,as, the committee report--there9s no problem,
because the government always defends^them.
’

Now, it's incredible to me that it can be suggested

that Congress was alerted, in the face of all this—
QUESTION:

Right on that very point, government

always defends, what, would you say today of the application
of a statute to a libel action such as Barr v. Matteo, or one
of those?
MR. NEMSER:

1391Ce) doesn't apply because they're

trying to get money out of his pocket-book.
QUESTION:

I take it the government would

14
pirob&bly defend the lawsuits.
MR» NEMSERs

The government would defend only if it

found, h, it was in the interests of the United States to
do fend them? B, the defendant acted within -the scope of
his authority; and C, the defendant didn't commit any crime,
oir theres s no criminal investigation.
‘

Now, in a related ease, the Blackburn case which

Kir* Brown mentioned this morning, had Gray as a defendant,
hut he was criminally investigated so he paid his own attorney

fees.

«

>

*
If the government decides it's no longer in their

interest to defend my client, my client will have to pay.
I

QUESTION?

But the letter from attorney General

KutzenSbach to the district attorneys sort, of assumes that they
will be defending 'these slander-libel type suits against officers;,
doesn’t it?
MR* NEMSERs

The Katsenbach memorandum, Katzenbach

i;« not & congressman, he was not a congressman—
QUESTION:
one point.

I know al.1 that? I'm just going to the

That letter, ha assumed that those would be in the

category ofthat the ngovemment would normally defend.
MR. NEMSERs

That memorandum assumed it, and he did

not talk about the three exceptions which are in 28 G*F*R« 50.15.
It's not regulations; it's- just Justice Department policy,
which can change tomorrow or -the next day.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP MRS. ELIHOR H. STILLMAN, ESQ,,
OH BEHALF OP THE
MRS, STILLMANz

It is beyond dispute that the

venue expansion bill that Representative Hamer Budge first
introduced in the 86th Congress would not, had it been enacted,
cover suits like the one here today.
It applied only to suits against federal officers
In their official capacity.

Bud at the opening of the

hearings on that bill, in the 86th Congress, Representative
Budge

described the kinds of suits and the kind of venue

problem he was concerned with In terms that clearly exclude
the kinds of suits that we have here today.
Respondents contend, and the court below found, that
by adding the phrase “under color of legal authority," the
.coaenittee considering Representative Budge's bill thereby
extended the venue provisions to include these types of tort
damage suits.
We believe that an examination of the circumstances
tinder which this phrase got added to the legislation, and
then emerged in the revised bill, HJR. 12622, that’s the
subject of the report Issued in the 86th Congress, reveals
that they are wrong.

And we submit that the conclusion derived

■from this examination of circumstances is confirmed by -the

16
explanation of the phrase in which is supplied in both houses,
both House reports, the one issued in the 86th Congress and the
on© issued in the 87th Congress, and by remarks of Representative
Poff, who is a member ©£ the subcommittee that considered
that bill in the 86 Congress, and who made remarks in the 87th
Congress, when the bill was initially passed by the House,
containing this phrase, "under color of legal authority.”
And 1 am going to devote most of ray time here to
discussing how this phrase got into the bill, and how it's
explained in the House reports, and what Congressman Poff
said this bill was all about when he explained it to his
fellow Congressmen.
As I say, it’s important to focus on the original
bill in the 89th Congress, because that’s where the phrase
c;fsae in, and that9s where some of these troublesome sentences
first appeared in that report.
Regarding that original bill, it5s true, as Ms.
Peterson has said here this morning, that Deputy Attorney
General Walsh had written a letter to Congress about that
original bill that mentioned only official, capacity, and
■he pointed out that it appeared to cover cnly mandamus
actions..

The bill would therefore need nothing, because no

Court outside the District of Columbia Circuit had mandamus
jurisdiction.
He also did mention that there were two categories

,/

17
0:1? cases involving suits against defendants in their individual
capacity as federal officers, in their individual capacity which
would not be covered by -the bill as drafted*

One category

of suits ware these suits against the individual where you
were*-you had the legal fiction that the man was acting
outside his authority in order to evade the sovereign immunity
doctrine.
The other category of suits was--were suits to
aeek damage from him personally for actions taken ostensibly
in the course of his official duties, but which the plaintiff
claims are in excess of his official authority.
In the hearings on Representative Budge’s bill, MacGuineas reiterated these points.

And he again pointed out

that one category of these suits involved legal fiction.
•In view of Representative Budge's opening statement of what
•he intended the bill to cover, it's quite obvious that the
first category of suits, the legal fiction category, had to be
covered in order for Representative Budge's bill to do what he
wanted if. to do, and that was to give review of administrative
actions out in the field, against field officers, without
having your action foreclosed because the indispensable
superior, party superior, was in Washington.
Therefore, if they didn't put something in the
bill, the who® purpose of the bill was going to be undermined.
The phrase, "under color of legal authority," was

18
suggested by committee counsel Melvin Drabkin, and it s true
that he at times in the hearings seemed to distinguish suits—
personal suits for personal actions, personal, outside the
scope of employment actions, against federal defendants.
But he also said at page 57 of the hearings to MacGuineas,

. want the government to be able to retreat

behind any artificial concept.
•*

So what he seemed to fear was that something was

going on here.

If they didn't change it in some way, the

government was somehow going to escape review.
And it is true that MacGuineas pointed out that if
you added this phrase "under the color of legal authority,B
-there is a danger, -the possibility that some court might
construe it --o cover tort damage suits against federal
officials.

And he said quite forcefully that this would be

grossly unfair to federal officials, because certainly private
individuals are not. subject to suits in multiple form for
torts committed in the course of their employment, and it was
unfair to treat federal officials differently, in damage suits.
And slander actions were discussed as a sort of
paradigm case of these types of suits that might possibly
be covered.

However, as soon as he had finished discussing

this possibility, the committee chairman and another committee
member immediately agreed that it would be unfair.

This

was Representative Forrester and Representative Poff, and

19
that's at page 53 of the transcript of hearings.
But the Congressmen reasons to discount MacGuineas *
fears that the courts would construe the language to reach
the result that they agreed was unfair.

First, Judge Albert

Kl&ris, who, representing the Judicial Conference, testified
really as something of an expert witness; they seemed to treat
him as someone who knew how courts might interpret tilings, and
he knew what language should be used to achieve their purposes,
he was asked, would it fce advisable to add this phrase, "under
color of legal authority."
!

<■

And he said, 051 would be very happy to see that,

because it would be a way of putting to rest this fictional
doctrine and get right down to what is really the fact,
reviewing administrative action."

That's at page 91 of the

transcript of hearings.
Second, they had reason to discount this possibility that
MacGuineas was ■

holding out to them because the sponsors of

the bill, Henry Budge,

disavowed on the record any intent

;i

bi: covering what he called "these slander-type actions."

He

said, this is not what I have in mind.
And as Justice Stevens has pointed out, that was
mainly what they focused on when they were giving examples of
what damage actions might possibly be involved.
Third, the House report, issued shortly after
these hearings concluded, explained the reason for referring

20

both the suits ©gainst officers acting in their official
capacity, and to suits against officers acting under color
of legal authority.

And that explanation, which is printed

a!: page 3? of our brief, in language that has been quoted
tills morning by Mr. Heraser, is written in terms that clearly
do not refer to these types of suits? they refer clearly to
suits in essence against the government, in essence against
the United States, suits that involve this legal fiction.
How, we submit that these factors, these
circumstances, would have made the Congressmen feel that per­
haps HacGuinaaswas being unnecessarily finicky, unnecessarily

fearful.

Clearly, they thought he was there trying to throw

out problems to dissuade them from legislating anything; at
least they seemed to express that feeling at times.
And both the Senate and the House report, on H«R. I960
in the 87th Congress, start out describing the purpose of the
bill, the bill as a whole, not just the mandamus section but
•the bill as a whole, as being something that they5re passing
•to facilitate review of administrative actions.
And we submit that damage suits are not what you*re
talking about when you talk about review of administrative
actions.
Congressman Poff macte remarks in connections
with this bill when it was voted on by the House in the 87th
Congress.

Now this was when it was first voted on by the House.

21
There were subsequently some amendments which don't directly
affect us here/ and it was then revoted on by the House»
But he was explaining to the Congress that was
going to pass on this bill what it meant»

And at this time

it did contain the phrase * "under color of legal authority,"
Representative Poffs remarks, which are printed
at Volume 107 ©f the Congressional Record, page 12157, are
cast in tersos that refer only to suits that are in essence
against the government itself.
He speaks ©f the balance of convenience between
plaintiff and defendant in such suits, and insists that
broadening the plaintiffs9 options present no problem, because
as fee observes, there are federal courts, federal attorneys,
federal agencies in every quarter of the nation, and that in
fact the convenience of the government would be promoted by
trying the case in the local district court where the paper is
available, the property is accessible, and the witnesses are
within reach.
Representative Poff ended his remarks with the
following

.statement:

"Our Nation was founded upon a profound

respect for the rights of the individual citizen.

The government

should be willing always to accommodate itself to the
preservation ©£ these rights.

More particularly, when the

government is -the party in controversy with the private citizen.*
QUESTION:

And foy the government you mean—fcfeafc is

22
meaning the particular- governmental official—
MRS o STILLMAN:
QUESTION;

Yes.

—who has done something that it was

thought he should not have done, or she have done.
MRSo STILLMAN;
ing is government action.

Yes, right.

And what you’re review-

We8re not seeking to have some kind

of damage compensation for some injury that was done in. the
pant.

You’re reviewing the action, and generally, you’re

asking for injunctive relief;

Make him stop doing it? don’t

let hi® do it again; and. getting soma ruling on whether it’s
a legal action or not.
The damage suits hare today are not controversies
between, the government and respondents in these cases.

They

ar<ii suits for damages to be paid out of assets of the individual
petitioners.
In this case, Mr. Colby and Mr. Walters, who as it
wa;:! pointed out, are now private citizens, it is true that
ifchmy have been supplied with govenmeat-p.aid private counsel,
but as noted, that is not assured in all cases.

There are

ifthese factors that have to be satisfied, that there’s a
determination that they ware acting within the scope of their
.employment, that there’s a determination that it's in the
interests of the United States to provide representation to
•theca „
S

And as far as the private counsel program, private

23

counsel are paid for when there's some possibility of conflict
in representing all of the defendants ,• or some other problem
with arguments that might wish to be raised, or any other
factors.
This is not assured at all, because this is subject
to annual budgetary appropriations which may or may not come
about from year to year.

So there simply cannot be any

assurance that government representation is always there.
In fact, I think at one point in the transcript,
there, was some reference to suits against congressmen, and
orts of the representatives said to MacGuineas, don't you always
dofend these? And he said, sometimes we do and sometimes we
don51.
So it wasn’t assured.
It is easy to see in retrospect that greater care
might have been taken by Congress to assure that Courts would
not construe 1391(e) more broadly than Congress evidently
intended.

But we submit that the language that Congress did

employ, "under color of legal authority," is not in itself so
clearly indicative of an attempt to change this historic,
defendant-oriented venue rules, that you simply ignore all
©i: these other considerations that I’ve discussed here.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Stillman, has ever*—has anyone to

your knowledge ever considered the possibility that the
language might he descriptive of the character of the

24
defendant while he's defending the lawsuit?
MRS o STILLMAN:

You mean at the time?

In other

words, referring to his capacity—
QUESTION:

In which each defendant is an officer.

Now -that's no longer true of these people.

Or an employee

acting either in his official capacity or still acting under
color of legal authority in trying to defend the government's
actions.
MRS. STILLMAN;

That's certainly. Your Honor, I

think it's suggestive of an intent to—
QUESTION:

If you read it athat way, of course.

MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Right.

Did anybody ever suggest it should be

read that way, to your knowledge?
MRS. STILLMAN;

Well, I 'think that the petitioners

saay have suggested that to the First Circuit.

But as 1 under-

stiiuad Your Honor, that if it’s read that way it's clearly
suggestive of having some kind of active supervision, over
their--over what they’re doing, and it’s suggestive of
ini tractive relief, certainly.

And I think that's a

plausible reading of the statute.
QUESTION:

Nobody really argues it here.

I was

ju*it trying to—maybe it’s so far out that it doesn’t make
any sense.

Eat I just wasn't sure.
MRS. STILLMANs

1 would never want to resist an

25
argument -that would tend to support the position that we’re
supporting.
QUESTION;

Also, that's dealt with in note 8 of

the ©pinion of the Court of Appeals on page 5 of the Appendix
to the Petition.
MRS. STILLMAN;

All right, and I'm advised that it's

in petitioner’s brief at page 5.
In summary, I would just simply like to note that we
think -chat the circumstances that I ®va noted here really
compelling suggest what the congressional purpose was in this
statute; and that any memorandum that Attorney General Kstsenbach may have written three months later, and certainly the
letter of Deputy Attorney General White, which can be read
as merely to say, there xaighfc be a problem, the courts might
construe this) this way, you might consider making it more
clearly; are not enough to compel the really radical change in
venue ru3.es which the construction givento the statute by the
respondents and by the court below would effect.
Thank you very much.
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE;

Mr. Wulf?

DEAL ARGUMENT OF MELVIN L* WULF, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS.
MR. WULF;

Mr. Chief Justice, end may it pleas© the

Court;
I am not even going t© try to improve upon the very

26
specific description of the legislative history that Ms.
Peterson presented to the Court this morning.
improve upon it if I did try.

I couldn't

I did think it was very

precise and persuasive, and presented our perspective in
distinction to the opposing side's perspective vary well.
What I would like to do is put. some—put this
case in a concrete context, and discuss some of the pragmatic
and policy considarations which I think may properly inform
the Court's ultimate decision in the case.
tod for that purpose, with your leave, Mr. Chief
Justice, I would like to allude briefly to the facts of the
Colby case, because 1 think they dramatize! what is at stake
here.
This case arose out of the 20-year program of the
Clh to open first class mail going to and from the United
States and the Soviet Union.

It was conducted without consent

of any of the correspondents.

It was conducted without a

warrant ever being issued or applied for.

It was, I think

it cannot be plainer, illegal find in violation of the Fourth
Amendment to the UKited States.
In the course of the program, the CIA opened about
215,900 letters affecting 110,000 individuals, American citizens.
In response to 'that, when the program became known in 1975,
this suit was filed in order to vindicate the rights of the
persons whose mail was opened and whose constitutional rights

27
ha, ve been so sorely abused by their goverraaentj. aad by the
officials who represented the government.
QUESTION:

Well, if was said bafore, maybe the

merits really aren't too relevant.

But what is -the case that

holds that there's a plain violation of Fourth Amendment
rights here?
Mict. WULF:

There are two cases. - From ex parte

Jackson in 1-380, I believe, to United States v. Van hewin
which was about ten years ago, both in this case—-both in
this Court, Your Honor, where it was held that a warrant was
required in order to justify opening of first class mail
matter.
QUESTION:

Was it foreign—first class foreign mail?

MR. WOLF:

They ware both domestic cases, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Because we had case involving foreign

mail recently that doesn't really support you very much.

I

dissented from the case, but—I guess it isn't relevant, but
sometimes—
MR. WOLF:

But -there may have been probable—I

re collect the case to which you refer, and that was an obsceni­
ty case, was it not?
QUESTION;

No, we had about mail covers—

QUESTION:

Two or three years ago from the Court

ofAppeals, District of Columbia circuit.
MR. WULF:

Sorry; I don't recollect.

@*

28
QUESTION:

That was opening mail at the border.

MR* WOLF:

Yes.

Well, in any case, I think -that

there would b© a very, very strong, indeed, irresistible
argument that this program, which in fact included outgoing
mail, not only income mail, which I think would change it
substantially, was a plain violation of the Fourth Amendment.
The question—
1

QUESTION:

Well, are you

suggesting, Mr. Waif, that

there 'would be no violation in opening at the border?
MRo WULF:

No, I think it was a violation both ways,

Your Honor? income and outgoing.
The question then becomes whether the citizens
whose, rights were injured in this case car. have a convenient
mods of redress for the serious violation'—-for the serious
intrusion upon their conetituti.OB.al rights.
And the Senate? report concerning this statute
before us today in fast says that its purpose, in addition to
:

.

.

everything ©Is® it says,.which is in dispute before the Court,
this is not in dispute~-~.it says that the purpose of 1391(e)
•iis; to provide readily available, inexpensive judicial remedies
to the citizen who is aggrieved by the workings of government*
S

;

?•
In this particular case, the plaintiffs had two
v
.
.
options, apart fro®, the one which we are arguing in support of
today.

If he cannot bring the action in the district where

ho lives, where Mr. Driver lives, he would either have to go to

29

the several districts where the individual defendants reside,
02' he would have to g© to th© jurisdiction where the cause of
action arose«
As an individual citizen it would be equally burdenseme for hiss to have to travel to New York, where it would
appear that the cause of action arose, and even more burdenseme to have to travel around the country to find—to file
individual suits against th© several defendants in this case.
The convenient thing, that condition which would
satisfy th© stated objective of the Senate in this—in adopting
this statute.., allows them to file suit conveniently and inexpeni

-

' |

©ively in the jurisdiction where he resides.

I

.

So that he may

easily vindicate the violation of his constitutional and
statutory rights.
And that convenience, of course, is one that was
explicitly is* the minds of Congress when they passed this statute.
And that is—those are the interests represented on the
plaintiffs8 side- in this case.
Congress has declared that where government officials

I
violate citizens' rights, that th© plaintiffs should fce easily

i
vab'Le to get judicial vindication,
QUESTION:

Now, that’s a shorthand summary, X take

■it, of the first line o£ venue section we’re talking about.
Do you think if, in the Stafford case, that if Judge Stafford
had not been sued until he had become a judge, but the suit

30
was based on his activities as a United States attorney, he
would have been subject to venue under that section?
ME„ WULF:

I think so, Your Honor.

Because it was

our position in the First Circuit that this statute applied
so long as the defendant was a serving government official
at the time service was made upon him, and that a change in
status thereafter was—did not affect the effective jurisdiction
tliat was secured in the first place.
QUESTION:

Even though it might be a quite different

position that; he occupied at the time of service, then, relief
was sought for his action—remedy on -the merits?
MB. VJULP:

Our position in the First Circuit was

that the different position made no difference at all, that
it. was the question—the only—the determinative question was
whether the defendant was a serving government officer at the
time process was effectively served upon him.
WellJ in the district court, I thought
I
that you successfully made th© claim that the test was whether
QUESTION:

02' not he was an officer at the time that th© cause of action

arose.
MX'.. WOLF:

You're quite right? I'm afraid I put

■that part of th© case somewhat out of my mind.
•

QUESTION:

That part was rejected by the Court of

MRo WOLF:

Yes.

•Appeals.

31
QUESTION;

And we did not grant certiorari on that

question; is that correct?

MRo WULF;

Yes, thank you for clarifying that.

It

was in fact our position -that it applies to present and former
officials.
It’s now our position that it requires it under
any circumstances; as long as process was served when the
defendant was a serving government official.
To be balanced against the considerations in the
plaintiffs’ favor in these cases, in order to provide a simple,
convenient, and inexpensive means of redress for injured
citizens, are the interests of the defendants in this case.
And whether you consider this part of my argument
as being in response to Mr. Nenserss constitutional argument,
os: merely 'as a--as helping to inform the Court’s decision in
the statutory interpretation process, it really comes down to
the same thing.

Because the balance of interests asserted

by the defendants in this case are not real.
Aid they would affect both the—they would affect
the due process argument if the Court thinks seriously that,
there is a due process argument.
But in any case, those interests, as I say, are
not real, and are pallid in contrast to the real, palpable
interests that are advanced on plaintiffs5 behalf in a situation
such as this, where a violation, of constitutional rights is

32
concerned.
In th« first place, and I think critically, the
petitioners and the government would have you think -these are
just any old defendants.
These are not any old defendants.

MR. WOLF:

The bill of rights. Tour Honor? sorry.

Tli© provision'—the provisions of the' bill of rights
which are before the. Court today, the Fourth Amendment and the
Fifth and Sixth Amendments.
i

And in that sense these defendants

’

t

_

;

’

are in fact different.
Because they assume the responsibility tha& privat®

33
citizens do not have, and having assumed that responsibility
they should be, and can be, in a constitutional and nonconstitutional sense, be dealt with differently, because they
are different.
That seems to n® to be a fundamental conception
which the petitioners would have you overlook.
In addition to that, in this, in both of these
cases, for the foreseeable future, until the Code of Federal
Regulations is amended, there is the additional fact that there
is no burden today on these defendants, because of the fact
that the government is paying what is the principal, apart
from a judgment, in defense of a lawsuit, and that is the
fees of attorneys to represent a person who is sued.
QUESTIONS

QUESTION:

Well, as far as we know, the Attorney

General might do nothing for them after any given day.

There

have been times when the Attorney General has refused to
represent in a setting like this.
MR. WOLF:
far as I know.

There have bean.

They have been rare, as

St seems to me—

QUESTION:

There sire going to be attorneys3 fees,

34
even if the petitioners prevail here» I take it.

Your people

will find them in whatever district they are, and they811
have to hire attorneys to fight the lawsuit.
I had understood that argument to be principally
the kind of ping-pong effect of having to answer depositions
and that sort of thing in a place far from where they resided.
MU, yULF:

That's a prospect, nf course.

As a

matter of fact, this suit has been in litigation for--.it was
filed in 1973, and -there have been a lot of court appearances
in the district court and Court of Appeals, and I have yet to
*

see a defendant, literally.
So it's been no burden yet.

If we get past this

argument, and if we prevail, then all of the instances that
attend to the litigation process are going to come into
being.

But even though they may have to travel, in balancing

thsi equities, they may have to travel, they may have to travel
to sy office if I note the depositions to be taken there.
Bat the fact is that -that might occupy a day of
their time, maybe two days, depending on who the individual
defendant is.

But we all know that, it is the cost of

-attorneys fees that is the great burden in the'defense of
litigation, and that the time—although if it were going to be
a protracted trial elsewhere, that might also occupy some of
.there time.
But -that's not a serious burden, it seems to me.

35

It*8 not a serious burden to east upon individuals who are
charged* as they are her-a, with violating the constitution.
And it * s all a balancing process* as we know* and
to simplify and make convenient the right of citizens to
vindicate their constitutional rights, and to weight that
against such relatively insignificant considerations* such
as: I think a little time—the defendants—
QUESTION:

I still don't understand your attorneys’

fees argument, because it seems to me that if you lose her©*
and the statute is construed here the way the Second Circuit
construed it* it doesn’t mean you can't sue these people.
It; means that you simply have to sue them somewhere else.
And when you sue them somewhere els©* they’re going to have
to retain attorneys where you sue them.
MRo WOLF:

That's true.

The bzilance of advantage

then shifts* Your Honor, because then there’ll be s. muchincreased burden on the plaintiffs.
And although it might not make any difference in
this case* since the plaintiffs in fact are being represented
at. no cost by the ACLU* this really isn’t the paradigmatic
case.

I would ask you to think of a case where—which is a

little case—where the ACLU is not representing the plaintiffs*
where it’s an individual—

MRs WOLF;

QUESTION:

Wliat is new, Mr. Wulf, about the idea that

plaintiffs in lawsuits have greater burdens than the defendants
at the onset?

They have the burden of proof, they have the

burden of beginning the litigation; that!3 always been true,
•hasn’t it?
MRv WOLF:

1 frankly think, Mr. Chief Justice, that

this ease presents the Court with -the question whether in
stilts by citiseas to vindicate violations of constitutional
rights, it doesn’t want to shift the burden.
And that in the interests of defending the
constitution, and in the interests of allowing successful
vindication, convenient vindication and inexpensive
vindication of the violation of constitutional rights, that the
Court ought to construe -iliis statute to serve that purpose.

But under your reading of tfee venue
