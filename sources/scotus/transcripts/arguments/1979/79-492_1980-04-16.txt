PROCEEDINGS
MR- CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Fungaroli v. Fungaroli.
Mr. Morrow, I chink you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F„ MORROW, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. MORROW:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
We are here this morning arguing a case to the
effect that a North Carolina alimony-type Statute, specifi­
cally stating in the Statuta that notice to the defendant is
not required of temporary alimony hearings, is unconstitu­
tional .
QUESTION:

Mr. Morrow, raay I ask you, your Oppo­

nents claim that you did not raise that as a Federal Consti­
tutional Fourteenth Amendment claim in the North Carolina
Courts? and ray own reading of the Opinion of the Court of
Appeals for North Carolina indicates that they say you said
it was invalid, as not giving notice of the hearing; they
don’t mention any federal case or federal constitutional
provisions„
■

*«* >>-.£>•

Did you before them or before the Trial Court put
an issue on federal constitutional grounds of this provision?

4
MR, MORROW:

Nov; of course, we were not before the

Trial Court because there was no notice of the hearing.

I

was not the counsel at that time by the way.
QUESTION:
MR, MORROW:

0'K, how about the •—
But yes, we did raise it on appeal, I

think that our assignments of errors and our Brief before
the North Carolina Court of Appeals will clearly show you
that.

The Court cf Appeals, I simply contend to you ignored

the issue, as did the Supreme Court of North Carolina, when
they ruled it to be a frivolous appeal.
In North Carolina, of course, if you have a con­
stitutional issue, you supposedly have an appeal as a matter
of right to our Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

is a frivolous issue, or is it that

the appeal raised no constitutional questions.

Which was

their holding?
MR. MORROW:

The way I understand the ruling is

that it was a frivolous issue.

The question was there.

But

as they looked at the case, the question really wasn’t
there.
QUESTION:

Is there a time limit, either under the

Rules of the Court or the Statute for the period in which
that temporary order can be extant, without notice?
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:

For a period of

I'm sorry.

Is there a time limit?

Thirty days?

5
Sixty days?
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:

As to how long the order is good?
That's right.
Absolutely not.

In other words ■»-

Many courts, for example on temporary

restraining orders have a rettxrn day when it must be re­
turned or the court imposes a return day.
MR. MORROW:

We try to discuss that in soma detail

in our Brief; to £oinfc out to you that the order is entered;
and then at that time, whenever the defendant is notified,
it’s up to him as to whether or not to go to court? and with
the burden of proof to try to set that order aside? that is,
the order issued under the Statute which we are attacking.
QUESTION:

For our purpose, we really needed to

know, I suppose, the contents of your Brief before the North
Carolina Court of Appeals.
MR. MORROW:
al statement.

Is that in the record here?

Yes, it would be in the jurisdiction­

It is not in our Appendix, but it is in the

jurisdictional statement, I believe.
QUESTION:

Well, but that simply contains your

naked assertion, your jurisdictional statement.

Doesn't it?

I mean it —* or does it contain — I didn't find in it a
quote from your Brief to the North Carolina Court of
Appeals.
QUESTION:

Normally in a record that’s sent up

6
here from the State Court, it might not even contain the
briefs .
QUESTION: That isn’t the question—wasn5t the ques­
tion in the Court of Appeals that you raised, "Did the Court
err in conducting an alimony pendente lite hearing as the
Plaintiff Appellant did not have notice of said hearings?"
MR. MORROW:

That is the way the question was pre­

sented in the Brief.
QUESTION:

Was there anything else presented to

the Court?
MR. MORROW:

Well, the assignment, the specific

assignment of error.
QUESTION:

Well, where is that that says it is a

federal question:
MR. MORROW:

It's in the specific assignment of

error.
QUESTION:
MR. MORROW:

Well, I’m asking for it*

Where?

That would also be what would be in

the Brief as well as in -~
QUESTION:

In the Brief to the North Carolina

Court of Appeals?
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:

Yes, and to the Supreme Court.
And both of those are here in the rec­

ord. somewhere else:.

It is clearly my understanding that

MR. MORROW:

Well, what, do we know — how can you

tell me what you presented to the Court of Appeals?
MR. MORROW:

MR. MORROW;
to the Court.

Well, I —
Do you want me to go and look for it?
I —
It's OK.
No, sir.

I’ll do it.
I will certainly furnish it

I!ir sorry I do not have it with me.

When we appealed unto this Court, initially the
North Carolina Supreme Court was thinking that they ware to
forward the record, as the Court of Last Resort.

Then they

called me up, and said that we are not forwarding that Rec­
ord because we did not rule on it.

Tha Court of Appeals

will be forwarding the record to the Supreme Court of the
United States.

And actually, the record that you have in

file was forwarded to the Supreme Court of the United
States —* by the Court of Appeals of North Carclina.
Now, I would further point out to the Court With
reference to questions as whether or not the appeal has been
properly raised and has been properly brought before this
Court; that as I understand it, under your Supreme Court

8
Rules, Rule 16(b) is where the motion to dismiss should have
been raised by the Appellee in this case and heard on motion
prior to raising that issue in the Brief on the merits.
QUESTION:

question?

Yes, it would be a jurisdictional

question.
QUESTION:

is the Plaintiff Appellant's

Brief —* is that the Brief that was filed in North Carolina
Court of Appeals.

I just got the record.

MR. MORROW:

That is it right there.

Now the

front of it will tell you whether it is the Brief I filed in
the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

It’s North Carolina Court of Appeals.

You can go ahead.
MR. MORROW:

To specifically go into the Statute,

I think that it is of course a short statute and one that I
can read to you in a short amount of time.

As I read the

Statute, I would ask you yourself to say, does this sound
fair?

Does this sound like the way that we have trials in

the United States?
Now specifically, subsection (e) states:

But, wa often have hearings without

court with the papers without any notice to anyone.

Isn't

that true in your state:

Under very limited circumstances.

Can the State Court enter a temporary

order for temporary alimony and custody of children pending
a return date?
MR. MORROW:

We cite to you in ouz- Brief.

We try

to go over the Statutes of all of the states.
QUESTION:

Well, now, just confine ourselves to

that one question, if you will.
MR.
clearly yes.

MORROW:

In North Carolina, the answer is

That’s what the Statute says.

QUESTION:
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:
MR. MORROW:

Yes, but is that the common practice?
The common practice in North Carolina?
Yes.
No.

The common practice in North

Carolina is to normally serve everybody involved- and. you go
to court and you have a hearing.
QUESTION:
MR. MORROW:

For temporary alimony?
Yes, for temporary alimony.

And cus­

tody.
QUESTION:

Well then, you're quite different from

10

almost all the other states where that can be done routinely
with a prompt return date.
MRa MORROW:
other states*

I? of course, do not practice in the

I would wonder if we're that different from

the other states, as I review the Statutes of the other
states, beginning on page 33 of my Brief.
Now, the way a case normally comes on in North
Carolina, whether it’s the alimony complaint or the alimony
counterclaim, a notice of hearing of the temporary hearing
is served; and a hearing date is set.
Winston-Salem, a city of approximately

In our city of
170,000 people,

there will be approximately 20 hearings a week, exactly
this nature.

of

We have a special so-to-speak court — heard

in our district courts, but ws have a judge assigned to hear
these cases 3 days a week, and that’s all that that district
court judge does.

It is the extremely rare case, I would

say to you — or circumstances I would say to you where that
Statute is used.

I might say to you I’ve been practicing 15

years, and I’ve never seen the Statute used before it was
used in this case.
How, a temporary alimony order in North Carolina,
is a very significant part of the alimony case.

In our dis­

trict , and there are approximately 40 districts in North
Carolina covering the 100 counties that we have.

Our dis­

trict only covers one county because we are one of the

II
larger counties.

But in our districti- it is normally 12

months or longer before you can receive your jury

trial; and

therefore, whatever is ordered, whether it is $5.00 a week
or $5,000 a vreek or nothing, at the temporary alimony

hear­

ing, it has a rather long-lasting effect on the amount of
moneys that are paid on settlement negotiations and so on
over the next; 1.2 months or what have you until the trial is
reached.

It is net an order that normally lasts a week or

ten days or what have you.

In fact, it is quite to the con­

trary .
QUESTION:

If you went into the Court and moved

for hearing following the entry of the order, would the
Court grant you a hearing?
MR. MORROW;
Brief.

We try again to discuss that in our

Now, there is a part of the Statute,

General Statute 50-16.9, that states;

North Carolina

"Upon a showing of

substantial change in material circumstances, a party may
move the Court to modify or vacate an order."
Now, what that, number one, would do in this case,
assuming that the defendant desired to try to take advantage
of 50-16.9, he would have to be the moving party that has
filed his motion in court, so notified the other side, and
go to court.

He, and most importantly, I say to you —

would have the burden of proving that there has been a sub­
stantial change in material circumstances since the date of

12

the hearing, the date that the order was entered for him to
pay alimony without notice.
Wow, we strongly contend to you that under the law
and rationale of numerous cases cited, beginning on page 43
and 44 of our Brief, that the shifting of the burden of
proof itfould not allow what I call bootstrapping or stating
that there is inability of the person who has been deprived
of due process to come back to court and rectify through his
own proof the situation.
The case of Armstrong v Manso, I believe, is the
leading case in that area.
the father was not notified.

That is an adoption case where
He did have a right to come

into court under statutes claiming that the adoption
shouldn’t have gone through once he found out about it.

But

he had the burden of proof.
How, our alimony statutes are exactly like that in
Worth Carolina.

At the initial hearing, the wife has the

burden of proving basically two things s
are a fault state.

One is fault.

We

There are 10 grounds for alimony for

everything from adultery to excessive use of alcohol to
abandonment, indignities, what have you.

She has to prove,

number one, fault? and number two, need.

And then the judge

goes into not only her needs, but of course, the abilities
of the husband to provide.
supposed to be heard.

Those are all things that are

The wife, well, defendant spouse, as

13
our Statute reads? but usually the wife has the burden of
proving all of those things.

Fault? need? and ability.

has to prove the husband's ability.

She

He can coma to that

hearing with affirmative defenses such as her own adultery.
Or that she is not a dependent spouse; in fact? she’s a multimiliionaire or what have you.
Now? these are all things that are heard at that
hearing? and those are who the burden of proof is on.

The

wife having the burden of proof of fault? her need and abilitv; and the husband having the burden of proof on his
affirmative defenses at that hearing.
, QUESTION:

I’m not sure I followed your response

to Mr. Justice Powell.
Was there anything to prevent your client from
moving the court as soon as he became aware of the entry of
this order and asking for a hearing?
MR. MORROW:

Well, the only way I know he can do

it would be under 50-16.9.
QUESTION:

Well? can he move in the court to get a

hearing on the issues?
MR. MORROW:

Well., that is actually a move to mod-

ify based upon a substantial change in circumstances.
QUESTION:

Whatever you call it, can he get into

the court to have these issues examined?
MR„ MORROW:

He can get into the court? and he has

14
the burden of proof.
QUESTION:

And if he has the burden of showing

that the circumstances have changed under the statutory lan­
guage, doesn't he?
MR, MORROW:
QUESTION:

And the circumstances have changed,
Now that I've interrupted you, your

client, initiated this litigation, didn't he?
MR. MORROW:

A suit for straight custody of the

chiId.
QUESTION:

So he submitted himself to the juris­

diction of the court?
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
So there is no constitutional ques­

tion, at least with respect to the jurisdiction of the court
over him?
MR. MORROW:

No body has ever questioned jurisdic-

fcion.
QUESTION:

And therefore, we don't have the con™

stitutional question that would be presented if a court pur­
ported to exercise personal jurisdiction over somebody outside the jurisdiction of the court?
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:

That is not the question at all.
All right.

Not here at all.

MR. MORROW:

Well, burden of proof ancillary to

It is a very basic due process problem.

that is, that he would have to initiate the action to cor­

MR, MORROWi
QUESTION:

MOW —
Mr. Morrow, could I ask you a question?

This is an unusual situation because we've got a counter­
claim in effect.

If you had a case in which the moving

party was also the plaintiff? and say the wife is the
plaintiff, and the husband had left the state and was not
represented by counsel, and you had any of the other condi"
tions set forth in subparagraph (e), would you contest the
constitutionality of the statute in those circumstances?
MR. MORROW:
Nov/,

I certainly would.

in this case, we contest it as applied in

the case as well as on its face.
QUESTION:

Because of the fact he was represented

by counsel.
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:

Yes.

He was of course.

But how would you deal with — if you

say the filing of a brand new law suit, and the husband is
departed for parts unknown or is about to remove property,
what would you say the statute should require to satisfy due
process?
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:
MR„ MORROW:

The statute ~~
— ample notice -I!m not saying that this type of sta­

tute could not be constitutional.

What I'm saying the sta­

tute as drawn? it could not be more broad I contend to you.

17
It’s clearly unconstitutional.

Now, there're basically

three things in the statute, and they're not in the conjunctive.

You show anyone of these three, and supposedly you

can just forget serving that husband even if ha’s standing
right there in the courthouse.
QUESTION;

Not if he's standing in the courthouse;

because if ha shall have abandoned the dependent spouse and
left the state by hypothesis, he's not standing in the
courthouse.

Or shall be in parts unknown.

there he's not standing in the courthouse.

By hypothesis
In the third

situation, he's about to remove all his property and leave
the state, but you might give him notice and be sure he can
get away before the papers are served.

That's the problem

there.
MR. MORROW:

You can give proper notice in that

situation.
QUESTION:

Could it be accompanied by

a restrain­

ing order forbidding —
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:
MR, MORROW:

Restraining order —Ex parte.
Yes.

I think ex parte.

Under that,

third section, you may be properly alleging some type of
irreparable damage where due process may not be violated
under the lav? as I understand it and contend it to this
court.

And I don't quite frankly concede that as I read the

18

due process cases on those.
QUESTION:

How does irreparable damage tie in with

notice and hearing in the due process?

I had always thought

of irreparable damage as being an element that you have to
show in order to obtain a permanent injunction or perhaps a
temporary injunction, and that due process notice and hear­
ing requirements were not necessarily tied into irreparable
damage.
MR. MORROW:

Like I said, I don’t concade that

even if they allowed or alleged some type of irreparable
damage if they could not get away with -- you know — with­
out giving notice.

I don’t concede that.

In most of your

T.R —* temporary restraining orders, cases, what the plain­
tiff is trying to do when he is trying to get his .restrain­
ing order is maintain some type of status quo.

In this

case, in your alimony cases, you’re going to court for
affirmative action to take money out of that man's pocket.
Give it to me.

Let me do whatever I want to with it.

money back?

Then

Hoi"» does he get his

In other words, we’re dealing with something

much more, 2 contend to this Honorable Court, than somebody
trying to maintain a status quo without actual notice to the
other person.
Now, our statute says that if one of these three
things exists, then you go to court, and you get your order,

19
and that's all the statute says.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't it part of the status quo

the normal support which a husband is lawfully required to
give to his wife?

And temporary alimony maintains the

status quo in some form.
MR. MORROW2

Well, then, if that were a proper

hypothetical? then every case, why give the man notice?
Just let the one side go to court —
QUESTION:

Tell me why it is not an analogous

case.
- MR* MORROW:

In the due process of all cases deal-"

ing with notice, the right to be heard, the right to know
that the case is pending and go into court and defend your™
self.

In those cases, the court I contend to you has always

held that unless there is some extraordinary situation usu­
ally dealing with a very important public or governmental
interest, that you just can't do it.
fairness.

It is a violation of

It is a violation of due process of law.
QUESTION:

Typical service by mail statute or sub­

stitute service statute frequently requires 30 days return
date, 20 days return date.

Now, if your opposing counsels

move that this man had removed himself to Fairfax County,
Virginia, and went about serving him under the notice that
permanent alimony order would be requested on such-and-such
a date, would you say that a court could, not in the interim

20
even before he received the notice in Fairfax County,
Virginia, order temporary alimony?
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:

1 certainly would.
So a man can simply move away

3,000

miles; and until you can somehow get personal jurisdiction
over him, he’s home free so far as his duty to support is
concerned.
Well, you have

personal jurisdiction over him

because he came in here as a plaintiff and submitted hixciself
to the jurisdiction of the court.
MR. MORROW:

And the next thing you know, the

court's entering orders, and he doesn’t know a thing about
it.
QUESTION:

When you come in as a party to the

court and submit yourself to its jurisdiction, then there's no
question of the personal jurisdiction of the court over y cu.
Is there?
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:

Absolutely not.
That’s constitutional power to issue

orders that personally involve your liability.

Is there?

There's no constitutional question.
MR. MORROW;
QUESTION:

No constitutional question,
Aren’t you on notice in effect once you

file a lax»/ suit of proceedings that take place in that
court?

MR. MORROWs

21
1 contend that you certainly are not.

That you are required to notice, soma type of notice, under
due process of law, as to when your case is going to be
heard.
How, I simply note the diversity, or ask you all
to, between the statute as drawn, and drawing a narrow sta­
tute to where the legislature says s

How we see that this —

something could happen, where real lack of notice would be
proper.

I would contend to you, and I don’t have the sta­

Finally, if I might, I would ilka to try to address

the application of the statuta in the instant case.
QUESTION:

We have only about three minutes left

so you'd better bear that in mind.
MR* MORROW:

I feel that it is very clear in the

record and is actually found by the court order of the dis­
trict court judge that number one, of course, they knew
counsel of record.

25
And number two, they knew where the defendant was
exactly,

Now, what had happened, what the record clearly

shows is, he had left the state; he had gone to his home in
Fairfax; and he had filed a further custody hearing in the
State of Virginia; and had personally served those papers on
the wife who was in North Carolina.

He was exercising the

jurisdiction at that time down in the North Carolina courts,
but attempting to exercise the jurisdiction of the. Virginia
courts.

That was the reason that he had left the state.

And that's why I say that's one of the things primarily
wrong with this statute,

all it says is left the state.

For whatever reason, good reason or bad reason, they

say

that you do not have to give notice in that statute.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER3

Mr. Brown.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF B. ERVIN BROWN, II, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. BROWN;

Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the

Court, I happened to bring with me today 9 copies of the rele
vant section of

Mr. Morrow's brief? as wall as 9 copies of

his direct appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court.

If

the Court didn’t have those available, I'll be glad to pass
them up.
QUESTION;
MR. BROWN;

You may lodge them with the Clerk.
Several questions are presented here

today, of course, for the Court's consideration; and the

26
primary one I am concerned with, of course, is the one
that's already been raised? and that’s whether the appellant
has met his burden under Street v New York and other estab­
lished decisions of this Court; to raise the issue timely
and in a timely fashion, and a clear fashion in the courts
below; to give these courts, to give opposing counsel an
opportunity to respond to those questions.
Appellee submits that that question has never been
properly presented; that the burden hasn't been met hare
today; that indeed, it cannot be met.

Rule 10(c) of the

North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that
each assignment of error shall, so far as practicable, be
confined to a single issue of law and shall state plainly
and concisely and without argumentation the basis upon which
error is assigned; and the exceptions not thus listed will
be deemed abandoned.
Now, in the grouping of exceptions and assignments
of error, the appellant simply stated that the trial court
committed prejudicial error in conducting a hearing upon the
defendant's motion for temporary alimony in that the defend­
ant had not properly served the answer and counterclaim upon
the plaintiff; and in that the plaintiff was not given
notice of this hearing.

That assignment of error so worded,

appellee would contend to the Court, was abandoned or did
not raise the constitutional issue of this statute.

And at

27
that point, the issue was abandoned-

Furthermore, Rule

28(a) of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure,
dealing with the function and content of briefs, states that
the function of all briefs required and permitted to be
filed is to define clearly the questions presented to the
reviewing court and to present the arguments and authorities
upon which the parties rely in support of their respective
position thereon.

Review is limited to questions so pre-

sented in the several briefs.
Now as Mr. Justice Marshall has pointed out, the
brief in this case simply said:

Did the court err in con­

ducting an alimony pendente Xifce hearing as the plaintiff
appellant had no notice of said hearing.
QUESTIONs

after that assignment of error, the brief had argued:

QUESTION:

It may be that’s a valid observation

with respect to whether this is a proper appeal or not,
but that ’would just mean it might be a certiorari question

MR. BROWN;

I agree with chat.

Mr. Justice White, what I think the question I
asked in response very simply is:

Is it too much to ask for

someone who’s going to take a case up on appeal and ulti­
mately, supposedly challenge the constitutionality

of the

statute to say at some initial point in the appellate proc­
ess:

This statute's unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

Well, that may be so, but how about a

29
claim that he had been denied due process in these proceed­
ings?
MR. BROWN:

I think that really goes

that would

be sort of an as-applied argument; and because of the peculiar nature of this statute — in other words, this statute
mandates a certain procedure.
effect says:

This statute, if yen will, in

Under certain limited situations, you don't

have to give notice.

So I can't see how you could argue

that anything's unconstitutional unless the statute's uncon­
stitutional.

In other words, if you says

I've been denied

due process simply because I don’t have notice; unless the
statute’s unconstitutional, that argument seems to me to be
irrelevant.
QUESTION:

Well, if that’s true, Mr, Brown, one

could construe the statute as only applying in cases where
there's no counterclaim; vrhere the plaintiff goes in, and
the defendant is not yet represented by counsel; and that's
quite a different problem.
You ask if it's too much for the jurisdictional
statement to identify the problem better.

Couldn’t one also

ask whether ifcrs too much for the .response to the jurisdic­
tional statement to identify the jurisdictional problem if
it’s so obvious?

You can see the jurisdiction.

MR. BROWN:

I can only make a heart-felt apology

about that, and I have what I think is some justification?

30

and that. is, it wasn't until the brief was filed that the
statute was laid on the lineo

the jurisdictional statement was filed, it seemed to me that

MR. BROWN:

Well, 1 don’t —

tional question in the state courts properly? and that in
the course of these proceedings, had been denied federal due

And I take it you could enter a final decree of

36

MR, BROWNs

You certainly couldn't under this sta­

tute because this statute’s narrowly drawn and is just
applied to temporary alimony situation.

And that, I think,

in light of soma of the questions asked of Mr, Morrow might
bear some clarification.
Temporary alimony, hox^ever

entered, is good only

during the pendency of the case in chief.

That .is, once you

have a hearing, a trial on the case in chief on alimony,
then all sorts of things can happen.

I mean, if you — if

the wife had been given alimony, and you're the husband, and
you go to trial, and you. win, alimony ceases at that point.
If you go to trial and you lose, the court could order you
to pay an amount less than what you’ve been paying under the
temporary alimony order.

So that the temporary alimony

is

certainly a ~~ the ultimate judicial determination is made
by trial on the merits involving the alimony question.
And I might also point out that in some ways, a
supporting spouse who has been ordered to pay alimony,
either with or without notice, is to some extent better off
in terms oil remedies available to him than, for example,
Miss Puentes was in Fuentes versus Shevin.

All he’s got to

do, if he is ordered with or without notice to pay temporary
alimony, is take final notice of appeal tc the North Carolina
court of appeals, post a $2GC appeal bond? and during
the pendency of that appeal, the trial court is entirely

37

functus officio as to any enforcement capabilities.

That

is f he can go without paying anything he8 s been ordered to
pay.

Now, the risk he runs, if he does that, if he loses on

appeal then, the trial court could, if it so chose, hold him
in contempt, for not having made the payments during the
course of the appeal.
he's lost nothing.
QUESTION;

If he wins the appeal, of course,

MR* BROWN;
QUESTION;

That’s correct, Your Honor.
And you knew who the counsel was?
That’s correct.
Personally?

MR, BROWN:

That’s correct.

QUESTION;

I'm puzzled, too.

Before you went in

to apply for the order on temporary alimony, why didn't you
call up the lawyer and just tell him you were going to do
it?
MR. BROWN;

I've got an answer for that, but I'm

told it's outside the record, and I can’t tell you.

I had

some knowledge that was available to me at that time, but
it’s not in the record.
QUESTION:

I think you mentioned earlier, didn’t

MR. BRONNs

No. When I did get to file mv motion

for temporary alimony, by that time, I was cognizant of the
existence of this statute? and when 1 presented the motion
to the trial judge, I of course brought to his attention —
QUESTION;
MR. BROWN:

section (e) —
And the documents we submitted along

with the motion ~—
QUESTION:

And specifically this subparagraph (e)

of the statute.
MR. BROWN:

That's correct.

That's correct.

You will note in the order, the order itself
awarding the temporary alimony, he makes a finding of fact
there in the first paragraph of that order, that no notice
was given and none is required pursuant to the provisions of
50-16.8<e)o

So the trial judge knew that.

He also knew by

documents submitted to him at the time the motion was made

39
that Mr. Fungaroli left the state because we submitted the
pleadings, verified pleadings he filed in Virginia.
QUESTION:

Well, did the trial judge snake an

express finding of any kind chat he was acting pursuant to
subdivision (e) having found that he'd left the state?
MR. BROWN:

The trial judge, Mr. Justice, sir,

went and made an express finding — the only express finding
if I understand, your question as to the statute was because
he left the state.

He had abandoned his wife.

No notice

was required under this statute, and he mentioned the sta­
tute expressly.

Now, that motion is supported by the record

of course in the trial court and the record in this Court.
That in fact he was gone, and the appellant makes no asser­
tion hers today, nor has he ever made an assertion other
than the fact that he hadn’t abandoned his wife..
claimed that he didn't leave the stata.

He’s never

He's never claimed

that he provided any support to her since December 21st when
he took out the complaint and had her involuntarily commit­
ted to a mental hospital.

He’s never claimed that he was

incapable of making any support payments that were ordered.
QUESTION:

You really are arguing that as long as

he’s abandoned and has left the state, that that automati­
cally terminates any obligation which respect to notice.
MR. BROWNs
QUESTION:

The very wording of the statute —
I don’t care whether you rely

on the

40

statute or what you5re relying on, but that's what you're
arguing.

And that that1s constitutional.
MR. BROWNs

tion between as-applied and on its face.

If

y ax're asking

me if this ever came up again, would I give notice, and I
ttfouid say —*

That isn’t what I‘m asking you.

I'm

of abandonment and leaving the state.

QUESTION:

I think so.

I do have to say that.

Mitchell or whatever it is.

MR. BROWN:

We’re not talking

about anything else.
QUESTION:
MR. BROWN:

Nothing but the tempo­

And whether you look at Puentes or Mitchell

or Di-Chem, what you find in every single one of those cases
whether it requires prior notice or it doesn’t, is some

41
discussion about the legitimate protection of the creditor
interest.

That seams to me what the legislature was trying

to do here.

The legislature said — and they've done it not

only in this statute, they've done it in other statutes we
cited there in the brief.

They’ve given the dependent

spouse creditor status for purposes of collection and
enforcement of temporary alimony.

Arid what they were doing

here, whether it was wise or unwise, was attempting to pro­
vide some sort of protection; and I submit to you that the
very wording of the statute makes it clear that that’s what
they were concerned with.

It was a ~~ in the words of

Mitchell — debtor acting in bad faith.

Whether he was

secretly destroying and concealing his assets or whether he
was fleeing to Virginia and leaving his wife with no means
of support.

Whichever one of those things he was doing - -

what the legislature in its wisdom or not in its wisdom
thought it was doing, was trying to provide some means of
protection for a dependent spouse who was dealing with a
supporting spouse who was acting in bad faith.
I submit to you the facts in this case, the record
in this case — 1 can’t conceive of an individual ever hav­
ing acted in more bad faith throughout the entire course of
litigation than the appellant has in this case.

He's simply

thumbed his nose at the courts and disregarded court orders,
and simply in effect said;

IE11 do what I want to do.

42
I think not even a close reading — just a cursory

reading

of the record, in ray opinion, leads one or should lead one
to that implication.
QUESTION:

Counsel, there's an order in the appen­

dix, at page 35, by Judge Freeman, who I take it is the pre­
siding judge of the superior court, authorizing the appel­
lant's counsel of record to withdraw.

Is that something in

connection with the contempt order?
MR. BROWN:
the contempt order.

Yes.

Yes, that was in connection with

Mot — it was a contempt order that had

nothing to do per se with this alimony.

It had to do — it

was a motion for contempt for his failure to provide his
wife visitation with the child.

Right about the point that

motion was coming up, the appellant fired his attorney who's
mentioned in this order, a Mr. Parker, who had been his
attorney

I personally know him

attorney all along.

had been Mr, Fungaroil's

He fired that attorney and, at that

point, hired, retained Mr. Morrow, or had his father retain
Mr. Morrow.

He was in town, the father was in town, but the

appellant was not.

He sent his father down to the show-cause

hearing; retained Mr. Morrow, and the court granted Mr.
Parker's motion to withdraw, and Mr. Morrow then became the
appellant's retained counsel at that point.
I think just to reiterate quickly on Mr. Justice
reference
Marshall's observation, there's not a singljejrin the brief

43
here on the jurisdictional question, not a single reference
to a federal case»

I in fact made a mistake in. my

brief in

saying that Morrow cited Muilane v. Central Hanover Bank and
Trust Company»

He in fact didn't.

What’s cited is the 1951

state court case of McLean versus McLean, and there's a
lengthy quote from that case in the brief, and the last por­
tion of that quote happens to be a quote within a quote cit­
ing Muilane,

So

at

the point we went to the court of

appeals, and as 1 said before, up really until Mr. Morrow
filed his brief with this Court,

wiat we were dealing with

there was three —- he cited three North Carolina domestic
cases and the citations of Strong's Index.

Now, literally,

I feel like this case contained a federal question once it
was filed in the United States Supreme Court.
In summary, I think, it's our contention that (!)
of course that the issue has s*ot been properly presented?
and for that reason, should be dismissed,
imd that

\2) ,

if -the Court feels otherwise about

that, then the state has reached a perhaps not perfect, but
a fair constitutional accommodation of the competing interests
of dependent, and supporting spouses as well as the legiti­
mate interest of the state? and that the statute for that
reason should ba sustained.
If there are no other questions, I really won't
take up any more of the Court's time.

44
QUESTION:

Do you have anything further, Mr.

Morrow:
MR. MORROW:

No, I don’t, Your Honor.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
