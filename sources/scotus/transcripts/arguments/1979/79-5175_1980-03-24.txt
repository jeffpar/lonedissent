MR-. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear argu­

ment nest in Adams v. Texas.
Mr. Bruder„ you >aay proceed whenever you are

ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELVYN CARSON BRUDE, ESQ.,
OM BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRUDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and. nay it

please the Court:
We are dealing In this case with the right of
a state to exclude prospective furors from a capital ease
solely because of their attitudes or feelings about the
death penalty.

By statute, that is section 1231(b) of

the' Texas Penal Cade, Texas In our opinion has Impermis­
sibly broadened the base of exclusion beyond the,
parameters established by the Witherspoon doctrine.

And

to the extent that Witherspoon does not allow the 'exclu­
sion of any Juror because of personal feelings about the
death penalty, unless there is unmistakable irrevocable
commission on the part af the prospective juror to vote
against death, 123Kb) Impedes upon Witherspoon to the
extent that it allows the exclusion of the juror for a
reason less than that described in Witherspoon.
As proof of our position, we submit that any
time a juror Is qualified under Witherspoon and says I

can in a proper case and under the right circumstances
vote death* whenever such a juror is excluded under state
law solely because of the juror’s feelings about capital
punishment, the juror is excluded on a broader basis than
*

provided in Witherspoon.
QUESTION:

You are suggesting that there is a

gray cone of some kind here where a juror, a prospective
juror might be influenced by the fact that the death
penalty was Involved or, on the other hand, might not be?
MR. BRUDER:

I'm suggesting that as long as the

juror is willing to state "I can vote death in the right
case,* that juror is qualified vis-a-vis his feelings
about the death penalty.
QUESTION:

By the right case, taking that

phrase, does that mean the right case as he sees it or
the right ease as within the framework of the instructions
of the court?
MR. BRUDER:

It means the right case under the

evidence within the framework of the instructions given
by the court and as he views the fasts, because he is a
personal representative of the community and it is he who
must express the community consciencee

And under the

guarded jury discretions, that is specifically provided
for under the Texas capital punishment scheme.

The jury

has the discretion to utilize what evidence and facts is

5
made available, and by answering the three questions,
knowing what the effect of those answers explicitly is,
the jury exercises that community conscience.

Thus,

Witherspoon requires that that base defined in Witherspoon
apply to jury selection in the state of Texas»
Now, the state has constructed a theoretical
model upon which it hopes to convince this Court that
123Kb) stands for a proposition that even the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals has disowned.

The state argues

and agrees with us that Witherspoon does apply in Texas.
I take that to dispose 3f question number one under the
grant of cert.
So we go to tie next question, and the state
argues that Witherspoon is not violated in this case and
theoretically in any other case in Texas because the real
purpose of 123Kb) is to exclude those jurors who are
affected to the extent that they '.fill allow their personal
feeliags to influence their vote, and. that is not what
1231(o) says and that is not what the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals las construed 1231(b) to say.

In fact,

the Court of Criminal Appeals has said just the opposite.
A juror who states under oath ”1 will answer
the questions honestly, I will answer the three punish­
ment questions truthfully, I will put aside whatever
reservations I may have about capital punishment wnen I

6
answer*-those three questions/' that does not rehabilitate
a prospective juror who has already said "I will be
affected by the existence of the death penalty in this
case„15
So clearly the Court of Criminal Appeals has
rejected what this Court suggested could exist in Lockett
v. Ohio, that is that it is fair to excuse from jury
service any prospective juror who says ”1 can5t follow the
law,“ and Witherspoon pretty much said the same thing.
QUESTION:

How do you apply that to Juror White

who was examined in the appendix at the upper pages, 20,
25» 2?, somewhere in there?
MR. BRUDER:

Juror White specifically qualified

under Witherspoon on page 26 in our opinion.

He was then

asked on page 27, "May I from your answers — are you
saying that this mandatory sentence of death or life would
affect your deliberations on the issues of fact in the
case including those three questions" — "Yes, sir."

And

then if you go on to pages 28 and 29 —
QUESTION:

Didn't he have a little more there?

Juror White said, ”1 think I believe in capital punish­
ment, but I don't want to have anything to do with it.
Is that clear?"

Those lire all his words.

MR. BRUDER;
correct.

Yes, that’s correct.

That * s

7
QUESTION:

Does that suggest that he doesn't

want to impose it?
MR. BRUDER:

It may suggest it, but I think that

Juror White was not absolutely disqualified under
Witherspoon*

Juror White never indicated that there would

be an automatic vote against death, and
QUESTION:

-

Look at his answer at the bottom of

page 27 and the question and his answer at the top of
page 28.
MR. BRUDER:

It is still equivocal.

And the

important thing is that, on the one hand, the state says
in it3 brief we really don't have to concern ourselves
about the ultimate issue because the juror writes yes

answers or no answers and it is the judge who sets the
punishment *

And at the same time Juror White says —*

"Could you set aside your feelings and vote for the
death penalty, either directly or indirectly?"
I could*

I guess I could." -"You have to.

”1 guess

You have to

vote the question, the answers to the questions honestly,
irregardless of what you think the penalty should beyou think you can do that?"
circumstances justified it?"

"Yes."

"If the facts and

"Yes."

So under state theory number one, Juror White
is eminently qualified.

But under state theory number

two, which is inconsistent with number one, Juror White

Do

Is not qualified and it is difficult fro® an analysis of
their positions to determine which theory it Is that they
want this Court to apply*
QUESTION:

After the last answer of the Juror

that /ou have Just referred to, Juror White said it would
probably affect me in my deliberationss and then the
judge said would it be fair then to say that you cannot
give us your assurance that you would not be affected by
the punishment of life or death in deliberating on the
facts of this case.

That is correct, the juror said..

That is correct. .
MR. BRUDER:

Yea, sir.

And the one thing that

we have not addressed ourselves to at all in the briefs s
perhaps not enough anywayis the problem of the word
"affect," and it is something which unfortunately the
Court of Criminal Appeals has refused to address itself
t-o.
What does the word "affect" mean?
doesn't define it.

The; statute

The courts won't define it.

I think

a fair reading of the appendix and a fair reading of the
voir lira examination in this case clearly indicates that
what iappens is that a prosecutor defines xfc for the
juror before asking him the critical question called for
by 123Kb) o
QUESTION:

But both of the two questions just

s
asked you by the Chief Justice were posed by the court
and not by the prosecuting attorney.
MR. BRUDER:

I don’t think it matters whether

the court uses 1231(b) In violation of Witherspoon or
whether it is the prosecutor.

It is the defendant who is

injured by a violation of Witherspoon, and just as in
Witherspoon itself, it was the court who wholesale excluded
jurors that voiced conscientious scruples against the
death penalty*
QUESTION:

Well, suppose all we had was the

colloquy on page 28 of the appendix, the question by the
court, "All right.

Would it be fair then to say that you

cannot give us your assurance that you would not bs
affected by the punishment of life or death in deliberat­
ing the fact Issues in the case;?"
correct.”

Juror White, "That*s

Did you think —
MR„ BRUDER:Does it rest on that?
QUESTION:

That was the sole colloquy that

the court had with Juror White or anybody else had with
Juror White., do you think it would have been, a violation

I

of the federal Constitution to exclude Juror I White for
i

cause?

1

MR. BRUDER:

Most assuredly.

i
Juror, Whits has

not said anything which prevents Juror White from per­
forming her duties under Texas law as & juror in a capital

10
case, unless you accept the validity of 1231(b) as being
the end-all question to test the qualification of a juror,
QUESTION:•

What if the next question said though,

what do you mean by affect.

Well, I am very likely to be

very sympathetic and in the case of a tie, if I am really
in doubt, I bm going V vote in favor of the defendant
just because I am aga.ir st the death penalty, would that
add anything to you?
MR. BRUDER:
QUESTION:

It hurts me.
I know, but could the juror then be

excluded?
MR. BRUDER:
the world-

That makes all the difference in

That brings the case within Lockett, where

the juror
QUESTION:

Then if the juror said — if the

juror had earlier said., well, I think I can answer the
question as truthfully and faithfully without regard to
my feelings about the death penalty, but ultimately had
said what I just suggested he cald, then his.answers
would, be just inconsistent, wouldn’t they?

m. BRUDER:
QUESTION:

They' would.

They clearly would.

And yet you think it is net incon­

sistent between his earlier answers that he could answer
these questions fairly and his later answer that, well,
my opposition to the dath penalty will affect my verdict.

...z
You don’t think that is

MRo BRUDER:

inconsistent?

I think they are inconsistent and

I think the only solution is the same solution that the
Fifth Circuit proposed in Burns v. Estelles there must be
continuing inquiry made of that juror to attempt to find
out which of the inconsistent positions is the strong
position.

But —
QUESTION:

This was the last one anyway, wasn't

it, and it was the one that the Judge chose to believe?
MR. BRUDER:

QUESTION?:

Juror White?

Yes,

MR. BRUDER:
QUESTION:

Wasn't the last juror,, no.
I know, but this was the last- ques­

tion of Juror White.
MR. BRUDER:

Yes.

Now, our position on 1231(b) is that it attempts
to statutorily codify f

single question which can be usee

to satisfy the Witherspoon standard, but it doesn't go fas*
enough.

’/hat it should do is define affect.

What it

should do is coma up with a second question or a second
phrase, as suggested by Mr. Justice White, will this
affect your deliberations to the extent that you will not
vote honestly, that you will not follow the law, that you
will not be truthful.
If 1231(b) said that or if the Texas Court of

12
Criminal Appeals elected to construe 1231(b) that way,
then I think our position would be far, fas’ weaker.
QUESTION:

Do you think you should force a juror

to say nos I will not be truthful?

This is a little bit

like a lot of the polling process, the answer is deter­
mined by the question if you put it the way you put it.
MR. BRUDER;

I think the answers are determined

by the questions in the voir dire examination in this
case, very clearly, because if you have a person on the
witness stand on voir dire examination, the pattern is the
same in all of these cases, not only in the Adams case
but In all of them.

Mr, or Mrs. Juror, what is your

feeling about the death penalty?
tions about it

4

I have some reserva­

I know that the law provides for it, but

I personally don’t want to be involved.

Well, our law

provides that you have to answer this question.

Mow,

taking into account your personal feelings against the
imposition of the death penalty, the fact that you would
not really want to participate in the decision-making
process leading to the taking of a men's life, can you
state under oath that that will not affect your'deliber­
ations?
I don’t think any self-searching person is
going; to say anything but, of course it will affect my
deliberations.

13
QUESTION:

Wells does he belong on the jury?

MR. BRUDER:

Without knowing what that person

means, he certainly is not subject to exclusion, whether
or not he —'
QUESTION:

Well, he certainly wouldn’t have

meant that I would be more likely to vote guilt because I
am opposed to the death penalty.

He couldn’t have meant

that.
QUESTION:

Isn’t the most likely meaning of

affect the second question that Justice White put to you
a moment ago, that it will affect in favor of resolving
doubts in favor of the defendant, that he would not other­
wise resolve under the judge’s charge?
MR, BRUDER:

No, I think the voir dire examina­

tion shows that a number of the veniremen questioned
interpreted the word "affect” to mean a heightened sensi­
tivity to the case.

I would want to be sure.

In other

This is a capital case.

We are talking about a

And I take this to be a heightened sensi­

tivity situation where I am going to respond carefully.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think that has to be *

developed with any juror, that he is going to treat a
death case differently from a petty theft case?
MR. BRUDER:

Do I think it has to he developed?

14
QUESTION:

Yes, do you think that needs to be

developed the way you suggest it?
MR. BRUDER:
QUESTION:

Yea,
And then interpret the answers as

merely expressing a heightened sensitivity?
MR. BRUDER:

It is the only way to ascertain

whether or not the juror interprets the word "affect"•as
meaning heightened sensitivity or interprets the; word
"affect" as meaning I can’t folio?? the law,

We have

no —
QUESTION:
page 32,

The Court:

Then how about Curtis Williams,
"Would you be influenced by the

death penalty part to keep you from voting yes?"

The

Witness: “1 think I would be influenced by the death
penalty."

It sounds to me like he is saying yes. I

would be- influenced in i way that would keep me from
voting yes.

What do you think about that?

MR. BRUDER:

I think, Your Honor, that Mr.

Williams is a very weak example of our position,
QUESTION:

What shout a juror who is asked on

voir dire about statutory questions and responds

in

favor of capital punishment but gives the same sort of
affect answers and the defense challenges for cause?
Now, would you say that the court could turn down that
sort of a challenge because all he meant was that his

15
sensitivity was heightened?
MR. BRUDER:

I'm not sure I follow the question.

Are you saying that if the defense challenged for cause
under 1231(h)?
QUESTION:
MR. BRUDER:

Yes.
Well* I don’t think the challenge

for cause exists in the law.

I think 1231(b) provides for

challenge for cause that Is unconstitutional and it
wouldn’t matter who made the challenge, it would still be
a violation of Witherspoon.
QUESTION;

But certainly a defendant in Texas

has challenges for cause, d© they not?
MR. BRUDER:
QUESTION:

Certainly’, but I ~
And couldn't one of them be baited on

the way the particular venireman answered the three
questions ir. the statute under consideration?
MR. BRUDER:

Theoretically that is possible,

but from a practical standpoint it has never happened
to my knowledge.

It certainly didn't happen in this case.

And la the other 1231(b) cases that have been tried in
Texas, it hasn't happened„ according to people who have
read those records and advised me.

It has always been a

MR. BRUDER:

That, is what ~

Exactly*
It held that jurors could not be ex­

Witherspoon.
MR. BRUDER:

Once they meet the threshold test,

they are allowed to go on that jury and cannot foe struck
for any reason which is based upon their personal feel­
ings about the death penalty.
QUESTION:

But Witherspoon didn't involve how

it would affect their gailt or innocence vote, did it?
MR. BRUDER:
QUESTION:

Yes, it did,
I know, but it didn't say that it

was wrong to exclude the juror if he conceded that it
might make him more likely to vote for innocence.
MR. BRUDER:

Witherspoon test recites that unless it is shown that
the juror will never vote for death or that his feelings

On the question of guilt or innocence.

MR. BRUDER:

And what we deal with in application with respect to

jurors who cannot vote death»

It is never used or rarely

used in regards to their ability to fairly resolve the
guilt-innocence issues.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bruder. X want to be sure, about

If the Court should decide In your

favor here, what is the remedy?

Does it go back for a

new trial on guilt or innocence or- merely on sentencing?
MR. BRUDER:

lour Honor9 the remedy as far as

this Court is concerned is to vacate the judgment insofar
as It imposes the death sentence.
QUESTION:

Under Texes law —

So you have answered my question

only on the sentence ar.d not on the basic, conviction?

18
MR. BRUDER:

Right.

We have not argued and we

have not taken any position that the Jury selection in
this case affected the guilt-innocence determination.
QUESTION:

What would happen in the Texas court

if we cavated the death sentence?
MR. BRUDER;

The Texas court would have no alter­

native but to either send it back for a. new trial or if
the Governor elects to soiamute his sentence to life then
he has no recourses which has been done in the past.
QUESTION:

Do you meari a new trial on guilt or

innocence?
MR. BRUDER:

Yes*

Under Texas law, any time

punishment is assessed by a Jury and there is a defect in
the punishment process, the entire case is reversed and
it is sent back from square one.
QUESTION: So if we Just vacate the death sen­
tence, there is a new trial?
MR. BRUDER:
QUESTION:

X high probability,
And yet that is Just a quirk of Texas

law?
MR. BRUDER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Well, actually we would only sand it

back for further proceedings, not inconsistent —
MR. BRUDER:
QUESTION:

Not inconsistent.
— with our decision, and then it

19
would be up to the Texas courts to say whether it is a new
trial on guilt or innocence,
MR. BRUDER:
QUESTION:

That*s true.
But you are telling us that the

prospect is that there would he.
MR. BRUDER:
there would be.

Cher© is a very good prospect that

The only thing I can say is that histor­

ically following one 1372 death penalty decisions the
Governor commuted almos; all of the people on death row.
QUESTION:

And that, avoids a new trial on guilt

or innocence.
MR. BRUDER:

Right.

That is, the legality of

that has been challenged and has been upheld.
QUESTION:

What you are saying then Is that

for the federal law purposes9 a decision here in your
favor does not affect the validity of the basic convic­
tion.
MR, BRUDER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
And it is only because of the Texas

law quirk that it does,
MR. BRUDER:

That is correct.

I would like :o reserve the balance of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Becker

Very well.

20
ORAL ARGUMENT OP DOUGLAS M, BECKER, ESQ,.
ON BEHALF OP THE RESPONDENT
MR. BECKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and ©ay it please

the Court:
The Court is well aware of what is not afc issue
in this case; the constitutionality of the death penalty
in general and the constitutionality specifically of the
general Texas statutes for adjudication of guilt and im­
position of the death penalty hare previously been upheld.
Therefore, the only issue before us today is fairness in
the jury selection procedures.
•

QUESTION:

i

General Becker* do yon agree with

your opponent that the validity of the conviction is not
in Issue, it is just the death penalty —
MR, BECKER:

Yes, as a constitutional matter,

that is correct, lour Honor.

Now, he has correctly

characterized what Mr. Justice Blaekmun has called a
quirk of Texas law, that we would not be able simply to
reeenten.ee him as far at I know under our procedures.

He

would be entitled to an entirely new trial on guilt or
innocence under Texas law unless the Governor were to act
in the manner that he describes.

He is accurate upon

that point.
Now, I want to make perfectly clear what the
holding that the state of Texas is asking the Court to

21
make today.

It is in essence exactly what the Court of

Criminal Appeals has come out with in the matter and that
is that we hare side by side Witherspoon and section
1231(b) of our penal code, and that jurors who are ex­
cluded upon either basis consistently and accurately
that that would comply with the Constitution.
QUESTION:

The problem with your statement is

that Witherspoon said that jurors could not be excluded
for cause unless they unmistakably make clear that their
disbelief in. capital punishment would prevent them if*
all cases from imposing it, not could be excluded on
either basis, that they could not be excluded constitu­
tionally.

That is what Witherspoon held.

MR. BROKER:

Your Honor,

section 1231(b) is

not aimed at all at excluding jurors solely because they
are against the death penalty,
'basis*

It is neutral upon that

It is aimed as much at excluding jurors who are

in. favor of the death penalty.

It is entirely neutral

with respect to that particular attitude about the death
penalty.

What it is not neutral about is jurors who can

foe biased, in either direction.
Now, before counsel for petitioner made a
statement that if a juror says that he is not unalter­
ably opposed to the death penalty, that he should foe
qualified to sit, period, under Witherspoon. Although

22
that nay be true and was highly applicable to the preFunsan type statutes that gave juries basically unbridled
discretion in the imposition of the death penaltya it
shouldn’t be true any more.

Such a juror might well be

an extremely poor juror for the defendant or for the
state under Texas law because he no longer has unbridled
discretion.
The fact questions that they had in Lockett are
now in Texas at the punishment stage of trial, and really
I don't think it makes any difference at all what the
jurors’ feelings are about the death penalty, either pro
or eon, under the Texas statutes and Texas law.

And cer­

tainly the prosecutor and the judge in this case seem to
be of

the opinion

that it

ms.de very

little difference.

In other words, the common pattern in the voir
dire was to ask the juror what his attitudes were about
the death penalty, and. If the juror said» well, I am
unalterably opposed to she death penalty and 1 could
never vote to impose it, typically in almost every!nstanca there was no objection upon Witherspoon grounds
or that the juror was disqualified for service.
In one case where there was an objection that
he was disqualified, the court said, well, tell him about
our statutory scheme.

The prosecutor would then go on tc

explain, well, even though you could never vote for the

23
death penalty, and I respect that belief, let me explain
the Texas scheme.
It*

There are two distinctive features of

In the first place, we have fact questions at the

guilt or innocence stage of trial, and you will never
actually have to writ® life or* death on a piece of paper.
You will never have to raise your hand and vote that the
defendant lives or the defendant dies*

Instead, you de­

liberate the questions of fact*
How, even though your feelings are very strong
against the death penalty, could you fairly deliberate
the questions of fact knowing that you never have to vote
for death or for life actually directly.

Some jurors

said, well, yes, I could do that, and what the state
submits is that those jurors are qualified to sit on a
Texas jury.

Under Witherspoon, the doctrine of

Witherspoon, they might have been excluded from jury

■ service, and yet 123Kb) saves them for jury service and
•

. V •

we '’don’t think that we need submit statistical studies
to show -hat many of those jurors will be favorably
disposed toward the defendant.
QUESTIONS:

1 suppose you would suggest that

Witherspoon Is beside the point in a sentencing scheme
such as you have and although you purport to be follow­
ing Witherspoon as a parallel track, you really shouldn’t
have to?

2H
MR. BECKER:
White»

That is precisely so, Mr. Justice

It is a round peg In a square hole and It will

lead — what it- will do is. if we followed Witherspoon
and, not section 1231(b)» what we are going to have on
Texas Juries and indeed those Jurors, many of the jurors
that he complains about are people who would have been
perfectly qualified under a pre~Furman unbridled discre­
tion type of statute.

There are people who — he notes

that several of the jurors excluded were in favor of the
death penalty all the way — Mahon, Jenson, Coyle, and
probably McDonald who was rehabilitated Insofar as she
was ultimately in favor of the death penalty.
QUESTION:

Mr. Becker, let me interrupt you.

I had understood from your brief

**- perhaps I didn’t

read it correctly —- that you ifsre conceding that
Witherspoon does apply in Texas In light of the new
statute.
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:
MR, BECKER:
QUESTION;

Your Honor ~~
Your brief says that categorically.
Yea.
Now it seams to Pie you are arguing

something quite different.
MR* BECKER:

Well. I don’t mean to be arguing

something quite different.

Perhaps the confusion comes

in with the phrase ”does Witherspoon apply to Texas.”

25
What I have said is at the outset I think in
those death penalty trials in Texas where Witherspoon was
used is the basis for qualifying that test, that those
convictions and death penalties are all right under the
Constitution,

On page 33 of your brief you state

that the Texas Criminal Court of Appeals has held that
Witherspoon is applicable to capital eases in Texas.
MR. BECKER:

Yes,

MR, BECKER:
QUESTION:

They are under the new statute.
They are under the new statute?

MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Then how can you argue that under

Texas law Witherspoon does not apply?
MR. BECKER:

What the Court of Appeals has

held Is that either a trial conducted In compliance with
Witherspoon or in compliance with 1231(b) comports with
the Constitution.

What we are saying is we agree with

that statement, but that 1231(b) Is a more fair, a more
equitable and a superior way to conduct voir dire Jury
examination in Texas than in Witherspoon.

QUESTION:

But it is our province» is it not» as

opposed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, to have
the final say as to whether a decision of this Court does
or does not apply to a particular factual situation in a
state court,
MR. BECKER:
Your Honor,

Quite so, and the idea is growing,

In our brief,

re

stated that the only ex­

pression in Texas law that we knew of from the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals for the theoretical construct

MR. BECKER:

quiry is quite different.

Witherspoon didn't say what people

could be* but it said what people could not be.
MR. BECKER:

Yes* Your- Honor* but I think the

QUESTION:

Witherspoon doesn’t have anything

to do with that.
MR. BECKER:

Yes, sir. I know.

But I am saying

that 1231(b) itself is a point of inquiry that is suf­
ficiently different from Witherspoon, that It should
stand as an independent basis for exclusion of jurors if
it is properly applied.
Now, on® point that we certainly admit is that
1231(b) is a statute that is susceptible of great abuse.
There is no question about that.

If the juror said,

well, I don’t like the deafer penalty but if it were
really an extreme case I could vote for it, I suppose,
and the prosecutor says 1 can’t exclude this juror because
of unalterable opposition, I will just come right in and
hit her with the next question, a statutory question,
and she sayswell, I suppose I would be affected, then

29

a much mora difficult case is presented,

It is possible

that the prosecutor, by not explaining the meaning

of

the

terms, has suceeded In subverting Witherspoon by using It
in this manner.
QUESTION:

Has anybody, any court .in Texas —«

certainly the legislature has not — has any court in
Texas explained the meaning of the word "affect"?
ME. BECKER:

The Court of Criminal Appeals has

not spoken upon the meaning of the word '’affect'®

And

That will govern the

his trial Is the way the

court and the prosecutor explained the 1231(b) question.
QUESTION:

What is your understanding of the

meaning of the word "affect" in 1231(b)?
ME, BECKER:

Essentially that a juror would be

unbiased on the fact questions and deliberations that are
at tbs punishment phase of the trial,
QUESTION:

You mean "affect1* means impair or

distort?
MR. BECKER:

To be biased in deliberations, to

be unfair -QUESTION:

Well, It is a verb so it means

30
impair or* distort or bias or excuse,
MR, BECKER:

Tea, lour Honor.

It means that —*

in its most extreme fora9 it means that the juror would
lie.

This question was posed over and over again and

many Jurors admitted that they would.

The question was

posed — especially3 I would look at the jurors who were
in favor of the death penalty who were excluded upon the
basis of 1231(b)j Mahon, Jensen and Coyle, to where they
were jurors who said, well, we like the death penalty
and then, when the prosecutor explained the sentencing
scheme, explained the questions, explained the aggravated
and mitigating factors, explained that their deliberating
would be closely guided, the reaction that they got from
those jurors

was

do you maan 1 wouldn't have in effect

free choice, you mean it wouldn’t be completely up to me.
And the prosecutor would say that's right.

In effect, he

might have said that is the way it used to be under
Furman, but the Supreme Court said that that tends to be
arbitrary and capricious and that it is an unfair way to
qualify a jury or an unfair way to inflict the death
penalty upon someone.

We don’t do it that way any more»

Your discretion must be guided,
And then Jurors Mahon and Jensen in the portions
of voir dire cited in our brief say, well, surely if I
were of the opinion, for whatever reason, that the

31
defendant should live or die , there would be one of those
questions that would go the way I wanted it to go3 and
the prosecutor» would ©ay no, not necessarily.

The ques­

tions may lead you to a result that is actually against
the way that in the abstract you feel, apart fro® how you
feel that whatever penalty the defendant should receive,
and then they would reply, well, in that case I don’t
believe I can take the oath.
They said in effect I refuse or I cannot swear
that ’Ey deliberations will be guided in the way the law
says they must be guide!.

There- were jurors who would

have been perfectly qualified under the pre-Furman
statutes but they are disqualified under 1231(b) and we

submit that the defendantJe jury

is more fair for that

result.
QUESTION:

Mr. Becker, I notice you always

Didn’t the defense counsel get into

MR. BECKER:

MR. BECKER:

If he is qualified under Witherspoon?

32

QUESTIOM:

Ye-3.

MR. BECKER:

Tes, Your Honor, he can be quali­

fied under Witherspoon and disqualified under the Texas
statute.

The converse is also true.

He can be disquali­

fied under Witherspoon and qualified under the Texas
statute.

In this ease, precisely that thing happened to

one juror.

He appears in the charts at the conclusion

of our brief and it is a mistake in our charts*
it is the only one that I made.

I hope

He is listed as a juror

excluded, on the basis of Witherspoon or 1231(b) , Mr.
Smotherman.

Actually that is not true.

He was rehabili­

tated in the manner that I described and was excused for
& different reason.
dire

for

that

But the testimony, the way the voir

juror was

conducted to me is a microcosm

of all the arguments that we have and I would like, to take
just one minute t? go over it with the Court.
He stated — he was disqualified under , .
Witherspoon quite clearly at £19-54 of the voir dire.

He

stated he could n-tfver vote to Impose the death penalty
because of his feelings against it.

He personally could
■

!

•

not participate or, as the question was asked, to your
way of thinking, you could never ever, as you presently
feel, could never ever vote for the death penalty*
Answer:

Thatrs right. I don’t believe.

The prosecutor

went on to ask him the statutory questions, which is the

way that all jurors are handled In this voir dire ana he
also agreed that he could not ~~ he had to say that "I
believe I couldn’t answer them all yes if it would send
Mm to his death,"

That is page 49-59»

At that point, Mrs, James, the defense counsel
took over and she rehabilitated him upon the basis of
section 1231(b).

She explained to him Texas law in more

details explained to him and asked him to go over his
feelings and the next twenty pages are a fascinating
study for us*

They show the agony that fch® juror him­

self was going through In deciding this Question. Many
of"those jurors had never thought about the death penalty
before they were placed in the voir dire context, per­
haps this mat! had not.

But as he went through it and

she took him, at page 49-69 and 49-70,

as

it is like a

light dawning in his mind when she asks him — she
explains the procedure and says, ■’! do not, no matter
what, I don’t believe in the death penalty at all, that
is what I want you to understand.*
James:

Question by Mrs.

"You would completely ignore the facts and auto­

matically answer the questions no, regardless of the
facts in any case?”
She says, "Thank you.

He answers., "1 .would not do that.”
Than would there be a feeling in

your mind that you would keep an open mind and you could
taka affirmativa action in answering those questions if

31*
you ever- get them which might result or would result in
the imposition of the da th penalty in the case?

In other

words. could you answer the questions as questions
honestly?1*

BYes, I

think I

believe I could»”

And he was

rehabilitated and the judge stated that he was qualified
.•i

to be on. the Texas jury, in spite of the fact that he
could have been excluded under Witherspoon earlier, and
defense counsel rehabilitated hiss using that statute.
So I think that the statute is available for
the benefit of the defendant also,
QUESTIOH:

Mr» Becker, did that juror serve?

MR. BECKER:

Mo, Your Honor, eventually, he was

excluded for another reason.

QUESTION:

I ask you a.

will not affect his deliberations in any issue of fact.
Suppose the j uror is asked the question in the
language of the statute and the juror responds by saying,
well, since it is a death penalty I know I would scrutin­
ize every witness as closely as I could and I would think
about it a long time before I came to a conclusion, so

the answer Is yea - it would affect jay deliberations.

I have no problems with the voir dire that was conducted,

QUESTION:

Don’t you then have & problem with

the statute as it is written?

You want to redefine the

word “affect” and say, well, it really means something
else.
MR. BECKER: No, Your Honor, I don’t want to
redefine it.

I want to view It in the manner it was de­

fined at this petitioner’s trial.

And as I say, it makes

no difference what the lourt ©f Criminal Appeals said in
some opinion* or ultimately it makes no difference what
you a:id I might agree to*
QUESTION:

The only thing that is critical

under the statute is unless the prospective juror states
under oath* and to say that the Juror Just can’t do that
for the reason that the Juror interprets the word "affect
in the way that most people wuld interpret the word

"effect” —
MR» BECKER:

QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. BECKER:

Actually it starts on 19 and 20.

Page 19 is the explanation of the law and the statute as
1 Just explained them to Mr. Justice Stevens.

Then on

page 20* the very clear explanation by the court:

"You

cannot go back in the jury room and say, well, 7. want
him to get life imprisonment so I am going to answer the
questions no.

You have got to answer the questions the

way the evidence tells you it ought to be answered without
any regard to what punishment would resulto”
And in that contest she answered that she
would be affected.

Now ~~

QUESTION:

Your standing, I take it, on how the

statute was applied in each case in relation to the ques­
tions put oid the answers given.
ME. BECKER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, that is
You really can't escape the proposi­

tion that was put to you that affect might mean something
quite different from what it does in the specific eases
set out here.
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:

That is true, Your Honor.
But we’ve just got this case.
That’s correct.
But you think this necessarily means

that what she is saying, "I will be affected,” and that

39
means to you, because of the form of the question, the
context, that she was saying that she could not say that
she would come to her conclusions based on the evidence?
MR. BECKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

When you read the

voir dire as a whole, you see we are not talking about
some random question just kind of thrown in at some point
that hopefully the juror understood what they were driving
at.
dire.

We are talking about the entire focus of the voir
We are talking about literally pages of explanation

of the statute and everything that I have been talking
about with each venireman, each prospective juror, and
it was unmistakable in my opinion to those jurors that,
regardless of how Mr. Justice Stevens er any Justice
would define the word "affect” or as the Fifth Circuit
did in the Burns case, chat in this ease it was defined
in the manner that I have described to those Jurors.
They couldn't have missed it.
QUESTION:

Just as a point of information, the

language quoted on pages 19 and 20 of your brief, that
is from -- is that in the appendix?
MR. BECKER:

No, Your Honor, it is not.

When­

ever anything in my brief is also in the appendis, I
followed it with an appendix cite, so it is not.
QUESTION:

So we have to look at the original

record to get the whole flavor of this.

MR, BECKER:

Most certainlys and there are many

parts of my brief where the portions we have cited are not
in the appendix and* yes* it will be necessary.
QUESTION:

The original record is here?

HE, BECKER:

Yes, Your Honor* it is.

As a

matter of fact * there are a number of other original
records here irKeasas where petitions for a writ of
certiorari have been filed raising this very question,
this 1231(b) question.

There were five of them filed in

January and those records are here in which the
Witherspoon mid 123Kb) question was raised.
QUESTION:
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:

Why are the records here?
The Court requested them.
Vie called, for the records?
Yes, sir.
In all those cases?
Yes* sir.
And then denied cert or are they

held?
MR. BECKER:

They are pending.

In three of

those five cases where cert is pending* where the records
were requested in January* the defendants, the petitioners
are raising the questions not as petitioner here is but
that ~~ now, as X read, their petitions —- but that jurors
were excluded fro® their trials because of unalterable

opposition to the death penalty, and the 1231(b) inquiry
was not met and the petitioner is complaining because
1231(h) was not invoked, and in my opinion they have a
stronger case than petitioner here today 0

But it rests

for another day, and the case that we have we feel got
him the best jury that was possible.
Mow, the only basis — 1 have explained that
in my opinion 1231(b) is going to create the fairer jury
for the defendant than Witherspoon would.

Why than would

not petitioners in those three cases 1 described now
pending before^ the Court be entitled to relief?

And the

only «answer I can give to that is that even though the
jury examinations in their cases were not as good as
petitioners Adams had, the Constitution even in death
penalty cases does not require perfection and that

.

Witherspoon exclusion, which has been upheld by this
Court is a sufficiently fair method of qualification of
jurors that those convictions too would survive.
One other question that I would attempt to
give come guidance to the Court upon is what affect upon
the statutes of the other states a holding in our favor
in the manner we've advocated today would have.

There are

38 states by my count that now have a death penalty
statute.

Five of those have judge? sentencing.

have death penalty sentencing by jurors

So 33 still

42
The common pattern, as the Court well knows* is
a set of aggravating and mitigating factors.

As far as I

know* no state has affirmatively experienced the Texas
method of not having jurors actually vote on life or
death but merely answering the questions' with known auto­
matic results,
QUESTION:

Ycu say so far as you know* no other

state does it?
MR® BECKER:

That:s correct.

How, the statute

of Washington state appears to allow for that but there
are no cases upon it yet.

It is a new statute.

And there

are other statutes that are ambiguous, but I have- not read
—» I do not read their case law as saying that it *— it
is certainly not as clear at in Texas as far as I can tell.
But tie statutes of all 33 of those states would be quite
amenable to the kind of 123Kb) qualification and rejection
of a Witherspoon typo qualification if they so desired. It
might have that effect.
As I say, if re have made the jump from Furman
to Jureks from the unbridles discretion statute to the
guided discretion statute* it seems to me that the in­
terest of justice and the interest of the defendant will
best be served by having jurors who can swear that they
are going to be fair on. the questions of fact, that they
will be fair in deliberating on the questions of fact,

*3
regar-33-ess of their feelings on the death penalty * and
that that will lead to a jury mors expressive- of the com­
munity conscience than the Jury the petitioner contends
he ought to have had at his trial,
Thank you,
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further* Mr. Bruder?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELVYN CARSON BRUDER, ESQ. ,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR» BRUDER:

Just briefly.

It seems a shame to

me somehow that if both Witherspoon and 1231(b) parallel
each other, and the state contends 1231(b) is fairer arid
the? defendent contends that Witherspoon is fairer„ that
we can’t provide for an election prior to trial and let
the chips fall where they may basod on that election.
3: think it is fair to say that this petitioner
does not agree with the state that 1231(b) is in any

sense of the word fair.
There are two cases that I want to particularly
point out to the Court.

Counsel talks about we have this

word ’affect” but we don’t want to define it* we' simply
want to throw it out there for the jury to consider, tell
them the entire process* and then on that basis let them
decide what they think it means* and that 1231(b) is fair
because of that

Yet5 in Hovila I, 532 S*W, 2d 294, former
Presiding Judge Morrison said that the court will presume
that a juror’s answers will be affected»

The punishment

answers will always be affected by the existence of a
mandatory penalty of Ilf© or death*
QUESTION:

Would your problem be cured* Mr,

Bruder, if the judge on his own had instructed the jury
that when I describe the statute to you* using the word
"affect** what is meant by that is that the possibility
of the death penalty will not lead m© to vote not guilty
in a case which I might otherwise vote guilty*

would

that take care of it?
MR. BRUDER:
QUESTION:

Are you talking —
You are defining "affect” at least

as the judge —
KR« BRUDER:

You are talking guilt-innocence?

You are talking about the guilt-innocence phase as op­
posed to punishment»
QUESTION:
MR. BRUDER:

Yea.
I think that would — that may

satisfy the second part of the Witherspoon standard on
/

guilt-'innocence* and I think a question could be formu­
lated to follow up on 1231(b) that would satisfy the
Witherspoon standard*
QUESTION:

Mow, if the Court decided that the

questions and the answers taken together* showed that each
of the furore questioned understood that meaning of the
word *affect* —■
MR* BRUDER:

But we are talking about such a

subjective problem that I can’t see how the court can do
that.

1 think it would be difficult.
QUESTION:

X don’t know if It could either, but

suppose the court did

is the court free to make this

evaluation on the basis of how tha Juror answered the
question?
MR* BRUDER:
tainly*

The court is free to do it, cer­

I think the court would have difficulty squaring

that type of a rule with Witherspoon as well as inviting
a very tremendous caseload end an increase in Its docket
because every death penalty case from Texas would then
become a case that is automatically reviewable by this
Court on the basis of 1231(b) versus Witherspoon viola­
tions.
QUESTION:

What you are saying is that we

should go with you and force the state of Tes:as to amend
its statute?
MR. 33RUDER:

Amend its statute or, Your Honor,

construe the statute which! suspect Is coming right
around the corner.

And the other case that I wanted to

bring to your attention is Russell v. State, to which

46
counsel alluded.

The number is 63-715.

on March 12, 1980.

it was delivered

And in the dissenting opinion to

which counsel alluded, he left off a phrase that I want
to direct to the Court5s attention.

Judge Clinton said,

"Witherspoon, is no longer a viable measure of qualifying
jurors in the bifurcated proceedings cf the capital case
in that they do not directly assess punishment and that
a good deal more manifestation than merely acknowledging
the magic phrase of 1231(b) should be required for dis­
qualification.

The record must be made clear- that the

Juror understands the word * affect * to be a synonym for
bias for predisposition to vote in a certain way, and
then 1231(b) satisfies the Witherspoon standard and,
regardless of whether you call it 1231(b) or the TexasWitherspoon procedure, it is constitutional."
QUESTION:
ME. BRUDER:

When was 1231(b) enacted?
I believe it was enacted as a

different penal code article shortly after the Furman
decision and readopted in the 1974 penal code.

I think

it was Article 6?3.
QUESTION:

So it was reconsidered and roadopted,

most recently enacted after the establishment in Texas of
the legislative system that was approved in the Jurek
case.
MR. BRUDER:

Well, it was enacted along with —

QUESTION:

It is part and parcel of the Jurek

legislation?
MR* BRUOER:
QUESTI0:1:

Right*
It is not an historical survival from

an earlier day*
MR., BRUDER:

It is not*

It is part and parcel

cf the Jurek system.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
