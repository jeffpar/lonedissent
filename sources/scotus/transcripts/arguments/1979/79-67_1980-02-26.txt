PROCE -EDI N G S
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Walter v. the Uni.ted States and
consolidated case Sanders v. the United StatesMr. Sell, you may proceed whenever you are. ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN ZELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MRo 3ELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
This is a certiorari from the Fifth Circuit Court
of Appeals involving a conviction of the two Petitioners, and
two corporations for distribution of obscene materials in
interstate commerce.
The issues that I will argue this morning involve
search and seizures.

To outline the facts vary quickly, the

FBI was called to Leggs Company? it is a stocking manufacturer.
They had received several bosses of films misdirected he them
by Greyhound fees terminal..

Upon opening the bosses by the;

Leggs Company they discovered they were not. stockings but
films,-, 371 ar.d 25 different

.specific kind.3 of films.

They called the FBI, the FBI came out; Mr. MaadyoJc ,
1 think his name is, told then to hold it for him and he came
snti

■

'

the FBI office.
Thereafter, two months later he viewed them i:. the

office.

Approximately two years from the initial scicure the

Petitioners went to'trial.

No notification either publication

or directly was given to Petitioners, no warrant was ever
gotten, and of course during the trial the District Court
overruled the motion to suppress based on several grounds.
The jury found the films obscene, found the Petitioners
guilty, appealed to the Fifth Circuit and there was a strong
dissent by Judea TTisdoia which laid out our issues very
clearly and succinctly; and thereafter

we filed a certiorari

tc this Court.
QUESTION:

When did your clients first learn that

the FBI had taken possession of the film?
MS, ZELL;

Well, Your Honor, in the transcripts

it appears that there was some information conveyed 'by one
of the employees of Mr. Grassi to Mr. Sanders about a month
or several days or several weeks after the initial seizure, or
after the FBI seized them, just from hearsay.
they heard that was turned over to the FBI.

And he said
But they weren’t

sure, there is no date in the record and it was not verified
or he didn’t know where to go, what to do, and he turned it
over to his lawyer, which of course was ma.
QUESTION:

Did your client ask for' the return of

MS, ZELL;

No, he did not.

the films?

they were.

Wo did not know where

Mr. waiter testified he didn’t know where they

6

were himself. he

is never sure, he war:: never directly toll;

Mr. Sanders was just told in hearsay that the FBI might nave
had them.

We'never heard anything from the FBI until of
/

coarse the in.dictu.ent. When the grand jury met, we were
notified.
And that time of course we filed a notion to return
s'/•’ **

the property.
QUESTION:

I take it there is no issue as to the

obscene character of some of the films?
MR. LULL:

Well, I can see an a. trial attorney that

it is a factual disposition to the jury.

we litigated the

case, we presented several expert witnesses ani the jury after
being out over a day found against us on that issue, apparenti
So we. did not raise the issue of obscenity in this case? not

that we conceded or agreed with the jury verdict cut. we
argued it and fought it.

It was a factual determination,.

-And 1 -think that rests-that issue in this particular case as
far as it goes.
QUESTION:

Your client’s shipment was a not» de

of thing, wasn’t it, or. not the client
name as sender anc the consignee was not a. real parson.
MR. ZELL:
"■.•/ill cell. ;

That is. correct.

On the box it said

The

reason for this is not that they were giving up their right
of privacy as the Fifth Circuit alleged or argued end the

7
District Court found was in the testimony in the record from
Walters and Sanders that they had repeated shipments Lein-;
stolen and missing,

Apparently whenever the Greyhound bus

terminal man' seized the name of the sender or gets used to
it where it is going at a certain terminal warehouse it
apparently is broken into and the shipment is taken or parts
are taken out of it.
1 might point out in U.s* v. Kelly it was the same
problem.

1 think his last seven shipments had bean missing

or jsisdicracfced.

Apparently the workers, the employees at

these common carriers get used to what the shipments are about
and 1 guess they decide to just pilfer them.

So

>e cau.ce

f

that problem we did not put the name of the sender or who
would pick it up, because we felt the employees would find
out about it, the common carrier.

'And that has fooen dene on

a regular basis? it has been dons before, with no problem.
Many people travel, movie stars, under assumed names, rot that
they give up their right of privacy but because they want
privacy.

And that is the reason why if. was done.

QUESTION s

Yes,

And that is true whether it is a

thief who takes them or whether it was the Leggs ~~ that is
Leggs, the stocking company.
MR, ZELL:

That is correct.

And I would still argue that they had no right to
keep them.

They either should have published by publication

or technically notified the sender or the shipper.

It could

be easily fount

out because the record shows people case by

to ask for iht

"Where was it?”

"Can . « pick it up'?“

you have got 8 71 films,and the FBI just sitting- on them,
involving 25 different prints. As a matter of fact in the

QUESTION:
r

You made a pointed distinction between
shotguns-.

A good many people

think the Constitution gives presumptive cornstitutional

14
protection to bear arsis.
Is that not so?
JO. SELL?

That is frivolous, that argument.

I

think this Court has already decided that by protecting the
militia.

I think it was Miller v. United States you have

already allowed gun lavra an

statutes to regulate different

types of weapons so 1 find that argument analagous and ale>
it has been decided by this Court vsry cl.sarly that arms
can be regulated by the State and Federal Governments.
QUESTION:

In other words, in each case it is a

presumptive protection but a presumption that can be overcome?
ME* ZELL:

Yes.

In particular when you have the

First Amendmanl: in suppressing materials.

And particularly

where they entirely suppress completely.
QUESTION:

You make that higher than to bear arms?

HR* CELL:

Well, it is the First Amendment.

But, no, I think in a free society ideas,
eoi .muni cat ion i • f r.ndamental, so fundamental.

And the right

to bear arms involves the militia and l don't

I fed it

Thc.ro is no

Clearly as in the Haes cone we cite:

no brief, I think it was in the Eighth Circuit.

They held

to view the* films was a search and clearly the FBI could have
gotten a.warrant at that point.
And then of course we analogiae, this to the
*
Arkansas v, Sanders and Chadwick v. United States — luggage,
boxes, compartments.

Here is a compartment, 871 of theta.

There is probable cause that they may be obscene.

wouldn't they require a warrant as you did in Ohadwitefc and

the Court;
What I would like .to do at this time is fee address
a couple of; points- which I believes should be brought to the
CourtfEs -attention involving what I ascertain to be miss.t.afco.tisnts b£ fact oont'aiaed in the Government * s brief.

And

©a© ih particular I think is. incredibly significant, found

e
on p&q® 37 and thereafter, wherein it is indicated that the
Petitioners in this ease had decided to return the films to
a w^ceh'P'u-se for. storage*

la; fact there is nothing in -cfc©

It could v: ill have bean that, 'the purpose

of that transport-at ion was in fact to rail these ©articular

films in Atlanta which as X uaferniasJ fe~-s tho U:i. jhest per

T here are two other points that X vcu3.fi life a to
bring to the Court "a. attention-

They relate to the filate

fehemeelvae which are 8-millimeter film that are so small that
they cannot he viewed by the naked eye.

There is; apparent

representation to the effect that people at Leggs Products, Inc*
had already ascertained what it. was that was cn these films
when in fact all they had ascertained was the nature of the
boss cover which contained a depiction in cartoon fashion of
two nude males from the Waist up embracing and kissing ane
a description purporting to represent but not necessarily
ate war it wee that was contained in the fil >3,
Obviously the FBI did not believe that this was necessarily
what mis contained in the films because that was the very
reason they screened them, was to find out what it was that
was contained ca these films.
QUE8VI0»!

Was the description prepared by your

clients a kind of cover for the films?
MR. MAYCOCKs

As it turned out, Your Honor, the

films were pretty much as described in the blurb contained
o'a' the bos covers.

The box covers incidentally ware not

charged as being obscene$ only the. films'themselves which
were later screened about two months subsequent to the time
that they wore initially taken .by• the FBI,

What X would like to do is to address rather

First of all I would address the Court’s attention
to the scienter issue.

There was clearly ample proof

provided that my client Mr. Walter was engaged in a business

suggest to this

However, X wold

Court that in accordance with the.dictates

of Hamling and Smith that there has to be soma proof of
knowledge showing that in fact he had information of the
nature, character and content of fch® particular films, that
ha knew they were being shipped interstate and that he knew
that a common carrier was being used, for that purpose.
There is nothing other than a silent record to
indicate that ir* Walter war involve d in this operation from
a point in tim© two months prior to this shipment to
two mouths subsequent to it*

. tim®

The government he3 argued tL-.-.t

there was evidence shewing that he participated directly-in
the day-to-day affairs of this particular business.

However,

there is no evidence showing that aryy of these otiar shipment©
purportedly made interstat® involved obscene material*

&iu:.

as this Court well knows, Ro&fisn v. iSentucky requires the
presumption to h® mad® that material sot adjudicated tc be
obscene is to be presumed not obscene.

unr afae©nabl-e gov®rnmenta 1 i|tmttion.

a■

recurrent them®

of pur,Fourth Amendment analysis in this ease is 'that
Petitioners Walter and Sanders did not have an expectation, of
privacy protected by 'the Fourth -Amendment with respect to the
packages of films.

Whet actually occurred hers was that

Petitioner's used the common carrier to ship a large quantity

30

of pornographic filass across State lines using fictitious
aaaes for both the shipper• end the consignee aaf giving a tala
address for the shipper and no address for

'.risk' that one® Lagga inspected the contents 'of the pack
they would contact law enforcement authorities and.on their
own 'initiative turn the shipment over to the Government for
possible prosecution»:'

The fact that Petitioners may have

obtained a property interest in those goods does not affect
the Fourth Amendment analysis in this particular case because
we submit .they had no legitimate expectation of -privacy with
respect
to the films
V
Now, it may, be that if Petitioners had chosen to
possess these films at home and to use them they would be
protected.

QUESTION:

Mr. Schulder* could I ask you about,

the argument there there is no expectation of privacy.
1 understand it you make two separate arguments on that

point.

One is because of the manner the 'packages were

labeled there was never any expectation.

They waived their

right because it was very probable that some third party
«

would get access to them.

Now.

if that is true it doesn't

matter whether they are guns or personal business records,
anything like that.

Somebody just sends a package to a

fictitious person in a way that there is a fair chance it
will get lost and gives up all Fourth Amendment interest in
it.
Do you have any authority for that proposition?
That is a rather extreme position.

Your second theory*, which - is guite

different, is that the re was sufficient indicia of what the

a briefcase in which he said on the outside c f. it;

"Sect rds

E," who had previously denied they ever had a Swiss bank
account, you could open that without a warrant?

Because by

outside of it you know the contents had something illegal in
it, or you wc aid have probable cause to - believe they had.
MR» SCHOLDER;

Justice White's question I ara not sure that probable cause
is really the ~~
QUESTION-j

That is correct.

What 1 waul& suggest is that what we have here isa clear situation involving a prior restraint where the
burden is attempted to be placed upon the Petitioners to
demand property of which they have been dispossessed and. tha
all notions o.f procedural due process would indicate that
that was inappropriate under these circumstances.
