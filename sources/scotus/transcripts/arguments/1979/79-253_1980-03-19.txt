ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER» ESQ0
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR* SELLER*

Thank you» Mr* Chief Justice» and. may

it please the Courts
This case is here on direct appeal from the District
Court her© in the District of Columbia because a single judge
of that court hue declared unconstitutional and enjoined the
Secretary of Labor from enforcing the civil penalty provisions
of the child labor statuta*
Specifically» Judge Gasch found that the due process
clause of the Fifth toendssent is violated by the lasts sentence
■of section 16(a) 'of thi child labor statute which providas
that the ©urns collected by the Secretary as civil penalties
may be applied towards reimbursement of the costs of determining
chi.id labor violations*
The facts in this case may be briefly stated*
Appellee runs a chain of restaurants in -the «Southeastern
United States*

In 1969 ©ad 1973 and again in 1974 the

Department of Labor compliance officers found that appellee

4
had employed a number of busboys and waitresses in violation
of the Federal child labor latos„
When two more such instances came to light in March
1975, the Department ordered an investigation into the hiring
practices in all of appelleecs restaurants.

And thereafter

the Assistant Regional Administrator of the Employment
Standards Administrationf which is the part of the Department
of Labor that, enforces the child labor laws, cited appellee
for 169 separate child labor violations and assessed a civil
penalty of $103/000»

sum represented a penalty of

$300 each for unlawfully employing seven persons lander the
age of 14 plus a penalty of $100 -each for unlawfully employing
.162 persons under the age of 16,
•In addition, tha Regional Administrator assessed
a penalty of $300 for each of the 169 children or a total
of $84,500, because he believed that the history of child
labor violations in appellee * a . restaurants, stretching back
to 1969, showed -that appellee had been aware of the child
labor violations but had dona nothing'to correct them.
Mow, appellee riled an exception to this citation
■and aftbr a hearing the Administrative Law Judge found that
the existence of 'the trial labor" violations was clearly
established but he disagreed with tha Assistunt Regional
Administrator ‘on whether these violations ware willful»

The

Administrative Law Judge therefore struck tha

5
$34,500 assessment and reduced the civil penalty to $jL8,5G0*
Nov?, appellee did not. seek judicial review of
this decision®

Instead several months later it began the

lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that section 16(e)
is unconstitutional and injunction prohibiting its enforce­
ment*

V
QUESTIONS

Is there any reason why ha couldn't have

raised that at an earlier stage within the framework of this
cane?
MR, GELLERs

Appellee could;, we believe, sought

judicial review cf the Administrative Law Judge's assessment
of the $18,500 and raised this constitutional objection as
well as any ether objections he had®
QUESTION*

Without having raised it before the

Administrative Law Judge?
Mil® GELLERs

It was raised ~~ I don't believe it

was raised before the Judicial Lav? Judge, although the
Administrative Law Judge could not have given relief on that
ground*

So I am not sure that that precludes raising ifco
QUESTIONS

The first time he could have raised it

would have been on review in an Article 3 court*
MR* GELLERs

Well, he could have raised it earlier

but 1 think the first time he could have had it — it could
have had any expectation of relief was in an Article 3 court*
That is right

6
Now# as I' mentioned a moment ago, the District
Court agreed with appellee’s contentions? relying on a line
of cases beginning with Turney v, Ohio# Judge Gasch held
that the reimbursement provision of section 16(e), and I
quotes ".»« creates a situation in which bias may creep into
the decisions, of the regional office officials who impose
civil penalties and that tha statute is therefore invalid
under the due process clause*£I
Now# it is tha Government's position that this
t

injunction entered by the. District. Court is erroneous for
three separate reasons*
First# we submit that the due process standard*?
established In casas such" as Turney and Ward v. Village c::
■i

1

Monroeville are applicable with full force only to officials
exercising judicial or quasi»»judicial functions*
Second, oven assuming that 'those standards c:o
apply to the situation in this case# we contend that the

court. hQ'loif erred, dn concluding that the 'child labor civil
penalty echea» creates a significant risk of personal or
"institutional bias*
And finally# even if tha reimbursement provisis,»
of section 16(a) does violata due process, the court below
should have enjoined only the enforcement of that provision#
it should have left the remainder of the civil penalty
statute in force*

7
Acceptance of any of these three arguments would
require reversal of the judgment below»
1 would like to turn first to our broadest

contention whi*2h is that the principles recognized in cases
such as Turkey and Ward are inapplicable here because the
Assistent Regional Administrator in citing an employer for
a. violation of the child labor laws and assessing a proposed
penalty is acting as a plaintiff for a prosecator and not
as a judge»

The basic notion that underlies Turney and Ward

is that a litigant is entitled to have his case adjudicated
by someone who is free of any substantial likelihood of
personal or institutional bias»

The Court in those cases-

struck down statutory schemes that in the Court's words
"offered a possible temptation to the average raan as judge
to forget the burden of proof required to convict a
defendant or which might lead him not to hold the, balance
nice, clear and true between a State end the accused»"

Now, we certainly have no quarrel with these
principles but they cannot be easily transferred, we think,
to situations such as this one involving governmental
officials exercising prosecutive rather than adjudicative
functions«
QUESTION*

Mr® Geller, let us assume a mine run

prosecutor, jvat an ordinary prosecutor, and let's say that

8
his compensation depended entirely upon the fines assessed
against people he was able to get a court to convict»
Would there ba any constitutional problem there?

I

don't know of any case»
MR, GELLERs

Well* there is a case in fact, because

Turney v, Ohio# there was no aspect of Turney which involved
that and was not challenged by anyone»

In fact this Court

had language in its opinion which I hope to quote to the
Court which' said that that would be all right,
X don*t see any due process problem there.

It

might fee an unwise piece of legislation but defendant is
entitled as a matter 'of due process to a fair and impartial
judge*

X don' t knew of any case that holds *-•*» or any

decision of this Court., certainly, that holds that as a
matter of due process ho is entitled to a neutral and impartial
prosecutor,
QUESTIONS

Well, we have «■ great deal of

prosecutorial discretion, as you know •*>*»
MR, SELLER;

QUESTION?

That is right,
«**«• in cur system but if that discretion

were distorted by an economic motive, one wonders,
MR» CELLSR3

I think that in light of 'die traditional

deference which courts have given to decisions by the Executive
of who to prosecute and what to prosecute for that there
would not a prophylactic or pro se rule such as -the Court.

9
imposed on judges in cases»

I think it would be up to an

individual defendant if ha wanted to get the charges against
him dismissed to show that his particular prosecution was
somehow motivated by some improper or invidious reason.
Appellee has never mad© that charge in this case.
QUESTION$

In this case could any individual

anywhere in the chain of command in the Labor Department
have profited personally?
MR. GELLER:

No* there is absolutely no evidence

of any personal problem.
QUESTION*

This apparently is a means of getting

some funds without having them appropriated by Congress
directly.
Is that the case?
MR. (SELLER}

Well» one of the unfortunate aspects

of this case is that there is nothing in the legislative
history to explain why--the reimbursement provision worked
its way Into the statute but I think that, that is a very
reasonable speculation? that is correct.

We are not dealing

with very large sums of money here, as I intend to get to
in a moment, in terms of ESA-* the Employment Standards
Administrations total budget.

.But I think that you are

right, Mr. Chief Justice* that in part it was a desire by
Congress to piece some of the costs of investigating
prosecuting child labor violations on the perpetrators of

10
those violations»
Nowe in otar view, the appropriate standard of
judicial review should be different when scrutinising factors
that arguably influence the institution rather than the
adjudication of civil or criminal proceedings»

And as I

say. I think that is attributable to the traditional
judicial deference to prosecutorial discretion in bringing
cases»

In fact the Court recognised this crucial distinction

in the Turney case itself, because Turney involved an Ohio
liquor control ordinance which provided that the town mayor
who sat as a judge in prosecutions under the ordinance would
receive fees in addition to his salary if ha convicted the
defendant but not if he acquitted the defendant,»

And the

Court found this provision to be unconstitutional»
There is another part of the very same ordinance
that was: involved ih Turney which provided that 50 percent
of the fines' collected war© to be placed in a.' so-called
secret*, service fund for the purpose of enforcing prohibition
laws»

And the ordinando specifically -provided that 50

percent of any fine was to go to the deputy marshals, 10
percent el th& fine was to go to the prosecutor 'and 15 percent
was tc go to the5 town detectives as- compensation for their
services in*enforcing the liquor laws»

And no One challenged

the legitimacy of these' latter provisions of the ordinance
in* Turn-ay, involving law- 'enforcement officers rather than

11
adjudicative officers.

In fact the Court expressly stated

at the end of its opinion that in contrast to the situation
with judges the legislature, and I quotes

” ... may and

often ought to stimulate prosecutions for crime by offering
to those who shall initiate and carry on such prosecutions
rewards for thus acting in the interest of the State and the
people*Ci
We -think this proposition should govern the ca;?e
here.
Appellee*s answer to tills argument is essentially
to assert that ESA Assistant Regional Administrators function
much .’tike judges but there is simply nothing in the child
labor statute or the accompanying regulations to support
that assertion.

Regional Administrators' don’ t preside over

hearings or make findings of fact based upon evidence
presented in an adversary context.

In issuing a notice of

violation or assessing -a proposed penalty they act just like
an Assistant United States Attorney in determining what
charges to bring or What relief to seek, as in a civil
complaint.
Most importantly, perhaps-, if 'the employer disagrees
with the Assistant Regional Administrator*s determination,
either that there is a violation or what the penalty should
he, it may seek review and it. is entitled to cle novo review
before the Administrative Law .Judge who is -unquestionably

12
neutral»

And the Administrative Law Judge's ruling is then

■r

subject to judicial review in an Article 3 court.
It is clear then that an Assistant Regional
Administrator in imposing a child labor violation, assessing
a proposed penalty does not act as a judge and that the
standards developed in Turney and Ward for assuring the
neutrality of judges do not apply.
Our system contains a number of incentives, both
direct and indirect, to motivate
to do their job diligently.

Executive branch officials

Section 16(e) is on® such

incentive, because it stimulates child labor enforcement
which Congress prior to the 1974 Amendments thought was an
area that, had been sorely neglected.

We submit that Congress'

efforts to achieve this beneficial result and, as I said., to
\

impose some of the costs of ferreting out child labor
violations on those who perpetrate the violations is not
inconsistent with any notions of fundamental fairness embodied
in the due process clause.
Now, if the Court disagrees with this contention
and holds that the Assistant Regional Administrator's
assessment of civil penalties for child labor violations
is subject to the due process standards of Turney and Ward,
we believe that the judgment below must still be reversed
because any possibility of bias resulting from the reimburse­
ment provision is wholly insubstantial and remote.

13
This Court stated In Turney and, indeed, Judge Gasch
acknowledged that due process does not prohibit the exercise
even of judicial power when the judicial officer’s personal
interest is so remote, trifling or insignificant that it
may fairly be supposed to be incapable of affecting his
judgment*
And that describes the situation in this case*
First, as 1 said in response to the Chief Justice’s question,
unlike in Burney, here no Labor Department official stands
to benefit even by one dollar, personally, from any civil
penalty assessment„
QUESTION;

Well, maybe not personally but it can

get into the Regional Office in a way, can't, it?
MR* (SELLER s

It can but that is dependent upon

a number of other things happening over which the Assistant
Regional Administrator has no control*

The case is in

some way similar to Ward, I assume, because in Ward the
mayor there- also had no personal interest in the fines but
•th« fines would go into thetown treasury and the mayor was
dependent upon the revenues in -the town treasury»

But

here **•"*
QUESTIONs

This whole argument is based on the

assumption that -fch©' Administrator is (she decision-maker?
MR* (SELLER:

1 -think that’s right»

I don’t think

fefaa Court has to reach this portion of our argument if it

14
agrees with us in our initial assertion which is that
the District Court erred in relying on cases like Turney
and Ward»
But if Turney and Ward are applicable, we still think
that the judgment should be reversed because the interest
here is so insignificant that it couldn’t possibly have
affected the decision-making of the Assistant Regional
Administrator*

.Unlike in Ward where the moneys'went right

to the town treasury, here all of the moneys go to ESA’s
national office which may or may not decide to distribute
the money back to the regional officials»

It doesn’t have

to»
And the statute is clear that even when ESA’s
national office decides to distribute the money to the
regional officials it does it on the basis of costs actually
incurred by the regional officials and not the penalties that
are assessed,
QUESTIONS

Nevertheless you are spacing of fairly

large a uses 6
MR* GElLEEs

Well, 1 don't think we ar© talking

of fairly large' sues in comparison to ESA’s total budget*
la Turney and Ward the amounts that were involved represented
almost half -of -the town's budget,- it was quite substantial,
Aiid there was direct ©vldenca in each of those cases that
the mayor was quite concerned about the possible loss of

IS
that revenue source.
Now* here by contrast the evidence shows that the
sums collected in civil penalties represent less than one
percent of ESA!3 total budget and that far from being
fiscally dependent on these moneys ESA in each of 'the years
since this- reimbursement provision was enacted has turned
back to the Treasury as 'unused funds an amount far greater
than was even collected as civil penalties.
So it is quite difficult to imagine how any
Assistant Regional Administrator would be influenced to even
the slightest extant by the possibility that some of the
moneys collected as civil penalties for child labor violations
might be returned to his office at some later point.
We set forth at soma length in our brief 'the sarias
of increasingly improbable assumptions that the Court would
have tc indulge in in order to . conclude that there is any
real possibility of prejudice from ‘the reimbursemsnt scheme*
QUESTIONS

What happens if the Washington office

notifies all the regional offices -that you haven’t reported
any money in the last year and we need money?
MR. CULLERi

1 assume that would be «« X don’t

knew that any such communication would go out.

X think it

would bs a proper communication for the national office to
say to "the Atlanta Regional Office e t5You have uncovered X
percent of the total Nation*3*

c

16
QUESTIONs

No.

"Everybody else has uncovered it

but you»53
MR® GELLERs
communication.

1

I think -that would be a proper

think that these regional offices ««

QUESTION;

Wouldn't that sort of bend somebody's

arm?

MR® GELLERs

No, because —>

QUESTION i . I -am not saying I a® sura this wouldn't
happen .

MR. GELLERs

Well* I am sure it wouldn' t happen?

but even ii: it did? it wouldn't have the influence that Judge
Gasch attributed to it because the amounts that the Assistant
Regional Administrators assess are really irrelevant.

It

is the amounts that are collected and anyone who challenges
the assessment gets do novo review before the Administrative
Law Judge who can reduce "the amount of the penalty to zero
or any figure between zero .and the amount initially assessed*
Now, I would like to turn briefly in the few
minutas remaining to an issue that the Court need not reach
unless it agrees with Judge 'Gasfoh that the reimbursement
provision? section 16 (aj renders the civil penalty statuta
unconstitutional.

That is the' cuesti'cn of proper remedy «

The District Court struck down the entire civil penalty
statute.

It As our position that 'that remedy is over­

broad and totally unwarranted? that 'at most the District

17
Court should have severed the last sentence of section 16(a)
providing for the reimbursement of civil penalty funds that
are actually collected*
The question of severance of course is essentially
one of legislative intents

In this case there is strong-

'

proof that .Congress would have wanted to have a civil penalty
statute without any reimbursement provision rather than have
no civil penalty remedy for trial labor violation at all»
First the statute contains & broad severability
clause*
And second, the legislative history of section
>

16(e.) shows that Congress* overriding concern was to provide
the Department of Labor with a new tool to strengthen trial
i

labor enforcement because the injunctive and criminal
provisions of the trial law ware found to be totally
%

ineffective*

This congressional objective would obviously

ba frustrated if the entire civil penalty; statute ware
struck down*
The last and best piece of evidence perhaps that
Ccr.gr as:* would have wanted the reimbursement provision severed
if it war® found

unconstitutional is that in a number of

similar civil -penalty1 statutes Congress has provided that the
funds collected as civil penalty shall go into the United
States Treasury.

And that is the result that would occur

here if the last sen-tens®’ of section 16(e) were severed from

18
the rest of the statute»
So for all these reasons we believe that the
District Court erred in declaring the civil penalty statute
wilder the child labor laws unconstitutional and in enjoining
its enforcement and wa believe that the judgment below should
b© reversed»
Thank you»
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr, (Seller„

Mr* Power*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS W. POWER, ESQ*,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR® POWER:

Mr. Chief Justice,and may it pleases the

Courts
Our differences with -the arguments of the Solicitor
General can b© 3u?mariss®d ia, I believe, four very brief
statements«
First, the most significant issue hare, in our
judgment, is not actual bias but rather, and far more
-importantly, the potential for bias mid the appearance of
bias*

It does not matter how much money was actually

collected or how much money was distributed to a given
regional office*

She potential is here for these moneys

to be used to increase salaries and to substantially increase
tbs appropriation of the -various offices involved*
Secondly, the Administrator and hi® assistant.

19
acting under section 16(e)t are judges under the clear
statutory language under section 16(e)»

And. they cannot be

likened to prosecutors .
Third» potential for bias and actual bias under
section 16(e) is very substantial and not reKiote.
And finally, severance of the reimbursement
provisions will not cure the potential for bias or the appear­
ance of bias»
QUESTION;

Mr. Powers, don't you concede that there

is a good deal of attenuation here?
'

MR. POWER;
QUESTIONi

1 &m sorry —
Don't you concede that there is a good

deal of attenuation here between what in fact happens and
what might be a genuinely undesirable and perhaps
unconstdtutional situation?
MR. POWER;

Well, Your Honor» I think that, what in

fact actually happened was an unconstitutional situation
and in fact you had actual bias in this particular case.
But nevertheless I see the potential as the far greater civil
inherent in this particular section 16(e) of the Pair Labor
Standards Act» which is entirely unique in any civil money
penalty section not only in the United States but, to the
best of ray knowledge, in the country.

X cannot find anything

anywhere near like this in any statute»
QUESTION;

Well, admittedly it is unique but an

20
entire aeries of steps would have to occur before the actual
bias could be reached, wouldn’t it?
MR» POWERS

Well, the statute provides for

example, Your Honor, that the funds shall be used to reiraburse the assessor of ‘the fines.

And those funds go directly

to the salary and expense budget of the various offices
involved»
QUESTIONS

But the particular individuals aren't

going to get more money because they levy more fines.
MR, POWERS

I think that 'that is entirely possible,
i

if not likely.

If you read the statutory language that is

precisely what is provided,

X think that is discretionary

with the Secretary of Labor and —QUESTIONs
MR. POWER*

Yen mean they will get a raise in pay?
I think that is entirely possible.

X think it is discretionary to the Secretary of Labor to give
thorn that money.

Why not?

The Act providas that they will

•gat the money and that it shall be used in the discretion
of the Secretary of Labor to reimburse them for their ordinary
expenses.

It further provides that the funds may foe used

notwithstanding any other provision of the law to hire
individuals outside of the United States Government to
effectuate the purposes of this Act.
Moreover, the funds can be quite sabstantisi as
related to an individual office of the assessment.

And

21
frankly, I see no prohibition in the statutory language

from the funds going directly to the so-called Administrative
Law Judge®

That is an office of the Department of Labor®

tod although it is argued by the Solicitor General that we
are entitled to a fair and impartial judgment, at that level
we do not see it®

Because we think that the ALJ or 'the

Administrative Law Judge rightly under the statute not only
could haw but -die Secretary of Labor was required and
mandated under the statute to reimburse the Administrative
Law Judge for his expenses as well®
How, 1 don't think he aver got around to it, because
we raised the issue sight at the outset at the administrative
level and 1 guess this was really the first case that cane
up on these civil money penalties.

This was adopted in 1974

and regulations were issued more like '7S and this was the
first case really to come before the Administrative Law
Judge®

And fee never really did any work that would gain

him the share of the split on the moneys that have been
raised earlier®

But the statute provides that he shall

receive the’ funds that he got, he is responsible for data main""
ing the funds, he is part of the process and he should have
got a proportionate share,
’

QUESTION'S

Are you suggesting that the Secretary

exercising this, discretion could provide that annually hs:
would give awards ©£ $1,000 each to every Administrative Law

22

Judge that sustained a fine?
MR. POWER?

Pardon sue, Mr» Chief Justice»

Did you

say Ci could"1 or he Mwould"?
QUESTZON:

MR. POWER?

Yes* I think ha clearly could»

And

there is nothing in the statutory language to prevent bin.
And the statutory language says "notwithstanding any other

law that would prohibit that kind of action from him» I
don't see why not»

I know mysjslf^ X was working

It comeg from a very unique provision in the law
where the Department of Labor has a division that gathers
statistics called the Bureau of Labor Statistics, I believe,
and -under that' provision of the law it is permissible for
the Secretary of -Labor to have outside sources fund
statistical research work.

In other words, while they are

conducting one survey they might pick up a certain amount
of money from

'a

they are more efficient at gathering and can do more

MR. POWERS

That 1 understand, Mr. Chief Justice.

Again, on the question of the actual right to
appeal to Administrative Law Judge# the argument being muds
that the Administrator or the Assistant Regional Administrator
can be likened to a prosecutor rather than to a judge, we
disagree with his contention.
First, the argument is made that .'we "are entitled
to de novo review by the Administrative Law Judge.

We do not

believe the statutory language permits -the Administrative» Law
Judge to give us a judicial review or 'a de novo review.
The language of the statute permits a party who has been
assessed a fine, an employer assessed a fine with a right
to a hearing only under vary limited conditions# expressly
limited to an objection by the employer to the determination
that the violations actually occurred.

3c, for example, an

employer were charged with 169 violations of the child labor
laws and in fact those violations occurred, he could not
obtain a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge as t©
the reasonableness of the penalty.
And that is the clear and unequivocal reading of
the language.

It is our contention that this is -- was

33
the argument that was made by the Department of Labor in
this particular case before Judge Gasch and it is our
contention that it was made in other cases by the Department
of Labor,

And 'there is one specific Administrative Law

Judge til at did in fact hold that in light of the fact -that
the employer only objected to the reasonableness of the
penalties assessed rather than -the fact that the violations
actually occurred»- that he could not give him an administrative'
hearing,
And consequently we assert that the Administrator
of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Assistant Administrator

is in fact a judge under section 16 (e) and cannot be likened
to a prosecutor®
Also 1' would like to make the point that in the
instance of »« unlike a prosecutor, in this instance the
Assistant Regional Administrator sets the penalties®

He

has the discretion and the mandate of the Congress to
determine how much of this $.1,000 fine should be set.
prosecutor doesn11 set the penalty®
doesn't gat to keep the penalty®

The

The prosecutor, moreover,

The penalty goes to the

Treasury of the United States, it doesn't go bad: to the
/

office to reimburse the prosecutor for his expenses.
Again, we see no reason

why the prosecutor in

our instance could get the increase in salary.,
I would also like to make the point that in truth.

34
in fact that it is not sc much the Assistant Regional
Administrator who assesses these fines or who Is the first
judge in the first instance»

It really is the Employment

Standards Administration in Washington»
all of these individual fines.

D,C,

They approve

They negotiate or approve

individual settlements and they get the benefits? of the
penalties that are actually assessed.
The argument was mad® that —
QUESTION*

Is this the same pattern of assessing

fines as under the Mine Safety Act» if you know?
MR, POWER*

No» I know not» Your Honor» because»

for example the OSHA Act with which 1 am familiar, the fines
assessed go directly to the Treasury of the United States..,
This is the only area whore the fines go back to the assessor
of the fines to reimburse him for his cost of assessment.
So this is unique «*»
QUESTION*

Well» vre had a case argued hare last

session two or three weeks ago in which they were hot
criminal fines but they were as hare, penalties.

And these

went toward enforcement of that statutory scheme, which was an
anti«;gollutioh scheme,
MR. POWER*

If it is an aa.fi'-pollution» Your Honor,

I don’t believe they went back to the assessor of the fines,
X believe that Act. provides that the fines -«• and I question
the constitutionality of it myself but 1 think this is far

more serious in this case -- those fines I believe ware used.
to provide a fund to clean up waters.

But they didn11 go

back to reimburse the assessor of the fines»

That is about

the closest —
QUESTIONs
MR» POWER*
QUESTION a

That was not an issue in that case»
I see,
The question waa whether they were civil

penalties or criminal fines»
MR. POWER:

I question -the constitutionality even

of that prevision# although I think this is far more serious,
because I think an assessor of fines in the Environmental
-Protection Agency is probably highly motivated for assuring
adequate funds to clean waters»

And I think he could be

readily biased by his desire to' increase the coffers to clean
waters; and I think that is probably a. function of 'Congress.
But nevertheless the fines in that instance do- not go back
to the party assessing -the fines.

Th& argument was made by the Solicitor General
tint the -potential for bias and actual bias is not substantial
and is too remote»properly mads®

We believe that this argument cannot be

The reimbursement of the actual cost#

including salaries' and; expenses,- go directly to the assessor9

to the Administrator# to the Assistant Regional Administrator.
And r emphasize that this was the finding of Judea Gas eh in
his opinion.

Whether the fines -were- in fact used to increase

3(5
salaries or not, they can be used under the clear statutory
language»
In the instant case, $39,20G went to the Atlanta
office.

That was 2»l/2 times what any other office got

Mr. Power, are you suggesting that of

that $39,000 the Regional Administrator in Atlanta could

'Simply decide to put it in his own private bank account?
MR. POWER*

No, I am not. Justice Rehnquist.

I

think that he would not have the discretion but I do think
the Secretary of Labor has that kind of discretion under the
Act.
QUESTIONS

The Secretary of Labor could tell the

Regional Administrator in Atlanta:

"You have collected so

many fines this year that I am going to give all of them to
you»15?
MR. POWER®

It appears to me since the Act has

such broad language and says "notwithstanding any other
provision of law," that he has this kind
QUESTION3

of discretion.

And did you suggest he could put it

in his own pocket?
MR. POWER:

The Secretary of Labor could put it

in his own pocket?
QUESTION s
MR. POWER:

Yea.
I think it is permissible, directly

3?
or indirectly? yes,
QUESTIONS

Well* 1 suppose the Secretary of Labor

could tales all the furniture out of his office and take it
home and try to keep it but he might run into some other
problems?
MR. POWERt

Yes* I tliink that would be in violation.

I think that he would have to relate any remuneration to
himself to reimbursement for the cost of doing work in
connection with child labor enforcement.
But I think the more significant thing for
example in that Atlanta Regional Office is the questions
The Administrator or the Assistant Regional Administrator,
is there a potential for bias hero?

And if the man has e.

budget of let us assume $100,000 a year to operate his
office, to employ his secretaries, for his travel and
expense budget and he can increase that budget by really
>

slapping it to employers by way of civil money penalty fines
ancl increase that budget from $100,000 a year to operate
and gat to $200,000, then I think he has got a real potential
for bias, without even looking into the question of whether
or not he can increase hiss salary.
Finally, the question of severance I would like
to touch upon in -asy remaining couple of minutes.
■ ■ Actually, if you were to saver, if "this Court
wera to sever'the reimbursement provision of section 16(e)

38
alone* we do not believe it would cure the potential for bias
or appearance

-for bias* because severance of an

unconstitutional section or language of 16(e) would not in
fact give actual notice to investigators out. of the Depart­
ment of Labor or to Assistant Regional Administraters or
to Administrators or, for that matter, Administrative Law
Judges or employers*

rfhe language would still read as it;

presently reads, that the moneys shall be used to reimburse
»’

*

,

the assessor of the fine» " v
Also, severance ignoras the fact that all
\

'•

,

regulations currently adopted and the schedule of fines
and instructions to assistants at the Department of Labor
in determining the amount of the fines are predicated on the
assumption that the home office, the Washington office, will
get its share»

So what we are suggesting is that even the

«“*■* that we would Is back here in the Supreme Court if you
severed the reimbursement provision, because we would challenge

the CDsmtitutichality of the regulations themselves because
they were based oh the ass uiqjtion that the Department of
Labor was going to get its share of the funde and that they
did not meet their responsibility to set fines on the basis
of the gravity of the offenses as instructed by Congress.
fxnajuy, we do not believe that severance
•would accomplish congressional intent.

Congress directed

these moneys should be used to reimburse the Department of

39

Labor and be used for child labor enforcement: purposes.
If the speculation is going to be made that they
would ba just as satisfied to have the moneys go into the
Treasury of the United States, we question that.

Vie think

thay might well have not intended that the existing child
labor regulations be enforced*

Thay might well have

intended that these funds be used to revise what we consider
to b© an antiquated and grossly inadequate set of child
labor laws which are the* primary responsibility, in our
judgment, for the teenage and minor unemployment we have in
the United States today®
■ And it- is our fooling, as is actually the case,
there is a bill pending in Congress right now that would
not only require that the civil money penalty be set and
go to the Treasury of the United States but, in addition
to and as part of the same piece of legislation, would requi
the Secretary of Labor to completely review existing child
labor regulations so as to assure justice in enforcement of
this particular statute by having a logical and reasonable
set of child labor regulations .

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. GELLERs

First I would like to lay to rest

this notion that Administrative Law Judges might be entitled
to reimbursement under section 16(a).

There is absolutely

nothing in the statuta to back up that statement, the
Secretary of Labor has never construed the statute that
way and, as Mr. Justice Blackmun noted, Judge Gasch rejected
that argument.

Section 16(e) allows reimbursement only to

those officers have supervised the work of assessing and
collecting civil penalties.

The officer in the Department

of Labor that supervises the enforcement of the child
labor la*’ is the Employment Standards Administration.
Administrative Law Judges arc not par it of the Employment
81 and ar ds Adr • >. n is tr a felon •
Moreover, it would raise problems, I think, not
only under the Fifth Amendment but undor the Administrative
Procedure; Act to construe the statute so that any moneys
went to the Adminitstrative Law Judges.

And I think it would

ba a sort of basaar form of statutory construction to
construe a statute so as to make it unconstitutional.
Now, as to this notion that the Secretary

Excuse ms, Article 3 judges, wall,

that is an issue that may ba up in this Court.
The Secretary or the Assistant Regional Administrator
cannot put the money in his pocket, the statute is quite
clear that the- «usas collected must bs applied toward the
reimbursement of the coats of determining child labor
v

violations.
Finally, sis to appellee’s point that fie novo review
is not available before the Administrative Law Judge solely
on the question of the resscnublcmass of the penalty, fchiv
vary case shows that -feliat is false.

Because appelles never

challenged the violations in this case, conceded that it
had violated the child labor-laws before the Administrative
V.

Law Judge.

The Administrative- L&v Judge still reduced the

penalty from $103,ODD to $18,360.
Thank you very much.
