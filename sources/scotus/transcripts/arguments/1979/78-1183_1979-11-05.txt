MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

Workers„ ■
Mr. Johnson, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID Do JOHNSON. ESQos
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERo
MRo JOHNSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The petitioner Carbon like all the other employer
members of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association is required
by law to bargain collectively with the United Min® Workers of
America.

The Int eras £ tonal Union UMWA is the exclusive union

bargaining representative of the employees of all the operators
including Carbon.

All the employees are members of the

International as distinguished

from separately its subordinate

branches,
The International bargains and negotiates the contracts.
It comas to the bargaining table holding itself out as able to
speak for all of its members in support of the branches and to
commit them to the promises that it makes in the bargaining

The: International by its constitution has supreme
Legislative, Executive and Judicial authority over all of its
members and its subordinate branches.

However, the UMW has

4
i

•

{structured itself into a three-tiered organization with the
International Union at the top, the districts in the middle
• v-'' •

with jurisdiction in particula 1 geographic areas, and the
locals at the bottom with jurisdiction in particular mines oxcompanies.

The union has also unilaterally structured itself

in such a way that the local unions at the bottom of the tier
are at Carbon and generally elsewhere judgment proof against,
the satisfaction of substantial judgments for damages for breach
of contract.
QUESTION:

Mr. Johnson, did you say the union has

imilaterally structured itself.

Is that any differant than say

Mobil Oil Company decideding instead of operating a particular
business as a subsidiary of Mobil as a corporation it would spin
off and have another corporation?
MR,JOHNSON:

No, I think that when I say unilaterally

I mean the union has control over its internal structure and
that is very similar to many corporations who are parties to
the contractor.

This International Union makes, signs and

enters into the contract, it is the bargaining representative
party of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association members are
parties to the contract on the employers8 side of the table.
QUESTION:

Neither the district nor the locals are

parties to the contract?
t

MR» JOHNSON:

The districts 1 believe sign, the contract

5
as well as the Interional.

They have a organisation which is

established by the International Union to bargain the contract
and the district and the locals participate to the extent that
*. ’

the International permits them to do so.

And I believe that the

districts sign the contract as well as the International.
QUESTION:

As parties to the agreement?

MRo JOHNSON:

Yes, I think they are parties.

1 would

the position that they are parties to the contract in the sense
that that is the locals, the districts and the International are.
all parties to the contract in the sense that they all benefit
from it,accept the benefits of it, and I would say they are bound
by it.
QUESTION:

You wouldn't say a shareholder in a

corporation is a party to a contract which only the corporation
>■

has signed it junfc because a shareholder will ultimately benefit?
MR0 JOIiNSON:

That is right.

Strictly speaking in that

sensa, I don’t think that the district and the locals are parties
to the contract.. The International is the party to tha contract
and they are all bound by the contract.

The district is a

subdivision of lie International, acts as its agent with respect
to certain functions under the contract.

And the locals also have

jurisdiction baud upon particular mines and locals and they are
bound by the cci;ract but they are not parties to the contract.

QUES10N:
contract?

Don’t the locals have to approve the

6
MEo JOHNSON:

Yes, the contract is ratified by the

membership.
QUESTION:

It is binding upon them?

MRo JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

Sir?

It is binding upon them?

MRo JOHNSON:

It is binding upon them and they ratify

it.
QUESTION;

Are the International, district and local

all bound for example by the arbitration clause?
MR„ JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, I think certainly they are.

And they could enforce it.

MRo JOHNSON:

They could, enforce it by suit, they can

they are bound by it, they have the benefits of it, they are
obligated to comply with it.
Out of this collective bargaining arrangement the
employer Carbon and other operators have obtained a commitment
from the International Union to settle all disputes and
differences that arise between the employer and the employees and
the union during the life of the.agreement through a grievance
V

/

and arbitration procedure father than by strikes and work
stoppagesi

That commitment consists of two elements.

One of

them is the agreed procedure itself leading to binding arbitration.
The other is a specific commitment that the parties agree and
affirm that they will maintain the integrity of the contract
and that all disputes and claims which are not settled by

7
agreement shall be settled by the grievance and arbitration
machinery provided.

And this Court in Gateway Coal Company y.

United Mine Workers held that that constituted a binding implied
no-strike clause.

It is of course the policy of our national

labor policy as expressed in the Federal labor laws that
aolleetive bargaining agreements and particularly commitments
of this sort to settle disputes during the life of the contract
by binding arbitration shall be enforceable and shall not ba
permitted to become or to be Illusory.
Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley law axpreseesion a
Federal policy that the Court should enforce thas© agreements on
behalf of or against labor organizations in order to bring
about industrial peace and stability during the life of collefcive
bargaining agreements.
Other provisions of the Act evidence such same policy.
Section 204(a) states that employers and employees shall exart
every reasonable effort not only to make but to maintain agreements
mad© in the collective bargaining process.

Despite that binding

no-strike commitment in the coal contracts there were during
the period of time covered by this case 31 strikes at the mines
of Carbon alone over issues that ware arbitrable under the
contract.

The record shows that in the area of the Coal Operators

Association in southern West Virginia of which Carbon is a member,
during the same period of time there were literally hundreds of
such strikes and more than © thousand mine-days of work were lost

8

over these disputes that it had been agreed would be settled
peacefully through the grievance and arbitration procedure..
These strikes were not authorized by the International or
district unions.

In each case the district acting as an agent

of the International sent representatives to the local unions
who informed meetings of the local that the strike was disavowed
and not authorized and instructed the men to return to work.
Although they repeated ->•
QUESTION:

Did they dispute the representation of the

district representatives in doing that?
MRo JOHNSON:

I think there is no evidence whatsoever

that they acted in anything but good faith.

That is to say

they wanted the men to return to work, and there was nod nor

44 :
wink nor anything of that sort indicating the contrary.

But

repeatedly they stuck to the same routine without any results
t

and although they threatened repeatedly to use the other means
that they, had available to them to stop the strikes, none of
those pians that they referred to or that they threatened to use
were ever utilized by them. /•.
i

it

.

i

Their position was and has been that they had no
obligation to do anything more than they did and of course the
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in this case held that they had
no obligation and have no obligation to do anything.
QUESTION:

Do you think your case ie stronger or

weaker against the district, the International or the locals

9
respectively, or is it the same against all of them legally?
MRo JOHNSON:

Well, it gets different.

I think that

uar case against the International is stronger let us say in
the sense because the district is in the context of this case
acting as an agent acting for the International.

The vacant

commitment is by the International Union but the liability of
the locals in this ease, which is not an issue in hers, was
predicated on the mass action theory that all of the members of
the local want on strike when the mines went on strike, including
the officers; and that therefore it represented the action of the
union.

In that sense it is different.
QUESTION:

Was the district in trusteeship?

MRo JOHNSON:

The district was in trusteeship throughout

most but not all of the period of time that we ara involved with
here.

That is to say the International had take it over in

trusteeship and appointed the officers of the district during
most of the period.
QUESTION:

It is agreed no disciplinary measures were

ever taken?
MR, JOHNSON:

No disciplinary measures were taken at

Carbon’s mine nor so far as the record indicates any mines in
the Coal Operators Association.
discipline.

Nor •- it is just a matter of

The record shows that the union has a vareity of

means that it can use to attempt induce or coerce compliance
with the no“Strike clause including disciplinary action not

10

only against members but against the local as such

finds

against the local --- removal of the off iters of a local,
Improvicilon of a provisional government for the local, and
many things which are not spelled out in the constitution but I
think are inherent in it such as giving the members instructior
that a picket line is not authorised, that they should cross the
picket line or that they should remain at work despite the
picket line because the picket line is contrary to union policy.
None of these things were ever done, including any
disciplinary action.
Our proposition basically is that the situation that
exists here as shown in this case under the coal contract is
wholly incompatible with and in conflict with the national
labor policy enunciated by this Court to give meaning and effect
to no-strike commitments in contracts during the life of
collective bargaining contracts.

And not to permit them to

become illusory and meaningless.
QUESTION!

Is it in effect an action for a specific

performance?
MR0 JOHNSON:

It is an action for damages, Your

Honor. •
QUESTION:

Falling —

MRo JOHNSON:

It is an action for damages against

the International district unions as well as the locals, but
that issue is not here, for their failure to use -th«T reasonable

11
means available to them to prevent breaches of the contract by
their members and subordinate branches, specifically breaches
of the no-strike clause of the contract.

And it is our
/

position —
QUESTION:

How about the arbitration clause?

MRo JOHNSON:

Well, the arbitration clause — of

course when I speak of the no-strike clause I am speaking ox
the commitment in the contract that all disputes will be settled
through our grievance and arbitration procedures rather than by
strikes.
The language which this Court held in the Gateway case
would constitute a binding, no-strike clause.
Now, our proposition simply is that both the policy
of the national labor law, the national labor policy is to make
such agreements effective and prevent them from becoming
illusory and common, ordinary principles of traditional contract
law require that their be implied in the no-strike clause an
obligation upon the part of the International and district
unions to use reasonable means available to them to stop and
prevent strikes by their members and subordinate branches.
QUESTION:

Wasn*t there during the period from around

1950 a specific clause in the agreement to that affect which was
later dropped?
MRo JOHNSON: Yes, Your Honor.

The decision of the

Fourth Circuit is based upon the fact that in 1950 there was

12
written into the contract a specific provision.

In

addition to the maintain the integrity clause of the contract
on which w© really,we eay that even if assuming for purports
of argument that national labor policy and ordinary principleof contract, law don't require the imposition or the implicati:/.

•

;

Well, how do you refute the argument

that there was once a specific

provision in the contract that

would Have probably required th® result that you sought, and
h V'

.

that was dropped by consent of the parties?
MRo JOHNSON:

Th® language ~~ the specific language

referred..tq was in addition to the maintain the integrity
clause language.

The 1950 agreement used the words "and

r' '

exercise their best efforts to the available disciplinary
i

measures to prevent work stoppages."

That was deleted from the

contract in 1952 and th® Fourth Circuit relied upon that
deletion as meaning that there was no remaining obligation

I

{

13
to — or no intended obligation on the part of the International
Union' reasonable means to stop strikes.

We think that that

was error, it was error for several reasons.

One of them is

that it gives no meaning or significance, doesn't explain why
the maintain the integrity language was retained in the
contract and has remained in it to the present time.
And secondly, tha bargaining history the Court relied
on which was that stated by "the District of Columbia Circuit
Court of Appeals in the International Union

v.

UHftTis

incompletely and inaccurately stated by the District of
F

Columbia Circuit in that case.

The full and accurate bargaining

'history is set forth in the NLRB case which was a subject of

the Court of Appeals decision known as the Boon© County case
in 117 NLRB and it appears in the bargaining history set
forth fully in that case but the language that we are
referring to was deleted in 1952 not because the International
Union .objected to doing something about strikes or attempting
to take some action to stop strike^ by its subordinate
branches but because it objected to being required to usa
discipline in every case whether it was reasonable in a
specific case or not.

And the Fourth Circuit's decision also

like the District of Columbia Court on which it railed fails
utterly to take not© of the fact that in 1947. when Taft-Harfcley
was passed the union did several things with, a contract to
protect against financial liability.

One of them was it

14
deleted the expressed no-strike clause.

This Court in Gat way

said that that deletion was not sufficient to destroy the nostrike commitment but

the important thing was what language

remained, as in this case the maintain the integrity language.
But they deleted the no-strike clause in 1947 and they also
wrote into the contract and the bargaining history in the
/

Boone County case recites that it was for the purpose of relievlthem of financial responsibility for a strike.
They wrote into the contract the "willing and able"
clause which said in effect the miners would work when they were
willing and abls to do so, they would have no obligation to
work otherwise and that the union would have no obligation to
try to make them work or to get them to work.
The bargaining history in the Boone County case
further shows that after two years with that language the
operators came back into the negotiations in 1952 and -- or
in 1950 after --it was 1947 that language went in and in 1950
they came into the negotiations and negotiated out the "willing
and able" clause for the purpose, for the stated avowed purpose
in negotiations of reestablishing the union's financial
responsibility for wildcat because it had a wave of such
strikes under the "willing and able" clause.
All of this language is overlooked, not

referred

to at ihle.ll of its bargaining history in the Fourth
Circuit's decision because that court relied upon the

15

District of Columbia Circuit’s decision which incorrectly and
incompletely stated what appears in the findings of fact which
were not rejected by the District of Columbia Circuit in the
Boone County case.
But the.fact remains that the "maintain the integry”
clause remains In the contract to this day, committing the
International Union to maintain the integrity of the contract.

y

Our position is that that is a commitment to an affirmative
action, it: is a commitment to take all reasonable means to try
to prevent: breaches of the no-strike clause and that no other
meaning, no other reasonable meaning can be attributed to it
but exactly that.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRISON COMBS, ESQ.,,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MRo COMBS:

Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court.:

Mr. Chief Justice, the position of the Union is that
the bargaining history of the contractual clause 'is in issue
here, that: if the contentions of the operators are accepted
by this Court that it in effect would rewrite tha contract on
which tha parties agreed.
Th© 1950 contract, the union and the operators
agreed to maintain tha integrity of this contract, to exercise
their best efforts to available disciplinary measures to prevent

16
strikes or no accounts pending the processes of grievances.,
Besides their use of available disciplinary measures of the
1952 contract eliminated the best efforts and use of discipllr i
measures„
Since 1952 and not to the data of the contractual
provisions that are the subject of this suit phrases to use
the bast efforts to available disciplinary measures had beet
deleted from these contracts.
It is the position.of the union that there is no
contractual obligation on the part of the union with reference
to unauthorized wildcat strikes.
QUESTION:

You are not arguing for any Norris-LaGuardip

Act type of limitation independent.

On. the contrary you are

simply for proper construction of a voluntary reached agree­
ment?
' MR» COMBS:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is correct.

Of course wa cite that there b© some reflection on the policy
announced by Norris“L&Guardia with reference to encouraging
collective bargaining to arrive at these contracts.
QUESTION:

But then Norris-LaGuardia just deals with

injunctions.
The Norris-LaGuardia policy though was to settle —
it does have some impact on this case, to some extant.
QUESTION:

You feel you must rely in part on Norris-

LaGuardia and not just on an interpretation of the voluntarily

17
reached agreement between the Parties?
MR» COMBS;

No, we do not rely on Norris-LaGuardia

for that purpose; no.

The answer would be "No," Mr. Justice.

The contractual provisions that are in dispute here
were the subject of interpretations by the Court from 1955 in
the the Haislip case on which the Fourth Circuit relied here
from 1958 and the decision of this Court admitted that the
/

contracts were neogltated by the parties with with the
interpretation of those provisions in those contracts.
The union was aware of those Court interpretations
at the time that these contracts were negotiated.

The national

labor policy of free collective bargaining sustains our argument:
that forbids government dictation on the terms of the Agreement:
as set forth in this Court’s case of H. K. Porter to Mr. Justice
Black.
The union has a. general policy against wildcat
strikes as shorn in this record.

It tried actively to terminate-

them but it is their judgment. (f the internal judgment on the
best means of doing this.
QUESTION:

Mr. Coombs, would you have a different

position of the contract had a no-strike clause?
MRo COMBS;

1 think not, Your Honory because none

of this was authorised.
QUESTION:

And. you would say that just a
'

c

bare no-strike clause would not carry with it an obligation

IS
..

to take affirmative efforts to stop wildcat strikes?
MR„ COMBS!;;

I would say just a bare showing that

the union had authorized that strike would not bs sufficient*
QUESTION:

And an integrity clausa wouldn’t add

anything to that, I take it you argue.
f

...

MR*, COMBS:
QUESTION:

That would b© my argument; that is true.
There is nothing in the last

that would

permit the operators from demanding a clause in the contract
to require the International or the district to do everything
in their power in every single situation subject only to the
impossibility to prevent wildcat strikes.
MRo COMBS:

That would be a subject of permissive

bargaining to decide on what steps the union would take in its
internal structure to bring about these strikes.
permissive bargaining.
QUESTION:

That would be our position on that.

Mr. Coombs, the judgment here against the

local union as I understand it.
to ask you:

That would be

And it is it correct -- I want

Does the judgment against the local rest at all on

this provision of the contract?

MRo COMBS:

It does to this extent:

The judgment

was based upon the mass action of the local union as an entity.
They did violat® the contract by refusing to arbitrate an
arbitrable grievance, that was the judgment.

In 1968 and 1971 these contract provided

It provided for

These are the contracts hers.

a mis cellar-sous

And I siagrea with

counsel t© the extant in his answer that this was ratified fey
the membership.

It was not at that time.
. . V:-

I would like to go just briefly into the methods by
which these contracts were bargained in 1968 and 1971 and in

21
the times past on that.

The International Union referred to

here has to do with the International Convention.

That

convention was represented by delegates from of the local
unions from the members.

That convention sets up a policy

committee that includes representation from each of the
districts.

It involves some 21 at this time.

That the members

vote in this policy committee is given the authority under the
convention to negotiate these contracts.

The districts are not

parties to the contract» neither the local union per se.

They

represent on the policy committee the membership of that
policy committee and once the policy committee which consisted
at that time of 175 or 200 members, that policy committes mads
the contracts and executed and authorised them.

They were not

ratified by the membership at that time.
In 1941 the contract provided specifically in the
settlement of disputes, the arbitration clause, that pending
the settlement of those disputes that there should be no
cessation of work.

That was in the 1941 contract and, in

addition, the 1941 contract contained a miscellaneous provision
that was bargained side by side to the effect that.an illegal
stoppage of work was a violation of the contract.
provisione.

Two

Those contracts ware carried forward through

negotiatione up until 1947 at which time the Taft-HartXey
Act became effective.

The union negotiated in collective

bargaining; with the operators did delete from the arbitration

machinery the cassation of work clause in the arbitration.
They also negotiated in a miscellaneous clause that all t
no-strike penalty and work stoppage clauses would be canceled,
made mil and void by reason of the fact that the union argued
that it would not be responsible and couldn't be responsible
for the spontaneous, unauthorised, walk out strikes.

That was it*.

1947.
There ware contracte negotiated between 1950 and in
jjjr

;

the 1950/contract again by negotiating parties — by the
parties/— the 1950 contract contained clauses to the effect
that the parties — both or them — would maintain the integrity

clause, and only the integrity* clause was left.
How t from 1952 up until the present day' that term
has been deleted specifically and the miscellaneous clausa to
carried on through.
QUESTIOH:

But I take it from your argument

and

aorrect mo if I have a misconception of it — that your position
would be the same prior to 1952 under that old contract.
MRo COMBS:

'Our position would be the same insofar as

23
authorizing the strikes because because of the International
Union»
QUESTION:

So that puts you In disagreement, does it,

with the basis of the Fourth Circuit’s holding?
MRo COMBS:

No; no, your Honor, the: Fourth Circuit

held that with reference to
QUESTION:

I am not quarreling with the opinion

the basis of their opinion,
MR* COMBS:

Their opinion was based upon the contract

in which they said that the bargaining history of the clause and
the construction of it was such that there was no contractual
obligation on ah© part of the union to do anything.

They didn’t'

say that tha union could authorize, specifically instruct, end
there is no evidence as’ counsel said hare, whatsoever that the
union had anything to do with authorising those strikes or
participating in them or condoning them.
Now, if the. Court please, in 1955 the Fourth Circuit
in the Halslip case construing the *ams type of provision in
the contract, held through Judge Parker that there was no
obligation on the part of the union to do anything with reference
to these unauthorized wildcat strikes and that tha record showed
that the union had — that the operators had called the union

in, tha union representatives to help them settle the strikes and
that the union had done so.

That occurred in this case.

This

Court upheld the opinion of the Sixth Circuit Benedict Coal

24
Company case Mr. Justice Stewart speaking for the Sixth
Circuit at that time as a Judge of that Court, stated that
the language of the 1952 contract relieved the union -- the
national union from any obligation for spontaneous, unauthorised
strikes.
QUESTION:

Was that the. Benedict Coal case?

MR„ COMBS:

Yes, Your Honor.

The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
held basically the same thing.
Now, in the light of those court opinions these
contracts war© negotiated by the parties in 1952, 1954, 1956,
58,

"64,

'68 and *71.

Ail those contracts were negotiated in

the light of those court decisions including the provisions that
they are claiming here.
QUESTION:

That was before the contrary authority

developed creating the conflict among the Courts of Appeals?
MR0 COMBS;

Yes, Your Honor, the Court pointed out --

yes, Mr. Justice Black, and that is correct -» the Court pointed,
out, the Fourth Circuit did that the cases in the Third Circuit,
U.S. Steal, Republic, that it was their opinion that the effect
t

of those cases were to rewrite the contract and that they
disagreed with them.
Now, the Fourth Circuit pointed out that the Seventh
Circuit: and the Sixth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit are in
agreement on the interpretation of these various provisions we

25
are talking about hare and in of course the Benedit Coal
Company case.
It is the position of the union hare that is a matter
of collective bargaining.

This question of discipline is a

question of judgment and with all due respect to opposing
<

counsel in. their brief they point out the difficulties
in the company trying to exercise discipline themselves.

They

point out ifra fireman might have got the whole crowd on their
s'

hands or sometimes their old route and it raises ill feeling
•V ‘

among the members, their employees

simply it is not

efficient

for disciplinary action.
Mow, we on the other hand, the union at the bargaining
table and in this record say approximately the same thing, that
these employees of these companies are hired by the company,
they are fired by hue company, they are directed by the company,
and if the company says It will cause too much hard .feeling
and be too harsh to fir© these people, the union says on the
other hand that w© take the charter away from this local union
and probably spread to other local unions, and certainly they
don*t want that.
In union procedure, the union, its constitution and
law, it is vary strict on the trusteeships.

It takes an

extended period of hearings, it takes extended reports and
it requires a long time to take a charter away from

Iti

addition to that, they talk about disciplining a

That member has a right under the Landrum-Griffin

Act and under the Taft-Hartley Act.
to what he is charged with.
to be heard.

He has a right of notice

would be where the trial would be held.

That

He has the

protection of going through appeals in the union in 6 or 8
months perhaps after the strike.

Maybe the discipline might

be finished and maybe it wouldn't be.
.Aid it is the judgment of the union that disciplinary
action is not something that would protect either the union or
the operators in stopping these strikes, that their judgment
has been negotiated on since 1941 up to date.

And I might say

that the reason ,for the 111-day strike, the top thing on the
agenda of the negotiators was the question about these unauthorised
strikes.
If the Court please, it has long been the policy of
the national labor laws to encourage collective bargaining
as a means of lessening industrial strife and promoting industria:,
peace.

We think this applies to all unions and all employers

in this country; that is the policy enunciated by the Congress.
Justice Black stated in the Porter Company v. NLRB
that the basic theme of the Labor Act -was that through collective
bargaining the passions, the arguments and struggles of prior
years would be channeled into constructive, open discussions
leading it was hoped to mutual agreement.

27

yBut, it was recognised from the beginning that some
cases would be impossible and.it was never intended that the
Government would in such cases step in and become a party to the
negotiations and impose its own views.

That is this Court

speaking in 1970.
We feel strongly that for this International Union
to be held liable for work stoppage which it neither authorised,
condoned or ratified, that this would be in conflict with the
labor policy of promoting collective bargaining and would
seriously undermine the collective bargaining rights and
industrial strife between the parties may be increased.

QUESTION:

What do you say the clause means when the

International Union took on an obligation to guarantee the
integrity of the contract?

MEo BOMBS:

If .the court please, we read that on page.

1.9 and 20 of the brief and it cites

the United States District

Court of Appeals for D,C. stated it well, recites that the thrust
of the whole thing is this:

Admit constantly since 1941 they

negotiated this, they wanted to settle with us by collective
bargaining. That is what' the integrity laws mean, that they would
exercise the best collective, bargaining that could bring about
this settlement.

But at no time were they arguing at that time

that the union would be liable for unauthorised spontaneous

strikes...
QUESTION:

You mean the integrity clause has no

28

consequence or meaning after the contract ia signed but onlybeforehand in the negotiations?

MRo COMBS:

Well, it is clearly established — it

was clearly established that the elimination of the disciplinary
and the best efforts clauses were for the purpose of preventing
the mi ion from being held liable for something that could admit
trouble.

That was understood.

And to say that the Integrity

clau.se had the same meaning we think stretches the imagination
and we don’t think it conforms to common, ordinary reasoning.
QUESTION:
mean.

Tell me, just what do you think it does

You have told us not what it does not mean.

What does

it mean?
MR0 COMBS:

Well, what it says specifically is that

they will maintain both sides, will maintain the integrity of
this agreement and it is to be

settled by collective bargaining without recourse to the courts
That is what it says.

And I think that a lot of times in the

courts that it is forgotten.
itself.

It states the purpose in there

It says that this is to be settled -** these matters

by collective bargaining without recourse to the courts.

That

is what the clause says.
QUESTION:

Arguably it could mean if you just read

the words that neither party will attempt to add any provisions
to the contract.
'MRo COMBS:

That is right.

29
QUESTION:

Would it mean that the company would not

be —would not have any obligation under the integrity clause
if the company refused to engage in arbitration?
MR0 COMBS:

Well, to answer your question I think whet,

you talk about arbitration both sides agree we will do our
obligation to arbitration.

But I think the company would say

that that doesn’t mean they could not bring out if they wanted
to whatever matter they wanted to.

We are talking about strikes

and knock outs when we are talking about the liability of the
union in there, we are talking about strikes and knock outs;
we are not talking about arbitration.

We accept the fact that

if the local union refuses to go through arbitration and the
International and it is authorised, that that is the implied
agreement held by this Court that it would arbitrate it.

But

certainly don’t think that the’ integrity clause is equivalent.
QUESTION:

Isn't there a general principle of contracts

law that neither party will do anything to frustrate the
legitimate expectations of the other arising out of the contract^
MR„ COMBS:
affirmative steps.

Yes, Your Honor.

They would take

I think this would be a different case if

the union under the implied agreement had authorised these
strikes and said, you guys go ahead, wa can’t settle it under
arbitration, so go ahead, strike.

That was Sixth Circuit in

Rhode Island.
QUESTION:

Mr. Combs, let me ask you a question

30
about the litigation in the Third Circuit Republic Steel
litigation:

Do I correctly understand that Judge Aldersert's

opinion in that case really relied kind of on public policy
rather than strict interpretation of the contract?
MR0 COMBS:

That is correct; that is the way I read

it.
QUESTION:

And then the case went back.

Did the

jury hold the International liable for damages?
MRo COMBS:

Your Honor, that case is still on remand.

No, we haven't paid any damages on that I recall.
QUESTION:

I see.

It has not been tried yet; is that right?
It :Ls not tried to my memory.

MRo COMBS:

We have

got so many of them I am sure it hasn’t.
'-QUESTION:

I see.

Thank you.

MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Johnson.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D0 JOHNSON >

' ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MRo JOHNSON:

May it please the Court, I want to say

a little bit furthermore about the meeting of the integrity
clause which Your Honors have raised.

Of course the Third

Circuit has held that the commitment to maintain the integrity
of the contract that all disputes shall be settled in the
grievance and arbitration procedure in the words of the court
necessarily embraces an obligation to use all reasonable means

31

to enforce or uphold.
QUESTION:

It really means to prevent the strike in

the first place, they mixed the local and the district and the
International on the same litigation, didn’t they?
MR0 JOHNSON:

You are referring to the Eazor Express

case or —
QUESTION:

No, the second one

MR0 JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

The United States Steel case?

/

KRo JOHNSON:

Well, my recollection is that in that

case they said the maintaining integrity clause necessarily
embraces an all reasonable means obligation and we think that
that is the only means that can reasonably be attributed to
it.
QUESTION:

Is it all reasonable means to prevent a

strike from starting e-r to end one once it started?

There is

a little difference between the theory of the mass action theory
which I guess makes the union liable for -- in effect for the
strike itself.

And then your theory here is that there is

sort of a second obligation to get the strike over as fast as
you can if it starts without authorization of the union itself.
MRc

JOHNSON:

Yes, Your Honor, our position is that

the all reasonable means obligation embraces both an obligation
to try to prevent strikes when there is reason to believe that
strikes will occur and an obligation to stop them or to try to

32

stop them when they do occur, and that it is twofold. Of course
the -QUESTION:

The manner half we have got involved

here, of course»
M&o JOHNSON:

That is right.

It means that there are reasonable of course la a
question of fact which was submitted to the jury and resolved
by the jury in this case.

But the means that are reasonable,

what constitutes all reasonable means in any given ease is of
course going to depend upon the particular facts and circumstances
of each strike.

And one of those factors is, when did the

union get notice of it.
act.

When did they have an opportunity to

And in this case the jury awards damages I think leads

you inevitably to the conclusion that the jury didn't find the
International Union liable from the commencement of each strike
tut from such point as the jury determined they should have
acted and had notice and an opportunity to act.
With respect to the meaning of integrity, some light
may be cast upon it by the fact that one of the several
directives that the International Union, issued to its members
in locals between 1951 and 1966 telling them that these strikes
were unauthorized, that they were a problem for the union and
calling upon the locals and their officers to act against them,
in on® of those it refers specifically to the fact that the
strikes — wildcat strikes that were occurring in the locals

33

threatened the integrity of the joint bargaining relationship
— contractual relationship between the operators and the
union.

I don't -- I submit respectfully that there could be

little doubt that the integrity clause is directly related to
the immediately following commitment to settle all disputes
through contract grievance and arbitration procedure.
QUESTION:

I take it you wouldn’t argue without the

integrity clause the International would be liable.
MRo JOHNSON:

Our position is that the International

is liable because there is inherent in the ~~ well, I may have
misunderstood you, Youz' Honor.
QUESTION:

Let's assume that there is no integrity

clause but there was an expressed no strike clause — just a
simpla no strike clause,
MR0 JOHNSON:

My position would be Your Honor, that

whether there is an expressness strike clause or whether there
is an implied no strike clause, whether the specific maintain
the integrity language is used or not, that there is inherent
in the no strike promise under our national labor policy and
the implied commitment that the union that makes that promise
will use the reasonable means available to it to prevent its
subordinate branches and its member -QUESTION:

So in effect than you say the integrity

clause doesn't add a thing.
MR0 JOHNSON:

I say that —

34

QUESTION:

It is just a --

MRo JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

You —

-- It just expresses what is already

there.
MRo JOHNSON:

I think that that is essentially true.

I think that the parties were concerned as to xfhether or not
there would be any obligation unless they wrote it in there.
They wrote It in there.

Of course you had on the books at that

time a number of decisions which certainly made it doubtful
whether or not they xrould have such an implied commitment unless
they expressly set it forth.
And I believe, Your Honor, that they wrote the integrity
clause in there for the purpose and with the intent of making
nure that the International Union would act affirmatively and
diligently to try to stop and prevent the wildcat strike from
going on.
QUESTION:

Even though at the same time they

eliminated an express undertaking.

MRo JOHNSON:

That is correct.

The union argued in Gateway you knox? that the deletion
of the no-strike clause had relieved them from any no-strike
obligation.
This Court has stated, Your Honor, that the important
thing, the significant thing was not the language that had been
deleted but the language that had been retained, a commitment

35
to settle all disputes through the grievance procedure.
QUESTION:

Well, was this the Third Circuit's

position, was the Third Circuit’s position the same as yours
that the case would be the same without the integrity clause?
MR„ JOHNSON:

It is my reading of the Third Circuit5 s

aecision that that they say the national labor policy and the
fundamental principles of contract law require a reasonable
effort by the International Union and that the
integrity clause

maintain the

vitiates the union's argument that the

parties did. not intend any such obligation.
QUESTION:
J_-

Why don't you go further and say that the

...

union guarantees in effect that there will be no strikes?
MR0 JOHNSON:

I think that it is not consistent with

national labor policy to go that far.
QUESTION:

Where would you pull this national labor

policy from; from out of the air?
MR0 JOHNSON:

No, Your Honor, the Court of course

long ago said that it is the function of the Federal courts
in developing substantive law under Section 301 of the Taft-

>

Hartley law to develop law to give effect to the national labor
policy expressed in those laws.
QUESTION:

But it didn't say that you rewrite the

contracts that people enter into in collective bargaining.
MR„ JOHNSON:

No, but it says very clearly, Your Honor,

that the labor policy is to make collective bargaining agreements

36
enforceable and particularly commitments to settle disputes
peacefully during the last contract and grievance procedure.
And therefore when the parties agree on a no-strike clause and
say this is the way we will settle prior disputes during the
life of the agreement, the party that makes that agreement
is under an obligation to prevent its breach.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
Whereupon, at 11:01 o'clock p.m., the case was
submitted.)
