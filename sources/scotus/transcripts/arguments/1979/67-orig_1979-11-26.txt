PROCEEDINGS
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments first

this morning in No, S7® Original * the State of Idaho and others
v0 the States of Oregon and Washington0
Mr» Leroya Mr» Attorney General® you may proceed whenever
you are ready0
ORAL ARGUMENT OP DAVID H0 LEROY, ESQ,
OH BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS
MRo LEROY;

Hr, Chief Justice® and may it please the

Court;
Idaho appears for the second time before the Court in
its effort to seek a fair share of Idaho-raised and Idaho-r efcu rr.ing
anadroaous fish runs„

This Court's opinion earlier this year in

Jr.iy in Washington vQ Uxiited States made the Covxrt again familiar
with the general nature of these fish and the general issues
regarding allocation,.

However® the Idaho case is very differente

Wh are dealing here with the Columbia River system only0

There

i£s an existing District Court and Ninth Circuit-affirmed allocation
order and management plan which already equitably divides up the
treaty and non-treaty shares of fish between the Indians so
entitled, in the States of Oregon and Washingtonf and that
equitable division is not contested,
case against Indian Treaty fishery0

Idaho makes no claim in this
Rather® it seeks only a

further equitable distribution of the already established nontreaty shares to include Idaho„

nevertheless, we appear this morning at grave procedural
disadvantage,,

If this Court accepts the recommendation of its

distinguished Master it will dismiss Idaho°s case before we
reach the obvious merits which that same Master finds in the
matter
The facts are these:
The Columbia River for the last 300 axles of its course
to the Pacific Ocean becomes the boundary line dividing Oregon
and Washingtono

The Snake River flows through Idaho and then

into Washington to join the Columbia;, becoming its principal
tributary»

In Idaho there are over 3,000 miles of spawning

habitat for anadromous fish, freshwater fish which after a twoyear life cycle migrate to the ocean to share & similar cycle
there, then return to their native x^aters to spawn and propagacs
the specieso
In 1918 Washington and Oregon with the blessing of
Congress created a Columbia River Compact to administer the non —
treaty fishery rights and to cooperate with Indian rights under
1355 treatieso

For 40 to 60 years last past ±ds.h.o has sought

membership unsuccessfully in this Compact fov entreaties to Oregon
and to Washington»
In 1969 disputes between the Indian and non-Indian
fishery on the Columbia River resulted in two pieces of litigation
being consolidated and being decided in the District Court of
Oregon $ Sohappy v 0 smith and The United States v» Oregon regarding

6

Oregon9s regulation scheme of the Indian fish and its impact on
the Indian fishery®
The United States as tribal trustee in those District
Court cases was a voluntary party and is accordingly bound by the
decree®
,-In 1974 the District Court in Oregon amended the
earlier-decree to establish a 50-50 allocation between treaty and
noa-treaty rights of the an&dromous fish which was affirmed in
.19 76 by the Minth Circuit®

And in 1977 the parties, including

the United, States and including Oregon and Washingtont entered
into a voluntary agreement which in some slight parts amended the
prior decree and established a basic framework for the counting,
distribution and allocation of those fish into the two shares
and establishing zones of fishery, the non-treaty zone being
established in the first 140 miles of the river from the ocean
upstream to Bonneville Dam and the treaty Indian fishery zone
being established as Zone 6 from Bonneville Dam 130 miles further
up the Columbia River®
In 1975 Idaho sought leave of this Court to file a
complaint seeking two things:

first, membership in the compact?

an 3 secondly, an equitable apportionment of three of those
anadrosaous fish runs, the spring Chinook salmons the summer
chinook salmon and the summer steelhaad trout®

We urged in that

litigation that where more than half of the returning adults

which reentered the Columbia River had been raised in Idaho and

7
wouId return if unimpeded to Idaho * that current raaaagament
practices of the defendants both denied Idaho a fair share of
those fish and gravely threatened the propagation and continued
existence of the species 0
We were granted by this Court after oral argument*
leave to file the complaint as to the equitable apportionment
isstie only„

This Court appointed the Honorable Jean Braitenstein

Master and in due course* on July 31* 1978s he issued an initial
report with three conclusions;

number one* that the complaint

stated e justiceable controversyjand that the pendancy of U„

So

Vo Oregon was no bar to this action* to which findings both Oregon and Washington accepted; and third was that the UcSo did not consent
to this suit* that it had a number of interrelated interests and
that this decree without the presence of the United States in the
litigation could not provide an adequate remedy„
QUESTIO!!s
M.R0 LEROY:

I missed number two; you gave us number
Yea» Your Honor* the second finding of the

Court was the pendancy of, the Uo So vc Oregon and Sohappy v0
Smith0 s judgmentso
QUESTION:
MRo

LEROY;

QUESTION:

MRo LEROY:

They were no bar to this action0
Pardon me* sir0
But they were no bar to this action0
They were no bar to the action; yes* Your

Honoro
QUESTION:

Oh ay

8

MRo LEROY:

Thus the Master, concluding that the United

States was a necessary party, recommended dismissal* to which
Idaho accepted on four grounds:

number one, that the Federal

interest in this matter could be adequately represented by amicustype status; secondly, that the finding of indefensibility by the
Master was in error; third* that a determination by this Court of
the matter would not unduly burden the Court; and fourth, that the
alternative of mutual accommodation was not available»
QUESTION:

In the final report* I ask you:

Did the

Special Master indicate that the case could go forward without
infringing on Indian rights?
MR» LEROY:

Yes, Your Honor* he dido

His findings were*

applying the test of Rule 19,. that as to Parts 1 and 2 of that
rule regarding the necessary nature* that the very narrow nature
of this lawsuit addressing only the non-Indian share would in
fact causa no loss of rights to the Federal Government0
QUESTION:

Wasn8fc it the prospect of enforcing the

decree against Indians that led him to, or at least help lead him
to- the conclusion that the United States was an indispensable
party?
MR» LEROY:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, it was0
Well, how do those two jibe* anyway, if you

if there is no real need of interfering with Indian rights; what
enforcement against the Indians would have to take place?
MRo LEROY:

soar Honor, the Mastersb basic concern was

9

that without party status there was so guarantee that Idahocs
benefits from this lawsuit could he forced upstream if they were
decreed through that Zone 6 Indian fishery0
QUESTION:

Mr» Leroy., the term has been used "indispensable

party,” and as I read the 1S66 amendments to the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure that term is not used in those rules 0
HR, LEROY:

Yes, Your Honor, in the sense that Rule 19

as; it. now stands talks of parsons to be joined if feasible and
persons where- in Subpart B that must be present to give an
adequacy to the judgment»
QUESTIOH:

It suggests a somewhat laser standard,'doesh*t

it, than the old indispensable party?
)

MR, LEROY:

Your Honor, we would urge that to the Court

aa.3. we would urge that this type of approach need be particularly
flexible in a case of original jurisdiction where a substantial
detriment to a precious natural resource may occur»
QUESTION?

Except for the delay, what is your chief

concern or concerns about having the United States made a party?
HR, LEROYi

Your Honor, in terms of -Idaho8s preference

we would like to see the United States involved as a party»

In

fact we have lobbied the United States considerably to that
objective»
But our point in urging to the Court that the Master
was in error in ruling that they were a necessary party to give
lequacy to a judgment is this litigation, is that the very delay

10

which that a dismissal may occasion or in fact at worst if we
are barred from all access to this Coart and other appropriate
remedy, not only would our equitable rights be lost fcrat so also
■«well may be the runs of fish iipon which we sued»
QUESTION:

Well# the United States refuses to join#

doesa81 it?
MR„ LEROY:

The United States at this point in time# Your

Honor, by a split Executive decision has determined that they would
not waive sovereign immunity,»
QUESTION:

Is that really the question?

The Executive

agencies have no business waiving sovereign immunity# have they?
MR„ LEROY:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor# —
Wouldn't they do it by just intervening9

bringing a lawsuit"—•
MRo LEROY:
QUESTION:

Your Honor -— and stating a claim?

That is the way

they do it, isn't it?
MR0 LEROY:

We are well aware of the basic proposition

that it is Congress that is empowered to waive sovereign immunity
but, in fact, in this case the declination to be legally involved
in this case by Justice offers the same kind of bar at the expense
of sovereignty»
QUESTION:

I agree»

Their refusal to intervene is the

sanae —< operates the same' way.
MR» LEROY:

Yes, Your Honor

11

The Master entered a final report in this matter —
QUESTION:

Does this Court have the power to make the

United States a party if the Court should conclude that Judge
Breitenstein was correct, that they are a necessary party?
MRo LERGY:

Your Honor, we urge to the Court that in

this case the Court might consider reviving the Florida vc Georgia
reinsfcitutioii of special amicus-type status»

As the Court will

recall, in that matter the Attorney General of the United States
wished to intervene in a boundary dispute between those two
Stateso

And to avoid technical dismissal and to avoid defeating

jurisdiction in that original action, upon a theory that the
Court could discount unnecessary technicalities, upon a theory
that procedural devices were within the program of this Court to
allow the continuance and acceptance of its constitutional mandate
if in a special status allow the Attorney General of the United
States without becoming a full party to participate in argument,,
to cross-examine witnesses>• to produce evidence, we urged the
Court as we have in our brief that especially now, given the

'

complexity and pervasiveness of the Federal Government, given the
fact that there is a much greater frequency of interchange between
the States than there was in 1055 when that decision oaae out,
that that concept of special amicus-style status to the extent
that there are interests in this matter, is a concept ripe for re .institution»
la addition —

12

QUESTION s

Mr o' attorney Generals, i£ you have imacus

•status you caa't get relief . nor caa relief be granted against
you,
MRo LEROY:

Wells Your Honors, we urge that the Master's

finding that there need fee involvement of the United States is
-wrongo

Our argument is simple and brief in that regard,,

We say

that there @as general agreement between the parties and the
Master as we proceeded through the matter# that Supreme Court
Rule 9 made Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19 useful in measuring
indispensability in this kind of case©

Partly the Master found

favorably to Idaho under Rule 19 because the narrow framing of
the issue» he found that there would be no prejudice to the
United States# that there would be no loss of SoS, rights; and#
secondly# he found that Idaho would have no other *•" no adequate
remedy of law,
But the Master was concerned about the adequacy of
the judgment on three factors;

the operation of eight dams along

the Snake and Columbia River by the Corps of Engineers? on the
Indian trustee status relationship to fishing rights in general;
and third,, on the United States Government°s control and manage­
ment of the specific fishery,
QUESTION;
of those# areast you?

You are willing to take your chances on all
I take it your narrow focus is just to

have a greater escapement above Bonneville,
MR, LEROY:

Your Honor, we are willing to take our

13

«i, an,ce s —*
■OSKSTI'OMi
MR, LSROY:

There may be a lot of risks involved» but -—
Your Honor, we think not as to the Halted

t

States for these reasons,
QUESTION:

Whatever the risks are, you are willing to

MS, LEROYi

We are. Your Honor, arid we suggest that a

take them,.

large portion of those risks attributable to the United States
are relatively fixed and are relatively calculable and can be
equitably apportioned along with the fish between Idaho, Oregon
and Washingtono
QUESTION;

Mr, ilttorney Genferal, I take it

and

perhaps I am wrong — are you giving up any theory of waiver on the
part of the United States?
MR, LEROY:

No, Your Honor, we are not at alio

We have

argued in our brief and have argued this morning before the Court
that the presence of the administrative Procedure Act on the
books of the United States Code and the combination of beginning
and developing judicial precedent applying that act to Acts of
the United States, including operations of the —
QUESTION:

Well, can you explain the way the language

in Section 702 of the APA that refers to agency action?
MR, LEROY:

Well, Your Honor, we can and we can’t.

The statute goes on to mention a number of other things and in
some respects agency action, we would urge, includes all manner of

14

action by the officers, agents^ employees of the United States
Government=
But our basic concern in this matter —*
QUSSTIONs

Before you get on to that, supposing before

the passage of the Federal Tort Claims Act in 1946 the Attorney
General of the United States had been sued in a District Court for
a tort incurred by the Act which later would have been covered by
the Federal Tort Claims act, he simply asserts sovereign immunity0
He said whether we were negligent, grossly negligent or reckless®
you can't sue the United States because Congress has not given its
censento
Are you suggesting that under the Administrative
Procedure Act that could be reviewed by the Court?
MHo LEROY;

We are suggesting that the Administrative

Procedure Act by its very terms is limited to non-monetary damages
and that in this case we have a classic action or failure to act
in an official capacity if there b® some threat to the anadromous
fish by the operation of the daas, by something that is done
off the Pacific Coast fishery.,
QUESTION;

So the Court could tell the United States

even though the United States had said, we will not waive our
sovereign immunity, a Court could say, yes, you must waive your
sovereign immunity0
MR, LEROY:

We would urge the fact that -Justice cannot

refuse or reserve what Congress has already waived.

15

QUESTIONt

XS

the United States intervened here and

stated its own claim, it would not he a matter of waiving immunity?
MRo LEROY:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, I would think that -Because it has -— the agencies have no power

to waive immunity but they could have power to bring this lawsuit t,
or bring a lawsuit?
MRo L3R0Y:

Yes, 'Your Sonor,

But what we argue from that

is that even should this Court judge the United States a necessary
party, that at worst Idaho should be allowed to amend its pleading
because of that concept of sovereign immunity, which we urge it
has been waived by Congress0
Frankly, we would also invite the attention of the
Court to the method and the purpose of the attempted exercise of
non-intervention by the Solicitor»

In California ve Arizona the

focus of that congressional waiver, or focus of that case was
congressional waiver by statute»
of

&

In this case, the same side

similar coin, by split decision the Department of Justice

chose not to be involved in the matter»

Now, we don't suggest

that Justice should not have that authority, but the preliminary
policy determination foy Justice, Exhibit C to the Idaho brief,
shows that the rationale for that legal decision was to avoid
short-term political inconvenience»
The Court, we suggest, should appropriately comment,
perhaps use the Florida v» Georgia procedural device; but in any
event, do what it can to avoid damaging this precious natural

16

resource by looking behind that legal tactic in a sense* for that
legal tactic is not consistent with overall national public
policyo
QUESTION:

May 2 inquire a little more on the subject of

i®dispensability you touched but not really covered exhaustively*
as 2 understand it0
Supposing you got an order that said that Oregon arid
Washington shall take a smaller share of the fish before they
reach the Bonneville dam»

They say* well* maybe we will do that

but then the Indians will take a larger share when they are passlag through Zone 6 and no more' fish will get to Idaho when every­
thing is all done»
How in this case can the Court enter an order which
would give Idaho more fish?
MRc. L3E0Y:

Your Honor, the Sohappy and tJ0 So v» Oregon

decisions bind the Indians to a 50-percent treaty right share fey
decree»

The voluntary agreement which I mentioned varies that

figure froia 40 to 60 percent, depending on the specific run of
fish»
QUESTIONS

As & practical matter as they go through

Seme 6 don°t they assume 50 percent has been taken out by Oregon
and Washington before the fish get there?
MR» LEROY:

Your Honor* that 50 percent is projected

under the voluntary agreement into a matrix of specific numbers of
fish, .for the specific runs and a specific entitlement to each

17

f i, shery„
So we urge that the same way * that a a escapement a
minimum number for preservation of the species is allowed through
Zone So
QUESTION:

Just so 1 can understand it» when those

numbers are fixed ■ do they fir the .numbers that the Indians can
take when the fish go through Zone 67
MRo LSROY:

Yes,•Your Honor, that is my understanding of

the structure,
QUESTION:

So, what you are saying is that basically

they would reduce the Oregon and Washington numbers without affect-"
lag the Indian numbers and there would therefore b© a margin left
over that has still survived os over the dam?
MRo LEROY:

Exactly0

And to the extent that the Indians

over-fished above those numbers they would fee subjected to
possible enforcement of and requirement that the benefits pass
through by intervention of Idaho for the limited purpose of
assuring that the benefits come to Idaho?
QUESTION:

Mr, Leroy, Judge Breifcenstein has used the

term "indispensable party,“ and I think you responded to an earlier
question of mine that since the amendment of °'66 that ter® is no
longer used in the rules?

'boes that have any bearing on youz

case?

'v’""
MR0 LEROY:

earlier question

Your Honor, as I suggested in answer to your

we feel that the Master’s focus

regardless of

18

'cera» was the adequacy of the judgment.»

One of his problems was

tbs problem that we just discussed that the Idaho benefit as to
the Indian rights could not pass through.,

I have attempted to

suggest that is fact it would be a pass through just as the
escapement is and Idaho could enforce that by intervention if it
s© had to»
In additiony the operation of the dams by the United
States in a specific fishery we suggest are factually irrelevant
to the relief that we seek and so I would not follow the Court9s
reasoning in suggesting that the term be d-ifferent'but in fact the
adequacy of the judgment can be preserved regardless ©£ the term*
We argue also that the Master was incorrect in suggest­
ing that the operation of the United States of dams — eight dams
on the Columbia River made them a party whose presence is required
in this lawsuito

There are eight dams6

Those dams each create'

reservoirs or pools, they create spills, they have fish ladders®
they alter stream flows® and all of those factors kill f isho
But in a sense of relevancy to this matter and interrelationship,
that problem® the mortality of the fish® in that fashion is not
relevant to the relief sought or the judgment requested in this
CslSSo

•The focus here is the equitable apportionment between
the three States of adult fish regardless of whatever supply that
reenter the Columbia River at its mouth on their up turn® upstream migration.,

At the mouth of the Columbia River for the

19

first time these fish become the subject of commercial and
sport fishery in the river; and for the first time they become
subject to an actual count which can be apportioned between.o
Thus., we urge that the Masterus concern with the
operations of the dam as to downstream migration is irrelevant0
It may affect the total supply but it does not relate to the
right of a portion of those adult fish reentering which we
seek,
As to the upstream migration» three factors make
that factually irrelevant as well,,

"She apportionment occurs

at and before the first dam, thus 0«So operations are not in
a position fc© affect the calculation of the basic equities and
numbers between the States»

Secondly, the upstream losses are

certain, are capable of calculation and thus can be factored
into a scheme of equitable apportionment, much as this Court

P
has done in some water loss and water passage cases0

And

i

third, the Federal statutes as judicially interpreted requite

S'

a sensitivity by the United States Government, particularly the'
;!

Ma-iiCffious Fish Act, and subject the United States to waiver
so that any inappropriate activity cutting off, in effect®
a share of benefit that should be- passed to Idaho in the
upstream dam we urge can fee attacked in the courts and
prevented as a loss to IdahoQ
And the third point upon which we suggest the Master
was not correct in his ruling is that the ocean management and

20

the ocean fishery management, made the United States in some
way iadispensableo

The ocean catch occurs exclusively between

3 and 200 miles under the authority of the Secretary of
Commerce,, it. is regulatedo

Idaho sits on a specific regional

fishery management council as a full voting member along with
Oregon and Washington»

.and neither the Secretary. nor the

. council has any authority in the river itself o
Where we are concerned with^only after river entry
of adults and only as to those adults does Idaho make any
equitable claim»

Thus the ocean fishery and the ocean regulation

may again affect the total supply available but it is not
i

relevant to the allocation of the adults that have already
returned to the rivera
Thuss we would urge that an adequate judgment can fee
had and the United States® interests are not so linked to the
relief sought that the Master’s conclusion has compelled»
In additions we'would urge to the Court that
complexity is not a problem in this case»

This is akin and

actually simpler than many of the water apportionment cases
which this Court has heard®

It is an established legal

proposition of this Court in original jurisdiction cases where
efforts to settle have failed,, where a genuine coatroversy
exists and where the gravity and importance of the case are
evident? complexity is not &'■ proper justification to refuse
to exercise the constitutional function

»

21

QUESTION: . Mr, Leroy, are you suggesting that, the
United states simply be left out as a party involuntarily and
that your case proceed against Idaho and Washington?
MRo LEROY:

Yes5 Your Hosorj that would be our

first

prayer for relief and, in addition, we would say there are
procedural devices available to involve' the United States as
aaicus or that in any event the case ought to be allowed for
a amabar ©£ reasons0

;

The decree sought is. this case is a final judicial
judgment of three components;
Humber one, a -declaration of Idaho1© entitlement to
as equitable apportionment is certain fish?
Secondly, an establishment of as approximate percent*»
age based on scientific evidence of each species? and
Third, the projection of those percentages into a
set of figures and structures decreeing basic numbers of fish,
depending on sine of- the run under two conditions:

poor

passage where many of the fish will not get upstream® and
under good passage where most of the fish in relative terms
will get upstreamo
We would also urge the Court that continuing juris­
diction is no problem,,

The Court has retained its jurisdiction

where necessary for modifications or amendments in equitable
apportionment cases*

But this Court has avoided involving

itself in active, «daily supervision and nonjudicial style

22

functions»

There is nothing about this as the basic

apportionment case or from the type of decree sought, that
would require this Court*s active daily supervision»

In

facts as 1 have suggested,, the Columbia River compact exists
though Idaho has for 60 years attempted to become a member of
that compact unsuccessfullyo

That compact has to this day and

does now serve as between Oregon and Washington the source of
expert administrations mutual accommodation0
& decision by this Court establishing Idaho8s
equitable apportionment will for the first time in those 60
years remove the political disincentives of Oregon and
Washington and likely a three-member compact

!■

-should an

invitation to Idaho be forthcoming may never be back in this
Court again for any kind of administration»
QUESTION;

I take it you feel that Idaho has been

pushed around by these two larger States?
MHo LEROY;

Your Honor, we do0 and it is in that

spirit of frustration and for that simple purpose^because there
is ao mutual accommodation otherwise availables that Idaho in
1875 filed this action»
In conclusion we would suggest to the Court, that
this is a novel and important case regarding a precious resource
of migratory fish which have an instinct to return upstream to
the waters of their adolescence to bear young»
Idaho has no means of achieving through the political

23

system what it' seeks through the courts in this mattero

The

Federal Government has no authority to apportion fishery ia
the Columbia River and asserts none and need not be a full
partyo

Washington and Oregon alone at this point have regulated

the non-treaty bound anadromous fishery where fish are coming
and hope to come to Idah©0

The inequitable results of the

defendants® activity in regulating and managing that fishery
have caused Idaho to seek both equity and justice before this
Court in the forum provided by Article 3* Clause 2 s Section 2
of the Constitutiono
QUESTION:

Are there any other interior States in

which there are anadromous fish that return to spawn,, such as
Wyoming?

QUESTION:

Mr» Leroy, before you stop is it possible

—- and maybe this is unrealistic question — to give me some
indication of what.percentage of the run Idaho is now getting
and what percentage of the run it hopes to get if it is totally
successful in this litigation?
MS» LEROY;

Your Honor, the pleading alleges that we

produce for two of those specific runs between 50 and 60 percent
of the. fish and that we receive back in the aeighboi-hood of 20
percento
&s I suggested and as the Master has heard, same of
the merits to this point simply because of the interrelationship
of Federal rights-we have not fully explored at this point on
>'

/

the record the kinds of relief and the kinds of numbers that
Idaho would seek to establish by expert testimony»
QUESTION:

This 20 percent figure» that is the per­

cent of the fish that originate in Idaho and return to Idaho»
that is not the percent that are caught by your fishermen» is
it?
MR, LEROY:

Your Honor» I a® sorry; would you restate

the question?
QUESTION:

What does the 20 percent refer to?

Is

that the percent that actually get back to Idaho or is that the
percent of the run that are caught by fishermen in Idaho?
MR» LEROY:
that return»

Ho» Your Honor» it would be the

Mr0 Attorney General

Redden„
ORAL ARGUMENT OF.JAMES A0 REDDEN, ESQo,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS
MR.

REDDEN:

Mr0 Chief Justice, and may it pleas® the

Court:
The State of Idaho argues essentially that the States
of Washington and Oregon in their non~ Indian, non-fee commercial

27
fishery in the lower Columbia River are imperiling the fish
that otherwise and should otherwise go to the Snake River in
the State of Oregon0

The State of Idaho today referred to

the sports fishery but as the Master°s report finds there is
no evidence in the record that the sports fishery has any
real impacto

It is in terms of numbers an ineffective fishery

on the Columbia River0

So ve are talking essentially about

the commercial fishery, by Idaho3s ©wn arguments not the
Indian commercial fishery but the non-Indian, non-treaty
commercial fishery which takes place in one area in the entire
Columbia River Basin, and that is the 130 river-miles between
the mouth of the Columbia River and. Bonneville Bam, the first
of the eight obstacles between the ocean, and the eighth dam
on the Snake River0
QUESTION:

As I understand it P in that area the

Indians don01 have any treaty rights»
HRo REDDENS

That is correct, Your Honoro

The

Indians do not fish in that area»
QUESTION:
HRo REDDEN:

Up to Bonneville D&m0
That is correct, although there is

litigation now with the Yakimas attempting to assert their
rights to fish in the lower river, but that is —
QUESTION;
MRo REDDEN:
QUESTION:

But as of now the Indians —
They have no such rights declared,,
You said that is 130 miles»

28

One hundred and thirty miles,

MRo REDDEN:
QUESTION:

And that is where the non-treaty commercial

fishery takes place,
MRo REDDEN;

The noa-treaty commercial fishery's that

fishery is not a fishery upon the stocks of which Idaho seeks
an apportionmento

The fact of the matter is that the fishery

in the lower Columbia River is a commercial target fishery and
fish which are destined for the lower Columbia River and
tributaries in the lower Columbia River0
QUESTION:

And that fishery» that is in both States,

Oregon and Washington?
MR, REDDEN:
Washington,

That is in both States, in Oregon and

And we share seasons and rules and regulations,

QUESTION:

Is that stretch of the river the boundary

between the two States?
MR, REDDEN:

Yes, it is, Your Honor; it is the

boundary between both States,
QUESTION:

What is it that prevents those fish from

ever getting to Idaho?
MR, REDDEN:

Well, because by the nature of the fish

itself they are spawned or hatched in the lower Columbia River
and that is the area to which they return,

Anadromous fish

will not return to an area other than that area where it was
hatched.

These fish, which our commercial fishermen fish

in the lower Columbia River, were hatched or spawned in the

29

lower Columbia Rii^er or its tributaries0 and hence do not seek
nor would they be able to know how to go across Bonneville Dam
or the other dams0

actiono

QUESTION :

You are arguing the merits of *—

QUESTION:

That is the merito

QUESTION:

Whether this complaint states a cause of

I guess you are arguing your exceptions to this Specie

Master, aren’t you?
MRo REDDEN:

Well, Your Honor, I think that it has

to be brought into perspective because of Idaho0s argument that
what they seek is a reasonable and fair and equitable apportion
sent of this share of fish which are not destined for Idaho9s
waters in the first place.
QUESTION:
MRo REDDEN:

That isnat what the Special Master says0
The Special Master in his report does

point out that the non-treaty commercial fishery is limited
to the lower Columbia Rivor and that the Indian commercial
fishery, a substantial and significant fishery, is in that
area above Bonneville Dam.

But this litigation, as the Master

points out deals with three specific runs of anadxomous fi3h.
and those three specific runs are the summer Chinook salmon,
the up-river spring Chinook salmon and the summer steelhead,
the prime game fish.

Idaho claims then that our fisherys

our rules and regulations or maintenance of that fishery is
such that they are done out of their fair and equitable share

30
Oil Summer chinook salmon * there has not been a non-treaty
commercial fishery on summer chinook salmon for 16 years,
none»
QUESTION:

But that doess!t prove that there couldn't»

That is a question of facto

X mean that is not a jurisdictional

question to be discussed in a motion here* I wouldn°t think0
HE0 REDDEN:

But, Your Honor, the contention of Idaho

is that we — and the reason we are here before this Court is
that Idaho is claiming that we as a jurisdictional matter,
that they have a right to fish, that we are over-fishing and
destroying in the lower river,
QUESTION:

But are the nine members of this Court

sufficiently expert in the habits of aaadromous fish to know
whether or not these particular fish you are talking about would
or would not return to Idaho or go back to Idaho?
MR, REDDEN;

Well, Your Honor, in the complaint in.

the brief filed by the State of Idaho it is these three runs
which they say, to which they claim their apportionment, their
entitlement, and their rights,
QUESTION:

If the case went forward these matters

would certainly be litigated, there is no question about that.
And you seem to be arguing here that we should just dismiss
the case, not because of indispensability but just because
Idaho hasn*t got any claim on, that it can really have any profit
ia»

31

ME® REDDEN:

Yes, Your Honor*

Then I will argue or

urge that: this Court adopt the Master’s report, that as a
matter of fact the United States is indispensable, a term used
by this Court this year in the 1979 case of Arizona v*
California*

But we urge the United States is indispensable

really on three specific grounds*

One is their role as

proprietor —»
QUESTION:

Mr* Attorney General, there seem to be

some hint that there is a difference between necessary parties
and indispensable parties*

Do you see a difference"or are

they essentially .synonymous?
MSo REDDEN:

Aelsta'iry, X think they are? I think
.j

they are, Your Honor*
QUESTION:

■
If they are necessary, they are

indispensable; and if they are indispensable, they are necessary*
That is my point*
ME* REDDEN:
QUESTION:

That is my contention*
How can you say that after the *66

amendments which prior to 1966 definitely classified parties*
One class was necessary, another class was indispensables and
their characteristics were quite different*

la the 1966

amendments you come along and dispense with word "indispensable"
entirely*
MR* SEBBEH:

Well, Your Honor, if the United States

is not an indispensable party, which is the term used by the

32

Master in this case, then under that rule they are necessary0
Under Part 33 where it says that a party is in fact necessary
if the decree in order to be adequate must bind that party»
QUESTION:

Well, you may well be right on that»

ail

I am suggesting is that even, in pre~I966 terminology there was
a great deal of difference between a necessary party and a
indispensable partyo
MRo REDDEN;

But we cannot see how a decree can be

framed in any way to be adequate in terms of equity and good
conscience without that decree binding the United States as
its role as proprietor of the dams, its guardian of the
Indians or its sovereign over the ocean fishery»,

There is

simply no way, and- the Master as a matter of fact does allude
to this and points this out in his reporto

Although he

first says that because Idaho does not claim a share of the
Indian fishery, that the Indians do

not be partiess the

Master does in his arguments and comments regarding what he
terms indispensability» does refer to the necessity of
apportioning a share of the Indian fishery simply in order to

keep that cheeho
QUESTION t

But Idaho says s well-, sure, the United

States may run these dams so that the relief we get, if we
get any relief, might not be as good as it might otherwise
be and sure, the Indians may fish for more fish than they are
entitled to under the decree entered in another case»

But

33
that is no reason s, it is argued,, saying the United States is
either necessary or indispensable,

Idaho is willing to take

that risko
Mo REDDER:

Well, Your Honor, we submit that the

decree to which Idaho would risk being entered in this case
in the instance of the dams is one example, if it 'did not bind,
the United States Government it would not provide an additional
apportionment,

So the risk they are willing to take is --

QUESTION:

Spell that out for me,

MR, REDDEN:

All right.

If we take an example of

10.0 anadroffi-aus fish which are in fact headed for the upper
river,

letcs for the purpose of this example;, let us say „

.
that there is no fishery -**» commercial, non-commercial, Indian®

sport -<» of any kind on those 100 fish® only 85 of those fish

are going to survive Bonneville Dam on the way up5 and only
72 at the Dalles Dam; 61, John Day Dam;
QUESTION:

52® McNary Dam --

Yes,

MR, REDDEN:

— and of the remaining 52, 20 will not

even go up the Snake River,

-

Of those 22 that go up the Snake®

20 will survive Vice Harbors 17, Lower Monumental; 14, Little
Bruce .Dam; and 12® Lower Granite Dam® the last dam on the Snake
River,
QUESTION:

That is the merit,

MS, REDDEN:

But* Your Honor, coming back down the

figures are even more devastating and unless the Court can enter

34

a decree, can bind the United States on its control of the
dams * whether to use the spillway or the turbines* whether
to create power for the Northwest ~QUESTXON:
now

Mr» attorney General, the Idaho says

I don * t Jen ow whether this is a fact or not, but the

Attorney General said that 20 percent of the fish that originate
in Idaho get back to Idaho„

So some fish get there0

they just think that more should be released»

And

If you release
I

200 instead of 100, yon are going to have more fish reach

MR» REDDEM:

Well* Your Honor* if the desire of the

State of Idaho is to increase or enhance the release of smelt
in the Snake River solely because that will automatically
in some fashion result in an increase in the fishery* I suggest'
.

to this Court that we do not need a decree of this Court to
provide for thatD

What we need is cooperation which now goes

on between the Federal Government and the three States0

QUESTION:

MRo REDDEN;

May it please the Court* I think the

history of the interstate compact might be helpful here»

The

State of Oregon did as a matter of fact pass a compact bringing

Idaho into that compact several sessions agoc

The State of

Idaho did not pass it; they rejected it os the grounds that
they Tvould have but one vote of three and that if they did not
have e super vote — that is aJ*disproportionately heavy vote —
their participation would be useless because there would be
one sport versus two commercial0

The State of Washington did not pass

QUESTION:

MR, REDDEN:

A combination is possible and a combination

is occurring in the agreement in the United States v® the State
of Oregon ease, incidentally, in which Idaho petitioned to inter­
vene a few weeks ago on a limited basis0

In that case that

agreementt which is part of this record, reflects that the

the Snake River in Idaho®
The States of Washington and Oregon share 200 miles
of the Snake River with Idaho as border®

The fishermen, sports

fishermen in the States of Oregon and Washington fish the Snake

We are vitally concerned not only with the sports

fishery for our sports fishermen and Idaho®s but also are
concerned vitally with the necessity for the escapement for

Which District Court was that?
That i3 the District Court for Oregon0
Attorney General9 may I go back to the

question, of indispensability for a minute»
As I -understand Idaho°s story, they say we don01 get
enough fish because some fish are lost over the daas, there
is some over-fishing by Indians, and there is some over-fishing
in Oregon and Washington»

So we can*t do anything about the

first two items because of the sovereign immunity»

But we

can do something about over-fishing in Oregon and Washington»
Just let us get that much»
Why is the United States indispensable under that
part of their claim?
HR, REDDEN:

Because, Your Honor, the fish runs upon

which Oregon and Washington fish, those runs on which Oregon —=
or Idaho insists that Oregon and Washington over-fish are runs
not destined to the State of Idaho»
QUESTION:

If we accept the allegations of the

38

complaint» because the case hasn't been tried yet, we can't
accept .your statement0 because' they have alleged to the

All of the

from the Master’s report,
QUESTIONS

But that isn’t the same thing as to point­

ing to a particular factual finding in the Master0s report as

^

requested by Justice Stevens that squarely hits the nail on the
head,
MS, REDDEN;

The Master’s report does speak of the

mortality rats of the fish going up river»

It does

39

speak of the mortality rate coming down river»

It does speak

of the significance of the Indian fishery and the Master does
say in his report, express the opinion that an adequate
apportionment cannot be made without taking into consideration
the Indians0

Because as the share* as the Master points out

in that report, the fishery of the Indians has increased from
39*000 pounds in 1959 to 3 million pounds»
QUESTION:

Mr„ Attorney General, suppose the United

States had moved to intervene before the Special Master and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE •GORTON* ESQo ,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS
MRe GORTON:

Mr» Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
Hro Justice White, you are of course correct in the
posture of this case as it appears before us0

Nov/, the question

is whether or not the United States is indispensable and in
that respect basically whether or not a decree can be fashioned
which is fair to the litigants who are now in the case other
than the United States„ which of course is not in the case
itselfo
The factual statements about this however is not la
the same posture as it was when we were here four years ago®
because the Special Master has found quite precisely a set of
facts about the three runs which are the subject of Idaho“s
complainto
It is important to have a little bit more in the way .
of factual background about the Columbia River to understand
those three runs0

And

QUESTION:

Do you agree with the answer of your

colleague to my last question to him?
MRo GORTON:

Except if the United States had coste­

in would the Special Master have gone forward with this sasee
QUESTION:

He would have gone forward with this case,

I agree with that pert of Mr. Redden0s answer, but not with the

41

answer that: the only question before him was a remedy,,

There

was a question before hi© as to whether there was a rights
QUESTION:

You are going to argue that the Special

Master would have found for Oregon and Washington or **MR, GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR, GORTON:

No,
■—» on the merits0
There is no point in my arguing that to

you now,
QUESTION:
MR, GORTON:

There certainly iss'to
And there isn't that aov.

So the question before the Special Master would have
been not only whether or not there is a remedy but whether or
not there is a right in the State of Idaho,
QUESTION:

Exactly,

Exactly,

And is that what yfim

want to argue, whether there is a right?
MR, GORTON:

Nof I do not wish to argue that question

because it is not before you,

I wish to argue that the United

States is indispensable in this litigation in even that
preliminary question of whether or not there is a right0 much
less a remedy,

And in order to understand the indispensability

of the United States one must understand something at least
about, the way in which anadromous fish operate, bath going
downstream on the Columbia River and upstream on the Columbia,
QUESTION:

Mr* -Justice White's question is wholly

irrelevant in the sense that if the United States had not

42

raised an objection as being an indispensable partys the
Master would have gone ahead and tried the oase„
MR0 GOKTCH:
here to that®

Of course he would and we wouldn't be

We might have been hare at some later time but

we wotildn*t be here now„

We are here because we don't feel

that justice can be done to us even in the determination of a
right, .much less a remedy0 whatever that determination may be,
in the absence of the United States; and that for a very good
and sufficient reason <,

Part of that reason has to do with

the fact that there are many runs of fish in the Columbia
Rivero

Some of them never would never go above Bonneville

Dam in any event and are subject to a major Oregon and
Washington commercial fishery„

Some which go above the

Bonneville Daas and at this point they are pretty much missed
togetherf areast going up the Snake Rivero-

They go up the main-»

stream of the Columbia River and stay in the State of Washingtosi
would never leave it * leave it under any circumstances 0
They have already crossed four dams by the time they get to
the confluence of the Snake and the Ccluzafoiae

hnd Some of

course continue up the Snake at which point they would
y

*

eventually, if nothing else happened to the®,, get back to
the border of Idaho and Oregon and Washington and go on up
to some other point higher on the Snake Riverc
The point is that the reason that these fish do not
get back to Idaho is hardly within the control of the State

43

of Washingtono

And by the findings of this Special Master

the States of Oregon and Washington for all practical purposes
are not and have not for years fished on those runs0
Now. the Special Master has found that there hasn°t
been a summer season for commercial summer Chinook — one of

these three things -- sinrce'~1964o
summer Chinook?

You need a lawsuit over

We just haven51 been fishing fchesa0

QUESTIONS

Well, you are just saying you are bound

to in your suit before the Special Master»
MSo GORTOH:

No, I am not, Your Eonor»

If you will

give me a moment, Mr« Justice White, I will tell you why it
is that the United States is indispensable and this is an
element of it0

The United States is indispensable for summer

chinook because that run has been destroyed or almost destroyed
not by any action of the State of Washington but by actions of
the United States GovernmentD
QUESTION:

But the Special Master coaid come out

differently with respect to Indian rights than some of the
previous decisions since 1964»
MR» GORTON:

He might very well0

And if he does,

the Indians certainly ought to be represented in the litigation
in which he coses out with that kind ©f judgment0
If there is a right in the State of Idaho, if there
is a right at all, the right that they are alleging here, that
right can only come out of fish to which something else is

happening at the present time,
QUESTION:
HR, GORTON:

Well, the United States can sae„
One would think, Mr» Justice RelinquishP

that the right would cease relatively equally out of the Indian
and non**Indian right»
Normally,. Idaho would have sued to have an allocation
which coses out of the entire run of fish coming up the Columbia
River0

How, under those circumstances obviously the United

States would be indispensableo
QUESTION:

Well, if the United States doesnat like

what it gets® it can sue0
HR, GORTON:

That is not the test of indispensability»

If the United States has a right, it represents the Indians and
has a right to be in the case and chooses to exercise its
sovereign immunity not to- get in the case, there can be no
decree„
But so what Idaho has done is to say, well, the
United States really isnat indispensable at all because we are
only asking a decree that affects Oregon and Washington3s son»
Indian shares of this resource»

That is the way that they

attempt to avoid the indispensability of the United States in
this case.
But under the agreement which Oregon and Washington
and the United States and the Indians have made in this case,
if there is not just an absolutely fixed percentage allocation.

45

ao much of a percentage to the Indians and so much a percent­
age to the'noa-Indians, there is a great deal of language ~~
as a matter of. fact# the basis of that agreement in one sense
anticipates your decision last summer in UsSo v<> Washington„
QUESTION:

Why shOaid that agreement between four

parties bind a fifth party who is not a party to it?
MR. GORTON:

We doa't believe that it binds the

fifth party# which is not a party to it at alio

At one

point “*“ as recently as last summer ~~ Idaho attempted to
intervene in that case and then got back out of ifcB

We inter­

vened in the case,, the St at of Washington dido
The point that I am trying to make, because it is
the only point in front of you# is that the United States is
indispensable in order that Washington and Oregon as -well as
Idaho get justice in this case.
If a decree were entered that said that Idaho has
the right to an allocation and the right to that allocation
can be enforced only against Oregon and Washington# no justice
is done to us under those circumstances0

We have lost the

fair share of various fishing runs which we agreed with the
*

United States .in other litigation ~~ in 0oSo v0 Oregon -- that
we were entitled to.

That gives us the right to go back into

the District Court in Oregon and say under the terms -QUESTION:

Isn’t the question# Attorney General

Gorton# as to whether Oregon and Washington really were entitled

46
to all those non-treaty fish„

They certainly had a right

superior to the Indians as to —— let’s take it as hal£e
that isn’t £air0

Maybe

I understand you x*ere going to explain that

and didnnt quite get to itD
But say that the non-treaty fishermen have a right
to half of the fish and you* in effect, have got a decree that
says we can take half of the fish»

But some of those fish

maybe belong to Idaho, the non-treaty fishermen in Idaho,,
And do you have a right to preempt their access to those
fish?
MRo GORTOH:

No, Mr, Justice Stevens,

The agreement

entered in U0S0 v„ Oregon was that each party is entitled to

•

a fair share of the fish0
QUESTION?
MRo GORTONs
Rehnquisto

But Idaho wasn’t a party0
I understand that, Mr, Justice

That fair share of the fish assuming the particular

division 'which was included in that agreement which, incidentally
included in it exactly the escapement which Idaho asked us to
include in'it in these matters»-

The escapement figures in

that agreement were submitted effectively to us by Idaho as
long ago as the early 19700ss and are included ia the agree—
iaent„
Bat based on that fisheries plan we entered into
an agreement, we in Oregon, with the United States and the
Indian tribes9 for a percentage division of the rest.

That

:

47

percentage division was to create a fair share which turned
out to be your test, U.S. v. ’Washington.
2f a portion of Oregon and Washington's share is
taken away, their share is no longer fair as against the
*

Indians' themselves, we go back into courts &s3c-the court to lower
the Indians' share.
QUESTION:

Just
a moment right there.
\
\

Assume that a portion of the share now going to
Oregon and Washington was reduced and assume there were means
to insure that that would arrive in Idaho.

It would still be

fair then, wouldn't it?
MRo.GORTONNo, it would not because the definition
of the fair share entered into in the Oregon v. Washington
plan was based on certain numbers, reduced percentages.

If

the non-Indian share is reduced, vis-a-vis the non-Indian
Oregon and Washington share is reduced vis-a-vis the Indian
share, we have the clear right under that plan to go back into
the District Court and ask that the Indian share be reduced
proportionately.
QUESTION;
I don't understand it.

Then you do have a remedy in the event.
You seem to be arguing the other side

of the case now.
MRo GORTON;

In the plan in the United States v.

Oregon, Oregon and Washington have agreed to a particular
percentage of certain runs of fish.

The Indians get a certain

48
percentage.
QUESTION s.

Bo the sum of those two percentages

equal .100?
MRo GORTON:

The sum of those two percentages

equals something less than 100, because there is in addition
t

_

to that an escapement for Idaho, the escapement which Idaho
asked.
QUESTION:

And supposing that the Master tried

this case and .decided that that percentage escapement for Idaho
should be different.

Couldn't the decree in Washington be

modified to take into account that difference?
MRo GORTON:

It certainly could and if it were,

it

would reduce the Indian share proportionately with the nonIndian share, which is the reason -QUESTION:
happens.

But they won’t he heard until that

They will not be heard until that happens; and they

would be represented in the proceeding in which that happened.
MR o GORTON:
QUESTION:
in two stages.

But that -I don't understand why this can’t proceed

If the Master says instead of an escapement of

20 percent or it should foe 25 percents that reduces the amount
available.

And in this proceeding that cuts back on Washington

and Oregon and now it is up to Washington and Oregon to file
an appropriate motion in the Court in the other case and get
relief against the Indians.

49

MR, GORTON:

It seeas to me, Mr. Justice Stevens,

in phrasing that question you have phrased the answer as to
why the United States is indispensable in this litigation.
QUESTION:

To whom is it indispensable, that is

what I don51 understand.

You say it is indispensable to you.

But the only reason it is indispensable to you is you may
need their help in cutting back on the Indians.
MR. GORTON:

It is indispensable to us, of course.

It is indispensable in the phraseology of indispensable parties
now in order to prove the adequacy of the judgment in the
absence of a non-joined party.

A judgment which comes out

against the State of Washington and Oregon alone and which does
not affect the Indians is certainly not adequate as to Washington
and Oregon.

We must have Washington,

we must have the United

States in this same proceeding so that if a right to an‘Idaho
allocation is found by the Court, that right can be adequately
and with justice distributed between Washington, Oregon and
the Indians.
Moreover, the adequacy of that judgment depends on
what the United States does to allow fish to get into the
Columbia River in the first place —
QUESTIONs

I understand that.

MRo GORTON; —- in its ocean fishery.

The adequacy

of that judgment also depends on whether or not the United
States can be required in the operation of these dams to allow

50

fish to get up to Idaho in any event.
In- a case entitled Washington v. Oregon in 1936
this Court, dealing with what x*~as then an inequitable claim
by Washington to water going down the Walla Walla .River,
found that if Oregon irrigators were cut off very little of
that water would get to Washington anyway.
in the bed of the river.

It would disappear

And that it would foe inequitable

to 'give Washington a small amount of water in exchange for
the loss of a great amount of water to Oregon.
The facts as this Master has found them, the effect
of dams managed exclusively by the United States means that
an allocation of Washington and Oregon fish to Idaho would
take, a huge number of fish out of the Washington and Oregon
fisheries and produce very little.

By the

findings in this

case, it may foe one percent, maybe less than that.

But

in order to see to it that Idaho has either a right or can
enforce that right, the United States must be in this
litigation.

The issue is whether or not the United States

is an indispensable party.

Without the United States being

involved in the determination of the right in the first place,
Idaho can't get more than a very tiny percentage ©f what is
taken away from us, and that goes to the existence of the
right.
QUESTION:
other question;

Attorney General Gorton, may I ask one

Is your colleague Attorney General Redden

51
correct in saying that the only three runs are the three
that

he has identified, two salmon runs and one steelhead

run ?
MRo GORTON:
QUESTION;

Absolutely.
And that this case, r»o matter how it

is decided, x«?on! t affect the commercial fisheries in Washington
and Oregon?
MRo GORTON: It certainly will, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

You don't fish these runs.

QUESTION:

I thought you said there were -- he

said there were no commercial fisheries involved.

Maybe that

is just in Oregon.
MRo GORTON:

Idaho has no commercial fisheries.

Washington and Oregon have commercial fisheries but they do
not have commercial fisheries on these three runs except for
a very -- an extremely short one on one of the spring
Chinook a few years ago.
QUESTION:

Well, what happens to these runs,

then?

MR., GORTON:

Pardon?

What happens to these runs is they are destroyed -to the extent they are going back to Idaho, they are destroyed
by the dams of the Snake which are relatively new dams and
which are run by the United States.

That is why we have had

to cut off our fishery in the lower river.

Before those

52

clams Idaho wasn’t hers because we allowed plenty of fash to
get back up there.

We weren’t here, in any event.

But

Oregon
QUESTION:

But if commercial fisheries don't fish

these three raas, you certainly are not going to have to alter
your commercial fishing.
MRo GOETOM:

Well, Idaho has also asked that some

of the commercial fishing runs on Washington-origin fish
be'

cut off or be restricted because there is an incidental

part of some of some of these runs in them.
overlap.

The runs slightly

They would have ns, among other things, maybe lose

a hundred fish so that one fish could get back up to Idaho
because a few strays from one of these runs might still be
fit,swimming up the river at the same time of various other
runs.

That does go to the merits.
But the point is that the United States is an

indispensable party because in the state of this case with
only the States in it and not the

united States

which

controls the fisheries, the dams and of course is trustee
for the Indians, there is no possibility of a judgment of a
right or a remedy, either, which will do justice to us.

We

will simply end up losing all kinds of fish while Iddho gains
nothing.
If the United States is in the litigation —
and why it is not is for Mr. Claiborne to tell you -- if the

United States is in the litigation , then any decree which
the Court esiae out with would be enforced against everyone
who impacts the fishery.

And we might very well claim a

right to fish in the ocean which you are returning to Oregon
and Washington» which the United States ignores at the present
time.

We would be happy to litigate that with the United

States.
it.

we can’t litigate it without the United States in

Therefore we can’t be done justice in this ease without

the United States in the case.

It is an indispensable

party.
MB. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

Thanh you, Attorney

General Gorton.
Mr. Claiborne
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS Fo CLAIBORNE, ESQ.,
OKS BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
MR. CLAIBORNEs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
QUESTION;

You are going to tell U3 at some point

why the United States isn’t in, or why it doesn’t want to be
in, or whether it does want to be in, I take it?

At least,

I hope you will.
MR. CLAIBORNE;
QUESTION;

I will.

I would like to hear, Mr. Claiborne,

any additional authorities you have to cite in addition to
those of your memorandum of April 26, 1979 that indicate why

54

the United Statas as trustee for the Indians is an

indispensable party.

The cases you cited simply show the

United States as operators of reclamation projects, and so
forth, are indispensable parties.
MRo CLAIBORNE;

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I believe

Texas v. New Mexico involved the indispensability of the United
States in its role as trustee for Indian water rights.
QUESTION; ' Tex&s v. New Mexico was a one-paragraph
per curiam decided

February 25, 1957 no purported reasoning

whatever, simply a statement of a result.
MR. CLAIBORNE;

But that result Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, was based on the report of the Special Master
which had been reproduced for the convenience of the Court,
and the papers now before the Court to indicate precisely
because one couldn't judge it from the single-line per
curiam.
QUESTION:

What about Arisons v. California?

MR, CLAIBORNE:

Arisona v. California is indeed

based on the role of the United States as manager of the water,
both damsj, reclamation projects.

And I believe the Secretary

of the Interior dispensed the water and controlled its every
stage, it was viewed as impossible to have i

it not

run against him and, indeed, the ultimate decree runs
entirely Against fehe Secretary of the Interior as to what
dispens ants of water it shall make, indicates the present

55

effective rights to the respective States and other parties.
Let me address the question asked by the Chief
Justice.

The United States, as the Court is no doubt aware

in light of the documents published by Idaho, hesitated,
considered, reconsidered the question whether it should hold
its sovereign immunity as a bar to this lawsuit, feeling
some sympathy with the claim of Idaho.

At the end of the day

it was determined that the United States ought not intervene
and allow the proceeding to go forwards partly because
it was our judgment, rightly or not, that the opportunities
for an amicable accommodation of this lawsuit had not been
exhaiis ted.
The four years that have passed since this Court
last dealt with the suit have unfortunately not been occupied
in very useful negotiations between the States and the United
States.
We also took the view, perhaps wrongly, that
although Idaho would say we don't want to disturb the Indian
rights, we don't want to disturb the operation of the dams,
we don't want to in any way control the management of the
ocean fishery.

The defendant-?' tates might be fully entitled

to say those methods affect what may be a fair apportionment
of the resource because the sise of the pie has much to do
with how you fairly divide it.

And, indeed, the plan in

the District Court depends on the size of the pie as to what

56

shares go to the Indians, what share goes to the commercial
fisheries in Washington and Oregon, and what share escapes to
Idaho.
Mo one has suggested that a one-third, one-third,
one-third division, no matter what the run, is appropriate.
It does depend on how large that run is and of course the

size

of the run depends on the operation of the dams and depends
on how many fish are allowed into the
QUESTIGH;

1 would certainly think that the case

might be very different and the decree might be very different
if the United States were a party; there would be other things
that might happen.

But without it, it may be chat Oregon will

just end up with ao relief at all or it is just impossible.
They may just lose on the merits.

But I don31 understand why

whatever there is, however small the pie is, why Oregon isn't
entitled to litigate whether it is getting its fair share of
that pie.

I mean Idaho.
MRo CLAIBGRNBs

Justice White, by that test perhaps

no party would ever be indispensable.

If a party with a major

interest in the resource need not be joined, if the party
who has control over the -- that resource, its existence, the
destruction, is not a necessary party, it is hard to imagine
a ease in which a party is indispensable.

Idaho is perfectly

willing, so it tells the Court, to say, we will assume all
those risks.

57

I am not clear that Oregon and Washington are
required to take a like stance.

They may be entitled to say,

if we are going to deprive ourselves of a portion of the
fishery we presently take,, the Indians must bear a part of the

burden.
'

QUESTION:

Well, what would be the matter with

that?
MRo CLAIBORNE:

With the United States as the

trustee' for the tribes j: all the tribes themselves must be a
party to defend themselves against that -*> suggestions from
the defendant States.
If sovereign immunity has any continuing force, it
is the that a party who is indispensable and who is sovereign
need not be put to that ----QUESTIONS

The Indian tribes don't have sovereign-

immunity.
MRo CLAIBORNE:

This Court has held that they

do and they could now fee joined in this lawsuit and could the
United States.
QUESTION:

But Idaho doesn’t want the United --

hasn't asked for any relief against the United States.
MR, CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

That is so.

And nor have any Indian tribes.

So it is quite willing to take its lumps if the United States
wants to keep its head in the sand in this case.

58

MSe CLAIBORME:

The question, Mr. Justice White,

is whether that manner of focus which Idaho insists upon is
binding on the defendant States.
How, there is another complication in this case.
There is an outstanding decree of the District Court.

In

my judgment if one looks at that decree, which is reproduced
at the back of Idaho’s exceptions, that decree cannot survive
this Court’s taking jurisdiction of the case.

Because that

decree provides for a forum which is premised on accepting
escapement into Idaho.

If that is disturbed, the premises

of the decree are undermined.

And therefore the degree to

which there is a settlement between the tribes, Idaho and
Oregon — not Idaho, Washington and Oregon —* a provision
however adequate or inadequate for some escapement into Idaho
falls apart.

And that it seemed to us was a major consideration

in not inviting a new lawsuit putting everything open.
That decree, though the Master held it no bar to this
proceeding, no doubt correctly, cannot survive this proceeding.
It seems to us that the Court -~
QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, on that argument assume

there is an inequity in the esce.peaienfc figure we have now.
Should that decree survive, then?

If the premise of the

whole lawsuit is that the escapement figure is inequitable,
your argument of inequity is there is something magic about
preserving an inequity, as I ttnderstand the argument.

MR0 CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Stevens, I entirely

agree that if there is an inequity that decree cannot -QUESTION:

If the Master is capable of determining

in this proceeding whether or not there is an inequity, why
should not this case go forward to answer that question?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Stevens, my only-

counter suggestion is that that lawsuit in which all the
parties except Idaho are already before the Court and already
bound to some extent as between each other is the proper
forum and not this Court in which to make an adjustment in
favor of Idaho.
The efforts of the United States have been toward
amending the decree.
QUESTION:

How can Idaho assert in that case any

claim against two States?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
Justice White.

It could not jurisdictionally, Mr.

I am suggesting that if --

QUESTION:

That is what it wants to do.

MR, CLAIBORNEs

I appreciate that.

But if the door to this Court is closed or half
closed, Idaho may be, and the defendant States because it
is only half closed, may foe more inclined to sit down -QUESTION:

You want to keep the door closed

completely until you are ready to intervene in some lawsuit.
MR o CLAIBORNE:

If

- what we have, in effect, said

60

is that if Idaho finds the door of ail courthouses closed
after making a bona fide effort to seek an accommodated
settlement in this matter, the United States will not
indefinitely continue to block the lawsuit.
QUESTION:

Quite right. If Idaho finds the door

of this Court open, the Indians and the United States may be
a lot more tractable about their reaction to the suit in the
United States District Court and about the suit in this
Court.
MRo CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the United

States and idle tribes, both of whom are independent parties in
the District Court -- 2 can’t speak for the tribes because
some of them have indicated their unwillingness to change
the allocation to them

the United States has indicated,

that in its view there is an appropriate adjustment to be made
to the benefit of Idaho.

And that position could lead either

to consenting to the suit in this Court or, what seems to us,
that in the District Court case with a judgment already
entered a possibility of amending it there and more appropriate
supervision of all the adjustments that are required.
District Court litigation, it is the proper forum.

In that

We are

not intent on depriving Idaho of
QUESTION:

A decree could not be entered in favor

of Idaho against the other two States.
MR0 CLAIBORNE:

It could if Idaho were party by

61

agreement, just as Washington and Oregon are only both before
the same District Court because they agreed on a judgment.
Idaho could lilcewise agree on a judgment and the jurisdiction
of the Court would not therefore be asked.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Do you have anything

further* Mr. Attorney General?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID H„ LEROY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS
MRo LEROY;

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court;
I would emphasize only four points.
First* this is a narrowly drafted pleading focused
on the apportionment sought.

As the adult fish reentering

the mouth, of the Columbia River, for the first time at that
point, and for the first time only, do they become subject as
adults to fishery in the Columbia River and for the first time
they are subject of relatively precise calculation ia number.
That is the right place to determine

the equities.

Therefore,

it is irrelevant as to what the passage losses down are and,
picking up the Solicitor’s analogy, it is also irrelevant
what the losses are because in the case of the pie the. actual
weight and the actual volume of the pie may vary because of
the size.

But the basic equities of apportionment as between

those three partners will not vary, depending on the size of
the pie.

62

Secondly, we would claim only as to upstream fish
which will go over Bonneville Bam and return to Idaho.

The

Master's report specifically at page 10 found that Idaho
produces many fish and receives few.

The number of those fish

that go to Idaho and the number by the same token that stay
in Oregon and Washington are subject to calculation and can
be distributed into that equitable formula.

Third, Indian rights are not affected or attacked
«

in this litigation.

Idaho seeks distribution only from the

Oregon and Washington share.
50->percent Indian share.

We have no quarrel with the

Washington argues that Idaho should

perhaps take some of its share from both.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Attorney General, is it possible

in the management of the commercial and sports fishery below
Bonneville to effect a greater escapement of fish that would
go to Idaho without affecting an escapement of a greater
number .of fish, that would go elsewhere?
MHo LEROY:

Yes, Your Honor, we urge that it is

so possible in the short run.
QUESTION:

The attorney Geaeral of the State of

Washington seemed to be arguing that there would have to be
an escapement ©f a great many other fish that were never
destined for Idaho.
MS, LEROY:

We are not certain on the merits,

once we hear the evidence that that would be so, Your Honor.

63

But in any event, -QUESTIOH:
MRo LEROY;

That is part of the merit.
Yes.

In any event, should the Court so conclude a part
of that equitable apportionment in the short range, a part
of that additional escapement could possibly be made up out
of the Xdaho-Oregon-Washington share.

The Sohappy litigation

In the State of Oregon adjudicated not just the Indicin rights
as against Oregon and Washington and its residents but as
against all non-Indian, non-treaty persons regardless of
their domicile.

Thus it is our contention that the Idaho

share should properly foe taken out of the Oregon and Washington
•\

share alone.
And fourth, I would direct the Court’s attention
to QUESTION;

How are these three runs reduced by

j
the commercial or sports fishery below Bonneville?

;MR» LEROY;

There is an extremely complex set of

figures.
V

QUJSSTIQM;

I take it that the commercial fishery

doesn’t affect these three runs.

At least that is not the

major focus of the commercial fishery.
MR, LEROY;

Your Honor, it would fee our contention

that the commercial fishery does affect these three runs.
QUESTION;

How else are the runs affected by fish-

64

lag?
MRo LEROY:

And, in addition, the record will show

that there is substantial sports fishery in that first five
zones cosing in from the Columbia River as well under the
exclusive regulation of Oregon and Washington.

So we would

urge that both the propositions, sports fishery which is even
less selective in some respects than the commercial fishery
are threats to Idaho and threats that need to be addressed
in this litigation.
QUESTION:

Of course it may turn out that Washington

and Oregon, either commercially or sportswise, aren't really
affecting your three runs substantially?
MR» LEROY:

Your Honor, we are more than willing

to explore that should the Court give us the opportunity.
Our fourth and final point would be this, that
the wasted philosophy discussed by Oregon, the sense that if
Oregon and Washington let them go by, that commercial fishery
zone some will die and some will not go to Idaho and therefore
they are wasted, is precisely the kind of short-term, short­
sighted over-harvest in the name of waste that brings us t©
this Court.

Gentlemen of the Court, there is no possibility

of mutual accommodation on that basis.

There is no possibility

of mutual accommodation in this matter without a judgment of
this Court, and this is the last courthouse and the last
courthouse door.

65
We would urge the Court to avoid a needless and
unfortunate technical dismissal in this original juris­
dictional matter.

We would earnestly petition the Court

to allow this case to proceed to the merits so that no man
on the Columbia River will ever say that his net has caught
the last living steelhead.
Thanh you.
MSo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGES:

Thank yoa, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:21 o’clock a.xa. , the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
