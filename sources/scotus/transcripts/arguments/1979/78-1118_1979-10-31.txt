MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear argumenta

next in 78-11189 Forsham v. Harris.
Mr. Sonnenrelch, I think you may proceed whenever
you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. SONNENREICH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SONNENREICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court;
The issue before the Court In our o&se is whether
certain scientific records that are presently located in a
Maryland bank vault are federal records and are disclosable
under the Federal Freedom of Information Act.
The Committee for the Care of the Diabetic, of
which petitioners are members, initiated a formal Freedom
of Information Act request from the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare In 197*1 for data resulting from a
v !,

scientific study which has been called the UGDP Study.
The study involves the treatment and evaluation of the
treatment of diabetes.
This request was denied administratively and we
filed an action with the District Court in the District
of Columbia.

Our request for relief was denied by Judge

Corcoran in that court, denied essentially on the grounds
that the federal government did not possess the data and

5
therefore the request for UGDP records In the court’s
3 udgraent were not agency records.

In the U.S. Court of Appeals, we again were de­
nied on a 2-fco-l decision the release of th® data, but
all three judges rejected th© strict possession property
test called upon by the lower court.

Judge Leventhal in

the majority opinion set a standard where h© defined
UGDP records to Include records created or obtained by an
agency in the course of doing its work.

In elaborating on

this test, he stated that agency records are not limited
to the physical possession of an agency but it can include
the records which ar© created and held by private entities
where the agency is involved In the course planning or
execution of th® program.
Judge MacKinnon in his concurrence also stated
that agency records can include those created by private
entities and said that th© determination of whether or not
the agency records must be made will be done on a factual
basis.
Judge Baselon dissented and stated that the
records created by private »• held by private entities
are agency records when the government has been signifi­
cantly involved in the study and its records.

What is

interesting --*»
QUESTION:

What would be involved beyond finances

6
or aro they limited to finances and definition of the
project?
MR. SONNENREICH:

Ho, Mr. Chief Justice, they

are essentially — we have set it out in our brief at
pages 53 through 55, but essentially there are four major
factors that shov? government Involvement.
question of funding.

The first is a

We have demonstrated in the brief,

and we are going to discuss this, that we not only have a
funding over a period of more than fifteen years, we not
only have a funding where the exclusive funding agency is
the federal government and the amount involved was in ex­
cess of $15 million, but in addition the government also
funded the planning grants, a two-year planning grant to
Initiate the study.
Another factor that ims extremely important in
terms of showing involvement is the fact that the monitor­
ing and the supervision by the National Institutes of Health
in the project itself.

We have demonstrated In our case,

in our brief that involvement, some of that involvement
Is instructive to the Court.
For example, they establish the Policy Planning
Board and they put members of the National Institutes of
Health on that board, one of the senior officials being
the chairman of the board.

They were very actively Involved

in analyzing and evaluating the actual planning and policy

7
of the study.
More important in respect to that second factor was
that the board met regularly at the National Institutes of
Health to review the actual progress of the study, which in and
of itself was unusual.

More unusual still was that NIH, be­

cause of some of the questions that had been raised, went out­
side and contracted with an independent group of statisticians,
the Biometric Society, to actually go in and evaluate the raw
data of the study.

This is not a usual activity on the part

of the National Institutes of Health or of HEW.

As a matter

of fact, Dr„ Donald Whedon in this memorandum, in his affi­
davit before the lower court so stated that that is, in fact,
a very rare occurrence.
A third important factor to show the substantial
Government involvement was by the action of the Government in
terms of regulatory action.

What is important is that while

the National Institutes of Health were monitoring and super­
vising the study, another sub-agency of HEW, the Food and Drug
Administration, began to take a series of very significant
steps in reliance on this study.
In 1970 the FDA sent the series of drug bulletins to
all physicians in the United States advising them of the find­
ings of the study and warning them about its implications in
the treatment of their diabetic patients.

These bulletins were

8
then followed by the Food and Drug Administration making a
proposed rule relabeling the oral hypoglycemias by inserting a
warning based on this UGDP study.

This proposal was first

discussed by the FDA in 1972 and was finally proposed in 1975.
In 1977 , in direct reliance, the Secretary of IIEW
proposed that the drug, one of the drugs in the UGDP study,
phenforrain, be suspended from the marketplace.

Again, the

Secretary relied heavily on the UGDP data and the UGD!*3 study.
From all of these regulatory activities, ranging from
official bulletins of the FDA that went directly to physicians
to proposed rule-making to regulatory proceedings, the Govern­
ment relied heavily on the UGDP as the justification for its
actions.

But the most important of these effects is the

fourth and final factor that I think is clear showing of re­
liance on the part of the Government, and that is when the
Government itself through the FDA decided to audit the raw
data.
QUESTION:

Let me back up a little bit.

Is this

fundamentally a statutory construction case for the Court?
MR. SONNENREICII;

To a certain extent, ves, Your

Honor.
QUESTION;

Well, what else is it besides a statu­

tory construction case?
MR. SONNENREICH:

What has happened is that the lower

9
courts have been evolving a series of standards because the
statutory language, it does not speak directly to what con­
stitutes agency records and what is before this Court, peti­
tioners contend, is trying to amalgamate or define with more
precision what it is, what tvpa of test has to be utilised
now in terms of determining what are agency records.
QUESTION:

Then are vou asking us to do anvthing ex­

cept to construe the statute?
MR. SONNENREICH:

No, Your Honor.

We3re asking you

to define that test by construing the statute.
QUESTION:

But you tell us very early in your brief

that in this case, we can't rely on the statutory language.
MR. SONNENREICH:

The statxitory language in this

particular ease, Your Honor, is silent on what constitutes
Agency records.

What has happened is that the Courts have

had to evolve a series of tests to determine what those ac­
tions are.
The statutory intent is very’ clear, and that is that
the intent of the statute is to permit disclosure, and is to
make: the Government accountable for the activities and the ac­
tions that it performs.

The problem that we deal with now

and the reason why we feel this case is so important is that
in defining the threshold issue of what constitutes the Agency
records, w© are also defining what is the accountability of

10

the Government.
The problem that we have in defining it is the only
way you can examine and determine what are those Agency records
is to look directly at the involvement of the Government and
then interpret what that action of the Government is in the
determination of what is the Agency record.
The statute, the only thin light or light that we
get is the Attorney General's memorandum opinion of 1967
which has some definition of what constitutes Agency records
in the sense that he makes two separate distinctions and thev
talk in terms of possession or control.

The problem is that

the courts have had a great deal of trouble in trying to
determine possessory standards and apply possessory standards
to the Freedom of Information Act v because they are involved
in this balancing and this weighing of what it is that the
act really intends for the Government to do in terms of making
it accountable, and on the other hand, trying to make certain
that the uncertainties ar® not so great that the act encompasses
everything.
QUESTION:

Could I ask you, is it your position that

if a research contract expressly provided that the raw data
would remain the property of the researcher, and that the
Government would have no access to the raw data, would you
still be making an argument that that data —

11
MR. SONNENREICH:

If the is completely privately

owned and there is no access by the Government and there is no
reliance by the Government.
QUESTION-:

Let's just say you had the self-same

facts in this case, everything happened except that the con­
tract -- the data remains the property of the researcher and
the Government will have no access — that's the only change
in the entire case:

Would that settle the matter, as far as

you're concerned?
MR. SONNENREICH:

No, Your Honor, I don't believe

it would.
QUESTION:

Well, whv wouldn't it?

MR. SONNENREICH:

Because what happens is that the

Government has gone beyond that statement in reaching out to
utilize the data, has reached out to substantially involve it­
self with the data process.
QUESTION:

Well, there's access to everything that

the researchers have reported to it, and it can take action
based on what the researchers report to it, but if this contract
said, "You keep the basic data and we don't want to look at it,
and we can't look at it," that wouldn't settle the matter for
you?
MR. SONNENREICH:

If that were the contract and there

was no right to the data, the Government did not rely on it,

12
than my answer would be yes, it wouId settle the matter for me.
That is not, of course, the case in point, nor is it the case
in point in fact that the Government did have access, did
exercise access, did audit the data, did put its hands on the
data, and did rely on the data, both for regulatory action and
for regulatory decision-making.
QUESTION;

The Government has access to a great many

things independent of contract.

I suppose your answer must be

taken as meaning access which the Government could enforce in
some; way?
MR. SONNENREICH;
QUESTION:

Or exercise.

Not access which a university might, or a

private research corporation, might grant them as a matter of
accommodation?
MR. SONNENREICH;

No.

The question becomes that if

they can have it, if they have the right to exercise access
to the data, that is one of the crucial points in determining
whether or not there is substantial Government involvement.
QUESTION:

Suppose one of the big drug companies

working with millions of dollars in research should invite and
permit Government’s people from the National Institutes of
Health and elsewhere, Pood and Drug Administration, to come in
and monitor or* at least observa all that they were doing.
Would that create a right of access, in your view?

13
MR. SONNENREICHi
of access, Your Honor.

I don't think that creates a right

The question would follow, "And what

did they do with what it is that they monitored, sought, and
examined?"

If they then went ahead and relied on it, the

question is yes, w© would think that would be substantial
Government involvement because they did have access
QUESTION:

Is the keystone to a right of access the

fact that the Government funded the enterprise?
MR, SONNENREICH:

And that they had the right to it

specifically.
QUESTION s

My recollection is that tha Pair Labor

Standards Act authorizes th® Government to inspect the wag©
and hour records of private employers if it thinks there may
be a violation, and also requires the keeping of those records.
Do you think that th® citizen could £11© a suit under the
Freedom of Information Act requesting a private employer’s
wage and hour records?
MR. SONNENREICHs

No, I don't, Your Honor.

I think

that, kind of data is a different type of data than the type of
data we're looking at.

I think that the Court has to examine

what it is that we^re talking about when we talk about data.
The data that I believe you are addressing is a
ministerial kind of data that is a collation and function of
collection.

What w© ar® involved in here is data the predicate

14
of which Government action was taken because it forms a
decision-making basis for conclusions, recommendations and
findings, whicft is far different from the type of data that
you’re addressing in the Pair Labor —■
QUESTION:

Well, the information that my brother

Rehnquist refers to might turn out to be the very basis for
a regulation or a rule-making.
MR. SONNENREICH:

If in fact, Your Honor, the

Government does then do rule-making on the basis of that, I
would submit yes.
QUESTION:

They could then, go in, they could then

require the Government to produce the wage records of private
employers and make them public?
MR. SONNENREICH:

Unless it is exempted, yes.

The point that I did want to make in talking about
the fact situation in showing the Government involvement here
was the fact that th© audit is a very significant factor in
this case and does to a certain extent make this case somev/hat
unique.

The reason, as I stated, was for that audit to deter­

mine the validity of the study and the integrity of the data
base.

This is in contrast to the Biometric's audit which was

contracted for by NIH.

The Food and Drug Mministration de­

cided to audit the data itself.

It physically went out to tha

coordinating canter in Baltimore, selected data, examined the

15
data, copies some parts of ths data, and then took back limited
portions of the data that they had seen back to Rockville,
Maryland.

What happen®! was that after completing the audit,

the Pood and Drug Administration then published its findings
as final findings in November of 1978.

It then went back and

renewed its proposal of three years earlier, which was to re­
quire a warning be placed on all oral hypoglycemic drugs.
The central issue in this case, we submit, is whether
the raw data of the study fund®! by the Government, monitored
by the Government, relied upon by the Government, and even
audited by the Government, are Agency records under the Free­
dom of Information Act.
Looking at the fact basis of this case, Petitioners
contend that these are Agency records.
Now, Respondents in their argument to date have
raised a series of issues which tend to blur what we perceive
to ba the central issue of this case.

I would like to just

takes a moment with the Court to raise some of the issues that
Respondent raises and answer them.

They are in basis three.

It has fosen suggested that the data being sought in­
volve identifiable patient records.
this is not so.

Petitioners contend that

The data that the Petitioners ar© wishing to

s©e and exaraina is th© sams data that th© Food and Drug :

16

Administration, or for that matter the Biometric Society, saw
or could have seen when they undertook their audit of the data.
We are not looking to reveal patient identity and there is not
a confidentiality issue, Petitioners submit, in this case.
It was also suggested that it would be necessary to
find the UGDP a Government agency in order to find the broad
data agency records.

Again we submit this is not so.

The

agency that we are talking about is the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare and its sub-agencies.

We are not con­

tending that the UGDP is a. Government agency.
QUESTIONS

Well, isn9t that argument of the Govern­

ment's just a corollary to the basic argument that agency
records, whatevar else they are, must b© in possession or
control of governmental agency, and since UGDP is not a govern­
mental agency, then these cannot b® agency records, since these
raw data are eone©d@dly in the possession or control or UGDP?
MR. SONNENREICHs

That is the argument that they ad­

vance, but they advance it principally on the issue of posses­
sion rather than on control, because in this particular cass
what has happened is that the Government has gone out on tw6
occasions by contract and directly and put thsir hands on the
date, so the control issue of did the Government have control
to reach out and examine the data —
QUESTION:

Does it now?

Did it have control at the

17
time of your request, that’s the issue, I think, in this.
MR. SONNENREICH:
QUESTION:

Yes, but that —

Not did it ever have control.

MR. SONNENREICH:

And we submit it did have control

than and it does have control now.
QUESTION:

Leaving that control to one side for just

a moment, in tha state of the question presented in the
Gov armant’ s brief, they recite that the records were generated,
owned, and possessed by a private non-government grou»>.
Now, I gather you agree with th© fact that it's a
non-governmental group and that they are possessed and gener­
ated by that group.

What about ownership?

Do you agree that

the records were owned by that group?
MR. SONNENREICH:

The problem with this kind of data

is the definition of ownership.
UGDP group.

Yes, they ars owned by the

Tha fact that people can go and examine the data

and take the data away and still have ownership remain with
th© UGDP is that we’re transmitting information not dealing
with tangible items, so what happens is yes, they have owner­
ship of th© data, but also yea, th© government has a right of
access to walk in, tak© the data, copy the data, analyse th®
data, and go back to Rockville, Maryland with it, leaving it
in their possession, in their ownership, and then the Govern­
ment has the ownership of what it did with tha data.

18
QUESTION;

Just this one tiling, if I may,

Are there

any eases that you know of under tha Freedom of Information
9

Act where documents that were not owned by tha agency involved
were required to be produced?
MR. SONNENREICH:
QUESTION;

That ware not owned?

That were not owned by the government,

yes.
MR. SONNENREICH;

That were not specifically owned?

No, I don't, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Of course, your point is that common™

law notions, property notions of ownership are basically ir­
relevant?
MR. SONNENREICH;

Especially with respect to the

generation of data and the transmission of scientific data.
QUESTION;

Well, how is your analogy of 'the use by

the Government here any different than reading a magasine that
somebody els© owns or reading a book that somebody else owns?
MR. SONNENREICH:

Because vrhat is involved, here is,

we have to step back a moment, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

What

we're talking about is the Government relied on a conclusion,
and in order for the Government to deal with data, the Govern­
ment has to analyse, evaluate it? it's not just a question of
reading data and copying it ministerially.

The data has to be

organised in a way to prov® or disprove conclusions.

19
This is why I was trying to draw the distinction be­
tween data which is merely collected, for example in SDC v.
Matthews, which it's put in the Medlar Survey at the National
Library of Medicine and it's there and you can retrieve it
and you can read it, as opposed to data which is actionoriented data in the sens® that in order to understand it, in
order to utilise it, you have to evaluate it, you have fee
analyze it.

And that's what the Government did, because the

only way that you can test th© conclusion of the Government
is not to just compile a series of pieces of informations
What you have to do is analyzes it to show that the integrity of
th© data, th© veracity of th® data, in fact meets those
scientific judgments.
So there is a fundamental problem in getting at that
kind of data, • It's more than simply saying, "Well, it’s there,
and can X retrieve ife or can X not retrieve it?"
more than retrieve it.

X have to use it.

I have to do

And that's exactly

what the Government did, and what the Government's argument has
always been is trying to separate utilizing and reliance on the
study and utilising and reliance on the raw data, which is th©
fundament of the study.
QUESTION:

Mr, Sonnenreich, I want to b© sure about

on® technical aspect.
define agency records?

Th® Freedom of Information Act does not

20

MR. SONNENREICHs
QUESTION;

That is correct, Your Honor.

And did you concede that the applicable

definition is that in the Federal Records Act?
MR. SONNENREICHs
QUESTIONS

I am sorry? I did not hear that.

Do you concede that the applicable defi­

nition here is the one contained in the Federal Records Act?
MR. SONNENREICHs

No, I do not.

My feeling is that

the definition is instructive, but it’s not dispositive.

My

feeling is that the purpose of the Federal Records Act is
slightly different from the purpose of the Freedom of Informa­
tion Act, and the disclosure requirements and the goal of the
Freedom of Information Act could well and doss well change
what constitutes an agency record.
I do want to point out one other point that the
Government contends, and that is that the Government contends
that the test that we ara seeking to have this Court adopt will
in fact blur the so-called bright line of law defining agency
records.
Now, this is not before -the Court, but we will not
argue and we don't argue whether or not the test, that test
may exist as to who gets records under the Freedom of Informa­
tion Act, but we do say that under this standard and the
standards enunciated in the courts below, it. does not have ap­
plicability har®

21
QUESTIONs

Well, I thought if one thing was clear,

it was if anybody gets records under the F01A, everybody doss.
Anybody.
MR. SONNENREICH;
QUESTIONS

That is correct.

I mean, it abolished normal concepts of

standing, didn’t it?
MR. SONNENREICH:
QUESTION;

That’s correct.

Or any showing of need, or --

MR. SONNENREICH;

What we'r© involved in her® and.

what the Court, has to decide here is, where is the door to get
into th© Freedom of Information Act?
QUESTION;

If you’re right under the FOIA, then any

citizen of the United States can equally get this information?
MR. SONNENREICH;

That is correct; that is absolutely

correct, Your Honor.
What we are stating in this argument that Respondents
made is that we do direct the Court that Ciba-Geigy v. Matthews,
Forsham v. Califano below, SDC v. Matthew, all went beyond
discussing the possessory test a«d all went toward frying to
evaluate Federal involvement, Government involvement, in th®
use or in the dealings with those records,, and they ar© all
talking about privata entities which ar® possessing th©
records.
QUESTION?

Non® of those are casas from this Court,

22

are they?
MR. SONNENREICHs
cases below.

No, Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc.

All are

But the cases below do indicate, Your Honor,

they indicate that the concept of agency records don’t lend
thanselves to precise definition, and they are moving away
from this technical property test toward a much more functional
approach of examining the factual basis of the area, of the
particular case, to determine whether or not fcha Government in­
volvement is such that would render those agency records.

All

agree you don't have to be an agency in order to have agency
records.

The question is, functionally what triggers the test

and makes them agency records, letting people in the Freedom of
Information door.
i

QUESTION?

Tell me again, why do your people want
1

these records?
MR. SONNENREICHs

The reason that th© Petitioners are

-

r

looking for the records is because of this enormous scientific
controversy that has now raged for 9 jyears, and what w©'r®
>

trying to do quite honestly is ©valuafc® th® records against
the published conclusions of th© UGDP to determina whether in
fact they are true, and whether or not they aren't,in fact the
date supports th® conclusions mad®.
QUESTION s

But if your people can g©t them under the

V

FOIA, presumably a drunk can walk in off th® street and get

them
MR. SONNENREIC H s
QUESTIONS

But that is true with any —

That’s true.

MR. SONNEMREICH:

— Fra«jdom of Information situa­

tion.
QUESTION:

The inquiry as to why your people

want

them is totally irrelevant under the statute.
MR. SONNENREICH:

That is correct.

I agree with

that.
I do want to rals® on® —
QUESTION

%

Except that I’m curious.

MR. SOHNENREXCHs

Th© reason w© are hare is very

simply that this has affected tha impact on th® treatment of
diabetes, and it has affected five million diabetics.
QUESTION8

Well, certainly your claim is not; that of

a drunk off the street.

You claim a legitimate scientific

reason for seeing: it.
MR. SONNENREXCHs

The Committe® on th© Care of the

Diabetic are reputable diabstologists and physicians and their
patients, and the only reason that this committee was formed
was to, because of th© scientific controversy surrounding the
UGDP was to try and get and evaluate this data to determine
,

in fact whether or not it was scientifically correct.
On® unusual factor in this case that should be

24
pointed out is tha test of scientific* credibility is always to
make the data available whenever there is scientific contro­
versy.

The peer review process is the way in which the conclu­

sions are tasted by examining tha data.

What makes this caa©

unique is that wa are not getting the data* and what is unique
is that researchers that were involved in the program hav© been
denied the data.

Foreign scientists have been denied the data.

That is the uniqueness of this ease.

For reasons that we can-

not understand, the normal peer process is not working.
QUESTION:

But if the Government hadn’t funded it,

if the Ford Foundation had funded i.t, there wouldn’t b® any
case at all, would there?
MR. SONNENREICH:

No, if the Ford Foundation had

funded it and the Government had had access to tha data, and
the Government had substantially involved itself in that pro™
cess and relied upon it, the request would be made under Free­
dom of Information for that data.
QUESTION:

Well,1 by saying the request would be made,

you’re telling us that you', think the Freedom of Information
Act -MR. SONNENREICH:
QUESTION:

— would apply?

MR. SONNENREICH:
QUESTION:

Covered it.

Yes, Your Honor.

Then, the Government funding is not a major

25
factor?
MR, SONNENREICH s

It is a factor.

It5s ens of many

factors that th© Court must look at# that courts must look at
in defining what is significant Government involvement in a
particular fact situation.
QUESTION*
funding at all#

In this case if there were no Government

you’d still b© here?

MR. SONNENREICHs

If we had the right of access and

the Government relied on the data# yes, Your Honor# w© would.
The only point that I would like to leave the Court
with is that there is a problem that th© Court must address#
and that is, if th© test is very narrowly construed from th©
possess.ion standpoint# one of th© problems that arises is the
whole question of Government accountability.

Th© Freedom of

Information Act was intended to grant public access to docu­
ments.

It was not intended to be used tactically to circum­

ORAL ARGUMENT BY KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT HARRIS
MR. GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it pleas© the Court, this case concerns the definition of
agency records under the Freedom of Information Act.

In the

Government'» view, agency records are records relating to th©
affairs of a Federal agency that, are in the possession and
control of that agency.
As we have explained at some length in our brief,
we believe that this definition is first of all supported by
th© languages of th© FOIA which requires all Federal agencies
to "make available agency records," and which prohibits agen­
cies from "withholding" such records.

Giving this language

its ordinary commons®nsa moaning, we contend that an agency
can neither make available nor withhold what it does not
possess.
Moreover, this definition also finds support in the
legislative history of th© Freedom of Information Act.

Legis­

lative debates show quit© clearly that what Congress was
principally a oncer nari about in passing th© FOIA and what was

27
thought to be the principal defect under the predecessor of
the FOIA, Section 3(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act,
was that Federal agencies had refused to divulge public docu­
ments that were in their unquestioned possession and control.
There is not a shred of evidence in the voluminous congression­
al hearings or committee reports or floor debates to indicate
that Congress intended the act to reach documents in the hands
of private parties that happened to do business with the
Federal Government.
QUESTION;

Well, you say in your brief that when you

talk about possession and control, you concede that a govern­
ment agency couldn't avoid its obligation under this statute
by transferring records to a warehouse, or something like that.
What about kh© equivalent of a fraudulent conveyance, where it
in fact neither had possession nor control because it had
legally conveyed possession and control to John Smith?
MR. GELLER:

Well, to begin with, we contru© posses­

sion to mean constructive possession,
QUESTION:

If the agency —

No, no, it had absolutely given up pos­

session and control.
MR, GELLER:

Well, the FOIA does not require Govern­

ment agencies t© hold on to any particular records.

There ar©

other Federal statutes that may well do that, such as the
Federal Records Act and the Records Disposal Act, and it may

28
well be that th© agency or the Attorney General can forced then
to return those records.

But w© think that the FOIA only re­

quires Government agencies to turn over to the public on re­
quest records that are in their possession and control when
the request comes in.
QUESTION;

So an agency could in effect make a

fraudulent conveyance, anticipating FOIA requests for infor­
mation that was embarrassing to it, and it could convey all
those records to John Smith so far as the FOIA goes?
MR. GE’LLER:

So far as the FOIA is concerned, Mr.

Justice Stewart, the Federal agency can destroy the records,
if they -—
QUESTION;
MR. GELLER;
QUESTION;

Well, just stick to my question.
That's correct.
What powers would the Attorney General of

th® United States have in th© hypothetical just suggested?
MR. GELLER;

Well, the Federal Records Act requires

the Government agencies to maintain record systems that indi­
cate the work of the particular agency.

If something falls

within the Federal Records Act, that is, if an agency deter­
mines that something is a Federal record, then that agency
cannot dispose of that record without the consent of the Ad­
ministrator of GSA, who has delegated that authority to the
Archivist

29
Now, if the agency in violation of the Federal
Records Act were dispose, transfer certain records, then the
Records Disposal Act wonId allow the Attorney General to bring
a suit for the return of the records.
QUESTION?

Well, an employee of the Post Office De­

partment — well, that5s private now, but let's say of the
Defens© Department, sells a truck or an airplane that’s in his
possession, certainly the Government could get it back.

Is

there any doubt about that?
MR. GELLERs

Not if h@ didn’t have authority to dis­

pose of it? that’s correct.
QUESTIONS

He just went out and sold it — that some­

times happens, as we know.
MR. GELLERs

As the Government is the true owner, it

could bring a replevin action, I assume, and the Federal
Records Act, the Records Disposal Act provide a similar cause
of action for the Government when Federal records are unlaw­
fully disposed of.
QUESTION:

Do you think, Mr. Seller, that where tha

records war® generated has any bearing at all on the definition
of what are agency records?

In this case, the records, the

alleged records wear® not generated within the agency.

In th©

easa to ba argued next, th® records, if they were records,
were generated within th® agency.

D© you suppose that has -any

30

effect upon the definition?
MR. GELLER:

For FOIA purposes I would think not.

I

would think that what's relevant for FOIA purposes is whether
at the time the FOIA —*
QJESTIONs

Possession and control are the only two

tet«fcs, in your submission?
MR. GELLER;

That's correct, although for other

purposes, as I said, Federal Records Act —
QUESTION:

Well, I understand that.

MR. GELLER;
QUESTION;

For FOIA purposes, I think that’s right.
Mr. Geller, let me ask the question I

asked of your opponent.

Do you accept the Federal records

definition of agency records as applicable to the FOIA?
MR. GELLER:

W©11, we believe that the agency records

definition under the FOIA includes everything that's a
■Federal record under the Federal Records Act if it's in the
Government's possession and control.
Now, there's a question whether something that's not
a Federal record under th® Federal Records Act but is instead
non-record materials has to be turned over under th© FOIA if
it's in th® Government’s possession and control.

We discuss

that issue in Footnote 38 of our brief in the Kissinger cas®,
to be argued nesst, and I think that’s an unsettled quastion.
But w® think at th® very least th© definition of

31
agency records in th® FOIA includes everything that's a Federal
record under the Federal Records Act, if it's in th© Govern­
ment’s possession at the time the FOIA request comas in.
Now, as I was saying, the legislative history in­
cludes nothing to support Petitioner’s theory of agency
records, and we think it’s unlikely that Congress vxmld have
intend®! that result without some discussion of what Judge
Leventhal correctly termed th©, quote, "awesome imp11eations"
that such a result would have.
Indeed, it seems entirely reasonable to conclude that
in referring to agency records when enacting the FOIA, Congress
was aware of and, as Mr. Justice Blackmun just mentioned,
meant to rely at least in part on the definition of Federal
records in the Federal Records Act and the Records Disposal
Act.
This definition refers to documentary material,
materials that ara made or received by an agency in connection
with the transaction of public business, and that ar© preserved
or appropriate for preservation by th© agency.

And once again,

w© think that this definition plainly suggests that only
documents in an agency’s possession and control were meant to
be included within the disclosure requirements of the FOIA.
Finally, w© believe that the tost we have proposed
which focuses on actual or constructiva possession has the

32
benefit of being easy to apply in the various different, and
unpredictable situations in which this issue is likely to
arise.
i

Now, as applied in this case, this definition of
agency records yields a clear result.

The UGDP raw data that

Petitioners have sought are not now and have never been in the
possession of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
or any other Federal agency.

Th® District Court found the

data had at all times since their creation bean in the sol©
possession of th® UGDP, which is a private research group.

In

light of these undisputed findings, we think that the District
Court and the Court of Appeals correctly held that the data
are not agency records within 552(A)3 and (A)4 of Title 5,
and that they need not b© produced to Petitioners under the
FOIA.
QUESTION?

Could the Government have made copies of

all this, all these records, under their right of access?
MR. GELLERs

Wall, as to the right of access.

Petitioners make it seem as if the N"H or the FDA have an
unlimited and unrestricted right of access.
discuss a little later, this is untrue.

As I hope to

Th© right of access,

-w® believe and th© affidavit of Dr. Whedon in th© record sup­
ports, is only a right of access for purposes of the grant?
itBs not an unlimited right of access.

33
The FDA has ®&arcis®& that right of access, as
Petitioners pointed out, and in conducting its audits, some of
the raw data of the UGDP project did come into FDA’s posses­
sion.

It was brought back from Baltimore to the NIK head­

quarters in Rockville.

All of that data has been turned over

to Petitioners, so ws'ra not talking hare about any data that
ever came into the Government's possession and control, because
that’s all bean mad® available to the Petitioner.
So your answer, Mr. Chief Justice, would be yes, if
the grant allowed it and the access regulations approved of it,
the Government could make copies, and at that point they may
well be agency records.

It's not an issue in this case, foe™

cause every document of that sort that was actually copied and
brought back into the NIH’s possession was made available to
Petitioners.
Now, the problem that we see with Petitioner’s con­
trary theory of the agency records provisions of the Freedom of
Information Act is that it's really no theory at all.
Petitioner’s submission, although obviously designed to con­
vince the Court that they should be given access to th© UGDP
data at issue in this case, based on no principle standards
for determining when documents in general are agency records,
therefore offer this Court virtually no guidance in deciding
when any of the literally billions of documents in the hands of

34
private groups that deal with or receive money from the Federal
Government should be considered agency records within the mean­
ing of the act.

Let me explain what I mean.

Petitioners have never claimed that the UGDP itself
is a Federal agency under the PQXA and any such claim would be
totally untenable.

Agency is a defined term under the act and

the UGD?, which is an organisation of private and State uni­
versity medical research groups working at private and State
institutions clearly doesn’t satisfy the statutory definition
of agency.
What Petitioners have instead contended in this liti­
gation is that the Department of Healthf Education, and Wel­
fare is the relevant agency under the FOIA, and then they’ve
attempted to argue that the raw data in the hands of the UGDP
are agency records of HEW by emphasizing every conceivable
connection between the data in any branch or agency of HEW.
They specifically rely on three main factors.
First they claim that the National Institute of
Arthritis, Metabolism, and Digestive Disorders, which is a
part of (th© Public Health Service within HEW «3 significantly
..involved in tha design, implementation and funding of the UGDP
study that led to the raw data.
Second, they claim that NI&MDD anjoys an absolute
right of access to fcha UGDP data under its grant regulations.

35
Third, they claim that the Food and Drug Administra­
tion, which is a separate agency within HEW, has taken the
UGDP data into account for the purposes of regulatory deci­
sion -making.
According to Petitioners, it6s the combination of
these three factors -chat somehow turns fch® UGDP data which
unquestionably ar© owned, they concede, possessed and con­
trolled by a privat® organization, into HEW agency records,
that must be turned over to any person.
QUESTION?

Would it make any difference to you if

the contract not only gave th© Government the right to access
for soma limited purposes, but also said that if the Governmeat chooses to make public the underlying data?
MR. GELLER:

Well, it wouldn't make any difference

to our main theory, which is that only documents in the pos­
session and control, not documents that they may have a right
to go out and get, are within the FOXA.
QUESTION s

I take it vou’vci already conceded that if

the Government made copies and took them over to NIH or FDA
they would be agency records?
MR. GELLERs

I think that's correct.

1 don’t want to

concede that if it were to happen in th© future they would
necessarily ba agency records, because there is seme question
as to whether it would be a Federal record under the NIH

36
record management plan, but I have said, and 'this is true*, that
every part of the UGDP data -that’s ever come into NIAMDD's or
PDA’s possession in the past has been turned over to Petition­
ers, or presumably any other POIA requester.
QUESTION:

What if the United States Attorney in

Baltimore decides that there has been fraud against the
Government committed in connection with some of these grant
programs and subpoenas and copies some of this raw data?
Would you concede that those were Federal records?
MR. GELLER:

No, I wouldn't.

that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

I would not concede

I think in that case you have

possession on the part of the Federal Government.
wa think the control test may be relevant.

That's why

It's not relevant

in this case because the Government has never had possession
or control of any of the documents at issue.
QUESTION:

Your proposed test is not possession of

control, but possession and control?
MR. GE1LER:

That's correct.

And control — you

know, this case raises a number of interesting questions about
what is an agency record, and w© presented a definition of ~

MR. GELLER:

would not ba agency records, because —

Even though they remain the property of

MR. SELLER8

Yes, I don't think that property con­

cepts have ranch of a role to play —QUESTION:

Why do you say that?

You do mention in

your statement of the question presented, you point out the
fact that these ware owned by a private organization.
MR, SELLERs

bundle of th© rights that ownership gives you that's relevant
in this casts is whether you have an undisputed right to di­
vulga it to somebody ©Is®.

QUESTIONS

Oh, yes, that's a different question.

Now, my example, there would presumably b© no withholding, if
they'd been stolen, because you're not withholding something
you don’t have possession of.

Would it stop being an agency

record simply because a spy emptied the files?

This is rather

a strange concept.
MR. SELLERs

It raally wouldn't matter in any practi

That"s why I'm puzzled that you use the

definition you use, because you'd win that lawsuit because
there's no withholding, and I'm just not quit® clear on why

40

you 'r® so firm on tha notion they'll stop being agency records.
MR. GELLER:

I think it's important, though, to

realize we're talking about agency records for FOIA purposes,
and the definition exists in the same sentence with the words
"withhold" and "make available."

We think they give meaning to

what Congress meant by the words "agency records."
We believe that the Court should reject the essen­
tially standardless approach to the definition of "agency
records" that Petitioners offer.

As I have already mentioned,

there i3 nothing in th© act itself or in its legislative his­
tory to suggest that Congress meant it to reach papers or other
materials in private hands.
Perhaps more importantly, Petitioner's approach
would lead to more problems than it could possibly solve, be­
cause unless the exception carved in the FOIA at Petitioner's
behest \mra to be limit®! to tha UGDP documents alone or to
other private documents that were produced under the circum­
stances virtually identical to th© UGDP data, in other words
all th© foux* factors they raly on existed, it would b@ diffi­
cult if not impossible to identify limiting criteria in order
to prevent literally billions of other private documents from
falling within th© disclosure requirements of the act.
Now, Petitioner's, as I have noted, have stressed
three, or now they say four particular factors that they

41
believe make the private UGDP records in this case sufficiently
Federal to require their release under the FGXA, but some of
these factors would apply equally to almost every meaningful
document in the" hands of a private group that receives Federal
funding,
And I might add at this point that there were over
16,000 Government research grants in existence in 1978 and
that, all Federal grants of one sort or another counted for
nearly one-fifth of the Federal Government’s budget outlay that
year.

In other words, by making: the producibility of a docu­

ment in privet© hands turn on a balancing of an unknown number
of variables, including such subjactive considerations as the
substantiality of the Federal agency’s funding or monitoring
of the private project that produced th® records, or the scope
of the granting agency’s access rights to th© records, or th®
degree of th© agency’s reliance on the final report prepared
by the grant.®® through th® use of the records —

Mr, Plank.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. PLANK, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT KLIMT
MR. PLANK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please th®

Court, -there are three reasons why we believe that Congress

44
never intended the Federal Freedom of Information Act to ap­
ply to the records of private citizens and private and state
institutions that receive Federal grants, and also whv the act
should not be extended to such records»
First, such extension of the Federal Freedom of In­
formation Act would be contrary to the very basic premise of
the Freedom of Information Act, which is the x'ight of the
people to know what their government is doing»
The second reason is that such an extension of the
Freedom of Information Act to the records of grant recipients
would significantly alter the basic relationship between the
Federal Government and grant recipients.
Third, the application of the act to the records of
such grant recipients, such as the university records of the
University Group Diabetes Program, would have a staggering ad­
verse impact upon grant recipients whether they be researchers
or whether they be stata and local governments.
Before I discuss these points further, I would like
to respond to some of the points that were made earlier.

I

would just like to point out to the Court that the record is
very clear in this case that not only did only the UGDP have
possession of the records, but they had control of the records.
The District Court so found, and Dr. FThedon’s affidavit at
page 147 of the Appendix clearly sets forth that the day to

45

day management of the University Group was in the hands of the
University Group and not the National Institutes of Health or
any other agency of the Federal Government.
It is also helpful to remember what are not issues
in this case.

The validity of the findings of the University

Group study is not an issue in this case.

The proprietv of

the proposed changes in the labeling of oral hypogylcemic
drugs by the Food and Drug Administration is not an issue in
this case, and neither is the propriety of the reliance by the
Food and Drug Administration upon the findings of the Univer­
sity Group study.
Similarly, the issue of whether the University Groun
records ought to be release! to the public at some time in the
future is not an issue in this case,
The issue here is whether individuals and private and
state institutions that receive federal grants but otherwise re­
tain their independence::and autonomy, or the case of a state
or local government their sovereignty, the right of those in­
dividuals to determine when, to what extent, and under what
circumstances their records will be revealed to the public.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose unless the contract may

determine it?
MR. PLANK:

Yes, Your Honor,

Let's say if the

Federal Government in some way interferes with the independence

46
of the -—
QUESTION;
MR. PLANK;

Yes.
That mav be relevant.

One of the important principles that is recognised
in our society is the right of individuals and private and
state entities to pursue their own goals with a minimum of
interference from the Federal Government.
QUESTION:

Can someone who accepts a large grant

from the Federal Government complain about interference with
its privacy or its goals?
MR. PLANK:

Well, I think the point, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, is, there is of course a certain amount of interference entailed in a federal grant, but the purpose of the
federal grant is not to interfere with or to direct the sub­
ject matter of the research.
QUESTION:

Well, the purpose of the federal grant is

what Congress determines it to be, isn’t it?
MR. PLANK:

That's correct, Your Honor, but in this

case and in the cases of most federal grants, the purpose is
to support and to assist these institutions and entities as
they pursue their own goals.
QUESTION:

Could Congress make all of these records

public records by definition?
MR. PLANK:

I belisv® the Congress perhaps could, if

47
it wanted to define agency records to include the records of
grantees, I think they could make that definition.

In this

case they have not.
QUESTION;

The agency could make the grant on vir­

tually any terms they wanted, could they not?
MR. PLANK;

That's also correct.

Yes, Your Honor.

But I think the point is here that any time the Congress has
circumscribed the freedom of a grant recipient to take action.
Grant recipients may not discriminate on the basis of race,
may not discriminate against the handicapped.

Congress has

specifically so provided, either in the enabling legislation
for the grant or in another act.
In this case, Congress has not stated that the
records of grant recipients are federal agency records, and I
think that that fact in itself is conclusive.
In addition, the fact of the staggering impact that
the extension of the act would have upon conducting research
and the federal program of supporting research suggests very
strongly that Congress would not and did not intend the act to
apply to these records simply because fchev didn9t address these
policy issues.

These policy issues are substantial, as the

Court of Appeals pointed out, and Congress at the very least,
if they had wanted to do this and had intended to do this,
would have discussed this pclicy question.

48

Thank yon, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have just one minute

left, Mr. Sormenreich.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL R. SONNENREICH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL
MR. SONNENREICH:

Yes.

I just want to point out a

few things to the Court, and that is with respect to the right
of access.
The right of access is clear in the contract made
between the Government and the UGDP, and the regulations of
HEW, Section 74.23 clearly allow the right of access to copy
the records, take the records, analyze the records, make an
audit, so that th© contract between the parties is very clear­
ly allowing that.
In addition, I point out to th© Court that the FDA
which stepped in to do the audit has its own regulation,
21 CFR 20.105(d), which equally makes it, all the raw data,
available to any research that had been conducted by the FDA.
Th© only .question I posit to the Court is the ques­
tion that what we're involved with here is two agencies, one
of which would have allowed under its own regulation all the
raw data given, as opposed to another agency that does not,
and the question is, ws'ra in a question of agency shopping.

49
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentleman.
