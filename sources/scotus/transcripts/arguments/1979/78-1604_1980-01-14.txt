PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 78-1601?, Central Machinery Company v.
Arizona State Tax Commission.
Mr. Lewis, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RODNEY B. LEWIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. LEWIS:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on appeal from the Supreme
Court of the State of Arizona,

It involves the question of

whether the State of Arizona can impose a transaction
privilege tax on the sale of 11 tractors to the Gila River
Indian Community.
In 1973, representatives of Central Machinery
went upon the Gila River Indian Reservation for the purpose
of selling farm machinery to Gila River Farms.

Gila River

Farms is a subsidiary and business enterprise of the Gila
River Indian Community, a recognised Indian tribe organ­
ised pursuant to section 16 of the Indian Reorganization
Act.
After negotiations which occurred on the reser­
vation, Gila River Farms agreed to purchase 11 John Deere
tractors.

Subsequently delivery and payment for the

tractors was made on the reservation.

Central Machinery

added to the purchase price the amount of $2,916.62 which
was paid by Gila River Farms to Central Machinery.

Central

Machinery remitted these funds to the State of Arizona as
payment for the transaction privilege tax.

Central

Machinery paid this tax under protect.
The sale was approved by the Superintendent of
Pima Agency, the Secretary’s representative on the Gila
River Indian Reservation.

The Pima kp;ency Superintendent
»

allowed Central Machinery to come onto the reservation and
to transact this business without securing a trader's
license.

The Superintendent prior to the sale had also

approved the farm’s budget which had set aside monies for
the purchase of the tractors.
The administrative appeals and the court action
and the Arizona courts followed, culminating in this appeal
before this Court.
The traders statute, U.S.C. 26l through 264 and.
federal regulations^preempt Arizona’s jurisdiction to levy
this tax on this sale.

It is cur position that Warren

Trading Post governs this case thereby preventing applica­
tion or imposition of the transaction privilege tax, a tax
which is measured by sales to this sales transaction„
QUESTION:

Mr. Lewis, would you agree that if

instead of the transaction taking place on the Gila River

Reservation, it had taken place in New Mexico and Arizona
had sought to levy its privilege tax, it would be taxable?
MR. LEWIS:

Ifm not sure whether or not there

would be a sufficient connection to the State of Arizona
allowing Arizona to impose that tax.

That, of course, is

not the situation here before us.
QUESTION:

But if there had been, do you think

the same standard would govern or do you think that its
licensing by the Secretary of the Interior and the other
peculiarly Indian aspects of this case that —
MR. LEWIS:

I don*t think the licensing by the

Interior is dispositive of this case, nor do I think it
would be handled the same way regarding a transaction in
New Mexico.
Our position is that Warren Trading Post which
held that federal statutes and accompanying regulations
preempted the field did not allow the imposition of this
tax to this transaction.
Warren Trading Post held that Congress has under­
taken to regulate reservation trading in such a comprehen­
sive way that there is no room for the states to legislate
the subject.

Any assessment and collection of a tax in­

volved was, it was held in Warren, to frustrate the
evidence congressional purpose of insuring that no burden
be imposed upon Indian traders, trading with Indians or

6
reservations except as authorized by acts of Congress or by
valid regulations promulgated under those acts.
Congress enacted the trader's statute to deter
fraud and prevent exploitation of Indians engaged in com­
mercial transactions with an Indian country.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lewis, could I ask you a question.

Was this transaction approved by the federal government?
MR. LEWIS:

The transaction was approved by the

federal government, was approved by the Secretary's repre­
sentatives —
QUESTION:

When it was approved, did the person

who granted the approval know the terms of the transaction?
i
MR. LEWIS: He knew the terms of the transaction,
he had approved the monies which had been set aside by
Gila River Farms specifically for the purchase of the
tractors.
QUESTION:

Can it be inferred that the approval

carried with it approval of the transaction tax?
MR. LEWIS:

No, it cannot.

First of all, I

think our position is that the agency superintendent simply
s*

recognized chat there was a problem involved here.

He only

approved the transaction, realizing the Gila River Farms
and Central Machinery had paid this tax under protest.
Secondly -—
QUESTION:

Was there any objection made on behalf

I

7
of the federal government to the payment of the tax?
MR. LEWIS:

There was no objection at that time

made by the federal government to the imposition of the tax0
He was aware, of course, that the tax had been paid on the
tractors under protest.
The power of Congress to legislate in this area
stems from the Indian commerce clause, Article 3, section
8, clause 3 of the United States Constitution.

On their

face, these statutes indicate that exclusive power to regu­
late trading rests with the federal government„

For instances

25 U.S.C. 26l says that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs
has sole power and authority to appoint Indian traders„

25

U.S.Co 262 specifies that any person must first satisfy the
Commissioner that he is a proper person to deal with —
to trade with Indians.
QUESTION:

Do you mean to argue that if the

Indian purchasers had left the reservation and gone to the
city or gone into a town or some neighboring community and
negotiated the purchase of the tractors and paid for them
there and delivery taken there, that the seller would have
to qualify as an Indian trader?
MR. LEWIS:

If we went off the reservation to

buy these tractors, we would be subject to the Arizona
transaction privilege tax.
QUESTION:

And the seller wouldn’t have to be

3
recognised as an Indian trader?
MR. LEWIS:

The seller would not have to be recog­

nized as an Indian trader.
QUESTION:

When he comes onto the —

Well, what if went off the reservation

and bought and paid for the tractor an the adjoining com­
munity and asks that it be delivered on the reservation?
MR. LEWIS:
QUESTION:
MR. LEWIS:

Well, that would not be our case.
I know it isn't your case.
It is a little difficult to answer

that but in that case I think the transaction could be
taxed.
QUESTION:
MR. LEWIS:

I see.
The federal government has tradi­

tionally and historically regulated trading involving
Indians.

Beginning in 1790, they enacted the trader

statutes, and throughout the 19th Century the trader
statutes were amended from time to time.

Because of this

predominant federal interest, state regulation has often
been precluded.
The sale by Central Machinery to Gila River
Farms falls within the scope of the trader statute, and
the holding of Warren Trading Post.

25 U.S.C., for in­

stance, 26*4 penalizes any person conducting unauthorized
trading with Indians or Indian tribes and the Commissioner
has issued comprehensive regulations to carry out the

9
objectives of the statute.
The attempt to attack this sale of these tractors
to Gila River Farms which occurred on the reservation must
fall since the trader statutes preempt Arizona’s jurisdic­
tion to enact this tax3 and because of the holding and the
interpretation of the trader statutes by Warren Trading
Post.
Our second argument deals with the fact that the
tax interferes with the federal purposes of the Gila River
Indian Reservation.

The reservation was established in

1859 to provide Pimas and Maricopas a sound economic base.
Gila River Farms is pursuing this objective.

The Pimas

and Maricopas have farmed along the Gila River for
hundreds and even thousands of years 5 certainly before the
establishment of the American Republic.
The imposition of the Arizona transaction
privilege tax burdens the economic purpose of the reserva­
tion.

Second of all. the tax interferes with tribal self-

government.

Warren invalidated the same tax in 1965: this

tax which Is measured by sales, because
it interfered with tribal self-government.

in part because
And MeClanahan

invalidated Arizona’s income tax because of its Interference
with tribal self-government.
The Gila River Indian community’s ability to
government itself will likewise be interfered with.

10
I would like to now address two argumenta raised
by the State of Arizona.

First, the Arizona Supreme Court-

thought it important that because of the lack of trader's
license, this transaction did not come within the trader
statutes or the holding in Warren.
First of all, there is not a statutory require­
ment that Central Machinery have a traderrs license to
engage in trading or a reservation^,

The purpose of these

statutes, as I mentioned before, is to supervise trading
with Indians and Indian tribes, to prevent unfair prices
and practices.

The issuance of a trader’s license is not

the exclusive way in which or method in which the federal
government uses to accomplish the purpose of the statutes.
For instance, the Code of Federal Regulations
allows itinere-t peddlers to go on the reservation to
trade for limited purposes9 therefore they need, correspond­
ingly less supervision.

Here there xirasextensive super­

vision which met the objectives of the statutes and that
is to defer fraud and prevent exploitation of Indiansc
There was a specific approval of the sale, there was ap­
proval of the farm’s budget which included money set aside
for the tractors, and there was approval of the tribal
budget of the Gila Fiver Indian Community, the parent
organization of Gils. River Farms, as is required by Article
15 of the constitution and bylaws of the Gila River Indian

11
Community, which was approved by the Secretary of the Interior.
A determination was made by the agency superintendent
in this single transaction that a license not be issued be­
cause there probably had been adequate supervision of this
transaction and the purposes of the statute had been met and
accomplished.
A second argument raised by the State of Arizona
and which was discussed in the Supreme Court's opinion in
Arizona was that it did not come in within the trader
statutes, this transaction did not come within the trader
statutes or Warren Trading Post because it lacked a perman­
ent place of business on the reservation.
Again, the trader statutes don't require that
persons engaged in

commercial transactions with Indians

within Indian country have a permanent place of business
on that .reservation.
QUESTION:

Well, should Central have had a

license?
MR. LEWIS:
this case.

Central did not need a license in

The purposes of the statute had been met, there

was direct supervision of the entire transaction by the
Secretary of the Interior.
QUESTION:

Are you saying that the trading

statute did apply except for the licensing provision, is
that it?

12

MR. LEWIS:

The trader statutes applied,

licensing is not required by the statute.

'The

The force of the

federal government in supervising the sale was in effect,
the full force.

The sale !.*7as comprehensively regulated by

the agency superintendent.
QUESTION:

You are suggesting that the licensing

is merely a matter of form, formality?
MR. LEWIS:

In this case it was a mere formality.

The actual supervision had taken place.
QUESTION:

Well, is the extent of the economic

burden any factor in your argument, or is it just a straight
preemption argument?
MR. LEWIS:

Well, that is basically our argument,

but certainly the economic burden on the tribe, on a group
of Indians with limited resources certainly has a strong
effect.

This $2,916 adds up, when you count the tremendous

amount of similar transactions which occur, these are funds
which ordinarily would go to support the tribal government
which has its purpose to maintain government on the reserva­
tion and to attempt to establish a sound economic base for
Piinas and Maricopas who lived there since time immemorial.
In summary, the trader statutes preempt Arizona's
authority to tax this sale.

Warren Trading Post, interpret­

ing the trader statutes, governs and controls this case,
preventing imposition of this transaction privilege tax

which is measured by sales.

The imposition of the tax will

interfere with the federal purposes of the reservation to
provide a sound economic base for Pirns, and Maricopa
Indians and interferes with the right of the Gila River
Indian Community Tribe to govern itself.
QUESTION:
correctly.

Let me just be sure I understand you

Did you respond to Mr. Justice White by saying

that if the contract had been signed off the reservation
that then the tax could be imposed?
MRo LEWIS:

I think the question was if the farms

had gone off the reservation, bought the tractors, then
that would be a different situation and probably the
Arizona tax would apply in that situation»

But in this

case —
QUESTION:

But the tax cannot be applied if they

go off the reservation and negotiate the whole transaction
and then go back on the reservation and sign the papers?
MR. LEWIS:

Well, I think if delivery was going

to be made on the reservation —
QUESTION:
on the reservation.

Well, it is always going to be made
Delivery was made on the reservation

here -MR. LEWIS:
QUESTION:
example, too

Yes, It was.
-— and I think in Mr. Justice White's

MR,, LEWIS:

I think the mere fact that some nego­

tiations took place off the reservation I still think would
prevent imposition of this tax.
QUESTION:

The key is where they sign the contract,

is it?
MR. LEWIS:

The key is that you have a trader

dealing x^ith Indian tribes and the statute
QUESTION:

If the only difference is where you

sign the contract, is that the difference between taxation
and no taxation?
MR. LEWIS:

No, that is not the difference between

taxation and no taxation.

When ~~

QUESTION:. Well, what is it then?
ME. LEWIS:

Well, a taxable event In this case

was the transaction of the sale of the tractors to the
Gila. River Indian Community.

That was a taxable event.

The elements of the sale involved negotiations, signing a
contract, making payment and delivery, these took place in
this case on the reservation.
Now, if in a situation negotiations took place
off the reservation, that would not make any difference.
The trader statutes still govern that transaction.

If the

contract 'was signed off the reservation, I still don't think
that the —- I still think the trader statutes would govern
the situation and preempt the state's authority to levey a

QUESTION:

Then is it delivery., any time merchan­

dise is delivered on the reservation?
your position now.

I think you changed

You say even if it was signed off the

reservation, there would be preemption.
MR. LEWIS:
QUESTION:

In this case, these events -I understand but I am trying to under­

stand what is your view of the line between a taxable
transaction and a ncn-taxable transaction.
MR. LEWIS:

The line is drawn when you are deal­

ing with an Indian tribe within Indian country.
one line.

That is

If you are dealing with a business, an important

part, an important function of the tribal government, that
is a second major factor.

Finally, you are talking about,

in this case we are talking about a series of events which
constitute the sale which also took place on the reserva­
tion.

When you are dealing with an Indian tribe, within

Indian country for the sale, this comes within the traderstatutes, comes within the meaning of Warren.
QUESTION:

Then are you saying that it is the

status of the Indian tribe that is the dispositive factor
and that all these other factors are unimportant and ir­
relevant?
MR. LEWIS:

Yes, the status of the Indian tribe,

the fact that it occurred within Indian country, it was a.

16
commercial transaction, yes, those are the factors which
preempt the Arizona state sales tax.
QUESTION:

Well, certainly in Mescalero the de-

cision from our Court several years ago, rejected the idea
that the mere fact that it was an Indian tribe automatic­
ally meant federal preemption, did it not?
MR. LEWIS:

It did.

The ski lodge at issue

there was off the reservation.
QUESTION:

But if the status of the Indian tribe

wasn't in doubt, so the status by itself wouldn’t be given
exemption here, would it, under Mescalero?
MR. LEWIS:

Under Mescalero, that of course in­

volved a different situation.
located off the reservation.
here.

It involved Indian property
That is not the situation

The fact that it is an Indian tribe is not disposi­

tive of this situation.

It is a fact that there was

business performed within Indian country, the fact that
there was an Indian tribe, the fact in this case that the
events of the sale took place on the reservation.
QUESTION:

If the tribe had sent a representative

in to Phoenix to buy a truck and had bought the truck off
of an automobile dealer lot and taken the truck back to
the reservation, would that be covered by your submission
here today?
MR. LEWIS:

By the submission here today it would

17
not be covered.
QUESTION:

You wouldn’t be making the claim that

you are making here today?
ME. LEWIS:
QUESTION:

We would not be making the claim,
Suppose the agreement to purchase the

truck having been made in Phoenix also provided that the
truck would be delivered to the reservation.
MR, LEWIS:

I think simply delivery of the truck

on the reservation probably would not bring this —
QUESTION:
MR, LEWIS:

Would not be quite enough?
It would not be quite enough,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very -well,

Mr, Claiborne.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Let me begin by saying that we humbly endorse and
have in our brief primarily relied on the statutory preemption argumentj and with respect to that, in answer to
some of the questions from the bench, I would put the matter
this way:
The purpose of the Indian trader statutes was to
protect Indian tribes against the abuses of those who came

18
onto that Indian territory,, who came within Indian country
and tried to sell them goods or services.

It therefore does

matter whether It Is the tribe that goes outside to pur­
chase equipment or whether it Is the dealer who comes onto
the reservation to sell to the tribe.
Whether seme part of the negotiation is subsequent
ly conducted on or off the reservation may be less critical
than whether the approach comes from the outside or whether
rather it is the Indian tribe -—
QUESTION:

Well, is it an approach from the out­

side if the farm machinery dealer simply advertises on
local television, on the radio and advertises John Deere
tractors at a very low price?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

Perhaps not.

And off the Indian goes to buy a

tractor.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Perhaps not.

Perhaps that is

the —
QUESTION:

Well, Is It perhaps so or perhaps not

or —
?nR. CLAIBORNE:

I would have thought not.

would have thought that when the dealer either by mail, by
telephone or by personal entry onto the reservation ap­
proaches the tribe with a view to selling machinery or any
other -—

QUESTION:

How about a flier in the mail to all

residents of the reservation?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

That I think would be an invita­

tion fromoutside and that would and should be subject to
the —
QUESTION:

And even if the Indian then leaves the

reservation and signs the contract and takes delivery off
the reservation?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, Mr. Justice White, of course,

there are gradations and I am not clear as to each of the —
QUESTION:

But you are clear about this one?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

This one, of course, we got an

approach from the outside, we've got the transaction con­
ducted wholly within the reservation, we've got the contract
signed there and we’ve got delivery effected there.
QUESTION:

Do I understand correctly, Mr.

Claiborne, that your reliance is primarily if not exclusiveI

ly on the doctrine of Warren Trading Post?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Insofar as we rely on statutory

preemption.
QUESTION:

Don't you do primarily rely on statu­

tory preemption?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

We do primarily rely, but we have,

as Your Honor may krow from our brief, also suggested
there is a constitutional dimension to the case.

I

that

20
appreciate that that matter was not urged below.

We felt

that, at the Court’s invitation as amicus curiae, it was
our duty to put forward what we think is a constitutional
preemption argument which is --QUESTION:

That is the Indian commere clause?

MR. CLAIBORNE:
ment.

The Indian commerce clause argu­

As to that, i\re begin with the proposition which has

been endorsed by this Court stashing in the Worcester case
and most recently reaffirmed in Bryan v„ Itasca County,
that the power to deal with Indian tribes is exclusively
a federal power.
QUESTION:

Do you agree with Judge O'Connor's

statement in her opinion that it is the existence of the
federal laws, that the accompanying regulations are not
their enforcement which preempts the state’s ability to
tax the transaction?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
that statement entirely.

Mr. Chief Justice, we endorse
It seems to us irrelevant if —

and we don’t suggest that it is the case, buf if it were
the case, that if the Department of the Interior had defauled by failing to apply the Indian trader statutes here
to this transaction, that ought not give les.ve to the
State of Arizona to impose its tax.

Preemption in this

area, an area committed by the Constitution exclusively to
the federal government, is one in which the doctrine of

21
preemption depends on the existence rather than the exer­
cise of federal statutory power.
QUESTION:

Well, how do you distinguish your

answer to the Chief Justice's question from the statement
in Mescalero on page 147 of the U.S. Reports, at the out­
set we reject, as did the state court, the broad assertion
that the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over
the tribe for all purposes and that the state is therefore
prohibited from enforcing its revenue laws against any
tribal enterprises?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc, I take

that statement to address the broad proposition there put
forward that the relation with Indians and with Indian
tribes even off reservation was exclusively a matter of
federal consideration.
QUESTION:

But certainly Indian commerce can-

take place off the reservation as well as on the reservation.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc, we assume

and I think with some justification in history that the
Indian commerce clause was written agaisist e. background of
two kinds of Indians.

For the most part then on their own

territory within Indian country, that was the Indian com­
merce spoken of.

When Indians has assimilated, had joined

the general population, were not longer on their reserva­
tion/ that was not Indian commerce.

The Indians had lost

22
their character as a tribe and we are talking about tribal
commerce, not an individual Indian who goes off to buy a
car or any other product.

We are talking about, as the

Constitution does, commerce with the Indian tribes within
their territory as now defined by reservations.
QUESTION:

Well, originally they were not reser­

vations, they were just tribes that were considered in the
era of the Worcester case a little short of sovereign
nations like England or France or Germany,, and those weren’t
reservation Indians, they were tribal nations.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Stewart, of course

they were more independent then than now, but the Cherokees
in the Worcester case were on their reserved lands, those
which they had not ceded, and —
QUESTION:

Unlike today, where Indian reservations

are federal lands, in those days they were Indian lands.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

In some eases, of course, they

are simply Indian lands set aside —
QUESTION:

Indian sovereign nations or quasi-

sovereign n&tions.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

But there are and most reserva­

tions today are simply the residual of aboriginal Indian
lands which are now more restricted in area and more subject
to both federal and to some degree state regulation.
QUESTION:

But those boundaries were fixed not

23
by the Indians but fcy treaties and by acts of Congress, as
Justice Stewart suggested.

Before that, the Indians merely

claimed sovereignty over rather indefinite and vaguely de­
fined lands, wasn’t that sc?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

To some degree, Mr. Chief Justice.

Of course, there were a number of treaties long before the
decision in Worcester which had defined the area which could
remain which was not ceded and which is recognized as per­
taining to the Indian tribes.

Indeed, the Worcester case

involved the Cherokee area which had been defined at least
twice by treaty by then and was very much less than the
aboriginal area, roamed by the Cherokee Tribes.
QUESTION:

One of those reservations had been,

created when the constitutional language was drafted.
QUESTION:

That is the point.

MR, CLAIBORNE:
Justice Stevens.

Well, that is not quite true, Mr.

There had been a number of treaties before

the Constitution which had fixed boundaries between the
white man’s land and the Indian land.

Now, it is true that

and, of course, they were Indians within the states even
then, witness ~~

tion?

MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

before the Constitution --

•— and Lord Jeffrey Amherst and King

George III or
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the

period between the Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution, the period of the Continental Congress, was
a period of the United States although not governed by the
confederation rather than the Constitution, and those states
the State of New York and the State of Massachusetts had
Indian enclaves within them.

Witness Article I of the

Constitution which excludes the Indians within the states
from being counted in any enumeration of representatives.
Those are only the Indians within states that are spoken of,
The question in this case it seems to us is
whether the exclusive constitutional power of Congress to
deal with Indian tribes includes, as the constitutional
language itself suggests, commercial relations between the
white world and the Indian world.

It seems to us that that

was a matter that was confined by the Constitution to the
Congress, duly exercised in the non-*intercourse acts but
not entirely dependent upon that exercise.
Just as a.state cannot authorize the cessation
of Indian land today, regardless of the intercourse acts,
so today the states cannot tax or regulate commerce in
chatties between the Indian tribes and the white world.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN A. MACPHERSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. MACPHERSON:
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

My name is Ian Maepherson and I repre­

sent the appellees 3n thi3 case.
I think at the outset vrhat I would like to do is
point out a couple cf facts that were raised in the opening
remarks by both counsel for the taxpayer and the United
States as amicus curiae.
Mr. Lewis, on behalf of the taxpayer, has stated
in his opening remarks that there was an extensive regula­
tion and supervision of the purchase of these tractors.
A further examination of the facts will reveal, and the
record supports this — as a matter of fact, it was stipu­
lated in the agreed statement of facts upon which the
matter was submitted to the Superior Court on cross-motion
for summary judgment — that in addition to the visibleeconomic burden of the Arizona transaction privilege tax,
Central Machinery Company included as well as an undiffer­
entiated cost component the economic burdens of many of
its other state taxes, that is. Central Machinery Company,
it being a non-Indian Arizona corporation engaged in
business within the State of Arizona, at Casa Grande,

26
Arizona, which this Court may take note of and is stipu­
lated in the facts, is not located, within any reservation
whatsoever.

It is subject itself to a number of our state

/

taxes, state income taxes, state property taxes, and so on
and so forth.
The conomic burden of those taxes, to be distin­
guished of course from the legal incidence of the taxes,
were blended into the purchase price of all of the tractors.
Those undifferentiated cost burdens were approved in the
purchase order.

And I think at this point it is important

to note that the purchase order itself was approved on
February 22 of 197*1.

The purchase order listed not only

the individual tractors with an individual price for each
tractor but also a grand total for the total of the eleven
tractors, some $97,030, plus the visible economic burden
/

of some $2,900 for tie Arizona transaction privilege tax.
That purchase order was submitted to the Superin­
tendent of the Pima agency, that agent who has authority
over this particular reservation.

If the argument be made

that there was an extensive supervision of the purchase,
the fact is the record is barren of any indication other
than that the Commission of Indian Affairs or his delegate,
the Superintendent of the Pima agency, approved it, simply
rubber-stamped the purchase order that was put in front of
him.

27
QUESTION:

is there no superintendent of the Gila

River Reservation?
MR. MACPHERSOM:
my understanding.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is

The Gila River Indian Reservation is

within the jurisdiction of the Pima agent, I believe out
of Tucson.
In any event, with respect to the argument that
25 U.S.C. section 8l governs the result in this case, not­
withstanding the fact that Central Machinery had neither an
Indian traders license nor an itinerant peddlers permit,
that section 8i applies, that is the general power to ap­
prove contracts, the fact of the matter is that the Pima
agent did not reject that cost that was included with the
purchase order, he specifically approved It.
Now, with respect to the Warren Trading Post
case, that fact situation fits precisely into the opinion
rendered by Assistant Solicitor Harper in 58 I.D. 562.
upon which this Court relied and cited with approval in
the Warren Trading Post ease.

In that particular Interior

Department opinion, it was specifically provided that where
a purchase order is issued to a merchant doing business off
the reservation, they are subject to state taxes, including,
if the Court please, those purchases which relate to items,
goods, whatever, for a specific program of Indian develop­
ment.

In doing so, Assistant Solicitor Harper overruled a

28
prior provision in 57 I.D. 124.
Previously3 the opinion of the Interior Depart­
ment had been that these purchases being for Indian develop­
ment and in view of the "confused state of the law at the
time,” were felt at that time not by Solicitor Harper but
rather Mr, Kirgis tc be exempt from state taxation.
In 58 I.D. 562, on the other hand, Solicitor
Harper specifically points out that based upon this Court’s
decision In cases, among others3 James 1. Bravo, the
Penderes case — these are all included within the Interior
Department opinion, that in fact It now, that is in 19439
some three years after the rendition of the prior opinion,
it appeared that, based on this Court’s rulings in Inter1. state Commerce cases, federal Immunity cases, that the
mere fact that the economic burdens of some state taxes
;

might be borne by the federal government was not in itself
'enough to infringe upon the immunity of the ultimate
sovereign in this nation, the United States government it­
self.
QUESTION:

Mr. Macpherson, isn’t there a body of

law to the effect that the representatives of the United
States government cannot estop It, that Is that just be­
cause the

representative of the government makes a state­

ment or a decision that a federal statute is to be applied
in a particular way some time ago does not necessarily

29
conclude the government on that point?
MR. MACPHERSON:
am not arguing estoppel.

That is correct, Your Honor.

I

I am arguing that 53 I.D. 562

articulates a rule even under Warren Trading Post as it
stands right now, that where the purchase order is issued
to a merchant off the reservation it is subject to taxation,,
This in fact is consistent at least in 4Arizona’s view with
the subsequent decisions of this Court in cases including
Gurley v„ Rhoden and various other of this Court's decisions
relating to the federal government’s immunity from taxation.
QUESTION:

Would there be tax exemption if it was

a e.o.ci. transaction?
MR. MACPHERSON:
QUESTION:

Mr. Justice Burger —

The tractor delivered on the reserva­

tion and cash on delivery at that time?
MR. MACPHERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, in that regard

— and I will apologize to the Court — I do not have a
transcript of the oral argument which was held in the
Arizona Supreme Court with respect to this, but with due
respect to Mr. Lewis* recollection of that argument, it is
my recollection that the position was taken at that time
that where a c.o.d. delivery was made on the reservation,
that that indeed would also be exempt.

Now, Mr. Lewis may

wish to correct me on that, but that is my recollection.
It is the State of Arizona’s position in this

30
case that if there were a c.o.d. delivery on the reserva­
tion with respect ----- well, in point of fact that is essen­
tially what vte have here.

The taxable activity in Arizona’s

estimation, contrary and. distinct from the taxpayer’s
assertion as well as the United States, is not the sale.
Arizona does not have a sales tax.
sales taxes.

Many other states have

Maryland, Virginia, indeed the District of

Columbia has a sales tax.

It is an excise tax placed upon,

the actual transfer event, and in general, indeed all
three of those named jurisdictions have a requirement that
the legal obligation for that tax, although there may be
a collection requirement from the vendor, ultimately rests
by mandate of the organic law of those jurisdictions upon
the vendee.

Arizona does not have that kind of a law.

It

is a transaction privilege tax.
QUESTION:

But Arizona doesn't prevent the

vendor from passing along the tax to the vendors?
MR. MACPHERSON:

That is correct, Your Honor. It

neither prevents it nor does it require it.

It is no mo­

How the vendor goes about collecting

this cost from his customer is separate and apart from
whether or not he has a liability for it.
QUESTION:

But the general practice is to pass

it along, isn’t it?
MR. MACPHERSON:

Mr. Justice —

31
QUESTION:

You have already told us that was done

in this case,
MRo MACPHERSON:

That’s correct.

That arises,

however, by virtue of contractual negotiation and no mandate
of state law whatsoever.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

You have told us

that, but the general practice and I suppose therefore the
expectation is that it will be passed along to their retail
customer.
MR. MACPHERSON:

Your Honor, if the term ’’expecta­

tion" is used in the context of a requirement of state law,
i

I would not —
QUESTION:

You told us that it is not required by

state law, but I asked you about the general practice„
MR. MACPHERSON:
QUESTION:

It is to pass it along, isn’t it?

MR. MACPHERSON:
rect,

Yes.

Your Honor, that is quite cor­

As a business practice, the economic burden of the

tax is passed along, along with the burden of all the other
costs the vendor has, including his other economic burdens
of taxes, his costs of acquisition, his labor expenses, his
fuels, electricity expenses.

Those are all matters of

contract.
In this regard, I would submit to the Court that
the fact that the economic burden of these taxes may be

32
borne by an Indian tribe or an Indian on the reservation
indeed might constitute nothing more than a manifestation
of the right, the exercise of the right of self-government.
One of the attributes of the exercise of self-government
surely must be the right to contract.

They have the right

to contract and negotiate as to the price, v/hich indeed they
did as to the price of the tractors, including, they have
stipulated, the concealed economic burdens of these other
taxes»
It appears that the argument boils doxtn to nothing
more than an objection not to the species of the costs,
i.e., state tax, but rather the visibility of the tax.

For

example, if Central Machinery Company had attempted to con­
ceal the economic burden of this $2,900 charge within the
purchase price and submitted that without a separate state­
ment, the State of Arizona would submit that if consistency
is to brought to the taxpayers and United States position,
that it would have been approved because they did the same
thing with respect to the other burdens which were con­
cealed.
Returning if I may to the point that Arizona does
not have a sales tax, Arizona indeed has a business excise
tax, it is denominated the Arizona transaction privilege
tax.

It has as its taxable event not the sale transaction,

it has as its taxable extent engaging in business within

33
Arizona.
QUESTION:

Does state law require that the amount

of the tax be disclosed at the time of the transaction?
MR. MACPHERSON:
QUESTION:

It does not.

And is it uniformally disclosed as a

matter of practice?
MR. MACPHERSON:

Your Honor, I can’t speak for

the some 100,000 vendors in the State of Arizona, but as a
general practice, yes, it is separately stated.
QUESTION:

If you bought an item in a department

store, would the sales ticket reflect the tax?
MR. MACPHERSON:
QUESTION:

It does indeed.

What if the tribe had contracted for

these tractors in Oklahoma and delivered themselves on
over-the-road trucks to their reservation, is there any
Arizona tax on them?
MR. MACPHERSON:

are all of the negotiations done through the out-of-state
vendor?

QUESTION:

Why not?

<11 . MACPHERSON:

Why do you concede that?

Because they are an Indian tribe

located on an Indian reservation.

This Court's decisions

in Bryan v. Itasca County and McClanahan preclude that.
QUESTION:

Apart from our Court's decision, just

to get the theoretical basis more, what is the reasoning

35
that there cannot be a tax on that other than the Court has
said so?

Is there a legal reason for those cases?
MR» MACPHERSON:
QUESTION:

Apart from the Court’s decision?

What is the underlying rationale of

the Court’s decisions as you understand them?
MR. MACPHERSON:

As I understand the rationale of

both Bryan and McClanahan, the state taxes in both of those
cases which were being attempted to be imposed were sought
to be imposed directly upon an Indian on an Indian reserva­
tion.

I am asking you what is wrong with

that.

I am asking: you why cannot that be

Is it a constitutional reason or a statutory reason

or just some general reason of judicial policy?
MR. MACPHERSON:

Mr. Justice Stevens, it is my

understanding that under the commerce clause as well as
perhaps the supremacy clause the states are without power
to impose the direct legal obligation for 3tate taxes upon
Indians on Indian reservations.

This traces back to this

Court’s decision in Worcester.
QUESTION:

It has some relationship to Indian

tribal sovereignty, I take it.
MR. MACPHERSON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

36-37
Again, some
QUESTION:
Why

Why doesn't that rationale apply here?

I am trying to identify the rationale, my next question

would be why is not that rationale applied here.

That is

pretty obvious that is why I am asking these questions, I
suppose»
MR. MACPHERSON:

Well, if I may, Your Honor,

there being no mandate of state law to transfer the obliga^r

tion for the tax, that is the legal liability for the tax
to the vendee in Arizona, the legal liability remaining by
mandate of state law upon the non-indian Central Machinery
Company off the reservation, and again the taxable event
being not the sale but engaging in business in the state
of Arizona*
Upon that basis, it is Arizona's position that
the tax can apply.

This is consistent we submit with

numerous decisions, the most recent of which is the opinion
authored by Mr. Justice Rehnquist in part four of the Moe
decision.

The mere fact that the economic burdens as op­

posed to the legal obligations for taxes may be visited
by contract rather than state law upon Indians does not
per se result in a violation of —
QUESTION:

Do you think it makes any difference

whether it is a tribe or an individual Indian that is in-e­
volved?

38
MR. MACPHERSON:
me. why.

Your Honor, it may but it escapes

In both Bryan v. Itasca County and McClanahan we

had Individual Indians involved.

However, in McClanahan

part of the rationale for the decision was that the imposi­
tion of the tax upon Rosalind McClanahan would interfere
with the Navaho Tribe’s right of self-government, so there
is a relationship.

I am not sure that is a satisfactory

answer for Your Honor.
QUESTION: I just find this a very confusing
/
'
area and I am asking question’s because i am trying to
understand It.

I don’t know if it is a satisfactory answer

or note
MR. MACPHERSON:

If I may, by way of further

explanation, the fact of the matter is that Arizona be­
lieves after an examination not only of the Warren Trading
Post decision but the Warren Trading Post briefs and indeed
the tape of the oral argument in the Warren Trading Post
decision maintains that these taxes are not preempted.

They are not preempted.

Indeed, some *50 or 50 minutes

into the tape, counsel for Warren Trading Post in oral
argument conceded — and this again gets Into the question
of the Buck Act — that if the Buck Act applied to Indian
reservations, he would have no case.

I mean, that admis­

sion Is made.
With that aside, the point is that Warren Trading

39
Post as it stands right now is distinguishable from the
fact xve have here.

In Warren Trading Post, both the tax­

able event, i.e., engaging in business, as well as the
measure of the taxable event, a distinct entity under
Arizona law as confirmed by this Court’s decisions in
Gurley v. Rhoden and American Oil v. Neill, the measure
of the event also ocurred on the Indian reservation.

We

had both things occurring on the Indian reservation.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose we agreed with you in

this case and then Central decided, well, we have read
that opinion and so we are going to open a branch on the
reservation, they had an office on the reservation.

They

either were licensed or they weren’t, but I gather you
don't think it makes any difference.

Could you collect

from them then if fcbey made exactly the same kind of sale,
the only thing is they had an office on the reservation
and made the sale out of there.

Warren Trading Post.
QUESTION:

As a condition -—
It may, but I take it on your rationale

I would think you wculd want to cut into Warren Trading

We’ve done something like that,

Your Honor, at least we are suggesting that a reexamination

of the rationale of Warren ~
QUESTION:

Exactly.

So I would think you would

say that under your current rationale you would be able to
collect even if they moved into an office on the reservation
and made the sale out of there.
MR. MACPHERSON:

Your Honor is correct.

If indeed

the Court is willing to at least reexamine the Warren
Trading Post decision, that might be true, and. —
QUESTION:

Let me ask this, both in this case

and the next one, as I understand it, to rexamine what is
said in that- footnote in Warren Trading Post about the Buck
Act.
MR. MACPHERSON:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

But

in further response —
QUESTION:

But you submit that in this case at

least even if we don’t do that you nonetheless must prevail?
MR. MACPHERSON:

That’s correct. Your Honor.

The

fact of the matter is that under Warren Trading Post as it
stands right now, a condition precedent to Central Machinery
Company’s opening a branch office, as it were, on the
reservation is the application for and acquisition of a
federal Indian traders license.

There is no exception in

the statute that I can see that says that, well, you don t
need a license because somehow we are otherwise regulated.
There Is no exception like that.

As a matter of fact, the

dissenting opinion cf Justice Lockwood in the Arizona
Supreme Court's decision in the Warren Trading Post case,
which this Court of course overruled, Justice Lockwood
specifically said that the reason that this is preempted is
because Warren Trading Post had acquired a federal Indian
traders license, was in compliance with federal statutes,
was extensively and pervasively regulated and therefore
preemption, must apply.

Indeed, that same rationale as

advanced by Warren Trading Post in the oral argument

as

a mtter of fact, of interest to the State of Arizona —- is
that fact that Central Machinery Company in the reply brief
makes reference to Complete Auto Transit v. Brady, this
Court's decision in Complete Auto.
The fact of the matter is that one of the rulings,
perhaps the major ruling in Complete Auto Transit, is the
overruling of Spectre Motor Service v. 0’Connor*

Spectre

Motor Service v. O’Connor was the cornerstone case in
Warren Trading Post's position.

Warren Trading Post did

not initially advance as its primary argument preemption*
What it argued was that under Spectre there is a prohibition
upon state taxes upon the privilege of engaging in inter­
state commerce, and because of that prohibition in Spectre
the State of Arizona did not have jurisdiction to impose
the tax.

That is the same rationale at least on that point

that the New Mexico Supreme Court went through in Your Pood

Stores v. Espanola.
Well, we have attempted, in our brief to trace
the history and underlying facts surrounding the Your Food
Stores decision.

We also point out that the question of

whether or not a state may impose a privilege tax on the
business of engaging in interstate commerce, this court has
resolvedo

That is what Complete Auto transit doe30
Now, if the argument is being made that somehow

Complete Auto Transit is relevant for purposes of saying
that we can’t do this, that a state’s determination as to
the nature of its tax are not binding upon this Court, the
fact remains that this Court has held that a state court’s
determination as to the nature of its tax as opposed to
where the legal incidence falls, at least in federal contex
— and we have footnoted this Court’s prior decisions in
First Agricultural Bank and most recently Diamond National
—“ that is a distinct consideration from the question of
the highest state court’s determination as to the nature of
its tax.
Arisona’s Supreme Court has consistently since
1935, when the transaction privilege tax was initially en­
acted, has construed it to be a transaction privilege tax.
It was not a sales tax.
Furthermore, the Warren Trading Post case is
distinguishable because the area that has been preempted

43
under Warren Trading; Post is not commerce with Indian
tribes»

Moe establishes that.

The area that has been pre­

empted is engaging in the business of Indian trading on an
Indian reservation.

Again, an examination of the oral

argument In Warren Trading Post , it does not appear from
the record, it does not appear in the Warren Trading Post
briefs, but an examination of the tape will reveal that
some 95 percent of the sales of Warren Trading Post Company
were with Indians.

This is the only transaction so far as

we know that transpired between Central Machinery Company
and the Gila River Farms.
Based upon those facts, If it please the Court,
it strikes Arizona as being somewhat curious to character­
ise Central Machinery Company as being engaged in the
business of Indian trading on an Indian reservation.
are not Indian traders.
ant peddlers.

They

Furthermore, they are not itiner­

They don5t fall within the class that is

entitled to hold either an itinerant peddlers permit or an
Indian traders license.
We furthermore maintain that with respect to
these arguments of infringement with tribal self-government,
the decisions of this — well, state court decisions in
which this Court has denied or dismissed the appeal for lack
of substantial federal question, the Kahn case and the Makah
ease are both highly relevant, particularly Makah.

44
In Makahs the Washington cigarette tax wa3 in­
volved and the taxable activity, taxable event ook place
off the reservation, there was an increase in the price to
the Indians, nevertheless the tax was upheld.

The Court

cited the decision In the Minot case in support of that
result, and this Court dismissed.
QUESTION:

Is there any contention as you under­

stand it, Mr. Macpherson, made by the government or by the
tribe that the Central Machinery Company was in violation
of federal law or regulation because it had not obtained a
license and nonetheless done business with the Indians?
MR. MACPHERSON:
contrary.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, quite the

The position appears to be that under 25 U.S.C.

section 3l they were in full compliance.

They didn’t need

to get a. traders license, they didn’t need to get an
Itinerant peddlers permit because the contract itself had
been approved and. there had been this apparent pervasive
regulation that authorised it.

There Is no suggestion so

far as I car tell that the federal government was doing
anything

other than what it should be doing.
It approved the purchase order.

And what did

It approved the

economic burdens of the concealed state taxes within the
purchase price.

It also approved the visible economic

burden.
QUESTION:

be subject to some indirect taxes, it doesn’t mean that
they are automatically subject to all other more visible
taxes, does it?
MR. MACPHERSON:
correct.

the printing of the appendix, the purchase order has nothing
on it suggesting that it is paid under protest.
