PROCEEDI N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Cecil A. Andrus, Secretary of Interior,
V. Idaho.
Mr. Smith, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case comas here on a writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

It

presents the question whether the Carey Act of 1894 requires
the Secretary of Interior indefinitely to reserve from
appropriation for other public qr private uses some 2.4 million
acres of desert land within Idaho to the eventuality that the
State may be able and willing to select all or any part of
such acreage to irrigation and reclamation under this statute.
The statute is set forth at pages 2 through 5 of
the petition.

Its language in our view is clear and direct.

It authorises the Secretary of Interior with the approval of
i ••.a President is as the statuta says authorised and empowered •
upon proper application of the State to contract and agree
from time to time with each of the States to enter into
contracts with the States which will then be binding upon the
United States to donate, grant and patent to the State certain

desert lands not exceeding a particular amount of acreage in
each State on the condition that the State cause them to be
irrigated, reclaimed and occupied„
The statute provides that after the Secretary approves
the State application for <a grant the land is then segregated
from the public domain for a period of 3 to 15 years to permit
the State to undertake the required required reclamati.on and
irrigation,
QUESTION:

Mr, Smith, you say that the question

presented is whether the Secretary of Interior must reserve
indefinitely the 3 million acres reserved or mentioned in the
Carey Act,

Actually, all we have before us in this ca.se is

an application for 27,000,
MR,. SMITH:
Rehnquist

Well, that is the way, Mr, Justice

the case originally arose on the State's application

for a 21,400-acre tract, to reserve that wider the temporary
withdrawal statute of 1910 which permits the State to ask for
a temporary segregation in advance of a plan.

That application,

was rejected by the Bureau of land Management for the reason
that some of that land was being used '-for stock driveway purports
The State then appealed that determination to the Interior
Board of land Appeals and that body, that administrative body
wi thin Interior affirmed and rejected the State’s argument
ich in part was focused on that particular tract.

But tha

ate then began to make a broader argument that it was entitled

5
to have a reservation of its maximum quota under the Act.
While the case was pending in the Interior Board of Land
Appeals the State brought this action in the District Court
of Idaho for broad declaratory relief and specifically it
asked for a declaratory judgment that the State have an
absolute right to demand up to 3 million acres of desert land
and that the Board of Land Management — the Bureau of Land
Management', that is, has no discretion to deny a request for
segregation of desert land.
So the case originally irose out of this narrow
application but it became broader as the State requested
broader relief, a relief which the District Court granted
and which the Court of Appeals affirmed.
QUESTION:

The State is bound by the controversy

and all the other related requirements of Article 3 the same
way any other litigant is.
MR. SMITH:

I couldn’t agree with you more.

I think

there is a case of controversy here because the judgment of
the District Court as affirmed by the Court of Appeals is
bef( re this Court requiring the Secretary of the Interior to
withdraw and — yon know, to withdraw, fee manage the public
land, in a 'way to insure that Idaho will ultimately get its
3 million-acre quota.

In fact the judgment says that Idaho

is entitled to have withdrawn and patented 3 million acres
provided that there are lands of such character and kind and

6
that the State fulfills the conditions

So there is — I

think the controversy between the parties is now altered, you
know, the propriety of this judgment,although I agree with
you that originally the case started with this application for
a withdrawal of a particular tract„
QUESTION5

Well, what, if we were to say that the

Secretary's action in declining the 27,000-*acr© request was
perfectly proper if it is reviewable at all.

Would we then

have to go on and expatiate the way the District Court and the
Court of Appeals —
SMITHs

I think that you would have to go on

to the extent that, you know, we have this judgment binding the
Secretary of Interior to reserve, you know, on the eventuality •
the 3 million acres on the eventuality..—
QUESTION;

If we just vacated the judgment that would

got rid of it, wouldn’t it?
MR, SMITH;

It would, get rid of it, although I

think, you know, I think that there is a, you know, a case
where controversy between the parties as to the — as to the
union of the Act and — because I think f.v* State has brought
a lawsuit

I — you know, I think the chronology of it, is

such that the case arose under the particular application for
the 17,4 00-acre -tract.
QUESTIONS Do you think the District Court held that
if — and the Court of Appeals — that if the Secretary has

7
withdrawn *md pit to other Federal uses all of the public land
so there is none of the 3 million is leftP it has all been
withdrawn, all put to some other uses, for stock driveways or
something.

The District Court did say that the Secretary

must entertain a petition for reclassification.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
it.

Right?

Yes.
And that ha could not arbitrarily deny

But the District Court did not hold that he had to grant

a request for reclassification.
MR. SMITH:

1 think that the — I think that the

fact that the District Court, you know, granted the State's,
you know, request for declaratory relief, ordering the
Secretary to have it withdrawn and Idaho was entitled to have
it withdrawn and. patented 3 million acres of lanci, I think
from the Secretary's point of view if he were to allocate
public lands for other purposes under the host of other
Federal statutes that h© administers for other public
domain -QUESTION:

Your answer to my question is that, yes,

the District Court did hold that ha would have to reclassify
or
MRc SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
right.

Yes, I think that's —
—* or withdraw all these lands.
I think that's right.

I think that's

And I think that the Court — that is before the

8

Court„
QUESTIONS Do you think that the day after the Caray
Act was passed Idaho could have gone into Federal District
Court in Idaho md asked for this sort of declaratory judgment,
not that it was ready with any plan but just requiring the
Secretary to make sure it did not let the original one million
acres go?
MR, SMITH;

Well, if the Idaho — you know, I think

we would take the position that Idaho would not be entitled
to, you know, that kind of relief.

But I don’t so© any, any,

any, you knew, anything that would, you know, prevent Idaho
from doing it,

And if a court like this District Court was

to so hold I think that the Secretary would be before a
reviewing; court the .way we have petitioned here,
QUESTION:

Yes, but to put it another way, as

2

understand if the Government's claim is that if the day after
•the Carey Act was passed Idaho came in and asked for anything,
whether 3 million acres or none, or even if it said it was
ready and satisfied all the conditions, that the Secretary
has discretion to say "no*5 to Idaho.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Exactly.
And. it doesn't need to reserve anything,

no matter how much land is available.
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION:

That is your position.

That’s our position,
And if that is your position it seems to

9
that Idaho certainly h< s a Case of controversy with you.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Is this the view the Government expressed

to Idaho in the administrative proceedings?
MR. SMITH?

Is is the view that the Government

expressed to Idaho in the administrative proceedings?
QUESTION:
get this settled.

Yes.

So Idaho said that we should really

At least as long as some land is un­

withdrawn , at least as long as there is some available we
are entitled to it.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION;
MR. SMITH:

And you say absolutely not.
Exactly.
You have complete discretion,.
Exactly.

The argument was made below

where the State was arguing the Carey Act gave it, you know,
the day it was enacted gave it an absolute right to 3 million
acres.

The District Court rejected the argument that the —

Is there a word in the District Court*s

: ,-.c tha issue you an arguing here?
MR. SMITH?
QUESTION?

Yes.
I know there ie in the judgment.

But,

in its opinion?
MR. SMITH:

1 think so.

QUESTION?

You think so.

MR. SMITH s

If you will look on — may I refer the

Court to page 13-A of the appendix to the petition where the

10
Court says that an in praesenti grant of title did not occur
under the Carey Act seems quite clear from the language of the
Act, the legislative history, administrative interpretations
and court interpretations albeit dicta.

It is likewise clear

however that the Carey Act and subsequent enactments conferred
upon the State of Idaho a right of entitlement to 3 million
acres of desert land, etc.
And I think that is in the opinion,
QUESTION:

But they didn’t argue that in their

complaint»
Their theory as I understood it was that they had
a present grant of 3 million acres and tho court rejected that
aro; ument»
MR, SMITH:
million acres.

That they have & present grant of 3

Well, t mean the District Court interpreted,

you know, their claim to an in praesenti grant the right
to a, you know, a particular 3 million acres.

And it said

that the State didn’t have a right, to any particular 3 million
acres but it decs have a right to 3 million acres of suitable
desert land and that the Secretary has to manage the —
QUESTION:

This argument was made, as I understood

it, to nay that the 27,00(2 acres that ha3 been preempted for
highway rights- '.f-w-ay or something or otiar — I forget what
it was —».but that preemption by the Secretary was invalid —
or reservation by the Secretary was invalid because the land

11
had previously been made available to the State.

Wasw't that

their position?
MR. SMITH:

No.

Mo.

Their position was on that —

the position on the — they did appeal — their in praesenti
argument went to the 27,400 acre thing.
they had a right to that.

They said basically

1 think perhaps we are saying the

same thing, that they did have a right to that particular
land arc! they appealed to the Court of Appeals, you know, on
their in praesenti grant.

But the Secretary also appealed to

the Court of Appeals saying that the District Court was wrong
in saying that they ha-3 any right to any particular —

MR. SMITH:

There are some 11 million aeras, I think,

total overall, the States that the Carey Act •—
QUESTION:

How can this controversy ba ripe until

some unreserved acreage is requested by the State and the
Secretary refuses to -MR. SMITH:

I think Mr. Justice Stevens that the

controversy is ripe to the extent that the State has asked the
District Court and the District Court has granted this
declaratory relief essentially —
QUESTION:

Suppose he had vacated it and started all

over, hew would anybody be hurt?

Shouldn’t we pres time the

Secretary will in due course if there is acreage available give

12
it to the State when they request it in a proper way1
MR. SMITH:

And then they will not be because as

I think we point out and argue at great length there are a
host of Federal statutes.

The Secretary has to man&ga, you

know, public domain unclear a variety of statutes.

I think

that this — I think that to the extent that parties and the
Western States need clarification as to the meaning of the
Carey Act.
QUESTION:

Well, why do they need it until they have

asked for some laid that they haven't been allowed to get?
MR. SMITH;

theory.

There was a present grant of 3 million acres.

And

the District Court rejected that.
MR. SMITH:

Yes.

Loo!; at page 5.

It says, "The

defendant's• agent has notified plaintiff he will now allow
the requests for segregation or withdrawal under the Carav
Act as a matter of right.

The defendant specifically alleges

that he has the authority to determine what lands are suitable
for disposal under the Carey Act, even though the lands
ret ised to be granted ars in fact desert and suitable; for
agricultural use and settlement ... the plaintiff believes
that these lands are subject to temporary withdrawal."

X don’t soe how you could just bring in

Say you have got 11 million acres available and

we want to know for sure that you are going to save 3 million
acres for us,
Why don't they just ask for the 3 million acres?
MR. SMITH;

Well, they could have identified ■—

QUESTIpS.Ni s* They did.,

Those that were identified

14
held they are not entitled to.
MR. SMITH:

Exactly.

But I think — I think the

difference between the administrative proceeding ana this
lawsuit can b© best highlighted by the fact that while the
State — while the State was — while the administrative action
was pending in the Interior Board of Land Appeals, the State
brought this action for broader declaratory relief.

And that

relief I think the District Court grappled with and determined
it was appropriate,

It did reject the in praesenti argument

but it did nevertheless hold.

And I think that the opinion

couldn't really be any clearer, that the Carey Act confers
uprm a State.a right of entitlement to 3 million acres.
It*s the serious of that judgment that caused —

You sire correct, you. corred ma in the

But why wouldn’t it b® a proper disposition of the

case to do what Mr. Justice Rehnqulst, I believe, suggested,
to simply vacate the judgment end if the problem ever becomes
rips there will be plenty of time to litigate it?
MR. SMITH i

1 could not state to you with complete

certainty that that would not be an appropriate thing to do.
But I can say to you, number one, that we think that the
broader relief that the State has requested and the broader
relie£ that the District Court has granted has put this
question before the Court.

Since this cats® has come the;

I am totally baffled because I read the

MR. SMITHs

Wall, I think the District Court — I

bar to go back

ind petition for reclassification of the 27,OOP

under the Carey Act.

That was the impression — that was the

impression 1 got from the —

Certainly that is the intimation at the

bottom of page 18-A of the petition where the District Court

says, “However, the state may not perfunctorily select acreage

It just said it should not be arbitrarily

denied.
MR. SMITH;

Should not be arbitrarily denied -~

QUESTION:

And your issue with the District Court

is that you shouldn't
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

We shouldn't have to be —
you shouldn't be subject to any

petition for reclassification.
MR. SMITH:

Exactly.

Because our view of the matter

is that the Secretary has complete discretion as to whether
to grant applications under the Carey Act.
QUESTION:

Well * is that re ally.-a case.; of. Artisla

3 lawsuit where the Government says we ought to win on this
ground and the District Court says you ought to win on a
narrower ground?
MR. SMITH:

Well, I think — I think it is full of

controversy between the parties.
QUESTION:

The District Court would subject you to

further procedures which you say you shouldn't be subjected
to,
MR. SMITH:

Absolutely.

And I think under this

particular judgment the Secretary is now bound to administer
all the statutes with an eye to making sure that it doesn't
invade the so-called quotas under the Carey Act.

And, in our

18
that is, you know, that is an impossible narrowing of his
discretion under, for example, the latest Federal Management
Land Policy Act of 19 76 which is supposed to charge the
Secretary with putting all the public domain to the best
possible uses, it would be impossible for him to do that
knowing that he had this Damcclean Carey Act sword over his
head which would require him to reserve this desert land for
the eventuality —
QUESTION;

St isn't a sword as long as he has still

got 11 million acres that are available.
MB a SMITH

That is 11 million acres I think across

the board throughout all the States.
QUESTION;
MR. SMITH?

How much is there in Idaho?
I think it — X am not really sure how

much there is in Idaho,
QUESTION?

Well, it is a lot mere than 3 million

acres.
MR. SMITH?

Yes,

But I mean presumably even if

there is a lot more than 3 million aeras I think that the
Secretary would —
j

QUESTION;

As I understand it, the Government is to

save at least 3 million acres,
MR. SMITH:

Yes,

But, Mr, Justice Stevens, assuming,

you know, if the Secretary was to allocate lands, desert lands
for a lot of other purposes under a. variety of other statutes.

.19

he would still have to make sure that he kept at least 3
rail''.ion acres and, you know, the —
QUESTION:

The present indication is he intends to

do that.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes. but, you know ~I thought it was 11 million acres.

X am wrong, I don’t know.

Maybe

But as long as there is four or

five times as much land as might be needed to fulfill the
commitment made in 1894 — assuming there was a commitment
or the tender or whatever you might describe it —* I just
don’t see any Damoclear» sword over anybody.

If they

came

in and asked for some land and the Secretary turns it down,
sure, you have got a lawsuit.
MR. SMITH:

I can't belabor the point but 1 think

that is e., ictly what happened, here, they came in and asked
for some land, the Secretary turned them down and —
QUESTION:

And the court said hie turned them down

properly.
MR. SMITH:

hnd we say they turned them down properly

and they say their point is that in 1894 when Congress passed
this statute that they had — they have a right to the quota,
knd the Secretary says "so."

Because in fact while there arc

a host of «statutes now, even in 1694 there was the Desert
Land Act of 1877 and the Secretary presumably —
QUESTION:

It shows how ripe this case is.

The

20
sanie issue has been available for 40 or 50 years and no
problem arose ~~

MR. SMITH:
QUESTIGN:
MR. SMITH:

Well, the problem -~
—- for 80 years , really.
Wall, the problem is before the Court

really because of —
QUESTION:

Because the 27,000-acre application was

denied.
MR. SMITHs

Mo.

I was going to say that the

problem ~~ the problem has become more current than needs
resolution because the deep well technology has made irrigation
much more feasible.

I mean there haven’t been any Carey Act

grants since the. 19 30's and the reason was because most of the
desert land that existed existed, you know, it was there and
it was unirrigetable.
v/sll, I don’t think, you know, there, is anything
•i

Riot i to say on the case.

I simply want to say that our

art .anent 'rasta on three? prongs which we think convincingly
refite that the District Court’s, that the Court q.f Appeals
.decision is incorrect, that the plain language of -the status
gives the Secretary dismetien.

I need only point to pages

2 to 5 of the petition which talks about Authorising and
empowering the Secretary upor proper application.

It talks

about entering into a contract which then becomes binding
upon th<3 United States,

The statute itself doesn’t talk about

21

a binding right*

There are a host of Land Grant statutes

that give absoluta grants*

This is not one of those statutes*

The Swamp Land Act of the 18503s was such an absolute grant
and the legislative history specifically distinguished that
kind of statute from this kind of statute*
I might also point out to the Court that th-s second
paragraph on page 3 of the petition talks about before the
application of ray State is allowed.

The clear implication

of that language is that an application of a State may not be
allowed.

And in fact 19C8 the reports of the Secretary of

Interior were replete with statistics indicating that many
applications were denied*

1

don't think there was any

question that peoples realised*, tho people in the Western
States realized that applications under the Carey Act conii
b® and were being denied routinely»
QUESTIONi

Do you think the Secretary has the power

to deny without any judicial review under the Overton Park
theory that there is simply no standard set forth by which he
may determine whether to grant or deny?
HR. SMITE:

X think that is the. proper standard.

I think it is a question, you know., whether the Secretary is
being arbitrary and capricious.

I

don't think the Secretary

could announce that he is not taking any applications from.
Idaho,
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

MR. SMITH:

Well, I think the implication is that

the Secretary may have that in reserve? but I don't think ha
has .to say that.
QUESTION:

Why shouldn't he say so?

MR. SMITH: Wall, I don't, think he has to S£.y so.
It is possible that he could say so but I don't think the
.Act requires that ha say so.
QUESTION:

Does he have to have an administrative

record?
MR. SMITH:

Does he have to have an administrative

record?
QUESTION:
MR,. SMITH:

Is that required?
Under the Act?

QUESTION: Can he just say "no" without an administra­
tive record?
MR. SMITH:

I think he can say 'saf? but there is

an administrative record and 7. think that, you know, during
the administrative proceedings the Secretary, I think, you
knew, may well volunteer reasons as to why —- as to why —
QUESTION:y He could do it without it?

25
MR, SMITH:

Well, X think he could do it without

it.
QUESTION:

What, if the Secretary simply said the

Carey Act is an authorisation and nothing more and I just
don’t choose to allot under the Carey Act.

I realize I could

but I just don’t feel like doing it.
Would that be an adequate response?
MR. SMITH

Fell, it would depend.

I don't think

he could 'v ivy I don’t feel like allotting anything under the
Carey Act, period.

But I think ha could say, I don’t want to

grant this application tinder the Carey Act .
I think all that the Act requires him to do is to
give a good faith, you know, consideration of any Carey Act
application»
Congress, you know, in 1976 addressed the question

MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

We don’t know,
What?
We don’t know.
I think that the words of the statute,

I tl ink that’s what they connote.
I just want to close by saying that I think that the
consistent administrative interpretation also confirms our
argument that the Secretary has discretion.
If the Court has no further questions I would like

26
to save a few moments for rebuttal.
QUESTION:

Congress can give to one person the

untrammeled, uncontrolled discretion to give away my land
without giving any reason,
MR, SMITH:

Well, I would put it the other way, that

Congress can'give the untranimeled discretion of a particular
individual to preserve the public domain for the best
purposes.

Or he can give it away.
Or he can give it away and use it

according to its best life, according to its best use,.

Mr. Attorney General,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID H. LEROY, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF IDAEO ET AL,
MR. LEROY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a ease both novel and surprisingly novel
i r. that the Carey .Act was a noble experiment, a one-of-a-kind
statute unique in concept in 18S4 and never again duplicated;
novel in that unlike most Federal statutes it has only been
before th: j Court once in its 84 years of existence and
surprising in that the Act is before the Court again at all,
in that in the 19709s the Department of the Interior felt
that the Act was so obsolete and useless that it repealed all

27
of the Carey Act regulations, assuming that they would never
be used again.
But as the Solicitor made a brief reference,
technology and advances in deep well and the sprinkler systems
have now restored some possibility of achieving the original
/

congressional purpose and offer an opportunity to offset some
/

•

>

of the up to 2 million acres per year lost in farmland every
year.
QUESTIONt

They have discovered —- apparently they

have some deeper aquifers in Idaho that they want to 'cap?
HR. LEROY:

Mr. Justice white, there is continuing

investigation and review of those aquifers in a number of
contexts and more is being learned about them every day.

But

the technology and the efficiency and the economy of drawing
w&tc r in a well more cheaply and sprinkling it more effectively
is the chief reason that breathes life back .into this Act.
We would urge that this is a case of statutory interpretation
and that the Carey Act granted no such absolute discretion as
the Solicitor describes to the Secretary.
We would urge that there is an actual case or
controversy ripe £cs: ce: isideration in that the denials of this
■•articular application, even though it be on reserve land
where in feet is the XBfA ruled based upon an absolute;
Secretarial discretion which the Secretary suggested flowed
from the language, the history and the intent of the Carey

28
Act itself.

Perspective on the Carey Act is simple.

The

Congress in 1894 had both the -~
QUESTION:

Or:, the particular land that was the

subject of the application in dispute in this case, does
Idaho still contend that it is entitled to have those 27,,000
acres conveyed pursuant to the Carey Act?
MR. LEROY;

Your Honor, the basis for denial of

those acres —
QUESTION?

Ycu say they gave the wrong reason.

I

understand that.
MR. LEROYs
QUESTION?

—* was the Secretary's discretion.
You contend you are entitled to those

2,700 acres.
MR. LEROY:■

What the District. Courg suggested is

that we have an opportunity to go back in and should aeve if
the Carey Act is properly interpreted to petition for re**
classification,which Idaho would do.
tha

But; the Secretary says

he has the absolute discretion and will not permit us

eve;; to go back under the reclassification procedure, thus
an actual case or controversy is framed,
QUESTION:

Well, I am Still not quite clear on your

answer to my question.
Is Idaho still contending that it has a right to
these 27,000 acres?
MR. LEROY:

Idaho would contend. Your Honor, yes,

29
that we have the right to do what the District Court instructed
us to do, to petition for reclassification.

And the Secretary

would contend that we have no such right because he has
exercised his unfettered discretion.
QUESTIONS

You haven't answered his question yet.

Do you claim that reclassification must be granted?
MR. LEROY:
QUESTION:
MR. LEROY:

We claim as the District Court suggested
On these 27,000 acres?
We would so claim? yes.

But it would

be upon -— based upon evidence and material presented at a
reclassification hearing.
The proper perspective of the Carey Act
QUESTION:

Well, you deny then that a withdrawal

by the Secretary for another use by the United States is
enough to defeat a Carey Act claim?
MR. LEROY:
QUESTION:
MR. LEROY?

Yes, we would per &e when the Secretary You would or you do?
We do when the Secretary — especially

when the Secretary per se contends that he teas no authority.
QUESTIONi

What if his claim was:

Well, you don’t

get this land because we have already withdrawn it for sow;
other purpose and that ia enough of a reason.
MR. LEROY:

Then we would not so contend that we

would be automatically entitled to the land because we have
rejected the in praesenti theory

which we presented to the

i0

District Court.

We suggest now that the Carey Act is a

conditional grant conditioned upon the performance of certain
conditions which the Congress specifically outlined in 1894.
QUESTION:

Because I want to be sure I understand

your position.
It would be your view that you could,get the 27^000
acres by filing a petition for reclassification.

The issue

in that proceeding would be whether or not the 2?,.000 acres
had been properly withdrawn for stock driveway purposes.
MR. MEROYs
QUESTION:

Yes.

And the Secretary —

And if the withdrawal for those purposes

was authorised iy statute and was not an abuse of discretion,
then you would concede, as I understand it, that you would
have no Carey Act right to those 27,000 acres?
MR. LEROY:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Well, then, suppose the Secretary had

withdrawn for stock purposes or for all sorts of things all
but 2 million acres of the public land in Idaho.

And then

Idaho cante in and made a present claim for 3 million acres.
And suppose that all those — all the withdrawals had been
authorized by statute and were as fair as this withdrawal
was, supposedly.
I take it you would concede that Idaho would not
be entitled to its full 3 million acres.
MR. LEROY:

We would suggest at that point, yes,

31
Your Honor, that we would have been disadvantaged, though
we would suggest unfairly in that the Carey Act and this
entitlement flowing from the Act of 1894 should have been
originally considered when the Secretary went through the
machinations and considerations in all those other
reservations.

And in addition it is Important to note that

it is not likely or possible or feasible for a block of 3
million acres to be sought under the Carey Act,

And it is

also important to note that there is no such sword hanging
over the Secretary to make him discomfort his discretion in
this regard, there being 33 million acres as w© note in the
brief of Federal lands in Idaho, 12 million under the control
and discretion of the Secretary of the Interior and approasi**
mate.iy f ,5 million susceptible of possible irrigation that
is , till in Federal hands.
QUESTION:

What you are saying is that the Oar&y

Act is a factor that the Secretary has to take into consideration
in passing on any application for withdrawal of public lands?
MR, LEROY:
sense:

Mr, Justice Relinquish, it is in this

The Carey Act obviously by its terms identifies

no specific lands and v-a claim no entitlement as to any
specific parcel.

But as to a general right of entitlement

which ought to be considered by the Secretary in his
classification and planning process and should have be-en
since 1894, we urge that position cm the Court,

(

32

What the District Court9s position actually says
is that it draws a very careful distinction, it.suggests a very
careful balance between. the rights of the State and the rights
of the Secretary,rejecting the Idaho in praesenti argument,
rejecting the U.S. argument of outright discretion and
instead holding that there is e. right of entitlement under
the- Carey ilct created by the Congress, thet that right is
not so abciute that the State can perfunotorily select
any particular parcel of land it wishes for the Secretary
has other withdrawal authority, the authority if the State
meets the Carey Act conditions the Secretary has no unfettered
discretion to deny applications.

Fourth., if the land sought

iaa been withdrawn for other purposes the.’ State may apply
for reclassification, which petition should be handled in the
ordinary course arid subject to judicial review„

And fifth,

since Congrosc proscribed acreage entitlements to the State
in 1394 the Secretary should preserve suitable amounts on our
app ications as they come in over time.
That is exactly what the judge's decision did and
we suggest that that is a proper interpretation of the
legislative history, the language of the statute and it
properly addresses the -administrative and contemporaneous
construction - given to it by the agency „

The. language of the

statute —
OUESTION:

Mai? X ash you another question»

Under your understanding of the District Court
ruling, as long as at least 3 million acres remain unclassified
for any purpose, that are desert lend

and could

-

he selected by Idaho, would there be any violation of the
judgment?
MR. LEROY:

Not automatically, Tour Honor, where

the acreage and entitlement and reservation and potential for
Carey Act application was there.
QUESTION:

If that is true, is it not also true that

if the Secretary purported to withdraw so much that there was
less than 3 million available you would then have a right
under the judgment to enjoin him or prevent him from making
that additional withdrawal?
MR. LEROY:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Anything that invaded the 3 million would

he subject to reclassification and made available.

But if

;ihak is all true, hew can there be a present controversy
until you approach the area of withdrawal that would invade
the 3 million figure?
MR. LEROY:

There is a present case or controversy

bee use in this particular identification of acreage .a part
of that 3 million acres, the ZBXJL and the Secretary assert
that they can reject outright in their absolute discretion
our opportunity to petition them for a contract on that
acreage„

34
QUESTION :

It seems to me the easiest way to challenge

that is by making a request for some of that land and having
them do it.

In other words, they say they have the power.

But suppose they never exercised such arbitrary power, that
they always granted your application? so why do we have to
decide thin question?
MR. LEROY:

It is our suggestion to the Court that

the IB LA oxeraised exactly such an absolute discretion because
they intended to and said they did in this particular parcel
and acreage.
QUESTION:
MR. Li;ROY:
QUESTION:

The 27,000, that is withdrawn land.
Well, the parcel ia withdrawn.
You are complaining that they gave the

wrong reason for something they had a perfectly lawful right
to do, as I understand you.
MR. LEROYs

End they are suggesting that they will

net entertain, as the District Court suggest they must, our
petition for reclassification becaiise they have the absolute
.■.iscretioa under the Cr-rey Act not to do so.

But nothing

.-.bout the language of the Carey Act, nothing about the
legislative history of the Carey Act, nothing about the
contemporaneous construction of the Carey Act suggests any
such absolute discretion, to the Secretary.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, i take it from

‘ what — if 2 didn’t misunderstand Mr.- Smith, he said part of

35
this 27,000 acres had been withdrawn for stock driving
purpose.'.; .
MR, LEROY;;
is accurate.

Yes, Mr. Justice White, in fact that

There were four separate —

QUESTION:

Not all of it?

MR. LEROY: . No.

As to a Federal reclamation project,

as to a wildlife preserve, as to some State land grant exchanges,
Idaho did hot press its claim forward, showing again that: it
i.

is eminently possible for the State and the Secretary to work
in this fashion and acknowledge the Secretary's other duties
«
if the Secretary docs not have any such absolute discretion
as he assert5*/ falls from the Act of 1394; and that discretion
/

;

is simply npt there,

A study of the statutory language, a

s'

reference to the contract authority of the Secretary, the
special duties detailed to the Secretary, the legislative
debates aai discussions, none of those factors and features
make any mention of any general and unfettered discretion
to the Secretary.

The contract contemplated by the Carey

Act is nothing more or nothing loss than an agreement of
feasibility as to certain lands and a protection to the » ..
Statas end the settlors on those lands which are identified
id a «marantic that ss to dollars expended and efforts
expended the States and the settlers will be protected.
Congress had already in a sense by the terras of
the Act saads an offer to the States and the States accepted

36

that offer and it was that kind of arrangement, that kind of
conditional grant that the Carey Act contemplated»
Even the language of the Act the specific duties of
the Secretary are detailed to accept applications, review
maps and plans, to review for their sufficiency to accomplish

the irrigation needed and desired? as fast as adaquato proa :
is, received, to issue the patents and to produce such rules
and regulations but only as to the mode of proof and the mode

There is no general discretion encouraged or
authorised in the statutory language,

And if any such

QUESTION:

Do you think that a State, would have the

right to have set aside for Carey Act purposes land that had
bet.:. withdrawn for oil shale development* for leasing?
MB, LEROY:

Mr, Justice White* again the Secretary

in the new —
QUESTION?

“The Secretary."

How about Idaho’s

claim* would a 'Carey Act claim override such a. withdrawal?
MR, LEROY:
a withdrew!.

It would not automatically override such

The State would have the right to make -the

37
petition and the Secretary would have the right to balance
the equity
QUESTIONi

And you would at least have the right to

have it shown that the withdrawal was regular and authorised

by statute.
MR* LEROY;

Exactly.

And we would have the right

to require the Secretary to review the matter.
QUESTION;

General Leroy, supposing the oil shale

withdrawal covered 7 million acres, so there is less than 3
million would be available.
Would that be permittedunder your view?

It

clearly would not under the District judges’ analysis.
MR. LEROY;

Your Honor, again we would be entitled

to request of the Secretary and petition to him for Carey
Act application and withdrawal and -QUESTION;

As I understand his theory you wouldn't
i

vvan have to do that, they could not invade the 3 million —
they must reserve at all times at least 3 million acres for
Carey Act development.
MR. LEROY;

Justice White presented a harder case,

suggesting that lawful grants had already been issued dropping
us / slow the 3 million.
QUESTION:

But —

But that is not true.

But now wo are

talking about there now are more than 3 million acres available!
and the question is:

Under your interpretation of the District

38
Court's holding could the Secretary withdraw enough acreage
to invade the 3 million and have the withdrawal for the
purposes of shale oil?
MR, LEROY?

Not unless either Congress modified-the

Carey Act or Idaho modified its tanas and conditions of
acceptance of the Carey Act»
QUESTION:

What if -the Secretary in response to the

type of situation pcsed by -Justice Stevens said, "I recognise
the Carey Act, I recognise the Oil shale Act, it necessarily
requires me,/to balance the needs fox* uses of public land and
in --tlie exercise of my informed discretion I grant the Oil
Sha’a Act withdrawals. K
Would you feel that you had anything more than an
appeal to the Court of Appeals for abuse of discretion under
the Administrative Procedure Act?
MR. LEROY:

It would be our position, Mr, Justice

Rehnquist, that there is a conditional entitlement in an
already conceived congressional purpose flowing from 3.834»
We would acknowledge that the Acts and the management duties
r

•$-

: the Secretary need to be•read together»

xi* i..

We would not

necessarily presume that a court would find that the Carey
Act either was subservient to a later Act nor would we presume
that it w- aid override it.
I can’t answer the- question directly in that. I would
not guess what the Court might do.

But I would say that the

39

congressional entitlement from 1394 won'll be of equal dignity
before a court in its ~QUESTION :

Bur. not a flat prohibition against the

Secretary reserving into the 3 million allocated to Idaho
if he could sustain a classification to the satisfaction of
a judge reviewing it under the Administrative Procedure Act,
MR. iuESOYs

We would suggest that that would likely

be a result in the court.
QUESTIONS

Well * that would require — that is

inconsistent with the judgment of the District Court here,
MR. LEROY ?

Wot so in the sense that the judge

also acknowledges that reclassification procedure and judicial
review are available.

But in the sens® he says very directly

that 3 million acres ought to be reserved so that from, time
to time applications can be made» yes, it would be* slightly
inconsiste: .t.
QUESTION?

’’Ought to bo reserved,"

The words that

Mr. Smith called to my attention are "It is likewise clear
that the Carey Act conferred upon the State of Idaho a right
of entitlement to 3 million acres .of land suitable for
irrigation."
And X -think you are saying that if we have this
oil shale conflict problem way down in the future somewhere
we ought to decide that when it arises„ which is exactly what
I have been suggesting for some time here.

MR. LEROY:

Welly Tour Honor, There is aa entitlement

The entitlement flows from a congressional Act in 1894 and
as to other Acts including oil shale activities there would
necessarily be a reading together before a court of those.
But we contend before the Court that the District judge was
correct in urging an entitlement in the nature of a grant
upon conditions that flowed from the Carey Act.

We would

also urge that the Department of the Interior has not properlypresented to the Court their contemporaneous construction of

the Act.
Immediately after the Act in 18?4 a key to the ease
would bo a review of the regulations of the Department of The
interior.

In those regulations,the first promulgated under

■Authority of the Act, there was absolutely no mention of
Secretarial discretion.
And in 1895, the report to Concreas annually mad©
every year as House Document Ho. 5? the General Land Office
Commissioner to The Secretary said in characterising the
Carey Act that this is a form of agreement to donata a million
acres of desert land upon the condition — and continued on­
ward -*■

The Secretary to -she Congress described the Carey

Act as a grant condi ticked upon the reclamation and settlement,.
How, it is our contention that it m# Interior and
Rot Idaho that first characterised the Carey Act as a grant
upon condition

And in that same year 1895, Idaho accepted

41
a grant for the Cary Act by legislative activity that
specifically referred to the Carey Act as a grant.
The annual reports of the Department of -the Interior
reviewed from 1895 to 1905 contain grant language including
the 1895 reference to a grant condition and there is no
discretion mentioned.in the —
QUESTION:
f'.Jt LEROY?

What did Idaho do in 1895?
In 1895 Idaho became the second State

to through its State legislature pass a statute that accepted
/
S'

tbs .donati..,n, the grant cf Congress with regard to the Carey
Act: .

There were 12 such States in the West that accepted

that and each of those 12 States in one way or another discussed
the Carey Act. By that language 10 of the 12 States accepted
the grant of Congress 9 the grant that Congress intended in the
Carey Act.
QUESTION:

But did they set up a mechanism whereby

private settlers could make claims analagous to way you make
mineral claims or homestead claims by locating on the property
and residing on it for a year?
MR. LEROY:

Yes.

The purpose of those several.

Carey Acts were also to set up a structure whereby contracts
could be entered in with construction companies to construct
the works necessary to transport the waters long distances
and apply water to the land and as well contemplated boards
and land commissioners to receive applications and administer

42
the actual settlers who applied tinder the Act»
One of the greatest dignities in terms of the
departmental position of what the Carey Act actually meant
was its rules and regulations.

There have been five such

sets of rules and regulations promulgated between 1894 and
the time of this particular lawsuit.

In 1894 the regulations

immediately after the promulgation of the Act made no mention
of Secretarial discretion.

In 18SB the word "grant" was

mentioned four times in those regulationsc "discretion" not
mentioned at all.

"n 3902 the word “grant" was mentioned

four times, "discretion" was not mentioned at all except in
the context of a limited 1901 amendment.
And the 1902 regulations which provision became
identical and the 1909 regulations are very careful, a twostep process whereby the General Land Office would review
the applications and then upon their approval for that
technical sufficiency submit them to the Secretary„ the
regulation said"

“Upon approval a contract is executed by

idle Secretary -is directed by the Act."
That regulation continued in effect in 1909 'and
those 1909 regulations wore in effect until repealed in 1970.
We would urge that the Secretary by his administrative
construction neither contemplated discretion and characterized
to the contrary that the Act was in fact a grant fce the States
The dcctrine of contemporaneous consistent administra-

43
five construction suggests that if a statute is suceptible
of two reasonable interpretations and the Department adopts
/

Interpretation A, then great deference ought to be accorded
to A.

But it never said that if the Department adopts A-in 1835

and then somehow in 1977 and 1975 switches to 3, contending
that no. discretion and no mention of discretion has' become
absolute discretion, that the Court ought to attach any
,r

deference to the later construction.
Had Congress intended the Secretary to have any
absolute discretion of this typo so significant as to frustrate
the statutory purpose and the great noble objective of the
Carey Act, it certainly would have authorised it in clear
and specific language.
And we thus contend that both legislative history
and administrative construction suggests no such discretion
sxi ::,ted;
The subsequent Acts by Congress, indeed, also
cacteri.zed the Carey Act as a grant.
characterises it as a grant.

'The 1896 Amendment

In the 1901 Amendment the

.Congress dilustrated that it knew how to us® the words

"in

o.;Ls .discretion*' ‘with the Secretary in giving him a five-year
extension privilege; it used those very words "in. his
discretion."

The Secretary of the Interior in that same yeare

as we indicated at page 8 of our brief, issued a latter in
assistance of Congress it, attempting to establish what the.

44
legislative purpose and intent might ba for the amendment.
And Secretary Hitchcock in that letter four times mentioned
■chat he characterised the Carey Act as a grant to the States,
first mentioning "a grant made" to certair States; next,
"grant was

&.

departure"; thirdt "lands intended to ba granted* *

and fourth, "under this grant.5
In the 1921 Amendment to the Carey Act a restoration
privilege to the Secretary to return lands to the public
domain if construction not begun within three years, provided
the Secretary may in his discretion commit that Act.
QUESTION;

General Leroy, is it your view, that the

grant is so firm, that Congress could not change its mind?
MR. LEROY =

No, Mr. Justice, we would not suggest

that Congress cannot change its mind.

The features of the

conditional grant are that no title would pass until the
conditions are fulfilled.

Thus we would urge that no equitable

title attaches until the same.
QUESTION:

Throughout your argnent is a conditional

gra.:t, is there not?
MR. LEROY:

Yes, Your Honor,

The Solicitor did not have an opportunity to mention
but a good deal of authority is placed in the brief of Interior
on the Wyoming land decision reported in 1908,

We would

urge this Court that that land decision which found some
discretion in the Secretary's opportunity to contra cfc is not

a proper administrative construction.

It is not consistent

with the Secretary's own rules and regulations.
strictly contemporaneous.

It is not

It is based on a faulty reasoning,

that it is no authority, that it is not persuasive and it
never was embraced by Congress nor even called to Congress *
attention and that it remained obscure in the Department in
that it was not even ccntemplafced and grafted into the 1909
rules- ant regulations as the Secretary promulgated some six
months later.
QU3STI0N:

Well, what is the real argument here,

not between you and the District Court or between the Government
-and the Di.itri.ct' Court but between you and the Government,
because the Government concedes that the Secretary•s arguments
are subject to review and that the Carey Act has to be taken
into consideration.

You concede that the Carey Act isn't an

outright grant and that the Secretary could invade the
*

'

:-..v.\xi*ntsm amount granted if he could show sufficient justification
for it.
I don't see much different in your positions.
HR. LF'iOY:

Tee difference as 1 understand the

Government's position is that they say they have the absolute
dis. ration to contemplate receiving no applications at all.,
to receiving no petitions for reclassification at all, to not
giving us the time of day on the Carey Act.

And they also

urge that there is no entitlement of any kind whatsoever.

46

We to the contrary contend that the Carey Act
created neither an absolute grant nor an absolute discretion
but the intent of Congress was to challenge the States to
pick up a great and noble public purpose, that the Department
of Interior acknowledged in 1395 that it was in fact a
conditional grant, that by legislative action the States
accepted that grant and began to operate under the rules and
regulations of the Department which for 74 years characterised
both the Act as a grant, and suggested that the Department of
the Interior and the Secretary of the Interior had no
authority to do anything after that technical approval but
sign the contract as directed by law„
QUESTION:

Exactly what did the Government deprive

Idaho of as of nowj not 1895, as of right now?
MR. LEROY:

The Government has deprived us by the

stance that they have taken in the IE LA and by the Secretary
of the Interior of an opportunity to seel, any lands under the
Carey Act, as saying that they have in their absolute
discretion
QUESTION:

Do they deny you a right to file a piece

of paper?
MR. LEROY:

They did not deny vis an access to the

outer office but they deny us the access to any decision-making
process and they have not so granted any Carey Acts in Idaho
in

he last 3D years.

That doesn't mean they won't do it

QUESTION:

Well, in construing the statute
Isn't it possible that the Secretary of

te Interior could rule with you in this ease?
MR. LEROY:

It is net possible now.

It was final

when ths agency action closed the door a.ad rests its position
on an assertion of absolute discretion flowing from the 1894
Act.

But we suggest there is no such discretion there.
QUESTION:

And that prevents you from doing what?

MR. LEROY:

It prevents us as to these particular

lands from the possibility of moving them and to carry out
development, a frame of natural case or controversy.
QUESTION:

So you have been denied the right to

land, which you otherwise are entitled to.
MR. LEROY:

Yes, and the vehicle of that denial is

an assertion of absolute discretion and a refusal to follow
the dictate of the District Court in allowing us to petition
for reclassific ifcion.
QUESTION:

I am not interested in all the explanations

I c.m interested in what actually injured you; that you don't
have this particular land to use as you please.
MR. LEROY:

Yes, Your Honor

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
The case id submitted.

Thank you, gentlemen.,
