PROCE E D I N G S
MR„ CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 27 Original, State of Ohio v.
Commonwealth of Kentucky.
Mr. Ringo, you may proceed whenever vou are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. RINGO, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE DEFENDANT
MR. RINGO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This original action initiated by Ohio in 1966 is
before the Court today on Kentucky's exceptions to the report
of a special master.

The issue before the Court is the loca­

tion of the boundary between the two states along the northerly
edge

of the Ohio River.
Ohio's claim, adopted by the report, is that the

boundary is a fixed and static line located on the northerly
low water mark as it existed in the yea:.* 17 92.

Kentucky con­

tends that the boundary is the prevailing or current low water
mark as it may exist at any given time as affected by the
processes of accretion and erosion.
This Court in its 1973 opinion in this case raj acted
Ohio's attempt to amend its complaint to claim the middle of
the river as the boundary and in so doing this Court held that
the boundary between the two states was the northerly low
water mark.

This was based on two grounds:

One, Ohio's .'Long

acquiescence to Kentucky’s open assertions of sovereignty over
the river, and the other was the Court’s earlier decision in
Ilandly's Lessee v. Anthony that held that the boundary between
Indiana and Kentucky is the river itself, not the banks but
the river itself, wherever that may be at the lev; water merk on
the northwest edge.,
That decision was based on the cession made by
\

Virginia and agreed to bv the United States in 1784«

This

Court held that when Virginia ceded its lands northwest of the
River Ohio to the national government, she intended to retain
the entire river wherever it mav be as the boundary between
itself and unceded northwest territory.

The rivar was to be

a natural and ever*-changing boundary for the convenience of
the future population of the country and avoidance of contro­
versy

0

This holding in Handlv siraplv reflects the universal
commonlaw principle apolled by this Court to state boundaries,
that when a river serves as a boundary, the boundary follows
the gradual changes in the river caused by accretion and ero­
sion.
Besides this general rule of accretion, there are
two other general principles relating to streams as boundaries.
One is the principle of avulsion, which is when the boundary
suddenly and perceptablv changes its old channel and adopts a
new one, the boundary remains in the old channel.

The other

3

opinion — the other principle set forth bv this Court in
Missouri v. Kentucky is a well-recognized exception to the rule
of accretion and which was applied in Indiana v. Kentucky,

If

is the abandoned or island rule, which is when a river gradually
abandons its boundary channel and shifts around an island,
adopting a new channel, the boundary remains in the original
boundary channel.

The result of this gradual shift of the

channel of the river is tha same as an avulsion.
QUESTION:
did it not?

Nebraska v. Iowa carae after that case,

It was decided later.

MR. RINGO:

Two years later, I believe.

The result of this gradual shift of the channel of
tha river is the same as an avulsion; that is, the boundary
stays in the original channel, but it differs in that it occurs
over a long period of time, rather than sud'denlv, as in an
avulsion.
Ohio's position in this case is based upon a mis­
conception of Indiana v. Kentucky and this recognised exception
to the rule of accretion or the island rule.
QUESTION:

So you are suggesting that the regular

rule is that no one loses title, or a boundary doesn’t change
with respect to an island?

Whether there's an avulsion or

whether it's gradual?
MR. RINGO:

Right.

Well, the island rule has two

aspects; one, did it change the river, and what is the ownership

or dominion of the island.
QUESTION:

I understand.

But in any event, as far

as the boundary between two states are concerned, it always
remains the same, the island always remains in the same state.
MR. RINGO:

If the island belonged to the state when

it was admitted to the Union, then no sugseguent change of the
river -QUESTION:

Vlhefeher it's by avulsion, accretion, or

otherwise?
MR. RINGO:
QUESTION:

Can divest it of its sovereign territory.
General Ring©, is it Kentucky’s position

that the boundary is at the low water mark on the Ohio side
on any particular day?

Just from dav to dav that it might

change?
MR. RINGO:

I think that the best statement of the

position would ba that it is the prevailing low water mark,
wherever it may be.
QUESTION:

Well, would that change?

Might that

change from day to day?
MR. RINGO:
QUESTION:
MR. RINGO:

Well —
Or from year to year?
A day to day change probably wouldn't be

as perceptible as perhaps over a large number of years, the —■
QUESTION:

Well, perceptible or not, it might change

in 24 hours, might it not?

7
M'R. RINGO:

If there haopens to he a flood or

precipitation or something of that nature.
QUESTION:
MR. RINGO:
QUESTION:

So that is Kentucky’s position?
Right.
And you would concede, I take it, that

if there had been an avulsive change in the Ohio River such
that it wasn’t gradual but a sudden shift, that that would
change the boundary?
QUESTION:

No, that is when it doesn’t right?

Avulsive changes do not change boundaries -MR. RINGO:

That’s right.

QUESTION:

My colleague White is right about —

MR. RING:

A classic example of avulsion would be

the Ox Bow situation, where it cuts through the Ox Bov/.

The

boundary remains the abandoned river resulting from the cut
through the Ox Bov/.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. RING:

Ohio’s position is based upon the miscon­

ception of Indiana v. Kentucky which is an important case to
this dieussion and the island rule. In that case, it did not
involve a determination of the entire boundary between the
two states.

It involved a dispute over Green River Island, a

2,000-acre tract of land on the Indiana side of the Ohio
River.

In that case, the Court found that when Kentucky

became a state in 1792, the Ohio River ran in two channels

8

north and south of the island.

The northern or boundary

channel separated the island from the mainland of Indiana,
but the river gradually abandoned the northern channel and
by l8l6, when Indiana became a state, the island had become
attached to Indiana.
In applying the island rule, this Court held that
the island x^as within Kentucky when it became a state and
that subsequent abandonment of a boundary channel did not
divest Kentucky of its dominion over the island.

The

boundary remained along the northern river watermark of the
river’s abandoned channel.

Thus, Indiana v. Kentucky

fixed only a land boundary along along the abandoned
channel and did not involve a determination of the boundary
between two states along the remainder of the entire river.
Another misconception Ohio hs.s of the Indiana
v. Kentucky case is based on the language which set the
land boundary at Green River Island channel as the low
watermark on the Indiana side of the north channel as it
existed in 1792.

However, in the absence of any accretive

or erodive change in that channel after Kentucky became a
state, and none was suggested, the abandoned channel which
existed in 1792 continued to be the boundary.
On the other hand, the

Court's principle set

forth in Handle's Lessee v. Anthony continued to apply
along the remainder of the original channel.

The river

9
itself, wherever it may be, continues to be the boundary.
Ohio also misconstrues the Court’s language in
that case that Kentucky*3 jurisdiction and dominion con™
tinues as they existed ifhen she was admitted into the
Union, unaffected by the action of the forces of nature
upon the course of the river.

It is clear from the context

of —
QUESTION:

Counsel, you say in Handly’s Lessee
\

that the principle is that the river, however it may change,
continues to be the boundary.

Now, if it changes by

avulsion, as my colleague White said, the river would no
longer continue to be the boundary, would it?
MRo RINGO:

That’s true.

This was the point that

I was trying to reach at this very moment.

It Is clear,

when they speak of the action of the forces of nature upcn
the river, the course of the river, in the Indiana v.
Kentucky case it was clear from the context of the Court's
opinion that this action of the forces of nature upon the
course of the river referred to the abandonment of a
channel, which would be the island example of an avulsion,
and not to a gradual change in the channel which would be
accretion and erosion and the boundary would follow that
change.

Nothing in that opinion suggests that the low

water mark as it existed in 1792 Is of any significance in
those areas where the river, wherever it may be — and the

10

words "wherever it may be" is exactly the words used by
Chief Justice Marshall in Handly —- continued to flow in
its original channel.

Ohio cites absolutely no rule of

law which would support its view of Indiana v. Kentucky,
and we are aware of none»
The holdings in Handly and Indiana v. Kentucky
each were recognized by the legislatures of Indiana and
Kentucky in a 19^3 compact approved by Congress.

The compact

connected the terminal points of the I89S Green River Island
survey line of Indiana v. Kentucky to the low water mark
constituting the remainder of the boundary.

This acknowledged

that the boundary line is the river, wherever it may be at
the prevailing low water mark on the northerly edge as set
forth in Handly, and that the holding in Indiana v. Kentucky
was limited to the fixing of a land boundary along the fill
channel north of Green River Island.
In addition to all of this, Kentucky has openly
maintained for almost 200 years that its boundary extends
to the prevailing or current low water mark at its northerly
edge.

Such has been done through its legislative and

judicial assertions of sovereignty over the river.

This

has been expressly recognized not only by previous decisions
of this Court but by the courts of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois
and Kentucky.
To adopt Ohio's position would completely ignore

11
the assertion of Virginia to retain the river itself wher­
ever that may be as a natural and living boundary

and the

United States agreement to accept that assertion.

A 1792

line would be unrealistic.

It makes absolutely no sense to

make a natural river a boundary and expect it to remain a
fixed and beautiful line.

Thus, no matter from what view­

point this case is considered, the result indicated is the
same:

History, legal precedent and common understand all

support the continuation of the natural boundary of the
river's northerly edge at the prevailing low water mark.
In the more than thirteen years since this case has been
pending, Ohio has been unable to cite to this Court any
rule which would warrant adoption of the 1792 low water
mark as the boundary.

Therefore, we submit that the decree

should be entered providing that the boundary between the
state of Ohio and the Commonwealth of Kentucky is the pre­
vailing low water mark on the northerly edge of the Ohio
River as it existed at any given time.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr, Rlngo.

Mr. Szolosi.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP MICHAEL R. SZOLOSI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR. SZOLOSI:
the Court:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

12

There is only one issue before this Court today
and that is whether to adopt the Special Master’s report
wherein he concludes that the boundary between Ohio and
Kentucky is the northerly 1792 low water mark.

Ohio respect

fully submits that the decisions of this Court fully support
the recommendation of the Special Master and therefore it
should be adopted.

I hope to use my time this morning to

make just two points.
First, the decision in Indiana v. Kentucky is
indeed a fixed boundary decisioni and, secondly, there are
even policy considerations that are particularly appropri­
ate today which compel this same decision to be followed.
QUESTION:

Mr. Szolosi» are you going sometime

during your argument to address the language of Justice
Brewer in Ohio v. Nebraska on page l'<3 of 370 which I
am about to quote to you, that not only in respect''to the
rights of individual landowners but also in respect to fcbe
boundary lines between the states, the law of accretion
controls?
MR. SZOLOSI:
with that statement.

Your Honor, we most assuredly agree
And 1 can direct Your Honor’s atten­

tion for a moment to page 12 of Kentucky’s exceptions, I
submit that in Arkansas v. Tennessee, a case cited on page
12 by Kentucky, the general rule is set out, and as
characterised by this Court in 1918, it is settled beyond

13
the possibility of dispute that where running streams are
the boundaries between states, the same rule applies as be­
tween private proprietors9 namely that when the bed and
channel are changed by the natural and gradual processes
known as erosion and accretion, the boundary follows the
varying course of the stream.

And I submit, Your Honor,

that in Indiana v. Kentucky if indeed, as Kentucky has al­
ready conceded, it was a gradual process which caused the
channel north of Green River Island to dry up, then Indiana,
not Kentucky, would have been determined to rightfully
possess Green River Island and then later in the opinion,
because of another doctrine, the doctrine of prescription
and acquiescence, to have lost it.

But that isn’t what

happened in Indiana v. Kentucky.
QUESTION:

Then we are talking about basically a

factual situation and that is whether the course of the
Ohio River between Ohio and Kentucky changed, if it did
i

change by avulsion or accretion?
MR. SZOLOSI:
are not.

No, Your Honor, most decidedly we

What we are talking about is Indiana v. Kentucky

holding that there is a fixed boundary between those states,
a fixed boundary as of the date of Kentucky’s statehood,
1792.

Therefore the principles of accretion and avulsion

do not apply to the Ohio River, and a Special Master so
found.

QUESTION:

But how can you reconcile that with

Justice Brewer’s language much later or at least two yesi'3
later in Nebraska v. Iowa?

MR. SZOLOSI:

It is reconcilable, Your Honor, be-

cause this Court in 3.890 determined that there was a fixed
boundary along the river.

It determined it because there

are only two constructions that we can give to that case,
Either it was an avulsion case or it was a fixed boundary
case, and I submit It cannot b® an avulsion case because the
language in Arkansas v. Tennessee sets out a rule long
settled and no longer the possibility of dispute that a
gradual change in the river, in the channel and bed of the
river would be accreted.
QUESTION:

But you can have an avulsion at one

point in the river, say, between Ohio and Kentucky, and
nonetheless any changes in the river between Ohio and
Kentucky as opposed to Indiana and Kentucky could be
purely accreted and you could have two different results
under Nebraska v. Iowa, couldn’t you?
MR. SZOLOSI:

Your Honor, Nebraska v. Iowa was

dealing with the middle of the river boundary and unlike
the boundary here that is fixed by the cession, a deed and
apparently this court in Handly’s and in Indiana v. Kentucky
construed those matters to have fixed the boundary as of
1792.

The Special Master not only in this case but in

15
the original 8l, in a report which is now lodged with the
Court but has not as yet officially received, comes to that
same conclusion in both matters.
QUESTION:

That is what I thought your point was,

Mr. SzolosI, that while you concede the general applicability
of the common law rules of accretion and avulsion with
respect to a typical boundary, which is the middle of the
river, that this is an atypical boundary depending, as it
doe3, upon the origins of the state of Kentucky and the
origins of the Northwest Territory part of which became the
state of Ohio, and that with respect to this atypical
boundary it is the 1792 line that is the line, quite regard­
less of any subsequent avulsion or accretion.

Isn't that

your point?
MR. SZOLOSI:
QUESTION:

That is exactly, Your Honor.

And are you familiar with Texas v.

Louisiana?
MR. SZOLOSI:

Just in passing, Your Honor.

:

QUESTION:

Well, that was another atypical boundary

between two states, depending on the specific words of some
treaties that overrode any ordinary rule about the boundaries
between two states.

There it was just the middle of the

river, rather than the middle of the main channel and based
on the word that control where the boundary was originally
created, that was the rule, regardless of the general rule

16
about accretion and avulsion and things like that.

But your

point is that the words of the grant fixed the boundary,
MR. SZOLOSI:

That's right, Your Honor, and this

Court's decisions recognized that in 1890 in Indiana v.
Kentucky.
QUESTION:

Then why did you have to go into Green

Island and the abandonment of the channel and that sort of
thing if the line was fixed by, in effect, metes and bounds?
MR. SZOLOSI:

It was most relevant that the Court

inquire into exactly what the status of events was in 1792,
and the Court points out in that opinion that if we could
just look today we might come to a different result because
the water is now all south of the island, but we can’t do
that.

It is a fixed boundary.

We have to look to June 1,

1792, and in looking at that date, the date that Kentucky
became a state, we have to examine where was that river,
and at that time, after examining all cf the evidence,
they were able to conclude that indeed the waters of the
river Ohio did indeed run to the north of that island and
therefore, because it is a fixed boundary, the boundary
remains there irrespective of whether the boundary has
changed by avulsion, by accretion or anything else.
QUESTION:

So that, you say, was simply a dif­

ferent situation than Nebraska v. Iowa?
MR. SZOLOSI:

Yes9 Your Honor, it most certainly

17
was because of the cession and the interpretation which
this Court has placed on what that document did and what
boundary it set» whereas in Missouri v. Nebraska or
Nebraska v. Iowa the treaties that were involved set the
boundary in the middle of the river.

And obviously when

the boundary is in the middle of the river,, all of these
normal common law rules of erosion and accretion and
reliction and avulsion apply, but they don't apply here in
our casej and this Court so found in the 1890 decision,
Your Honor, I think —
QUESTION:
position?

What are the practical results of your

Does a fisherman have to have licenses from both

states because if the old line is now under water, hov? does
he know whether he is in Ohio or in Kentucky?
MR. SZOLOSI:

Your Honor, I think that really
I
i
;
brings me to the policy considerations that I indicated I
wanted to discuss anyway.
QUESTION:

Of course, that would be the rule if

the ordinary rule of boundary lines applied, namely the
deepest part of the channel.

MR. SZOLOSI:

It would have been, yes, that’s

right, as always, the navigable channel, within the river.
But in this case, Your Honor, the practical result is that
somewhere in that river there is a 1792 low water mark.
We've already

this Court has already noted that the

18
damming of the rivers particularly the large dams since
1955, have greatly widened the river and by widening it the
1792 low water mark is somewhere out in the river.
Clearly, Kentucky would have you believe that that
makes it more difficult for the fishermen or for the in­
dustry that must discharge water or other substances Into
the river from determining where they are 9 are they in Ohio
or are they In Kentucky»

I submit the contrary is true:

A

fixed boundary is much more convenient and therefore much
less subject to cause great amounts of litigation.
For instance — and let’s take the example of
industry, a power plant, for example.

Before the power plant

can be constructed, it must obtain a certificate and a per­
mit under the Clean Water Act from the state in which it
will discharge.

If the boundary is going to be a constantly

moving boundary and If we assume that my arm is the dis­
charge pipe a'nd that this is the moving boundary today and
the pipe is in Kentucky waters, tomorrow the boundary can be
here.

Does that mean they have to stop construction and go

back to the other state?
QUESTION:
the fisherman.

Let me go back to my illustration of

Do you have a little string of lights out

in the river so he knows whether he is in Kentucky or in
Ohio?
MR. SZOLOSI:

Absolutely not.

19
QUESTION:

Or has he got two licenses?

MR. SZOLOSI:

Your Honor, if there is a 1792 low

water mark that is fixed, whether it is by monuments or not,
at least he has some idea and it will become generally well
known, where you have about 80 to 100 feet on the river, if
you are within 80 feet of Ohio*s bank, you are safe, you
are not going to be arrested by Kentucky for fishing in
Kentucky waters.

And if you choose to only fish in Ohio

waters, you will only need an Ohio license.

On the other

hand, if you want to venture wherever your boat or the fish
take you, then you may need two licenses.

But that is much

more difficult to accomplish if the boundary is a constantly
moving boundary because —
QUESTION:

What really is this case all about?

What is the value for which each of you is contesting?
MR. SZOLOSI:

Your Honor, I really believe that

there are two principal reasons that this case is in court:
One, there is a revenue consideration, taxes can be levied
to the extent there is property that is within your juris­
diction, bridge revenues, license revenues for fishing,
boating, matters such as liquor license regulation and the
revenues from that regulation -—
QUESTION:

Do you have

saloons out in the

middle of the river or —
MR. SZOLOSI:

Your Honor, there are the river

20

boats that at times do attach themselves to the boundary,
but those matters are all part of the revenue producing
aspects of this case.
As this Court has frequently noted in all
boundary casess there is the notion of sovereign jurisdic­
tion here9 and each state obviously feels strongly about
having that matter finally determined by this Court,
QUESTION:

You just like to litigate,

MR. SZOLOSI:

No, Your Honors most assuredly Mr.

Ringo and I, as much as we enjoy being here today, would
have easily passed it up if the matter could have been re­
solved short of this.
QUESTION:

Do you have dependable evidence as to

where the boundary was in 1792?
MR. SZOLOSI:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, I submit that we do.

What is it generally?

MR. SZOLOSI:

In one proceeding already, a

Nuclear Regulatory Commission proceeding which is referred
to in Ohio’s brief, the Public Service Company of Indiana
has already proven where the 1792 low rater mark lies with
respect to a small area that they must — to which they will
discharge their waters from the plant.
QUESTION:

What is the full length of the river

between these two statess roughly?
MR. SZOLOSI:

I'm really not sure, Your Honor.

21
QUESTION:

But you are suggesting there is evi­

dence that would enable the definite establishment of a
boundary for the full length of the river between the two
states 200 yearn ago?
MR. SZOLOSI:

Yes, Your Honor.

The evidence is

at least as good as the evidence which this Court accepted
in Indiana v. Kentucky in 1896.
QUESTION:

You mentioned a moment ago that it was

the Indiana Public Service Company that had prouced the
evidence.

Was that as to the boundary between Indiana and

Kentucky or the boundary between Ohio and Kentucky?
MR. SZOLOSI:

Concededly, Your Honor, they were

working with surveys that related to a portion of the Indiana
boundary, but the same surveys can be depended upon, though
those surveys exist, the I806 surveys and the 1896 surveys —
QUESTION:

Well, you could have had an avulsion

or an accretion where the river runs between Ohio and
Kentucky and not one where it runs between Indiana and
Kentucky.
MR. SZOLOSI:

Your Honor, your question indicates

to me that I have obviously failed in my attempt to convince
you that there is a fixed boundary and therefore avulsions
don't matter.
QUESTION:

Or accretions.

MR. SZOLOSI:

Or accretions.

They are simply

22

irrelevant9 as in the Ohio River.
QUESTION:

You say then that it doesn’t make —

that the principle, the general principle doesn't apply on
the Ohio River because of the findings of the earlier
court in the Indiana v. Kentucky case?
QUESTION:

First, of all because of the language

of the -MR. SZOLOSI:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

— confirmed by two decisions of this

Court and embodied today in the Master’s report.
MR. SZOLOSI:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

Your Honor, there is a second policy reason that
for consistent I probably should go on and discuss it as
well, and that is that in addition to the fact that it is
much more convenient and therefore less likely to cause s
great amount of litigation to have a fixed boundary, there
is a more equitable concern that operates here today and
that is with respect to a river like the Ohio that has a
low water mark as a boundary and which has been dammed so
that the river is now much wider than it was previously,
the concepts of avulsion and accretion no longer work, tie
compensating theory that this Court talked about in Bonelli
or Corvallis is no longer at work along the Ohio River.
And so this reason also compels the Court to fellow the
decisions which it rendered in 1890.

23
For instances normally along any river that has
a middle of the river boundary, if there is accretion, the
Court has noted, what you can gain on the one hand you might
lose on the other.

And with respect to avulsions, there is

really no relevance because it fixes the boundary as of the
avulsion.
But what happens on the Ohio River?
win proposition.

It is a no-

Kentucky takes it all and Ohio loses it

all.
QUESTION:

But that is true with respect to the

Arizona-California boundary made by the Colorado River,
There have been four sets of dams in that river and yet it
is recognized that if there is an accretion, the state that
gets the land gets the boundary change, in effect.
MR. SZOLOSI:
the river case?

Your Honor, is that a middle of

It is, yes.

parent.

Therefore, the distinction is ap­

It is not a river like the Ohio where we are not

working from the middle where those equities can play,
where you can gain on the one hand or lose on the other.
We don’t gain anything along the Ohio River if you happen
to be a state to the north of the river, and those tradi­
tional principles which this Court looked at the underlying
reasons for those principles in trying to apply them in

Bonelli and Corvallis.

If you examine it, it is a windfall

to the State of Kentucky.
QUESTION:

But Nebraska v. iowa came along a long

time before either Bonelli or Corvallis and it simply stated
a general rule.
QUESTION:

Well, you concede that is the general

rule, don’t you?
MR. SZOLOSI:
QUESTION:

I do indeed, Your Honor.

But you assert that this is a special

situation.
MR. SZOLOSI:
QUESTION:

But for a different set of cases.

Texas v. Louisiana, the case I men­

tioned to you, came a long time after the Nebraska case and
yet it said that a general rule doesn't apply because of the
specifics of the creation of the boundary.

QUESTION:

Which would therefore support —

But you have to cross two bridges, I

One is that this isn't a middle of the river case,

it is a low water mark case, but then you have to cross the
other bridge that it is the low water mark at the time of
admission.
MR. SZOLOSI:

That’s correct, Your Honor, and

that is what the Court held.
QUESTION:
in this Court.

And that is where you rely on the cases

25
MR. SZOLOSI:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

It is an unchanging low water mark.

MR. SZOLOSI:

That’s right.

Your Honor, if I may,

there are additional reasons why this Court should read
Indiana v. Kentucky as having found a fixed boundary.

For

instance, again, if I Hay just direct the Court’s attention
to pages 21, 20 and 12 of the exceptions filed by Kentucky:
First, on page 21, Kentucky sets out the language that we
all concede is the most important language in that case as
far as determining this question»

If when Kentucky became

a state, a focus on statehood, not on some date prior to
an avulsion.

On the first of June 1792, clearly the date

that Kentucky officially became a state.

Kentucky concedes

that.
Later in that language, that her jurisdiction
extended at that time — and the Special Master recognized
it — that can only refer to the date of statehood.

Thus a

fixed boundary, not a boundary fixed by avulsion, a fixed
boundary, because of the deed and the cession, at that time
was the low water mark on the northwest side of the river,
and then some very important language in the Indiana v.
Kentucky case, where the court said these rights

I am

paraphrasing today -— these rights could not be affected by
any subsequent change of the Ohio River.
QUESTION:

What page are you reading that from

26

novi?
MR. SZOLOSI:

Prom page 21 of Kentucky's excep­

tions, from the passage that is quoted from Indiana v.
*

Kentucky, and it is about half-way doi?n in the passage,
the line begins "They could not be affected," and I submit
that means these rights that Kentucky had inherited from
Virginia — could not be affected by any subsequent change
of the Ohio River.

And the word "any" includes not only

avulsion changes but accretion changes, and it goes on to
say "or by the fact that the channel in which the river
once ran is now filled up from a variety of causes, natural
and artificial."
Now, I submit. Your Honor, that that language
clearly indicates to this Court that in 1890 the Court
felt that this was a fixed boundary, but you don't have to
rely on my interpretation,

Kentucky tells us as much on

two other pages in their exceptions.
On page 20, they try to finesse the issue when
they say that the — they admit first that the river gradu­
ally began to change its course so that the main channel
flowed to the south of the island.

So vie have a change 3.n

the channel which Kentucky is going to argue was an avulslve
change.

And that is what they do, they argue that the

change in the Ohio River ~ now I am reading on page 20,
about half-way down the page — the change in the Ohio R5„ver

27
around the Island had been an avulsive Change, a change in
the bed or main channel of the river itself, and that is
how they are going to define avulsion on page 20.

But if

we look at page 12 of their exceptions, we find out that
that is not an avulsive change.
The Court recognized the long settled rule that
when the bed -- and I am reading from Arkansas v, Tennessee,
the quote on page 12, about the fourth or the fifth or
eighth lines — that when the bed and channel are changed
by the natural and gradual processes known as erosion and
accretion, the boundary follows the varying course of the
stream.

Well, clearly if the Court in Indiana v. Kentucky

held or noted inits language that this boundary couldn’t be
changed by any process, and Kentucky’s argument is they were
talking about an avulsion, they couldn’t have been talking
about an avulsion because an avulsion doesn’t involve a
gradual change, and Kentucky admits it on page 12 of their
brief.

It involves a sudden change;.

In all of the avulsion

cases that this Court has decided, there is a date that you
can find in the opinions, a date that points out the yearin which the avulsion occurred.

In one case, in Missouri

v. Nebraska, 1904, they were able to point to the day, July

5, 1867.
If Indiana v. Kentucky were an avulsion case,

23
then this Court would have pointed to a day or at least a
year in which the avulsion occurred, but they didn’t do
that.

They pointed to the date

statehend became

official, and that has absolutely no relevance to an avul­
sion at all.
So I submit, Your Honor, that even on Kentucky’s
brief, this Court’s interpretation of Indiana — that the
interpretation applied to Indiana v. Kentucky in 1890 is
that they found a fixed boundary.

The only way It could

have been an avulsive finding in Indiana v« Kentucky is if
the definition of avulsion included a gradual change.

And

not only do they cite the case that shows to the contrary ,
but all of the other avulsion cases point out that it has
to be a sudden change and so do all of the treatise writers,
and that simply Is not the facts In Indiana v. Kentucky.
QUESTION:

And you are making that point to sup\

port your argument that the 1792 boundary is the applicable
boundary and that that decision in this Court cannot be ex­
plained in terms of avulsion but can be explained only In
terms of the 1792 boundary?
MR. SZOLOSI:
QUESTION:

Do I understand your argument correctly?

MR. SZOLOSI:
QUESTION:

That’s correct. Your Honor.

You do indeed. Your Honor.

Your friend at some point, asserted or

at least I thought he did that an island can never be subject

case.

Now, I don't recall that

he cited any

Do you have any comment on that?
MR. SZOLOSI:

Well, Your Honor, in a fixed

boundary situation, obviously wherever the island lies on
one side or the other of a fixed line, it can't be changed,
QUESTION:

It remains there, yes.

MR. SZOLOSI:

With respect to a middle of the

river boundary situation, which is the more general case,
the Nebraska v. Iowa case, the boundary I submit can and
may change;if there is an avulsion it won’t, but if there
is an accretion it can.
QUESTION:

Also Indiana v. Kentucky was decided,

the same day as Plessie v. Ferguson.
MR. SZOLOSI:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

Can I go back to the practical prob­
I guess you mentioned the power company

Are there surveys in existence for this entire -— it is a

rather long boundary between *—
MR. SZOLOSI:

Your Honor, although it is not

evidence in the record, we have the benefit of a rather
prodigious project by Dean Wallace, the former Dean of
the Indiana Law School where at the r< quest of the state
/

of Indiana he has been researching in Great Britain and in
all of the archives available in this country, all,.of the
old surveys and many surveys that can be referred to,
competent surveyors today so that they can do the same
thing that was done in Indiana v. Kentucky, take those
surveys and do the best job to come up with the 1792 low
water mark, and that is with respect to the river boundary
along the entire Ohio, the Ohio-Kentueky boundary as well.
QUESTION:

Well, would it be within the scope of

this litigation to fight out all the details of that for
the whole length of the river?
MR. SZOLOSI:

Unfortunately, Your Honor, it is.

In Indiana v. Kentucky, this Court in its decree remanded
the matter to the three commissioners to actually locate
the boundary, and the Special Master in this case recom­
mends to this Court that if you approve and adopt his
recommendations, one of those is to have the matter remanded
to him so that we can begin the task of actually locating
the 1792 low water mark.
QUESTION:

But it is not within the scope therefore

31
of any issues now before us?
MR. SZOLOSI:

No.

There is only one issue here

today, Your Honor, and that is whether to adopt the Special
Master’s report.
QUESTION:

I understand.

MR. SZOLOSI:

Your Honor, I would submit that —

I notice my time is almost up.

There are two points I want

to make before I stop talking, and one is that there is
only one issue and all of the suggestions by Kentucky with
respect to acquiesence is simply not an issue before the
Special Master and under the stipulation we are not pre­
sented ~~ they are factual matters, there is no record on
which to premise any findings.

The Special Master didn’t

make any findings and therefore all of the argument that
Kentucky devotes to that question is simply irrelevant tc
the proceedings before the Court today.
QUESTION:

Aren’t you simply saying that where

the granting state says it isn't the middle of the river,
all of the river belongs to us, and it is the low water
mark on the other side, that the accretion-avulsion rule
has nothing to do with it?
MR. SZOLOSI:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

I don’t see why that follows at all.

I can see why it xrould be a different point that you look
to for accretion and avulsion, but I can’t see why the

32
general rule of accretion-avulsion wouldn’t apply.

I don’t

see why that is any more of a fixed boundary point than the
fixed boundary point between Nebraska and Iowa.
MR. SZOLOSI:

Your Honor, let me correct my

answer in one respect, and that is that not only because it
is a low water mark but because that is what was apparently
.intended when they ceded the land northwest of the Ohio
River.
QUESTION:

Your point is that it is a 1792 low

mark.
MR. SZOLOSI:
QUESTION:

That's' right.

That’s right.

Not just low water mark generally.

MR. SZOLOSI:

But a particular low water mark.

And the low water mark — there was a question from the
Court while Mr. Ringo was arguing as te which low water
mark it is.

Under the definitions that this Court has

handed down, it is the lowest point to which the river
recedes during the year.
QUESTION:

And the special master took a look at

that and now for us it would go back to the original grant,
is that it?
MR. SZOLOSI:
QUESTION:

Pardon me, Your Honor?

It would go back to the original grant

to determina this issue?
MR. SZOLOSI:

Well, you don’t have to go back

33
that far to actually fix the boundary.
QUESTION:

The Louisiana case, we look to the

treaty.
MR. SZOLOSI:

This Court only need go back as far

as 1890 because the decisions of the Court are already
there.

They stand as stare decisus on the question —
QUESTION:

Yes, when it p;oes back to the Master,

if we agree with you and If we agree with the Special
Master's report, and if this goes back to him, then, as
the Chi«)f Justice says, the question will be where was the
1792 low water mark —
MR. SZOLOSI:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

— and that is your boundary.

MR. SZOLOSI:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Your Honor5, there is one other point that I wish
to make and that is that Kentucky has not always asserted
the argument that is before the Court today, and I suggest
that that should be considered when you try to determine
whether Indiana v. Kentucky stands for the proposition that
it is a fixed boundary or not.
QUESTION:

In the answer —

Ohio hasn't been entirely confined to

its position today either.
MR. SZOLOSI:

Mo, Your Honor, and unfortunately

we are back to our original position.

But my point is with

respect to Indiana's position today, it is inconsistent --

3L\

QUESTION:

Kentucky’s.

MR. SZOLOSI:

Kentucky's, I’m sorry — is incon­

sistent with the answer which they gave in this case
initially, and their answer admitted that It was a 1792 low
water mark but argued that for practical reasons you can’t
find it so we ought to have a prevailing low water mark.
And then if we look at their exceptions, they talk about
avulsion, 36 times they mention avulsion, and when we see
their reply brief the word doesn’t appear once, and I submit
that is instructive, that they felt avulsion, to argue
avulsion was a weak position and they retreated from it.
And that inconsistency should be considered when this Court
tries to determine whether to read Indiana v, Kentucky —

MR. SZOLOSI:

Thank you, Your Honor,

MR. GRIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Ringo?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. RINGO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF—REBUTTAL
MR. RINGO:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I do;

The first thing I would like to address is this
misunderstanding as to the distinction between the use of
the word avulsion and in our reply brief the absence of
the word avulsion5 and this goes back to the distinction

35
between the general principle of an avulsion, which is a
certainly perceptible change that the boundary remains in
an abandoned channel.
The island rule recognises the exception to the
rule of accretion.

It has the same result as an avulsion,

but it happens very gradually and It Is the very same thing
that happened in the Missouri v. Kentucky case Involving
a dispute over Wolf Island which was an island of some
15,000 acres.

When Kentucky was admitted to the union,

first of all, the boundary between Kentucky and Missouri
was the middle of the main channel of the Mississippi
River.

When Kentucky was admitted to the union, the main

channel ran west of the island and therefore the island
was within Kentucky’s jurisdiction.
,

But by the time of

i

the dispute, the main channel of the Mississippi had
changed and shifted and ran east of the island and there­
fore putting at that time Wolf Island cn the other side of
the main channel, but the Court held that the subsequent
i

' '

change of the channel did not divest Kentucky of its
sovereign territory of Wolf Island, and this is the same
principle that was applied In Indiana v. Kentucky.
QUESTION:

Yes, but in that earlier case it didn’t

involve the Ohio River, did it?
MR. RINGO:

;

Well, the reason we discuss —
i

QUESTION:

And it didn't involve a boundary that

36
eoncededly now is from the low water mark, the north low
water mark?
MR. RINGO:

But that is the reason I discussed

Missouri v. Kentucky, because that principle which we are
calling the island principle, rather than avulsion because
in looking through all the cases of avulsion it always
involves a sudden and perceptible change, but this was a
result that was the same, so since it wasn’t sudden and
preceptible it differs from avulsion.

But the reason that

we mention Missouri v. Kentucky, that is precisely the
principle that the Court relied upon in Indiana v. Kentucky.
It states the principle and then cites that principle,
whether it Is in the middle of the river or the low water
mark that is in the Kentucky case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ringo, what is your response to

this language in the Indiana v. Kentucky case where the
court says that if when Kentucky became a state on the first
of June 1792, the waters of the Ohio River ran between that
tract known as Green River Island and the main body of the
state of Indiana, and her right to it falls from the fact
that her jurisdiction extended at that time to the low water
mark on the norhwest side of the river.

Now, that says the

boundary between the state is (the low water mark.

Then it

f

says she succeeded to the ancient right and possession of
Virginia and they could not be affected by any subsequent

37
change of the Ohio River or by the fact that the channel in
which the river once ran is now filled up
of causes, natural or artificial.

from a variety

Now, doesn’t that just

say in plain words that it is the north, it is the low
water mark on the north side and that the north low water
mark — the boundary doesn't change by changes in the river?
MR. RINGO:
the case.

First you must look at the context of

It was a dispute over Green River Island, that

2,000-acre tract of land.

The jurisdiction that were talk­

ing about was jurisdiction remaining over that island.

It

was not discussing the entire river or the entire state,
QUESTION:

Well, the Court goes on and says her

dominion and jurisdiction continue as they existed at the
time she was admitted to the union, unaffected by the action
of the forces of nature upon the course of the river.
MR. RINGO:

Okay.

Nox*, this is the point I tried

to make earlier, that it is clear from the context of that
portion of the Court's opinion, that this referred to the
island rule exception, that they were discussing an abandon­
ment of this northern channel, did not strip or divest
Kentucky of this island.
Another important point Is that the opinion in
Indiana v. Kentucky did not refer to changes in the remainder
of the course, It was consistent with the policies of
Handly's Lessee v. Anthony.

33
Going back to an earlier question of the Court,
we look to the cession which determined the boundary and
how the river was to be perceived as a boundary.

The

cession fixed the river as a natural, ever-changing boundary
subject to accretion, and it mentioned in the opinion that
the states had the right to it and if there was an accretion
to the Indiana side then the accretion would belong to
Indiana.
To accept Ohio's position, you fix the 1792 line
and locate it wherever it happens to be located, we can
assume that this is a natural river and accretions have
occurred.

Any accretion that has occurred

north

of the 1792 low water mark now would not belong to Indiana,
Ohio, or Illinois, but would belong to Kentucky, and you
would have situations where you would have the River in
Kentucky and Ohio or Indiana and it would cause additional
problems and this is exactly the reason that Virginia re­
tained the river itself as a natural river, because no
matter what the decision of this Court is or the arguments
of counsel, the river will continue to go through its
natural processes of adjustment which will be through
accretion and erosion, and to do anything to the contrary
would defeat or defy the terms of Virginia's cession of
the national government and the government's exception of
that cession.
