MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Bloomer against Liberty Mutual»
Mr. Rassner, I think you may proceed whenever
you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN C0 RASSNER, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, RASSNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may.it

please the Court:
The question presented by this appeal arises out
of a longshoreman's accident on board a ship.

The long­

shoreman collected compensation benefits and medical
benefits, pursuant to the Longshoremens/Harbor Workers
Compensation Act, and at the same time proceeded to bring
a third-party action against the ship owner.
The action against the ship owner v/as eventually
compromised for the sum of $60,000.
During that interim period, Mr. Bloomer had
recovered compensation payments and medical benefits of
some $17,000.
The question therefore is presented whether
the recovery in the third-party action, the compensation
insurance carrier, the respondent herein, should share
proportionately with Mr. Bloomer the costs of affecting the
recovery.

4
Now, 1 don’t think from the point of view of
equity and just common justice, there can be no question
but that there should be equitable apportionment.

For

example, the recovery in the third-party of, let’s say,
$10,000, and the lien is $3,000; therefore, $7,000, or
70 percent of the recovery, inures to the benefit of the
longshoreman, and $3,000, or 30 percent of the recovery,
inures to the benefit of the compensation insurance
carrier.
And there is no—
QUESTION:

Of course, that argument is—that

argument rejects the notion that the stevedore, the
employer was intended to be, by Congress, to be completely
free of any kind of liability in connection with thirdparty actions.
MR. RASSNER;

I don't think so, Your Honor, if

I may—
QUESTION:

Well, I know you don't think so.

But there’s an argument that compensation benefits were
increased substantially in exchange for immunizing the
employer from any kind of liability.
MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, but—

In connection with third-party actions,

MR0 RASSNER:

Yes, Your Honor, but this doesn't

really expose the employer, the stevedore, to a new liability.

What is happening here is the stevedore, or the employer,,
is receiving back payments that it initially made out»

Under

our American system, if anyone-—well, let’s say if X lend
my friend a thousand dollars, for example, and he must hire
a lawyer to collect that thousand dollars back from me
because of my failure to pay, my friend must still pay
lawyers5 fees to collect his own thousand dollars.
The stevedore here is recovering money, and there
is no reason from an equitable point of veiw why he should
not pay reasonable attorneys' fees for making that recovery.
QUESTION:

By the way, is there something in the

statute that says that the employer is entitled to get
back his—
MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

--statutory—his payment?

MR. RASSNER:
QUESTION:

No.

No, Your Honor.

Isn't that—I think that's very strange

that the—after gping through this whole process again in
'72, they left the lien to just judicial decision.
MR0 RASSNER:
QUESTION:

Isn't that the source of the lien?

MRs RASSNER:
of the lien.

Well—

Judicial decisions are the source

And the judicial decisions were based on

equitable principles.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you this hypothetical

6

question:

How much net would this man get now?

60 gross, 17 from the Liberty
MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:
is that right"*

He got

Mutual, isn't that right?

That's correcto

And 23 net after the lawsuit was over,

17 and 23?

MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

Well, no, Your Honor—

He started with—-

MRo RASSNER:

Oh, I see what you mean, Your Honor.

In other words, the compensation plus what he netted"*
QUESTION:

Yes.

MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

He got 17 in installments while he

was litigating and getting well in the hospital.
MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

That's correct, sir.

And then he got 23 net after he

finished his lawsuit.
MR» RASSNER:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
/

Suppose there'd been no statute at

all, and he was just suing on common law negligence.

And

he sued—which is what he was doing here---he sued, and got
$60,000.
MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

He would still recover

$40,000.

That would—he's exactly in the same

position as he would have been without any—
MRo RASSNER:

Yes, that is correct.

However,

7
here the $17,000 doesn't go into his pocket—-well, all
right, I see what you're driving at.

You're saying that

in effect there is some degree of double recovery,
perhaps—QUESTION:

Well, he got the 17 one way or another,

didn't he?
MR, RASSNER:

I follow; I follow.

is some degree of overlapping.

True, there

He does not recover the

full 17 again, but only one-third of it, in effect, if
petitioner's position is sustained by this Court.
However—■
QUESTION:

That's one way of putting it.

But he

winds up in each of the situations I've described with
precisely $40,000 in his pocket, does he not?
MR0 RASSNER:
in his pocket, yet.

He winds up precisely with $40,000

However, there is a compensation

statute, and we must deal with the situation as it does
exist.
QUESTION:

But as Justice White just pointed out,

there's nothing in the compensation statute that tells us
that this cost should be—
MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

—taken off.

MRo RASSNER:

That is correct.

There is absolutely

nothing in the compensation thstatute that does so.

8

QUESTION:

But most compensation statutes are

enacted as substitutes for an ordinary negligence action,
are they not?
MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

You say as substitutes, Your Honor?

Yes.

MRo RASSNER:

Well, I'm not exactly sure that

the compensation statute was meant as a substitute for it.
What it does, in effect, is—
QUESTION:

I mean, against the man’s own employer.
*•«

Isn’t the origin of workmen’s compensation the idea that
the man would get a fixed, quick, well-established and
easily recoverable recovery against his employer rather than
having to sue for negligence?
MR0 RASSNER:

That is correct.

He is barred from

suing for negligence against his employer.
QUESTION:

.And he gets these medical benefits,

and installments, monthly or weekly installments, right
away, doesn't he?
MR» RASSNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, he does, Your Honor.

So that he doesn’t have to go out and

borrow money or-—
MRo RASSNER:

That is correct.

It's a remedial

legislation; there's no question about it; for the benefit
of the longshoreman.
If, as Your Honor pointed out—I want to deal

9

with this problem that Mr. Chief Justice, you raised a
moment ago, about the double recovery.
There is admittedly a certain amount of overlapping.
In other words, if petitioner's position is sustained by
this Court, the longshoreman will recovery something more
than he otherwise would recovery if he just sued directly.
However, as in so

many questions, including—

that appear before this Court—-this is a question of
balancing the equities.

Should the longshoreman be

allowed some amount of double recovery, as opposed to
permitting the employer-stevedore to recover back his lien
with no effort, no expense and money, nothing whatsoever;
he just sits back and lies on the back of the longshoreman
who brings the action.
QUESTION:

Yes, but he's paid out the money.

MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

Excuse me, sir?

He’s paid out the money.

MRo RASSNER:

Yes, he has.

But as I pointed out

a moment ago, anybody who has paid out money, once he1s
paid out this moneyf it’s gone.

The stevedore has paid it

out.
QUESTION:

Well, that helps solve your case by

saying that.
MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

Well, somebody has to sue—

It isn't gone at all if there's going

10

to be a third-party recovery,
MRo RASSNER:
recovery, yes.

If there' s going to be a third-party

But the point I'm trying to make, Your

Honor, is, once the money is paid out, unless somebody
sues to get it back, it certainly is gone.
sue.

Somebody has to

Somebody has to pay the lawyer for collecting that

money back for the stevedore.
There is no equitable reason for it to be the
longshoreman.
QUESTION:

But if the longshoreman doesn't sue,

but the employer does, then the statute does determine—-then
it does have provision for it,
MR» RASSNER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And the employer is going to recover

out of the—what he recovers from the third party, he's
going to recover his attorney's fee.
MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, he will,

So recovery's going to be cost-free

to him.
MR, RASSNER:

Yes, it will.

And that—under

933(e), the statute your Honor just referred to, the—when
the stevedore sues, the

stevedore gets his full lien back.

He, in addition, gets an amount to cover any future compen­
sation payments.
QUESTION:

.And his attorney' s fee „

11

MR„ RASSNER:
QUESTION:

And?

MR, RASSNER:
QUESTION:

And he gets the attorney's fee,

And one-fifth of the balance,

So he cones out—he cones out not only

cost-free but a little ahead of the game.
MR, RASSNER:

That's correct.

is a reason for this, Your Honor.

And I think there

The stevedore is given a

reward for bringing the action; he's given an incentive to
sue.

And in that—
QUESTION:

Which he otherwise might not have?

MR, RASSNER:
QUESTION:

Excuse me, Your Honor?

Which he otherwise might not have7

MR. RASSNER:

Which he otherwise would not have,

because there are very few instances in the law that I
know about where someone who sues gets his attorney's fees
in addition to the proceeds of the lav/suit.
There are some, but not many.
Now—QUESTION:

Well, I know, but even if he didn't get

his attorney's fee back, he might want to sue, because he's
paid out a lot of money.
MR0 RASSNER:
QUESTION:

And he sues to get it back.

MR. RASSNER:
QUESTION:

If he did—

If he did—

It's cheaper to get back 10 than

12
nothing at all.

Of course, it's batter to get back 17.

And even more if yon get back 17 plus your attorney8 s fees
plus a little extra.
MRo RASSNER:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

But

if he did—I'm sorry.
QUESTION:

If the stevedore sues, he's suing his

customer„
MR. RASSNER:

Yes, and they don’t often do that,

as a practical matter.
But to deal with Your Honor’s question, the-—as I
mentioned a moment ago—-excuse me--the stevedore is, in
effect, being given a reward for bringing the lawsuit,
something he would not ordinarily get.

Now, when the

longshoreman'sues, if the lien is repaid in full, aside from
that little one-fifth excess, the stevedore is reaping the
same reward; when ha sues—when the stevedore sues, he must
take some initiative.

He must get himself a lawyer, and

risk the loss of lawyer's fees.

He must suffer the

discomfiture of being an active litigant, appear in
discovery proceedings, worry about witnesses for trial.
He is exposing himself to a risk ofa judgment
against himself for costs.

For all of these things, for

taking these initiatives, Congress has rewarded him, given
him an incentive to bring the action for the benefit of the
longshoreman, hoping there’ll be something

left over for

13
him at the end.
However, when the longshoreman sues, the Second
Circuit's opinion in this case puts the stevedore right
back in the same beneficial situation that he would be
when he sues, pursuant to 933(e).

And that, I say, is

totally inequitable; the statute did not intend that.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't there an element of

expressio unius in there.
MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

Isn't there an element of expressio unius

in there.
MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

I don’t, understand

.what you mean.

Well, the statute has made very specific

provision for what shall happen when a stevedore sues, and
all of the consequences which you have described; and it has
made none for the

apportionment of attorney's fees when the

longshoreman sues.
MRo RASSNER:

That is a—Your Honor is correct,

there's a void in the statute.

Congress has always left the

distribution of the recovery, when the longshoreman sues, to
the, courts.

And the courts have always ruled on it when­

ever necessary.
Equitably, before the 1972 amendment, there were
cases such as Russo and Ballwanz, which are cited in the
brief, which did not allow equitable apportionment of the

14
attorney’s fees between the stevedore and the longshoreman
on the theory that when you had the third-party case
allowed under the Ryan decision,, the stevedore was ultimately
paying the longshoreman judgment.
So it would be inequitable for the stevedore, in
effect, to have to pay twice.

He’s paying the judgment,

and in addition to that, he’s paying fees on what he recoups
to the attorney who sues him.
This could not be tolerated.

And so it was

disallowed.
However, when -the '72 amendments came in, and the
stevedore is now insulated from the third-party suit, he
cannot be sued, now the courts, Fourth Circuit, the Ninth
Circuit, the Fifth Circuit to some degree, have overruled
those prior decisions; and .now, because the equity favors the
longshoreman, have allowed the recovery of the lien.
The' court—
QUESTION:

Well, Congress certainly didn’t

expressly, or even impliedly—well, I'll say expressly—did
not attempt to overturn or to reject the no-allocation
approach that the cases on the boohs indicated.
MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION;

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

Well, there were cases, as you say,

in 1972 there were cases on the books that said, no
allocation of the attorney's fees.

15

MRa PASSNER;
QUESTION:
that approach.

Yes.

And Congress made no effort to reject

Even though it did overturn Ryan.

MRo RASSNER:

Yes.

I would respectfully submit

that Congress never gave it a thought.

There is nothing

in the legislation, -there is nothing in the legislative
history, there is nothing anywhere that I know of, at least,
to indicate that Congress even visualized this problem
arising.
It was only after the '72 amendments were in
effect, and the courts were faced with the problem of
distributing longshoremen’s recoveries, that the inequity
became apparent.
Even a legislative body as sophisticated as the
Congress of the United States can't visualize everything
that might arise in the future.

And they didn't in this

case, either purposefully, or unintentionally, I don’t know
which.

But the fact remains, they did not legislate on it.
And there is absolutely no Congressional intent

expressed or implied that the lien should not be equitably
apportioned.
Failure to equitably apportion the lien can
result in very serious inequities.

Going back to my

$10,000 example, which is easy for me from the sake of
mathematics, the recovery being $10,000; assuming the lien

16

works its x^ay up to $6,000, and the lax-?yers' fees are
one-third, or 30 percent or 40 percent, it gets down to the
point where the longshoreman recovers nothing on his
third-party action.
QUESTION^

Well, but the figures—the hypothetical

figures I gave you, he’s much much better off than that.
He’s got $40,000, hasn't he?
MRo RA3SNER:
QUESTION;

I—I’m—

He’s got $40,000 on the hypothetical

that I gave you.
MR» RASSNER:
QUESTION;

Yes, he got $40,000 and--

With or without this act.,

MR0 RASSNER:

Right.

If equitable apportionment

is allowed—all right, let me take another tack if I may,
your Honor.
Under 933(e), if a stevedore sues, he is given a
reward for bringing the lav/suit.
be any doubt about it.

I don't think there can

Congress gave it to him purposely as

an incentive.
If the longshoreman sues, the stevedore is in the
same position.

If there .is some small overlapping of

longshoremen's benefits, as a result of equitable
apportionment, let it be the longshoreman5 s reward.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rassner, what if the longshoreman

has a medical policy of his own, so that a good deal of

17
hospital costs and that sort of thing are—come from a
collateral source?

Now, isn't--may there not be an occasion

where the longshoreman is motivated to sue not by his own
desire to recover, but by his own insurer’s desire to
recover as subrogee7
MR. RASSNERs

Most of the time, Your Honor,

a private insurance policy is not subrogated to the rights
of the injured person, because the injured person is paying
a premium for the policy.
QUESTION:

That depends on whether a state follows

a collateral source doctrine.
MR. RA8SNER:

That’s correct; that’s correct.

I don’t know—-it's hard for me to guess as to
whether an insurance company could pressure a longshoreman,
to sue because of the insurance company wants to recover
back its funds.

I would say that the longshoreman should

have this initiative himself, and the desire to recover
compensation for his pain and suffering, and for general
damages which he doesn’t get under workmen's compensation
laws.
As—there is a distinction I could make if the
longshoreman had to go out, let's say, and borrow money,
and owed a debt to the debtor-—owed a debt to the creditor
who lent him the money, and somehow the creditor reduced the
debt to judgment, and got a lien on the longshoreman's

18

third-party case, then I would say there should be no
equitable apportionment because the longshoreman still,
no matter what happens in the third-party case, he would
still owe the money to the creditor.
In the case before the Court, the longshoreman
does not owe the money to his employer; the employer cannot
sue to recover back the compensation benefits, not through
the longshoreman.

The only one who might possibly owe these

compensation benefits is the shipowner.

And someone, in

order to collect this, has to sue the shipowner.
And what I'm saying to this Court is that it would
be inequitable to cause the longshoreman to have to pay the
attorney's fees, collect the money from the shipowner,
which inures to the benefit of the stevedore.
QUESTION;

Well, he may have to—may have to make

some kind of a judgment about whether to sue at all like
most people dp, whether it's worthwhile to sue.
be he'll just decide to leave

And it may

employer.
MR0 RASSNER:
QUESTION;

I'm sorry, Ididn’t—

He may just decide to leave it to his

employer.
MR0 RASSNER:
QUESTION:

Well, he may.

It’s going to be subject to—

If he does—

QUESTION;

Is it $10,000?

I'll owe my attorney so much, and I'll owe the—I'll

have to pay ray benefits back.
MRo RASSNER;

It isn't worth the effort.

If he does leave

employer, and the employer sues, fine.

it to the
Then the employer

takes the risk—
QUESTION;

The employer may never sue.

MRo RASSNER:

The employer may never sue.

That's

not the case before the Court, if I may, respectfully.

If

the employer does sue and takes the risk and recovers, he’s
entitled to the benefits of 933(e).
QUESTION;

But if he goes to a lawyer and the

lawyer says, "Gee, I don't think you could ever recover more
than $5,000, and grankly, mister, my fee would never warrant
the time it would take."
MRo RASSNER:

So he may never get to sue anyway.
That's correct, sir.

But as I say, if the employer does sue, and does
collect, then he’s entitled to those 933(e) benefits.

But

he's not entitled to those 933(e) benefits when the long­
shoreman is the one who does the suina.
QUESTION;
I suppose.

Of course, that's just the issue,

If he—MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION;

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

I guess that's really the issue?

MRo RASSNER:

Yes, it is the issue.

That is the

20

nub of the issue*
QUESTION:

Even in your example, where we just

went through it with Mr. Justice White, of a $10,000
recovery and a $6,000 paid in advance, and maybe $4,000 go
for expenses and litigation.
What it all boils down to, I suppose, is, there’s
really no incentive to bring a lawsuit in that case.
MR. RASSNER:
QUESTION:

There would—

Maybe that's a pretty good idea? we just

don’t have incentives for lawsuits that aren't very valuable.
MR. RASSNER:

There would not be an incentive-”

there would be less of an incentive to bring a lax^suit,
certainly.

Because'—•
QUESTION:

Under the Second Circuit rule.

MRo RASSNER:

Under the Second Circuit rule, yes.

And one of the things that Congress did intend, I believe,
is to preserve to the longshoremen their right to bring
these third-party cases.
That was specifically provided for, and that
shotjld not be discouraged.
QUESTION:

Well, the right is there, but you

don't particularly want to encourage lawsuits that are not
going to benefit the economy as a whole.

I mean, just--the

only beneficiary of your hypothetical case, really, is the
lawyer.

21
MR. RASSNER:
QUESTION:

Well—

He's going to get the $4,000.

MR, RASSNER:

Not really, Your Honor.

The long­

shoreman benefits as well, because the longshoreman is
entitled to retain two-thirds of the net recovery after the
lien is paid.
Otherwise, he would wind up with nothing.
QUESTION:

Well, in our hypothetical, there won't

be anything after the lawyer is paid and the $6,000 is
reimbursed to the stevedore, or the stevedore's insurance
carrier.
MR. RASSNER:

If the—under the Second Circuit's

opinion, the longshoreman would get nothing under that
hypothetical, that's correct.

But under the—let's say the

Fourth Circuit's opinion in Swift v. Bo1ten, or the Ninth
Circuit's opinion in Battell,
recover.

the longshoreman would

The longshoreman would get two-thirds of $4,000.
QUESTION:

But it's still true in your hypothetical

that using the example the Chief Justice put to you, the
longshoreman would come out about the same as if there9d
never been any compensation statute; the $10,000, he'd get
a net of about $6,000 out of the recovery.
MRo RASSNER:

Yes.

He would come out about the

same as if there had never been any compensation.
However, I should point out also that compensation

22

comprised not only a payment that goes directly to the
longshoreman, but also comprises medical and hospital
payments which the longshoreman never sees, which goes to
effect his recovery.
They are charged to him; they are charged to him,

the respondent.
QUESTION:

And I suppose the.-I suppose the result

of this case may affect the employer's insurance rate.
MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

I don't know.

It may.

Well, I would suppose the employer's

insurance company is getting back full recovery by one
rule, and wouldn't be getting back rfull recovery in another.
MR. HAS SNER:
QUESTION:

True.

In which event, his doing business

costs him more.
MR0 RASSNER:
Your Honor.

It might very well cost him more,

23
QUESTION;

And what about a state system?

MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION;

Excuse me?

Aren’t there some state systems?

Are

there some state funds, or is it all private insurance
coverage?
MR0 RASSNER;

So far as I know, itEs private.

Stevedores are private enterprises in business to make
money.
QUESTION;

Well, I know but—

MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

And they have their own insurance.

They never operate through any

state insurance firms?
MR0 RASSNER:

Well, they do; I believe they do

sometimes finance their insurance through—in New York
through the State Insurance Fund.
QUESTION:

All right.

And so the State Insurance

Fund is, or is not, going to get full recovery; under your
rule, they won’t«,
MRo RASSNER:

Under my rule, they will have to

pay a reasonable fee for making their recovery.
QUESTION:

So your rule would tend to deplete the

state funds.
MRo HASSNER:
QUESTION:

Well—

Well, it would not only tend, it would.

MRo RASSNER:

All right.

Well, in your $10,000 case, you’re

talking about two-thirds of the attorney's fee.
MRo RASSNER:

Well, I'm talking about--we11, yes.

If the lien is that high, yes, it does amount to that.
That's correct.

But I say a comparatively limited amount

because the 1972 amendments have done away with a great
number of longshoremen's cases.

And in view of the

amendments, the stevedore and the longshoreman are in effect
on the same side of the

fence.

They both want that ship­

owner to pay.
Because if the shipowner pays, then the stevedore
stands to recoup part of its liens, and it can never be
exposed to any third-party liability.

QUESTION:

.

But can’t you extend that statement

you just made still further?

If the 1972 amendments just,

as a general matter, tended to cut down on the number of
lawsuits that there ware in this area.

And in that sense,

the very notion of a third-party action is—runs contrary
to the notion of a compensation system.
We have them both in the statute, but they point
in two alternative legal theories.

your Honor's question; I apologize»

Well,it's perfectly possible that you

could have a system of workmen's compensation which

Congress can pass such laws as

a third party.
QUESTION:

But is there any reason, as suggested

by my brother Stevens, to encourage in any v/ay additional
litigation in this area?

26

MRo RASSNERs

I don’t think it's a question of

encouraging litigation, if I may say so respectfully.

If a

person is injured by virtue of negligence of some
individual or company, he always has had the right under
common law to sue thatindividual to recover full compensatory
damages.
The compensation law wasn’t meant to limit an
injured man’s rights.

It was meant to give him something

in addition.
QUESTION:

Well—

MR. RASSNER:
QUESTION:

It was meant—

Under common law, he has the right to

sue his own employer for negligence.
MRo RASSNER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And the compensation law removed

that.
MR. RASSNER:

Yes, that is correct.

A judgment

was made by the legislatures—I would assume of every state—
that it is better for the individual to get some recovery
quickly, and to insulate the employer from being sued, than
it was to have the employer be sued by the individual„
QUESTION:

Better for both, and probably better

for society as a whole.
MR. RASSNER:

That is better for society as a

Because why should that third party , who

gives nothing, be allowed to injure someone and get off,
totally scot free?
The statute just doesn ' t--it allows that common
law right.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS A0 BOECKMANN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BOECKMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice—

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MRo BOECKMANN:

Mr. Wagner.

Boeckmann, Your Honor.

MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Oh, excuse me,

Mr. Boeckmann.
MRo BOECKMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We contend that the stevedore should be allowed to
recoup its entire lien.

And the statute, the legislative

history, and the construction by this Court since the
1972 amendments were passed all point in that direction.
The statute that has been mentioned in various
questions brought up by the Court is a remedial one, and it

28

is the result of political forces in the Congress.
The employers resisted for qxiite some time an
increase in benefits under the statute, and the benefits
were quite low up until 1972 because they were being hit
both ways up until that time by virtue of the Seas Shipping
and the Ryan decision.

So that the employer usually Wound

up as a third party paying both compensation and being hit
with a judgment or settlement for liability, after having
been in pleaded by the shipowner.
As a result of negotiation in the legislative
process, the Jpngshoring companies, the stevedoring companies,
agreed to an increase in benefits, but as price for that
increase, they were to be insulated from being impleaded
in these third-party actions.
And—but because of the power of the longshoremen5s
union, Congress saw fit as part of the compromise package
to allow the stevedores, the longshoreman-employees, to
bring third-party actions.
But when you look at the legislative history, and
you look at the provisions of the statute itself, it is
quite clear that it is intended to be a compensation
statute, and the third party recovery aspect of it is
given a lesser degree of attention.
The—-for one thing, as I mentioned, the benefits
are quite high.

They are 200 percent of the average

29

national weekly wage, and they are computed annually in
order to adjust for inflation.
Whenever an attorney is involved in the compensation
portion of securing payment, the Deputy Commissioner of
Labor is emplowered to oversee any fees that are awarded to
the attorney.

And it is usually only in the case of a

contest over the amount of compensation, and that the
employer turns out to be wrong in resisting, that an
attorney is awarded a fee; and only on the excess that he
brings to his client as a result of that contest.
And in all cases, the Deputy Commissioner is
empowered to look at the fees awarded to attorneys.
All of this seems, to my mind, manifestly intended
to preserve the employer's assets for the payment of
compensation.
And, as has been pointed out, the statute

itself

lays out a very specific formula for if the employer wishes
to recoup his compensation lien, encouraging him to do so,
awarding him not only the fee, but his expenses, his
attorneys' fees, and a portion of any excess over this
amount.
The—I would also like to address myself to the
equity of this particular situation.

It is argued that

equity would not—does not permit the recovery of a fund
without rewarding the

person who is responsible for

30

securing that fund *
But it seems to me applying it to this kind of
situation, it is-~you have to go1 one step deeper.

Namely,

that the attorney did not create the fund, the fund that
consists of the compensation lien.

The compensation lien

is there by virtue of the fact that compensation has been
paid.
QUESTION:

You’re speaking now of the $17,000?

MRa BOECKMANN:
QUESTION:

Yes, I am, Mr. Chief Justice.

I t took no lawyer to produce that fund?

MRo BOECKMANN:

Yes, it is there; like a mortgage

on a house, in the sale of the house.

It is there.

And

whether or not a suit will be brought, an attorney or a
claimant will have to look—-he will have to consider that
fact in determining whether or not he has a viable suit.
And. there is—QUESTION:

Is there provision in the Act for the

payment of an attorney’s fee by the employer to the employee
if the employee must sue for his compensation?
MRo BOECKMAN:
QUESTION:

There is no such provision.

Is it payable?

Suppose the

employer-—

suppose he claims that his compensation, that he’s been
injured in the course of his employment, and the employer
denies it.

And the employee has to bring action to get his

compensation.

31

Suppose he wins.
HRo BOECKMANN:

Then, when there is a contest

between employer and employee within the context of the
compensation—
QUESTION:

Yes?

MRo BOECKMANN:

—'then there is an attorney's

fee allowed, yes.
QUESTION:

Well, that's for the—isn't that under

the statute?
MR. BOECKMANN;

Yes, but that is not—has no

reference to the third-party action.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

But it does provide

for the payment of attorney's fee to the employee in
certain circumstances.
MR. BOSCKMANN:
QUESTION:

Yes, it does.

And the Coirmissioner supervises that?

MRo BOECKMANN:

Yes, the Commissioner does super­

vise that.
And the Act provides--the Act contemplates, it
seeras to me, that the employee, the injured employee, can
proceed in compensation without an attorney.

It is only

where there is some kind of contest, and he chooses to
employ an attorney, and as a result, wins the contest, that
he is—achieves his attorney's fees.
QUESTION:

And also when the employee--

32

QUESTION:

Is that true in every case?

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

QUESTION;

Is that true in every case?

Excuse sie .

Or does

the Commissioner have some discretion to say, "Well, in this
case, it was pretty close, and while you did prevail, X5m
not going to allow attorney's fees."
M.R0 BOECKMANN:

I don’t know what the actual

practice-—day-to-day practice is before the Deputy
Commissioner.

But the Act provides for it.

QUESTION;

Authorizes him to award attorney's fees

to the claimant?
MR. BOECKMANN:
QUESTION:

Yes, it does.

And when the employer sue3 the third

party and recovers, and wants an attorney's fee, the
Commissioner must approve that, too?
MRo BOECKMANN:

Yes.

But he has authority to

check into its reasonableness.
QUESTION:

Well-—certainly I—what was the—will

you tell us again what you just told my brother?
MR0 BOECKMANN:

The—-when the employer sues—

QUESTION:

The third party.

QUESTION:

Right.

MRo BOECKMANN:

The third party—he is entitled

to recover his lien, and he is entitled to an attorney’s
fee out of the recovery.

33
QUESTIONS

—-out of the award, under the statute?

MRo BOECKMANN;

Yes.

And the Deputy Commissioner

has the authority to approve the reasonablenss of that
fee.
QUESTION:

He not only has the authority, but the

employer can't deduct it without getting that approval,, can
he?
QUESTION:

He's required to.

MRo BOECKMANN;

I believe that's true, yes.

And it seems to me to defy logic to say that if
the employer is entitled to

a fee in that situation, he

is not entitled to--he is required to pay a fee where the
employee sues.
And also, the employer really has to take a back
seat for

the first six months, because the employee has the

primary option of proceeding during the first six months.
And therefore, you really would penalize the
employer by requiring him to pay a fee.

And as you

pointed out before, Mr. Justice White, the paying these
fees, and not being able to recoup the full compensation
lien, does diminish the resources of the employer.
It may, in the instance of an individual employee,
have him wind up with a greater recovery.

But that is at

the expense of the other injured employees who don't have
recourse to a third party action, where the accident, for

34

example, is due 100 percent to the longshoreman's own
negligence.
QUESTION:

Well,, I don't know—all that requires

is higher insurance premiums,
MRo BOECKMANN:
QUESTION:

Yes, but fees—

The employee~wno

other employee really's

going to not get his compensation payments,
MRo BOECKMANN:
QUESTION:

But—

Just that they're going to be more

costly to the employer,
MR. BOECKMANN:

Yes,

But in effect, the insurance

premium payment, the higher payments, come out of the
employer's pocket.
QUESTION:

Sure.

MRo BOECKMANN:

And if he's going to have to pay

higher insurance premiums, he may have to shrink his
business, or employ less employees.
QUESTION:

May lower wages?

MRo BOECKMANN:
QUESTION:

So that it is—

Yes, yes,

Or not increase them as much.

MRo BOECKMANN:

And it is—it winds up being a

tax on the economy, which we—my contention is that
Congress did not intend to occur in this case.
It—I would also like to suggest that it's part of
my equitable argument hare that inevitably in a court is to

35

look into the amount, the pro rata allocation of an
attorney's fee out of the lien recovery, that the stevedore
employer will inevitably be drawn into the litigation; he
will have to appear in court; he will have to argue for a
maximum recovery.

And the statute itself appears to me to

contemplate keeping the stevedore employer out of court as
much as possible.
Inevitably, if a judge has the authority over
dispensing of the proceeds of the funds, there's going to
be—the stevedore is going to be involved in the settle­
ment negotiations, the drawing up of a settlement package.
The shipowner contributes so much, the stevedore employer
to reduce his lien, or even perhaps to make-QUESTIQN:

I take it that the most frequent third

party defendant is a shipowner?
MRa BOBCKMANN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

In these cases.

MR* BOECKMANN:

j

Because normally the accident happens!

aboard ship.
QUESTION;

And if you know, is it characteristic

that the same insurance companies may be insuring shipowners
as

who insure stevedores, or do they specialize?
MR. BOECKMANN:

Generally, it's my experience

that shipowners are i,nsurad by P&I clubs, which are
generally foreign insurance companies.

And most stevedoring

36

companies are insured by domestic companies.
QUESTION:

So there is then—-there“s a fight

between a certain kind-—one kind of insurance company and
another kind of insurance company in these cases?
MR„ BOECKMANN:
adversaries.

They are—they are usually

And if the shipowner sees a potential partner

for contribution to settlement/ he will look in that
direction.
And it seems to me that Congress, by using the
language that the

employer shall not be liable directly or

indirectly, intended to obviate this very thing.
And if this Court approves the allocation, pro
rata allocation, of the attorney’s fee out of the lien, as
petitioner argues for, it is going to mean an indirect
payment, some "way or other, by the employer.
I would also like to point out that in the—the
two recent cases decided by this Court on the 19l70—the
1972 amendment to the Act, the Edmonds case and the Director,
Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs v. Rasmussen, in
which the Court was called upon to review the intent of
Congress in enacting the 1972 amendments.
And in both instances this Court, a majority, took
the position that the Court should not rewrite what Congress
had set forth.

In the Edmonds case, it was a question of-—

QUESTION:

Congress hasn’t written anything in

37
this area; I thought you both agreed to that.
MR„ BOECKMANN:

Well, I agree with that.

Congress, it seems to me, took the law

But

as it existed at the

time of the passage of the 1972 amendments—
QUESTION:

Which was:

MRo BOECKMANN:
rata allocation.

No contribution.

That’s right; which was no pro

And Congress, by not addressing this

issue whatever in the statute, intended that the law remain
the same.
And in essence, that was really the issue in
the Edmonds case.

And this-“the majority of this Court took

the position that since Congress did not address the issue
in the remedial legislation, the Congress intended that the
law continue to be the same; and this Court should not
rewrite it.
In—also in, a lesser extent, in the Rasmussen
case, the Court decided that since Congress did not speak
on an issue of a, limitation on death benefits, that the
Court was not going to rev/rite what Congress did not address
I think the same—the Court should take the same
position here, inasmuch as Congress intended to enact a
remedial statute.
QUESTION:

You—I take it you've found no trace in

the legislative history of any attention being given to the
lien°

38
MRo BOECKMANN:
QUESTION:

I have found—

Or making any kind of a specific

provision for a lien which just rests in the ease?
MRo BOECKMANN:

I have found—-I would like to have

found something, Mr. Justice White, but 1 have found not a
word.
QUESTION:

As long as it's in your favor.

MRo BOECKMANN:

I found not a word one way or the

other.
But my feeling is, also, that Congress perhaps
didn't address this issue at all because it really didn't
want to tie the hands of the Court in making an allocation
where the recovery was not sufficient to satisfy both the
attorney's fee and the lien.
And we do not argue that the Court—that by
affirming the Second Circuit here today that the Court would
establish a rigid rule that there would still be room under
the cases for a court to fashion an allocation where there
was not a sufficient third party recoveryto satisfy both the
lien and the attorney's fee out of the recovery.
And that was considered in the—-some of the cases
that were cited pre-'72 law was that, yes, when there
wasn't enough, that there could be a solution worked out.
QUESTION:

But if there was enough, no allocation?

MR. BOECKMANN:

Yes.

Pre- 5 72, there—at a certain

39

point, until there was---the stevedore’s lien came first out
of the recovery, and then the'attorney's fee.

After—-there

are some cases—after 1972, which reversed the process, the
attorney's fee is paid, then the lien.
And we contend that that is a sufficient accommoda­
tion to the 1972 amendments, and this Court doesn't need
go further in

to

further readjusting, because of the change in

situation wrought by the 1972 amendments.

And it doesn't have

to go to the extent of pro rata allocation.
*

And also, we contend that it would be a burden
for the courts and for the employer, in each case, to have
to have a hearing as suggested by the Court in Mitchell, I
believe the Fifth Circuit, case?

because that again would

draw the stevedore-employer into court unnecessarily,
requiring him to employ a lawyer to defend his right to the
lien recovery.
And we contend that it should be an automatic
rule which would—which if this Court affirms the Second
Circuit, would mean that the employer would, in every case
where there is sufficient funds available, pay the attorney's
fee and the lien, that that would mean that the stevedoreemployer would automatically, without a hearing, without
law-, recoup the entire workmen's compensation lien.
QUESTION s

But you suggest a different rule might

be applicable where the recovery did not reach the amount of

40

the compensation awards
MRo BOECKMANN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

The Valentino case, which was recognized,

I gather, by the Second Circuit,
MRo BOECKMANN:
there was sufficient.

Yes.

I believe

the Valentino

But in a case where there was—there

isn't sufficient to cover both, the courts would still have
a free hand to make an allocation.

But only in that kind

of situation.
QUESTION:

It's also suggested in the briefs, at

least, that there might be some different rule where there's
*

a settlement from what the rule would be where there was a
recovery against a. third party.
MRo BOECKMANN:

There--the-—the amicus brief,

I

believe—
QUESTION:

It was the amicus brief, yes.

MRo BOECKMANN:

—suggests that there be a

distinction made where there is a settlement with out the
employer's permission as opposed to one that was made with
the employer’s permission.

And that-—because the settlement

made without the employer’s permission cuts off any right
to future compensation payments; whereas one with the
employer's permission, the Deputy Commissioner is first
required to ascertain any future liability for compensation.
And-—

41
QUESTION:

In your submission, is that a valid

distinction?
MRe BOECKMANN:

I don't join the amicus in that.

I feel that the rule should be uniform, whenever there is a
third party recovery.
QUESTION:

Whether recovery against a third party

is either by way of recovery or by way of a negotiated
settlement?
MR, BOECKMANN:

Yes, that is our position.

Thank you.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
