ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLARD Z. CARR,' JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CARR:

Mr. Chief Justice9 and may it please the

Court:
The question which is before the Court in this ease
is whether the requirement that there be 45 weeks of work
i

within a calendar year in order to achieve the status of s
permanent employee in the California brewing industry, whether

The Ninth Circuit found that it was an all or

I

examination of the system itself, it not only looks like a

It is our position that, from an

..

•

seniority system, it operates as a seniority system, and it is
a seniority system.

I

:i

The California brewing industry at the time this
complaint was filed operated, under a multi-»eiaployer agreement.
There were a number of unions involved under this agreement,
too.

Within the particular classification of brewer, which is

5

the classifj.cat.ion that Mr. Bryant, the plaintiff in this case,
held.

There were three tiers of employees:

There were new em­

ployees , there were temporary employees, and there were perma­
nent employees.

A new employee was an employee who worked 60

days within a calendar year in order to become a temporary em­
ployee.

The temporary emploves was an employee who worked with

in 45 weeks within a calendar year in order to become a perma­
nent employee.
Throughout the time fi~om the date of the employee
first coming to the industry and starts working in the industry
ha starts acquiring seniority.
different bases:

He acquires seniority on two

He acquires seniority on the plant basis, and

he also acquires seniority on an industry basis.

This senior­

ity has different applications for different purposes, but for
each day that the employe® works, he is building up seniority
credit towards various purposes under the agreement.
For example, after the employee has worked 30 days,
he is no longer a probationary employee.

After he has worked

30 days he cannot be discharged except for just cause.

After

he has worked 60 days within a calendar year, then he becomes
a temporary employee.

Nov;, when he is a new employee, as ha is

working along this way, he is building up plant seniority as a
new employee.

He is also building up industry seniority as a

new employee.

Among other new employees he has seniority

rights within the plant, ha would be laid off after other

6

new employees are laid off who are junior to him, and within
the industry he would have also rights as a new employee.
When he becomes a temporary employee,-, he then has
further rights as a temporary employee on the basis of his
work within the particular plant and also as a temporary em­
ployee based upon his work within the industry.

If a temporary

employee is going to be laid off, he is going to be laid off
!

based upon his seniority.

The junior temporary employee work­

ing in that plant will be the first person laid off.

The

senior temporary employee will be the last laid off.

If an

employee is going to be recalled to work within that plant and
they have need for temporary employees, then the temporary em­
ployee with a greater seniority within that plant will he the
first recalled, and the temporary employee with the least sen­
iority within that plant will be the last recalled.
The same situation pertains to permanent employees.
Within the classification of permanent employees, these are
permanent brewers that we are talking about, Yo.ur Honors,
within the classification of permanent employee, employees are
laid off according to their seniority as permanent employees.
The most senior permanent employee is

laid off last, the most

junior employee, permanent employee, is laid off first.

On a

question of recall, this is again on, the basis of plant senior­
ity, the permanent employes with the greatest seniority will
be recalled first and the plant employee, or the permanent

7

employee with the least seniority will be recalled last.
This is the way it works on a olant-bv-plant basis.
In addition to this, there are industry applications of the
seniority principle.

Fox- example, the temporary employee, and

I might pause here for a second to point out that the term
"temporary employee" may be a misnomer.
used in the contract.

It is a term that is

These are not temporary employees in the

sense that they are casual employees.

These temporary employees

may be employees who have worked for a period of years within
the industry and have acquired important and significant
rights.
The temporary -employee, on the basis of his industry
service —- he may work for one company, for two companies, for
three companies •— will acquire rights and will work towards
acquiring the 45 weeks of work within the calendar year which
will enable him to become a permanent employee.

This is an

application of industry seniority.
Also there is another application of industry senior­
ity, as far as temporary employees are concerned.

If a tem­

porary employee is out of work, hess been laid off bv his own.
employer, and all the temporary employees with plant seniority
at another plant have been recalled and there is still need
for additional temporary employees of that plant, the plant
employee or the temporary employee with the greatest industry
seniority will be the first person recalled to that plant.

8

So this is another application of the seniority principle work­
ing within the system.

And the employees also are acquiring

other rights in addition to the competitive rights of seniority
which I mentioned.

They are also acquiring benefit rights.

They are acquiring rights as far as health and welfare are. conearned.

They are acquiring rights as far as pensions are con­

cerned, and they are acquiring rights as far as vacations art»
concerned.
These rights are building up within this multi­
tiered system as the employees progress through the system.
Now, when the system comas to the point where the
employee is working, say, less than 45 weeks, the temporary
employee is working less than 45 weeks within the calendar
year, and so therefore he does not become a permanent employee,
the Ninth Circuit suggested or claimed that this was an allor-nothing proposition, and that he had to start over again on
January 1 of the following year and earn the 45 weeks of work
within that year.

In our opinion this was a failure on the

part of the Ninth Circuit to examine the system as a whole.
As this Court has said on many occasions, seniority systems
are quite varied in their application and the varieties that
they have, and that there’s no one system, as 41 in Teamsters
says, no one system is to ba preferred.
QUESTION:

Mr. Carr ?

MR. CARR:

Yes,

sir.

9

QUESTION?

Will you point out where in the Ninth

Circuit, statement it was incorrect?
MR. CARR:

Well, in our opinion, Your Honor, they

said it was an all-or-nothing proposition.

In other words, a

person had to start over again the following year, and so -QUESTION:

Well, is that incorrect?

MR. CARR:

It is incorrect, Your Honor, in this

respect, in our opinion:

He does not lose his seniority.

He

has his seniority that, he has accuirmralated as a temporary em­
ployee.

If he has worked 40 weeks within 1979 as a temporary

employee, he does not lose that seniority on January 1, 1980
He maintains that seniority, and that will give him the first
opportunity to be referred out to the company from which he
was laid off, assuming he was laid off at the time, and he will
be the last person laid off, based upon that seniority? that
plant seniority that he has acquired is not lost even though
he does not attain permanent status within the year.
QUESTION:

Well, I don’t think the Ninth Circuit

meant it was lost in that respect, but to become a permanent
©nployee he has to start over again, doesn’t he?
MR. CARR:

He has to earn 45 weeks within the calendar

year, but h® does not start over again in the sense that his
seniority is continuing to push him ahead, his seniority, his
plant seniority, his industry seniority, is going to give hira
the best opportunity to work the 45 weeks of work in 1980 to

10

become a permanant employee? .
QUESTION:

Well, is it not true that if one man who

worked a year and a half but happened to work 45 weeks in one
calendar year is a permanent employee, whereas someone who has
worked 35 years, 44 hours a week, still is a temporary employee
and junior to the other one?
MR. CARR:

That's conceivable, Your Honor, but I

think it a very unlikely hypothetical.

This case is before

this Court without any evidence as to th© operation, the
maintenance of the system or how it actually operates.

It is

conceivable under the language of the agreement that, this can
work.

However, I think it is highly unlikely that an employee

would find himself in that position.

There is only two reasons

that an employee, under the situation that you posit, could be
disadvantaged to that extent, and that would be. No. 1, if he
is working for a company which has economic problems, economic
downturns and so therefore they are laying off employees and
there are not the job opportunities at that plant.
fortuity.

That’s on©

The other fortuity would be if the employee himself

was not available, if he was on leave of absence, if he was
sick, if he was injured.

But each day that an employee works

under the system within the industry and', within th© plant, he
is acquiring seniority rights which with reasonable certainty
will assure him of tha bast opportunity, th© best chanca, of
becoming a permanent employee the following year.

In Northern California, the brewing industry —
QUESTION:

Does the record show how many get across

the line between, quote,

temporary,quote, and you admit this

is a poor terra, into the permanent category?
MR. CARR:

No, Your Honor, there is no record.

How­

ever as we indicated in a footnote in our brief, even though
there are allegations that no blacks have made permanent em­
ployee within the industry within the period of time involved
in the complaint, if this case is remanded by this Court, we
are prepared to show that there are seme 777 employees who be­
came permanent employees from the temporary ranks, and that of
that number some 33 percent were minorities, and we ara pre­
pared to show that if this case is remanded by this Court.
Most of these employees, all but 28 of these employees,
became permanent employees in Southern California, out of 777.

For example, he was working

He then transferred, when Falstaff

moved to San Francisco to take over Haram's plant which had
closed, he transferred up there.

At the present time, and this

was indicated in a footnote in our opening brief, there are no
Northern California breweries.

One of the things which I

should also point out on the senioritv principle here is that
if Mr. Bryant had chosen to and if he could have seen what was
’

going to happen in Northern California with the various com­
panies closing down and no longer onerating because of business
adversities, he could have sought transfer to Southern
California and registered for work in the Southern California
area., and been referred out as a temporary employee to on®, of
the Southern California breweries.

Then he might at that point

of time, because they were in an expanding mode and there was
a number of opportunities, job opportunities, he might have
been one of the fortunate ones.

Presumably he would have been,

based upon the seniority principles that I have alluded to,
who would have made permanent, one of the 777 employees who have
made permanent in the last ten years.
QUESTION:

Are there no local Northern California

beers any more?
MR. CARR:

There are no Northern California breweries

operating at the present time, and all fch© companies that war®
operating under the California Brewers Association contract
have now closed down, including Falstaff, Hamm's, General

13

Brewing Corporation» and Burgermeister was another one that
was operating at one point.
There are only three companies operating in California
at the present time, which are Schlitz, Millerrs, and AnheuserBusch.

Pabst closed down, which was a Southern California

company, earlier this year, which is also -QUESTION:

Pabst was originally Wisconsin, a Wisconsin

MR. CARR:

Yes, and Anheuser-Busch was originally

St. Louis, but these are companies that were operating in
California, and Pabst no longer has a plant in California.
QUESTION:

Did they drink more beer in Southern

California than in Northern?
(Laughter.)
MR. CARR:

That may be true, Your Honor.

I haven't

seen any statistics on that; that might be something that
would come to the Court’s attention on remand, but I don't
know.
In any event, one of the arguments of the Supreme —
of the Ninth Circuit in this particular case was that this
system is subject to manipulation.

In our opinion it is not

subject to manipulation, because it is a seniority system.
is a measure of time worked.

It

An employee advances within the

system from temporary to permanent status based upon the time
that he works.

His layoff and recalls from layoff are based

14

upon the time that he works.

This is an objactive standard.

*

This is —
QUESTION:

Based on the time he worked in one year?

MR. CARR:

Not the time — his layoff is not deter­

mined on the basis of the time he worked in one vear, Your
Honor.
QUESTION:

No, but you said he advanced from temporary

to permanent based on the time he worked —
MR. CARR:

That’s right.

QUESTION:

■— amended that to say on the time he

worked in one year.
MR. CARR:

Yes, but inexorably,

the time that he

has worked before that particular year will push him up to the
front of the ranks of those people who will be -r-who‘will—re­
ceive the first opportunities for the allocation of the avail­
able work in the year in question. •His seniority is not lost.
His seniority continues, and h® will fee the first recalled and
ha will be the last laid off, based upon his seniority as a
temporary employee, so he will then become a permanent employe®
that much more certainly, based upon the service that he has
already accummulated as a temporary employee.
QUESTION:

Is this a common pattern in th© area?

MR. CARR:

Yes, sir, it’s common.

There are also soma

other cases that have been cited in the brief and in the AFL-CIO
brief included in their appendix an example in the Seafarers'

,15

Union where this type of program exists , where the case is
cited in our brief; the New Jersey Brewing Company, involved
a situation where employees had to work on a similar basis»
Gerber Foods involved a situation where the War Labor Board
directed that the provision be that there be 600 hours within
a six-month period, which is auite similar to what we have
here.
So there is a considerable precedent for this type
of system

and this operation of a system along this line.
As the Chief Justice said in a case decided a few

years ago, when he was a judge in Outland, that very seldom is
length of service being considered the dominant factor, and
that is contrary to experience and also to judicial attitude
to say that it is the dominant factor.

In this case we do have

a measure of time worked, and whether it be within a discreto
period of time, as in 45 weeks within a calendar year, it is
still a period of time worked.

It is not run into any of the

vises that might b© considered in other types of cases, if you
are dealing with a supervisor's evaluation or an educational
test or something like that.
standard.

This is an objective seniority

It is a measure of time worked, and it operates just

on that basis.
Our position, as far as th® disposition of this
case, the disposition that this Court should make of this case,
is first, that it should be remanded to the District Court for

16

Mr. Bryant to have the opportunity to prove any allegations of
intentional or differential treatment that ha may be able to
establish.
Secondly, if there is some question in the Court's
mind or in the party's mind as to whether this is a bona fide
system which was specifically not addressed by the Ninth Cir­
cuit, then it should be remanded to have a determination made
and evidence taken.
One of the problems with this case is thcit this case
is before you without a record as to the actual operation or
without any evidence as to whether there is any question of
the bona fides of this particular case, particular provision.
Finally, we think that this court can and. should
decide that this provision, this particular provision, based
upon an examination of the totality of the seniority system
within the California brewing system, how it works on a plant
basis, how it works on an individual company basis, that it
must be held to be a seniority system, and therefore within
the exemption 703(H) of Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of
1964.

QUESTION:

And if the Court accepts your argument,

what action should we take in this case, to remand it —

bona fide?

MR. CAJRR:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

—- to see if, A, first of all, it was

17

MR. CARR:

If there is any question raised and it has

not been decided yet, yes, it should be remanded to determine
if it is bona fide.
QUESTION:

And then also for consideration of the

plaintiff's Title 7 claims —
MR. CARR:

Intentional discrimination.

QUESTION:

No, I meant this is a seniority system,

the issues would be if it’s bona fide and secondly, even if it
is bona fide, was there discrimination quite apart from this
seniority.
MR. CARR:

That's right.

And under the principles

of Franks v. Bowman, the Court can grant relief if they find
differential treatment without disturbing the seniority system.
QUESTION:

Right, right.

QUESTION:

Mr. Carr, I suppose there isn't any pos­

sibility of the unions and management working out something
different.

This is an old type of thing, surely as a lawyer,

in the face of 703(H), you wouldn't be drafting this kind of
a system today?
.MR. CARR:

I might not, Your Honor.

It':; oeen

around for 25 years and it has worked satisfactorily, as far
I

as the parties ar© concerned, for over the last 25 years.

In

addition, you may also notice that there is another category
of employees within the agreement.

That's the permanent

bottler and th© temperory bottler.

You progress from a

18

temporary bottler to a permanent bottler based on 1,600 hours
of war3c, and that, of course, gives credit for overtime work
that you may perform, and that was a change from an earlier
provision where they required 45 weeks of work within the cal­
endar year.

They changed it to 1,600.

It may be that through the process of collective
bargaining, which is where we think it belongs rather than be­
fore this Court, through the process of collective bargaining
there may be a change in the way that the contract reads, and
how you move from tomporarv to permanent.

We believe it is up

to the parties, rather than to the courts.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose the argument is that it

is the collective bargaining that is the barrier, and it's net
too dissimilar from the case we had this morning,
MR. CARR;

Yes, Your Honor, but this is, in our

opinion, within a specific exemption granted by Congress in
Section 703(H), and to give Congress its due, this should be
held to foe exempt from the reach of Title 7 otherwise,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Wilder.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROLAND P. WILDER, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF UNION RESPONDENTS SUPPORTING
PETITIONER
MR. WILDER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
There are a number of facts in this record, some of

19

which have;bean touched on by Mr. Carr on behalf of petitioners
that cannot be disputed and that are, in our view, determina­
tive of this case.

One of these facts is that the 45 week

rule is based on time served.

It is based on service.

In de­

termining whether that rule reflects th© seniority principle
therefore, it becomes necessary to determine, to find out under
the system how a temporary employee's chances of working 45
weeks in a calendar year are allocated.
As Mr. Carr has indicated, the competition for work
t

opportunities among temporary employees is determined by plant
and industry seniority that accrues from year to year.

It is

this accrued interaction of seniority that affords the employee
the opportunity to work 45 weeks in a calendar year and there­
fore satisfy the requirement.
So viewed against th® context of the total seniority
system, it seems apparent that the 45 week rule and the ac­
quisition of permanant status reflect seniority principles to
the fullest possible degree.
On® of the functions of th© 45 week rule is to regu­
late competition between so-called permanent employees and
temporary employees.

It is the way, in other words, that in­

dustry service is given partial seniority credit at the plant,
or as the government says at page 24 of its brief, "It is a
measure o£ time worked."

And like other measures of seniority,

the 45 week rule is to a great extent determinative of where

20

an employee appears on the seniority list.
Mr. Bryant has always agreed that the brewery system
should extend recognition to length of industry service.
appears at page 306 and 307 of the record.

That

But neither he nor

the government likes the 4 5-weak rule because it does not give
controlling effect to what they describe as cumulative length
of service.

We submit that in seeking to restrict Section

703(H) to cumulative length of service systems, our opponents
apparently confuse simple longevity with seniority,.

Longevity

is only one of the values that are reflected in seniority
arrangements.
If it war© th® only value, if it ware th© only value,
all seniority systems would allocate' opportunities across th©
broadest possible basis.

There would b© no collectiva bargain­

ing agreements establishing separate units of seniority, as
appeared in the system considered by this Court in Teamsters.
There would be no agreements having rules providing for breaks
in seniority or for lots of accrued seniority all together, as
can b© found in virtually ©very collective bargaining agree­
ment ,
But th© point is —
QUESTION;

In effect, if that's all seniority means,

all you would need to do is have a on© or two sentence defini­
tion of it, the number of days you've worked for the plant?
MR, WILDER;

I am not sure I follow that question.

21

QUESTION:

Well, yob are saying that if seniority is

as simple as the Ninth Circuit said it was, than all you would
need in defining a seniority system is a one or two sentence

MR. WILDER:

Simply a sentence in the collective

bargaining agreement saying that plant seniority shall govern
for all purposes.

That would b@ the end of tha seniority

It would not —
QUESTION:

It would still have to be, I suppose, de­

fined in terms of interruptions and so on.
MR. WILDER:

Well, I think that there is one other

factor that would have to ba there other than the measure of
seniority.

There would have to b© a definition of the field

of eligible —
QUESTION:

Certainly, there has to be all sorts of

ground rules.
MR„ WILDER:

Otherwise you -- compete, using their

plant seniority.
But the point that I wish to make, and I think it is
an important'

one, that tha qualifications on absolute accum-

mulation. of seniority exist today.

They existed in 1964 when

Title 7 was passed and they existed from the b€jginni.ng of
saniority arrangements in the 18809s in the railroad industry.
f'

Congress in 1964 acted to protect vested seniority
rights, those rights that had accrued under seniority systems

22

of whatever form and descriptione

We think it plain that

Congress did not seek to restrict Section 703(h)'s protections
to so-called cumulative length of service systems, if indeed
such systems exist at all.
Thank you.

I would like to reserve the rest of my

time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Wolpman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES WOLPMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, WOLPMAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I must add to the facts, shortly, anyway.

Firstly,

there is still a brewery in Northern California; AnheuserBusch operates a very large brewery in Fairfield.

During much

of the time that this dispute was going or:, there were likewise
other breweries in Northern California where Mr. Bryant could
have worked.
Mr. Bryant seems to fall into th© category of an inconceivable situation, as Mr. Carr has phrased it, in view of
the fact that he worked for seven years in tha Northern
California brewery industry and never was able to pass the
barrier into permanent employment.
QUESTION:

Well, h© obviously didn't work for seven

MR. WOLPMAN;

That's correct..,

Did this case go off on summary judgment,

or was it after a trial?
MR. WOLPMAN;

And the motions for.summary judgment

granted by the breweries ware granted and those judgments war®
reversed by the Ninth Circuit? '
MR. WOLPMAN;
QUESTION;

That is correct. Your Honor.

And remanded'?

MR. WOLPMAN;

r~—.J

That's correct.

There are two other important facts.

One is that

there is no difference in 'the actual day to day work carried
on by a permanent brewer and by a temporary brewer.

Yet there

is a tremendous difference in the pay and benefits which ac­
crue to those two categories.,

24

In our brief we have indicated with citations to
appropriate parts of fch© collective bargaining agreement no
less than 16 areas where the permanent brewer is advantaged
over the temporary.

Well, that’s true of someone who has

worked five years on an assembly line and someone who has
worked 25 years on an assembly line, too, isn’t it?
MR. WOLPMAM:

I doubt that it would be that extreme.

This is certainly an extreme situation.

I want to point that

out, because the Ninth Circuit took that, I think, into ac­
count iii sort of a litmus paper test, if you want, as to
whether this was a seniority provision.
QUESTION:

What do you mean, a litmus paper test?

MR. WOLPMAN:

Any — there are so many differences,

the system operates so harshly on the temporary as compared to
other people down the seniority lines in other kinds of opera­
tions, and the cut-off, this all-or-nothing thing, is so
unique that I think that that possibility led the court to go
on from that and begin to analyse what was behind that possi­
bility as revealing that what was really going on hers was
something other than seniority considerations, and I will try
to draw that out a little more in my argument, Your Honors, as
we proceed,
QUESTION:

But if the case went off on summary judg­

ment or motion to dismiss, how can the Ninth Circuit have any

25

peculiar knowledge as to what was, quote, "behind,* close
quote, the agreement?
MR. WOLPMAN:
Your Honor.

The agreement itself will tell us a lot,

It will tell us that there is a tremendous finan­

cial advantage to the ©«plover if he utilises temporaries who
do the same work as permanents, that that’s the purpose for
this provision.

It's not a seniority provision.

QUESTION:

But it was collectively bargained for by

the union, which simply has the employae in mind.
MR. WOLPMAN:
ployees in mind.

Right, and the union did have some em­

That's the other part of the purpose.

old time employees definitely were taken into account.

Th©
In fact,

essentially a finite wage and benefit package has been divided
up by those few permanents to the disadvantage of the tem­
poraries.
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t that a complaint that tempor­

aries may have against the union, rather than the possible
permanent employes has against fch© employer?
MR, WOLPMAN:

I think it raises really no —* th®

question that, is this really a seniority provision or is it
a thing that allows the employer low-paid labor and th© old
v

timers the right to divide up a package among themselves, a
smaller numbers

Now, that’s

I'in not saying those reasons

are necessarily illegitimate or illegal.

1 am saying those

are not the reasons that lie at the root of the seniority

26

principle.

The root of the seniority principle is to reward

the accummulation of service* to reward the person as he works
for years and years.

Not to, what it does for the employer,

make it cheaper, or for the unions, allow a few people to share
all of the benefits.
QUESTION;

But to the extent that it makes it more

expensive for the employer to keep on employees who have worked
for a number of years and the employer has a finite amount of
money that he can devote to labor costs, it necessarily makes
it cheaper for the employer with respect to new employees.
MR. WOLPMAN;

It certainly does. Your Honor, but

that is not seniority; that is our point.

That, is something

else, and that's something that would have to be justified as
a business necessity.

Remember, we'ra not saying that the

45 week provision is automatically invalid.

We're saying if

we go back to the district court, we will have to establish
that it indeed does perpetuate the discrimination of the past
and the employer will have the opportunity to establish that
indeed he has to have it that way because it's a business
necessity.•
QUESTION:

But any bona fide seniority system is

necessarily going to be top heavy with labor costs at the upper
end of the age scale of the workers, and if there's a finite
amount of wages, of money available to the employer, it's
going to be conversely lower in the lower1 wage scales,,

27
MR. WOLPMAW:

I think we have to get at the — to get

to the answer to that question, you have to begin to see what
kind of industry we are talking about here, Mr.
Rehnquist.

Justice

You have to see that we are talking about a seasonal

industry and a seasonal industry — what is unique about ii
seasonal industry is that it is tied to the calendar year.

It

is a calendar year notion, and the biggest t sing about jobs :Ln
that kind of industry is whether or not you are a year-rounder
or whether you are just seasonal»

That is ingrained in the job

structure of the seasonal, industry.

And what; the 45-week pro­

vision is about is about the classification structures that
escist in seasonal industries.

It is not about seniority.

Seniority comes into play in the first half of the sentence,
45 weeks in a calendar year»

Forty-five weeks, as the govern­

ment indicates, is a seniority measure.

In a calendar year is

something that comes frcra somewhere else, that comas frcan the
principles that I have indicated to you, the advantages that
accrue to the employer and to the old-time union members that
have nothing to do with seniority.

So you put those two to­

gether and you get the 45-week rule.
QUESTION:

Well, you say that a rule where 45 weeks

out of 52 does not count as seniority, or say 44 does not
advance one towards seniority, is a seasonal industry?
MR. WOLPMAN:

That’s right, Your Honor.

The typical

way that you will find in the packing industry, for example,

28
you will find these same kinds of structures which are being
attacked, too.

They have to do with the job structure and of

the industry, not with seniority.
QUESTION:

What is the vacation period, the maximum,

for a very senior employee in this industry?
MR. WOLPMAN:
Your Honor.

I don’t know off the top of my head.

I suspect that it is —-

QUESTION:

It must be at least two or three weeks,

isn’t it?
MR. WOLPMAN:
QUESTION:

More likely three than two„

MR. WOLPMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s right»

That’s right.

It is

Possibly four?

MR. WOLPMAN:

Possibly.

It can get very difficult

to pass —
QUESTION;

Then you don’t have many •— you don’t

have much range between five weeks — between four weeks and
seven weeks.
MR. WOLPMAN:

It is a very, very difficult hurdle

and it is a, hurdle that again

the Ninth Circuit observed

that it is a hurdle that you have to be very mistrustful of

2
\

because in any large industry there is enough free play in
the scheduling of the start-up of production and in the timing
of layoffs to very easily allow an employer the economies

i

that come with maintaining a large low-paid labor pool.
1 ,

29
I think that the best way I can portray what I am
trying to get at here is to put it in the context of collective;
1
.

fi:

bargaining.

In collective bargaining, the union comes in with

proposals and the management comes in with counter proposals
that seek to limit or to alter the proposals.
the way it is with seniority.
seniority provisions.

That is exactly

Unions will generally propose

Management will answer with counter-

vailing limitations on the seniority provisions, limitations
such as testing, ability, supervisor’s recommendations or
what not.

Those are non-seniority principles, and what you

may come up with is some kind of compromise
!

between those

two.
QUESTION:

Since this was decided rather summarily,

as it was, I suppose there is nothing in this case in the
record to show the history of the collective bargaining of
this particular provision, is there?
MR. WOLPMAN:

No, Your Honor.

Of course, we would —
!

i

QUESTION:

One can assume- that if it followed the

pattern that you are describing, give and take,,
MR. WOLPMAN:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

Now, given that give and take, I think that —» and
this is the real danger of the position that the employers are
taking — given that give and take, what they want to say is
i

that any system that combines those two elements, the seniority
principle plus the conflicting countervailing considerations

30

which have been interjected in the course of bargaining by the
employer, that that entire system is protected.

In other
j

words, you have not only the seniority principle but you have
•

the concerns that are coming from the opposite directione

j

Now, I think that that —- and that is why they say a \
mixed system is protected, such that — well, they are willing
to acknowledge that a test, for example, as a grounds for pro- I
motion would be invalid.

They would claim 703(h) protection

for a test combined with a seniority provision.
Now, besides these countervailing non-seniority

!

considerations that do come from management, there are again thp
seniority principle and the aspects of It have to be worked out :3
There have to be rules of how seniority is obtained in a unit, j
i

there have to be rules for loss of seniority, there have to
be rules for breaks in service»
These rules have to do with the elaboration of the

'
.

seniority principle.
:

They are a part of seniority»

They do

j

not concern the countervailing considerations that the employers generally have introduced to erode the notion of seniority.
They could be said to compliment or elaborate rather than
override, supersede or restrict»
So the real issue here becomes is the 45-week pro­
vision in a calendar year one of these housekeeping ground

"

rules or is it something that is coming from another direction,
from the countervailing limitations on seniority.

And that

i

31
I think requires an analysis of the purpose behind the ^5 weeks
in a calendar year.
So I think that ultimately you have to get at the
purpose behind this, and this is nothing new.

The Court has

don® this in the veterans cases, in Accardi and in Alabama
Power.

It didn’t take what management and labor agreed to
■

as seniority or non-seniority in those cases at face value.
It said we have to look at it, we have to enter the —
QUESTION:

Didn’t the Ninth Circuit send this back

for trial or did it simply s&y this is not a seniority system?
MR. WOLPMAN:

Well, it sent it back for trial but

it also said that this is not a seniority system, therefore
we would go to trial on the issue of whether it does perpetuate
discrimination and whether it can be justified, as a business
necessity.

It eliminated 703(h), Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, if you are right and you have to

kind of look at the purpose of the thing and get behind it, I
would think that was a factual issue if there ever was one.
MR. WOLPMAN:

I would say that except that the facts

are so completely clear from the nature of the collective
bargaining agreement.

The obvious economic advantage which

accrues to the employer by maintaining a few permanents and
as many temporaries as possible, the obvious advantage which
has been pointed out by Law Professor Slichter in his book
which is cited in all the briefs as to the old-timers getting

32
what they want.

There is nothing wrong with the old-timers

getting what they want.

There is nothing wrong with the

employer trying to save money.

But that is not seniority.

That is not what section 703(h) was about.
QUESTION:

But it certainly was collective bargain*»

ing.
MR. WOLPMAN:

It certainly was collectae bargain­

ings but not everything, as we well know from the history of
title VII litigation3 in collective bargaining is to be pro­
tected.

I think there is a real danger that if we took this

mixed notion of seniority, that is the rules for working out
seniority principle and these countervailing consideration's
that the expansion that would occvir in 703(h) would wind its
way into just about every part of the collective bargaining
agreement.

We point out 16 areas in this collective bargain­

ing agreement where the seniority principle plays some role.
Now, if every area that is touched by that principle is
automatically protected by 703(h), I question whether Congress
did not enact the Seniority Protection Act of 1964 rather
than the Civil Rights Act of 1964»
QUESTION:

On the other hand, if this is not a

seniority system there is going to be quite a swarth cut
through collective bargaining agreements, isn't there?
MR. WOLPMAN:
QUESTION:

No greater swarth, Your Honor —

Well, how do you appraise the position of

33
the AFL-CIO?
MR. WOLPMAN:
QUESTION:

Well —

They say this Is a seniority system.

MR. WOLPMAN:

They say that it is a seniority —

they actually adopt our reasoning.

They say that anything

that overrides seniority is not a seniority system, but then
they adopt a definition of the people who can compete in a
system that sort of brings in -QUESTION:

In any event, this is a seniority system

in their view.
MR. WOLPMAN:
QUESTION:

In their view, yes.

I suppose they wouldn’t be so interested

if this would only affect maybe one or two stray collective
bargaining agreements,
MR. WOLPMAN:

It certainly affects any collective

bargaining agreement or many collective bargaining agreements
in seasonal industry, and I think that In analysing this
problem the Court Is going to have to inevitably meet the
question of Just how broad 703(h) could be -- that Is, could
it include these countervailing considerations, and that is
important,

Court in

the veterans cases has

not turned its back on what is

and what

is not a seniority andleft it entirely to whatever

the union and the management happen to say.
I think it is an old and very sad story.

When

people can*t clean their own houses* the government sometimes
has to clean it for them, and the history of the intrusion of
the government in the area of discrimination into employment
relationships is one that has showed a great deal of patience
and reluctance on the part of the government.
Up until 19^5 when the steel ease. Steel v.
Louisville and National Hallway case was decided, the govern­
ment had

dismal discrimination.

Your argument about whether this is a

seniority system or not would be the same whether there was
any racial aspects to this case at all,
MR. WOLPMAN:

Yes. Your Honor, I think we have to

It only becomes critical

35
in the racial case in a racial situation because of the way
the legislation is drawn, of course.

I think we have to work

towards an analysis of —
QUESTION:

It won’t be just race, it will be any

kind of what could be called invidious discrimination that
could be gotten at —

MR. WOLPMAN:

Well, that would have to be gotten at

only through the duty of fair representation, Your Honor„

And

as I pointed out, probably under the duty of fair representa­
tion which we had for twenty years and did not accomplish the
purpose that it was supposed to, it may be impossible to get
at this kind of situation.
Under title VII which, again, after twenty years
Congress decided that it could not countenance what was going
on in the work place and it came in with another stronger
test.

It wasn’t the duty of fair representation test, it was

the business necessity.
And so I think that the Court sees a tremendous
amount of patience and it is time —»

Well, certainly.-ra good deal of that

Whether this is -QUESTION;

A record of witnesses?

MR. WQLPMAN:

No» I don't think that is necessary.

The seniority system is a creature of contract.

We can look

at the contract which is before this Court and say is there a
mechanism in there which protects the accumulation of service
as a way of advancing, and I think we can see from the M5«week
provision that it does not.
Thank you.
MR„ CHIEF JUSTICE.BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Wallace*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE., ESQ. „
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. WALLACE;

Mr. Chief Justice9 and may it please

the Court;
As the United States views the governing legal
principles in this case,, the broader propositions urged by
the employers and the unions here prove too raucho

Seniority

37
in the sense of length of service is ordinarily a substantial
ingredient in transfers, promotions, layoffs, rehirings, and
in measuring compensation and fringe benefits„

This cannot

mean, we submit, that all additional criteria considered along
with seniority for such purposes thereby become part of a
it! i

seniority system within the meaning of section 703(h) and

I" thereby become immunised from examination under- the ordinary
standards of title VII.

Otherwise, the limited purpose excep­

tion of 703(h) would largely swallow up title VII?s guarantee
of nondiscrimination in transfers, promotions, layoffs, rehir­
ings, and in compensation and fringe benefits»
So our major premise in this case is that a rule
such as the 45-week rule that is at issue here must be separate­
ly scrutinised for purposes of section 703(h) to determino
whether It embodies the seniority principle»
Another way of stating the same proposition is that
we don’t believe the use of the word "system" in section 703(h)
is meant to be a grabbag for non-seniority considerations that
ean be tied in with seniority considerations and thereby im­
munised from the basic nondiscrimination principle of title VII.
If anything, we would submit that it would be more
plausible to read the word "system5’ in 703(h) as indicating
the way in whieh seniority can be used
discrimination principle.

-*o

override the non­

It is only systematic use rather

than ad hoc use of seniority which is being authorised to

38
override the basic purpose of the statute3 the nondiscrimina­
tion principle so that there will be a guarantee that to the
extent seniority will override the basic principle of the
statute* it will be systematic seniority available to all
classes of persons rather than ad hoc use of seniority that
might prejudice the protected classes.
Now, our minor premise in this case — that is the
fundamentally important question before the Court — our minor
premise is that the *4 5-week rule at issue here does not embody
the seniority principle as we understand it because it does
not provide reasonable certainty of progression based prin­
cipally on cumulative length of satisfaetori/ and reasonably
continuous service.

This does not mean that the rule is in­

valid but only in our submission that it is net immunised by
section 703(h) from challenge under title VII.

And the legal

standard I have stated is a rather complex one, involving
cumulative length of satisfactory and reasonably continuous
service and reasonable certainty of progression.
QUESTION:

Is the Ninth Circuit standard?

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I don’t think they were that

specific, Mr. Justice, although they said nothing inconsistent
with this, as I read their opinion.

It seems to me the

complexities of seniority rules largely go to determining
these various elements that I am stating, rather than to in­
corporate in other considerations and other values that don’t

39
go to effectuating the basic principle of seniority, which is
what Congress meant to protect.

Their discussion was largely

in terms of last hired-first fired kind of relatively simple
considerations.
‘I

It seems to us that this is the approach to 703(h)
that is faithful to the basic purpose of title VII which was
to assure that there would be a nondiscrimination principle

;

!! applicable to work rules affecting all these valuable rights
in the employment relationship.

And our view of what con­

stitutes seniority for these purposes is supported as well by
this Court’s decisions by analogy considering what constitutes
seniority for purpose of veterans’ reemployment rights under
the Military Selective Service Act.
As we explain in some detail in our brief on pages
i

8 and 9 and in Footnote 7S one of the reasons we think this
45-week rule does not meet the legal standard for purposes of
703(h) is because of the fortuities that it permits to dis­

I

place cumulative length of service as determinative of
achieving the permanent status that is involved {here.
'■

j

But

‘ •; :r ;

even if in our view it produced results that more closely
approximated cumulative length of service9 it still seems to
us would not be a rule that is part of a seniority system1 bei

j

cause of the lack of reasonable certainty of progression
which was the basic reason why in the McCart case cited and
discussed in our brief this Court held that a veteran was not

entitled to a promotion, that he could not be reasonably cer­
tain of having received during the period of his military
service.

That, after all, is an act in which seniority being

an ameliorative pz’lnciple should be broadly interpreted where
here is an exception that should be narrowly interpreted»
Instead, what we have is a classification system
which, as Mr. Wolpman has explained, has something of an us
and then syndrome in which there is no reasonably certain
progression from the class of them to the class of us that can
be earned through stages of seniority through which there is
some kind of systematic progression.
Mow, it may be that in this industry these classifi­
cations are justified by the business needs of the particular
industry, and we don't say that in determining whether the
business justification has been met under title VII.

There Is

no room for flexibility in the collective bargaining px’oeess,
QUESTION:

But if the business justification has

been met, wouldn’t it be also a business Justification for
that kind of a seniority system?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, the seniority aspects of this

contract don't need justification, In our view, Mr. Justice,
because they are protected by 703(h) and some of those were
recited by Mr. Carr.

But the *35-week rule, for the reasons

I have just stated, is not part of the seniority provisions»
QUESTION:

Well, you say then that the plaintiff

4l
can pick and choose as among the seniority provisions and say
some are protected by 703(h) and some aren’t?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that question presupposes that

the.M5-week rule is a seniority provision, but I have devoted
my entire argument to the reasons why we think it is not a
seniority provision.

So I can only say that it is not a

matter of picking and choosing the seniority provisions that
are protected by 703(h), but this is not a seniority system
botSi because it is not based principally on cumulative length
of service and because there is no sasonable certainty of
progression from one class to another here.
But we do believe that there is in meeting the
business necessity test considerable room for flexibility in
the bargaining process for reasonable accommodations to meet
the substantial needs of the industry, but the inquiry still

I
|

must be as a justification of these classifications whether
this does meet a substantial need of the industry»
There is room for flexibility in determining how to
meet the substantial needs, but the question if a prima facie
showing of discriminatory impact is made would be whether a
classification system of this type

is necessary to meet subi

stantial needs in this industry.

All of this has not been

explored, although some justifications have been recited in
the briefs»
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, I take it that if the

|

i
l

H2
employer and the union had a contract and they agreed that one
classification of employees was permanent employees, then in
this company there would be a hundred permanent employees, and
that as a permanent employee retired he would be replaced and
he would be replaced by the fellow who had worked the longest
time in the last two years.

Mow, I take it that you would

have the same problem with that.
MB. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Well, there might be --

Well, it would be the same thing..

MR. WALLACE:

It is very similar, although there

would be some additional certainty of progression in your
hypothetical, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Why?

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

What, for example?

Because here —

The difference between two years and one.

MR. WALLACE:

Here the indications are that autoraa-

.

fcion is reducing the number of permanent employees and that
people are not progressing into that rank, but this is nothing
that has not been explored in detail.

It is an allegation and

the Court of Appeals, although I can’t say what it is based on,
stated that no one in Northern California is advancing from
one class to the other.
QUESTION:

But in this case the question of seniority

has been finally disposed of by the Ninth Circuit, it is no
longer an issue in the case.

43
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct, Mr. Justice, based on

their interpretation of the terras of the agreement.
QUESTION:

And you agree with that?

MR. WALLACE:

We agree with that, but what is a

principal concern to us are the governing legal principles
which I attempted to state.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROLAND P. WILDER, JR., ESQ.,

MR. WILDER:

matters.

I am advised that the Fairfield plant never had

been covered by the agreement in issue, that the industry

Although, Mr. Chief Justice, the maximum amount of

QUESTION:
MR. WILDER:

But that would be a permanent employee.
Yes, it would be.

It would be normally

through the accrual of an industry vacation by accumulating
time at different plants.

i

QUESTION:

So even this fellow would work only 46

weeks In the year then if he qualified —
MR. WILDER:
fied for it.

If he took the vacation or if he quali­

You earn your vacation on the basis of time

worked according to a particular formula.

You donTt get six

weeks automatically.
QUESTION:

I suspect there aren’t all that many six

weeks peoples are there?
MR® WILDER:

I do not know, Your Honor.

I suspect

not, however®
I should point out that with respect to the allega­
tion that the purpose of the agreement is creating a pool of
cheap labor, the temporary employees earn vacations, too.

In

fact, Mr. Eryant earned a vacation by working 45 weeks in two
calendar years at F&lst&ff.
The point is that the benefits under the agreement,
the very expensive benefits — pension, health and welfare —
•i

are held by temporary employees.,

This is not a depressed pool

of labor®
Now, building on that theme, I should like to suggest
the analysis suggested by the Ninth Circuit and urged by the
government and respondent here will affect every collective
bargaining agreement because their arguments go not so much
to the classifications but they go to the appropriateness of
this seniority system.

Under the guide of determining whether

45
or not it is a seniority system, they are questioning the ap­
propriateness.
Let me refer to at least some of the adjectives that
I have heard them use just before this Court.
It is unfair.

It is unjustified.

It is unnecessary.

It is harsh.

We can’t see the business

These are questions that go to the appropriateness

of the choice that was made by management and labor.

QUESTION:

But the government says more than that.

The government says that — it proposes two criteria by which

MR. WILDER:

The government proposes a cumulative

length of service criterion which is a criterion and hence
forth has been unknown in the real world of collective bar­
gaining.

They propose absolute cumulative length of service.

Any provision that does not measure up —
QUESTION:

Isn't it triggered by that — any

advantage that isn’t triggered by cumulative services not a
part of a seniority system?
MR. WILDER:

That’s correct.

Now, there has been a

suggestion that if this Court holds that this particular pro­
vision is a seniority system within the meaning of section
703(h), it will be open to yawn and gap.

The title VII

46
protection will be inevitably wounded*

I can't see how this

will happen.
What the Ninth Circuit and what the government are
concerned about is privileging classification devices,
privileging just educational requirements and other obvious
non-seniority criteria.

These are the overriding factors that

all parties, the employers, the unions and the APL have in­
dicated would not be covered by section 703(h) protection.

It deals with

And because it is itself based on service, there is

no possibility whatever that there could be any confusion be­
tween an obvious seniority provision like this rule and the
