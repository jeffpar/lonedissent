MRo CHIEF■JUSTICE BURGER:

The hearing next is the

United States v. Clifford Bailey.
Mr. Knfeedler, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEBIER, ESQ „
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRo KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
\

>

These cases are before the Court on a writ of
certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit.

The cases arise unifier the

Federal statute 18 United States Code Section 751 that
prohibits a person from, escaping from the custody of the
Attorney General or from any custody in which he was placed
under Federal law pursuant to court order.
Thar© are two issues presented.
First is whether in establishing the intent element
of the crime of escape, ths Government is required to prove
merely that the defendant left the prison consciously, not
inadvertently.

In addition, the Government prove that ths

defendant intended to avoid only those, aspects of confinement
in the prison that may be regarded as normal.

Under the

latter formulation which was adopted by the Court of Appeals
in this case, a prisoner whc deliberately left a prison
but did so for the purpose of avoiding certain harsh

4
conditions there would not commit the crime of the State.
The second issue concerns the nature of the
showing a defendant in an escape case must make under Section
751 in order- to raise the defense duress.

This defense

has long been recognised that the common law and generally
in Federally criminal prosecutions.

The Court must decide

here whether a defendant who raises the duress offense in
an escape prosecution must show that he was threatened with
imminent serious harm at the time of his departure from the
jail.

And whether he can raise the defense if fee remained

in hiding after he departed from prison.
Respondents Bailey, Walker and Cooley were
convicted following a jury trial and escaped from the
District of Columbia jail.

Each was sentenced to five

years imprisonment t© serve consecutively to sentences
previously imposed.
Respondent Coclay was convicted in a later jury
trial of escaping from the District of Columbia jail as
well and he too was sentenced to imprisonment for five
years.
Prior to the escape Respondent Bailey had been,
serving a sentence in the Leavenworth penitentiary on
conviction of bank robbery and attempted escape but he was
brought to the District of Columbia to testify in a pending
criminal case.

5
Respondent Walker was also serving & sentence in
the Leavenworth penitentiary ©a conviction of bank robbery
and he too was brought to the District of Columbia to
testify.
Respondent Cooley was serving his sentence in the
District of Columbia jail based on a conviction for unlawful
possession of firearms.
The evidence at the trial of these three. Respondents
showed that they left the jail in the early morning hours-of
August 26, 1976 by crawling through & window in the Northeast
1 Unit of the District of Columbia jail, which was the
maximum security facility at the jail.
They were apprehended by FBI agents in the
District of Columbia on November 19, December 13 and September
27, respectively, which was from one to three months after
their departure from the jail.
Respondents did not dispute at trial that they
left the jail without permission and that they had remained
in hiding until they ware apprehendedi

But they sought to

justify their escape by introducing evidence of what they
contended were intolerable conditions in the jail;
Early in the trial mid on several occasions
thereafter the Government argued that they were net entitled
to raise the defense of duress because they had not
surrendered to custody promptly after their departure,,

6
The Court agreed with the Government on this point
and several times informed Respondents to that point.

They

chose to allow them to present their evidence of jail
conditions and to wait until the end ©f the trial
to determina
>
whether evidence was in the record to support a

finding that

they had satisfied rhe return requirement.
The three Respondents and several other inmates
and several jail officials then testified'about certain
conditions in the jail.

There was testimony that trash»

sheets» mattresses and similar items were burned, soma of
the testimony suggested frequently,during the summer of 1976
prior to the escape.
QUESTIONS:

Burned by guards as well as by

inmates?
MRo RNEEDLER:

There was testimony from several

inmates that there"had bean certain things burned by
guards.

There was a description of a guard who — burning

some trash.
QUESTIONS:

I take it the Government concedes that

some of these conditions were "intolerable”?
MRo KNEEBLEB.:
QUESTION:

No, we doc.?£.

What do 3?ou concede?

MRn KNEEBLER:

Well, for purposes of the case in

this this Court, the Respondents9 evidence has to be read
in the light most favorably to them.

So to that extent

7
for purposes of this case we are considering the fasts as
presented to be true „

But we do not concede for example

that the conditions of the fires even as described presented
the type of threat of imminent serious bodily injury or
harm that the duress defense has usually been reserved, for„
QUESTION:

Well, the jury convicted these

defendants, dldn51 they?
MRo KNEEDLER:

That is right, but the — but.

after the judge had instructed them at the close of the
trial, the judge concluded that there was not evidence in
the record from which the jury could find that they had
satisfied the return requirement of duress defensa; they
had not surrendered to custody.

And therefor® he did not

give them duress instruction and directed the jury not to
consider the jail conditions.
QUESTION:

Well, then how aaa we b© sure just

what the jail conditions ware, sine® presumably the jury
was entitled to disbelieve the testimony of witnesses heard?

MRo KNEEDLER:

Well, surely, yes, that is right.

I think on the basis of the record as it comes to the
Court that there is not a jury verdict that took into account
the jail conditions.

Be again, the evidence has to be

considered in the manner presented by the Respondents.
In addition to the evidence ©f the fires,
Respondents Cooley and Bailey also presented some testimony

a
that..they war® beaten by guards during the summer and that
they were threatened with similar action.
Respondent Walker did not base his duress on
such beating but did allege that he had, and sought to
establish that he had received inadequate medical treatment
for an alleged epileptic condition.
Finally, Respondent Cooley also at one time
testified that he left on the morning of the 26th because
he had been threatened by Bailey and Walker', but he later
admitted that there was no on© outside the cell when he
left, that the threats occurred later and he didn't know
whether Bailey and Walker had actually left.
The Respondents also sought to testify about

certain actions

that happened after

they escaped,.

Respondent

Walker testified that ha made three telephone calls to the
FBI,

The agent with whom he spoke, Walker testified, assured

hi® that fee would not be harmed if he surrendered but refused
to guarantee that he would not be returned in to the
District of Columbia jail if he did surrender.
Respondent Bailey testified that he had someone
'else call the authorities but he didn't identify who that
was -and h© admitted that fee didn't make any telephone calls
himself or make any other effort to turn himself in.
Respondent Cooley's testimony on this point is
somewhat ambiguous but it can be read to suggest that certain

9
members of his family may have tried unsuccessfully to get
in touch with authorities .

And the Government did present

witnesses in an effort to rebut this testimony and had the
duress defease been presented to the jury, then this
Government evidence would have com® into play.
As I mentioned, at the close of trial the Court
denied Respondents1 request for jury instruction.

It also

instructed the jury that ©scape is & general intent crime
and in explaining that the Court stated that general intent
only requires to. do an act consciously or purposely rather
n:.-

than inadvertently.

And by this, 1 think it is fair t© say

the Court was referring, t© the act of leaving the prison.
The evidence at Respondent Cogdell!s trial showed
that

he also

left the

District

of Columbia jail on the 26th

and he was apprehended hiding in & closet in a- residence
in Hyettsville, Maryland «hot?;; a month later.

Respondent

Qogdell also offered that hie departure was compelled by
-

■ %l

prison conditions,but because he to© had not surrendered
the Court rejected hie-proffered testimony and the duress
V
defense.
The jury returned. ® verdict of guilty in both
K

!V

> /•.? •’

cases.
Thl Court of -Appeals, one judge dissenting,

v-cfe;

reversed the convictions sad remanded sous, new trials.
The Court of Appeals found two basss on which the

jury could have or should have been able to considar the
evidence of the jail conditions prior to the departure.
First, the Court of Appeals thought that this
evidence bore on the question of intent.

In the Court of

Appeals view, one© a defendant in an escape ease has
introduced evidence of what the Court would tens abnormal
conditions of confinement, there is at least a question
raised as to whether the defendant actually intended to
leave confinement as

such or whether he was really motivated

by & desire to avoid those unpleasant conditions.
Accordingly, the Court held tha: it made him
guilty of escape only if h® had the intent to avoid abnormal
conditions of confinement.

The Court also concluded that

>

Respondents' evidence of jail conditions was sufficient to
raise a jury question under the duress defense, but in doing
so the Court stated that thq; traditional rule of duress
defense, that it can be raised only where the defendant
acted out of immediate threat of serious harm should be
relaxed•in the prison escape context because the. opportunity
for a prisoner t© escape-: may not remain available, while a
substantial threat would right that into an immediate one.
Finally, the District Court of Appeals concluded
that the District Court had erred in imposing a firm return
requirement for defendant after he departed from custody.
The Court advocated that the failure of a prisoner to return

10
to custody was essentially a fact for the jury to consider
in datemining whether his continued absence might be
justified fey a possible continuation of the conditions
that led him to depart*
Government’s suggestion for rehearing em bane
was denied and the Government then petitioned for certiorari*
The Court of Appeals decision if affirmed by this
Court could have serious ramifications for the courts in
interpreting the law of escape and as a result could also
have serious consequences for the order and security of the
District of Columbia jail, the Federal penal system generally
and society at large*
Escape carries with it a substantial potential for
violence, even where the inmate himself does not intend to
resort to violence.
Escapes also, disrupt the order of the prison and
cause understandable apprehension among the public.
For these reasons and because ©scape demonstrates
contempt for the rule of law, escape has been traditionally
treated as. a serious crime.

Any effort to justify or excuse

an escape must therefore fee treated with considerable
caution.
The Court of Appeals holding that & prisoner does
not coismit an offense if he escapes to avoid certain adverse
conditions of confinement rather than confinement as such,

u
finds no support in ease law, Federal or State.

Moreover,

the Court’s distinction between what is called normal arid
son-noma], conditions of confinement is not fully articulated
in the ©pinion.
wrong.

And the basis of that distinction is not

For example, it isn't clear whether all jail

situations that this Court might find to be in violation of
the Eighth Amendment would be considered to be non-normal,
at least as traditionally determined, and therefore justify
a prisoner in escaping. '
There is also do expressed requirement m the intent
argument is formulated by the Court of Appeals that these
adverse conditions present an immediate threat to the safety
f

or health or life of the prisoner.
Therefore, the manner in which the Court of Appeals
dealt with the intent element introduces a great deal of
uncertainty and vagueness inf© the crime of escape and
causes prisoners, would cause corruption® officials and
juries and judges to speculate and guess as to what types
of conditions might excuse an escape.
Finally, the Court e£ Appeal3 treatment of the
intent element has the effect of converting an escape into
a self-help remedy by which the prisoner say seek t© avoid
the conditions of confinement that are unsatisfactory to
his rather than resorting to legal remedies.
In this ease the Respondents indisputably intended

12
to leave tb.e District of Columbia jail, whatever may have
been their motivation in doing so.

And there is no indication

that Congress intended the Government should have to prove
anything more than that in making out a prima facie case of

escape.
The Court of Appeals evident concern about the.
dilemma of a prisoner who faces truly threatening conditions
in a jail is therefore better dealt with not in the intent
element which; is part of the Government's ease in chief,
Jf

but where it has traditionally been addressed and that is
in the affirmative defense of duress.

That defense has over

the years .embodied the societal and legal judgment there are
occasions when it is inappropriate to punish a person because
his conduct was compelled by external forces.

The durasa

defense has long recognised that at least in some circumstances
a person’ cannot fairly be blamed for hi® conduct in those
situations.

The conduct ©£ one who acts under compulsion

is still criminal because all of the elements of the crime
are present, including the intent to act.

But even though

criminal, the conduct is excused for reason® of social
policy.
It is appareat however that the defense of duress
carries with it the seeds of potential disorder because it
allows a judge and jury t© excuse conduct in a particular
ease that the representatives of the people have chosen to

13
make criminal and'because it may also create an incentive
for a defendant to claim falsely that he acted under
coercion when it mil be quite difficult for the prosecution
to disprove those suggestions of coercion.
As a result, the duress defense has historically
been hedged with restrictions which stick to limit its
i

applications to situations in which the individual had no
reasonable choice but to commit the offense.

Thus the

defendant is excused only if he acted under a threat of
what he reasonably believed to be serious personal injury
or death.

And that i© aggravated circumstances in order-

society requires an individual would stand a threat rather
than break, the law.

Further, the threatened harm must be

unavoidable because if there are other legal recourses
available there is no reason to permit the individual to
resort to illegal methods.
And finally, in order to b© excused the criminal
conduct may not be of any greater magnitude ©r duration than
is reasonably necessary to avoid the threatened harm.
Duress has always been theoretically available as

a defense in a prison ©scape case.

But, the courts have

been understandably reluctant to excuse a prisoner when he
claims that his departure was compelled by circumstances ©£
confinement, because after all confinement itself is
objectionable to many people.

14
Accordingly, most courts that have considered
the issue have required the defendant to satisfy certain
prerequisites to raising a duress defense.

These are not

novel, however; they are merely adaptations ©f the general
rules that 1 have just articulated for the duress defense
generally.
Again, the prisoner must fear an imminent threat.
Second, there must be no lawful means available to the
prisoner to avoid it* such & resort to prison grievance
prison system, prison officials or the courts.
And finally, the courts have insisted that the
prisoner return to custody promptly or report to authorities
in. meaningful fashion after the departure in order to take
advantage of the defense.
QUESTION:

It is not only a threat from those

inside the prison, from people inside the prison — fellow
inmates ©r custodians — that might in some clrcumstanees
justify escape, is it?

Way back in the early 18th century

Hale talked about the hypothetical case of a prison catching
fire.
MRo KNEEDLER:

That is right.

It does not have to

Traditionally, the fir© situation

would have been dealt as part ©f a defense of necessity
which is usually thought ©f as natural forces as opposed
to —
QUESTION:

1st duress, but rather necessity.

15
MR» KNEEDLEB.;

Necessity.

The ease is discussing

these two defenses in the escape context intended to merge
them or not rather to significantly distinguish them because
in some respects duress is not an especially apt name for
the defense either».

QUESTION:

MRc KNEEDLER:

Local newspapers or to an attorney,

church, citizen groups, and that fcyp® of thing.
I would like to turn t© the return requirement for

& moment.
There are two possible way & in which the return
requirement could be explained.

Some courts have found it

useful in discussing the return requirement to characterise
escape as a continuing offense in the sense that it is not
necessarily consummated at the time the person first gains
his freedom hut it continues for as long a® he remains at

large.
Under this approach, this approach to
describing the return requirement then ~
QUESTION:

The real question Is whether there is

a requirement.
MEL RMEEDLER:
QUESTION:

That'is right; that is right.

S© j&s. are assuming there is on©?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, 1 a® explaining —

17
QUESTION;

You are giving an argument.

MEo KNEEDLER:

Yes, that is right.

The continuing offense description that I have
just given brings the return requirement into consistency
S

in the duress defense generally.

As I mentioned before,

one of the traditional elements of the duress defense is
that the individual can have engaged in the conduct for no
longer than'the threat remains outstanding.

Well, in the

situation in which a person escapes from prison unlawfully»
his departure is unlawful and his absence from custody is
unlawful.

So as long as h® remain® there is no excuse.

So as long

&&

h® remains at large he is continuing to engage

in an unlawful activity.

But once he is out of prison

he is no longer directly confronted in-the back-to-the-well-type
situation by the threats that le<l him t© depart.

And so

because the iissinent harm is no longer present and because
h© even

m&re

readily has -legal means available, then he is

no longer permitted — at that point the 'duress defense

stops excusing his continued .absence from prison.
Now, another way in- which the return requirement
may b@ -explained is

by

giving- it as a condition subsequent

that the defendant must satisfy in order t© raise the
defense.

Under this approach» as I

have mentioned the

original departure continues to be a crime but it is ©no
that can be excused, the return requirement is a condition

18
which the law attaches to the excuse in order for the
defendant to take advantage of it.
If is also important to remember that the duress
defense in criminal prosecution 1® traditionally a
fashion defense and it Is reasonable for the court to
fashion it in the escape context by resort to some common
ser.ee J

And in this particular situation I believe common

sense would suggest that Congress could not have intended
that a person who may have initially fled confinement
because of aa imminent fear of serious injury could there­
after remain free with impunity and not have to take some
measures to put himself back into custody safely.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler- it seem® to ma that in

both of your theorias, and X may have it entirely right in

my mind, but in both of .those theories you in effect are
saying that there is & sort of a second offense..

Take,

low, clearly fee has committed the crime ©£

Couldn't you prosecute

him for that escape in the alternative by saying in effect

never came back.

That is right; yes.

Several of the State courts that have considered

QUESTION: It just means that the defense isn't

21
The issue presented by these eases is whether
juries can fee trusted to find the fact® in criminal cases.
It is && short and as simple as that.
Th© zula that the Government asks fch© Court to
adopt would deprive the jury of considering relevant
facts concerning the events surrounding the departure of
a prisoner from the prison.
It is unique and affirmative defenses.

There is no problem there , is there?
Mo KQHH:

Perhaps in a civil contest there vouldn31

be any problem but in criminal contest it certainly would.
QUESTION:

You say that any evidence that a

defendant wants to offer comes In in a criminal case?
MEo KOHM:

On the affirmative sense I would say

as long as the defendant offers some evidence of duress or
coercion, then that would come in and go to the jury.
QUESTION:

Well, if the judge says, "I want to

share in share in chamber what you propose to offer in the
way of duress,” and says, ’’This isn't even some evidence,
so I. am not going to let you offer it”?
M&o K0HN:

There would he a minimum of threshold,

Your Honor, certainly if the defendant offered sero evidence
the affirmative defease would not be permitted to go to the
jury.

User© are seme minimum thresholds which the Court

really doesn't have to.deal with in this ease because the
evidence was so substantial.'

QUESTION:

But -» excuse me.

MRo KGHM:

But there are cases, and the Government

cites one in its reply in its reply brief Stata v. Cross
where the Court characterised the defensa es a prisoner's
complaint he got a common cold.

Essentially he said that

23
the conditions In the jail were cold.

And even though, they

talked about the Loverkamp test, that kind of defense
probably would be excluded even under the traditional
standard. It must mean that there has to be some immediate
threat of giving rise to a well-grounded apprehension of
serious bodily injury or death, as the traditional
standard.
QUESTION:

You don't say that the duress defense

is constitutionally required, do you?

Well, certainly it impinges on the

fact-finding function of the jury, Your Honor.

But, no,

wa would argue first before the Court has to reach any
constitutional questions that just as a matter of policy «—
QUESTION:

Well, say some State doesn't have it.

Say soma State doesn't have it and that a defendant

And h® says,' "Welly-' I think it ought to be a good

And two days later lie was arrested.

At the trial

the judge refused to let in the evidence that he had only
one month to go on his sentence.

And the Kentucky Court

of Appeals, which I believe is the highest court in the
State, reversed and said that that was very relevant evidence
for the jury to consider.
So in a case like that, if a m&n is arrested
before he has a chance to turn himself in or before he has
a chance to collect his thoughts and contact the proper
authorities, then h® is completely barred from raising the
duress defense.

And we say that is an unreasonable -ml®.

The problem here is how do you deal with someone
who has escaped from prison, an unauthorised leaving of the
prison.

.And when he is captured he will be brought bask

and he may be prosecuted for escape, and at that time h®
should be able to give an explanation for why h® left.
In most eases it perhaps could be said the jury
will not accept his testimony.

Juries are not stupid,

contrary to what appears to be the major premise of the
Government’s ease.

And the defendant will have to convince

a jury that his reasons for leaving in fact were valid and
that his staying ©u£ could he explained in some manner.
QUESTION:

Well, just

because we have rules
j

against hearsay doesn’t mean that those events think the
jury is stupid ©r insoapatent, it is just a matter ©f rule®;

28
isa’t it?.
ME0 KOHN:

I think that the base or the Government3^

case is the feeling that the juries will be duped by
prisoners who raise these defenses» that prisoners will
gat together and conspire to create stories and that somehow
the jury will not be able to sort these out.

And- I think

that the basic issue her© is whether we have confidence in
the juries and our jury system to decide what is the true
story and what is a fabrication.
And» in that connection I would point out that in
all these cases when the prisoners are captured they will be
brought: back to serve out their original sentence.

The only

issue is whether they will have an additional punishment put
©a fch.est for their unauthorized leaving.

So we are not talking:

about acquittals and we ar© not talking about turning them
loose on society.

They will be bask in prison» whatever the

ease.
QUESTION:

But they ar© acquitted for the 29 or

30 or 60 days that they are out?
MIL KQHH:

But I want to point

out that at least in this case the question of whether duress
defense should exist at all is not before the Court*

It

has not been briefed by the parties, it was never raised
bwlow5 and it would simply be inappropriate for the Court
to consider that issue on the present record*
But the trend is certainly to recognise the duress
defense in the State contest and the only issue here is
whether the defendant has to turn himself in immediately in.
order to be able to avail himself of that defense*
I also want 'to point out that even though the duress.
■i

31
defense was not available in the escape concept, the same
evidence came in under a different theory.

And you have

eases like Woodring and Jackson which the Government relied
on for the proposition that 751 creates a continuing
offense where the same evidence was received on the issue
of an offense of the defendant.

And in both those cases,

as I recall it the Court held, or the jury ms instructed
that the intent required ms $n intent to avoid confinesent.

And than, they went ahead and they considered that

evidence.
And, in both cases it mm rejected.

Woodring ha®

been out for two years I believe after leaving McNeil
Island as a result of a threat and the Court held that the
jury had ample basis on which to reject his evidence that
he did not have sufficient intent and in Chapman I believe
the defendant was out for two years and there, was a similar
result.
QUESTION:
aren't there?

There are two issues in this case,

discussed the issue® of voluntariness and intent and in
Judge Wilkey's dissent on pages 66-A through 73-A of the
Petitioner’s petition for writ of certiorari, Judge Wilkey
yr"'

discussed-'that.

And Respondent «as to «how how the majority

was id errore unsuccessfully I believe.
But what was common among the majority in the
dissent, and which I don't think there is any dispute about
between the parties in this case, an essential ©lament of
tfee offense of escape is voluntariness; and what that means
is free will, or as Judge Wilkey said., *, the beast compulsiva
at common law.

And if the defendent has evidence that shows

that h® did not have free will when he left the jail —
in other words, that he was coerced, then that evidence must
go to the jury, the factual question.

And the effect of

what the judge did in this case was to take it sway from

the jury.

‘ '
low, there is a problem with! the record'.

Judge

Wilkey suggested in his digs east that in fact all the trial

1 think it is

It is just an added reason

why the Court may want t© decide as a policy matter that

which will avoid you to read some very difficult
constitutional questions that ©re presented by this case.
QUESTION:

What are the difficult constitutional

MRo KOHN:

The difficult constitutional questions

questions?

are — well, first of all the Court would have to interpret
751 to determine whether it just stated a single offense,
which is the act of parting or m the Government suggests,
it goes further and creates a continuing offense.

The

Court will 'have to decide that.
QUESTION:

I don't see any constitutional problem.

MRo KOMN;

And if the Court agrees that the

statute does creat® e continuing offense, then the Court
will have to resolve what I think le a difficult constitutional
question ©f what does that mean for this case.

The majority

below held that even if the statute doss create a continuing
offense, the continuing offense theory was not the basis
of the prosecution in this case.

And that, in effect, you

cannot deprive the jury of considering a defense to the

for because they failed to turn themselves ia» which

I

believe, that the due process violation that the Court of

indicted for the initial departure, that that was the basis
upon which they were defending.

That was certainly th®

basis oh which the jury was instructed and that right in

they couldn’t do it because they had essentially committed

there was ample evidence that when these men left they war©

Exactly.
in which due process has brought it

to that point.

MRo KGHN:

Exactly#.

Now, I do want to make a point about the Government5&
other intent theory, the .whole specific general intent
controversy.
The Government has not foeaa consistent on their
theory since this whole matter began.

The trial judge

instructed the jury that the intent element was that they
must have acted consciously and not inadvertently.

On

44

appeal they arguedthat there wer© three levels of intent,
Consciousness and not inadvertence is the first; the second
is wrongful and the third is purpose ©r specific intent.
So they switched the, the theory it appears ss
/

though it was called the Arkansas situation.

We said that in

our briefy -that they are arguing on appeal in that the
•

it

.

.

•

standard intent of law is wrongful and the jury was
instructed that all they had to do was find consciousness
and inadvertence, then ..that was called the Arkansas situation.
Today they have gone back.

They have switched back, and

today they have argued that the proper standard of intent
is consciousness and inadvertence.
•y

••

.

*• .

Well, we think that

.£

.

•

alone would require reversal of the trial court and
affirmance of the Court of Appeal's decision on intent,
,

But just: to speak briefly to the specific intent

issue*.,, in many cases such as Woodring and Chapman even
though the courts felt that the statute might not have
covered specific intent, the juries were instructed in those
terms..

The case went to the jury and in both those cases

the jury came back with a conviction.
The whole point of the Court of Appeals attempt
here was to .clarify the law and to get away from the labels
of specific, intent: and general intent which really are
meaningless unless you try to figure out what the purpose
of the crime is, what the purpose of the offense is.

45
And the Court quite recently said, well, in the escape
V

statute what society la trying to do is punish someone who
©scapes with the intent to avoid confinement,

if he

escapes for another reason, to save his skin, essentially
it is a self-defease measure, then the matter is not what
Congress 'intended to punish.

It: is really no different than

whet Judge tfilkey described as the free will ©f these
compulsive notion of intent, that■if you ©scape because of
some form Of coercion that creates in your mind a. reasonable
apprehension -•?£ fear of death or bodily injury, then you
don’t have the requisite state of mind and perhaps you
don’t pose the same threat to society as someone who just
gets out and wants to regain his freedom and goes for
broke.

What we contended was

that the intent was an element of the crime of ©scape.

The

intent to do the act in the escape context is intent to avoid,
confinement.

Voluntariness — when a person is compelled

to d© something because of external forces, h© still intends
to do the act but fee is excused from liability for that radar
the duress defense:, under the affirmative defense of
duress.
I would also like t© point out that the Government
has not conceded in this ease that the evidence presented
constituted satisfaction of the immediacy requirement of th©
duress defense.
And, in response to Mr. Justice Stevens' question,
the Court of Appeals did find that the evidence presented to
the jury was adequate to support.
The District Court did not have occasion to rule
on that question end the Government did mot focus on it at
the trial court level because the focus was on the return
requirement.
And, finally, I would like to reiterate that the
significance of the return requirement again is not simply
that it is evidence that the prisoner’s intent when he first

4?

left the jail was I» fact t© just get free rather than to
avoid harsh conditions.

f:

The return requirement is a subsequent development
of the defense of/duress itself and there has to be adequate
i

'■

evidence presented in the record on every element of affirmative
,«r

defense in •■■order for the judge to send that defense to the
jury.
QUESTIONi

Of course if he is apprehended very

promptly after his escape, he can always testify that he
intended to return.
MR, KHEEDLER:

Well, again I think it might depend

on the type of duress to which he was subject.

If the

duress he is claiming is a threat from one inmate who had
just gone mad or something on occasion, I don’t think there
would be any particular excuse for remaining at large vary
long after that because it would be possible to Simply
climb out ©f a window or whatever the. avenue of (escape was
- y

and go around to the front door and say, so and so has —
QUESTION:

Ha might be apprehended when he was

going around the block?
MRo KNEEDLER:

Oh, right; sure; yes, exactly.

But I —
QUESTION:

He could testify he was on his way

back.
MRo KNEEDLER:

True.

48

QUESTION:

That he was ready to turn himself in.

That was the Lover c snip case.
MRo

KNEEDLER:

Sure. Exactly.

0,K.

The Government respectfully requests that the
judgment of the Court of Appeals should be'reversed. x
MRe CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen„

The ease is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2;45 o*clock p.m., the'case was
submitted,)
