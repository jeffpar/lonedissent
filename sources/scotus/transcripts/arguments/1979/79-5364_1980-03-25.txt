MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in 79~5354s Brown v. Louisiana.
Mr. Lawrence9 I think you may proceed whenever
you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. LAWRENCEs ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR, LAWRENCE:

Mr. Chief Justices and may if

please the Court:
The Issue in this case is whether to apply the
Court * s ruling In Burch v. Louisiana that a verdict of
five out of six on a bobtail jury should be applied
retroactively to this case8 and if so if any other cases
are involved* whether there should be full retroactivity
or limited retroactivity to cases pending but not yet
filed at the time that Burch was decided,
Darnell Brown was convicted in Orleans Parish
of simple burglary by five-te-one vote.

He was then

multiple-billed and sentenced to serve 22 years.
We are relying on the rule in Hankerson v.
North Carolina as the rule to apply in this case.
Similarly* we are relying on the rule in Witherspoon
and BalXatf v, Georgia* as well as Burch v. Louisiana.
QUESTION:

In which case did we define or- at

least tried to give soma guidance on retroactivity?

MR» LAWRENCE:

In Stovall v* Demo the guide-

lines came out9 the criterion to apply*

In Bailee v*

Georgia, the statistics casae out, and in Burch the fiveout-of-sis decision was made*

But in Stovall and later

with Linkletter, the Court drew on three factors:

the

purpose to be served by the new rule, the reliance on
good faith by the state authorities on the old rule, and
the effect on the administration of criminal Justice by
implementing the new rule»
In Hankerson, the Court looked to the purpose
of the new rule and that if that purpose was to enhance
the: truth of who fact-finding matter, then you need not
look to reliance and effect, and that if the purpose; was

or if it was 31 call, then you would consider the other

factors.

■

‘:]:■

t, $,

We submit here that we are in a better position
than the litigant in Hanke rs cm because we are, not confsin 3d with just an incidental enhancement of the truth
finding f--.net ion-

If you will recall in Ballew when the

statistics were mentioned, they talk about prevention of
‘type one error which is that an innocant man should hot
f-

be wrongfully convicted being weighed ten times sore
heavily than the prevention of the type two error that
a guilty person should go free*

That is the

6
So hera we are on similar ground with Hankeraon,
that the purpose of Burch is to enhance the fact-finding
process, but if the Court would look at the other factors,
such as the reliance and the effect on the administration
of Justice, you should consider th3.s, that we are talking
about really two states here, Louisiana and Oklahoma, who
have the five out of six re ^uirements.
Most of the people who were convicted flx*a of

tween 1974 and 1978 and we are not talking about people
charged with relative felonies who pled
wore convicted six to nothing.

guilty or who

Me are talking only about

five-one, so there is a relatively small number of
people that we are talking about here.
QUESTION:

Do you think that — B&ll&w was the

five-man, wasn’t it?
MR. LAWRENCE.

Yea,

Ballew said that a verdict

by five was Illegal.
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t you have argued that was

retroactive?
MR. LAWRENCE:

That Ballew was retroactive?

I'm afraid X don’t understand your question*

7
QUESTION:

What about people who before Balls»

had been convicted by five* would they be out under Ballew?
MR, LAWRENCE:

That was a unanimous group,

The

inner working of the jury was a unanimous group then,
QUESTION:

I understand,

MR, LAWRENCE:

And prior to 131U» when we tried

these cases, where we have the five-man Jury, it was a
unanimous requirement,
QUESTION:

Well, are you arguing for retroactiv­

ity back behind Ballevi?
HR. LAWRENCE:
QUESTION:

Just back to B&Xlew?

MR. LAWRENCE:
QUESTION:

Ho.

That's right.

And you

think that that would not —

Ballow was '70?
MR. LAWRENCE:

Ballew was in 978.

Burch was

in '78.
QUESTION:

So you must be arguing for retro­

activity of Ball®» then,
MR. LAWRENCE:

Well, BaXlew only had five

people on the jury.
QUESTION:

I understand.

MR. LAWRENCE:

And in this decision we are

talking about five people convicting out of six. ' And
Burch came after Ballew,

8
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. LAWRENCE:

So I would argue that* any retro­

activity — yes, I4m sorry, also Includes eases in Ballew,
yes, back to 197§.
QUESTION:

Are there any statistics as to

numbers that would fee affected?
MR, LAWRENCE:

There are not.

There :1s no

Louisiana agency that has these figurest and what I am
trying to show the Court here is that we are talking about
a 'small number of people,,

These are relative felonies,

small crimes, where the legislative has not seen fit to
give more significance to the number of people needed to
convict.
QUESTION:

Of course, there are two elements

really in the jury composition.

You say it Is the truth­

fulness of the fact-finding processs but many of our re­
cent decisions going down in numbers of jurors have
emphasised the necessity of the cross-section and that
you" have to draw an arbitrary line to preserve a right
to jury trials without ever suggesting that a bench trial
by s single judge is not an accurate truth-finding process.
MR. LAWRENCE:

Me are not talking here about

the right to a jury trial or a judge trial.
ing here about the inner workings of a jury.

We are talk­
After you

have mad© that decision, to go before a group of people

9
between the defendant and the prosecutor„

We are talking

about that and not the right to a Jury or a Judge.
Once we get into the inner working of the Jury*
the five of sis or the six of six, the unanimity require­
ment » it is a different matter.
QUESTION:

Which do you say is the better truth-

finding process, a Jury of five, which must be unanimous„
©r a Jury ©f six in which the conviction may foe had by
five out of six?
MR. LAWRENCE:

I would have to draw on ay own

prior experience before 1974 and I will foe very candid
with the Court in telling the Court that at that bima I

.favored five out of five, unanimity, but I am not. going,
to f.rgua with the requirement now of the six, but I never
favored the five out of six.

That isn’t my question.

But I certain­

ly cion51 want to argue with the requirement now of sixout-of-six, unanimity.
QUESTION:

With the six and non-unanimity you

have at least a challenger in the Jury room.
MR. LAWRENCE:
QUESTION:

If you —

Do you see some advantage to that in

the truth-finding process?
MRa LAWRENCE:

If there is an advantage to it.

than I would recall that in S&ilew they talk about the
five factors when you are dealing with a small Jury, the
lack of discussion that goes on, that the minority view­
point may not; be adhered to, and that the position of the
defense is of some detriment when you have a small Jury.
QUESTION:

Ballew was simply a line-drawing

process, wasn't it?
MR.» LAWRENCE:
QUESTION:

One line, yes, sir,

There is nothing magic about five

or six or seven except that the court concluded that
the line had to be drawn somewhere,
QUESTION:

And it had already upheld the six

line „
MR. LAWRENCE:
QUESTION:

Unanimity.

That is the only reason there was a

line drawn, is because the six-person jury had been

11
upheld•
MR, LAWRENCE:

Correct.

Mows In our situation,

our case was pending on review in the Louisiana Supreme
Court at the time Burch was decided and we raised the
Issue by motion to quash after S&ilew came out»

QUESTION:

Why do you say we are only talking

about going back to 5 7*5?
MR„ LAWRENCE:

Prior to 197^, in our state, the

statute provided for a five-man jury.
QUESTION:

So the five-out-of-six thing could

only have been happening since then?
MR. LAWRENCE:
QUESTION:

Since 197*1 through 1978.

Has the retroactivity of Ballew been

decided?
MR,. LAWRENCE:
QUESTION:

No.

Well, this on® would certainly de­

cide it, wouldn't it?
m, LAWRENCE:

QUESTION:

Yea, sir, it should.

So you are really not talking about

just back to 97*5.
MR. LAWRENCE:

As I understand it, if there

are other states who have —
QUESTION:

Well, you are at least talking about

it in Louisiana and Oklahoma.

You are talking about any­

body who is still in jail who has been convicted by

MR, LAWRENCE:
QUESTION:

If they are still In Jail.

Mr, Lawrence, do you knew what the-

maximum sentence that could have been imposed for con­
viction by a five-man Jury?

rather minor offenses?

the other parishes, probably not.
QUESTION:

White’s question, is it likely that there are quite a few
people in Jail?
a multiple bill.

Your answer was if they were subject to
I think what ha is asking is were there

very many subjected to multiple bills, as you call them.
MR, LAWRENCE:

Let me explain it this way.

In

1971' » there was a new policy for multiple billing that
came into effect and after that there web a denial of
good time that earn® into effect, and I believe in 197? ~~
\

now., the people sentenced before that got the 'benefit of
good time and probably are- not in jail, people from, say,
’77 on are likely to be in jail under multiple bill.
QUESTION:

Even someone who was sentenced to

22 years in 3,976 might be cut
MR, LAWRENCE:

now?

If they were multiple billed in

14
1976 —
QUESTION:

1976»

MR. LAWRENCE:

— say *?6 or back to 1974, dur­

ing that period of time* their good time would not be
affected by the multiple billing and whatever their sen­
tence would foe from zero — from a third of the maximuma
which would foe three years# which most of them received,
three to the maximum of 3.8 on a multiple bill at that
time, they would be out ©f jail*

If they received the

heavy end of the sentence on & multiple bill, they may
still be there, but again this applies to Orleans Parish
and not to most of the other parishes in the state.
QUESTION:

What Is the population of" Orleans

MR. LAWRENCE:
QUESTION;

Over a million?

MR. LAWRENCE:
QUESTION:

i by the Chief Justice.

Over a million.

Over a million.

That Is by practice.

suggested —
MR. LAWRENCE:

You have the wild card but I

would like to Just draw my own experience when i tried
eases at that time.

I feel that a unanimous verdict is

always preferable but if you limit ms to five of five or
five out of six — and I would for the sake of this argu­
ment say I would prefer to have five out of six, but
sines w® are dealing here with the new rule in Burch that
has thrown this out and require six of six. then I would
of course feel that six of six is much better because- it
is unanimous and does not have a wild card*
QUESTION:

Do you respond that way because you

see some advantage in having a challenger in the jury
room who is in effect going to make the other five Jurors

MR. LAWRENCE:

I have only to say that I would ask the Court,,
if there are no more questions* to reverse the holding of
the state supreme court and to apply retroactively —~
QUESTION:

Let ms ask one other question.

This

not yet become final. —~
MR. LAWRENCE:
QUESTION:

That * g correct.

—* by the time Burch was decided.

Do you happen to know if there are proceedings attacking

that, yes.

ence with correspondence with people who have been con■

f

victed and are in the parish prison at this time, yes.

to your answer.

I didn’t really need an embellishment

I didn’t hear your answer.

MR, LAWRENCE:
those are under way, yes

I’m sorry,

I would say that

18
QUESTION:

You are aware that that is going on.

MR* LAWRENCE:

Yes*

QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Could I ask you, in the state’s' brief*

on page 2?s it says in the ease of an habifeural felon* a
conviction by a six-man jury can ultimately result in the
sentence of life imprisonment.
MR, LAWRENCE:

That is if he has four felony

convictions.
QUESTION;

Anyway, It can happen?

MR, LAWRENCE:

QUESTION:

From 20 to life.

Well, it- can happen then that he

could have a sentence for life and be convicted by five
out Of* 3ix?
MR, LAWRENCE:

Yes* that’s correct.

That to

my knowledge has not happened.
QUESTION:

How do you tell when a verdict has

been unanimous on the six-man jury?
MR. LAWRENCE:

At the end of the trial you ask

for a poll of the verdict,
QUESTION:

What if the poll wasn’t taken?

MR. LAWRENCE:

They take it in open court right

at the end of the trial.
QUESTION:

It isn’t required* is it?

MR. LAWRENCE:

It is not required.

It sometimes

19
doss not go into the court records.
QUESTION:

So how do you ever know?

MR, LAWRENCE:
QUESTION:

W© donate

Wo ask the Jury.

I know, but once the trial is over

how would you ever know?
MR4 LAWRENCE:

If there is no poll taken, you

would not know.
QUESTION:

In some instances, if there is a poll

taken, I take it It doesn’t necessarily show up on the
court minutes.
MR, LAWRENCE:

It may be recorded by the steno­

grapher but It is not usually made part of the record.
It- can be, but usually the poll is taken, the number is
given and that is it, there is no further action on it.
QUESTION:

Do you in your defender practice

routinely ask for a poll?
MR., LAWRENCE:

Yes, unless I have the advantage

and then 1 don’t.
QUESTION:

Do most defense lawyers do that?

MR. LAWRENCE:

Yes, as a matter of practice

they do, in any of the verdicts they do, whether It Is
five out of six or twelve out of twelve.
QUESTION:

When there is an acquittal, is there

a poll?
MR. LAWRENCE:

I would never ask for one.

20
QUESTION:

I know you wouldn't, but Is there one?

MR. LAWRENCE:

Sometimes the state does* yes.

Thank you.

Mr. Chester.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS CHESTER, ESQ.,
FRO HAG VIC!?
MR, CHESTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The respondent, state of Louisiana would suggest
to the Court that Burch v. Louisiana should be applied
prospectively only, for three- reasons:
First Is that petitioner Darnell Brown has
failed to establish that serious and substantial doubts
exist as to the accuracy of non-unanlnous verdicts before
the time of Burch.
Second, the state ©f Louisiana conducted numer­
ous jury trials before this Court ruled in Burch In goodfaith reliance on what the law was earlier.
Ansi third, the contrary ruling would have a
seriously disruptive impact on the administration of
justice in Louisiana.
QUESTION;

Well, don’t you at least think that

ft*

Ballew heralded. Burch?
MR, CHESTER:

No, I don’t, Your Honor.

state’s position is this:

The

First of all, in Burch, there

21
was
QUESTION:

There wouldn't sake much differences

would it?
MIL CHESTER:

No, sir,

I believe that the

relevant test could be applied to these two cases and
differing results could —■
QUESTION:

But they weren’t far apart.

MR, CHESTER:
QUESTION:

I believe there are differences.

But how far apart were they In time?

MR. CHESTER:

About a year.

I believe Ballew

was decided in *78 and Burch was decided in ’79.

QUESTION:

So in terms of Impact on justice,

even if Burch were retroactive back to Ballew, it
wouldn’t make that much difference.

MR„ CHESTER:

If Eurch were retroactive back

to Ballew?
QUESTION;

Yea.

MR. CHESTER:

I believe there would hs a sub­

stantial number of jury trials having been tried in the
Interim periodi, approximately one year.
The Court asked Mr. Lawrence how many persons
would be affected.

The Orleans Parish District Attorney's

i

office in the four years that ncn~unanimous jury verdicts
were law, we tried approximately 300 cases.

This is

just for the City of New Orleans 9 not counting the other

22
parishes*
QUESTION:

Would you be able to estimate how

many of those were non-unanimous?
MR, CHESTER:

In no way, Yout Honor.

I imagine

you could go back to each particular record and look and
see if a poll lied been requested.

If a poll had besa

requested, whether the verdict or the count had been re­
corded .
1

As the state pointed out in its brief, it has

been the practice of some judges to merely examine the
ballots that the individual jurors fill out and then an­
nounce for the record whether or not the verdict is
lawfulo
QUESTION:

And no numbers at all?

MR, CHESTER:

Mot necessarily, Your Honor, not

necessarily*
QUESTION:

What w® are talking about then is

300 cases minus an unknown number of unanimous eases and
again minus an unknown number of eases which the record
is unclear.
MR. CHESTER:

Yes, sir, for Orleans Parish

alone, not for the entire state of Louisiana.
QUESTION:

I gather from your point — maybe I

didn’t get it right — that that is probably where the
problem is most likely to occur, is that right?

There

are more trials vising this particular procedure, or is
that wrong?
MB* CHESTER:

1 believe the procedure would

hare been the same all through til© state,
QUESTION:

2 see,

MR* CHESTER;

The Parish of Orleans does have

a disproportionate amount of j ury trials because it has
much more serious crime problems than some of the otherparishes do,
QUESTION:

What is the population of the state

of Louisiana?
MR. CHESTER:

Your Honor, I am not sure but I

know that the population of the city of New Orleans is
about one-half million,
QUESTION:

Do you have any idea of the popula­

tion of the state as a whole?
MR, CHESTER:

Three, four million?

I think what Your Honor is get­

ting at is about what proportion of jury trials in the
state were held in New Orleans*

I would say that it

would be roughly a third to a quarter,
QUESTION:

What I was getting at was what the

population of the stats of Louisiana is,
MR, CHESTER:

Yes, sir, ' From talking with

people in the Department of Corrections, I understand
that; about a third to a quarter of their inmates come

24
from New Orleans.
QUESTION:

If you would back up for just a

minute8 about the other people row la jail who laighfc he
affected.
MR. CHESTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir-.

Do 1 understand you to say that

practically none of them car:, show that there was s *»MR. CHESTER:

I don’t know if that that would

be a correct statement of the situationa Your Honor.
However, I believe there would be a substantial number
who’ could not show.
QUESTIO!:

So there wouldn’t bo many who could

show.
MR. CHESTER:
QUESTION:

That is what 1 thought.

MR* CHESTER:
QUESTION:

There would be some .but not all.

Now —

All of your friend’s clients would

be in the other category because he polls the jury on

In this case

26
The gist of what petitioner argues therefore is
that In a substantial number of cases there must b@ error
to Justify wholesale and a windfall reversal of prior
convictions, a substantial number ©f prior eonviefcioas.
The state concedes that there is no question
that the Sixth Amendment that was the subject of Burch
v* Louisiana pertains to what has been called the fact­
finding process bp this Courts but we submit also that
it is well settled that the mere fact that the Sixth
Amendment or the fact-finding process is involved in a
particular ruling does not mandate automatic retroactivity.
Sines it would be improper and Impossible to
review all of the convictions and the records of all the
convictionsB we have to look at this issue in general
terms from what the Jurisprudence has taught us about
the Jury trial and its functions*
r;

_.

The purpose of the Jury trial is to prevent
government oppression.

The main feature of the Jury
1

trial is an interposition between the accused and the
accuser, of what this Court has called the common sense
deliberations of a group of laymen®

The Court has

further ruled that this interposition can operate If
the Jury can deliberate effectively and if it fairly
represents a cross-section of the community from which
it has been taken»

2?
Many of these features are functions of the ab­
solute sisse of the jury rather than the composition of
the final ballot»

For example, it ha» been established

that by empaneling sis jurors, the cross-section require­
ment is satisfied.

And 1 believe the Court has rejected,

the argument that the fact that a member of the minority
group is ultimately out-voted dess not indicate that his
position was not or the position of the minority was not
adequately represented during the jury deliberations*
The Court .in Ballew expressed some concern
about the collect ve memory of the jury, and I think it
has been further established that when six persons are
empaneled they are able when they go back to that de­
liberation room to rehesaber all the facts and arguments
that'were important in the trial of the ease.
Also the state would suggest that it can't: be
said that a lay body has failed to interpose it self between accused and accuser, whether the final verdict is
unanimous or non-unanimous.
Reading Burch together with this Courtfs prior
decisions suggests that, while unanimous jury verdicts
may indicate that

more perfect deliberation processes

occur, that the extent to which non-un&nimous jury ver­
dicts infect the- integrity cf the fact-finding process
ranks low on the scale of probabilities.

28
The language of the Burch decision supports
this®

The majority opinion of Mr* Justice Rehnquist at

several points noted, that the ease ms a close one3 hut

'went on to state that it was necessary to draw lines,
that demarcation linos had to he drawn at some point if
the substance of the trial ras to be preserved*
Ths State of Louisiana owuld liken the rule
of Burch to the rule of Callahan v, Parker as inter-»
preted in Goss v. Haydens and that is that it is a
prophylactic rule that only incidentally enhances' the
reliability of the fact-finding process®

MB. CHESTER:

No, air, I don’t.

Burch was more of a line-drawing decision,,

I believe
I think that

soma of the features of the jury trial are more perfectly
represented In a nan-unanimous six-member jury than
there are in a five-member jury.

Those are particularly

cross-section of the community, the jury’s ability to
remember, and certain other facts.
QUESTION:

But you don’t feel that the ille­

gality In Bureh of a five-out-of-six verdict rested on
the danger of unreliability?
ME. CHESTER:

I belle7/© that that was a factor

in the case, but I believe —
QUESTION:

MR. CHESTER:

I believe it was a factor In the

30
ease, but i don't believe that was the reason for the whole
decision*

I believe there was a line-drawing decision and

I think that that was noted in the opinion several times*
The state would further submit that the Court’s
ruling in DeSfcefano v. Moods .and Gos& v* M&yden are dis­
positive of the issue before the Court*

In both of these

cases, the Court denied retroactive application to cases
where jury trials had been denied outright» where the
purpose of the Sixth Amendment as it relates to trial had
been frustrated entirely*
QUESTION:

DeStef&no v. Woods and Duncan v*

decisions „ the ultimate ruling should be that they eraprospective only*
However, I think that the case is stronger in
Burch for prospective application than it is in B&llew.
I believe that Burch wae not as grounded in fairness as
Ballew was»

I believe Burch had other justifications and

other reasons for the Burch decision.
QUESTION:

On the other hand, Mr. Chester, in

the Ballew-type case the proof would be very simple, we
■

would know -« I .guess everybody who was convicted 'there
has' a claim, v here&s in the Biareh-typs case a large per­
centage may not have a claim.
HR. CHESTER:

So that raay argue for making it the

other way»
HR, CHESTER:
QUESTION:

It could be both ways,

Yes.

MR» CHESTER:

Mow.* as I spoke earlier, ©nee we

have established that the rule with which we are dealing

32
is not so grounded in fundamental fairness as is, say, the
right to counsel or reasonable doubt, like in Hankerson
va North Carolina, then it becomes appropriate to apply
countervailing factors to the analysis, factors that
were first safe out in Linkletber, later in Stovall and
those ea.ees proginy *
As to the reliance of the state of Louisiana,
the role of an inquiry before the court is should the
state- be charged with having anticipated the Court's
ruling In Burch, and the state would submit that it
should not.
First, we are dealing with an institution which
waa provided for by the Louisiana Constitution.

Normally, the constitutions of the states are

presumed to have some validity.
The jurisprudence of this Court, as I said
earlier, has seemed to examine the composition of the jury
question in terms of absolute number rather than in terms
of the final vote.
The issue involved in Burch had not raised long
and: widespread attacks in the lower courts as did the
Court's Firth Amendment decision In Bruton which was made
retroactive by Roberts v. Russell.
Further, I don * t believe that any of the Court's

or preordained as had been the confrontation clause rule
of Barber v, Fag© by this Court9s previous d@e5.sion in

QUESTION;

Before this system you had, what,

'six-member Juries unanimous or five-member Juries?
MR. CHESTER:

Before 1975, it was five out of

five to convict for felonies which were not necessarily
punishable by hard labor.
QUESTION:
invalid in Ballew?

And that is precisely what was held

3M
MR. CHESTER:
QUESTION:

Exactly, Your Honor.

Ballew v. Georgia.

MR. CHESTER:

The difference being that in

Georgia I believe that the maximum sentence for a five
out of five conviction in Georgia was one year whereas in
Louisiana it would have been nine, possibly being enhanced,
by the multiple offender statute.

Prior to 1975 and after

1975» potentially a man that had prior felony convictions,
as had petitioner Darnell Brown, could possibly he sentenced!
up to life imprisonment.
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't you think that if

Burch would have to be retroactive a fortiori, that Ballew
would be?
MR. CHESTER:

Yes, sir.

I believe that Burch is

a stronger case for prospective application than Ballew is.
QUESTION:

And Louisiana had the unanimous five-

member jury for a long time, did it?
MR. CHESTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, the 1921 Constitution.

It was in the 1921 Constitution.

MR. CHESTER:

Yes, sir.

I'm not sure what type

of jury was before that.
QUESTION:

You have no figures nor any idea how

many people might still be in jail who were convicted by
five -member juries prior to 1975?
MR. CHESTER:

I don't know how many of those

35
people would still fee in jail, Your Honor.,

I know between

'JH and ’75 the Department of Corrections estimates that
there are about 2.000 people currently in jail who were
either convicted, pled guilty or convicted by a judge or
a jury or who pled guilty,

to you are talking about 2,000

people who were convicted —
QUEST3‘.ON:

If you just took 80 percent — you

reall3? get the guilty pleas Srs 80 to 85 percent of the
cases, don’t you?
MR. CHESTER;

I would say we have guilty pleas

in more than half of the cases.

But what is important to

note is that the people who would bo most affected would
be people with the longest and most serious criminal
records.

Those are the men who usually clo go to trial

because they are facing too much time to plead guilty.
QUESTION:

What is the Louisiana system for

multiple billing, as your opponent has been referring to
it.

Is it something that has to be alleged in the *— is

it an indictment that you proceed by or —
MR. CHESTER:

We proceed with a bill of informa­

tion after a man has bean convicted or pled

guilty to a

felony, we proceed by filing a bill of information
alleging that he has been previously convicted of one or
more felonies within a statutory time period.

Generally

speaking, it is five years from the time of his last

36
conviction.
QUESTION:

Then that is an allegation in the

bill that can be put in issue by a not guilty plea* I take
it?
MR. CHESTER:

It is put in issue —~ what happens

is it is —
QUESTION:

It is after conviction?

MR. CHESTER:

It is after conviction.

The jury

doesn’t know about the man’s prior record.
QUESTION:

This is only for sentencing then?

MR. CHESTER:

Yes, and it is tried before a

judge.
QUESTION:

How, would retroactivity here sub­

ject a person who was convicted by a unanimous six-man
jury, would it give him the right to attack a prior con­
viction, say} back to 1921?
MR, CHESTER:
the retroactive ruling.

It would depend on the scope of
I believe it would.

That would

be a matter I guess for the Louisiana Supreme Court and
my opinion would be yes, it would.
QUESTION:

Conceivably this Court, too.

MR. CHESTER:

Yes, sir.
\

\
QUESTION:

Whether or not there is to be multiple

billing is in the discretion of the prosecutor?
MR,. CHESTER:

Discretion of the district, attorney.

\

\

37
I believe Mr. Lawrence spoke about since 1974 there have
been more multiple bills riled, that Is because a new
district attorney caaae into office in ?74.

So Louisiana

has had the multiple sentence statute sine® the early
1900*s.
QUESTION:

It Is a matter of prosecutorial

policy?
MR. CHESTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Then that can be denied and that is

tried before the sentencing judge?
MR. CHESTER:

Yes, sir.

There are certain

technical requisites of proof that require the state to
prove up the prior convictions.
Non, as the Court has recognized, a retroactive
application of this case could have --- could yield wind­
fall benefits to a certain number of people who are in
jail.

Ironically, the retrial of a case now may well

result in a verdict which is less reliable than was the
original trial held before the Court’s decision in Burch.
That; Is when a ease can be brought back to trial.
Inevitably, the passage of time will destroy
the state’s chances for bringing a lot of these cases
back to trial.

How many, you can’t tell, but again what

is Important Is that those persona who would, be moatlikely to be unretriable would be those persons whose

38
cases were the stalest, that is, people with the most
serious criminal records who were sentenced to the longest
terns a good number of years back.
Mro Lawrence initially also brought up in his
argument a distinction between retroactivity on direct
review and on collateral reviews and 1 would like to
answer that briefly.

I think that first that the juris­

prudence of the court- has established that that distinc­
tion is without merit back to Tehan and ex rel. Shotfc
soon after the first non-retroactivity decision in
Linkletter.

That distinction was rejected then*

I believe that the- countervailing factors
which spoke about earlier in connection with the Stovall
decision don? t admit any distinction between cases on
direct review and cases on collateral review.
QUESTION:
Chester?

What was the chronology here, Mr.

At the time he was tried, Burch had not been

decided.
MR. CHESTER:

Had not come out, Your Honor.

What happened —
QUESTION:

And of course it hadnft been decided

at the time he committed the offense.
MR. CHESTER:

Yes, sir.

There was a trial;

nine months later Burch was decided.

He appealed and a

month after the Burch decision the Louisiana Supremo

39
Court affirmed Darnell Brown’s case, holding that Burch
7« Louisiana was not retroactive.
QUESTION:

Which had not been decided in the

meantime.
MR, CHESTER:

Petitioner Brown would be on

direct review,
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. CHESTER:

Additionally, I would submit that

I think that the impetus behind the argument for this
distinction is basically one of inequity.

It is dissatis­

faction with what the Court has previously termed chance
beneficiary.

In other words, why should one man benefit

fro3i the Court's decision when another nan similarly
situated does not.
I would suggest that drawing a distinction be­
tween cases on collateral review and cases on direct re­
view merely exchanges one inequity for the other, with
the side effect of having just that many more convictions
reversed for- reasons other than unfairness in the original
trial.
QUESTION:

Was your earlier reference to the

inherent inequity related to the inability to show that
a polling took place of the jury?
MR. CHESTER:
general terms

No, sir, this would be in more

QUESTION:

Wouldn’t that be another1 basis for

MR. CHESTER:

It certainly would0

Some persons

who in fact may have been convicted by non-unanimous
juries may not be able to prove that.
QUESTION:

And maybe they never knew it.

MR. CHESTER:
QUESTION:

Exactly* maybe -—

Counsel didn’t take the precautions

that your friend did.
ME. CHESTER:

That is perfectly correct. Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

In Louisiana, can you establish such

a factor by some collateral process?
MR. CHESTER:

Weil, there is a rule in the Code

of Criminal Procedure which says that jurors are incompe­
tent to Impeach their own verdicts.

Now, whether that

would prevent a situation where.a defendant could recall
members of the jury to testify as to what their particular
ballot was In & case, I am not sure.
QUESTION:

Well, that would be impeaching it0

MR. CHESTER:
in that are widespread.
QUESTION:

The practical problems inherent
First of all —

To call back jurors of five or six

years ago and ask them whether or not a particular ver­
dict was, in the words of the usual polling language.

4l
was this your verdict —
MR. CHESTER:

Exactly,. Your Honor.

It would be

analogous to the situation of trying to rediscover state
witnesses in & case that was five or six or seven years
old.

Some of the witnesses or Jurors may be dead or may

have moved.

They may have forgotten what their vote was.

The practical problems, sir, are overwhelming in that
type of situation.
In summary, I point out to the Court that there
has been no showing that a substantial number of these
verdicts were wrongly decided or were unfair»

The state

of Louisiana relied on the law as it stood before the
Court’s decision in Burch, as it was set out in the dTH
Constitution, and finally if retroactivity were found in
the,case before the bar it would have & seriously dis­
ruptive impact on Louisiana’s criminal laws.

It would

be time-consuming, it would be expensive, and it would
yi«3.d unfair results.
QUESTION:

Mr. Chester, I notice at the time

that you wrote your brief you didn’t have the citation
to the U.8. reports in Burch v. Louisiana.
MR. CHESTER:
QUESTION:

Do you have it now?

MR. CHESTER:
Thank you.

No, sir, I did not.

Not with me. Your Honor.

What about the point we were just discussing with your

Isn’t it Just a matter of lottery and chance

as to which ones would get the benefit of a retroactive
