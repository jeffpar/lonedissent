P ROCEEDINGS

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 79-97, California Retail Liquor Dealers Association
v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.
Mr. Chidlaw, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM T. CHIDLAW, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CHIDLAW:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The case we have before us now involves the
state’s power to regulate liquor within a state's borders
as opposed to the commerce clause and specifically a
statute enacted under the commerce clause, namely the
Sherman Act.
In this particular case, the State of California
has an extensive comprehensive Alcoholic Control Act which
%

includes within its provisions two that are specifically
involved in this case dealing with wine, and those two
sections require that the price at which wine will be sold
from wholesale to retail be posted with the department and
the other section requires that the wine be sold at a price
no lower than that price typically.
The case involves the setting of those prices.
Specifically, this case involves wholesale to retail, those

<

4
were the facts of this case- but the statute involves both
at wholesale to retail price and a retail to consumer orice
for wine in California, be set generally by the wine pro­
ducer.

That is a third party.
The problem that we have and the reason we are

nere today is because the California Supreme Court, in a
case that was decided anoroximagelv a vear before the instant
case, ruled that the reauirament that the manufacturers of
distilled spirits set the price from retailer to consumer
was inyalid, as being in conflict with the Sherman Act.
And in this case our Court of Anoeals said that it was bound
to follow that California Supreme Court case and aonlv it
not only at the retailer to consumer for wine level but
also at the wholesale to retail level* in other words ex­
tending that case somewhat, on the basis primarily that
there was no difference in our Court of Appeals mind between
a manufacturer setting the price from retail to consumer and
a manufacturer setting the price from wholesale to retail.
We think there are soma differences between that
as to the basis and purpose of the statuta; however, I
think -- and those are covered i:i our brief — I don’t
think that, in view of the situation and the issue involved
in this case, that that necessarily needs to be discussed
at oral argument.
The Court of Appeals declared both those statutes

5

to be invalid following the Rice case.

Now, the Rice case

by our California Supreme Court evolved or the court evolved
a new test.

We find this test in no other cases either in

California or in any cases of this Court.

And what the

court did in that case, the California Supreme Court did,
was to take various cases by this Court in which state regu­
lation of liquor had been involved but which had involved
provisions of the Constitution other than the commerce
clause; for instance, the First Amendment like in LaRue, or
the Fourteenth Amendment like in Wisconsin v. Constantineau,
which was a due process case.
QUESTION:

The Rice case was not brought here for

review, was it?
MR. CHIDLAW:

No, it was not.

There was no writ

filed in the Rice case.
QUESTION:

And the Court prevail here, what hap­

pens to the Rice case?
MR. CHIDLAW:

Well, I would think that if we pre­

vail here, that this Court in order to eliminata the uncer­
tainty and confusion caused by that case would overrule the
Rice case.

We're asking you to reverse the case that’s

specifically before you, but to overrule the Rice case and
eliminate its effect.

We have — not "we", but there is a

case pending before the Court of Appeal in New York today
which was argued a waek ago Monday which involves the Fair

6
trade wine retail to consumer in New York,

The Castlewood

case, there are implications in that case, which was a case
in which the federal regulations under the, from the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms ran head-on into a state
statute from Florida in which there was a conflict about
what discounts were proper.

That case is, I understand the

time for filing with this Court has not yet expired, and there
is a suggestion in a footnote from Respondent Midcal that that
case may be on its way here.
In Kansas, this past session enacted a new regula­
tory scheme for alcoholic beverages where they abandoned the
idea that administratively they would set the prices for
licruor in Kansas and instead adopted a minimum markup statuta
whexe in effect, the outsider, the private, the third party
or whoever sets the price or the cost, and then the state
simply ,says what percentage the retailer will add to that
price.

Thera are other aspects of the Kansas law that also

would .be, I think, deemed to involve anti-competitive: situa­
tions. ' So there are a number of cases around the covntrv that
are involved in the same basic problem that the Rice case has
created, this balancing of the interest test.
QUESTION:

Mr. Chidlaw, in response to Justice

Blackmun's question, you said vou thought we should overrule
the Rice case, which as I understand it is a California case.,
I am reminded of what I think is the statement of Mr. Justice

7
Brandeis in one of the opinions of this Court that ail this
Court can do in its order, if it reverses a state supreme
court or a state appellate court is to say that it’s reversed
for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.,

That

doesn't mean that the reasoning of the opinion couldn't cast
doubt on the Rice case.

But surely we couldn't say in the

opinion that the Rice case is overruled.

That53 a matter of

state law.
MR. CHXDLAW:

Wall, I would, presume -- I think your

point is well taken, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

I would presume

that if and when this Court rules that our position on the
relative importance of the two constitutional provisions, if
they were correct on that, that the California Supreme Court
would follow the decision of this Court.
I don’t think this Court can avoid ruling on the
question that was the basis of the Rice case, and I would
presume that the California- Supreme Court would follow this
Court's decision.

So 1 don't think it would be an idle act

on those matters.
,And on the Specific case, I don't think there would
be any problem at all.

I think chat we’ve covered in our

briefs, this Court has explored this, the difference between
a. state statute that's regulating liquor when it conflicts
with the commerce clause, and always upheld that, and this
Court has discussed the Fourteenth Amendment and due process™

8
equal protection exceptions to that.

This Court has discussed

over and over again the federal enclave exception, where the
goods are intended for federal enclave and foreign commerce,
like in Hostetter v. Idlewiid.

So I think that there's no

question that the balancing of interest test that was evolved
by the California Supreme Court is simply based on an erroneous
interpretation of those exception cases that did not involve
the commerce clause running head-on into regulation of liquor
within a state.
Now, it's been suggested by both Midcal and the
Solicitor General in its brief that if we give to the
Twenty-first Amendment, that which 1 believe this Court has
always given it, as far as the state's power is concerned,
that allows the state to, in the name of regulating liquor,
to regulate the hours of employment and securities require­
ments, and they've conjured up a situation which would in­
volve all kinds of conflicts with other federal laws.

And

X think the simple answer to that contention is that the
state has to be regulating liquor.

If the state is trying

to-regulate securities in the name of liquor or the wages
and hours in the name of liquor, or even freedom of speech,
for instance in LaRue, where there was no, if there is no
connection with the regulating liquor, I think that in those
cases clearly the state has the power.
QUESTION?

Well, Mr. Chidlattf, just to pursue that

9

for a second, supposing they passed a statute that said the
wages of a driver of a vehicle transporting liquor from place
to place within the state shall be such as is posted by
whatever company engaged in the driving business, sort of
like this, when you post a price for the wholesale and then
everybody has to follow it.

Why couldn't they do the same

thing, regulate wages the same wav, let either the union or
tha employer do the posting.

They make the legislative

choice, and then have that prevail over the National Labor
Relations Act.
MR. CHIDLAW:

I can't conceive of any legitimate

state purpose in regulating liquor that would also deal with
the regulating of tha wages for a driver ~~
QUESTION:

Well, they want to be sure that the

people who drive are adequately paid, or not overpaid, just
as — what is the state interest at stake here?
MR. CHIDLAW:

Well, in the wholesale to retail, the

state interest is in preventing discrimination among similarly
situated retailers, for instance.

We have this price posted,

everyone knows what that price is, and they're required to sell
at that price so there can't be any discrimination among re­
tailers by the wholesalers.
QUESTION:

A Robinson-Patman type —■

Why wouldn't there be state interest in

having all people who drive large -trucks containing liquor
ba paid the same amount?

10

MR. CRTDLAW:

I can't conceive of any legitimate

state purpose in doing that, because the Twenty-first Amendment
was designed, in my opinion, and I think the cases support this,
to allow a state to regulate liquor within its borders.

And

I think —QUESTION:

Some drivers are paid a lot more than

others, why, the people that they deliver to have a higher
cost of paying for the transportation, and the same kind of
economic discrimination that you can have if different prices
are charged.
MR. CHIDLAW:

That's —- I think there are justifi­

cations for the statute hare that are historic, traditional,
and do have a relation to regulating liquor.

And I don't see

any justification for regulating in these other areas.
QUESTION:

Aren't there ®ther state statutes, the

Cartwright Act and some of the others, that prohibit price
discrimination, as in California?
MR. CHIDLAW:

There are.

There's an Unfair

Practices Act that prohibits that? there are

t her California

Supreme Court has observed, however, that's verv difficult
to prove, violations of that, and therefore our California
Supreme Court in the past has said that one of the purposes
of these acts is to make proof easy in these types of situa­
tions .
I think that the California Supreme Court in using

11
words like, in picking up words that this Court's used like
pro tanta repeal, and each considered in the light of the
other, referring to the two constitutional provisions, I
think they have gotten off the track in that regard.

I think

the important phrases to look at when you are examining the
state statutes under the Twenty-first Amendment are phrases
that have been used by this Court, like unfettered by the com­
merce clause, and 1 think that, I think Justice Frankfurter * s
the one that said tha rules of the state and federal govern­
ment were reversed in the field of liquor regulation, as far
as the commerce clause is concerned.
This Court has said as recently as LaRue that the
states are totally unconfined by traditional commarce clause
limitations.
I'd like to go from those remarks into what has now
been raised for the first time in this case, and that is the
idea that the Twenty-first Amendment, because of the language
used and because of some quotations from some of the legisla­
tive history, simply allows a state to either prohibit or
restrict imports, and I think jumping ahead, I think the
answer to that contention is that this Court has neve?:' so
held, but more importantly is, if that were the only thing
that the Twenty-first Amendment did, if that was the only
power that that gave to the states, then the states

that

would constitute a freezing of the Twenty-first Amendment

12

concept in 1933.
In other words, in 1933 the commerce clause had not
been ruled by this Court to extend to the far reaches that it
has today, and at that time when they were discussing the
Twenty-first Amendment, everyone knew the state had the
power to regulate commerce generally, once it had gottan be­
yond this interstate commerce, as interpreted then, that con­
cept.
So therefore to have specifisd specifically that
a state has the power to regulate liquor within its borders
and say it in more specific language than they had would have
been surplusage.
If we were to go back to the Sherman Act in 1890
as one of the Justicss — and forgive me, I don’t remember
which one, but in either a concurring opinion or a dissent
pointed out that in 1890 when the Sherman Act was being de­
bated, there was a lot cf language used on the floor of
Congress indicating the Sherman Act was not intended to ex­
tend into the state’s borders, and indeed it didn't until
the Thirties, the middle Thirties.

So what counsel is con­

tending for with this argument about in effect wet-dry, the
state simply has a right to remain dry and/or prohibit im­
ports, is to freeze the Twenty-first Amendment * s effect and
allow the commerce clause effect to go right on up to date.
And I would suggest to this Court, as I think I

13

have in the brief, that unfettered by the commerce clause
means unfettered by the commerce clause as it exists today,
not as it existed in 1933.
QUESTION;

You would suggest that the stata could

just have a statuta that authorized price fixing generally,
if people wanted to engage in it?
MR. CHIDLAW:
QUESTION:

Just say that —

MR. CHIDLAW:
QUESTION:

Well —

— public policy in liquor —

A state statute 'that says price fixing

of any kind in the liquor business will not be illegal.
MR. CHIDLAW:

That one troubles me just a lit tits

bit.
QUESTION:

Well, why'?

Then they say pursuant to

our •—
MR. CHIDLAW:
QUESTION:

My answer :—

— power under the Twenty-first Amendment?

MR. CHIDLAW:

My answer to you specifically would be

yes, I think the state would have that power to do that, but
I would follow that up with the idea that no state has ever
done that, to my knowledge, no state has ever authorized
horizontal price fixing.
QUESTION;

Well, it could, though, in your view?

MR. CHIDLAW:
case.

Well, I think it did in the Parker

14
QUESTION;

You certainly say that a manufacturer can

set a standard price for all retailers?
MR. CHIDLAW:

That's correct.

And I do believe

that under the Twenty-first Amendment the state does have
the power to do that.

I think that they would, the state, be­

cause of the combination of out-of-state manufacturers and in­
state manufacturers, the state might well have some extra­
territorial effects with such a statute.

And there might be

other reasons, equal protection considerations would coma
into play, and I think that althoug-h the state would have
the basic power in some cases to do that, I think there*d be
some problems with it in connection with these other areas.
QUESTION:

Well, there was certainly extraterri­

torial effects in Parker v. Brown, too.

The raisin crop

was shipped out of state.
MR. CHIDLAW:
QUESTION:

Yes, there certainly were.

I don’t see why you hfssifcate on Mr.

Justice White’s question, because it seems to me that the
state interest would be rather clear there.

One, it would

eliminate the discrimination if they all agreed on the price,
and secondly, it probably would tend to restrict the amount of
goods sold, because generally you, when yen have a monopolis­
tic market, it cuts down on the supply.
MR. CHIDLAW:

Well, I think that5s true, and that’s

what happens in the monopoly states,

The state has the total

monopoly, and it sets one price»

It's as though all the com­

petitors -QUESTION:

I would think you would say categorically

that it would be all right for a state to authorise concerted
action to restrict production —
MR. CHIDLAW:

I suppose the hesitation is based on

the idea that I don't believe any legislature has ever done
that, and I'm not anticipating a legislature would do that,
because —
QUESTION;

Well, why shouldn't the legislature —

the same policy —
MR. CHIDLAW:

Absolutely, I agree, that the power

of the Twenty-first Amendment gives the state the power to
do that —
QUESTION;

To authorize that.

MR. CHIDLAW;
QUESTION;

Right.

And —

And thereby exempt it entirely from the

antitrust laws.
*

'

MR. CHIDLAW:

,

I suppose what I am doing is putting

myself in the position of a legislator, and I might have
some personal reservations about doing that.

But yes, the

>

state has that power.
QUESTION:

And I suppose you could, for the same

reason, the state cculd make price discrimination illegal ----I mean legal, quite legal — that if someone wanted to prefer

16
certain retailers over sane others,, they could.
MR. CHIDLAW:

Well, I think again, I think we run

into an equal protection -QUESTION:

No, but they could.

MR. CHIDLAW:
QUESTION:

Wall, that's the absolutist theory.

What do you mean, equal protection.

Has

equal protection got more reach than a commerce, or what?
MR. CHIDLAW:

Well, the equal protection clause has

been held by -this Court, and I think rightly so, to affect the
Twenty-first Amendment.
The Twenty-first Amendment was only intended to re­
place the commerce clause in liquor regulation.

It wasn't

intended to replace the equal protection clause or the due
process clause or ary of the other personal guarantees, and I
don’t believe that your scheme would hold up under an equal
protecfcion argument,
QUESTION:

Mr. Chidlaw, I'm not sure but I don't

suppose the Twenty-first Amendment was' argued in the
Schwegmann case —

MR. CHIDLAW:
QUESTION:

Not as far as I know.

— but if it had been, I take it you

would contend the case should have been decided the other
way under the Twenty-first Amendment.
MR. CHIDLAW:

Schwegmann is just —

No, I wouldn't, and I want to be

very careful about how I say this, but the Schwegmann case

17
did not involve a liquor fair trade statute; it involved a
general fair trade statute.

And if the state has not acted

in the liquor field, then the federal lav; may operate.
QUESTION;

Thcifc's right? I remember that.

MR. CHIDL&W:

I think I'm basically out of time, but

I did want to suggest that the preemption argument made by
the Solicitor General .in his brief, which I received the
printed hricif only last Friday and it was somewhat different
than the uncorrected typescript that I had received before,
but I did want to pcint out to the Court that although the
Federal Trade Commission seemingly approved the uncorrected
typescript that I received the week before that, in the
printed brief —- and I'm not sure what page that appears on -~
in the printed brief the FTC attorneys have, I don't -want to
use the wore, "disavowed," but they've indicated they're not
i

participating in the Twenty-first Amendment argument.

I

think that is significant.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Roth.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. ROTH, ESQ.,
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. ROTH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to make soma remarks about the stats
action part of the case, and I believe that the best way for

18

-ill of us to look at it is in a schematic way, just to first
j.ook at, originally the United States of America didn't have
any anti-competitive law.

There was seme general, vague

cammonlaw principles coming down from old English law, and
then the Sherman Antitrust Act was passed, and that was the
first time we really had a federal law relating to the anti­
competitive activity.
And then subsequent to that, v?e had Miller-Tydings
and McGuire Acts which permitted an exception to the Sherman
Act and permitted any commodity, the manufacturer of any
commodity to determine what his retail price for that product
should be, and -then schematically came along the state laws
relating to fair trade in alcoholic beverages.

And super­

imposed on all of this was the Parker-Brown state action exemp
tier., and i think to see how it all fits together, we have
to look at the differences between Miller-Tydings type of fair
trade, which I sometimes call regular fair trade, and state
liquor fair trade.
In the Mil Ler-Tydings regular fair trade you have
two factors;

One is that the regulation of the fair trade is

totally optional, both on the manufacturer and on the retailer
The manufacturer can say, "I desire to fair tirade my merchan­
dise, ’* or ”1 dr not do so."

The retailer can say, "I desire

to handle fair trade merchandise,51 or,
QUESTION;

"I do not do so.”

But if he handles it, he has no option.

13
MR, ROTH:

If h® handles it he has no option: that

is correct, Your Honor.

But the option is there, if h© wants

to take it.
In the state liquor fair trade, on the other hand,
everything is mandatory.

The state liquor fair trad© is

highly regulated at all stages of the process from the manu­
facturing —
QUESTION:

But the price level isn' t,'

MR. ROTH:

Pardon?

QUESTION:

The price level is not.

MR. ROTH:

No, but the industry is, and I think

that's very important, that the industry at every single level
is regulated.

You can’t oparate without a state licens® as a

retailer, you can't operate as a wholesaler, a distributor, a
manufacturer, and in exchange for this exclusive right to
operate, you have to conform to the state law, the state rules
regulations, whatever the dictates and demands are, as long as
there's no fundamental constitutional proscription.

The state for instans® can't say to you as a person
who has a license in the alcoholic beverages business that
you must discriminate against certain people, just obvious
certain federal proscriptions and constitutional proscriptions.
But generally you have to conform.
of being in the business
Sir?

It's part of the necessity

20
QUESTION:

Is it fair to infer that the Alcohol

Beverage Control Board does not agree that it's necessary to
follow the price regulation in order to have effective regu­
lations?

As I understand it, they acquiesced in the earlier

decision, indicating in papers filed here that they are syrapa
thetic with the other side of the ease.
MR. ROTH:

Let me put it this way, Your Honor»

I

talked to th® counsel for the board on the 26th of December,'
and I said,

”1 may he asked that question/* and I had an

attorney-client privilege at that time arid I said, "What may
I tell fclxe Court?"
Counsel for the board said to me, "You can tell the
Court that the Director dislikes fair trade immensely, that
he did very much want to see the state's right to regulate in
the area protected,” and that's about: as far as I have —
QUESTION:

I take it it’s fair to infer then that

the state's right to regulate could be adequately protected
without fair trade, in his judgment?
MR. ROTH:

In his judgment --

QUESTION:

With which you would disagree?

MR. ROTH:

I disagree, because we believe it's a

legislative judgment and that absent a court decision or, on
the other hand, this Court coming out with a different ruling
he would be bound to follow.
Sir?

2.1

QUESTION:

There isn't any issue here about the

power of the state to regulate prices?
MR. ROTH:

Well, no, the stata itself -— you. say

there is no issue here?
QUESTION:

Is there?

MR. ROTH:

Well, as I --

QUESTION:

There isn’t any state statute setting a

price on liquor?
MR. ROTH:

No, not to set the price.

The point is

that the state statute says that at -the tail end of the stats
action exemption, in effect, that the manufacturer is given
the right to set the price that his merchandise should be sold
for.
QUESTION:

Well, would you be here making the same

argument or at least a similar argument if it ware, whether or
not to set a price was optional?
MR. ROTH:

I don’t quite follow Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, suppose a producer was free not to

post a price, but he could, and if h© did, why, the retailers
ware bound to sell at that price?
MR. ROTH:
Pair Trad© Act.

Well, that \x>uld be just like the old

But that would be different, I think.

QUESTION:

So you wouldn’t be here making the argu­

MR. ROTH:

No, I’d make? the argument because here

ment ?

22

we have the state statute specifically saying I have to do
tli at .
QUESTION;

Well, would you defend that system as

exempt from the Sherman Act?
MR. ROTH;

If the legislature passed it, I think it

cranes under the state exception; yes, Your Honor.

Because it

seems to me that the exception arises because the state spe­
cifically tells the licensee what the conduct is.

It’s not

the fact that at the tail end he has this right to set that
price.

It’s the fact that he's told as a licensee in the

liquor business, "You must do this."

And 'the legislature has

come along and determined that it was necessary for certain
reasons.
The California Supreme Court said, there's a dif­
ference of opinion on it? we think the weight now is the other
way, the public policy is the other way.

They never specifi­

cally said it was totally the other way.
QUESTION;

Well, under the law, aren't the producers

all free to agree among themselves on a standard price?
MR. ROTH:

Only on the Parker v. Rice case where

the state told them to.
QUESTION:

But you would say that if the producers

did get — in carrying out their obligations to post prices,
they could all get together and post —
MR. ROTH:

No,

I would say not.

23
QUESTION:

— the same price?

MR. ROTH:

That's a matter for the federal govern-

raent or the state government to go in and say,
The state law doesn't let you do that.

"Wait a minute.

You can't go and have

horizontal price structura" — pardon me?
QUESTION:

It doesn’t prohibit it, doss it?

MR. ROTH:

The California Cartwright Act certainly

does, and the federal Sherman Act. certainly does,

It pro­

hibits —*
QUESTION:

You would say the Sherman Act would ap­

ply, if all the producers in this case got together and
agreed on a standard price and all posted the same price,
you would say the Sherman Act would apply?
MR. ROTH;
permit that.

Yes, sir, because the state law doss not

The stata law says the individual brand owner

sets his own price; it doesn't say you can conspira with
ether people to set a price.
QUESTION:

Why put it that way?

If the state said

that you could set a price on milk, which is much mores of
interest to the government, I hope, than whiskey, that would
not be any good?
MR. ROTE:

Well —

QUESTION:

That would violat® the Sherman Act,

wouldn*t it?
MR. ROTH:

Yes, but if you had ~ it would violate

couldn't tell the producers of railk that, you're going to set

May I ask one other question on the statute?

MR. ROTH;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

We generally thought about prices in

Sherman Act context as going up, but there is also a line of
thinking under Section 2 of the Sherman Act that sometimes by
setting a price, very low, one can drive his competitors out of
business and thereby acquire a monopoly.
If -the facts would show that a very large producer
of wine or liquor wanted to enforce a very low predatory price
in order- to drive his competitors out of business and compel
the wholesalers to sell at a low price and the retailers in
turn to sell at a low price, h© filed very low price schedules
in the state for that purpose, and say his purpose was plain

30

ORAL ARGUMENT OP JACK B. OWENS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. OWNSSt

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
,

Respondent Mideal would like to commence with a

brief description of the statute, and a point which I think
is required in response to an argument mads by the petitioner.
In order to decide this case correctly, it’s important
to understand that this is a maintenance statute, a vertical
price maintenance statute.

You hear the petitioner argue that

one of the state5© interests behind this statute was to prevent
price discrimination at the hands of wholesalers against re­
tailers, and raise the concept of posting.
I want to try to get across, if I can, the differ­
ence between posting and price maintenance, and make it as
clear as I can that the statute we have here is a pries main­
tenance statute and not a posting statute.
In the cert petition, the assertion was made that
an affirmance in this case would continue the effect of in­
validating a lot of state statutes around the country dealing
with posting.

That isn't correct.

Posting is a phenomenon

undertaken in some state liquor codas by which a wholesaler,
for example, is required to post its own price.

That's it.

There is no control over that entity's price by someone further

up in the vertical chain.

31
Posting is simply a price publication situation by
ths entity that sets the price.

The bulk of the statutes

that are cited to you in the petition, in 'die chain of horribles
argument which is given there, are posting statutes.
What we have hare is a maintenance statute.
QUESTION:

Mr. Owens, if in the absence of statute,

do you think, a posting practice engaged in by the sellers
would be violative of any of the antitrust laws'?
MR. OWENS:

It’s possible und-er the Container case

and possibly the Gypsum case.

It would depend on whether the-

act of posting occurred in the right economic structure of
the market, if it were a concentrated market and it led to
horizontal exchange of price data, there would be a question
posed, a question posed in an ©carliar era in the Seagram case
and addressed by Mr. Justice Stewart in his opinion there.
Yes, there is a risk of an antitrust violation in
a posting statute.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that if there — you

say there's a risk of an antitrust violation in a posting
statute or a posting policy?
MR. OWENS:

Both.

the requirement to post.

If the posting statute is simply

But the point I am trying to get

across now is that that's not this case; that's considerably
different from this case.
This case, if you would envision a four-level

33

industry -- producers, wholesalers, distributors and con­
sumers -- what we have here is the producers setting the
price for the wholesalers and the retailers,
tenance case? it's not a posting case.

It's a main­

And if, to give

petitioner the point, if the state has an interest in pre­
serving -- or preventing price discrimination, this is not
the way to do it; this is not the system to accomplish it.
It can be accomplished if it's something important
to accomplish, apart from the standard requirements of the
federal antitrust law or state antitrust law, with a system
which is far less abusive of federal antitrust interests.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think we made that sort of

examination in Parker v. Brown, if the California has an in­
terest in maintaining the price of the raisin market, none­
theless it could have done it in a different wav?
MR, OWENS:

If I understand your question, Mr,

Justice Rehnquist, I believe that Parker turns on several
important features which are not here and which mav be
determinative.

They are, for example, the fact that the

state commission in the Parker case was mandated by the state
legislature to determine whether the profits provided to the
producers as a result of the program were unreasonable.
«•

Failure to review and measure the reasonableness of
the programs which were entered into —
QUESTION:

Why do you say that it turns on that?

34

I thought it turned on the fact that it was the state that
had mandated the action.
MR. OWENS:

No, sir, I don't think so, because the;

opinion for the Court indicates quite clearly that a state
may not simply command what the Sherman Act forbids.

With

that stated in the opinion, the holding must be that what
validated that particular program was the degree of state
supervision arid control, and particularly 1 would stress the
state’s control over the profits received bv the producers,
because what you hava there, ,and this is consistent with a
lot of Mr. Justice Blackmun’s writing and his opinions in this
area, what you have there is the state creating a surrogate
for the federal interests espoused in the Sherman Act.

You

have a state measuring the degree of profitability to the
producers that comes out of such a program.

That's totally

absent in this system, and I think the absence may well be
determinative.
In any event, what we have here is a maintenance
statute.

The petitioner continually uses the phrase, "com­

prehensive scheme," extensive regulation scheme.

The point

is, as indicated by Mr. Justice White, there is no control bv
the state over these prices whatsoever.

The fact that there

is regulation in other areas is really irrelevant to the issue
which is before us, which is

can the state simply command

what the Sherman Act forbids, which I believe the court has

35
declared twiceis not the law:

Parker and Schwegmann.

On the question of the other states, if I can close
up that point, I don't think it's determinative what the ef­
fect of this may be on-other states.

The law is the law.

You

will decide it as yc-u see it correctly and the consequences in
the other states will not curb your judgment, I suspect, but I
X

think we ought to clear up the misconception.

The only state

in the country that has anything like the California system is
Mew York.

There are three other states that have something

like this, but the distinction is maybe very important.
QUESTION:

What about the Virginia state liquor

stores, where you go into the state liquor store and. you can
buy a particular brand only at a particular price, and only
the state sells liquor?
MR. OWENS:

Yes, sir.

It's not respondent's posi­

tion that state monopolization of the business is invalid.
QUESTION:

Weil, why is that any better than what

California has?
QUESTION:
MR. OWENS:

Because vour state can't violate the —
I think, Your Honor, that w® can proceed

in greater degree of confidence, that if the state takes over
the business, that seme of the interests which underlie the
Sherman Act will be served by the state itself.

It is the

state running the program.
What we have here is, as the Solicitor General

36

indicated, a bare grant and permission to engage in private
price fixing.

That to me, in view of the respondent, is quite

a distance away from what was at issue in the evolution of the
Twenty-first Amendment.

In the state monopoly case and in the

state monopoly situations, you commonly are dealing with states
that have had a drier philosophy than other states.

You have

activity which is closer to what the Twenty-first Amendment
was designed to deal with.
QUESTION:

If the state, taking Virginia as one ex­

ample, decided as a matter of policy that it wanted to dis­
courage the use of hard liquor and encourage the consumption
of wines, could it ciarge, for example, $25 a bottle, fixing
its price in its store, $25 a bottle for Scotch and bourbon
and gin, and use the extra profits to subsidize a lower price
on wine, perhaps selling it at cost or below its cost?
MR. OWENS:

As a matter of personal preference, I

would hope they didn’t attach that price to bourbon.
sir, I believe they can.

Yes.

Yes,

I think that if it were the

state —
QUESTION:

Twenty-first Amendment would be the source

of that authority?
MR. OWENS:
QUESTION:
MR. OWENS:
Stewart.

That is correct, Your Honor.
Plus Parker v. Brown, wouldn't it?
Yes, that is also correct, Mr. Justice

37
QUESTION:

And quite apart from the Twenty-first

Amendment.
MR. OWENS:

Yes.

I will quote you one case that

may be difficu.lt to deal with there.

If the state is acting

as the marketeer and also permits independent retail stores,
as is I believe true —
QUESTION:

Oh, no, no, I had understood this as a

state monopoly.
QUESTION;
MR. GWENS;
QUESTION:

Yes.
A stats monopoly —
And Parker v. Brown would cover that?

Quite apart from the Twenty-first Amendment, wouldn’t it?
MR. OWENS:
QUESTION:

In my view, that's correct.
Wall, what does the Twenty-first Amend­

ment add to Parker, anything at all, in your view,, vis a vis
the Sheerman Act?
MR. OWENS:

Yes, sir.

I believe the state -- let

me try it this way.
I do not believe that the state action doctrine
would simply permit a state to ban importation.

The simple

act of banning importation, in order to cartelize its domestic
industry, I don't think the state action doctrine carries that
far.

That is commanding what the Sherman Act forbids.
QUESTION:
MR. OWENS:

But the Twenty-first would permit it?
Yes,

it may.

38
QUESTION:

Is there anything else you can think of?

MR. OWENS:

I think that there are areas where the

conflict with the Sherman Act may not be as direct as it is
here, where the Twenty~first Amendment, might give the states a
greater degree of authority than the state action doctrine.
QUESTION:

Well, the state could engage in action

that in other contexts would be.a very clear violation of the,
certainly of the commerce clause itself i -it could totally pro­
hibit the import into its state of intoxicating liquors, could
it not?
MR. OWENS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Which you could not do for lumber or

eggs, or even garbage, could it?
MR. OWENS:

That’s correct.

I think what the state

can do under the Twenty-first Amendment, based on the deci­
sions you cited by Mr. Justice Brandeis, is to block all im­
portations .
QUESTION:

Or impose a very high duty or tax on it,

would you couldn’t do under the commerce clause.
MR. OWENS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Could it bar imports of anything except

liquors ?
MR. OWENS;
QUESTION:
Amendment?

No.
Just one category undor the Twenty-first

39

MR. OWENS:

Yes.

You understand, I am giving back

to you this Court’s rulings and the Brandeis Four in the line
of decisions that you cited.

I would suggest to you that what

has happened is that in the subsequent cases, the absolutist
character of the Brandeis Four decisions has been restricted
to the import situation.

I think that’s the correct reading

of your cases over the last fifty years.

,

Petitioner constantly cites the language from
Siffrin on commerce clause, leaving out the key words, "as
to products from without."

To the extent that the Brandeis

Four decisions creat® an absolute test, they do so in importa­
tion category.

I would further argue, Mr. Justice Stewart,

that the implication of closer attention to the history of
the amendment and the implication of some of the mid-course
correction that appears in your decision, may ba that at some
point down the line the absolute character of the Brandeis
Four decisions may be open to question.

But we don’t question

it here.
QUESTION:

Of course, that Idlewild decision is

thought bo ba and indeed can ba fully explained on the basis
of the proposition that that was international commerce, not
interstate commerce.
MR. OWENS:

Yes, sir.

And I think you can go down

the line on these cases and find one factual distinction or
another, but if I am reading —

40

QUESTION:

That's more than just a factual distinc­

tion; that was the case in that opinion, and as we at least
know now as a result of an opinion Mr, Justice Blackmun wrote
for the Court last term * I think that the power to regulate
international commerce is somewhat different than the power to
regulate.interstate commerce.
MR. OWENS:

I think that’s absolutely right.

I am

certainly not going to debate with the author cf the Idlew!Id
!

and Seagrams decisions.

But I believe*that what has happened

is —
QUESTION:

And Justice Black in dissent in that case

saw it as simply a sale in New York state.
MR. OWENS:

Yes, sir.

The test, however, which is

announced in those cases and reaffirmed in Craig and Boron
later on, that is, as I understand this Court's opinions to
date, the test that it believes applies.

I grant you that it

was a foreign commerce context in the Idlewild case, but it
was not in. Seagrams.

That was an interstate commerce context,

and the same test was applied, and I believe it is the test
which controls today.
The question is, for decision in this case, is what
does the test mean?
QUESTION:

Seagrams held that New York could —

well, they do precisely what it had done, did it not?
MR. OWENS:

Seagrams was an on-the-face opinion, as

41
you r era ember.
QUESTION:
MR. OWENS:
QUESTION:
MR. OWENS:

Yes.
It was .not an as-applied case.
Yes, because it had been state.
Yes.

I think a key factor to keep in

mind with regard to the Seagrams is that when the Court, through
your opinion, reached the question of whether affirmation, as
you recall that was a system by which the seller had to affirm
that its prices in New York were as low as prices elsewhere,
when you reached that particular point in the opinion as a
Court, you concluded that a violation of the Sherman S.ct was
not irresistably compelled by the affirmation system.
QUESTION:

Of course, that was not a Sherman Act

case as such? it was a constitutional attack upon the validity of the New York provisions which had been tried and the
provisions which have been upheld in the New York courts,
state court, system.
MR. OWENS:

It wasn't a federal antitrust case.
Yes, sir.

In the Seagrams case there

wore a variety of -QUESTION:

But among other claims were the claims

that New York had permittedf ’that what New York had permitted
violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.
MR. OWENS:

Yes, sir.

There was a burden on commerce

claim, there was an antitrust claim.
QUESTION:

When you reached the —

Equal protection, due process.

42
MR. OWENS:

Yes, sir.

Wien you reached the antitrust

Sherman Act claim, you concluded on the basis of the statute
which was before you that you could not determine that a vio­
lation of the Sherman Act was irresistably compelled by the
statute.

Now you have that case.
QUESTION:

But that involves effect, as I remember,

in other states, outside of the state of New York.

That was

the claim.
MR. OWENS:
QUESTION:
MR. OWENS:

Yes.
Was it not?
Yes.

By the way, the statute worked;

that's correct.
But what yon have before —
QUESTIQNs

'Wasn’t there at least a negative impli­

cation that had the effect been clearly confined to New York,
whatever that effect might have been, it would have been im­
munized from antitrust vulnerability from the Twenty-first
Amendment.
MR. OWENS:

As I say, you are the author of the

opinions, but I believe -QUESTION:
MR. OWENS:

You are the reader of the opinions.
I believe the Rcbinson-Patrnan portion

of the opinion takes away the negative implication that
you5re raising, because there's no extraterritorial effect
there..

43

Arul in any event, I believe the sense of the subse­
quent decisions of this Court is to adopt the standard
announced in that case as controlling in these cases.
There was a question raised about horizontal price
fixing.

I'm not sura that it was clearly sorted out, or

whether I will be able to do that, but the stata statute,
Section 24753, prohibits horizontal price fixing.
QUESTION:

What about vertical price fixing?

QUESTION:

Agreed-upon pries fixing.

MR. OWENS:

However, on the horizontal point, it's important
to understand that what happens is exactlv what Mr. Justice
Stevens was suggesting, is through this portable vertical
system you have horizontal —
QUESTION:

So you don't need to have horizontal

price fixing?
MR. OWENS:

Precisely.

44
Turning to the standard which I believe controls
this case under the Twenty-first Amendment, I think that
it’s clear in this Court's opinions that the absolutist
position that was announced on the other side has been re­
jected.

If that were the law, frankly, distilleries could

not be correct.

Burke v. Ford, other rulings of this Court

where the Court has recognized the application of the anti­
trust laws to the alcoholic beverage industry would all have
to be obliterated.

That can’t be the law.

The law must be, then, an accommodation must be
reached between state and federal interests of some kind.

QUESTION:

-Just so I — I haven't read Burke v»

Ford, at least I don't remember it, is that a case in which
the conduct which was challenged had been specifically
authorised and approved by the state?
MR. OWENS:
QUESTION:
MR. OWENS:

No.
Then it really doesn’t help us much.
Yes, it do a?-, sir, in this respect:

The petitioner has argued that you can’t freeze the situation
of the Twenty-first hmendmesifc as it existed in 1933.

He’s

arguing that what was given back to the states is the scope
of the commerce clause power as it exists todav.

That's his

position.
If that were true, if that ware correct it would,
as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out, be impossible for there
to be an antitrust prosecution under federal law, even if
the state did not authorize the behavior.

46

QUESTION;
MR. OWENS;

I sea,
Burke v. Ford is squarely on that point,

and squarely resolves it, as Mr. Justice Stewart indicated it
should be resolved.
QUESTION;

That's a little bit like the argument

that the federal government still retains -the power to put
minimum wages and safety standards and other things involving
the liquor industry, it's a little bit like the -- that’s the
same argument, that the federal power over the liquor industry
within California is not, has not bean surrendered to the
Twenty-first Amendment?
MR. OWENS;

That’s correct, I believe it has not.

It certainly has not been when you have something as funda­
mental as the Sherman Act, an activity which strikes at the
cor.e of the act.
QUESTION:

But there is an intermediate position

that Mr. Justice Frankfurter expounds in his concurring
opinion in Frankfurt which I think would be sufficient to
defeat you, in other words that if the Twenty-first Amendment
in effect gave the power to the state to act without violating
the Sherman Act
MR. OWENS:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
He concurred there on the ground that

Colorado had not approved of the combination at stake there.
MR. OWENS:

That's correct.

And that is the issue

47

put by this case.
QUESTION:
MR. OWENS:

Yes.
The state has acted, and our position

is that where you’re dealing with a demand that privata
parties engage in per se violations of the Sherman Act,
federal law prevails * and must prevail if you have a full
understanding of the background of the Twenty-first Amendment.
QUESTION:
MR. OWENS:
QUESTION;

Mr. Owens -—
Yes', sir.
— you would concede, I take it, in your

reference to Burke v. Ford, that an unargued per curiam deci­
sion of this Court that’s two pages long doesn’t have the
same pres dental weight as an orally argued case followed by
a written opinion?
MR. OWENS:

Yes, sir, just as I would argue that

the National Railroad case that he relied on, which i.s sum­
mary affirmance, is in about the same situation.
But I think it’s a question of concept more than a
question of holding.

If his position were correct, the

Sherman Act would ha in. total abeyance as to the alcoholic
beverage industry, and I would suggest that that is a. light
year away from the test of the Twenty-first Amendment, and
the history that, led up to it.
On the state action point, I believe there is some
independent force to it.

The critical factor here is the

48

absence of state supervision or control of any respect over
the pricing.

If this kind of system is to be exonerated,

No. 1, you have to disavow Parker and Schwegmann

,

but No. 2,

you have created a dangerous system by which states can simply
negate federal interests by declaration.

They are not required

under Tate any of the steps that are necessary to serve federal
interests as a substitute.
I don't believe the Twenty-first Amendment requires
that and I don't believe the state action doctrine permits it.
QUESTION:

Well- don't you think that the legisla­

ture is responsive to interests in the state, the same way
other supervisory boards would be, and if it declares a flat
ban or a flat approval, that that is as much state action as
a legislative authorization to some subordinate of the legis­
lature?
MR. OWENS:

I agree that it's as much stats action.

My position is, it's not enough to override the Sherman Act,
and I think that's what Parker means.
QUESTION:
MR-. OWENS:

Does that make sense to you logically?
Yes, it do as in this respect;

You’re

dealing with competing principles, competing interests.

You

can find a way to protect both sets of interests without
wholly negating the federal interest.
If the state believes that raising prices serves
temperance, despite the data, if that's what the state - -

-

43

concludes, let it do so by measuring the level of the prices
itself, or creating some system that pays seme heed to
federal interests, i.e., avoidance of excess profit-taking
from the industry by the producers»

If you let it simply de­

clare price fixing valid., there is no weight given to the
federal interest, underlying the Sherman Act.
If you let it do it without any supervision, there’s
no weight given to the federal interests, and that is what’s
wrong with this system and what is indicated in Parker and
Schwegmann»
QUESTION5

Mr. Owens, I understand you are arguing

that the scheme is ia direct conflict with federal antitrust
policy.

Do you contend that anyone who has complied with the

California law has actually violated the Sherman Act?
MROWENS:
QUESTION:

No, sir.,
If there’s no Sherman Act violation, how

do we find a conflict with the Sherman Act?
MR. OWENS:

Mr. Justice Douglas managed to do it

in Schwegmann.
QUESTION:

You also find it difficult to explain

how he did it?
MR. OWENS:

No, £irf no, because I believe that

the Sherman Act carries with it not only the technical set of
violations but also an expression of fundamental federal
policy, pro competition policy.

And there’s no question that

50

this statute--strikes ’at the core of that expression of policy.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think the Sherraam Act is

somehow more important than, say, the Fair Labor Standards
%

Act, or the Clean Air Act, or any number of other acts enacted
by Congress?

■ .

MR. OWENS:

No, not necessarily.

I don’t think it

is more important -QUESTION:
lowed to think so?

And even if you do think so, are we al­
Or say so?

{Laughter.)
MR.. OWENS:
QUESTION:

I think that it is —
May I just go one step further with you

on my — if there's a© violation of the Sherman Act, is it
because there's no concerted action, or is it because follow­
ing a state law cannot be a violation of the Sherman Act?
MR. GWENS:
why it’s not:

I think there are two possible reasons

On® is, if we assume that there is no independent

communication going on
QUESTION:
MR. OWENS:

Right, right.
— there is no independent contract as

required by the Sherman Act.
QUESTION:
MR. OWENS:

You’re missing —

Right, all right.
The second reason is that even if I'm

wrong about that, if I understand some of the passages in
your opinion Cantor and Mr. Justice Blackman's writing,

51
there may be a public policy exception to antitrust liability
where the activity was mandated by the state.
QUESTION;

Well, to the extent that you rsly on

the first reason, that — there would still be no Sherman

Act violation if we held, the statute, the California statute
bad, and the various people in the business continued to do
exactly the same thing by independent decision.

Say,

'this is

the price, making everything recommended rather -than mandated.
Well, that’s obvious.
MR. OWENS;

I'm not saying —

That would be a conscious parallelism

kind of question relating to communications.

I didn't mean

to -QUESTION;

You said there may be an immunity, if

they're following state law.

Where did this Court ever say

that?
MR. OWENS:

I don't believe the Court, as a court,

has said it, Your Honor.

I believe that there are sugges­

tions -QUESTION:

Suggesting, if they're following state

law, there ought to be
MR. OWENS:

an immunity.

Yes, Your Honor, and I found support

for that in particular opinions which have not yet cctnm&ndcd

s court.
I’m sorry, I was diverted from your question, Mr.
Justice Rehnqdist.

52
I don't think the Sherman Act is necessarily more
important than this, that, or the othere thing.

Our position,

ray position is that it is a vary important body of federal
law on a par

with other important bodies of federal law.

Another example might be the —
QUESTION:

Other unimportant bodies of federal law,

too?
MR. OWENSs

Yes.

offer that question in jest.

That's not -- I know you don’t
Yes.

It’s possible that there

may be a situation in which the federal interest isn't
weighty enough.
QUESTION:

But how are we to judge if Congress en­

acts 100 statutes, and each contains flat prohibitory lan­
guage,

which ones are important and which ones aren ft?
MR. OWENS:

I think it’s the same analysis that

the Court is required to go through when it undertakes a
preemption analysis.

Sometimes Congress is very clear in

what it prohibits; sometimes it is not.
QUESTION:

What if in all these hundred it is very

clear in what it prohibits?
MR. OWENS:

Then as I understand the Twenty-first
(

Amendment, if it’s not simply a question of trying to‘ban
importation and it isn’t really at the core of a prohibition
j
|
or a temperance related system, the federal interest is very

I

likely to prevciil.

53
Thank you, Your Honor'*
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:57 o'clock a.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
