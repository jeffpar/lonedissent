ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY M. FALLICE, ESQ,,
■i *

ON BEHALF OF THB PETITIONER
MR, FALLICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

th© Courts
This matter concerns an appeal fro®- the .Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit which affirmed a judgment of
the District Court which had permanently enjoined the pe­
titioner from violating the anti-fraud provisions and the
registration provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and
1934.
The issue that is raised 'in this appeal is whether
scienteris a necessary element in an action for injunctive
relief under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 and under Section
17(a) of the IS33 Act.
The facts surrounding the issuance of the permanent
injunction -are quit® short mid simple.

Petitioner was em­

ployed by a company known as E. L. Aaron & Company, a
company owned by his father.

Pros 1974 through the beginning

of 1975, E. L. Aaron & Company was making a market in the
common stock of a company known as Lawn-A-Mat Chemical a
Equipment Corp.

During that period, of time, a branch office

4
was opened in Roslyn Heights, New York.

Two registered

employees of E. L. Aaron & Company sent to that branch of­
fice and during their time there they mad® m1srepresenta tions concerning th© financial status and health of L&wn-AMat and also concerning future manufacturing ideas concern­
ing Lawn-A-Hat.
Th© District Courts while firdiiag that Mr. Aaron
did not make any false misrepresentations, nevertheless said
he willfully aided and abetted a violation of the anti-fraud
provisions by failing to prevent his employees from continu­
ing in those statements they made.

Of course, Mr. Aaron was

not m owner of E. L. Aaron & Company, nor was he an officer
of B„ L. Aaron a Cicsspany.
The Second Circuit Court of Appeals nevertheless
said that it did not have to reach the issue of scianta end
based on its long-term policy said that th© standard in in­
junctive actions under section 10 Cb) would be a negligence
standard.

Thus, th© first issue was whether under section

10(b) there should be a.standard of scienterin.injunctive
actions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Fa1lick, in your question pre­

sented for decision in your petition for certiorari, when
you refer to the government enforcement by injunction of
these acts, do you think there is fairly assumed fcha federal
rules of civil procedure, 65 at cetera, relating to

5

,

injunctions regardless of whether the particular statutes
contain a requirement of scienter or not when enforcement
is brought by the government?
MR. FALLICK:

'('Jell, standards under the sections

concerning injunctive relief, whether the defendant is en­
gaged or likely to engage in a violation of certain sections
or regulations Gf the securities law, and I am not nuite
sure if that isxfche same standard under the federal 65.
In the Hochf elder case, this Court had the opnortunity to construe the meaning of section 10(b) in the con­
text of a private damage action.

We submit that there .is

nothing in that Court’s decision which indicates that a
different standard should

be applied here.

In Hochfelder, this Court relied on the language,
legislative history and administrative history of section
10(b) to determine that that language connotes intentional
conduct.

Of course, when section 10(b) was enacted. Congress

did not contemplate that there would be a private damage
cause, of action, therefore the language and the history
should reflect congressional determination and intention
concerning injunctive relief under section 10(b).
The government relies heavily on the Capital
Gains case in which this Court in 1940 stated that there
is a difference between fraud in law and fraud in enmity.
In that case, Capital Gains, Mr. Justice Goldberg

heavily

6

relied upon the legislative historv surrounding the invest­
ment Advisers Act, and this Court has said that that inter­
pretation is premised on congressional belief that there
should be standards concerning federal fiduciarv relation­
ship with investment advisers»
In addition, Mr» Justice Goldberg was clearlv in­
fluenced

by the fact that the injunctive relief in Capital

Gains was mildly propylactic.

Here, however, in the normal

course of security business, injunctive relief is no longer
considered mildly prophylactic.

There is a loss of reputa­

tion, a loss of business, subject to administrative and
criminal proceedings.
Courts no longer, especially in the Second
Circuit, consider injunctive relief to be miidlv propvlactic.
Thus, because the statutory text of Capital Gains is of
course different than under 10(b), because of the legisla­
tive history of the Investment Advisers Act, and because of
the premise that injunctive relief is miidlv proovlacfcic,
and it was in that ease.
able from the case at bar.

That case was clearlv distinguish­
* v.

There is also an issue presented here concerning
whether injunctive relief should be premised on a standard
of scienter under section 17(a) of the 1933 Securities Act.
Several courts, several commentators have recently commented
upon section 17(a).

The Fifth Circuit, in construing

7
subsection (3.) of 17(a), said t i iw

Wi.

^

V-^ <C*0 «i» ^2« -i- jL V

th© words "device, schema and artifice to defraud" clearIv
connote that Congress intended that a standard of scienter
be established.
Of coarse, the Fifth Circuit, in the Steadman case
was relying on the language of this Court in Hochfelder.
The petitioner takes the position that whatever
standard, especially it should be a scienter standard, is
established under 10(b), it should also govern under section
17(a).

These two sections are so closely related, they both

serve the same function, that it is cleasr that congressional
intent should be that the language should be construed to
establish that the standard of liability for injunctive
relief under 10(b) is a scienter standard.
QUESTION:

Although 17(a) (2) of the 1933 Act

does not by its terms either explicitly or impliedtlv .in­
dicate a requirement of scienter, does it?
MR. FALLICK:

By its terms, no, it does not.

In

fact —
QUESTION:

Unlike 10(b)(5) as at least as construed

in the Hochfelder case.
MR. FALLICK:

10(b)(5) is, of course, reiving

upon its promulgating statute which would be 10(b).
QUESTION:
MR. FALLICK:

10(b), yes.
17(a) stands alone.

However, it is

8

our position, because the language of 17(a) is so similar
to that of 10(b) and 10{b)(5) and the statutes serve the
same function, that using the —
QUESTION:

Well, mv question was whether -- isn't

the language of 17(a)(2) different from that of 10(b).
MR. FALLICK:

It is different from 10(b), similar

to 10(b)(5) and the Investment Advisers Act 206.

While it

is different, we contend that it should have the same
standard of scienter, otherwise we will be an anomalv between
the 833 Act and the '34 Act concerning the standard of
liability.
QUESTION:

Well, there are other differences be­

tween the two acts.
MR. FALLXCK:
QUESTION:

There are other differences ---

They have different purposes.

MR. FALLICK:

The differences are, of course,

different but —•
QUESTION:

But they are in the same ball nark,

of course.
MR. FALLICK:

The two measures are both general

anti-fraud measures concerning deceptive sales.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. FALLICK:

I would like to reserve the rest of

my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Verv well.

Q

Mr * Ferrara.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH C„ FERRARA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FERRARA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Securities and Exchange Commission believes
that in an enforcement action brought by the commission,
when a federal District Court judge finds that a defendant
has engaged in conduct which has deceived the public in con­
nection with a securities transaction and he finds that un­
less enjoined the defendant is likely to continue to engage
in that conduct, he may grant injunctive relief without
showing that the defendant acted with scienter.

In short,

the —
QUESTION:

What do you mean bv '’deceived"?

MR. FERRARA:

Well, in the federal securities

laws, what is prohibited in section 10(b) of the Securities
and Exchange Act is the employment of a deceptive device.
Deceptive in that context is an effect word that reaches
for the effect of the misconduct on the investor.

If the

investor has been misled, then he has been deceived and it
is actionable, we would submit, under section 10(b).

Is

that —
QUESTION:

Does he not require any — it is simply

the making of a statement which is not true without regard

10

to the knowledge on the part of the person making the state­
ment as to whether or not it was true?
MR. FERRARA:

Now, you have to sort between both

acts, Mr. Justice Rehnguist, the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act.

Under section 10(b), the section that I began

with, the commission would submit that a deceptive act mav
be enjoined by a federal District Court judge if he finds
that it is likely to recur.

The fact that somebodv has en­

gaged in the past in a deceptive act is for purposes of a
commission action not significant.

Remember, the commission's

injunctive action under section 10(b) is predicated upon a
showing that a defendant is engaged or is about to engage
in a violation of any of the sections of the Exchange Act.
So what the commission need show is that someone
has engaged in misconduct which is reasonablv likely to de­
ceive, reasonably likelv to reoccur, and then a federal
District Court judge, exercising his discretion, mav enter
an injunction.
The question of the defendant's subjective state
of mind doesn't enter into the question of whether or not a
deception has occurred.

That is what section 10(b) sneaks

to.
QUESTION:

Well, Hochfelder, of course, held that

that language, deception, artifice and schemef that those
words were not effect words but that thev were purpose

11
words.

So your submission must be that they mean something

different when it comes to injunctive relief,
MR. FERRARA:

That is absolutely correct.

In

Ilochfelder, the majority opinion of the Court stated with
near surgical precision the context within which that case
was going to be decided, narnelv whether or not scienter was
going to be required in a private action for monev damages
under section. 10 (b) , and in that context —QUESTION:

In any event, a lot of the reasoning

of the opinion was that those words were purpose words, in­
tent words, not effect words.
MR. FERRARA:

The reasoning in Ilochf elder was

that they were intent words in the context of that case, and
that was quite appropriate in Ilochf elder because in a private
damage action, dr. Justice Stewart, the real issue for the
plaintiff is to demonstrate that the defendant has engaged.
QUESTION:

Wrong doing.

MR. FERRARA:

And once there is a determination

that the defendant has engaged, then monetary relief assum­
ing causation and the other requirements follows.

That is

a much different legal context than when the commission
brings an action for injunction.

In that context, the word

"deception" — not deceive, recall section 10(b) does not
proscribe deceit, it prescribes deceptive practices or de­
ceptive devices -- in that legal context, we think the

12
language of section 10(b) takes on a shade of different
meaning.
And I might add, Mr. Justice Stewart, there is
nothing strange to the lav; and the canons of statutory con­
struction, this Court has found that to be the case before.
SEC v. National Securities, for example, comes to mind, an
opinion in which, as I recall it, vou concurred in part and
dissented in part.

In that opinion, writing for the

majority" of the Court, Mr. Justice Marshall commented that
the word ''sale" could take on different meanings in the
context of the registration provisions and the anti-fraud
provisions of the Securities Act.

In doing that, Mr.

Justice Marshall noted that even Congress had intended in
the definitional sections of the Securities Act that the
word:

listed .in there

should have the meaning stated unless

the context otherwise required.

/And if mv recollection

serves me correct, you dissented in part from that portion
of Mr. .Justice Marshall's opinion, writing for the majoritv,
but even in that dissenting footnote I think vou said while
definitional problems are reasonably related in private
actions and in SEC enforcement actions, it is not plainIv
inconsistent to give different shades of meaning because of
the different

context within which those two actions arise.

So the position that the commission is taking here
is consistent with principles of statutory construction I

13

think that this Court has utilized in prior cases generally
and in prior securities cases specifically.
QUESTIO!1!:

Isn't thsre something of a tradition

built up around the first part of this century against what
is called government by injunction, that is that it is easier
for the government to go ou

and get an injunction against a

person not requiring intent, simply enjoining them from
disobeying the law and then prosecuting them on a civil
contempt standard when they disobev a law, rather than bring­
ing what might otherwise be a criminal prosecution against
them?
MR. FERRARA:
questions.

Your question raises several sub­

Let me try to deal with each.

First, is there

a bias or was there a bias at common law at the turn of the
century against governmental injunctive actions.

We would

also —
QUESTION:

In a contempt setting, counsel, is it

not necessary to show scienter before a contemnt order could
be entered, and sustained?
MR. FERRARA:

Mr. Chief Justice, the answer to

your question is yes, but it is a slight.lv different auestion than the one that Mr. Justice Rehnmiist asked me.
QUESTION:

I was taking it one step bevond his.

HR. FERRARA:

Mr. Justice: Rehncmist asked the

question of whether or not civil contempt would be an abuse

14
of governmental process, and you've asked the guestion of
whether criminal contempt should lie without a showing of
intentional or wrackless misconduct.

The answer to Mr.

Justice Rahnouist's question is civil contempt may lie.
Recall that civil contemot is contempt that is imposed by
the court to require the offending party to engage in an
affirmative act.

There, for example, if a party was en­

joined by the court to file an updated report with the com­
mission and he refused to do so, then civil contempt would
lie.
Mr. Chief Justice Burger’s guestion is would
criminal contempt lie.
context.

That raises a slightly different

Criminal contempt —*
QUESTION:

Mr. Ferrara, let me fisk you, it seems

to me that you ought to go back to the beginning of the
case.

If you are going to bring an injunctive action, you

are going to — by the time you have served your complaint,
the defendant is going to be put on notice as to what he
has done.

He has already known what he has don© all right

and he knows that the government is going to claim that he
has misled somebody.
MR. FERRARA:
QUESTION;

That’s correct.

And if you can show that after knowing

that, after knowing that that he is about to do it again,
he is never going to fo© able to say that he didn't intend

15

to mislead somebody.
MR. FERRARA:

Well, 1 think after the filing of

the —
QUESTION:

And if he disobeys an injunction ob­

tained after that kind of a showing, courts have to have
some way of enforcing their injunction.

I would suppose they

could.
MR. FERRARA:

That's correct.

That I think is

the heart of the Chief Justice's question.

Criminal contempt

usually lies when someone has violated the terms of a pro­
hibitory injunction, and that I think is different than civil
contempt.
I think Mr. Justice White's question goes to the
issue of riot whether or not contempt would lie against a de­
fendant after a complaint has been brought, because contempt
will only lie once an injunction has been entered, but rather
whether or not perhaps additional proceedings might bo war­
ranted against that -QUESTION:

Well, my suggestion to you is that bv

the time you gat to the end of your injunction case, you
will have satisfied the —
MR. FERRARA.:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

~~ the Hochfelder standard.

MR. FERRARA:

Well, assuming that his conduct is

continuing, that's correct.

16

QUESTION:

All right.

If you can show that he is

about to do it again and you've already told him that he
has misled somebody and you have proved it by definition -—
MR. FERRARA:
QUESTION:

That’s absolutely correct.

Then I don’t know why you don’t say the

standards are different.

They are the same in both cases.

The only thing is that you satisfy the Hochfelder standard
in putting on your injunction case.
MR. FERRARA:

At times you — if the conduct is

actually in progress while the injunctive case is pending
— but I would agree with you, you satisfv the Hochfelder
standard.

But if the conduct is retrospective conduct, if

it has been concluded that it is a past violation, then
what the commission needs to still show, not just a past
violation but a reasonable likelihood of recurrence.
QUESTION;

I know, but —

MR. FERRARA:

If the defendant is quiescent dur­

ing that period --QUESTION:

Yes, but if you show that he is likely

to do it again, it seems to me that automatically if he
does it again he will be doing if knowinglv.
MR. FERRARA:
QUESTION:

If he does it --

Because you have already —- you’ve got

him into court, you said here is what vou did, here is whv
it was wrong, here is how it misled somebody.

17
MR. FERRARA:
QUESTION:

I agree with that.

What about the caseof someone who is

charged with simple negligence and you've made out your
case of simpla negligence, and now vou are trving to show
that he i.s apt to violate the act by simple negligence again.
That is quite a difficult showing to make.
MR. FERRARA:
QUESTION:

It is indeed, and the commission —-

What if he makes it, what if you make

it?
MR. FERRARA:
if I may.

Well, let me respond to both questions,

Unquestionably if all the commission is able to

show is that someone has failed to use due care or, converse­
ly, has been careless in making a misstatement in one in­
dividual isolated instance, then we think it would be perhaps
unlikely that a federal District Court judge applying general
equitable principles applicable :o situations such as this
would order an injunction because a federal District Court
judge has broad discretion, takes many factors into account
besides the culpability of the defendant in order the in­
junction.
Now, Mr. Justice White's question is let's assume
that the commission meets that standard, let's assume that
we show not only culpability but also other factors —■
QUESTION:
if he has' been told.

Well, he can't do it negligentlv again
You can't be careless, he’s been told.

13
MR. FERRARA:

If he does not do it negligently

again, than we think criminal contempt could lie because
the injunction has put him vary specifically on notice as to
what his misconduct was.
QUESTION:

And you've been able to convince the

judge that tc get your injunction that he is liable to per­
form this action again.

That's the only way you are going

to get your injunction.
MR. FERRARA:

That it is reasonably likely that

he is to perform the act again, that's correct.
QUESTION:

And if he does, he can hardly complain

or defend on the ground that his second performance was
careless.
MR. FERRARA:

He —* well, we would hop© that he

would hardly be able to contend that, but in the context of
s. criminal contempt the question raised by the Chief Justice
i.s he presumably would go

into the criminal courts saying

efc best I was careless the second time, I didn't violate
the terms of the decree —
QUESTION?

That is a rusetier of contempt, net

of securities law.
MR. FERRARA:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

In this case, if he was negligent in

simply failing to supervise his employees, if the government
says you still have a lousy operation, you haven't got your

19
house in order and your employees are running around, would
you say that- in response to Mr. Justice White's question
that th© government has made out a scienter standard or just
a likelihood to again continue to be negligent?
MR. FERRARA:

Well, the government at that point

would have two options to pursue.

One, it could seek

criminal contempt against th© defendant demonstrating that
because he has been specifically put on notice by the prior
injunction in an admonitory way that his conduct violates
the law, that th© second time he is engaged willfully or
knowingly in a violation of the federal securities laws,
contempt will li®.

Or th© commission alternatively could

go back against th® same defendant, demonstrating that the
conduct wasn't knowing but that, wac negligent and that
perhaps further judicial relief is appropriate.
The key 1 think to the commission's position on
this case is not that the commission intends to go out and
to willy-nilly issue or ask courts to issue injunctions
against people itfho have done nothing mora than fail to escexcise due care.

To the contrary, though, the commission's

position is, again, one© someone ~ one© a federal District
Court, judge makes determination that someone has engaged in
misconduct which has resulted in a deception and is reason­
ably likely to recur, that fed®r€il District Court judge
should not be powerless to enter an injunction.

20

Now, if the conduct that the commission demonstrates
is in fact intentional conduct or scienter, as used in the
Kochfelder case, then I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, there
is a very high likelihood that the federal District Court
judge will enter the injunction.
If, on the other hand, the defendant’s conduct
was singular and wholly faultless, drawing on a term from
the Kochfelder opinion, then it is far less likely that a
federal District Court judge would utilize his discretion
to enter the injunction.

And in that gray area of what

runs between wholly faultless conduct arid intentional con'duct -- and I suppose there are gradations there of culpability which include gross
ing

negligence,

recklessness, know­

onduot, scienter, intentional conduct, willful conduct,

and so on — depending on the gradation that the commission
demonstrates, I think you increase the likelihood that an
injunction will be entered.
Again, it is critical to keep in mind that for
•the commission's case, as opposed to a private action, the
substantive provision, 10(b), and the authorization to seek
an injunction, 21(d) of the Exchange Act, actually have to
marge.

Merely proving a past violation doesn't get you

there, and that is what distinguishes this case from
Kochfelder, and that is the extraordinarily different legal
context in which this case is presented, the context that

21
requires that injunctions be issued not be precluded absent
a showing of scienterMr. Justice Blackmun, I -think you will note in the
comment that I just made perhaps somewhat of a response to
a comment you made in your dissenting opinion in Hockfelder,
that the action should not depend upon the identity of the
plaintiff.

Th® commission continues to agree with that.
The commission’s position here is that the opera­

tion of section 10(b) doesn’t depend on whether the plaintiff
is the commission or a private party.

The distinction de­

pends upon the nature of the action*, the totally different
legal context of an equitable action versus an action for
money damages, which I might add is consistent with the issue
that was reserved in the Kochfelder opinion in Footnote 12.
Recall, the majority opinion in Footnote 12 of Hochfelder
specifically reserved the question of whether scienter need
be shown in an injunctive proceeding under section 10(b) or
rule 10(b) (5).

It didn't reserve the question necessarily

of whether an SEC enforcement proceeding need not she
scienter.

t

It is the quality, the character, the nature of

the proceeding that makes the coloration of the words, the
interpretation of the words, the statutory construction
principias that are applicable different, not the identity
of the plaintiff.
Well, if I may, I have covered a good many of the

22

things that I wanted to talk on today, but perhaps I could
spend a moment or two detailing some of the other consider­
ations that the commission would like to bring to bear on
this question.
First, picking up and continuing on this thread of
the need for the commission to proceed without an absolute
showing of scienter in its injunctive actions, I think that
to fail to do so would really fail to recognize some very
important distinctions that are — and standards of culpa­
bility that are included in other provisions of the
Securities and Exchange Act.

For example, in other govern­

mental proceedings the Congress very carefully chose
words of culpability, willfully, reasonable cars, good faith,
reasonable grounds to believe, purpose, and so on.

Those

words we chink are peculiarly absent from section 10(b).
They are also absent from the provisions that authorized
the commission to bring its injunctive proceedings.
is important» and the reason it is important is

That

because

Congress in defining the array of enforcement powers that
the commission has used those words of culpability in other
specific provisions.
For example, the commission has various enforce­
ment alternatives available to it.

One1, of those enforcement

alternatives is an administrative proceeding.

There

Congress reached and used a specific word of culpability,

23

willfully.

The commission also, working with the Department

of Justice, can refer a case for criminal prosecution,
another specific remedy provided to the commission.

There

the Congress also chose another very specific word of culpa­
bility, willfully.

This we don’t think was inadvertent^

that in the final section or the act — not the final, but
another saction of the act, authorizing the commission to
seek injunctive relief, the Congress specifically declined
to use standards of culpability but, rather, used a differ­
ent locution.

The Congress chose to say the commission can

seek an injunction upon a proper showing, so the Congress
moved free words of culpability to burden of proof problems,
different concept.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ferrara, in section 10(b) of the

'34 Act, with respect to the words 'manipulative, deceptive
and contrivance," would you say that any of those implied
any state of mind or culpability?
MR. FERRARA:

Well, again, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

it depends upon the context within which the case arises.
In an equitable —
QUESTION:

Well, taken in the context in which

Congress enacted them.
MR. FERRARA:

Well, again — I can take them in

the context in which Congress enacted them., and that —
QUESTION:

Well, that is what we usually do,

24

isn't it?
MR. FERRARA:

-— and that context recognized that

common law, this very distinct division between actions at
fraud at law and actions at fraud and eauit^.

Congress

realized that at the time, so that is the context.

In that

context, the word "manipulative" does take on an actions at
law, money damage actions, an intent connotation and an
intent character.
equity, if the

In a commission injunctive action at

effect of the action is manipulative, per­

haps the commission should be able to seek an injunction.
Also manipulative, when used in the Exchange Act,
is indeed a word of art, as Mr. Justice Powell noted in his
majority opinion in Hochfelder.

But that word of art doesn*

only cover the wash sales, the matched orders, the kinds of
man?oulafcion, classic manipulation that I think the Court
was referring to in the context of that case.

The context,

again following up with your question, the context is
manipulative when you look, for example, at section 9(a)(4)
of the Exchange Act, contained in the general manipulative
section, also reaches false statements for the purpose of
inducing a person to purchase or sale of a security on an
exchange, all wrapped within the concept of manipulation»
the context within which Congress intended those words to
be used.
Mien you get around to your other two words,

25

device and contrivance,, first there is nothing in those two
words themselves that necessarily connote a form of inten­
tional misconduct»

I agree that Webster's -— when vou read

the Webster definitions of device and contrivance, there is
that — you can read in that element of intent, but I can
note for you that in the Exchange Act itself. Congress —
that is your context

Congress used the words device and

contrivance virtually interchangeably with the words acts
and practices.
If you look, for example, at section 15(c)(1) and
..5(c)(2) of the Exchange Act, and more importantly you read
the legislative history that accompanies those two sections,
and why the Congress wrote section 15(c) (1) and 15(c) (2)
the way that they did, I think it is illustrative of the
point that those concepts were roughly interchangeable.
Also, if vou look at the legislative history of
section 10(b), again if ray recollection is correct, the
Senate report, reporting out the bill that ultimately became
the Exchange Act as modified by the House bill, I think you
will find that the Senate report refers to section 10(b) as
proscribing the use of manipulative or deceptive acts and
practices.
So I don't think, Mr. Justice Rehncmist, that vou
can look £it the words standing along or in isolation or
outside of the context within which they were passed and

26
say that in an equitable proceeding Congress absolutely in­
tended that the commission demonstrate scienter, particular­
ly when .in a footnote that runs on for two pages in our
brief — particularly when in that footnote the Congress
otherwise used a whole array of culpability words.

It cer­

tainly knew how to us© them when it wanted to -- a whole
array of culpability words, and didn’t here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ferrara, I don’t recall that either

you or your friend have touched the subject of whether the
Court of Appeals in its review and in its opinion went
beyond what it needed to go with respect to the findings
here.
MR. FERRARA:
QUESTION:

Vis l'1 —

What were the findings specifically

of the District Court with reference to this statute?
MR. FERRARA:

The District Court found that the

defendant knew of the misconduct of the people that were
under his supervision and also had reason to know that
they were making false statements because as part of his
managerial responsibilities at fches firm, that he maintained
the due diligence files.

Due diligence files are files

containing current and accurate financial information that
are required to be maintained by market makers, those who
affirmatively sell stock for their own account.
court

Well, the

27
QUESTION:

That being so --

MR. FERRARA:
QUESTION:

Let. me respond to your question.

All right.

MR. FERRARA:

The District Court found that he

had acted knowingly and with reason to know arid accordingly
had met the scienter standards of Hochfelder and then went
on to find that

under either a negligence or a scienter

theory of liability, the defendant was liable.

That went to

the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

The District Court?

MR. FERRARA:

The District Court found that under

either a negligence or scienter theory of liability, the de­
fendant should be enjoined.
Court of Appeals.

That question goes up to the

The Court of Appeals only went so far to

reach that portion of the District Court’s conclusions of
law that said negligence could suffice, and the Court of
Appeals in a. unanimous panel said we think negligence is the
appropriate standard, that is as far as we have to do, and
that is as far as the court went.
The only time the Cor re of

appeals spoke to the

question of the defendant’s scienter was in part five of the
Court of Appeals opinion, where the court noted that the
District Court judge had properly taken the scienter of the
defendant into account in determining whether to issue an
injunction.

So the Court of Appeals only addressed the

28

scienter question in that limited context, that is whether
the District Court properly issued an injunction and not in
the context of establishing liability.
QUESTION:

Would it be fair to say that was an

holding?
MR. FERRARA:

Yes, I think it does.

In just

0~

looking at the words, either one or the other —
QUESTION:

It could have affirmed on the basis

of the leaser standard, could it not?
MR. FERRARA:

It could have, the Court of Appeals

could have said I suppose that — well, one of the issues
before the Court of Appeals was whether or not the defendant0
conduct amounted to scienter, as the District Court judge
had found, or alternatively whether the District Court judge
was clearly erroneous in that regard.

The Court of Appeals

could have said we are going to review the District Court’s
determinacions, we're going to find that the defendant acted
with scienter, therefore it is unnecessary for us to resolve
the question of whether negligence or the appropriate

29

standard.

The Court of Appeals did not do that.

The Court

of Appeals only went to the negligence question, which was
perfectly appropriate for it to do, given the two bases of
the District Court’s conclusion.
QUESTION:

I take it then you do not regard that

part of the holding as dictum?
MR. FERRARA:
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals.

Yes.

MR., FERRARA:

Oh, no, not at all.

That is the

essential holding of the case.
QUESTION:

Even though thev could have acted

and decided the case on a narrower ground?
MR. FERRARA:

I'm not sure that because a court

could have decided the case on a different ground it neces­
sarily means the ground that it decided it on was dicta.
That is the holding of the case.
QUESTION:

As I say, had the court --

It is clear that the court describes

that as its holding, and I was trying to go behind the
language of the court and see whether -MR. FERRARA:

Well, I think had the Second

Circuit said that we affirm the District Court's findings
of scienter and than sai.d but we're going off on a negli­
gence standard of liability, then I think perhaps the
standard the court chose may have been dicta .
of Appeals did not do that.

The Court

The Court of Appeals

30

specifically said w© ar® only reaching th© negligancfs ques­
tion.
In concluding, I would like to spend just a
moment if I my in saying why or explaining why th© commis­
sion took really th© unusual step of asking this Court to
grant certiorari in this case, even though th© District
Court found

in its favor os all of th© counts charged in

its complaint and entered a final judgment of permanent in­
junction and ®v@n though th® Second Circuit Court of Appeals
in a unanimous decision affirmed the District Court, and
even though the commission believes that both lower courts
were correct in their holding and in their conclusion that
scienter -#as not required in th© commission injunctive
action.
In doing that, I think it is important to under­
stand what the commission is contending in this court and
perhaps more importantly what it is sot contending in the
court.

As this Court knows, in the past several years the

commission has participated before this Court in several
cases where privat® parties have raised important issues
under th® federal securities laws and have raised questions
regarding th® scop© and effectiveness of those laws, and
oftentimes th® commission and I appearing on behalf of the
commission or the Solicitor General appearing on behalf of
the commission have appeared before the Court to express

31
the view that private damage actions play an essential role
in the enforcement of the federal securities laws, that they
serve as an essential supplement to the commission's own
enforcement actions.
Well, the Court's message lias been I think that
however laudable the purpose of private actions, the proper
scop© of those private actions is to enforce the federal
securities laws are quite limited.

’The Court's restrictions

1 think of the substantive provisions that can serve m a
basis for private enforcement of the federal securities
laws

as in the Lewis v. Transamerica case1, the Court's

definitions of the requirements for private actions to
enforce the federal securities laws,, as- under the Blue
Chip Stamps and Hochfelder case, have had a number of
significant effects on how the laws a]re enforced, and 1'
•think perhaps the most significant effect that it has
had is the fact that it has shifted fch© balance of the
manner in which these laws have to be- enforced.
The government, which has -always had the- primary
role for enforcing the federal securities laws has to taka
on now an even greater burden, and that is why we are here.
Tijafc is why we asked that this Court taka this action.
Scienter simply cannot be a prerequisite for a commission
injunetive asfelon.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Your time la expired.

32
QOESTICM:

Mr, Ferrara, yon have been addressing

generalities, may I ask you a general question.
MR. FERRARA:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

The commission has had a long experi­

ence with injunctions under 20(b).

As a practical matter,

what is the effect of a permanent injunction against a
brokerage firm or whoever issued by the SBC?
MR. FERRARA:

Well, I think that the injunction

has three vary critical things — well, iafc me respond in
two ways.

On®, the injunctive provision is the commission's

principal enforcement tool, the only tool that we rmlly
have against the great mesas.
don’t assess penalties,

We don't assess fines.

We

tie only seek injunctions, with the

exception of the regulated community.

So it is our primary

enforcement tool, and this commission is primarily a law
enforcement agency.

We are unlike the FCC and the host of

other independent regulatory agencies.
a regulator or a licensor.

We are not primarily

We are a law enforcement agency,

and this is our principal tool.
How, what does the injunction do?

Well, we think

that it brings the defendant's attention in a very focused
way to his past infractions, it lays down in an admonition
for the defendant as to what is expected of him in th©
future, and it gives -- it stimulates I think future compli­
ance with the federal securities laws through a judicial

33
mandat®.

It is those three objectives that we seek in seek-

inj one tive actions, and that is r®ally again all w© have.
QOSSTIOMs

What doss it do to the defendant?

MR. FERRARAs

Well, th@ra are sorae collateral

consequences that attach to tha issuance of an injunction.
Certainly# those who have boon found to havo carelessly
engaged in misconduct which results in a deception of in­
vestors and a federal District Court judge has found it
reasonably likely to recur and they ar® therefore enjoined
ar® going to suffer soms inconveniences.
Cn tha other hand, the statutory collateral eonsequ inces that can attach to the entry of an injunctive
deera® ar® largely discretionary.

In other words, any de­

fendant i.i an injunctive; action that has a collateral con­
sequence attach, a regulatory disability, for example, of
not being able to serve as an investment adviser to an
investment company, a regulatory disability that relates to
whether or net that issuer, if it is an issuer of securities,
can use the Regulation A exemption.
consequences are discretionary.

All of those collateral

Tha defendant in an injunc­

tive proceeding can seek to have the regulatory collateral
consequences not apply.

The commission has to take into

account all cf the factors that are raised by the respondent
in that collateral proceeding, he- has full review in the
courts of appeals, the courts of appeals have been vary

34
rigorous with the commission, saying that they cannot act
arbitrarily or capriciously in having the collateral conse­
quences attach — I mean, there is a host of protections.
I understand ail of that.

QUESTION:

What I was

interested in is if you were the broker and you had an in~
junc lion, a permanent injunction against you, what affect
would it have on your business and daily operations, and
would it last forever?
MR. FERRARA?

Well, that® ar© two specific regu­

latory disabilities that could be imposed that I recall.
QUESTION:

What was imposed in this case?

MR. FERRARA:
QUESTip?:

I sxa sorry?

Go ah*ad and tr#n tell me what was

:oaposed in -this -case.
MR. FERRARA:

The two specific regulatory: :dis- .

abilities I believe is that under 'section 9(a) of the

,

.Investment .Company Act, the enjoined broker-dealer, 'if it
had an investment adviser subsidiary, would be precluded
i'rora servicr- as an investment adviser : to a registered in­
vestment •cofabany.

That had no application in this a& sa be­

cause Aaron ,£ .Company as far as 2 'knpw did not have an in­
vestment adviser subsidiary.

When that does happen, section

S (c) of the Investment Company Act allows the defendant to
ccme in to the commission and seek to have that regulatory
disability waived.

Usually what happens when a broker-“dealer

35
or investment adviser is involved in an injunctive action»
is that th® regulatory disability :an& the injunctive pro­
ceeding ar® resolved all at the same time.
The second disability that comes into play is that
the broker-dealer may not be able to participat® in offering®
of securities under Regulation A.

That is an exemption

from the full registration provisions ©f th® federal securi­
ties laws., but again that regulatory disability can fe©
waived pursuant to the provisions of Regulation A itself.
Now» can the injunction ever be lifted?

Th«

courts have procedures for lifting the. injunctions.

QUESTION:
