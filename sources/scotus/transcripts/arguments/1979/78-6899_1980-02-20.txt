We will hear arguments

next in Godfrey against Georgia.
Mr o Holmes, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. CALLOWAY HOLMES, JR,, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOLMES:

Mr. Chief Justices, and may it please

the Court s
This is a death penalty case out of the State of
Georgia.

1 represent Mr. Robert Franklin Godfrey, who was

convicted of murder in the first degree in the killings of
his wife and her mother, his mother-in-law.

It is here by

4

writ of certiorari from Georgia Supreme Court.

The issue, as

framed by this Court in- this case, is whether in affirming
the death sentence in this case, has the; Georgia Supreme
Court adopted such a broad and vague construction of Section
27-2534.1(b)(7) as to

violat©

the Eighth and Fourteenth

Amendments to the U.S. Constitution?

Section fb)(7) is one

of ten aggravating circumstances that are the statutory guides
to jurors in posing the death sentence, the sentencing phase
of the Georgia proceedings.
Before getting into the merits of the construction
of Section (b)(7) by the Georgia Court, 1 would not want to
dwell too long, but I think it would be important to cover

4
the facts in this case»

This defendant, Mr. Godfrey, and his

wife, the record shows, had had a stormy marriage.

He had

been committed by her on three previous occasions to the
v

state mental hospital in Milledgevill®, Georgia.

They had

had a violent argument early in September of 1977, and she
had left the house after he had threatened her in a drunken
rage.

After about a week, the wife had filed divorce pro™

ceedings and had moved in with her mother, who was urging her
to go ahead and finally put an end to this marriage.
The defendant had worked for «approximately 20 years
at the Northwest Regional Hospital as a surgical nurse and
a post-operative male nurse.

He had been to work that day,,

and his mother-in-lav; had called, him out of the hospital to
tell him that his wife wanted to speak to him that evening.
The defendant testified that that led him to expect that he
was—or to hope that he was going to be able to reconcile
the situation as he hed bean able fee do in the past.

His

commitments to the state mental hospital in the past had been
voluntary, part of which was the condition for reconciliation
with his wife.
When he got home, his wife did in fact call him.
They had a rather violent- argument, could not reach any kind
of agreement on reconciliation or any of the divorce issues.
She hung up, told him that she would call back later and see
if they could discuss it further.

He testified that that

5
affected him deeply , that he was put into & very depressed
state c
After the second phone conversationi- which was
even more heated and she finally hung up on him, he testified
at that point that he blanked out»

Ha had had some-«whatever

history that is in the record-blackouts in the past»

The

record substantiates that he then proceeded to get a shotgun,
go down the hill to where the mother-in-law * s trailer was,
about a hundred, two hundred yards away, came up behind the
trailer, fired one shot through the back window, killing his
wife instantly, came into the trailer, hit his daughter as she
was going out, on the head, causing several stitches, went
into the trailer, reloading his shotgun, and shot his motherin-law in the head as well, creating a very gory scene inside
the trailer, which the prosecutor in the case portrayed by
color pictures ©van though he had black and whits pictures
of the same scenes in his file.
The petitioner then called the sheriff's office,
told them what he had done, told them to come gat him,
asked him where he was.

He explained where he was.

They

He then

goes outside the trailer, places the shotgun in the branches
of an apple tree, and then sits down uncer a shade tree to
await the arrival of the police.

When the police get there,

he tells them that they are dead, it is all over with, and
shows on© officer where he has placed the gun.

Hs is taken

6
irito custody, taken downtown, is in the county police buildings

In the presence of one officer he has allegedly told him that
he had done a heinous thing and had thought about it for a
long time and would do it again»
At the trial Dr» Davis, the psychiatrist from
Atlanta with quite impressive credentials, testified in behalf
of the defendant»

He had seen the defendant twice pursuant to

court order, had also treated the defendant back in the 860s
in

Heme where the defendant worked in the hospital there»
The second session with Dr, Davis was for the

purpose of a sodium amatol interview, truth serum, to aid
the psychiatrist in his diagnosis of the mental state and I
suppose also to determine the credibility of the defendant's
story.

The psychiatrist concluded that at the time of the

second phone call and the blackout of the defendant, that the
defendant had been imps!led by the immense emotional provoca­
tion that he felt about the breakup of his marriage into what
he described as a dissociative reaction and admitted on cross»
excjninatlon that that stats is an altered state of conscious­
ness but that the defendant probably would have known right
from wrong but would not have been able to consciously control
his actions.

There is a type of psychiatric condition where

suppressed feelings are played out in sort of an automatic
fashion without real conscious control ever it.

The state

had psychiatric testimony from Milledgeville Hospital, with

7
some—also the record?; of the defendant's previous incarcera­
tion down there,
Q

All these things you are telling us, Mr, Holmes,

were advanced to persuade the jury to a contrary conclusion,
I take it,

The jury did not accept this defense, did they?
MR, HOLMES?

temporary insanity.

They did not accept the defense of
They were advanced for two purposes, to

try to establish the lack ©£ criminal intent and also for
purposes of mitigation.

We felt that we were—-this was a

case that ought to be—ought to get a light sentence, felt
that the prosecutor should not have requested the death
sentence.

But that testimony was really going more to the

mitigation.

Our psychiatric witness admitted that it was a

non ••'psychotic condition, and they equated a psychotic condi/

felon with insanity,

£©', I think the jury fey that concession

concluded that there was bo real insanity defense.
Whan the prosecutor argued during the sentencing
phase t© the jury, under Section Cb)(7), which was the only
aggravating circumstance submitted to the jury, which is as
follows s

That the offense of murder was outrageously or

wantonly vile, ho.rrib.1e, or inhuman in that it involves
tc.’tura, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the
victim—
Q

Mr, Holmes, you are bask to the statute»

bean waiting for you to get to it.

I have

3
MR. HOLMESs
Q

Yes, sir.

And where are the soft words in the statute

that you feel are improper?

Is it; depravity of mind or is

it outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible# or inhuman, or
both?
MR. HOLMESs

I think it is both, Your Honor.

Depravity of mind is not involved in this case.

As a matter

of fact, there is a case decided at the same time as Godfrey,
«■mi.. H» «nil
Holton v. State, in which the Georgia Supreme Court expressed
the opinion and dicta that if a circumstance was only composed
of depravity of mind,, that that would probably be insufficient
under the Furaan decision«
Q

There were some factors her®, were there not?

I take it they were net argued.

But the fact that the killing

was before the young child, the fact that there wars two
murders, not one, two, and the fact that—at least 1 think it
is a fact—that he forced the second victim to anticipate
being killed.
MR. HOLMES*

Are these argued at all?

pation.

There was antici­

There was anticipation of death as far as the mother-

in-law was concerned.

But I believe that if you—X think what

9
you are getting at is whether or not that , as one Georgia
ease has held, is sufficient to find torture®

I do not

think momentary anticipation of death is what is contemplated
by the word "tertare ."
specifically held that®

The Georgia Supreme Court has not
They have held one case that is

similar to that—
Q

At least these are not specifically in the

statute*, this kind of thing, killing somebody in front of a
young child®
MR. HOLMESs
Q

Yes, that—

Suppose this wer© listed as an aggravating

circumstance in the statute, would if. be constitutional?
MR. HOLMESs

Your Honor, they are non-statutory

aggravating circumstances at present and could not be the
basis for a death sentence®

Whether or not—if there was an

aggravating circumstance number eleven that said, "If you
commit two firrt degree murders' in the same transaction, then
that permits the imposition of the death sentence,," 1 would
think, without a chance to analyse it, that that would
probably be specific enough.

It would certainly be as

specific as some of tbs other—
Q

Do you not get to a certain point where you have

to use general language just because of the instances mentioned by Mr. Justice Blackman?

It is simply impossible to

foresee all the manners in which killings can take place, and

10
you have Iso use some fairly general rubric in order to express
what you mean over and above murder in the first degree.
MR. HOLMES:

X -think that that is of course true.

The goal of perfection in -this type instance would ba very
difficult to reach..

But the prosecutor in this case told the

jury that torture was not involved and -that aggravated
battery was not involved in this case.
found a partial finding of (b'| (7).

And the jury only

rageously ©r wantonly vile, horrible, and inhuman.
terms—and the court approved that.

Those

There is another ease

cited in the biref where a jury found under Section (b){7>
that the offense was both horrible and inhuman.

So, our

argument is that the authoritative construction of Section
(b)(7) by the Georgia Supreme Court is that that language,
standing alone, is sufficient.

In other words, they have

construed this to the affect that (b)(7)

is really only

composed of vile, horrible, and inhuman.

And we -feel strongly

that that is no standard at all.

That is totally subjective.

Xt certainly has no objective component in it to make review
rational.
Q

What if the Georgia legislation, instead of

saying vile, wanton and inhuman, had said committed•in front
of a small child or committed on ® second person ten seconds
after it was committed on the first person; what you say,
would not comprise torture.

Would that satisfy your objections

11
MR, HOLMES:

That would be a wholly different case,

Your Honor, But if they chose to get that specific and they
described a particular type mother and the facts of the case
fit that descriptions, then the question here is whether the
aggravating circumstance can provide any guidance to channel
the discretion of jurors.

Under that standard, by describing

the crime very specifically and the facts meet that crime
very specifically, you 'have a standard that can be reason­
ably followed by a jury,
Q

My point is that just the range of human

experience suggests that you are not going to have a whole
catalog before you of the circumstances over and above first
degree murder, which may lead to a permissible capital
offense and that scan© generalization is necessary,
MR. HOLMESs

It may be, Your Honor, but I think it

has to be qualified by some objective portion.

If you take

this Section (b)(7) as & whole, leaving torture and aggra­
vated battery in it, that is something that you can point to
that can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

And the

standard in the sentencing phase is beyond a reasonable doubt,
Q

Are you telling us that shooting at about a

five or six foot range with a shotgun, blowing the head off
of a victim in the presence of two other potential victims,
one of whom became a victim, is not an aggravated battery?
MR, HOLMESs

Your Honor, to the extent that it—

12
under the Georgia statute, an aggravated battery is the
depriving of a member.

And if the top of the head is a

member of the body, then that just fits the description.
Q

That just deprived two people of their heads,

MR. HOLMESi
Q

Yes, sir.

‘That certainly is at least as bad as chopping

off an ana or a leg, is it not?
MR. HOLMES?

Certainly, Your Honor, because you

can live if you just lost an arm.

But that gets .into some

close questions of definition.
Q

What 1 was trying to get at, do you say that

the phrase in the statute 35aggravated battery" does not
embrace what took place here?
MR. HOLMES i
conceivably embrace it.

1 am saying, Your* Honor, that it could
But the jury did not find it, and

the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the partial finding and, in
effect, said that the jury’s phraseology in finding it vile,
horrible, and inhuman only was not objectionable.
Q

Suppose this, instead of being a shotgun

murder, had been just a clean single-shot pistol through the
heart.

Would you not be here making this same argument?
MR. HOLMESs

If the jury had mads the same partial

finding and under the entire circumstances and yet the judge,
the court, had held that that was a sufficient standard or
that was a sufficient finding, in effect saying that that

13
composes the standard, yes,, sir»
Q

The implication of ir-y inquiry of course is

whether any first degree murder under the Georgia theory
would fit (b)(7), any one*
MR» HOLMES:

Certainly as it has bean construed in

this case, any first degree murder and any loss of life
under the common definitions is going to be vile, horrible,
and inhuman»

It encompasses the range entirely of first

degree murder*
Q

I do not know how it could not be found to be*
Can we not assume reasonably that a jury could

have reasonably thought it fit these adjectives because it.
was in effect an execution committed in,the presence of the
next victim and even a possible third victim?

Apart from the

manner, whether it was injection of some drug or shooting
with the shotgun or a clean rifle bullet, the very nature of
the staging of it, an execution style murder-does that not
fall within the language “vile, outrageous, wanton"?
MR. HOLMESj

Yes, sir, it is horrible and it is

But every other murder is*

Every other

murder is*
Q

But this statute apparently reaches out for

something that is a little more than just an ordinari? killing,
as was suggested by a clean bullet shot through the heart.
that not what this statute is trying to reach?
MR. HOLMES:

1 think that was the intent of the

Is

14
statute,, Your Honor.

But I think it has been construed in

a totally open-ended fashion.

It has not been narrowed by

definition as the—
Q

Whether it is construed somewhere else that way

is not relevant to this case.

How

it was

applied in this

case is all we’re are concerned with, is it not?
MR. HOLMESs

Your Honor, 1 think the issue is in

this case as to whether or not Section (b)(7) has been uncon­
stitutionally construed on its face as well as the issue of
whether it just simply been unconstitutionally applied in
this case.
Q

But 1 thought you bad just agreed that this

was outrageous, vile, horrible, and inhuman.

You did not

agree on the aggravated battery part, but you have agreed that
as to these parts, it fits the statute, the events of this
case.

Did I misunderstand you?
MR. HOLMESs

No, Your Honor, but I did qualify that

answer by saying that if you asked me that question about any
murder, 1 would agree.
Q

It is not a question of whether we agree here.

It is a question of what a jury could reasonably conclude.
MR. HOLMES:

Your Honor, I think one reason-one

problem that is pointed out by this is that the standard, as
construed by the Georgia Court here, is so vague and over­
broad that it .is not capable of rational and objective

15
review»

Of course, it could fit this circumstance.

It

could fit any number of other circumstances across the range
of first degree murder.

And factors in this case that are

non-statutory aggravating circumstances cannot under the
statute be sufficient to i&spose the death penalty»
If there are no further questions, I would like to
reserve five minutes,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Very well, Mr, Holmes,

Mr. Dunsmore.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. DUNSMQRE, JR., ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, DUNSMOREs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

pi ase the Courts
In 1973 the General Assembly of Georgia, in
response to this Court5s decision in Furman, felt that the
states could still inflict a death penalty, providing the
manner in which they did so set forth certain articulate
standards.

In March of 1978 a jury in Polk County found that

one of these standards had been complied with, based upon the
f

state’s case, and imposed

the death penalty under the seventh

aggravating circumstance.
This is © case of premeditated murder.

The district

attorney on that basis sought the death penalty,

I would like

to briefly discuss seme of the facts in light of counsel’s
going over those facts.

While there was an altercation

between the petitioner and his wife some three weeks prior

16
to the fatal shootings, that altercation also involved
violence, and it also involved a weapon capable of producing
death, a knife»

On two occasions, on the 5th of September,

the petitioner drew a knife on his wife the first time to
make her remain seated at a couch in their house, and the
second time, actually used that knife on his wife in the
bathroom in which he cut her clothes to and through some of
her underclothing, although there was no apparent physical
injury as a result of that,
Q

That might bear on whether he should have

been acquitted or found guilty by reason of insanity or in
mitigations but what has it get to do with the issues now?

MR. DUNSMOREs All right, I think it has to do with
the issues in this matter-in that it shows a predisposition
on behalf of the petitioner, in view of his later stateme t, following the shootings, when he said, “I've done a
hideous crime.
X*d do it again.

I've thought about it for sight years.
Gr I was glad that X did it»**

And

Vis need to

take into consideration the fact that even, though /there had
been seme phone conversations between the petitioner and hit
wife, there appears t© be a sufficient interval, which the
jury considered, where there would have been a cooling off
of any passion's.

The killing takes place at night.

The

petitioner is able to lurk in the back of this trailer, has
the advantage of lights on so that he can silhouette, pick
out his target.

He used what was sailed an over and under

17
shotgun combination rifle*

That means he could have use the

rifle, but he chose instead to use the shotgun*

And it is

pretty hard at five or six feet to miss with broad pattern
of a shotgun,
Q

What gauge was it?

MR* DUNSMOREs
20 gauge.

1 am not too sure.

1 think it was a

I believe that is a 20 gauge over and under*

But

he had that option,,
Q

Do you think that option made all the dif­

ference in the world in this case under your statute?
MR. DUNSMOREs
too sure*

Mr. Justice Blackraun, no, 1 am not

But 1 think it is an essential fact because I think

what makes this case outrageously and wantonly vile and
inhuman is the cold-blooded e calculated course of action
which the petitioner embarked in from the beginning with an
avowed purpose to cause death*

The type of Weapon ha used la

evidence ©f his intention of inflicting a fatal injury.
Q

You can say about the same thing of any pre­

meditated murder, can you not?
MR. DUNSMOREs

Yes* but the statute, the seventh

aggravating statute, as defined by our court in Harris *
looks to, as they said* the core'—not the core, but the
core cases like Pitlis, like they used in State v„ Dixon
in Florida.

We are not. looking at a common killing * as

Mr. Chief Justice Burger suggested

We are looking at a

18
killing where there was sm avowed, a conscientious decision
inade some time even before he arrived at the trailer to
inflict grievous bodily harm.
Q

Now—*

Is not this always in first degree murder?

MR. DUNSMOREs

That is true, but this seventh

aggravating circumstance looks at the more heinous aspecta
of it.

Now, there can b® acme overlapping—»
Q

Mill you give res a motive that is not heinous?

MR. DUNSMOREs

I think that they are all--the

taking of any life would be-"Q

No, X mean first degree murder.

MR. DUNSMOREs

No.

They are senseless killings,

but some are more senseless than others, particularly when
there is no avenue of escapei that is, there is no right to
defend, no opportunity to defend against this course of
action at all.
Q

Do you not make your point when you say he

planned it for & year in advance and after the event said
that he would do it again if he had the chance'?
MR. DUNSMOREs
making our point, sir.

Q

I believe that goes a far way in
I really do.

All murders air© not accompanied by that kind

of before and after sequence, are they?
MR. DUNSMOREs

That is correct.

And 2 think that

is what makes this case so outrageously and wontonly vile.

19
For example, the outrageous nature of the case is the fact
that it is heinous and atrocious and it offends human
standards on the basis that an individual-“these individualshad no opportunity to defend thesis®Ives»

We have the wan-

tcnness, that is, the aspect of the merciless killing where
he comes in a trailer, a small area*

We certainly do have

torture in the terms of the anticipation of death, as we
argued in our brief, which is a mental torture," I think the
statute could include that»

had our supreme court in the

Floyd case, involving an armed robbery, double execution
style killing, where the mother and daughter were separated
for the purposes of determining where the money was in the
house, paraded the individual© around the house, and then
before the second killing the daughter witnesses her mother
being killed, knowing that she is next on the list, so to
speak*

And in this ease the evidence shows that when the

wife was shot in the head—and 2 think that is another point
that shows premeditation»

Both victims were shot in the

head, not like trying to get them out of the way or just to
do some injury to them*
Q

Sn intent—

Mr» Dunsmore, could I ask two questions, one

on the deliberate character of it?

That is essential element

of the offense itself, is it not?
MR» DUNSMOKSs
Q

That is correct»

The second question 2 had is the charge of the

20
court directed the jury to designate in writing the aggra­
vating circumstance®, the circumstances which you found
beyond reasonable doubt»

And the next page? o£ the record

shows the form of verdict they returned, and it says that
the offense of murder was outrageously or wantonly vile,
horrible, and inhuman,, and does not go on and say it
involved depravity of mind and the like»

The question I am

unclear on is, Is this the jury’s language or is this a form
that the judge gave to them, that was pretyped and they just
signed?
MR. DUNSMOREs

I believe that this was the form

that was given to them by the--and prepared by the prosecutor»
Q

Is that a proper form?

I wonder why it. did not

track the language of the statute and the language of the
instruction then„
MR. DUNSMORE:

I do not know0

But on page 79 the

judge instrue tr *> ~
Q

Seventy-nine of what?

MR» DUNSMORE%

Of the appendix--instructed the

complete language of the statute,
Q

That was given orally, but the instruction did

not go to the jury in. writing, did it?
MR. DUNSMORE;

It usually does.

Q

I see,

Does it?

MR. DUNSMORE%

And that is the proceeding that

21
usually goes out in writing because they must designate.
.tod it is a possibility,, for example, in some cases more than
one statutory aggravating circumstance may be submitted to
the jury.

For example„ it is conceivable under the facts in

this case that they could have found in the course of one of
the murders.
Q

The other question, just so I will get it all

out and you have the time to comment on it* at the top of
page 36, which is the part of the judge°s form, which
apparently accompanies the record on appeal, the defense of
murder—and he strikes—-the tilings that he instructed the

jury on.

It says, “The offense of murder"—then he strikes

some language out—“was outrageously or wantonly vile,
horrible ‘'-“-and he changes "or* to “and inhuman in that it
involved torture" arid so forth.
under the

So you see that first one

there?
MR. DUNSMORE:
Q

Yes, sir.

And then there are brackets around the first

part of it, and the brackets correspond with the jury's
verdict, and the remainder corresponds with the instruction.
Is it fair to infer that those brackets were inserted by the
judge?
MR. DUNSMOREs

I think that is the only thing that

we could infer.
Q

Do you attach any significance to that?

22

MR. DUNSMOREj

The only significance that—“I do not

attach any significance to it other than the fact--and I
cannot explain why he may have put those there--other than
maybe it was a mental exercise, arid he was trying to parrot
the jury9s finding, as appears on page 80 of the appendix.
In examining this case as to the—
Q

Could I just interrupt you one mere—-in con­

nection with Mr. Justice Stevens9 inquiry, certainly on
pages 80 and 81 the presence of the alternative at the top
on each page, to fix the punishment at life, would indicate
that this is a printed form of some kind or at least a
typed form submitted to the jury,

had what is your Georgia

lav/ when he instructs that they shall designate in writing
the aggravating circumstances and they do not other than to
use the form?
MR. DUHSMOREs

I am not too sure I understand your

question, Mr. Justice Blackmun.
Q

Do you feel the jury in returning that form

in each case complied with the instructions that you shall
designate in writing the aggravating circumstances which you
found beyond a reasonable doubt?

I do not see any circum­

stances designated other than stating that the offense of
murder was outrageously or wantonly vile.
MR. DCJNSMOREs

I think they did comply with it.

And the reason I say they complied with it, in that they

23
found or the instruction was submitted to them in this form—*
X think there are two reasons why or basically one reason
perhaps why they should designate in writing and why the
court also submits for them, for their guidance.

And that

probably is that when jurors are given instructions, there is
a lot that they have to remember.

In a death case, we want

to make sure that the jury’s discretion is channeled and
that they find within the terms of whatever aggravating
circumstance or circus*stances are are given to them.

And l

believe, that is generally the reason why the prosecutors

That is what the trial judge thought in his mind.

It is his reflection.

He qualifies it, saying there is

definitely physical harm, to the victims.

And I think the

record more than adequately establishes that by virtue of
the nature of the wounds to these two victims.

We have

argued and still maintain, consistently maintain, that the
Supreme Court of Georgia when it conducts its review, as
mandated by our general assembly, carefully goes over the
facts to make sure that they are supported by a reasonable
doubt, compares them with similar cases, and then also looks
to determine whether or not there has been any arbitrariness
or discrimination or prejudice in the case.
We have had the argument by petitioner that (b)(7),
the seventh aggravating circumstance, is a catch-all.

And

yet we have had language by our court in Harris which looked
for guidance from the Dixon case.

And we are going to look

32

at the essential, the hardcore, the gruesome type, execution
type slayings.
Q

What would you say in a case, of the so-called

clean rifle shot to the heart, just bang, and the prosecutor
nevertheless relies on (7} as an aggravating circumstance,
and the jury comes back and finds it?
MR. DUNSMOSE:
Q

All right, I think—

Would you say—and there is an Eighth Amend™

aggravating circumstance can cover this, it can cover any­

And this is why I say we are not.

On what, ground?

But I do not think we have to get

that far because I think in their review to date* they have—
all of the cases which have come before it have been horrible
crimes.
Q

But how about this one?

MR. DUNSMOREs

I think this is; as horrible and

maybe more horrible than others that have.

you and think that on the facts of this case this is way
out of line with' what the Georgia Supreme Court has done in
other eases?

Let us just suppose that®

MR® DUNSMORE:

All right.

As 1 read the question

posed in -this case, if you disagreed that this case—the
infliction of the death penalty was not outrageously, wantonly
and vile, then what you would—
Q

Q

35
Q

We have to accept that it does»

MR. DUNSMOREs

Right.

And if it fits within that

meaning, then you should affirm on the basis of the facts
presented in the case.

If I understand you—and maybe I do

not understand your question correctly, but if you assume
that the Supreme Court of Georgia is correct, the facts show
conduct which is outrageously and wantonly and vile and that
they have not too broadly construed what is an outrageous,
wanton, and vile and inhuman killing—
Q

That is the question.

That is the question for

Sighfch Amendment purposes, I suppose.
MR. DimSMOKEs
Q

I think—I think—

We cannot say that they misconstrued their

statute.
MR. DONSHOREs
Q

I agree with you.-.

We cannot say that.

They are in charge of

construing the statute.
MR. DUNSMOREs
Q

That is correct.

.and these facts, whatever they are, wa have to

accept as being deemed outrageously wanton arid vile by the
Supreme Court of Georgia.
MR. DUNSMQREs

I do not think .we have an Eighth

Amendment problem because 1 think the facts show—
Q

No, you do not, but that is the question that

was posed to be argued here.

36

MR. DUNSMORE s

Our position is we do not have an

Eighth Amendment position or an argument against it in this
aspect because this is & crime which comes down in a well
defined set of circumstances, controlled discretion in the
statute, appellate review channeling, making sure that the
jury does not go off on some tangent within the state's right
to prescribe the death penalty for certain standards of conduct, particularly where the defendant from the beginning has
engaged in that course of conduct where he intends, fra® the
outset, to take the victim’s life, different from the fact
that ha gees in and he robs a store and he says, "Gee, this
guy might be able to identify me."

So, at that point.

Here we have before he even gets to his intended
victim the intent.
Q

Mr. Dunsmore, could I ask you a question about

the way the Georgia.Court construes the statute?

Are the

words "in that it involved tozrture, depravity of mind, and
aggravated battery" still part of the essential definition
of of this aggravated circumstance, in your judgment?
MR. DUNSMORE!
Q

No, I think—

1 read that out of the statute.

MR. DUNSMORE i

—in Harris they have—in Harris

they said, "We view the words ’outrageously, wantonly vile*
as applying to the conduct of the defendant, his act"—
0

Right.

37
MR. DUNSMORE 3

—’’and also as its impact upon the

victim/3 which is illustated or exemplified by either tor­
ture , aggravated battery or depravity of mind„
Q

You regard those as illustrative words rather

than limiting words?

HR. DUNSMOREs
0

That is correct,

And of course when the Court in the Gregg;

case considered the statute, I think the Court, assumed that
those were limiting words.

Would that not be?

I do not

know if we really had to reach that,

MR, DUNSMORE:

You did not reach it.

And I would

be speculating if I~
Q

We should then construe the statute just as

though those words were not in it at all.

-And, if that is

true, then I suppose the bloody character of the shotgun
killing could make it vile,
MR, DUNSMORE:

I think there is no question about

it,
Q

So, you would rely on the fact that it was a

shotgun rather than a rifle to justify the finding of-~
MR. DUNSMORE:

No question.

He had the choica

between the weapons, and 1 think the vileness is shown.

He

picked the weapon which xfould do the greatest damage because
it blew both their heads off or literally reduced them to
a pulp

38
Q

So, then the constitutional problem is whether

a statute which just in broad language says any murder, rape,
armed robbery, or kidnapping that is outrageously or wantonly
vile, horrible, or inhuman, period, is enough to be an
aggravated circumstance«
MR0 DUNSMQKE:

That would be correct.

And 1 say

that it would because those words are sufficient enough to
put a defendant on notice as to what conduct is to be
defended against, and they are also words—
Q

2 do not know how they put him on notice if

you say they are just illustrative and you.say anything else
somewhat similar is also going to be covered»
MR. DUNSMOREs

2 think the essential words of the

statute are what the jury found and what the Georgia Supreme
Court has said, particularly in view of the Holton case
wh -re they just had depravity of mind.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Holmes?
REUBTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. CALLOWAY HOLMES, JR., ESQ.r
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOLMES:

Yes, Your Honor.

I would like to make

a couple of points that were raised during the questioning
on the Gregg case.■ The first point that I would like to make
is that we take the position very strongly that the Gregg

39
case did net hold Section <b)(?) constitutionale

There was

a limiting footnote in that case, footnote No - 51 that
referred to limited grant of certiorari in that case, which
was limited to the question of whether the death penalty in
that case was unconstitutional.

In that case, even though

Section (b)(7) was charged, it was not found.

The Court in

responding to the arguments of counsel that Section (b)(7)
could apply to any murder, the Court said in part it is of
course arguable that s\ny murder involves depravity of, mind
or an aggravated battery.
construed in this way.

But this language need not be

And there is no reason to assume

that the Supreme Court of Georgia will adopt such an openended construction.

Q

Where do you find that in Gregg?

1 have

Gregg in front of ms.
MR. HOLMES 3
Q

Oh, it is in the text, I see, at page 201.

MR. HOLMESs
brief.

That is 96 Supreme Court 2309 at 2938.

It is recorded in page 21-22 of the

Footnote 51 X think indisat.es that Section (h) (?)

was considered in that, case only to the extent they considered
the attack against the entire system.

So, I do not believe

the Court has really decided that question.. But this ques­
tion is somewhat somewhat narrower because this question is
limited to how the court, the Supreme Court of Georgia, has
construed Section £b)(7).

They have construed it, as conceded

40
by the state e to really only include outrageously or wantonly
vile, horrible;, and inhuman* tod another case., I think the
Blake v, State■■ case, has said that outrageously and wantonly
only modify vile, and they do not modify horrible and inhuman*
tod since the statute is couched in disjunctive terms, that
means that a jury would be authorised to find the death
penalty in Georgia ©a a finding that the murder was horrible®
That is why we say that the open-ended construction

that this

Court was not willing to assume that the Georgia Supreme Court
would adopt has in fact bean adopted,

tod the facts of this

case with reference in the brief to ‘the 42 to 45 other
domestic murder cases in Georgia that have been appealed
where life sentences were granted, of those there has been
no death penalty®

Many of those cases—they are indicated in

the brief—are similar on the facts to this Godfrey case,
including two or three multiple murders»
0

Suppose you look back over the history of

the oversight of the sentencing by the Georgia Supreme Court
and you find that in every single one, up until this one,
when the seventh aggravating circumstance is relied on, any
guy in his right mind would think it was an outrageous crime
and it was really bad.

tod let us assume that you would

agree that in every one but this one, until this one, the
Georgia Supreme Court had applied the seventh aggravating
circumstance in that way *

1's that what you are suggesting

41
they have until this on©?

You have just said there are an

awful lot of them where they had life sentences on facts
like these.
MR» HOLMES:

That is what the jury dido

The

Georgia Supreme Court in no case lias found that the death
penalty was not warranted on the facts, particularly under
Section (b)(7).

What if, following Mr. Justice White8®

question, all of the casea affirming death penalties in
Georgia under aggravating circumstances, number seven, had
been like McCorquodale except this on®?
MR a HOLMES;

Your Honor,, if they had been, I

believe that I have to agree that that is included, the
he- crible torture murder is probably or necessarily what was
intended to be reached.

But. because if you. assume that they

had all been that horrible and then this one comes along,
really the Georgia Supreme Court has, under that hypothesis,
never had an occasion yet to demonstrate how they did con­
strue this section.,
Q

Until this one.

MR. HOLMES:

Until this one.

This one shows that

they construe it to indicate any first degree murder where
the jury has imposed the death sentence,
Q

Has the; prosecution carried its burden if it

shows that the circumstances and facts of the particular

case

Q

If the facts show that it fits any one of them*

even though as a practical matter we know—-probably I do—
if it fits one, it is likely to fit more.

But if it just

fits one, does that not meet the prosecution1s burden?
MR. HOLMESs

Your Honor, X would agree that if it

fits one, it would fit. all of them.

And in Blake v. Stars

that is really what the Georgia Supreme Court held»
Q

If it fits one* has the prosecution met its

burden under the statute?
MR. HOLMESs

In theory, yea.

Under this case, no.

For one thing, I do not know how it could meet the burden of
proving something-sore murder was horrible beyond a reason­
able doubt.

But in another case they created that

category in order to uphold a Section (b)(7).

of those.

Q

Are you saying that a not-for-profit death by

I could not say that it could not fit

because our point is that anything--any characterisation of
a first degree murder could fit within Section (b.) (7) .
Q

Are you saying that if the Georgia Supreme

Court says a non-for-profit, gangland, execution type killing
fits, any first degree murder fits even though it is a clean
rifle shot?
MR. HOLMES:
this category.

Mo, Your Honor.

They have created

Our point is to—in order to—under the

statute—they have a duty under the statute to compare these
death sentence cases with similar cases, and they have in the
past said that that will be determined by the—what juries

44
have done in similar oases in Georgia before.

So, they have

ignored the category to which this properly belongs, domestic
murders with a great deal of emotional and psychological
diminished capacity.

In taking it arid putting it into another

category where they can compare with 15 cases cited in the
appendix and say that that is similar, they are using the
similar word under the sentence review in a very elastic
manner in order to uphold these Section (b)(7).

And they do

not compare Section (b)(7) cases with only other Section
»

(b)(7) cases.

In this case there are only two of the 15

cited as similar that were Section Cb)(7) only.

Tha rest of

them were (b)(2), rape, armed robbery murders.

MR. HOLMESs

1 think Justice White pointed out in

aggravating circumstance guidelines, there was the additional
sentence review to foe conducted by the Georgia Supreme .Court,
which would foe an additional safeguard against capricious
arid arbitrary infliction of the death sentence.
