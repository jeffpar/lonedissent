MR.' CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. GilIani*, I think yeu

may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAX L. GILLAM, JR., ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. GILLAMs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court?
The issue before the Court posed by this appeal is
a, narrow, very simple issue® ■ This arises on an appeal from
a judgment of the 'California Supremo Courts
First a trial court's rejection ©f

a

request for an

injunction that the PruneYard and its owner Fred Sahadi be
enjoined from denying access to its customers.

In other words

the -Appellees here moved for an injunction in the lower court
enjoining Mr. Sahadi from refusing to allow them to circulate
petitions or. his property.
for

:m

injunction..

There was a trial of this request

Speed fie findings we're made; by the trial

court -as to the existence cf adequate available alternatives
in that Santa Clara County.

This was coupled with a conclusion
i

of law framed in basically the term»-' of Lloyd y. Tanner to
the effect that other effective means of communication existed
in. the community.
The denial of the injunction was affirmed by the
District Court of Appeals and when the case reached the
California Supreme Court,' that Court reversing its prior

4

holding in what is adverted to in the brief as Diamond 2,
asserted the free speech portion of the California Constitution,
required a reversal of the trial court and the admission to
\

Mr» Sahadi*s premises of the persons who wished to circulate

petitions®
\

This Court, as it did in the Miami Herald case,
deferred a question of jurisdiction until the time of the' hearing
on the merits.
We would «•«* we have briefed pursuant to this Court’s
Rule 16 «*" at the outset of our brief, the jurisdictional
question.

It sasass obvious that the decision below upheld

the validity of a free speech portion of the California
Constitution against a contention that the construction sought
of that constitutional prevision denied Mr. Sahadi and the
PruneYard their rights under the Fifth, Fourteenth and First
Amendments•
We would therefore submit that appeal is the proper
remedy, that these is Federal jurisdiction and not insubstantial
Federal jurisdiction and that in the alternative, as we requested
in our jurisdictional statement, if this Court should feel that
appeal was not the proper route to please accept certiorari.
I stated at th© outset that this was a simple narrow — it does not involve any attempt to regulate the
content of speech.

It does not relate to any ability on toe

part of Mr. Sahadi to deny his shopping center customers the

5

receipt of any - view which the Appellees would choose to put
upon them.
•She adequate available alternatives finding we think
is extremely important when it is coupled with the finding that
the policy against solicitation was uniformly .and disinterest­
edly applied by the Center*,
2 would like to call your attention to -the specific
finding on adequate alternatives in Santa Clara County.

The

finding of fact which was entered by the trial court and which
was never contested at the trial or any appellant level was
stated in the following manners

The county in which the

Center is located has many shopping centers # public shopping
and business areas, public buildings, parks, stadia,
univ rsikiesf colleges, schools, post offices and similar
public areas whore large numbers of people congregate and where
people can freely exorcise First Amendment rights including,
without limitat,ion, distribution of hand bills and seeking
signatures on petitions»
QUESTION;

Do I understand that you can distribute

hand bills in pest offices?
MR. GILLAMj
QUESTIONf
MR. GXLLM2;
QUESTIONS'
MR» GXIiLAMc

On the sidewalks adjoining post offices»
Well, you said buildings.
Yea, sir.
Now I understand»
Mr» Justice Marshall, I think it is

6

important to focus on this from the standpoint of language you
used in Hudgens, because we read your opinion in Hudgens as
being concerned with the availability of the means for
communicating ideas0
It didn't involve post offices0

QUESTIONj

MR* GILLAMs

Yes* sir? it did not.

But we think this is a. very key finding of fact
/

which,

I say, was never challengeds

And the conclusion of

law ...which then followed after the trial was never challenged»
And that' conclusion was that there are adequate effective
channels of communication for Plaintiffs other than soliciting
property of this Center»
.-

The Center was capital C and it was

That is the state of the record, which is

before the Court in. this case»
QUESTIONs

Well, Mr. Gillam, couldn't you equally

well attack a. seeing ordinance by saying that there; are other
places . yen couM'build this seme'kind;'of factory sad therefor©
the State's prohibition of your it here -is unconstitutional?
MR. GILis&M:

No, sir*

I would -assume' that there

could be a set of circumstances• or facts'which might permit
you that kind ©£ attack.

I cannot conceive them &b I sit here

right now» ■ I knew that Agins v. Tiberon is doming up on this

7
Court*® docket, which deals with a similar question of whether
after engaging in a condemnation proceeding and running cut of
money the city of Tiber on, could then sone the land it was
prepared to condemn»
• So under certain circumstances I think you could mate
that argument»

But ordinarily speaking, the right to gone

would not involve anything with respect to the property right
to the extent that is at issue in this case»
QUESTIONS

Isn’t it basically the Mahon v» Peimsylvani

Coal.case, that the State can limit the use of privata property
©r place'certain restrictions on it up to a point»

But if it

virtually destroys its us® or comes close, to significantly
destroying its use, then it has to pay just compensation»
And it is kind of a hard line to draw?
MR» QlhltMiz

I do not believe that it would have to

g© to fch® extent to which the Court refers in virtually destroy­
ing the values of ‘the land as in & condemnation case, soning is
an effective condemnation»
This Court in determining whs titer an interest which
the Statu has denominated mi -interest in property or the nonexistence of it has historically applied Federal standards to
determine whether that which' whs involved -constituted property»
And imposing a new legal disability on any prior freedom or
property invites Federal examination.

The situation' her® is

that with respect to soliciting at shopping centers the1

u
California Supreme Court in reliance on this Court’s opinion
in Logan Valley had held that the shopping center could not
exclude expressive activity*
Subsequent to this Court's opinion in Lloyd va

Tanner the California Supreme Court reversed that position end
held that the shopping centers could under the Federal principle
of Lloyd vc Tanner exclude expressive activity of this type
on the assumption if -*« 1 should say — if there were adequate
available opportunities in the eoiajaunity for expressive
activity*
It was only in this case in which the California
Supreme Court by a 4 to 3 majority changed that rule and* in
effect, deprived Mr» Sahadi of what had been regarded as a
property right up to that time,
QUESTION:

This fall under the' California Constitution.

MR, GILLAM a
QUESTION:
provision

Yes, sir,
Did that under the California Cons tit utienai

do you feel that an affirmande here will necessitate

an overruling of Lloyd v0 Tanner?
MR, GILLAMt

It would not necessitate an over®»

ruling of the precis® holding in Lloyd.

However, it would

necessitate an overruling or a refusal to apply the principles
which formed the underpinning of the Lloyd decision. . The
quescion in Llcyd really is whether 'the shopping center was such

9

a creature of the State or the equivalent of a municipality
as to the position cf the State for First Amendment purposes 0
That is -tiie specific issue that was before Lloyd*
QUESTIONs

And if the Center isn’t an am of the

State c why no matter how many free speech rights the individual
has he hasn't got them against a private person.?
HR. GILLAM:

On the assumption that this Court

applies the principles as articulated in Lloyd* and that is
that there are adequate available alternativesThat is part
of the atraly s la on the closeness of a shopping center to the
Stat
QUESTION 2

But in Lloyd and Hudgens the people who

wanted to distribute .leaflets were coming here simply claiming
that the First and Fourteenth Amendments gave them that
right*

Here you are saying that property law gives them that

right*

They don’t have to rely on the Federal Constitution.
MR. GILLAM:

No* sir* and this is a new found

California property right which is asserted against what this
'

Court historically viewed' as

%

Federal due process and First

Amendment'; rights.
QUESTION:' .Xfc-may be-new-'fblind but haven* t we
V;

historically attributed to State law the boundaries of property
rights?

X sympathize with you when you 'get. a

to 3 decision

in your court, with very strong —
v.

^

MR. GXLL&Ms

v

The interests are created by

State

10

law»

There is no question about that,

But their characteri­

zation as property for due processes' is determined by Federal
standards *
QUESTIONS

Well- suppose a man owns a shopping

••

center or a grocery store or soma tiling and there are no relevant
statutes at all and someone comes in and wants to pass out
leaflets and ho says, "'Get off my property»58

And he can throw

them off* ©van if the fellow says* KI have got — just think
of my speech rights» "

And he says* “Tell it to -the State* it

protects you against State interference»

You just get out of

my place»*
What if there is then a statute passed by the State
that s ay a -that all owners of shopping centers will -- must 1st
onto their property people who want to picket their lessees?
■ MR* GXLLAMs
QUESTIONS

X think* Your Honor —
And then the State has some power to

regulate property rights»
MR» GILLMIs

Yes, Mr, Justice White, they do have

power to regulate property rights but they do' not have the
power ia an unreasonable manner and subject to the Federal test

on what constitutes property, -the right to talc.® away» - May I
give an sxample?
QUESTION*

Well* just forget that»

there is no Federal interest yet whatsoever»

Ir my example
There is just a

State law that says 'that let pickefcers com© on your property»

11
MRo GILLAM:

What basically this Court talked about

la Lloyd and in Hudgens and Eabcock and Wilcox and -the labor
cases is what kind of accommodation must there be between
statutory matters such as -set forth in the NLRA and the interest
of the property owner or in this case the speaker or nonspeaker®

tod this Court in those decisions has sought for an

accommodation such that the historic rights of propertyt the
things generally associated with property, would not foe
diluted except to the extent necessary to fulfill idle purposes
of the Act, in th® NLR& industrial peace®
.Ahd this Court has consistently, aw, looked, to
adequate available alternatives before stating that the union
could enter onto private property either for organisational
activity or for picketing and protest of -a strike®
■ QUESTIONs

So you are just saying that if a State

had a statute like I just suggested that it would be
unconstitutional aa its face®
MR® GXLLAMs

Nc«f sir, it would not be unconstitutional

on ifcs face „
QUESTION3
MR. GXLLAMs

Well, for failure to foe more precise®
X can anticipate the possibility of a

small State such as Shod© Island holding legislative hearings
and having testimony of fact appear before it and the
legislature coming to factual conclusions in the legislative
history to the effect that in the absence of access to shopping

12
centers there were no alternative available opportunities to
persons for expressive activity.
We have the exact opposite in this case*

The

California «QUESTION:

Would that Rhode Island conclusion mean

that the Rhode Island legislature was mandated to put a
limitation on property rights or only that it could?
MR* GXLLAMt

It would only indicate that it could*

That would not, 2 hasten to add# immunize it from attack by
somebody who differed with that conclusion»
But in this case California used an absolutist
simplistic label of "Shopping Center" and used statistics that
indicated that shopping centers had increased greatly*

But

they were faced with a finding of fact and conclusion of law
below as to the existence of quantities of available adequate
alternatives and a conclusion that effective means ©f
communication for expressive activity existed outside ©f Mr.,
SahaQi®s shopping center*
QUESTION:

Yon would take the same approach if there

was a statute which says at Christmastime the Salvation Army
and other charitable organizations may set up little stands to
raise money in shopping centers?
MR* GILLAMs

Yen» sir*. 1 would certainly take tho

s azaa pos i fci on *
'• 2 would analogis® that to Wooley -v* Maynard*

13

QUESTION:

That the State is dis-en titled under its

many powers to limit your property rights to that extent?
MR. GILLAM:

Yes, sir, absent some adequate basis

■which would indicate that accommodations of conflicting rights
would require a diminution in my free speech rights and in my
property rights.
QUESTIONi

Are you relying in this case on tine free

speech rights of the property owner?
MR. GILLAMs

Yes, sir.

This was raised before the

California Supreme Court in —
QUESTIONS

That you don't need to provide a forum

for views with which you don®t agree?
MR. GILLAM?

No, sir, the same that we are not

required to speak, that we had a constitutional right to remain
silent.
Remember -the finding in the lower court that Mr,
Sahaii had a uniform policy against any form of non-businessrelated expressive activity.

And we asserted his right to remain

silent and to not permit his property to be utilised for the
expression of any ideas.
QUESTION*

Under this opinion as it stands new of the

California Supreme Court, if 25 different groups wanted to hand
out leaflets or get petitions signed on the same Saturday, could
they do it?
MR. GILLAMs

Under this ©pinion each shopping center

14

is directed to be a municipality and pick out reasonable places
and manners»

And I assume if it was a shopping center that:

was sufficiently profitable so that it could employ lawyers
the lawyers could come, up with a set of such standards which
would permit it to limit the number at any given time or any
place»
QUESTION*

Sort of a licensing program?

taa. GXLLAM*
QUESTION *

Ytes, sir»
Like for a parade?

MR. GXLL&Ms

What the California Supreme Court h&i

done is stake every shopping canter, however labeled, the
functional equivalent of a municipality»
QUESTIONs

Didn't the Supreme Court say they could

establish, reasonable regulations?
ME. {ULLAM:
QUESTION>

Yes,- sir»

The same way —

iMd wouldn't ''the, reasonable regulation be

that you have got 25. -groups--at one time it wouldn't be possible
for us to run our business?
' •

MR. GILIAM:
QUESTION5

Yea, sir»
Wouldn't that be considered reasonable?

MR. GILLAMs
QUESTION*

I would think it would, Your Honor»
But X suppose seine content differentiation

wouldn't be- '-reasonable.»

If he said, "Well, there er© some

people 1 will let os 'say- property but some people X just don?t

agree with.®

15
MR. CILLAM;

In the California Supreme Court opinion

there is no control ewer content at all.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. GXLLAMs

f
Also implicit is no right to remain
*

silent9 even if there are adequate alternatives available.
It is ©ur contention , Your Honors , that under the;
opinion of the California Supreme Court the supremacy clause
stops at the California border.

And wa would respectfully

request 'that this Court reverse that opinion.
QUESTION:

Where did the Supreme Court say this

activity could take place, in the public areas in the mall?
MR, GXLLAM:

Areas in the Shopping Center that

constituted private property, subject to «safeenable' regulation
as to time, place and manner,

MR, GXLLAM;

What about in' -idle stores?

It didn't say?

No indication, sir,

-Under the reasoning of the California, Supreme Court

if I were to hold a garage sal® -r ■

QUESTIONS

You -can go into the storea? you can go

into the stores and hand out leaflets?
MR, GXLLAM:

I am not certain, because it is not

clear.
But if I ware to hold a garage sale and open it tothe. public, there is' no way as I view the logic of this opinion
that I could keep out a saffron-robed bookseller.

It is part

16

of the -Hari.''Krishna religion to sell books0
QUESTIONS

I misunderstood you,,

I thought you said

a minute ago it is limited to shopping centers,
MR, GILLAMs
.

QUESTION#

Tlie California Supreme Court *—
You didnJt say that?

I misunderstood you*

then,
MR, GILL&Ms

No, sir, they said shopping centers,

And they quoted in their opinion. Judge Newman, the portion of
Judge Kosk’s prior dissent in Diamond Zf in which he stated
this is not feo Bay that these rules would apply to modest retail
establishments or private hemes.
That is the only indication we have.

But if I have

a garage sal© at my private house, by the logic of the California
Supreme Court I have invited people -onto my property to purchase,
And I don’t know what a amodest retail establishment* is,
When X am in Los Angeles I work in -Idle Bank of America Tower,
Perhaps the Bank of America would be regarded as an immodest
commercial establishment because there are three floors of
stores in there,
QUESTION;

I also think that Madison Square Garden ”

would not be, too, but that doesn’t have anything to do with
this case,
MR* GILLAMs

Ye®, sir, esccept for the fact that -under

the logic of the Supreme Court if you are conducting a business
you must permit oppressive activity, as X read it, because

17

there is no definition of a shopping center*
QUESTION:

Would, that include a dentist’s office?

■ MR. GILLAMs
QUESTION3

Sir?
Would that include a dentist's office?

MR. GXLLAM:

If he invites tine public, I would have

to assume that it would.
QUESTION;

Hr. Gillem, I don't really read the

California Suprema Court opinion quite as broadly as that.
This case involves a 21-acre shopping center.

And I just wanted •

to ask you, is it your position that if there were a California
v

statute or a

5

California zoning regulation that said in all

shopping centers of over .70 acres there must be allowed a
reasonable opportunity for picketing or leafieting, that that
would be unconstitutional?
MR* GILLSiMs
QUESTION;

Yes. sir.

It could happen —

If we don’t make any findings about

adequate alternatives «MR* GILLAMs
QUESTION s

Yes, sir.
*—» that would be on its face an unjustified

interference of property rights.
MR* GILLAMs

If I could go before a court arid

establish as a fast in an adversary proceeding that 2C acres
was an unreasonable limitation because with respect to my
property there were adequate available alternatives? I would
think it would be unconstitutional in its application to me

.18

because 1 would think that in that case there •—
QUESTIONS

Would you say the same tiling about a

statute that said that union picketing is — shall be permitted
in shopping centers over this size?
MR. GILLAM:

That is one .interesting aspect of the

,

California Supreme Court opinion

because under this opinion

now union picketing would bo allowed, which would not be
permitted under -She National Labor Relations Acte

And you are

going to have an interesting pre-emption question that you will,
have to face in the future, assuming the California SupremeCourt opinion stands„

Mr. Hammer»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP L. HAMMER, ESQ» ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR» HAMMER:

Mr® Chief Justice, and may it pleases

the Court:
The California Supreme Coiart has ruled in this case
(

that the State constitution protects the right of individuals

to 3o.licit' signatures on a petition to their government on the
premises of a privately-owned shopping center.

We contend

19

that the United States Constitution does not prohibit the State
of California from so regulating the use of private property
within its borders, sines the California Supreme Court
specifically found that the public welfare would be substantially
impaired if that right were denied,,
QUESTION;

Is this confined in your view to petitions

to the government?
MR, HAMMER;

Weil, the reference_by the California

Supreme Court was to Article 1, Section 3, which is our State
constitutional right of petition to our government? yes, sir0
That is «*QUESTION;

What, if on its face it was a petition to

the government but in fact that was spurious?- that it really
was just a propaganda measure, in favor of the PLQ, let us say?
or the Irish Republican Asray?
MR. HAMMER;

Well, I do»*t know whether such petitions

would on their face be spurious but a —» the right of California
cititans to petition their government, which consists of goi’em*
ment at many levels, is a very vital right and the petitioning
/
in this case •»»
QUESTIONs

Do you think that California under our

system h&3 'anything t© do with relations with the PLO or the

IRA?
MR. HAMMERS

Well, the State government may not

although the Stata government may declare itself on inter-

20

national issues»

The petitions in this case were addressed to

the national Government, to President Ford and to Congress»
We are seeking to uphold the right to petition in
California»

Our Supreme Court’s decision stresses the very

vital nature of that right in the California scheme of things»
In our State,perhaps different from other places, 'the citizen
uses the petition for direct access to the process of selfgovernment»

In recant times the people have seen fit to

restructure the property tax base for financing local govern­
ment t they have adopted a protective mechanism for our coast­
line and have enacted far-reaching campaign reforms, just to
mention a few.
QUESTION:

Is this related to your tradition of

public referenda on many, many issues?
MR. HAMMER:

Yes, sir, that is in California referenda,

initiatives, recall and simply the broad right to petition
government is a part of cur life.
The Supreme Court determined that the right of
petition is threatened if it is not accessible in the common
areas of shopping canters®
• -

Here also the decision of our highest court goes to

great pains to describe, how vital that access'is.

Shopping

canters dominate retail commerce in 'our State and particularly
the community in which this" case- arose.

The traditional forums

for publics discussion, the public streets, town squares, public

21
parks and the like are dead or fast dying,

As the California

court found7 central business districts of municipalities have
yielded -their functions to suburban shopping centers 0

Having

cause the demise of the traditional forum in California and
reasonable access to a forum having bean found essential to
the public welfare, shopping canters in California are as a
result of the decision in this casse subject t© a rule of law
prohibiting them from denying -the right to circulate a petition,
subject of course fc© the reasonable restrictions as to time,
place and manner*
QUESTION:

Nothing on content, though,

MR* HAMMERS
QUESTION;

Nothing on content*
iih&t if a shopping canter was owned by

a church organisation —
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTIONs

Ies0
—- let us say the Archdiocese of San

Francisco, if 'that is an- archdiocese, and the petitions are
#
petitions that are pro-abortion or 'seise other issue which in
directly in conflict with the philosophy and dogma of the cwner.
What is the situation und&r the. California decision?
MR. HAMMER:

Well, sir, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I

think that -that is a different situation but it is on® that
the California. Supreme —* it might raise a conflict between
two rights- that- are not present in 'this case.

And the California

Supreme Court or 'the State- court system Would be well-equipped

22
under its constitution and under tlte Constitution of the United
Statas to resolve what might b© a conflict of rights if the
center war© well known as being a place owned by a religious

body*
In this — in the situation that the Court is review­
ing' here of course there :1s no such identification.
QUESTIONs

I suppose it is the same kind of a conflict

on content slight arise if, for example, an international union
owned a 21-asr® shopping center* which it might as a matter of
invr. ; tinea t.
What would you say then about the right to work.
petitions for'the right to work

/

which are certainly in’^conflict,

with organised labor's views, must they allow them or not kinder
this decision?
MR. HAMMER*

I til ink under this Court's deed si or,

no matter who owns the shopping center the rule applies within
California.

2 pointed to the religious ownership problem a-M

one that might raise, other constitutional issues.
But I think implicit in what the Appellant is trying
to argue with respect to its First Amendment right is that
somehow the Shopping Center is in the communications business
as to ideas and that
QUESTIONS

He is just, suggesting the owner objects

to presenting a, forum or a pedes tal for views that he doesi:91
necessarily agree with, or for any views.

Isn't that a perfectly

23
legitimate claim by the property owner?
MR. HAMMER:

The property owner may object to the

regulation that is now applicable in California as a result

Of *““* •
QUESTION!

Well., most property owners, if you are

not talking about shopping centers, you are talking about your
front yard, somebody comes along and wants- to make a speech
in your front yard, you say?

'’Well, what are you going to say?*

H© says, "Well, I am going to say so and so."

I say? "Creat,

/

corns 'tin, latJs have a big speech right in my front yard, we.
will gat. a crowd.55
The. next guy comes along and says, mT. would like to
3peak in- your .front yard."

"What are you -going to say?a

He tells me and X say, "I am awfully sorry, I im not the least
bit Interested it that end just stay offf my property.!e

Now,

that is what most property owners can do, I suppose.
MB., HAMMER:
QUESTION:

Yes, most property owners •*—
Why can’t this man do it when he says-,

“I don’t want anybody" coming on ray property, tc say anything.*?
MR. HAMMER;-

Because the law in California now

imposes a regulation!, & restriction of what might otherwise
have been his arbitrary power based upon the role he plays,
that particular owner of that particular kind of property in.
our society.
• ■

QUESTIONs

What if the law in California imposed a.

24
restriction upon householders3 upon the property right of house­
holders?

You said anybody can come onto anybody's front yard

and picket the way they did here with shopping centers*,
Would that present any question or problem?
MR» HAMMER*

In my mind* sir,, that; might well present

due process problems»

No, it is not. Your Honor, because it

is —* well, I suppos'® under certain fact situations, if I know
some of our hotels where there are a circle of retail stores
that do surround 'the lobby, it might' be a factu»! matter for

The scene in California is really quite different as

MR» HAMMERS

Thank you

We v/j.Xl resume there at

AFTERNOON SESSION
UsOG P.M.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs, Stillman, you may

proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELINOR II. STILLMAN,
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MRS. STILLMANs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
Appellants have been making some arguments here
which sound like the type of privacy arguments customarily made
by individuals.

1 think it is important to focus on what-we

have in this case.
What we have is someone who is engaged in a business
operation, a business operation which the California Supreme
Court has found has altered the urban suburban landscape of
California in a way ‘that has diverted the additional audiences
■that used to assemble in parks.

» ■

this Court as far back as Nebbia has recognized
that if one embarks in a business which public interest demands
shall be regulated he must know regulations will ensue.
QUESTION s

How much regulation?

Are you speaking of

regulation in the sens© of utilities, railroads, airlines?
MRS. STILLMAN:

No, regulation in the interest of

promoting the public health, safety-,, welfare ahd morals.
QUESTION:

Of course in that'sense every man9s home

33

is regulated, too9
MRSo STILLMAN:

But obviously there are character­

istics of a horae which are different from the business operation
which invitas in the general public to — and conducts
operations on such a scale that raise problems that are
can be expected to bring about the interest of State .regulationo
QUESTION:

Well, for my part? Mrs» Stillman, I am

interested **- no on© can tell us the whole scops of this
opinion

but I am interested in specific points0

You heard

ray question to your col3.eg.gue about the large hotel lobby,
twice as big, three times as big as this room, surrounded by
2S~30-35 stores6

They Invite the public very anxiously, they

are anxious to have them»
New, may they pass out leaflets in the lobby of that
hotel?
MRSo STILLMAN:

Well, to some degree hotel lobbies

perhaps don't issue quite the same 'invitation that the owner
of a shopping «enter does»
QUESTION:

But to 'the extent that the

They have access doors going from the

That la some kind of an 'invitation for people in the
i
lobbies to go into the shops0 And hotels do not limit access

shop»

to the lobby to guests of the hotel0
MRS, STILLMAN:

Well, Your Honor, 1 think it would

be proper for the California Supreme Court if they made the kind
s of findings about large hotel lobbies of the kind you are talking

34
about that they at&da about shopping centers to have — and if
they found that the State broad free speech right, which is
not restricted to simply limiting government restraints, could
not be effectuated otherwise, I don't know that it would be
proper for this Court to reexamine the wisdom of that finding.

me this is still at the’ core of their argument.

They are

37
saying at pages IX and 12 of their opening brief the right
to exclude is such a central element of private property that
the Government even in the name of reasonable regulation cannot
diminish 'that right-without paying compensation„
Her, -what that is saying is that the State of
California is not free to have a broad* free expression policy
\s
and 'to)Effectuate that policy because it might place one
restriction on the owner's right to condition an invitation he
has extended to the general publico

How about iri the private zesidence of the
.

5-adre type which someone mentioned this morning j can the
State of California limit the owner's right to exclude the public
from that S acres or 10 or 100?
MRS» STILLMAN:

If our Honor* I think the private

residence is a totally different situation»

In the first place*

there .is no business operation which has extended a general
invitation to the public®
In the second place* there are privacy interests
involved in the private residence that just are not present
here in the owner of a business property who is conducting an
operation of this kind®
QUESTION:

2 wonder what your answer would be to some

of the hypothetical 2 put to Mr„ Hammer this racmlng®

For

MRS» STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Must they allow the Ku Klux Klan to corns

on or the American Nazi Party passing out leaflets for the masterrace and for anything that the Elan and the American Nazis
believe in?
MRS. STILLMAN:

Well» as I read the opinion of the

California Supreme Court the owner — we are talking about th©
minority enterprises and their role as owners of a Center that
is engaged in regulation» that is engaged in operating a
business «*«• ,
QUESTION:

Content regulation?

MRS* STILLMAN5
QUESTION:

SXCUSe mec

Content regulation'?

MRS. STILLMAN:

I believe that they said time, place

and manner, and I assume that they mean time» place and the
manner in the sens© that that — that those terms are used in
the Federal First Amendment decisions of this Court which does
not include content regulation«
QUESTIONs

So if the Nazi Party wanted to put on a-,

demonstration such as they had down in Illinois a couple of
years ago —
MRS» STILLMAN:

1 think a demonstration might raise

39
significantly differant problems which could be regulated»

Standing but —

Nasis are very disciplined people»

MR?.;o STILLMANS

Hell, if they stood .in the corner and

simply handed out their leaflets, probably under our.**-* I hate
to anticipate the Supreme Court of California but I would
suggest that their use of the phrase "time, place and maimer18
would mean exactly what this Court has meant in the First
Amendment decisions»

And there is no doubt that shopping center

owners might have persons an their property who would pass out
literature that they disagree with»

But they ere certainly

free to place placards up saying "These people don't represent
our views

.

:

* No one assumes that persons passing literature out
at the Dulles Mr port represents views of thw’ Dulles' Airport.

And I think it is unlikely that these views would

be attributed to the owner»

I

X sight also add that this Court'1® decision in Eastex

is relevant to this point»

It may *— it is highly likely that

tlx® owner of the enterprise in E’as tax did not agree that the;
Texas, right to work statute was a bad idea or that' -the Federal
minimum wage shouldn't he raised to $2 sr. hour»'

But that was

not ?•. reason for saying that this literature which is protected

40

by Section 7 of the national Labor Relations Act could not be
passed out by his employees on his property,
QUESTION:

Under this deedsion suppose there was an

organization that was dead set against having a certain product
marketed in California,

Could under this decision they enter

this property and leaflet and picket against this particular
product?
MRS, STILLMAN:

Yes* Your Honor, I think under the

Logan Valley decision there probably was boycott grape picket­
ing on shopping center property in California,

I think that

would be within the .rule„

ha 1 said, I think time, place and manner regulation
is by reference to the First Amendment,

That is correct.

But it also adopted

•the principles which you have used in your NLRA erases with

QUESTIONS

Nobody has mentioned the captive audience

aspects so far as I recall anywhere here.* - People going to super­
market am going there to buy groceries and meat and whatnot.
Are they in your view something of a captive audience?1
MR. 61LIAM*

They are a captive audience only to the

extent that they go to shopping centers which are deemed
desirable by the person engaging in & particular form of
expressive activity.

If X hava a Center that is attractive

'and item's a large aumbter of people, there is no question in my
mind, that extensiva expressive activity” oh that shopping center
may drive away business..
However, it is a free choice as it sits now.

In

the record in this case theirs were stipulations as to the nine
iarg-a&t shopping' centers' in Santa Clara County.
pages -6 axel 1 of the record.

It

.-appear;; on

The first item of business was

a a-tipula-iion that out -of the 9' largest shopping centers in
Santa‘Clara County one was forbidden by local ordinance from
permitting expressiva activity y-4 permitted it, 4 did not.
The stipulation went on that 'the plaintiffs had conducted a

47

survey of Santa Clara Comity®

Sorae Centers permitted expressive

activitys some did not, some of these who did permit it did it
subject to re as on-; ib la regulation®

It is in the face of that

that the California Supreme Court*c assumption is so" egregious®

Implicit in that opinion is the assumption that expressive
