ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD GOLDMAN,. JSSQ. ,

m BEHALF CP THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDMAN:

LaROCCA

Thank you*- Mr* Chief Justice,, and

may' it pleas® the Court:
Petitioner Anthony L&Rocea was convicted and
sentenced consecutively under the enhanced penalty provi­
sions- of two federal statutes for the identical use cf a
firearm.

T??o counts allege that he had assaulted federal

officers with a pistol in violation of section 111 of Title
£3,-while another count -charged that lie used this 'same
pistol to commit these same felonies in violation of section
92*S( eKl>,

Petitioner challenges the section 924(e)

'o:

viction and sentence.
In punishing assaults on federal officer®,
section. Ill has long provided an augmented penalty if &
firearm Is used to accomplish the assault.
sented here is this:

The issue pre­

When Congress adopted section $RRKc)

In. 1968' to provide an enhanced penalty generally for the
use of a fire-arm in the commission of' a federal felony.

5
did it intend to duplicate the coverage of ?y. ctlon 111.
Frankly, it- is surprising that it is necessary to
bring this issue to this Court.

Indeed, adopting peti­

tioner's construction of the- statute s the Justice Depart­
ment in 1971 at. vised all U.S. Attorney® net tc prosecute
defendants under section 924(c) where one of the preexist­
ing enhanced penalty statutes already applied,
• QUESTION;

Is that a matter of policy on the

part of the department?
MR. GOLDMAN;

I believe the department was acting

on the basis of the very principles of interpretation that
guided this Court tc come to the same exact conclusion in
Simpson v. United States, In particular the rule on speci­
ficity that calls for a more specific criminal statute’ to
govern to the exclusion of a more general statute.

And in

addition in the following year9 1972, in a letter to the
U.S. Attorney for Baltimore, the department again reiterated
the same position and also said we adopt the s.t&t emant of
Rep. Poff as government policy.
Now, Rep. Poff’3 statement was precisely or point.
He said — his proposal was not intended to apply to the
preexisting statutes Inasmuch as they already serve to de­
ter the use of firearms.
Mow. the government, of course, could change its
views on a question like this, but not in this case.

QUESTIO,'":

Mr8 Goldauin, would, you ala© contend

that If LaHocoa had not used the gun but had merely carried
it and therefore there could not have been enhancement
under 111, that there could have been enhancement under
924(c)(2)?
MR. GOLDMAN:

Busie's case»

Is your position* that if there is an alleged violation of
a statute which carries an enhancement provision* as ill
does;» then 92*5(e) in its entirety is simply inapplicable,
MR. GOLDMAN:

Well, our position -

it suffices

for our case merely to call attention to the overlap be­
tween the preexisting statutes and section 92*1 (c)(1).

Our

position is that Simpson in the tools of construction re­
lied on there vitiate a conviction under 32«(c)(1) quite
clearly.

Thera is when a separate question of whether

Simpson and ' he principles on which it rele.ee also Vitiate

MR. GOLDMAN:
QUESTION:

~~ 92%(c) does not apply.

I*m saving the minimum permissible

reading of what Congressman Poff said was that if the en­
hancement provision of 111 applies, there shall be no other
enhancement.

One could also road his statement that way.

MR. GOLDMAN:

One could read Ms statement — the

precis© words he used were as follows:

KMy proposal is

not -intended to apply to sections 111, 112, 113 of Title
18, which already define the penalties for tta-use of a
firearm'.

In our case, precisely involves the vise of a

firearm, not the carrying but the use.
Furthermore, this statement is entitled I be­
lieve to great weight.

It was expressly made for the sake

of legislative history at the time the amendment was in­
troduced.

Furthermore, if went u^contradicted except for

Senator Dominick ifhose own amendment fails of enactment.

QUESTION:

This was the only source, Mr.

Chief Justice, of legislative history.

QUESTION:

If there were ambiguity or uncertainty,

as to what it meant -~
MR, GOLDMAN:

Well, there is no question that

there is ambiguity In this statute.

That has to be the

necessary conclusion from this Court’s decision in Simpson.
At the very least, the parties agree that Simpson holds
that 92*3 (c) does not apply to a violation of an enhancement
provision as In the bank robbery statute or as in section
111.

To that extent, it is agreed that

has excep­

That is established by Simpson.
New, what seems very convincing to us is that the

Justice Department itself, when it first analyzed this
statute, focused exactly on Rep. Poff’s statement and said
we adopt this as official policy.

At the* very, vary least

that must inculcate an ambiguity in this situation, that
under the rule of lenity crust be resolved in the defendant's
favor.
That is not all that we have here.

In

But contrary to the suggestion that the govern-

opinion.

The opinion specifically concluded that 924(e)

should not apply, and that relief was awarded by the lower
courts on remand.
QUESTION:

Well, you say we held that there can

be no conviction under 924(e) and also 111?
MR. GOLDMAN:

Yes, and the reason for that —

the way 1 would put it is the Court held that there could
not be sentences under both provisions because 924(e) aid
not apply, where the statutes overlapped.
QUESTION-

So you think that means that we held

that he could hot be convicted ancler ~~ a defendam could

MR* GOLDMAN;

Exactly.

MR* GOLDMAN:

Well, I don’t believe cha lower

that there be further proceedings in accordance with the
opinion, and the opinion specifically endorsed the Justice

the rule of specificity.

Yes.

— that if you are going

to get enhancement at all in a bank robbery ease, you must

That's correct.

I’m sorry, in an

assault case.
QUESTION:

In an assault case., yes.

MR. GOLDMAN:

But the sarae principle would bs

also true for the
QUESTION:

So you have no choice, the government

has no choice to proceed under 92*! alone?
MR. GOLDMAN:
QUESTION:

That *s correct.

Do you think that position is essential

to you to win here?
MR. GOLDMAN:

Yes. and. we also maintain that the

rationale of Simpson permits no other conclusion.

The-

adoption of the Poff amendment said by its author not to
apply to preexisting enhancement statutes, and the rejec­
tion of the Dominick amendment said by its author to apply
to these statutes persuaded the Court that Congress meant
to confine 924(c) to felonies that were not already subject
to an enhanced penalty if a firearm was used in their com­
mission.
Sven more pointedly, the Courtfs invitation of
the rule that dictates that the mere specific criminal
statute govern leaves ho choice about this matter.

That

principle could, 'only have been invoked to dictate that
924(c) gave way to the bank robbery statute.

Logically,

there was no other way of invoking that principle.
hoar, considerations of stare ciecisus ought to
weigh very heavily in this area.

Net only is this a

question purely of statutory interpretations but Congress
at this very moment has under active consideration

14
legislation directly on point.
In proposing bills to react i.
House and the Senate have suggested provisions that would
unify and rationalize the entire field of enhanced penalties
to deter the use of firearms.

Both proposed statutes would

bring together in one section all preexisting provisions
thermore would propose penal

more i

ne

with section 111 than with section 924(c).
QUESTION:

Are these part of the Criminal Code

revision or independent of the Criminal Code revision?
MR. GOLDMAN:

These are the pending bills to re-

codify, yes.
QUESTION:

The package?

MR. GOLDMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Do you make anything of Congressman

Poff!s vote against the conference report in your inter­
pretation of the legislative history?
MR. GOLDMAN:

I don’t believe that that vote

undercuts his initial explanation in any way5 no.
QUESTION:

And his explanation of why he voted

against it?
MR. GOLDMAN:

That’s correct.

I don’t believe

there is any ambiguity in his introductory explanation
that makes it necessary to look at later events to decipher
what lie meant.

The interesting thing is that the action

i
J-

J

actually taken by the conference committee cuts just the
other way.,

It shows that Congress was prepared to hare

litigation in these circumstances, so there would be no in­
consistency in concluding that Congress intended section
111 to govern to the exclusion of 924(c).

It is very diffi­

cult to make anything of an action taken by the conference
committee against us on this point , notwithstanding that
bill.

The fact is that Congress

adopted it.
QUESTION:

But it seams to me you have to take

the- bitter with the sweat to a certain extent, don't you?
You use Congressman Poff when he is available to help you,
but you reject him when he is not on your side.
MR. GOLDMAN:

Well, I guess our position is that

we don't really see any tension between his introductory
statement and his ultimate vote.

What Congressman foft

was concerned about was establishing a deterrent to the use
of firearms where no deterrent already existed.

Where one

already existed, he wasn't concerned with tne problem.
Congress simply didn’t choose to duplicate coverage that*
ilready existed.
iven the fact that
As I says at the very least, gi^
the Justice Dapirtment agreed with us only less than ten
years ago, one has to conclude that th re is ambiguity
about this matter ana if that is true v/e have to wiii xii.iQ.s~

MB. GOLDMAN:

X believe the Court held in Simpson

that 924(c) does constitute a separate crime.
QUESTION:

So that if the governments with

respect to some other felony that isn’t covered by an en­
hancement, a non-ill felony, you can lust say you violated
924?

is also correct* Your Honor.
Unde::- section 924(c)* one can violate the statute
in one of two ways:

felony.

A reading of the statutes indicates that the

unit of prosecution is the underlying federal felony and
not the number of weapons involved, and. as w& sec it this
becomes very critical in showing the similarity between
Basic's case and that of his co-defendant LaRoaea.

MR. REICH;

The point that I am making about sec­

tion 924(c), Your Honor, is that the possibilities of
prosecution are not multiplied because of the number
weapons involved.

One is liable under 924(c) either for

using or for carrying a firearm, and the important distinc­
tion her® is that Basic could have been convicted either for
using vicariously LaRocca* s firearm or carrying his own,
Now, what the Third Circuit has said in this case
is that LaRocca, who is the one spraying the parking lot
with the -bullets, to use the Chief Justice*s observation,
can be sentenced only once, whereas Bugle, who watched and
stood by and is only responsible vicariously can t© punished

As we read the Simpson case, we read Simpson to
establish that a Simpson or a LaRocca-type defendant can be
convicted and punished only once, that is for the -underlying
federal offense, when that offense contains its own enhance—
merit pvision; and It Is our positron that

violation and that is the carrying; of the firearm*
I point out to the Court that under section 111
the basic charge is forcible assault or resistance or im­
peding a federal officer.

There is an enhanced provision

if one uses a dangerous op deadly weapon such as a firearm
in doing that.

But the underlying charge is fully included

in the 924(c) violation and therefore if this Court were
to hold that our statutory contentions are invalids, the
Court would still roe required to move on to the Bioektmrger
issues and the double Jeopardy issues.
31 also point out that these assault incidents
involved the same transaction's.

Ho.

Tba most recent, cases in

this Court talk of the Bloekburger test# but I believe in
Simpson this Court did acknowledge in passing that as were
talking about — the Court was talking about the one trans­
action which was the bank robbery.
If Busic and LaRoeea are to be treated differently
obviously this will result in creating a very easy way to
evade the protections which Simpson sought to create against
double jeopardy.

We point out that using alvrays includes

carrying, and using can never be less serious misconduct
than carrying, and usually it involves more serious miscon­
duct .
Simpson itself involved two or mors weapons,

A.?>

I understand the facts of Simpson, both of the defendants
in that bark brandished their firearms and possessed their
firearms.
QUESTION:
MR. REICH:

Does 924(c) involve just firearms?
92*1 (c) involves firearms but firearms

is broader than guns.
QUESTION:

des, but deadly weapons, which is a

term I believe used in 111, is broader than firearms.
MR. REICH:

That is true.

And as this Court

noted in the Simpson case, the primary purpose of 21X3 in
that ease, and we believe the assault case, was to deal
with the use of firearms, handguns and the like-

Yes, Your Honor.

But 1 believe that

the legislative history on that point is similar to the bank
robbery statute*

Those provisions were Included primarily

to cover handguns* but to cover anything else*

As a

matter of fact * there are some cases I believe that hold
that you can have a violation of that provision using a
shoe and possibly a fist, but primarily it is directed toward
the gun.
QUESTION:

Well* I suppose both in £2He) with

respect to a firearm or in 111 with respect to the aggrava­

be of the firearm or of the weapon as a firearm or as a

In 924(e), yes.*

his gun to bang down the door of the bank wouldn’t be using
— while he would be using & firearm, he wouldn’t be using
it as a firearm.

Yes.

There is to be disparate treat­

evaded by selective theories of prosecution.

Even, in this

case'there ~~
QUESTION:

There is nothing new or improper

about using selective theories3 as you put it, of prosecu­

MR* REICH;

There is nothing new or ne. vel er.aept

when the theories arise under the same statute or under
the. entirely aame set of facts.
QUESTION;
MR. REICH;

Or the same transaction.
¥©11. there are a ’.number of transac­

tions where the government could, indict the person for tax
evasion and bribery and everything that seeks to relate
without sor.traverting any constitutional provision*

Here

we are talking about a situation where the government has

26
the choice of charging simple assaults and. cither charging
enhanced violation by using the d&i

or u

ous or deadly weapon.

They can charge the defendants with

using their own weapons or each defendant with using the
weapon of the co-defendant, and then when you com® to £24 (c)'
you can charge a defendant with use eh ;her of his cut:
weapon or his co-defendant^s weapon or carry it, ore or the
other we apon,
If there is a distinction based on the fact that
one defendant uses and on© "defender* t carries a firearm or
a distinction based on the number o f firearms involved,
Simpson itself means nothing under the facts of the Simpson
case *

QUESTION:

I would think you woulc reas Simps.*:..

to say the holding is you cannot have consecutive sentences,
You are asking for a much broader reading that says you
can't choose which statute to prosecute under even though
you impose only one sentence.
MR. REICH:

1 believe that Simpson hell that you

cannot have multiple sentences where the two types cl
statutes are involved.

But I also believe that the language

of the Simpson case establishes the underlying reasoning
that you can’t lava consecutive sentences because the
statute, 924(c) is inapplicable to a felony which already
has its own enhancement provision.

2?
QUESTION;

You can't even under Simpson argue,

you can’t be convicted under 924(c) if the underlying felony
already has an enhancement provision,
MR. REICH:

That is the way I read Simpson, yes,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Which would mean that that is 924,

period, all of its sections, none of it3 aactions is applic­
able .
MR. REICH:

924(c), I don’t address myself to the

rest;of the statute because Rep. ?off was only speaking of
924(c).

As 1 read the Gun Control Act, even though there

are different

well, different statutes were put in there

because of different considerations, but as far as 924(c)
io. concerned —
QUESTION:

Well, 924(c), that reasoning would

cover both (c)(1) and (e)(2)?
MR. REICH:

I believe it must.

not even s. separate sentence,

You see, CD is

(c)(1) is a phrase which is

joined by an ”or". and the sentence is completed in (c)(2)
and I find it difficult to conclude that when Rep. Poff
made that statement for legislative history, he was stopping
in mid-sentence as to his views regarding the applicability
of the statute

He said the statute is not applicable

where the underlying felony contains its own enhancementprovision.

But if a person at the time he made

I find that result to be il­

a conspiracy involved.

And if someone is carrying & fire­

arm during a tar conspiracy, an income tax conspiracy, the
logic of the government1 s position in the lower court was
that he could be convicted of the tax conspiracy and also

The ultimate position that this Court might re-r.ch, asd I
think properly so, is that consistent with the Simpson
language and Rep. Poff?s statement, no carrier•can be con­
victed where there is an underlying felony with s.n enhance­
ment provision.

But that is not necessary to give Basic,

relief in this case.
All that is -necessary to give Busie relief in

in (c)(2) Is not- a reason for enhancement of the underlying

make up his mind, and if he charged them uner 1(c)(1) you

KR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Hr. Levy.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK I, LEVY, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF TEE RESPONDENT
MR* LEVY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

j it please

the Court:
In June of 1968, the Congress, alarmed by recent
pub11s tragedies and the rising incidence of firearm re­
layed crimes, j. issed the Gun Control Act.

Among the

principal provisions of that act is section 92^{c) which
focuses directly on the crime problem by punishing the use
and unlawful carrying of firearms in the commission of
federal felonies.
By its .terns , section 924(c) is applicable to
the commission of any federal felony*

Mevex-fcheless;i the

petitioners argue that they fall outside the scops of
s e c t ion 9 2 4 {c} fc: c arc s the underlying of predicate felony
which ft s

..

•••<.: r-ieiodj

'

on fe

ral offj

provides an.enhanced penalty for using a deadly

of

ou3 weapon to commit the .assault.
They contend that the enhancement provision of
the predicate felony operates to the absolute exclusion of
section 92k (c) and that the government is not authorized to
prosecute under or the District Court to sentence under
section 924(c) whenever the underlying offense contains
its own enhancement provision for the use of a dangerous
weapon.
In support of their contention, petitioners rely
on this Court*s decision in Simpson v. United States.

They

assert first that the holding in Simpson governs the In­
stant case: and. second, that the Court’s analysis in
S'iapson compels the result they urge here.
We submit, however, that the Issue in Simpson
and the* issue in this case are quite different and that
neither the holding nor the reasoning of Simpson is eontro11ing here.
The defendants in Simpson hat been convicted of
armed bank robbery and had been given both an enhanced
punishment under the bank robbery statute and the consecu­
tive punishment under section 924(c); thus, the issue in
Simpson was whether cumulative sentences for the use of a
firearm could be imposed under the enhancement provision
of the bank robbery statute and. under section 924(c) £ -!-n

other words, whether the defendant's sentence could hs
doubly enhanced.
After noting several places in the opinion that
this was the issue for decision, the Court held that Congress
had not intended to authorise such double enhancement and
therefore that the defendant's use of a firearm could not be
consecutively punished for the section 124(c) offense and
for the aggravated bank robbery.
This holding, the cumulative enhanced punishments
for use of a firearm are not permitted by section 924 (o'*/

s

does not dispose of the distinct issue presented in this
ease, whether section 924(e) is applicable at ail where
the predicate felony contains an enhancement provision but
that provision is not invoked and thus the defendant's
sentences is not doubly enhanced.
It is one thing to hold that Congress did. not in­
tend that the aggravating circumstances of using a gun be
twice punished.

It is a far different matter to hold, as

petitioners seek here, that Congress intended the penalties
provided in section 924(c) to be wholly irrelevant.
QUESTION;

I suppos-* if Simpson had just in so

many words said that 924(c) just isn't applicable at ®-l-~
x-fhen you are dealing with an underlying felony cua:> was ur

I think that

sort of language would exceed the scope of the issue pre­
sented in Sirapsor?.,
QUESTION:

Well., that may foe but it would at

least reflect the then opinion that —
MR. LEVY:

Yes, it would,

QUESTION:

And it would have been deciding that

ease on a very broad ground.

It wouldn't have

it would have iaen the grounds of decision, hud the Court
said that.
MR. LEVY:

QUESTION:

Which I think it didn't.

MR. LEVY:

I think that is right* but I don’t

read Simpson to have said that *

QUESTION:

What do you think its reasoning was?

How did it arrive at its result?

it said Congress didn

intend these consecutive punishments because they under­
stood Mr. Poff in a certain way or not?
MR. LEVY:

Well.. 1 third: starting a step further

back that the Court was confronted with a somewhat unusual
issue in Simpson of doubly enhancing the use of a firearm.
That is quite uncommon under the federal co.de,.y eri I thin*:
the Court was simply not satisfied that Cortjgress her un­
tended that unusually severe result given the ..angurg'u
legislative history and other factors that were extsc.

nc

oy

the Court in Simpson.

I don't think the Court in Simpson

held that the defendants there couldn't be twice punished
because they couldn't be- punished aft all under 924(e).

I

do not read the opinion to say that.

QUESTION:

You certainly don't agree with your

colleague on the- other side in that the government couldn't
proceed under 324(c) alone where the underlying felony al­
ready has an enhancement provision?
MR. LEVY:

ThatT s right, I do disagree with that.

QUESTION:

You have to.

MR

Absolutely,

LEW:

That is this case-.

Beyond the holding, the analysis employed in
Simpson also does not require the conclusion that section
924(c) is inapplicable simply because the underlying- felony
provides an enhancement penalty for use of a dangerous
weapon,-

The Court in Simpson relied on three general con­

siderations:

First, that the double enhancement of punish­

ments was not necessary to promote the purpose or the
deterrence rationale of section 924(e); second, that the
legislative history, and particularly a statement by
Congressman Poff on the floor of the House, pointed in the
direction of a congressional Intent not to allow sentences
to be doubly enhanced; and* third, that several canons of
statutory construction supported the view that double
enhancement was not authorised by section 324(c).

3
Lc eking to each of these fac .ora in turn» it can
bo seen that none of them supports the result urged by the
petitioners.
First, the statutory structure and purpose:

The

penalty provisions of section 924(c) are unique and, having
been specifically designed to punish and deter fire-arms
violations, they are fundamentally different both quantita­
tively and qualitatively from the penalties provided in
section 111.
With respect to the length of sentences, section
924(e) specifies an increased punishment for using a fire­
arm of up to ten years for- si first offense and up to twentyfive years for a second or- subsequent offense.

In contrast,

section 111 increases the penalty where a dangerous weapon
is used by only seven years»
In addition, section 924(c) provides a mandatory
minimum sentence of one year for first offenders and two
years for second and subsequent offenders,

Section 111

provides no mandatory minimum penalty.
Section 924(c) also establishes more severs
penalties for recidivists than for first offenders.

Section

t

111, on the other hand, makes no provision for the imposi­
tion of increased sentences on recidivists»
Finally, section 924(c) restricts the availability
of probation, suspended sentences and concurrent sentences«

3-8

In a
the discretion of the sentencing judge to exercise leniency.
Petitioners have offered no reason why Congress
would have meant section 924(e) to he inapplicable her®.
In our view., given the differences in penalty structures
and given that the Gun Control Act was specifically de­
signed to address the problem of firearms, it seems' inconcelvable that Congress intended that a defendant who uses
'a- firearm tc assault a federal officer- would be completely
;i:; exempt from sentence under section 924(e) and would instead
.h - •'
- \
lv be subject only to the lesser punishment provided in
■section 111; thus, unlike in Simpson, where the Court
: 1 concluded that double enhancement was unnecessary to

■.■achieve the deterrence rationale of section 924(e)-, a*
Hr/ ' -

•

- decision that section 924(c) is wholly 1 .appl leas' ijef- in
’the, instant case would disregard the special penalties

of the Gun Control Act.
Moreover, again in contrast to Simpson, tblhold
■ i-i'..

here, that section 924(c) does not apply whenever the predi­
cate; felony contains an -enhancement provision for the use
of a dangerous weapon wou31 leave to several illogical re­
sults that are inconsistent with the purposes of the act
and that Congress surely did not intend.
The- First consequence of such a holding would be

39
that a defendant who uses a firearm to assault a federal
officer would be subject to different and less onerous
penalties than one who uses a firearm to commit virtually
any other federal offense.

Indeed, this result would hare

the particularly perverse effect of rendering the stiff
penalty provisions of section 924(c) inapplicable to the
very felonies that Congress had previously single 3 out for
greater, rather than lesser deterrence and punishment.
Congress could not rationally have intended section 924(c)
to produce; such a result.
QUESTION;

Mr. Levy, your opposing counsel points

to irrational results; you point to irrational results.
Do you think it is fair to say that the kind of anomalies
and blearre cases under both constructions more or less
balance out?
HR. TElYt

I do not.

I don*

does produce any anomalpus results.

think our position

First, section 2114

upon which petitioners rely to produce such result's-, T
understand does not have the same sorts of limitations on
probations, suspended sentences and concurrent sentences
that section 924(c) does.

But beyond that, it. seems to me

that the correct answer to the asserted anomalies is to
vest in the prosecutor the discretion in this area, as
virtually in all other areas, to select the proper chargein any given case commensurate with the conduct that is

alleged.

1 h.h:ink that prosecutorial discx-'etion would elim­

inate any conceivable anomalies that might ufherwise arise.
QUESTION:

But you've got some wholly uncontrolled

and uninstructed discretion and we all know as a matter of
fact that in some areas prosecutors just have the tradition
in

that prosecutor;s office just to overcharge in every

ease.
MR. LET?:

There are differences in prosecutors

QUESTION:

Or in different types of cases» and

but --

In other areas the tradition is otherwise» and it Is wholly
unreviewable and uncontrolled, that discretion.
MR. LET?:

That is correct.

It is unreyiewable

and, uncontrolled and it is also quite common.

There is

nothing different about this area.
QUESTION:

They are not instructed.

I mean

there are no agreed upon criteria.
TR. ; -T/I:

Well s within the executive branch in

terms of an. administrative criteria, t here are guidelines
that are used in some areas to control prosecutors In U.S,
Attorneys offices.

I agree that those are not subject to

review by a court,
\

QUESTION:

Certainly the executive branch is ru.

alone if there arc anomalies because there certainly are
wide variances in exercise of sentencing power by federal

Ai 1

judges as well.
Ml. LEWS:

That is correct.

QUESTIONs

But perhaps nothing that we should be

That's correct,

invited fco promote or encourage.

MR. LEVY:

Well, I think the

well, first I

don’t think again that this area is any different than any
other, and it seems to m® the prosecutorial discretion is
at the very least unavoidable and is ir. fact desirable in
order to fit the charge to the particular case.

But beyond

that I think that the consequence© of not allowing such
discretion here and imposing the rigid and very narroh view
urged by petitioners would be far worse.
Another illogical result of petitioners' construc­
tion would h’B that a defendant who uses a gun to assault a
federal officer and one who uses some other dangerous weapon,
such as a knife, would both he sentenced und
same penalty provisions of section 111«

exactly the

Such a result

would be contrary to the purposes of section 92^1 to punish
with special severity the criminal use of firearms«
Moreover, since the recidivist provisions of
section 924 extend only to a second or- subsequent conviction
under that section, petitioners * interpretation would Kean
that a defendant ubo on several occasions '/.res a we we
assault federal officers would not be covered by tho&e
reseat offender provisions and iron,-;;,, ho vrou.ia. rev-air

a..

hi 2

as

■

....

■

ra

to comit some other federal offense.
On the other hand, a defendant who twice uses &
firearm to commit virtually any other federal felony would
be subject to those harsher penalties *

The recidivist pro­

visions were designed to pw.-i.isL with heightened severity
those people who have shown themselves to be recurrent
abusers of firearms,•and no reason suggests Itself where
Congress would have wanted the applicability of the
recidivist provisions to depend upon whether the prior
armed offense consisted of an assault instead of almost
any other federal felony♦
Finally, if we are correct, as we contend in our
brief and. we rely on the argument there, that section
924(c) at all events prohibits the unlawful carrying of a
firearm during the commitsion of an assault on a federal
officer, petitioners * construction would mean that the de­
fendant who actually uses the firearm would be subject
solely to section 111. while the defendant who only carries
but does not use a firearm would be sentenced under the
more stringent provisions of section 924(c).
VJhile Congress wanted to punish and deter both
the use and the unlawful carrying of firearm;. it is im­
possible to believe that Congress • intended to authorise
severe sanctions for unlawfully earryia . a :ireaf;

43
than for its actual use.
In sum, the first consideration relied on in
Simpson, the purpose of the statute demonstrates here that
section 924(e) is not inapplicable where the predicate
felony contains its own enhancement provision.

The legis­

lative history of section 924(c) * the second factor relied
on in Simpson, also demonstrates that an arool assault on
a federal officer is punishable under section 924(c).

This

history makes it plain that Congress wanted to punish and
to deter by means of shorn measures the criminal use of
firearms.

Congress recognised that this

objective turned

or: the certainty as well as the severi 'jy of punishment.
Congressman Poff. in introducing the amendment that ulti­
mately formed the basis for section 924(e), expressly
stated that his proposal was stronger than the then pending
Casey amendment because it restricted the imposition of
concurrent sentences, suspended sentences and probation.

of the statement of Rep. Poff?
MR. LEVY:

Yes. I do.

QUESTION:

How is that?

HP. LEVY:

Well, I think it is consistent if you

look at Congressman Poff*s statements in their antirety..

We do not believe that the statement i c-lied Oil Ly the Colon
In Simpson, which was an isolated statement s which
elicited no discussion and which eras not d:l. mated to the
issue presented in this case, can to® given dispositive
weight here.
QUESTION:

Well, what else did Congressman ?off

say that you «— at least for my part, I am waiting to hear
what else he said that you think we have overlooked.
MR. LEVY:

In introducing his amendment,

Congressman Poff emphasised that his proposal was stronger
than the Casey amendment which was then pending before the
Congress because It had the limitation on the exercise of
the trial Judged leniency discretion.

Congressman Poff

later reiterated the importance of these features of his
amendment and they were likewise stressed by other Congressas» who stressed the need to confine sentencing discretion
in order to provide a significantly greater deterrent than
was generally found In existing law.

And in the end,

after this discussion3 the House adopted the Poff amend­
ment by a vote of 4l2~to~ll.

If I could finish reciting the

general legislative history and Congressman Poff*e' state­
ments „ as I said. Congressman Poff had emphasised several
times the Importance of the unique provisions of his pro­
posal, and indeed he felt so strongly about these provisions
that when the conference committee weakened to some' extent
his amendment, he eventually voted against the conference
report.

The conference committee had weakened hi® proposal

by eliminating the restriction on concurrent sentences and
limiting to repeat offenders the restrictions on suspended
sentences and probation.

Congressman Poff found this so

significant that he voted against the report»

At that tiina,

he said It is not the severity of punishment that deters,
it Is the certainty of punishment that deters; in the
posture that the conference report leaves it3 the amendment
will not promote certainty of punishment; rather, with
respect to the first offense, actual time in jail will be
no more certain than it is today.

of punishment to deter armed felons, it Is impossible we
think to conclude; that Congressman Poff intended that

. .i.; not intended!* and the

Court in reaching that result? had relied on tad rejection
of the Dominick amendment.

That in the Courtis view

corroborated their reading of tin® foff statement.

I don’t

think that the rejection of the Dominick amendment hear®
on the issue before the Court in this-ease* whether the
prosecutor has discretion to prosecute undor 924(e) in
lieu of prosecution under the enhancement provision of
section 111.
In addition to the legislative history, the Court
in Simpson also railed on several martinis of statutory con­
struction.

In this case* those ra&Kiias do not lead to the •

conclusion that section 924(c) is inapplicable whenever
the predicate felony provides for an enhanced penalty.
The Court in Simpson first invoked the usual
rule of avoiding constitutional decisions where possible.
In Simpson* the government had relied on identical evidence
to provd violations of sections 924(c) and 2113(d), the
aggravated provision of the bank robbery statute* ••and
the defendants had received consecutive sentences under
those statutes.

in such circumstances * the Court observed

that there was the prospect of double jeopardy and follow­
ing settled, practice it thi s lacked to see whether ar in~

lenity.

However, this rule is simply •;jn au;iiiiary aid in

discerning, the congressional intent and it applies only
when the Court has looked to all other available sourcee
for guidance on. the meaning of a statute and is still
left Tilth the serious ambiguity or uncertainty.
Moreover, the Court has recognised on other oc­
casions that even a criminal statute is not to he so strictly
construed that the legislative purpose is defeated.

Given

the 'structure* purpose and legislative history of section
and given the untenable results that would occur
under petitioners’ construction., the’rule of lenity does
not bear on the present issue.
Finally 9 the Court in Simps on referred t.o the
principle that precedence be given to the more specific
of the t.ro statutes.

However,, this principle cannot be

detersiin&tive,whereas here the language, purpose and
history of the act consistently point in the opposite di­
rect ion,,

Moreover, we do not understand the Court -in

Simpson to have held as a general matter that only one
criminal statute can apply to a given situation simply
because that statute may be considered to be the mostspecific,

Such a proposition would he of dubious soundness

and would contradict many long-standing decisions of this

has to sentence him under 524(c),, and under Simpson he can­
not; sentence him then under bh© enhancement provision,
because he say» "shall* — because of that word "shall.”

it under 924(e), and when he does he cannot under Simpson

MR. GOLDMAN;

I will

that those members of t!.3 House' who were present when Mr.
Poff made his statement — «ell,, as a question, hov many of

its impact was and what the whole problem was?
MR.. GOLDMAN:

stated what he meant, we a??® not addressing the interplay
of these provisions -QUESTION:

How many of them do you 'think understood what you under­
stand his statement to be, let’s put it that way?
MR. GOLDMAH:

Well, because I think his words

accurately conveyed his thoughts-,

I believe those who

listened to him are read what he had. to say agreed with
that.

The fact is that some of these pre-existing statutes

do read in terms of ”shall.w
in 2114„•

That is true of the provision

And under Simpson, it Is clear that a prosecution

can’t lie under 2114 and under 924(c).

The proper resolu­

tion is indeed the one that Rep. Poff said he intended.
QUESTION:

Wall, the government says you can

convict under both and can sentence only under one.

have already taken care of the gun problem

63
MR. GOLDMAN;:

Well, I can only repeat our posi­

tion, that the person who sponsored this provision said in
what we regard to be absolutely unequivocal language that
he did not intend to address the problem of statutes where
there is already a deterrent purpose being served,

The

norlaaly presumption x would, think mould be that Congress
died not intend to duplicate itself in enacting criminal
laws, and yet that is exactly what the government is sug­
gesting here.

Mow, that happened in Batehelder but there

was affirmative evidence to that effect.

In this caso, the

evidence is just the other way.
In addition, there is an additional tool of
statutory construction, the interpretive preference for
specific criminal laws that applies here, and it did. not
apply in B&tehelder.
One last word;

It is our position. that when a

sentence la vacated, that also serves to vacate the convic­
tion because a judgment of conviction requires a sentence
under the federal rules.

So that when the sentence was

vacated on remand In Simp son, that also served to vacate
the eonvication.
