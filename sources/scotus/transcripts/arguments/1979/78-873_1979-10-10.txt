PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Solicitor General,

you may resume where you left off yesterday.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. McCREE, JR., ESQ,.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS (Continued)
MR. McCREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The concessions that petitioner makes in his brief
and those

my brother Mr. Bruno made in his argument yes­

terday affirm the accuracy of the government's statement of
the question in its brief.

We stated the question to be

whether the Emergency School Aid Act authorizes the Depart­
ment of Health, Education, and Welfare to withhold the
special funds provided under that statutor/ program from a
school district whose faculty assignment policies have a
disparate racial impact nost justified by educational
needs, without a showing that they violate the equal pro­
tection clause.
We argued yesterday that section 1605(d) (1)(B)
which is the statutory provision providing for disqualifi­
cation of certain school districts, establishes a result
test for the disproportionate demotion or dismissal of
faculty or other personnel, and this of coarse requires
us to focus on the second clausa which provides "or other­
wise engaged in discrimination based upon race, color or

31
national origin in the hiring, promotion or assignment of
employees."
And of course, the construction that the Court
accords tc this clause will determine the validity of the
regulation which petitioner admits has not bean adhered to
by its school board.
We suggest that there is no reason why racially
disparate hiring, promotion or assignment should produce
a result different from disproportionate demotion or dis­
missal to justify the requirement of a motive for one and
not for the other.

And we hava endeavored to —

QUESTION;

Maybe you and wo would agree with

you, but maybe Congress didn't.

That is the question,

isn't it?
MR. McCREE:

That is indeed the question, Mr.

Justice Stewart, and I have tried to surmise why the
Congress used different language in these two instances.
And I think the best argument that occurs to me at this
time is as follows:

The attention of the Congress was

focused upon what had been do jur© separate school systems
in the South which, of course, were dual school systems
and were duplicative in so many respects.

There was the

white school and there were, as were known in those days,
the "colorad schools," and there ware principles for each,
administrative personnel for each, as well as instructional

32
personnel or faculty, and the Congress was concerned that
in the dismantlement of dual systems that black employees
or minority employees would be disproportionately fired.
For example, if the system had 40 white princi­
pals and 10 black principals for a total of 50, and it
ended up that it just needed 40 one© the separate system
was to be dismantled, the Congress focused its attention
to the situation which might result in the firing of all
10 black principals, and therefore the language "dis­
proportionate dismissal."
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

Or demotion.
Seems appropriate.

However, one has

difficulty 6fith a concept such as disproportionate hiring.
What does disproportionate hiring mean?with that.

I have difficultv

Does this mean that if 5 candidates present

•themselves, 4 of one race and 1 of another, that to hire any
other than a 4-to-l ratio would be disproportionate?

This

does not make sens® to me in terms of whether the candidates
had the skills that were needed at the time -- one might
be a Latin teacher, an English teacher, a French teacher,
and so on.
I have even more trouble with the notion of dis­
proportionate assignment if it means in proportion to what?
In proportion to

i© number of people in the school system?

And I don’t thin

;he Congress wanted to establish a quota

in the establishment of schools and the hiring and promo­
tion and assignment of course looks towards establishment
and not disestablishment»

And for that reason it would seem

to used the phrase "otherwise discriminate" allows more
latitude in the establishment and ongoing conduct of a
school district.

And that satisfies m© as a sufficient

reason for using different language., but still having a
results test# and as the regulation providas, the results
test is met if the discrimination in hiring or assignment
«

results in the school being identified as a school for
children or for students of a particular race, color, or
national origin.
QUESTION:

General McCree, would you say that the

word "discriminate" means treat differently?
MR. McCREE:

I think that is what it means? X

think that is exactly what it means.

But that doesn’t

mean discriminata in the sens© of a constitutionally im­
permissible discernment of who the persons wer©, because
obviously they have to discern who they art to avoid the
disproportionate dismissal or demotion.
occurs in that process,, too.

So discrimination

And yet it is conceded that

that is a results test.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't you say, Mr. Solicitor General,

that the word "discriminate" or "engage in discrimination,

5;

34

to use the statutory language, standing alone implies some
kind of an intention?

I mean, if you had discriminatory

effect, then that would have its own meaning, but "engage in
discrimination,” doesn't that imply intent?
MR. McCREE:

Well, X think it certainly implies

awareness or discernment.

Discrimination means to be aware

of a difference, and it doesn't necessarily mean to imple­
ment.

X can discriminate between colors or among colors:

That doesn't mean I am going to do anything about it.
QUESTION:

But that is a consciousness and aware­

ness .
MR. McCREE;
an awareness.

I just have a capacity to know, it's

And again we're talking about a results test

and it would just appear that the Congress used that phrase,
"otherwise discriminate," to mean otherwise produce a
result that would show that the statutory purpose which of
course was to eliminate the distinction between de jure
and da facto and to protect the children from the harmful
•

■ .

result from racial isolation, as was stated in the congres­
sional statement of purpose.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask you

a sort of basic question about the statute so I can have it
a little, a little batter understanding of the whole scheme.
Literally it seems to provide that if there is a violation

35

of any one of these subparagraphs, th© educational agency
shall never be eligible for assistance.

It says, "No

educational agency shall be eligible for assistance under
this chapter if it has after the set date engaged in any of
these practices" -- is that the way the agency reads it, or
is a school board permitted to correct violations and then
become eligible, even though it was in fact in violation
for a period after June 23, 19— —■
MR, McCREE:
Stevens.

It is quite the latter, Mr. Justice

The school board may apply for a waiver of the

condition of eligibility, and if th© waive:: is granted, the
school aid monies are paid forthwith.
QUESTION:

And the basis for a waiver is that

the situation is —
MR. McCREEs

To correct the situation would render

them ineligibl© but for the waiver system.
QUESTION:

So that in the case before us, we've

had a stay in effect, as I understand it, for some years on
the disbursement of the funds that they're trying to get.
MR. McCREE:
QUESTION:

Three and a half million dollars.
Whatever.

But if in the years that

have gone by since this case started they liad corrected the
situation in the teacher assignments, then presumably they
could become eligible in the future, is that right?

So

36

they may still get their money, even if they lose this law►

suit?
MR. MgCREE;

That is exactly my understanding.

As a matter of fact, there is a companion case called
Polfield which involves an ongoing dialogue between the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the
school board.
There is also another case that involves a
request for a waiver and the rejection of the request of
the waiver because of the Department’s determination that
the ineligibility demonstrated in this case had not been
successfully removed.

And in all of these cases the funds

that had been preliminarily set aside are still there.
QUESTION;

Let me turn, if you will, to the con­

sequences of the Department's determination that there is a
violations the consequence is what?
4R. McCREE;

The consequence is that the school

board then does not receive the funds requested, but the
school board may request a waiver of eligibility.
QUESTIONS
MR. McCREEs
QUESTION:

That is under regulations, I take it?
Well, the regulation —
Well, in any ©vent it’s available, the

waiver procedure is available.
MR. MaGREE;

Th® waiver procedure is available.

37
QUESTION:

Let me take the next step in my inquiry.

If the consequence is to take this money away from the board
of education# the next consequence is that what is regarded
as a bad situation may become worse, is that not so?
MR. McCREEs

Well, it could b© if it were th©

policy of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
to punish, but it isn't at all.

These are funds in addition

to funds that the school board would otherwise have, and the
funds are made available to assist the school in achieving
the congressional goals her®, 'sdiich are to eliminate what in
th© North was called de facto segregation lecausa of th©
congressional finding that it was harmful to fcha children
who were in that kind of situation.

We mention in our brief

a quotation from Senator Stannis which —• I would like to
read tills.

This is on page 13 of our brief.
I beg your pardon; I said Senator Stennis, it was

Senator Eastland who says, quota.-;

that just accidentally happened.1"
So this legislation vas intended to relieve that
situation as well as on® where a state statute mandated it,
and wa submit that a school board that wishes to participate
in doing that, even if th© courts could not compel him to
do it -—

QUESTION:

But if they find that certain money is

being used in a discriminatory manner and they cut it off, it
doesn’t mean that they cut off any other money?
MR. McCREE:

Oh, no, the school raises its own

money from its own —
QUESTION:

No, but I mean, what if Federal money is

being used for two or three different things?
MR. McCREE:

Well, I think Title VI might come into

play at that point.
QUESTION:

You mean the school board, then, is

completely ineligible for any funds; is that it?
I'd. McCREE:

Well, if the school board is guilty of

constitutionally prohibited discrimination —
QUESTION:

Well, ye3, but you don’t suggest that it

mas tol be to be in violation of this statute?
MR. McCREE:
QUESTION:

Not to be in violation of ESAA.
What if it is in violiition of this statute

in a certain way, in using certain funds, but it’s getting
other funds for other programs under this same statute?
MR. McCREE:

Well, then one would have to look to

the authorizing provisions and provision for ineligibility
if any in that other statutory scheme.
QUESTION:

Well, under this statute -- would all

40

funds under this statute h&v© to cease if a certain use of
some of the funds is in a discriminatory manner?
MR. McCREE:

Funds under this statute would, as X

understand it, but not necessarily under other statutory —
X don't read it to say that.

Am I not correct in understanding that

all of the funds under this statute are intended to correct
the effects of discrimination in the past, and so forth, are

they not?

That's what this whole program is, is it not?
MR. McC&EE:

Well, if I understand the Court to

use discrimination to mean de facto as well as de jure.
QUESTION:

Right, right.

It's intended to promote

integration of the school system.
;

Y-.Y

MR. McCREE:

) >;

V i ' ;Y

It's to, if I might -- yes, my answer

is yes, and 1601(b)(1), or 1601(a) and (b), where the
congressional purpose is set out, in (a) it says, "Congress
finds that the process of eliminating or preventing minority
group isolation and improving th® quality of education for
all children requires additional funds,” and in (b), "to meet
the special needs incident to th® elimination of minority
group segregation and discrimination among students," so
it's corrective and goes beyond, as we understand it.
As we argued yesterday, we believe that we have here
just a question of statutory interpretation and for the

41
reasons that we set forth in our brief, we believe that it
)

makes sense to apply a results test to the second clause of
1605(d)(1)(b), as well as to the first clause, where con­
ceded ly a results test is required.
I would like to conclude my argument by making a
reference to the amicus brief.

We think this, at the very

last part of the amicus brief, it is pointed out that in
1977, I believe it is, under the educational amendment act,
this ESAA, statute was reenacted, and at fcha time it was re-­
enacted, the Congress was aware of the regulation that is
^

under attack here, and there was some discussion of the
regulation and of its effect, and nonethelsss the statutory
language was not changed, which at least wmld give us some
indication that this was not contrary to congressional intent
in fcha first instance.
QUESTION;

It wasn’t aware of the Second Circuit

judgment in this case, because that hadn’t occurred yet.
HR. McCREE;
not aware of that.

That is correct, Your Honor.

It was

But it was aware of fcha regulation.

On

page 42 of the amicus brief, I believe there's a discussion
of it and there's a reference to Senator Jivifcs who, of
course, represents the stats in which fch® school district
her© is involved, and he was aware of this at that time.
And so, we believ© that the Sacretary is appropriately

42

interpreting the statutory authority for his regulations and
that the regulations are reasonably calculated to carry out
the congressional intent and purpose and for these reasons
and the other reasons set forth in our brief, we respectfully
ask that the Court affirm the decision of the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Solid or General.

look specifically at Senate Report 92t61 which provides us

with great insight into what Congress intended.
Again, the Solicitor in discussing why or perhaps
why Congress would have a different standard for demotions
and dismissals as opposed to assignment of staff, the Solicitor
ignores the clear legislative history stated in 92-61 and by
Senator Mondale, which I read yesterday, which it makes it
very clear this is a particular concern they had that the

43
motion in conjunction with desegregation orders.
In response to Justice Stevens’ question about
waiver, the waiver is irrelevant to this case because we
contend we are eligible unless they find intentional dis­
crimination.
I will also note that they withhold waiver unfairly,
and I will just — the ESAA 2 case, the case that is pending
on this issue, it’s in the Second Circuit and is awaiting
decision.
QUESTION:

Well, is it not likely that in a

situation where the possible violation is Ln a gray zone,
is uncertain, that an adjustment is negotiated and a waiver
of any claims of the Secretary are -MR. BRUNO:
it.

Let me tell you how :h©v construe

We •— and the ESAA 2 case deale with next year's

funding which we were also held to be ineligible for —
th® position of HETtf is ■— we negotiated an agreement with
HEW, a memorandum of understanding which was the subject
of the Cawfield case that General McCr@e is idle a ted which
was upheld,

w© negotiated that agreement, that is a

phased program that will take several years to implement
the changes that HEW

would like us to implement, and we

have agreed to that.
However, they withhold funding to us under the

ESAA statute, under the waiver bacaus® the/ contend that
a waiver is not available to /you until you have eliminated
all of these defects, not that you have reached agreement
and you are eliminating them, until you have reached that
elimination.

So we are now out of ESAA funding under

their eligibility and under their waiver for several
years down the road until wa hav® concluded this agreement which they have approved with us.
Lastly, I would like to just note that the key
word is discrimination in subdivision (d), it is the key
word in subdivision (b).

W© argue that it is an intent
The language around discrimina­

tion, w© contend, is simply in one way it Is used engaged

in discrimination, another it is in order to avoid partici­
pation so as to discriminate.
That is clarification language, we believe, of
Congress, maybe somewhat unartfully drawn, but. the word
"discimination" having very definite meaning, and Congress
said so during the debates.
Thank you very much.
