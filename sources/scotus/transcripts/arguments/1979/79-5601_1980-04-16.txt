To be frank with you, I am a little

out of inv depth with regard to the Home Rule Act in the
District of Columbiti and I don't know that I can answer that
questjon adequately„
But I would say with regard to Puerto Rico that the
same concerns that prompted the 1871 Civil Rights Act are
in effect there, namely is the Federal Constitution going to
be given the same even-handed application by local officials
in that Territory as it is in all the other States and
Territories.

And I think that that justifies the application

of 1983 to Puerto Rico.
QUESTION:

Because there is a difference in the

i

status of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, they aren't
going to stand for .it, are they?
MR., AVERY:

We 11, I accept your statement that they

a3:e not, Mr. Justice Marshall..

I think that Puerto Rico does

have the unique relationship —
QUESTION:
MR. AVERY;
the United States.

That is what I thought,
-- does have a unique relationship with
And the District Court in Puerto Rico and

the First Circuit heive certainly entertained these suits with
regard to Puerto Rico for a number of years now.
QUESTION:

Have there been any rulings with respect

to 1981 or 1982 about Puerto Rico?
MR, AVERY:

t

hnow of no 1981 and 1982 cases.

There may very well be such cases but I personally don’t know
of such cases, Mr. Justice White.
Tho complaint .in this case was dismissed by the
District Court purely for the reason that the plaintiff had
failed to allege bad faith in his complaint.despite the fact
that as had pleaded constitutional violations and he had
oleaded that these violations had transpired under color of
law.

And our position is that this question presents two

analytically different issues for resolution by this Court.
One, who has the burden of pleading matters relative to the
qualified immunity issue in a 1983 case; and two,what are
the elements of a cause of action under Section 1983?

8

In our view, the fatal flaw of the First Circuit
decision is that it merged these two questions and decided
both of them incorrectly by requiring the plaintiff to allege
bad faith as an element of his cause of action under 1983.
If I might turn to the qualified immunity issues
first, this Court has decided we would submit in Scheur v.
Rhodes that in a series of cases that have been decided by
the Court that the qualified immunity matters are matters of
defense. Although the Court has never referenced if specificall
to Rule 8(c), ve would submit that the matters of affirmative
defense under Rule 8(c) have been continuously referred to in
that wav by the Court.
QUESTION:
MR. AVERY:

Do you think all matters of immunity are?
I think
I

QUESTION:

What about absolute immunity for —

legislative .immunity, for example?
MR. AVERY:
as a defense.

This Court has treated absolute immunity

In Doe v. McMillan, for example, I think the

Court clearly put a burden on the defendant in that case to
justify the conclusion that if —
QUESTION:

Just to plead the immunity, to establish

that what was going on there was legislative.
MR. AVERY:

Yes, that is correct.

The subordinate

facts, if you will, that would have justified absolute immunity
l

in that case.

And that is part of our argument, that if the

o

defendant has to do even for absolute immunity it would seem
to follow that for qualified immunitv the defendant certainly
has to do it.
QUESTION:

What about Eastland,v. Servicemen's Fund

decided three or four years ago, wasn't there some statement
in there that a mere letter from the defendant stating that he
was a member of Congress was all that was required, no pleading
at all?
MR. AVERY:

I don't know, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but

in other absolute immunitv cases rather more than that has
been required of the defendants.

But even if there are cases,

for example a judicial immunity case where the mere status of
the person is a fairlv complete answer to the immunity.issue —
QUESTION:
MR. AVERY:

You still have to sav, I object.
Yes.

And in fact there are cases where

even the fact that the person is a judge won't insulate him
from liability under 1983 if he acts wholly beyond his judicial
authoritv.
QUESTION:

What if the plaintiff alleges in his

complaint that the defendant is a judge and that it is clear
from the allegations in the complaint that the judge was acting
in his judicial capacity?
MR. AVERY:

I think the judge would be entitled to

win on a motion to dismiss in that case.
■
]

QUESTION:

For failure to take a cause of action?

i

10

MR. AVERY:

No, because the immunity would be clear

on the fact of the pleadings and the complaint in that sense
would not state a claim for relief.
QUESTION:

Well, Tennev v. Brandhove this Court

A

reinstated a District Court dismissal of an action where the
Court of Appeals had ruled that they had stated a cause of
action.

And this Court reversed and reinstated the dismissal.

And you would think it was because of his failure to state
a cause of action.
MR. AVERY:

Well, I think the plaintiff states a

cause of action when he alleges his constitutional rights have
been violated and that thev have been violated under color of
law.

And our submission is that the immunity matters, whether

absolute or qualified, are really matters in confession and
avoidance.
Now, che absolute immunity cases are easv because
so often it is obvious from the face of the complaint what the
issue is.
The qualified immunity matters, however, fall into
a completely different
QUESTION;

Well, you don't need to argue about

absolute immunity.
MR. AVERY:

No, I do not.

The qualified immunity

matters are rather different and I think this Court did decide
in Scheuer v. Rhodes that there is no automatic assumption

i

of qualified immuni tv even with regard to the Governor of a

i
‘

State in. that case.

of a motion to dismiss by the District Court and this Court

held in a unanimous oninion written bv the Chief Justice that

•!3«S

QUESTION:

Sone decided the other wav?

MR. AVERY:

There is onlv one case I know of outside j

the ^irst Circuit and that is Cruz v. Beto in the Fifth
Circuit where they held that the director of a State-v/ide
prison svsten did not have that burden and in that case the
plaintiff had the burden.
QUESTION:

lie had to plead it?

MR. AVERY:
QUESTION:

lie had to raise it -lie had to nose a defense but it is

like an insanity defense in none jurisdictions.

Then the

Oovernment must prove insanity.
Mr>„ AVERY:

I don't know if that is an exact analogy,

because the ’’Fifth Circuit decision isn't so clear, actually,
about the relationship between the pleading requirement and
the nroof requirement..
Also there seems to be some disagreement among the
various panels within the ’’Fifth Circuit about who has the
burden.
:

The other circuits have pretty uniformly held that
cue defendant has the burden and the reason for that, I would
submit, is because of very sound promising consideration,
...

narceiv these natters, natters that go to the qualified iranunity
issue in many cases are singularly within the knowledge of the
defendant.

That is correct.
So to the extent that you make an argument

favoring placing the burden of proof there you are supporting
an araument in favor of nlacing the burden of pleading there as
we 11.
MR. AVERY:

That is correct.

I only meant tc say that

I don't need to go that far in order to win this case.
QUESTION:

But the converse of that is not true,

necessarily?
UR. AVERY:

That is correct, also.

This is a case though which is somewhat confusing in
terms of what the wirst Circuit decided, because the ^irst
Circuit appears to say not onlv in this case but in its other
decisions that the reason they out that burden on the plaintiff
is as though they consider pleading bad faith an element of
the plaintiff's cause of action.

And that is the second half

of the analysis that the first Circuit gives us, namely that
in order to plead successfully

a 1983 case the plaintiff has

17
s

to allege that the defendant acted in bad faith.

2

ruling which mav very well, although I just saw it a few

i

moments ago, be disposed of bv the Court's decision today in

4

the Owen case because I take it that one of the things that

S

we could sav on the basis of that is that bad faith in the

sense of negatina qualified immunity can't be an element of

the very cause o^ action if that cause of action can be

asserted against the municipality without making the claim of

said there were two requirements for making out a cause of

add a new requirement to -QUESTION:

Unless some element happens to be

independently an element of a constitutional violation?
MR. AVERY:

That is correct.

i
There are constitutional
l

violations that require some mental element.
QUESTION:

In New York Times v. Sullivan, as I under- I

18

stand it, the reouiremerit of intent to defame or actual malice
is a burden on the plaintiff as a matter of constitutional
law.
MR. AVERY::

In pleading a defamation case such as

The New York Times v. Sullivan, that is correct»

I think an

example of that in this case is the First Amendment violation»
Under the Mt. Healthy case, as I understand it, the plaintiff
has to allege First that he was engaged in protected activity
and it was then in ::response to his being engaged in protected
activity and it was then in response to his being engaged in
protective activity that the defendant discharged him from
employment»

In other words, the plaintiff does have to

allege that a substantial factor or a motivating factor in
the defendant’s action in discharging the plaintiff was the
Plaintiff's -— the content of the plaintiff's speech.
QUESTION:
MR„ AVERY;

And in a racial discx’imination case.
And in a fourteenth Amendment racial

d i s f r.ci n i n a tic n c a. 3 e invidious discrimination is required.
QUESTION:

Intentionally.

MR. AVERY;: And intent.

And in an Eighth Amendment

case some deliberate indifference is required.
But those are very specific recruirements which the
Court has developed as a result of the substantive juris­
prudence of each of those constitutional violations.

I think

in the First Amendment case, for example, we know exactly what

1»

19
1
i

it is that the plaintiff has to allege as a result of the .'■'It.
Healthv decision.

Just to call that bad faith or malice is

$

to muddv the waters, we would submit, because those terms are

4

much more general, indeed not nearlv so meaningful as the

S

specific content of those constitutional rights which are

6

developed with regard to the substantive lav/ in those areas „

7

I
I
}

In this case, then, our submission is that the

plaintiff had only a responsibility to allege the substantive

elements of the constitutional violations he was pleading,

10

narnelv with regard to the ^irst Amendment violation that he

n

had been engaged in speech activities which are arguably

reads:

or Territory" ---■

It has been brought before this most honorable Court I
the fact that Petitioner was discharged from oub-ic office

because he chose to exercise his freedom of speech.
QUESTION:

Are you familiar with any cases that have i
il

addressed, directly the question whether Puerto Rico comes
within 1983, and why?
MR. CEDO:

No, sir.

Before delving any further into the issues of the
case I would like to state some of the facts.
Petitioner had been -— as it is reflected in Exhibit

\

1 of his complaint ■--- had been engaged for about two years in
a constant vortex of several problems concerning his fellow
officers.

\

He accused some of them of fabricating cases, using

false witness.

affected him in his work professionally.

He was no fc> .discharge 11

then because of that.
He pressed charge against his fellow officers, he
interfered with the Bureau of Inspection Services investigation.
He charged that some of his fellow officers had gained entry
into the police through illegal means.
Then some of his fellow officers in turn accused
him that he was maligning them — many of them, about four of
them.

They questioned his reputation, they accused him of

tampering with a witness and he was not discharged then.
He was accused of passing information to the defense of a
notorious criminal, he was accused of supplying information
to out-of-town killers in order that they could prepare their

23

i !i

defense.

He was accused of creating problems, internal

problems in the police as to help underworld figures.

He

was accused of having suspicious person in his own house.
.4

5

He was not discharged then.
The fact is that an impartial investigation was

6

carried on by the police itself and he was cleared.

He was

7

transferred because he could not properly work in this

P.

unwholesome environment, surrounded by so many people who
lie had accused and who had accused him in turn, he was trans­

ferred to the police headquarters and to the police academy.
QUESTION:

Ilow does this bear on the holding of the

First Circuit with reference to the pleading question here?
MR. CEDO:

Well, it has been said here that his

right of freedom of speech had been violated.

That was not

It seems to me that

discharge from employment does not entitle anyone to recover

14

from damages under civil rights action.

Bad faith, malice or

recklessness, such circumstances actually constitute elements
of any valid claim for relief, simply because in their absence

I would like to bring your attention to the opinion

as

2S

delivered this very morning by Mr. Justice Brennan in the
case of Owen v. The City of Independence where on page 2 it
says:
"Where an immunity was well establi-shed at
■

common law and where its rationale was compatible
with the purpose of 1983 this has been construed

j

|

25
to incorporate that immunity."
The same page establishes that police officers
actually enjoy that immunity.
The purpose of pleading is to inform about the
essence of the claim and the ground on which it rests, to
indicate the basis upon which relief is sought.
And so no one should be required to put forward a
defense against minor imputations which have not even been
formulated or articulated or to state his position concerning
possible or probable issues which have not been raised yet
in a case against him.
QUESTION?

Are you suggesting absolute immunity?

HR. CEDO:

It is a qualified immunity.

QUESTION:

Well, how is the party under 19 83 to know

what immunity there is?
ME. CEDO:

Because of the very position.

QUESTION:

Well,, how would you allege it; you are a

lawyer, how would you allege if you want others —■
MR. CEDO:

I would have claimed that regardless of

defendant being a police officer the immunity did not apply
to him because he

had acted in bad faith.

take care of in your original pleading?

QUESTION:

Do you have discovery in Puerto Rico?

MR. CEDO:

QUESTION:

I assumed so.

Thank you..
QUESTION:

Supposing you had a complaint in which
Il

there were two defendants, one a municipality and the other
the chief of police.

And say in two counts with the same

transaction basically in both.

Would you say that there must

be pleading of bad faith in the count against the municipality? i
MR. CEDO:

Well, your very case of Owen v. The City

of Independence, Missouri covers that adequately.

My personal

opinion is that in the face of an immunity you would have to
plead an indication of how that immunity would not apply.
i

QUESTION:

But you would agree that under Owen there

would be no necessity of pleading bad faith against the

!

municipality?
MR. CEDO:

Yes.

QUESTION:

And you would say there is an additional

element in the cause; of action against the individual?
MR. CEDO:

Affirmative, yes.

Mow, concerning the due process violation I would
say that considering the fact that petitioner was granted a
hearing and that he was rendered whole and he was reinstated,

I

I
I
i

his claims don't have any foundation.

The fundamental

requirement of due process is an opportunity to be heard at
a meaningful time and in a meaningful way.

And decisions of

this Court suggests rather stronglv, I would say, that an

29

employee who has a hearing held after removal get his due
process;, for example, Arnett v. Kennedy.
QUESTION:

Counsel, is that so clear that it could

be decided on the complaint in this case?
MR. CEDO:

It was definitely clear because Act 26

of 1974 on which the claim was based does not provide for the
celebration of an evidentiary trial-type, formal administrative
hearing.

It just mentions an opportunity to be heard, which

in my opinion, could be accomplished by a chance to file an
answer.

And petitioner has not alleged that he was denied

such opportunity.

Besides, petitioner had a hearing and it

seems that the statute that created the Commission of
investigation, prosecutions and appeals of the police provides
that the Commission may confirm, revoke or modify the decisions
or

• cts appealed, it could be said that petitioner's discharge

was rot in fact final until its time for an appeal had expired
or after 15 days after being affirmed upon appeal that a
Commission

reconsideration was requested.
So he was granted his hearing before his discharge

was final and that corues from the very facts that were pleaded.
I think the case is very clear.
Thanks for your attention.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL AVERY, ESQ,,

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR, AVERY;

4

First of all, this is a case where the plaintiff did

5

Just two points, if Your Honor please.
\
;
I

r

allege that he was entitled to a hearing, and that allegation
i

i
f

6

is supported by regulations which were drafted and promulgated

7

by the respondent in this very case.

8

where if he has any good faith defense that might even remotely j

»

or conceivably be imagined, no one other than the respondent

■

And so it is a case

j

10

could possibly know what his excuse or rationale for not

11

following his own regulations might be.

12

that in that sense the burden definitely belongs on him to

come forward and escape from the logical import of his own

And this is a case

Secondly —

16

QUESTION;

I don't have it in front of rue right now,

17

but isn't there something in the complaint itself about the

13

conducting of a hearing?

MR. AVERY:

25

The complaint alleges that the plaintiff

Rehnguist.

But doesn't it also say he got one but it

No, he didn't get a hearing, Mr. Justice

There was an investigation bv the Legal Division
8I

31

of the Police Department which exonerated the petitioner.
that wasn't a hearing as such.

But

In fact the answer admits

there was an answer filed in this case and it admits that
he was discharged without a hearing.

He received no hearing

There was an investigation by an attorney for the Legal
Department of the Police Department but not a hearing as such.
QUESTION:

The affirmative allegation is that his

discharge was without prior hearing.
MR. AVERY:

That is correct.

That was admitted in

the answer.
And the second point was that although the petitioner
does not use the phrase "First Amendment'' in the complaint,
which is what the respondent was referring to when he spoke
about the First Amendment issue, the petitioner clearly does
set forward the facts which support a First Amendment claim.
And we feel that really beyond doubt that the First Amendment
claim is very much a part of this case.
Thank you very much,
