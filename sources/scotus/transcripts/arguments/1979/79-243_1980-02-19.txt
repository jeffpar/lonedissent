ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. TRIBEs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is an appeal by the Richmond newspapers, and
two of its reporters, who were expelled, along with all other
members of the public, from an entire murder trial in September
of 1978.
It was the fourth time that the defendant had been
brought to trial for the murder of a local hotel manager.
And his case had already been extensively described in the
local press.
On motion of defense counsel, without objections by
the prosecutor, the trial judge closed the entire trial
on the authority of a Virginia statute which gives trial
courts discretion to treat all observers as, and I quote
the language of the statute, persons whose presence would
impair the conduct of a fair trial0
At the end of a two-day secret trial, the trial
judge excused the jury, declared the defendant not guilty
of m .rder, and set him free.

4
On petitions for appeal-»-mandamus and prohibitionappellants sought to prevent their recurring exclusion from
complete

criminal trials by urging the Supreme Court of

Virginia to hold such closure unconstitutional.
The States in a memorandum and a brief, defended the
closure on the express authority of the Virginia statute that
had beer invoked by the trial judge.

And the Virginia

Suprema Court summarily upheld the closure, citing only
this Court's one-week-old decision in Gannett.
Although the Virginia statute and the Attorney
General of Virginia speak in terms of fair trial in this
case, there was no specific risk of unfairness whatever,
either demonstrated or found below.
The problems that were noted, either by defense
counsel or by the trial court, were three types.

First,

there were suggestions; which appellants submit are incompati­
ble with the concept of public trial.

For example, the trial

judge's comment that the courtroom layout might make
observers distracting since jurors could see them; a courtroom
which for some two and one-half centuries had been used for
open criminal trials.
Second, there were suggested difficulties that
closing the trial simply could not have solved.

I have in

mind here defense counsel’s concern that one or more of the
prior triala had in some way been spoiled by inadmissible

5
evidence, or by jury exposure to pretrial publicity.
QUESTION;

Was this trial held in the same

courtroom as the prior trials?
MR* TRIBE;

It was, Mr. Chief Justice.

It was

held under the same judge as the second and third trials,
but a di.fferent judge than the one who presided over the
first.

It was only the first trial that went to judgment,

a judgment of convictio;, that was ultimately reversed.
QUESTION:
MRo TRIBE:
a ru.al county.

Where is Hanover County?
It5s some miles from Richmond, and it's

One of the points, indeed, made by the

Attorney General is that because it’s a small community
problems of prejudicial publicity might be greater.
QUESTION:

Well, some—that'3 like, most places

a,re some miles—
MR® TRIBE:

Ism afraid I have not been in Hanover

County, Mr. Justice.
Finally, there were suggestions of problems that
could obviously have been solved by devices that were far
lass restrictive than closure.
Defense counsel expressed particular fear that
jurors might receive misleading or prejudicial information
\

of some kind between trial sessions.

There was no suggestion

that jurors could not possibly be insulated during a trial,
especially of this brief duration, from persons who might

6
give them prejudicial or misleading information.
Now, if this record justifies the closure of an
entire murder trial, then frankly, it's rather hard to
imagine one that would not.
The basic question that is therefore presented is,
whether complete criminal trials can be held in secret,
simply because defense, counsel has moved for closure, and
the prosecution has not objected.
That is what -the statute in this case authorized.
QUESTION:

Wall, I thought the court had to

decide.
ME* TRIBE:
right.

It's in the court's discretion, that's

And the question is whether that discretion can be

conferred upon a trial court to close the trial simply for
that reason, on a record like this which shows no special
risk of unfairness.
And 1 think it's important to stress what
questions are not involved here—
QUESTION:
MR. TRIBEs

It:'s not automatically closed, is it?
Ho, not automatically closed, Mr.

Justice.
QUESTION:

If the defendant asks that it be

closed, and the prosecutor doesn't object.
MR* TRIBE:
to decide.

Ho; the trial judge still has discretion

But indeed, when wa move to the First Amendment,

I think that will be an important part of the argument.
But it is a discretionary decision by an agent of
government whether there shall or shall not foe public aware­
ness of what goes on in this trial.
The question , then, is whether the whole trial can
foe closed; not whether disorderly observers can be expelled;
not whether witnesses can be asked to leave while other
witnesses are testifying; not whether a particular portion of
the trial can be closed; not whether certain members of the
public can be excluded,,
The question is really a rather wholesale one,
and it’s in that posture that the case reaches this Court.
Now, because the Court postponed consideration of
jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits, I want to begin
by addressing this question of whether this case is properly
here under 1257(2).
As Chief Justice Marshall said in the Blackbird
Creek case in 1829, it might have been safer, it might have
avoided any question respecting jurisdiction, to have stated
in terms that the act was repugnant to the constitution.
Surely it would have been safer here not to have
omitted that statement.

It is true that the appellants below

never said, in so many words, this statute violates the
constitution.

But the question before this Court is .whether

the constitutional validity of that statute was drawn in

8

questions- and whether the decision was in favor of its
validity,

And we submit that the answers to both

of those

questions is yes.
The trial court cited only this statute as
authority.

The court said the statute specifically authorizes

the closure of a trial.
So this is not a case where there is merely a
general authorizing statute, like one conferring jurisdiction
to regulate, or jurisdiction to tax, which is somehow gra­
tuitously dragged in by hindsight,

This is a case where the

statute by its terms boars the infirmity that concerns us
here.
Nor did the State claim in the Virginia Supreme
Cour - that the action of the trial court was somehow a
lawless aberration.

In the court below, as in this Court,

the State says that the closure was lawful.
And indeed, in the Virginia Supreme Court, in
defending its legality, both the prosecution's brief opposing
appeal and the Attorney General's memorandum, opposing
mandamus and prohibition, defended the legality of closure
under State law solely as an exercise of authority which was
literally conferred by the statute.

It defended the

statute—
QUESTION:

We; have appellant jurisdiction, whether

the statute is invalid on its face or whether it’s invalid as

9

applied, do we not?
MR. TRIBE:

I think in this case, invalidity as

construed and as enforced, is all that we claim, Mr, Justice,
That's enough.

That's certainly enough.

And we're net

claiming that every possible interpretation or application
would be void.
But the statute was defended in the trial—in the
court below as construing, broadly enough to uphold this
closure, on the ground -'chat, it was a needed limit to the
quote public's right to know, unquote.
And even in this Court, the Attorney General is
not, as we understand it, disavowing this broad reading of the
statute, or his defense of its constitutional validity
when read this broadly.
QUESTIONs

Going to the matter of breadth, Mr.

Tribe, tell me whether I correctly gathered from what you
said before, that you're not arguing that never under any
circumstances or conditions can a part of a trial foe
closed?
Ml:. TRIBE:
part of a trial.

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice; a

We are arguing that at least thus far we

have been unable to imagine any circumstances in which an
entire criminal trial can be closed,
QUESTIONt

Well, can you imagine circumstances in

which, a total public audience of 40 can be seated and a

10
hundred others want to get inr but they would have to stand
around the edges.

And the trial judge says, "Those who can

be seated, be seated.
MR« TRIBE;

But we're not going to have standing."
Certainly, Mr. Justice.

Indeed, one

of the earliest proceedings in this courtroom, one in which
Patrick Henry delivered an impassioned plea against the
tyranny of the King, was rather of that kind.

There wasn't

room for all the peoples who wanted to attend? some were asked
to leave.
But those who could be seated, and could remain
orderly, were allowed to remain.
In this case., however oderly the observers, all
were told to leave.

The suggestion, as I gather it, fey the

Attorney General i.s, it would have been nice if the
Supreme Court of Virginia had been given an opportunity to
narrow the statute down somehow, and that it would have been
giver, a better opportunity to do that, had we brought, it into
question instead of them.
But it's I think inconceivable that it would have
made any difference. Kb particular narrow reading was
suggested by the Attorney General,
position is;

The Attorney General3 s

This statute authorized this closure.

And it would have been a rather pointless act for
the Supreme Court of Virginia to say this closure was okay,
but the statute is not broad enough to sustain it.

We

11
sustain it under some other kind of common law authority.
That would have made enactment of the statute a
pointless legislative exercise on the part of the Virginia
legislature.

So nothing really could have turned in this

case on the form in which the validity of the statute was
read. »
It was necessarily,, therefore, upheld by the
Supreme Court of Virginia , when the Court denied appeal,
mandamus and prohibition.

And even with that not true, the

case would clearly foe here on certiorari.

So let me then

turn to the merits.
The Virginia Supreme Court upheld this trial
closure and denied relief against recurring trial
closures, citing only this Court’s decision in Gannett.
I must say, that seems a baffling conclusion.
Because of course Gannett involved a pretrial suppression
hearing.

No amount of dictum about trials would have

permitted the decision in Gannett to resolve an issue that
was not before this Court.
The majority opinion twice described the question
presented as one about pretrial suppression proceedings only.
And the concluding statement of the holding was equally
narrow.

As the Chief Justice observed in his concurring

opinion, that made all the difference.
i
And the reason that I would submit it must make a

|
t:

12
very great deal of difference is, implicit in the purposes
and the character and the available alternatives in the two
different settings.
Ultimately, the purposes of a pretrial suppression
hearing are to keep inadmissible information from the jury,
as a. cross-section of the public.

In contrast, the purpose

of the trial itself is to expose admissible information to the
jury as a cross-section of the public.
As a result, the character of the pre-trial proceed­
ing is almost that of <in internal governmental mechanism,
wheroas the character of the trial in chief is the very
opposite.
Finally, there are difficulties, inescapably,
about minimizing prejudice arising out of the airing of
potentially inadmissible information at a pretrial hearing.
There are devices available, and this Court has spoken of
then in many cases.

Sequestration is not available because

the jury isn't chosen yet.

But there are devices available:

Changing venue? screening jurors through questioning.

But

the difficulty is that they are of uncertain efficacy, and
if on© must err on the aide of fair trial, it seems to
follow for some that the public may be excluded as a
mechanism.
But the tension between publicity and fairness
ceases when the trial begins.

As this Court pointed out in

13
the Gannett opinion, a panoply of devices is then available,
including suquestring the jury, in order to avoid any form
of prejudicial information from reaching the jury.
So that all of the general references to the central
role of fairness in our system in the Attorney General1s
brief, I submit, are beside the point.
We're devoted to fair trial.

But fair trial does

not require, closed trial, given the devices that are
available.
Now, even if there were no sharp dichotomies, no
basic distinction between pretrial suppression hearings on the
one hand and the trial on the other; even if one viewed them
all as part of the same proceeding, I think it's also striking
that a majority of the members of this Court in Gannett
agreed, though on differing theories, agreed at least that
there must he a substantial showing of need before either
a trial or a pre-trial proceeding can be closed.

And on this

record there was no substantial showing of need.
So without even drawing a distinction between
pretrial suppression hearings and trials in chief, this
Court—
QUESTION;

Bo you think the burden is heavier on

the trial than—
MR. TRIBE;

I should think it would be very much

heavier, Mr. Chief Justice.

Because at trial, presumptively,

14
the purpose is public; the mechanisms are available/ the
tradition is more clearly fixed,

There’s really no reason to

extend the reasoning about pretrial.
But even if one did, I think the conclusion would
ba the same;

This kind of closure would not be allowed.

QUESTION:

Well, now, Mr. Tribe, you would agree

I suppose that the statute did authoarize a trial judge in
this case to do precisely what he did?
MR. TRIBE:
QUESTION:

Yes, we think he probably did.
And therefore your claim is that the

statute, at least as applied in this case, is-—-violates the
United States Constitutioni
MR. TRIBE:
QUESTION:

Exactly.
And I—it58 not clear to me in what you're

now telling us just what provision of the constitution it
violates as applied in this case.
MR. TRIBE:

Well, I think that it violates the

Sixth Amendment and the First and the Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Well, the Sixth Amendment was—-claim

was disposed of in the Gannett case, was it not?
MR. TRIBE:

Well, the Sixth Amendment claim as to

pretrial proceedings, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, the Sixth Amendment talks about

in all criminal prosecutions.
MR. TRIBE:

That's correct.

The accused-™

15
QUESTION:

Insofar as there was reliance by the

petitioners—or the appellants, whoever they were—in the
Gannett case, the Sixth Amendment claim was disposed of.
MR» TRIBE:

I believe that the Sixth Amendment

has not yet been held applicable at all by this Court to
pretrial proceedings»
QUESTION:
terms talks about

Well, the Sixth Amendment by its own
all criminal prosecutions; does it not?

MR» TRIBE:

Yes, it does.

But I don't think the

question of whether in the trial phase of a criminal
prosecution, persons either than the accused may have standing
to invoke the Sixth Amendment, was disposed of in Gannett.
And the reason I don't think that question was
definitively resolved in Gannett is twofold: first, inasmuch
as this Court has not yet held that even the accused has a
right, before the criminal prosecution begins, to insist
upon publicity.

The question of whether the prosecution

is deemed to have begun at the pretrial suppression hearing
stage, for this purpose, really hasn't been resolved.
So perhaps all that's been held in that respect
is that where the Sixth Amendment doesn't apply at all, it
doesn't confer rights on the public.
QUESTION:

So you say most of the opinion was

dictum, then?
MR. TRIBE:

I'm afraid a good bit of if

Wellt there was reliance in the Gannett

case on the Sixth Amendment.

laid, that argument was rejected.

MR. TRIBE:

As to pretrial suppression hearings.

QUESTION;

Well, the Sixth Amendment talks about

all criminal prosecutions.

And in all criminal prosecutions

the Sixth Amendment confers certain rights upon the accused:
The right to a jury trial; the right to a speedy trial? and
the right to a public trial—
MR. TRIBE:
QUESTION;

And as to the—
““-upon the accused.

MRo TRIBE:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Arid that therefore, ?s the Gannett case

X thought said, just—that the Sixth Amendment self-evidently
applies only to criminal cases, and confers rights only upon
the accused.
MRo TRIBE:

Mr. Justice, you are surely the

■authority on what Gannett said end meant.

And all I mean, to

be suggesting, as a reader of the opinion, all I mean to be
suggesting is that some question in my mind is left open
about whether in the context of a complete trial this
court's opinion in Gannett truly disposed of the issue,,
The literal language of the Sixth Amendment was
not quite enough.

The Court surely looked to the purpose

17
of the Amendment—the opinion would have been a good bit
shorter had the linguistics been dispositive.
QUESTION:

Well, the opinion might have been a

good deal shorter ha.d there not been a dissenting opinion,
toe.
MR, TRIBE:
QUESTION:

Well, I5m sure that’s so.
Hr. Tribe, may I just pursue this

thought for a little bit further on.

The Sixth Amendment

issue only—and you draw a sharp distinction between
pretrial and trial—-is there any suggestion in any of our
cases that a pretrial suppression hearing should be closed
over the objection of the accused?
MR. TRIBE:

I found no suggestion in this Court’s

cases either way on that issue.
QUESTION:

Tou don’t suggest that we would so hold,

do you?
MR. TRIBE:

1 really don't know.

Mr. Justice

Blackman in dissent suggested that that was what he inferred
from the majority opinion.
QUESTION:

A number, of"-only one—

Well, what one word in the majority

opinion lends support to that notion?
QUESTION:

Or a sentence.

QUESTION:

Not a single word.

QUESTION:

Mot a word.

f

MR, TRIBE;

I certainly don't press it.

It seems

18
to me—
QUESTION:
Amendment terras.

I understand your distinction in. First

But I'm not quite sure, if you followed the

reasoning of the majority opinion, why you draw a
distinction between pretrial and trial?
MR. TRIBE?
QUESTION:

Well the reason I would—
Insofar as it relates to the Sixth

Amendment.
ME. TRIBE:

I understand.

The reason I would,

briefly, is that the Sixth Amendment*s central purpose,
surely, is protecting the accused.

He might be compromised

were there a Sixth Amendment right on the part of the public
to demand access.

Because the very hearing on that question

would involve the ventilation of information which could
defeat the whole point.
At trial, creating an analogous enforceable right
on the part of the public would not involve the inevitable
compromise of the right at stake.
QUESTION:

Well, when you say a trial, Mr. Tribe,

7, take it you exclude side bar conferences, chambers

discussion as to suppression—
MR. TRIBE:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
—that arise during trial.

You're

talking about reception of testimony from witnesses before
a jury?

19

MRo TRIBE:

Reception of evidence intended to be

received by the jury»
QUESTIONs

Mr. Tribe, surely, did you rely—I know

you rely hare, and I assume you relied in the Virginia
courts, on the First amendment, as well.
MRo TRIBE:
QUESTION:
MR. TRIBE:

I'm about to turn to that.
Well, I hope you will.
Because I think it’s a stronger

argument.
QUESTION:
MRo TRIBE:

Well, yes.
The First Amendment, even if one

reads the Sixth Amendment as completely inapplicable and
conferring no rights whatever on the public, it sheds an
important light on the; First Amendment claim.
Under the First Amendment, it’s of course established
that more than simply speaking and protected; watching and
listening may be protected as well.
It is also, I think, quite olear that the First
Amendment i.s not a sunshine law; that material in the
unilateral control of gvernment, generated by government,
internal to government deliberation, is not automatically
accessible to people who invokve the First Amendment and use
the slogan of a right to know.
QUESTION:

Now, are your clients the general

public, or are they members of the press?

20

MRo TRIBE:
newspaper.

The clients are two reporters and a

They were expelled, however, as an indiscriminate

sweep of the general public.
QUESTION:

But they’re not the general public;

they’re specific members of the press, are they not?
MRo TRIBE:

Of the press, and at the same time,

they are citizens and members of the public.
QUESTION:
MRo TRIBE:

Well, certainly; so 'ara you, so am I.
Correct.

But I am not.—I’m making

nothing special of their status as members of the press.
That is, were these two reporters not members of the press
they would have been expelled just the same, and we would
still be here arguing that the closure—
QUESTION:
MRo TRIBE:
Amendment argument.

Hut you might not have the same case.
I think we'd have the same First
The First Amendment argument that—-I

would be rather distressed about a principle that says that
only members of the press—•
QUESTION:

Well, are you distressed about the

First Amendment, which gives separate and specific
protection to the press?
ME. TRIBE:
QUESTION:

No.

I think it's important that—

It’s there in the First Amendment,

whether we like it or not.
MRo TRIBE:

And I think it's terrific.

But the

21
point that l!m making is that even without relying on the
separate institutional status of the press-and without
making any claim that the press has greater rights, the
First Amendment is violated when government exercises the
kind of power that was exercised here.
How let me describe that power,

1 think it’s

plain that the accused did not have a right to a private
proceeding; that is, the accused could not demand that it
ba private.
QUESTION:

That, too, was held in Gannett,

was it not?
MRo TRIBE:

That's right.

Since that—
QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, if you had a professor at

the law school nearby who wanted to come to listen so that
he could lecture on the subject-MR. TRIBE:
QUESTION:
MR. TRIBE:
QUESTION:

Into this Court?
No, not this one, the Hanover Court.
Ah-hah.
itod would he then have a nexus with

the First Amendment rights about speech, if he. was going
to make this lecture, based on what he observed?
MR. TRIBE:

I don't, think that inquiry into the

way the information will be used is either necessary or—QUESTION:

I'm just pursuing—

22

MR. TRIBE:
QUESTION:
MRo TRIBE:

1 think he certainly would,
I’m just pursuing-™
Even though he’s not a member of the

press.
QUESTION:

—that was suggested, is there any

difference to whether the man’s going to use the information
to write something or to go out and make a speech about it?
MRo TRIBE:
QUESTION:
MRo TRIBE:

No,
If he’s just going to maintain silence.
Or if he’s simply going to educate

himself with it, and use it to be a more intelligent voter
on all kinds of matters.
The kind of power that was exercised here, given
that the accused doesn't have the right to make it a
closed proceeding, but. only the option to request that it
be closed, is a governmental power to decide.
Within the class of cases where the defense
requests closure, which shall be available to public
knowledge, and which shall not?
Now, it’s at that stage that the Sixth Amendment as­
sumes s. role in the First Amendment argument.

Because it is

by virtue of the Sixth Amendment that this proceeding
cannot be described at: an in-total governmental proceeding.
Neither is it private, nor is it internal government.
Because at least it is clear that the accused

23
could deman that it he open to the public.

Because that is

clear, it follows that asserting a First Amendment right of
access here in no way commits the Court to transforming the
First Amendment into a Sunshine law.
Those areas of documents, deliberations, buildings
that are not, by virtue of the constitution, accessible to
the public at least on the demand of someone outside of
government8 s control—

Well, what—you talk «about the First
But I don't suppose it’s just a

Is there some—could there be some showing that

would permit the closing or not?

Under your First Amendment

standards?
MR. TRIBE:

Well, under the First Amendment

standards that I think appropriate in this case, a showing
of some compelling need, which could be served only by the
closure of a trial; and without which, some equally
transcendent value would be compromised? would suffice.
QUESTION:
MR. TRIBE:

Well, at least it wasn’t here.
One isn’t even close to the line here,

and it’s for that res.son that attempting to articulata the
precise circumstances on a record of this kind—
QUESTION;

Well, I don't want to get you into too

much trouble, but what about Gannett?
MR. TRIBEs

Gannett itself?

I find on reflection

24
that that was a very—-to rae a vary close case—
QUESTION:
ME. TRIBE:
QUESTION;
MR» TRIBE:

On the First Amendment.
I think on—
On the First Amendment.
On the First Amendment grounds, I

think I would, have to think that Gannett ought to have been
opened.

But I must say—
QUESTION:

You think it was close?

Do you think

it was close?
MR, TRIBE:

I think, it was close.

But I don’t

think this case is close, and this is the case that I'm
arguing to that.
QUESTION:

Do we know-—have we any way of knowing

very much about the closeness of it in the absence of any
findings—
MR. TRIBE:

Well, it's precisely the absence of

findings that makes it—that aggravates the clarity of the
case.

One of the* obligations, surely, given the First

Amendment rights, would be to establish some basis in the
record for the supposition that fairness was at risk, and
could be saved only by closure.
Under this Court's First Amendment decisions one
does not resolve that kind of doubt on a silent record in
favor of suppressing the flow of information.
QUESTION:

Well, supposing you have a defendant

25
who waives the right to a

public trial? he 'wants a closed

trial.
MR. TRIBE:
QUESTION:

As this one did.
As this one did.

Then what happens to your First Amendment argument?
It's really just a 3cind of a tailgate kind of thing.
MR. TRIBE:

I don't think so, Mr. Justice.

Because

when he waves it, that doesn't transform the august
proceeding of.a criminal trial into some kind of internal
negotiation.

It's not plea bargaining with here.

It's the

formal confrontation of the State with the accused.
The fact that he waived it then puts to the govern­
ment the question, does the government want the people, or
not, to see what’s going on?

And it was the government’s

decision ultimately to close this trial.

That decision was

triggered by the accused’s request?
QUESTION:

It may be the government's decision in

almost every case that closes a trial.
MR. TRIBE:

But if you’re dealing with a context

which is truly internal to government, in which government
has unilateral control to begin with, then the First
Amendment is far harder to apply.

Because at that point

you don't have the government exercising control over the
flow of information, which is in the public domain.
This information was of that character by the

the Sixth Amendment narrowly.

That is, the First

what is going on a special kind of interest, not just the
generalized interest that everyone might have in seeing
some of the Constitutional norms uniformly applied.

Mr. Tribe„ 1 suppose there might be a

legitimate or at least arguable, aolorabl.e First Amendment
right to a jury trial by contrast to a defendant who just
gets up there and says one sentence, '"l plead guilty,

all the information about all the otherwise available
evidence about those facts and circumstances of the criminal
offense.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL
J. MARSHALL COLEMAN
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
ATTORNEY GENERAL COLEMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

if it may please the Court:
Your Honor, the Appellants take the position in
this case that the Bi.ll of Rights is for the public, but
I think their argument ignores the one person at whom most
of the Bill of Rights* is aimed, John Paul Stevenson.
Now, there are two broad claims that can be made;
One is the trial comt could never be closed and the other
is the trial courts can be closed without a hearing and
without a hearing or without any reason or opportunity for
the public to protest and argue against it.
It seems tc me that in this case that the second
argument is never reached because this is the first case,
in my knowledge in Virginia,

where a criminal proceeding

has been closed in the guise of a full trial.

There is a

tradition that exists that is inviolate and as long as I am
Attorney General I am sure it will be continued that the
judge in tills case was concerned and confronted with
several difficulties.
facts.

Here were very unusual and narrow

Someone who iad been tried four times.
On the first occasion, the trial had gone up to

the Supreme Court on appeal and because a bloody shirt had
beers introduced on the basis of hearsay evidence, the case

29
3

was sent back for retrial.
There was a second,, subsequent mistrial because
one of the jurors became sick.
i

There was a third mistrial because the jury was
poisoned by finding out about prejudicial information that
should not come forward.

And then, in this fourfc occasion,

the* judge was confronted with the defense attorney, with the
agreement of the prosecutor, asking that trial be closed
so his rights could ba protected.
Now?, if difficulties had occurred in this trial
and if the motion had not been granted, certainly,
difficulties could have come to this Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, what was the

reason for closing ths trial — the factual
ATTORNEY GENERAL COLEMAN:

reason?

The factual reasons

were, first of all—
vUiiSl ION:

Are they in the record?

ATTORNEY GENERAL COLEMAN:

Yes, they are.

Tney was a hearing that was conducted that was
asked for after the disclosure was made.

And that was made

afeer the trial on the first day had been concluded and the
jury had been sent home.
The defense attorney and the judge were concerned
about the fact that on one occasion this prejudicial
information had corae to the -5urv 3r,r-i t, _, ,
, ,,
“ lury aRd had kept them from trying
the case.

They had to try another case.

4

30

QUESTION;

Could this have been prevented?

ATTORNEY GENERAL COLEMAN:

Well, at the time this

hearing was requested and these points were urged,
sequestration and change of venue, the jury had already
gone home that day, the trial had begun.

It is obvious

that sequestration is a possibility in any case like this
that is used.

But, in this case, they had had four trials.

They had had some concern about someone in the jury, in
the gallery or in the courtroom.
QUESTION:

You didn’t have the same jury each time,

did you?
ATTORNEY GENERAL COLEMAN:

No, we didn’t? but

someone who was in every one of the trials, apparently, was
in the courtroom.

And the jury had to, cn each occasion,

go out in front of the gallery where the public was and
apparently the recar3. is not completely clear on this,
I think because these people tried the case so many tjanes,
it was kind of shorthand, they were concerned about members
of the public having some conversation back and forth with
the jury.
QUESTION:

Well, couldn’t the judge handle; that

by simply saying that all spectators must remain in their
seats while the jury departs?
ATTORNEY GENERAL COLEMAN:

I concede that.

31

5

QUESTION:

Or the jury is to remain in tha box

until all the spectators are gone.
ATTORNEY GENERAL COLEMAN:

I think that is true,

but what we are confronted with now is looking back on a
judge who is on the firing line, that had all of these
factors and, on the request of the defendant, decided to
close the trial.

He granted an opportunity for a hearing

when it was made later that afternoon.

And these parties

that are in this case today were in court that morning and
made no objection to closure.

They came back later that

afternoon and read from some briefs and presented some
oral argument and then said, "But we don't know", through
counsel, "the reasor why this case was closed."

And

then, when the reasons were explained, there was no
response to that.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Attorney General, why did the

judge need any reason to close the trial?
about Constitutional reasons.

I am talking

I am not talking about

Virginia law or any traditions of yours.

Did you think

there war- some Constitutional reason suggesting why you
shouldn’t close the trial?
ATTORNEY GENERAL COLEMAN:

I think the law is

that i : a prosecutor and if defense attorney and the^
defendant and. ihe judge, t*„ of whom are charged with the
-ponsj.b-.Ii .y o., representing the public interest, say
they want the trial closed — and I don't think that this

QUESTION:

Well, it may not, because you may think

you have a good enough reason, but i£ somebody disagrees
with you, you might reach it and say whether, regardless
of reason, you could close the trial.
Do you think there is seme Constitutional barrier
to closing trials when the three agree?
ATTORNEY GENERAL COLEMAN:

X think when the

three agree, when the public interest is represented, and

it becomes an unending preposition.

ATTORNEY GENERAL COLEMAN:

I think the Congress

with the procedural guarantee provided for the deferdants.

Ka did not have time to think a

He had time to think about it only that

evening or in the morning when it was first made.
Nowt the Appellants didn't make a motion when
it could have been effective.

If the judge had had this

motion when the Order was made, there would have been some
time to consider whether there might be more effective
devices to protect the right of the defendant in the trial
without having a private trial.
But this was not a case where it was not possible
for the public to know what went on.
as soon as the case was over.
The defendant was acquitted.

Tapes were available

It was only a two-day trial.
Those tapes were available•

There was never any hint or suggestion that there was any
corruption, that there was anything untoward, or -that there
was any attempt to cover up anything.

1 don't think, if

you look at the record in this case, you can come to any
other conclusion but that the judge was concerned about the
focus of the Bill of Rights, which is -the protection of the
defendant in this case who was on trial for his fourth
time.
QUESTIONs

Suppose, Hr, Attorney General, the

judge at the opening of the trial said, "This is just one
of those cases I think would be tried better without the

It's immaterial

And the press and the public then want a hearing,

and say, "We certainly have the right to sit in he.re „
Certainly the defendant doesn't want to keep us out; it is
you, Judge?"

What about that?

ATTORNEY GENERAL COLEMAN:

Well,

1 don't

hearing.

But it strikes me—
QUESTION:

Constitutional provision that they would be relying on to

QUESTION;

closed trial in the history of Virginia insofar as I know,
is the kind of proposition that will call into question

I think we can

I think we have to assume regularity.

And

I think in this case when you consider that the Court has
repeatedly told judges to use strong measures to protect
a defendant's right to a fair trial, to be over-cautious,
to prevent even the possibility of unfairness, that it was
incumbent on the judge to consider that motion, and he did
it in the context of recognising that more error and more
mistake in this case could ultimately have the defendant
coming back and saying, "My rights were not protected."
QUESTION:

Attorney General Coleman, if you are

the subject?
ATTORNEY GENERAL COLEMAN:

Well, I think that in

th: 3 case they were not prepared to say that a common law
interest and a tradition in open trials which has many
beneficial effects, aid this Court has agreed with that,
whan, it is in confrontation with the right to have a fair
trial, that all parties of interest in that case,

accompanied with laying that rule down as something that

areas.

tried.

It is the fourth time the case had been

There were very unusual circumstances and when this

motion was made by the Appellant to open it, it came late.
It came without the ability for him, really, to take these
alternative precautions that could have been if it had
come earlier.

And the judge, in view of all of that, felt

that he would go ahead and

close the trial. He

certainly gave deference to any interest that the public
would have in a public trial.

He certainly was concerned

about the defendant’s position, and he was certain1?
concerned about what would happen in the future.
The fact in that the case ended in an acquittal.
The fact also is that tapes were available to the public
and to everyone else to find out what had happened in court,

and how it had happened.

But it is simply the position

of the State that this judgment should not be reversed;
that in this case all the considerations that could be
taken into account were taken into account by the Court,
and that it does not reflect a policy of not giving due
respect to the public interest in a public trial»

And for

that reason, we urge that on the merits the case should
not be reversed, and we would also urge that from a
procedural standpoint, since we do not know what
construction the State Supreme Court would have placed on
this statute if it had been contested by the Appellants,
we do not believe that it is appropriate for this case to
coxae on appeal»
We also think, since the jurisdictional question

granted in this case because there needs to be sufficient
time for the State to respond to the Gannett decision»

It seems to me that when you add the defendant’s
request, it doesn't change anything.

It is just a request

24

50
by a private individual to invoke a censorial power which,
by this Court’s own decisions in cases like Lamont, would
not be acceptable.
I think the more general point is that the
Constitutional philosophy which the Attorney General
espouses is really upside down.

It is his posture that

this Court should be a problem solver and wait until
complicated problems arise and fashion a solution.
not my understanding of this Court8s role.

That is

This Court

should articulate what the Constitution has traditionally
meant, and it. has traditionally meant what was perhaps too
ol /ious to put in so many words that criminal trials are
to be public.

The First Amendme nt provides a perfect

textual home for that principle, due process would do as
well.
And a violation of publicity hare is surely not
rectified by the existence of a taperecording.

It turns

out to be garbled, one can’t hear it.
QUESTION:

And the reason you say the First

Amendment provides an appropriate home for that concept
is that this case is distinguishable from such cases as
Sa"by-~
MR.

tribe:

QUESTION:

Pell and oven Hutchins.
By reason of the fact that somebody

has a right to open up these proceedings?
MR. TRIBE:

Exactly

51

25
QUESTION:

ted it is to that extent that you

look to the Sixth Amendment.
ME. TRIBE:
QUESTIONs

That's right.
And also limits —

MR. TRIBE:

That limits—

QUESTIONS

Saxby, Pell or—

MR. TRIBE s
QUESTION:

Hutchins.
—or between the President and

Members of his Cabinet, or whatever.
MR. TRIBEs

But it is also not just the support

described by the Attorney General.

The suggestion that

they make is this was a maverick decision by the trial
judge.

It was approved by the Supreme Court of the Stats

of Virginia and if, on the firing line, people are going
to err on 'the side of closure because they don't want to
get reversed, and do that in circumstances like this, it
becomes important even from the Attorney General's
perspective—
QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, the Attorney General said

the maverick decision can be corrected by -the Supreme
Court of Virginia, not that this was a maverick decision.
MS, TRIBEs

Well, if this was what he regards as

an acceptable decision, then I think it proves the need
for this Court's intervention in the name of the First and
Fourteenth Amends.

52

26

about it.

QUESTION:

Mr- Tribe,- before you—-

QUESTION:

The defendant didn't do anything

He was acquitted.
MR. TRIBEs

Well, I am not defending the

defendant.
QUESTION:

It is the State’s position that

nobody has any right: there but the defendant and he was
acquitted, so that's the end of the ball game,
MS. TRIBE:
b

But the First Amendment will have to

vindicated somehow.
QUESTION:

It is said that the prosecutor

represents the public interest, and he consents.

What

would be the Constitutional source of the public interest
that he represents?
MR, TRIBEs

I have no idea at all.

The

prosecutor is elected, 1 suppose, to serve a certain public*
role.

But surely he does not control the First Amendment

rights cf all.
QUESTION:

But if by definition the public trial

provisions of the Sixth Amendment is for the defendant's
protection, and yet the prosecutor can open it up,
MR. TRIBE:

It becomes problematic.

It’s

hard to see I imagine under any State Constitution how a
prosecutor could explain the exercise of that kind of
power.
My time is up.

27

53
QUESTION;

Before you sit down, what provision

of the Constitution did the Court draw on to make a
presumption of innocence part of our fabric?
MR. TRIBE;

Mr. Chief Justice, the Rinship

case drawing only on the general language of the due
process clause is a perfect parallel because in Rinship,
the Court held that one of the fundamental reasons that,
even though it is not mentioned, the requirement of proof
beyond reasonable doubt is implicit .in the Constitution
Xo chat it is centra,1 to trust in the system of justice
and central to legitimacy.

Certainly no lass central is

the right of public trial.
QUESTION;

Was there not also some hints that

this was the tradition in 1787,
MR. TRIBE’;

389, ’90 and '91.

Tradition as well, both in Rinship

ai d here, and in a number of other cases provides an
additional basis for making it clear that the Court is
not fashioned in

a new light, that this is -the oldest

and best established.
QUESTION;

And so that argument would apply to

both civil and criminal cases, wouldn't it?
‘CRIES;

That would be much broader and one

would have to know more than I have discovered about the
tradition in civil cases to be absolutely sure, but the
Court needn't decide that in this case.

54

28
QUESTION:

I think you will find that the

tradition is the same.
QUESTION:

May I ask a question?

In response to Mr, Justice Stewart, I understood
you to say that Saxby and Hutchins are not controlling
because those cases did not involve a situation in which
there was the right on behalf of someone to have the
proceedings opened up.

Here is the Sixth Amendment right

on behalf of the defendant to open them up, and that is
what distinguishes those cases.
But is there not, did we not decide earlier
or agree earlier, that there was a Sixth Amendment right
on the part of the defendant to open up the pretrial
proceeding?

If that is the case, and if your theor^ is

correct, your theory requires us to overrule Gannett,
is that right?

If your thrust is right, compelling

necessity,
MR. TRIBE:

I think Mr. Justice Stewart’s

majority opinion took the position that even if the First
Amendment applied, on the record in Gannett, it was
adequately served.
QUESTION:

But your test is, if I understand

you rrght, the rule of the First Amendment right of access
applj.es and that right can only be rejected on a showing
of compelling need.

There was no showing of compelling need

23

55
in Gannett, as I understand it.

There was just a showing

of sufficient basis for closing it up.
MR. TRIBEt

Mr. Justice, I think there will be

nonetheless one way to resolve that question without
overruling Gannett, and that is as a prophylactic device
one can say that in a context like pretrial suppression
hearings where the requirement of showing compelling need
institutionally would be impossible to meet but where,
nonetheless, there are a lot of cases where indeed there
is a compelling need, though you can’t prove it.

That the

requirements of the First Amendment can be somewhat
relaxed because of the powrful conflict of the right of a
fair trial.
In the context of a trial, there is no similar
rc ason to relax the meaning of compelling necessity,,

And

it is for that reason that one might justify what Gannett
suggested at a penalssible ever caution in the Interest
oi the rights or the accused.

But it would not distress

me greatly were one to conclude that perhaps a tighter
standard should have been applied in Gannett.

This case

doesn’t require that.
QUaSTIOHs

you would also not prevail by applying

a different standard than compelling meed.
“

^ou could

prevail, by applying any

standard other than no need at all.

30

56
QUESTION:

That's right.

MR. TRIBE:

Thank you..

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2: 25 o’clock p.m. the case
was submitted.)
