MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 79--105, Curtiss-Wright Corporation ve General
Electric Company.
Mr. Del Deo, I think you may proceed when you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH N. DEL DEO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER
MR. DEL DEO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question before the Court is whether the Third
Circuit was in error when it vacated the entry of final
judgment by the District Court pursuant to Rule 54(b) after
it had entered summary judgment in favor of Curtiss-Wright
in the amount of $19 million.
The Third Circuit based its opinion in the main
on the existence of cour terclaims which it said presented
a possibility of setoff and barred the entry of the final
j udgments,
This is a classic example of complex multi-claim
litigation.

There are 21 contracts involved, there are 16

counts in the Curtiss-Wright complaint ranging from fraud
and misrepresentation on down the line.

The General

Electric counterclaim allege extraordinary assistance and
an unjust enrichment claim which they based on the fact

4
that they helped Curtiss-Wright which prevented CurtissWright from going into default and therefore General Electric
is somehow entitled to the money that Curtiss-Wright would
have lost had it been in default.
QUESTION:

Could those counterclaims be fairly

characterized as unliquidated?
MR. DEL DEO;

Yes, Your Honor.

They are unliqui­

dated and, you know, obviously their proof is difficult.
The amended complaint is the one on which summaryjudgment has been granted in this case and that dealt with
the balances due on the contracts for the nuclear components
that were delivered and accepted by General Electric and
its customer and are now in use by them.
The basis for summary judgment is really not at
issue here.

There were no factual issues in the summary

judgment case, and the sole legal issue was the existence
of a release clause which is referred to in the briefs as
5co

That clause was — the interpretation of it was de­

termined in favor of Curtiss-Wright and the summary judg­
ment was granted to then.
In the balance of the case, that release clause
has no part*

There is therefore no inner relationship

factually or legally between the claims on which summary
judgment has been granted and the claims in the —- the
unadjudicated claims in the balance of the complaint or

In the counterclaims.
Mow, the Appellate Court really doesn’t question
the qualification for finality here.

They have not con­

tested the District Court’s finding that there was no
separate -- that there was a separate and distinct claim
here that it could be decided separately, that there was
no question of moofcness or delay or duplicative appeal or
any of those things.

They didn’t deal with that at all.

They said that the presence of the counterclaim
posing a possibility of a setoff was a bar to the entry of
the judgment absent harsh and unusual circumstances, and
they applied a standard of harsh unusual circumstances
which is really akin to an irreparable harm standard be­
cause they talked about insolvency and economic duress.
They admit that the result is harsh insofar as
Curtiss-Wright is concerned, but they somehow dismiss that
injustice and say that it has to be almost irreparable harm
you have to have insolvency.
QUESTION:

Mr. Del Deo, I take it you don't

question either of the statements in Sears, Roebuck v.
Mackey that the primary discretion to certify under Rule
51! is vested in the District Court or that the Court of
Appeals may review that certification for abuse of dis­
cretion?
MR0 DEL DEO:

I certainly agree, Your Honor,

6
that the Sears case — I emphasize that the primary dis­
cretion was in the District Court and any matter in which
a court has discretion is obviously always subject to re­
view by a higher court.

I think that in the Sears case

thoughj Your Honor, what we had was the court enunciated
three things that were important for a Rule 5^(b) entry of
j udgment.
One was they said that it had to be a single
claim for relief, then they said that claim had to be ad­
judicated finally, and then they directed the discretion
of the District Court to the fact that the District Court
should then see that it was independent factually and
legally from the balance of the claims in the suit, and
that brings into it the attendant questions of mootness,
duplicative appeals and so forth.

On page

4 36 of 351 of

the Sears case, and I will paraphrase to some extend and
quote to some, they said, it cannot well be argued that
the claim stated in -— well, they talk about the claims —
it cannot well be argued that the District Court has abused
its discretion in certifying that there exists no just
reason for delay.

And then referring to the claims in

that case, they said they certainly can be decided inde­
pendently of each other.
So what we have here, Your Honor, is a final
judgment and the District Court exercising its discretion

under Rule 5^(b) to enter that judgment where there Is no
just reason for delayf and the Sears case emphasizes the
broad discretion that the District Court has and it w&z at
that point that it focused on the discretion.

This is en­

tirely different than matters involving appeals from
interlocutory orders because this is not an interlocutory
order,
QUESTION:

But on *137 — let me quote you this

language from Sears, Roebuck — ths court says the District
Court cannot in the exercise of its discretion treat as
final that which is not final within the meaning of section

1291, but the District Court may by the exercise of its
discretion in the interest of sound judicial administration

release for

appeal final decisions upon one or more but

less than all claims in multiple claims actions.

MR. DEL DEO:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

And then it goes on to say primary

discretion in the District Court, abuse of discretion
review in the Court of Appeals.

Now, how do you articulate

the standard by which you feel should have been applied by
the Court of Appeals but wasn’t here?
MR. DEL DEO:
QUESTION:

Do you mean in the present case?

Yes.

MR. DEL DEO:

Well, I think that insofar as the

standards are concerned we did pursuant to Sears have a

8
separate claim for relief and that claim was finally dis­
posed of and within the framework of the Sears decision we
have a final decision under section 1291 of 28 U.S.C.
Maw* where the Third Circuit has gotten Impaled
here I think is on this question of a counterclaim* be­
cause they have not applied universally this standard of
harsh unusual circumstances to eases where there is no
counterclaim.

But where they become impaled is where the

counterclaim.
Of course, the Cold Metal case disposes of the
matter of the counterclaim being a barrier because that
was decided right after Sears and said you. could have a
counterclaim, even a compulsory counterclaim.
The Third Circuit in my view iss number one,
treating it as interlocutory order and in the Allis-Chalmers
case on which they rely they use the specific words
"interlocutory order."

They say since final certification

of an interlocutory order should occur only in the infre­
quent harsh case.

The dissent in that case picked that up

and said the majority has blurred the distinction between
appeals from final decisions disposing of separate claims
and those from interlocutory orders on appeal of -QUESTION:

1292(b), where the District Court

certifies and then the Court of Appeals can accept or rej ect ?

9
MR. DEL DEO:

Well* that is on an interlocutory,

yes, they confuse that.

They thought that 5Mb) was seme

type of interlocutory and the District Court can’t make
final that which is not final, so he can’t certify under

5Mb) in the first place unless -- can’t enter that Judgment
unless it is a final .judgment.
Mow, as far as the counterclaims are concerned,
the Third Circuit is worried about enforcement and that is
p

not a question of finality.
shall hold the money.

They are worried about who

In their decision they said the

practical effect here, the practical thing that we are
being asked to decide is who shall hold the money until
the case is finally decided and that really is not a Rule
5Mb), primarily a Rule 5Mb) consideration.
As early as Reeves v. Beardall, which was prior
to the change in the rule from single transaction over to
its present state, this Court held that the stay provisions
of Rule 54(b) govern who should hold the money.

Mow, what

has happened now is that the 54(b) stay provisions have
been split off into 62(h) which is now where you stay a
54(b) judgment.

So if you apply Reeves v. Beardall you

say after the judgment has been entered if you want a stay
because you want to determine who shall hold the money,
then you go under Rule 62(h).
I think the fact that they split that into a

10
separate rule may well have been to avoid having the con­
fusion of the processes under the stay provisions being
confused in the processes under finality.
QUESTION:

Your position is that this appeal

could have proceeded in the Court of Appeals on the merits
and the judgment nonetheless have been stayed pending the
outcome of the Third Circuit ruling?
MR, DEL DEO:

It could have if the District

Court had so determined, and there are a number of cases
that we have cited in our brief to this effect.

!>4(b)

certification can be entered, judgments can be entered and
a potion made to stay them under 62(h) because of a. counter­
claim or whatever reason and they can either be stayed or
( ■
not, not only pending appeal but pending final determination
of all the issues.
The District Court certainly has that power but
I don’t think that goes to finality.

That goes to the en­

forcement of the judgmento
QUESTION:

I haven’t heard you describe the harsh

extraordinary circumstances that are postulated as the
basis.

MR. DEL DEO:

Well, for one thing, Mr. Chief

Justice, I think that harsh unusual circumstances has never
been articulated by this Court in describing Rule 5^(b).
QUESTION:

What did the District Court consider

11
was the circumstance that justified his certification?
MR. DEL DEO:

The District Court considered the

fac that Curtiss-Wright was being deprived of its property,
its monetary property and would be so deprived for a long
time and would suffer financial loss because of it while
the unadjudicated claims of both parties went through a
long process and while the defendants in this case had the
full use of the property.

But the rule does not say unusual

harsh circumstances to the extent of having to prove some
type of irreparable harm.

The rule speaks in terms of in

my view what justice and fairness dictate and the provision
in the rule is no just reason for delay and there is no
showing in this case of a just reas for delay other than
the fact that there exists a counterclaim.

And you cannot

really accuse a District Court judge of having abused his
discretion by not incorporating Rule 62(h) considerations
in t'

3

5^(b) determinative process with respect to finality„
I think that to sustain the decision of the Third

Circuit is not in harmony with the policy of judicial
economy and justice to the litigants.

It usurps the dis­

cretion of the District Court and I think also it will put
a chill on attorneys using the joinder provisions of the
rule and joining all their claims where possible in one
case.

I think it will rather encourage them to start a

number of lawsuits rather than do what is judicially

12
economical and put them in the one case.
Also I think that if you —
QUESTION:

That wouldn't really be up to you in

this case, would it, because your opponent always has at
least a permissive counterclaim and if he wants the benefit
of delay as a result of a counterclaim he can always file
it „
MR. DEL DEO:

Well, Your Honor. I think that one

of the dangers of the Third Circuit's position in this case
is with respect to counterclaims, that it will encourage
imaginative counterclaims certainly and it will also encour­
age litigants to prolong litigation because —
QUESTION:

You were suggesting — I just wanted

to make that point — you were suggesting — you have a
group of claims on the contract and you also have some
claims for additional monies because of alleged fraud and
all of that.
MR. DEL DEO:
QUESTION:

Yes,

You were suggesting that you would be

discouraged from joining those in the same action by a
contrary rule, but it seems to me even if you had separate
actions for your two groups of claims, General Electric
could still counter a claim in whichever one they chose„
MR. DEL DEO:

Your Honor, that may well be.

haven’t addressed myself to that thought frankly, but I

I

13
know of very few cases where imaginative counsel — and I am
not accusing my opponent of being imaginative certainly but I know —
QUESTION:

That is not necessarily an insult-

MR. DEL DEO:
QUESTION:

What?

That is not. necessarily an insult.

(Laughter)
MR. DEL DEO:

I know very few cases where somebody

can’t think up a counterclaim if they are pressed to do it
and one good enough to get by a motion to dismiss for failure
to state a cause of action.

And it was a motion to dismiss

for failure to state a cause of action that was made here on
the counterclaims that are referred to in our opponent’s
brief.

It was by no ways a decision on the merits.
QUESTION:

But you haven't pinpointed what I

thought I read in your brief, that oe of the harsh circum­
stances here is that they are going to be deprived specific­
ally of about a million dollars a year.
MR. DEL DEO:

Well, that is a financial injustice.

If you just calculate that, if you just calculate by figur­
ing the pre-judgment interest rate and apply it against she
present rate, it is not a million any more.

I think the

last time I figured it out, Your Honor, it was $1.8 million
a year and, of course, that doesn’t even get into what the
value of the use of that money in the marketplace might be.

ii»
QUESTION:

Would it have served your purposes,

your client’s purposes if the judge had ordered that the
judgment be paid into the registry of the court and in­
vested in high-yield government obligations pending the
outcome of the suit so that there might be 11 or 12 percent
return instead of 6 percent return?
MR. DEL DEO:

Of course, Your Honor, that is

really a 62(h) consideration.

It doesn't go to the finality

In this case, even —

QUESTION:

You have gotten into the subject or

at least on the edge of the subject of imaginative or in­
novative remedies and that is why I raised this question,
I was wondering if that would solve the problem, would have
solved the problem»
'MR. DEL DEO:

Well that I don't think is a —

with all respect to Your Honor, I think that would come
under 62(h) with a stay on terms, and that I suppose could
be one of the terms.
QUESTION:

Even normal —
Are you saying that that would be

within the equity powers of the judge?
MR. DEL DEO:

Your Honor, what I am saying really

is that it is not a consideration under 5iKb)k

I feel that

QUESTION:

Well, on the finality issue.

MR» DEL DEO:

On the finality issue, and it is

15
not a consideration on the question of abuse of discretion
because he has the discretion under this rule and he has
not abused it, and there is no standard of harsh unusual
circumstances that goes to irreparable harm here.
QUESTION:

We

—

I submit to you only that if you agreed

that this would be a reasonable solution, the hypothetical
solution I suggested, then would that not have some bearing
on the other arguments you are making about the correctness
of the District Judge’s ruling -MR. DEL DEO:
QUESTION:

Well, I —

— that he had alternative remedies,

this hypothetical one being possibly one, and the one he
adopted based on finality being another one?
MRo DEL DEO:

me.

Well, the motion that I made was

The question here is a deprivation of property, Your
md I think as far as injustice is concerned, to

exorcise discretion, I don’t know what more injustice you
could have,

if what you are suggesting is almost a settle­

ment type of thing where the court might say, well, the
money will be put up and placed in high-yield securities,
but I think there without — I don’t know, the defendant
' ;i t object to that, without a final judgment
i think really that 62(h) is the place to oc >siddl" Whblhef the money should be paid and who should hold

16
the money.
QUESTION:

Well, the Third Circuit here conceded,

that these decisions are binding under 1291» didn't it?
MR. DEL DEO:

They did not quarrel with that*

Their dispute with the decisions was really on the question
of harsh — of the existence of the counterclaim and who
should hold the money.

It didn't bother them apparently

that we are not holding our equipment any more and that the
General Electric counterclaims are unadjudicated and that
the balance of our claims which are substantial are also
unadjudicated3 and that this claim that we have here is
adjudicated.

It is finally judgment.

QUESTION:

It is my understanding that the Third

Circuit — and I think analytically it would have to make
its reversal of the District Court turn on the no just
reason for delay standard in Rule
MR. DEL DEO:

Well, to the extent then that they

are saying that the existence of a counterclaim is a just
reason for delay, they are in clear conflict with the
Supreme Court decision in the Cold Metal case which held
exactly to the contrary, and with the terminology of the
rule which envisions that any claim for relief, whether it
is in a counterclaim or in the main action, can be subject
to entry of final judgment here.
Now, by the fact that, for instance, you can

17
get a judgment on a counterclaim, chances are there is going
to be in existence a complaint and the mere existence of a
competing claim is not a barrier to 5^(b) certification and
entry of judgment, and that i3 exactly what the Third
Circuit is holding in the Allis-Chalmers case by dicta and
in this case straight out, and —
QUESTION:

Do you feel they laid down a flat rule

that any time there is a counterclaim the District Court is
♦

not entitled to certify under Rule 5^?
MR. DEL DEO:

The Third Circuit, to the extent they

laid down any standard at all, said that you had to deal
with situations like insolvency and economic duress.
dealt with almost irreparable harm type situations.

They
But

they have this rule confused with interlocutory orders and.
that is why they are getting into that type of consideration.
They are not treating it as a final order, as a final judgment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Del Deo. I’m not sure you answered

Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc’s question.

Is it your position that

whenever there is a counterclaim you, the prevailing party
on. the original complaint is always entitled to a 5^(b)
finding?
MR. DEL DEO:
QUESTION:

You don't take that position?

MR. DEL DEO:
QUESTION:

No.

No.

But do you take this position?

Do you

13
take the position that the no just reason for delay language
only goes tc the question of whether the case is appropriate
for appeal and that the questions of financial solvency and
collectability and all are the questions that are appropri­
ately raised under 62(h)?
MR. DEL DEO:

That's correct.

Your Honor, I think

that what the discretion that the court is to look to is to
see whether as in Cold Metal the claims are separate, whether
there is an interrelation between those claims that poses
problems of mootness, duplicative appeal and so forth that
would —
QUESTION:

The whole piecemeal appeal problem.

MR. DEL DEO:
QUESTION:

Yes, that was —

Wasn’t there a stay under 62(h) in this

case?
MR. DEL DEO:
QUESTION:

None was applied for. Your Honor.

Has the judgment been collected?

MR. DEL DEO:

No, the Third Circuit vacated the

District Court’s —
QUESTION:

But there was a period before it was

argued iri the Third Circuit —
MR. DEL DEO:

The judge in the District Court

granted a stay pending appeal.
QUESTION:

I see.

But now if you win here, is

it correct that the ease would go back to the Third Circuit

19
for them to pass on this contract defense?
MR» DEL DEO:

Then they would go to the merits of

the original appeal which is the 5c release clause in the
contract»
)

QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

The District Court, as I read his letter

opinion on page — the last paragraph of it on page 13a of
the appendix to your petition for writ of certiorari., did
say and presumably considered that the presence of the
counterclaim as a factor weighing against certification,
that he thought that factor was over-balanced by the other
factors iireighing in favor of certification under 5^(b).
You concedej as I understand it, that he was correct in
weighing that as one of the factors.
MR. DEL DEO:

I think he is correct certainly in

weighing it insofar as the inner relationship of the claims
and the counterclaim and the main case, applying the Cold
Metal standard and the Sears standard as to the fact that
you look to the inner relationship of those claims»
Insofar as the balance of it, whether or not he
weighed it on any other basis, you know, I can’t tell you
what all of his mental processes were.
QUESTION:

In any event, he decided in your favor
S

and you’re not going to quarrel with him very much.
MR. DEL DEO:

Correct, Your Honor.

20
I would like to reserve the rest of my time for
rebuttal, if I may.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Del Deo,

Mr. Groner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ISAAC N. GRONER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE RESPONDENT
MR. GRONER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The principal ground upon i*hieb respondent relies
Is that Rule 5Mb) x^as a rule in the service of and not
contrary to the fundamental policy against piecemeal appeals
and that the Third Circuit was correct when it vacated the
District Court’s entry of the judgment as final which made
it appealable under section 1291 for the reason that the
grounds upon which the District Court relied did not comport
with the tests which were established at the beginning in the
adoption of Rule 5Mb) and were consistent with the policy
against piecemeal appeals.
QUESTION:

Of course, an even more effective way

to prevent piecemeal appeals would have been to avoid
adopting Rule 5Mb) at all, wouldn't it?
MR. GRONER:

Yes indeed, Your Honor, that is

correct, and It was a very serious question to the advisory
committee on the rules and to the court presumably in

21
adopting them as to precisely what scope should be allowed,
deviation from the previous rule that there could be no
piecemeal appeals, and there is no question that what was
intended and what was provided was only a very, very narrow
exception and that the burden was to be upon someone who was
claiming that exception.
Let me read to you, if I may, the concluding
sentences of the advisory committee report and then refer
to the initial sentence.
QUESTION:

Do you suggest, before you go into

that, Mro Groner, that the District Court wasn’t aware of
all of these factors when he did this weighing process?
MR. GRONER:

I could not say that he was not aware

of it.

There is no reference, Your Honor, to the advisor's

notes.

There is reference to the Court of Appeals decision

:Ln Allis-Chalmers and to other cases of the Third Circuit
’which show recognition of the revisor's notes and the very
narrow standard.

The judge certainly sought to apply that

standard in good faith.
Third Circuit, he abused

In our view, as in the view of the
:his discretion by exceeding the

narrow bounds and indeed relying upon grounds which are
improper to be relied upon.
First, to show how narrow the exception to the
rule against piecemeal appeals was Intended *—
QUESTION:

Mr. Groner, may I just clarify one

22
thing.

You do agree, do you not, that the judgment was

final?
MR. GROWER:

No, Your Honor, I take it 'chat that

is the issue in this case.
QUESTION:

The issue in this case —

Is there any question of his power to

enter a 5Mb) finding?
MR. GROWER:
QUESTION:
3,

I'm sorry. Your Honor?
Then you question his power- to enter

•

MR. GROWER:

No, no, no.

No, Your Honor.

As I

understand it, the judgment is not to be considered final
in a case in which there are a multitude of claims unless
and until the District judge validly enters a certification
and —
QUESTION:

If there were no just reason for delay,

then it would be the kind of order which could be made
final, I —
MR. GROWER:
QUESTION:
MR. GROWER:
QUESTION:
MR. GROWER:

Oh, yes indeed.
Okay.
No question about it.
All right.
In that sense, we don't question the

jurisdiction at all.
To turn to the revisor's notes which this Court
in another context has held do indeed give guidance as to

what the Intentions of the revisors were and what the in­
tention embodied in the amendments to the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure are:

After extended consideration, the

advisory committee said, it concluded that a retention of
the older federal rule was desirable, and that older federal
rule, as I shall make clear beyond doubt, was the rule
against piecemeal appeals.
Returning to the revisors -— and that this —
QUESTION:

It would help me if you would indicate

at what date the revisors notes, if you have it —
. MRo GROWER:

These were I believe in 19*46, Your

Honor, amendments adopted in 19*46, effective in 1948, which
put the pertinent words of Rule 54(b) as they are today,
although there x^as a later amendment that had to do with
multiple parties and not with any issue that I am aware of
that we are talking about this afternoon.
After extended consideration, it concluded that
a retention of the older federal, rule ws.s desirable and
that this rule needed only the exercise of a discretionary
power to afford a remedy in the infrequent harsh case to
provide a simple definite workable rule.
by amended Rule 54(b).

This is ailorded

It reestablishes an ancient policy

with clarity and precision.

And the initial sentence in

the revisors ’ note is, !5The historic rule in the federal
courts has always prohibited piecemeal disposal of

litigation and permitted appeals only from final judgments
except in those special instances covered by statute.”
Now. this ancient rule as it existed and was con­
sistently applied by this Court prior to the 19*46 amendment
was that there should be no appeal and that there could be
no appeal -—
QUESTION:

There is no question but that 5Mb) is

an exception to that rule, and the question in this case is
the breadth of that exception, isn’t that correct?
MR. GRONER:
QUESTION:

Yes. indeed.
You would concede that 5Mb) is what­

ever its scope is an exception to that rule?
MR. GRONER:

Yes Indeed.

Yes indeed, Your Honor,

and the question as we would see before this Court is
whether that exception is to be interpreted and applied
narrowly as was intended by the revisors so that there will
be fundamental adherence to the rule against piecemeal
appeals or whether there shall be deviation from ‘chat rule,
spreading the exception so wide as to embrace virtually
every money judgment case.
QUESTION:

What you have to tell us and what I

take it you are telling us and about to enlarge on is that
the loss of $1.8 million a year, that it was an abuse of
discretion for the District judge to say, to believe that
the loss of $1.8 million per year on this interest problem

25
was simply not founded, but that didn't bring it within the
infrequent exception rule?
MR. GRONER:

That is precisely our position, Your

Honor, and it is precisely our position that if there is to
be an exception based upon the fact that there is a money
judgment and that the market rate of interest, that is to
say the rate charged to borrowers of funds, exceeds the
statutory interest rate, those grounds would apply to every
money j udgment»
QUESTION:

Are you saying in effect that it has

to be a situation almost like Chrysler Motor Company that
is on the verge of bankruptcy so it can get some cash right
away ?
MR. GRONER:

That would be the type of case that

we would think the framers of the rule intended and would
%

be an infrequent harsh case, because that would be a case
that would present special circumstances.

To say that the

ordinary money judgment presents special circumstances
could not —
QUESTION:

Well, Is a judgment of this size, does

that fall in the category of an ordinary money judgment?
MR. GRONER:

judgment?
MR. GRONER:

QUESTION:

It isn’t very ordinarys is it?

MR. GRONER:
QUESTION:

I!m sorry, Your Honor?
It is not very ordinary„

MR. GRONER:

It depends, Your Honor, on whether

we are adopting an absolute standard or a relative standard*
To me that is huge.

On the other hand, there may be cor­

porations — Curtiss-Wright may be included — to whom this
would be the same kind of relative money judgment as perhaps
a few hundred dollars would be to us*
In any event, it was not so large a sum that
Curtiss-Wright even tried to present to the District Court
any specific grounds for saying that this is an infrequent
harsh case*
QUESTION:

When you say "us," you’re not referring

to General Electric, are you?

$1.8 million being to

Curtiss-Wright like a few hundred dollars would be to
General Electric?
MR. GRONER:

No, Your Honor, I was really only

trying to apply it relative to us, and in all candor I do
know how the relative test would come out for any individual
or for any corporation.
QUESTION:

Well, speaking of relativity, Mr.

Groner, I suppose if the advisory committee in the rulemaking process was trying to have some firm rules that

27
would be applicable forever* $20 million in 19^6 isn’t the
same as $20 million in 1930* is it?
MR. GRONER:

I suppose not, Your Honor, but again

I repeat that it is a large sum of money and, as a matter
of fact, that is one of the two grounds that we respect­
fully urge as not a proper ground for the District Court to
take into account.

The District Court said this is a large

sura of money and it will earn a. large sum of money in
interest in terms of the difference between the statutory
interest and the market interest rate.
QUESTION:

Mr. Groner, can I suggest another ap­

proach to the case.

Perhaps one could read 62(h) as being

primarily directed at questions of solvency and collectability and things like that, and that 5^(b) is primarily
directed at the problems related to piecemeal appeals and
total conclusion of litigation.

And if the judge's dis­

cretion he thought it might expedite winding up the whole
case to get a part of it settled finally, that then the
rest of it might be settled by adjustment between the
parties.

Would that be a proper consideration for the

judge to take into account, that there is a better chance
of settling this monstrous litigation if vre get this $18
million item out of the way?
MR. GRONER:

Your Honor, the considerations in

Rule 54(b) are whether there ought to be an appeal at this

28
particular time.
QUESTION:

Correct, thinking in terms of getting

the whole case over.
MR. GROWER:

Thinking in terms of perhaps getting

the whole case over but weighing that in terms of the his­
toric policy against piecemeal appeal which has well-grounded
public policy considerations for it.

The effect upon the

litigation of the other claims would be a proper consider­
ation.

There is no indication here in any way that the

judge thought that the disposition of the litigation would
be expedited or facilitated by resolution of this issue *
QUESTION:

It is a rare District judge who isn’t

constantly thinking about ways to get a case of this
magnitude settied.
MR. GROWER:

Well, Your Honor, there is no indica­

tion of that and if that was a consideration, that sort of
consideration may well be the kind of consideration that
ought to be weighed in terms of its significance as against
the historic policy against piecemeal appeals.
that

a

And to say

judge may certify as final under Rule 5Mb) and

require the Court of Appeals to pass on the appeal a piece­
meal disposition of a particular claim because he may have
an unarticulated opinion that it may expedite settlement,
does not fall we believe within the purposes or the effects
of the rule.

29
QUESTION:

On this record, he didn’t articulate

any such consideration.
MR. GRONER:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
What if the Third Circuit, Mr. Groner,

had said In this case, considering Rule 5Mb) and its rela­
tionship to the tradition against piecemeal appeals, that
in any case in which there is a pending plausible counter­
claim a District Court in this circuit shall not certify
for appeal a final decision pursuant to Rule

5Mb)?

Do

you

think that would be consistent with Sears, Roebuck v.
Mackey?
MR. GRONER:

We do not think that that Is what

the Third Circuit did.
QUESTION:
MR. GRONER:

Mine is a hypothetical question.
If they had done so, if they had

established a rule which actually barred the District judge
from certifying any case in which there was a counterclaim,
Te would not think that that would be a proper exercise of
discretion.

Certainly the framers of Rule 5Mb) intended

that there be discretion.

We are talking about the stand­

ards for the exercise of discretion, and to provide that
kind of absolute rule I don’t think we would regard it as
proper and the Court of Appeals did not do so.

And although

petitioner does attempt to frame the question at some point,
and even at some point this afternoon he stated that the

30

question was whether the certification should be barred when
there are counterclaims, that is not what the Third Circuit
did and in any event that is not a proper reading of Rule
5Mb).

QUESTION:

If it is not a proper reading of Rule

54(b) but is what the Third Circuit did, then it ought to
be reversed.
MR. GRONER:
Your Honor.

It is not what the Third Circuit did,

The Third Circuit said that in the absence of

harsh and unusual circumstances, the existence of a counter­
claim is a factor that ’weighs heavily against the certifica­
tion of a judgment as final.

In other words, what they
One, that this is a factor

which we think should be given importance; and, secondly,
precisely by wording it as a factor, they were saying this
is an issue where discretion should be allowed, we are not
barring, we are not putting forth any absolute rules, what
we are saying is that it is a matter of particular facts
and under these particular facts on this record that is a
factor to which we the Court of Appeals ascribe potent
✓

weight.
QUESTION:

Mr, Groner, if you know, has there

been any great rush of certifications under Rule 54?
MR. GRONER:
QUESTION:

We do not know, Your Honor, but —
I must say that there Is some

31
observation that in a general way up here, I have never
heard that there has been any great use of the rule of ex­
ceptions such as Judge Coolahan made here.
MR. GROWER:
Honor,

We have not made such a study, Your

We would submit that the reversal of the judgment

below would encourage more Rule 54(b) certifications and
more Rule 54(b) disputes.

We would not necessarily describe

it as a rush because in all candor we would have no way of
predicting it.
QUESTION:

Well, the fact is that the Mine Run

Plain Manila case doesn’t lend itself to 54(b) disposition,
does it?

MR. GRONER:

Compared to other issues, compared

to Rule 56 issues, for example -—
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. GRONER:
QUESTION:

—'certainly they are small in number.
Of course, the District judge here

obviously placed his emphasis on the extraordinary aspect
of this case, that is the large amounts involved, and cn the
fact that these issues could be treated separately and on
the fact that if he was in error in his exercise of dis­
cretion there could be a judgment, a collectable judgment
the other way.

Those three factors were all in his finding,

is that not so?
MR. GRONER:

Yes, Your Honor, but the large amount

of money was critical, it appears to us, not so much for its
own sake but for the difference in the interest rate which
it represented.
We would like to say first of all as to the amount
of money, what you have is a District judge who in effect is
saying, I am reaching a different decision because a claim
is large, because in effect there is a large corporation
making that claim

than I ’would make if the claim were small.

And we would respectfully submit that that is not an appro­
priate type of determination for a system which grants equal

33
justice under law, perhaps more significantly for a District
judge to be concerned with the difference in interest rate
between what state law has provided, and this in a diversity
case, and what he regards as the market rate of interest is
for him to be coiicerned with something which ought not to
concern him.
The State of New York, which was the governinr lav?
with respect to this issue, the State of New York has set a
particular percentage rate of interest on judgments.

The

legislature and the governor and the entire legislative pro­
cess of the State of New York must have been well aware of
the competing considerations, the desire for definiteness
for set rate in all cases as against the factors on the other
side, namely that there would be market variances and that
there might be the possibility in a commercial sense of ob­
taining a higher interest rate0
Now, the legislature of the State of New York
decided that it would provide a set rate, not a flexible
rate depending on a market rate, and it made that applicable
to the kind of judgment that is involved here.
QUESTION:

Do you know the date that that was

done?
MR. C-RONER:
QUESTION:

I believe 1970 or '71, Your Honor.
Well, the legislature always lags

behind the current facts, doesn't it?

MR. GROWER:

Well, I am not prepared to say that

about the legislature of the State of New York, Your Honor.
But in any event, if they do they would know that and it is
\

precisely that the legislature would take into account, Mr.
Justice Blackmun, what would happen in the future, that this
is a matter of legislative policy.

Certainly, the legisla­

ture understood that in the future there might be all kinds
of economic situations, there might be inflation, there
might be elevations in the interest rate.

They had the

possibility of making a flexible rate, precisely the kind, of
thing that is now before the Senate of the United States,
the Congress of the United States.

A Senate bill passed by

the Senate is now before the House which would make applic­
able the judgments in federal cases a variable interest
rate.

It would make applicable to judgments the interest

rate provided in the Internal Revenue Code which is tied
to the market rate.
Now, what is involved here is a judge in effect
saying what the legislature of the State of New York has
provided is improper, is unjust.

In my judgment in this

case, if I apply the law of the State of New York as the
legislature has adopted it and specified it, then CurtissWright will lose more money than >1 like to see a litigant
lose.

And in a diversity case we say to Your Honors that

that is an improper judgment for a federal district judge

35
to make.
We say further that the matter of interest rates
on judgments is clearly a legislative matter.

As I have

indicated, there is a Senate bill which seeks to change
that.

The Congress of the United States has many differ­

ent provisions with respect to interest in different
statutes.

In some cases they have provided for no interest

Twith respect to the United States.
provided different rates»

In other cases they

But the Congress has been the

one which has regulated that subject matter.
QUESTION:

And your submission is that it is

impermissible for a district judge to consider in any way
the difference between the going economic rate of interest
and the statutory rate?
MR. CRONER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Did the Court of Appeals say anything

like that?
MR. GRONER:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
That cuts down the scope of Rule 5k

quite a bit, doesn't it?
MR. GRONER:

We do not think so, Your Honor, be­

cause in our view —
QUESTION:

Well, you would take that out of —

you would say that is not a factor the district judge may
consider, you just said that.

36
MR. GROWER:

Oh, yes, Your Honor, but it is a

factor which he never was enabled to consider under Rule

5Mb).
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. GRONER:
QUESTION:

So we are not reducing the scope.
Well, who tells us, where do we find

out that he never was able to consider that?
MR. GROWER:
different sources.

You find that, Your Honor, from two

One is the provision or the guidance

provided by the advisors.

If they had thought when they

specified the Infrequent harsh case, we submit that we are
talking about factors that are applicable uniquely to
particular litigants, we are not talking about factors that
are applicable to groups of cases.

That is one source of

our submission, that It was improper for the district judge
to take the rate of interest into account.
The second source is the very concept of whether
establishing and enforcing a rate of interest for judgment
lies within the judicial province at all, whether it does
now or whether it did when the rule was adopted or amended.
We submit to Your Honors that It clearly is not within the
judicial province, that Congress for federal judgments and
state legislatures for state judgments have provided what
the rule should be.

And we cite the Funkhouser case as a

holding of this Court which says that the establishment of

37
a rate of Interest on judgments is a matter for the legis­
lative province.
So we say to Your Honor that when a judge takes a
factor into account which is within the legislative purview,
he is not acting in a way which a Court of Appeals ought to
sustain as a proper exercise of judicial discretion.
QUESTION:

Mra Gronsr, in one sense I suppose the

question is whether he abused his discretion in finding no
just reason for a delay.

Does anything in the revisors?

notes or the history of the rule tell us on whom the burden
falls on the just reason for delay issue?

Is it upon the

proponent of the finding, does he have the burden of show­
ing there is no just reason or is it on the one who says
there is a just reason, fco point out the reason?
MR. GROWER:

In our view, it quite clearly falls

upon the one who is proposing that the judgment be final
and this is a reflection in our view again of the bedrock
consideration that the general rule is that there shall be
no piecemeal appeals.

So it is the supplicant for the

exception to the rule who has that burden and we say in
this case that there was no effort to meet that burden.
There was no effort to show that there was anything unique
about Crutiss-Wright which distinguished it from any other
holder of a money judgment which would justify holding this
to be the infrequent harsh case.

38
The fact that the extent to which the claims and
counterclaims may be independent or the prospective mootness
of the issues in our view set the stage.

They do not deal

xtfifch the question which is whether or not the time of the
Court of Appeals and of the parties should be taken up with
an appeal at this particular time.
I note3 for example, that the judge found that
granting the certification would not prevent the rest of the
case from coming to trial.

He did not say that it would aid

it and, quite clearly, any time there is an appeal there is
some diversion of the attention and scope of resources in
litigation from the trial process to the appellate process,
and this

is part of the public policy which is involved in

the ruleagainst piecemeal appeals and

this is the general

rule which is involved in our view in this case.
Mow, it might

be pointed out that the funds that

are of concern here are

not funds that have been available

to the use of the General Electric Company.

They are funds,

if you want to look for them, they are in a public FISK.
General Electric, under its prime contract, receives the
funds only as reimbursement after it pays them out, so that
the actual funds are funds in the treasury rather than with
General Electric and that is where they have been during
this time.
In our view, to say that because considerations

39

are appropriate under one federal rule of civil procedure,
they may not be applied under another federal rule of civil
procedure is plainly inaccurate.

Whether or not any of

these considerations are appropriate to an application
under Rule 62(h) is beside the point, in our view, as to
whether or not they are proper under Rule 5Mb).

Each of

these rules has different functions and the function of
Rule 5Mb) is related to the traffic to the appellate pro­
cess and the exception to the general rule is a narrow one*
Whether or not there ought to be a stay pending an appeal
or pending some other time is not the province of Rule
5Mb).

In effect, the disposition by the Court of
Appeals here right now has led to the same practical result
as a grant of a 62(h) stay because in effect the Court of
Appeals has said that there will be no execution of the
judgment and there will be no appeal of the decision until
after there has been trial of the other claims.
Thank you, Your Honors..
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Del Deo, you have about four minutes left.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH N. DEL DEO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MRo DEL DEO:

Thank you, Your Honor.

In the first place, the difference between

40
prejudgement interest rate and the interest which we would •
get even if this judgment were final and stayed is consid­
erable because the New York prejudgment interest rate is
significantly lower than che interest rate applicable to
judgments, so the last statement that was made that this is
the same effect as a stay under 62(h) is inaccurate.
We would still love half a million dollars —
there is half a million dollar differential a year just in
the difference of prejudgment-post-judgment interest rates.
Besides3 prejudgment interest rates are meant to apply
before a claim is finalized and adjudicated.

Our claim is

final, it has been adjudicated.
QUESTION:

Do you equate that to property?

MR. DEL DEO:

Well, I think also the deprivation

of property in and of itself — the difference in the
interest rate show you how much the loss is.

The loss of

have it to use in their operations.

noted that this was going to be a lengthy proceeding, so
it is not just the loss of that much money, it is the loss

why the discretion was given to the District Court Judge.

MR. DEL DEO:

If you win the case you might not get

anything.
MR. DEL DEO:

Well.. Your Honor, we will always

get the $20 million but we will never recoup the difference
in the interest at the end of the case.
Now, I read from this advisory committee note
that was referred to.

It says Rule 5Mb) was originally

adopted in view of the wide scope and possible content of
the newly created civil action in order to avoid the
possible injustice of a delay in judgment on distinctly
separate claim to await adjudication of the entire case.
That is exactly what we have here.

We have injustice re­

sulting from the delay of our claim.
The Third Circuit wishes to equate the kind of
injustice we have to show over and above the obvious in­
justice to something; relating to insolvency and economic
duress.

But if we were insolvent, my opponent would be

here saying that we shouldn’t get the money because we would

go broke and lose it if we had to pay it back.

So that

QUESTION:

Could I ask you. if a counterclaim

hadn't been pending would you think the Court of Appeals
would have said that certification is all right?
MR. DEL DEO:

In similar cases vrhic'n this Court

has had, in Liberty Mutual and Tildon, the Court of Appeals
in the Third Circuit has permitted such cases to come to be
certified.

In fact, they did it erroneously —
QUESTION:

Even though the reason may be that

just the reason that the District judge relied on here?
MR. DSL DEO:

Yes, they never used harsh unusual

circumstances in cases without counterclaims that I know of.

turning point in the ease.
MR, DEL DEO:

It Is —

Is the reason that they imposed the

different standard.
MR. DEL DEO:
