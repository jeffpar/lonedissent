GRAB ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. BURKE*
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR, BURKEs

Mr, Chief Justice* and Kay it please

the Courts
C|®'45 issue in thsss eases is whether or ret ttc
contractual right of acceleration in a consumer' credit
contract mmt be disclosed, under the Truth Xa Lending Act*
or Regulation 2* promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board,
The right, of acceleration is not cautioned anywhere
•if. .

feh® specific disclosure requirement of th® Act or the
regulation.

In fact* acceleration isn't sentidned anywhere

' i‘if -«tiny provision of the Act or the

regultion,

Respondeat» have relied on two different section»
' of 'the regulation in an effort to gleam • a requirement on th®
• p*u.'t oi wu) «rtftitioMMtr® to

the acceleration clause,

In the District Court the Respondents relied upon
Section 226.8(b)(4) dealing with default charges and X will

ts&mi to that section in more detail in & mesaent.
In the Court of Appealsr the Ninth Circuit* th®
i

Respondents focused heavily upon 22S0 8C&I (7) * which was not
■ raised in fch® District Const* which deals with the credife©r5®

rebates policy upon, pre-payment of the pra-computed, coaamaxcredit contract»
The facts in th© case are simple and for the most
part are undisputed.

The Milhollin’s and Mrs. Eaton entered

\

. into conditional sale contracts with the Petitioners for the
purchase cf seter vehicles.

ktmmuirniemxy

Ehik.coi.t»i*efca

assigned to Ford Motor Credit Company.

The contracts had

provisions on both the front and the back side*, with the
front

3id©

serving m the Petitioner's disclosure statement

'"/'required by the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation 3.

The

side clearly disclosed all default charges imposed by

the Petitioners in Paragraph 12«
Paragraph 14 advised the Respondents that in the
■ svj»it they prs-peid the coasi»r credit contract for any
,:p»m at my "tlms* whether or -not there was a default in

This is consistent, by the way

•and ways followed by the creditor's as

\

" as the record

indicates p at all tlsses relevant.
The contract oont^liwai? » default clause -rhich
obtained the usual creditor remedies f including th© right

of

acceleration.

This clause was set forth clearly.in

paragraph 1® of the contract on th© rewrsa side e but was not
separately rep-aatad on the front side ©£ the contract* fch©

5

disclosure provision® of the Truth In Lending Act.
The District Court could find no provision of the
Act or th® regulation requiring disclosure of acceleration
clauses*

Howeverf it held that the acceleration clause should

be disclosed under the spirit of the Act* henceforth all
creditors sre required to do so.

It is in Section 226.6(a) .

Wow, th® Respondent® fell into default under the
contracts.

After efforts by Ford 2fotor Credit to bring the

coatraets current failed, the vehicles war® 'repossessed and
these Truth In Lending actions followed by th® Respondents
against the Petitioners«
Th© Ninth Circuit in' its decision held that disclosures
of acceleration clauses are never required under Section

And therefore was able to hold 'under 226^.8 (fo?4(7)
the creditor auist disclose whether it rebates finance

I saight point out here that Section 226„8(bJ (7)

W© submit that a careful -analysis of the appli^&b.V
sections of 'th® regulation, an application of th® Federal
Reserve Board*® official sfeaf^interpretation, and substantial

?
policy considerations dictat® that the court’s decision below
should be reversed»
The Federal Reserve Board has issued an official
staff interpretation saying th© disclosure requirements
incident to an acceleration clause, with respect to
Ford, which i© printed in full in our opening brief, that
requires that the creditor disclose the amount or method of
computing the amount of any default, delinquency, or similar
charge© that are payable in th© event ©f late payment»
This language in the hcfe is very similar»

The Federal Reserve

board ha® include in it® official staff interpretation that
"the right of acceleration is © creditor remedy, it is a
coatfact right? it is not sm amount that dan b@ disclosed,
«.or is it payable' with late payment of contract installments»
Hhatlshe Board concluded in its OSX is that th©

of acceleration' need not ''fee'

* th^t is whet
'

■■is referred to in (b)(4) is a pacific pecuniary charges that
'are payable with'late payment©'.©* the type disclosed fully
by viia Petitioners in this case in paragraph Ik of their

ebbtract»
I might’ note right here that this \i®su® has been
considered by seven Circuit Courts and virtually ©very Circuit
Court ha® unanimously agreed'with th© Board csss this issue,
that the right:©* acceleration need not be' disclosed under
Section (b)(4)..

Thera is no cpnflict ©m that point»

acceleration, X

think

it is clear that the judgnent below

has to be reversed»
What X would like to describe briefly for the Court,
it is set forth in greater detail in Petitioners® reply
brief in the Appendix to his reply brief, is the procase
pursuant to which official staff interpretations are issued,
The Court in the Mourning case has indicated that
where reasonable Binds smy differ as to which of several
• remedial saethods should b© chosen*.the Court should defer
to the informed judgment of the agency,

And her® the agency

that Congress has vested authority to promulgate rules and
regulations is the Federal Reserve Board,

The part of the

Federal Reserve Board that deals with the Truth In Lending
Act .is the Office of Consumar Affair» of the Federal
Reserve Board,

And these offitsial staff interpretations

are the product of a specialised group of people within th®
staff of tha Board which are expert in the area of consumer
credit.
»

We think that is why they ought to be entitled to
i

great deference*

.

To begin with, let me say at the outset before X
begin t© ds@cr.ib© the process, that Congress itself has
>

recognised that official staff interpretations of th® Board
• are such that they ought tc be given deference.

14
In 1074 Congress asaaacted

Jrwtb Ik tending Act

to provide for civil and criminal iaaaunity if a person acts
•

t

in good faith, relies upon the Board®s interpretation»

But

two years .later Congress determined that good faith reliance

on the Board* a interpretation wee insufficient and they
extended the immunity to good faith conformity with say
interpretation or approval by a doxy authorised official or
employee of the. Federal Reserve'System»'
In our view# this 1976 amendment demonstrates a
congressional vote of confidence in the quality and reliability
of tilts* official staff interpretations»

Ant the process

i

which is set forth in the appendix to the Petitioner's reply
brief we think confirms the correctness of this congressional
vote-of confidence»
Official staff interpretations are issued in
response to inquiries by private parties e either debtors
f

»

or creditors» to the Federal Reserve Board»

And when the

inquiry comes in the matter is assigned to a staff attorney
f’° prepare a draft.

And fch© reason 2 am going into this in

great detail is because the other side has characterised
these official staff interpretations as the work of a lone
attorney or a lone Board employee,,

And really nothing could

ba further from the truth, because the draft is prepared by
a lone person but then the process involves a very deep and

15
detailed consultation with other staff attorneys , section
chiefs and officials ©f the Consumer Affairs Office of the
Federal Reserve System*

After the matter is then discussed

t*ith various officials who have ..'desoBStEated fasiliurity
with the particular problem and the official staff
interpretation is only issued after further review by a
. V

f

•

Section chief and approval by two officials of the'Consumer
Affairs Office,,of the Federal Reserve Board*

New, this is not the end of the matter, because
then the official staff interpretatio is sent to the
Federal Register for publication*

And in. 19*77, when this

official staff interpretation — the one at issue her® —
was promulgated, the Board then had a practice of issuing
some OSI’s with iaEsadiately effectiva dates and some with
delayed effective datos.
But the implication was th© stea and that is the

,

If"

public was entitled t© make comments,

'

'

*

By “the public,® I
'^•«s

•mean not only the eosis&unity of cons users but the banking
'.community and the’ people who lend in the conauaar credit:
area,’
i .

• .

*

This particular OS I was issued with an immediate
effective date but there was a provision, as X said, for
reconsideration upon request.
reconsideration ©f this OSI,

There was n© request for

IS

Mew* «XI OSX1 s were then and mm reviewed quarterly
by a Consumer affairs Cosaadtfcse which i© a committee of members
of the Federal R@s®rv@ Board itself who hav© been assigned
oversight responsibility over the work ©f the Office of
Consumer Affairs —« X think it is called Community Consumer
Affairs new — of the Federal Reserve Board,
How* as of April 19* 1978 the Board amended its
procedure to provide for a delayed effective date ©f 30 days
with respect to all official staff' interpretations and &
■ period of public coawent»

And the period of public comment

is us@fv.l to provide the Board with input from people who
are affected by thes© technical interpretations«.
Between August 1976 and April 1978P 147 0S0*s were
issued under Regulation 2,

Six were reconsidered pursuant to

request and none were ©hanged*
Under the new procedure where everything gets a
delayed effective date* 20 official staff interpretations have
been issued* nine have been considered? and again* non® have
beer» changed,
Hi® point that wa think is important here for the
Court is that this entire process is marked by very careful
consideration and it is the product of the' special expertise
of a group of highly trained people who have demonstrated
deep familiarity with the cons wiser credit field.

And it is

V

11

v

\

important that these official staff interpretations revive
f
deference, because as corns® 1 for the Petitioner has properly
pointed out, these technical questions require authoritative
answers by a central authority.,

And indeed the disarray
'

i

in 'this eas® is indicetiv® of the problems that arise 0

,

We

now hav© five or sir; differant circuit® who have expressed
thessselves on the question of pre-payraent under the finance
0

disclosure charge policy and eech have indicated slightly
differant ways that they would go about providing for this
disclosure*
QUESTION I At this point, with all tills disarray,
the Board hasn,!t really don® very ranch by way ©f rule-making
to straighten out the disarray, have they?

MRo SMITH;

Well, the Board has spoken in OSI

PC-0054 which it believes is the —
QUESTION;
MR* SMITH;

But nothing by for.miL rule-ranking<>
Nothing by formal rule-making although,

Mr* Justice Blackamn, X would think that once the litigation
commenced on this issue the Board might have — it might have
been inappropriate for the Board then —
QUESTION:
MR* SMITH:

The less the agency is going to d©„
Well, yes*

But I think that if -this

Court holds as we submit it should that official staff
interpretations are entitled to deference, X think a lot of
this technical kind ©f litigation over very small questions

tradar the Act* small disclosure questions will ©sas® because
I think the statistics in the briefs have Indicated that the
volume of Truth In Lending litigation hm mushroomed
enormously as people-h&v© challenged the propriety ©£ © variety
©£ questions of disclosure under the Act»
QUESTIONS

The courts rather typically and frequasstiy

have simply disregarded the QSI*a. haven’t they»
MR»SMITHx
X think not*

Yes * although —* no, nb, I think not»

My understanding is they generally have followed

them and this case X think is an unusual instance where there
has been a wide variety ©f judicial rule-making in this area»
But X think* as our brief points out* generally they havs
been give the deference that w® think they deserve»
'Snd what X want to say. in closing is simply that this
judicial disarray has in ©ur view hampered enforcement by the
'various agencies that are given the enforcement power© under
the Act»

Because while privatb. "debtors or consumers can

bring actions under the Act# a variety of agencies, such as
the Federal Trad® CoEusission* the. Comptroller bf the Currency
—» they are all sbfc forth in 15 U„S„C„ 1507 ««* have

Nowf these, agencies necessarily have tb look t»

MR» SLOTTEE:

That is correct®

20
*■«* and Miss Donna Eaton

these ware two separat® trassactions

who purchased their automobiles from Ford Motor Credit
Company*
I would like to add Just one additional fact that
was not brought,out fey the Petitioner and that is the
Milhollin*s were two payments late on their contracts; whan
without prior notice Ford Motor Credit rep©sae®s®d their
automobile,,

On the same day as the repossession, the

Hilhollin* a offered to pay Ford Motor the ©asset assounfc of
the delinquent payments „

In fact Ford Motor denied this

and indicated that they accelerated the unpaid balance and
they demanded the entire unpaid balano® of th® contract*
There are thr®@ points which I would like fe© make
to the Court this afternoon*.
First, ©II the parties concerned* the Federal
Reserve Board staff* the Solicitor General* the consumers
.and Ford Motor Credit agree that in a contract like the on©
signed by the consumers in this case* the effect an the
finance charge of the process of acceleration is important
information to fe® disclosed to the eonsuteefs- under th®
provisions of th© Truth In Lending Act and Regulation &„
Second* the consumers could prevail in this ease
under either th© views expressed by th© Federal Reserve
Board staff or th© rational© of the court below»

We think

that the lower court * s ©pinion Is the batter rule sine©*

21

unlike the views ©£ th® Federal Reserve Board staff? it
consistently gu®,sr®nt@©s the disclosure of meaningful
information to the consusaer in all credit transactions.
Had third? the Federal Reserve Board itself has not
mad© known its position on this matter.
QUESTION;

Mr. Slottee, I don0t mean to get

anecdotal about this but supposing you have the most
consumer-oriented court or Board in the world and it is
trying to figura'out %fhat has to bs disclosed and what hasn’ tI a an rotaesaber a committe® I served on drafting a Truth in
Land Sales Act and we war© following a model of a State
which had a fchrse-pag® list of requirements that had to be
disclosed.

One of them? a particular disclosure was that

.during periods of high water all or parts of this lot may b©
under water.

It didn’t prevent the lot from selling at all.

Whereas? had it been, limited to just a few very important
things it might have prevented the lot from selling.
I would think that frosa a consumer's point of view
you 'would want a limited? but important, category of
information disclosed; and not just every conceivable thing
you can think of.
MR. SUQTTB&s

I certainly' agree with Your Honor

and. In fact, it has been raised by some.people that
what - in fact the Truth In Landing Act is doing is making
disclosure statements more confusing rather them simpler.

The first is — and if you «rill look at the Joint
Appsntfix page® -0 and 10 — the majority of: the provisions on
a contract are not those required by the Truth In Lending
Act and Regulation 2>«

Rather., there are teres that «re

inserted fey the creditors themselves, and is those extra
tenss that sr@ the terns that af© earning the contracts to
become longer and more confusing.
QOlSTSOMs

But isn't it from fear of litigatigo

like this that they insert thee?
MR, SLOTTES*

Hof Your Honor.

Th@ disclosures that

are on feh® face of the contrast or on a separate document —
they don't necessarily have to .-be cm the contracto— &sr©
fairly limited in their scope»

In this case the Petitioners

could have remedied th© violation by simply adding two words
to theiir disclosure which would.have, given the meaningful
information to the consumer that they needed prior to entering
the contract to be able to judge the effect on the, credit and
the cost of credit? should default to the contract be
accelerated»

The Solicitor General has stated several tines in
his brief that the Federal Reserve Board has in fact issued
i

an official interpretation on this*
Solicitor General is mistaken»

tod to this extent the

The only interpretat.ion that

has bees, issued is ah official staff interpretati.©» and there

23
have been three unofficial staff opinione that have boon
issued*

But there has been no award interpretationi

And

this is in fact the reason that the confusion among the
circuits and the various disarray in th© circuits has b&®n
created,, is the Federal Reserve Board, granted as the agency
authorised by Congress to implement the Truth In Lending
Act*, hae failed to issue an interpretation which will solve
the confusion which will answer the questions which will
tell consumers and creditors alike what disclosures have to
be made6
In that situation,, it Is natural that, the courts
haw stepped in, taken ©var for th® Federal Reserve Board
itself> and tried to resse&y the situation? end they have coma
up with six or seven different theories»
QUESTION?

Why don’t they follow th® QSX?

HR» SLQTTSEs

Thor® lias been on® OSI official staff

interpretation that was issued»
QUESTIONs

And that was F2-540

Haw the Courts of Appeal followed

that?
MR* SLOTTEKs

W@ hav© had basically three differ­

ent positions:
You haw got the Ninth Circuit position,, which didnrt
follow it»
Yoii had several other circuits which followed it
completely and several others which said disclosures never

24
haws to be made ©foottt acceleration.
1 will explain th® problem to you with the GS2«
The Minth Circuit and th® Pedsr&l Reserve Board official
interpretations basically agree that the process ©f
acceleration can affect th® cost of credit and that an early
termination of th® contract will affect the amount of th©
finance charge that is going to h© rebated and that is
information t© be disclosed to the consumer.

That is 'the

basis @£ th© official staff interpretation and that i© th©
basis of th© Minth Circuit opinion*,
Where the two part company is on the situations
'sehaa that disclosure has to b© made to th® consumer,,

The

Fedor©1 Reserve Board staff is concerned with th® affect
on the consumer of acceleration, whereas the Minth Circuit,
is concerned with th© information that will be given to th®
consumer about acceleration and its affect on the finance
charge.

Mid X think a good example is represented by 54.

One of th® purposes of the Truth In Lending Act —* and it
was indicated by the Petitioner -*» is to promote comparative
credit shopping by consusaarso

Now* if yen take official

staff interpretation 54 and apply it to a common situation
with two creditors o

Th© consumer is going out and trying to

shop for credit, to decide which is going to be th® best
credit deal for that consumer.

If these two creditors rebate

upon acceleration or payment after acceleration by exactly

25
the same sssthoid9 but they differ as to prepayment sine®
that one creditor zebates by the sane method in both
situations and the other creditor differs f the first creditor
will only have to disclose the prepayment methods

The

second creditor will haw© t© disclose both th@ prepayment
method and the method for acceleration»

The consumer will

loot at those contract® end* despite the fact that both
creditors rebate upon acceleration by the same method* will
»•
see only one rebate disclosure for acceleration*

Th©

consumer would reasonably believe that the first creditor
has a better deal for him* or her* because there is no
indication about any finance charge rebate ®r lack thereof
on acceleration„ and th©r© is no way the consumer could
reasonably «easingfully corapar&tiue shop in that situation?,

MR* SL0T3BE:

Es&etXy* Your Honor#

The mmsond problem with staff interpretation 54 is
it, doesn®t answer the question of what to d© when the contract
■has a ps»*pspisit disclosure on the front and an acceleration
clause on the back -that says that the creditor has the right
to accelerate the unpaid balance but doe© not disclose the
method by whidSi that rebate for the finance charge will
remain,

tod what the staff has said in this situation is

you look t© undisclosed non-binding creditor policy fc©
' V .

determine what in fact the creditor will do.

You basically

say what is the policy of th® creditors if the policy of the
creditor* regardless of the contract term* is to rebate the

sam?, as for pre-payment* then no disclosure has to be made.
If the policy of th© creditor is to rebate for other than
pre-payment* then they have''‘to make a separate disclosure,
tod there are numerous problems' of this.
The first is*

How is the consumer* the person

whom the Act is intended to protect* going to be able to
0

determine what th® undisclosed policy of the creditor is.
<

Second* that policy is not binding.

If is a non-

*$

written* undisclosed policy,, it is' not binding on the creditor
and it is not binding on the creditor's assigns©.,

tod that

in fact frustrates the enforcement mechanism jot th® Act.

Sine® acceleration ©r rebate of tb® fiaasos ©harg© is not
going to occur until there is a default? and that i® when
the policy of the creditor will in fact become known r that

In the early 19?G*s acceleration

.and that is it has been indicated that there feave been a lot
©f Truth in Lending suits filed in th® United States -and that
t

the number is signifioantiy increasing.

Apfd the implication #

though it h®@net been B&id directly# is that a number*of these

I hm® several comments to that.

First# there is nothing in th© record and th®r® is
*

no citation in any cases -that I know of that says anything
that these increased Truth in Lending suits are in fact
frivolous,

In fact, I think what they nay represent is the

lack of creditor compliance with th®

tarsia of Truth in

And I would also mention something that this Court

stated just

several months ag© in Ryder v, Sonotorae which

authorised privat® class actions under the Antitrust Act,

41
sam© concern was raised by Sonotoaa in that case and
th© Court said basically that is not an unimportant

adequate funds for judges to handle the Truth in Lending

it is cons ci©ntieus ly attempting to d© so.
However* th® problem is the industry cm*t place
any substantial degree of reliance upon the Board and staff
interpretations if courts such as the court below refuse to
pay deferens© to those interpretations»

The industry can®t

afford t© change their contract forms each time a new case
{

comas down with an additional disclosure that that, particularjudge thought should h® provided»

And at the same time

’they can® t afford not to change their forms because ©£ th©
punitive liability aspects of the Act which could be ruinous
to small creditor®.
As a resultr wh&t they arc doing is the logical
thing;-

They ar© over-disclosing in an attempt to anticipate

and fend off legal challenges of th© type raised here»
The result is that the disclosure forms are long ~-

I have seen forms that are two or three feet long — they
are confusingf they are non--uni form f and that itself is a
violation t or could be a violation ©f the Act and the
regulation.
If© submit that there is a simple way out „

And

that is if the official staff interpretation is followed and
applied in this css®, if. will have two healthy effects.

44
First, til© Board will fee, encouraged to continue to
us® its interpretive powers to attempt to bring some semblance
of uniformity and- simplicity into this ansa*

This will

benefit creditors * to be s'ar©? but it will also benefit
consumersf because the foras can be shorter and'simpler and
easier to understand, if creditors knew that they can placa
reliances upon the Board's interpretia® guidelines»
The second beneficial effect of following the OSI
c

in this ease is it will permit the system to operate -the
'V

•

way Congress and th® Board intended it to operate, and that
i® when the Board ©r the staff publishes an OSI for comment
in th® Federal Register, creditors* consumers, any interested
person will make their views known to the Board at that
time rather than to wait until subsequent litigation to attack
th© Board's views*

Th® Board and staff can then assess th®

views and positions of all interested parties at that time,
which will vastly improve its decision-making process*
In abort, it will no longer fee possible for an interest group
or a person to sit bad;, allow an 031 -to be published for
comment, allow it t© become final, allow the industry to rely
\

upon -it, and then attack it in a trial court action, attempt"
lag to convince & trial judge that th© Board could have done
better» as was don©- in this s®sea
We submit therefore, for all of these reasons, that
th® decision of th© court below should fee reversed*
