MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

now. Mr. Ely,
MR. ELY:

The primary question before the Court,

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, is whether
the Boulder Canyon Project Act, this Court's opinion in
Arizona v. California, and its two decrees in that' case
require the Secretary of the Interior to deliver water in
satisfaction of present perfected rights in excess of X60
acres per owner.
If time permits, I would, refer also to two other
issues in the case, namely the finality that we feel
attaches to the conduct of the Department of the Interior
and the other judicial approaches to this matter over a
period of some thirty-odd years and finally briefly the

three issues, I may say*
The area involved in the Imperial Valley, the
Court may recall, is below sea-level, it was irrigated
starting in 1901 by a canal that took off in the United
States and followed an ancient river channel through
Mexico, the Mama --it Is shown in yellow on this map —and back into the United States.

This was don® without

It continued, the area continued to

be irrigated in that fashion for soma forty years.
The area under irrigation grew gradually1 from
about 100,000 to the precise figure of 424,145 acres as
of the effective date of the Boulder Canyon Project which
was June 25 s 1929«.
1979 so determined.

This Court’s decree of last January
It adjudicated that the present

perfected rights, that is rights to water for a specific
area of land, 424,145 acres, had been established Tinder
state law by valid appropriations with the priority of
1901 and that the quantity diverted and used in the
effective date of the project, 1929, was 2,600,000 acrefeet
QUESTION;
MB. ELY;

Where was that determination*?
That is in this Court’s decree of

January 1979» in Arizona v« California.
QUESTION:

That is a supplemental decree that

It determined the -present perfected rights of some 17
defined tracks of land in Arizona and 59 in California,

in holdings larger than 160 acres.

7
QUESTION;

What standing doss state law have

under the reclamation laws?
MRo ELY:

The Bounder Canyon Project Act

this CourtTs 1964 decree, I should say, defined present
perfected rights as rights acquired under state law and
perfected by the application of a specific quantity of
water to a defined area of land by the effective date of
the project act,

The Court in its definition adopted the

state law as the key to the magnitude and priority of
the present perfected right,

The problem here arises from primarily section
6 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act read in connect ion
with section 14.

Section 6 directed th€ Secretary of the

Interior to so operate Hoover Dam and Lake Mead as to
satisfy three functions*.

First flood control, naviga­

tional flood control; second, irrigation and domestic
t-;

uses; and the satisfaction of present perfected rights
pursuant to Article 8 of the Colorado River Compact.

I

Article 8 of the Colorado River Compact de­

clared that present perfected rights are unimpaired 'by
this compact.

It did not define the term but the legis­

lative history makes — as reported to Congress during
the Project Act debates, make it very clear that the
present perfected rights being talked about are the
very ones involved here<,

Imperial Irrigation District

B
representatives appeared before Mr. Hoover and the Com­
missioners and granted protection if there ms going to
be an interstate allocation of water.
Article 8 refsrs to the very lands involved
here.

The rights ware perfected by the application of

water to these same lands, the 233s000 acres of excess
lands.

This was well known to Congress and during the

course of the debates on the Boulder Canyon Project Act ,
you may recall, there were Swing-Johnson bills* the
question arose as to whether the land limitations of
the reclamation law of 160 acres per owner should apply
to these lands9 and the decision was plainly that they
should not.
There were no less than five efforts made in
the two Houses to add. a specific section, to the Project
Act which would have extended the l60~a«re limitation to
these lands, and each of these failed.

A House committee

included such language in one bill, the Senate when it
passed its bill omitted it.

Three time» in the Senate

Senators Phipps, Hayden, an Ashurst

offered amendments

to do this.

Each of these web abandoned because it had

no support.

The law as enacted does not contain any

specific acreage limitation on the presort perfected
rights.
It doss contain in section I1! a direction that

9
this act shall be dseisai a supplement to t-he reclamation
law which will govern the construction* operation and
mEintanance of the projecta except as otherwise provided
in this act3 and the question Is whether this crossreference to the reclamation law somehow overrode section
16*s mandate to satisfy

present perfected rights»

Mow the consequence if it did is that the
Secretary cannot deliver water to some 233,000 acres that
this Court has adjudicated to be within the 424*000
adjoined present perfected rights.
QUESTION;

Well* they could deliver it if the

land was in 160 •—» all held by persons c wning no mere
than 160 acres.
MR. ELY;

right is compelled to sell* the effecta according to. our
opponents * brief it thin:

It must be sold at desert

land prices * $25 to $50 per acre and it will revert to
desert.
Mow* you may or may not agree with that eonsequence of the statutes but that Is what our opponents
say and that is the basis upon which the Ninth Circuit
decided the case.
QUESTION:

And tinder that approach it Is a

truism to say that the landowner could sell no water.

10
MR. ELY:

That is correct a

action brought by the government to require an injunction
against the Imperial Irrigation District to require it to
cease deliveries of water in excess of 160 acres.

After

a trial, Judge Turpentine decided against the United
States in a well considered opinion in which he said it
was repugnant to the mar.date that water be delivered in
satisfaction of present perfected rights to say that
water should be withheld from 233*000 acres enjoying
such rights.

11

The United States did not appeal*

Solicitor

General Griswold in a memorandum for hie files , which has
Just been made publicf just been made available to us
last February 20 by publication In the Congressional
Record and which is annexed to our reply brief in fulls
gave his reasons for not doing so.

MR* ELY:

It was placed in the Congressional

Record by Senator Nelson end I don't know the circus*»
stances under which he same in possession of it*
In any event a he referred (Mr,. Griswold) to
the fact that this question had been considered and de­
cided by Secretary Wilbur of the Department of the
Interior in 1933 and he had decided that, under the
reclamation law tha standing practice of the•law dating
at least from 1910 and the legislative history of th;eBoulder Canyon Project Act, the excess land laws-' were
not intended to apply here.

'This had been seme 13 months

Mr„ Griswold refers to all of this in his memo­

appeal.
QUESTION:

fir. Ely, do you regard this Interpre­

tation of the Secretary as the kind of interpretation
described by Justice Jackson5 a opinion in Skidmore v.

Swift Company, where the Secretary Is net authorised
specifically to make rules but is th© one charged with
administering the statute and follows an administrative
practice?
MR. SLY;
Rehnquist.

bility of putting & statute in motion and this is exactly

There is no assurance at all that Dr. Yellen would, he the
lucky buyer.

If the honey pot is this big and this good,

I suppose there would be hundreds of thousands of bidders
literally fro® all over the country.
QUESTION:

Doesn't that have something to do

with his standing to intervene in this ease?
MR. ELY:

Well, we think so, Dir. Chief Justice.

The irony is intensified by the fact that the' very' seme
group have brought a suit in District Court to enforce
the residency requirements of the reclamation law,'- and
that had been decided

In

their favor and was appealed by

the felted States and that ease was decided fey the Ninth
Circuit in the same opinion that decided this, held that
the same group did not have standing to enforce a
residency requirement because there is no assurance that
they would be the lucky buyers, but turned right around
and held that they did have standing in this matter.
Now, there is one added item on standing. Mr.

16

Chief Justice.

The statute under* which this action is

brought, which is section 46 of the 1926 Omnibus Adjustmerit Act, provides that the Secretaries authority to fix
the price on resalea that is on sale of the excess lands
by the original owner» shall expire when half of the debt

He could choose the taker, he could make

an'interstate allocation, h© can make intrastate alloca­
tion, but not so as to present perfected rights.
In some ten references to the present perfected
rights which we have collected In the appendix to our
reply brief, the Court said the Secretary is fettered
with respect to these, that they are ono of the most im­
portant limitations in the act, are of vast Importance

So the three points that I had hoped ft©-QUESTION:

SSr. .Ely, again the United States

isn’t suggesting that the water — if the irrigation
district just refused to deliver water to anybody who
owns more than X60 acres but then sales took place, the
irrigation district would have the water to delivery to
anybody who owns 160 acres?
MR. ELI:

Yes.

The contention Is that if the

landowners decide not to sell for $25 or $50 an acre but
to wait for a bettor da;/, that the district can redistribute
that water to others*

Mr. Bender.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES W, BENDER, ESQ.£
01? BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BBHDER:

Mr, Chief Justices and may it

please the Court:
The central ii sue in this case, as Mr. Ely has
made clear, is what Congress intended in 1928 when it
passed the Boulder Canyon Project Act.

There is somewhat

of an unreal quality about that question because we know
that its answer is one that in the true historical sense
we can't define today.
Mo one today Las the capacity to look back fifty
years and say with certitude what Congress intended in
1923.

The legislative history which has been itemised in

the briefs seems to indicate almost overwhelmingly that
there was no intention to impose a brief limitation.

But

21
©VSR with that evidence we

can’t be certain we are en­

gaging In some reasoned conjecture when we a® counsel as­
sert what is clear and what is not clear.
But there is :in this case a cor© of fact that
we don’t have to conjee jure about» w© don’t have fee specu­
late about and it Is really the essence of this eas® and
It is the human experience of what happened after 1928»
beginning with Secretary Wilbur’s ruling9 the judicial
proceedings in Hewas and the lives that the people'In
Imperial Valley buJ.lt on that foundation.
That human experience is the essence of this
ease, not a bunch of postulating about what Congress; may
or may not have intended.

That human experience is what

should b© controlling in this cas®, I suggest, not syllo­
gisms about statutory syntax*
The fundamental practical fact of the matter is
that the contemporaneous construction of this^aet which
-itf
.
was begun in 1931 when the government negotiated tha
contract with the valley, is the bedrock upon which this
valley’s economy an! legal order has been based for almost
fifty years.

That bedrock started when the contract was

negotiated» it was perpetuated when the ©lectors, of the
district approved the contract, it was solidified when
Secretary Wilbur ruled that acreage limitation did not
apply, it was farther solidified when tie contract was

22
pi seed in Judicial proceedings „ the matt; ex* was put in
issue., and it was adjudged that acreage limitation does
not apply.
Wow, those eventa aren^fc conjectural.
the bedrock events in this valley's life*

Those are

And we are not

dealing with a situation where we have an administrative
construction that you cm overrule prospectively with
only minimal impact on people?s lives,
QUESTION

Counsel* there is the general rule

the government is not eitopped in the way an ordinary
party is by a long. ~~ even a fairly long history .of

;i-‘ -■■

::f' flatly wrong.

-■

HR,- BENDER:

r ■

That*& correct. Mr. Justice

;

^; i

Rehnquist9 but the premise cf that rule,, it seems fed; me*
is that the court will uphold the statua quo 'unless the
•master is free from doubt, unless there can be no -reasoned
argument in support of the status quo.
QUESTION:

So you say that in effect Secretary

Wilbur's letter is a permissible construction of the
statute even though perhaps not the only one?
MR. BENDER:

That is right» and it is permissible

because of the language of the statute* because of what
transpired in Congress when Reclamation Commis3loner Mead

23
said acreage limitation would not apply , because of what
happened in Congress when Congressman Swing said acreage
limitation would not apply.

There is a whole host of

grounds upon which one can base Secretary Wilbur's con**
atruction, including the governmental practice which was
embodied in regulations at that time, dating back to 19068
inspecting vested rights.
The administrative practice in this case has
given rise to reliance that is widespread and not conjec­
tural, and the reliance of private individuals in this
ease is awesome in its dimensions,
Since the 193d'e virtually every transfer of
land in this valley has assumed the validity of what
Secretary Wilbur said and what the Hewer Court said.
Virtually every family

sources to acquiring farmland at market prices 3 reflect­
ing the land's assumed ontitledment to *. perpetual' supply
of water.
Farmers have saade enormous investments in subsurface' drainage tile,

ionerete-lined ditches, leveling

their lands, purchasing equipment, all premised on what
has to be one of the moat fundamental expectations human
beings can have in an agricultural community, the assumed
security of the water rights appertinent to the land.

;,

Me can't recreate that vantage point

Me cannot duplicate their perspective of what

contemporary policy was or what happened. In the SwingJohnson proceedings*
Now, these people weren't ignorant officials.
Porter Bent, who wrote Secretary Wilbur's ruling, was
the Chief Counsel of the Bureau of Reclamation, a career
government attorney who had been Chief Counsel of the
Bureau of Reclamation since 1924.

His career as the

bureau’s chief officer spanned the last four years of
the debates on the Swing-Jofthson bills.

He was the

foremost legal authority in bis day on reclamation law.
He directed the compilation of the textbook on reclamation
law»

His immediate was Dr. Elvrood Mead.

of the founders of the project.

Dr. Mead was one .

He served on the All-

American Canal Board in 1919 which first recommended this.
He was the government5s principal witness in the SwingJohnson hearings and he was intimately familiar with
acreage limitation policy.
QUESTION 5
MR. BENDER:

Is Lake Mead named after him?
Yes, Your Honoi3.

He served on the

fact-finders board in 1924 which made the recommendations
on acreage limitation policy that were ultimately embodied
in section 46' of the 1926 act.

He was the government’s

principal witness in the hearings preceding that enact­
ment .
If anybody know what acreage limitation, policy
was it was Dr, Elwood Mead.

And clearly if Dr. Elwood

Mead had thought that non-application of acreage limita­
tion was an affront to national policy or reclamation law
he would have said so in Congress, but he stood in
Congress with Congressman Swing and said this act will
not apply to acreage limitation.

And clearly if he

thought that what he was saying was an affront to national
policy, he would hardly have arranged for the bureau's
counsel to assist the district In defending against the

23
allegations made in the Hewes proceeding about the 160acre limitation question,,
When that question arose in litigation in 1933,
Dr„ Mead arranged for the government to send, counsel to
help on that issue.

Clearly if anyone had thought, if

there had been any serious thought by these men who knew
what acreage limitation policy was, that the Wilbur ruling
was wrong, these events couldn’t have happened.

And that

is pure plain fact which we can’t escape from today.
We can stand hare today as latter day historians
and speculate about what administrative practice was in
the thirties or the twenties or about what Congress in­
tended, but Mead and Dent didn’t have tc speculate, they
took part in the ©vents of the day.

They knew what the

events of the day were, and their interpretation as a real
practical matter is far more likely to reflect the reality
of what Congress intended in 1928 than any hypothesis con­
structed by counsel today, whether it is. counsel for

petitioners or respondents»
How, in circumstances like these where there
is every practical reason to respect th« past, we come
to the pragmatic test which Mr. Justice Rehnquist re­

It is a necessary

on Irrigation, considering a plan which called for use

Mr. Weinberg said, well,

it may have to be litigated, I don’t know the answer to it.
Now, 1 would suggest to Your Honors that that is
a very revealing incident.

If this law were so clear that

it couldn’t be said — if it was as clear as Solicitor
Barry contended, if there wore no reasonable arguments

stand why Mr. Weinberg stood before Confess and said he
didn’t know the answer.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Solicitor General»

ORAL ARGUMENT OP MADE K. McCREE, JR.S ESQ.9
ON BEHALF OP THE RESPONDENTS
MR» McCRBS:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The government views this case as essentially
one of statutory construction requiring the Court to decile
whether the Congress intended to exempt the Boulder Canyon
Project from the excess acreage limitation that has been
an important part of reclamation law since the enactment
of the Reclamation Act of 1902»
Central to legislation to dispose of the public
lands has been a commitment to attempt to establish an
independent yeomanry of small family farms.

This was

first evidenced as early as 1862 in the Homestead Act
which provided an acreage limitation of 160 for a single
holding.

But It soon became evident that this acreage

limitation would not apply in the arid lands as the Plain
States were occupied because l60 acres was too small a
holding for grazing and the average homesteader lacked
the capital resources to permit irrigation.

32
There was a short lived Desert Land Act of 1897,
with an expanded maximum acreage allowance of 640 acres,
but this was abused when speculators began to amass large
tracts by what has been characterized by one writer as
fraudulent evidence of water having been brought onto the
land.

Someone would bring a pail of water and spill it

and that affidavit would follow and the land would be
given to the speculator»
With this prelude and against the backdrop of
the drought decade of 1386* the Heclamafcion Act ©f 1902
was enacted with a limitation of 16(3 acres as the maximum
amount of private land in single ownership that is
eligible to receive water from a reclamation project.
The Reclamation Act was amended and strengthened
in a series of successive statutes that culminated in the
Omnibus Adjustment Act of 1926*

Section 46 of which pro­

vided. in part that no water should be delivered upon the
i

;

completion of a new project until a contract shall have
♦

been entered, into between the Secretary- of the Interior
and an irrigation district providing for repayment of the
project cost and providing for recordable contracts to
be entered into by the holders of excess, acreage* that is
to say* acreage in excess of 160 acres for an appraisal
of the excess fey the Secretary and an agreement by the
owner of the excess to dispose of this property under

33
terms fixed by the Secretary and at prices not to exceed
the appraised value,
1 think we would differ with my brother who has
argued earlier and perhaps with the respondents who will
follow us in this respect:

Me read section 46 to provide

that the Secretary should not appraise it at the desert
price, as was stated, but at a price that would not take
cognisance of the Improvement of th© project, and in the
case of the Imperial Valley where there was water previous
to the Boulder Project, that that would he the value of
the land, the land favored by that water, irrigated by
that water which would be less, we submit, than th© value
of the land receiving the Boulder Dam water which was more
regular, more dependable and not subject to the vagaries
of our foreign affairs with our neighboz to the south.
QUESTION:

Axil the water I tale it that you

say the land already ha I before the project Is precisely
the adjudicated protected right?
MR, McCREE:

■

The adjudicated protected right,

that’s right, if th® Court please.

And you say the va3ue of that water

would be attributed to ;.he land that somebody would be
required to sell?

QUESTION:

We'Llj he could sell ifc5 he gets to

MR* McCREE:

But the land wi!3 be appraised ac­

cording to Its value as irrigated by that water,
QUESTION:

So the water follows the land and

the owner gets the value of the water,

Ke gets the value

of the land as irrigated land,
MR* McCREE:

As it was irrigated under the Alamo

Canal Project.
QUESTION:

Which is a present3y perfected right

that was adjudicated.
MR. McCREE:

But the water that is received now

is different fro© in many respects in the

form and manner

in which It is delivered fro© the- water that was received
earlier.
QUESTION:

Bu~; the amount that you are talking

about is the presently perfected right, that was adjudicated,
MR, McCREE;

The presently perfected right is

35
water to which the irrigation district is entitled*

There

is no .question about that,
QUESTION:

And each owner is entitled to be paid

for his share of it,
MB, McCREE:

Each owner is entitled to have his

land appraised for the purpose of section 46 of the
Ctemibas Act according to its vain® before the Boulder
Project was completed,
QUESTION:

The difference, General McCre'e, that

you are referring to is basically efficiency and certainty
pf delivery of the water, rather than the creation pjf new
M&c&r rights, isn’t it?

MR- McCREE:

the Gulf of California.

Through th© efforts of the- :

predecessors of the Imperial Irrigation District,- so»©
of its water was diverted into & dry river bed, the •
Alamo River, which preceded west and thin northerly into
what is now the Imperial Talley where there was a decline
of the land northward, mid it irrigated that valley before

36
th.s.3 project works of Boulder Dam, now the Hoover Dam, and
Lake Mead and the other project works were established.
These lands received that water prior to this
project, but not under the circumstances they receive it
now.

As a matter of fact, I’m sure the Court is familiar

with the history of this project when in 1905 the Colorado
River breached its banks and flowed north in such abun­
dance that it almost washed out the Imperial Valley, went
into the Saltan Sink and created the current Saltan Sea,
333,000 acres of water, and this still persists since
1905 =
Then there were drought periods where there
was ho water available to the lands and the uncertainty
of having the lands flooded as dramatically as they were
when the Saltan Sea was created or dry because the river
was not dependable during the summer months is the dif­
ference between what this project meant to the Imperial
Valley and what was there previous to its enactment.
QUESTION:

Mr» Solicitor General, suppose the

irrigation district had title to all the land at the time
that the Boulder Canyon Project Act was picsad, at the
time of the adjudication of the presently perfected rights,
suppose all the land was in one ownership, you would not
j
fee taking the same position, I suppose?

MR.

McCREE:

I suppose we would take the same

37
position based on the statute.
QUESTION:

So it really doesn't make any differ­

ence that the land is in a variety of ownerships and that
the perfected right was adjudicated to the district?
MR. McCREE:

That’s correct, the right is the

right of the district and not the individual owners.
QUESTION:

Yes, but it doesn't make any differ­

ence which one it is because you would take the same po­
sition even if it was all in one ownership.
MR. McCREE:

Yes, because section 46 of the

Omnibus Adjustment Act provided that no water should be
delivered from a reclamation project to any single
ownership exceeding 160 acres,.

QUESTION:

And the district holds it as

trustee for the various landowners, does it not?
MR. McCREE:

This is our undez standing of the

law,
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, suppose a

man now had 640 acres aid before this eg.se is decided he
sells three tracts of ISO each to three qualified,
eligible purchasers that leases back all of the land
sold and continues his operation as before, would that
be permissible?
MR. McCREE:

«There there is — Mr. Chief

Justice, the statute provides — this is section 46 of

the Omnibus Adjustment Act — that upon proof of fraudulent
representation the Secretary of the Interior is authorised
to cancel water rights.
QUESTION:

So whether —

My hypothetical Is that there is no

fraudt he sells it to three different owners each of whom
will have l60 and each of them leases back to him on a
legitimate lease —MR. MeCRES:

I want to think about that.

The

impact of the excess acreage requirement isn’t as
draeonian as it sounds.

For example, a husband and wife

can each have 160 acres and work that land together and
they would be entitled to receive water from the reclama­
tion projecte

A family with adult children might b© per­

mitted to have l60 acres for each spouse' and each child
who was a resident and who worked the land.

The Secretary

of the Interior has also applied the l6Q~acre limitation
to cover a trust where a trustee holds ;.and for more than
one beneficiary and. each beneficiary can have land up to
150 acres.
QUESTION:

But how do we know that some' subse­

quent Secretary won’t come along and say, just as
Secretary Udall did, that this thirty-year construction
of the act is wrong and we’re now going to change it?
MR. McCREE:

We have this assaranca, that after

the breakup of the excess acreage and after more than

39
one-half or at least one—half of the project works have
been paid for* the price limitation doe» not apply to sub­
sequent sales of the property and the statute so provides
also in section 46 of the Omnibus Adjustment Act of lg26.
QUESTION:

Well, my hypothetical* part of the

assumption is that it is a legitimate transaction* all on
top of the table, he could lease back, the one person
could lease back three other 160-aere tracts from his
vendee.
MR. MeCREE:
against that.

Well* I know of no prohibition

I can't direct you to a statute that

would forbid that or —
QUESTION:

Would that be a matter for the

Secretary to —
MR. MeCREE:

That would be a natter for the

Secretary to handle, as we understand.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you, Mr

MeCree, as to

the government's understanding of the meaning of section
46, do I correctly understand that it is your view that
the Secretary of the Interior did not have* by reason of
this statute did not have the legal authority to enter
into a contract with the Imperial District* the contract
itself should not have been entered into at all?
HR. MeCREE:

No, it is not our position»

He

had authority to enter into a contract with the Imperial

^!0
District, there is no question about his having that
authority.

We contend that the contract should have pro­

vided for the excess acreage limitation.
QUESTION:
MR, McCREE:
QUESTION:

But it didn’t.
It did not.
Doesn’t the statute, in your reading

of its flatly prohibit the contracts that he made that
says no water shall be delivered, and so forth?
MR. McCREE:

Nell, it doesn’t prohibit the

making of the contract, but It would prohibit the delivery
of the water pursuant to such a contract * that's correct.
QUESTION:

So it isn’t merely the Wilbur letter

but it is the fact that they have been delivering water
pursuant to an understanding of the statute with which
you disagree for all these years?
MR. McCREE:

Since the projeci began in the

early 1930’s,
QUESTION:

And really the case would be pre­

cisely the same even if Mr, Wilbur had never written the
letter, because you would still have the position taken
by the government of the United States on which everybody
acted because of their reading of the statute.
MR. McCREE:

3ut an effort was subsequently-

made to have the contract amended to conform with the
statute.

QUESTIOM:
MR. McCREE:

No», when was that9
This was first about 1964, I be™

lieve, efforts were made to have the contract reformed to
comply with the statute.
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

Yea, I understand that, but from —
But from about 1931 until 1964,

we submit that the administration of the waters from this
Boulder Project was contrary to congressional authoriza­
tion and direction.
QUESTION:

But the government wants to keep the

money that was paid.
MR. McCREE:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?
Wasn’t money paid pursuant to this

contract?
MR. McCREE:
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

The water was not paid for.
No, but I
The irrigation district was re­

quired to pay for the construction of the All-American
Canal, but the fact of the matter is the All-American
Canal had several power drops along the way and the
electricity that was generated in these power drops was
attributed to its share of the cost of the project works.
As a consequence, they paid nothing for this water which
has created the most desirable farmland certainly in that
part of the country, if not in the entire country.

It

hasn't cost anything, and we say this for their assertion
of reliance and their detrimental reliance and the dire
consequences that would result»
QUESTION:

Suppose the All-American Canal had

been built before the Boulder Project and they had been
using, it and their water had been runnir g through it —
MR. McCREE:
QUESTION:

It could have been express3.y ——
The fact is that tie district, was

entitled to the water»
MR. MeCREE:
exemptedo

But it would have been expressly

As this Court said in Ivanhoe Irrigation,

where a particular project has been exempted because of
its peculiar circumstances, the Congress has always made
such an exemption by express enactment, and that would
have been the thing to lo because they are not going to
build a project where one is not required, and one would,
not have been required —
QUESTION:

Bu: the government construction of

the statute for thirty years was contrary to your present
submission.
MR» MeCREE:

It was, there is no question about

it, but we say it was wrong, it was contrary to the
direction of the Congress*
QUESTION:

General MeCree, you cite in your

brief Justice Jacksonfs opinion for the Court in Skidmore

owlft & Company about administrative construction, at page
140 of 323 U.S. in that caseo

The Court's opinion con­

tains the statement, "Good administration of the act and
good Judicial administration alike require that the stand­
ards of public enforcement and those for determining
private rights shall be at variance only where Justified
by very good reasons."

Don't you have to take the posi­

tion that Secretary Wilbur’s letter was almost irrational
in order to maintain the position you are now maintaining?
MR. McCRES:

I don’t think we have to character­

ize it that far, but we do say that it 5s contrary to the
congressional direction,

Mr. Justice Frankfurter said

once in Hensley v. Union Planters Bank that wisdom some­
times never comes, so wa should not reject it just because

Circuit recognized that in the opinion below which we
respectfully urge this Court to affirm.

Mr. Brunwasser,

ORAL ARGUMENT OP ARTHUR BRUHWAS8ER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
pIR,

BRUNVIASSER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns the applicability of the
anti-monopoly provisions of reclamation law to the Imperial
Valley of California»

The outcome ■will determine If the

vast benefits of the reclamation program will enure forever
to owners of hundreds and thousands of acres of land or
if these benefits will be restricted to the persons who
live and farm and work on family sized farms as intended
by Congress in 1902 when the Reclamation Act was passed.
The subsidy involved in this case is far differ­
ent from any other subsidy which probably has ever come
before this Court and which has been considered by the
government.
Aside from the dollar value of each year’s
supply of water deliveries, the subsidy here is continuous.
It has been provided for the past forty years and will
continue to be provided so long as the Colorado River
flows.
QUESTION:

Is there something in the nature of

a subsidy lurking in the windfall that was referred to
earlier by the Solidter General and others for the pur­
chasers who

acquire the property at a modest price?

MR, BRUHWASSER:

fir, Chief Justice9 Congress in­

tended a subsidy and a windfall and Congress intended that
that subsidy and that windfall go fco small farmers be­
cause of a number of reasons which formed part of the
fabric of legislation intended to protect small family
farmers as developed in the amicus brie:’ that has been
filed in this Court„

There is nothing wrong with sub­

sidies per s® j, but Congress intended that subsidy be used
for a specific purpose to create a class of small family
farmers, not large farmers., small farmers.
QUESTION:

Would you disagree then with at least

the Solicitor General’s tentative response to my hypo­
thetical that one individuals a bachelor, no wife, no
children*, could dispose of all of his acreage in excess
of l60 and lease it back,

lie wouldn't he a very small

farmer any more, would he?
MR. BRUNWASSER:

Well, the answer fco that

question, Mr, Chief Justice, is this, there are proposed
regulations fco cover this very point wh:„ch are set out in
the appendix to the district’s brief, and the Secretary
of the Interior has proposed that there be a limit to the
amount of acreage which may be leased.
of 16C acres that may be leased.

There is a limit

In addition, the land­

owner, as I understand it, may own 160 icres.

The problem

that Your Honor has put his finger on i5 a problem that

has plagued the reclamation program from the very begin­
ning.

Your Honor may know that at this very moment ers

Capitol Hill there is & to5.ll, S. 1*1, which was approved
by the Senate, it is now before the House, and one of the
biggest battles over changing the reclamation program was
over the question of leasing, how much land should a land­
owner be allowed to lease without violating the excess
land laws.
The answer is that the Secretary has discretion
under section 10 of the Reclamation Act to adopt rules and
regulations to carry out the policies of the law.

Clearly,

the policy of the'law as enunciated by Congress and as
approved by this Court In Ivanhoe is that there be small
family farms of X6o acres.

Mow, if the situation arises

where there is an effort to lease more than l60 acres or
1,000 acres or more, then that is a matter under present

law for the Secretary of the Interior to adjudicate, .at

the scope of his authority, that matter would" assumhjbly
come before the courts.
QUESTION:

What is the thrust of the pending

legislation that you referred to?
MR. BRUNWASSER:

Humber one, insofar as this

case la concerned, it is to delete any applicability of
the acreage limitation and the residency requirement of

48
reclamation law to the Imperial Valley of California.
Number two* it is to enlarge the acreage limitation from
anywhere — I think the lowest figure is about 640 acres
to 1,280 acres.

Third, it .is to delete the residency re­

quirement completely,,
In effect, the landowners of the Imperial Valley
have asked Congress to do what their counsel has been
asking the federal courts to do since this case began in
1967t and I might point out that a lot of the documenta­
tion and statistics which has been presented to this Court

/

in the reply brief are self-serving statistics presented
by representatives of the Imperial Valley to the Senate
committee last year and the year before,
QUESTION:

And that has passed the Senate, did

you say?

19'79, it passed the Senate.

hearings were held before the appropriate subcommittee of
the House Interior Committee on that very legislation.

If that passes, is that going to be

the end of this problem?

Suppose it passed tomorrow, would

MR® BRUNWASSER:

I think so,

I think so.

The

bill was introduced shortly after the Ninth Circuit made
its decision.

There has been an effort made to change the

law because of this and a number of other cases and the

MR. BRUNWASSER:

It is ray understanding that the

The continuing nature of the subsidy must be
borne in mind when we consider the arguments on adminis­
trative practice and the non—legal issue which has been
urged by the landowners, the non-Xegal 5ssue of fairness.
Well, I don’t believe it is a proper legal issue, and I
would like to address myself to it becat.se, as my worthy
opponent points out, it seems to be the core of this very
case.
Fairness at most is a variation of the quitable
estoppel argument.

The landowners contend that they rely

to their detriment upon the ruling by Secretary Wilbur.
QUESTION:

Well, I hadn’t understood that to be

their precise contention, counsel»

I had understood that

they had thought that Secretary Wilbur’s construction of
the act was a permissible construction if not the only one,
and that under Swift & Company and cases like that, after
they had gone on for a period of time it represented a
very significant canon of statutory construction, rather
than simply a straight estoppel argument♦

QUESTION:

Okay,

MR, BRUNWASSER;

Be that as it in&y „
But the short answer is, number

one, if there is anything unfair or inequitable about
enforcing congressional policy and seeing that the federal
water subsidy is delivered to the people to whoa It was
intended is, as this Court indicated in Gerlach and
Ivanhoe, the landowner should go to the Court of Claims,
QUESTION:

Well, you first have to determine

what congressional policy syas here, whether the acreage
limitation was intended to apply to the Imperial Valley.
MR, BRUNWASSER:

Okay,

I will move over to the

52
Imperial Valley situation which la the Boulder Canyon Act,
and the argument is made that because of present perfected
■

rights, Congress Intended a shorthand reference to a
specific exemption from the acreage limitation.

is clear and concise,

That

In another statute, it says except

as provided in section ,5 of this act, the excess land
provisions of the federal reclamation laws shall not apply.
In yet another statute, it says the excess land
provisions of the federal reclamation laws shall not be
applicable*

There Is no such language in the Boulder

Canyon Project Act „

As a matter of fact. In preparing

for the argument today, 1 was rereading Arizona v.
California and we come to the only specific reference
that I have found as to the reason for the Inclusion of

53
section X*!.

Section 14, as Your Honors know* is the sec­

tion which incorporates reclamation law by reference,
standard language which is found in every reclamation
statute.
Mr. Justice Harlan in his. dissent — this is
at 3?3 U„S.s page 623, he points out that both Rep.
Swing and Senator Johnson emphasised that this provision,
section 14S was deliberately incorporated into the
Project Act„

Now, nobody in this case Las yet come up

with a reason for the inclusion ©f aeeti on 14.

The peti­

tioners have not pointed out any meaning to section 1*1.
It is mere surplusage.

They claim that everything is

otherwise provided because there.is a specific manner of
contracting in section 1(b).
Well, obviously we are dealing; with a multistate project here, the largest project of its day, but
there is nothing in section 4(h) that says this shall be
an exemption from the excess land, laws cf the reclamation
law.

So section 14 has no meaning at a31 according to

the, petitioners.
QUESTION:

Mr, Brunwasser, but you have an

express administrative construction that went on for thirtyyears .
MR. BRUNWASSER:
which was wrong and --

An administrative construction

54
QUESTION:

You say It was wrong, but it has to

be absolutely totally wrong, as I understand the laws and
if one reads Solicitor Barry’s opinion as opposed to
Secretary Wilbur’s opinion, it seems to me that in the
reference to the various land division opinions one con­
strued vested rights more narrowly than the other.
1

It is

not a case of black and white at all.
MR. BRXMWA3SER:
Your Honor.

I respectfully disagree with

I am not the only person who has asserted

that, the Wilbur letter #as dead wrong, absolutely wrong
as a matter of black letter law.

The Ninth Circuit was

charitable when it referred to the Wilbur letter as a
rather simplistic analysis.

There has never been on®

legal analysis or evaluation of the Wilbur letter from
the time it was prepared for the Secretary’s signature
which has upheld its legal reason, not a one.
QUESTION:

On every —

Suppose the All-American Canal had

been built before the Boulder Dam Project was even thought
of and they had a big headgate on the Colorado and the
Project Act comes along and they are going to preempt the

protect us in this, you must agree to deliver and they
say we will, so they write in the Project Act that we will

57
QUESTIOH:

Although the provisions of the contract,

provisions of the statute, provisions of the Reclamation
Act would be precisely the same.
MR. BRUNWASSER:

Well, there Is a ease that comes

close to the hypothetical., it deals with the San Louis
Project in the Central Valley of California, where there
Is.'a dam. and & reservoir which was constructed jointly by
the United States and the State off California and there
is a Solicitor’s opinion by Solicitor» Barry that the acre­
age limitation would not apply to the service area served
by |bhe state financed canal, even though: the water in the

' Vf

Jointly constructed reservoir comes from both places.

that comes close to you? situation.
QUEST!OH:

So you wouldn’t he here making the

argument iff the All-American Canal had been privately
financed, even though the contract would be exactly the
same contract as present here and the acts would say ex­
actly the same thing.
MR. BRUNWASSER:
be that

Well, of course, there wouldn’t

kind off contract because the contract is not only

to deliver water, the contract is to construct the canal.
That is the contract provided in. the Project Act»

It

isn’t simply the Secretary saying I will deliver X acrefeet off water to this water district.
QUESTION:

What about the land office decision

58
In the Wright case that Secretary Wilbur railed upon which
Solicitor Barry simply said is Inapplicable here?

Do you

think that is totally inapplicable?
MR. BRUNWASSEH:
respond in detail*

1 am not going to b® able to

I can just tell you that that was gone

into at trial with Mr. WeinbergJs testimony, the government
expert witness —•
QUESTION:

We LI, we are here deciding whether

or not Secretary Wilbur's construction was a plausible or
reasonable one*

He relied on a couples of land office de­

cisions which talked about vested rights and Solicitor
Barry said no, he probably shouldn't have relied on ’them*
MR. BRUNWASSEH?
QUESTION:

As I recall those cases

That is part of the question wa' are

answering here.
MR. BRUNWASSEH:

I understand those cases, the

two lands cases discussed In the Wilbur letter.

They re­

ferred to situations where the water had been delivered
and there was no new delivery system that provided t?he
water to Ana Wright and the other people who asked for
an exemption..

In the Imperial Valley, there was a new

delivery system, so It has to be borne In mind that the
water under the preexisting situation went Into Mexico
and then back into the United States, and there was no
canal constructed by the government.

59
QUESTION:

Well:, I can understand that as a per-»

fecfcly plausible reason If you are arguing a case to say
no, th® Wright opinion doesn’t apply» but it doesn’t sees
to me that that means that the Wright opinion simply had
no applicability whatever and that Secretary Wilbur was
just almost out of Ms mind in citing it.
MR. BRDNWASSER:

Well, according to Mr. Weinberg»

Secretary Wilbur — not t© -use that phraseology f but he
was wrong because the practice had always been that when
you bring in a federal project vested rights under state
law do not exempt the landowners from the acreage limita­
tion.

That was the rule and that was a rule agreed to —

which was set out in one of Mr. Dent’s memoranda in 192?
and a Solicitor’s opinion In 1927» and it turns out that
once In a while on a project you will have one or two
.people who are right there right next to the existing
stream and the stream isn’t changed., but the government
will take water out of the stream and the stream la- ‘then
appropriated and they allow these people to use the water,
But that is a far different situation than the Imperial
Valley, where everybody was using the water and they went
to Congress, th© water program was not satisfactory, they
couldn’t continue to use it, they had periodic droughts
and floods in addition to the revolutionary conditions in
Mexico, and they had to have this project»

Any claim that

60
they relied upon this project and they would haw approved

it is really absurd,

One only has to go to the da® site

or to Boulder City and look at the movie that gives a
history of the background of this project to see the
devastation that existed in the Imperial Valley before
this project was built.
I would like to return to present perfected
rights for one moment.
QUESTION;

Bo you think9 on the question of .

presently perfected rights, do you think the government
could have charged the irrigation districts the Imperial
Valley Irrigation District anything for the water?
MR. BEUMWASSE1:

Not under section 1.

Section

1 specifically says they are not going to charge for the
water and they haven’t charged for the water.

They

charged for the construction of the canal.
QUESTION;

Because it was

a presently perfected

right,
MR. BRUNWASSEH;

No, I don’t agree that that is

the reason because under Gerlach the government 'appropri­
ated preexisting water, vested water rights under state
law and there was a valid claim presented in the Court of

Claims.
QUESTION;

Of course, this is a statutory —

the Project Act provided for —

61
MR. BRUNWASSER:
QUESTION:

For the exemption.

— for observing presently perfected

rights.
MR. BRUNWASSER:

Yes , but as this Court said in

Arizona —
QUESTION:

Mould it hat?® been inconsistent with

that to charge for the fafcer?
MR. BRUMWASSEA:
QUESTION:

I don’t think so.

Mould it have been inconsistent with

that section to charge for the water?
MR. BRUNWASSER:

I don't believe so because it

is one thing to deliver water,, it is another thing to
charge for it and this Court said very clearly in Arizona
v, California that nothing in the compact purports to con­
trol any distribution of water within a state.

And as I

read this Court’s opinion9 It simply concluded that the
present perfected right;? of the users in the lower basin
are to be satisfied out of the storage facilities in Lake
Mead.

In other words9 in days where there may be a water

shortage9 the people in the upper basin can’t withdraw
sufficient water to prevent the present perfected rights
from accumulating in Lake Mead, behind the dam.

But

there is nothing In the statute or In the compact which
says word one about the acreage limitation.
I would like

;o move to one issue raised by Mr.

62
Chief Justice Burgera the question of standing.
case, there is a unique statute, section 46 0

In this

It is a

unique statute which doesn* t apply anywhere else In the
law.

There Is an entire body of ease law In the Minth

Circuit dealing with attempts to litigate, individual
attempts to litigate Reclamation Act cases.
QUESTION:

This Is section 46 of the act?

MR. BRUNWASSER:

Yes., Your Honor.

There has

been some allusion to these cases in the briefs„ of
Turner v0 ling's River Conservation District, Bowker v.
Morton, and the two eases at bar.

Significantly, Chief

Judge Browning was on three of those panels.

He was on

all panels with the exception of Bowker v. Morton.
Under section 14 there will b® an automatic
drop in the price of lard because one shouldn't be allowed
to benefit from the federal water subsidyt

There may be

a dispute as to what level that price'is going to drop,
would It fee In this case to 1942 when the district ceased
using water from the Alamo Canal, or today when there Is
no longer water available from the Alamo Canal.

But the

fact remains that there definitely would be a drop in
price and it would be tc below market levels.

The

Secretary has proposed s series of regulation» which are
set out verbatim in the district's appendix to their

major brief, which show how the Secretary intends to

63
carry out and to enforce the acreage limitations and he
quite clearly states that we5re going to carry out the
congressional purpose of creating small family farms,
wide distribution of the benefits and the rest of it.
The respondents in this case have an opportunity
to purchase some of the richest farm land in the world at
below market prices*

The Secretary has set up a list of

priorities about how to qualify to be what he refers to
•as a non excess landowner.

You have to live there, you

have to promise to farm, you have to attempt to farm*
My clients qualify.

Instead of there being 150

to 200 large landowners controlling essentially all of
the excess land in the Imperial Valley, with an average
holding of 715 ares of irrigated farms in California, and
my clients for the past forty years have been essentially
1,6.00 fruit pickers,

because instead of getting the water

to engage in farming, they are out picking the crops.
Now, that isn’t what Congress intended.

We

will get -QUESTION:

was offered?

64
MR. BRUMWASSER:

So — well* the landowner* does

not have the right to s it a price,.
QUESTION:

We don’t 'know yet vhat the price will

be.
MK, BRUNWASSER:

But we know it is going to b®

below market prices and we could use our common sense to
anticipate that that is going to fee pretty cheap for this
kind of farm land.

Then there are federal programs avail­

able that we have made allusion to in our brief for borrow­
ing funds if necessary* certainly —
QUESTION:

What would motivate a seller to sell

at less than market price?
MR. BRUMWASSER:

Because the testimony in this

record in answer to questions from their own counsel* the
landowner said that there is no use for theft land except
farmings there is under two inches of rain a year* unless
they wanted to raise rattlesnakes and rabbits.
QUESTION:

Well, maybe they went to wait and

see what the House of Representatives dees with S. 14.
MR. BRUNWASSER:

Well* that may be but, you

know, life is full of imponderables like that.

This

Court —
QUESTION:

Would you sell at about a fourth of

market price if you owned the land?
MR. BRUNWASSER:

If I owned 14,000 acres, like

65
Mr. Elmore, the typical Imperial Valley farmer that has
been referred to by the petitioners and I had thousands
of dollars worth of improvements In my land, as they claim
they have, and I know that the law is determined by the
Ninth Circuit and Tulare provides that the value of the
improvements will be taken into consideration in setting
the fair and reasonable X contract price, I would b® very
reluctant to sit back and let my 14,000 acres return to
desert„
QUESTION:

What roughly in your judgment Is the

spread between the fair market value of the land with
water and the price at which it will be sold per acre?
What is the range?
MR. BRUiW ASSER:

I don’t know because we

entered the ease as interveners and we didn’t enter —
QUESTION:

But your standing depends on some

opinion at least as to the likelihood of making purchase,
MR. BRUNWASSER:

But the record to date shows

that the value of land without the water is $25 to $50 an
acre.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. BRUNWASSER:

And the value with the water

is $1,200 to $1,400 an acre.
QUESTION:

What light does that shed on the

question, my first question as to likelihood of an owner

66
selling at the very reduced price when there is a statute
or- a bill pending in Congress which would restore the full
value of the land?
MR* BRUNWASSER:
QUESTION:

Well, number one —

It has already pasred one body of

Congress.
MR. BRUNWASSER:

Humber one, if the bill passes

Congress, that is the end of the case, hut I don't knoi*
that the Court may decile the case based upon the possi­
bility that Congress may change the law.

So I think we

have to assume that the law will continue as it is In de­
termining the question on its merits, the ease on, its
merits as well as the procedural questions.
It would seem to me that the spread is between
$50 and $1,200s with respect to the improvements, I don’t
know, and the landowners and. the district did not offer
any conflicting affidavits in the trial court to show
what the value of the improvements would have been.

So

the only record before 5his Court is that the —
QUESTION:

What are these improvements?

What

are.we talking about?
MRo BRUNWASSER:

They build dutches, they line

the ditches to keep the water from seeping down too far.
I think the irrigation district simply brings the water
to a certain place and the landowner has to take the water

67
somewhere else.

There is machinery, of course.

QUESTION:

Some of which, I suppose, would be

retained on the 160-s.cre plots that they could retain.
MR. BRUMWASSER:

Well, if you want t© engage in

farming, you would, although there are ways where —

QUESTION:

Or maybe just one might be enough

for you.
MR. BRUNWASSER:

Even one would be enough and

I don’t think It is necessary that we make the tender of
$25 to $50 to Mr. Elmor-e, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, to
ask him to refuse our offer for some of this rich farm­
land.

I don’t think we should have to do a useless act.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. McCREE, JR„, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPOMDEHTS-—REBUTTAL
MR. McCREE;
th® Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I have only one brief remark in rebuttal.
The Solicitor General has referred to the passage

of S. 14 in the Senate ami has stated that if there is any
unfairness here it should be the Congress to deal with it,
and the Respondents have made the same argument.
I would like to advise this Court that when the
landowners of Imperial /alley first went; to Congress, they
could not have known in advance that this Court would
eventually grant certiorari.

And when a bill was pending

in Congress two years ago, they did take efforts to -seek
a provision dealing explicitly with then, but that does
not render the case moot before this Court,
The present administration har, taken the posi­
tion consistently In Congress and all the proceedings on
S. 14 that Congress should not act.

Secretary Andrus

has three times told Congress it should not act because
it should be decided by this Court, and I quote from
Secretary Andrus' testimony in 1978 to
on Energy end Natural Resources:

.he Senate Committee

551 would prefer to have

this resolved in the Supreme Court of the United States
because it is the highest court of the Land."
