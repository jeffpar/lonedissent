MR. CHIEF JUaTICE .BURGER;

W* will hear arguments

first this morning in World-Wide Volkswagen Corporation a, pins t
Woodson.
Mr. Rubin, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERBERT RUBIN. ESQ .
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, RUBIN:

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it please ti a

Court:
This case presents a further variation on the issue-;
which were examined by this Court in Internetionai Shoe, HoCea.
Hanson v. jPenckla, Shaffer and Kulko cases, the KuIIlq, case most
recently, just last year.
The order which is appealed from is a final order on
a writ of prohibition, and this Court has jurisdiction.
The issues necessarily raised by this appeal are
issues vihich go to questions of minimum contacts and purposeful
activity, and therefore, I think, we should refer briefly to
the .facts and the record in this case.

I think Your Honors wii;

find that the facts and the record are discreet and limited„
be have in this case, first, merely the pleadings,
be have a motion in which it was moved that the proceeding be
dismissed on jurisdictional grounds»

There was an opportunity

for e hearing under the if% home statute#

At- the hearing, under

.Oklahoma law, the Plaintiff had the burden of proving the

jurisdictional facts.

No facts were adduced at the hearing.

All that we have in the record then, Your Honors, is the .hi.*' din
and there are affidavits which were interposed on behalf of the
Petitioners here,which will be found in the Appendix at p£ • as
16 and 18.

And that's all there is.
Now, the facts indicate, Your Honors, that the

Plaintiffs are New York residents j. that is a He ;ed in the
complaint and it was determined again in the Federal Court
when there was an application to remove and the Plaintiffs
protested the removal and claimed that there was no diversity
because they were New York residents.
The complaint recites that Defendant Seaway is s Na
York corporation which does business in Mas sina / New York.
Your Honors will be familiar with the fact that Messina is a
community in the northern reaches of New Yori State.
QUESTION;
Mil. RUBIN:

It is by the St. Lawrence, isn't it?
That is right, You :• Honor,

It also recites that Horld-Wide is a New York corpora­
tion,

world-Wide has its offices in Orangeburg, New York. 'The

Seav;? y Company is a local dealer , which engages, in sale of auto­
mobiles in Messena.

World-hide is a wholesaler which has respon­

sibility for the sale of automobiles to dealers in three States,
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut,
QUESTION:

Do you think any distinction can be drawn

between those two parties, so far as the issue of this case is

concerned; that is, is the distributor thinking, "Well, the
things I sell are more likely to be used in Oklahoma, as con­
trasted with Seaway who is pretty local. " or would you — I
take it you classify them together?
MR. RUBIN:

I would classify them together, Your Honor.

I take into account the language of the Court which talks in
terms of the differences have to be differences in quality and
not merely a matter of more or less.

In terms of quality, 1

don’t think there is any difference.
Especially, Your Honor, I would like to call your
attention again to the record and the affidavit which appears
in the Appendix at page 16, in which World-Wide expressly states
that its business is limited to those three States, that it hae
no intention of doing any business outside of those three Statos*
and specifically has no intention of doing business in Oklahoma*
QUESTION:

But if this accident had happened on the

Pennsylvania -New York border,'it would be a somewhat different
case than this one, would it not?
MR. RUBIN:

I think' that there might be other con­

siderations, Your Honor.

It would go to the question of minimum

contact which exists, and I think you would have to look at the
fa c t s und e c t h os e c i rc urns' ta nc es«
QUESTION:

At least here, your accident was in

Oklahoma.

MR. RUBIN:

Here, the accident was in Oklahoma --

6

QUESTION:

So, witnesses to the accident are lively

be there, In contrast to Justice Rehnquist's hypothetical, had
the accident happened . on. the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
MR, RUBIN:

That's right.

The accident was in

Oklahoma and it is clear, from the record .-*» totally undisputed
that.neither of the parties,which are.the Petitioners heye,
had any connection with Oklahoma, no business, no property,
never went into Oklahoma«. And, indeed, in the Seaway affidavit'which is part of the Appendix — page 18, I believe it is — it
v is recited that they never .foresaw that the ‘car. would go to
Oklahoma.
QUESTION5

Does the record show v.hp the other

Defendants submitted to Oklahoma jurisdiction?
MR, RUBIN:

If Your Honor please, the other Defendants

.that is Audi N.S.U, and .Volkswagen of America, have submitted
to jurisdiction in Oklahoma*
QUESTION:

MR, RUBIN:
QUESTION:

Dees the record show why?
No, Your Honor,
Does the record disclose shy contractu,l

limitations on the Petitioners as to the areas in which they
may carry on their activities?
■

MR. RUBIN:

'

There is nothing in the record on "that.,

siReject, Your honor, except for the express statement by Seaway
:

'

\

that Its business is a local business and did not. contemplate
doing business outside the mtatcu. and the ..express a- c. oement . jy

7

World-Wide to the same effect, that it did not contemplate doing
business outside the three States in which it was a wholessler..
QUESTION:

Mr, Rubin, did you represent the other

Defendants?
MR. RUBIN:

I. personally, did not.

My firm has' con­

nections with the other Defendants.
QUESTION:

But then your firm chose not to resist

jurisdiction in Oklahoma for them?
MR, RUBIN:
QUESTION:

That's right. Your.Honor.
Mr. Rubin, on that subject, you said the

record doesn't show why the other companies did not resist.
But the record does contain the complaint which alleges that
they advertise nationally, and specifically in Oklahoma,
that allegation is undenied.

And

So, isn't it fair to. assume that

that's the reason that jurisdiction could be asserted over them?
MR, RUBIN:
that

Mr. Justice Stevens, I don't know that
.

J

as the reason, and fronkly
:

ell, if that allegation is in tl 6 v.

and it is undenied?
MR. RUBIN:

There is such an allegation, end there

is no -•* for the purpose —
QUESTION:

Whereas, there, is denial as to the clients

before the Court.
UR, RUBII::

As to these Petitioners, there is cer­

tain!' a disavowal, a denial that there is any advertising.—

3

locali advertising — in Oklahoma, or e. en pt rticipation in ri\
national advertising or national television.

They expressly

disclaim that.
So that all that we have in this case is a recital
that the Plaintiff was driving in Oklahoma in. a car which v: a
purchased from Seaway, and was involved then in an accident in
Oklahoma.
QUESTION:

If he wasn't a resident of Oklahoma, it

might as well have been Arizona, hadn't it?
MR, RUBIN:
talk about Arizona,,

hell, Your Honor, the record doesn't even
That has been interposed in the briefs.

but the record merely talks of the Plaintiff,.' so far as I under­
stand it,, .as a New York resident.
QUESTION:

Driving through Ok laborV:

MR. RUBIN: Driving; through Oklahoma, that's right,
Your Honor.

-

Now, the Oklahoma statute provides foe actions age Inst
nonresidents.

Interest in. Ah. enough, it refers tc two cote;

of coses .where it will take jurisdiction, one kith respect to
tortious injuries in Oklahoma, one where it is caused by acts
or omissions in Oklahoma, and the second where it. it caused v;
pets, or omissions outside Oklahoma, if the Defendant regularly
does or solicits business or engages in any other persistent
course of conduct. You have a tracking, pretty much, of language which

9

we hrve in the International Shoe ease.

It goes on to say, :: v

derives substantial revenue from- goods used or con.suaed or
services rendered in the State.
Now, the Oklahoma Supreme Court in its decisions iirst
determined that the first section did not apply.
act by the Defendants within the State.

There ms no

It also determined fe'

there was no. act or omission outside the State which related ir­
regular solicitation of business or persistent course of cond et*
Then by some kind of a magnum leap in logic it says, "On the
other hand, re can say that because this car was'in C:,lair
that these Defendants derive' substantial revenue f rom goods
used 'or consumed or ser . ices rendered in. the State',1- because tlm car must hove cost a lot of money* It is an item of great cost
and therefore it must be deemed that these Defendants derive

Then, in Kulko, the Court v;ent even further, it seems Kulko is kind of an a • fortiori case'.'

it becomes a major argument of ,theli%. .that the

name of this company is World-Wide, and so it must - have antici­

1 respectfully submit that that can't be a basis on
which this Court can find minimal contacts or purposeful activity
QUESTION:

Mr, .Rubin, do you quarrel with the statement

of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, on pag-e 6A of the Petition f'• •
the Writ of Certiorari, where it says in the first full par?
on that page, "The evidence presented below demonstrated that
goods sold and distributed by the Petloners were used in the
State of Oklahoma, and under the facts we believe it reason-.hie
to infer, given retail value of the autonobile, that the Petieners
derived substantial Income from automobiles which from time t
time are used in the State of Oklahoma”?
MR.RUBIN:

X certainly quarrel with that, Your Honor.

It seems to me that that is totally illogical.

All the Court

says is that because this car was in Oklahoma involved in the
accident, that that shows that there was a,use,of automobiles
in Oklahoma which have «- It says, "Given the retail value
the automobile, that Petitioners, therefore, .derived si; 1st vfc.i: j.
income from automobiles which from time to time are used in the
State of Oklahoma.R
It seems to me there is no logic to that, whatsoever,
Your Honor.
QUESTION':

in Kansas would, on ocu; 'sion,be driven into Oklahoma?

MR. RUBIN:

I think it would be quite a different

I think foreseeability is one element in the question

13

'

what ''there .is purposeful activity,

Tire issue which has to.

be addressed, X think, is whether there is purposeful acti it;
on the part of these Defendants.

I believe the record shows

there is no purposeful activity,
QUESTION:

What kind of purposeful activity would

satisfy the minimum contacts test?
MR, RUBIN:

I think there would have to be a sbo ir .

that there was a direction of the energy of this Defendant to
getting the benefits of the laws of the State •»- of-the forum.

QUESTION':

What benefit would he get?

Once the car

Is sold and is owned by somebody else, what benefit does the
seller get from the laws of another State, if that car happens
to be driven by its then owner into another State?.MR. RUBIN:

hell, Your Honor, I think that the concept

is one of ~~ if this seller intends to localise its activities,
Intends- to isolate itself .from being involved in lawsuits in
other jurisdictions, and simply restricts its activity, then it
says.

"I want to have the benefit of the laws of my. State, to

the exclusion of the laws of Some other State*"
QUESTION:

What about Mr, Justice Rehnquist's example,

then, why would it be a different case?

Why would the seller

there- perhaps be subject to suit in Oklahoma?
MR, RUBIN;

Well, if the seller,for example, considered

that to be part of his market, considered that people who were,
c.drain;, from that State -..ere buying, its cars, and it was appealing

to those people, its advertising, certainly, would be the hind
of activity which might subject it to jurisdiction in that other
State and then Its obtaining the benefit of the laws of that
other State, getting economic — its deriving economic benefits
from ~~
QUESTION:

What if it doesn't advertise or anythin;;,

but some Oklahoma people just happen to come up there and buy
seme cars?
MR, RUBIN;

I think, Your Honor, that that would ■ rip .

us' to a situation where the involvement of ti e forum is tie
result of purely unilateral action on the part of people outside,
QUESTION:

End then he wouldn't be subject to suit,

is that it?

Ml. RUBIN;

I think if it is purely unilateral he
\
would have a situation which is very analogous to Kulko,

QUESTION;
hi. RUBIN;

End this case, you think?
In this case, depending again on the

quality of the contacts and the purposefulness of the activity.
QUESTION;

Well, you don't think then it is jus

enough to anticipate that the curs you sell will be driven in
another State?
MR. RUBIN:

I think, Your Honor, that any product cun

be anticipated to be found in another State.

There are very few

products that are found, in our economic life, which one would

15

not contemplate will find their way somewhere into another State.
Whether you are talking about peanuts or cotton or lettuce or
babies' pajamas, they are going to find their way into another
State.

I don’t think the contemplation here is that the lines

of State jurisdiction simply should be wiped out.
I think that is one of the major issues which is
before the Court.

It is the idea, somehow, that is being sug­

gested by the Respondent that the State court lines, that the
Federal system is somehow an historical anachronism.
QUESTION:

Well, if the seller.in Kansas sells to

f

traveling salesman, sells .it to his next-door neigh' or wh<
knows is a traveling salesman who travels once a week to Oklahoma,
and he knows the car is .going to go to Oklahoma, your position
is that that certainly doesn't subject him to suit in Oklahoma
because all it is is an. anticipation that the car will be used
in Oklahoma.
MR. RUBIN:

.If It is merely an. anticipation, Your

Loivo.r, I don't think that that would be sufficient.
a.j.

I think

esee: kiiity that something will be in another State

is not enough-to confer jurisdiction,

1 think that all of that

has to be coupled with some.affiliating acts which indicate an
intention to get the benefits of being in this other State.
QUESTION:

Mr* Rubin, if I understand your argument

correctly, you really didn't have to answer Mr. Justice Rehnouist
the way you did.

Although you think the Supreme Court of

3.6

Oklahoma is illogical, if I understand your position, what ye­
ar© saying is that even if the Oklahoma Supreme Court is right,
that use in Oklahoma ms foreseeable, nevertheless, there was
still no Jurisdiction, because — It is really the same case,
in legal terns, as if the customer said, '*! am going to drive
the car to Oklahoma, " and the denier said, "I don't care where
you drive it,. as long as you pay for it, 11 and then he drove it
to Oklahoma,

You would still say there is no jurisdiction.

MR. RUBIN:

I would say, Your Honor, that is correct,

that foreseeability alone is not enough.
QUESTION:

So, i.e could assume foreseeability and

still accept your argument,

I know you are asking us not to,

but
MR, RUBIN:

Except in this cose. Your Honor, the

record Indicates to the contrary, that there is no foresee­
ability,
What is sought to be done here, Your Honor, I think,
is to blur the idea of the hedera 1 system of limitation .onjurisdiction of State courts,

We have the.very eloquent
(?)

.

’

language which was articulated by Judge Sobiief in the Hrlancer
case.

I don’t have to repeat it.

point here.

I think it is very much ir.

There are p ay . .ants to the effect that the *e are

advantages, somehow, that there are efficiencies that may occur
if somehow or other you blur the idea of jurisdiction in venue,
that somehow or other it may. be less complicated if you just

forget about these concepts of jurisdiction,

And it may be

cheaper or not so difficult' for people to get together, if
somehow or other you wipe out the concept of jurisdiction*
This Court has already said and Mr, Justice Marshal:'
in 'cine Shaffer case indicated that if the price of ignoring
jurisdiction is that, then it is just too high a price.
I think that is what we have here,

We are in an

area where we seek to ignore jurisdictional lines, where v:e
seek to ignore the intention on the part of someone who opted
to be a businessman in

ena or someone who opted to be a

businessman in Orangeburg, and that ~~
QUESTION:

Mr* Rubin, do you suppose it would be

different in the Kansas-Oklahoma example, the car that was in
the accident that came from Kansas was a rental car and the
Defendant was Hertz?
MR, RUBIN:

I think there probably would be a differ­

ence.
QUESTION:

You mean that Herts would be subject to

suit because it anticipates its car would be protected by
Oklahoma law?
MR, RUBIN:
QUESTION:

Thafc1s right, You r H on or.
Well, what about the automobile dealer'who

sells cars in Kansas to his next-door neighbor who is a traveling
salesman, and he takes a mortgage? He has a chattel mortgage on
/
the car. And his neighbor is paying it off, over time, so he

18

has an interest in the car.
MR, RUBIN:

He may have an interest in the car. but

I would think that you have a question whether you don't hove
an attenuated situation merely to indicate that there is a mini­
mum contact, by reason of the fact that he has a mortgage.
QUESTION:

What about the lessor of a car?

What if

you lease the car to the user?
MR. RUBIN:

The lessor of the car has liability.

He

is the owner, he knows he can be sued wherever that car goes.
QUESTION:
the lessor case.

You just answered the whole case then on

You think the lessor would be subject to

suit in Oklahoma?
MR. RUBIN:

I think a lessor would, where he anticipates

that the car is going to be going out of the State, if It is
rented ~~ VJe are talking now about Hertz

I would say that

the lessor would be liable, would be subject to jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Because that is activity of the Defendant

lesso r.

MR. RUBIN:
looking for.

That is his business, that is what he is

He is looking to lease his car and have it travel

throughout the entire country.

That’s not the business of a

person who sells this car.
I would like to reserve the remaining time for
rebuttal,
QUESTION:

Of

course, some of these rental leases'

19

have a geographical limitation.

Do you think the presence of

such a contractual provision would change the result?
MR, RUBIN;

I think it would, Your Honor.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Greer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFERSON G. GREER, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GREER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:

This appears to be the first case to reach this Court
involving the interpretation of a long-am statute for a product
when a physical injury was involved.
Changes in the modern society have required the
expansion of State court jurisdiction, and with the advent of
automobiles, which are certainly unique in American life, it
has required the expansion of Stats'court jurisdiction.
has

This

,iven rise, first of all, to the' Nonresident Motorist

Statute, which perhaps started the evolution of the expansion
of State court jurisdiction.
As far back as 1927* the Court recognized the
uniqueness of the automobile in American life, when they carved
out the automobile exception to the search and seizure require­
ments of the Fourth Amendment,

And it has long been recognized

in criminal law that you can commit an assault with a dangerous
or a deadly weapon by. yse of the automobile.

Eo it is unique.

Today, we have a National Highway Transportation

20

.safety Administration within the Department of Transportation,,
who does nothing but promulgate standards and enforce them,
because of the dangerous nature of the automobile.
As the progress has progressed.In technological avers
shd in interstate commerce, travel by airplane and automobile
have wade it easier to move ..from one State to another $ this has
enabled the litigants to defend in foreign jurisdictions with
far less trouble than they would have before.
QUESTION:

That's a two-way street, isn't it?

MR. GREER:

Yes. sir, in some instances it is.

QUESTION:

In every instance, is it not? Modern

travel, if it makes it easier for the defendant to come to
Oklahoma, makes it easier for the Oklahoma resident to go to
some other jurisdiction.
MR. ORDER;

Except that, as this Court has pointed

out in the recent denial of certiorari, it is very difficult to
defend a personal injury action several hundred miles away from
the scene of the accident, where all of the witnesses and the
scene of the accident, record, doctors, arid so forth, are locc ted
QUESTION:

Mr. Greer, what if it had been a toaster

that was sold in Massena in Upstate New York, rather than a VI ?
MR. ORDER:

Yes, sir, I think that we must consider

the nature of the product, and I think the important thing here
is that this is a mobile product.

That's been recognized in

the Mon resident Motfif'^*®'* Statute.

Tlia q is ch© very reason 1 ui

them, is because -~
QUESTION;

Chattel is mobile, is it not?

End

long before the automobile, traveling salesmen back in the days
since the 19th Century have been riding trains, and whether it
be the shoes they wear or the toothbrush in their suitcase, or
whatever, every chattel is mobile.
MR. GREER;

Yes, sir, but in the case of an automobile

we can anticipate its use.

As a matter of fact, it is for tie

purpose —
QUESTION:

You con anticipate that a toothbrush is <

very mobile product, and is going to be carried by its owner’
from State to State.
MR, GREER;

That , is true, and I think that is a factor

that should be considered.

If a corner grocer, for example, is

selling a toothbrush, he cannot anticipate, he should not fore­
see that he would be called upon, perhaps, to defend that —
QUESTION;

this c; se?
mobile.

Why any less so than the Defendants in

People have always traveled, long before the auti ■-

Maybe there is more of it now, quantitatively, but

since the 19th Century, certainly, there has been a great deal
of interstate travel, ever since we have had railroad trains and
traveling salesmen, among-others, and businessmen of other kinds
MR. GREER:

Yes, sir.

The automobile, of course, is considered a dangerous
instrumentality,

As far back as Hess v« Pulosky, the first

22

nonresident motorist case# this Court recognized that it v;as
dangerous# even when used carefully.
QUESTION:

What if it were a chain saw# which is#

certainly, no less dangerous than an automobile?
MR, GREER:

Well# our argument is that when a seller

places a dangerous product# or a product that can produce'danger#
in interstate commerce# with reasonable foreseeability that it
will be used in foreign jurisdictions# then he should be callerup on to defend.
QUESTION:

MR, GREER:

Under Products Liability Lav/, certainly,

of Oklahoma, and I think most States now, all those in the
chain of distribution are liable as the manufacturer for a
defect.
In this case, for example, these two defendants could
plead over against the manufacturer and the importer.

The fact

that they haven't done so is, .perhaps, explained by the fact
that they are all part of a large marketing apparatus, extending
all over-the United States.

The trend, certainly, has been toward an expansion of
State court jurisdiction.

As the Court has pointed out, you

first adopted consent as a test,, then doing business, presence
of the corporation, and finally minimal contacts.

The emphasis

(?)

has gone from power of the State in Fenoyer, to contacts among

The State's interest in the litigation has certainly
been an important factor, which has been considered by this
Court.

QUESTION:

These are residents of New York, not

MR. GREER:

Yes, sir, but Oklahoma has an interest in

this litigation, as I point out,
QUESTION:■ In protecting people going through Oklahoma?
MR, GREER:

Yes, Sir.

These people, while residents of New York, were ©n

until they reached their new home.

That is the reason they were

still residents of New York.
But in Shaffer, again talking about State's interest,
you recognized the strong interest in the marketability of
property and providing a procedure for peaceful resolution of
disputes, and also Justice Brennan recognized in the Shaffer
case the unusually powerful interest of the State over corpora­
tions domesticated there, and the importance of insuring the
availability of a convenient forum for litigating claims in­
volving duplicity of corporate officers.
This Court has used different language in describing
the relationship of the Defendant to the State,
minimal contacts in IntematXona 1 Shoe.

You have used

You have also spoken of

contacts, ties and relations, and you spoke of affiliating

circumstances and substantial connections in the McGee case.
This is a somewhat uncertain definition, as Justice
Marshall has pointed out in the Kulko case.

QUESTION:

What about medicine and" drugs? You have

MR* GREER:

Yes, I have to do that,

I think,

29

cert' inly, a drug, is liable to produce death.

Certainly it

would apply in that case, if he can foresee the distribution of
the drug.
Here we have a purchaser, of course, that took the
automobile into the jurisdiction himself.

But we think that is

different from the ordinary goods in that it is more apt — it
is for the very purpose of transporting people from one coast
to the other.

We have transcontinental highways running cost

to coast.

And Route 66, where this accident occurred, is the

most heavily traveled road, I believe, in the world, and v;e ear
anticipate more movement of sufcmobiles —
QUESTION:

What about an automobile repair shoo or

gas station on Route 66, where you have nothing but tourists
going by?

I take it that gas station operator is probably

subject to jurisdiction every place that the people who buy
gas from him, and so forth, may travel.

If he just fixes a

flat tire, say, on a car that is on its way across the country.
He therefore subjects himself to jurisdiction at the destination
of the customer.
MR. GREER:

Yes, sir.

Let us say a gas station

operator in Oklahoma fixes a tire and he messes up the Job.
QUESTION:
MR, GREER:

And it blows in Alaska.
Okay,

going to fix your flat tire, because I don't want to do business
in Alaska."
MR, GREER:
QUESTION:

He may very well do that,
Suppose he had an Oklahoma tag on his car,

and he pulled into an Oklahoma service station, and then rent
to Alaska, would it still be true?
MR, GREEK;

Well, I think in that situation. Your

Honor, he could not reasonably foresee that.
QUESTION:

He couldn't foresee that a man in a car

today is subject to go to any State in the Union?
MR, GREER:
QUSSTION:
MR, GREER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Sir,
CouIdn't he foresee that?
I think he could.
Especially if he says, "Fix that tire

real good, I'm going to Alaska."
So that little filling station man has to defend in
Alas

in Nome.
MR. GREER:

I think when they consider foreseeability

we must consider not only that something will happen there, that
he will be forced to defend there.

On the case of the Oklahoma

license, or the Oklahoma owner, he would not anticipate that he
would have to defend in Alaska.

He would be more apt to think

he would be defending in Oklahoma.
QUESTION:

.Mr, Qreer, may I ask you a question about

the state of the record?

In your complaint, you allege that

31

all four of the Defendants advertised the Audi automobile in
national magazines circulated in Oklahoma and on -national
television that appeared in Oklahoma,

But in the affidavits <;

these two Defendants* they take issue with that statement as
applied to them.

May we assume for purposes of decision that

they do no advertising in Oklahoma?
MR, GREER:

We were not able to prove that these

two Defendants advertised in Oklahoma,

That is true, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:

So, we can assume that for our purposes?
Yes, sir.

The manufacturer and the

importer do.

Certainly you don’t argue to that effect,

35
MR, GREER:

The element of foreseeability has., as 1

said, been recognized by this Court.

It has been recognized in

the Kulko decision, certainly, where Justice Marshall pointed
out that the Defendant could hardly expect to be hailed before
a California court, under the circumstances there presented,
We think it is an entirely different situation here,
where the man is selling ~~ These Defendants are sellin,

m-to-

mobiles for use wherever the purchaser chooses to use them,
of course.
We recognize a difference between the choice of law
and the jurisdictional inquiries, but we were impressed with
;

*1J

Justice Brennan's treatment of this subject, where he urges the
*

Court to bridge the gap.

Certainly many of the choice of law

factors have been touched on and mentioned, and it evidenti;
was. important to the Court, although not overtly recognizing
them on the question of jurisdiction.
We, too, as Justice Brennan pointed out, maintain
that when a suitor seeks to lodge a suit in a State with a
substantial Interest in seeing its own law applied to the
transaction in .question,the .Court could very wellaact to
minimise conflicts, confusion and uncertainty, which is inherent
in this definition of minimal contacts, by adopting a liberal
view of jurisdiction, unless, as he pointed out,’'consideration
of fairness or efficiency strongly point in the opposite dl~
section

41

36

We suggest that the fairness factors, certainly point
to Oklahoma in this case.
Justice Marshall has mentioned the fairness con­
siderations, where he speaks of "basic considerations of fair­
ness as bearing on the proper form for adjudicating the case*'
in the Kulko decision*
And Justice Douglas remarked in the Hanson case that
"the question in cases of this kind should be whether the

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT CP HERBERT RUBIN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, RUBIN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I listened long, but I haven't heard a thing about
State lines or the Federal Court System of the rights of State
Courts to exist and function.

And I believe that the comments

by Mr. Justice Sobeloff become particularly poignant here,
because what is being suggested here is precisely what he was
indicating could happen.

That is, that individual States could

undertake, at the expense of other States, to enlarge the sphere
of their authority to nationwide dimensions, "it requires no
flight of fancy to foresee the resulting maze of lawsuits,
adjudicating interests of persons having only the faintest,
most remote link to the State exercising authority.

The. Due

Process Clause is not effective to restrain such extensions of
local power and the Federal system is likely to be transformed
into something very different from anything we have known."
I think that is precisely what m have here.

We have

39

someone who is suggesting we have some kind of an idea of
fairness.

It is a misunderstanding, to say the least, of i*hat
