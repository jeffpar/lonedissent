Mr. Claiborne, I think

you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ. r
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR* CLAIBORNEs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The case is here on cur petition for certiorari
to the Court of Claims which court directed the entry of an
award of more than some $105 million to the Sioux Nation
in respect of the action of Congress a century ago, to b©
exact in February of 1$77 f in severing some 7 million acres,
the Black Hills area, from what was then the Great Sioux:
Reservation*
Some 88 million of that sura of $.10.3 million of this
award is attributable to interest calculated at 5 percent
over 103 years on the principal sum of $17,3. million which
was found by the Commission, affirmed by the Court of Claims,
to have been the value of these ? million acres in 1377,
QUESTION:

The only issue is the issue of interest?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

That is exactly so, Mr, Justice

Stewart, and that in turn, the issue of interest —
QUESTION:
a "taking”

Depends upon whether or not there was

<&

-V

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Depends entirely whether or not

4
this amounts to a “taking" 'in the Fifth Amendment sense.
QUESTION?

May X ask just in passing, thenc what,

was the §17.1 million?
MR « CLAIBORNE * ' The $17.1 million is the value of
the Black Hills area as found by the Indian Claims Commission,
as affirmed by the. Court of Claims and not disputed by the
United States.
QUESTION*

Welle then doesn't imply that there was

a taking?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Not so.

It is simply that that was

the value of the land in question before the Commission;
left open by the Commission in 1374 was whether there had
bean, in effect, payment to that extent or to a greater
extent the consideration which was given an

undertaking

to provide provisions so long as the Sioux Nation might need
them.
QUESTION*

Now it has been decided that there

wasn't payment and therefore the Government owes th© Sioux
Nation $17.1 million for the value of the Black Hills in

1877 or whatever the date was.
But if you don't quarrel with that, why

doesn't

that imply that there was a taking?
MR* CLAIBORNE*
Justice Stewarts

For this principal reason* Mr.

We are hy special Act of Congress passed

in 1974 forbidden to offset any payments made, with

5
respect to this transaction that take the form of provisions
for subsistence.

But that does not prevent us from talcing

into account that payment in order to determine whether or
not ''deere was a taking.
Moreover, the Court of Claims approached the
question of taking as determined by whether or not the payment
was or was not sufficiant as it turned out but rather on
whether or not the Congress in 187” was acting in good -faith
in attempting to provide a fair equivalent for the value of
the Black Hills by making these undertakings, very substantial
undertakings to provide provisions which, as we say,
ultimately cost the United States amounts in excess of $40
million,
QUESTIONS

But so what was the $17,1 million

for?
MR, CLAZEORNE:

The $17,1 million is simply the,

evaluation of the lane that was severed from the reservation
in 1877,
QUESTIONs

That the Government now owes the Sioux?

MR. CLAIBORNE %

The Government now owes it only

because in the peculiar circumstances of a special Act of
Congress passed in 1974 the Government hence forward is
forbidden to consider for the purposes of the award an offnet
which takes the form of a provision for food rations,
QUESTION s

I understand that but I have difficulty

6

understanding is if it wasn’t a taking, why the $17«1
million?

Now, I can understand your argument if you can

say it was taken but paid for? but I don’t understand why
you could say it wasn’t taken at all if you don’t quarrel
with the $17 million»
HR. CLAIBORNE;

Mr. Justice Stewart, we say that

it was an exercise of the power of Congress to deal with
Indian affairs for the benefit of the tribes»

We say thau

such oases —»
QUESTION;

That what was an exercise?

MR. CLAIBORNE;
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. CLAIBORNE;
QUESTIONs

The Act of Congress of 1877»

Just as it was in Lone Wolf»

Right»

Then they wouldn’t owe the Indians-

anything.
MR. CLAIBORNE 3

Except for the Indian Claims

Commission Act which provided.that notwithstanding that
Congress was exercising its Indian power, if it turns out
that the consideration paid was inadequate or that some
duress was involved in the case of an agreement, as a natter
of a moral claim the court shall allow whatever the deficiency
be»
What is more, as I have said, before, Congress in
IP74 provided with special reference to this case the
exception of -the offset, the payment

largely it wan —

7
paid in food rations shall simply not be allowed as an
alternate.
And for those reasons we are left unable to say
for the purposes of the award we paid for all that and
accordingly must admit our liability unless we dispute the
evaluation, which we cannoto
QUESTIONS

Mr, Claiborne, perhaps this is just

the same question that my Brother Stewart has asked.
What is th® source of '«die Government’s obligation
to pay $17.1 million?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Wall, in our view,. Mr, Justice

Stevens, it is the Indian Claims Commission Act and the ’74
Act, 1974 Act.
QUESTIONs

Well, what do you mean by the Indian

Claims Commission Act, dc you mean «■«*
MR, CLAIBORNEs

The Indian Claims Commission Act

provides that whenever there is a finding that the United
States in its dealings with a tribe paid either an uhoonscionct
eonsideration or was guilty of dealings less; than honorable
in the transaction «**»
QUESTION:

Say that the source of the obligation

i« tb/3 finding by the Commission pursuant to statute that
there was dishonorable dealing by the United States!
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, it so happens here, Mr.

Justice Stevens, that the Commission mad® no such findingE

8

because instead the Commission found that there had'-been a
"faking*5 in the Fifth Amendment sense»
The most recent but the last time, the Court of
Claims dealt with this case it said, no, thV finding of a
constitutional taking is barred by res adjudieada but we,
tee court, will substitute a finding that tee dealings were
less than honorable»

tod on teat basis w© will make an award

without interest for $17.1 million»

ted, indeed, the United

States acquiesced in teat determination and normal course
judgment would have been entered and tee matter would have

^

been at en end.
However,- the Sioux Matior, once again persuaded
Congress to make an exceptional rule and in 1978 the Congress
passed an Act which directed the Court of Claims to ignore
the objection of res adjudieada or collateral estoppel and
to review on the merits the earlier Commission determination
r

that there had, indeed, bean a Fifth'Amendment taking.
On this third round, the Court of Claims acquiesced
cind defined the Commission’s earlier finding that there had
been a taking»
QUESTION:

I suppose that would have been one form,

of dealing with an Indian tribe
i"!R. CLAIBORNE3

Indeed.

The only

cases in this

Court or in tee Court of Claims before this one in which teat
court has found a taking in the constitutional -sense are

9

cases: in which this Court has found it appropriate

to say

that an act of confiscation is not an act of guardianship,
all cases in which the Government gave no undertaking, made
no payment whatever, are very different from tills case in
which the Court of Claims assumed, but did not find, that the
Government had, indeed, undertaken an obligation which in
the fulness of time not only equaled the value of the Black
Hills but perhaps exceeded it*

They found that however to

be irrelevant, irrelevant because they put themselves at the
time of 187? and said, in.effect, Congress didn’t know it
was going to cost the United States that much*
QUESTION;
the language

In the Indian Claims Commission Act is

dishonorable dealing” and that sort of thing

the type of language that would apply between trustee, and
ward or trustee and settle, or whatever you want to ia.ll
it?

■
MR. CLAIBORNE?

No doubt there is noma thought

of that relationship of guardian and ward in the terms of
the Indian. Claims Commission Act*

But at least one of those

provisions, the one that deals with dishonorable dealings,
which is subsection (5) of 25 U.S.C. 78, expressly allows
recovery for claims that would not be recognized at law or
in equity but which as a. matter of moral obligation ought to
be paid and the Commission is directed to make an award if
it finds -that it is a moral matter, not a legal matter, the

10

dealings were less than honorable,
QUESTION i

This proceeding commences —■ the Court

of Claims case commences with the 1974 Act and rests on that,
does it not?
MR, CLAIBORNE!

The Court of Claims decision reste

on the *74 Act and the *73 Act, more recently tee J 78 Act
because
QUESTIONs

Could either of those Acts have said

this shall be treated under the terras of the Fifth Amendment
taking?
MR, CLAIBORNEs .. Mr, Chief Justice, I think Congress
could have of course simply awarded tee Sioux Nation $100
million or whatever sum in tea discretion of Congress it
was thought to he fair,
I don’t think the Congress could direct a court
to bend the rules of the just compensation clause and hint
that they were acquiescing in an award under the Fifth
Amendment*
QUESTIONS

Ds you think Congress could not have

declared ©gainst the whole background that this was a taking
and should be new evaluated on the basis of just compensation?
That wouldn’t be tinkering with the Fifth Amendment taking
clause, would it?.
MR, CLAIBORNEt
QUESTION!

Well, I —

Declaring it was a taking —»

11
MR» CLAIBORNEs
been possible.

Mr. Chief Justice, that may have

I have difficulties.

I think the Chief Justice is suggesting that the
Court still had a role to play and whether the Court of Claims
could be simply required to make evaluation determination,
excepting as a legal matter directed by Congress that tine
Fifth Amendment had been violated* I am not sure whether
there would be separation of powers.
QUESTION:

If the Indian Claims Commission and tho

Court of Claims, each of which is a creature of the Congress f
couldn't declare this was a taking, why couldn’t Congress
have resolved that question in the '74 and 178 Acts?
•

MR. CLAIBORNEii

could have.

Mr. Chief Justice, perhaps they'

Clearly they did not.
"'V

QUESTION:

Well, is that important,that they •:id

not?
MR. CLAIBORNE s

It is important that they purported,

to laave it entirely to the Court to determine under the
usual rule whether or not tills amounted to a taking in theFifth Amendment sens®.

And any side hints thrown out were

prbpsrly disragtrdad»
QUESTION:

In-that process it would not be a

contemporary taking, it would be a etetermination of whether
there had been & taking bade ia I8S8 or *71 or approximately
a hundred years ago.

12
MR* CLAIBORNEs

Indeed, Mr. Chief Justice,

I find that my time has run to the point where X
must be very brief about the background facts of the cane*
The difficulty in the case arises because in 1068
when the Sioux Nation relinquished a large part of its
territory it was provided# among other things, that no
further cession should be accomplished# should be valid
except with the concurrence of three-fourths of the adult
male members.
That treat in 1868 had made a number of provisions
which ware designed to encourage# furnish incentives by way
of money and material aid to tha Sioux to become farmers,
However, it had wholly failed in that respect and shortly
after the 1858 treaty the background situation against which
this transaction must be judged included these elements *
First, gold reports had some, that the Black Kills
were rich in gold.

Now, those reports had begun as early as

186-3 arid, indead, some miners had intruded that early.
Gradually the invasion multiplied*

There were, concededly^

serious governmental efforts to prevent the miners from
intruding and, indeed, to remove them from that ares;*

Those

efforts continued between the date of the treaty in 186 S
and the end of 1375*

They were however largely unsuccessful*

Me doubt the greed for gold exceeded the fear of the soldiers
•and the; invasion of the miners became, in effect,

13
URstoppable, at least without dedicating the entire Army
resources for that single purpose.
QUESTION:

The exchange of letters between General

Sheridan and General Sherman ware of profound interest as to
how serious the Government attempt to prevent the miners
inf lure was»
MR, CLAIBORNE %

There was that exchange which

suggeste that in the view of one general the President
might wink at seme invasions»
On the other hand, there are conceded!/ instances
in which the Army did arrest, did remove, did incarcerate mines
who had penetrated into -the Black Hills.

It was a matter of

timing.
Toward the end of 1875, the President had determined
that this was an impossible policy and he eventually abandon­
ed it by withdrawing his orders to the troops, though he
did not publish them, in November of 1875.
However, I suspect the background of the case is
the conceded dependence of the Sioux on governmental food
rations.

As I have said, the treaty of 1861! which had sought

to make the Sioux self «sufficient farmers' had entirely
failed.

The Sioux in '1875, *76 and *77 were still wholly

dependent on the Government for rations, the Government
expending something over $1 million a year for that purpose„
The Sioux treaty of 1368 had provided that rations should

14

continue for four years but gratuitously without any legal
obligations 'the Congress continued those appropriations for
2~3 years sacra»

And Congress was unhappy with the prospect

that that situation sight continue indefinitely.

After

all# guardian though it was# the guardian is not normally
expected to put his hand in his own pocket for the sake af
his ward»
Another consideration that is an important bad;*»
ground of the case is the value of the Black Hills to the
Sioux themselves.

They knew there was gold there but they

had no intention of removing it.

There was no large game

in the reservation# this was not the hunting ground»

There

was valuable grassing and agricultural land but it appears;
that it had bean put at this period to vary little use by
the Sioux.
And filially# because of tha miners coming in, there
had bean clashes between the miners and the Indians end there
was a prospect that ths.t armed conflict between those two
forces would escalate»
f

In these circumstances Congress determined after
much patient cons:ideration that the only practical' realistic
solutiori was to persuade the Sioux to cede .the hills and.
that determine in -the mind of the Executive

and Legislative

branches -of 'the United fr fcat.es had occurred by the' beginning
of 18 Zb»

The President' had the area surveyed with ‘the view

15
of determining its value so that a fair equivalent could be
paid*

He invited the Sioux leaders to Washington, he

appointed a Commission and that Commission, the Allison
Commission failed.

This was all in 1375.

Upon the failure of any agreement, Congress
considered the matter and while it is not really relevant
to determine precisely what threats were made about cutting
off rations* since this is not a case based upon duress,
i

it is nevertheless important to note that Congress at no
time ever out off the rations.

And, indeed, never -threatened

to cut off the rations except a year hence.

A new Commission was formed.

That Commission

ultimately reached an agreement with the Sioux leaders, albeit
the requisito number of members did not sign.

That agreement,

later ratified by Congress in, the 1877 Act, provider]
relevantly in section 5, that in consideration — and those
are the words of the agreement in the Act ***» in consideration
of the cession of the Hills several undertakings were made
by -the United States, the important one which was a promise
to provide rations for so long as the Sioux might need
them.
Congress waa well aware that it had just
appropriated in -the preceding years over $1 million.

It

had *!®l©ted a provision that rations should continue for only
ten years more? this was- entirely open ended®

Congsrase was

16
obviously aware that, it was undertaking a very substantial
burden,
QUESTION s

What did it amount to over the period

of years? was §50 million the figure you have in the briefs?
MR, CLAIBORNE?

There is a figure of §57 million

which is based on General' Accounting Office reports once
upon a tine conceded by former counsel for the Sioux, which
we cannot say is -any longer conceded.

There was a finding

by the Court of Claims itself in 1942 when this case first
reached that court that as of 15*42 the total amount had been
some $43 million,
Sven allowing for discount, considering that the
payments in the first 20 years exceeded or averaged seise thing
over $1 million a* year, it is evident the United States not
•only paid interest but ’repaid the principal' long before 1942
or tha present.
There is one irony about this case, which is that
the question of taking would not be here at all if either
the *63 Act had not provided that the' signature of the Sioux
leaders was not sufficiant and this had therefore become a
proper treaty or- if three-quarters of the members had bean
persuaded to sign.

Mo matter what duress, no matter how

unconscionable the consideration,, no matter how 'dishonorable
the dealings,-no court has ever found

va

”taking3 when theiee
i

was an: agreement.

Compensation may be due because advantage

17
was taken of the Indians and they are entitled to an award
for the difference but not for the interest®
Had Congress been as high-handed and as callous
as is suggested here, that result no doubt could have bean
accomplished®

After all, the dependence of 'the Sioux on

their rations might have informed a calloused Executive
and a calloused Congress to simply wait until such time as
the Sioux having been cut off, which they never were, were
so desperate that they would indeed sign, there would than
have beer?, an agreement®
Indeed the irony here is that the Sioux in a
companion case involving the 1868 treaty have recovered,
subject to offsets, something over $40 million on the .ground
that they were grossly underpaid, much more grossly than
here, will not raceiva interest on that award®
•

-QUESTIONt

Mr® Claiborne, this $40 million and

'$20 million and all, hem much of that was administration,
costs?
’HR® CLAIBORNEs
QUESTION $

Mr. Justice Marshall, »~

You know we know what happened back in

those days.
■MR® CLAIBORNE t
before the Court.,"

The accounting reports arc exhibits

But those figures were calculated as the

amount attributable to the subsistence' obligation undertaken
'in 1877 -and quite- independently of the obligations which

13
continued under the 1838 treaty.
QUESTION s

Was that the money that the Indians

received or was some of that administrative''costs?
MR» CLAIBORNE?

We know that the procedure with

respect to the rations was to bring cattle onto the
reservation and there be held until such time as they were
slaughtered and distributed 1-1/2 pounds' per parson per
day of beef was the -«■ gross of course «- was the requirement
in the treaty.
The treaty was not vague with respect to these
provisions.

It specified exactly a pound of floor, a pound

and a half of beef, and so forth, per day per person.
To what extent some of these supplies may have gone
astray, I cannot testify.
Not, vm believe that the Court of Claims went
astray in two respects, end I must be prompt.
First, we think the Court of Claims,plying its
own good faith toot,presumed the- Wrong way.

It should have

accorded to -Congress the pr&sumption of good faith as the
Lone Wolf case teaches uc r-abuttab 1© presumption if the
cr-ideafce is overwhelming to the contrary1, of course.

But

instead fch#. Court of Claims relied on the failure of C0r.gre.5s
expressly tb -say we are hereby granting a fair equivalent.
They did say this is it, consideration of.
they meant a? fair consideration.

i

We must assme

19

Now, secondly , it seems to U-S that tine
Court of Claims too narrowly focused on the question of
monetary equivalence0

The United States as guardian is not

merely a land manager,, it has broader duties, and in the
special exigent circumstances with which it was faced here
it may have been in the interest of the Sioux to acquire
even for less than full value this land relatively useless
to them in order to avoid all the dangers, including the
danger that that land would be lost to the miners, including
the danger that if they did not sell it, if it was not
acquired they would be without rations, including the
danger that hostilities between them and the miners would
endanger the future of the Sioux Nation»
I may reserve the balance of my time for re­
buttal»
QUESTIONS

Mr» Claiborne, can I ask you one

question focusing on the 1978 statute where the Congress
enacted legislation, as I read it effectively overruled
the Court of Claims prior holding that the taking claim on
tlie part of the Sioux was barred by res adjudicata.
Does that bother you at all?

You don't awake the

argument, is that conceivably a violation Of the separation
of powers doctrine?
MR, CLAIBORNEs
Justice Blackmun.

I would have thought not, Mr»

2 hesitated to answer the Chief Justice's

20
question as to a congressional finding of taking but I
think Congress is entitled to say, "You may have 'another
opportunity to litigate your lawsuit*“

Mr* Lazarus.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR LAZARUS

JR. , ESQ* ,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, LAZARUSs

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The issue in this case is whether the Act of
February 28, .1877 effected a taking of the Sioux Black Hills
country in violation of the Fifth Amendment for which just "
compensation must be paid under the Constitution,

It is the

Act of 1877 that effected the taking.
Government counsel has alluded to the possibility
of a::, agreement.

Well, maybe -the United States could have

gotten an agreement or it could have forced an agreement.
But it didn’t, it enacted the 1877 statute and it is the
statute, not any agreement that took the Sioux land,
QUESTION:

Was it the 1974 or *78 Act that said

there would be no setoff for the $50 million, more or less,
that was paid? which of those Acts?
MR. LAZARUS:

It-was the 1974 Act which said that

food rations and provisions may not be deemed payments on
the claim.

But the Government gives less to the ’74 Act

than the Act really encompasses.

Because the Indian Claims

21
Commission had determined that whatever the Government
spent on rations was a payment on the claim and therefore
it was wiped out by the *74 statute,,

Congress has taken

that whole claimed amount of money out of this case»
Now) having done that, could Congress

QUESTION^

also have declared that the Court of Claims should proceed
as though there had been a Fifth Amendment taking back
there 100 years ago?
MR. LAZARUS;

Congress could have dona so, Your

Honor, but when I testified before the committee I said the
taking was so clear that Congress did not have to go that
far»

All they had to do was waive res adjudicada and the

Sioux were going to win this case»
QUESTIONi

Well, a couple of lines in that statute

and non® of you would be here today»
MR» LAZARUS j

X think that is true and I think if

weren’ t talking about ;-.'105 million none of us would be here
today either, because this is a clear-cut case of a takrnc»
QUESTION;

Then what was your objection to having

the Act declare that?
MR* LAZARUS;

Oh, 7. am riot sure I could have gotten

the committee to go that f<*r, Your Honor»
What they did was waive res adjudicada and give us
our day in court»

And we told them if we got our day in

QUESTION:

Your second day In court on the

questiono
MR. LAZARUS:

Well, the first day in court was on

food rations and provisions where Congress made a different
kind of finding.

Congress said that —

QUESTION;

The first day though on the taking issue

was some time ago,
MR. LAZARUS;

In 1942 the case was litigated under

a special jurisdictional act and the case was then dismissed
and the basis for the dismissal was a matter of dispute.
When we were before the Court of Claims in 1975 we said
it was dismissed because it was not within the scops of the
jurisdictional act and the majority of the court said other­
wise.
But. in any event, even that majority described
the 1942 decision as whether rightly or wrongly decided, it
was res adjudicada.

They had their doubts even than about

the correctness of the 1942 case.

And of course Congress

in 1978 told us that 19 42 case is washed clean, we conseder
this case now on the merits.
QUESTION;

I take it if Congress took this land,

as you say it did, instead of promising to provide rations
and subsistence it had established a trust fund of X million
dollars and said out of the income from this we will use to
pay rations.

23

Would the case be different?
MR. LAZARUS?

I suppose it would.

Oh, yesf it would,. Your Honor,

If

Congress had made a payment in 1877 ■*•**
QUESTION:

Or established a fund.

MR, LAZARUS?
— if

The fund could be the equivalent of

of course that is the way Indian money was treated
QUESTION?

Yes,

MR, LAZARUS?
the Indians,

-«■ it was never given directly to

It was put in the Treasury tc their credit,

QUESTION?

And if they had promised to set up the

fund and use that to buy rations and distribute them, you
wouldn't bs hare, I take it?
MR, LAZARUSs

If Congress had in fact, set up that

fund I would not be her®.

If Congress had made an indefinite

promise to say, 58We give you §17-1/2 million at soma
indeterminate time in the future to some indeterminate
number of Siouae," that would not be just compensation.

Just

compensation is payment,
QUESTION:

But you say that would not have avoided

being a taking, then?
MR, LAZARUS?
1877 Act was a taking

That is correct.

That would mean the

QUESTIONS

Mr, Lazarus, is the taking issue an open

one in this present litigation?
MR. LAZARUSi
QUESTION:

Well, it is —

X don't mean how you feel about it but

X mean whether it is barred by some previous decision or
barred by the jurisdictional Acts of Congress?
MR. LAZARUS:
critical issue.

Oh, no, the taking issue is the

That is the one the 1877 — the 1978 statute

opened to the court®

That is the only issue before the

Court.
But when you say is it an open issue, it is not
open in this sense.

That is correct.

Well, what if Congress had simply said

instead of trying to take back the 800 square miles consisting
of the Black Hills, “We have a lot of demands on our resources

it is your property and you fight off the individual white

And if it were to devote 90 percent of its

It instead has any number of demands cn

those resources and so it only appropriates 20 percent.
Therefore there are burglaries in the area which depreciate
the value of the property and put pressure on people to
sell, perhaps3
Now, does that amount to a 51 taking5*?
HE. LAZARUSs

You:. Honor, let us assume your

hypothetical„
First, the United States created this crisis? it
wasn’t the Indians who created it, it was the United States
who created it.

The United States took the bulk of the

Sioux land under the 1063 treaty and, as’ Government counsel
has already pointed out, paid them $40 million less than, the
land was worth.

As-a result of that they started impoverish,

that was the fault of the United States.

Arad the United

States kept them from their hunting grounds, so ‘they became
dependant on the United States' for food.
Than the United States first encouraged the miners
to corns?, in and then withdrew -the troops.

Then the United

■Statas rounded up the Sioux and put them on the reservation

28

and took their guns and horses so they couldn * t hunt.

And

there we had this crisis that the United States created.
Now,, let us assume the United States didn’t have
enough money to handle that crisis other than to take the
Black Hills away from the Sioux, which is exactly what it
did.

All wa say is, !S0.K. , pay us.H

And that is what the

United States did not do.
All the United States had to do was to pay us the
$l?-“l/2 million that the land was worth, and it made
absolutely no effort to do so and it hasn’t done it yet.
And I think, Mr. Justice Stewart, you put your finger on
it right at the beginning, because the Government concedes
it hasn’t paid us.

And it concedes that it owes us under

some theory under the Indian Claims Commission Act.

That

can either bs for a breach cf trust, for failure to pay
a conscionable consideration or for a violation of fair and
hone rabla deslings.
The gravamen of each one of those causes of action
is it didn’t pay us.

.And if you didn’t pay us for those

causes of action, you didn’t pay us for a taking, either.

MR. LAZARUSs
Sioux now.

Your Honor,there are 60,000 or more

They are at the very bottom of the economic

ladder even compared to other Indians.

,

The Sioux are among

the most depressed in the entire United States and they are
so depressed, not in least part, because the United States
in 1877 took their most valuable asset, the Black Hills and
it hasn't paid for it yet.
Now, that land which the United States acquired

and turned over to its assigns $1.4 billion in gold has
been taken out of the Homestake mine alone.

That is just

one mine among many.

possessed.

They had a title as sacred as a fee.

use it or not use it.

They could

They might not have wanted to use it

in 1877? they may have wanted to use it in 1910.

The

standard of value is not the value to the Indians? it is
the fair market value and if they wanted to use 'their property
for hunting at that time and for gold at a later time? that
was to be their choice? not the Government's choice.

The

Government had no right to taka it away from them just
because the Government didn’t like the way they were using
it.
Mow, ! would like to point out. Your Honor, because
we have talked a great deal today about money, so X would
like to address the $47 million or $43 million or $57
million that the Government repeatedly raises in its
presentation, both in its brief and on argument her© today.
X regret to say that what Government counsel has told you
about that money, it is just plain inaccurate*

Whet.is in the record in the Court is a General

recognized; it lumps a whole series of expenditures under

And it doesn't tell us whether it was for

provisions; and it doesn’t tell us whether those provisions
were ever delivered and it doesn't tell us if those provisions
were delivered did it 'go to people who weren't entitled to
them; because the Act says that children between the age
of 6 and 14 don't get rations if they are not in school.
And it doesn't tell you whether those rations were delivered
to people living on land susceptible of cultivation and
•their families; because they weren't entitled to rations
either®
So non® of those things could be counted in the
$43 million®

The $43 million includes money that was -spent:,

in 1875 and 18?f that couldn't possibly be consideration

There is not, and our brief shows, a bit

of credible evidence that the Government spent 5 cants for
rations on Bis Sioux.

^

■ But ©van if it had, even if it could prove that
it spent every 'dime of that $43 -million, it would be irreleven

is make them a conditional promis®;

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, CLAIBORNE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please.the Court*
It ill behooves the Sioux Nation who have at least
since 1920 been very much the special favorites of the .laws
to put, themselves in the shoes of a white claimant who would
not be bore, having been barred by limitations, res adjudieada
estoppel by the admission of counsel, setoffs —
QUESTION*

I am having difficulty hearing you,

MR. CLAIBORNEs

A white person in the same shoes

would not bs here, having been barred by limitations, by res
adjudieada —
QUESTION*

Well, not if he were the beneficiary of

■tills same Act of Congress, yes.
MR, CLAIBORNE?

But most important, he would have

been able to plead payment as, indeed, we are free to do,
though not to defeat the award of $17 million but to determine
whether there was a taking.
The Court of Claims in this case was very clear
about that, they held that although the provisions supplied

43

were now allowable as an offset against the award they
were to be taken into account in. determining whether there
was fair dealing or whether Congress acted in good faith.
Now, whether Congress acted in good faith depends
on whether at the time the value of the provisions was
thought to b© somewhat equivalent to the value of the Black
Hills.

The value of the Black Kills is a matter which a

century later gave rise to enormous controversy.

Before

the Commission experts varied between lass than $5 million
to more than $2H million.
The Commission, after months of hearings and with
years to ponder, came up with a figure of $17.1 million.
But Congress cannot be faulted if in 1877 it did
not accurately know that value.

It would still have been

acting in good faith if it had somewhat under-valued the
value of that territory.

It certainly cannot be faulted,

because in fact its promise was over***generous.

And as to

•that prom5.se and its implementation, my learned friend has
suggested that the figure of $43 million is confected.
It comes out of the Government Accounting Office reports,
it is a finding of the Court of Claims in 1942.

It was

increased by an admission, of former counsel in the 1950*3.
It is not a figure taken out of the air.
It is well known and was then well known that
this obligation would exceed some million dollars a year.

44

Congrass had deleted the limitation of 10 years, obviously
anticipating that it might need to b® continued longer.
AT the very;, least, Congress undertook a very serious
substantial obligation which was fully fulfilled and it
ought not now to be said to have been acting in such bad
faith as to constitute an unconstitutional taking.

if it must be done in their interest, may occasionally have
to be done against their will by their guardian»
QUESTIONS

There is one question.

Perhaps we have

covered it# but I just want to be sure.
Going back to Mr. Justice Stewart*s very first line
of inquiry when you first started your argument# I am not
clear in my own mind why if there is the good faith or its
equivalent on which your position ultimately rests# what
la the justification for the $17 million principal award?
How can the two be consistent?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well# Mr. Justice Stevens# thi

Court of Claims has not taken its mandate to find a.
recovery only when the dealings were less than dishonorable
literally.

They, have found that in every circumstance in

which the amount paid was less than a substantial equivalent#
even though in good faith the bargain was made# there will
be an award under the Indian Claim's Commission Act.
In this case the Court of Claims determined on
its own, without; benefit of any finding from the Commission#
.that the dealings had bean less than honor aisle.

The

United States at this point 'could not in any event make
any offsets. • Accordingly* perhaps we could have contested
that finding but; wa were content* as w® then thought* to
pay the $17 million and have done with this protracted
litigation.

48

Had we known that at. the end of the day Congress
would reopen the matter of interest in 1978# perhaps we
would have contested the finding that the dealings 2iad been
less than honorable»

But it was not seemingly necessary to

do so
QUESTIONS

But isn't that correct, that the

acceptance of your position requires us to adopt a view of
the case which would be inconsistent with the $17 million
principal award? if that were still open?
MR, CLAIBORNE;

I think not# Mr. Justice Stevens»

I think the Court can find that the dealings were not wholly
honorable and that results in a moral claim which would not
bear interest and yet find, because that is judged from
hindsight, and yet find that Congress was in good faith
seeking to benefit the Sioux tribe at the time and
accordingly there was an exercise of the Indian power and
not of the eminent domain power. • And, accordingly # no
taking within the meaning of the Fifth -Amendment.
QUESTION:

My basic concern' which prompted me to

ask you that question and those questions at -the outset was
I had had difficulty in -constructing any theory.

If one

begins with a proposition that the United States owes the
Sioux Nation $17 million-plus, I had had difficulty
constructi,ng any theory to support the view that the United
States didn't also owe interest on that amount»

But I

43
think I now understand your answer, which is that the
$17 million resulted, from the action of Congress that
disallowed any offsets»
MR» CLAIBORNE:
QUESTIONs

Exactly so,

Indeed

And that that is inapplicable to the

question of interest,
MR. CLAIBORNE:

When the Court of Claims mads its

decision in 1974 saying the value of the Black Hills is
$17.1 million, it then said in Stage 2 the United States
may prove its offset, including these provisions.
QUESTIONS

Right.

MR, CLAIBORNEs

At that point the Sioux,, realising

that the offset» would wipe out the award, came to Congress
and said, "Forbid that," which Congress did
