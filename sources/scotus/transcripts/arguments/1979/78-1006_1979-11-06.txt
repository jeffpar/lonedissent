Mr„ Jones, you may begin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L0 JONESs ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MRo JONES:
Greer v, Spook

Mr. Chief Justice, three years ago when

this Court upheld an Army regulation that

required the approval of the base commander before written
materials could be distributed on base.

The court held that

the regulation was facially valid and valid as applied to the
distribution of political leaflets by civilians on base.
In this case the Ninth Circuit has held that essentially
identical Air Force regulations are invalid when applied to the
distribution of petitions by servicemen upon base.

The case

arose in 1974 when respondent was on active duty in the Air
Force Reserves.

He prepared petitions addressed to members of

Congress and to the Secretary of Defense opposing military
hair length standards.

’

He was informed by a military attorney

at: Travis Air Force Base in California where he was stationed
that on base distribution of petitions required prior approval
but the off base distribution did not.
Respondent decided simply to distribute the petitions
off base in locations near the base.

But one week later he

took a training plane to Gu;*m and while he was at the base in
Guam he distributed copies of his petitions to personnel at the

Guam Air Force. Base without seeking command approval.

Because

of this violation of the regulation he -was transferred by the
Air Force from active to inactive reserve status.
Respondent then brought this suit and the courts below
declared the Air Force regulations to be invalid and ordered
Respondent’s reinstatement to active duty.

The Court of Appeals

held that the regulations are unconstitutional as applied to
the distribution of petitions in general and are also invalid
tinder 10 U0S0C„

1034

us applied fee petitions to raembex’s of

Congress.
We seek reversal of these two rulings and I will
address the constitutional issue first.
The District Couri: in this case entered declaratory
relief.

We haven’t sought a stay of that.

They also ordered

•reins tat ement but that judgment presumably is held in abeyance
pending the review in this Court.
QUESTION:

There isn’t an order oustending enjoining

the enforcement of these regulations?
MRo JONES:

Not precisely in this case.

In the case

that follows, Huff v. Secretary of the Navy,, there is an
Injunction.

In this case what the Court of Appeals enjoined the

Navy from doing was when Respondent is returned to active duty
the Navy cannot -- I don’t mean the Navy -- the Air Force cannot
apply its regulations to restrain distribution of the
particular petition to restrain distribution of the particular

5
petition that was involved in this incident„
QUESTION:

You don’t challenge the right of the

particular Respondent in this case to make the patitipniiig
that he did do?
MR0 JONES:

No, we don’t.

QUESTION:

Do you challenge his right to be re­

instated?
MR, JONES:
issue.

Well, we haven't sought review of that

If we are correct that the regulations are lawful,

then he would not be reinstated.

The judgment of the Court

of Appeals is based upon the theory that the regulations were
unlawful.
QUESTION:

the Government had in effect conceded that the regulations
were improperly applied

MR* JONES:
QUESTION:

No, that is the other ease.
That is the other; not this case.

I am

sorry.
MRo JONES:

approval
QUESTION:
MRo JONES:
QUESTION:

The distribution was on the base.
It was on the base
In violation of the statutes — the

6

provision of the Air Force.

MRo JONES:
QUESTION:

Yes, it was.
The only question remaining Is whether

that violates the Constitution?

MRo JONES:
QUESTION:

Or IJ0S0Co 1034.
The distribution as well by Sergeant Wolf

as well as Captain Glines.
MRo JONES:

Well, the District Court found that the

that Captain Glines violated the regulation and I think if
you look at the affidavit that was filed by the serviceman
in connection with the complaint, attached to the complaint
you will see that what he said happened is that Captain Glines
approached him in a service bay area, gave him a copy of the
petition -QUESTION:
MR0 JONES:

That is him, Sergeant Wolf?
Yes, sir.

Gave Sergeant Wolf a copy of

the petition, told him he ought to sign it and get other people
\

...

\

to sign it and after it is signed to send it to an address in
California.
There hasn’t been any dispute that if the regulations
are lawful he violated, the regulations.

He may have been in

dispute at the complaint stage but it is not in dispute at this
point.
QUESTION:

Well, again, his violation was handing

the piece of paper, not the oral statements; is that right?

7-8
MRo JOKES:
QUESTION:

That is correct»
Ha can make the oral statements.

If he

didn't have the piece of paper in his hand wanting people to
sign this, he could have said to the man, "I would like you to
draft a letter saying the same thing my letter said"?
MR„ JONES:

Yes.

I don't think there is any question

about that.
QUESTION:

And is the reason there is no question

about it that it is not prohibited by the regulation or that
it is protected by the Constitution or tie statute?

Which is

your reason?
MRo JONES:

Wall, I think the reasons come very

close together and I think that that will be more evident as
I get into my argument.
The regulations in this case concern, only the public
solicitation of signatures and the distribution of petitions on
military bases.

Under these regulations any servicemen they

privately solicit and may distribute petitions off base as
Respondent Giines did in this case without seeking or requiring
or needing command approval.

But when solicitation or

distribution occurs on base the approval of the base commander
must be sought and here as in Greer v. Saock the commander
must approve on base distribution unless it would clearly
endanger military discipline, loyalty or morale or materially
interfere with a military mission.

9
Now, we submit that the regulations challenged in
this case are constitutional for the same reasons stated by
the Court in Greer v. Spock.

The Court held in Greer that

military bases such as the Guam Air Base and Travis Air Base
are not public forums, that is unlike parks and city streets,
military bases should not traditionally serve as places for
public assembly and expression.

Their traditional function,

as the Court stated in Greer is to train soldiers to fight or
to be prepared to fight and not to provide a forum for public
speech activities.
Because of this, as the Court held in Greer, there
is no historical or constitutional basis for right of access
or use of military bases for public speech purposes.

And

military regulations that conditionally authorize public
solicitation and distribution of petitions on bases thus
do not entrench upon, abridge or deny any preexisting
constitutional right.

To the contrary, they establish a

conditional regulatory right that previously did not exist
and it is because of this that the Court rejected in Greer
without comment the claim that the regulations are an over­
broad or a prior restraint: on speech.

The regulation's don't

interfere with preexisting right.
As the Court indicated in the Lehman case, when a non­
public forum is opened on a conditional basis for public
speech, it is the equal protection clause that determines

10

whether the conditions of access or use are constitutional.
And here as in Lehman, it isn’t arbitrary, capricious or
invidious for the military to choose to authorize on base
petitioning activities,

only when they do not clearly

endanger military loyalty, discipline and morale and will not
materially interfere with assigned military missions.
The limitation, to use the Court’s language in the
Police Department v. Mosley is tailed to serve a substantial
Government interest.

It focuses precisely on the abuse to be

controlled.
The Court of Appeals reasoned that this case was
distinct from Greer because this case involves servicemen who
want to exercise speech rights on military bases, while
Greer concerns civilians.

But for servicemen, as for

civilians, military bases have not served traditionally as
forums for public expression and certainly not as forums for
the distribution of leaflets and petitions,

These and other

forms of on base public expressive activities such as
demonstrations and picketing have always been subject to
command approval and indecid are subject to similar regulatory
restrictions as those involved in this case.
The fact that servicemen rather than civilians are
involved in this case supports the regulation.

The military's

authority over the speech and conduct of servicemen is
necessarily far broader than its authority over similar conduct

11

by civilians on military bases.

For one thing, servicemen

are Government employees and this Court has held that the
Government may reasonably limit speech and various forme of
political activity by its employees when necessary to achieve
effective government.

And, in particular, in the context of

soldiers the Court has held in Parker v. Levy that military
may properly prohibit speacy by servicemen that undermines
discipline and order.
It would be incongruous to conclude that servicemen
have a greater right of public expression on military bases
than do civilians.
The Court was of course aware in Greer v. Spock
that servicemen were subject to the Army regulation as well as
civilians and there is no basis for distinguishing this case
from. Greer on the ground that servicemen as wall as civilians
are involved here.
Well, even if we are wrong about that and even if
Greer is wrong, that military bases should be or are open to
public speech activities, the challenge regulations would not
be unconstitutional even under the principles applicable to
public forums.

The substantive goal advanced by the regulations

is undeniably of great importance.

The prohibition of on base

distributions that clearly endanger effective military
performance is obviously related to a fundamental --

12
QUESTION:

Before you leave Entirely ycur first

submission, do I correctly understand your first submission is
that the First Amendment simply has no application to military
bases and therefore even oral statements back and forth between
servicemen may be prohibited?
MR» JONES:

No, our submission is that the First

Amendment doesn't create a right of use of public speech on
military bases.

Now, the private speech of servicemen would

be subject to regulation under the Parker v. Levy standard.
QUESTION:

But If it is speech that does not

create any clear and present danger or interference of
discipline or anything else, it would be constitutionally
protected on the base?
MRe JONES:

Private individual communications between

servicemen would certainly we think be constitutionally
protected except to the extent that Parker v. Levy allotted
the military a broader scope to regulate -'

QUESTION:

<s

You don't have anything as in Parker v.
•'

Levy where it is in effect you might say almost treasonable
or at least advocating a course of action.

Somewhere you

said something you said, I think we ought to do something about
the lousy food here.

You say that that is a constitutionally

protected comment?
MRo JONES:

I think it would be; yes.

Even in a civilian context the Government could

13
refuse any use of a public facility that would create a clear
danger of disorder and the regulation is quite narrow in its
effect.

Servicemen are free to discuss political ideas both

on and off bases.

They are free to petition as individuals

while they are on bases; when they are off duty under current
/

military procedures they can leave, they don't need a pass;
like civilians, they can go off the base and engage in public
petitioning activities.
As Hr. Justice Powell stated in his concurrence in
Greer, in view of the availability of these other avenues of
expression the military prior approval requirement is justified
in this narrow context by the unique need of the military to
insist upon a respect for duty and discipline that has no
counterpart in civilian life.

We think this need is equally

important at the advance Strategic Air Base in Guam where this
case arose and at the combat ready marine facility in
Japan where the Secretary of the Wavy v. Huff arose as at
the basic training facility in Maw Jersey involving
Greer v. Spock.

The regulations are thus constitutional even

if military bases were a public forum.
The Gourt of Appeals also held that the Air Force
regulations are invalid as applied to petitions addressed to
members of Congress under 10 U„S0C0 1034.
QUESTION:

Again, before you leave your second

submission if I may to be sure I understand it, why would you

14
concede that you can say orally that the food is lousy and
we ought to do something about it, and disagree with the
motion "Let's all sign a petition to the commanding officer
asking him to give better food"?

Why is one more disruptive

than the other in terms of the clear and present danger test
or whatever your standard is?
MR0 JONES:

Well, you are referring just to the

second part of our submission.
THE QUESTION:
MRo JONES:

Yes.

I am not sure that we would take the

position that that petition should be prohibited under the
regulation.

I think that it would almost certainly be

allowed for distribution.
THE QUESTION:

So under the second
Well, why does he have to ask

permission to do semething in writing he need not ask
permission to do orally?
MR0 JONES:

Well, you are referring to what is

the inherent distinction then between petitioning and simply
private communication and the distinction is obviously we
think that the petition has an immediate capacity to reach
a far broader audience, to create a far more disruptive effect
within the military and more directly impact upon the
military’s interest in discipline and morale and achieving
its missions.

It is a difference in quantity, if not in

quality, and I think it; is a difference in both.

15
QUESTION:

What if he gave this appraisal of the

quality of the food to an entire platoon; is that a private
communication?
MRe JONES:

Well, if you did it, they were all

standing together in a public area of the base, I suppose that
would be a public communication.
QUESTION:

It would be hard to --

By a private communication, you meant

a couple of ■G0T,,'s grousing in the barracks?
MR, JONES:
that.

That would be a typical example of

Captain Levy’s statements in Parker v. Levy, were made

in a private context. He spoke to several troops but I don’t
think that he massed people together and was attempting to
have a demonstration.

If he had done that it would have

been easily sanctionable under some other provision of the
Uniform Code of Military Justice.
The problem in Parker was that he did speak
privately in a manner that was sanctionable under the
Constitution.
QUESTION:

I may be dense here, but .1 still am

still a little unclear on the distinction.

Say you have got

a group of men that tre sitting around having dinner in the
barracks somewhere.

It is a non-work area, it is not a

public speech or anything.

Do you draw a distinction between

asking permission to criticise in a loud voice at the table
what is being served on the one hand; and on the other hand,

16
supplementing that with a written piece of paper saying, Let’s
all sign and send it to the commander?
disruptive than the other?

And why is one more

That is your distinction, isn’t

it?
MR„ JONES:

Our distinction is a practical one.

As a practical matter — I mean I think you are talking about
a line drawing problem and I don’t dispute that there are
going to be occasions when private communications can have
just as disruptive effect on base -QUESTION:

Well, the word "private'* is a little

misleading because both communications are equally either
private or public, whichever way you characterize it.

There

are 35 people there and ore time it is totally orally and
the other time it is supplemented.
MRc JONES:

Well, I think the petition is inherently

public because it is designed to be cent somewhere.
QUESTION:

Well, the statement to the 35 people is

also designed to get them to do something about the lousy
food.

The petition is designed to get somebody else other

than those 35 to do something about the lousy food.
MRo JONES:

That is certainly one characteristic

that makes the petition inherently more public.
QUESTION:

Wall, also the petition serves to put

in some sort of distributable form the opinion of those 35
people if they all sign it.

17
MR0 JONES :
QUESTION:

That is right and -You 'may orally ba able to walk away and

say all 35 agreed with me but if they have signed a piece of
paper, it is something else again.
MRo JONES:
are involved.

I think those are the distinctions that

I do think that it is not easy on the margin,

to know which where the effect is going to be greatest.

But

certainly in -- this is a challenge to the regulations on
their face and as a practical matter the regulatory restriction
of petitioning is response to the -QUESTION:

I can understand petitioning is more

likely to be effective for the reasons that my Brother White
identifies.

But the question is, which Is more disruptive

I suppose; and therefore justifies prohibition?
MR0 JONES:
more disruptive.

I certainly think the petitioning is

As I mentioned before, if it is designed to

be circulated the regulation prohibits the distribution of
petitions.

If it is designed to be distributed through the

facility, then obviously it is going to reach a far broader
audience than any group of people sitting around having lunch
might talk about a problem.
QUESTION:
true.
was 35.

I just wonder if that is universally

Here you had a petition with eight people and my example
You are drawing a constitutional distinction now
MRo JONES:

Well, the military is drawing a

18
distinction based on the evil that it has designed its
regulation to prevent and I think as a practical matter on an
aggregate basis its distinction is defensible.

I think that

it would be harder to defend a regulation that simply said
any form of public expression is subject to regulation.

By

focusing on petition they focused on a concrete type of
expression that is traditionally and I think inherently public
in nature.
The statute that the Gourt of Appeals ruled -- based
its ruling on concerning petitions to members of Congress is

10 UoS0C0 1034.

That statute is brief, and I will quote

it:

' "Ng person may restrict any member of an armed
force in communicating with a member of Congress unless the
communication is unlawful or violates a regulation necessary
to the security of the United States."
Well, from 1951 when this statute was enacted until
1978, the consistent administrative and judicial construction
of the statute was that it applies to individual communications
such as letters but is inapplicable to group petitioning
activity.

Indeed, in Carlson v. Schiesinger, decided three

years before by the District of Columbia Circuit, the court
construed the statute to apply only to individual correspondence
Tie language and the history of the statute support that
interpretation.

19
There is no question whatever why this statute was
enacted.
In 1951 a sailor had been threatened with a courts
martial if he wrote a letter to his congressman without
sanding it through the Navy chain of command as Navy
regulations then required.

Congressman Byrnes learned of the

incident and canvassed the services and determined that only
the Navy imposed such a restriction on individual correspond­
ence.

The Air Force for example informed Congressman Byrnes,

and I quote:
"Any airman's personal correspondence remains a
matter entirely of his own choice."
Congressman Byrnes proposed this statute to make the
Navy's practice uniform with that of the

Army and the Air

Force by overturning the Navy's restriction on individual
communications.
Congressmen Byrnes and Vinson thus stated twice on
the floor of the House that what this statute does is, and I
quote:
"Permit any serviceman to sit down and take, a pencil
and paper and write to hi3 congressman or senator."
The sponsors could not have been more clear in
stating the limited objective of this legislation.
The Court of Appeals discarded the statements of
legislative intent on the theory that the word "communication"

20
employed in the statute necessarily include petitions as well
as correspondence.

But we don’t dispute that any individual

letter stating a grievance can be characterized as a petition.
But what the statute was designed to protect was tha
individual’s private communications to Congress, not public,
on base group activity.

Nothing in the regulations in this

case interferes with any serviceman's individual communications,
however they are described.
what the statute doesn't:

The regulation encompasses only
public activities, distribution of

petitions on base rather than the communication of the petition,
the private communication, to Congress.
When Congress is legislated with respect to group
petitioning activity in other contexts,it is done so expressly.
5 UoSoC, 7102 was enacted 40 years before this statute.
And it provides that the right of civil service employees, and
I quote:
... individually or collectively to petition Congress
may not be interfered with or denied.”
Congress had a madel if it wanted to reach collective
group petitioning activities.

But in 10 U0SoC0 1034, the

language is limited to individual communications because the
evil the Congress had before it was interference with the
privacy of those communications.
Assuming that the statute applies to group petitioning,
the challenge regulations are nonetheless valid because they

21
don't restrict the communication of the petition.

The kind

of restriction that Congress was it enacted the statute was
on the communication itself on the requirement that the Navy
then had that private letters be sent through the chain of
command.

Well, the regulations don't restrict communications

in that sense.

Any letter or petition may be sent to Congress

wholly without military review.
What the regulations restrict is the use of military
bases, ships and aircraft as forms for solicitation and
distribution.

It is the military's unwillingness to provide

a forum for this conduct in limited circumstances.
A restriction on the communication of the petition to
Congress.

It is only if the statute intended to impose

affirmative obligations on the services to open military
facilities to conduct traditionally prohibited.

Certainly

nothing in the statute or in its legislative history indicates
that this is what Congress intended.
We agree with Judge Tamm in his dissent in the Huff
case that it is inconceivable that Congress in 1951 in the
middle of the Korean War intended to create a public forma
right for group petitioning activities on military bases.
Group action as in the distribution of petitions on military
facilities is not mentioned even briefly in the legislative
history.

And because the regulations don't restrict

communications within the meaning of the

statute they are

22

not invalid under 10 U0S0Co 1034.
There are additional points to be made on this
issue.

The next ease to be argued also raises the. statutory

issue.
I would like to reserve the balance of my time for
rebuttal in this case.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Jones.

Mr. Cobin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M, COBIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, COBIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
i

Does military security require the abridgement of
a fundamental right, the right to petition the Government to
redress grievances by means of a prior restraining, one of
the most extraordinary remedies known to a jurisprudence?
The Government has never demonstrated that it does,
not in the District Court and not in the Court of Appeals and
not in this Court.
The Government*;; position is that - as I understand
it, that circulating petitions by its nature somehow leads to
a breakdown of military capacity.
QUESTION:

How capable are

judges deciding that

as opposed to base commanders?
MR, COBIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think that judges

23
are in many ways in a better position to decide on a
constitutional basis.
QUESTION:

They are more neutral, certainly; but

as a factual matter how capable are they?
MR0 COBIN:

I believe, Your Honor, that if the

military commanders could separate themselves from their
positions, desiring only that activities they desire to take
place continue, if they do not have the respect for the right
to petition as the commanders involved in these cases have,
then they would be in a good position, Your Honor.

But, they

are not able to separate themselves.
QUESTION:

In any event, necessarily the Congress

when it put in those conditions required the Judiciary to
apply them, didn't they? ~~ in case of controversy.
MR0 COBIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Did Congress really make a declaration

— if I tinder stood your language correctly -- that these
episodes lead to or -- or that on the basis they have a tendency
to lead to --MRo COBIN:
QUESTION:

You mean -Congress didn't say that every action

in violation of this statute leads to breakdown in morale and
loyalty in a military organization»

MRo COBIN:
"Congress."

Mr. Chief Justice, you used the term

Do you mean the military commanders in this case

24
or the Secretaries who drafted the regulations that were
enirorced?
QUESTION:

The regulation that separates.

When

Congress acted after Congressman Byrnes introduced this
provision and what he said in both the introduction and
Chairman of the Military Affairs Committee Carl Vinson said,
was this was intended to make sure that every service person
could sit down with, his pencil and write a letter to his
congressman.

Now, the Congress was saying there that they

were preserving that right; Congress didn't think that was
going to bring any breakdown.

But the regulations are cast

in terms of the general tendency and propensity of public
activities, are they not?
MRc COBIN:

They are directed specifically — the

Air Force regulation of course is directed specifically at
the circulation of petitions,
QUESTION:

That is quite different from sitting

down with your pencil,
MRo GOBIN:

A:i Congressman Carl Vinson said -In terms of the acts involved it is

certainly different, but in terms of the effect it has on
military security I believe that is not true.
The position that the Government has taken I
believe contains several fundamental errors.

And one of those

errors is that somehow petitions lead to grievances rather
than grievances leading to petitions.

Those who circulate

25
petitions have a grievance and the question is whether the
traditional means of expressing a grievance to the Government
by petitioning including the peaceful circulation of petitions
is an option.

I would like to give an illustration which I

think at least demonstrates in these cases that the right to
circulate a petition is a less of a danger to military
asecurity than the abridgement of it, or it could be.
The USS HANCOCK and the USS RANGER in the years 1972
and 1973 ware berthed next: to each other at Alameda Naval Air
Station when they were not: at sea.

In fact the trial of

Allen v. Monger partially took place on board the USS RANGER.
Both ships contained military personnel who didn't want the
ships to go to sea.

In the case of the USS HANCOCK, one

member of the crew requested permission to circulate a petition,
it was denied, he circulated it any way, and he was punished
for it.

Five other members of the ship filed a suit asserting

their right to circulate that petition.

That ship did sail

and it sailed with all five of the servicemen aboard.
QUESTION:

Well, don't you think there is a tendency

in a case like that for the military complement on the ship
to be less willing to obey orders if they just had a petition
circulated to them saying let's cut out this business of
sailing?
MRo COBIN:

No, Your Honor.

The petition in the

particular case was asking Congress to look into the necessity

26
of making a cruise.
QUESTION:

What if the petition had simply been not

to Congress but to other servicemen into the base or to the
commanding officer of the ship saying, Wa think it is a
terrible idea to sail tonight and we want you to call the
thing off?
MRo COBIN:

The question is whether that would have

a tendency to make the members of the ship less mindful of
orders?
QUESTION:

To participate in the maneuver which had

been ordered.

MRo COBIN:

I would suggest that the trained members

of the service would not have that tendency.
However, if there were a petition it is certainly
possible for a petition to be inflammatory as any statement
could be inflammatory, but the Uniform Code of Military
Justice would permit stopping of that petition if it had such
a tendency in the punishment of the petitioner without the
regulations that are challenged here.
QUESTION:

MR„ COBIN:

How?

By trial after it was circulated?

Trial after the initiation of

circulation.
QUESTION:

Well, so if the military mission would

still be interfered with.
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, I do not believe that

27
is true.

This Court in Parker v. Levy and in Middendorf v.

Henry insured the power, the ability of a military commander
to bring -- to swiftly control any disturbance.
QUESTION:

Well, but you just said that under the

Uniform Code of Military Justice all that can be done is to
punish after the petition is circulated and you conceded that
that is all that can be done, as I understand, even with an
inflammatory petition that could impair the willingness to
obey orders.
MR0 COBIN:

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, Article

134 authorizes punishment

and I am quoting, of "all disorders

and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline."
I do not believe that an extensive circulation
would be required for a commanding officer to act under that
provision.
At the first sign. of danger, that through the
authority given commanders under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice by means of non-judicial punishment or summary court
martial with informal procedures or a special or general
court martial with formal procedures that the person causing
the problem could be punished and the acts could be stopped.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't it be better assurance of the

security of the Nation in its performance to require advance
clearance?
1

MR0 COBIN:

No, Your Honor, and that Is because

28
the -- since grievances do not go away the person who would
circulate a petition peacefully may choose some other means of
expressing the grievance.

And the illustration that I want

to give is on the USS RANGER the serviceman who did not want
the ship to leave didn’t circulate a petition but dropped a
wrench in the gears, and that ship didn't go out for four
months and it cost the Government $800,000 to repair the
damage.
QUESTION:

You say this is kind of an outlet for

throwing monkey wrenches into the machinery?
MRo COBIN:

It is the outlet that was selected by

history and by the Constitution and remains to be the legitimate
outlet for the expression of grievances.
that was made by Professor Calvin

The distinction

in the Law Review article

that was cited by both, the Government's brief and in my own.
It distinguishes between three ways of expressing grievances.
One Professor Calvin calls a revolutionary act, and Captain
Levy in Parker v, Levy did such a revolutionary act.
is civil disobedience.

Another

And the third is peaceful protest.

Professor Calvin calls peaceful protest the purest axerciae
of First Amendment freedoms.

And the peaceful circulation of

a written petition is the most — is the purest form of
exercising peaceful protest.
Referring to the. speech of Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc
I quoted in my brief, I understood two points relevant to this

29
ease to be made in that speech.
One of those points was that orderly expression
serves constitutional goals.

And the other is that everyone

must recognize that that right of orderly expression belongs to
all.
QUESTION:

Well, no one really doubts that orderly

expression serves those purposes in a public place by civilians.
The question‘is much narrower than that here.
MR0 COBIN:

But Mr. Chief Justice, for a serviceman

the place where the serviceman lives and works and does day
to day activities is on a military base.

In the case of

Allen v. Monger for instance the place where circulation
was attempted was a ship.
of the year.

That ship was at sea eight months

The only place that the expression of grievances

could take place during that eight months is on board a
ship.

For servicemen the ship is *»- the public place is on

board the ship, is the public forum.

I do not believe a

public forum must be found to the exercise of the right to
petition.

However, for the serviceman tills is the public

forum.
The Government has made the distinction between
public acts and public, speech and private speech.

But the

particular facts of this case indicate how circulation of
petitions can very well be a private speech and how the
particular regulation completely eliminates the ability to

30
enage in that speech.
The Respondent in this case was on an overnight
stop-over in Guam.

He was on Guam only for eight hours, from

midnight until 8:00 in the: morning.

The ground crew came

aboard the plane to clean the plane and one of them was handed
a copy of the petition.
eight signed it.

He took it back to his barracks and

This is the normal kind of speech activity

that the Constitution was designed to protect.

It was done

peacefully, it was done privately, it created no disorder -until
the commanding officer reacted to the exercise.
It is the Respondent’s position that the role of
commanding officer should not be to restrain peaceful petition­
ing but to encourage it.

The Respondent does not dispute

the authority of commanding officers to make appropriate time,
place and manner restrictions.

Peckham in the lower court

decision in Allen v. Monger specifically listed time, place
iand maimer restrictions that would ba appropriate for an
.aircraft carrier.
QUESTION:

What does Judge Peckham know about an

aircraft carrier?
MRo COBIN:

Veil, Judge Peckham toured the USS RANGER

to assist him in making that determination, Your Honor,
QUESTION:

We. 1, does he know an much as a commanding

officer of an aircraft carrier?
MR, COBIN:

No

Your Honor, I am

sure that he does

31
not.
However, what Judge Peckham did conclude was that —
QUESTION:

Even though Judge Peckham knows a little

bit more about constitutional law.
MR0 COBIN:

Yes, sir, a good deal more about

constitutional law.
And Judge Peckham concluded that there were places
on board that ship that peaceful petitioning without face to
face proselytising could take place peacefully without
disrupting the ship.
MR0 COBIM:

We are talking about two different

things and I certainly agree with my Brother Stewart that
Judge Peckham undoubtedly knows more about constitutional law
than the commanding officer of the ship; and I take it that
my Brother Stewart probably agrees with me that the commanding
officer of the ship knows more about the ship than Judge
Peckham does.
Isn't this basically a factual inquiry where would
petitioning be appropriate on this particular ship?

MRo COBIN:

Yes, Your Honor; and I believe that the

regulations would be effected by the commanding officers of
the ship.
QUESTION:
MRo COBIN:

Didn't Judge Orrick decide this case?
Yes.

Judge Peckham decided the Allen

v. Monger case which is pending before the Court.

32
QUESTION:

Judge Orrick I think does know something

• 'i*' ■

about the Navy, if I am not. mistaken.
MR0 COBIN:

Your Honor, one of the ■»- the basic

problem with the regulations as urged by Respondent is that
they enable a prior restraint to take place.

At each of the

times a request has been made to circulate a petition that
that restraint has been exercised and that no circulation was
allowed to take place.
It is not the role of the commanding officer to
determine the bounds of the Constitution and in an individual
case the commanding officer because of his role is bound to
deny petitions.

And in the Huff ease which will be argued

this afternoon the Government has conceded that those denials
were wrongful.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cobin, do you think there is a

material distinction between circulating a petition in a
peaceful manner and orally soliciting support for a position
and suggesting that others write letters in a form that you
hand out or something like that?
MR0 COBIN:

Yes, Your Honor, that the circulation

of a written petition is more affective.
QUESTION:

How about in terms of potential

disruption to discipline?
MRo COBIN:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, I do not.
You think the only difference is

33

that one is more effective than the other.
MR0 COBIN:

As a general basis, that is true.

I believe that Captain Levy’s statements to the
troops under his command before him which was punished after
the fact under the Uniforxa Code of Military Justice was much
more disruptive than any of the petitions that had been
brought.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that maybe the right

test should be based on the content of the communication rather
than the form In which the time, place and manner kind of
which the appeal takes?
MR, COBIN:

1 believe that the proper standard would

be a time, place and manner — a reasonable time, place and
manner restriction being allowed and the provisions In the
Uniform Code of Military Justice enable a commanding officer
to stop petitioning and to punish disruption if it occurs.
. QUESTION:

You think for example a petition by say

a member of the Ku Klux Klan who happens to be in the Navy
saying that no white should serve under black officers, or
something like that, might be disruptive?
MR, COBIN:

No more than a speech to the same

effect, Your Honor.
The role of the commanding officer rather than
restraining a petitioning

restraining a petitioning will

not eliminate racist attitudes.

Nor will it eliminate angar

34

or belief in oppression or any other kind of feeling that
brings forth the grievance.

If a commanding officer used

his authority to encourage peaceful petitioning, to encourage
a proper respectful attitude towards the First Amendment and
a recognition of the importance of civility, if I may use
the word,for expression of speech, then that would maximize
«the ability of both satisfying the Constitutional protections
and protecting military security.
QUESTION:

And yet is there any doubt in mind ~~

I am reminded simply because of the play Julius Caesar was
on television I think Sunday night and first Brutus speaks
to the crowd and the crowd is very sympathetic to Brutus in
justifying his slaying of Caesar.

And then Mark Anthony

speaks and completely turns the crowd around.

Is there any

doubt in your mind that large groups of people confined in
close quarters can have their moods altered rather quickly
by communications?
MRo COBIN:

No, I have no doubt of it, Your Honor.

However, you will note that that change occurred because of
oral expression and not the circulation of a petition.
QUESTION:
MRo COBIN:

Right.
And also that the limitations of the

numbers of the persons gathering is a part of a reasonable
time, place and manner restriction.

And that a commanding

officer at the first sign of that kind oi: problem can stop

35
it.
If I may refer you to the case of Parker v. Levy
again, Captain Levy engaged in a number of speeches that ware
highly prejudicial to the military.

Nonetheless, the commanding

officer there appeared not to have any problem in taking care
of the matter'.

At first the thought was to give non™judicial

punishment after Captain Levy was cautioned.

Later it was

determined that a court martial was appropriate.

If that

case didn’t cause problems to the command, I cannot conceive
of a petition that could cause greater problems.
Unlike the civilian life there is an obligation of
members of the military service to inform a commanding officer
of a danger to military security.
In addition to the abilities under the Uniform Code
of Military Justice —
QUESTION:
MRo GOBIN:
QUESTION:

Do they need a petition to do that?
No, Your Honor.
Ail they have got to do is ask for leave

to speak to the commanding officer, don't they?
MRo COBIN:

That would depend on the grievance, Your

Honor.
In this ease and in all of the cases that are brought
to Federal courts the grievances have been directed to members
of Congress or in this case also in addition to the Secretary
of Defense.

36
QUESTION:

Isn't this as someone suggested, perhaps

in briefs or argument that preceded, that this is a matter of
line drawing; and this Court has said and many courts have
said whenever you draw the line you can always have a
hypothetical case which is on one side of the line when it
really ought to be on the other.

MRo COBIN:

That works both ways.

The line the Respondent is seeking to

have this Court draw is a line between a prior restraint and
time, place and manner regulations with a power of punishment.
QUESTION:

But if you are against prior restraint,

then it wouldn’t make any difference how inflammatory an
utterance was.

That is the only test.

MRo COBIN:

The Uniform Code of Military Justice

permits the commanding officer to intervene whenever there
appears to the commanding officer a danger to military order.
And whether that be inflammatory or be through some other
<*

kind of problem, the commanding officer can take authority to
prevent the disorder from occurring.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cobin, you have talked about several

decisions, particularly Parker v. Levy.

I don’t know that

you have mentioned the case upon which, the Government
primarily relies, Greer v, Spoek, have you, which did involve
of course a prior restraint?
MRo COBIN:
QUESTION:

I have not.
And that is the prime reliance of the

37

Government.
MR» COBIN:

Respondent’s position is that that

case obviously does not apply to this case because it involves
both the speech interest involved and the policies involved
were entirely different, that that decision permitted a
commanding officer to keep civilians off of a military base»
And it is that primary ability plus the policy of maintaining
a neutral political — politically neutral military that seems
to me to be the basis of that decision.
On the other hand, this is the right of persons
already on a military base with a right and an obligation to
be on a military base to engage in speech activities that
are protected by the Constitution.
QUESTION:

When Greer v. Spock was argued, and I

think the briefs reflect that during the Civil War *■- toward
the end of the Civil War when an election was coming up there
was great activity on the part of officers and others
— junior officers -- lining up votes for Mr. Lincoln. Now,
do you think that is less a problem when a member of the
military personnel does it than when a stranger from off the
base does it?
MR» COBIN:

I think that the problem of — I believe

that it is not so much the problem that that would be different
but the ability of the commanding officer to take charge with­
out a prior restraint that is different.

A commanding officer

38

has very limited authority over a political candidate who
is on the base.

The only authority is to make a candidate

leave and perhaps initiate civilian prosecution.
i

QUESTION: Well, if he leaves, then that is prior
restraint, isn’t it, if he forces the civilian to leave?
MRo COBIN:

Not if the basis for ordering the civilian

-"'to leave is the improper activities commenced on the base.
But the power of a commanding officer over a member under his
command is greater than the authority of anyone else in this
country.
QUESTION:

Does he have the same right to circulate

petitions an. enlisted man would have?
MRo COBIN:

I would hope so. Your Honor.

QUESTION: The gentleman could have circulated
petitions saying, "Please nominate me for President."
MR. COBIN:

I think there may well be other

provisions that restrict —
QUESTION:

that?

MRo COBIN:

I would believe that you would have
\

the constitutional right to circulate a petition.

If that

petition involves something that interfered with another -QUESTION:

He wants to be President.

Can you under

stand my example?
MRo COBIN:

I understand the example, Your Honor.

39
I am not sura I understand all the implications of it.
QUESTION:

Well, that is part of the difficulty with

i

this case.

I mean, what are the implications of giving a

constitutional protection to the right to circulate petitions?
I suppose you may giye the military leader the same right
and it may give him'a political weapon of some consequence.
f

That is what I am .suggesting.
QUESTIONS:

The colonels and majors and

captains

that were lining up votes for President Lincoln among the
Union soldiers were certainly more effective than Dr, Spock
coming.on the base, wouldn't you think?
MR0 COBIN:

Yes, Your Honor, I think a specific

limitation upon commanding officers might be appropriate
because of a particular problem that their circulation of
petitions might -.<•
>.

QUESTION:
MR0 COBIN:
QUESTION:
MR, COBIN:

How about top sergeants?

No, YoUr Honor,
They wouldn't be effective at all?
I don’t see that top sergeants:

circulating petitions peacefully, that by their nature do
not cause a problem -•* present \ny constitutional problem as
suggested by the example.
QUESTION:

You don’t suggest that rights are based

MRo COBIN:

No, Your Horsr, what I am saying is I

40
certainly haven’t thought out the problem of a commanding
officer seeking to be President and using his authority to
do so through the use of a petition.
QUESTION:

An enlisted man is much more in fear of

the top sergeant than he is of the commander.

Take it from

one who served as an enlisted man.

Only on occasion.

The essential position of Respondent Is that
military security is adequately and indeed better served by
time, place and manner restrictions on peaceful petitioning.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there at

1:00 o'clock.

to reconvene at 1:00 o’clock p.m., the same day.)

AFTERNOON SESSION

\

1:00 P„M0

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Cobin, you have about

three minutes left, I understand.
MR0 COBIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I would like to respond to the question of a base
commander, a General MacArthur or base commander or even a
top sergeant circulating a petition that would influence their
election to a political office.

These regulations that are

challenged here are not designed to deal with that problem.
They are not designed to deal with command influence and they
do not speak about such questions.

But Articles 133 and 134,

i

conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, the general
article, and other laws that T<?ere enacted such as the Hatch
Act, are designed to deal with that.

And that we are not

asking that this Court rule there are no limitations that
can be placed upon the right to petition, only that a prior
restraint is unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

The regulation on page 3“A of the

Government’s petition says members of the. Air Force.

Now,

certainly that includes base commanders as well as privates,
doesn't it?
MRo COBIN:

The regulation says that solicitation

of signatures shall not take place on an Air Force facility

42
without the approval of the base commander.
QUESTION:

But isn't the base commander the chief

executive officer and all the privates and. sergeants all
within the definition of the words "members of the Air Force"
as used in that regulationi
MRo COBIN:
himself.

But a base commander has a commander

And there is nothing to prevent the commanding

officer over a base commander from talcing charge and
punishing ©r stopping an illegal * improper solicitation of
signatures by a base commander, just as General MacArthur
was removed from the Army by the Chief Executive of the

Armed Forces, the President.
QUESTION:

Who was not a member of the Arsed

Forces.
MR, COBIN:

However, who 1® Chief Executive.

The point I a® trying to make is that there is the
power under the Uniform Cod© ©£ Military Justice by commanding
officers to deal with person® under their command who

conduct unbecoming m officer and a gentleman.

that alleged conduct might not they have First Amendment
defenses?
