ORAL ARGUMENT OF S. HAZARD GILLESPIE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. GILLESPIE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

I speak for petition of The Boeing Company.

This

ease is here by writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit to review a 6-3 sn banc decision of that
court dealing with what it said it regarded as having unusual
significance for the conduct of class action litigation.
Specifically, whether attorneys for plaintiffs who successfully
prosecute a Federal class action for money damages are entitled
to look for their compensation to the total amount for which
a defendant would be liable if all class members perfected
their claims by filing proofs of claims or or ly from the amounts
payable to those class members who do file proofs of claim
and thus receive the benefits of the legal services rendered
by the plaintiffs1 attorneys.
The Court ©£ Appeals decision here under review held
that the plaintiffs' attorneys were entitled to be paid not
only from money actually claimed by their client class members
but also from unclaimed money which 'that court in an earlier
decision in this very ease held will never belong to or become

4

the proparty of any client of these attorneys„
Nov, it is the position *—*
QUESTIONS

What would you think of the hypothetical

situation that one of the members of the class wrote in to the
Court and said# X think the court has been wrong in the decision#
.L

'

I don’t thinly there is any money due me from Boeing Company,
s

.

■

and therefore I refuse to accept it?
'' MR* GILLESPIEs

Well# Your. Honor# I think you have

almost, that situation right here»

The brief that is amicus

curiaed that has been filed by th© Special Master appointed
to administer /this fund informs the Court that claimant# or
rather holders of 12®#000 face amount of these debentures
£
haverbeen identified, they have been in touch with and they
have declined to file proof» of claim,
■

f'T

.

QUESTION:

•

They haven’t affirmatively renounced#

however, have they?
MR. GILLESPIEj

Ho, they have not. Your Honor.

But there is no question of their not being reached
\
•
and told that they could do this,

X:

■

y
i

QtIKSTIOM*

My hypothetical is a parson who affirmatively

)
renounces on the grounds that he thinks —
MR. GILLESPIE;

I think -that is an an & fortiori

case under those circumstances, if he renounces there ia no
reason why his share of "Shat recovery should be utilised to
pay the attorneys for tlx® class members who have claims, under

5

tills Court’s decision»
QUESTIONS

You think there is no difference then

between an affirmative renunciation and a passive, neglectful ~MR. GILLESPIEj

Quite right, Mr. Chief Justice?

quite right.
Now, it is our position, or the position of The
Boeing Company on this appeal, and it was the position of a
panel of the Second Circuit which decided this ease prior to
the en banc decision,that to allow plaintiffs' attorneys to
9

be compensated for monies -that are not claimed is two fundamental
errors.
One, that it is requiring claiming class members, ©r
it is entitling claiming class members to benefit from monies
to which thay ar© not entitled.
And second, that it would b® a direct violation of
this Court®s holding in the AXyeska Pipeline Company ease
because the funds which are not claimed would revert t© the
defendant; in the

cm®

and -therefore if they had skimmed off

of them sums to pay the claimants’ attorneys, there would be
a case of the defendants paying part of the legal expenses
of the plaintiffs in violation of -this Court's rule in
.iXyeska that each party should pay its own attorneys' fees.
Now, before proceeding to spell out the detail
of that argument I would just take a minute to describe the
background of the action against which this question comes t©

Your Honors.

This action is th© consolidation of tan suits

which wer® commenced in 1966 after Boeing# as part of its
program to finance the construction of the 747 Boeing aircraft#
called for redemption a $30 million convertible debenture
issue which it had sold in 1953.

Under the terms of the

.r

indenture pursuant to which these securities were issued# the
holders had & specified period after a call for redemption
within which to convert their debentures to Common Stack*
Otherwise, the holder would b© limited in the future to
receiving only th© face amount of his debenture and not any
accrual that might have occurred in the value of the 'Common
Stock at th© time of th®, call.
In this instance on the day when the right to
convert ©spired, March 29, 1966, Boeing Common Stock was selling
for a price at which $100 of principal amount, of debentures,
i.f converted would hav© bean worth $316.25, cr $216.25 more
than its face amount.

These convertible debentures were

unregistered bearer debentures and after the call for redemption
tad after the time to convert having expired, 1,543,300 face
«mount of the 39 million had not been converted.
Baaing, faced with this problem of what it should
do about those who had failed to claim, sought the advice of
two Ism firms, whether in fairness to non-converting holders
and also in fairness to its own shareholders, many of which
had become shareholders by reason of converting in time, sought

7

the lidvice of two law firms as to what it should do under these
ci reams t anoes*
.2 emphasis© this because this is no case of fraud or
impropriety on behalf of anyone.
the circumstances.

They were in a dilemma under

The two firms advised them that they could

not 'extend the time without violating the provisions of the
indenture under which these securities had been issued,»
And. under those circumstances Boeing followed the advice /and
very shortly along cam® these ten lawsuits.

They ware

consolidated in the Southern District of Hew York and The
Boeing Company moved for class action treatment under Rule 23,
which the court granted.
QUESTIONi

What was the basis of jurisdiction in the

Southern District of New York?
MR. GILLESPIE:

Well, the basis of jurisdiction,

there were claims made under the Trust Indenture Act and under
the Securities Act of 1934.
QUESTION:

But did **- were those the actual bases

of decision in either the District Court of the Second Circuit
or was it e. principle of New York law?
MR. GILLESPIE:

Well, are you referring to the

compensation decision or the original decision unde? which the
District Court dismissed this action on the ground that the
indenture had been fully complied with? are you referring to
that decision, Your Honor $ or are you referring to the

&

compensation decision which is hers before the Court?
QUESTIONS

Both,.

MR, GILLESPIE;

Wall, I think on the first decision,

on the merits it is very clear that they went on the Trust
Indenture Act and the Federal Securities Act,
On the compensation question which is here, I think
they went as a

matter of general Federal law.

They did not

utilize Mew York law, although Mew York law in every respect
as we see it is the ssis© as Federal law with regard to tills
question,
QUESTIONS

This was not in any-

sense then at my

stage of the proceedings ® case of pendent jurisdiction,
MR. GILLESPIE;

It was not, Your Honor,

Now, the District Court after trial dismissed the
complaint here, as I said a moment ago, holding that the
indenture had been complied with and that there was no basis
for these debenture holders .recovering,

s
Appealed to the Second Circuit and -the Second Circuit
agreed that the indantur© had been complied -with but concluded
that the indentur® provisions with regard to notice to these
debenture'.' holders 'did not provide, as they said, "reasonable
notice,"

And said that these debenture holders were entitled

to recover the difference between the $100 and the $316,15,
They then sent the css© back.
Van Ge®art One,

That first appeal was known as

They sent the ©as© back, the District Court

9

entered a judgment for $3,283*359, which was taking the face v
amount of the debentures, $1,544,000, and multiplying it by
the $216 as to which each, ©f these people were entitled, and
said they were entitled to receive that amount of money if
claimed.

And that judgment provided specifically that each

member of the class who had not redeemed his debenture,upon
surrendering it would get $316 per debenture less his share
of the attorneys* fees required to collect this judgment.
How, if that judgment had stayed the way it was we
never would he here today.

We were satisfied with it as a

procedural matter and ready to proceed.
appealed a second time.

However, the plaintiffs

They were not happy.

And they raised

a very important, significant point that is involved in this
appeal hare at the present time.

They argued in the Second

Circuit that ’the people who claimed were entitled not only
to their own $216 over the $160 face amount but also fc© any
amount that was not their share of any amount -that was not
claimed by one of their fellow class members, called a fluid
class recovery.

And —

QUESTION^

Asa I right in thinking this is not •>*»

was not an opt in, opt out type of class action?
MR, GILLESPIE:
Relinquish.

You are quite right, Mr* Justice

This was 23 *»« 1 think it is 1 or 2

no right to opt out.

there was

That is quite right.

So they saade that argument to the Court of Appeals

10

for the Second Circuit, that they were entitled to get not s*
that $2,16 but whatever *— on top of that whatever anybody also
their share did not claim,
. The Court of Appeals struck that down.

They further

struck down a second request which was, -that oven if we-canBfc
get something for our pockets with regard to this, we at least
ought- to get .the attorneys1 fees paid from that unclaimed
portion as wall. . And the . Court of Appeals for the Second.
Circuit three-judge panel held, no, you are not ■‘'entitled to
■
,

j

Jr'

.

that because that itself would be an infringement on our
rejection in the Bison case of fch-e fluid ^recovery doctrine.
Furthermore, ©aid the court, that would he a violation of
>

the American rule on attorney^5 fees as propounded in the
Alyoska case because w@ would be taking money from — that
might go back to Boeing and using it to pay •••■■• help pay the
class members who do claim their attorneys* teas.

S© **~
QUESTION:

Mr. Gillespie, at that point, you just

said money that might g© bads to Boeing.
MR. GILLESPIEt
QUESTIONt

Yes.

1b it your position that my unclaimed

portion doe© in fact go back to Boeing?
MR» GILLESPIE:

St certainly is, Your Honor, but that

has not been decided as yet.
QUBSTZQMt

So that you would oppose any theory of

II

escheat*

MR» GILLESPIE:
QUESTIONt

We certainly would, Your Honor*

Let alone as to which State it would

escheat,
MR. GILLESPIE:

That would certainly be a tremendous

problem, but we would oppose that vigorously, Your Honor,
Now, when this decision was rendered by the Second
Circuit, my brethren here, did they petition for rehearing en
banc of that?

No.

Did they petition for review in this Court?

No.

That was -the decision.
It went back to the Southern District of New York
and lo and behold, the judgment — this was Van Geniert Two is
now cut of the way *»«* the judgment which was proposed to the
court followed the same procedure as previously with regard
to the $3,280,000 which it claimed these debenture holders
would get.
But then it went on mid said this:

tod it is

further ordered that the members of the plaintiffs* committe:
of attorneys b® awarded their fees and expenses and disburse­
ments as fixed by the court to be paid out of said total
amount of this judgment.
Now, we regarded -tills to be in direct violation of
what the Second Circuit had done in Van Gemerfc Two and, moreover,
we were astounded because at -that time the plaintiffs* attorneys

12

were asking for $2 million in counsel fees in this action.
So for tli.® first time The Boeing Company took an
appeal to the Second Circuit»

And when we went up there and

argued in that deal before the panel, the panel of three
judges agreed with us and said under our prior decision we sal;
there cannot be any respect for the «- or acquiescence in a
fluid class recovery and to allow the class members to get
something from the non-claimers -would be a violation of that.
And furthermore it would fo@ a violation of Aiyeska.
Petition for rehearing en banc for the first time
and, we get the decision 6 to 3. which is under review here»
/

Mow, before I proceed to give you'very quickly the
three reasons we think that decision en banc is wrong* I
want-to just report very briefly the status of the distribution
of this fund at, the present time,
0». July 8, 13??, just a few days following the
decision of Van Geraert Two, Boeing deposited in an escrow
account «« not a judgment but an escrow account *•- as established
.by the District Court’s judgment the $3,289,359 which I have
been,

referring to and $2,459,646 of pre-judgment interest,

which

combined sum together with other deposits currently

accruing interest is today over $7 million.

As a result of

published notices and two years of beating the drums and the
work of this able Special Master Mr. Solleder, 46 percent ©£
the fact amount of the debentures unconverted on March 29,

*66

13

have filed claims*

To date the remaining 54 percent of

potential claimants have either not been identified or having
been located, Mr* Chief Justice, have to date declined to
perfect their judgments,
QUESTION:

Now, 'let me gat that clear»

Is it 46

percent by number or 46 parcant fey amount?
MR. GILLESPIEt

By amount, Your Honor.

Forty-six

percent of the- face amount of the debentures which were not
converted and 54 percent which ware not converted have not
elaire®d, §4 percent.
QUESTION:

What were the fcenas of the escrow account?

MR. GILLESPIE:

It is just — well, I will —

»

QUESTION:

That question is suggested by my Brother

OXacJoaum’s ear liar question as to ~~
MR* GILLESPIE:
QUESTION:

Right,

«— there would foe ultimate escheat.

MR. GILLESPIE:

Well, -« just, one moment -- the

paragraph# Mr. Justice Stewart, of the judgment reads:

Ordered

that within 15 days after -the entry of this judgment the
defendant shall deposit the amount of this judgment, plus
interest at the rat® of S percent per annum to the date of
such deposit in a commercial bank, and so forth, upon which
interest shall accumulate until disbursed.

And that such

money shall be so held in escrow pending the further order
of this court*

14

Then in the final paragraph of the order, the
Special Master is given Instructions that he shall pass on
the validity ©r invalidity of the claims.
Now, w© say that that therefore leaves the unclaimed
funds up to further order of th® Court at a later time.
QUESTIONs

Of course it does speak of a judgment,

doesn't it*
MR* GILLESPIE:
a judgment*

It does, Your Honor; it does speak of

But after all, that is the judgment of liability

which, as 2 understand it, in class actions is preliminary to
whatever may be done by individual class members.
Now, without repeating here the arguments and the
analysis of authorities ~~ by the way, I would just say that
i

you can see that 46 and 54 percent of

$?

million, that the

funds that are being dealt with here are not de minimis.
Without repeating our arguments on the brief, there
are three principal reasons ‘that we believe -the Court of
appeals m bane was in error*
The most egregious error we believe is in the under­
lying premise which the majority advances to support its
/

stated desire to avoid, ©ad I quote, "unfairness to claiming
class members® and to permit them to enjoy, and I quote, "the
spoils of victory.®
Now, th© cpurt, which is its right to recognize:
those elements, by saying that its decision is sustained by

15

longstanding precedent,

Now, the two decisions of td

' Court

which the Court of Appeals rely on are Trustees v. Graenough
and Spragu© v. Ticpnie National Bank*

I air. sure Mr, Justie

White is familiar with these, because they sxe dealt with in
the Alyeska ease and the very question that was before the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was dealt with in that
opinion»
QUESTIONS

But that wasn’t the main question in

Alyeska.
MR, GILUBfjriHs

No, no.

But the contentions were

made -« and I have the briefs here, Your Honor —- that those
cases warranted the Court reaching a decision of imposing on
• the losing party the counsel fees.

And the Court rejected it

and explained th® corollary to the American rule of attorneys'
fees, that those cases erabody and limited it.

That corollary

is to th® effect that where a prevailing litigant has conferred
benefits on other parties that can be identified, that those
parties before participating in -the benefits of the litigation
must share their part of th® cost of the litigation.

This

corollary to th® American rule on lawyers' fees is founded
on th© common Ism principle against unjust enrichment.
In other words, if somebody — and it is on this very basis
that the claimants who com» into this case and collect -*»
the 45 percent who collect — must obviously pay their share
of the attorneys* fees, and with -that we have no question.

16

But that is the principle of those two cases that I jurst
mentioned* Sprague and the Trustees
QUESTION*

Greerough.

Mr. Gillespie, before you go on* and

perhaps this-has already been asked* but in your view Qf the
case will all the fund be distributed at the same time or will
the 48 percent get their share before other people make
claims?
HR. GILLESPIE:

Wall, Your Honor* I think that in

the first place wo hav® had two years when the effort to locate
these potential claimants has gone forward* claims have been
filed, they h&va been reviewed,

ted as the Special Master

reports in his little amicus brief* I/think of the claims
that have bean filed, X

not sure of .this* but there is

about 3G,000 which is still under review.

Now, as soon .as

this question has bean decided those will be paid off at one®,
ted then th© District Court has stated it will consider again
how much longer it will ©sxfcend —QUESTION*

Well* in other words th® 46 percent

would be paid before you knew for sure how many of tha 54 per­
eant world asms in.
MR. GILLESPIE:
QUESTION:

That is correct* Your Honor.

Now* what will -they b® paid?

Assume you

are right on fees and assum® say a certain percentage I take
it would b© withheld out of th© 46 parcent.
MR, GILLESPIE:

Well* no, I think what would bo done

17

is that the Court would determine what was a fair attorneys'
fees in this situation.

It would then assess against the

claiming class holders who cams in who are now there with
their 46 percent *»«*
QUESTION:

Right,

HR. GILLESPIE: -»*» and assess that against them,
QUESTIONs

All right,

HR, GILLESPIE:

And assume that —

If thereafter someone else comes in

and makes a claim, the same percentage as applied to each, of
the claiming ones previously would apply to 'the new claimant,
And the plaintiffs' attorneys would receive that percentage at
that time,
QUESTION:

So that your concept of the fee is not a

dollar figure but a percentage figure that would be based on
what is now available plus a guess as to how much more may
become of it,
IiR. GILLESPIE:
right. Your Honor»

Well. I don’t think -that is quit©

I think what the Court will do, it will

take that 46 percent and then they will say, what is it that
the plaintiffs’ attorneys are entitled to here based on their
services, the difficulty of the case, etc,
QUESTION:

Say they coma up with a figure of a million

dollars.
HR, GILLESPIE:
QUESTION:

Then that is applied —

And then you apply that across the board

18

of the 46 percent and say 'that amounts to 25 percent of each
person's «—
MR. GILLESPIE:
QUESTION:

Correct.

But then if more people come in, they

would get more than a million dollars in fees.
MR. GILLESPIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, they would, Your Honor.

So that the determination of a reasonable

fee would really be less than the amount they would actually
receive.
MR. GILLESPIE:

Well, I don't know whether the Court

would take that into consideration or not.

But the way the

Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit when it sent this back
in Van Gemert Two envisaged this being carried out was that
just as' I have explained to Your Honor at -this time.

And if

the plaintiffs* attorneys thereafter, if other people came in
and got the benefits of it, then they would owe the plaintiffs'
attorneys a fee.

And that fes would be measured as it had

been measured in the case of those who had previously claimed.
QUESTION:

But in essence the fee would really be

fixed as a percentage of the -MR. GILLESPIE:

X think as in all of this kind of

case that the percentage would certainly be a very important -QUESTION:

Hell, it is the sole criterion after the

order is entered, isn't it?
MR. GILLESPIE;

Well, unless as Your Honor suggested,

19

I think —- it is hard to say how the District Court will
actually do this determination,,

X think it is fair to say

that they will certainly give great weight to the services
rendered and then X think they will give weight to the result
achieved and thereby bring into effect a percentage which of
course would be the same percentage that was ultimately applie
on the other claims.

QUESTION:

With respect to this $128,000 you more or

less have seemingly at least waived their claims.

Can you tell

us from this record if we can find out if those are small
claims where people just didn’t v?ant to take the trouble,, or
what is the explanation?
HR. GILLESPIE:

Well, Your Honor, I — there is

nothing in the record with regard to this, I would say first.
But from ray considerable experience in this type of case
where claims are not filed, very often a potential claimant
has completed a tax year and does not want to go back and
reopen by reason of additional income the entire tax picture,
or has made some other arrangement.
QUESTION:

Well, I would infer from that then

that they were fairly modest amounts.
MR. GILLESPIE:
amounts, Your Honor.

I would think they were fairly modest

But it is $128,000 face amount of the

$1,544,090.
Well, now, I see just five minutes and I quickly say

20

there are three specific grounds which we urge —
QUESTION:

That five minutes is the five minutes

that you perhaps wanted to reserve for rebuttal»
MR. GILLESPIE:

I would like to reserve two minutes,

so I will get this off my chest in three minutes if I may,
Your Honor»

It is just so if any questions come up I could

be able to answer them after the Respondents have completed»
First, w® believe that the decision of the Court of
Appeals &n banc violates the common fund principle of Trustees
v. Greenough, as applied in Alyeska, in the opinion in
Alyeska»
Second, we believe that no judgment as far as an
individual is concerned comes into being until a claim is
filed, so that there is no common fund within -the principle
of those cases until a claim is filed»
And last, and most important,.we believe that any
decision which .encompasses using some of the unclaimed fund
to benefit the claiming members is a clear violation of what
la called the fluid class recovery, th® rule that if it. is
a small amount perhaps, it may be fairly large, but it is
allowing the claiming members, in effect, to benefit from those
who do nst claim from that fund»

And that has been liofc only

in the Eiaen case, in the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit »as that ruled out, but in this very case it was ruled
out

21

tod for these reasons, Your Honor, we believe that
this Court should reverse the ®n banc decision of the Second
Circuit.
Thank vou very much*
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Winer.

'ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN WINER, ESQ.,.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
HR. WINER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

' the Court:
,

.

Hay 2 begin by saying to you that Mr. Gillespie's

figures are somewhat out of date, not grossly, but as of last
Wednesday the claims filed amounted to 49.25 percent of the
original face amount of the bonds.

And may I add one other

statistic which is in my.brief, namely that 96.4 percent of
these bonds were redeemed by. Boeing and by the Special
Master.
QUESTION:

Mr. Winer, let me ask you the same

question —• or at least I think it is the save question Mr.
Justice Blaekmun asked your opponent, and that is:

What is

your position as to the disposition of the unclaimed funds?
MR. WINER:

Your Honor, my position must be in

accordance with the decisions of the courts up to new.

There

are decisions in the Third Circuit and in the Eighth Circuit
holding that the depositor of the amount of a judgment has
no right to reclaim the funds.

QUESTION t
MR. WINERi

Then what happens?
What happens must be escheat.

But this

has not been decided her© and was not decided in those two
cases in those words.
QUESTIONs

What I am asking is what your position as

a lawyer is.
MR. WINER:

My belief is, sir, is that they would

escheat^ th© funds would escheat.
QUESTIONS

Would it be your view the recipient-of the

escheats have been benefited by the services rendered.
MR. WINER:

Right, Your Honor.

I feel that the

recipient of the escheat would acquire the rights of the
parties whose money escheated.
QUESTIONS

Would not the same result take place if

it went back to Booing?
MR. WINER:

1 think perhaps it should.

should, yea, Your Honors, if it should.

I think ife

But there is no basis

which 2 cars find in law and no case cited in either, of the
briefs of Mr. Gillespie to the effect that the money goes! back
to Seeing.

He has made that assertion and I don't know

positively that it will escheat, so I wish to be cautious.
But in my opinion, sir, whether it goes back to Boeing or
whether it escheats to th© State, the recipiant of that money
should take it subject to the fees.
QUESTION:

If you take a position as to which State

23

it would escheat to *»*"
MR. WINER:

No, sir, that —

QUESTION:

the State of Washington would b® in here

in a hurry,
MR. WINER:

That is right.

That ia another question.

I should say to' you the State of New York is claiming
all ©f it.

They filed briefs in the Court of Appeals, they die.

not file a brief her®.
QUESTION:
MR. WINER:
QUESTION:
MR. WINER:

But the issue isn't before us just now.
Sir?
The issue is not before us.
No, sir? no, sir, and that is why I feel

— I don•t know the answer.

I know that the Third Circuit

said it escheats.
QUESTIONj

You can afford to be indifferent because

the lien follows, 1 suppose.
MR. WINER:
QUESTION:

Right, I feel that is so, sir.
Yet to & certain extent one can't decide

the basis’, on which attorneys' fees are to be recovered in a
:ase likes this without having soma feel for the disposition of
•the unclaimed funds.

It would be one thing to say that the

persons who claimed not only got what they were entitled to
but a portion of the unclaimed funds? and quite another thing
to say it is escheated, I would think.
MR. WINER;

Sir, wa do not think that the plaintiffs

24

are entitled to any part of the unclaimed funds.
QUESTION:

In ghat case, they hardly have standing

to be here, do they?
MR. MINERS
QUESTION:

2 doii81 know —
Aren't yon their lawyer?

MR. WINERs

I don *fc know whether they have standing

to foe here, sir, but I think that Boeing has no standing
hareP in my opinion.
QUESTIONS

Insofar as Part II of your brief that

point depends entirely upon the fact that Boeing has no further
interest in these funds.
MR. WINER?
QUESTION:

That is correct, sir.
That they will escheat or something else

will happen to thmn «*»
MR. MINER:
QUESTION:
MR, MINER:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.
— they will never come back to Boeing.
Absolutely.

And if --

So whether or not -they will escheat is a

factor in tills ease, isn't it?
MR. WINER:
QUESTION:

That could be & factor.
Because your whole Part II depends upon

that? I tliink, doesnEt it?
MR. WISER:

No, sir, I think not.

If I may develop

the point a bit, let m© put it to you this way.
Number one, the money paid by Boeing does not belong

to Boeing.

Therefore wherever it belongs, the claimants should

have the same right to pay only one fee father than two fees•
Let me put it to you this ways
of fees her©.

There is no shifting

Nobody has asked Boeing to pay on© cent ©ore-

than what it owes.

A shifting of fees as in England would be

if the plaintiff wins the fees of his counsel are thrust upc.,
the defendant and there is a shifting of fees.
QUESTION:

But there is a certain element of windfall.

It'is either a windfall to the plaintiffs3 'counsel or a windfall
to Boeing.
MR. WINER:

It may

if it should ever be determinet

:<>n some basis which has not been' vouchsafed that the money gees
back to Boeing, then it would surely be a windfall for Boeing.
Why Boeing, of all people, the on© that did the wrong?

ha

Mr. Gillespie talks., you may think that these innocent plaintiffs
did Boeing a wrong.

But the only wrongs done here ware by

Boeing and if the laoney goes bads to Boeing it would' surely be

k windfall of the worst sort.
Now, as *■*■=* sir?
QUESTIONi

Could you help sae with .the same question

X asked your opponent.
MR. WINER:
QUESTION:

Assume your view of the case prevails.
Yes* sir.

Is it not correct that we will reach a

point in time when your fees will be determined, they have not
yet been determined.

26

MR. WINER:
QUESTION:

That is correct, sir.
Mow, if the judge should determine whatever

a fair fee is, then hw would he pay it to you?

Would he pay

It in the same way that your opponent described, as a percentage
of the recovery?
MR. WINER;

According to a decision of the Court of

Appeals on that point it stated specifically that it would be
taken off the top as in Trustees v. Greenough.

The money

would come off the top and the consequence of that would be
that it would be allocated to each and every debenture ratably.
QUESTION:

In ©’idler words, you claim that the amount

of your fee should b© entirely unaffected by the estimate of
how ’much money will actually b© paid to former debenture
holders.
MR. WINER:

Yes, sir.

And conversely, I feel that

:nd‘ plaintiff should fo© required to pay two fees simply because
'other people havs not filed claims.
QUESTION:

But X don’t understand how anybody would

pay two fees.
MR. WINER;

Uhd<»r the American rule, sir, the victim

of a breach of contract must fo® a loser.

All he can get in

damages is what the Isa? says a victim of a breach of contract
is entitled to get.

So that when he pays one fee he cannot

com® out whole, he comas out with his righteous amount minus
a See.

How, if he is going to pay two — what in till3 case I

27

aia calling the 49.25 parcent a half

so if the people who

file half have to pay the total fee, they obtain double
fee.
Now, rnder the decisions of both the Second Circuit
and
QDSSTIOMs ■ The fee i® fissed.
SIR. WINES:

May 2 answer that.

How do you know that?'
In the Lindy case

in th® Third Circuit and -the Greenough case in the Second
Circuit th® court specifically rejected percentages of
recovery for fees,

They set up 12 different criterion, th®

hours spent, the quality of the work, -the difficulty of the
case, this, that and th® other? and among other things was
the amount of the recovery.

Well, X understand that point and 1 must

MR, WINER:

say that whether X didn’t go into the appealability of it but
X certainly argued that it was premature and X certainly do
think it is premature.

But it is here and apparently nobody «■=*

I argued there that it was premature but
And I am not sure -- I am not saying that

as from a point of view of appealability it is not final
because -this is a matter for argument.

But X am saying that I

think they should have waited until the fee was fixed and then
brought the whole thing her® at once, because? 'this case is
only 13*» 1/2 years old, and now when we go back and the fees are
fixed X don't know whether I will out live it.
QUESTION:

But it is possible that you could get a

higher fee if h© wins than if you do?
MR. WINER;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, it is possible.
What we are fighting about is that one

sf the factors that the judge will take into account wh©n he

30

ultimately reviews the 12 different factors you have described

and finally fisc a dollar amount,

That is what this case is

all ©hoist,
MU, WIHERs

Well, I haven•t thought of it that way

but X do not dispute that*•
QUESTION s

One thing you sayf you are here to

represent th© plaintiffs* are you not?

And yet you s&y one

thing to you is clear, and that is that each individual plaintiff
is not entitled to any overrides,
MR, WINERt

That is correct.

Nobody is entitled to

more than the amount ©f his judgment? and he has got to pay
out of Ills judgment a counsel fee, so he is going t© cos® out
with less,

'Sa* W1HER:.- We Ilf sir, the css© was decided in
Bison v. Carlisle & Jacqualin that there should be no fluid
recovery, undor no circumstances could a plaintiff got more

This Court remanded ©a entirely different ground but

it seemed to me approved that holding of the Second Circuit,
that there should be ao fluid recovery.
Now, if X my continue then with what X said ab©ut.

in

Professor Dawson of the Harvard Las? School

the Harvard Law Beview has written three articles cover­

ing -this stibjecfe very fully,

tod he takes -the view, or X

will quote hi s' words, to the effect that the question here
is distributing the loss, distributing the loss which
accrues to thee© plaintiffs by having to pay a fee to get
back fchsir money,

r

tod X think when it is presented in that way it
is a very clear and correct analysis,

What we have here is

a question of who is going to take the loss of paying &
counsel fee for getting back what was due to these people 13
years ago,
Again, X want to say to you that Mr, Gillespie in
going o’^er quickly the question of benefit and unjust enrich*»

meat and so cm has not quoted accurately os: fully* I should
say* the statera©nt of this Court in Trustees v. Greanough
which was when th® acting plaintiff recovered the judgment
for the benefit of th® class of bondholders * he said two
things.

H© said it would h@ unjust to the plaintiff if h® '

war© not reimbursed as well as enriching the other siesabsrs of:
th© class unjustly.
Mow* Mr. GtlXenpia has sos&e justification for
pounding only th® second part ©f that sentence* because the

what Greenough did was to follow th® ©Id English cases,,

in Alyeska the Court dealt both with th®

QUESTION:

to both of them, that they war© th© English rale and not th®

MR» WINER:

No, sirf 1 believe that the Court was

very careful and that th© statements in the footnotes where
these statements occur, where the only place oosann fund
and common benefit are put in the same sentencer is very
careful to distinguish the two.

E<m f tfoa Court did not say that there is no such
thing' ms a cosmon benefit»

In taking up for example the case

of Mills v. Electric Auto-Lit®, the Court did find that
there was a shared benefit and that ~~ you recall that in that
case stockholders brought suit fee enjoin a proposed merger
foetwees a company which owned 54 percent of the stock and

34

of the merge© ©ad that company.

Now#, in that ess© this

Court hold that although th@r© was a© specific fond th®
benefit was for the benefit ©f all — was granted to all
stockholders because they saved this corporation from a bad

merger.
Mow# that 2 belief is the first real common

finality ©f this judgment*
She judgment which is appealed from here first says
that the plaintiff shall recover their damages herein from
feh© defendants the principal sum of $3*289*359*

Then it goes

on and says* ordered that the members of the plaintiffs3
eomsatttoe be awarded their fee®* expenses and disbursements
'fired by the court to be paid out of said total amount of

■this judgment»
M«f w® wore £&md when w® saw that judgment vdfeh
the fact that unless -sm raised that point now this would be
final*

And when the time cams in as to where those monies

should corns from it would foe saying# well# yon never appealed
from this judgment*.
QUESTIONS
was not fixed*

•

-

Well# nonetheless the• amount ©£ ths* fees

So something remalhad to foe don© in the

District Court*

MR, GILLESPIEj

But still the determination of

where those fas© won liability and where those fees should
come from was imposed mi th© total fund which we claim# and
still dale* if unclaimed belongs to Boeing.

And as to that

45

extent it is final on -that issue „
QUESTIOH;

But there are lots of oases in which

~«• you know* bifurcated judgments — liability is determined
but damages ar@n*t„
MR. GILLESPIE:

Well* Justice R@hnqui.st* with due

respect on this issue the point -«■* -the clear point -that re
Loosds,- as ©£ this case have to pay part of the plaintiffs*'
attorney®*’ fess, whatever they may be fixed iat, in due
respect: we beliaw was final*

And if we didn’t raise it and'

bring it up w© would then bs told we wore bound. ..by that
determination*

Right or wrong* that was our position*

And

it ws® r®is©d in the Court of Appeals* not en &anr£> but
earlier? and the court took the position and- decided a r«ssP
the panel,
Thank you very much.
