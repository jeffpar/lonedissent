PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 78-1261, Carlson v. Green.
Mr, Geller, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, E3Q.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This ease arose after respondent’s son, Joseph
Jones, died in a prison hospital In Terre Haute, Indiana.
A year later, the respondent brought suit as administratrix
of Jones'

estate and as Jones’ next of kin alleging that

her sonfs death was the result of grossly inadequate and
inappropriate medical treatment In violation of the Eighth
Amendment prohibition of eruel and unusual punishment and
the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.
The respondent named as defendants the Director
of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Warden of the Terre
Haute Penitentiary, the Assistant Surgeon General, the
Chief Medical Officer cf the Terre Haute Prison Hospital,
the ---■
QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, perhaps Just as an ex­

midwesterner, it bothers me — it is pronounced Terre
Haute.

MR. GELLER:

Terre Haute.

Well,

1

don’t think i

intended to say it again, but thank you.
(Laughter)
Also named x<rere —
QUESTION:

Now you may.

MR. GELLER:

— a doctor’s aide and a hospital

guard at the Terre Haute Hospital.

All defendants were

sued in their individual as well as their official
capacities.
The respondent asked for $1.5 million in compen­
satory damages and $500,000 in punitive damages.

The

District Court in the Southern District of Indiana held
that respondent had sufficiently alleged a cause of
action for damages directly under the Eighth Amendment
under the theory of this Court’s decisions in Bivens and
Estelle v. Gamble, but it dismissed the complaint on
jurisdictional grounds.
The court held that under the particular facts
of this case, Indiana law limited respondent’s recovery
on account of her son’s death to the reasonable hospital
medical and burial expenses and expenses of administration
The court held that it was therefore apparent that
respondent could not satisfy the $10,000 jurisdictional
amount requirement for federal question jurisdiction
under 27 U.S.C. 1331

5
The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
reversed.

The Court of Appeals agreed with the District

Judge that the respondent had stated a Bivens type cause
of action for damages directly under the Eighth Amend­
ment j but it refused to apply the Indiana survival and
wrongful death provisions to this ease„
The Court of Appeals stated, "Whenever the
relevant state survival statute would abate a Bivens

type action brought against defendants whose conduct
results in death, the federal common law allows
survival of the action.”
I should add at this point, although I hope
to come back to it later, that while it is true that
by applying the Indiana survival statutes, respondent’s
claims would abate, that is because of the federal
jurisdictional amount in controversy requirement and
not because of any provisions of the Indiana statutes
themselves.
Wow, the petition in this case presents tv?o
independent questions:

The first is whether it is proper

for the courts to apply a Bivens type cause of action
directly under the Eighth Amendment in instances where
an existing federal statute, here the Federal Tort; Claims
Act, provides

an adequate federal damages remedy.

The second question, which need only be reached

6
i:? the Court disagrees with petitioners’ first point and
holds that an Eighth Amendment cause of action exists,
is whether the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that
the survival of respondent Bivens’ action is governed
by federal common law rather than by the state statutes
that apply to analogous cases.
I would like to turn first to the question of
implying a constitutional cause of action for damages
direclty under the Eighth Amendment- cruel and unusual
punishment clause in the circumstances of this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, before you do that, do

you question federal jurisdiction?
MR. GELLER:

Well, if the District Court is

correct — and we believe that it is — then the 110,000
amount in controversy requirement has not been met»
There is jurisdiction if that has been —QUESTION:

I am asking whether the government

is questioning federal jurisdiction in the case.
MR. GELLER:

Well, we are questioning federal

jurisdiction —• we are not questioning federal jurisdiction
in the Bell v. Hood sense, but we are saying that —QUESTION:

Are you arguing that there is no

jurisdictional —
MR. GELLER:
jurisdiction

We are arguing that there is no

in the federal court because the respondent

7
cannot reach., recovery cannot reach the $10,000 minimum.
QUESTION:

But do you then have to argue or do

you that punitive damages are not recoverable?
MR. GELLER:

Punitive damages are not recover-

able under the Indiana statute.
QUESTION:

Then does the jurisdictional issue

turn on the Indiana statute?
MR. GELLER:

We think it does turn on whether

you —
QUESTION:

If sos why do you then argue that

— why don’t you argue that first then?
MR. GELLER:

Weil, we don’t think you have to

— 1 would be happy to argue It first, but —
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t we reach the Jurisdictional

issue if we —
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

We don’t have to —
I am just trying to think it through

myself frankly whether we — under our normal practice
we will first decide jurisdiction and then decide cause
of action, I suppose.

You are arguing cause of action

first, I take it?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
And your second argument is i juris­

dictional argument I guess is really what I am asking you
MR. GELLER:

I think it could be phrased that

8
way because if federal law —
QUESTION:

I know it can be phrased that way,

but do you phrase it that way?
MR. GELLER:

We have not phrased it that way

but I think it could be phrased that way in the sense
that if state survival law rather than federal common
law survival remedy applies, then there is no federal
jurisdiction, but that is in some ways just a peculiarity
of this ease and I didn't want to make the case turn on
if and we have argued the question of whether the state
or federal survival law should apply to Bivens type
actions»

But that is an issue that the Court need not

reach unless there is a Bivens type action in this ease,
because if the action should proceed under the Tort
Claims Act —
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

I understand that.
-— then there Is federal juris­

diction.
QUESTION:

Under your presentation, we assume

for purposes of reaching the cause of action question that
there is federal jurisdiction.

Then If we disagree with

you on cause of action, we then secondly decide whether
we had jurisdiction to decide the first issue.
MR. GELLER:

Only in the sense that if you

decide on the second issue that state law applies, then

9
the case drops out because the $10,000 limit jurisdictional amount in controversy limit has not been satisfied.
The case could then proceed, however, in state court if
the Court were to decide on the first issue, that there
is a

Bivens cause of action rather than a Federal Tort

Claims Act remedy.
QUESTION:

Well, is it settled law that punitive

damages may not be included in computing the $10,000
j urisdictional amount?
HR. SELLER:

If law allows punitive damages to

be recovered, then they may be included in determining
i

whether the $10,000 limit has been reached if the complaint
states a claim that could fairly lead to the recovery of
punitive damages.
However, in this case if Indiana law governs
on the question of survival, it is clear that punitive
damages can't be recovered beeause it is not an element
of the damages that the statute allows.
QUESTION:

Yes, but if it is a Federal Tort

Claims action, are punitive damages allowable?
MR. GELLER:

No, not'under the Federal Tort

Claims Act.
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

In any event, it is not allowable.
Well, except that if you proceed

under the Tort Claims let, Mr. Justice Whit®, you don't

10

have to

you are not proceeding under section 1331 for

jurisdiction

and you don't have to meet the $10,000

amount in controversy requirement,

You are proceeding

under 13^6*
QUESTION;

Nevertheless you would be arguing

that punitive damages, the availability of punitive
damages doesn't militate against implying a cause of
action.
MR. GELLER:
correct.

Well, that's correct.

That's

We don’t think you can get punitive damages

— it is clear you can't get punitive damages under the
Tort Claims Act, and under the facts of this particular
case you can't get punitive damages under the Bivens
cause of action because that depends on the peculiarities
of Indiana survival law.
QUESTION:

But that —

I don’t know that your brother would

agree with you on that.
MR. GELLER:

Well, perhaps not but I think

the -—
QUESTION:

I would suppose that he would say

that a Bivens cause of action is not limited by the
Indiana provisions.
MR. GELLER:

Well, his argument is that a

Bivens cause of — the survival of a Bivens cause of
action is not limited by state law.

But if you reject

11
that notion and say it is governed by the satate law in
this case, I don’t think there is any dispute that the
Indiana statutes don’t allow —
QUESTION:

Not if we accept your argument, not

if you are right.
MR. GELLER:

Only if you accept the argument

that state rather than federal law applies.

If you

accept that argument, then I don’t think there is any
dispute between the parties that Indiana law doesn’t
allow for punitive damages In this situation.
Now, it is the petitioner’s position that the
Court should not create constitutional damage remedies
in situations where there exist a statutory remedy
available to fully compensate a plaintiff for his injuries.
In this case we think there can be little doubt and we
do not take, the respondent

-to dispute that respondent’s

allegations of grossly inadequately or even deliberately
indifferent medical mistreatment would state a curse of
action under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and that

I
complete compensatory relief and damages may be obtained
I

).

under the federal statute.
This Court has already held in United States
vl Munis that medical malpractice claims by federal
prisoners are within the PTCA.

We think that in uhese

circumstances the Court should remit plaintiffs such as

12
respondent to that existing federal statutory remedy,
rather than creating a remedy themselves.
QUESTION:

Did the government raise this point

before the Seventh Circuit?
MR. GELLER:
government did not.

No, Mr. Justice Eehnquist, the
We have stated as much in Footnote

9 of our brief.
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

Nor in the District Court?
Thatfs correct.

We acknowledge

that the Court has a rule that it will not normally
consider issues not raised below, but that is not an
inflexible or absolute rule and we have put forward
certain considerations in Footnote 9 which we think
should lead the Court in this case to confront the issue.
I should also add that respondents have joined
U£ in this suggested, they have not asked that the Court
dismiss the writ as improvidently granted and therefore
to the extent that the Court’s rule is based on notions
of fairness to the adverse party, not having new argu­
ments made that the adverse party has not had the chance
to confront, we don’t think those considerations apply
/
here. But we acknowledge and we acknowledge the first
opportunity we had after we learned of it that this
precise issue was not presented in the Seventh Circuit.
QUESTION:

The fact that it wasn't presented

13
wouldn't necessarily lead to the dismissal of the writ
as improperly granted.
MR. GELLER:
it might perhaps.

Well, as to the first question,

I mean the court has a rule that it

will not normally consider issues that were not raised
below.

It Is our position that that is a flexible rule

but should not be applied in this case.

We did raise

the second question unquestionably in the Seventh Circuit
and the Seventh Circuit reached the issue, and that is
properly here.
QUESTION:
HR. GELLER:

That is properly here.
That's correct.

That is correct.

Now, I think that the principal difference be­
tween the respondent and the petitioners on this point is
that respondent maintains that Bivens actions for damages
are a matter of "constitutional compulsion," and that
federal courts are automatically obliged to imply such
causes of action at least in the absence of an affirma­
tive and unequivocal statement by Congress that it intends
to make the particular statutory remedy exclusive.
We believe, on the other hand, that implication
of constitutional causes of action for damages are not
compelled nut rather are, as Justice Powell stated last
term In Davis v. Passman, the matter of principal judicial
discretion and that courts must take Into account a number

of considerations including the availability of statutory
relief in determining whether to exercise that discretion.
dow, the petitioner’s position on this point is
supported we believe by the very language of Bivens itself.
The Court's opinion in that case and Justice Harlan’s
concurring opinion each stressed that in the absence of a
Fourth Amendment cause of action for damages the plaintiff
would have had no effective means of redressing the of­
ficial wrongs he suffered.
Indeed, Justice Harlan specifically mentioned
that Congress had refused to waive the government’s im­
munity from suit for torts such as the one the plaintiff
in that case had alleged.

Where, however, there is, in

the Court’s words, another equally effective remedy, the

Court strongly suggested in Bivens that the judiciary
*

ought to refrain from formulating an additional cause of
action —■
QUESTION:

Didn't the Court refer to some ex­

plicit congressional directive?
MR. GELLER:

I think the explicitness came in,

explicit direction that there not be a cause of action
for damages, but I don't

and here there is in fact an

explicit statutory remedy, so the explicit -—
QUESTION:

I know, but no explicit statutory

directive that it be exclusive.

MR. GELLER:

Hos I don't think that the Court

discussed explicitness in the sense of exclusivity. Mr.
Justice White.

I think when the question is whether

a statute should be exclusive, I think the Court properly
must look to Congress for the answer.
QUESTION:

Was not Tort Claims Act exclusive in

the sense that no such remedy was available until 19^6
when the Act was passed?
MR. GELLER:

That’s correct, and no remedy for

intentional torts of the type involved in the Bivens case
was available until 197^QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

That is, against the United States.
Against the United States.
The Bivens case was not against the

United States.
MR. GELLER:

No. that’s true, it was against

the individual officer, although that was not until 1971.
But I think it is significant that every time —
QUESTION:

Nor is this case against the United

States.
MR. GELLER:

No, this case is against several

officers of the United States.

I think it is significant

that every time since Bivens that the Court has had
occasion to confront the Bivens issue, in Brown v. General
Services Administration, in Butz v. Economou, and in Davis

16
v. Passman, it is repeated the suggestion in Bivens that
it neither create or extend the constitutional right of
action for damages where there is an existing statutory
remedy.
In facts in Davis itself the Court stated in
at least five separate places in the opinion that plain4

tiff had no other federal damages remedy available to her
and therefore that the Fifth Amendment should provide one.
Therefore, if the Tort Claims Act is as we
believe an adequate substitute for a Bivens claim such as
the one respondent has alleged under the Eighth Amendment,
we think that this Court’s prior decisions lead to the
conclusion that the statutory remedy alone should be pur­
sued .
I would like to turn then to respondent’s argu­
ment that the Tort Claims Act is not an act which sub­
stitutes for an Eighth Amendment Bivens action.

Now, the

respondent has catalogued a number of differences between
the two types of actions, but in our view the relevant
question is not whether the Tort Claims Act constitutes a
remedy identical in every respect to that provided in
Bivens, but rather whether the federal statute can
adequately and fully compensate for victims of unlawful
government conduct such as that alleged in respondent’s
complaint.

17
We think that the answer to that question is
plainly yes.

The Court remarks in Carey v. Piphus that

the primary purpose of a constitutional damages action is
to provide monetary compensation to a plaintiff for his
injuries.

As I mentioned earlier, the Tort Claims Act

unquestionably covers medical malpractice in actions
brought by federal prisoners, and in light of the 197^
amendments it also now covers intentional torts by law
enforcement officers such as employees of the Bureau of
Prisons»
QUESTION:

But it does also, as you told us,

cover negligence actions, doesn't it?
MR. GELLER:

No, it says negligence or other

wrongful act or omission, I believe.
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

Right.
It is not limited to negligence.
No, it is not but it does — it is

brought enough to encompass and certainly does encompass
negligence.
MR. GELLER:

Absolutely, yes, and that was

the —
QUESTION:

And that was the query, whether a

constitutional claim under the Eighth Amendment would.
MR. GJELLER:
QUESTION:

Excuse me?
Perhaps it is questionable, is it

18
not, whether a claim under the Eighth and Fourteenth
Amendments would recover negligent wrongs.
HR. GELLER:

I think under Estelle v. Gamble

it is clear that negligence wouldn't fall under the
Eighth Amendments there has to be some allegation as
there is I think in this complaint of gross negligence.
QUESTION:

Historically hasn’t the Eighth

Amendment contemplated intentional cruel and unusual
conduct?
MR. GELLER:

Historically I think that is

correct, although in Estelle v. Gamble the Court said
it is addressed to the wanton, senseless infliction of
pain which normally one would think would be intentional.
There is an allegation in one of the latter clauses of
the complaint in this case of intent, but if you go down
the complaint it really states a claim essentially for
gross negligence.

The complaint is reprinted in the

appendix, essentially at pages 10 and 11, there are
allegations of not giving proper medication, inadequate
staffing of the hospital, use of a faulty respirator,
use of a wrong drug, lack of —
QUESTION:
count

Hew about page 13 of the appendix,

apparently paragraph 87 -- I gather all of the

paragraphs have been reprinted.
MR. GELLER:

Yes.

19
QUESTION:

~

20

"The above alleged actions of the

defendants were of a malicious and intentional nature
and manifest a deliberate indifference of requests for
essential treatment»”
MR. GELLER:

That was the paragraph to which I

referred a moment ago, Mr» Justice Rehnquist, saying
that at the very end ir.. the final count there is an alle­
gation which incorporates all the previous allegations
and essentially says ir. conclusory language that they
were done maliciously and intentionally»

But if you go

through the key portions of the complaint, which are
paragraphs 1 through l£, there are allegations of gross
negligence, negligence albeit of a gross nature»

It

seems to us clear that if the events that occurred in
this case had not occurred in a prison hospital with
federal doctors but they had occurred in a private hospital
with a private patient, the same exact events, there would
be no question that what would be brought is a tort suit
under a state negligence law, a malpractice law, and there
would be fully adequate remedy available to compensate the
plaintiff for his injuries.

There is no allegation here

that Indiana law is in any way deficient in allowing a
plaintiff to recover if' he has been the victim of mal­
practice such as has been alleged on pages 10 and 11 of
this complaint

21
But the respondent nonetheless points to a
number of features of the Tort Claims Act suit that she
claims makes the statutory remedy wholly inadequate„
Firstj she notes that the Tort Claims Act has an adminis­
trative exhaustion procedure and that Jury trials are not
available, but these differences we think really relate
to the procedures of adjudication and not to the fairness
or completeness of the compensation that may ultimately
be awarded to a successful litigant.

And I might add

that the same restrictions involving exhaustion of remedies
and the absence of a Jury trial are present under Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act, yet the Court in Brown v> General
Services Administration held that Title VII is an adequate
substitute for a Bivens action and for other statutory
remedies challenging racial discrimination under the Fifth
Amendment„
QUESTION:

Didn't the Court in Brown infer an

intent to make the remedy exclusive?
MR. GSLLER:

An intent on the part of Economou

to make the remedy exclusive of other statutes, that's
correct.

There is no -—
QUESTION:

Well, there was a proof of remedy

basis that —*
MR. SELLER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, but -You don't argu

that there is any

22
such intent here, do you?

There is no such evidence of a

similar congressional intent, is there?
MR. GELLER:

No, there isn't.

There isn't, al­

though we don't think that that is necessary.

The cause

of action, the Bivens cause of action was not created by
Congress, it was created —
QUESTION:

My question is only directed to your

reliance on the Brown case.
MR. GELLER:

Well, in Brown there was no separate

discussion in the Court’s opinion of the Fifth Amendment
claim.

The Court certainly did not say that the fact that

Congress meant to make Title VII exclusive of other statu­
tory remedies means that it should also be exclusive of a
constitutional remedy, although there was a constitutional
claim in Brown directly, a Bivens claim directly under the
Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Well, Congress may have intended to

make it exclusive of the constitutional claim and then the
question might be whether or not it could, nrhether or not
it could.
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Nonetheless, it might well have in­

tended to and I think, as I remember Brown •— I wrote it —*
I think 3: wrote that Congress intended to do so.
MR. GELLER:

Intended to make it exclusive of

23
other statutory —
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

Exclusive remedy —
That's right.
-- exclusive of all other statutory

and constitutional claims*,
MR. GELLER:

Well, the word "constitutional"

does not appear I believe in the opinion, but the Court
clearly made it clear in Brown that Congress did intend
to make Title VII exclusive remedy for racial discrimina­
tion in employment.
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

Right.
There is no similar legislative

history here with regard to Eighth Amendment Bivens claims
because the Tort Claims Act was, of course, passed well
before this Court's decision in Bivens„
Similarly., the fact that the Tort Claims Act
recognizes certain defenses, such as the due care defense,
does not destroy the effectiveness of the remedy because
these defenses are essentially equivalent we think to the
qualified immunity defense that ’would be available to a
federal officer in a Bivens action.
Finally, the respondent stresses the fact that
punitive damages are not available under the Tort Claims
Act, but punitive damages are not a form of compensation
and, as the Court held last term in the Faust case, they

are not an essential attribute of an effective remedial
scheme.
Moreover, while deterrence of official miscon­
duct is certainly an important goal, compensatory damages
serve to achieve that goal we think to a large extent.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Geller, what do you do

about that Senate committee report, or do I just misread
it, as recognising in 197*! certain intentional torts?
The report seems to think that it just adds another remedy
rather than eliminating what might have bean an existing
Bivens
QUESTION:

Well, I think there are a number of

things that can be said about the '7*! Senate report.
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

Give it your best shot.
I will.

The first thing that can

be said is that the Senate report was obviously referring
to' Fourth Amendment Bivens actions which, of cour se, at
that time the only type of Bivens action this Court had
recognised.

And in Bivens the Court said that tort

remedies were not an effective means of dealing with
Fourth Amendment violations because frequently
law

state tort-

was inconsistent with or even hostile to the interests

that -QUESTION:

So you would say at least that even

though the Federal Tort Claims Act would give remedy for

25
some constitutional torts, it wouldn’t necessarily preempt
implying a constitutional cause of action?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

Yes.
In those cases.
Yes, I think that first of all the

Senate report was only thinking about Fourth Amendment
actions and I think it is clear that to the extent we can
read anything into this one sentence in the Senate report
as being congressional intent, that they did not want —
QUESTION:

It is pretty clear that whatever kinds

of causes of action they were talking about -MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
—- there would be parallel remedies

there.
MR. GELLER:

The focus there was obviously on the

tort claim remedy that they were establishing at the time
under section 2680(h) for intentional torts.
QUESTION:

So at least Congress was recognizing

that the existence, the mere existence of a tort claims
remedy would not bar Bivens type remedy.

MR. GELLER:

I think that is correct.

However,

the —
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t that what you are arguing

—■ you are just arguing the reverse now.
MR. GELLER:

No, no, no.

We are arguing that

26
you needn't look to congressional intent, that the
Bivens action is a creation of this Court and that the
Court hasn't decided for itself whether there are ade­
quate statutory remedies available since —
QUESTION;

Well, assume it was a kind of cause

of action that you say the Senate report was talking
about, you say we wouldn't look to congressional intent?
MR. GELLER:

I think it would be one factor.

After all —
QUESTION:

We could If we wanted to just say,

sorry, Congress ~~
MR. GELLER:

I don't think there is any question

that the Court could.

It may not be wise, but if Congress

wants co create a Bivers cause of action it can easily do
so.
Now, the other thing to be said about the 197 J4
Senate report, Mr. Justice White, is that there is clearly
the suggestion, at least the understanding on the part of
the author of the report that Bivens was a constitutionally
compelled remedy, because on the same page of the Senate
report on which the sentence appears that you just read,
there Is the statement that in Bivens the Court held that
the Fourth Amendment requires the availability of a damages
action.
No\-f, to the extent that Congress thought that

27
Bivens actions were constitutionally required and that
Congress couldn’t abrogate them even if it wanted to, I
think the statement in the Senate report is merely an
attempt to avoid what might be viewed by some legislators
as a possible constitutional problem if it were thought that
the 2680(h)

remedy was intended to abrogate the Bivens

action.
But once again -we are not dealing with the 2688
claim here, it is not a tort such as Congress allowed to
be pursued under the Tort Claims Act for the first time in
197*1 s it is a negligence action which has alv/ays existed
under the Tort Claims Act and there is certainly no reason
to believe that Congress thought that the state laws
which were incorporated in the Tort Claims Act for negli­
gence or medical malpractice albeit of an egregious kind,
was not an adequate remedy and that therefore Bivens
actions would have to continue to be recognized despite
the adequacy of the statutory remedy.
QUESTION:

I thought when Mr. Justice Rehnquist

put the question to you, that you conceded, as I think
you must, that the complaint covers more in negligence
action.
MR. GELLER:

Yes.

There is no question that

ORAL ARGUMENT OP MICHAEL E. DEUTSCH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE RESPONDENT
MR. DEUTSCH:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay It please

My name is Michael Deutsch, and I am the

attorney for the respondent in this case.
The government urges before this Court two re­
lated theories which would provide no remedy at all for
the decedent in this ease, despite the serious deprivations
of the Bill of Rights that he has Sufferedc
It is imperative that the Court properly under­
stand the claims that we brought here.

We brought a claim

for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs
causing death»

This Court in Estelle v. Gamble held that

that claim in that language, and the District Court found
it and the Court of Appeals found it, created an Eighth
Amendment violation for cruel and unusual punishment.

It

recognised that this man, Joseph Jones, was in the custody
of the government»

He could not walk down the street and

get medical care, he had to rely on the government to give
him that medical care.

And when he went out to a private

hospital and the doctor there said transfer this nan to
another prison because he had asthma and the government
ignored that, and when the doctor

of the private hospital

said give this man medication for his asthma and the
government ignored that, and when the man,predictably had

30

a serious asthma attack and when he went to the hospital
for eight hours no doctor from the Bureau of Prisons
came to see him, and

when the respirator didn't work,

even though they knew for two weeks that it wasn’t work­
ing, and when they gave him Thorazine which killed him,
and that hospital, even though Thorazine is clearly
contra-indicated for asthma —* we say that is cruel and
unusual punishment,
And what Justice Marshall said in Estelle, in
the worst cases it causes torture and lingering death,
and that is what Joseph Jones suffered and that is what
we allege and that is what the courts below found, based
on the truth of the allegations in our complaint as the

court must take them to be true.
And we also claim that the government deprived
him of life without due process of law, a fifth Amendment
claim.

Clearly it is recognized as one under the Fifth

Amendment, as well as that deprivation was caused by
racial animus, another equal protection component of the
Fifth Amendment.
We do not allege medical malpractice.
not allege battery.
negligence theory.

We do

We do not allege any tort or any
We come here and we have come to the

federal court with a violation of a fundamental protection
of the Bill of Rights against federal officers in a federal

31
prison.
Now, I ask you, why doesn’t Bivens apply to
that claim?

Is not the Eighth and the Fifth Amendment an

independent limitation on the power of the federal govern­
ment?

Isn’t that what Bivens said?

Are there any special

factors counseling hesitation in this case?

Has Congress

explicitly said that Joe Jones should not get damages?
Is it —
QUESTION:

Suppose the federal tort claims

remedy was coextensive with whatever constitutional remedy
you could obtain, would you think that would be a factor
that the Court should take into account in determining
whether in any specific case a constitutional cause of
action should be implied?

It isn’t a question of whether

the Tort Claims Act is exclusive.

It Is a, question of

whether —
MR. DEUTSCK:
QUESTION:

It Is equally effective. Judge.

Well, it is a question of whether

in managing a judicially created cause of action it
should make a difference whether there is an adequate
remedy elsewhere.
MR. DEUTSCH:

I agree, it is a question of

whether there is an equally effective remedy for the
constitutional deprivation that Joe Jones —
QUESTION;

Well, if there was an adequate

32
remedy elsewhere, you just say you wouldn't be here any­
way, you wouldn't be wasting your time then.
MR. DEUTSCH:

We wouldn’t need to, we would

have an equally effective remedy for the deprivation of
constitutional rights.
QUESTION:

Why would we come?

Let’s assume that the statute of

limitations, suppose you hadn’t complied with the Federal
Tort Claims Act.
MR. DEUTSCH:

I would think that that would be

appropriate basis for the Court to say otherwise the
statutory scheme was equally effective and we wouldn’t
have anything to argue about.
QUESTION:

So it comes down here to whether or

not the differences between the remedies are sufficient
that the constitutional cause of action should exist any­
way .
MR. DEUTSCH:

Yes, but it really gets to a

fundamental question of what the purpose of the Tort
Claims Act is and how it operates.

It is not only the

specific regulations in the act, it is the whole ideology
behind the act.

The act itself makes you go to state law

to fill in all the aspects of your claim.

You go to

state lav? to determine your cause of action, you go to
state law to determine your damages, you go to state lav?
to determine whether the claim is —

33
QUESTION:

You just say that the Federal Tort

Claims Act could never be a decent remedy then?
MR. DEUTSCH:

I would say that for a constitu­

tional violation it is never an equally effective remedys
no, sir.
QUESTION:

Well, the Seventh Circuit said that

many courts of appeals had in Bivens types of actions
looked to state law for statutes of limitations principles
and that sort of thing, so that the Federal Tort Claims
Act isn’t peculiar in borrowing state law when it is
necessary.
MR. DEUTSCH:

Well, you can look to state law

to facilitate the policies behind the constitutional right
but if the state law is inconsistent or hostile you don’t
have to apply it.

In the Tort Claims Act, you have to

apply it whether or not it totally wipes out your claim.
In our ease, if we apply the Indiana state law
of survival, we have nc claim.
doesn’t have a claim at all.

Joe Jones is dead but he
That is not facilitating the

principles of the Constitution.
QUESTION:

Are you saying then that the borrow­

ing under a Bivens type of a claim, say of a statute of
limitations, you necessarily borrow the longest possible
ones because that "facilitates the claim," whereas if you
borrow a shorter statute of limitation it is "hostile" to

34
the claim?
MR. DEUTSCH:

Well, wait a minute.

The statute

of limitations I would maintain is a different question
because the statute of limitations, you are suppose to
bring to a case,, you don’t bring it and you are out, your
case is dismissed because of some kind of laches theory.
Now, if it is two years
QUESTION:

But that is hostile to your constitu­

tional claim.
MR. DEUTSCH:

Well, it is hostile but the liti­

gant* could have brought the claim within a certain period
of time and didn't.

I am talking about hostility where it

wipes the claim out.

Joe Jones could never bring a claim

for survival because Indiana law wipes it out.

That is

The statute of limitations is not a kind of

hostile state provision that -—

What is there that requires survival?

Survival is a matter of statute, isn't it?
QUESTION:

That is why I took Lord Campbell's

QUESTION:

There wasn't any survival until Lord

act to --

Campbell's act, was there?
MR. DEUTSCH:

Well, yes, but now I would sug­

gest to the Court, as the Court found in Moragne, which
created a federal common law wrongful death, but most

35
statutas have survival.
QUESTION:

Yes, but it is a matter of statute.

MR. DEUTSCH:

Yes, it is, Judge, but if you

look to the state statute and that statute is hostile to
your right to collect, deprivation of life, if the statute
wipes that out then your Fifth Amendment right is meaning­
less .
QUESTION:

Since you and I agree that it is a

matter of statute, what is there in the Constitution that
guarantees survival?
MR. DEUTSCH:
QUESTION:

There is nothing in —

Why is it hostile to the Constitution

not to have survival?
MR. DEUTSCH:

It is not a question of whether

it is hostile to the Constitution, it is a question of
whether when you are dealing with the federal constitutional right and a federal enclave against federal individuals,
and you look to state law and the state law is inconsistent
and hostile, whether or not you apply federal common law —
that is what Judge Swygert did in the Seventh Circuit
opinion, that is the question that is left open by
Robertson v. Wegmann, which says if the person dies as a
result of a constitutional deprivation, claim, you have
to facilitate that right.

You can’t look fco state law

when there is no state interest involved and it will wipe

Mr. Deutseh, can I ask you a question

It says the claim survives, but it says

that the only damages that can be recovered are burial
expenses and hospital expenses.
MR. DEUTSCH:
QUESTION:

No.

There are two statutes —

It is the wrongful death statute.

QUESTION:

Before you leave that, for just a

minute, what was Judge Nolan, what was he — he Is, of
course, an Indiana judge — what was his rationale for
his decision?
MR. DEUTSCH:

He applied both the wrongful

death and the survival statute —

He concluded, did he not, that as a

matter of Indiana law the claim survived but the only
damages recoverable were hospital expenses and burial
expenses and they didn’t come to $10,000.
MR. DEUTSCH:

Because he applied the wrongful

We —-

QUESTION:

He concluded as a matter of Indiana

law that the claim survived.
MR. DEUTSCH:
QUESTION:

Right, he did.

Right.

MR. DEUTSCH:

He assumed that he was bound by

Indiana law, he had to apply Indiana law,.
QUESTION:

But in construing Indiana law, he

found survivorship.
MR. DEUTSCH:
QUESTION:

He found —

And then he said the damages recover­

able as a matter of Indiana law don’t reach $10,000.
MR. DEUTSCH:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

Now, my question to you is is it not

38
possible that you have -separate questionss one, does the
action survive, and, secondly, if so what damages are re­
coverable,

And I suggest to you that possibly the first

question might be a matter of state law and the second
question might be a matter of federal law,
MR. DEUTSCH:

Well, if the action does survive

and the question is one of damages and it does survive
for Joseph Jones and then damages is a question, as Justice
White said in his dissent in Jones v. Hildebran, a ques­
tion of federal common law, and dontt apply the limitations,
that would be fine because you would be fashioning a
remedy which would facilitate the interests of the con­
stitutional rights that Joe Jones brings.
facilitate those interests.
QUESTION:

The idea is to

It is not to cut it off.

On the other, Judge Nolan may have

been wrong as a matter of federal law in saying that you
look to state law for survivorship but right as a matter
of federal law in determining the elements of damage.
MR. DEUTSCH:
QUESTION:

Well, I would —

In which ease you would lose,

MR. DEUTSCH:

Yes, but I would suggest that

Judge Nolan would be wrong in that because it wipes out
the claim that is brought for the violation of the con­
stitutional right.
QUESTION:

For example -—
Dc you concede that Judge Nolan was

39
correct if in Indiana law applied as to —
MR. DEUTSCH:

No, because we didn't bring a

claim for wrongful death.

This is Joseph Jones' estate.

The claim is for the deprivation of violation of Joseph
Jones’ constitutional rights.

Wrongful death is when

the survivors bring a claim for the violation of their
own rights c.
QUESTION:

Then you say Judge Nolan was wrong

as of Indiana law?
MR. DEUTSCH:

Yes, and Justice Swygert found

so, he clearly found sc, and Justice Swygert is a Justice
from Indiana, he knows the Indiana lav/ just as well as
Judge Nolan,
QUESTION:

Better, you say.

MR. DEUTSCH:

.

I do.

The United States says in its brief,

under Indiana law all causes of action survive,
MR. DEUTSCH:
false.

That's false.

That is absolutely

If the Court carefully reads the survival statute

ard the wrongful death statute in Justice Swygert’s
opinion, it will be clear that there is no survival
statute at all for claims where you die as a result of
them.
QUESTION:

I think there are two Indiana judges

on the panel. Judge Grant was also from Indiana.

MR. DEUTSCH:

That's right, Judge,

i want to

stress this point about the Federal Tort Claims Act be­
cause I *—
QUESTION:

None in the Solicitor General's

office, I take it.
MR. DEUTSCH:

Probably not.

The Federal Tort

Claims Act contention that the government raakes here is
so groundless and so specious that it is important for
the Court to really focus on because it is the very same
claim that Bivens made before this Court and it was re­
jected.
What did Bivens say?

Bivens said that -— the

government said in Bivens that this man has a cause of
action in state tort law, he should bring it there and it
should be like two private parties suing each other.
Court rejected that.

The

They said that it should be limited

to state fc ort remedies.
They say here and in Bivens that the government
conceded that every time someone sued in state court under
that theory they v;ould lose the court to federal court 0
So you have got a case under state tort law being
litigated In federal court.

That is what the Court re-

j ect ed in.Bivens.
Here we got s case of federal court under the
\

Tort Claims Act, we have to apply state lav; on every

single substantive issue and procedural issue.

Justice

Blackman, in his dissenting opinion in Robertson v, Wegmann,
specifically said that the state tort law policy is not
sufficient to protect the rights of disfavored groups.
The Court in Monroe v. Pape, in Bivens, in Davis have
consistently said state tort la.w is insufficient here.
That is the whole purpose of the Civil Rights Act, and
we are not going to say that to make stronger protections
for state officials5 violations of rights rather than
federal officials

Suppose we agree with you with

The damages are measured by the

damages to him, not the damages to his wife.

And I would

po.int out to the Court that Joe Jones has a mother, has a
father, has a sister and has a brother.

It Is not like he

has nobody that would take from his estate, and why
shouldn't he be able tc collect from his

estate?

QUESTION:

In my brother White’s hypothetical

casej that is an Indiana statute that says there shall be
survival of an action if there is a surviving widow and
only if there is a surviving widow, would the adequacy of
the state remedy depend upon whether or not there were a
surviving widow?
MR. DEUTSCH:

Yes, Judge.

If you would say you

had to go to state lav; —QUESTION:

No, no, under your submission, not

what I would —
MR. DEUTSCH:

Well, I would say you shouldn’t

go to state law unless it facilitates the interests in­
volved.
QUESTION:

In that case it would facilitate the

interests involved if I understand your argument.
MR. DEUTSCH:

Not if the claim abated, it

wouldn’t, if he didn’t have a wife —
QUESTION:

There would be survivorship if there

were a widow and in this case there is a widow.
MR. DEUTSCH:

No, I’m sorry. Judge, there is a

mother —
QUESTION:

No, no, in this hypothetical case

there is a widow.
MR. DEUTSCH:
QUESTION:

I see, yes, there would be —

So it would all depend upon whether

*!5
or not there were a widow.
MR, DEUTSCH;

Right.

If there were a widow in

the case., it would not abate, then I would say the state
law could facilitate the interests, yes.
QUESTION:

If not, then you would have to go

under a Bivens claim.
MR. DEUTSCH:

No, not a Bivens claim, a federal

common law of survivorship.

The Bivens claims —

Where does this common law of survivor™

ship come from?

QUESTION:

No, there is a difference between

MR. DEUTSCH:

Well, there can be common law

There are common law struc­

tures that promote the admiralty interests.
QUESTION:

Can you name one?

QUESTION:

Per years. In admiralty, you didn’t

have lawyers, you had proctors.

That was up until about

five years ago.

Or don’t you want to recognize that dis­

tinction?
MR. DEUTSCH:

Well, from that e&se, from the

Moragne case, several other courts of appeals have
fashioned federal common law of suvival in cases similar
to this*

They use that

case as a basis.

I recognize

that admiralty is different,
I would Just say to the Court, once you get be­
yond the fact that you are applying in

Tort Claims Act

state law in every instance, state law in all of the sub­
stantive issues.

Then you look at the act itself, and we

are talking about constitutional rights here.

Why should

he file a medical malpractice case when he has got an
Eighth Amendment claim?

They make you taks that claim

and put it forward as a medical malpractice case, he can3t
got a jury trial, and I would suggest that when we are
talking about the enforcement of civil rights it is neces­
sary tha.t you involve the public in that, a jury trial is
afforded to a Bivens plaintiff.

The immunities, there are

extra immunities under the Tort Claims Act.

For example,

there is a discretionary immunity which this Court specific­
ally rejected in Buts.

First of all, you immunize all

federal Individual officers.

They are immunised.

Then

the government in addition is immunized for all discretionary activities that they did.

All higher-up officials are

iramunzied under 2680(a).

So that is an additional im­

munity and it is a good faith immunity.
There is no punitive damages.

We are talking

about enforcing a constitutional right, compensation and
deterrence, compensation and punishments are fundamental,
have always been fundamental.
QUESTION:

Has there e\rer been a holding by

this Court that a Bivers type action necessarily requires
the allowance of punitive damages?
MR. DEUTSCH:

No, there hasn't,

which is a 1983 ease, leaves that open»

Carey v. Piphus
I would suggest

to the Court, if you.are talking about a case like this,
where a man in prison had no other alternative but wait
for his medical care and he never got even the most basic
medical care, there has to be some deterrence.

And what

is the ramifications of going under the Tort Claims Act
to other constitutional deprivations —
QUESTION:

Under the deterrence rationale, of

course, you have got a lot of different defendants here,
would you suggest that punitive damages is appropriate

If you tell us that we have no claim under the

What

QUESTION:

Don’t you think that there is some

deterrence factor that If this were a Federal Tort Claims
Act case and there were repeated gross negligence shown
that the deterrent would be the discipline and perhaps
dismissal of all the people involved?
MR. DEUTSCH:

Judge, that would be good.

That

would be a deterrence, but the Tort Claims Act is completely
silent on any disciplinary mechanism against the individual
who is responsible for the action.
QUESTION:

Very interestingly --

But you must be aware — perhaps you

are not — that sometimes military medical men have been
dismissed from the service after a Federal Tort Claims case
disclosed their negligent conduct.
MR. DEUTSCH:

That would be fine if that happened,

but first of all we wouldn’t even have a claim under the
Tort Claims Act in this case because our claim would abate
because we would have to apply state law.

So there would

MR. DUETSCH:

Yes* but under Indiana — Indiana

has an Indiana Medical Malpractice Act , so we would have
to convene a board of doctors first and we would have to
present our claim to the doctors, which we would still
have to do maybe.under the Tort Claims Act because we have
to apply the law of the place, and then we would have a
limitation, a monetary limitation on the amount of recovery.
We are caught in the vagaries of state law, the
limitations, the insufficiencies, and we are talking about
fundamental Bill of Rights, the protections of the Bill of
Rights to federal victims, victims of offenses of federal
officials.
Right now, Justice Burger, the government, the
Executive Department of the government, since 1973, has
been trying to get the Tort Claims Act to be the exclusive
remedy.

There have been three bills In Congress, Congress

has rejected them, and in order to get it passed the
government has made substantial concessions that they are
not in the Federal Tort Claims Act.

They agree to give

up qualified immunity, which exists now under the Tort
Claims Act, they have put in a strong disciplinary schedule
to punish people —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Counsel, you may

resume.
MR. DEUTSCH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have about five

minutes remaining.
MR. DEUTSCH:

Thank you, sir.

As to the question of Robertson v. Wegmann, the
subject of the survival in the ease was death caused by
an extraneous cause, not by the actual claim brought.

In

other words, the person didn’t die as a result of the
claim.

The claim was brought and the person died later on

and that question was left directly open.
Also, the Lousiana statute, which was the subj'ect of the survival case in Robertson allowed for many
people to bring the action, including parents.

So if we

were operating under the Louisiana statute here, Joe Jones
could bring a claim.

The problem with Indiana, nobody can

bring a survival claim.
QUESTION:

But the claim couldn’t be brought in

Robertson at all, could it, because there just didn’t
happen to be that kind of a person around.
MR. DEUTSCH:

Right, there was nobody.

But there

was a lot of different people who could have brought the

53
claim, including parents»
As to the question of congressional intent and
exclusivity, every time the Congress has wanted the PTCA
to be exclusive they have specifically stated in the act
of

in amendments — and I refer the Court to 28 U»S.C.

2679 ~~
QUESTION:

But that doesn't necessarily answer

the question of whether the Court should Imply a cause of
action.
MR. DEUTSCH:

v
No, not necessarily but it is

important to look to congressional intent to determine
whether -—
QUESTION:

And the other reason for not implying

it maybe, if they thought it should be exclusive, but it
is not the only reason for not having an implied action.
MR. DEUTSCH:

No.

I would think, whether there

is an equally effective remedy is the real question.

But

in talking about congressional intent, not only did they
specifically state so when they wanted it to be exclusive
as to a Bivens claim, the 197^ amendments specifically
recognises that Bivens -— it is a counterpart to Bivens,
and the Senate report specifically says that.
The other thing about congressional intent is
that Congress is in fact involved in negotiations with the
Justice Department about making it exclusive, and in the

course of that there are all kinds of broad changes being
made in the act so it will take up the question of deter™
rence and compensation.

Both the government and the

Congress have both agrees that as it exists now the
FTCA is not equally effective.
QUESTION:

You’ve spoken three or four times

about its being equally effective.

I assume you mean

would be the most productive in terms of the survivors,
is that what you mean?
MR. DEUTSCH:

I would say would create a remedy

that could redress the loss suffered by the decedent in
this case.
QUESTION:

Well, as a practical matter — and

I suppose this is anyone’s judgment —- wouldn’t a judgment
for, say, $50,000 against the United States government be
worth considerably more than a judgment in a

much larger

amount against four or five civil servants?
MR. DEUTSCH:

Well, it would maybe address the

question of compensation, but the question of deterrence
which is one of the twin goals of suing unier the Consti­
tution would not be accomplished because there is no de­
terrence to these men who have committed these violations
of citizens' constitutional rights.
The question of common law of survival, if the
Court looks at the Fifth Amendment, which says no one

55
shall be deprived of life without due process of law, how
else could someone sue for damage, for the deprivation of
life under the Fifth Amendment if there wasn't in effect
some recognition that there had to be some common law of
survival?

What you are saying, if you apply Indiana law,

is there is a constitutional violation if the person lives
but if the person dies there isn't.

That seems to fly

right into the face of the Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Of course, many statutes produce that

result, do they not?
MR. DEUTSCH:

Your Honor, probably, but when we

are talking about the enforcement of fundamental rights
under the Fifth and Eighth Amendments, I would think a
statute —
QUESTION:

Sometimes the rights, the difference

between the constitutional right and the statutory right
r

in all practical terms are virtually indistinguishable,
are they not?
MR. DEUTSCH:

That would be true, and 1983 cer­

tainly enforces the constitutional rights«,

But if we

don’t have such a statute here, we have a statute that
is based on state negligence law, and when we are talking
/

about enforcing constitutional rights it is not adequate.
I also address the Court to 28 U„S.C. 2576 of
the Tort Claims Act which recognizes that if you get a

56
recovery against the government you cannot sue against
the individual employee, which recognizes that they are
coexhisting remedies but you can’t get double recovery.
So if you go under the Tort Claims Act, you are precluded
from going against the individual employee which imports
of recognition you could choose either one, depending on
what you thought was 3rour interest in terms of deterrence
and compensation.
Two other points I would like to make -MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your time has expired,

Mr. Deutseh.
MR. DEUTSCH:

All right.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank ;you.
Do you have anything

further, Mr. Geller?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, E3Q.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL
MR. GELLER:

One point, Mr. Chief Justice.

The situation In this case is not at all like
Bivens.

In Bivens, there was absolutely no federal remedy

because Congress hadn’t amended the Tort Claims Act yet to
include intentional torts.
Secondly, the Court said in Bivens that state
treaspass and invasion of privacy laws were not adequate
to compensate victims of Fourth Amendment violations be­
cause such state laws were often inconsistent or even

57
hostile to the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment.
The respondent here has never alleged much less
shown why state malpractice laws are not adequate to com­
pensate for the sorts of violations and injuries that oc­
curred here.
QUESTION:

Well, that was a great deal of the

thrust of his argument this morning.
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

I don't —
What do you means he never alleged it?
I don't believe he —
That is what he was referring to all

morning.
MR. GELLER:

I don't believe that the respondent

has shown what in Indiana in the peculiarities of Indiana
malpractice law prevents full compensation for the sorts
of injuries alleged in the complaint.

We think that this

is the sort of a case that the Court had in mind in Carey
v. Piphus when it said that in some cases the interests
protected by a particular branch of the common law of
torts may parallel closely the interests protected by a
particular constitutional right.

Here we think there is

that parallel and therefore we don't think the Court
should extend the implied constitutional damages action
of Bivens a
QUESTION:

Mr, Geller, do you think the implied

58
Bivens type constitutional remedy survived the enactment
of the amendment of the Federal Tort Claims Act, made
that type suit available —
MR. GELLER:

You mean Bivens, the actual Bivens

sort of action?
QUESTION:
MR, GELLER:

Yes, the Bivens itself.
Yes, that is a question I think

quite similar to the one Mr. Justice White asked me.

I

think our argument if accepted might lead to that result
but it needn’t because of what I just said, the state laws
that would be picked up in the Tort Claims Act to cover
treaspasses or the sorts of invasions in Bivens.

The

Court said in Bivens were not adequate frequently to
protect the Fourth Amendment interests at stake, and I
think this might have been what Congress had in. mind in
the legislative history of the 5 7^4 amendments.
QUESTION:

Mr. Seller, suppose there had been

no Federal Tort Claims Act and there was a Bivens action
brought, would you argue that just the existence of a mal­
practice remedy in Indiana would foreclose a -MR. GELLER:

No.

No, there has to be we think

a federal remedy.
QUESTION:

There has to be an alternative remedy

under federal lav;.
MR. GELLER:

Absolutely, that is our position,

59
and there is here,
QUESTION:

Why, pray tell?

MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

Because this is a federal —
There is an adequate remedy under

state law, then why would you imply one?
MR. GELLER:

It is a federal constitutional

right and we think that people who have that right violated
should be entitled to a remedy in federal court.

That was

what —
QUESTION:

The only remedy under the Federal

Tort Claims Act is going to be by reference to the Indiana
law.
MR. GELLER:

But that is what Congress has chosen

to do, but it is still a federal remedy.
QUESTION:

Well, you say then that your own

client ought to be suable.
MR. GELLER:

Congress we think has made that

judgment in cases like this, that’s correct, and ve don’t
think in that situation there is any need for this Court
to extend the implied constitutional damage action that
it recognized in Bivens.
QUESTION:

Extend it, you mean extend it to this

case?
MR. GELLER:
there is an adequate —/

Extend it to a situation where

60
QUESTION:

A case by another name, is that what

you mean by extending it?
MR. GELLER:

Extend it to a situation that

didn’t exist in Bivens which is that where there is a
federal statutory remedy that is fully adequate0
«

Thank you very much.
