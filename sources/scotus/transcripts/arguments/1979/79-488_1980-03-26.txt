ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE9 ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:
Just before the Court rose yesterdays Ms1.
Justice Marshall asked me what would be wrong with our
haying to comply with Rule 23 In suits In which make
whole relief is sought as well as injunctive relief,
Basically there would be three things that would be
wrong with this.

They are somewhat interrelated.

The first 1b there is no reason to think•that
Congress intended so sharp a change from the traditional
practice in suits by the government or its agencies.
Not only was Congress presumably familiar with the
pattern of government litigation under many other
■statutes, but there had indeed been 69 suits filed, by
the Attorney General between 1964 and 1972 under
section 70? of this act, some of which had sought relief
that would benefit a class of persons such as preferen­
tial hiring order, constructive seniority and the like.

30
and Ar none of those cases had It ever been suggested by
anyone that Kule 23 procedures need be used and —
QUESTION:

How many of those involved claims

for monetary relief?
MR,, WALLACE:

Hone of them up until 1972 dids

although some decided shortly thereafter did. include
clAlms for monetary relief»

The legislative history

indicates that the newly authorized governmental suits
under section 706 were to be assimilated to the section
70/ suits to the point where the sponsors of the legis­
lation said section 707 would essentially become a re­
dundancy in the law end that everything could be accomp­
lished under section ?06 that previously could be accomp­
lished only under section 707»
QUESTION:

Well, would that same be true

v±:'e versa that everything could be accomplished under
707 that could be accomplished under 706?
MR* WALLACE:

Providing the pattern of prac­

tice criterion could be met which is required to bring
a l07 suit and get relief, which is not required under
70 So
QUESTION:

The two were “-virtually interchange­

able in the view of the sponsors except for that quality?
MR* WALLACE:

Except for that quality9 as far

as we can see in the legislative history.

31
QUESTION:

Then why did the sponsors want 706?

MR,. WALLACE:

The government to be able to sue

under 706 aa well as 7077

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WALLACE:

Apparently it was the idea that

the commission would be cease the primary enforcement
mechanism and that there would b® —• that th© law would
be enforced primarily by government-a 1 suits rather than
privats suits and that the government should not have to
sue only in pattern or practice cases.

Even though if

one taies a generous enough view- of pattern or practices
most cases could be sit into th® pattern or practice
terminology, but not all cases.
predominant thinking.

That seemed to be the?

I think it was really part of

the cc «promise between those who thought that the earnmiuslcn should have the cease and desist authority and
those xho thought that court enforcement should continue
to be the method of enforcement , but that the commission

would have the responsibility of bringing most of the
court cases.,
The second thing that would be wrong with
thisa 3rd this cuts it seems to me a little more deeply
into the case, is that it would cast the government in

an inappropriate role in enforcement of the statute, and
in some ways this Is among the most important things

32
about the Court's opinion In this case9 the role to he
envisioned for the government in the enforcement of Title
VII.
The commission and the Attorney General have
never understood that role to ba the role of a proxy for
individual complainants or for any particular class of
personst and there is no lawyer-client relationship
established with any particular group of persons as
there is in the statutes that we discussed yesterday9
where possibly the government could bring a class action
where it is serving as a lawyer for particular individuals.
The commission’s assignment .and the Attorney
General's assignment in the cases that they are to bring
or he is to bring is to enforce the law rather than to
act or. behalf of any individuals.

This is indicated on

the face of the statute itself9 which is section 706 is
set forth on page A3*J of the appendix to the petition
for certiorarij anci it starts off saying the commission
is empo"-. erei as hereafter provided to prevent any person
from engaging in any unlawful

employment practice as

set forth in the other provisions, not to represent any
group of individuals, and there are other references
that

re consistent with this view of the government’s

role in enforcement.
them.

I want to refer to only one of

33
On page A~37s in section (f)(1) there, .it says,
”If within thirty days,” et cetera, ”the Commission has
been unable to secure from the respondent a conciliation
agreement acceptable to the Commission, the Commission
may bring a civil action.».”

The responsibility is to

see to it that the law is enforced»

If the commission

is satisfied that the agreement properly implements the
law, there is no obligation to any particular group or
class of persons to make sure that they are satisfied.
Of course, if they won*t agree to the agreement,
there might be litigation in any event, but the commis­
si on would not have the responsibility to conduct that
litigation.
QUESTION:

What about an action by the adminis­

trator of the Pair Labor Standards Act, would —
MR, WALLACE:

It is really a similar responsi­

bility to enforce the law.
QUESTION:

Could he bring a class action?

MR, WALLACE:
have tael to.

It happens that in —

They never have.

They never

It has always been, the practice has

always been that they have statutory authority to seek
the relief for — to see to it that the law is complied
with and that those who have been denied proper wages
are made whole.

It is part of the statutory authority.

There never has been the use of Rule 23 in those cases.

34
Those eases don’t present some of the complexi­
ties tmd considerations and the possibilities for di­
vergence of the public interest from private interests
that fire involved in Title VII.

The standards are very

clear under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

It is almost

or..ee you’ve acne your factual investigation, it is almost
a mathematical exercise.
Title VII is very different from that.

Even

if one takes a rather one-sided view of the government’s
enforcement responsibilities, if you pose an example of
getting rightful place seniority relief under this
Court’s decision in Franks v. Bowman Transportation
Company, for example, the question is who is entitled
to that rightful place in seniority relief in many
situationss what classes of employees.

If it can be

secured only for a particular racial group, that is
more advantageous to the members of that class than
if it is broadened to include other ethnic os5 gender
group a..
On the ether hand, if it isn’t broadened to
include these other groups, they are being disadvant­
aged by the granting of it to the first group.

There

are strains here, there are possibilities of competi­
tion among claimants so that the commission would be
embarked on a treacherous course if if thought of its

35
role a$ anything other than seeing to it that the law is
properly enforced.

If it thought of itself as to be cast

In tne role ox’ a representative for any particular group
and •—
QUESTION:

What if it thought the law wasn’t

being properly enforced, why can't it- gain everything it
wants by a simple injunction?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, there is make whole relief

and part of what the legislative history x’efleeted. was
that the commission was to be able to get broader based
relief and more comprehensive relief, similar to the re­
lief that had been secured in class actions brought by
private individuals theretofore under section 70S, even
though for- other purposes the action by the commission or
•t

the Attorney General was to be assimilated to the familiar
kind of action under 707.
The example that I have given is really two
one-dimensional examples because Title VII protects the
rights of all persons not to be discriminated against
on true basis of their race and their sex or their sex or
the other classifications, and while the commission,
the- United States are of course committed to an effective
enforcement policy of putting an end to discrimination
wherever it is found, to finding effective remedies to
make whc le the victims of discrimination and. to prevent

36
its reoccurrence,
As this Court is well aware, sometimes remedies
can be excessive»

Sometimes this Court has found remedies

that we have contended for to be excessive, and they can
In extreme cases become an instrument that treats other
unfairly, an instrument of discrimination in themselves.
\

And when the United States or the commission brings Its
weight and its resources into the enforcement of this law,
it must be with an awareness of all of the rights that
will be affected., including other rights that were re­
spected under Title VIIs collective bargaining rights,
managerial prerogatives, and the like.

It must not ap­

proach these cases with & one-dimensional view that it
Is serving only as a representative of a particular
class of individuals»

That to us is at the heart of this

case and that :1s our understanding of the way Congress
expected governmental authorities to carry out their re­
sponsibilities under this statute, just as they do under
any other statute®

It is a law enforcement responsibility.

And this element of detachment of the commis­
sion or of the Attorney General from the particular in­
terests Involved is reflected in many details of practice
under the act.

The commission need not include all of the

issues raised by a. charging party in its suit, if it
concludes that some of them are without merit, and it is

37
not Halted to the issues raised by the charging party or
even to the interests that the charging party represents
because the failure to include the interests of others
found to be victims of this discrimination might result
in the suit working to their detriment in some cireusa-*
stances actually„ and the commission’s responsibility is
to enforce the law in a more comprehensive manner.
Moreover* the charging party is not bound when
the commission thinks there is no merit in the charge at
all and refuses to bring suit.

#he charging party ©an

still bring a suito

Of course* the problem doesn't arise

unless a suit is brought and that is -—

Oh.

Well* I haven’t gotten to it yet.
I wanted to make sure X hadn’t

Okay.
MR. WALLACE:

My second one ran out and — the

third reason* Hr. Justice* is that Rale 23 doesn’t fit
the situation as the terms of Rule 23 are ordinarily
understood.

The rule would really have to be distorted

considerably to be applied here.

The commission is not

an employee of General Telephone Company of the Northwest*

3B
nor :ia It an association of such employees,

It is not con­

trolled by those employees-

It is not bound to represent

their interests in any way,

Its responsibilities, its

claims in this ease are not typical of any class.

And in

Ugh; of its law enfo-rc@jB.ent responsibilities and responsi­
bilities to other categories of the public, there are
difficulties in saying —
QUESTION:

Well, Isn’t that an argument as to

why it shouldn’t bring a class action?
MR, WALLACE:

Well, I think If one thing emerges

with clarity from the legislative history It is that
Congress intended that in actions by the commission and
by tie Attorney General, all. of the relief that had here­
tofore been available In class actions by individuals
would be available.
The whole effort in 1972 was to make enforcement
more effective and to make the commission and the Attorney
General the primary enforcement mechanism.
QUESTION:

But the fair labor standards adminis­

trator has the right to seek back wages for people who
have been discriminated againstt too, doesn’t he?
MR, WALLACE:

That is correct, without having

to comply with Rule 23, and that is exactly the analogy
we think is here.
QUESTION:

But he doesn’t call It a class

39
action.
MR. WALLACE;

And neither do we.

It is cm3.y the

Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that has called It
a class action and said that we have to comply with Rule
23QUESTIOW;

Isn’t this in a sense much ado about

nothing then?
MR, WALLACE:

Well9 I think there can be a great

deal of litigation stimulated by the question of whether
Rule 23 has been complied with.

As the Court is familiar

with its own cases, there can be a great deal that is
another layer of litigation added to these eases if —
QUESTION;

Well, how would the opting out pro­

cess go, applying Rule 23 here?
MR, WALLACE:

We have considerable difficulty

seeing how it would operate.

As far as we are aware.- no

one is bound in the first place.

Part of the contention

being made here is that all individuals should be bound,
and that is the reason to make it a. class action, but
that in itself seems to us inconsistent with the way
Congress has set up the statute.
As I just mentioned, no one is bound by the
fact that the commission decides that there is no merit
at all in their claim, why should they be bound by a
settlement the commission would reach.

Of course, if —-

QUESTION:

Has the government ever brought a

claim that denominated a class action under the Fair Labor
Standards Act?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Not that I am aware of.

Is it your position, Mr. Wallace,

that the commission could not bring a class action even if

42
it wanted to?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

This Court said is the way —-

Well, what is your position?

I am not

asking you about ours, I*m asking you about yours„
MR. WALLACE:

We have attempted to biding them

in the Fifth Circuit since the D. H. Holmes decision.

It

is not an easy matter.
QUESTION:

What is your position here in argu­

ment before this Court, that the commission cannot bring a
class action?
MR* WALLACE:

We would not take that position.

If in orier to get the relief that Congress contemplated
in the 1972 act we had to proceed under Rule 23 and had
no other option under this Court5 a decisions, we would
proceed under Rule 23 6.3 be&t we could.
QUESTION:

But your position in argument; here
. -If)

is that the commission cannot bring a class action suit
under Rule 23, is it?
MR. WALLACE:

It is that it would be inappro­

priate, but I wouldnTt take the position that it cannot
because if we are forced to in order to effectuate the
congressional policy that the commission get this relief
as the primary enforcement tool, we will do it.

MR, WALLACE:

QUESTION:

You say it is a wholly inappropriate

thing, it is unworkable, that Rule 23 clearly is not de­
signed for this sort of an action on the part of th@ commission, and yet you say the commission can bring a class

MR, WALLACE:

I am only saying that if we are

required to we will try to proceed that way.
QUESTION;

But you are arguing —

MR. WALLACE:

There are many difficulties -~

You are arguing before us that you

MR. WALLACE:. That we are not required to and
that it is inappropriate.

And is it part of your argument

that the commission cannot do it -- you say no, it is not,
MR, WALLACE:
Mr. Justice.

I don’t think we can go that far,

Even if you went that far and this

We would comply.

But you had just been told you were

QUESTION:

Well, we see great difficulty.

So I donffc know why you don't Just

say your position is that you can’t bring it, because if
we disagree with you, you can.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, we have been trying to do

it in the Fifth Circuit, but it is hard for me to stand
here and say that our* position is we canit.
QUESTION:

It is our rule ..as well as Congress'

rule,
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But you say the Fifth Circuit decision

is entirely wrong.
MR.. WALLACE:

Yes, and we rill certainly discon­

tinue that practice should this Court agree with our posi­
tion.

We do think it is wrong.
QUESTION:

And yet you

MR. WALLACE:

say

you can do it.

¥e are trying to»

We don't fit

’/ary well into any of the provisions of Rule 23- ' An amicus
supporting us in this Court argues that we can't be a
proper representative of the»..

There are many reasons why

a class of claimants could feel uncomfortable with us as
their representative in a class action.

For one thing,

our position in Title VII litigation can't be unaffected
by fee fact that the government is often a defendant in
Title VII suitso

The commission does have responsibility

*55
to enforce Title VII within the government.

The Solicitor

General has a responsibility to defend the government in
such eases before this Court.
Gur attitude about the us® of civil service
examinations in the states has to be affected by the
similarity of the use of civil service examinations in
the federal government and the fact that many of these
examinations have been developed with help from the federal
government.
We may have reason to think that Congress ap­
proves of the merit system of employment and would want
Title VII reconciled with that approach to governmental
employment, but there are people who disagree with us on
this.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallaces after a lawsuit has

been filed and you’ve cade all the decisions that enforce­
ment is appropriate, in a ease such as the one before us.
Is It the practice of the EEOC to give notice to the
persons for whom it seeks monetary relief?
MR* WALLACE:

I don’t think there is a practice

to give 3omprehensive notice.

Very often the word gets

around —
QUESTION:

I understand,

MR. WALLACE:

— and the charging party would

know and his representatives, sometimes union people are

involved in civil rights organisationss but there is not a
systematic notice given to all persons.
QUESTION:

But in your response to Mr. Justice

Marshall, as I understand it, your three points is that
Congress didn’t intend It, it is inappropriate for the
government, and third, the language of Rule 23 and the
concept of Rule 23 just doesn’t fit.

But you don’t argue

that there would b© any special burden on th® government
of compliance?
MR» WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Weil, I think it would —

You could include that as one of your

three points,
MR. WALLACE:

Right.

As we understand it, there

I understand that, but you don’t give

as an answer to Mr* Justice Marshall — Mr. Justice
Marshall asked you, as a practical matter, what difference
it would make, and you gave three legal answers, but yon
didn’t say anything about any burden on the government
to file.
QUESTION:

Well, as a practical matter, it will

create a burden on the litigation itself.

It will encumber

Title VII litigation with a lot of issues about acequasy
of representation typicality, whether you are really a
member of the group, and all the rest of this, would

becoae bones of contention in the litigation.

It will

Not as I understand your opponentrs

If I understand him correctly„ he says that you

can enlarge the class beyond the typicality requirement
that would be appropriate if the specific charging parties
were the class representatives, that you are not so
limitedo

So it- doesn’t seeaa to me you really are going

to hive m»eh of a typicality problem,.

The problem rather*

as I understand* would be for you to give notice of the
people that you intend to include within the perimeters
of the litigation and so the Judge will know and every­
body will know who is hound* and that is about all there
is t 3 It „
MR. WALLACE:

Well* there could be contentione

about adequacy of representation, but not made by the
defendant ordinarily

Well, I would think that it would be

pretty hard to claim that the government doesn’t represent
them adequately.
MR. WALLACE:

This is really an amendment of

And if the Court were to say that, it wouldn’t be

a meaningful thing to call It a Rule 23 suit.

That is the thing they are seeking to

accomplish, and I don’t really see why that is such a
terrible suggestion,
MR. WALLACE:

Well, it might sake it easier for

the commission to negotiate settlements if they could

But we

recogni e that but we don’t think that that is the role
that Congress ;i3sig;ns& to the commission ~~
QUESTION:

I understand.

MR. WALLACE:

— that there is reason enough

that people should be bound or that the difficulties as
a practical matter are such that the law should be
stretched in this direction.
We have mentioned in the last two•or three pages
of cur brief why as a practical matter duplication of
litigation is unlikely to occur, certainly because all the
relief is equitable in nature and there won't be double
remedies of any kind.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP JAMES R. DICKENS» ESQ.»
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS—-RBBUTAAL
MRa DICKENS:
QUESTION:

Yes» Your Honor.

Mr. Dickens, before you start. I am

interested In the Basse subject that Mr. Stevens has been
pursuing» the risk of duplicative litigation.

The govern­

ment's brief says on page 35 at the top that the risk of
duplicating litigation can be minimized by the exercise
of the District Court's equitable powers under 706(g).
MR, DICKENS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor —

I would like to hear you discuss

that3 and you have cited a number of cases in your brief.
What ban been the actual experience?
MR. DICKENS:

four Honor» let me just give' the

Court the closest analogy I can.

The AT&T consent decree

was probably what prompted this litigation.

This; I think

The government, the EEOC

and the AT Self entered Into a consent decree in the Third

There was no binding effect upon anyone else.

They wore not

They were entitled to bring their own actions.

So you had a multiplicity of litigation which we are try­
ing to avoid.
We have had a couple of questions about the Fair
Labor Standards Act.
unique statute.

That is a red herring.

That is a

Congress recognized in that situation

that Rule 23 would apply unless it made an exception.
Congress did this:

To file a private action under the

Fair Labor Standards Act* you have to file a written con­
sent,

Rule 23-type actions are not permitted.
So the only people bound are those who file a

written consent* and the only people who get relief are
those; who file a -written consent to be a party plaintiff.
If the government brings a Fair Labor Standards
■ease* the private right of action is terminated,
is no further private right of action.

There

So we have in the

Fair Lab rr Standards Act what we are asking for here* we
want some finality.
QUESTION:

We want to resolve litigation.
Well* what can a court of equity do

if an employee declines to take the sward that is';avail­
able to him and decides he wants to bring a suit?
MR. DICKENS:

Your Honor, section 706(e) really

refers t > the remedy and there is no question that because
of the type of situation we have* we are talking about in

51
luany cases you cannot Just give an award of back pay.

We

believe that 706(c) was drafted to provide for the remedy
and not for the procedure.

The Court may say* well, you

ean*t have your relief if you are going to bring a second
suit, and may say you can ~~ what we run into, however,
will be the situation we believe that you may have' some
people declining their relief and bringing the second
action thinking they can get more; you will have as many
different decisions as you have district courts.

And I do

hot believe in Title VII this Court, which has consistently
sought uniformity in its interpretation, wants a ease by
ease approach.

We said something about that may bear
