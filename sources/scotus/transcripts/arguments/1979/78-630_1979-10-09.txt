PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Ho. 78-630, State of Washington v.
Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation.
Mr. Attorney General, you may proceed whenever you
are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON# ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. GORTON:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The State of Washington has for a number of years
imposed a tax of 16 cents per pack on the sale or possession
of cigarettes.

Income from that tax supports a broad range

■

-

■

of state programs, services and institutions.

■> V

The state’s

general sales tax of 5 percent is also levied against
cigarettes,

1

*

Neither bax is applied to sales by Indians to

other Indians on the reservation

to which both belong.

The respondsnt tribes recently have gone Into the
cigarette business.

In eonneetionwith that business, the

tribes levy what they call a tax or an administrative fee
on cigarette sales on their reservations.
smaller than the stated tax.

That fee is far

Their claim in this litiga­

tion is that their entry into the cigarette business together
with their tax or fee exempts Washington cltisens from the
state’s cigarette and general sales taxes for on-reservation

5 .

purchases.
A divided District Court found that the state's
pre-existing tax was preempted by the tribal taxes and fees
and alternatively that the state tax interfered with tribal
self-government.

Vie appealed.

The scheme adopted by the tribes

as upheld by

the District Court has several interrelated consequences.
The tribes emphasize only one of those consequences.
Because their taxes or fees ar© 13 to IS cents per pack
lower than the state taxes, the tribes g©ll large quantities
•of cigarettes to non-Indians who are trilling to drive con­
siderable distances to save that differential.' As a result,
the tribes5 revenues are substantial.
Not mentioned by the tribes, however, is the fact
that the state loses about $4 from Its tax revenues for
every $1 which is secured by the tribes.
total loss in state revenues

Incidentally, the

as a result of all Indian

smoke shops now is about $13 million per year.

Inevitablys

that consequence adversely affects the ability of the state
to supply governmental and social services to its citizens,
Indian and non-Indian alike.
The fact that the bulk of that $3 difference be­
tween state losses and tribal receipts remains In the
pockets of non-Indian purchasers cannot be overemphasized.
It illustrates the fact that this case concerns the assez’ted

6
right of an Indian tribe to market their major tax exempt
tion to non-Indians.

Those non-Indians avoid taxes which

their fellow cltisens, who ar© either more principled or
live farther from reservation smoke shops, must pay.

The

state tax is thus rendered inequitable and view it as a
revenue sharing method.

The entire method is absurd.

In this presentation* I propose first to deal
with the preemption issue.

I will show that no valid

source may be identified to support the claim that the
tribes can preempt or that the United States has preempted
these state taxes,

taen I will demonstrate that the con­

cept of tribal self-government does not and cannot by the
imposition

of these same taxes.
As an introduction to our argument against pre­

emption, it may help to point out that the word “preemption"
is used in your decisions as well as in this argument to
describe two closely related but distinct concepts.

First,

the United States may preempt the state tax by adopting its
own comprehensive taxing or regulatory statutes, thus occupy­
ing the field as it did in the situation in Warren Trading
Post.

Second, it may also preempt the state without occupy­

ing the field simply by prohibiting the state's entry, as
you found it did in the McClanahan situation.
Now, except during the heyday of the federal in­
strumentality doctrine, this Court simply has not found a

7
state tax on non-Indians with respect to their* on-reservation
activities to be preempted unless that preemption is found
In a statute or a treaty.

And in Meaoalero quite recently

this Court declined to revive the federal instrumentality
doctrine as a bar even to a state’s direct taxation of a
tribal enterprise.
Eighty years ago, in Thomas v. Gay, this Court
unequivocally held that the Indian Commerce Clause of the
Constitution standing alone did not preempt state or local
taxation of non-Indian property on an Indian reservation.
You have consistently required a showing of a preemptive
statute or treaty before striking down a state fax on the
on-reservation activities of non-Indians.

And.the only

statute you have ever found to have that effect was the
Indian Traders Act and the circumstances of the Warren
Trading Post case.

That statute you found to be so

detailed and comprehensive as to preempt Arizona’s levy
of a gross receipts tax on a non-Indian holding a federal
license to trade with the Navajos in respect to his income
from Indians on their reservations.
!'

i

Less all-encompassing statutes and treaty pro­
visions 9 on the other hand, simply do not preempt state
i:
•
taxes on non-Indians doing business on reservations.
Almost
a century ago, in Utah and Northern Railway Company, when
this Court could find neither a treaty nor a statutory bar

8
to a territory’s taxation of an on-re a e rvation railroad,
it upheld the tax.
Again, in Thomas v. Gay, you found no treaty or
statutory bar to a local tax on non-Indian cattle grazing
on reservation land leased from the tribes with the ap­
proval of the Secretary of the Interior, even though the
tribal leases were granted under express statutory, authority
from Congress.
And finally, three years ago, in Moe, you upheld
a state cigarette tax on non-Indian purchasers from an
Indian smoke shop.

That smoke shop was located oh land

leased from the tribe, a tribe also controlled the shop’s
purchases of cigarettes and charged the operator an
administrative fee.

Nevertheless, you found no treaty or

statutory provision to preempt the state tax.
To return for a third time to the decision in
Thomas v. Gay, the taxpayer asserted there that the tax
might destroy the value of the Indian lands for leasing
purposes.

This Court found it sufficient to answer -«>

and this is its complete answer « "but it is obvious that
a tax put upon the cattle of the lessees is too remote and,
indirect to be deemed a tax upon the land for privileges
of the Indians.”
This is precisely the distinction this Court has
reaffirmed since the decl5„ne of the federal Instrumentality

9
doctrine in far broader circumstances.

When the legal

incidence of a tax is on the United States itself, the tax
is invalid; whenfi however, the legal incidence of a state
tax falls on someone else, even though its economic impact
is felt by the United States, and even though it may be
alone In that feeling, the tax is valid unless it Is ex­
pressly preempted by a federal statute and there are a
number of such statutes,
QUESTION:

Mr. Gorton, just so I understand it,

if the legal incidence of this tax had fallen on the
retailer, the Indian retailer, it would clearly he invalid,
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

It would be,
Okay.
The tribes here claim a more expan­

sive preemption to apply when a state tax on a private
party impacts the income of those tribes than obtains when
such a tax impacts the United States government itself.
But Mescalero and Mae teach us that no such expansive claim
can be supported.
Finally, rather than following respondents’ in­
vitation to focus on federal statutes which have nothing
to do with taxes, like the Indian Financing Act or the
Indian Self-Determination Act, we should look briefly at
acts which do explicitly address questions of state taxing
power over Indians and Indian reservations.

Those acts

10
include the Buck Act, Public Law 280, and various termina­
tion acts.

The first two expressly disclaim any intention

to delegate to the states any power to tax Indians on their
reservations.

The latter determination acts, of course, do

authorise just such taxes after termination.

Hone of those

acts so much as mention any non-Indian immunity from state
taxation on their reservation activities.
that is obvious.

The reason for

It never occurred to Congress that there

was any such immunity, and Congress was correct.
How, incidentally, the same analysis which applies
to the determination of the existence of non-Indian tax
Immunity on -reservations, is there a statute or a treaty
creating them, seems also to be the key at least to your
modern determinations of the validity of state attempts to
tax on reservation Indians themselves.

In McClanahan It was the Navajo Treaty and a
statutory pattern.

In connection, with the compensating use

the Indian Reorganisation Act.

In Moe, state taxes on

reservation Indians were preempted only by the statutes
cited in McClanahan and Mescalero and not by any doctrine

11

of constitutional law.

Inevitably, therefore, the question

here must be what if any treaty or statutory source can be
found to prevent the state from taxing non-Indians engaged
in purchases of cigarettes which purchases

were identical

to those in Moe.
The statutory pattern here is unchanged from the
statutory pattern in that case and the applicable treaty
provisions here, among those who are treaty tribes, are
identical In effect to those of the Helgate Treaty present
in the Moe case.

First, to improve the economic status of individual Indians;
and, second, to foster tribal self-government.

As this

Court characterised the Indian Reorganisation Act in the
Meacalero opinion, "these provisions were designed
. i’ to
encourage tribal enterprises to enter the white world on a

12
footing of equal competition."
Now, Moe tells us that no federal statute or
treaty gives an individual Indian a huge competitive ad­
vantage in the cigarette business by preempting a state
tax levied on non-Indians.

Thomas v. Gay, Mescalero,

and Moe teaches that the mere fact that a non-Indian tax
may adversely Impact tribal Income does not trigger an
automatic preemption of that state tax.
How then can a tribal entry into the cigarettes
business, with or without a tribal taxs trigger a preemption
tfhich gives the tribe a prohibitive competitive advantage
in the teeth of the federal goal to encourage tribal en­
terprises to enter the non-Indian business world on a
footing of equal competition?
QUESTION:

General Gorton, is the extent of the

competitive advantage significant in your argument?

Now,

apparently there is both an excise tax and a sales tax,
and is the same argument applicable to both?
MR. GORTON:

The same argument Is applicable to

both.
QUESTION:

So the extent of the competitive ad­

vantage really isn?t critical her®.
MR. GORTON:

No.

No.

The policy of these acts

are that Indie,ns should enter the non-Indian business world
on an equal footing basis.

13
QUESTION;

Does your argument apply to retail

sales by Indians of, say, things they might make on the
reservation, artifacts or souvenirs or things like that?
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

To non-Indians,
To non-Indians.
Yes.
The same —
And as a matter of fact, that kind

of tax was even upheld by the District Court in this case.
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

All right.
The answer is that the tribe cannot

trigger such a preemption since no federal statute has been
cited for the proposition that tribal enterprises are
entitled to unequal advantages over their non-Indian compe­
titors,

The state’s non-discriminatory tar.es on non-Indian

purchasers of cigarettes from Indian dealers are not pre­
empted,
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, you answered

Brother Stevens that if the incidence of the tax was on
the Indian sellerB there would be — it would be illegal
or unconstitutional or what?

What is the basis for that?

Is it preemption or is it —
MR. GORTON:
McClanahan,

The basis for that would be

I believe —

QUESTION:

And what do you understand the legal —

MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

It would b© preemption.
From what?

MR. GORTON:

Preemption from the statutory and

treaty pattern which was utilised in McClanahan and then
later in Moe to preempt exactly the
QUESTION:

Would this be a wrong statement, that

absent some federal statute expressly permitting such a tax,
it is forbidden?

Is that a brand of preemption?

It might

be,
MR, GORTON:

I think that the correct statement

would be, based on Moe and expressly on Footnote 17 of Moe»
that absent a federal statute or treaty provision preventing
or prohibiting such a tax, the state would be permitted to
impose it even on sales to Indians.
QUESTION:

And you suggest that Jt is preempted

by gome —* by a pattern of federal statutes and treaties?

MR. GORTON:

It is precisely the pattern which

was utilized in McClanahan and —
QUESTION:

Preemption in th© sense of conflict

or just occupying the field?
MR, GORTON:

In McClanahan, It would be a pro­

hibition because there was no occupation of the field, nor
was there in Moe.

There wore no Indian taxes which inter­

fered in the state’s attempt to impose a tax in either
McClanahan or Moe on Indians.

15
QUESTION:

So you think it is an expression of

congressional consent that in light of the existing
statutes there shouldn't b© any state tax?
MR. GORTON:

That's correct.

The tribes and the United States assert that
even if there is no preemption of the state's power to tax
on-reservatlon cigarette purchases by non-Indians, never­
theless the state tax may not b® imposed because it in­
fringes upon the right of reservation Indians to make their
own lives and be governed by them» and it states that as
a separate theory.
That right of Indian self-government standing
alone vrithout preemption can never bar the imposition of a
tax by the state on its own non-Indian citlzehs.

In

t

:Lllusfcrations the broadest powers of self-government which
can be possessed by any sovereign are those exercised by a
fully sovereign nation, obviously.

But the; United States

itself, obviously a self-governing sovereign, has no power
to prevent Great Britain from imposing taxes on British
citizens, on purchases made by those citizens on visits
here to the United States, even if the goods purchased here
never leave the United States,
Another illustration is —
QUESTION:

General Gorton, I suppose the parallel

would be could Great Britain require the United States

necessary to -»
MR. GORTON:

No, it could not because the United

States retailer is not within Great Britain.
QUESTION:

That is really the problem because

there is no doubt about your power to lmpo6:e the tax.

You

impose the tax if they buy it over in Oregon, too, can ’t
you?
MR. GORTON:

We could impose a different tax.

We can impose a tax when they return with those goods to
the State of Washington,
never did so.

W© could hot impose a tax if they

But the point is her® that --

QUESTION:

Couldn’t you impose the tax?

you couldn’t collect it, but you could impose it.

Maybe
Your

British analogy is a good one anyway.

i

'

MR, GORTON:

-

;|

My British analogy would not cover

this situation because the United States Constitution would
prevent the state of Washington from making that imposition.
That is why I used the British example.

The United States

Constitution does not bar the British tax collector in
dealing with its own citizens.
The point here is, however, Mr. Justice Stevens,
that this injunction and the theory of the ease by the
United States and the tribes doesn’t say that we simply
can’t collect this tax on the reservation but can collect

1?
it from non-Indians who leave the reservation*

It says

that the tax is invalids we cannot impose it at &lls even
after non-Indian citizens return*

And of course, that is

necessary to their argument because in order to protect
their tribal income, they need to prevent us from Imposing
that tax anywayB not simply from collecting it on the
reservation Itself.
QUESTION:

General Gorton, would the reaching of

the majority allow an Indian automobile franchise on the
reservation to sell new automobiles and prevent the state
sf Washington from collecting a use tax if those automobiles
were used outside of the reservation in the state of
Washington?
MR., GORTON:

If the automobile dealership were a

tribal enterprise producing income for the tribe„ the theory
of the District Court would prevent that tax, and I intend
to get to that in a little bit greater detail in just a
moment,
Another illustration similar to the British one,
the Yakima Nation was fully sovereign early in the 19th
Century; nevertheless6 it could not then have exercised
that unlimited power of self-government to prohibit the
United States from taxing one of its citizen members of
the Lewis and Clark Expedition on purchases which that
citizen made from the Yakima Indians in the Yakima Nation.

18
The Constitution or laws of the United States might have
prohibited such a tax, but the laws of the Yakima Nation
could not have done so.
The power to levy a tax may be inherent in re­
tained sovereignty, but the power to bar the imposition of
a tax by another sovereignty on its own citisens in its iwn
territory is not,

Thus the limited right of self-govern­

ment now possessed by th® Indian tribes cannot bar
Washington's imposition of these cigarette taxes upon nonIndians in Washington state,

Th© United States may In the

future preempt these taxes by some statute or even author­
ise the tribe to do so» but to assert the right of tribal
self-government is not to prevent an alternative grounds
for affirming the District Court, it is merely to restate
the preemption argument.

/

1

Nothing in this submission, of course,, is designed

to deny the realities of the tribal self-government doctrine
' and the proposition of state actions may not infringe on
the right of reservation Indians to make their own lives
or to be ruled by them.
3oes two things!

That Williams v. Lee doctrine

Affirmatively, it confirms in the tribes

the right to control internal tribal relations, to prescribe
laws applicable to tribal members, and to enforce those
laws in its own court.

Negatively, it prohibits the state

from applying its laws to on-reservation Indians and

19
enforcing those laws in state courts except where author­
ised by Congress to do so.

This protection necessarily re­

quires non-Indians to su© reservation Indians in tribal
court in order to enforce rights created on the reservation.
A state tax upon non-Indiana cannot possibly
affect that 'right of reservation Indians to make their own
laws and to be governed by the®.

This Court has never ex­

tended that doctrine to bar a state tax on non-Indians, nor
should it do so now.
foundations

To do so would be to subvert the very

of state sovereignty and the ability of the

state to adopt a just and equitable tax system.
If the state of Washington may not Impose a
cigarette tax on reservation sales to non-Indians because

to do so would interfere with tribal self-government by

4 f;

destroying a source of tribal revenue, can the state then
even repeal its tax on off-reservation sales in order to
.equalise tax burdens on Its citizens?

That action would

have exactly the same effect on tribal cigarette sales
and tribal income as would the imposition of the state? s
tax on reservations.

d !

•]

Of course2 the state retains the right, the
power to repeal its off-reservation tax.

The question and

answer simply illustrates the point that the effect on
tribal revenues of a state tax on non-Indifins is as ir­
relevant to the right of tribal self-government today as

20
It was at the time of ThomaE v, Gay.
The state of Washington has chosen rationally
to levy high excise taxes on tobacco and liquor» among
other things0 either to discourage their consumption or
to concentrate its revenue sources on socially marginal
activities rather than on important activities such as
the purchase of food.

That choice and similar future

choices are threatened by th® decision below.
Our state might wall choose in the future to
Impose extremely high excisa taxas on, sayy the purchase
of gold or of motor vehicles which make less than 20 miles
per gallon of gaa.

Should th© District Court be affirmed,

however, the sale of those goods if the tax were high
enough could immediately b© monopolised by Indian tribes
by the simple expedient of adopting tribal ordinances
similar to those at issue hers.
QUESTIONi

Well, could it make any difference to

your argument if the state of Washington had adopted a tax
of a dollar a load upon bread ant! the Indian tribes on
their lands sold the bread tax-free?
MR, GORTON:

It would not make any theoretical

difference in the argument, Mr, Justice Relinquish, remember­
ing, of courses that th® Indians could s©i:, it tax-free to
their own members, but that tax might vary well be found
to be unconstitutional or in some kind of violation of due

21
process, but that Is —
QUESTION:

What tax?

I am talking about a tax

on sales — supposing instead of smoke shops on the reser­
vations , the Indians had bread shops,
MR. GORTON:

If the set of statutory patterns

and the tribal arguments were identical to those here, the
result would be the same.
QUESTION':
MR. GORTON:

And furniture shops or
In the case of furniture shops, the

District Court here found that the tax would apply because
the Indians had net shown that it had any effect on their
income.
In effect, the power to decide how Washington
citizens will be taxed and what social goals are to be
pursued will be transferred from the state legislature to
the tribal councils.

We submit that neither the Constitu­

tion nor any act of Congress nor any treaty provision nor
the right of tribal self-government permits such a subver­
sion of rational state policies of non-disorimlnatory taxes
on non-Indians.

The right of Indian self-government and

the right of all citizens for self-government can flourish
together only If these decisions are reversed.
There is, however, a shorter and similar and
simpler answer to this controversy if this Court wishes to
adopt it, is simply follow your own decision in Moe.

The

22
transactions here do not differ significantly from those
in Moe.

In the Yakima case here, the tribe does not claim

to be engaged in the retail cigarette business, nor does
it claim to tax cigarette sales to non-Indians.

It is

solely a cigarette wholesaler whose profit Is partly
called by that name and partly denominated an administrative
fee.

The tribe in Moe imposed just such an administrative

fee, leased the smoke shop site and controlled wholesale
purchases.
In the Colville case here, the tribes claim to
be in the retail cigarette business and to levy a retail
tax on cigarettes.

But the actual conduct of that; business

does not differ from that of the Yakimas.
•

The tribe is

much like the operator in Moe,

The smoke shop operator is
He pays a fixed price per

carton to the tribe, sets whatever retail price he wishes
and takes home his gross sales receipts less his costs and
business expenses.

The state taxes on non-Indian purchasers

and its collection requirements on Indian retailers operate
in precisely the same fashion and with precisely the same
results as did the Montana tax in Moe.

The result here

should be the same as well.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP STEVEN S. ANDERSON» ESQ.»
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. ANDERSON:

Mr. Chief Justicea and may it

please the Court:
The state of Washington in these proceedings con­
tends for a radical principle, the principle that it has
the power to effectively preempt and eliminate tribal
taxation of Indian commerce on trust land within the ex­
ternal boundaries of an Indian reservation.

Under the

facts of this case, that commerce is already taxed by the
tribe, the governing body of the situs where this Indian
commerce between Indians and non-Indians takes place.
Our contention is that the state's attempt to
apply its tax laws is an attempt to appropriate to itself
tax revenues which more properly belong to the Indian
tribes which is the governing body of the situs of this
commerce.
Although Mr. Gorton tires to tell this Court
that this is a tax immunity case, that is not true.
is not so.

Tala is not Moe,

This

This is a case In which the

tribe is levying Its own tax and using those tax revenues
for essential governmental purposes.
QUESTION:

Are you addressing yourself now ex­

clusively to the cigarette tax or mors broadly than that?
MR. ANDERSON:

I am addressing right now the

24
cigarette tax, Mr. Chief Justice.

There was no contention

by the tribes in our case regarding the salles tax and that
is not an issue in the Colville ease.

The real Issue here

is —

QUESTION:

You represent the three tribes other

than the Yakima nation?
MR. ANDERSON:

That's correct. Your Honor.

The real issue in this ease is which of two in­
consistent and incompatible tax lav/s can bo applied to
these reservation transactions when it is not possible for­
th© two systems to peacefully coexist.
The stipulated facts in this case make it abso­
lutely clear that there can be no survival of the tribal
taxing systems if the state tax is superimposed on the
tribal tax that is already levied on these goods.

If the

state succeeds -QUESTION:

Do you mean that that is because it

is economically net feasible?
MR. ANDERSON:

Yes, I am talking about the

practicalities of the situation and I think Williams v.
Lee was a practical test and 1 think the inposition of
state law In this case ought to be judged by Its practical
effects.
It is clear that this protected
between Indians and

commerce

non-Indians, constitutionally

protected commerce if the state imposes this tax will be
subjected to multiple burdens.
QUESTION:

You are not claiming that the basis

for your exemption here Is constitutionals are you?
MR. ANDERSON:

We make that argument as well,

Your Honor, yes.
QUESTION:

In spite of Footnote 17 in Moe?

MR. ANDERSON:

Footnote 1? in Moe, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, stated that — it was talking about the Issue
in McClanahan, whether or not state tax laws could be ap­
plied to Indians on the reservation, and the Court said
that the McClanahan-decision made it clear that there was
no automatic exemption and that is, of course, clear be­
cause in McClanahan the Court looked to the specific
federal statutes rather than the United States Constitu­
tion to find the preemption.
But the issue of a tax that directly and sub­
stantially inteferes with tribal self-government was not
:

presented in McClanahan and I do not read that footnote in
Moe to have disposed of fchs constitutional issues that
were not before it,
We do contend that one of the purposes of the
Indian commerce clause was to provide protection for tribal
self government and a tax — Williams v. Lee, after all,
is in part a constitutional test.

You will remember that

26
the Court in Williams said that the question was whether
absent governing laws of Congress, state law could Im­
permissibly interfere, with tribal self-government and
this Court in Williams also recognised that the holding
of the United States Supreme Court in Worcester was also
a constitutional holding,
QUESTION:

But didn’t McClanahan make the state­

ment that we had moved from an era of automatic lines be­
tween constitutional and unconstitutional to a less sovereign
and more preemptive type of test?
MR, ANDERSON:

McClanahan did say, Your Honor,

that the Indian sovereignty doctrine was the backdrop and
not the dispositive principle,

But I think what the Court

was saying was that the Worcester principle originally
announced by Mr. Justice Marshall had been somewhat modi­
fied.

Originally, as the opinion in Worcester makes

clear, the Court treated Indian reservations at that time
a3 a virtual island, a boundary of which state law could
not cross under any circumstances.

And in McClanahan the

Court noted that in situations where tribal governments
were not affected and the rights of Indians were not
affected, 3tate law could be applied to non-Indians.
On the other hand, the Court in Williams made
clear, and as well in McClanahan, that the basic holding
of Worcester, the basic constitutional holding still

27
remained Intact in situations where essential governmental
relations, essential tribal relations were Involved.

And

I don’t think that the Moe footnote can or should be read
to eliminate a line of constitutional argument that was
not even at issue and before the Court in Moe.
Now, it is clear that the practical impact of
the imposition of this state tax will be to totally destroy
the tribes’ ability to tax in the situation.

The District

Court specifically found that one of the results of imposi­
tion of the state taxes will be the elimination of the
essential tax revenues needed by these tribal programs,
needed for the financing of these tribal programs.
In addition, the court found that a result of
the imposition of these taxes would be forced relinquish­
ment of these critically needed tribal programs.

Now,

ultimately the principle that the state contends for here
is that the Indian tribe would have no ability whatsoever
to tax transactions on the reservation that are already
being taxed by the state.

By the same token, an Indian

tribe, if the state’s principle is granted, would be com­
mitting economic suicide if it al3© attempts to tax
transactions In which there is no state tax.

In either

case, the result of Imposing the state tax would be that
Indian commerce and transactions on the reservation would
be more expensive than those transactions off the

28
reservation.
Now, Indian tribes are already suffering from
depressed economies.

Our tribes are geographically isolated.

It is difficult enough for them to rehabilitate themselves
and provide essential services with these physical and
geographical disabilities.

Now, that the state of

Washington would impose additional disabilities upon the
state by effectively preempting its ability to tax.
QUESTION:

What about the furniture store, the

automobile dealership?
MR. ANDERSON:

,
I think the District Court

answered that argument very well.

The state of Washington

in the proceedings below tried to argue that there was no
limit to the principles that if the tribes could tax
i
cigarettes they ifould extend their activities to all sorts
of other situations.
The District Court found — and this is essential
to its holding -<-» that the tribes had acted in a restrained
manner and that the situation of a tribe attempting to
extend its laws to all sorts of other situations is simply
not before the Court.
QUESTION:

Well, what

separates a furniture store or an automobile dealership on
the one hand from a smoke shop on the other?
MR. ANDERSON:

Well, there perhaps is no absolute

29
theoretical difference,,
QUESTION:

I would say —

Well, is there any theoretical dif­

ference?
MR. ANDERSON:

Well, it seems to me that the core

of the District Court’s holding was that the tribes were
acting in a limited capacity, in a limited way they were
acting with restraint.

three-carton limitation in this case.

MR. ANDERSON:

Well, one of the problems with

that kind of program is that in order for this tribal
enterprise to work, we have to be dealing with an area in
which the state taxation is substantial.

Now, it is not

practical perhaps for tribes to enter the sales tax area
where the differential wouldn’t be great enough to cause
people to travel long distances to the reservation.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn’t the state of Washington

MR. ANDERSON:

Well, the principle that a tribe

when it exercises its taxing power can preempt inconsistent

Well, that is all Justice Rehnquist

has been asking, isn’t its whether* the same principle
would apply if you had a tribal tax on sales of new cars.
MR. ANDERSON:

Yes, except that it is not neces­

sary for this Court in deciding this case to consider ex­
tensions of this doctrine to their ultimate and perhaps
Illogical conclusion.

It is well within the power of this

Court to set any limits that may be necessary or appro­
priate.

I would also —
QUESTION:

MR. ANDERSON:

cautioning the tribes that its holding was based oh the
fact that the tribes were acting in an extremely limited
manner in this case, and I think the District Court gave
us a warning In that instance.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP JAMES B. HOVIS, ESQ,,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. HOVTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I represent the Yakima Indian Nation, appellees
In the United States v. Washington case.

We do not take

the position that this principle that we are asking for
here should be limited just to cigarettes.

I see no

logical difference between any goods, whether It is
cigarettes, cars, furniture, ®fc cetera.
It would appear to me in the principle position
that we take that if the state requires relief with
regards to sales of other items that do no*; fit in v^ith
the Indian economy and do exceed their sovereign bounds,
that the remedy that the state of Washington would have
would be a legislative one before Congress,
My colleague, Mr. Anderson, has really put the
focus of his discussion with regards to this matter on the
Williams preemption Infringement test.

It has been pointed

out that ■— and it is stipulated in brief by everyone in
this case — that if the state tax goes on that it will
destroy the federally approved tribal and tribal licensed
enterprises.
I think it must be pointed out that in each
tribe, that the federal government, through the responsible

federal authority has had these enterprises approved by
the federal government.

And I would join my colleagues in

submitting that the Washington scheme is in violation of
the Williams infringement preemption test and that the
District Court's holdings are correct.
But I wouldj, if the Court please, like to take
my portion of the time to talk about Washington jurisdic­
tion and power to reach these transactions on Indian reser­
vations, on trust lands where the state has no jurisdiction
or power, regardless of whether or not this would impair
the tribal government or impair the tribal enterprise or
regardless of whether or not it would destroy it.
QUESTION:

I take it then regardless of whether

there is an Indian tax?
MR. HQVIS:

Regardless of whether there is an

QUESTION:

—

--

This isn't a request to reargue

Montana, is it?
MR. HOVIS:

Mo, no, no,

would like to distinguish Montana.

No, sir

No, sir.

I

General Gorton, as I

see it, In his attempt, in the state of Washington's
attempt to destroy private self-government has two
perimeters it must pierce.

The first one is what I call

the McClanahan principle, this Court has called the
McClanahan principle, and the second one is the Williams

38
infringement test, is a second perimeter he must pierce
before he can destroy tribal self-government.
I submit in this case that the state of Washington
has no jurisdiction or power to tax the sale between the
Indians and non-Indians on trust lands within the Yakima
Indian Reservation.

I think this Court has pointed this

way to me in its 1973 pro curium decision in Tonasket v.
Washington, when the Washington tax system was last
before this Court, and at that time they said -— they
reversed the Washington tax scheme, saying we reverse
and send it back, the Supreme Court decision, and we ask
you to look first at the state law and second at the
McClanahan case.

And when the Supreme Court of the

state of Washington then dealt with it, they said that
under state law the tax did not apply and therefore
reversed their original decision, but not based on the
McClanahan principle because they took care of it and
the state law did not arise.
In McClanahan, this Court determined that
Arizona had exceeded its power whan it attempted to apply
Arizona’s individual income tax to a reservation Indian,
regardless of whether or not this action infringed on
the tribal government.
This Court has said in Bryan v. Itasca County
that the McClanahan principle provides that state laws

39
are not applicable to tribal Indiana on Indian reservations
reservations except where Congress has expressly provided
that state laws shall apply.
My learned friends General Gortona relies on
this Court's holding in Moe v. Salish and Kootenai Tribes
and submits that the McClanahan principle is not applicable
to this instant case.

1 would like to discuss the reason

that I believe and submit the reason that I believe that
Moe is not applicable here.
In Moes what this Court did0 as I read the de­
cision, was to uphold the District Court's denial of a
restraint of criminal arrest of Indian retailers sailing
unstamped cigarettes to non-Indians contrary to the state
criminal code on the site of the reservation where Congress
had expressly authorised state criminal jurisdiction.
Moe did not involve the collection of taxes from
Indian retailers, it did not involve a 3ta;e licensing or
the state regulation of Indian retailers; while here' this
case involves the collection of the taxes if the Indians
do not collect them from the non-Indian purchasers or
collect the taxes from the Indian purchasers, and also
provide for the state regulation of the retailers to pro­
vide with the state regulations in regards to this.
My friend, General Gorton, suggests that it has
the power to collect these taxes and we believe that is

40
not correct because where fch«sa transactions took place on
the Yakima Reservation were within the exterior boundaries
of the Yakima Reservation and on trust land where there
is no jurisdiction, the state has no criminal or civil
jurisdiction over the Indians involved on these lands.
This Court in Washington v„ Yakima Nation last
term upheld that this was part of the state's purpose, to
orovlde for state government to keep the jurisdiction off
of that and held that Congress had to have in mind,
especially had that In mind when it passed Public Law 280,
that such a partial quoting of jurisdiction could be pro­
vided.
Now, the transactions which Washington claimed
taxing power all took place on these lands and there was
no Jurisdiction over the tribal members at all for an
regulatory power, arrest power, civil or criminal,
judicial or legislative power over the Indians involved.
And as this Court said in McClanahan, unless
the states can show how they can constitutionally .impose
the collection of this tax and the regulation on the
Indians where they have no jurisdiction, legislative or
judicial, then that disposes of the case.

And that is

pages 178 and 179 of that decision.
Now, Washington — my friend, General Gorton,
submits that Washington, in his brief, may seize without

process* due or otherwise* goods being delivered to my
clients in Interstate commerce on trust lands.

Now* these

goods that are being delivered to my clients* the Yakima
Nation, are not taxable in any event becauseit is clear
that these goods are sold to Indians on the Indian reserva­
tion, on trust lands.
non-Indians.

The Yakima Nation does not sell to

Non-Indian retailers later sell —* I mean

the Indian retailers of course later sell to non-Indians,
but when these goods are in transit they are not being
sent to the Yakima Indian Reservation in interstate com­
merce by bonded carriers, the sale to the Yakima Nation
is a legal one to its licensed retailers.
QUESTION:

Is this Issue before the Court,- the

issue of the sale trucks that go through Washington to
the reservation?
MR. HOVIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

'

I thought the District Court didn’t

reach it because it struck down the tax on interstate —
MR. HOVIS:

It struck down the tax situation

on the preemption and the infringement test, on the
Williams test, and they didn't reach that.

But I am sug­

gesting this for a full discussion of this problem before
the Court because this Court has not this

jase but it has

similar cases that it has accepted jurisdiction on that
some discussion of the McClanahan principle would be

42
applicable here today in your determination.

And I am

into the enforcement area here to show you that there la
no due process — I submit to you that there is no due
process way that the state of Washinton can collect the
tax or have any power, legislative or judicial, over the
Indian retailers which they suggest they are trying to do.
QUESTION:

Well, what if the state of Washington

simply stated or stationed tax collectors on the Washington
side of the boundary

between the reservation and the

state of Washington and inspected cars coming off the
reservation, and if they bought cartons of cigarettes on
the reservation they would Impose a

tax.

I would think, Your Honor, that we

are not in any differant — nor do I claim that we are
any different from the state of Oregon,

K

If you purchase

M

something in Oregon and providing that you comply with
the constitutional commerce clause, If the state of

•

Washington does that and is not discriminatory, then they
can collect from their non-Indians when they are within
their jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Do you think your colleague from the

three tribes agrees with you?
MR. HOVIS:
QUESTION:
/

MR. HOVIS:

No, they do not.
Nor the United States?
Well, I have not asked the United

43
States.

But they do not take the same position in this

case that I do, Mr. Justice White.
QUESTION:

Would you say that you would empha­

size enforcement if the state could collect at the boun­
daries of the reservation, may they make the Indian seller
collect?
MR. HOVIS:

No, they may not.

They have no

jurisdiction whatsoever, legislative or judicial, over the
Indian seller.

That is my point.

I can go further, however.

There may — I do

not disagree totally with my colleague, Mr. Anderson.

I

do not disagree totally but I don51 think this is clear
in this principle.

I think there is a situation hero

where this sale may. not be able to reach with a use tax
i

outside th*3 exterior boundary, and let me explain to; you
why. I do not disagree with Mr. Anderson, although I do not
think that it is as clear as this principle.
The reason I do not disagree with him is be­
cause this is not a case in which Congress has been silent.
This is not a case in which Congress has been silent.
Congress has in passing the Buck Act said that it permits
the state to levy sales, use or income taxes in federal
areas but it expressly provides that nothing therein shall
be deemed to authorize the collection or any tax on or from
any Indian not taxed and, as pointed out in our cases in

4*1
th® briefs this is a continuance of an existing thing.
Now, I was particularly interested in a decision
written by Justice Donaldson for the Mahoney majority in
the Idaho Supreme Court, and I adopt his understanding
and I adopt his rationale.

As he pointed out, the Congress

must have been aware at the time it passed the Buck Act in
section 103 of the existing solicitor's opinion of the
United States that opined that Indians arenot subject to
state laws whether they deal with Indians or non-Indians,
in the tax field.
Now, that Mahoney decision is a weight one.
You see, that is the circumstance we have surrounding
us, Idaho underneath their stats law does not tax
not try to impress the situation.

does

I think it is worth

nothing that with the regularity that this Court sees Mr.
Gorton, that the' state of Washington has somewhatdiffer.ent attitude about Indian rights in some of our neighbor­
ing states.
But one of the things, Mr. Justice Rehnqftiist,
in your question you were talking a little bit about some
of the discussion of McClanahan.

Yes, there

has

been

some change in the Worcester doctrine, some modification
in the line of more preemption.

But one of the problems

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It

please the Court:
Perhaps before attempting to join them back to­
gether , it might be useful if I sought to unravel the
several strands of the argument as we see it on this side
Without pretending that any single one of these
arguments is sufficient to carry the day, it is in our
submission useful to look at three arguments that when
joined do in our submission justify the holding of the
District Court.
I identify them first aa the territorial prin­
ciple; secondly, as the commercial principle; and thirdly
is the governmental principle, somewhat arbitrary titles
for the purpose.
But the territorial idea is one which, of
course, dates from the very earliest cases In this Court
dealing with Indian tribes.

It is basically the notion

»

that only in exceptional circumstances,

a? this Court

repeated only last term, may state law or state taxes

invade that area which has been reserved to the continu­
ing sovereignty of the tribe albeit in a most limited way.
And the question therefore is whether this ease,
this tax or these taxes fall within that exception, not
the other way around.

The burden is not on the tribe to

show that this particular tax would normally apply but for
reasons (a), (b), and (c) it does not.

The burden is very

mich on the state to justify the intrusion of its laws,
its taxes within an area still separate in some meaning­
ful sense.
Now, that principle is not only an old one, it
is one which has been reiterated as recently as Wheeler.
It is a principle which has been the basis for distin­
guishing between activities on and off reservation, in­
cluding cases in the tax area, noticeably the Mescalero
opinion in 411 U.S. reports.
I suggest that the result in than case in
respect of the sales tax or gross profits tax would have
been different had that ski enterprise been on rather
than off the reservation, and the thrust of the opinion
as I read it is the emphasis on the fact that the im­
munity has its limits , its geographic, limits and. cannot
be imported beyond the limits of the reservation or ex­
ported and, of course, there is no attempt to do so in
this case.

m
There is, of course, a giving way of reservation
boundaries over the years with the opening up policy
which results in non-Indians living on the reservation,,
but that historic fact has nothing to do with this case.
We are not dealing with a modern change of fact which re­
quires a change of law because the Yakima Reservation is
inhabited by a substantial non-Indian population.

We arc:

dealing with Indian trade which has been going on since
the beginning in which the white man sells to the Indian
and vice versa.

Instead of dealing with furs or with

other skins or with horses or with tobacco in Its raw
form, we now deal with cigarettes and the principle ought
to be the same.
Of course, it matters what the effect of the
state’s intrusion is.

If it is law, if it is tax, it

impinges only on the non-Indian residents or the nonIndian while on the reservation, that is permissible.
That is not the situation here.

The effeci; is not indirect,

it is not remote, it is not minimal.

It destroys a tribal

enterprise and it is a tribal enterprise and not a private
one.
With those remarks, I turn to the second aspect
which is the burden which this state tax places on the
economy.

Simply to illustrate that there is such a

principle and indeed a constitutional principle which

derives directly from the Indian commerce clauses when we
only posit a state law which prohibited implementation, if
I may use that words into the state of Washington of
products grown or manufactured on the Yakima Reservations
such a law would be manifestly unconstitutional as violat­
ing the Indian commerce clause and so would the reverse, a
prohibition on the exportation of products into an Indian
reservation.
Now, of course, that is not this case but stimply
illustrates that the Indian commerce clause has, like the
other aspects of the commerce clause, a self-executing
force which may be relevant to this case„
Here we deal with state taxes which not only
burden the commerce between Indian and non-Indian but
which in this respect destroy it, utterly.
The District Court found that the state sales
taxes as applied to furniture and other manufacture did
not have that effect, that the effect was not demonstrated
and presumptively minimal and accordingly did not invalidate
those taxes.

Here the combined effect of the state excise

and sales tax on cigarettes admittedly destroyed that
commerce.

That effect, it seems to us, implicates the

Indian commerce clause.
Now, finally and perhaps most importantly, we
look at the governmental aspects of the case and here the

great distinction between this case and Moe.
QUESTION:

So you would say that because collec­

tion at the border of the reservation from the buyer would
have the same impact, the tax collected that way would be
too burdensome?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice White, if forced to

an answer, 1 think I would probably would say. that.

I

would stress that this is not a use tax imposed only on the
use of the cigarettes once they have left the reservation.

No, the Washington law is that we

impose on -the buyer a tax when he buys cigarettes and they
just collect it from him at the border.

QUESTION:

What if the Indians went into the

lousiness of manufacturing automobiles and made automobiles
which they sold to the public, didn’t tax them at all, but
the state of Washington imposed an excise tax on them,

excise tax was' enough to ruin the margin of profit that

the Indians had been making before they imposed the tax

reservation?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

In that instance — and I am not

clear, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, whether the enterprise of
manufacturing the cars in your hypothetical is done by
the tribe or by seme entrepreneur -—
QUESTION:

By the tribe.

MR. CLAIRBORNE:

There is perhaps an important

difference there, but that case it seems to me would fall
o.n the other side of the line, that is that we could not
invalidate Washington's tax in those circumstances, there
being no collision between the tax imposed by the tribe,
there being none in your hypothetical, and that imposed

51
by the state»
There are gradations, but if you look at It from
the other extreme it seems absurd perhaps that Washington
would claim its right to tax even the most traditional
Indian artifacts that are used on the reservation which
would not otherwise come into commerce at all, and yet the
Attorney General was quite clear that he would apply the
same rule to that situation»
It may be that the tribes,though every incentive
leads them to self-restraint — after all, they must live
at the end of the day with the state, with state, officials
in Washington state law, for the most part, applies on
/

their reservations, there must be a modus vivendi.

It is

not in their interests to press their advantage if it is
legally recognised to the extreme.

Congress and Congress would undoubtedly be pretty receptive
to any indication that the tribes were abusing their
privilege in such a way as seriously to detract from im­
portant state revenues»

That is not the case here.

Indeed, many other states have taken the opposite
view of these reservation smoke shop operations.

We are

told amici in this case that Nevada and Florida expressly
condone the claim of the tribes to be exempted from sales
and excise taxes on their sales of cigarettes to

52
non-Indians.

The Idaho Supreme Court has so held.

further informed that Arizona takes the sane view.
so does Wisconsin and New Mexico.
Washington is the exception.

I am
Indeed,

That is the pattern.

It apparently is a system

with which most of the states have been content to live
and some expressly recognise that this small effort by
the tribes to become self-sustaining is lawful, ought not
to be interfered with and —
QUESTION:

Do you have solid statistical basis

for saying one is a pattern and the ether is the exception?
MR, CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Rehnqui3ta I can’t

say that there has been sufficiently accurate or adequate
investigation of the various state laws.

This information

is for the most part contained in briefs filed in this
case amicus curiae,

I have supplemented it insofar as I

have mentioned New Mexico„ Wisconsin and Arizona,
QUESTION:

But with respect to some of the states

that don’t attempt to collect its own tax, it doesn’t make
any difference whether there is a tribal tax or not, isn’t
that true?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Yes.

Justice Whites if I haven’t

I am not suggesting Mr.

said before that- in each of

these cases there is a tribal tax but that there is a
tribal cigarette business and in each of these states the
state though imposing an excise tax generally does not

53
impose that tax on sales to non-Indians occurring within
the reservation,
QUESTION:

You don't suggest that without the

tax that Washington would be out of bounds here, without
the tribal tax?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I suggest that It would be on a

very close boundary except —
QUESTION:

Well, would it be covered by Moe or

not?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

It would — there is another

distinction between that case, between this case and Moe
which is that here we are dealing with a governmental
operation not only in the sense that the tribe taxes but
that the tribe regulates everything, including price.
QUESTION:

How about the Yakima Nation?

MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

Well, is that a tribal enterprise?

MR. CLAIBORNE:
prise.

That is so, the Yakima Nation.

It is a tribal wholesale enter­

The ordinance requires that a uniform price be

fixed by the dealers and presumptively if they don’t, if
they fail to agree the state will impose it and it limits
the number of outlets, it requires that each of them
qualify and it requires that thay be subject to continuing
regulation and annual renewal of their licenses.

It is a

rather strict regulatory scheme of tax of the enterprise

54
even at the retail level,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr.

Claiborne.
Do you have anything further, General Gorton?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON

ESQ., ,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL
MR. GORTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Mr. Anderson's presentation seemed primarily de­
voted to the responsibility of the Indians and the limita­
tion of what was described as a modest business, emphasiz­
ing the fact that at the present time his tribal clients
limit sales to three cartons of cigarettes apiece and
that it was only on that basis that the District Court
j

permitted the tax.

That is demonstrably not the case, as

there is no limitation in the Yakima ordinances which were
upheld at exactly the same time and in the same set of
!

cases by the District Court.
As a matter of fact, there is a showing in the
record of the extremely long distances which people drive
to purchase on the Yakima Reservation not only .for their
own use but for the use of their friends and neighbors.
He also seemed to say, I believe, Mr. Rehnquist,
that somehow or another that, while Footnote 17 in the Moe

55
case stated that tax exemptions to Indians on reservation
had only a statutory basis, that tax exemptions to nonIndians had a constitutional basis, which seems to me to be
relatively inconsistent.
Finally, each of my opponents here has attempted
at one stage or another to avoid the logical extension of
their argument In dealing with how many economic enter­
prises the tribe could engage in, displacing ■— to take
state tax authority over its own residents

For example,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, when you asked Mr. Claiborne the
V

hypothetical of the manufacturing enterprise controlled by
the tribe on reservation, he said that the state could
impose its use tax after its citizens had purchased those
automobiles and removed them from the reservation because
you didn't include a tribal tax in your hypothetical.
Clearly, his answer would have been that were
there even the most modest tribal taxes, that that enter­
prise too would be tax free.

As a matter of fact, he made

that quite express when later on in his presentation he
stated that in all probability that the state faxes would
be invalid without a tax by the Indian tribes simply be­
cause of the tribal participation in the sale, i

While each of these gentlemen has stated that
they do not seek here to reargue or to reverse law, in
effect every one of them, every one of their arguments for

56
all practical purposes requires reading Moe out of the
United States reports.
The pure fact that the matter is that I do agree
with Mr. Claiborne on one statement only, and that is, of
course, that the state could have the same effect on
tribal businesses simply by repealing its tax.

What that

shows more clearly than anything else is the fact that the
state tax system is not an interference with tribal selfgovernment, because the effect of a state action is
identical in either event.

If the state has the right

to make one decision, it clearly ha3 the right to make
another.
Nothin in the state’s program here prohibits
any type of regulation of business on reservations by the
Indian tribes, nothing in our submission here prohibits
them from adding markups or taxes to their tribal enter­
prises .

We simply say that they are subject to the same

economic constraints that a state is in a taxing policy.
A state can certainly impose a tax which will be selfdefeating because It will be scKhlgh that people will not
purchase either the commodity or the commodity in a par­
ticular place.

State legislatures must deal with that

question every day of the week, and we simply say that
tribal councils must do so, too, and do not have a con­
stitutional right in effect to be parasites on the state

57
system, gaining from the state system only because of
rational state decisions in connection with its own tax
authority.

They do have a retained right in self-govern­

ments that right does not however include the right to
distort a state tax system and to make it either ineffec­
tive or unjust.
QUESTION:

General Gorton3 before you sit down9

do you view the issues on the motor vehicle excise tax
scheme ■— that is still before us, I guess.
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

They are.
We haven't talked about them very

much this morning, but aren't they essentially the same
as the others?
MR. GORTON:

They are essentially the same.

The question in the motor vehicle excise tax is simply
the incidence of the tax.

The Montana tax which you
5

voided in Moe was clearly a property tax imposed on the
reservation.

The state tax in this case is; a pure use

tax which applies when the automobile is used off of the
reservation in the state of Washington.

Our tax could

not be applied to on-reservation uses of an automobile
exclusively if they —
QUESTION:

Well, it is not the typical use tax

that is paid, a one-time tax in connection with the
transaction, isn't it an annual tax?

58
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

No» no, no.

This is an annual tax.

And its economic incidence, I take it,

is precisely the same as a personal property tax?

It is

based on the percentage of the fair market value of the
vehicle, rather than so much on the horsepower or anything
like that.
MR. GORTON:

That is correct„ but it is expressly

and In our state it always has been, this wasn’t a re­
cent amendment, it is expressly a tax on the right to use
an automobile on the roads of the state of Washington.
QUESTION:

Is that the same way in which the tax

which is collected from non-Indians on motor vehicles is
characterized?
MR. GORTON:

Yes, it is.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case- Is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:26 o’clock a.m., the ease in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
