Mr. Carr, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN K. CARR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CARR:

Thank you, sir.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The issue before this Court today is a simple
one.

It; is whether the wife of a harbor worker., a so-

called substitute or Sler&eldt

seaman is entitled to seek

non-pecuniary or sometimes called sentimental damages for
loss" of society or consortium occasioned by her husband's
injury, when the traditional admiralty view as expressed
by Congress in all the applicable maritime statutes pre­
cludes such a right, and especially when the wife of a
blue-water seaman is denied such a right under the Jones
Act.
This case is here on a petition for writ of cer­
tiorari to the New York State Court of Appeals which in a
five-to-one decision granted Juanita Alves the right to
sue for her husband’s loss of consortium occasioned by
his injury.
QUESTION:

Bo you think this is a final decision

*1

for purposes of our jurisdiction?
MR. CARR:

Yes* 1 believe it is, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

All the Mew York Court of Appeals

I

believe —

said was that you shouldn’t have denied the motion to inter­
vene.

No damages have been awarded.
MR» CARR:

Well —

QUESTION:

No determination of negligence has

been awarded.
MR. CARR:

At that time that was the ease, sir.

I might update the Court on subsequent facts, however.
Since the decision of the New York Court of Appeals, this
case proceeded to trial just two weeks ago, and at that
trial Juanita Alvez was permitted to join her husband as
a co-plaintiff.

During the trial, there t*as testimony

from the plaintiff himself that he had been a blue-water
seaman for 26 years and had spent the last Vi of those
years as a boatswain in the highest unlicensed rating
in the deck department.

Mr» Alvez testified that because

of union regulations he had to take his vacation in 1972,
the year of this accident, and that during that vacation
time decided to moonlight as a lasher, not as a seaman.
QUESTION:

This is all testimony that was brought

out at the trial two weeks ago?
MR. CARR:

Yes, sir.

5
QUESTION:

But don't we have to take the case as

It conies to us from the New York Court of Appeals which
rendered its decision sometime previously to two weeks ago?
MRo CARR:

Yes, sir»

But that decision of the

Mew York Court of Appeals decided the issue as far as Mrs.
Alves is concerned concerning her right to sue for loss of
consortium.

As a practical matter, the court during the

trial submitted separate interrogatories to the jury so
that in the event this Court decided she was not entitled
to sue for loss of consortium, the award that the jury gave
her could be remanded at a later date.
QUESTION:

Mr. Carr„ can that case come up here?

MR, CARR:

That case can eventually come up hare,

Your Honor, on other grounds »—
QUESTION:

Well, how could we decide one part

and then any other part?
MR. CARR:

Well, as far as the loss of consortium

claim is concerned, I submit it- is a final decision and one
which this Court must face at this stagec
QUESTION:

It came to the Court of Appeals as a

certified question, did it not?
MR. CARR:

It did, sir.

QUESTION:

As a separate and the only federal

question In the case?
MR. CARR:

Yes. sir.

6
QUESTION:

Correct?

MR. CARR:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

And the Court of Appeals recognised

that It was governed, exclusively by federal law and that
it was the only
MR. CARR:

The only federal question before it.
the only federal question that has

QUESTION:

been raised in this ease and as such separable and unique»
MR. CARR:

That’s correct„ Your Honor.

QUESTION:

But they couldn’t wait?

MR. CARR:

Pardon me?

QUESTION:

They couldn't wait for us to decide

MR. CARR:

Who couldn't wait, Your Honor?

QUESTION:

The court.

MR. CARR:

QUESTION:

court„ or the petitioners or anybody else.
MR. CARR:

Well —

QUESTIOH:

Because you have got a judgment here

that depends on what we say later on.
MR. CARR:

The trial court took that into con­

sideration and felt that the record would be reserved by
the expedient it chose of submitting Juanita Alvez’s claim
to the jury separately

7
QUESTION:

Yes * that is what I mean.

MR. CARR:

So that her claim would be intact upon

its presentation to the Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

And youfre telling us that in a trial

a couple of weeks ago the jury returned a verdict for the
plaintiff on that claim?
MR. CARR:

Yeas sir.

At the trial two weeks ago*

Alves himself received a verdict from the jury on the sole
issue that was given to the jury of unseaworthiness in the
sum of $1 million.

That verdict was reduced by 50 percent

for his contributory negligence.

The separate issue of

Juanita Alveus loss of consortium was also submitted to
the jury after her testimony concerning loss of society
and other effects that her husband's injury had had on
her marriage.

The Jury awarded Juanita Alves $100,000 for

loss of consortium, the non-pecun1ary aspect of her damages,
and reduced that by 50 percent also by virtue of her
husband’s contributory negligence.
QUESTION:

The jury effected this reduction in

both cases?
MR. CARR:

The jury effected this reduction under

the instructions of the court in specific special interro­
gatories.
QUESTION:

Comparative contributory negligence.

MR. CARR:

Yes, sir,

I mean my old

law school bringing up, I am in trouble with that.

Mow,

should we let this verdict that she has color our thinking?
MR. CARR:

Well —

QUESTION:

Should we ignore it if we could?

MR. CARR:

I think that the verdict has to in

some way color the Court’s thinking.
QUESTION:

1 think —

Is the verdict consistent with what

the Court of Appeals of the State of New York decided?
MR. CARR:

Yes, the Court of Appeals decided that

she did have a right to seek non-pecuniary damages.
QUESTION:

The jury was instructed under the

majority opinion of that case, wasn't it?
MR. CARR:

Indeed It. was. sir.

QUESTION:

Then what is left for us to decide at

this stage in this ease?
MR. CARR:

What is left for this Court to decide

is whether in fact she had the right in the first place to
seek consort?.urn damages of a non-pecuniary sort.
QUESTION:

In following Mr. Justice Marshall's

9
question; that is now appealable? and although the Mew York
courts will .hold it is law of the? case, it would remain
open in this case on appeal from that jury verdictwould
it not, in this Court?
MR, CARR:

Well; theoretically if appealed from

that judgment ever got this far, that might be the case.
But we submit that this ha a tidier way of handling the
:: initial question.
QUESTION:

Well, it may be tidier but a lot de­

pends on what Congress has said as to what our jurisdiction
iSc

Have you picked out which of the four exceptions to

finality that this comes under in the Cox Broadcasting
' Company case?
MR. CARR:

No, sir, I have not.

QUESTION:

It is net only what Congress has said,

it really goes to the jurisdiction of this Court which is
confined only to questions of federal law and — it so
happens that there has been a jury award for the plaintiff
and a judgment entered on that jury verdict, but at least
in theory this could have been remanded as it was by the
New York Court of Appeals and there could have been a trial
in which the defendant prevailed, and the federal question
would never have been presented in this case.
MR. CARR:
question here today.

Well, we are not faced with that

In fact, because of subsequent events,

fefe may be faced with it today, but as suggested by my
brother Relinquish*s question, and I must say, none of this
questioning is even implicitly critical of you.

HR. CARR:

Mr. Carr, what happens if the

QUESTION:

That is no way to run a railroad.

MRa CARR:

~ we gave this considerable thought

before the trial and it was the Judgment of those people
involved in the trial, including the trial judge, that
"this particular federal question could be reserved by ap­
proaching it in this particular fashion,

I had supposed

that we were proper in doing that.
QUESTION:

Isn’t any opinion we give — doesn't

it have some resemblance to an advisory opinion on the
pure question of law that the Court of Appeals of the
State of New fork decided?
MR. GARR:

Your Honor., if we had settled the

case during the trial stages and had come before you
seeking your judgment on her cause of action for consortium,
I believe it would have been an advisory opinion and we
should not have attempted to do that.

However, with a

12
final judgment I do not believe that the nature of this
Court's deliberations or determination would be advisory,
QUESTION:

You say final Judgment * you mean the

judgment of the Court of Appeals of New York.
MR. CARR:

No, I mean the final judgment of the

trial court, the Supreme Court of New York County.
QUESTION:

Hot? is that before us except that we

Have heard about it?
MR. CARR:

Well, it is —

QUESTION:

I am, frankly, as others seem to b®,

puzzled about what it is we are being asked to do.

To say

that the Court of Appeals of New York announced the
correct standard as a matter of law?
MR. CARR:

Well —

QUESTION:

Therefore that would tend to give

support to the judgments you have now in the trial.
MR. CARR:

Right, but if in fact, as the New

York Court of Appeals misinterpreted the federal law. as
is our position, then the verdict she received would be
a nullity.
QUESTION:

Mr. Carr, isn't this in terms of our

jurisdiction just as though the intervener had been a
plaintiff who filed a complaint and the district judge
dismissed the complaint and than there was an appeal to
the court of appeals and the court of appeals reversed for

13
a new trial?

Here in effect they reversed and said let the

intervener corns in and have a trial.

la it not perfectly

clear that If there had been a reversal such as I described*
this Court would have jurisdiction?

This Court has many

times taka eases where an original trial dismissal has been
reversed on appeal and sent back for a new trial, and that
Is basically what has happened here.
MR. CARR:

Yes, sir* that sounds analogous.

QUESTION:

Can you give me a case that happened

where it went back and then it came back up here?
MR. CARR:

I can't, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

I'm sure you can't*

And X say again,

I am not blaming this on you. because we granted certiorari*
MR. CARR:

I had expected we has passed beyond

that threshhold. issue —
QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

MR. CARR:

I would like to* if I may, discuss

the merits of the appeal.
QUESTION:

You haven't much time left for that.

MR. CARR:

Any question concerning the claim for

loss of consortium by the wife of an injured harbor worker
has to begin and I submit has to end with the decision of
Judge Friendly in the Igneri case decided in 3-963*

Judge

Friendly recognised that it was a fresh and novel question
when he addressed it at that time, at a time when the

14
common law permitted a wifefs claim for loss of consortium
in only 12 of the states of this nation.

But despite that

fact, Judge Friendly did not dismiss her claim for loss of
consortium but felt it was necessary to examine the de­
cisional maritime law on the issue0

The decisional marl*»,

time law produced only two cases where this particular
question had arisen, and in both of those cases involving
a claim by a wife of loss of consortium, the claim had
been dismissed by the District Court.
So Judge Friendly drew upon analogous maritime
statutes to arrive at his decision, and the statute lie
looked at first and foremost was the Jones Act which was
an act designed initially to remove an anomaly that ex­
isted in the maritime law,

Frior to the passage of the

Jones Act, a longshoremen could bring suit for negligence
against a ship owner, whereas a seaman could not.

In pass­

ing the Jones Act, Congress gave the right to the aeasaan
to sue his employer for negligence, but it did so in a
limited fashion.

It restircted the right to the seaman

himself by the very language of the act, which states any
seaman may bring this cause of action.

As a result, that

act has been interpreted and constantly followed by the
courts as granting only the right t© sue for negligence to
the seaman himself and not to his dependents and not to his
relatives who might otherwise be-entitled to do so were

15
they governed by state statute»
Judge Friendly also was careful to note that the
Jones Act incorporated specifically the terms of the
Federal Employers Liability Act which also restricts re­
covery to the person injured, and this Court so decided in
Tonsellito long before the passage of the Jones Act»

So

judicial construction of the Federal Employers Liability
Act imposed the same restrictions on the Jones Act per­
mitting only suit against the ship owner by the seaman
himself and not by the wife, net by any dependents or
relatives and family.
Using the Jones Act as the analogous law in the
maritime field, Judge Friendly concluded that there was no
right for a wife to sue for loss of consortium in a mari­
time cause of action, arid that scholarly opinion remained
the settled harmonious law in the maritime field until this
Court's decision in 197*1 in the Gaudet case, a wrongful
death action»
It is the petitioner’s position that the Gaudet
case, in a narrow majority ©pinion, finding a right for
loss of consortium in a widow should have that particular
measure of damages confined to the narrow limitations that
Higginbotham later placed upon Gaudet, that is a wrongful
death situation within the territorial waters of the
United States

16
After the Gaudet decision, there were some courts,
lower courts, district and state courts that split just
about evenly on this question as to whether Gaudefc had
actually had any effect on the viability of the Igneri
rule.
The only federal appellate court to address this
question after the Igneri decision, after the Gaudet de­
cision was Christofferson in the Fifth Circuit which found
that Igneri was alive and well.
We believe that it is the abiding concern of
this Court to administer a uniform body of federal law in
the maritime field, and that it is this concern that
prompted the Court to decide the Moragne case the way it
was decided, to reaffirm uniformity in an area that u&s
a patchwork of strange and anomylous results following
the Harrisburg decision which denied the right of wrongful
death recovery under the general maritime law.
QUESTION:

Of course, Gaudet and Higginbotham

together don’t add up to much uniformity, do they?
HR. CARR:
Your Honor.

No.

That :1s one of the problems,

Gaudet kind of set off in a direction that

was without precedent in the maritime field by for the
first time awarding loss of consortium in a wrongful death
situation, contrary to the Death on the High Seas Act,
contrary to the Federal Employers Liability Act, contrary

17
to the Jones Act.

And when this measure of damages was

first examined by this Court subsequently in the Higginbotham
case, Gaudet5s holding on loss of consortium for pecuniary
and non-pecuniary damages was confined to the territorial
waters in wrongful death actions.
QUESTION:

Do you think we should overrule Gaudet?

MR, CARR:

Frankly. I believe overruling Gaudet

would restore harmony and uniformity to this area of law,
and that seems to be one of the ways of avoiding the
anomaly which otherwise exists»
For these reasons, we submit that even if Judge
Friendly were to address the Igneri issue today as he did
in 19633 despite changing times and changing patterns,
womenf3 rights, he would decide the issue exactly the same
way today as he decided it in 19&3, and he indicated as
much in the concluding paragraph of his opinion when
said had the sexes of the parties been reversed, that is,
had Peter Igneri, the husband, been suing for loss of con­
sortium of his wife, Theresa, had she been injured aboard
the vessel, he would have denied a loss of consortium
claim to Pater Igneri even though common law recognised
such a right in a husband.
So that it is the petitioner’s position that
there is no discrimination in Judge Friendlyrs decision
’with respect to the sexes, that he decided the issue before

18
him in an even-handed way, and that it was his Intention to
restore parity between longshoremen and seamen in this area
of non-pecuniary speculative damages.
QUESTION:

Mr. Carr, to what extent do you think

Judge Friendly relied on in an analogy to the common law in
his interpretation of the maritime law?
MR. CARR:

Well, because it was a fresh and a

novel issue, I think he gave scholarly concern to the
common law.

Rut by the same token, since he felt at that

time that the common law was pretty much, of a toss-up, I
don't believe he placed that much reliance on the majority
view in the common law»
QUESTION:

D© you agree that the majority view

in the common law is now somewhat different than it was in

1963?
MR. CARR:

Oh, indeed it is, sir, but I don't

think that has any real bearing because, aa I said, when
he concluded his opinion, he said were the roles of the
sexes reversed he would arrive at the same decision by his
'analogy to the Jones Act,
QUESTION:

Well, whether Judge Friendly would

have done it or not, should this Court be- guided by the
common law in fashioning a somewhat similar body of law in
the maritime area, since we don't have any statutory guid­
ance from Congress?

is
MR. CARR;

Well, I think we have astatutory guid­

ance in areas of the maritime law that are analogous and
those areas specifically are the Federal Employers Liability
Act and the -Tones Act and. the Death on the High Seas Act.
And I feel that those congressional expressions of policy
should be paramount in this Court's determination as to
whether or not such a cause of action exists under the
general maritime law»
i would like to reserve what time I have left for
rebuttals if I may, Your Honor•

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL C. MATTHEWS9 ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MATTHEWS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The decision below of the Mew York State Court
of Appeals places the maritime law in line with the over­
whelming majority of the jurisdictions in the United States.
It places it in line with the restatement of torts which
allows this reiae-dy of loss of society to either spouse for
a serious Injury to the other.
QUESTION:

What do you have to say about whether

we should decide this ease now or wait to see what happens
as it goes up the hierarchy of courts in the State of New

20

York?
HR. MATTHEWS:

of certiorari that there was no question of the jurisdiction
of this Court.

MR. MATTHEWS:

I don't know if It is in keeping with the rules

of this Court, but there is a procedure among the state
courts of the State of New York when this ease came up,
that if the defendant will stipulate to judgment absolute
upon the determination of this Court, that then we would
clearly have a final determination and one which there
would be no danger of becoming soot or coining back to this
Court -QUESTION:

You say stipulate to judgment abso­

QUESTION:

That sort of

I ears51 state that* Your Honor.

Well* it is not either your fault or

opposing counsel’s, aa you say when certiorari is granted
you have a right to assume that there is jurisdiction.
But if you will recall the proceedings this morning, the
Chief Justice announced an opinion for the Court in 'which
the writ of certiorari was dismissed as improvldently
granted, which suggests that we on occasion recognize
mistakes of our own in the exercise of our certiorari
jurisdiction.

And I think the issue of jurisdiction of

this Court ia one which we have to look to as well as you.
MR. MATTHEWS:

Well, as Your Honor could under­

stand, as we counsel stand here before you arguing the
causes of ©ux* clients, we think first in terms of those
rights, as I think properly we should, as attorneys, and
perhaps.we give less consideration to what the Court may
feel Is important as far as the possibility of the issue

I know I could apeak for- myself and

I assume for Mr. Carr, that we would both be bitterly dis­
appointed if the Court did not reach the merits of this
case not only as far as what is an important question with
regard to the rights of the wife of an injured harbor worker,
but also which may involve a serious question as to exactly
what power the highest court of the state has in interpret­
ing the decisions of this Court in the maritime law.

Juanita Alves had to

appeal from the determination made against her by special
tern which denied her the right to become a plaintiff in
this case.

If she did not take that appeal and perfect it

within one year, her appeal would be dismissed and from
there on the matter followed through the appellate processes

of the State of Heu York and the appellate division reversed
and found that there was a right to plead this cause of

QUESTIOH:

Mr. Matthews, you suggested a moment or

two ago that the fact that a trial has been held really
doesn’t have any bearing on the question of whether the
order we are now reviewing or being asked to review was
finale

The question, the jurisdictional question as I under­

stand it is when an aooellafce court remanda a ease for
trial, is that a final order which we can review.

I think

we have done it hundreds and hundreds of times.

I’m sorry, sir, Mr. Justice Stevens,

I’m sorry if I have caused any confusion with respect to my
answer to a previous question.

I meant to say, if I did

misspeak, that I didn’t think that it would have made any
difference whether the trial had been held or whether it
had not been held
QUESTION:

Or had been postponed.

MR. MATTHEWS:

— before the determination of

this hearing®
QUESTION:

In other words, our jurisdiction to

review the order of the New York Court of Appeals remanding
the case to the trial court for trial is unaffected by the
question of whether or not that trial is held before or
after we actually reach argument®

That is your point, I

take it®
MR. MATTHEWS:
QUESTION:

Yes. sir, I —

You’re dead right, and it seems to me

26
we have many, many times reviewed appellate court orders
when the appellate courts have sent a case back for trial»
I think as a matter of discretion it is often unwise for­
us to do so because the case may go away.

You might have

lost this lawsuit and then the case would have become moot»
But I am puzzled about the concern about the finality of
the power to review.
QUESTION:

Prom a state court9 before you have

a final judgmenta the problem isn't just that the ease may
go away but that Congress has said that you have to have a
final judgment in order to bring the ease from the highest
court ©f the state to this Court.
MR. MATTHEWS:

1 regret to say, Your Honor, that

I didn't come here prepared to argue that point, so —
QUESTION:
though.

Wall, perhaps you can help me on this,

Suppose the case had gone back to trial after the

Court of Appeals had for state purposes anyway finally
disposed of the federal question and it said that there
should be a trial and that the complaint could be amended
and the widow should be allowed to try her case, is that
issue any longer open in the state courts ?
MR. MATTHEWS:
QUESTION:

The ~

The issue of whether or not the widow

can state a good cause of action.
MR. MATTHEWS:

I would say that it is — if we

27
have not been foreclosed by the determination of the Court
of Appeals —
QUESTION:

Right»

MR. MATTHEWS:

— and that certainly is a final

action
QUESTION:

You oannot — so in the event If the

case would have come out a certain way in the lower courts,
that issue is definitely foreclosed from any kind of relitigation In the state courts?
MR. MATTHEWS:

I would certainly think so, yes,

sir5»
QUESTION:

Where would this situation be if

after the Court of Appeals opinion had corns down, while
your petition for cert was pending here, the case had been
settled, then we wouldn't have granted the petition for
cert»
MR. MATTHEWS:

We would have been obliged I think,

Mr. Chief Justice, to advise the Court that the ease had
been settled and that the controversy had become moot.
QUESTION:

So far as events within the state of

New York were concerned, everyone would be bound by the
Court of Appeals opinion, whether It was right or whether
it is not right, in a federal sense.
MR. MATTHEW'S:

I feel that that Is a good point,

Mr. Chief Justice, that regardless of whether the controversy

28
had become moot, it would remain the law of the state of
New York and counsel would have the argument that he ad­
vanced in coming before this Court s that this Court should
consider the issue to settle for once and for all what the
rights are under the maritime law.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose no appeal is taken now

from the judgments that were described to us for $55050002
MR. MATTHEWS:

Then certainly you have a final

determination which is —
QUESTION:

Do we?

MR. MATTHEWS:
QUESTION:

Do you not., sir?

Is that judgment before us?

MR® MATTHEWS:

Oh, is it before you here today?

I don*t see how it could be if it is not on this record.
QUESTION:

Would there be anything for us to de­

cide if no appeal is taken?
MR. MATTHEWS:

Well, I certainly felt that if the

defendant consented to the entry of judgment or waived its
right to appeal, that surely that matter would be here
before you.

But as again I say to you, I didn’t com® here

prepared to argue theory, procedural theory on this and I
could be way off.
QUESTION:

May I be heard on the merits or —
0h„ yes, by all means.

MR. MATTHEWS:

I thank you.

I feel that it would

be strange indeed If a progressive and liberal determination

29
of the rights of an injured party which prevails throughout
the land were not to be granted by the maritime law where
this Court certainly in Moragnea unanimous decision9
declared it to be the humanitarian policy to grant a remedy
rather than to withhold it9 and I think that it would be
extremely ironic if such a remedy should stop at the water’s
edge*
I think that there is no reason to go on now to
the Gaudet decision in logic or justice to deny the right
to a wife to recover these damages while allowing it to a
widow.

The analogy I think is compelling.

This Court

said in Moragne that in most respects the laws applied in
personal injury cases will govern questions that arise in
death cases.
QUESTION:

Of course, whatever result is reached

here in the light of Gaudet and Higginbotham is going to
be an anomaly9

It is either going to stop at the water’s

edge or it is going to stop at the blue water’s edge, isn’t
it?
MR. MATTHEWS:

Well, I think I will skip ahead

then, if Your Honor please
QUESTION:

Well, why don’t you answer the question

because perhaps I misunderstood.
MR. MATTHEWS:

I heartily disagree with Mr, Carr

that the rights of the blue-water seamen will be-

30
aubstant.ia3.ly differant than those of longshoremen or
harbor workers.
QUESTION:

Mr. Matthews* isn't it pretty clear

under the Death on the High Seas Act as well as the Jones
Act that there is no recovery for loss of consortium?
MR. MATTHEWS:

Well, it certainly has been af­

firmatively determined by this Court in Higginbotham that
under the Death on the High Seas Act no such right exists„
And it is clear enough that this Court 65 years ago in
Michigan v. Yreeland determined that no such right existed
under the FELA.
QUESTION:

Which was incorporated in the Jene3

Act.
MR. MATTHEWS:

Yes* sir.

Yes* sir.

This Court

found no difficulty in overruling the Harrisburg ease
when that ancient —
QUESTION:

That did not involve a statute.

MR. MATTHEWS:

It did not involve a statute* but

Michigan v« Yreeland involved interpretation of a statute.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. MATTHEWS:

But interpretation* Your Honor,

not in any words where the statute had restricted the
amounts that could be recovered.

But if I could, I think

I am now in my discussion on that, to the statutory Jones
Act aspects of things —

31
QUESTIOH:

And Death on the High Seas Act.

MR. MATTHEWS:

Yes, sir, and I didn’t mean to con­

fine myself to that because, as this Court recognised in
Moragne , the unseaworthiness remedy has now become the pri­
mary vehicle for the blue-water seamen in recovering for
his damages.

In other words, the burden of proof of un­

seaworthiness is so much less than that of proving negligence
that it is the rare case where there will b® recovery under
negligence and not under unseaworthiness.
QUESTION;

If there is an anomaly resulting be­

cause of Higginbotham, isn’t that an anomaly that could be
corrected by Congress?
MR» MATTHEWS:

It is an anomaly that could be

corrected with ail due respect by this Court by simply
overrruling Michigan v. Vreeland.

I think that the Inter­

pretation of —
QUESTION:

Well, we are still in a statutory

construction case.
MR. MATTHEWS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Unlike Moragne.

MR. MATTHEWS:

Unlike Moragne, yes, sir.

I

think that in construing the Jones Act in times past, this
Court has found no difficulty in going beyond the bar®
bones of the words of the statute.

In Maryland Casualty v.

Cushing, this Court held that the Jones Act was broad enough

32
to embrace an action not against the employer but against
the insurance company»

And in Kernan v. American Dredging,

this Court felt that although the PELA mentioned negligence,
that that was bread enough to include a non-negligent
violation of a statute,
QUESTION:

Well, it is one thing to construe a

statute broadly. It is another thing to overrule a previous
construction of the same statute, Is it not?

The eases you

mentioned were not overruling previous statutory construe»
tlon.
MR. MATTHEWS:

I would have to concede that point,

yes, sir.
I would like to indicate that in two cases cited
in the brief. It is clearly pointed out, one of them being
the Teacc case, that since i:c can perceive no logical,
sound or reasonable basis to differentiate between the case
where the husband was killed as contrasted to injured in
respect to the, wife’s entitlement to recover for loss of
consortii a, we conclude that Ignerle has been overruled
by Sealand Services as construed by Skidmore.

And also in

the Lemon case, also cited I believe in both briefs, the
opinion of the Chief Judge for the Southern District of
Georgia, "I am unable to see the rationality of a. rule that
if a defendant’s negligence causes death, consortium can be
recovered by the widow, but where It only results in injury

33
a wife cannot.”
I take great issue with my brother, Mr. Carr, with
regard to the situation as far as the Ignerie decision is
concerned,.

The decision by Judge Friendly in the Ignerie

case was by no means a dogmatic decision.

It was an invi­

tational decision, because in the decision it mentioned the
common law by saying afe least this much Is true, if the
common law recognised a wife's claim for loss of consortium,
uniformally or nearly so, a United States admiralty court
would approach the problem here by asking itself why it
should not likewise do so»

If the common law denied such a

claim, uniformally or nearly so, the inquiry would foa
whether there was sufficient- reason for an admiralty court's
nevertheless recognising one.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there

at 1:00 o'clock, and you have about nine minutes left.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o'clock meridian, the court
was in recess, to reconvene afe 1:00 o'clock p.sa., the same
day„)

3^

AFTERNOON SESSION -- I;00 0»CLOCK P.M.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. MATTHEWS:

You may continue.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This morning I had already discussed the compelling
analogy between the right of the widow t© recover for loss
of society and that of a wife of a badly crippl.ed worker9
I would like to spend the remainder of my time discussing
the decision of Judge Friendly in the Ignerie case, discuss­
ing the Christofferson case, and discussing the contentions
of the petitioner with regard to the uniformity.
With regard to Ignerie, I believe that the de­
cision of Judge Friendly was not in any way dogmatic, did
not intend to be engraved in stone, but rather was invita­
tional arid that it left open a door through which the Alves
court, the Court of Appeals for the State of New York
stepped through in the decision below.
Judge Friendly wrote in Ignerie, "If there were
evidence that maritime law generally recognised a claim for
negligent injury to such an intangible right, or if the
common law clearly authorised a wife’s recovery, the
gravitational pull of such concepts with respect to the
wife of a longshoreman might be stronger than that of the
analogy to the statute denying such a recovery to a seaman’s
wife

9S

35
At that time* in 19$>3, when Judge Friendly wrote
those words, 19 jurisdictions had denied the remedy.

Of

those 19, today 15 have reversed the law so that we have at
the present time only four jurisdictions of those 19, plus
one additional, that being Louisiana where the right has
been denied.
In addition. Judge Friendly indicated that the
rights were too personal, too intangible and too conjectural
to be determined by a jury, but that contention was answered
by this Court in Gaudet which indicated that the same argu­
ment could be made with regard to any damages for pain and
suffering and which indeed indicated that for many, many
years, Indeed centuries, that courts and juries had been
called upon to pass upon the right for5 loss of consortium,
With regard to a contention I think that was
made or a mention in Judge Friendly’s opinion, that the
damages were paras! ic in nature, this I think was well
answered by the court below, by Judge Jasen who said,
referring to a wife, in the good times she lights the
hearth with her own inimitable glow, but when tragedy
strikes it is part of her unique glory that forsaking
the shelter, the comfort, the warmth of the home, she
puts her arm and shoulder to the plow.
heart of the issue.

We are now at the

When her husband’s love is denied her,

his strength sapped and his protection destroyed, in short,

36
when she has been forced by the defendant to exchange a
heart for a husk, we are urged to rule that she has suffered
no loss compensable at the law.

But 1st some scoundrel

dent a dishpan in the family kitchen and the law in all its
majesty will convene the court,, will march with measured
tread to the halls of justice and will there suffer a jury
of her peers to assess the damages.

Why are we asked then

in this case to look the other way?

Is this what is meant

when it is said that justice is blind?”
QUESTION:

Mrc Matthews, do you know any way we

can get Congress to pass on this?
MR, MATTHEWS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor --

I mean the more you go on with it, it

seems like something Congi’ess should get into.
MR, MATTHEWS:

I think. Your Honor, that Congress

has quite clearly delegated this area to this Court, and I
think that in the Fltsgerald case this Court recognised
f

its duty and its responsibility in that area.

So I don’t

think it is something that in any means is within the
province of Congress.
QUESTION:

I —*
Do you think Congress could not pass

a law saying the right of consortium shall not be a compen­
sable element in an action like this?
MR, MATTHEWS:

Of course they could do so, but

the fact that they have not done a© one way oif the other

37
is nothing that should be influential on this Court,
this Court indicated in the opinin

As

in Moragne, Congress

has specifically left to this Court the duty in the mari­
time law of declaring what the rights of injured persons
should be.
QUESTION:

That is not quite the same as saying

it is not within the province of Congress.
MR. MATTHEWS:
deny that* sir.

Of course.

I would be the last to

This Court indicated in Moragne that cer­

tainly it better becomes the humane and liberal characterof proceedings in admiralty to give then to withhold the
remedy when not required to do so by established and in­
fles ibis rules.
The basis for the statement that a blue-water
seaman dees not have or the wife of a blue-water seaman
does not have this right is in the Christofferson case,
where the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit considered
the right of the wife on three grounds.

First, they con­

sidered the Jones Act, which they found did not allow this
remedy, based upon Judge FriendlyTs decision in Ignerle.
Secondly, they found that with respect to the claim for
unseaworthiness, there was no right because of the decision
of Judge Friendly in Ignerle.

And thirdly, they found that

there was no right under the law of the State of Louisiana
where the Injury had. occurred by examining the state law.

38
This I thinks without trying to read their minds, had to do
probably with the decision of this Court in Just v. Chambers
which indicated that the law of the states may be used to
fill in voids in the maritime law.
So we have a situation where, according to the
Christoffarson case, in some

of the jurisdictions of

this country, such a remedy would be allowed„
In the name of uniformity, the petitioner in this
case would have you to turn bad: the clock on almost half a
century of progressive decisions, affirming the concern of
admiralty for the welfare of those injured within its juris­
diction.
I would just point out; further that aligning the
maritime law with the overwhelming majority of states will
eliminate confusion where a single injury may result from
violation of duties owed under state law by one defendant
and maritime law by another, and it would be a situation
sim‘lar to that which is involved in the Consolidated
Machines case cited by the petitioner in its brief.
How, if 1 have any time left, I Mould mention
what I concede to be the role of the Court of Appeals of
the State of Mew York.
QUESTION:

You have until the red light goes on.

MR. MATTHEWS:

course, could not affect the substantive decision of this

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Bo you have anything further, Mr. Carr?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN K. CARR, ESQ.,,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. CARR:

Yes, sir, just a few words.

The respondent would urge that no distinction be
made between the measure of damages in the fatal and non­
fat al injuries.

In doing so, he would ask the Court to

make a distinction between longshoremen and the wives of

longshoremen and seamen and thslr wives.
It Is petitioners position that it makes eminently
better sense if a distinction has to be made to make that
distinction between life and death than it does to make an
artificial distinction between longshoremen and their
proginy and their wives and seamen and their wives.
The longshoremen*s rights are a derivative from
seamen and to elevate the status of a longshoreman and his
wife to a position above the employee from whom he derives
hia rights makes no sense at all»
If respondent’s posit5.on ware to be accepted, it
would mean that every time a longshoreman is injured, whether
it be a bump, a scrape, a laraeration, a bruise, he would
be accompanied in his lawsuit by a spouse seeking sentiments.!
