ORAL ARGUMENT OA ANDREW L„ FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on the governments petitioner
for a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,

That court granted

respondent collateral relief from his conviction on the
grouhd that certain testimony admitted at his trial of a
ia.il cellmate was admitted in violation of his Sixth
Amendment right to counsel.
In the fall of 1972, respondent was arrested and
indicted on a charge of participation in a bank robbery in
Norfolk, Virginia.

At his trial some months later, the

prosecution*s evidence included the testimony of two in­
dividuals who had been cellmates with the respondent at
the Norfolk Jail during the period between respondentTs
indictment and his trial.
was a government informant.

One of the cellmates, Nichols,
The other, Sadler, was not,

Both men testified about damaging admissions that the

x^espondent had made to them which indicated that he was a
participant in the bank robbery.
Several years later„ respondent filed a motion for
collateral relief in which he charged for the first time,
■among other things, that the admission of Nichols' testimony
violated his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of
counsel.

His motion was denied, but on appeal the Court of

Appeals remanded for an evidentiary inquiry into the claim.
On remand, the District Court again denied the motion without
a hearing on the basis of affidavits submitted by two FBI
agents regarding the nature of their contacts with, the wit­
ness Nichols.
The .significant affidavit for purposes of this case
was that of Agent Coughlin.

Perhaps the best way to put the

issue that is before the Court today Into focus is If I read
the pertinent excerpts from his affidavit, which begin at
page 57A of the Appendix, the Petition for a Writ of Certio­
rari .
Agent Coughlin averred that,-.’ "On November 21,
1972, I contacted Edward Benjamin Nichols at the Norfolk
City Jail,

Nichols had been contacted by me for approxi­

mately a year prior to this and during my contacts with him,
he had provided confidential information to the FBI,'' and
had been paid for it.
"At the time I contacted Nichols, Nichols advised

5

that he was in the same cellblock as Billy Gale Henry as wall
as other prisoners who had federal charges against them.

I

recall tailing Niehcds at this time to be alert t6 any state­
ments made by these individuals regarding the charges against
them»

I specifically recall telling Nichols that he was not

is question Henry or these individuals about the charges
against them, however, if they engaged him in conversation or
talked in front of him, he was requested to pay attention to
their statements.

X recall telling Nichols not to initiate

any conversations with Henry regarding the bank robbery
charges against Henry, but that if Henry initiated the con­
versations with Nichols, I requested Nichols to pay atten­
tion to the information furnished."
The affidavit goes on to relate the provision of
information by Nichols to the agent after Nichols got out
of jail, and then it; states, on page 59a, "Nichols was paid
by the FBI for expenses and services in connection with the
requests that Henry had made of him in jail and for the in­
formation furnished by Nichols."
Finally, it says?
"I never requested anyone affiliated with the
Norfolk City Jail to place Edward Benjamin Nichols in the
same cell with Henry."
Now, on the basis essentially of this affidavit,
the district court denied relief, and on exactly the same

6
basis, the court of appeals majority upheld respondent’s
Sixth. Amendment claim.
The court described the issue before it as whether
undisclosed government monitoring of respondent’s conversa­
tions while he was in custody violated his right to counsel.
In responding to the government's argument based on
the language in Brewer v. Williams, suggesting that some form
of interrogation is a prerequisite to finding a Massiah vio­
lation, the court held that requirement satisfied by general
conversation.

The holding which is under review today may

perhaps best be summarised in the following statement from the
Court of Appeals opinion;
"In the instant case, even if we assume that Nichols
obeyed his instructions not to interrogate Henry about the
bank robbery, Nichols did testify that he engaged in conver­
sation with his cellmate Henry.

If by association, by general

conversation, or both, Henry developed sufficient confidence
in Nichols that Nichols bared" -- excuse me — "that Henry
bared his incriminating secrets bo an undisclosed paid in­
former, we think that .there was interrogation within the mean­
ing of Brewer, and therefore a violation of the Massiah doc­
trine ."
QUESTION;

Do you think this is basically a ques­

tion of fact or law?
MR. FREY;

A question of law, as the case now

7
stands.

Unfortunate!;/, the facts are not very well devel­

oped.
QUESTION:

They aren't.

MR. FREY:

But in effect, what happened was the

Court of Appeals granted summary judgment against us, deter­
mining that the mere fact that Nichols was an informant, that
he shared the cell with Henry, and that ha engaged in general
conversation —
QUESTION:

You don't mean in any technical sense

that the Court of Appeals granted summary judgment against
you, did they?
MR. FREY:

They granted relief without a. hearing

having been held on the facts.

In other words, they granted

relief on the assumption that the fact that there was associa­
tion and general conversation was sufficient to make out a
violation of the Messiah doctrine.
QUESTION:

Has this Court ever held who has the

burden of proof in a Federal habeas action?
MR. FREY:
burden of proof1

The habeas petitioner would have th©

However, if as here was the case it was

conceded the operative facts on which the decision of the
court of appeals rested are conceded by the government, and
I think they are, then this court can review the question of
whether -the court of appeals was correct in saying that was
enough to grant relief.

8

Now, in dealing with the issue posed by this case,
I think there are two different sets of variables to be con­
sidered:

Th® first sat involves the manner in which the wit­

ness came to share s. cell with the defendant and agreed to
testify at trial on the prosecution’s behalf,
Th® one extreme is a case like Milton v. Wainwright,
where an undercover officer posing as a fellow initiate is de­
liberately placed in the defendant’s cell.
QUESTION:

Do you think the case turns on whether

he was deliberately placed there or -—
MR-.- PREY:

We don’t think the case turns on that,

That is, w® think that there would have to bs a reversal in
either event.

But in this case, as the record now stands,

there is no evidence that he was deliberately placed in there
for the purpose of extracting statements from the respondent.
QUESTION:

So we should decide the case or the as­

sumption, among other things, that he was deliberately placed
there?
MR. FREY:

Ho, I don’t think if that is

QUESTION:

You say it doesn’t make any difference,

so it doesn’t make —
MR. FREY:

We sav that you could not sustain the

decision of the Court of Appeals even if he were deliberately
placed there, but I'm not sure that it would make no dif­
ference.

It’s a little hard for me —

9

QUESTION:

I thought that3s what you did say.

MR» FREY;

We believe we should win even if he were

deliberately placed there as long as there was not the kind
of deliberate elicitation or interrogation that —
QUESTION;

Well now, Massiah didn’t require interro­

gation, did it?
MR. PREY;

Well, I would be happy to discuss that

now, if yousd like.
QUESTION;

You are going to direct yourself to

MR. PREY;

I certainly will direct myself to that.

that?

Apart from the situation where an officer is put
in the cell, as in Milton, at the other extreme is the not
uncommon situation where a cellmate of a defendant comes to
the authorities, tells them that the defendant is talking
about the crime with which he is charged, and offers to in­
form the authorities about the defendant's statements.

This

case is somewhere in between those two extremes.
QUESTION;

Well, in that latter case, if that's

all he did, and 'then informed the authorities of the state­
ments -MR. FREY;

No, l?m talking about statements that

QUESTION;

— that he had made, then he wouldn't

10

MR. FREY:

Thera would be no problem; it would be

the statements made thereafter.
QUESTION:

Oh.

That’s different.

MR. FREY:

Thera would be no issue as to statements

already made.
Now. the second kind of variable, and the one that
is perhaps in the forefront of the present case concerns the
nature of the relationship or interaction between the witness
and the defendant.
along the spectrum.

Again the possibilities can be arrayed
At one end of the spectrum is an informant

in an adjoining cell to the defendant’s who simply overhears
incriminating statements but has no interaction whatsoever
with the defendant.

At the other end is the situation in

Milton in which an extended and calculated effort is made to,
quote, "open the defendant up" by repeated questioning about
the crime of which the defendant stands charged.
Now, unless the rationale underlying the Messiah
doctrine is to be entirely reexamined, it sesits clear that
the Milton situation constitutes a denial of the right to
counsel.
Conversely, I see absolutely nothing in the Court's
opinions on the subject to suggest that the purely passive
overhearing of conversations between the defendant, and some
third party other than the defendant's lawyer could properly
be held, to evade the right to counsel.

11
QUESTION?

What would you say about placing a

transmitter right in the cell; not a person? a transmitter?
MR. PREY:

I would say that would not violate the

Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
ment questions.

They might be Fourth Amend­

That is similar to the issue in the Hearst,

Patty Hearst case, in the 9th Circuit, and we believe that that
was correct!y decided by the 9th Circuit.
QUESTION:

When you say a third party, do you draw

any distinction between a third party who is paid by the
government and a third party who is just another convict, so
to speak?
MR. FREY:

Well, that's — I think it's clear that

if he speaks to another convict, who is not a government
agent, there is no Messiah issue whatsoever.

So I <ua assum­

ing in this hypothetical that the agent is silent in the
next cell, or a prison guard who walks by and overhears a
statement — that is, I am talking about obtaining a state­
ment with absolutely no active effort on the part of the
\

government, and I view that as one polar extreme and the ac­
tive effort to "open up” the defendant by intensive interro­
gation about the offense to be the other polar extreme.
QUESTION:

But there's ho question this man was a

government agent?
MR. FREY;
government agent.

There's no question that this man was a

12

QUESTION:

And being paid?

MR. FREY:

Well, we know that he was paid at some

point for the information that he provided.
QUESTION:

And he was paid for listening but not

asking questions?
MR. FREY:

That's what he was instructed to do.

QUESTION:

And do I assume from that that if he said

he did ask questions, he wouldn't be paid?
MR. FREY:

I don't know.

QUESTION:

Well, if ha didn't ask questions, he'd

be like, he'd be in a passive role like the transmitter bug,
wouldn't he?
MR. FREY:

That would be true.

QUESTION:

But you say the transmitter would bs all

right, too?
MR. FREY:

I think that there .is no basis in any

of this Court's decisions to suggest that the transmitter
would violate the right to counsel.

And while the opinion of

the Court of Appeals initially cast the issue in terms of
monitoring the defendant's conversations, I don't think even
its decision really can be read to hold that mere overhearing
violates the right to counsel.

They relied on also the fact

that there was conversation between the witness informant axid
the clef end ant.
It is clear, however, that the Court did not

13
.

require that the conversation relate in any way to the de­
fendant's case.

Accordingly, the narrow question before the

Court is whether general conversation about sports, the
weather, or other neutral topics makes any incriminating
statements thereafter volunteered by the defendant to a cell­
mate inadmissible.
Now, as I understand it, the Court of Appeals
•theory for finding a violation in such circumstances is that
by manifesting friendliness, the informant will have created
an atmosphere in which the defendant is more likely to trust
him and to reveal incriminating information.
Now, it seems plain to me. that the Court of Appeals
decision cannot be squared either with the past descriptions
of the kind of conduct that the Messiah rule prohibits or
with the right to counsel rationale of -that rule.

Looking

first at what the court has said is prohibited, the Massiah
opinion speaks of deliberate elicitation.

Now, elicitation

is a somewhat vague term, but to me it clearly suggests some
kind of drawing out, of overcoming some resistance to speak,
or at least of constructing same artificial situation that is
particularly likely to produce the desired statements.
Massiah, in fact, involves specific questioning of
the defendant about the crime by the informant.

And in

Brewer, the court made quite clear that interrogation or
something quite like it is the touchstone for finding of

14
violation of the right to counsel.
QUESTION;

Well, was that the holding, do you think?

MR. PREY:

Well, the holding is that the right to

counsel is violated by what was tantamount
QUESTION:

By interrogation.

MR. FREY:

-- to interrogation.

QUESTION:

But it didn't — is there something —

However ~

is there any case that — I guess if there were a case, we
wouldn't be here — saying that no violation if no .interro­
gation?
MR. FREY:

There is no case of this Court saying

that there's no violation in any circumstances that have been
before this Court.
QUESTION:

There was no interrogation as such in

Mass!ah itself, was there?

And certainly there wasn't in

McLeod v. Ohio?
MR. FREY;

There's nothing in McLeod to suggest

that there was not interrogation.

If you go back to the

opinion of the Ohio court the court does refer to the statemerits having been voluntarily made, but I believe in context
that is a reference to their having been uncoerced, and not
a reference to their having been spontaneous.
The issue in McLeod., and this is a problem in deal­
ing with a summary disposition without opinion, is that the
Ohio Supreme Court held in McLeod that an indictee!, defendant

15
who did not yet have counsel did not have the right to counsel
under Massiah, so that it's hard to tell what the court's re­
versal was based on.

And there was another summary reversal in

which it was even clearer that there was not interrogation,
wasn't there?MR. FREY:

Wall.? the Beatty case —

QUESTION:

MR. FREY:

defendant tell you facts about the crime violates Massiah.

QUESTION:

He5s a legal stool.

MR. FREY:

Well, let me com® back to make the

point that I slightly lost touch with hare about what Brewer
does hold in response to Justice White's question.
It's true that the state lost Brewer, but it is al­
so true that the opinion in Brewer makes clear that there
was both extended association and general conversation over
a wide-ranging variety of topics, and yet the Court said
that, these ingredients alone would not have rendered
Williams' incriminating statements and actions admissible,
at least that is how I read the statement by the Court, that
no constitutional protection would have come? into play if
there had been no interrogation.
Now, there would hardly have bean any need for the
Court in Brewer to engage in fcha extended analysis of whether
the Christian burial speech constituted interrogation if the
mere fact that Detective Captain Learning was in the car and
being friendly to Williams was enough to cause any statements
that Williams made to violate Messiah.
QUESTION:

Is -the statement of the defendant that

the conversation was in reality a form of interrogation dis­
puted categorically anywhere, or other than —
MR. FREY:

The statement in this case?

QUESTION:

I'm referring to the concurring opinion

13
of Judge Bufczner who says,

"Nevertheless, absent testimony

by the informant, *! where he suggested that there should have
been a hearing by the district judge on this issue,

"absent

testimony by the informant about what he said to the de­
fendant, the judgment must be reversed because of the inform­
ant’s admission, that ha had conversed with the defendant and
because of the defendant's assertion that the conversation
was a form of questioning."
Is that disputed?
MR. PREY:

I have to say •—»

QUESTION:

Did the informant dispute that at any

MR. PREY:

Well, I think we do dispute it.

point?

. QUESTION:
MR. FREY;

But did the informant?
Well, the .informant, we don’t have an

affidavit from the informant in the record in this case.

All

wa have is the testimony of the informant at. trial, and I
don’t recall that the testimony specifically denied interro­
gating him.

But I do find Judge Butzner's opinion very

strange in this regard, that the assertion of the petitioner
in a 2255 petition that there was interrogation, which is a
legal term about which much ink has been spilled by the
scholars after Brewer v. Williams should be dispositive of
, this case.
Let me try to address a point that Justice Stewart

19
made about the turning from Brewer itself to the Sixth
Amendment policies that underlie the right to counsel
principle that's involved here.

The mainstream of the Court's

Sixth Amendment cases have, starting with Powell v. Alabama,
have dealt with the formal judicial proceeding,, that is
various stages of pre-trial, which have a degree of formal­
ity where the defendant is facing unfamiliar surroundings,
complex legal issues, and an experienced prosecutor.
QUESTIONS-

That’s what generally follows an in­

dictment, isn't it?
,

MR.
FREY:
’r

Yes.

Those are things that do follow

ra indictment.
QUESTION:

The administration of the criminal law.

MR. FREY;

Yes, they do.

QUESTION:

then a person's indicted, it is followed

by formal judicial proceedings in an open courtroom where
there are all sorts of constitutional rights to counsel, to
confrontation —
MR. FREY;

That's true,

QUESTION;

—- .j„t*£ open to the public, and it's

presided over by a judge.
MR. FREY:

Well, if I can — I agree with that com­

pletely, and in those cases the need for counsel is obvious
when we are talking about those proceedings.
QUESTION:

The courtroom isn't always open to the

20

public, of course, is it?
MR. PREY:

Well, I'd rather not get into

(Laughter.)
MR. FREY:

To me, the reasons for implicating the

right to counsel in the Massiah setting are less obvious than
they are in the formal judicial proceeding setting.

And

neither Massiah nor Brewer undertake a detailed analysis of
the connection between the suppressed statements and the
role that counsel would play.
QUESTION:

Well, have you read the final paragraph

in the Spano concurrence?
MR. FREY:

I was coming to that; I was about to say

that I think the best sources for understanding the applicable
policies are your concurring opinion in Spano and the Court's
opinion in Ash.
Mow, Ash speaks of trial-like confrontations, and
.is I read the Spano opinion, it focuses on the notion that
extra-judicial interrogation of the accused, which was un­
questionably what there was in Spano, constitutes in effect
a pre-trial trial, a trial outside the trial, to invert the
Hamlet metaphor.
Now, bringing these notions to bear upon the pre­
sent case, I don't think that there is anything about asso­
ciation and general conversation among cellmates in a jail
that remotely resembles the trial-type confrontation that

21
brings the requirement that counsel be present into play.
It seems to me that only if there is specific questioning by
a government agent designed, to elicit information about the
offense,, or some other actions or statements uniquely likely
to draw the defendant out on the subject? to overcome his
reticence to reveal what he knows? that we have -the necessary
conditions for recognition of the right to counsel? that we
have a basis to say,

“Yes? this is really part of the trial?

this is a critical stage of the prosecution,81 which is the
standard that has been «3sad in Sixth Amendment ca«es.
Now, it's true I think that when he makes a confees ion to a cellmate who is going to report it, that is
critical, but it is .not, I believe, a stag® of the prosecu­
tion, unless it emerges out of a proceeding that in some way
resemb3.es a trial-type proceeding.

And at least that's the

way I read Spano and Ash.
Now, in the present case, the record is entirely
consistent with the conclusion that respondent was quite
willing to volunteer information about the crime, and that
neither specific interrogation nor any kind of trick was
necessary to draw him out on the subject.
Accordingly, I think the record falls far short
of justifying the relief accorded him by the Court of
Appeals.

I mean, we can spin endless hypotheticeIs about things that

would or would not be the kind of trial-like confrontation for
which counsel is thought to be justified under the Mas slab
doctrine.
QUESTION:

Wall, these were questions used and

certainly language is drawn out, elicited, interrogated —
do you conceive those to be just used in the ordinary dictionary sense of the word, or do you conceive them to be words
of art representing various places along the spectrum that
you *ve described?
MR. FREYs

Well, I am frankly somewhat at a loss,

because the sources in terms of this Court’s decisions to
draw or. are relatively limited in terms of an explication of
what the concept of deliberately elicited means.

I think

that —
QUESTION:

That was the word in Messiah,, I gather.

MR. FREY:

That was the expression in Messiah,

of that car in New York City.
HR. FREY:

It didn’t say deliberately elicited or

QUESTION:

Well, and what's it — well, I’ll have

to read it.
MR. FREY:

I moan, in my view, I confess that I

have soma difficulty in evaluating our brief addresses this
somewhat, what the connection is between the right to counsel
and the right not to have these statements admitted.
In trying to discern it and looking at the sources
that have explained it, the best I can come up with, in my
understanding, is this notion that what is going on cutsid®
the trial bears the characteristics that sufficiently resemble
a trial that a lawyer should .be there.

It's clear, in --

QUESTIONs

And in fact received information and in

fact was paid for it.

The only missing link is exactly how

did he get it.
MR, FREY;

Well, I think — our position is that

QUESTIOH;

it's kind of hard to draw a constitution­

al line on just suggesting, getting a lot of conversation that
will sooner or later draw out. the statement —
MR. FREY;

The difficulty is that the alternative

is, it seems to ms, to push these principles to their logical
«rarer esae because of the difficulty of drawing a line, and to
end up with the situation where you simply can't overhear
the defendant, I mean. -QUESTION;

Well, it's easy to draw a line between

somebody who "was not in contact with the government before
and didn't have a motive to do that —
MR. FREY;

I understand, but the government, doesn’t

26
have to stop investigating the crime because the defendant
t

has been indicted.
QUESTION:

Well, but it has to stop taking him off

by himself and asking him questions, at least that much.
MR. FREY:

Well, but that ~

QUESTION:

It has to give Miranda —

MR. FREY;

that is what Massiah and Brewer held.

We can’t take him off by himself and ask questions, but in
this case w© are talking about four or five cell mates in a
cell in the Norfolk Jail who for all we know
QUESTION:

But you don't have a man under indict­

ment and in custody unless you’ve got a pretty well made
case, do you?
MR. FREY;

Wall, that is not — well, usually, by

the time of indictment, although often there are cases where
more evidence would be very helpful at getting ail accurate
outcome of the trial.

Let me just turn to ray second point

for on® minute because my time•is short,

and that is the

question of the scopa of the agency of the informant, and
1 just want to make one point.

Her© we had Mr. Nichols in the jail and he knew
from his past experiences — 1 expect most people in jail
cells probably know that if they can provide information
that would be helpful to the prosecution on one of their
cell mates, they could expect some kind of consideration

27
for this information.

I think it is fairly clear that if

Nichols had not talked to Agent Coughlin hut had simply in
the expectation that he would probably get something
listened, the way Sadler did, and then com© forward after­
wards there would fee no issue in this case of a Massiah
violation.
Yet what we have her® is that Nichols and the
agent communicate, the result of this communication is not
really to impart any new information to Nichols that the
FBI would like any confessions that Henry makes, and
Nichols knew that, but to impose constraints on the way
Nichols behaves, to cell Nichols, look, we have to have a
scrupulous regard for the Sixth Amendment rights of this
defendant —
QUESTION:

This is a jail bird and a stool pigeon

and you talk about scruples?
(Laughter)
MR. FREY:

Yes, it seems to me that the agent

certainly was acting scrupulously.
QUESTION:

The government ~

We are talking about -this man who did

the testifying.
MR. FREY:

We are talking about exclusion

QUESTION:

Isn’t it true that if he admitted he

questioned him, he wouldn’t get paid?
MR. FREY:

I can't say that.

I am not —-

QUESTION;

Well, wasn’t ha told not to question

and ha would be paid?
MR. FREY:

He was told not to question him and one

of the issues that we raised —

him.

QUESTION:

And he got paid?

MR. FREY:

And we don’t know that he questioned

That is the very issue in this case.
I would like to reserve what little time I have

left for rebuttal.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Geltner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP MICHAEL E. GELTNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF' OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GELTNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
Ip my view, the Court of Appeals was perfectly
correct both in its view of the law and in its handling of
the ease, given it peculiar procedural history.

If we look

at that procedural history, what we sea is first of all the
fact that the trial testimony of Mr. Nichols --- h€; came
before the jury without any knowledge on the part of the
defense that Mr. Nichols was an informant and because of
that a . deficiency in the development of the record ss to
the way in which he and Mr. Henry interacted.

29

The issue was squarely put by the first motion to
vacate and the District judge dismissed it without a hear­
ing.

The Court of Appeals then remanded to the District

judge with an opinion in which it explained to the District
judge what facts to find* and the District judge, rather
t

than holding an evidentiary hearing„ wrote a letter to the
prosecutor indicating that he believed the matter could be
disposed of without- the necessity of a public hearing and
advised him if the agents did request Mr. Nichols or Sadler
to interview Henrys we probably will have to grant a hearing.
At that point, the affidavit of Agent Coughlin
comes forward and says that he advised Hr. Nichols not to
initiate conversations with regard to the bank robbery or
to question Mr. Henry.

Now, in that light, I think it i3

easy to understand that the Court of Appeals saw the ques­
tion as whether or not the record was adequate for outright
reversal of the conviction or whether, on the contrary, it
made sense to remand one more time for an evidentiary
hearing.
With that in mind, I would like to go on and take
a look at the record because I believe the record strongly
supports the conclusion that the Court of appeals was cor­
rect, no matter how we interpret

tbs Massiah decision.

We know from the record that the bank robbery
ocurred on the 28th of August of 1972, and on that date
>

30
Mr. Moors and Mr. Luck were arrested and charged with the
crime.

On the 22nd of September, a complaint was sworn out

by Agent O’Hara, who is the supervising agent in charge of
the investigation, which indicates that at that time the
case against Mr. Henry consisted of the FBI’s knowledge
that he had participated in a rental of the house on Wales
Avenue in Norfolk at which Mr. Moore and Mr. Luck were ar­
rested .
QUESTION:

Mr. Gelfcner, let me ask you one ques­

tion, referring to a statement you made a couple of moments
ago, as to whether the Court of Appeals should have remanded
for another hearing after the District Court treated them
in the first remand the way it did.

You are net suggesting

here that the present decision under review remanded the
habeas petition for another hearing, are you?
MR. GELTflER:
Honor.

No.

Quite the contrary, Your

The Court of Appeals saw the question as whether

or not the conviction should be set aside or whether or
not a hearing which would have filled out the record on
the interaction between Mr. Henry and Mr. Nichols was
necessary.
QUESTION:

Well, it assumed then all resolved

doubts in favor of the government and nonetheless set the
conviction aside.

MR. GELTNER:

Yes, Your Honor, precisely.

And

31
the point of my summary of the record now is to establish
that the record is quite adequate to support that conclusion.
As I was saying, when the complaint was sworn out
in September, what the case against Mr. Henry consisted of
was evidence that he was connected with the rental of the
house which Mr. Moore and Mr. Luck were found in.

On the

8th of November, the warrant turned up in Atlanta, Georgia,
and on the 10th of November Mr. Henry was arrested in
Atlanta, Georgia.

On the 15th of November, Mr, Henry was

indicted and charged with the crime.
On the 21st of November, 1972, after a period
of transit, Mr. Henry arrived in Norfolk and was put in
the Norfolk City Jail.

At that time, from all we can tell

from the record — and I think the record clearly destablishes
it — the government * s case still consisted of the evidence
that he was a participant in the rental of the hideout.
On the 21st of November, Agent O’Hara visited
Mr. Henry in the Norfolk City Jail, interrogates him a
bit and finally Mr. Henry refuses to answer questions'.

Ac­

cording to Agent O’Hara, in his testimony which is at;
transcript page 106, Mr. Henry stated he would not like to
answer general questions in regards to his activities as he
was afraid we would change his answers around.
On the same day, without any more of a case that
I have already laid out, on the very same day Mr. Coughlin

32

tells us from his affidavit* Agent Coughlin* that he went
to visit Hr. Nichols in the Norfolk City Jail at which tires
he gave him instructions with regard to Mr. Henry9 and
although the affidavit of Agent Coughlin tells us that he
placed limitations on x?hat he wanted Mr. Nichols to dos It
also tells us that he advised Mr. Nichols that there was a.
bank robbery* a bank robbery charge against Mr. Henry* and
what the agency was interested in was getting statements
about the bank robbery.

It was quite clear, even if we

believe Agent Cough]in’s affidavit and all of its nuances,
it is quite clear that he put Mr. Nichols on notice pre­
cisely as to what he wanted.
On the 27th of November, Mr. Henry appeared in
court for arraignment for the — this is the first court
appearance that we know of from the record.

On the morning

he appeared without counsel before Judge HcKensey,

Judge

McK'ensey asked him if he wanted counsel, he said he did,
and Judge McKensey appointed counsel.

There was a recess

taken and Mr. Henry was arraigned that afternoon and ap­
peared in court.
The next thing the record tells us is that on
the 6th of December, Agent Coughlin again visited with
Nichols and Nichols told him what information he had
obtained from Fir, Henry.

The information was essentially

the same information that he testified to at trial.

This

33
we get from Agent Coughlin*s affidavit.
Now* if we — so what we are talking about is the
period of time from the 21st of November through the 6th of
December during the majority of which period Nichols and
Henry and others were in jail together.

Now* if we look at

Nichols’ trial testimony, which admittedly is not laid out
in — admittedly was not the result of specific questioning
on what happened between Nichols and Henry,

we neverthe­

less see that the conversations that occurred between
Henry and Nichols were quite direct and related quite
specifically to the crime in question.
QUESTION:

Mr» Geltner, I understand there is

no question but what Henry had been indicted, but you say
he had been arraigned and counsel had been appointed?
MR. GELTNER:

He was arraigned and counsel was

appointed on the 27th of November.
QUESTION:

Does that appear somewhere here?

I

don?t —
MR. GELTNER:

That appears in the record on

page one of the joint appendix, the second reference,
November 28th, court proceedings, before JAM, who was
Judge MeKens®y.

That should, be November 27th, not 28th,

The appendix is in error.
QUESTION:
record?

I checked

it myself.

The appendix is in error or the

3**

MR. GELTNER:
record Indicates,

The appendix is in eror.

The

he docket sheet- -.tarKSf- .th%- Ttmm&Q indicate

November 2?th.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. GELTNER:

The entry immediately below that,

November 279 CJA 20 appointment and voucher for counseling
services.
QUESTION:

I see that.

MR. GELTNER:

So what we have is the date of

appointment of counsel for sometime in the middle of the
period, during which the jail interrogation eliciting,
obtaining or Whatever occurred.
'

The indictment preceded
h

■

'

the entire period, falling on November 15.
QUESTION:

And then when did Nichols? conversa­

tion® take place, sometime between the 15th and —
MR. GELTNER:

The Nichols conversations with

Henry in the jail cell occurred sometime between the 21st
of November and the 6th of December.
QUESTION:

So that —

MR. GELTNER:
QUESTION:

All post-indictment.

MR. GELTNER:
QUESTION:
MR. GELTNER:

All post-indictment.

All post-indictment.

Some post-appointment of counsel.
That much is clear.

As 1 am sure

Your Honor is aware, the cases Interpreting — the .'cases

35
in this Court interpreting Massiahs some of them involve
counsel

plus indictments, some of them involve simply in­

dictments .
QUESTION:

Both Massieh and Brewer involved

counsel, indictment plus counsel.
MRo GELTNER:

Massiah and Brewer both involve

counsel plus indictment.
QUESTION:

Indictment or charge of some kind.

MR. GELTNER;

Yes.

Brewer involved formal

charges.
QUESTION:

Counsel.

MR. GELTNER:

Mot Indictment, but there had

been counsel in the case, formal, charges had been filed.
In McLeod, the statement was obtained after indictment but
before counsel came into the case.
QUESTION:

How about the other one?

MR. GELTNER:

That is likewise true of the Beatty

case.
QUESTION:

In what Jurisdiction was Beatty?

MR. GELTNER:

Beatty was the Fifth Circuit de­

cision.
QUESTION:

Mr. Geltner, do you have any comment

about the Hocfa and Hearst eases?

You don’t cite the

former on.e3 you do only in describing the dissenting opinion
below.

36
MRo GELTNER:
to address those now.

Yes, Your Honor.

I will b© happy

In the Hoff a case, we are faced with

three issues,, the Fourth Amendment question, the self­
incrimination questions and the right to counsel question.
On the right t© counsel question, it seems to me that the
Hoffa case turns on the proposition that the evidence ob­
tained from Hoffa by the undercover Agent Horton was used
in another case, and that if the Information had been ob­
tained for use in the case before the court at the time,
then we would have Massiah.

By that I mean, if the court,

if you remember, Your Honor, Hoffa was on trial in something
referred to in the opinion as the teat fleet trial, and
Mr. Horton

cam® to see him in an undercover role while he

was awaiting trial; during the period of the trial the
testimony that Horton gave that was before this Court was
his testimony in the jury tampering trial which resulted
from in part the information that he developed.
Or the Sixth Amendment question, it seems to me
that the case turns on that and che Court in the Court’s
opinion we see a reference to that part of the Massiah
opinion which says that the crucial question is whether or
not information in the pending case is elicited and used in
the pending case.
With regard to Hearst, Hearst of course relates
to Mr. Chief Justice Burger's question before as to the
1

37
placement of a listening device.

The Ninth Circuit's

opinion in Hearst turns on the fact that the listening de­
vice was a listening device which was generally available
and used in that jail for the purpose of monitoring
security matters.

The statement was not made to an agent

nor was the listening device placed for the purpose of ob­
taining information in the pending case.

That was an

accident3 according to the opinion of the Ninth Circuits
in Hearats and I prefer to rest at this point on that
distinction.

It see res to xte that is sufficient to dis­

tinguish from this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gsltners where do you draw the

line in the spectrum that Mr. Prey has referred to, would
you think that a person who is under indictment and in
jail volunteering & confession to the warden 5.8 a viola­
tion of Massiah?
MR. GELTNER:

No.. Your Honor.

1 think the govern-

yt> '

lueht must attempt tc obtain information in the pending
case from somebody against whom an indictment Is pending.
That if3 what makes it a violation.
?

QUESTION:

So a totally voluntary confession in

effect to someone ir the employ of the government does not
violate Massiah?
MR. GELPMER:
QUESTION:

Unconnected with the case?

Well, unconnected with the case, I

38
don’t know exactly what you mean.
MR. GELTNER:

In your example, Your Honor, the

warden is waiting in his office and Mr. Henry goes up and
says I’d like to confess today.

The fact that the warden

is a government employee does not in my opinion make out a
violation of Massiah,

If the warden or anybody else is

procured to attempt to get Mr. Henry to do so, then it
seems to me that makes that a violation of Massiah.
QUESTION:

What if the cellmate who isn’t a govern­

ment agent at the time interrogates or finds out and then
as it turns out he is quite willing to testify for the
government because ho knows that people who do get a break
but he was never put there for that purpose?
MR. GELTNER:

1 think I have to agree with Mr.

Prey on that, Your Honor, that that is not a violation of
the Massiah case because that is not the government obtain­
ing information from the accused after —
QUESTION:

Well, it happens to be the policy of

this prison and this warden and this government that people
who do us a favor get done a favor.
MR. GELTNER:

The word is put out?

\
WefiTf I think

vre probably -—
QUESTION:

Well, the word just seeps through the

walls.
MR. GELTNER:

I think I have to still agree with

39
Mr. Frey that that is not this case and that is not a govern­
ment agent.

At some point the government makes somebody an

agent when it seeks to have him do its bidding and h© does
so,
QUESTION:

And I suppose if the government agent

who was put in this cell, if he was mute, he- couldn’t speak,
he could just listen, I suppose you would be still m&king
your- argument because he was put there to listen?
MR. GELTNBR:

Put there to obtain information,

thatfB right.
QUESTION:

And it wouldn’t make any difference

whether he said a word or interrogated anybody or not?
:

i

MR. GELTNER:
QUESTION:

Precisely, Your Honor.

He would be the passive person like

the passive electronic bug, is that right?
MR. GELTNER:
QUESTION:

The listening post.

Except the one where a man got on bail,

he is indicted, he has counsel, he is out on bail and the
prosecutor gets hold of one of these guys and he says he
hangs out at- one of the bars up there on H Street, go up
there and see if you hear him bragging.
MR. GELTNER:

It is the same case, Your Honor.

I think that is a violation of the right to counsel.
QUESTION:

Do you mean he Is bragging and the

agent happens to hear him?

MR. GELTHER:

If the agent went there for that

purpose, yes, Your Honor.

If somebody else sitting at the

bar happens to turn up and testify —
QUESTION:

Suppose he goes up there and he brags

and an FBI agent is there getting a drink, too, but he
■$

didn't go there for that purpose.
MR, GELTKE?:

I think that is the warden and

Justice Relinquish*s example.
QUESTION:

Well, it is a pretty factual inquiry,

isn’t it, as to the Intent with which the government employee
approaches the defendant?
MR. GELTNEH:
facts, Your Honor.

That is why I am summarizing the

I think that is right.

I think that has

been pointed out in some of the opinions, In Brewer, that
is that it is essentially a factual inquiry.

I think it is

Mr.* Justice Blackman’s opinion in Brewer that points out
that- the subjective intention of the agent is very important
in these cases.
QUESTION:

Suppose we disagree with you on the

submission that Just passive listening by the agent would
violate the right to counsel, do you lose this case?
MR. GELTNER:

Of course not, Your Honor.

That

is precisely where I was going with my recitation of the
record.

I had a reason.

One of my reasons is to request

the Court to take a look at the testimony of Mr, Nichols.

41
QUESTION: What do you think the Court of Appeals
answer to my question would be?
MR. GELTMER:

Precisely the same as mine.

I think

that Is the import of Judge Butsmer’s opinion»
QUESTION:

So do you think they said there is a

violation here because passive listening would violate the
right to counsel?
MR. GELTMER:
QUESTION:

They —

If they said that, I am not sure they

went on and answered the question that you are about to
answer»
MR. GELTMER:

Well, Judge Winter’s opinion*

which is the majority opinion, which Judge Butzner concurred
with, says if by association by general conversation or
both Henry develops sufficient confidence and Nichols said
Henry bared his incriminating secrets, we have a violation,
and they
QUESTION:

That is agreeing with you that passive

listening is —
MR. GELTMER:

It is either/or.

Judge Winter’s

opinion —
QUESTION:

Oh, yes.

MR. GELTMER:

— is either/or.

Judge Butzner’s

opinion places greater emphasis in my opinion on the fact
that here we have a record which indicates that there were

*12

some conversations between Nichols and Henry and those con­
versations were about the subject of the bank robbery.
QUESTION:

Yet he concurred in Judge Winter's

opinion.
MR. GELTNER:
QUESTION:

He did, sir.

Do you think his limitations narrowed

the thrust of the court's opinion?
MR. GELTNER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. GELTNER:
QUESTION:

The Fourth Circuit's opinion?

I think they do.

In other words, he Is indicating he

agrees with the limitations expressed in his concurring
opinion.
MR, GELTNER:

I think that is a fair reading.

And as I was indicating, I think that they read the record
well and fairly.

On page 13$ of the transcript, which is

the first page of Nichols' testimony, Mr. Nichols is
asked the question, "Did you have an opportunity to have
some conversations with Henry while he was in the jail?
Some conversations, we are not talking about somebody who
sat there as a listening post."
QUESTION:

But, Mr. Geltner, you said that the

record would have supported a narrower opinion in effect
than the Court of Appeals wrote, I take it, because on page
Ta of the petition, the language you've been referring to

*3
In Judge Winter*s opinion, he says, "Evan if we assume that
Nichols obeyed his instructions

not to interrogate Henry

about the bank robbery, he did testify that he engaged in
conversation»"

So they certainly don't go much beyond

purely passive listening to find a violation of Massiah, do
they?
MR. GELTNER:

I think that is correct and I think

particularly Judge Winter's opinion which here is an either/or,
if by associations by general, conversation or both, which I
think is either/or,
|t

either is enough,

'

I think Judge Butzner's opinion does not

place it in terms oi either/or, and I think the record
uo'eh’n’t require it end I think that is probably the most

important thing for the decision today. The record does

to the Sixth, Amendment question —
QUESTION:

Yes.

ME. GELTNER:

— and. I think that ie Hearst.

I

think that my position on that is the same as my position

on Hearst, that is if the purpose is something other than
to obtain information

for use in pending cases against

whom there are people who have a right to counsel, then it
is a violation.

If the purpose is general, security

measures, for example, then I think that ~~ then I have to

45
concede that that is not a violet ion of the right to counsel*
QUESTION:

I take it your position would be no

different if the agent In this case — if the cellmate had

more like Brewer than we have here, that is we have the

MR. GELTNER:
QUESTION:

Might have a waiver?

MR. GELTNER:
QUESTION:

We might have a waiver.

We might have a waiver.

But except for that would be the same.

Except for that, you would make the same argument?

MR. GELTNER:

Yes.

As the opinions, particularly

the dissenting opinions in Brewer indicate, the waiver

question is always £ close question in cases in which we
have somebody known to be a police officer8 and it seems to
me it la always a very easy question and you can’t find
waiver when we’ve got an undercover informant.
Now, Your Honors, I had wanted to take a bit of
time to point out in Mr. Nichols' testimony how strongly
that testimony supports particularly Judge Butsner’s con­
curring opinion for the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

Now you are really going to try to

win the case.
(Laughter)
QUESTION:

Do you go far as to say after an in­

dictment &ncl counsel is appointed, any information obtained
by any government agent cannot be used?
MR. GELTNER:

Any information obtained by a

government agent who -seeks to obtain information for use
in a pending trial -»

there to get information —

drink, that is what I say in my hypothetical.

violation of the right to counsel, the government has not
done anything to obtain the *—
QUESTION:

Oh, I thought you said he did.

MR. GELTNER:
;

I*a sorry, Your Honor, I must have

\

confused you with my answer.
•

I thought that was the same

\

as the warden»
As I was saying, Your Honors, if we look at. page
135 of the transcript, question, "Did Mr. Henry tell you
i
anything about that bank robbery?" -Mow, tell means you’ve
1

' . got a conversation between the two about the bank robbery.
Perhaps it is not questioning, but it is a conversation.
"Would you relate te the jury what he told you?"

At that

point, Mr. Nichols tells the jury the substance of the
admissions that he attributes to Mr. Henry.
Further down, on page 136 of the transcript,
•question to Mr. Nicholds, '’Did he give you any reason for
going in the bank?"

People give reasons for doing things

when they are engaged in a conversation on a subject.
Nowhere do we hear questions or answers in which Mr. Nichols
tells us, "I overheard Henry bragging to other prisoners."
QUESTION:

Well, have you ever seen transcripts

of your own examination of witnesses and realize that

48
colloquial expressions are frequently used in eliciting
testimony at trials?
MR. GELTNF.R:

I think. Your Honor, we must assume

that Mr. Sims prepared his witness and he knew what the
witness* story was and he wanted to get it to the Jury
accurately.

If I were the prosecutor in this case and had

been advised by the FBI agents or the witness that what
this man was was a listening pest, it seems to me that
the question I would have asked is did you ever hear any**

MR. GELTNER:

The case does not completely turn

e:a that, but if it is crucial to the court’s decision as
to whether or not this was overhearing as opposed, to some
efforts to draw the defendant out, it seems to me that
the record supports that conclusion.
And then finally we have on page 137 again the
use of the word "describe" in the questions and answers
and again "tell,” all of which seems to lead me to the

49
conclusion that although we believe the proper reading of
the Mas si ah decision , the two per curiaias and of Brewer is
that the government may not after formal adversary proceed
ings seek to obtain information from the accused without
respecting the right to counsel if we have to find what is
tantamount to interrogation in this case under the circum­
stances of a jail cell, we’ve got an adequate record to
support the Court of Appeals in doing so.
Thank you* Your Honors,,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR* FREY:

he would not otherwise have talked about.
Now, with respect to Justice Marshall’s question
of Professor Qeltner, I think it is quite clearly our view
that, we could send somebody down to the bar to listen be­
cause we expect him to make statements at the bar about
the crime and we could use those statements without
violating Massiah.

Our motive to acquire information in

my view is clearly not enough.

And unless we do something

more that constitutes elicitation by us, the Court is being
