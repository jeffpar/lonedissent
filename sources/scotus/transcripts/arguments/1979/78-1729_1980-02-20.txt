Mr. Solicitor General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE E. MeCREE, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRo McCREE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This case presents the question whether the District
Court possesses and,, if so, that it should have exercised
supervisory power to suppress relevant evidence allegedly
obtained, in an illegal search that did not violate Respondent's
rights under the Fourth Amendment.
The facts giving rise to this controversy are as
follows!
In September 1976, Respondent was indicted in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of
Ohio of a charge of knowingly and wilfully making a false
^statement in the matter within the jurisdiction of a Federal
agency in violation of 18 United States Code Section 1001.
Specifically he was charged with falsely stating in his 1972
Federal income tax return that he did not have a foreign bank
account when, in fact, he knew that during 1972 he had such an
account in the Castle Bank s Trust Company of Nassau, Bahamas.
The critical piece of evidence in the Government's
case was a loan guaranty agreement dated April 28, 1972 in
which Respondent pledged the money in his Castle Bank & Trust

4

Company account to secure a loan of $100,000 extended by the
Bahamian bank through an American correspondent the Ptirrine
Bank of Florida to a Michigan land development company in
which he was interested.

The guaranty agreement was produced

by the Bank of Perrins Florida in response to Government
subpoenaes issued in April and May 1974 requesting the
production of all documents concerning the Bank of Perrins
business affairs with Castle Bank s Trust Company,

Other

evidence also critical to the conviction was furnished by a
former president of Castle Bank & Trust Company who testified
that he had checked Respondent's bank account with Castle Bank
& Trust and that the amount in it at the time of the loan
exceeded. $100,000.
Before trial Respondent moved to suppress this
evia nee on the ground that it had been obtained as a result
of an illegal search conducted in Miami, Florida of a brief­
case belonging to a Herbert Michael Wolstencroft, a Castle
Bank £ Trust Company officer, indeed a trust officer, »ho was
visiting in the United States in January 1973.
The person primarily responsible for the search of
the briefcase was Norman Casper, a private investigator who
was used as an informer by the Internal Revenue Service and who
was working with the encouragement and assist ance of Special
Agent Richard Jaffe of the Internal Revenue Service.
Casper had met Wolstencroft earlier when Casper had

5

visited Nassau in an effort to obtain information useful to
the Internal Revenue Service in the course of a longtime
investigation of it called Operation Trade Winds which was
an inquiry into the use of offshore tax havens for illegally
obtained or employed funds by United States taxpayers and
the Internal Revenue Service had learned that a suspected tax­
payer in San Francisco had an account in the Castle Bank &
Trust Company and that the Bank of Perrine Florida was an
American correspondent for the Bahamian bank.
Casper reported this discovery tc Jaffe who
encouraged him to try to obtain a list of the depositors of
the Castle Bank & Trust Company.

On tv?o of Wolstencroft's

visits to Miami Casper had introduced him to women, one of
whom we3 a Sybil Kennedy, a private investigator who sometimes
worked for Casper.

When Casper learned -that m>lstenc rbfft

was coming to Miami in January 1973 he arranged with Sybil
Kennedy to help him secure a list of depositors in Castle
Bank a Trust.

Wolsfcencrcft visited Kennedy at her Miami

apartment rnd after which the two went to a restaurant for
dinner.

Casper then entered the apartment by means of a key

which had been given to him by Kennedy and took Wolstencroft's
locked briefcase to a locksmith who, as the Court found, had
been recommended by Agent Jaffe.

When the locksmith mads a

key by means of which the briefcase was opened, it was taken
to

l.

photographer by IRS Agent Jaffe where the contents were

6

ware photographed.

The briefcase was returned to Kennedy's

apartment before she and Wolsfcencroft returned from dinner.
The internal Revenue Service ratified this by paying
Caspar $8,GOO for his services out of which he paid $1,000 to
Kennedy.
Jaffa made inquiries about the persons whose names
appeared in the photograph material' and learned from the
Cleveland office that Respondent Payrier’s returns for the years.
X96G through .12-71 were under investigation.

The Cleveland

special agent was told of the listing cf Paynar’s name but
nevertheless the investigation in. Cleveland was closed for want
of evidence . and the returns from '6 3 to '7.1 were accepted as
filed.
Thereafter the Department of Justice initiated a
Grand Jury investigation in. Miami into secret bank accounts.
The subpoenaas were issued in April and. May 1974 and the
critical loan agreement was produced.

This opened the

investigation again in C-leve'land which led to Respondent's
indictment involving hia 1972 return.
Respondent waived a jury trial and moved to suppress
the evidence, particularly the loan guaranty in any testimony
associated with it.
After some proceedings not. relevant here

the Court

entered a verdict of guilty and then set it aside when it
ordered the loan guaranty and the testimony related to it

7

suppressed.
The District Court held that the suppressed
testimony was tainted by the illegal search of Wolstencroft's
briefcase.

It held that the Respondent lacked standing under

the Fourth Amendment to challenge' the legality of the January
1973 search but that since the Government agent’s conduct

demonstrated "knowing and purposeful bad faith hostility to
a person's fundamental constitutional rights," that the due
process clause of the Fifteenth Amendment requires suppression
of the challenged evidence.
In the alternative and very candidly because it
question* d the validity of the Fifth Amendment determination,
it held-

The Federal Court's supervisory power over Federal

prosecution should be invoked to exclude evidence obtained
by Government conduct which is either purposely illegal or
motivated by an intentional bad faith hostility to a
constitutional right.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court
conviction in a brief opinion basing its determination solely
on the exercise of supervisory powers and expressly not
reaching the constitutional question.

This Court ran a

certiorari on the question of the asserted axercise of
supervisory powers to suppress relevant and probative evidence
of criminal activity even though Respondent's constitutional
rights were not violated by the acquisition of the evidence.

8

Our argument urges this Court to hold first that
Congress has the undoubted power to declare within constitutional
limits what practices and procedures will govern trials in
Federal courts.

And we submit that Rule 402 of the Federal

Rules of Evidence prohibits the exercise of any supervisory
power the District Court might otherwise have for the purpose
of suppressing relevant evidence derived from the search of
Wolstencroft's briefcase.

The rule of course provides all

relevant evidence is admissible except as otherwise provided
by the Constitution of that United States by Act of Congress,
by these rules or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme
Court pursuant to statutory authority.
We submit that this evidence that was obtained from
Wolstencroft*s briefcase was not prohibited by the Constitution
of the United States at the urging if Payner,by any Act of
Congress, by the Federal Rules of Evidence or by other rules
prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority,
which would mean amendments or revisions to the Federal Rules
of Evidence.
QUESTION;

General McCree, am I right in thinking

that Congress made some changes of its own in these Federal
Rules of Evidence when they were transmitted by this Court?
MRo McCEEE:

Indeed, the Congress did and perhaps

most relevant to our purposes here it changed the last sentence
from “other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to

9

its authority," or words to that effect to "pursuant to
statutory authority," which we submit was intended to indicate
that the source of the Supreme Court's authority to amend
“would be the Congress o£ the United States.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You say, I take it, Mr.

Solicitor General, that this is an expressed declaration by
the Congress on the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts, under
this Court?
MR. McCREEs

That is our submission, this is an

expressed declaration by the Congress that the Court shall not
exercise a supervisory power relative to the exclusion of
relevant evidence.

Row

we don't say that the courts are

bereft of all supervisory power.

An a matter of fact our

brief suggests that supervisory power is merely part of the
general power the courts possess to decide cases and
controversies and the Court every day uses supervisory powers
when it determines the procedure that will be followed in the
Court.

But the Congress lias the power to say that the Court

shall not use supervisory power unless it is subsumed in one
of the specified sources of power.
QUESTION:

To put it another way5 are you saying that

up to the tine of the adoption of Section 402 the powers of
the Court ~~ the inherent powers of the Court may well have
embraced this kind of supervisory authority but the Congress
has deliberately withdrawn that jurisdiction from the courts

10

fIR„ KcCREE:
precisely.

I would agree with that statement

This Court has in the past prior to the adoption

of Section 402 purported to act pursuant -- or to recognize
the use of supervisory powers.
admission of relevant evidence.

And even in the area of the
And wa don't say that the

Court doesn't still posssess supervisory powers for other
purposes.

As a matter of fact these rules, the so-called

wild card rule on hearsay evidence allows courts to use
power which we would analogize to the supervisory powar to
admit evidence as the authenticity or equivalent to authenclty
as specified exceptions to the hearsay rule.
QUESTIONi
jus

Well, the supervisory power is really

another word for the power that any appellant court has

to correct nonconstitutional errors, isn't it?
MR, McCREEs

I would agree with that except I would

include a trial court as wall in that.

And I think it does

have power -- it is the judicial poxeer of the United States
to decide cases in controversy.
QUESTIONs

Right.

And not only power but the

function of an appellant court to correct prejudicial errors
and to reverse judgments if prejudicial errors have occurred.
And if there are nonconstitutional errors you can. call that
supervisory power if it pleases you.
MR, McCREE:

Yes.

We agree, Mr. Justice Stewart.

We would say that the Congress is the power to prescribe rules

11

of procedure in evidence with the Federal Courts.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR, McCREE:

This court Palermo v. United States

held specifically that, that the language that was used was
the power of this Court to prescribe rules of procedure in
evidence with the Federal Courts exists only in the absence
of a relevant Act of the Congress. We submit that the Congress
can provide the circumstances under which relevant testimony
may be excluded from evidence.
Of course it cannot tell this Court that it can't
do it in contravention of the Constitution, there isn’t any
question about that.

And that is one of the specified grounds

of course on which the Court may exclude.
QUESTION:

I tare it that you say that the rule

you find some constitutional ground for exclusion or unless
you find some ground for excluding expressed in these rules --MRo McCREE:

QUESTION:

But then it was decided to reduce the

rules of evidence to a set of rules and than Congress turn

MR. McCREE:

Precisely.

Before Rule 402 was adopted

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26 provided

in its second sentence:
"The admissibility of avidence and the competency
of witnesses shall be governed except when an act of Congress
or these rules otherwise provide by the principles of the
common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the
United States in light of reason and experience. ”
QUESTION:
MR» McCREE:

That was that power was eliminated.
It was severely circumscribed and 402

specified the bases by which relevant evidence could be
excluded thereafter.
MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

If 402 ware not on the

books, Mr. Solicitor General, would you be here today?
MR. McCREE:

I would be here today.

I would be hare

today to say that even if there is supervisory power in the
courts that it w s not correctly exercised in this cass and
that is my next argument.
QUESTION:

That it was inconsistent with our standing

c a sa.
MR a. McCREE s

That indeed it is.

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER t

That Would be a different

13

basis antirely.
MRo McCREE:

It would be that the power exists but

it should not have been exercised in this instance because it
amounts to an utter circumvention of all of the standing
jurisprudence that this Court has worked out on a ease by case
basis over the years,
QUESTION:

Would it be another way of saying the

same thing General McCree, to say that concededly the Courts
of Appeals have supervisory power but that this Court has
supervisory power to supervise their supervisory power?
MR, McCREE:

Well, there seems to be no question of

that and this of course is the end of the road,
QUESTION:

General McCree, before you get into

your second argument, do I correctly understand that your
first argument asks us to overrule Miranda?

Because the

giving of Miranda warning as I understand it is not
constitutiona1ly required.
MRo McCREE:

Well, the Miranda warnings are under

the Fifth Amendment right to be
QUESTION:

not to be required

They are required by the rule to protect

the Fifth Amendment, right.

But they are not themselves

constitutionally required,
MR, McCREE:

Well, the Fifth Amendment specifically

provides that no person shall be required to incriminate him­
self,

And I would say that on that basis there is authority

14

for the Miranda rule if it is to be a precaution against selfincrimination.

It is not a general, open-ended chancellor's

foot kind of determination.
QUESTIONS

It is not a rule prescribed by the Supreme

Court pursuant to statutory authority and it is not provided
by the Constitution of the United States, that the evidence
— a confession given without the appropriate warning shall
be inadmissible.
MR. McCREE:

It is not expressly provided.

But this

Court has found it to be required.
QUESTION?

Hell, doesn’t Michigan v. Moseley

clarify that and make it rather clear that Miranda is not
a constitutionally mandated requirement?
If I am right about that, then your argument I think
does ask 113 to overrule Miranda.
MRo McCREE:

Well, I don’t think it does.

And I

want, to think just a moment more about my response to it.
And I come back to my earlier answer that the Fifth Amendment
does specifically protect a person against self-incrimination.
QUESTION:

Right.

And of course the Fourth Amend-»-

MR. McCREE:

QUESTION:

MR, McCREE:

Mr. Payner has no more right to invoke

the Fourth Amendment here than a perfect stranger to it.
QUESTION:

Well, it would bo difficult to imagine

why this Court reversed the Supreme Court of Arizona in
Miranda v. Arizona if the Constitution didn't require Miranda
warnings, would it not?

1

mean our only authority to reverse

the Supreme Court of Arizona is a violation of Federal
Constitution or Federal statute.
MRo McCREEs

That was my response 1 thought to Mr.

Jus id© Stevens that there is the express -QUESTION:

Companion cases in Miranda, all but one

of which were also State cases.
MRo McCREE:

And there it; an expressed guarantee

against self-incrimination and this Court -QUESTION: '’Compulsory self-incrimination.
MR» McCREE:

-- compulsory self-incrimination.

And

this Court equated the failure to give these warnings as
subjecting a person to that risk.
QUESTION:

At least absent those warnings the

State is in constitutional trouble but Miranda and some other
cases indicated that these particular prophylactic rules
might not be the only satisfactory protection that a State
could satisfactorily give to the Fifth Amendment right.
But absent some other protections and absent these warnings,

a State conviction is vulnerable.
MR® McCREE:

Fortunately, we don’t have to face that

questjon here, though.
I submit that, the literal language of 402 forbade
the District Judge here from using an amorphous and undefined
supervisory power to exclude this very relevant, very probative
evidence.
QUESTION:

Should the Court read it as having Congress

say to us that from this time on you will not make any rules
except within the framework of 402?

standing cases that says that Mr. A can't object to a Fourth
Amendment violation of Mr. B and five Justices think those
standing cases are wrong, that those are, just prudential
rules anyway, so we reverse Alderman and say that A does have
standing to object to B.
I take it your argument would say we have no power
to do that.
MR o McCREE:

I don't say you wouldn't have.

17
QUESTION:

Why not; why not?

We would then exclude

the evidence; this very evidence that is involved in this
case would then be inadmissible.

MR. McCREE:

Of course if you reverse -- you mean

to exclude evidence that you think A is right but at B's

So ha wasn't incriminated, was ho?
As a matter of fact — that is correct.

20

As a matter of fact this case really should not. be -- would
not have been in this Court if the Court of Appeals had
looked to see whether this evidence that was critical for the
conviction had whatever might have been produced by the
search of Wolstencroft’s briefcase.

As a matter of fact in

tho Northern District of Illinois in Chicago there is a case
called the United, States of America v. iBaskss that grew out
of this same investigation of this Operation Trade Kinds,
There also the name of Bastis may surface in the photograph­
ing of the contents of Wolstencroft's briefcase.

But the

District Court determined that since they already knew that
the Bank of Parrine Florida was

a correspondent for the

Cas .la Bank S Trust Company and had the information that led
them to subpoena the Castle Bank & Trust Company papers in
the Bank of Perrine a possession, that this was an independent
source of information and therefore there was no taint
connected with going into the briefcase.
And there was another episode too where Casper
allegedly took a Rolodex -- or I think it was Kennedy took a
Rolodex address device which didn’t figure into this case,
if the Court of Appeals had decided this and addressed the
question I think this case might not have been here.

I think

it would have come out the same way the District. Court in
t

Illinois did.

And incidentally, that case is pending now in

the Seventh Circuit.

21

It is also instructive, to ms anyway, that the
District Court in Bastis also found that, and said so expressly
that to allow the use of supervisory powers here would
circumvent this Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence
associated with the concept of standing and that -QUESTIOW:

Wo.

This is the violation of Miranda

before Miranda was decided, the question of whether it was
retroactive, in effect.

And at page 444 of tho opinion the

Court points out that the Court in Miranda had recognized that
these procedural safeguards were not themselves rights
protected by the Constitution but wore instead made tc insure
that the right against self-incrimination was protected.
And then later on on page 445, our determination that the
interrogation in this case involved no compulsion sufficient
to breach the right against compulsory self-incrimination,
does not mean that there was not a disregard, albeit an
inadvertent disregard of the procedural rules later established
in Miranda.
I think it quite clearly draws a distinction between

22

a constitutional violation and a violation of a procedural
rule imposed by this Court.

theory we would say that Rule 402

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNET KLEINMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KLEXNMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like first to direct my argument in light of
the argument made by the Solicitor General to Rule 40,2 if I
may.
It appears that Rule 402 set forth certain rules
regarding the exclusion of evidence.

However, what, the

Solicitor General has not taken into account is that the
supervisory power of the Court has historically been jxercised
to make certain that all of the prosecutorial and all of the
procedural steps which evolved in the conviction of a criminal
were followed by the Executive and the other branches which
were involved in bringing that criminal to justice.
QUESTION: Do you question the authority of the
Congress to withdraw specific areas of jurisdiction from the
Federal Courts?
MR. KLEXNMAN:

No, I do not question that authority

of the Congress to do that-.-

However,

I would suggest that it

may very well be, and I a:a not taking this position here today
as strongly as I might, that the supervisory power of the
Court to make certain that the constitutional requirements

25

or at least that due process as the civilised countries cf
this world do understand due process without the use of. fort;
and without the use of requiring one to testify against ..i
self are vithin the power of this Court.

Otherwise there is

no check upon what the Executive can do in order to bring a
criminal to justice.
For example, -~
QUESTION: Well, before you go too far let me check
you on that.
To .

ompelled to testify against himself, wo don't

need to get any more authority to deal with that than we have
under the Constitution, do we?
ft. KLEINMAN:

Well, the question is whether the

evidence can be excluded.

It is true that the Constitution

provides that no person ;shall be required to be a witness

against others.

Ye S .

In Mallory the evidence was admissible

However, in McNabb it was not.

In the

Valencia case which was decided in the Sixth Circuit and for
which incidentally then Judge McCree wrote the opinion, the
rights of an individual who had hired an attorney were violated
by the secretary to that attorney who was a spy -- I shouldn’t
say h spy --- an informer tor the Internal Revenue Service - or for the Government.

And that secretary took material from

the attorney's files and gave it to the Government and that
material was used to convict three people, only one of whom
was the client oi that attorney.

The other two had no relation­

ship with this attorney at all.

Yet Judge McCree in the

opinion of the Sixth Circuit Court said that that evidence
was tainted and it could not be used against anyone.
I am suggesting, Your Honor, that in this particular
case the evidence was tainted.

The Government continues to

act as if the activity of the Internal Revenue Service in this
case was an illegal matter, an illegal search, the constable’s
blunder if you will.

you know about how Mr. Caspar was going fee get this evidence.
He denied knowing it although the Court found that
he did know.

But he said, "Ho, 1 didn't know but I didn't expect

that he would commit murder tc get it."
Now, if the. Government is correct in its position
on the Rule 402, if the Government agent Mr, Casper had killed
Wolstencroft in order to get that evidence, there was no way -there would be no way that this Court could exclude that
evidence if the Government’s position on Rule 402 is correct.
QUESTION:
couldn't we?

We could affirm his conviction for murder,

28

HRd KLEINMAN:

Well, I am not sure of that.

I am not

sure of that because I do not believe as I read some of the

the Federal Government may not be subject to criminal
prosecution under State law.

distasteful practices.

In their brief they talk about

The fact o:r the matter is that the

United States Government was a participantas a matter of fact
planned to commit a criminal act in order to get evidence
against this defendant.

I submit to this Court that, the act

29

of the Government was more heinous than the act allegedly
committed by this defendant, by the Respondent here.

The

fact of an account in a bank in the Bahamas was not an illegal
act.

They had every right to have such a bank account.

The

contention was that he lied about it.
QUESTION:

That he Had about it.

MR, KLEINMANs
QUEST3:ON:

That he said that —

That is not reprehensible, lying?

MR, KI.HXNMAN:

I didn't say it was not reprehensible,

You:' Honor, but I would suggest that the commission of a
felony by stealing this man's property was a more heinous crime
than failing to state on a tax return that a man had an account
in the Bahamas, because that would not necessarily indicate
that any crime was committed by him other than that statement
made.
Now, 1 suggest chat in the Jacobs case, the Second
Circuit, for example, held that it was their opinion — the
only case that I find that directly confronted Rule 402 problem
-- they held that the Congress did not direct its attention to
the supervisory power of the Court at all and that therefore
if one looks at the legislative history of Rule 402 one will
find, no reference to such an important matter as the super­
visory power of this Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kleinman, you are talking I take it

about the supervisory power of the Federal judiciary as a

30

whole, not of each Court of Appeals independently.
MR, KLEINMAN:

Correct.

I am speaking of the right

of the Federal judiciary to govern the manner in which a
criminal is brought to justice, including its right to super­
vise the activities of the Executive branch in bringing that
criminal to justice.
QUESTION:

So if the Seventh Circuit case that

General McCrea mentioned is affirmed by the Court of Appeals
and there is a conflict in the Seventh Circuit and Sixth
circuit in your case, that conflict would presumably ultimately
have to be resolved by this Court.
MR, KLEINMAN:
QUESTION:

I believe it would? yes.

So it isn’t a question -- as I recall

t e Jacobs cats, it was the policy of U.S. Attorneys in the
Second Circuit, something that the Second Circuit didn’t
purport to say was something that, ought to be followed in the
Ninth Circuit or the Fifth Circuit or the Fourth Circuit, it
was simply more or less an administrative policy.
MR, KLEINMAN::
U.S

It was an administrative policy of tin

Attorney’s Office to do certain things.

And the Court

in Jacobs held that they improperly failed to do it in the
case of Jacobs, in that particular situation.

But incidental)

to its decision it stated that Rule 402 aid not deal with the
supervisory power of the Court.

As I say, the receipt or

the acquisition of evidence in the case by a crime as heinous

31

as the murder of Wolstencroft would not have been excludable
if the Government's interpretation of Rule 402 is correct.

QUESTION:

Holding aside from Rule 402, the Govern­

ment says that evidence would fce admissible under our -- under

QUESTIONS

That is correct.

-- under the standing cases.

MR. KLEINMAN:

Well, the question of the standing

cases is another matter, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, I know but you certainly have to

get by those, too.
MR. KLEINMAN:

Yes.

That depends on whether we .rely

on the Fourth Amendment or whether we rely on the Fifth Amend­
ment .
QUESTION:

But whatever you rely on you have to get

by that point, don't you.
MR. KLEINMAN:

The standing point?

I don't under­

stand the matter of standing to be involved in the question
involving the Fifth Amendments the due process clause provides
thatif there is a taint to evidence it cannot be used.

QUESTION;

What was involved in Alderman?

What was

involved in the Alderman case; that is a standing case isn’t
it?
MS. KXiEIMMAN s

Yes, that is a standing case.

But

that had to do with a particular act that was .involved.

For

example, in. the search cases, in the illegal search cf:ses
v® are dealing with an act, with the illegal act of searching,
making an improper and an illegal search against an individual.
And this Court has held that an individual in order to have;
standing to complain must be the individual against whom that
search was directed.
Now, however, we have argued in our brief that in
this particular case the Respondent had the right, the
legitimate expectation of privacy in the records that were
maintained in the Bahamian bank.

So that extent he could be

F i fth Amendment •-QUESTION;

What if we had a treaty that would have

allowed us to "extradite those records?"
■ 14R0 KLEINMAN;

hell, if there were such a treaty,,

then I would assume he did not have a legitimate expectation
of privacy because he would know that this Government recognizes
the fact that th ;y could get those records.

And that if he

knew that,he had no legitimate expectation.

QUESTION:

Because I think that if you are right

about that, the 402 argument is beside the point and so are
the standing cases.
MR. KLEINMAN:

the planning and direction of the larceny, if you will, was
such as not to comport with the manner in which due process
is carried on in this country.
of the court.

It so shocked the conscience

This was not a mere act of an illegal act of

making a search where an officer of the Government thought ha
had the right to do so, this was a devious plan to acquire
evidence by means of a larceny.
Mr. Casper said,

Mr,. Jaffa when he spoke with

"I have to talk to my supervisor,

I have

to talk to Troy Register who is the head of the Intelligence
Section.

He planned it."
If the exclusionary rule can ever be applied, and

1 know the courts have struggled with this problem as to
whether the exclusionary rule really deters illegal conduct
and the criminal conduct on. the part of the Government as in

34

this case, this case ought to prove that the exclusionary rule
works.

If Jaffe when he talked to Mr. Register in Washington

had come to the conclusion, both he and Mr. Register, that
this evidence would not be admitted in court if they did what
they did, they would not have performed that act.

There was

no question that when they were told to go ahead and do it
because the court has said that this man Payner -- they
didn’t know about Payner ~~ but anyone whose name was there:
or evidence against whom they might acquire had no standing to
complain, they went ahead and did it.

hs a matter of fact

the court's decision in this Payner case impelled the Internal
Revenue Service to adopt the rule with regard to the manner in
which evidence is acquired-so it wouldn't happen again.
Furthermore, as I understand it.- the Government has dropped
all prosecution against others in this type of action except
perhaps two or three although there were soma 400 people
involved — as the evidence showed, there were some 400 names
in that briefcase — the Government after the matter had been
determined and had been heard by the House of Representatives
decided that they would not proceed against any of the other
persons who were named, in there because of the taint upon the
evidence.
QUESTION: Where do we find that out?
MR. KLE-XNMAN:
Representatives.

The hearings before the House of

Otherwise the Government will proceed,

it will not be deterred-from using evidence illegally obtained.
QUESTION:

Just Stevens has just pointed out that

the Executive branch responded to congressional hearings with­
out any statement from this Court at all.
MRo KLEINMAN:

No; not true.

They responded to the

Act, to the judgment rendered in this case.

The Internal

Revenue Service did not adopt its rule until after Judge
Manos in the District Court ruled that the evidence was not
admissible.
QUESTION:

1' thought you said that all these

prosecutions ware dropped, after they ware criticised in the
Congressional hearings.
MS, KLEINMAN:

No, this case itself, Your Honor, was

carried on after the hearings in the Congress.

It was only

after this case was decided that the ochers were dropped.
QUESTION:

So the hearings in Congress really didn't

amount to all that Each?
MR. KLEINMAN:

of Internal Revenue stopped not any further proceedings but
further activity of agents in acquiring evidence under the
tax haven

ME» KLEINMAN:

That is right.

stop the prosecutions at that time.

But that did not

Those prosecutions were

continued until this Court ruled that the* evidence was tainted,
that the agent of the United States had violated the laws of
the State of Florida by means of a larceny which they had
committed.

The Court also cast some doubt as to whether there

wasn't something involved with this woman Sybil Kennedy which
could have had other implications.

The Government did not

bring Sybil Kennedy to court, we couldn't find Sybil Kennedy,
we didn't know who she was.
QUESTION:

I don't believe

And if this Court reverses the Sixth

Circuit presumably the prosecutions will continue?
MR» KLEINMAN:

I have no knowledge of what they will

do if this Court does that.

However, I feel that if this

Court does not affirm the Sixth Circuit, certainly the Govern­
ment will then feel that it can proceed to do whatever it feels
like in this case because the evidence could not be exclude6
uad r any circumstances.
QUESTION:

Mr. ICleinman, isn3t -- excuse me.

QUESTION:

At least for ras you covered the standing

V

point so swiftly that I think I missed it.

Now, Mr. Justice

Stevens has a question but I would like to have you reach that
standing question.
MR o KLEINMAN:

My understanding of the question of

38

standing

is that the person who objects to the introduction

of evidence obtained in an illegal search raust have standing
to object to that.

And it has been hold that the person who

can so complain is one whose legitimate expectation of privacy
has been violated.
the opinion

I believe Mr. Justice Rehnquisfe wrote

the Bashes case in which it was sol held that

a person must have a legitimate expectation of privacy.

And

that legitimate expectation of privacy doesn't necessarily
involve a property right.

He must not necessarily own the

property; it must not be his property necessarily that was
searched.

The question is whether he had the legitimate

expectation of privacy.
1 suggest here, and that is the reason why I
suggested perhaps even the standing requirement has been met
is that Mr. Payner had the right to believe that the
confidentiality of his records would ba observed and he had
a legitimate expectation of privacy as to those records.
QUESTION:

But the District Court rejected that.

MRo RLEINMAN:
QUESTION:

Ces, it did.

what is your answer to the standing cases if we happen to
disagree with you and agree with the District Court that there
was no reasonable expectation of privacy in these records?
MR. KLSINMAH:

I assume that this Court would then

have to hold that my client did not have — 02: the Respondent
did not have standing to object to the search on that basis.
QUESTION:

All right.

MR. KLEINMAN:

Then what will you do?

Then we would proceed tc the next

QUESTION:

-- and that is that under the due process

clause there was a violation of bad faith, hostility violation

And that so tainted the evidence that it is not admissible in
a court of law.

It does not comport with the American sense

of due process and justice.
And, as I said,'there were cases that so held.

I

believe that the Valencia case is a matter in that line.
The violation of the constitutional rights in Valenci1 were
against one individual.

However, the Court said that this

so tainted the evidence, it was so abhorrent to them,*shocked
their conscience, that that evidence couldn51 be used even

QUESTION:

Now, maybe ha did something else that we

don’t know about.
MR. KLEINMAN:

That is true.

However, the Sixth

Circuit also in the Archer case said that: it was unthinkable
that evidence could be admitted when the Government instigated
robberies and beatings of one individual or a group of
individuals to get evidence against other individuals.
And that is what happened here, they committed a crime, they
violated the rights of Mr. Wolstencroft.

And under those

circumstances the evidence is so tainted it is not a mere
error of judgment of an official of the Government.

It is

a deliberate devious plan to steal something from someone else.
And that makes the difference between a due process violation
and one involving the particular standing of this individual.
