MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

We will hear arguments next

Mr, Goldberg, you may proceed,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN D. GOLDBERG, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GOLDBERG:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
This case concerns the validity of a search which occur­
red at a public tavern in Aurora, Illinois.

On March 1, 1976,

at about 4s10 in the afternoon, a group of at least eight or
nine police officers and Illinois Bureau of Investigation agents
entered a public establishment by the name of the Aurora Tavern,
Their purpose was to execute a warrant for the tavern, the premr .
ises of the tavern, and the bartender, a man by the name of Greg.
Agent Jerome Johnson announced the officers' purpose
and authority, and he immediately told everyone in the tavern to
i

¥

stand for a search for weapons.

Present in the tavern at the

time were a group of approximately between nine and thirteen
patrons, including my client, Ventura Ybarra.
The lighting was sufficient, according to Agent
Johnson, for all of these patrons to be seen.

And he described

the tavern as one large room, with one entrance and one exit,
Johnson testified he had never seen any of the patrons before,
•

.

\

and despite never having seen any of them before, he then

4

proceeded to pat all of them down,

And he did this even though

he testified he had no knowledge that any had committed an of­
fense, had no indication that Mr, Ybarra had a gun or was hos­
tile or was hiding anything,
him at all times.

Mr, Ybarra*s hands were visible to

He had no knowledge that Ybarra owned or

worked at the premises, which ha did not.

He was merely a

patron.
In patting down Mr, Ybarra, he testified that he felt
no weapon at all during that patdown.

He felt a cigarette

That was his testimony.

He did not

returned to Ybarra and he searched Ybarra again.
Ybarra again,

of the
He then

And he searched

evesi though he testified that he had no knowledge

at that time that Ybarra had any contraband or any of the iteras
they were looking for,
Ybarra hadn*t moved between the two searches, and at
all times his hands had been on the bar, between the two searches.
During the second search of Ybarra, the officer found six tin*»
foil packets containing heroin.
At the conclusion of the evidence at the hearing on the
motion to suppress in Cook County, Illinois, the Prosecutor con­
ceded that there was no probable cause for the search.
he relied on a statute,

Instead,

and that is Illinois Revised Statute,

Chapter 38, Section 108-9, which says that in executing a

5

warrant a police officer may reasonably detain to search anyone
present at the time of the execution, in order to a) protect
himself from attack, or b) prevent the disposal or concealment
of any of the instruments, articles or things named in the
warranto
QUESTIONS

Independent of the statute, Mr, Goldberg,

if the officer observed factors which would have warranted a
patdown

search under a Terry, what would you say than?
MR, GOLDBERGs

If he had observed factors which would

have warranted patdown in Terry, , he could have performed it
without the authority of the statute»

There is little question

about that»
QUEtSTIONs

Mr» Goldberg, does your argument depend at

all on a question of degree?

1 notice the Supreme Court of

Illinois said,‘’Obviously, this warrant to search a department
stGre would not authorise the search of everybody in a .depart­
ment store»1’

Conversely, suppose that a search warrant had is­

sued for explosives stored in a privately owned cabin„

And

police executing a search warrant -» say, the cabin dimensions
V-

were 10 by 12 ~ at night,

r

In it, they found two people.

Do

you think they would have had the authority to make a patdown 4
search of those two people?
MR» GOLDBERG?

Well, the answer to that, I think, is

that the premises are smaller and more private, and the number
of people there are . less than the reasonable suspicion,goes

6

greater that they are involved in the criminal activity,,
necessarily*

I think this particular set of facts was a public

place and nine to thirteen patrons in a place where there is no
reason to suspect an involvement is far beyond any line that

*

might be drawn*
QUESTION?

But it is a line-drawing process?

MR* GOLDBERGs

Necessarily a line would have to be

drawn somewhere, but that line, I think, is provided in Terry v.,
Ohio*

If the circumstances are such that the officers could

reasonably suspect or in the case of -- not a weapon search but
a search for contraband, and if they had probable causa, under
the circumstances, to believe that the persons were involved in
criminal activity^then they could search them*.
QUESTION*

If they had probable cause, there is no

doubt they could search them*

What if they had reasonable

suspicion under Terry?
MR, GOLDBERG®

Well, in your exposes hypothetical,

of course, that would be a question of probability of danger to
the officers 9, And Terry,of course, is the weapons situation,
and reasonable suspicion would be sufficient under those circum­
stances *
Now, if they walk into a place and they have only a
hunch that a person might be involved, that wouldn’t be enough*
Ahd„ traditionally, of course, when you are talking about search­
ing someone for contraband, as opposed to a weapon, the Court

7

has always spoken in terms of probable cause.

But the distinc­

tion which the State seeks to draw, saying that, "Well, you
should only require reasonable suspicion here," I don’t think
that’s one that really has any relevance here, because they had
nothing*

They had no reasonable suspicion or probable cause

c>

here? Whether you consider it a weapons search or a search for
contraband, there was no sort of suspicion at all.

So those

differing degrees in which there are smaller premises, more
reason to believe a person is involved, obviously all present
closer questions.

But this particular set of facts, since there

was nothing at all,, there is absolutely no suspicion of any kind.
QUESTIONS

If you were representing the bartender, would

you be making the same argument?
MR. GOLDBERGs

Well, the bartender was named in the

warrant, Greg, and so I would be able to make this argument.
QUESTIONS

Well, would you say that if it was found by

a State court that there was reasonable suspicion that people in
that particular bar might well be armed, could the patrons be
patted down just for weapons, while they made the search —
before they made the search of the premises?
MR, GOLDBERG*

If there was reasonable suspicion re­

garding the first patdown,

you can be patted down, and there

simply wasn’t. here.
QUESTIONg

For a weapon?

MR. GOLDBERG*

For a weapon.

8

QUESTIONS

And then if a weapon were found, and

assuming the possession of that weapon

concealed on the person,

was a violation of Illinois law, then there could be a general
search*

Only if a weapon were found,
MR, GOLDBERGS

Right,

Now, the particular portion of this Illinois statute
that was relied on was not a weapons section.
protect themselves from danger.

It was not a) to

It was b) to prevent the dis~

posal or concealment of any instruments, articles or things
named in the warrant.
And it is simply our contention that neither of these
searches were performed -» neither the first nor the second ~
with reasonable suspicion or probable cause,

There was no

articulable-standard in that at all.
The only reason for the search, apparently, was the
mere presence of the patrons in the place where the search
warrant was being executed.

And that is a rationale for search

that this Court has consistently rejected,
QUESTIONS

Isn’t it a little bit broader than that?

I am not saying it is vaiid,

There is talk here of open and

notorious narcotics transactions in this small place.
is something more than you just said.
MR, GOLDBERG*

Yes, Your Honor,

So, it

If that is valid,
The first talk of

this narcotics dealing being open and notorious is in the
Attorney General’s brief in this Court,

That contention had

9

never been made before# and the.reason it has never been made
before is that it is simply untrue-

There was no indication

that someone who walked into this bar would have been aware that
narcotics dealing was going onthat he had no suspicions
QUESTION?

The officer testified himself

that —

Isn’t that often true of any bar# though»

One gets off a plane and there is a bar and he walks in.

So

I don’t see the significance of your comments
MR» GOLDBERG?

Well# I think the State’s assertion is

that when in walking into the bar the patrons. gave up their
:vV

expectation of privacy*

they walked into a bar where they should

have known narcotics going on- And my assertion is they could
not have known narcotics dealing was going on# because it wasn’t
open-

If# by open# they mean that the bartender was standing

behind the bar and selling narcotics as openly as he was selling
alcohol# that’s simply not true*
QUESTIONi

But you don’t challenge the validity of the

warrant for the search of the premise,r?

f

MR- GOLDBERG?

No# there was no need for it*

*

QUESTION sWell

Which said that their reason for

i

searching it was that it was an open and notorious place for
exchanging narcotics.
MR. GOLDBERG?
indicated only this.

No.

The complaint for search warrant

It indicated that an Informant had been in

the bar the previous day# and had seen tinfdii

packages the

10

previous day behind the bar, and on the person of Greg the
bartender»

And he knew the tinfoil

packets were a method of

packaging heroin, and he had been told that heroin would be for
sale on that day, March 1, 1976, the day on which the warrant
was executed»
There is nothing in the complaint for search warrant
contrary to the State8s contention»
QUESTIONS

Well, what do you say that the searching

officer could have searched, if he could not have searched the
people in the bar?
MR* GOLDBERGs

He could have searched the premises,

%

that is
QUESTION?

Whereabouts

on the premises?
i

MR, GOLDBERGs

He could have searched behind the bar,

he could have searched objects on the premises, and he could have
searched the bartender, Greg*
QUESTIONS

,

Why not the people?

MR, GOLDBERG:

Because the people, by virtue of being

there, did net become part of the premises.

If that were so,

if the people simply by virtue of being there were like — became
like the bar or any of the objects in the bar, then the warrant
would be a general warrant*
QUESTION:

What if someone had a market basket they

were wheeling out of the bar?
MR* GOLDBERGs

If that were his personal possession, it

11

Is not part of the premises.

It is his.

He has an expectation

of privacy in it,
QUESTIONg

So* you say it has to be almost a fixture

in the real property sense of the word?
MR, GOLDBERGs

Well* it has to be something which the

officers could reasonably believe could contain the contraband.
And certainly* for example* a case in which beer* a case of
beer which clearly would belong to the bar* although not a
fixture* would be amenable for search for the contraband.
an individual walking into the bar* where the police*

But

as here*

don’t have any reason to suspect him of involx^ement in any way*
he is not amenable to search* simply because there is a search
warrant being executed on the premises.

In other words* a

person is not part of the premises,
QUESTION:

This warrant authorized the search of the

premises and the bartender,

Supposing the search warrant had

authorized a search of everybody in the premises?

Then* I

suppose, it would be perfectly all right* wouldn’t it?
MR» GOLDBERGs

No* I think in that instance* it would

(

be a/general warrant»

There has to be some reason to authorise

a search of people in a search warrant»
r

?
./

.

QUESTION:

.

Supposing* unlike the complaint here* this
■

,

complaint had said that there was open notorious dealing and
that persons in the premises regularly go in and acquire some
drugs* and so forth and so on.

And the warrant had said* ”A11

12

such persons may be searched as well as the bartender and the
premises,"
MR, GOLDBERGs
among them

If it said, for example, that the patrons,

Ventura Ybarra, were involved in the criminal activity,

I would have no argument,

But if it said that some patrons are

involved, or indicated some patrons were involved

and implied

that some were not, then X think there would be a similar, although not as obvious problem.

At least in that instance, there

would be some suspicion regarding the group of patrons, but here
there is no suspicion regarding anybody,

I think that would be

a little more difficult problem, v/hare some are suspected and
some are not,
QUESTIONS

Nobody except the bartender,

MR, GOLDBERG*

The only person suspected is the

bartender, and it appears from the record that the bartender
wasnft even there when the warrant was executed#
I would like to go back to the complaint for search
warrant for just a second, because there is soma dispute as
to what inferences can be drawn from the complaint.

The complaint

only indicates that Greg is involved, and that tinfoil
are on the bar, behind the bar, I should say#

packets

And there is no

indication that they are in view of the customers, no indication
that the informant saw this as a general patron of the tavern.
Presumably, he was behind the bar when he saw it.
Nothing in the circumstances when the officers entered

13

indicates that narcotics dealing at that point was open and
notoriouso

They had no indication that there was narcotics

dealing going on when they walked in, from their position at the
doorway»

And again •»»
QUESTION t

What about paragraph 4, of the application

for the search warrant?
MR» GOLDBERGs

Yes, "that the informant advised me that

over the weekend of 28-29 February he had a conversation with
Greg, and was advised that Greg would have heroin for sale on
Monday, March 1, 1976,”
In my mind, the only thing that one can logically infer
to that is that this informant, or anybody who knew that Greg had
heroin for sale, could go up to Greg and purchase heroin, but that
a lawful patron who walked in to buy a beer would have no way of
knowing that narcotics dealing was going on,

I think this would be true that any time there is some
illegal activity going on in a public place, normally, the
patrons of that public place are not going to be privy to the
information that thara is unlawful activity going on 'there,
And unless the police can somehow particularise the reason to
believe that a particular individual is involved in the unlawful
activity, then they cannot search him merely because they have a
warrant for the premises*
The State has offered a new rule to justify the search
in this case*

Their rule is that a patdown

is, per se,

14

permissible at the scene of a search warrant, where officers
do not have reason to believe that a person has no connection
to the premises or the criminal activity.,

That is set out in

their briefc
This rule has, I think, several infirmities*

First,

it violates all the general principles we have been talking about
this morning, the rule that mere presence at the scene of sus­
pected criminal activity doesn’t lead to an inference that one
is involved*
Second, again, it would make every warrant into a
general warrant»

And it would also apparently put the burden

on the person to be searched to avoid being searched*

He would

have to demonstrate to the officers that he was not involved in
the criminal activity, that he was not connected with the prem­
ises in order to avoid search, instead of requiring the officers
to articulate the reasons why they are searching*

As a result,

it could subject virtually anyone to a search, on the basis not
of specific knowledge on the part of police, but because they
had no knowledge, just because they had no knowledge about that
person*

Under the State’s test, they could search him*
Even if this initial patdown,

this first intrusion in

the case had been permissible, it wasn’t the end of it*
was a second search here*

There

Even though the officer testified he

hadn’t found a weapon, even though all he had felt was what he
described as a cigarette pack with objects in it, there was a

second search.

He explicitly testified that he believed,after

the first search and before the second search, that he had no
knowledge that Ventura Ybarra had any contraband.
very testimony.

That was his

He didn't have any knowledge that Ventura

Ybarra had any contraband,

And despite that he went ahead and

searched him again a second time,
1 think the reason why Officer Johnson honestly admit­
ted he had no knowledge is because the feeling through a pat down of a cigarette pack with objects in it can’t logically give
one any reasonable suspicion of probable cause,
QUESTIONS

What is this about Greg?

You said he wasn't

i

there,
MR, GOLDBERGs

The record does not indicate that he

was there, and there was no testimony that he was present.

And

in the closing argument in the supression hearing, the argument
proceeded on the assumption that he was not present at the time
the warrant was executed,
QUESTION;

You mean there was a bar without a bartender

MR, GOLDBERGs

Well, apparently, there was another bar­

tender there by the name of Peggy Miller who — on whom the
warrant was served, but Greg apparently was not there, the
personv who was dealing narcotics,
Now, this second search on the basis of no suspicion
or probable cause was improper because thfr feeling of the cigar­
ette package with the object in it could not logically lead one

16

to conclude anything about the person.
what the objects ware.

The officer didn't feel

They could have been a lighter or a book

of matches or any other innocent object, and that's why he hon­
estly testified that he didn't have any knowledge that there was
any contraband on Ventura Ybarra at that point.
Now, the State also offers an alternative argument in
their brief, and that is that the pat doi^n of all people on the
premises when the officers entered was permissible not as a search
£>r weapons but as a search for contraband, based on reasonable
suspicions

And, at some length, they discussed whether reasonable

suspicion or probable cause should apply in a situation like
this.

While the decisions of this Court would indicate that

probable cause is the relevant standard when the search is for
contraband, in this case the search would have been impermis­
sible under any standard, because there is no suspicion of any
kind.

The only suspicion offered by the State, again, is their

assertion that the narcotics dealing was open and notorious, and,
as I said earlier, the officer's testimony, the circumstances
which confronted the officer, the complaint for search warrant,
all indicate that there was nothing about the criminal activity
on these premises that was open and notorious.

There was no

reason to believe that a lawful patron would know of the criminal
activity.
QUESTION?

In your submission, the search would — had

the search revealed the heroin the first time around it would

17

be just as unlawful as you contend with respect to the second?
\

MR# GOLDBERG*

Well, if the officer, in patting someone

down, had found heroin,and, of course, in patting someone down
it would be extremely difficult to find heroin, since you are
limited to the outer garments? but if the officer had found heroin
on the initial pat down,

it would have been equally illegal be-

cause that initial pat down

was illegal0

So, it would be our argument that both the initial
intrusion was illegal, because there was no reasonable suspicion
to justify, and that the second patdown

was -- or the second

search was impermissible because there was neither reasonable
suspicion or probable cause»
QUESTION*

In the Illinois Appellate Division opinion

on page 80 of the Appendix, it says, “In the first patdown of the
defendant at the bar, a cigarette package with objects in it was
felt by the officer#

Within a few minutes the officer again

searched the person of the defendant and found six tinfoil packs
of heroin#"
Now, let’s pretermit for a moment your argument about
the first patdown

being illegal, and assume that it was legal.

Would you say that the second patdown

was not legal under those

circumstances?
MR# GOLDBERG:

I would say so,^because the feeling of

a cigarette pack with objects in it cannot logically give rise
tc any suspicion that a person has some contraband on his person.

18

QUESTION?

In spite of the search warrant saying this

is a place where heroin is frequently bought and sold* and that
this is a normal way of carrying heroin?
MR. GOLDBERGs

Well* the search warrant doesn't allege

that a cigarette pack is a normal way of carrying heroin.

I

imagine there are a myriad number of containers in which heroin
can be carried.

But even though the officers knew or had prob­

able cause to believe that there was heroin on the premises*
feeling a cigarette package doesn't give one probable cause to
believe that person has heroin.

Maybe half of the patrons would

have a cigarette package* in those circumstances.

If that were

true* that the patron on whom — that the officers patted down
on whom they felt the cigarette package
QUESTIONS

But it doesn't say that they patted down

and felt a cigarette package with cigarettes in it.
with objects in it.
six tinfoil

It says

And these objects later turned out to be

packs of heroin.

Now* it doesn’t say they were

shaped like cigarettes,
MR. GOLDBERGs
six tinfoil

No* but the officer didn't feel -those

packets of heroin in the initial patdown.

The

only thing he could say was that he felt the cigarette package
with objects in it.

And then he further said that even after

feeling that cigarette packet with objects in it he didn’t have
any knowledge that Ybarra had contraband.

So he attached no

significance to the feeling of the cigarette package with objects

As far as he knew —
QUESTION?

He didn?t even know it was a cigarette

MR» GOLDBERGs

Well, I think he indicated, at one point

in his testimony, that he felt nothing, and then later on, in
response to a question by the Prosecutor, he said he felt what
he thought was a cigarette pack»
QUESTION!

It might not have been»

MR» GOLDBERGs

It might not have been a cigarette

package»
QUESTIONS

Mr» Goldberg, you made emphasis on the

difference between, what you call, the first search and the
second search*

How much time lapsed between the two?

MR* GOLDBERGs

Variously it is described in the record

as three minutes or ten minutes,
QUESTION s

And I suppose the primary concern was for

the presence of weapons, wasn’t it?

Are you faulting them be­

cause he may have finished his primary patdown

of all the

patrons and then came back to this one, or that he should have
taken a chance on the presence of weapons, and Number 10 down
the line?
MR» GOLDBERGs

We are faulting him as to both»

In

other words, the officer had no reason and indicated in his
testimony that he had no reason to suspect any of the patrons
of criminal activity, and so there was no justification for

20

the initial intrusion, the intial patdown,

And then beyond

that, after feeling no weapons and feeling nothing which would
give him probable cause to believe that Ventura Ybarra had con­
traband, he went and made a second search.

So, on both points

we believe the intrusions were improper,
QUESTION;

No reason to suspect criminal activity,

despite the contents of the application for the search warrant?
MR, GOLDBERGs
patdown

No reason with respect to the first

to suspect that any of these patrons were involved, by

his own admission, by his own testimony,
\

QUESTION s

*

Are not violence and gunplay/ rather common

in narcotics transactions?
MR, GOLDBERGs

I imagine that in narcotics transactions

violence and cpassplay may be involved, but —
QUESTIONS

You imagine?

MR, GOLDBERGs

I accept that it is, and I accept that

under circumstances in which search warrants for narcotics are
being executed there may be many circumstances in which the
police find it necessary to pat down all the people there.
This officer didn't think it was necessary.

This officer didn't

have any indication that there was any gunplay that was to be
involved.

There was nothing in the circumstances, by his own

admission, that gave him any indication that there was any in~
volvement on the part of the patrons in criminal activity.

And

he, himself, admitted he simply didn't think the patrons were

21

involved 0
Maybe it is a unique situation,, but 1 think there will
be many search warrants for public places , and those search
warrants by themselves cannot give the police authority to pat
down everybody in a public place.

If the police have some sus­

picion, if they have some reason to proceed in that manner,
then we have no objection to it.

But this officer admitted he

didn't have any reason for proceeding in that manner.

And for

that reason we believe both the initial intrusion and the second
search were improper.
QUESTION?

Suppose the officer testified »- since we

are getting into hypothetical situations ~~ Suppose he had
testified that he felt a package with some objects in 'which he
thought might be the little packages of heroin, but that he
decided, to make no issue of it on the first search to see whether
the subject would try to pass the heroin on to somebody else
ar.d then get two customers,instead of one,on possession charges.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. NOEL;

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please the

Courts
My name is Melbourne Noel.

I represent the State of

Illinois* Appellee in this particular matter,
Illinois submits* Your Honors* that the officers went
tc the Aurora Tap with a valid search warrant for the premises
on March 1st* properly followed the dictates of common police
i

sense in their actions leading to a discovery of six tinfoil,
packets of heroin on Ventura Ybarra.
The State suggests that Appellant’s criticism of police
action here is contrary to common sense.

Indeed# I think that

perhaps the crucial dispute in this case * between both aides* is
what amounts to a commonsense reading of* first of all* the com­
plaint for the search warrant# and then the testimony of the
police officer at 'the suppression hearing.

24

The two sides really do interpret those documents and
testimony in very different fashions.

We maintain that our in­

terpretation, taking the inferences from the logical meaning of
these documents, is the correct one.
Illinois suggests that if the complete position of the
Appellant in this case is accepted by this Court that all drug
enforcement officers will be less able to lawfully protect them­
selves from attack in similar situations, while they follow
orders to execute search warrants that will, themselves, be
rendered more ineffectual.
QUESTIONS

How could they be attacked after they

patted them down?
MR. NOELs

One of the issues here, Your Honor —

QUESTION <

How could they have been attacked after they

petted them down?
MR. NOELs

They couldn’t.

QUESTIONS

They could not?

MR. NOELS

No.

QUESTIONS

So, you don’t have any justification for the

second search at all, do you?
MR. NOELs

It is our argument — and we are agreeing

that they should have been patted down the first time.
our argument is that the first patdown

Could you have patted down a man coming in

And I want to be fair with you* if you answer that

that way I am going to ask yous Could you pat him down on the
pavement?

And you can9t imagine where I am going from there0
MR* NOELs

There are circumstances on which a patdown

for weapons* I think* could be justified by a person coming in
the door*

There would have to be more facts than simply an in­

dividual coming in the door*

It depends who the person was*

You know* was it a nun collecting for a charitable event* or
was it a certain type of individual that had other particular
factors about him?
QUESTION?

I say it is possible*
Mine did not include a nun*

You can have my

wcrd for that*
«

MR* NOELs

But my point is* it would depend on the

character of this individual coming in the door*

I think there

would be circumstances in which a patdown would be justified of
a person coming in the door,

Generally* I would say* there

would be very few circumstances in which a patdown would be
justified of a person coming in the door during a search* very
few circumstances*
QUESTION?

But I think they could be imagined*
Certainly* if it were Greg coining in the

ckor* a patdown would be indication?
MR* NOELs

Yes* I think so* Your Honor*
\

QUESTIONs

Mr* Noel* I am puzsled by your saying very

few circumstances* because any stranger walking in the door «—

26

say he's just dressed in work clothes like the other people in
the bar — why would you treat him any differently than soroone
already in?

He's just another customer,

MR, NOELs

Wellr I think the first thing, Your Honor,

is that in most situations the man probably would not be allotted
to walk in the door,

I would think probably there would be

policemen at the door to explain to him —
QUESTION2

Well, now you are changing — But if the

question is assumed someone is permitted to walk in, wouldn't he
be fungible with the other customers, if he just wore the same
kind of clothes and everything?

I am kind of surprised you said

it would be very rare that you could pat him down„
MR, NOELs

Well, perhaps not rare, but I think it would

require an articulation of more than we would articulate of the
people in the bar,
QUESTION?

What do you have about a person in the bar,

other than the fact that he previoxisly walked in?

That's really

all you know about him,
MR, NOELs

Well, he is present around the bar, and he

is on the location where the police officers are going to be
forced to subject themselves to some risk in order to carry out
the search warrant.,
QUESTION?

But so is the person walking in the door,

as soon as he gets across the threshold,
MR, NOELj

That's true, Your Honor,

27

All I am trying to say — Maybe I misspoke# Youf Honor#
in trying to quantify the number of circumstances in which this
would have come about.

What I am saying is# that I would hope

that there would be more things that one could say about the
person walking in the door than simply he walked in the door.
Hopefully# there would be some additional factors about how was
he dressed.

Did he have on —

QUESTIONt

But you don't say any of those things about

the people who previously walked through the door.
MR. NOELs

Yes# we do# Your Honor.

AFTERNOON SESSION
(1;00 p.m„)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Noel, you may continue»

MELBOURNE A. NOEL, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

{Resumed)

MR. NOEL; Thank you, Your Honor.
In further answer to Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice
Stevens’ question, this obviously is a difficult area, because
three different courts in Illinois presented with this type of
fast situation have come up with slightly different conclusions
based on the facts of their particular case.

Indeed, the same

is true of courts in other states.
QUESTION;

Are you defending the .reasoning of the court

below,, which,as I take it,had nothing to do with whether there
was a patdown or not?

As far as I could see, the officer could

just have come in and searched anybody, patdown or not, under
the statute.
MR. NOEL;

We do defend the reasoning of the court

below, which did not rely on a frisk.
as Your Honor correctly points out.

They didn't deal with that,
They relied on the second

section of the statute, the reasonable belief that the people
in the Aurora Tap were involved with the criminal activity and
were likely to be concealing the objects of the search on their
person.
QUESTION*

And that would certainly distinguish the

29

people who were there from the people who arrived after the
search began»
MR. NOELs

Up to that pointy yes*

questions were related to the frisk.

But tha other

As to che search for the

narcotics themselves on the persons of the patrons, we defend
the decision below on that as an alternative argument. And in
doing so, we ask this Court to apply the Camara-Terry balancing
test to allow this type —QUESTIONS

That's a lot of factual -*- has soma fact­

finding in it, hasn't it?

Has the fact-finding been done in

the courts balottf?
HR. NOEL:

I think that — Does Your Honor refer to

fact-finding with regard to the public interest need, and that
sort of thing?

I think that there are enough opinions written

or the general subject.

There is enough legislation written on

the subject of drug control.

And certainly this Court has

written enough opinions on the subject of the ’saeredness of the
warrant and the desirability of it, that I think those interests
dcn’t need to ba developed any further, in order to justify the
balancing test we are talking about.
And I. think although the Appellate Court opinion
specifically didn't invoke this, I think in other Illinois
court opinions on ’die same statute there is reference, the most
recent one being People v, Gloria Miller, which we — It was
sc recent we had to include it in our brief as an appendix.

It

30

wasn’t published at that time.

In that decision, the Illinois

Appellate Court,Eirst District, clearly employed the balancing
test and refers to this Court’s recent decision in Delaware v.
Prouse and concludes that "a reasonable belief of the•connec­
tion of the individual to the suspected criminal activity, and
a reasonable belief that he is concealing the narcotics on him"
is required before there can be a search under the Illinois
statute,
QUESTION3

Even if this Court hadn’t decided the Terry

case as it did, your position, I take it, is that under this
statute all of these steps were appropriate?

You draw your

authority from the statute independent of Terry?
MR, NQELs

We don’t rely so much on the statute for

the frisk, Your Honor, because we don’t feel that we have to.
If the whole question of frisk goes out the window here and all
we are left with is whether or not the search for narcotics on
the individual person of Ybarra was proper, then we rely on our
statute, and we rely on the second section of the statute,
QUESTION3

I am not suggesting you can’t rely on Terry

in part, but primarily you are drawing on the statutory authority
here?
MR. NOEL
tive arguments.

-$

Your Honor, wa make two completely alterna­

And frankly the argument we prefer is the first

one, the- argument involving proper frisk of Ybarra, which yields
probable cause to believe, then, that he has the objects of the

31

warrant on him.

That's the argument we prefer.

Our secondary position is the Appellate Court position
below,which relies on the statute»
entitled to make those arguments*

And we feel that we are
As Appellee, I believe, that

we can rtfly on any ground which would support the judgment
below*
indeed, this Court in the Sibron decision indicated
that decisions on Fourth Amendment questions —
QUESTION3

Excuse me*

Was this particular ground

presented to the court below?
MR* NOEL?

It was not directly presented to the

Appellate Coiurfc*
QUESTION?

And was never decided?

MR9 NQELs

It was never decided in so many words*

The

trial judge indicated — Your Honor is talking about the first
point?
QUESTION*

The. first point*

MR* NOEL3

It was never decided specifically

QUESTION*

Was it presented?

Was it ever raised in

the state courts anywhere?
MR* NOEL?

It was raised in the testimony and presen­

tation of the agent witness at the suppression hearing and at
the trial*

It is there in his testimony*

It was never argued

by the State's Attorney, either in that, court or in the Appellate
Court*

32

QUESTIONS

Was it

The State never defended on that

MR« NOELs

The State never briefed that point, that’s

ground?

correct, Your Honor.
I would maintain that it is Inherent in the testimony
of the officer.

At least four times, during the trial court

proceeding, he mentioned that the first search of Ybarra was
for the purpose for discovering weapons, to protect the police
officers.

So, regardless of whether the Illinois Court saw

the issue and dealt with it, it was there.
And, as this Court held in Sibron, decisions of State
Courts on Fourth Amendment areas, based on State law, are not
binding on this Court.

The Court said in Sibron that this

Court, in looking at a situation, can determine independently
whether or not there was probable cause, under the Fourth
Amendment, or whatever standard is being used.
I would ask this Court to do that, and that’s the
reason we make the first argument.
QUESTIONS

It seems to me that when the Illinois

Appellate Court relied on the second section, it implicitly
rejected the first argument.

The first section of the statute

talks about justifying it, to protect themselves from attack.
And that’s the purpose of the frisk.
MR. NOELs

I don’t think that’s accurate, Your Honor,

because they simply had never been bri€ifed on the first point,

33

on the frisk points and they simply didn’t address it because
it was not raised#
QUESTION?

But the statute was called to their atten­

tion, including both sections of it#
MR# NOEL?

That*s correct, but the State’s theory in

the Appellate Court was simply on Subsection (b), Search for
Nercotics#

And the Appellate Court just doesn’t usually address

issues that are not briefed specifically before it#
QUESTION?

But if your frisk theory is valid, you would

also be entitled to rely on Subsection (a), I would think#

If

the purpose of a frisk is to protect the officer from attack,
and Subsection (a) expressly says that is a permissible —
MR# NOEL?

X would agree, Your Honor*

Our only feeling

is that that Subsection (a) is really superfluous in light of
Terry*

We don’t need it#

any point to arguing it#

It wasn’t invoked#

We don’t feel

We rely on Terry and on this Court's

probable cause decisions following that#
QUESTION?

Isn’t the predicate to relying on Terry

seme finding that the officer reasonably feared that the suspect
was armed?
MR# NOEL?

Yes, Your Honor, it is# '*

QUESTION s

Why was it you never relied on Terry,?'

34

MR® NOELj
Your Honor®

I don't know why they weren’t presented,

I wish they were®

QUESTIONs Well, I know, but if it $as never presented
How could any court have addressed the predicate to Terry, if
the Terry argument was never made?
MR® NOELs

Your Honor, the testimony of the agent is

quite clear as to what he felt was the danger presented by the
patrons in the bar and why he made the first patdown®

The

initial patdpwn of all the people in the bar is clearly un­
deniable

only for one reason®

It is a search for weapons.

Tbs reason why all the patrons were searched before Ybarra was
searched the second time was strictly because security and
protection was more important than anything that might have
been raised during the first patdown of Ybarra, with regard to
the objects in the warrant*
Then, on top of that, you have the background of the
complaint for search warranty

specifically setting cut — and

we disagree totally with opposing counsel's interpretation of
it -- sp@«if:xally setting out that over a period of days or
weeks there was open and notorious drug traffic, not useage or
possession, but traffic of drugs in this location®

The informant

went into the tavern,apparently as a patron, on at least — he
said at least tan other occasions he had been there and had
observed tinfoil packets on and about the person of the bartender
Greg, in a drawer behind the bar»

And than on this particular

35

weekend,v of February 28—29th, he had seen no fewer than 15 to
25 packets of tinfoil on or about the person of Greg.
Now, we submit to you there is no possible logical
way to read this, other than that these packets, so many packets
of tinfoil were there because heroin was being sold in this
location.

And we say that as a matter of judicial notice any

ccurtr“-based on the huge amount of jurisprudence on this subject
and taking notice of the fact that where you have dealing in
significant quantities of narcotics there is always a danger of
violence.

There is always the possibility, and indeed the

likelihood of weapons being found on the individual dealers.
QUESTIONS

If analytically probable cause will justify
■

'

•

'

a search either for weapons’br for contraband, why won’t
reasonable suspicion justify a patdown, either for weapons or
contraband4?-putting to on® side the Terry case?
MR. NOEL:

I would agree that our position would be

that both are reasonable! both are good positions, but they
J

would be for different reasons.

The patdown fdr weapons is

based on a different consideration.

It is based on — The

balancing test there — We are primarily concerned, of course,
with the protection of the officers.

The balancing test to

allow a patdown to discover the narcotics"', ’’based" on reasonable
suspicion, would have a different cast of characters.

In the

balance there, you have the interest not being the protection
of the police officers, but there you have the interest being

36

the great legislatively stated purpose in checking the debili­
tating use of narcotics in this country#and the judicial
purpose in exalting and vindicating the effectiveness of search
warrants.
So# I would say there is no reason why it couldn’t be
dene for both purposes# but the balancing tests would have
different features in each situation,
QUESTIONS

were found in this case?

We are not trying to go backwards

So* our position then on the frisk simply isfwhat we
are asking the Court to do is to recognise not only*as Terry did,
that certain observed activities on the part of the suspect can
lead to reasonable suspicion that he is armed and dangerous.
We are asking the Court to interpret Terry to allow general
knowledge of narcotics traffic, and general background knowledge
contained in th® complaint for search warrant to provide the
same kind of basis for a frisk that there was in Terry»
As I was pointing out in Pennsylvania v. Mimms, the
only indication that the police officer had in going under the
coat of the driver of the automobile, once he got him out on
the side of the road, was that there was a bulge under there,
This individual had been engaged in no felonious activity
whatsoever.
all»

There was no information about him personally at

Yet th® simple1 fact that he had been pulled over for —

an expired license, ahd had a bulge under his coat, this Court
found summarily was sufficient basis to justify the frisk.
And we would submit ‘that in a much more dangerous situ­
ation of police officers executing a judicially ordered search

40

of a place where there had been open and notorious drug traffic,
that in that situation they must be allowed, under these circum­
stances, to at least frisk — they must be allowed to frisk at
least the people on the premises to determine whether or not
there is any threat to their safety, before they go ahead with
the search®

And that*s exactly what we have here®

MR® NOELi

But under the lower court decisions which

have dealt with this problem, it is held that if they obtain,

in the course of a frisk,reasonable cause — if they feel
something which gives them probable cause, rather, to believe
that the objects of a warrant are in a pocket, rather than a

41

weapon, they are allowed to operate on this*

They are not

required, under the decisions, to simply ignore the feeling
of the cigarette pack with objects in it, and say, "Well, it is
not a weapon, so we can't touch it,"

That would be requiring

them to give up their own intelligent commonsense

assessment^

second search, that search that turned up the tinfoil packets
of heroin, ha at least had a lesser Camara-type probable cause
or a Terry reasonable belief, that the bar and/or his fellow
patrons were connected with the illegal drug activity on the
premises, and may have had the objects of the warrant concealed
on their persons,,

which the Court could affirm the decision below, one of them
argued primarily in our brief, the other mentioned in Footnote
10, ascribed to Professor LeFavre,
Really, regardless of which theory is used, they are
bcth two parallel ways to describe the same basis for the search,
the same information and reaching the same result.

We believe

that the lesser reasonable belief test is more appropriate in
this case.

That's what we are emphasising, primarily because it is

a matter of consistency with this Court's prior decisions, and
also trying to create a level of certainty for police officers
tc operate under.

We think either theory could justify the

decision of the Appellate Court below.

And, of course, both

theories involve a balancing test which was used in Camara,
- Terry and other cases that we cite.
We feel that under a balancing test -- we feel that
we have here such strong Governmental interest in the con­
trolling of drug traffic, and very importantly, I think — very
importantly — we are not dealing here with warantless search

automobile,,

Secondly,, that case was really pre-Terry and pre-

Camara, and therefore it never really considered the possibility
of a balancing test being appropriate in some situations.
Our issue here, our specific issue, was never decided
in that case.

It was really only alluded to.

For the reasons, then, stated in our brief, we simply
ask that the Court affirm the judgment below.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have two minutes left,

Mr. Goldberg, I believe.
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN D. GOLDBERG, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GOLDBERG:

Thank you.

All I really wish to say at this point is that although
Counsel for the State constantly refers to the Terry opinion,
nothing in Tarry supports an automatic right to frisk in this
situation.

Terry sets forth a standard of reasonable suspicion,

reasonable belief.

And the State’s position, in Part 1 of their

brief, is that they can frisk automatically when they are execufc
ing a warrant without reasonable suspicion, and Terry simply
doesn’t support that position.
And the only other thing I would say is that, again,
the State contends that somewhere in this record there is. an
indication that drug traffic was open and notorious.

I have

gone through the factors in the record that 1 think indicate

48

t

just the opposite, and indicate that the officers belief was
just the opposite»

I could argue until I am blue in the face

that it wasn't open and notorious, and the State is really saying
nothing any more than contradicting me.

They are not pointing

to anything in the record ~~
QUESTION s How about the transcript at page 9, at the
bottom of it,where it says, “What happened during the patdown,
if anything?” And Officer Johnson responds, “During the patdown,
I felt some objects that I felt to be heroin,”
MR, GOLDBERGs That gets to the other point of whether
there was probable cause or reason for suspicion for its second
intrusion.

And then at that point the trial attorney objects

and the Court says, basically,“you can*t tell us what you felt,
you have to tell us what facts led you to reach that belief.”
QUESTIONS

Yes, but that would at least establish a

subjective belief on his part.

Admittedly the test is a

subjec­

tive one.
MR. GOLDBERG;

Right,

At that point — this is the

preliminary hearing «— it does seem to indicate a subjective
belief.

Everywhere else in the record he says he doesn't have

a subjective belief.

At this point, which is about a month

before the suppression hearing, he seemed to think so,

When he

reconsidered his testimony later on, he didn't have that subjec­
tive belief.

Perhaps, he had realized himself how illogical

it was to feel a cigarette pack and think that it contains heroin.

49

That was just a hunch,

And that also invalidates the second

search.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:27 o’clock, p.m., the case was
submitted.)
