ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. SCOTT BALLENGER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BALLENGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

Section 3 First (q) of the Railway Labor Act

12

says that the findings in an order of the division shall

13

be conclusive on the parties, except that the order of

14

the division may be set aside for one of three specified

15

reasons.

16

this context, "except" means that there are three and

17

only three exceptions to the otherwise conclusive nature

18

of these awards.

19

As a matter of plain dictionary meaning in

In the Sheehan case, this Court explains

20

that the dispositive question is whether the parties'

21

objections falls within one of the three reasons

22

specified within the statute.

23

the statutory language means just what it says and that

24

a contrary conclusion would ignore the terms,

25

purposes -

This Court explained that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, the circuit

2

court did things in an unusual order.

3

reaching the statutory question, it reached the

4

constitutional question, in par, because it viewed the

5

two as intertwined.

6

Instead of

Why isn't its judgment that there's a

7

statutory violation what's at issue before us, because

8

that's what they said?

9

MR. BALLENGER:

Well, Your Honor, it

10

certainly would be this Court's prerogative and

11

appropriate for this Court to choose to reach the

12

statutory ground first, but we think that the

13

Respondents have no viable claim under the statute, and

14

so then -

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

MR. BALLENGER:

Why not?

Their only claim under the

17

statute is under the second statutory ground of review

18

for an award that fails to confine or conform itself to

19

the board's jurisdiction.

20

jurisdiction -

21
22

An arbitrator's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

It's an award that

is contrary to the act.

23

MR. BALLENGER:

But, Your Honor -

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

MR. BALLENGER:

That's the -

They -- they have never made

that argument, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I saw it in their

3

brief to the Ninth Circuit.

4

the requirements of the act and of circular one and said

5

the board's ruling is not based on those.

6

MR. BALLENGER:

The Ninth Circuit analyzed

Your Honor, on -- on page 5

7

of their brief to the Seventh Circuit, they waived any

8

argument based on that first statutory ground of review.

9

There was a first count in their petition for review

10

that was based on that statutory ground, and on page 5

11

they renounced it.

12

The only -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's the same argument -

14

it's the same argument, as if you had an APA case, and

15

the words in the APA are "arbitrary, capricious, abuse

16

of discretion," so somebody who has an unfair procedure

17

says it violates those words.

18

MR. BALLENGER:

Well, if -

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I don't really see that

20

it's any different, except we normally go to those words

21

before we would decide a due process question.

22

similar kind of question.

23

thing here?

24
25

It's the

Why wouldn't we do the same

MR. BALLENGER:

Your Honor, I think that

there is an important difference.

The first ground of

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

review under the act provides review for violations of

2

the plain terms of the RLA itself.

3

for an act in excess of jurisdiction, which the lower

4

courts have correctly understood to be a reference to

5

this Court's Steelworker trilogy standard of review for

6

labor arbitration generally.

7

jurisdiction is to interpret and to apply the parties'

8

agreement and the relevant arbitral rules.

9

arbitrator exceeds his jurisdiction if but only if,

The second ground is

An arbitrator's

An

10

under this Court's well-settled case law, his decision

11

isn't even arguably construing or applying the relevant

12

principles, and this decision clearly satisfies that

13

standard, Your Honor.

14

I would urge the Court to look at the

15

board's decision in this case, and one of the five

16

appears at pages 65 -- 65a to 72a of the petition

17

appendix.

21

both parties in support of their respective positions";

22

and that "An evidentiary process after the appeal to

requirements contained in circular 1, as well as the

25

weight of arbitral precedents supporting the carrier's

The relevant reasoning starts on 68a to 71a.

The board says that, quote:

2

Well, what are those requirements?

Section

3

301.2(b) of circular 1 expressly says that, quote:

4

petition shall be considered by any division of the

5

board unless the subject matter has been handled in

6

accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor

7

Act," which includes the statutory requirement that a

8

conference must have occurred.

9

understood that -

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

"No

The board has reasonably

May I ask, just to be -

11

do you -- do you contest the question of whether there

12

was conferencing?

13

MR. BALLENGER:

It's a complex question,

14

Your Honor.

15

when this issue came up, Union Pacific went back to its

16

records and determined that it had proof in its own

17

records that two of the five cases had been conferenced.

18

And so we essentially conceded that point in the

19

arbitration.

20
21
22

In the arbitration, Union Pacific went -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You conceded that there

was conferencing?
MR. BALLENGER:

We didn't contest that point

23

in the arbitration.

24

correctly determined that it was irrelevant.

25

Of course, the arbitrators

As to the other three, the -- Union Pacific
7
Alderson Reporting Company

did not have in its files the paperwork that it would

2

expect to see there if conferences occurred.

3
4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So -

I'm not sure that answers

my question.

5

MR. BALLENGER:

Well, we took the position

6

in the arbitration that we don't know for sure whether

7

conferencing occurred and that it's Respondent's burden

8

to prove it, and that the proof that they proffered in

9

the arbitration was not convincing and sufficient to

10

satisfy their burden.

In two cases, that appears

16

to be correct, Justice Ginsburg.

17

that fact is not relevant because the board enforced its

procedural rule that the evidence of conferencing -

23

for want of jurisdiction.

24
25

But, of course, the

Yes, but the board can

It can't make rules of

The dismissal of all these petitions was

Now, if the board has no authority to set
its jurisdiction -- and I think that's plain; Congress
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

has that authority, not the board -- then it is required

2

to exercise the jurisdiction that Congress gave it.

3

why isn't that the very first question that this Court

4

should deal with?

5

The board threw these cases out for want of

6

jurisdiction.

7

could not be jurisdictional because the board has no

8

authority to describe its own jurisdiction.

9

So

Whatever the failing was, it was not and

MR. BALLENGER:

But Your Honor, the

10

board was -- I think the board is entitled to mean

11

different things by the word "jurisdiction" than perhaps

12

an Article 3 court would mean.

13

many different things when it uses that word.

This Court often means

14

What the board held was that the -- under

15

the language of circular 1 and the weight of arbitral

16

precedent the board cannot consider information that is

17

not included in the parties' initial submissions.

18

board has understood for a very long time, consistent

19

with the language of circular 1, like Section 301.2(a),

20

that it is an appellate body that makes decisions on the

21

basis of a record that is before it, that was organized

22

on property and presented by the parties in their

23

initial submissions.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

So you say this is just a

mistaken use of words, rather than -- than the board
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

saying, under our rules, we don't have power to handle

2

this?

3

MR. BALLENGER:

The substance -- I think it

4

can -- you can get tied up in the word "jurisdiction" in

5

a way that makes it more confusing than it needs to be.

6

What the board held was that the confluence

7

of the procedural rules, specific procedural rules, in

8

circular 1 established two propositions:

9

the board cannot consider a matter unless conferencing

First, that

10

in fact occurred; and second, that the only evidence

11

that the board is ever allowed to look at under its own

12

procedural rules is the evidence that is in the initial

13

submissions.

14

If you put -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you -- do you dispute

15

what your opponent tells us, that some panels of the

16

board, even when there has been no conference, let alone

17

no proof of a conference, but some panels have stayed

18

proceedings to allow the conference to occur, and then

19

the board will pick up?

20

MR. BALLENGER:

That -- we don't contest

21

that, Justice Ginsburg.

22

ordinary agency adjudication of the sort conducted under

23

the APA, where the board has to stand behind as an

24

entity every decision that is made by any panel.

25

But, of course, this isn't

This is a peculiar sort of agency-supervised
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arbitration, and it's perfectly appropriate in this

2

context for two simultaneous panels of the board to

3

reach different interpretations of the same language.

4

And a Court really -

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's true generally,

6

but if the board believes that as a matter of law it

7

can't hear this dispute and consider normal grounds for

8

excusing a failure to include something in the record

9

because, in its own language, we can't do it, the law

10

doesn't permit us to do it, we have no jurisdiction to

11

consider matters outside the record, we don't apply

12

normal rules of waiver or forfeiture or any of the other

13

rules that attend themselves to a failure of a party to

14

immediately raise a defense like you could have done and

15

waited two and a half years to do, doesn't that suggest

16

that the board is not reaching -- merely resting its

17

decision on a merely procedural rule, it's resting its

18

decision on its erroneous view that the law deprives it

19

of jurisdiction to hear the case?

20

MR. BALLENGER:

I don't believe so, Your

21

Honor.

22

the Sheehan case itself the suggestion that there is

23

independent judicial review just because a question of

24

law is at stake.

25

First of all, this Court squarely rejected in

That was the -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, but that -- this is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not merely a question of law.

2

jurisdiction:

3

This is a question of

Is it entitled to hear a dispute by law?

MR. BALLENGER:

There is no question, no one

4

has ever disputed in this case, that the board was

5

entitled to hear this matter.

6

For instance, the question of arbitral

7

jurisdiction, no one has ever disputed that this Court

8

-- that this dispute was properly before the board.

9

board resolved it.

The

The board simply resolved it on

10

procedural grounds.

11

was that considering material outside of the initial

12

submissions would be contrary to circular 1 and to the

13

weight of arbitral precedent directly on the point.

14

And the explanation that it gave

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I am looking at the

15

decision and they are all identical in this respect.

16

The board said it has no jurisdiction to consider any of

17

the remaining procedural or substantive issues

18

associated with this claim.

19

"No jurisdiction," that sounds like they are

20

saying:

21

this case; we must toss it out because there is no proof

22

of the conference.

23

We have no authority to consider anything about

MR. BALLENGER:

Again, Your Honor, I think

24

the important point is that the board is not required to

25

use the word "jurisdiction" in precisely this sense.

There is no question that the board has jurisdiction

is a word of many meanings, too many meanings.

They're -- they certainly

JUSTICE BREYER:

But this Court

Can you -- could you go

back for a minute?

complicated, but for me, I read the AFL-CIO brief and

18

that's what I am thinking of and it seems this is not

19

such a hard case.

20

with words of procedure, and it isn't too difficult to

21

interpret that statute as meaning that the board should

22

have fair procedure, not unfair procedure.

23

I mean, this reads as if it's very

Basically, there is a statute filled

Now, if you are willing to make that giant

24

step, the remaining issue in the case is whether the

25

procedure here was fair or unfair.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

And the Seventh

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Circuit is filled with pages of opinion that explains

2

why it was unfair.

3

unfair is because no one in his right mind previous to

4

this case would have thought that you should fill up

5

your brief with a lot of facts that nobody's going to

6

contest.

7

way, you have to put in a whole lot of jurisdictional

8

facts even if nobody is going to contest them, and since

9

you didn't do it, you are out, and we won't even give

And the reason basically it was

So I read that.

12

something wrong with that?

13

you, because you would know.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. BALLENGER:

I thought, is there

And then I thought I'd ask

I think that there are

16

several things wrong with it, Your Honor, starting from

17

the premise that the statute guarantees in all instances

18

procedures that are, quote unquote, "fair" in an

19

untethered sense.

20

This statute guarantees specific procedural

21

rights, which if you put them together do guarantee fair

22

procedures.

24

specific procedures that are guaranteed by the statute

were complied with, and they were.

But it doesn't guarantee fairness in the
So what you have to look at are whether the

Now, taking a step back, even if we are

2

going to talk about what is fair and unfair, there is

3

absolutely nothing unfair about what happened here.

4

the board explained, referencing its own prior

5

precedents and the plain language of the regulations

6

that are governing, the Respondents clearly were on

7

notice that they had to do this.

8
9

Several prior decisions of the board had
dismissed grievances for precisely the reason that there

10

was no evidence of conferencing in the on-property

11

record.

12

appendix 18679 from the first -

13

That is if you look at page 40 of the joint

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Are there any -- is there

14

any rule describing how one has to get this into the

15

record?

16

proper way to prove that conferencing occurred?

17

As

It's just-- how -- what would have been the

MR. BALLENGER:

As the board has explained

18

in prior cases, the ordinary method of proving that

19

conferencing occurred is that the last exchange of

20

correspondence on the property between the carrier and

21

the union, references the conference that had occurred

22

and what happened.

23

the -- the union use that exchange of correspondence

24

to -- in their initial submissions to the board pursuant

25

to section 301.2(a), which requires, consistent with the

And then both parties or -- or

Alderson Reporting Company

text of the statute itself, that every submission of the

2

board will include, quote, "A full statement of the

3

facts and all supporting data bearing on the dispute."

4
5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But that doesn't refer to

conferencing, does it?

6

MR. BALLENGER:

A full statement of -- of

7

all of the facts and supporting data, which includes

8

conferencing.

9
10

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Implicitly includes con -

not expressly includes conferencing.

11

MR. BALLENGER:

Well, that's how the board

12

has understood it, and, of course, the board is entitled

13

as an arbitral body to interpret its own rules.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

15

MR. BALLENGER:

I see.
Within the enormous

16

discretion that this Court has established in the

17

Steelworkers trilogy standard of review, which is that

as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or

19

applying the appropriate principles, his decision has to

stand.

according to the standards set up in the statute.

4

will happen that boards -- that panels disagree about

5

the proper resolution of an issue.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It

That's happened -

So does the board as a

7

whole apparently, because I am looking at the

8

instruction about joint exhibits and it tells the

9

parties, when you are going to make a submission don't

10

include unnecessary documents, and among things don't

11

include things that aren't in dispute -

12

MR. BALLENGER:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

Three things about -- like letters

requesting conferences.

15

MR. BALLENGER:

Three things about that,

16

Your Honor.

17

doesn't apply here at all.

18

parties get together beforehand and agree to file a

19

joint -- a joint submission to the board, so that they

20

really have talked about what is in dispute and what

21

isn't.

22

submissions in this case were made.

23

First of all, that instruction sheet
It applies only when the

It wasn't even promulgated until after the

And it's not clear how the board is going to

24

understand that language.

It doesn't say that the

25

parties can omit evidence of conferencing.
18
Alderson Reporting Company

It says they

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can omit, if they don't dispute it, letters requesting a

2

conference.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

It must be what they think

4

of as an interpretation of the rule and the statute that

5

they already had promulgated.

6

say, the rule says you have to include all known

7

relevant argumentative facts.

8

we mean it, we mean the facts that people are having an

9

argument about.

10

The rule and the statutes

So if the circular says

And then the statute says, a full statement

11

of the facts bearing upon the dispute.

12

and then this document say we mean a full statement of

13

facts that somebody might think have something to do

14

with an argument that people are having.

15

And the circular

And, so, only after this case did the board

16

say, oh, no, you have to include some disputes that

17

nobody is disputing, some facts that nobody has ever

18

disputed or seems to.

Now, what's -- what's the response to that?

20

MR. BALLENGER:

Again, Your Honor, there is

21

nothing unique or new about what the board did here.

22

The board has done this before.

23

Now, as to the circular, it remains -

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

they did?

I'm right in `stating what

Is my statement of what they did, which was

meant to be as pejorative as I could possibly make it -

2

(Laughter.)

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and you are going to

4

say, that's right, that's the correct statement of what

5

happened?

6

MR. BALLENGER:

No, I'm -- I'm disagreeing

7

with the -- the characterization that this is the board

8

saying, we're going to make up a new rule that we've

9

never applied before.

That's not what happened here.

10

The board said that the weight of arbitral precedence

11

supports the carrier's position.

12

Now, as to the -- the instruction sheet, it

13

remains to be seen how the board is going to interpret

14

that.

15

interpret it in a manner that was wholly arbitrary and

16

without reason and would violate the Steelworkers

17

Then if -- then a person

following this is obliged not to pay heed to this advice

because if you don't put in every document, if you don't

put in enough evidence of conferencing, you are going to

10

be out and never have your grievance heard.

11

MR. BALLENGER:

Your Honor, in an

12

appropriate case, if a board panel interpreted that

13

language in -- in a manner that would be inconsistent

14

with something that that panel then did, then there

15

might be an inherent conflict that -

16
17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

that that provision was not applicable here anyway?

MR. BALLENGER:

22

It's not applicable at all,

Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does the other side contest

that?
MR. BALLENGER:

Not that I am aware of.

23

It -- it only applies in the case of joint submissions,

24

and it was not promulgated until after the submissions

25

here were filed.

So no one could legitimately rely on
21

that instruction sheet.

2

And in any event -

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They are not relying on

4

it as applicable in this case.

5

as the board's indication that it's sound to tell the

6

parties, don't dump on us unnecessary paper.

7

MR. BALLENGER:

They are relying on it

Well, the board obviously

8

does not consider evidence of conferencing unnecessary,

9

Your Honor.

It has held for a very long time, going

10

back, I think, 40 years to Award 18679 at least, that

11

evidence of conferencing is essential to the board's

12

consideration of any dispute under the terms of the

13

statute.

14
15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Some panels of the board.

Other panels think this is an eminently curable defect.

16

MR. BALLENGER:

That's right, Your Honor.

17

But an arbitral decision does not violate the

18

Steelworkers standard of review simply because other

19

arbitrators disagree.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's a decision on the

21

merits.

23

differently by different panels.

25

Here we are talking about a threshold barrier

MR. BALLENGER:

And that is being decided

Your Honor, this Court has

made clear that issues of procedural arbitrability,

Alderson Reporting Company

threshold conditions to arbitration, are governed by the

2

same standard as merits issues in arbitration.

Misco case, for instance, there was a question of

4

evidence, and the arbitrator refused to consider certain

5

kinds of evidence.

7

In the

And this Court said questions of

In John Wiley v. Livingston, which is in

8

many ways very similar to this case, it involved a

9

procedural precondition to arbitration that the parties

10

have to meet in conference prior to beginning the

11

arbitration.

12

whether that precondition of conferencing should be

13

waived on the grounds that on the facts of that case it

14

would be futile.

15

get a court to intervene on that question, because it

16

could have precluded the arbitration entirely.

17

Court said that procedural questions arising out of the

18

arbitration and bearing on its disposition are for the

19

arbitrator, not for a court.

MR. BALLENGER:

Because in that case the

justice, as this Court said in the Enterprise Wheel and

Good afternoon, Mr. Chief

The first and most important thing that the

violation is that without any interpretation of the

14

their contract claims.

15

engineers and the carriers:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Just to be clear,

2

you say it's established practice that the railroads

3

normally file their objection at a -- you know, at a

4

particular point, and you think the board is without

5

power to say:

6

You, railroad, did not follow it, and so we're not going

7

to consider your objections.

8
9
10

Look.

This is the established practice.

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

No, no, Your Honor.

Our -

our position is CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

11

that they -- the board can't do that?

12

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

No.

You mean

We don't think that the

13

board can or should do that.

14

if there is -- the rule that I just read from, 301.5,

15

says that you raise relevant argumentative facts.

16

What we do think is that,

Union Pacific, when the parties exchanged

17

the submissions, did not say that there wasn't any

18

conferencing.

19

the reply brief was, well, we didn't know you had not

20

conferenced until we saw that you didn't have any

21

evidence of it.

22

our view, disingenuous.

23

Now, their -- their comeback to that in

I mean, that's just not -- slightly, in

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could they -- could they

24

adopt a rule that says that, if the -- if the parties go

25

through -- do everything that is necessary prior to the
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

time of the adjudication, they can't pop up at the very

2

last minute and send in a letter saying:

3

way, there was no conferencing; could they adopt a rule

4

like that because it's just a big waste of everybody's

5

time to leave it to -- to the last minute?

6

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

Oh.

By the

Your Honor, in our view, the

7

panel couldn't, but the adjustment board could, and the

8

adjustment board comes out with these little procedures,

9

like the one read here that -- which they say is not

10

relevant, that says -- you know, let's have these joint

11

submissions, let's keep evidence of conferencing out.

12

They are trying to -- these submissions that

13

come in for these arbitration cases are not to be

14

believed.

15

there is a constant effort on the part of everybody in

16

the process to pare down the submissions to what is

17

actually in dispute.

18

I mean, they are like six feet high.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So

I thought, under the

19

Steelworkers trilogy, the arbitrators has broad

20

deference to adopt these sorts of modes of procedure.

21

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

That we would review

only for whatever it is.

24
25

But, Your Honor -

MR. GEOGHEGAN:
trilogy.

This is not the Steelworkers

The Steelworkers trilogy is about private
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arbitrators determining private contracts and

2

determining the procedures under private contracts.

3

They are -- they are applying the procedural rules of

4

the contract.

5

There is nothing like that here.

We are here because a government-funded

6

panel, under a mandatory procedure, funded by the

7

government, was applying the Code of Federal

8

Regulations, not rules that the parties agreed to

9

themselves, so the deference that is given to -- by this

10

Court to a private arbitrator applying private

11

procedural rules that the parties agree to, and so on

12

and so forth, isn't present here because this is

13

governmental action.

14

It is a governmental agency.

Now, we can -- the AFL-CIO gets into an

15

argument about whether it's a state action.

16

bottom line is that these are arbitrators paid for by

17

the government.

18

eligible pool is selected by the government.

19

But the

The arbitrators are selected -- or the

They are applying the Code of Federal

20

Regulations to keep us from getting to any procedural

21

rule or any substantive rule under a private collective

22

bargaining agreement.

23

governmental action blocking the people from getting

24

their -- resolution of their private contractual claims.

25

That's why -

That looks a lot like

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the review -- the

2

review of government arbitrators arbitrating provisions

3

pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, the

4

standard of review of that is different than private

5

arbitrators under the Steelworkers trilogy?

6

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

It should be, and, in the

7

hornbook sense, it is, the reality of it is, and that's

8

true here.

9

it's a different standard than -- than Steelworkers or

10

We can say it's de novo review.

We can say

John Wiley, and this is not a John Wiley case.

11

But the reality is you aren't going to get a

12

court's attention, unless they did something that is

13

actionable under the Steelworker trilogy, too.

14

Steelworker trilogy has the Enterprise Wheel case, which

15

says, if the arbitrator starts making up rules

16

willy-nilly, dispensing "his own brand of industrial

17

justice," not drawing their essence from the collective

18

bargaining agreement or, in this case, the CFRs.

I mean, if you say:

But there is no such rule,

a -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm saying that, if

3

the board adopts a procedure exactly like that, you may

4

challenge it as-- as violating due process because you

5

didn't have notice, any number of things, but you can't

6

say that the board is imposing its own brand of

7

industrial justice.

8
9

That sort of seems, to me, goes to the
merits in the standards of arbitration, rather than

10

procedures like this, unless it's a procedure like was

11

hypothesized earlier, that only applies to one side and

12

not the other.

13

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

Your Honor, all I can say,

14

in answer to that, is that there are governmental rules

15

that have very specific procedures that are in place.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought your position

17

was -- at least I thought I heard you say earlier, that

18

these individual panels do not have rulemaking authority

19

for the board.

20

"National Railway Adjustment Board, Uniform Rules of

21

Procedure, Revised June 23rd."

22

the board, the one that you said that is -

23
24
25

I'm looking at something that says,

MR. GEOGHEGAN:
the street.

That's put out by the -

The adjustment board down

34 members.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I thought that

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

your -- because there's nothing in this statute, nothing

2

in any regulation, that gives an individual panel the

3

right to proscribe rules of procedure that all parties

4

to these disputes are obliged to follow.

5

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

That's correct, Your Honor.
That -- that authority is

vested only in the board, not in the panels.

8

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

Arguably, in the board.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't know how that could

10

possibly be true.

I can't imagine being an arbitrator

11

and not being able to say:

12

have all of the -- all of the papers relevant to this

14

particular point that we are going to discuss in by two

Can't do that?

Your Honor, that didn't

If I may explain, there is -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

25

Well The whole question that this

was -- that these documents were 43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, at least back off

2

from your statement that an arbitrator cannot set rules

3

of procedure.

4

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

I -- well, Your Honor, an

5

arbitrator can set rules of procedure within the

6

parameters of what is allowed by the act.

7
8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, all right.

That's a

little different.

9

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

But the act itself, and the

10

CFRs, are very clear that there is no requirement that

11

this evidence has to be submitted in the original

12

submission.

13

And once the JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you're making sense.

14

It says that, or it just doesn't address the question of

15

whether they have to be included in the original

16

submission?

17

says -- or I missed it, there is no provision that says

18

the conferencing materials do not have to be included in

19

the original submission?

20

I mean, I assume there is no provision that

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

There is no CFR that says

21

that the conferencing materials have to be in the

22

original submission or the case is dismissed.

23

nothing like -

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Presumably, there is

none that says they don't have to be.
44
Alderson Reporting Company

There is

In other words, I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

take it that this is an issue that is simply not

2

addressed by the CFR rules?

3

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

Well, in any specific way.

4

I understand Your Honor's point, but the fact of it is

5

that the record that you attach to the original

6

submission is only about the relevant argumentative

7

facts that are in dispute.

8

that -- that there isn't other evidence in the record

9

down below.

10

That doesn't mean that

What happened here, and this is different

11

from all the other cases, is that the union came in and

12

said:

13

that relates even to correspondence between the parties.

Oh, we've got evidence.

14

And we've got evidence

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you are just

15

disputing the validity or applicability of the rule.

16

You don't want to comply with the rule.

17

any different than saying:

18

arbitration that is going to go forward.

19

to meet at 10:00 Monday morning.

20

meeting.

21

well, there's no rule that says we have to be there at

22

10:00 Monday morning; that's just the arbitrator saying

23

that to -- to move the procedure along, so you can't

24

penalize us in any way for not showing up at 10:00

25

Monday morning.

I mean, is it

Look, okay, we've got this
We are going

It is the first

One side doesn't show up and then they say,

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

I think that an arbitrator

2

could penalize a party for not showing up.

3

the fact of this is that there is no authority in the

4

arbitrator to bar evidence of conferencing simply

5

because it wasn't in the original citation.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the -

I take it your point is

7

that there is a rule?

It's called 29 CFR 301.7(b).

8

that rule happened to say, you must show up by 11, that

9

would be a fair inference you don't have to show up by

10

10.

11

argumentative facts, so there is a fair inference you

12

don't have to submit the facts that are not

13

argumentative.

14

If

And that rule says you have to submit the

I take it that that -- suppose that you are

15

wrong -- suppose that you are wrong on that.

I think

16

maybe you are right, but suppose you are wrong.

17

they have loads of authority to make rules.

18

have a strong argument they don't, but suppose they did.

19

In your research -- and the same question is

Suppose

Again, you

20

really addressed to your fellow counsel.

In your

21

research on this, did you find any instance in which

22

either a court or an agency does change a rule, and

23

says:

24

caption, whereas previously it was stamped by the clerk.

25

Okay?

Now you have to say the date right underneath the

They changed the rule.

And they have every good

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reason in the world for doing it.

2

it to the case in front of them, which didn't know about

3

it, and then they won't let them change it.

4

And then they apply

Now, is there any case at all which said

5

that that was lawful?

6

say you cannot apply rules retroactively where it is

7

unfair to do it, even if you had have all the power in

8

the world to make the rules.

9

that.

10
11

I can think of lots of cases that

I have lots of cases like

What I wondered is if anybody found a case along

the lines that I just said.
MR. GEOGHEGAN:

We did not, Your Honor, and

12

the Wells case in particular, where there was no

13

question that the rule was valid, was a case where the

14

Fourth Circuit found a violation of due process because

15

the parties did not have reasonable notice, or the

16

carrier in that case did not have reasonable notice that

17

it was the postage date that was the date for the brief,

18

instead of the postmark.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you recall the

20

situation -- do you recall the situation Justice Breyer

21

described, and we can debate about it, whether it's

22

rulemaking by adjudication, which does take place, you

23

would say that in the situation you described, it

24

violated due process, right?

25

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

I would say that it is also
47

Alderson Reporting Company

in excess of the arbitrator's power under the act

because this arbitrator does not have rulemaking power.

Your Honor, you were asking

I mean, there are certain rulings that
I don't want to get hung up on -- on

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let's not get -- can I ask

14

about argumentative facts?

I frankly have never heard

15

of a phrase like argumentative facts.

16

it means only those facts that are in dispute.

17

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You seem to think

Yes.
Well, that would be a

19

pretty incomprehensible statement of the -- of the

20

event, if you write in your brief statement of facts and

21

you only write down the facts that are disputed and none

22

of the facts that are agreed to.

23

It couldn't possibly mean that.

I would

24

think that argumentative facts simply means facts

25

relevant to the argument, and one of the facts relevant
48
Alderson Reporting Company

to the argument is whether you did the necessary

2

consultation.

3

argumentative facts to mean only those facts that are in

4

dispute.

5

be?

6

But I don't know how you could interpret

What kind of a statement of facts would that

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

Well, Your Honor, you may be

7

correct in your view of it, but the parties have

8

interpreted this as being the facts that are in dispute.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

Well And remember, this is a

11

procedure that is not about conferencing or proving

12

conferencing, it is a procedure that -- about what

13

happened at the trial.

14

So when you are looking at that 301.5, you

15

are looking at a rule that is designed to make clear to

16

the arbitrator and the panel what it is that is being

17

disputed, after the investigative hearing where the

18

carrier superintendent signs off and says, you know, we

19

are going to discharge this guy because he ran the red

2

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, that's really not my

4

-- but you do concede, do you, that there are half a

5

dozen cases out there which were dismissed because there

6

was the failure of the record to show that there was

7

conferencing below?

8
9

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

We do admit that, but we say

that in our particular case, the record would certainly

10

include or we would be allowed to supplement with the

11

evidence from the -

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So your -- your objection

13

is -- is two-fold.

14

that the record show it affirmatively is not supported.

15

And secondly, there -- you should have had an

16

independent right to -- to make an offer of proof that

17

would have cured the defect.

That's correct and we don't

know of any case that JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You did -- you did make

an offer of proof as to -

22

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

Yes.

3

wish I had made that point earlier.

they -- originally we passionately objected to this, and

5

the -- and the neutral members said, oh, fine, you know,

6

we will -- we will reconvene for -- we will reschedule

7

this in three months, come back.

8
9

I mean, they -

So everybody came back with the evidence.
Union Pacific came back with what -- I mean, they found

10

out that, in fact, they have -- probably two of these

11

cases had been conferenced, we came back with our

12

letters, we said here it is, and -- and the neutral

13

member said, oh, no, you don't understand, I didn't

14

really want you to do this.

15

So, you know, why -- why -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think you

16

could submit that offer of proof at any time during the

MR. GEOGHEGAN:

We think of it as relevant,

had not been raised at the time that these cases were

So your answer to my

earlier question is that you can submit that offer of
proof at any time, and it has to be considered?
MR. GEOGHEGAN:

Well, any time that the

12

objection is raised.

13

that prejudices the other party, the answer is yes.

There is no rule that prohibits that.

18

dismissed without any hearing and what the Seventh

19

Circuit called blind-siding and what the union

20

dissidents said was gamesmanship is the kind of thing

21

that should be of concern of this Court, because it

22

really undermines the integrity of the arbitration

23

process, and it's very important to keep that.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.

Oh, sure.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. SCOTT BALLENGER

23

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

24

MR. BALLENGER:

Four quick points.

25

Justice Stevens, the awards that you are
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

looking for are at pages 40 and 45 of the joint

2

appendix, and also we would suggest that you look at

3

first division award 23883, which is easy to locate.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Were any of those

5

decisions that were boardwise or did they apply to one

6

panel?

All these decisions are

The Respondent suggests that the Steelworker

11

trilogy standard that this Court has articulated for

12

labor arbitration generally doesn't apply under the RLA.

13

There is no authority for that, that many I am aware of.

14

The lower courts have understood it the same way, and

15

there is every reason to think that's correct.

16

was quite clear in the legislative history to the '66

17

amendment that it anticipated that the standard of

18

review under this statute would be the same as that

19

applied in ordinary private labor arbitration.

20

course, the Sheehan case rejects the idea that there is

21

some kind of special judicial review for question of law

22

under the RLA.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Congress

But there is a

24

difference between governmentally ordered arbitrations

25

and private contracts.

In private contracts the parties
56

Alderson Reporting Company

negotiate the rules and they set them forth, and the

2

arbitrators then follow -

3

MR. BALLENGER:

The difference, Your Honor,

4

I believe, is that in the ordinary arbitral context when

5

you have a procedural question, the question is what the

6

parties would have wanted.

7

Congress would have wanted, but there is no -- about the

8

correct standards of review.

9

think that Congress wanted anything other than what the

Here the question is what

But there is no reason to

10

parties ordinarily want under this case law, which is

11

for procedural questions to be resolved by the

12

arbitrator.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is it your position that

if you go through the first phase and as everybody is
