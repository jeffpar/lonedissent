ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LAMKEN:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This case concerns a bedrock principle of

11
12

Federal -- Federal energy law, the Mobile-Sierra

13

doctrine.

14

below is whether Mobile-Sierra's public interest

15

standard ceases to apply whenever a contract rate is

16

challenged by a noncontracting party.

17
18
19

The question presented and the issue decided

FERC and we agree that the answer is no.
Mobile-Sierra's presumption of -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Does it matter who is

20

the challenger?

21

the other parties to this action?

22

Are you in a different position than

You're a third party who is being bound to a

23

particular rate.

The others do have a different

24

interest, or they're in a different position with

25

respect to their challenges, correct?

MR. LAMKEN:

Your Honor, I represent -- we

2

represent -- I represent NRG, which entered into the

3

settlement agreement and is -- would like to be bound by

4

the results of the auction contract.

5

happy with the agreements we enter into, and a concern

6

that we have is that nonparties can come in and

7

challenge the contracts under a lower standard.

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So aren't you in a

different position than those other challengers?

10
11

And so we are

MR. LAMKEN:

We certainly are in a different

position, but they -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

So why doesn't that

13

difference do what the D.C. Circuit said?

MR. LAMKEN:

Mr. Lamken, you're not a

That's exactly right.
Yes.

I think --

We are not a challenger.

We

are -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- the question relates

to the other side --

22

MR. LAMKEN:

Right.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

that, but that's what I'm trying to get to.

-- not to his side -No.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

I do understand
The D.C.

Official

1

Circuit Court's reasoning was very simple:

2

contracting party; you're bound to it.

3

others who didn't agree to this term be bound by

4

Mobile-Sierra?

5

You're a

Why should the

That's the essence of their holding.

MR. LAMKEN:

Right.

Nobody is arguing that

6

a noncontracting party is bound to terms that it didn't

7

agree to in a contract.

8
9

The question is that, when a noncontracting
party comes in to challenge the terms that two

10

consenting, willing buyer and a seller have agreed

11

to, what is the standard that should apply for that

12

outsider to come in and challenge the rate the two

13

people have agreed to?
And Mobile-Sierra and Morgan Stanley all

14
15

provide the answer, and that is the public interest

16

standard.

17

doctrine, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must

18

presume the contract rate meets the just and reasonable

19

requirement provided by law.

The standard is that, under the Mobile-Sierra

20

Unless --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22
23

So then does that bind

all types of third parties?
MR. LAMKEN:

It certainly applies to the

24

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and it would be a

25

rather odd rule that the agency which is charged with

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress with administering the statute, has the

2

greatest expertise, is bound by a more demanding

3

standard, but an entity, an outsider with no such

4

statutory mandate and no such expertise is subject to a

5

lower standard when it comes in and asks for a contract

6

rate to be overturned or abrogated.

7

In fact, the court of appeals’ ruling can't

8

be reconciled with Mobile-Sierra's foundation and the

9

need for contractual certainty.

The whole point is to

10

provide certainty of contract so that companies can

11

invest hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure

12

projects without worrying that their contracts will be

13

abrogated lightly after the fact.

14

entering into such contracts and make those investments

15

if any noncontracting party -- if the Mobile-Sierra

16

doctrine applied only to contracting parties, the two

17

people who signed the contract.

But few could risk

But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

It's a bit much to

19

say that the importance is to preserve the stability of

20

two parties' contract, and, therefore, a third party who

21

didn't sign the contract is bound to the two parties'

22

contract.
MR. LAMKEN:

23
24

actually paying the rate.

25

the rate.

Well, the nonparty isn't
The two parties are paying

The nonparty is saying:

Alderson Reporting Company

I'm adversely

1

affected by that rate indirectly.

2

regularly adversely affected by contracts we didn't

3

enter into.

4

theatergoers affected by the amount the theater pays for

5

the movies and the popcorn and things like that.

6

the question is what's the standard for that outsider to

7

abrogate a rate the two, a willing buyer and a willing

8

seller, have entered into?

9

And we're all

The example we give in our brief is the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But

Well, so why don't

10

you -- why isn't it restricted to some type of direct,

11

parties directly affected, as well as -- I mean, you

12

complain about the hordes of people who will be able to

13

challenge these.

14

challenge it.

Well, it assumes that anybody can

MR. LAMKEN:

15

Well, it certainly applies to

16

the parties most directly affected, which are the

17

parties that actually entered into the contract and are

18

paying the rates.

19

Regulatory Commission, which is the expert regulator,

20

and it doesn't make much sense to have another --

21

another exemption for some category of not directly

22

bound but sufficiently -- sufficiently affected parties.

23

It would --

24
25

So it applies to the Federal Energy

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is there any other area of

the law in which the parties to a contract can, in

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

effect, dictate the substantive standard of

2

administrative review for challenges raised by

3

nonparties?

4

MR. LAMKEN:

I think the answer is I don't

5

know if there is other areas where there's a

6

possibility of a Memphis clause, if that's what you're

7

referring to, where the parties can actually –- when

8

they enter into a contract, they can actually lower the

9

standard.

But the general rule is that when a party

10

comes in and tries to abrogate a contract, they have no

11

greater rights to challenge the contract than the

12

parties who entered it themselves.

13

third-party beneficiary, it's the same right.

14

they're a nonparty, at least so far as we can tell, they

15

have no right to challenge the validity of the contract,

16

at least as a matter of contract law.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If they are a
And if

Am I correct -- and maybe

18

this is more proper for the government than for you, or

19

for all the parties.

20

propriety, the lawfulness, of the FERC determination to

21

convene the settlement process?

22

that this was an improper, an unlawful process?

I take it no one questions the

MR. LAMKEN:

23

No.

There's no argument

There is certainly no such

24

claim before this Court, and I'm not aware of any such

25

one.

But what came out of the process were agreements

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with respect to rates, and the settled rule is that such

2

agreements cannot be abrogated unless the public

3

interest would be severely harmed. And --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can I -Of course, there is.

6

What's -- what’s really lurking behind this case is

7

whether this is a contract rate, and there FERC

8

disagrees with you, I take it.

9

that the rate that emerges from a contract between two

You were talking about

10

people –- nobody else is party to it, but you say the

11

rate stands; FERC cannot abrogate the rate; nobody can

12

ask FERC to abrogate that bilateral contract rate.

13

here we're not talking about a bilateral contract, where

14

how many people were involved in the settlement?

15

over a hundred.

16

MR. LAMKEN:

Scores, yes.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But

Well

And --

So that's quite a

18

different picture than the bilateral contracts that were

19

at issue in Sierra and Mobile.

20

MR. LAMKEN:

Certainly FERC agrees with us

21

that at least some of the rates before this Court are

22

contract rates.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did the lower court reach

that question?
MR. LAMKEN:

No, the lower court didn't

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

address the question.

2
3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did we grant cert on that

question?
MR. LAMKEN:

You did not, and this Court

5

regularly declines to address matters that were merely

6

assumed or presumed by the court below and instead

7

answers the question that was actually answered by the

8

court below, which in this case is an important and

9

recurring question.

Based on the decision below, FERC

10

has actually gone back and rewritten more than 50

11

contracts to create an exemption for noncontracting

12

parties, including contracts that are clearly bilateral

13

contracts, Your Honor.

14
15
16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry?

What do

you mean, an exemption for noncontracting parties?
MR. LAMKEN:

Simply to say that the

17

Mobile-Sierra doctrine can't apply when the challenge is

18

brought by a noncontracting party, but rather what FERC

19

wrote into the contracts effectively was the highest

20

standard permitted by law will be applied to them.

21

nobody sitting at these tables can tell this Court what

22

that standard would be, which is precisely why this is

23

an important issue.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

You don't agree that

FERC has the authority to exempt noncontracting parties

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

from the binding effect of the contract rates, do you?

2

MR. LAMKEN:

No, we don't, which is

3

precisely one of the -- we don't believe that the court

4

had authority to announce that rule.

5

believe the court erred in announcing that rule.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. LAMKEN:

8

Yes.

We actually
It --

It isn't in the case.
Whether or not these are

contracted --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is a case in which, as

10

I think most cases where they approve contracts, what

11

they're finding is that the contract rate in this

12

circumstance, or here the settlement rate in this

13

circumstance, is a just and reasonable rate, because.

14

All right?

15

you going to say he's wrong, the lower court's wrong,

16

because they got the whole thing mixed up.

17

could we say that?

So what are we supposed to do?

MR. LAMKEN:

18

Yes.

I mean, are

I mean –-

The lower court got

19

everything wrong, it got the whole thing mixed up; send

20

it back.

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. LAMKEN:

23

straightforward.
JUSTICE BREYER:

24
25

Very simple and very

of your mouth.
(Laughter.)

4

MR. LAMKEN:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

Thank you, Justice Breyer.
But you would -- would you

agree with my assumptions there?

7

MR. LAMKEN:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

He took the words right out

Yes.
That what this case is

about -- and it's a fortiori from the ordinary contract

10

case -- is that sometimes an agency, because of

11

particular economic circumstances, concludes that a

12

particular rate-setting system is a just and reasonable

13

system, and once that's in place, then as part of that

14

system is the rule you can only challenge it when it

15

violates the public interest, for example.

16

Now, you can go and attack the whole

17

business on the ground the whole business is an abuse of

18

discretion or it departs from the statute.

19

whole business is okay, that's the end of it.

20

MR. LAMKEN:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22
23
24
25

Right.

But if the

I --

Now, have I just said the

correct law in your view or not?
MR. LAMKEN:

We would not -- that, Justice

Breyer, in fact would be our back-up position.

5

correct or not?

6

MR. LAMKEN:

I'm interested in, is it

Yes, we would agree with it,

7

that that is a correct statement of law.

But our

8

primary position and the primary error in the court

9

below was it said even when you have a contract rate,

10

nonparty -- there is an exemption based on the identity

11

of the challenging party.

reconciled with –-

13

And that simply cannot be

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you just said to

14

Justice Scalia that the court below didn't find that

15

this was a contract rate.
MR. LAMKEN:

16
17

assumed it.

It merely

And this Court -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18
19

That's right.

It assumed it, so you're

asking us to assume the same thing and announce --

20

MR. LAMKEN:

Well --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- an advisory opinion

22

that if these are contract rates, they're bound by

23

Mobile-Sierra; and if they're not, what are we supposed

24

to do?

25

MR. LAMKEN:

Well, the answer is that this

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court regularly, regularly, addresses the question

2

presented and the issue answered below without delving

3

into underlying assumptions.

4
5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

advisory opinions if you want.

6

MR. LAMKEN:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

You could call them all

That's right.
Whenever there is another

issue in the case --

9

MR. LAMKEN:

10

Right, and one example --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- for which we remand, you

11

could say, oh, we're just giving an advisory opinion on

12

the issue that --

13

MR. LAMKEN:

That's precisely right.

A good

14

example would be Jama v. Immigration and Customs

15

Enforcement, where the question was whether the Attorney

16

General could deport an alien to a foreign country

17

without making sure the country would accept him.

18

the Court said:

19

person is an alien; we won't address whether Somalia is

20

a country; we're not going to even address whether this

21

person is removable -- that's all for the court on

22

remand; we're only going to address whether or not there

23

has to be a prior determination that the country will

24

accept him.

25

And

We're not going to address whether the

The same rule would apply -JUSTICE STEVENS:

Could you give me an

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

example of a -- of a challenge to a rate that's set

2

under this whole program that would succeed under the

3

just and reasonable standard and fail under the public

4

interest standard, or vice versa?

5

MR. LAMKEN:

Are you asking me can I

6

conceive of such a rate that would fail and succeed

7

under one?

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

MR. LAMKEN:

Yes.

I think that -- one of the –

10

one of the

interesting things about the just and

11

reasonable standard, the ordinary just and reasonable

12

standard, is you can actually look at the interests of

13

the contracting parties to a degree that you cannot

14

under the public interest standard.

15

public interest standard is it has to adversely affect

16

the interests of the public.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

6

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FERC,

7

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The court of appeals erred in holding that

11

the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard is

12

inapplicable when contract rates are challenged by a

13

noncontracting third party.

14

sufficient basis for reversing the judgment below, and

15

although there are other issues in the case, those

16

issues were not addressed by the court of appeals, and

17

this Court should remand and allow them to be resolved

18

by the court of appeals rather than addressing them

19

itself in the first instance.

That error provides a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

Were the -- are the

21

Respondents correct and was the court of appeals correct

22

in calling this a presumption?

This Court in Morgan Stanley

described -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In -- in calling the rate

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that was agreed upon a presumption of a reasonable rate?

2

MR. MILLER:

Well, the -- the Court in

3

Morgan Stanley held that Mobile-Sierra rests in part on

4

the idea that when wholesale businesses negotiate a

5

contract for the sale of power, that that can be

6

presumed to be just and reasonable.

7
8
9
10
11
12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you don't quarrel with

MR. MILLER:

We quarrel --

that word -No.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- or would you quarrel

with that characterization?
MR. MILLER:

That's the way that this

13

Court has described the standard.

14

this case the Commission looked at the mechanism

15

created, the forward capacity auction, and it looked at

16

the transition rates, and it didn't simply presume them

17

to be just and reasonable.

18

examination of them -- determined that the rates set out

19

in the settlement and the rates that would be

20

established under the mechanism created by the

21

settlement would be just and reasonable.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

Now, of course, in

It -- based on its

Just and reasonable, or

would comply with the public interest standard?

24

MR. MILLER:

The --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, what's the use of

17
Alderson Reporting Company

1

having Mobile-Sierra if -- if they're going to reexamine

2

the thing under the usual standard anyway?
MR. MILLER:

3

Well, the settlement -- no one

4

is suggesting that the settlement agreement itself is a

5

Mobile-Sierra contract.

6

of a disputed proceeding before the Commission.

7

sort of analogous to a consent decree.

8

had to approve that before it became effective.

9

own terms, the settlement agreement wouldn't become

10

effective as binding between the parties unless the

11

Commission approved it.

Your -- your opening

13

statement about what this Court should do is a change

14

from your statement of what we should do in your briefs.
In your -- you just said the Court should

remand for further considerations other issues.

brief, you say the judgment of the court of appeals

should be reversed insofar as it granted the petitions

19

for review.

20

should do.

21

In your

You've changed your position on what we

MR. MILLER:

Well, we -- we do think that

22

you should reverse the holding of the court of appeals.

23

To the extent that you think that there are other issues

24

that are presented other than the question presented as

25

stated by the petition.

18
Alderson Reporting Company

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's a change.

2

Before you didn't think there were other issues that

3

affected the determination or might.

4

grant -- reverse the determination insofar as it granted

5

the petitions for review.

6
7

If we say that the petitions for review
should have been denied, then we don't send it back.

8
9
10

You said we should

MR. MILLER:
Right.

Yes.

Right.

Should have been granted.

That's right.

It -- I mean, our view is that the

11

appropriate disposition is a remand to the court of

12

appeals to allow it to decide whether these other issues

13

are properly before it, and the answer to that may be –-

14

be no, but the court of appeals should have an

15

opportunity to consider that in the first instance.

16

The reason that, in our view, the court of

17

question before us.

MR. MILLER:

Well, you have --

MR. MILLER:

What -- what the Court said in

Sierra is that mere unfairness, one of the -- the fact

18

that one of the contracting parties got a bad bargain is

19

not a reason to set aside the contract, except for the

20

Court did reserve the extraordinary circumstance where

21

it's going to put the supplier out of business, which

22

would adversely affect the public interest if they can

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

May I -So it goes back to my

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

original question with your adversary, which is:

2

there a difference among the objectors here, between

3

those who are objecting to the terms between the two

4

contracting parties as outsiders, as members of the

5

public, and those who are objecting because this

settlement agreement does something different?

7

them personally to a buying price, and so why shouldn't

8

there be a different approach to those individuals?

9

MR. MILLER:

Is

It binds

I think there are two responses

10

to that, Your Honor.

The first is that the reasoning of

11

the court of appeals draws no distinction between those

12

two --

13

14

MR. MILLER:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16
17

question is:

I agree.

Okay.
And so the

Should there be a distinction?
MR. MILLER:

Yes.

And I think certainly the

18

Commission appreciates the idea that there's something

19

wrong about -- or there's something unfair about A and B

20

getting together and deciding on the rate that C is

21

going to pay.

22

about that situation, the answer to that is that when A

23

and B set the rate that C has to pay, C is not paying a

24

contract rate in the Mobile-Sierra sense, because C is

25

not -- C is paying a rate it has not agreed to.

And to the extent that you're concerned

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that's what the

2

Third Circuit -- I'm sorry, that's what the court below

3

didn't --

4

MR. MILLER:

The court did not use that mode

5

of analysis.

6

about contract rates and their being challenged by

7

nonparties to the contract, and the court thought that

8

in that context the Mobile-Sierra public interest

9

standard doesn't apply, and that --

10

The court below said that we were talking

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're saying, in effect,

11

that Mobile-Sierra does not apply to an agreement

12

between A and B that not only sets the rate between the

13

two, but also fixes the rate that one of them will

14

charge to C?

15
16
17

The last feature is not a Mobile-Sierra -is not eligible for Mobile-Sierra treatment.
MR. MILLER:

That's right, because C's rate

18

in that scenario is not a rate that it has agreed to.

19

It's being set unilaterally by people other than it, and

20

so it's in our view more appropriately characterized as

21

a tariff rate that is not subject to the --

22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

But that's -- but

that's not what the D.C. Circuit said.

24

MR. MILLER:

No, that is --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The D.C. Circuit said that

the entire -- there is no application of Mobile-Sierra

2

at all.
MR. MILLER:

3

That's right.

And the

4

D.C. Circuit made that quite clear, particularly on page

5

20a of the petition appendix in its opinion, where it

6

described the question before it, yes.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it is your view, is it

8

not, that the rates that result from the auction are not

9

contract rates within the meaning of Mobile-Sierra?

10

MR. MILLER:

That -- that is our view, that

11

that's -- it's not the basis for the court of appeals’

12

decision.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The court of appeals

14

never got to what FERC thinks is the heart of the case,

15

whether this is a contract rate, whether -- you say it

about the court of appeals' analysis is that this Court

initiate the FERC investigation.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I thought one large

4

difference -- I thought Justice Scalia suggested that

5

the rate negotiated by -- in that bilateral agreement,

6

that that rate would not be subject to just and

7

reasonable attack by anyone, that the public interest

8

standard attaches to that rate and FERC can't abrogate

9

it.

It's a rate that's set, it's binding on FERC, and

10

FERC presumably, because it has no authority to abrogate

11

it, could not entertain any complaint that would ask to

12

have it abrogated.

3

identity of the party that attacks it?

4

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Because, Your Honor, the

5

question also is what the standard should be if it's

6

presumptively reasonable; and it is taken as such,

7

because it is freely negotiated, because there is

consent to it.

not presumptively a commonsense notion when some

different party attacks it?

is presumptively reasonable.

with all due respect, that we are talking in alternate

4

universes here, the government and the Petitioners and

we; and the reason is, as the Court has quite aptly

identified, the court of appeals used a rationale that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now, there may be other matters, other

pointed out more than once, we have a question.

the very question that the D.C. Circuit decided.

should we go beyond that?

It is
Why

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Because addressing that

Yes, but we don't like to

decide these questions, you know, initially.

We -- we

10

like to have some lower court do the dirty work, and we

11

can correct them.

12

(Laughter.)

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It’s -- it's a lot easier

14

that way, and we're more likely to reach a correct

15

result, rather than -- than wading in with, you know,

16

-- from scratch.

17

That's our usual practice.

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

And the government's

18

position on certiorari was that there should be a remand

19

without reversal for reconsideration in light of Morgan

20

Stanley.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You're in a very

22

tough position because of the way this has progressed.

23

I think you can make a strong argument that you

24

shouldn't be bound by these contract rates if FERC

25

doesn't have a lot of discretion to let you go.

40
Alderson Reporting Company

If FERC

Official

has a lot of discretion to let you go, your argument

2

that you shouldn't be bound is a lot weaker.

3

way the case has been presented, we're pushing on only

4

one -- one side of that.

5

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

And the

And I recognize that fact,

6

Mr. Chief Justice, that the Court is presented with a

7

dilemma here because it's dealing with tariff rates when

8

the question presented talks about contract rates.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

So is the answer then

10

maybe where Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia were

11

going, that -- because where I’m coming from, why I have

12

been asking this, is I actually think the answer to the

13

question so far on the question presented is

14

"sometimes."

15

And it depends on a lot of things -- situations,

16

circumstances, arguments to commissions, what they held,

17

et cetera.

18

Sometimes you can't; sometimes you can.

So maybe that's the thing to do, you answer

19

the question, say "sometimes."

Sometimes they can use

20

one; sometimes it's the other.

Indeed, in this very

21

case, they've argued that it's -- that it's not even

22

within the mainstream of Mobile-Sierra.

23

that's so, maybe it's not.

24

on circumstances, time, et cetera.

25

argue all these things out that we've just been hearing.

And maybe

Send it back, say it depends

41

And then they can

2

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

3

"sometimes" is absolutely right from our standpoint.

And, Justice Breyer, the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but if we

ruled that --

6

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

There may be --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If we decided it on

8

that basis, we would be giving FERC a victory on the

9

question of its authority to depart from Mobile-Sierra,

10

even though that wasn't presented in this case.
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

11

No.

In our view, Mr. Chief

12

Justice, noncontracting parties under Mobile-Sierra

13

cannot be bound --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, I know --

-- by tariff rates.
-- but Justice

17

Breyer was hypothesizing that sometimes they can be, and

18

sometimes they can't be.

proposition.

20

And what I'm saying is that's a very

21

significant question.

22

it's not before us.

23

And you accepted his

FERC wants to argue it here, but

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

The “sometimes” -- if I

24

could complete the answer, Mr. Chief Justice, is that

25

the “sometimes” would include contract rates.

42
Alderson Reporting Company

In other

Official

words, where there are strictly contract rates –-

2

whereas, here, we have tariff rates -- FERC would not

3

have that discretion.

4

apply the public interest standard to tariff rates any

5

more than it could apply the ordinary just and

6

reasonable standard to contract rates which --

It cannot have discretion to

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Has anybody before --

8

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

-- Mobile-Sierra fits.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- even suggested that

10

Mobile-Sierra is a “sometimes” thing?

11

any of our opinions say that it's a “sometimes” thing,

12

except in one respect, and that is the doctrine does not

13

apply when -- when, downstream, the rates -- or even

14

between the parties, the rates would violate the public

15

interest?

16

That's a “sometimes.”

Do -- did

It won't apply then,

17

but have we ever suggested that, you know, today it

18

may; tomorrow it -- it won't?

19

what standards might determine the “sometimes” question?

Or have we ever suggested

20

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

22

you can -- you can have a “sometimes” doctrine which

23

will produce the stability in the industry that Mobile-

they can make on it, and once they enter into an

People had to be able to predict whether

That was the whole purpose.

And, now, you

7

want to us say, well, sometimes it will work, and

8

sometimes it won't.

9

we're going to leave it to the D.C. Circuit to invent

10

And we're not going to say when;

some “sometimes.”

11

That doesn't make any sense, does it?

12

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Again, I may have been

13

unclear, and I apologize if I was, in response to

14

Justice Breyer and the Chief Justice's question, but the

15

point is that the “sometimes” would not apply to the

16

situation that we have here, where there are rates of

17

general applicability and tariffs.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can I -- can I go –-

1

the circuit court's analysis that the Mobile-Sierra

2

doctrine applies to those contract rates and binds third

3

parties who are challenging that particular rate between

4

those two parties?

5

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Justice Sotomayor, we are

6

not challenging that a contract should bind those two

7

parties or those hundred-plus parties that agree to the

8

contract.

9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that -- you

can't because that's the doctrine.

Okay.

Under what circumstances could a third party

11
12

challenge that rate as not fair and reasonable, as

13

opposed to being contrary to the public interest?
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

14

Well, the public interest

15

standard, as articulated in Morgan Stanley, would

16

require showing an extraordinarily high burden of proof.

question.

There’s a rate set

circumstances could a third party come in and say -- on

10

to confuse the issue.

and whether that auction is a contract price subject to

12

the Mobile-Sierra doctrine at all.

13

issue.

14

Yes, that's the auction question

That's a different

I've given you the simple hypothetical.

15

Could all of those other respondents -- except NSTAR --

17

to me because, at the end, I'm going to pay more; I'm

18

going to do something -- it's going to affect me in some

19

indirect way.

20

Are you taking the position that there's

21

something else that FERC must do when those third

22

parties come into -- into that simple situation?

23

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Our position, Justice

24

Sotomayor -- and it's a hypothetical here because,

25

again -- and I apologize for belaboring the point, but

46
Alderson Reporting Company

1

what we have here are rates of general applicability.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

back to the facts, and I'm dealing with a

4

hypothetical.

5

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

You want to keep going

And the hypothetical, I

6

would say, is answerable that the just and reasonable

7

standard, as it was applied in Bridgeport Energy and

8

Milford Power and tens of other cases --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you are taking the

10

extreme -- you are accepting that -- what the lower

11

court said?

12

contract price, fair and reasonable being something

13

other than contrary to the public interest?

14

Under every circumstance, if it involves a

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Fair and reasonable is a

15

standard different from the public interest standard.

16

That's a matter of law.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So your adversary's

18

arguments that what you're really saying is you can

19

never have finality to a contract agreement between

20

parties because any third party can come in and raise --

21

stand in the shoes of the contracting parties and argue

22

the rate's not fair and reasonable?

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

-- can FERC challenge, too?

25

But FERC can’t -- can FERC
Because FERC's a -- sort of

a third party.

47
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Well, FERC is -- is bound

2

by the same law that applies to third parties, which is

3

--

4
5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

So -- so

Mobile-Sierra doesn't apply to FERC, even?

6

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

Mobile-Sierra applies --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Who does it apply to?

8

mean, it's just -- just the two parties?

9

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

I

Mobile-Sierra effectively

10

says those two parties are bound by the contract, and

11

FERC is bound by it -- that's Morgan Stanley –- no

12

matter when the issue is raised.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

14

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

And a noncontracting party,

15

if it is a rate that applies generally, can challenge

16

it.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can a noncontracting party

18

go to FERC and challenge it before FERC, whereupon FERC

19

is no longer bound by Mobile-Sierra?

20

suddenly unchained when a third party brings a

21

proceeding before FERC?

22

Or is FERC

It's a strange situation.

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

FERC is bound by the just

23

and reasonable standard.

That's what the law says.

24

This law is a public -- is a consumer protection statute

25

that says, upon complaint or upon FERC's own motion, it

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

may apply that just and reasonable standard.
Now, the public interest standard looks for

3

serious harm to the public.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no.

The public

5

interest standard is a just and reasonable standard.

6

What -- what it amounts to is saying, when -- when you

7

have a contract rate that's been negotiated between

8

sophisticated parties, that rate is presumptively just

9

and reasonable, and the only way you can show that it is

10

not just and reasonable is to show that the public

11

interest is harmed.

12

It's -- it's not something different from

13

the just and reasonable standard, or it would be

14

contrary to -- to the statute because the statute

15

requires that the rates be just and reasonable, right?

16

MR. BLUMENTHAL:

It -- it is part –- they

17

are one standard, as Morgan Stanley very clearly says,

18

and the question of what noncontracting parties can

19

challenge a statute depends on who the noncontracting

20

party is, the nature of the contract, what interest is

21

affected, and I would presume some of those factors

22

might affect FERC's judgment.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

So are you aware of any law

24

or any statement by any judge, ever, that exempts the --

25

the FERC from the basic requirement that its rules,

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

regulations, and everything else not be arbitrary,

2

capricious, abuse of discretion?
MR. BLUMENTHAL:

The answer to that question

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

6

(Laughter.)

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

3
4

is no.
Okay.

Thank you.

And so, as long as that's

8

so, I guess you could mount a challenge on the ground

9

that to apply the contract regime system to circumstance

10

X, Y, and Z, without permitting your challenge that you

11

want, is, in fact, a violation of the APA, at the least.

12

Okay?

13

Now, that's why I say "sometimes."

Could

14

you imagine such a situation, which I think is what

15

Justice Sotomayor was getting at, or do you want it all

16

the time?

17

you're not getting sympathy from me.

18

there could be such a time, maybe.

All right?

20

So -- so where are we?

12

5

It does not show they were an

And I think that is actually part of the nub

6

of what was bothering the D.C. Circuit.

The D.C.

7

Circuit may have been bothered that there might be

8

actual purchasers here, people who directly themselves

9

purchase under the rate who haven't agreed to it.

But

10

that concern is wholly subsumed within the notion of

11

whether or not the rate that entity is paying is a

12

contract rate.

13

or not contract rates is an issue the D.C. Circuit

14

didn't actually get to.

15

preserved before the D.C. Circuit, because the claim

16

that some of the rates are not contract rates was

17

raised only by intervenors.

18

But which rates here are contract rates

So while we adhere to our view that these
