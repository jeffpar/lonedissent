CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 08-1065,

5

Pottawattamie County v. McGhee.

6

Mr. Sanders?

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN SANDERS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. SANDERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

If a prosecutor's absolute immunity in

12

judicial proceedings means anything, it means that a

13

prosecutor may not be sued because a trial has ended in

14

a conviction, Yet that is exactly what happened in this

15

case.

16

Lower courts may not fashion exceptions to

17

the immunity this -- this Court provided in Imbler by

18

purporting to relocate a due process injury from the

19

trial to an earlier investigation.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your -- your case here is

21

a polite way of telling us we wasted our time in

22

Buckley v. Fitzsimmons.

23

MR. SANDERS:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

Your Honor I mean, we were just

spinning our wheels in that case?
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SANDERS:

Your Honor, I don't believe so

2

at all.

I think that this case presents exactly the

3

question that Buckley reserved, and that is whether the

4

fabrication of evidence by a prosecutor in and of

5

itself, without regard to its use in some way, states a

6

constitutional cause of action.

7

In this case, the use at trial, obviously,

8

was absolutely immunized under Imbler and many of this

9

other -- this Court's other precedents.

Despite

10

respondent's best efforts to argue that there was some

11

sort of due process violation caused by the fabrication

12

itself, without regard to its use in some way, there

13

simply is no support for that.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does that mean that, even

15

if we were dealing with police officers who did what the

16

prosecutors were alleged to have done at the

17

investigation stage, no prosecutor, only police

18

investigators, the fact that a trial and a conviction

19

had occurred would mean that the police officers were

20

not liable, either?

21

MR. SANDERS:

Your Honor, the fact that a

22

trial and conviction had occurred could mean that the

23

police officers were liable because of the due process

24

violation at the trial, but in footnote 5 of Buckley,

25

this Court was very clear and insisted that there is no
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

disjunction between observing that a prosecutor, like a

2

police officer, has only qualified immunity during the

3

investigation while, at the same time, insisting that

4

that does not affect the fact that the prosecutor has

5

absolute -

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Take two cases.

One is

7

Justice Ginsburg's case, a police officer fabricates the

8

evidence, dupes the prosecuting attorney, or -- or

9

doesn't fully disclose.

10

same thing and gives it to a fellow prosecutor.

11
12

Case two, a prosecutor does the

Same -- should the analysis be precisely the
same?

13

MR. SANDERS:

Your Honor, it should be the

14

same if the prosecutor in the second case that you

15

hypothesize had nothing to do with the later

16

prosecution.

17

prosecutor simply as an ordinary citizen, simply as a

18

complaining witness, as analogous to a police officer,

19

So there's no argument in this case that simply, by

20

virtue of being a prosecutor, a prosecutor has absolute

21

immunity.

22

In other words, if we could view that

The courts below wrongfully abrogated trial

23

immunity because trial is the only place where the

24

injury of conviction and subsequent incarceration could

25

have taken place.

Without reference to that specific
5

1

injury, there is simply no other injury.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -

I'm not sure that I fully

3

grasp your answer to my first question and to Justice

4

Kennedy's, that is, yes or no, if everything that

5

happened was alleged to have happened, but it was done

6

by a police officer or a different prosecutor,

7

nonetheless, the trial went on, the fabricated evidence

8

was introduced, without any participation by the actual

9

prosecutor in that fabrication, does a conviction -

10

does the -- do the police officers or the prosecutors

11

that was not involved in the trial get absolute -- are

12

they -- are they no more liable, not because they have

13

absolute immunity, but because the trial and conviction

14

at which the evidence was used overtakes what liability

15

they might have had, absent the trial?

16

Is that your position?

17

MR. SANDERS:

Your Honor, our position is --

18

I believe I would agree with you.

19

is no liability for the initial fabrication.

20

United States explains in its brief, for a police

21

officer to be held liable in those circumstances, it

22

would need to be under some sort of malicious

23

prosecution theory that would depend on the actual

24

conviction and the use of the evidence at trial.

25

Our position is there
As the

But the use of the evidence at trial is the

injury itself, and that is exclusively a prosecutorial

2

act, only a prosecutor could -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're not answering the

4

question clearly.

Are both the prosecutor, in Justice

5

Ginsburg's hypothetical, and the policeman liable?

6

Can't you answer that?

Yes or no.

7

MR. SANDERS:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

thought your answer was.

10

MR. SANDERS:

Yes.

This Court -

Good.

Yes.

That's what I

The police officer -

11

likely, this Court has never -- never addressed the

12

issue.

13

because the police officer would have no immunity for

14

the use of the evidence.

15

The police officer would likely be liable

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, she's more concerned

16

about the prosecutor, and the prosecutor, also, would be

17

treated just like a police officer?

18

MR. SANDERS:

If the prosecutor performed no

19

prosecutorial function, that's correct.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. SANDERS:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23
24
25

In the case?

That's correct, Your Honor.
But only if the -

only if the evidence is presented at trial?
MR. SANDERS:

But only if the evidence is

presented at trial because that's the only way the
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

evidence can provide injury and so JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the -- so the law is

3

the more deeply you're involved in the wrong, the more

4

likely you are to be immune?

5

proposition.

6

MR. SANDERS:

That's a strange

Your Honor, I think it's not

7

the more deeply you are involved, it's whether you are

8

in the unique position of a prosecutor to cause injury

9

by use of the evidence at trial.

10
11

That is exclusively a

prosecutorial function.
The function test of -- of Buckley goes to

12

what function someone is performing, but only the

13

prosecutor can ever perform the function of actually

14

using the evidence.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it's strange to say

16

you can have a prosecutor, who wasn't involved in the

17

trial, would have liability, but as long as the

18

prosecutor, in effect, turns the investigatory stage

19

material over to himself, rather than to another

20

prosecutor, then there's absolute immunity.

21

MR. SANDERS:

Your Honor, that is correct,

22

but I think the Court, more than 80 years ago, when it

23

summarily affirmed Yaselli v. Goff from the Second

24

Circuit, spoke to this question.

25

In that case, the Court said -- affirmed the
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Second Circuit in its view that, if a prosecutor

2

cannot -- if a prosecutor has absolute immunity for

3

acting maliciously at trial, that immunity cannot be

4

circumvented -

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No, but the -- the

6

question is not at trial, nothing about trial.

7

pretrial conduct.

8
9

MR. SANDERS:

It's the

The -- the odd thing about -

if we are taking out reference to the trial itself, then

10

there simply can be no claim.

11

freestanding right, separate and apart from the due

12

process trial right, yet at the same time -

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Respondents urge a new

But you said that

14

there -- that there would be liability, as long as it

15

wasn't the same person involved in the investigation and

16

the trial.

17

say -- you answered Justice Scalia, that those people

18

separated from the trial would be liable, even though

19

there was a trial, and it's at issue.

20

Even though there had been a trial, you

MR. SANDERS:

Your Honor, looking to the

21

common law, the rationale for that would be a form of

22

malicious prosecution, but as you observed in your

23

concurrence in Albright, asserting malicious prosecution

24

against a prosecutor would be anomalous because it's the

25

prosecutor who is exclusively responsible for causing
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the kind of injury.

2

If a police officer or a nonprosecuting

3

prosecutor simply fabricates the evidence, as Chief

4

Judge Easterbrook of the Seventh Circuit said, there can

5

be no cause of action.

6

It is the exclusive function of a prosecutor

7

in a case who uses the evidence who can cause the

8

injury, and although -

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that makes no sense

10

because, if you go down that road, then what you're

11

saying is that neither the -- neither a police officer

12

or a different prosecutor who fabricated evidence could

13

be liable, either, because the only person who causes

14

the deprivation is the prosecutor who uses the false

15

evidence at trial.

16

MR. SANDERS:

Your Honor, this Court has not

17

spoken to that question, but as you stated, that would

18

be the rationale of the restatement actually.

19

restatement says, if there is no deception of the

20

prosecutor, then it is the prosecutor's willful and free

21

will use of the evidence at trial.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The

Now, the Second Circuit

23

in its decision, Judge Newman, looked at it and said

24

there are two causes to the injury here.

25

fabrication, joint tortfeasors.

One is the

There are two people

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

who can cause any injury and the prosecutor who actually

2

puts the evidence in at trial.

3

police officers and different prosecutors liable because

4

they are assisting in the violation that is occurring.

5

MR. SANDERS:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

That's how you hold

Uh-hmm.
Why doesn't that theory

fit the same prosecutor who commits two different acts?

8

MR. SANDERS:

Your Honor, I think -

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

One commits the direct

10

violation, and the other act, the investigatory act,

11

contributes to it, leads to it as a joint activity with

12

it.

13

MR. SANDERS:

Your Honor, I believe the

14

analysis is not that it -- because it leads to the

15

injury itself.

16

use of false evidence at trial has only one element

17

under this Court's precedents in Pyle and Mooney and

18

Hysler and Rochin.

19

of the evidence at trial.

20

is absolutely immune is not to say that someone else

21

who's responsible for -

22

The tort of wrongful conviction based on

That element is the prosecutor's use
But simply because that act

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're confusing -- the

23

constitutional injury is the deprivation of liberty.

24

That's the injury.

25

MR. SANDERS:

That's correct.
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What causes that injury

2

is not an element of the crime.

3

is have you proven the violation, have you proven the

4

injury.

5

MR. SANDERS:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Well So why does the use

define the scope of the injury?

8
9

It is -- the question

MR. SANDERS:

Because that is the way a

prosecutor would be held liable.

The cause of action

10

against a prosecutor, even though he would be absolutely

11

immune, would be the prosecutor's knowing or even

12

unknowing use of the false evidence at trial.

13

this case, Respondents ask for a free-standing due

14

process right that would somehow at the same time

15

protect the interest against wrongful conviction at

16

trial.

That simply can't be.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in

This Court's decision What about the view that

18

Judge Fairchild expressed very simply.

19

fabrication had not occurred, there never would have

20

been any trial.

21

MR. SANDERS:

He said if this

Your Honor, as we discussed in

22

our opening brief in this case, I think that Judge

23

Fairchild's reasoning is classic malicious prosecution

24

reasoning.

25

impelled the prosecution.

That is, that it's the false evidence that
But again, this Court has
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

been absolutely clear that a malicious prosecution

2

theory cannot be asserted against a prosecutor because a

3

prosecutor can initiate willfully and maliciously a

4

wrongful prosecution based on good evidence, bad

5

evidence, or no evidence at all.

6

It's simply untenable to say -- and this

7

Court's decision last term in Van de Kamp made clear

8

that where the injury comes at trial, where that is the

9

interest protected against, that you can somehow

abrogate immunity and continue with a case based on that

Wrongful conviction on the basis of the introduction JUSTICE STEVENS:

Why doesn't the theory

the facts of this case because in this case the

15

prosecutors made the decision independently to initiate

16

the prosecution.

17

their capacity as prosecutors.

It's undisputed that they did that in

This investigation by the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What's the difference?

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SANDERS:

I think that that reasoning

2

would be to what this Court affirmed in Yaselli and what

3

this Court has said -- and which the Court has

4

repeatedly cited favorably, and that is -- and it would

5

also run up against the concerns that Justice Kennedy

6

indicated in his concurrence in Buckley, which this -

7

the majority in Buckley also disputed and said there is

8

no disjunction between qualified immunity for a

9

prosecutor during an investigation but absolute immunity

10
11

for the act of setting the prosecution in motion.
The Court was absolutely clear in footnote 5

12

of Buckley that there was no disjunction, and as this

13

Court has indicated in Malley v. Briggs and other cases,

14

anything other than absolute immunity for a prosecutor

15

would impair the -- would impair the performance of a

16

central actor in the judicial process.

With the Court's permission, I'll reserve
the balance of my time.

that argument.

2

MR. KATYAL:

Right, and with respect to that

3

I think we have several, several responses.

4

is that this Court has rejected that kind of mere

5

foreseeability analysis in the context of section 1983.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

The first

Mere foreseeability.

You

7

can fill in those boundaries, Toffler, not Toffler, as

8

you wish.

9

after all, we're just drawing a line somewhere within

But the basic theory isn't a problem because,

10

the stage of an ongoing tort on the basis of policy, and

11

Buckley suggests such a line.

I don't see a conceptual

12

problem there, is my problem.

Maybe there are practical

13

problems, but I don't see a conceptual one.

14

MR. KATYAL:

I think there are practical and

15

conceptual problems, which is why Buckley reserved

16

precisely this question in footnote 5, and here's the

17

basic policy or conceptual concern.

18

if a section 1983 defendant is absolutely immune for the

19

constitutional wrong, then you can't read back in time;

20

a plaintiff can't look back in time and isolate some

21

other acts as to which they are nonimmune and thereby -

Our point is that

I interrupt you right

there.

trying to draw.

That's the line I'm

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KATYAL:

And, Justice Breyer, I'm saying

2

to do that requires you to read the due process

3

violation as occurring sometime before the trial, and

4

then we're back to the free-standing rationale and the

5

opening up of the due process clause to something this

6

Court has never, ever accepted.

that.

that and I'm having a hard time finding a practical

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And how do you get the

policeman who has fabricated the evidence?
MR. KATYAL:

Because the policeman

4

essentially induces the prosecution at an earlier point

5

of time and acts through the innocent agent, the

6

prosecutor, that introduction of evidence at trial is

7

not something as to which the policeman has any sort of

8

absolute immunity.

9

of a prosecutor introducing evidence, that is something

And so in Justice Breyer's example

10

as to which the prosecutor is absolutely immune.

11

is where the constitutional violation begins.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What if a prosecutor knows

that it's fabricated evidence?

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. KATYAL:

Suppose he knows?

And if the prosecutor does

know, we don't think that there is a Fifth Amendment due

process violation.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Again, the more aggravated

the tort, the greater the immunity.

4

MR. KATYAL:

5

And I agree that that seems a

little odd -

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You're basically saying

7

that you cannot aid and abet someone who is immune, and

8

that's just not the law.

9

MR. KATYAL:

No, what I'm saying and what

10

this Court's decisions have said is that absolute

11

immunity doesn't exist to protect bad apples.

12

reflects a larger interest in protecting judicial

13

information coming into the judicial process.

14

prosecutors have to worry at trial that every act they

15

undertake will somehow open up the door to liability,

16

then they will flinch in the performance of their duties

17

and not introduce that evidence.

distinction between the police officer, who is liable,

19

and the prosecutor, who is -- who is absolutely immune.

And that is the

A prosecutor is not

going to flinch when he suspects evidence is perjured or

Do you really want to send a message to

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Sotomayor, we

2

absolutely want to send that message.

3

allegations of wrongdoing, as this Court has recognized

4

in Imbler and Van de Kamp, can -- can supersede that.

5

And just to give you -

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The worry is that

Am I right that none of

7

the -- neither of the two prosecutors in this case were

8

sanctioned in any way for their conduct?

9

MR. KATYAL:

I believe that is correct, and

10

I also believe that no ethics complaints were ever

11

brought.

12

Federal court seeking money damages instead of ethics

13

violations and the like.

14

That is, rather the Respondents went into

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you have no reason

15

to dispute the numerous studies we were provided that

16

show that as a matter of routine prosecutors are not

17

sanctioned for improper prosecutorial conduct in the

18

investigatory stage, are you?

19

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I do think that there is

20

a debate in the briefs before this Court, including the

21

brief by 12,400 or so prosecutors that takes the reverse

22

view.

23

for the legislature.

24
25

But be that as it may, I think that is a question

This Court has said repeatedly that those
ethics and disciplinary violations are -- are a
22
Alderson Reporting Company

1

successful deterrent, and there is others as well that

2

this Court has pointed to that may be available,

3

including counsel's liability.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you can't have it

5

both ways and say this is a policy we should take into

6

account and then when Justice Sotomayor asks you a

7

question, say:

8

mean, you're -- it seems to me you're trying to have it

9

both ways.

10

Oh, well, that's for the legislature.

MR. KATYAL:

I

Well, with respect to a cause

11

of action and whether the principles of absolute

12

immunity apply to this, I think this Court has already

13

recognized several times that the overriding interest is

14

protecting the judicial process and not letting

15

information be chilled and not come in.

16

To give you a couple of data points, there

17

were 14.4 million arrests in the year 2006 and 1.1,

18

approximately, million felony convictions.

19

theory would allow prosecutors in any of those

20

circumstances to be sued for an alleged fabrication of

21

evidence, and that's something that could be -- that's

22

something that's not that hard to envision, since

23

criminal evidence, unlike civil evidence, is messy.

24

often involves cooperation agreements, leniency

25

agreements and the like, and for that reason it's very
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Respondents'

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

natural, and this Court has recognized that in Imbler,

2

for the defendant in a criminal case to say:

3

going to blame the prosecutor; they fabricated evidence,

4

they made this story up; and -- and then seek civil

5

liability.

6

Well, I'm

And what this Court has said repeatedly is

7

that the societal interest suffers.

And that is why

8

it's not about, Justice Kennedy, protecting the bad

9

apple and someone who exacerbates the harm by carrying

10

the fabricated evidence through trial.

11

this Court's absolute immunity decisions consistently

12

reflect is the principle that when someone is

13

introducing evidence at trial, you don't want to chill

14

them in the performance of their duties in any way

15

through the rubric of civil liability.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Rather, what

I don't understand why at

17

the time of introducing the evidence, the policy

18

concerns that you've described arise, because we were

19

criticizing what he did before he introduced the

20

evidence.

21

MR. KATYAL:

When -- when the evidence is

22

introduced and it's the prosecutor himself who developed

23

that evidence, maybe through flipping a witness or

24

something like that, that -

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Right, and he would know

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whether or not it was fabricated.

2

MR. KATYAL:

Well, he would know whether or

3

not it's fabricated, but the question is whether he

4

would know that he could insulate himself from an

5

allegation of wrongdoing.

6

which allows the due process clause to be some sort of

7

free-standing right, would permit those suits even at

8

the earliest stages of an investigation and permit

9

strike suits even before the criminal process is

And that, I think, is a fundamental point,

12

which is this Court, no court has, ever really accepted

13

the notion that prosecutors can be liable, that there is

a cause of action for -

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But haven't we said that

16

during the investigating stage their conduct is subject

17

to different rules than during the trial?

18

MR. KATYAL:

For purposes of absolute

19

immunity, and we agree with that.

So, for example,

20

Justice Stevens, in your Fourth Amendment decision in

21

1975 on the Seventh Circuit, we agree there is liability

when a prosecutor is, for example, conducting a raid or

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I just don't see the -- I

2

don't to see if I can understand the reason why the time

3

in which the violation is completed, namely after the

4

trial, goes to the question of whether there is

5

liability for pretrial conduct.

6

MR. KATYAL:

Well, we think there is no

liability for pretrial conduct, and so long as you agree

8

with me that the due process clause violation begins

9

only at the trial -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It was completed at the

trial, but it began when the -- the phony investigation

started.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

23
24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As I listen to Petitioners, I hear two
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arguments to why there ought to be liability for the

2

prosecutor -- rather, for the police officer and not the

3

prosecutor, and both of those are arguments this Court

4

has already heard and rejected.

5

On the immunity issue, the argument

6

Petitioners make seems to distill to the proposition

7

that as long as you're suing a prosecutor for injuries

8

inflicted at trial, the prosecutor ought to have

9

absolute immunity.

10

Now, that's not a crazy theory of immunity.

11

It's exactly the theory of immunity that the Seventh

12

Circuit adopted in the Buckley decision and this Court

13

reversed, unanimously as to the press conference and by

14

a majority opinion with respect to pretrial

15

investigatory conduct involving fabrication.

16

sounds familiar, it should.

the claim is based on the evaluation of the truthfulness

the prosecutorial stage?

25

MR. CLEMENT:

I think we want them

What concerns me about your

10

argument is the -- is a real fear that it will

11

eviscerate Imbler.

12

it will not have that effect, but as the Solicitor

13

General argued at the end of his argument, a very -- in

14

the typical criminal case, the witnesses are not

15

John Q. Public with -- who have never engaged in any

16

wrongful activity.

Now, maybe you can convince me that

17

A typical witness is -- well, let's take the

18

case of the prosecution of a -- a white -- of the CEO of

19

a huge corporation for insider trading or some other

20

white-collar violation.

21

this person is, let's say, the CFO of this company, who

22

when initially questioned by law enforcement officials

23

and investigatory officials, made -- made statements

24

denying any participation in any wrongdoing, but

25

eventually changed his story and testifies against the

deal.

3

Now, your argument, in a case like that -

4

or you could change the facts, make it an organized

5

crime case, make it a prosecution of a drug kingpin

6

who's testifying -- the witness against him is a

7

lower-ranking person in the organization who has a

8

criminal record, maybe has previously committed perjury,

has made numerous false statements, is subject to

organized crime cases and insider trading cases.

claims are going to be brought it's probably the Second

that the prosecutor knew that it was false.

2

Now, in the acquittal situations, this Court

3

doesn't have a case directly on point.

4

the Hartman decision, for example, Hartman v.

5

and apply it to this context, I assume that in the

6

context of an acquittal if you tried to bring a claim

like this, this Court would interpret through the common

law the -- a malicious prosecution type element that you

would have to satisfy.

because if at the point 32

6

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, two things, Justice

First of all, if you have all -- if you had the

8

interview and the re-interview before probable cause and

9

you have the allegations that it was done for the avowed

10

purpose of depriving the person of their liberty, then

11

you would, I think, apply Iqbal, and you would ask under

12

all the circumstances of that case whether it's a

13

plausible allegation.

14

And this Court is obviously in a better

15

position than I am to say how it would apply Iqbal in

difficult to allege.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

you don't really know, right?

7

concerned about the chilling effect on the prosecutors.

8

We don't know what the impact of the Second Circuit's

9

decision has been on the prosecutors.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

In other words, we're

Well, Your Honor, we don't

11

know for sure.

We don't know either way, because either

12

way this Court is going to adopt a clear rule.

13

can say is at least I'm pointing to empirical evidence

14

in a circuit that has lived with this rule for a decade.

15

That seems to me a better empirical basis to go on than

16

absolutely nothing.

What I

17

But let me give you another example, which

18

is this Court a couple of years ago decided a decision

19

called Hartman v. Moore.

20

recognized that there was a tort called, I think,

21

retaliatory inducement to prosecute.

22

Hartman v. Moore sort of

Now, in footnote 8 this Court recognized

23

that actually you could sue a prosecutor for retaliatory

24

inducement to prosecute if you focused on the

25

investigatory activities.

That's exactly the same basic
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

theory we have here, which is you focus on the

2

investigatory activities of a prosecutor and say that

3

there is a valid 1983 claim.

Now, again, to my knowledge there have not

5

been a flood of Hartman claims brought against

basis for the 1983 claim without the submission at

need a concrete hypothetical.

Suppose that there was

this -- the prosecutor put on this fabricated evidence

21

at trial, and then the -- the whole case sort of

22

unraveled because the system actually worked the way

23

it's supposed to.

24

cracked and it became clear that there was this

25

conspiracy to use perjured evidence.

On cross-examination the witness

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, at that point -- I mean, I suppose the

2

government's theory would be because you never deprived

3

the person of their liberty, the knowing use by the

4

prosecutor of perjured testimony at trial does not

5

violate the due process clause.

6

But I hope that's not the rule.

I mean, I

7

hope that in a Mooney case, if you bring the -- make a

8

Mooney violation against somebody who is actually

9

guilty, so you knowingly use perjured testimony against

10

somebody that's -- that's guilty, so if you did a

11

harmless error analysis, you would say, well, the use of

12

the perjured testimony really didn't deprive the person

13

of their liberty because they were otherwise -

because their proposition seems to be that -- this is

2

the other argument you have heard and rejected -- is

3

that if there's an absolutely immune act in the causal

4

chain, then that somehow means that there is no

5

violation.

6

Think about who was sued in the Malley.

It

7

was the police officers.

What did the police officers

8

do?

9

their actions independent of the absolute immune act of

They procured an invalid arrest warrant.

No.

Now, did

10

the magistrate injure the plaintiffs?

Without the

11

magistrate issuing the warrant, there was no arrest,

12

there's no search, there's no injury to the plaintiffs.

13

So we allow in our system somebody to bring

14

a constitutional tort claim, even though there's an

15

absolutely immune act in the causal chain.

16

The lower court in Malley actually accepted

17

exactly this argument, that if you have any absolutely

18

immune act in the causal chain that breaks it off.

19

Court rejected it and was frankly fairly dismissive,

20

dismissed it in the footnote, footnote 7 of the opinion.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So that -- so that's

not -

3

MR. CLEMENT:

No, I think it illustrates the

4

principle, which is you don't have to have a completed

5

constitutional violation in your 1983 action.

6

Malley illustrates that principle, but so does the text

7

of -- of section 1983, frankly.

8

force you to have a completed constitutional violation.

9

It provides liability if you subject someone to a

I mean,

Section 1983 doesn't

10

constitutional violation or cause them to be subjected

11

to a constitutional violation.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The difference here is that

13

the -- the absolutely immune act which follows the -

14

the unlawful act is -- is an absolutely immune act by

15

the very actor who performed the earlier act that -

16

that you say induces liability.

17

what's the use of giving him liability later on if -- if

18

you can simply drag him into litigation by -- by

19

alleging that he at an earlier stage committed a

20

violation?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so the argument is,

Well, the That's the difference.

I

23

mean, to me that's the -- the crux of this, that it is

the same actor who has absolute liability whom you're

ask both of you to go back and read two things, and I

read your separate opinion in Burns.

you confronted just this issue.

prosecution and you said:

of as kind of a complaining witness in that context,

15

procure a warrant that they were subsequently involved

16

in?

17

think you got it right there.

And you said:

18

Because in Burns

You conceptualized what

Now, could a prosecutor, sort

I don't see any reason why not.

I

The other thing I would ask you to look at

19

is footnote 8 of the Hartman v. Moore decision, because

20

there you were dealing with a retaliatory prosecution

claim.

22

say, you know, it's really not a retaliation -- a

23

retaliatory prosecution claim; what it is is a

24

retaliatory inducement to prosecute case.

25

Now, the Court's opinion was very careful to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
40
Alderson Reporting Company

If you cannot rely

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

on anything that goes on at the trial to establish the

2

due process violation, what do you rely on to establish

3

the violation?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice -

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess the question

6

is where is it complete, or do you say it doesn't have

7

to be a complete violation?

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I guess what I would do,

Mr. Chief Justice, is try to take issue with your

10

premise, which is that we can't advert to the absolute

11

immune act at all.

12

isn't -

13

Of course we can.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, this

Well, let's say that

14

you -- let's say that you can't because we read Imbler

15

as conferring absolute immunity on what goes on at the

16

trial.

17

a constitutional violation, right?

18

And if you can't advert to that, you don't have

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I would still say we do,

19

but please let me try to take one more crack at the

20

premise, which is Imbler is not a use immunity case and

21

this Court has rejected the proposition that just

22

because you're absolutely immune for an act there's no

23

evidentiary use of that in going after conduct that was

24

earlier in the causal chain.

25

This Court specifically confronted that in a
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case called Dennis v. Sparks that was with, you know,

2

the granddaddy of them all, judicial immunity, and said

3

even the judge's actions could be proved up as part of a

4

tort action.

5
6

So there is no use immunity for -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Against -- against

the judge?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

It wasn't against the judge,

8

but I -- but with all due respect, I don't think that

9

matters.

10
11

And I also think CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's the

distinction here in this case, isn't it?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, but -- but it's a

13

distinction without a difference.

14

this Court confronted in -- in Hartman in footnote 8.

15

It's a distinction Justice Scalia confronted.

16

the consequences of accepting their view is to really

17

turn all of your absolute immunity cases into a fool's

18

errand.

19

It's a distinction

I mean, think about Kalina.

And also,

I mean, the

20

supporting affidavit wasn't the thing that inflicted

21

injury.

22

two documents that the supporting affidavit supported,

23

the warrant and the information.

24

made no sense for this Court to say, well, there is only

25

qualified immunity for the supporting affidavit, so

let's send this back to the lower court, if you couldn't

even get into evidence the fact that there was an

4

So too in the Malley case, of course you

5

can use -- now it's a different -- it's a different

6

person.

7

In Kalina -- Kalina, it's the same person.
Or take a look at Burns, for example.

In

that's not what injured the plaintiff in that case.

10

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It

In terms of the

12

chilling impact on the prosecutor, what difference does

13

it make whether it's at trial or pretrial for use at

14

trial?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think it makes all the

16

difference in the world in the sense that if -- if they

17

know that everything they do at trial is going to be

18

protected, those functions, which is the basis of this

19

Court's functional approach to absolute immunity, are

20

going to be protected.

21

Now, if they're going to be -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it won't be protected.

22

They won't have that assurance, because when they -

23

when they produce evidence at trial, oh, yeah, I guess

24

the production at trial will be protected, but you're -

25

you're telling us that they can go back and say, ah, but

you got that evidence in a bad manner, and therefore we

difference as far as the deterrent effect upon the

JUSTICE BREYER:

There's a different

21

tendency, which I would say this is a slight fluke, what

22

you're describing.

23

Alito brought up, that, other things being equal, I

24

think it's probably a good thing to get prosecutors

25

involved in the questioning process.

I'm more worried about what Justice

44
Alderson Reporting Company

That -- that has a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

kind of check on the police.

2

And the concern I'd have is that the --this

3

will discourage the prosecutors from becoming involved

4

in the witness -- witness questioning process, at least

5

not before the police are well on the way.

6

a very negative incentive, I would think.

And that is

7

So what is your most pro-prosecutorial rule

8

that you could live with that will in fact minimize the

9

risk of that kind of disincentive?

Now, are you just

going to say, well, Buckley?

safe rule that will allow you to win your case?

I

Now I could,

We have amicus briefs here
They say -- they say it's

6

Well And they say they do it in

In other places, they do it a lot.

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I mean, another thing

7

presumably, Justice Breyer, you want to encourage is

8

having the police officers come to the prosecutors and

9

get legal advice about what they're doing.

And this

10

Court squarely confronted that question in Burns and

11

said the advice-giving function, which is a function

12

only a prosecutor, only a lawyer anyways, can perform -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, could you answer

14

Justice Breyer's question, which I -- I think raises a

15

-- a critical point in terms of Justice Alito's examples

16

of talking to the witness.

17

point -- I think in Buckley, the "judicial phase."

18

is this the judicial phase?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

Why isn't that at some

Well, Justice Kennedy, let me

20

respond.

21

improve on the probable cause line.

22

case, the police officers and the prosecutors were

23

involved in this from the get-go.

24
25

Why

Let me say why I don't think I can really

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, in this

No, but probable cause

doesn't work because you have -- you have probable cause
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

once you fabricate the evidence.

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think -

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

MR. CLEMENT:

That's circular.

No, I don't think so.

I think

5

for the purposes of evaluating when there's probable

6

cause, you have to eliminate the fabricated evidence,

7

and so I think that you evaluate probable cause, but

8

here's why I think it's the right line, Because think

9

about the prosecutor's special function.

10

If you don't have probable cause to arrest

11

any individual for a crime, then the function the police

12

officers ought to be performing is one of a

13

truth-seeking function and that is a classic police

14

investigatory function.

15

Now, the moment they have probable cause,

16

I'm willing to listen to the argument that at that point

17

they shift roles, and at that point they're not looking

18

at the evidence the way the police officer is, just to

19

find out whodunit; but they're looking at it to say,

20

well I have a job to do, I have to put a case on, and,

21

you know, this person says what they say, and, you know,

22

there's some problems with that and the jury's not going

23

to believe that, so let me talk to him some more.

24
25

That's why I think the probable cause line
is not only administrable, but it makes sense in this
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

context.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose the prosecutor

3

isn't sure there's probable cause and he calls -- calls

4

in the accountant, the CFO, and really doesn't begin to

5

believe his story, so he starts probing and finally he

6

gets the CFO to change his story with the plea -- plea

7

bargain.

8

Or is that still clearly investigatory?

9

Would that be part of the judicial process?

MR. CLEMENT:

I think at the point -- if the

10

interview begins and he doesn't think he has probable

11

cause, I think that that -

12
13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
out.

14

Well, he's trying to find

That's what MR. CLEMENT:

Of course he is trying to find

15

out.

16

there's probable cause necessarily to identify a

17

particular suspect.

18

probable cause to arrest anyone?

19

question a police officer asks every single day.

20

But he's -- but he's not trying to find out if

What he's trying to do, is there

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that's exactly the

Well, also, you're making

21

me more worried because I think, if 85 percent of all

22

the defendants -- or 90 percent plead guilty, it might

23

be a highly desirable thing to get prosecutors involved

24

in the truth-discovering process, I mean, so that they

25

don't just see themselves as the job of -- well, we're
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

going to take somebody, put them in jail.

2
3

Maybe -- maybe that's a reason for pushing
it back a little bit, this -- this line.

4

MR. CLEMENT:

Well -- you know, I'm not sure

5

what the logical place to push it back any further is,

6

and I think -- you know -

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Where have you got it now?

8

You've got it as when there is probable cause for

9

believing that someone has committed a crime?

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Someone?

So it's

12

someone -- needn't be the particular person they

13

eventually indict?

14

MR. CLEMENT:

That's right.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Uh-huh.

And let me say this, Justice

17

Breyer, I mean, I know you don't want to talk about

18

Burns, but I'd like to, just for a second, because I

19

think it's a very similar policy concern.

20

As a policy matter, sure, we want

21

prosecutors to get -- to give advice to police officers,

22

but qualified immunity is not insignificant protection,

23

and think about that, I mean, the incentives you're

24

creating for the same anomaly that the Court recognized

25

in Buckley.

The incentive would really 49

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
was -- I'm sorry.

Well, we thought it

Why don't you finish your answer?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

4

incentive would really be perverse.

5

police -- if the police officer comes to the prosecutor

6

and says -- you know, we want to fabricate evidence to

7

frame it, can we do it?

8

you can do that, go ahead; there's qualified immunity.

9

I just wanted to say the
Under Burns, if the

And the prosecutor says, yes,

Now, if the prosecutor says, go ahead and

10

let me help, there would somehow be absolute immunity.

11

I mean, that is really an anomalous result, that it's

12

the n anomaly that caused this Court in Buckley to draw

13

the line at probable cause.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I was going to

15

suggest in response to your point that -- you know,

16

qualified immunity is really significant.

17

is, but we've recognized, in a number of contexts, in

18

the judicial area, for example, that it's -- it's not

19

enough.

20

Of course, it

We have also recognized that in the

21

prosecutorial area, and trying to draw the line where

22

you do -- I think this was one of the points Justice

23

Alito was making, is that, sometimes, you're

24

investigating and preparing your case at the same time.

25

You don't just sit back and say, I'm -- I'm
50
Alderson Reporting Company

just going to look and see what I can find.

2

particular areas.

3

four things, So you are looking at those four things.

4

You are preparing your case, and you're investigating.

5

You have

The prosecution requires you to show

MR. CLEMENT:

And, again, the Court

6

addressed exactly this Court in the -- exactly that

7

issue in the Buckley decision and said, sure -- you

8

know, from -- with the benefit of hindsight, you can

9

sort of retrospectively look and make anything in the

10

investigatory stage part of -- and part and parcel of

11

the prosecution.

12

And I don't think that was something that

13

this Court saw as a reason not to draw a clean line

14

that's consistent with the functional approach.

15

consistent, not just with Buckley, but with Burns and

16

with Kalina and with a whole host of this Court's

17

decisions.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's

In -- in answer to Justice

19

Breyer's question, would -- would it be a -- would it be

20

practical and conceptually correct to draw the line at

21

the stage at which the prosecutor is interviewing

22

witnesses to evaluate credibility?

23
24
25

So, at that stage, the prosecutorial
function has begun and absolute immunity would kick in.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, if I could add, I mean,
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I suppose I might be able -

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Not on whether there is

3

probable cause because probable cause is -- is

4

evanescent.

5

it is inextricably intertwined with what the prosecutor

6

is doing in questioning the witness.

7

MR. CLEMENT:

It comes, and it goes.

It is -- it is -

And let me say this:

If I

8

could add a couple of words, I think we could probably

9

live with that line, which is, if the prosecutor is

10

interviewing those witnesses with an eye towards

11

credibility for use at trial, I mean, that's a line

12

that, I think, would be, I think, probably pretty

13

consistent with probable cause, but something that we

14

could live with, but -

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

But with a line toward

16

investigating credibility for use at a trial, which

17

is -- which is, at that point, foreordained, but, if the

18

evaluation is being done for the purpose of determining

19

whether there should be a trial, then, no.

20

answer?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

That's your

Well, I mean, I worry that

22

words are being put in my mouth.

I would say that, if

23

the prosecutor is interviewing the witness for the

24

purpose of judging their credibility at trial, then

25

that's something for which you may be able to sort of
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

tweak the line on Buckley and say that's covered.
I actually think it won't make any

3

difference because I think that should only be happening

4

after probable cause.

5

If I could -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, your approach,

6

then, encourages prosecutors to be trigger happy.

7

They're prosecuting right now because they know, then,

8

that everything else, they have absolute immunity, so -

9

you know, shoot first and ask questions later.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, shoot first -- you mean

11

go to an impartial magistrate and try to get somebody

12

arrested or -

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, just begin the

14

formulation.

I'm -- I'm starting to prosecute this

15

person, rather than saying, let's look, let's

16

investigate, let's interview, and then decide who we're

17

going to prosecute.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I suppose -

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In Justice Alito's

20

hypothetical, you've got a CFO, you can -- you know,

21

you've probably got probable cause to go after him as

22

well, but you want to begin interviewing him, to see if

23

he's going to flip in your case against the CEO.

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, if you have probable

cause, then I think you're on the other side of the
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Buckley line, and that's an objective determination, and

2

I think -

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you've got -

4

you've got to make that decision early in the process,

5

rather than later.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think it's -- I'm not

7

sure it's a decision you have to make.

8

actually something that would be evaluated objectively

9

after the fact, and I think the way that this Court

10

should approach this case is neither of the parties

11

before you have asked this Court to overturn Buckley.

12

I think it's

I wouldn't do it under those circumstances,

13

but, of course, it's worth adding that, if you were

14

going to overturn Buckley, then the place to probably

15

start would be to go back to first principles, and if

16

you're going to go back to first principles, then what

17

you're going to find is that there was no common law

18

support at all for absolute immunity.

19

And I wouldn't think that this Court was

20

particularly interested in coming up with implied

21

immunities that aren't in the statute and had no basis

22

at the common law, and that's why I think some of the

23

Justices that have looked at this as an original matter

24

have tended to be quite reluctant in recognizing

25

absolute immunity because it lacks support in the text
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and it lacks support at the common law.

2

So we're -- we're happy with the lines that

3

this Court has already drawn.

4

to go back to first principles, well, let's go back to

5

first principles and look at -- the at the statute

6

Congress passed in 1871.

7

But if the Court's going

That statute did not provide any immunities,

8

and I do think, as we say in the brief, this is a case

9

where it's important not to lose the forest for the

10

trees because this is a statute was passed -- passed in

11

1871.

12

This is one of the great civil rights statutes.
Is it really plausible to think that the

13

Congress that passed this statute didn't want to provide

14

a remedy in the circumstances before the Court today?

15

think it's clear, from this Court's cases -- there may

16

not be a case that lines up all the dots exactly, but I

17

think it's clear, from this Court's cases, that the

18

police officer that engages in this misconduct has

19

committed a grave, grave constitutional violation and

20

ought to be liable.

21

I think the prosecutor who engages in the

22

pretrial misconduct and then doesn't participate in the

23

trial is just as liable as that police officer, and I

24

can't think of a single reason why the only reason a

25

prosecutor would get absolute immunity is, if they not

only participated in the pretrial misconduct, but

2

completed the scheme by committing further misconduct at

3

trial.

4
5

For all those reasons, we think the Court
should affirm.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN SANDERS

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12
13
14

MR. SANDERS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

We have four main points.
Beginning with the Second Circuit's decision

15

in Zahrey and subsequent cases in the Second Circuit,

16

have significantly cut back on the meaning of Zahrey.

17

The Wray decision, which we discussed in our reply

18

brief, the Gonzalez decision, which we discussed in our

19

opening brief, have not allowed for this kind of

20

continuous liability for a prosecutor.

21

They have made very clear, particularly the

22

Gonzalez decision, that when it is a prosecutor's

23

actions before a judge advocating on behalf of the

24

State, that are responsible for a deprivation of

25

liberty, in that situation, absolute immunity applies.

I think it's important to understand the
consequences -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what does that

4

prove?

What does that prove?

5

you bring that up because it shows that the fact that

6

there aren't many cases, only 17 in the -- in the Second

7

Circuit, it doesn't mean anything because the Second

8

Circuit is not applying as liberal a rule as your

9

opponent suggests.

10

Is that -

11

MR. SANDERS:

I don't understand why

No, Your Honor.

I think it's

12

to -- I think it's to say that the Zahrey decision has

13

not had the kind of impact and has not been applied in a

14

way that respondents are asking for it to be applied.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

That's -- that's just

16

what I said, and, therefore -- and had it been applied

17

that way, there would have been more than 17 cases in

18

the Second Circuit.

19
20

MR. SANDERS:

I'm not sure I understand the

question.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. SANDERS:

Okay.

The -- I think it's important

23

to understand the consequences of affirming the courts

24

below, either on the basis of the Zahrey theory or on

25

the freestanding due process theory offered by
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

respondents.

2

It would work a radical change in the law of

3

immunity because it would mean that far more wrongful

4

conviction claims against prosecutors would go forward

5

under only qualified immunity.

6

That is the inevitable consequence of

7

affirming the courts below in this case.

These cases

8

are not difficult, as Justice Alito said, to plead,

9

particularly because, in most of these sorts of cases,

10

most of the discovery will have been done during the

11

post-conviction review process.

12

And so there will be plenty of -- plenty of

13

grounds for a plaintiff to allege a plausible violation

14

during the investigative process and survive a motion to

15

dismiss or survive summary judgment, even if,

16

ultimately, that comes to nothing, the consequence would

17

be to hold prosecutors to inconsistent standards of

18

liability, qualified immunity or absolute immunity,

19

based simply on the allegations in a complaint,

20

something this Court has specifically said is -- is not

21

appropriate and should not be -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I want, before you're

23

24

dimensions of the claim because you rely heavily on the

independent grounds for liability under some Fourth

12

Amendment malicious prosecution theory, which is not at

13

issue in this case, and possibly under State law

14

remedies, as Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas

15

indicated in their concurrence in Albright, we do not go

16

to the Federal constitution's Due Process Clause unless

17

we're sure that the plaintiffs have exhausted their

18

possible remedies under State law.

19

State law provides a cause of action for malicious

20

prosecution.

the wrongful institution of criminal proceedings, that

in that case there may be some sort of Fourth Amendment

matter.

MR. SANDERS:

Your Honor, I believe the

Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence would still

Alderson Reporting Company

indicate that that is a concern of the Fourth Amendment,

2

not the Due Process Clause, and that pursuant to Paul v.

sort of State law cause of action for defamation or loss
