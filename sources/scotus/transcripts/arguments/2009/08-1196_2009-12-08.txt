CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We’ll hear argument

Mr. Ayer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. AYER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

When counsel for the United States defended

11

the McNally prosecution before this Court in 1987, the

12

first thing he did was to acknowledge that many of the

13

existing intangible rights cases contained what he

14

called “extravagant” language that, on its face,

15

extended the doctrine far beyond the principle that one

16

can be guilty of fraudulently denying others the

17

performance of a clear legal duty that he owes.

18
19

I know that because the government lawyer
was me --

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. AYER:

And that was the only thing I

22

said that day that the 7-2 majority agreed with.

23

years later, and one 28-word statute later, the United

24

States is now pressing to take that extravagant language

25

of the pre-McNally cases to the bank.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

But 22

Official

1

It does that by contending that a public

2

official commits honest services fraud simply by failing

3

to disclose an arguable conflict of interest, even

4

though he has no legal duty to disclose apart from the

5

words of 1346.

6

And it -- and it is possible to do that

7

under the extravagant words of the earlier cases by

8

relying on a supposed Federal common law fiduciary duty

9

of loyalty that is owed by all public officials,

10

including State officials, to their constituents.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if the --

12

there were a State law that said you must disclose

13

anything that could reasonably be viewed as a conflict

14

of interest, then -- then you would lose?

15

MR. AYER:

Your Honor, you are now asking me

16

the question about the outer perimeter of the statute.

17

My argument is that a duty -- some duty clear in the law

18

is absolutely necessary.
What kind of a duty would be sufficient is a

19
20

much more difficult question, and it's a difficult

21

question for -- for, essentially, two reasons.
One is, the duty must be clear and not

22
23
24
25

vague.

That's one point.
The more complex point is a point relating

to this Court's clear statement rule and related

concepts concerning particular duties.

2

3

have certain consequences.

4

If a State

Generally speaking, contractual duties have

6

themselves in certain ways in a contractual system.

7

They don't expect to go to jail, usually, for breaching

8

a contractual duty.

9

People conduct

Similarly --

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, the mail fraud

10

statute carries a very heavy penalty, and are you -- you

11

are arguing that Congress intended to impose this

12

penalty on individuals who breach some Federal or State

13

disclosure requirement, even if that is viewed by the

14

body that is responsible for the disclosure requirement

15

as a very minor thing.

16

MR. AYER:

Oh, I'm -- I'm -- Your Honor, if

17

I left that impression, let me completely reject it.

18

That is not at all what I'm arguing.

19

To the contrary, I am arguing that -- that

20

ultimately, the task this Court may decide it must

21

pursue -- which, I think, frankly, is quite separate

22

from our case, because our case is a case where there is

23

no duty, period, in the law, which I want to explain

24

procedurally why that's true -- if you are going to

25

decide that some duties are enough and other duties are
5
Alderson Reporting Company

not, it is a very challenging thing to do, and a very –JUSTICE ALITO:

But that's what you’re

3

asking us to do.

4

that there cannot be a conviction without the violation

5

of some duty.

6

I understand you are saying that --

But if we agree with that, then we are going

7

down the road of deciding what sort of duty suffices,

8

and does it have to be a duty that is backed up by a

9

State criminal sanction?

10

What if -- what if it's a 1-year felony?

11

What if it's a misdemeanor?

12

civil penalty?

What if it's a -- simply a

What if it's simply some sort of

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. AYER:

Right.

Well, Your Honor, I -- let me --

17

I want to repeat again that -- that in -- in my view,

18

our case doesn't turn on my ability to satisfactorily

19

draw this line which no court has driven -- drawn

20

effectively in 50 years.

21

But I would -- I would say this:

There are

22

two approaches that have been suggested that -- that

23

have fewer problems than others.

24

And one -- if you begin with the question of

25

duty and say, what duties will suffice -- and I'm not -6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I'm not endorsing this; I'm simply saying it -- it pares

2

the covered duties back significantly to a point where

3

this Court might find it preferable to some other

4

approaches -- would be the one Your Honor mentioned,

5

criminal law duties, duties as to which the conduct

6

breached already is criminal.

7

There’s a subsidiary question, I think:

8

Whether, in fact, you might want to require felony

9

duties, because there are different penalties with

10

regard to different duties.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The real problem with

12

your approach, which I take it is you have to find these

13

duties in State law, is that some States will classify

14

the same conduct as a felony that another will classify

15

as a misdemeanor.

16

some States will make something criminal that other

17

States won't.

18

So that line won't work.

And then

So you’re going to have, depending on

19

geography, people potentially subject to a 20-year term

20

because of the particularities of -- of a -- the State

21

law.

22

MR. AYER:

I agree, Your Honor.

That is --

23

that is a problem with it.

And I am not -- I am not

24

here to endorse that as a satisfactory alternative.

25

simply saying it’s preferable to some of the others.

But you are asking us to

say State law is the reference.
MR. AYER:

No, Your Honor, I'm not.

I'm

4

asking the Court -- and that's a confusion in the

5

question presented.

6

government very clearly, and the trial court found, made

7

no attempt to produce anything other than 1346 as the

8

source of any Federal disclosure duty.

9

Federal disclosure duty that they could point to

The court -- the trial court ended up

12

focusing -- in fact, I'd like, if I could, to take a

13

couple of minutes on the procedure to establish sort of

14

the posture of this case, because I think it may

15

otherwise be confusing.

16

Essentially, what we had here was an

17

indictment that, when filed, in the vaguest of terms, it

18

alleged as the purpose -- and this is at joint appendix

19

page 35 -- the purpose of the scheme was for Company A

20

to agree to provide things of value to the Petitioner to

2

that, and in the course of doing that, they have -- it's

3

certainly open to them to show that the defendant didn't

4

specifically stand up and make an announcement that he

5

had submitted a job solicitation to Company A, as he had

6

submitted solicitations to a half a dozen other

7

employers, as is perfectly legal under Alaska law.

8

all of that is fair game.

9

And -- and they can do

So

But a few days before trial, what ended up

10

happening here -- and this is where this case comes

11

from.

12

and thereafter in a motion in limine dealing with

13

submission of evidence, the government announced that it

14

wanted to -- to pursue what it called -- what the trial

15

court called its alternative theory; frankly, we think,

16

because they couldn't prove their bribery case.

17

A few days before trial, first in a trial brief

theory.

17

evidence was exclusively to pursue this alternative

theory that all you needed to do was fail to disclose in

20

doing your job, you have committed honest services

And, indeed, the court said -- and the court of

Absolutely right, Your Honor.

And, in fact, if there is any doubt about that, all you

4

need to do is read at page 36a in the -- in the petition

5

appendix, where the court says exactly where the case

6

stands after his ruling.

7

He says at the end of his order, "This

8

leaves the United States to prove the honest services

fraud charges in this case based on violations of the

10

law other than a duty to disclose defendant's dealings

11

all of its wonderful dicta and -- and wild phrases about

this is even highly dubious; in fact, I think it’s

has said.

But -- but as -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

MR. AYER:

Well, that’s right.

MR. AYER:

13

what I'm understanding them to say now.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. AYER:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. AYER:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

So let's take it from

there.

18

22

I think that's what --

Okay.
Why is that --

Well, I think --- not a limiting

principle?
MR. AYER:

I think the -- the problem is

24

that if you -- if you ask the question in the context of

25

this pure nondisclosure theory, the materiality, as the
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

-- as the government articulated it here today and as I

2

think they have articulated it in their brief, was

3

whether it's reasonably likely to affect the decision of

4

the relevant whoever, the relevant person.

5

Now, as -- as Justice Breyer, I think,

6

indicated, it's very easy to talk about materiality when

7

you are talking about deception or concealment as a –-

8

as a method of doing someone out of another thing.

9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's -- it's much easier

in the public sector, I agree with you, to --

11

MR. AYER:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

the -- I'm sorry.

14

talk about.

15

But I'm -- but --- to talk about it in

In the private sector, it's easier to

MR. AYER:

But I'm talking -- I mean,

16

I -- I can -- I can well understand the concept of

17

bribery, say, where a public official has a duty to

18

award contracts to the lowest competent bidder, and

19

instead, he takes a bribe, and he awards the contract to

20

someone else.

21

easily that he has defrauded -- in those terms, he has

22

defrauded the public out of its right to have him do

23

that job.

24
25

He -- you know, I can accept the notion

The materiality of a nondisclosure in that
setting is -- is coherent in the context of what he did
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

wrong.

In other words, I hid the fact that I took a

2

bribe.

I took the money in cash.

3

freezer.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I put it in the

I’m not sure that --

5

that whether he did it with disclosure or nondisclosure,

6

what would make the nondisclosure more meaningful?

7

Meaning, it's taking the bribe, whether he discloses it

8

or not --

9

MR. AYER:

10

Well, but there are also --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- and if he gets up on

11

the floor of -- of the legislature and says:

12

I am going to vote for this bill because somebody paid

13

me money, he disclosed it.

14

better.

15

MR. AYER:

You know,

It doesn't make it any

Well, I don't know if it does or

16

not.

17

And if somebody actually does that openly, I don't know

18

if you can argue that he didn't -- that he didn't commit

19

fraud.

20

not something I have any interest in -- in promoting.

I mean, I guess there is a fraud requirement here.

But I don't want to push that, because that’s

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. AYER:

But, in -- in any event, he

23

certainly took a bribe.

But the -- but the point I am

24

making is that the nondisclosure, in the abstract --

25

and that's what the government is charging here -- is
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

impossible to evaluate the materiality of.

2
3

JUSTICE BREYER:

So --

No, I think they’re

saying -- which I am getting gradually --

4

MR. AYER:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

is:

7

that one.

8

deal with that one.

I'm sorry.
I think what he’s saying

First, we know what bribery is; we can deal with

9

Second, we know what kickbacks are; we can

And what he means by the honest services

10

other than that is, imagine a list of 5 million bits of

11

honest service that a workman has to perform for his

12

employer.

13

requirements to disclose something where the interest of

14

the employer goes -- employee goes the other way.

15

Now, on that list, there might be 35

And he's saying it violates the statute not

16

to do that in circumstances where the employee knows

17

that the failure to disclose will, in fact, lead the

18

employer, to whom he should have disclosed it, to make a

19

significant decision; namely, that decision to avoid

20

which was the reason he didn't disclose it.

21

MR. AYER:

Right.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, I think what he is

23

saying is that’s rather precise.

That fits with what

24

was there before, and therefore, all the government is

25

saying is:

Now we have those three things.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

If you

Official

1

didn't quite -- I didn't quite get that out of the

2

brief, but that may be my fault.

3

it was probably there; when I go back, I'll see it.

4

those are the three things.

5

So he's saying:

All right?

You see?

So anyway,
And

It doesn't matter

6

the source as long as there is a clear legal obligation,

7

which could come from corporation law, for the employee

8

to disclose the conflict in this situation.

9

that's what it is.

I think

10

Well, and so what's your response to that?

11

MR. AYER:

Well, I think -- I mean, I could

12

argue with that, but I don't need to, because our

13

principal submission, Your Honor, is that -- that we win

14

this case because there is no clear duty to disclose.

15

And we win it because --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

You are saying, I take it,

17

that there was no duty in Alaska criminal law,

18

disclosure law, to disclose.

19

a treatise on agency that there is a duty to disclose.

20

MR. AYER:

I think you might find in

Well, there is no Alaska law --

21

it’s absolutely clear and it is not disputed here.

22

23

Well, one of the things -- well,

2

the government certainly didn't offer anything other

3

than what it offered, and the court looked at it and the

4

court said there’s no duty -- he went through several

5

pages of saying there is no duty to disclose here, and

6

the government did not appeal.

7

challenge that.

The government said:

doesn't matter.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

I’m learning something

12

about the case that I didn't understand before.

13

agreeing that if there were a duty to disclose exactly

14

what happened in this case, that then the statute would

15

have been violated?

16

MR. AYER:

Are you

I'm not -- I'm not, Your Honor.

17

What I would do is bump the -- bump the inquiry to the

18

next level, which is where the Court was earlier today.

19

You then have to go to the question about what kinds of

20

duties would suffice.

21
22
23
24
25

My point is quite simple, and I don't think
it's evasive.

You must have some duty --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I thought you were arguing

that a duty to disclose could never qualify.
MR. AYER:

I -- well, I -- you could argue
18

that.

2

assume that.

4

I don't think -- you certainly don't need to

what your position is, not what you could argue.

Well, my position is that you

6

must have some duty, and there’s no duty here other than

7

1346.

And the question of

position is not that there be no duty to disclose; you

2

are saying there is not a duty to disclose of sufficient

3

moment to justify criminal penalties.

4

MR. AYER:

I -- I don't -- that's one way to

5

say it, sufficient moment, or of a character that makes

6

it appropriate.

7

I would say this:

I think if the Court were

8

to go down the road and think in terms of, well, the

9

duties need to be criminal, and if they are criminal,

10

then they at least are duties that the entity that

11

created them -- it's (a) a government entity, it's a

12

government norm, it has criminal consequences, and that

13

-- that government body thought this conduct was

14

important enough to give criminal penalties to, maybe –-

15

I don't -- I can't judge this, but maybe the Court would

16

look at that and say:

17

comfortable with thinking that Congress, with these

18

wonderful 28 words, actually meant to make the breach of

19

that criminal duty punishable under this statute.

20

question that the government rewrote and the Court

the government made no effort to come up with a Federal

MR. AYER:

Well, Your Honor, I think -- I

think this is the situation -- it’s certainly true --

general proposition that you don't take a Federal

statute and just leap off and start applying State law

norms.

But -- but when the inherent nature of the
statute, like this one, which says -- we’re talking
24
Alderson Reporting Company

about public officials; mostly we’re talking about

2

State officials; we’re talking about rights, and

3

therefore, we’re talking about duties -- most of the

5

duties, most of the legal duties that a State official

owes are State law duties.

Plus, we are talking about the Federal
government, the Federal criminal statute, injecting

10

itself into the relationship of State officials with

11

their citizens and their government.

12

that you -- you know, there's the De Sylva case from

13

1956, there's the Kamen case, the Brosnan case -- these

14

are all cases where the Court has recognized a

15

sensitivity about there are times when it makes sense

16

to look to, or at least consider as one of the elements,

17

State law norms.

18

And so the notion

And that's really all we are saying here, is

19

that State law rules, perhaps, could be sufficient.

20

I want to just emphasize, again, we are not here -- I’m

21

-- I’m less helpful to you than perhaps I should be, but

22

we have a case to argue.

23

But

And our case should win on the simple ground

24

that the government has cited no real direct, you

25

know, disclosure obligation.

All they have cited, and

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

all they want to rely on, are the words of 1346.

2

Now, that violates this Court's clear

3

statement rule, going in and messing around with

4

Alaska's existing rules of when you have to disclose and

5

when you don't.

6
7

Can Congress really have thought about that
and meant to do that?

8
9

I'm sure not.

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if there's a statute

that prohibits a legislator from engaging in certain

10

conduct and attaches a significant penalty to it, but

11

there is no statute that requires the disclosure of the

12

conduct?

13

MR. AYER:

Well, there's -- there's an

14

argument to be made that the -- that the government

15

could pursue, and I don't want to say they could, but if

16

it's a criminal statute, there’s an argument the

17

government could pursue their case on that theory.

18

It's not a disclosure theory.

It's a theory

19

about -- you know, it's like a bribe.

21

fraudulently did X -JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me give you this

23

example:

Take the Judge Holzer case we all know about.

24

Suppose, in 49 States, it always violates State law, but

25

there’s some State that has a special rule that, unless
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the bribery exceeds $1,000, there’s no violation.

2

Would -- could he be prosecuted in the 49th State?

3

MR. AYER:

Well, I think -- the first thing

4

I want to say is that I think that is counterfactual,

5

and they were talking about bribery.

6

basically flatly illegal in every State.

MR. AYER:

Bribery is

But if it's not illegal

If it's not illegal --- in the State I'm asking

you about?

11

MR. AYER:

If it's not illegal, then I would

12

say that there has to be -- the conduct he engaged in

13

must be illegal under some law or it -- he didn't breach

14

a duty.

JUSTICE STEVENS:
Alaska law, then?

20
21

It does not have to be

MR. AYER:
law.

I'm sorry?
In this case, it does not

It wouldn't have to be Alaska

It has got to be some law, and it can't be 1346.
The other problem with it, I want to say

22
23

quickly and then sit down, is -- is this is making

24

Federal common law.

25

saying:

This is courts coming in and

You must disclose this and this and this, in
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these circumstances and not in those.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But I'm just trying -- if

3

it's -- it’s illegal in 47 States, but not in the State

4

in which the prosecution is brought, you say the Federal

5

rule could not apply?

6

MR. AYER:

I would say that -- that -- yes,

7

that is my answer.

And my answer is that because what

8

you have to find is that this person breached a duty.

9

If what he did was perfectly legal under the State law

10

where he was, just hypothetical -- hard to imagine -- if

11

he's committing bribery.

12

reality, but if that were true, he hasn't violated any

13

duty there.

14

Hard to imagine.

Not true in

Is there a Federal duty that that act of

15

taking a bribe violates?

16

can prosecute it, and if there is not, then you can't.

17

And what I'm saying is, you can't make up a duty out of

18

28 words in 1346.
If I could reserve the rest of my time, Your

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

It's good to be back.

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. DREEBEN:

The one thing that I think the

4

parties, the cases, and this Court, in its description

5

of section 1346 in Cleveland, agree on is that the

6

purpose of the statute was to restore at least some part

7

of the pre-McNally doctrine of intangible rights.

8
9

It, therefore, makes sense to take a look at
the theory of intangible rights violation that Mr. Ayer

very ably argued for the government when he argued the

11

McNally case.

20

did.

21

One thing that

So before we get to your larger theory of

22

anything, we have a particular case to deal with.

23

have an Assistant U.S. Attorney who came to the judge

24

and said, we have alternate theories of this case.

25

is the quid pro quo theory; the other -- and I am
29
Alderson Reporting Company

We

One

Official

1

reading from 42 of the appendix -- is that "a public

2

official can be found guilty of honest services fraud,

3

irrespective of whether the public official took any act

4

thereafter."

5
6

Just the bare nondisclosure.

That was what the Assistant U.S. Attorney
was asking for.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

That's what the document that

8

you are reading from said, Justice Ginsburg.

9

later, the government filed a clarification of its -- of

10

its position in response to Petitioner's briefing of the

11

issue, and this appears at pages 68 and 69 of the joint

12

appendix.

13

One week

And in that filing, the government made

14

clear that its theory, consistent with the theory that I

15

am arguing here today, is that when the legislator takes

16

official action having an undisclosed conflict of

17

interest, that's when he violates the honest services

18

statute under the nondisclosure theory.

19

We are not here to urge that there is a

20

general duty of disclosure that is separate and apart

21

from any official act that the official takes.

22

not here to argue that there’s a free-standing Federal

23

duty of disclosure that applies in all cases, regardless

24

of the other elements of the mail fraud statute.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We are

Then you must agree that

the Ninth Circuit was wrong, at least in this

2

particular -- this -- I'm now reading from 19a.

bribe, and that's -- everyone seems to agree that that

4

could come within the statute.

5
6

One is

The second is (2) nondisclosure of
material information.

7

Period.

MR. DREEBEN:

That's got to be wrong.

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

8

think that’s -- that’s a shorthand summary of the

9

nondisclosure theory.

The more accurate summary of the

10

government's theory is on page 20a, on the first full

11

paragraph that begins with the bracketed 9.

12

And it says, "Here, Weyhrauch allegedly

13

voted and took other official acts on legislation at the

14

direction of VECO while engaged in undisclosed

15

negotiations for future legal work from VECO."

16

And then it goes on to say, "These

17

allegations describe an undisclosed conflict of interest

18

and could also support an inference of a quid pro quo.”

19

Furthermore, Petitioner

20

--

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

I have been

21

trying to find out what you were referring to on pages

22

68 to 69.

23

MR. DREEBEN:

On the bottom of page 68,

24

Justice Scalia, there’s a italicized word, "first."

25

And it describes -31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

-- the more detailed theory

3

that the government is elaborating, and then on page 69,

4

it says, quote, "By introducing amendments to and voting

5

on legislation that each defendant knew would affect

6

Company A, an entity with whom each defendant either had

7

or was negotiating for a financial relationship, each

8

defendant knowingly breached that duty of disclosure."

9

So I think the government tied up the

10

nondisclosure to the official act and that the Ninth

11

Circuit was not under an incorrect impression about

12

that.

13

believe it's in footnote 6 of his opening brief -- that

14

that's not the issue before the Court, how to instruct

15

the jury on the duty of disclosure.

And more fundamentally, Petitioner says -- I

16

That's an issue that will arise, and I think

17

Petitioner's counsel said this to the district court --

18

it's in a page of the joint appendix that I don't have

19

at my fingertips -- that's a matter for jury

20

instructions.

And we agree.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

But this is an opinion

22

that’s going to govern district judges in the Ninth

23

Circuit.

24

nondisclosure of material information certainly is not

25

enough --

So I take it that your answer is that

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. DREEBEN:

No, it's not enough, Justice

2

Ginsburg, not standing alone.

3

takes action that furthers his undisclosed interest

4

without telling the decision-making body to which he

5

belongs that he becomes a fraud.

6

It's when the official

It's just like O'Hagan, Justice Ginsburg.

7

When O'Hagan, the lawyer, took the information from his

8

firm, posed as a loyal employee, the partner who comes

9

to work every day just doing his job, it became a fraud

10

when he took that information and used it in his own

11

securities trading.

12

Here, too, this is not a pure nondisclosure

theory.

code to separate the things that have to be disclosed

they are just too common?

15

MR. DREEBEN:

You -- you could do it that

16

way, Justice Alito, but the way that the mail fraud

17

statute does it is it looks for the kind of personal

18

conflicting financial interest that, in the universal

19

view of the common law, raised a problem.

20

Those are interests that are different from

21

the public at large and that are not widely held by a

22

large segment of the community.

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that when we are

fiduciaries.

But to answer most directly, Justice Breyer, your

violating a standard stated as I have just stated it,

first of all, that he knew that he was breaching a legal

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Sotomayor, what

18

I am trying to say to this Court this morning is that

19

what 1346 reinstated was the notion that if fiduciaries

20

have a duty not to further their own personal

21

conflicting financial interests by taking official

22

action, it becomes a Federal crime only when there is

23

both materiality and intent to defraud.

24
25

And to prove the intent to defraud element
that the individual intended to deprive the citizens of

1

their right of honest services, the government has to

2

know -- show that he knew he was breaching a fiduciary

3

duty.

4

evidence, for example, that State law precluded the

5

action that he took -- the underlying action in this

6

case by Mr. Weyhrauch was prohibited by State law.

And the government can do that by offering

So, now -- now think of

that answer -- complete that answer, if you can.
MR. DREEBEN:

He did it in violation of a

19

State substantive duty, and the government's burden

20

will be to show he knew he was acting wrongfully.

And often we will do that by pointing to State law and

saying he violated State law or he violated an ethics

Before McNally, there was a body of case law

critical and important context.

fiduciaries.

interests at the expense of the government who you

23

serve.

24
25

If you look at the

The core obligation of a fiduciary is the

That core understanding of the duty of
loyalty informed the honest services cases that arose in
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the courts of appeals, and for the most part, they

2

involved, as their core set of violations, bribes, in

3

which somebody is selling his office, so he’s clearly

4

not serving the public; kickbacks, where the individual

5

is profiting at the expense of the government,

6

oftentimes in his official capacity, and sometimes not

7

profiting at the expense of the government, because the

8

government couldn't be harmed in a pecuniary way by the

9

kickback; and undisclosed conflicts of interest when the

10

official takes action to further that interest.

that the Court has recognized -- and it has done so most

prominently in the Sherman Act and in the civil rights

15

statutes, 18 U.S.C., Section 241 and 242, that these are

16

broad statutes with general language, and in order to be

made susceptible of criminal punishment, you need two

things.

19

You need clarifying judicial decisions that

articulate the rights, and you need a standard of

scienter that will allow the government to convict only

22

those people who are on fair notice and act with a --

the bad purpose --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Number one, I am -- I am

I mean, this is an area unto itself, and,

2

number two, the Sherman Act explicitly --

3

"explicitly" -- clearly confers upon courts a common

4

law, a common law ability to define the crime.

5

And that doesn't appear from this statute.

6

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I wasn't citing the

7

Sherman Act as an example of formulating a common law of

8

crimes, but there is only one Due Process Clause,

9

Justice Scalia, so if it is constitutional to prosecute

10

under the civil rights statutes and under the Sherman

11

Act, then it is constitutional for this Court to divine

12

from the pre-McNally case law principles and to

13

articulate them.

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. DREEBEN:

Let me -- let me just mention,

24

in the civil rights area, it may not answer your

25

concerns, Justice Scalia, but I think the Court should
45
Alderson Reporting Company

1

know that, in the United States v. Kozminski, the Court

2

recognized -- and I am going to quote here -- that,

3

"Congress intended the statute to incorporate, by

4

reference, a large body of potentially evolving federal

5

law."

6

And the Court recognized that that was a

7

dilemma because you cannot have citizens criminally

8

prosecuted for evolving law of which the citizens have

9

no notice.

And the Court's response was to say that,

10

when the right has been made specific by a decision of

11

this Court and there’s the requisite level of scienter,

12

there is no due process problem in prosecuting --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There’s no such thing as a

14

vague law, so long as this Court says, oh, what the

15

law -- the law -- it’s absolutely unclear what the law

16

means, so long as this Court says, oh, we think the law

means -- what do you want to pick -- bribery, then --

It's been shaped by the

The problem is that --

8

that, even if the U.S. attorney got it right in the end,

9

if the U.S. attorney could think that all that's

10

involved is nondisclosure, even if no action is taken

11

thereafter, the U.S. attorney could write that down

12

twice, that suggests that this statute is open to a high

13

degree of interpretation.

14

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

15

don't think that the Court should decide whether

16

Congress validly accepted this Court's invitation to

17

reinstate an important public corruption principle by

18

looking to what one United States attorney, one set of

19

federal prosecutors said in a pleading that was filed on

20

very short notice and that was --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it's -- it's not --

22

it's not just one.

One of the briefs in one or the

23

other of these cases describes the great variety of

24

“pushing the envelope” prosecutions that the Justice

25

Department has, indeed, pursued, and they are all over
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

the place.

2

And if the Justice Department can't figure

3

out what -- what is embraced by this statute, I don't

4

know how you can expect the average citizen to figure it

5

out.

6

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, this body of law evolved

That doesn't mean that the statute is vague.

because the courts of appeals were divided on whether

I think that it's the role of this Court and

21

the -- within the proper disposition of this Court's

22

authority to attempt to figure out what Congress did,

23

and then to implement it in accordance with doctrines

24

that are standard tools of the trade here -- rule of

25

lenity, concerns about federalism -- and recognize that
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there is a core that Congress was looking at in the pre-

2

McNally cases, and that that core can be implemented

3

consistent with concerns about notice and clarity of

4

definition, without either creating a statute that is

5

totally freeform or without invalidating Congress's

6

effort to respond to the Court's invitation in McNally.

7

And, if I could turn to the question

8

presented in this case, which is whether State law

9

duties need to be violated, State law disclosure

10

obligations need to be violated in order to sustain a

11

valid mail fraud prosecution.

12

The pre-McNally cases and McNally itself

13

answers that because, in the McNally decision, this

14

Court acknowledged that the government's theory of

15

prosecution was that McNally and his cohorts were

16

accepting kickbacks in the form of commissions on

17

insurance contracts.

18

And the courts recognized that the

19

government's theory was they failed to disclose their

20

interest to persons in State government who were in a

21

position to take action with respect to that

22

information.

23

And the Court specifically said:

We should

24

assume that there was no violation of any State law

25

obligations in holding those interests or no violation
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

of any State law duty to disclose.
That was the theory of prosecution that the

3

Court recognized the government was pursuing, and it was

4

entirely consistent with the pre-McNally cases, Mandel

5

and Margiotta, which were repeatedly cited in the

6

legislative history.

7

And I won't take the Court's time to read

8

language -- we’ve cited it in our brief -- where those

9

cases clearly said no State law duty was required to be

10
11

breached in order to state a prosecution.
There is still protection in this statute

12

against prosecutions of citizens without notice because,

13

as I said earlier, the government has to prove a

14

violation of the duty to disclose by the officials

15

taking action to further his undisclosed personal

16

interest, and the citizen cannot be prosecuted and

17

convicted without the government being able to show that

18

he knew that he was violating a duty to disclose.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, let me ask a quick

20

question here.

21

first question is whether the statute requires the

22

government to prove the defendant's conduct was intended

23

to achieve private gain, et cetera, and if not, whether

24

the statute is unconstitutionally vague.

25

I notice, in the Skilling case, the

Now, does that first question give the

wants in its brief about the constitutional question?

And I don't –- the

11

government is not shying away from the question of

12

vagueness.

13

members of this Court as a legitimate concern.

14

I think it's a legitimate concern.

The question of vagueness has been raised by

That is

15

why the government has offered to this Court a theory

16

based on the prototypical and paradigm pre-McNally cases

intangible rights that we want to protect.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, even --

State laws prohibit -Even after he

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, where does the

7

MR. DREEBEN:

I think it says it,

8

Mr. Chief Justice, by looking at the body of case law

that involved violations of the right of honest services

10

and seeing that that's what the government was after,

11

personal conflicting financial interests.

And this is not a subtle or obscure

principle of fiduciary law -- if I might finish my last

sentence.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

This is a bedrock principle of

17

the common law that exists in all 50 States, and the

18

mistake that the lower courts made in the pre-McNally

19

era was in thinking that the mail fraud statute

20

protected it, but there was no obscurity whatever that

21

the fiduciaries owe an obligation of undivided loyalty

22

to their principal.

That's what this statute is about.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3
4

MR. AYER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I have

four quick points I'd like to make.

5

The first one is that McNally is a case --

6

there were issues about the jury instructions, but the

7

basic fact pattern was clear.

8

It was illegal under the Kentucky constitution.

9

no question that if it were charged properly, it

It was a kickback scheme.
There’s

10

could be convicted, and that's clear I think at page 11

11

of our yellow brief.

12

The second point I want to make is that this

13

talk about whether or not Petitioner violated the

14

statute about voting when he was in negotiations --

15

number one, the first answer to that is the government

16

is perfectly free to prove that case if they want to;

17

that's not before the Court.

18

different theory that they can pursue.

19

disclosure theory.

20

That's -- that's a
It's not the

But just by the way, he didn't violate it,

21

and the reason he didn't violate it, particularly in

22

light of what Mr. Dreeben has said -- first of all we

23

don't think he was in negotiations.

24

There was never an offer either way.

25

negotiations, and that's been something that has been

He sent a letter.
There weren't

2

Secondly, he voted; when he voted he

3

actually ended up voting twice on the bill in a form

4

that -- that VECO didn't want.

5

learned today -- and this is all, you know, shifting

6

sands -- that he has to have voted for the -- the way

7

that the conflicting interest would have had him vote.

So he actually -- and I

right to.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You're saying that you’ll

12

win on the facts, not the theory.

13

MR. AYER:

14
15
16

They have every

Yes.

Yes, and they have the

right -JUSTICE STEVENS:

But that’s not what we

have to decide.

17

MR. AYER:

18

And -- and the third point I want to make is

-- to pursue it.

19

-- is that there is absolutely no doubt about this

20

question with regard to what -- what the issue was in

21

the court below.

22

references to the -- and I’ll read them very quickly.

23

But 23a -- these are all the district court opinion:

24

23a, the district court says he is dealing with the more

25

general proposition -- the government's more general

And I would simply direct a few

59
Alderson Reporting Company

1

proposition -- that honest services fraud may be proved

2

by showing a violation of the duty to disclose.

3

29a, the district court says “the proposition advanced

4

by the United States, that honest services may be proved

5

by establishing that a public official knowingly

6

concealed a conflict of interest,” period.

7

Then on

Then, on 36a, at the end the court says, you

8

can bring any other theory you want other than the

9

nondisclosure theory.

Now, did the government object?

10

Did the government at any time say, oh, no, that's not

11

our theory?

12

that's the theory they argued on appeal in the Ninth

13

Circuit.

14

Circuit talked about when it has these two forms of core

15

conduct, one of which is -- is the conduct about failing

16

to disclose material information, period.

17

anything else, just failing to disclose material

18

information re a conflict.

No.

They didn't; they adopted that, and

And that's exactly the theory that the Ninth

Not in doing

19

Finally, the government in this Court has

20

itself argued the case in a way that I think concedes

21

the point.

22

at the main heading in their brief on page 13, their

23

point is -- they finally say this, and then I think they

24

contradict themselves elsewhere, but they say in their

25

heading a "State official's violation of the honest

We might then say the theory that they described there
