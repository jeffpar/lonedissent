Mr. Frederick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
In 1970, Congress amended the Investment

12

Company Act to provide a cause of action when an

13

investment adviser breaches its fiduciary duty with

14

respect to compensation.

15

The Seventh Circuit upheld summary judgment

16

for Respondent under a legal standard for fiduciary duty

17

that Respondent here no longer defends.

18

For three reasons, the Seventh Circuit's

19

judgment should be reversed.

20

longstanding precedent, in this context a fiduciary duty

21

requires a fair fee, achieved through full disclosure

22

and good-faith negotiation.

23

First, under the Court's

Second, the best gauge of a fair fee is what

24

the investment adviser charges at arm's-length in other

25

transactions for similar services.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And, third, applying that standard here,

2

Harris charged twice as much in percentage terms for

3

providing virtually identical advisory services in

4

arm's-length transactions with institutional investors.

5

With respect to the first point, the

6

standard for fiduciary duty has been clear from this

7

Court's cases, at least since Pepper v. Litton, in which

8

the Court said that a fair result in the

9

circumstances -- a fair fee -- was an important

10

component of a fiduciary duty.

11

Congress was aware of that standard when it

12

enacted the 1970 amendments to the Investment Company

13

Act.

14

attention, and that standard, we submit, is one that

15

Congress intended to incorporate.

The SEC brought the case to the Congress'

16

Applying that standard, where Pepper said

17

that the best gauge of a fair fee is what the person -

18

the fiduciary charges in arm's-length transactions,

19

applied here, the best way to understand how that

20

fiduciary duty is being breached in this context is what

21

Harris is charging for same or similar services at

22

arm's-length to institutional investors.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is Harris a fiduciary in

24

the same sense as a corporate officer and a corporate

25

director?

Or does his fiduciary duty differ?
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Is it

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

higher or lower, same with a guardian, same with a

2

trustee?

3

I mean, the word "fiduciary" -- does

4

fiduciary imply different standards, depending on what

5

kind of fiduciary you are?

6

MR. FREDERICK:

The basic concept,

7

Justice Kennedy, is the same.

There are two components,

8

where there must be full disclosure of information and a

9

fair result, and that fair result translates in

10

different contexts in different ways.

Here, because of

11

the statutory references to fiduciary duty with respect

12

to compensation, one focuses on the fairness of the fee

13

charged.

14

But, as Professor Dumont points out in her

15

amicus brief, the idea of a fiduciary duty is one that

16

is well known in various circumstances of the law, and

17

as applied here the concept goes to the fairness of the

18

fee.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, would the test for

20

compensation in this case be the same as any director or

21

any officer of a corporation?

22

MR. FREDERICK:

The difference here, Justice

23

Kennedy, is that in those circumstances the indicia of

24

an arm's-length transaction may be achieved.

25

directors can fire the head of a company.

Here, the investment adviser has appointed

3

the members of the board.

4

Daily Income Fund case, the earmarks of an -- of an

5

arm's-length transaction are absent precisely because -

6

As this Court said in the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I just want to know, is

7

the fiduciary duties the same?

8

standard the same, without getting into how its applied?

9

Is the fiduciary

Is the fiduciary standard the same for

10

Jones, for a guardian, for a trustee, for a corporate

11

officer or a corporate director, always the same?

12

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

The concept is fair

14

negotiations.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. FREDERICK:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

And for lawyers?
For lawyers Lawyers have a fiduciary

obligation to their clients; right?

19

MR. FREDERICK:

That is true.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So courts should review

21

lawyers' fees for -- on the basis of whether it's a fair

22

result.

23

MR. FREDERICK:

That is how courts do it

24

every day in this country, Justice Scalia, when they are

25

asked to make fee applications for reasonableness.

So why wouldn't you review the lawyers' fees

I mean, this is part of an expense of a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel for the

fund.
MR. FREDERICK:

Counsel for the fund is -

14

that is actually not at issue here, but the issue of

15

what constitutes reasonable expenses may arise in

16

various circumstances.

17

The statute prohibits fees that are

18

unreasonable in terms of their unfairness to the fund.

19

The concept here is that the board cannot fire the

20

investment adviser.

21

the fee the adviser is charging the fund, the normal

22

indicia of an arm's-length transaction is absent, and

23

that is the key principle here because this adviser is

24

using the same manager to provide the same research

25

analytics from the same research group, from the same

So in evaluating the fairness of

meetings, buying the same stocks, and simply allocating

2

them to different accounts and charging those to whom it

3

owes a fiduciary duty twice what it is getting at

4

arm's-length.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there was in this

6

record, was there not, a submission by the adviser

7

comparing what mutual funds this fund was charged, what

8

institutional funds were charged, but explaining the

9

differential in terms of the services provided, that

10

more services were provided to the fund and less

11

services were provided to the institutional investors.

12

MR. FREDERICK:

And, Justice Ginsburg, that

13

is where there is a disputed issue of fact for which

14

summary judgment is not appropriate, because the

15

plaintiffs submitted evidence that in fact the services

16

provided to the institutional investors were greater,

17

even though they were being charged a lower amount of

18

money.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Who would have the

20

burden?

You said that is an issue that has not been

21

decided, it's a disputed issue of fact, appropriate for

22

remand.

23

forward and said, look, this is what our situation is.

24

These are the services.

25

show that in fact they were comparable and the

Who -- would you have the burden if they came

Would you have the burden to

2

MR. FREDERICK:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

Yes.
You would have the

burden?

5

MR. FREDERICK:

We have the burden.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

normal trust law, isn't it?

8

MR. FREDERICK:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's different from

It is.
Normally where you are a

10

fiduciary, it's up to you to prove that it was

11

reasonable.

12

MR. FREDERICK:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14
15

That's true.
So Congress evidently did

not mean ordinary trust law to apply in this context.
MR. FREDERICK:

We disagree with that last

16

part, Justice Scalia.

17

modifications to the way a cause of action ordinarily

18

would have been brought at common law for breach of

19

fiduciary duty in several respects, including imposing

20

the burden of proof on the investor.

21

is that when they used the phrase "fiduciary duty" they

22

intended to mean something less than what fiduciary duty

23

had meant at common law.

24
25

We agree that Congress did make

MR. FREDERICK:

How is the court

Well, there is an issue of

8

fact as to how relevant performance is.

They didn't

9

give the money back when their performance lagged behind

10

the market, Mr. Chief Justice, in this case.

11

question of whether or not a performance metric is

12

relevant is certainly a factor that will be entitled to

13

less -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the

Well, surely you

15

think it is.

16

back, you are not suggesting that the amount of the fees

17

should be the same regardless of whether they outperform

18

by 10 percent or not?

19

When you say they don't give the money

MR. FREDERICK:

My point, Mr. Chief Justice,

20

is that when they charge the same amount, buying the

21

same stocks, to institutional investors and achieve the

22

same performance, there is no reason why the mutual fund

23

should be charged twice as much.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but there is

different parameters, right, in the sense that you're
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

trying -- the company is trying to attract investors to

2

the mutual fund.

3

is not the case that they are trying to attract

4

pensioners who have other choices.

5

If you are advising a pension fund, it

MR. FREDERICK:

But the investor doesn't

6

gain because of the marketing skill of the adviser.

7

Simply having a larger asset pool which increases the

8

fee that the adviser can charge doesn't inure to the

9

individual benefit of the investor.

And the point of

10

this statute was to provide protection against investors

11

so that when the adviser charged excessive fees that

12

excess would be returned to the fund for the pro

13

rata benefit -

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You said that Congress

15

used "fiduciary" in a special sense.

Then -- then, I

16

have to conclude that your earlier answer is confusing

17

for me, because I thought you were going to tell us that

18

this investment adviser has the same fiduciary standard

19

that officers and directors of corporations have.

20

you say that Congress used it in this special sense.

21

that doesn't quite square.

22

MR. FREDERICK:

Then
So

Well, Justice Kennedy, let

23

me just add the extra words of the statute, because what

24

Congress said was a fiduciary duty "with respect to

25

compensation."

And so when I say special sense, I mean
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that Congress used additional words to elaborate on the

2

circumstance in which the fiduciary duty would be

3

examined.

4

Here what is happening is that an

5

arm's-length transaction for the same services -- the

6

same manager is going out and touting his services to

7

the institutional investor, but simply charging them

8

half as much money for providing the same portfolio of

9

management.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do technological

11

changes make a difference in terms of disclosures

12

required?

13

button and you find out exactly what the management fees

14

are.

15

it's right there and you can make -- as an investor you

16

can make whatever determination you'd like, including to

17

take your money out.

18

These days all you have to do is push a

I mean, you just look it up on Morningstar and

MR. FREDERICK:

The fact that an investor

19

may know going in what the fee is does not address the

20

problem Congress was intending to address, which is that

21

as larger and larger sums of assets were accreted to the

22

mutual fund, the investor was not obtaining the benefits

23

of economies of scale.

24
25

And that's the central point -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So we could look

at -- you know, as the fund grows bigger and he doesn't

get those benefits he can go look at another fund.

2

takes 30 seconds.

3

MR. FREDERICK:

It

And that again doesn't

4

address the problem Congress was trying to get at, which

5

is to protect the company, not the individual investor.

6

The individual investor might lessen the damages that

7

that investor suffers, but the fund, the people

8

remaining, continue to pay excessive fees.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, but he protects the

10

company ultimately, because when investors leave the

11

company that is charging excessive fees to go to other

12

companies, the company that they are leaving sees that

13

something's wrong and has to lower its compensation to

14

its adviser.

15

issue?

16

Why doesn't that affect the company at

MR. FREDERICK:

A large number of assets

17

under management in mutual funds, something like 26 to

18

35 percent according to materials that are in the

19

record, are from 401(k) plans, where the investor is

20

essentially locked into the fund that his or her company

21

chooses to make that investment.

22

tax consequences where over time an investor might be in

MR. FREDERICK:

It happens all the time.
And Mr. Chief Justice, as

8

the Court recognized in the Daily Income Fund case, this

9

is a unique cause of action in which Congress was

10

intending to protect the entire corpus of the investors

11

in the fund, because -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You told me just a

13

little while ago, or told somebody, Congress wasn't

14

interested in protecting investors; they were interested

15

in protecting the companies.

16

MR. FREDERICK:

The company is comprised of

the investors, Mr. Chief Justice.

10

Thank you, counsel.

AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. GANNON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The fiduciary duty imposed by section 36(b)

11

prohibits an investment adviser's fee from being outside

12

the range that arm's-length bargaining would produce.

13

The courts below erred by failing to consider evidence

14

about what the investment adviser in this case charges

15

its unaffiliated clients when it provides services that

16

Petitioners claim are, in fact, comparable to the

17

services at issue here.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you think Congress used

19

the term "fiduciary" in a very special sense here?

20

will just tell you the problem I'm having with the case.

21

If I look at a standard that the fees must be reasonable

22

and I compare that with what a fiduciary would do, I

23

thought a fiduciary has the highest possible duty.

24

apparently the submission is the fiduciary has a lower

25

duty, a lesser duty than to charge a reasonable fee.
18
Alderson Reporting Company

I

But

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

just find that quite a puzzling use of the word

2

"fiduciary."

3
4

Now, if Congress uses it as a term of art or
in some special sense, fine.

5

MR. GANNON:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it seems to me an odd

7

use of the term "fiduciary."

I don't know why Congress

8

didn't use some other word.

9

MR. GANNON:

Well, we do think that -

Well, we do think that the term

10

"fiduciary duty" is here used to counterbalance the lack

11

of arm's-length bargaining that exists between the board

12

of directors and the investment adviser, and we do think

13

that it drew upon the established term of art in

14

Pepper v. Litton, the case that counsel for Petitioners

15

was already referring to.

16

involved corporate directors and there the same test,

17

the same ultimate standard, was stated, which is whether

18

the bargain carries the earmarks of an arm's length

19

bargain and whether it's inherently fair.

20

That's a case that actually

And so we do think that in the development

21

of the legislation in 1969, the memorandum that the SEC

submitted to Congress in 1969 explained that the shift

from reasonableness to fiduciary duty largely achieved

some procedural objectives of shifting the focus from

the board of directors to the investment adviser, and

1

the text of the statute specifically makes it a

2

fiduciary duty with respect to receipt of compensation.

3

We think one salutary affect of that was to

4

-- to make it clear that the Court's burden here, the

5

Court's duty here, wasn't just to establish what the

6

single most reasonable fee would be, but harking back to

7

the Pepper v. Litton test, whether the bargain fell

8

within the range of what arm's length bargaining

9

otherwise would have achieved.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, if we are

11

going to have regulation of what fees can be charged,

12

you cite in your brief the various regulations the SEC

13

has issued.

It makes a lot more sense to have the SEC

make more sense, Mr. Chief Justice.

17

that Congress made here was to counterbalance the -

the SEC has the authority to file suits under section

It hasn't filed any since 20

better education to shareholders so that they would be

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think that the SEC in

they charge to other clients.

It is aware of that.

think that this is indeed a self-contained industry and

22

that the comparison with investment advice given to

23

other entities is -- is not a fair one.

24
25

But that suggests to me that the SEC may

MR. GANNON:

Well, when the SEC helped draft

the statute in the 1960s, it recognized that there was
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this systematic disparity between the amounts that

2

mutual funds were being charged by investment advisers

3

and the amounts that investment advisers were charging

4

their unaffiliated clients, and in the 1969 memorandum

5

that I referred to, which is reprinted in an appendix to

6

the amicus brief by John Bogel in its entirety, the SEC

7

mentioned that comparison as being something that may

8

well be relevant in proving in an individual case that

9

that particular investment adviser's fees are excessive.

10

And we think that the test here of whether

11

under all the circumstances, which is what section

12

36(b)(2) points the Court towards, of having to weigh -

13

having to weigh the board's approval of fees in light of

14

all the circumstances, that those circumstances include

15

things like the evidence that petitioners have presented

16

here.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Gannon, the -- all

18

the circumstances, that comes from the Second Circuit's

19

Gartenberg case?

20
21
22

MR. GANNON:

Well, it also comes,

Justice Ginsburg, from the text of section 36(b)(2).
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in -- in that case,

23

at least there was a footnote that seemed to say, you

24

don't have to engage in a -- in the comparison with what

25

institutional investors are paid.
22
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. GANNON:

The footnote that you are

2

talking about did point out that in that case the

3

comparison that the plaintiffs were attempting to draw

4

between the money market fund at issue and a pension

5

fund wasn't a particularly relevant one, because the

6

services at issue were so different.

7

parties appear to dispute how different the services

8

are.

9

stated that it disputed how comparable the relevant

10

And here the

services were.

11

The district court and the court of appeals

12

considered that dispute immaterial because, instead of

13

comparing, instead of determining whether this

14

investment adviser is selling the same services at half

15

the price to its unaffiliated clients who actually can

16

engage in arm's length bargaining, those courts simply

17

said that if it -- if it falls within the range that is

18

charged by other mutual funds, that would be acceptable.

19

And we -

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, the statute

21

does not say, in considering the rates you look at all

22

the circumstances.

23

whether to defer to the board, you look at all the

24

circumstances.

25

Am I right?

MR. GANNON:

It says, in considering

It does say that you should

give the board -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

MR. GANNON:

The board.

-- such consideration as is

4

deemed appropriate under all the circumstances.

5

correct.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

That's

But isn't

7

that different than saying, in looking at what the rates

8

should be or whether they are excessive, you look at all

9

the circumstances?

It may well be that you don't defer

10

to the board, but that doesn't mean it's a free-for-all

11

in deciding what you do look at.

12

MR. GANNON:

Well, I think that it

13

demonstrates that the Court is obligated to look to all

14

the circumstances simply to determine whether the

15

board's approval -- how much weight it should be given.

16

And as this Court explained in Daily Income

17

Fund, the entire point of section 36(b) is to provide an

18

independent check, the -- independent of the fact that

19

the directors approved the fees.

20

appropriately informed board that asks the right

21

questions, that gets the right information and fully

22

considers the sort of factors that are discussed -

23
24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We think that an

Even if they agree to

pay double the price?
MR. GANNON:

We think that -- that the right
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

process followed by the board would be probative, but

2

something like double the price may -- may demonstrate

3

that that is an unfair bargain.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That -- that's what -

5

are you advocating that there is a stand-alone cause of

6

action or breach of duty when there isn't full

7

disclosure, even if the fee is within arm's length -

8

normal -- begging the question of what's normal, but

9

assuming that it's within an arm's-length transaction

10
11

range in the market?
MR. GANNON:

If there was a lack of full

12

disclosure, that might in the abstract be a breach of

13

fiduciary duty even under the Seventh Circuit's test.

14

We think that if it didn't actually have an effect on

15

the fees, then it wouldn't be actionable here because

16

there would be no actual damages flowing from the lack

17

of disclosure.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But even if there is full

19

disclosure, your position is in every case a court must

20

decide whether the fee is reasonable or not.

21

MR. GANNON:

A court would need to decide

22

whether the plaintiff has met its burden of proving that

23

it falls outside the range of fees that arm's-length

24

bargaining would have arrived at, and that's a cause of

25

action that would be 25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, how much deviance,

2

and what is the scope of the range?

3

MR. GANNON:

Well, I think that the term of

4

art of "fiduciary duty" doesn't necessarily demonstrate

5

how much deviance away from the range there would be.

6

think that depending upon the segment of the market the

7

range might be more or less narrow.

8
9

I

In segments of the market where services are
more commodified and standardized, perhaps with index

10

funds, there might be a much narrower range of fees that

11

are arrived at through arm's-length bargaining, and even

12

-- and smaller disparities might be inappropriate there.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How is the -- how is the

14

standard you've just described different from a standard

15

of reasonableness?

16

MR. GANNON:

It -- I think that the chief

17

way it differs from reasonableness, Justice Kennedy, is

18

in saying that the Court doesn't actually have to decide

19

what the single most reasonable fee is.

20

explained in 1969, the shift from reasonableness to -

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But as the SEC

Well, I would be very

22

surprised if "reasonableness" always meant one -- one

24

It could mean a range.
MR. GANNON:

to whether the transaction -

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you a question

5

going back to Justice Kennedy's early question?

6

think the fiduciary status of the defendant in this case

7

is different from the fiduciary status of a president of

8

a corporation?

9

MR. GANNON:

Do you

I -- I -- I think that it is

10

different from the status of a president of a

11

corporation; that -- that the term of art, "fiduciary"

12

which Congress was invoking here can mean different

13

things in different circumstances.

14

Pepper was a case that involved corporate

15

directors.

The chief difference here and what Congress

16

was intending to counteract was the inherent structural

17

impediment to arm's-length bargaining between the

18

investment adviser and the board of directors.

19

that's what makes that high burden that was used in

20

Pepper v. Litton for controlling shareholders the

correctly, will a process flaw alone justify a

Yes, it will.

No, I -- I -- I doubt that as

imagine, under 36(b):

the bounds of what could have been bargained that it

The question under 36(b) is whether, having

14

section 36(b) or (a) should not be a de novo judicial

review of the size of the fee for a couple of reasons,

16

the first of which is section 36(b)(2).

your mind, I would like to know what he's paid by other

16

people that don't have someone like me setting his pay?

17

Wouldn't that be in your mind?

18

MR. DONOVAN:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

23

Yeah, so wouldn't that be a

normal question to ask?

21
22

It could be, sure.

MR. DONOVAN:

And the trustees did ask it

here.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I don't know if they

24

asked it -- I mean, I think we are reviewing the

25

district court opinion, I think we are reversing -- we

2

(Laughter.)

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

We're reviewing.

I have laryngitis; I don't

speak accurately.

5

(Laughter.)

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think we are reviewing a

7

-- a decision of a court of appeals setting a standard,

8

and so wouldn't, when we set the standard, say, we can't

9

say if in every case you are not going to go out and ask

10

him what he charges when he mows the neighbor's lawn,

11

but we would like to know what he charges when he asks

12

for money from people who do not have this kind of

13

supervision, and we would like if it's a lot different

14

to ask him why.

Justice Breyer Okay, so what's the problem

then with saying that in the opinion?
MR. DONOVAN:

There is no problem with

saying that if it is a relevant consideration.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it's pretty unusual

21

that it won't be, and I think certainly you have in the

22

case in front of us a case where it would be relevant.

23

You may have an answer to the question.

24

perfectly good answer, so let's listen to it.

MR. DONOVAN:

There may be a

The difference, Your Honor, is

2

the question and the answer dispositive in every case.

3

I would acknowledge as -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

The answer dispositive?

5

Well, I don't see it should be dispositive, maybe the

6

answers would be quite different.

7

MR. DONOVAN:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Precisely.
All right.

So -- but you

no objection, then I'm not sure there is much of an

10

issue.

11

That's the only issue, whether this should be

12

dispositive always, or whether it should be a factor to

13

take into account where relevant?

14
15
16

There might -- I mean, maybe there is some.

MR. DONOVAN:

It is a factor that I consider

that is likely to be relevant JUSTICE BREYER:

So you have no objection to

17

send it back and say look, of course this is relevant,

18

perhaps quite often relevant; why don't you look at it?

19
20
21

MR. DONOVAN:

My objection -- my objection

to sending it back is only that that analysis was done.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But did -- but in the

22

Seventh Circuit, Judge Easterbrook said, mainly you have

23

to look to see if there was full disclosure, and then

24

there might be cases where it's so out of line.

25

said the comparison would be to other mutual funds.
39
Alderson Reporting Company

And he
He

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

excluded the comparison with institutional investors.

2

So to that extent, was the Second Circuit wrong, saying

3

this is not a relevant factor; what other mutual funds

4

pay investment advisors may be a relevant factor?

5

MR. DONOVAN:

I think the Seventh Circuit

6

made that comparison.

Judge Easterbrook did say that

the services of institutional accounts ordinarily are

8

different from mutual fund accounts.

9

the first instance, the first comparator usually should

not cite to the record for the reasons to identify those

differences.

same.

When you say you

it is way out of line, then you assume or can at least

look further at whether there was a fair process?

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. DONOVAN:

I look at it in the Gartenberg

sense, Your Honor.

And the reason is because as I -

from what I said the first question is, is when do you

ask courts to substitute their judgment?

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

you're not the person to -- to ask, but do you

7

understand the Solicitor General's position to be your

MR. DONOVAN:

It's probably -

I believe they interpret in

10

the Gartenberg sense.

11

General's position and the Respondent's, with respect to

12

the standard that you ought to apply, is Gartenberg.

13

I think that the Solicitor

That is to say, the key sentence you can

JUSTICE BREYER:

You object if we turn them

MR. DONOVAN:

So we can say the substance

11

is -- I'm just trying this out -- the substance is to

12

look and see if it's reasonable, and if it's reasonable

13

it certainly is the product of arm-length bargaining, if

14

it's not reasonable, how could it be?

9

MR. DONOVAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

I start at

10

page 16a and 17a of the district court's opinion where

11

at page 16a at the bottom the district court said the

MR. DONOVAN:

Of the petition.

Correct, it's 16a of the

19

petition, which is Judge Kocoras' opinion.

20

bottom of the page you will see that he said, the

21

services Harris provided to institutional clients varied

22

but in all events were more limited than those provided

And then, Justice Scalia, I would then go to
page 32a of the district court's opinion where he

10

describes what appear to be disputed issues of fact.

11

And what he said those dispute issues of fact were about

12

were what the Petitioners claimed were flaws in the

13

negotiation process, in substance, what they would have

14

done had they been negotiating, rather than the

15

trustees.

16

was this fee so far out of bounds it could not have been

17

reasonable.

It is not a dispute about the ultimate test,

To be sure, throughout a record that is as

large as this one, you could imagine the parties

21

dispute is whether these fees, for these funds, using

22

comparable funds and using institutional accounts, as

23

Judge Kocoras did, were so far out of bounds, they could

24

not have been fairly bargained, and if that is the test,

If, as I suggest and as the Solicitor

2

General suggests, Gartenberg is the appropriate

standard, Gartenberg is what the district court applied.

4

This Court has to be sure, on occasion, and

5

it is rare, both announce the test and apply it in the

6

same circumstances.

7

In circumstances where courts are looking

8

for guidance on what the standard is and how to apply

it, I suggest this is a case in which affirming what the

not provide full and accurate information?

profitability, and several other matters, that what

differently, but, for example, with respect to

Alderson Reporting Company

ostensible misrepresentations on -- among other things,

3

plaintiffs' expert did an accounting and accounted for

4

costs differently and said, had you accounted for costs

5

and allocated them the way I did, you would have reached

6

a negotiated result that was different.

7

Well, that just isn't what happened.

That's

8

why Judge Kocoras said, this goes to the integrity of

9

the negotiation.

10

Would the negotiation have been

different?

11

The plaintiffs say, I would have done it

12

differently, but that's all they said, and it's not a

13

misrepresentation to say, I would have accounted for

14

costs differently.

15

Finally, I would -- the other question you

16

asked is where in the record -- Justice Scalia, I'm

funds and what fee is charged for institutional

and say that a comparison to institutional accounts is

On this record, these were funds that had

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK:

In fact, on page 30a, the district court
said that the disputes were nonmaterial, and that's a
47

very important distinction because the joint appendix

that you have before you contains a lot of evidence in

On 505 to 506, the Harris research director

12

testimony that the managers of the mutual funds and

13

independent accounts share equally all work done by the

14

research department, and 513 to 514, that the Harris

15

fund manager says all of our analysts do research for

16

all of our clients.

17

There is disputed evidence here as to what

18

constitutes similarity, Justice Sotomayor, these are

19

comparing apples to apples because the record indicates

20

that there are separate contracts for the additional

21

fees that they charge to the mutual funds for the

22

additional services provided.

We're simply talking about comparisons of
money management, but CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

performance and lower than average fees?

MR. FREDERICK:

5

found, they had lower than average performance and

6

higher than average fees, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

damages period that encompasses several years.

It's a

If I could go back to the point, though,
about the fiduciary duty, what Judge Cardozo, when he

10

was on the New York Court of Appeals, said, a fiduciary

11

represents the punctilio of honor, and that is

12

contrasted with the morals of the marketplace operating

13

at arm's-length.

14

It surely cannot be the case that, where you

15

are dealing with a fiduciary duty -- which is a higher

16

standard recognized in the law -- that you can charge

17

twice as much as what you are obtaining at arm's-length

18

for services that you are providing.

19

The Gartenberg court, Justice Breyer, in

20

fact, had the opposite language that you are averting

21

to, and that is at page 694 F.2nd 928, where the Court

22

said, "The test is essentially whether the fee schedule

23

represents a charge within the range of what would have

24

been negotiated at arm's-length in the light of all the

25

surrounding circumstances."

pretty close to what you are arguing for, without

getting into all this thing of whether it's just like a

trustee or whether a lawyer should be a trustee or -

6

you know, there are a lot of questions here that could

float around, of any language we use.

MR. FREDERICK:

That's right.

The Second

a negative, which is not ordinarily what a plaintiff has
