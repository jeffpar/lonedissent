CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We’ll hear argument

5

Comstock.

6

General Kagan.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

GENERAL KAGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

Article I of the Constitution permits

12

Congress to enact section 4248, which is the limited

13

Federal civil commitment statute at issue in this

14

case.

15

To see why, to understand the basis for this

16

statute, it might be helpful to go all the way back to

17

1945, when what this Court later called "a

18

conspicuously able committee of Federal judges"

19

recommended that Congress pass section 4246, a very

20

similar civil commitment law that has been on the

21

books for some 60 years.

22

The committee there wrote that the law was

23

necessary to deal with what it called the serious

24

problem of what to do with insane criminals -- and I'm

25

quoting now -- "upon the expiration of their terms of
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

confinement, where it would be dangerous to turn them

2

loose upon society and where no State will assume

3

responsibility for their custody."

4

That is exactly what Congress concluded

5

here.

Congress could reasonably find that section

6

4248 was necessary to prevent a similar problem.

7

Federal Government has mentally ill, sexually

8

dangerous persons in its custody.

9

persons, if released, will commit serious sexual

The

It knows that those

10

offenses; and it knows too that States are often not

11

in a position to deal with such dangers, not in a

12

position to take custody and care and responsibility

13

for those persons upon release from Federal prison.

14

This is essentially a transitional problem

15

that the Court was -- that the Congress was dealing

16

with, how to manage the transition from Federal

17

custody to State superintendence and responsibility.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, is part of the

19

statutory scheme that you can be committed to Federal

20

custody for, say, a year and then the State takes it

21

over?
GENERAL KAGAN:

22

That is correct, Justice

23

Kennedy.

In fact, what the statute requires is for

24

the Attorney General really to -- immediately upon

25

commitment, to go to a State, if he hasn't done so
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

beforehand -- to go to two States, the State of

2

domicile and the State of prior conviction.

3
4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

incur that extra expense if --

5

GENERAL KAGAN:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7
8
9

Why would a State want to

Well --- if the Federal

Government is going to do it for them?
GENERAL KAGAN:

What Congress found was that

States often were not willing to incur that extra

10

expense, even if the Federal Government was not going

11

to do that for them, and what this legislation was,

12

was a response to that reality.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It was --

What was the experience

14

under 4246?

15

books for some time, and there efforts must be made to

16

have the State take the person.

17

You pointed out that that has been on the

When the civil commitment is used following

18

the end of a term -- let's say someone is insane --

19

how often does it end up that the State takes

20

responsibility and how often is it that the person

21

stays in Federal custody?

22

GENERAL KAGAN:

I think it is unusual,

23

Justice Ginsburg.

It’s not the usual course that the

24

State does take responsibility.

25

statute commits the Attorney General and the Bureau of

But the Federal

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Prisons to try to persuade a State to take custody, to

2

defer to the State if a State has some reason to take

3

custody, but -- but makes sure that the Federal

4

Government is a kind of backstop, so that if the State

5

does not take responsibility and does not take

6

custody, the Federal Government will ensure that the

7

person will not be released, the person who has been

8

found to be both mentally ill and sexually --

9
10
11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the likelihood is

that the person will stay in Federal custody?
GENERAL KAGAN:

I think that that's fair,

12

that the likelihood is that the person will stay in

13

Federal custody until such time as a court finds that

14

the reasons for that custody have lapsed.

15

the State always has the ability to come in and say:

16

We would like to take control over this person.

17

more to the point, the Attorney General has the

18

responsibility to keep going to the State and to try

19

to see if he can transfer custody to the State.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But, again,

And

What -- what -- what power

21

conferred upon the Federal Government by the

22

Constitution permits the Federal Government to assure

23

that sexual predators are not at large?

24
25

GENERAL KAGAN:

I think the power, Justice

Scalia, is the power to run a responsible criminal
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

justice system, to run a criminal justice system that

2

does not itself endanger the public.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you would say

4

that the Federal Government has no such power

5

independent of the criminal conviction?

6

words, that Congress could not pass a law saying, just

7

as this one says, we are going to commit people who

8

are sexually dangerous until a determination that they

9

are not or until the State can take them?

10

That power

would not be in Article I?

11
12

In other

GENERAL KAGAN:

Without the person having

entered the criminal justice system in any way.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

I understand

14

your argument to be that this power is necessary and

15

proper, given the fact that the person is in Federal

16

custody for some other reason, criminal conviction.

17

GENERAL KAGAN:

That has been the

18

government's case throughout this litigation, that it

19

has always depended on the fact of Federal custody, on

20

the fact that this person has entered the criminal

21

justice system, has been -- four of the five of these

22

people --

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

GENERAL KAGAN:

25

have served prison terms.

Yes.

-- have been convicted and
And the question really is,
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

well, given that, given that the Federal Government

2

has custody of these people, that it's difficult for

3

the States to -- to take responsibility for these

4

people after the prison term is finished.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, why doesn't

6

the Federal Government's authority to have custody

7

because of the criminal justice system end when the

8

criminal justice system is exhausted?

9

when the sentence is done?

10

GENERAL KAGAN:

In other words,

Because the Federal

11

Government has a responsibility to ensure that release

12

of the people it has in its custody is done

13

responsibly, is done in such a way --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you said no.

I mean,

15

there is no constitutional power on the part of the

16

Federal Government to protect society from sexual

17

predators.

18

at an end, it seems to me that's the only power you

19

could be relying upon.

20

And, you know, once the Federal custody is

GENERAL KAGAN:

I think that the power to

21

run a responsible criminal justice system extends to

22

the way in which the Federal Government releases these

23

prisoners.

24
25

And -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could the Federal

Government order a commitment of anyone who's been in
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Federal custody over the last 10 years?
GENERAL KAGAN:

Justice Kennedy, I think

3

that that would be a much harder case.

4

people, of course, who are on supervised release and,

5

for example --

6
7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There are some

No, no, no.

That makes

your -- my hypo too easy for you.

8

(Laughter.)

9

GENERAL KAGAN:

Okay.

Well, I’ll grab your

10

difficult hypo, then.

11

be a different case and that the Federal Government

12

would not have the -- the power to commit a person who

13

is -- has been released from prison and whose period

14

of supervised release is also completed.

15

point, the release has been -- the transfer to State

16

responsibility and State control has occurred, and the

17

Federal Government would have no appropriate role.

18
19
20

And I would say that that would

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

At that

So that must be because

there is a lack of Federal power.
GENERAL KAGAN:

Yes, I think that that's

21

correct, that at that point the State police power

22

over a person has been fully reestablished.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it's fully

24

reestablished once he walks out of Federal prison, at

25

least if he walks out of Federal prison into a State.

GENERAL KAGAN:

transition period, and what this statute is designed

4

to do is to deal with that transition period and to

5

make sure that sexually dangerous, mentally ill people

6

don't fall through the cracks between Federal custody

7

and the reestablishment of State control.

8

I think that there is a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but they don't fall

9

through the cracks if the Federal Government notifies

10

the State into which this prisoner is to be released:

11

We are going to release a prisoner; we think he's

12

sexually dangerous; you should take some action to be

13

sure that he doesn't harm society.

14

State police function, it's none of our business.

15

GENERAL KAGAN:

Because that's a

I think Congress could

16

reasonably find that that is insufficient.

17

could reasonably find that the State -- that the

18

relationship between the State and the individual has

19

been sufficiently disrupted as a result of what is in

20

many of these cases an extended period of Federal

21

custody, that it's not so easy to establish --

22

reestablish it all at once.

23

as proof of this the supervised release system itself.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Congress

And I would point to you

Under your theory --

under the theory that you are proposing, then, any
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

dangerous person, whether it's because of mental

2

illness or any other reason, could be held

3

indefinitely --

4

GENERAL KAGAN:

No --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- under a civil

6

commitment statute, because what you're saying is that

7

the Federal Government, merely because of their --

8

their time in control of the individual, has an

9

unlimited constitutional power to then civilly commit

10
11

this dangerous person.
GENERAL KAGAN:

I think what would prevent

12

that, Justice Sotomayor, is the Due Process Clause.

13

It is obviously the case that there are other

14

constraints on governmental action than Article I.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, what -- what

16

constrains the government under the Due Process Clause

17

from invoking a dangerousness merely because someone

18

has a long history.

19

with long histories of violent behavior.

20

continue that violent behavior in prison, and some of

21

them at the end of their term are let out, because

22

their term has been completed.

23

the Due Process Clause protects --

24

GENERAL KAGAN:

25

We have many criminal defendants
Many of them

So what -- what in

Well, I think that the

history of this Court's cases would suggest that if

1

this were a person without mental illness that the

2

civil commitment statutes --

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

But that's where I'm

trying to understand --

5

GENERAL KAGAN:

Yes, that the civil --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- the connection

7

between the nature of the mental illness and the

8

constitutional power that you are claiming.

9

what is it that gives you that power?

10

GENERAL KAGAN:

What --

Well, if you go back to a

11

case like Kansas v. Hendricks, which is of course

12

where this Court thought about civil commitment

13

statutes with relation to sexually dangerous

14

offenders, I think the Court made clear that it was

15

important in that case that there be not only sexual

16

dangerousness, but also mental illness, in order to

17

invoke the civil commitment statutes.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you saying that as

19

far as those limitations, the question that Justice

20

Sotomayor was asking, the limitations on the Federal

21

Government would be the same as they are on the

22

States?

23

the Federal Government has any power at all.

24
25

But that’s a different question from whether

GENERAL KAGAN:
did, Justice Ginsburg.

You said it better than I
That’s exactly right, that of
12

course there are constraints on the Federal Government

in using civil commitment statutes, that they are the

6

only whether -- assuming that the Federal Government

7

is acting within other constitutional constraints in

making this civil commitment, whether Article I

9

enables it to do so because of the special custodial

The question presented here is

role in these cases.

11

But this is a

And --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

General Kagan, you are

12

relying on the Necessary and Proper Clause, right?

13

You say:

14

necessary and proper for the good of society.

15

means it’s necessary and proper for the execution of

16

another power that the Federal Government is given by

17

the Constitution.

18

But “necessary and proper” doesn't mean it’s
It

Now, why is this necessary for the execution

19

of any Federal power?

The Federal criminal proceeding

20

has terminated.

21

could say it's necessary for the good of society, but

22

that's not what the Federal Government is charged

23

with.

24

Federal Government is performing?

25

its performance of the function of incarcerating this

You

Why is it necessary to any function that the

individual until he has served his punishment.

2

GENERAL KAGAN:

The Court has always said,

3

Justice Scalia, that the Necessary and Proper Clause,

4

the question is, is it necessary and proper to the

5

beneficial exercise of Federal powers?

6

is, that it is necessary and proper to the beneficial

7

or, what I said before, the responsible exercise of

8

the Federal power to operate a criminal justice

9

system, which includes the responsibility to ensure

And so this

10

that those people who have been in custody in that

11

Federal -- in that criminal justice system are not

12

released irresponsibly.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

Isn’t it the case that -But the brief -- excuse

me.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I was going to ask, is

17

it the case that the unwillingness of States to step

18

into this area in these instances is a consequence, at

19

least in part and perhaps in large part, of the

20

Federal incarceration, that as a result of the Federal

21

incarceration, the person is no longer viewed by the

22

State as -- as having domicile within the State, the

23

State of prior domicile has no way of knowing whether

24

that person would return to a domicile in the prior

25

State?

Is that -- do you think that is a fair
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

understanding of the reason for the enactment of this?

2

GENERAL KAGAN:

Just to make sure that I

3

understand the question, that the reason for the

4

enactment in part has to do with the fact that the

5

Federal Government has assumed custodial

6

responsibility and has disrupted the relationship

7

between the State and the citizen, I think that that’s

8

exactly right, Justice Alito.

9

But in some sense, it's not just that the

10

Federal system finds itself in possession and custody

11

of these people, but the Federal -- what Congress

12

could reasonably find is that the Federal Government

13

knows that there’s nobody else to take appropriate

14

custody and care and that the reason that there’s

15

nobody else to take appropriate custody and care has

16

to do with the Federal action itself.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, is the prisoner -So, if there were --

Is it -- is it a prisoner

20

who has served his time in, say, a Federal

21

penitentiary in Ohio but is a domiciliary of Arizona,

22

what happens when the prisoner is released, say, after

23

10 years?

24

What?

25

Released to Ohio, sent back to Arizona?

GENERAL KAGAN:

The default position is that
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the prisoner is released to the place where the

2

prisoner was convicted.

3

or may not have any relationship with that State.

4

person may have lived there, may not have lived there.

5

Now, that -- the prisoner may
The

The -- the Federal prison system does

6

sometimes make other arrangements.

The idea behind

7

any release is to try to make sure that the person is

8

released to the place where a -- a future lawful life

9

will be most likely.

But in many of these cases, the

10

prisoner ends up being released to a State that has no

11

current relationship with the -- with the prisoner,

12

sometimes has had -- never had any relationship with

13

the prisoner, and at any rate doesn't now, because the

14

period of Federal custody has disrupted that

15

relationship.

16

And what the Federal Government is doing

17

here is essentially to deal with this transition

18

problem to make -- to make sure these people don't

19

fall between the -- the cracks, and to ensure that

20

where there is a sexually violent and mentally ill

21

person who one has reason to believe will commit

22

further offenses, that appropriate care and custody of

23

those people is ensured.

24
25

Now, this is no different from what Congress
has done on other occasions as well.

I understood you in

10

your response to Justice Alito to say, if I remember,

11

that it was not just the fact of Federal custody, but

12

the fact that there are no States or there may well

13

often be no States willing.

14

willing; I mean, every State is willing to take the

15

people on out of a concern to protect their citizens.

16

Does that somehow mean there’s no necessary and proper

17

power?

18

GENERAL KAGAN:

What if every State is

I think when we are dealing

19

with the Necessary and Proper Clause, we are asking

20

ourselves whether Congress reasonably acted in a given

21

situation --

22
23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess it wouldn't

be necessary, is what you are saying?
GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, if -- if -- that's

exactly right, that if the facts before Congress were
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

such that there were no difficulty with this

2

transition period and that nobody ever fell between

3

the cracks, an entirely different question would be

4

presented, and then there would be some kind of

5

argument that at that point, in those circumstances

6

State police power would be the appropriate default

7

position.

8
9

But -JUSTICE SCALIA:

General Kagan, I -- I find

it difficult to believe that if the Federal Bureau of

10

Prisons wrote the governor of the State into which

11

this person is to be released, and they try to release

12

him in the State where he -- he will in the future

13

reside, and said, we are about to release this person

14

in 60 days or whatever, in our view there are serious

15

mental problems, and we think the State ought to

16

consider commitment proceedings, I find it difficult

17

to believe that an elected governor or an elected

18

attorney general would ignore that letter.

19

GENERAL KAGAN:

I do believe, Justice

20

Scalia, that Congress reasonably could have found that

21

there were difficulties in making this transition.

22

The cost of commitment of these people is very high,

23

much higher than standard incarceration.

24

the States say in their amicus brief that it's some

25

$65,000 a year per person per year, and -- and the
18

I believe

State may feel as though it shouldn't have

responsibility over this person --

understanding this as a significant problem.

Was it -- was that a

consideration?

Did they --

GENERAL KAGAN:

That is exactly right,

18

Justice Ginsburg, and maybe that's the -- the best

19

answer to Justice Scalia, is history, and it's history

20

on two separate occasions, which this Court has noted.

21

It's history when -- when this committee of

22

Federal judges chaired by Calvert Magruder, including

23

Learned Hand, said we have a real problem here with

people being let go out of the Federal system and the

6

And the Court confronted and -- and thought

And this Court in Shannon said that, I think

7

the -- the language is, "Federal courts decried time

that -- that existed because people were acquitted on

I don't think so, Justice

Scalia.

5

commitment power only to people who have been -- who

7

responsibility.

I will give you an example, Justice Scalia.

10

I mean, suppose that there was some very contagious

11

form of drug-resistant tuberculosis that had -- had

12

become prevalent in the prison system, and States were

13

not able to deal with that, with quarantining these

14

people upon their release date, and Congress said:

15

You know, the best thing to do is to have the Federal

16

Government act as the appropriate quarantining

17

authority because we don't think that States are able

18

to step up and deal with this problem.

19

Would anybody say that the Federal

20

Government would not have Article I power to effect

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the exact

This is exactly what

Well, when I was thinking

Alderson Reporting Company

1

about your hypothetical, I thought, well, that's a

2

pretty easy commerce power argument.

3

that in -- in the government's position, you don't

4

argue the Commerce Clause very much, and I -- we’ve

5

got Morrison v. Brzonkala looking at you and Printz

6

and so forth.

7

I -- I notice

But it -- suppose Congress said there is a

8

class of committable, dangerous sex offenders that are

9

crossing State lines and using interstate facilities,

10

and made those findings.

Would that be sufficient to

11

establish a Federal commitment law?

12

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, as you say, Justice

13

Kennedy, the government has never argued the Commerce

14

Clause here in the sense that it has never argued that

15

these activities have a substantial effect on

16

interstate commerce, and it hasn't done so because of

17

the Morrison -- the Morrison precedent.

18

The Commerce Clause I think is relevant in

19

two ways.

20

it's often the Commerce Clause that gives rise to the

21

power to criminalize conduct and to punish people for

22

that conduct.

23

of these cases, the initial power to criminalize the

24

conduct is based on the Commerce Clause.

25

It's relevant first because, of course,

So I think in -- in three of the five

The Commerce Clause is also relevant here
22
Alderson Reporting Company

1

because the Commerce Clause does give rise to a set of

2

Federal laws having to do with sexual offenses, sexual

3

solicitation of a minor, sexual exploitation of a

4

minor when interstate commerce is involved, and when

5

the Internet is involved.

6

provides an additional basis, not a sufficient basis,

7

but an additional basis to -- to approve this law in

8

the sense that these are the people who are most

9

likely, really, to violate such Federal laws which are

based on the Commerce Clause in the future.
And the reason they are most likely is

12

because all of them have done it once before, and all

13

of them have been found to have the kind of mental

14

illness that makes it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's -- but that's

16

an easier case, because at least you have an

interstate connection to the offensive conviction and

the ground for future commitment.

19

don't depend on that element being a part of the

20

commitment process.

22

power that justifies the commitment other than that

23

the person is sexually dangerous.

I really think the government gives the game

8

not guilty by reason of insanity is a -- is a

9

different case for a couple of reasons.

I think

First off,

10

the commitment that flows from a not guilty by reason

11

of insanity verdict is directly linked to the Federal

12

law which brought you into custody in the first place.

13

The person is found to be -- to have been committed

14

the crime, but he is only -- he is only excused from

15

punishment for that crime by basis of his mental

16

illness.

17

crime which brought you into Federal custody and your

18

subsequent commitment.

So there’s a direct link between the -- the

The other distinction, of course, is that

19
20

not guilty by reason of insanity must be pled by the

21

defendant, and in some sense the commitment is in lieu

22

of punishment; it's not an additional punishment

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so what's the power

2

that the Federal Government is exercising when it

3

commits someone who has been found not guilty by

4

reason of insanity?

5

MR. DUBOIS:

They are vindicating their

6

interest in the specific criminal law which brought

7

the individual into custody, which presumably in most

8

cases -- in all cases, I guess -- is supported by an

9

enumerated power.

It is -- as I say, the commitment

10

is -- is a substitute for punishment, it's in lieu of

11

punishment, but it's directly linked to the crime

12

which brought the individual into Federal custody.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. DuBois, what is your

14

answer to the hypothetical that General Kagan posited?

15

Supposing after a man has been sentenced, say, to 30

16

days for gun possession, 20 -- 10 days before he is to

17

be released, it's determined he has a communicable

18

disease -- he would spread a disease if he gets out.

19

Could the -- could the Federal Government have the

20

power to detain him at the end of the 30 days?

21

MR. DUBOIS:

Well, Your Honor, I think a

22

single individual with a single communicable disease,

23

a defendant with tuberculosis --

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

MR. DUBOIS:

I don't think would -- would call for that type of --

of Federal Government --

My question is would it have the power --

5

MR. DUBOIS:

I would say --

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- not to release him,

7

because there -- there’s strong evidence that, as soon

8

as he gets into the society, the disease will -- will

9

pass to others?

MR. DUBOIS:

Well, Your Honor, I would say

11

that, in the same way that mental health is a uniquely

12

State function, so too is public health.

to that problem?

4

unconstitutional responses.

5

What's a constitutional response

We can imagine plenty of

JUSTICE STEVENS:

For instance, a person -Absolutely, and that's why

6

it seems to me that the constitutional answer is the

7

same in this statute as in the case of somebody who

8

incurs a very communicable disease and the government

9

wants to prevent him from infecting the community.

10
11

Why is it a different constitutional question?
MR. DUBOIS:

Well, I think the different

12

constitutional question is -- again, I do not believe

13

the Federal government has a general quarantine power

14

that doesn't -- that would allow it to hold prisoners

15

past their release date.

16

I think that is a public health problem,

17

except for -- to the extent that there may be a closer

18

nexus to a forward-looking Commerce Clause hook that

19

doesn't exist in this case.

The government's argument

20

is purely backwards looking.

They -- they locate the

21

power to commit --

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I understand.

It's purely

23

backwards looking, and it takes care of the case that

the release itself is a Federal act that has to be

2

harm to the community, can be prevented.

3

MR. DUBOIS:

And it seems to me that the

government's argument essentially collapses into the

5

notion, well, if it's a good idea, it must be

6

necessary and proper to do it.

7

simply not correct.

First of all, there’s
Second of all, there is

It already

Any time the Federal Government is going to
release a person they believe to be violent or

10

dangerous, they are required to warn the attorney

11

general of the State within a certain period of time

12

before their release.

13

At that point, I do believe it becomes a

14

problem of the State polity.

15

going to be cavalier about that type of release, then

16

I think the answer for that lies in the voters of that

decision at all because the Constitution requires that

they be released.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

The -- go back once more

16

because I am obviously getting nowhere with this, but

17

I thought that, if you set up a set of hospitals, as I

18

think the government could do, there will be a few

19

people, sometimes, who have to be restrained in those

20

hospitals for themselves or others’ benefit.

21

If you set up a system of mental hospitals,

22

that's even more true.

If you set up a university,

23

some people will be sick, and they will be in the

24

infirmary, and occasionally, you will come across a

person who has to be restrained, et cetera.

admit the government can do that, how is a prison any

3

different?

4

MR. DUBOIS:

Well, I --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

You set up a prison where,

6

in fact, occasionally, people have to be restrained

7

for health reasons, et cetera, and just as in the

8

other cases, sometimes that can last past the normal

9

release date, so can it in prison.

10

Maybe there's a better way, but why isn't

11

this just a normal part of running this institution,

12

just as it is in the other cases?

13

MR. DUBOIS:

Well, we'll just start -- I

14

think, a couple of responses.

15

- that is no part of the government's argument in this

16

case.

17

argument that locates its power in the fact that they

18

have had these people in their custody, and they can't

19

responsibly let them go.

20

First of all, this is ­

Their -- their argument is a backward-looking

What you are positing is more of a forward­

21

looking argument that would essentially create a

22

Federal parens patriae power, that the Federal

institution, which, for whatever set of reasons in the

2

Constitution, you have the authority to do, and then

3

it becomes, as part of that institution, part of the

4

job to take care of people in a certain way.

5

Sometimes that requires a restraint, and

6

sometimes that restraint could last beyond the period

7

where in the absence of that need the person would no

8

longer be part of the institution.

9

That's true of a

10

Whether they rest on the same power or a different

11

power, the government has the power, Federal, to

12

establish all of those institutions.

13

I'm just drawing institutional connections.

14

That's -- that's what I'm saying.

15

unnecessarily complex argument, but I was just seeing

16

it that way.

17

MR. DUBOIS:

Maybe that's an

Well, it -- it is complex,

18

Justice Breyer, and it’s also, I think, historically ­

19

- the Federal Government has not historically thought

20

to have been able to have the sort of general parens

21

patriae power that -- that the States do enjoy to take

22

care of the health and well-being of its citizens.

23

think it would be quite a step for the Federal

limitations on travel, certain limitations on

activities with computers.

A fairly large range of --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that doesn't take

20

care of the fact that the prisoner would be released

21

before there was a cure found for the alleged mental

22

illness, meaning supervised release generally has a

23

term limit.

24
25

MR. DUBOIS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And I think that concern, the -- the fact that we want
47

to do something before the release is addressed by

2

4042, which is the duty to warn statute.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could -- what would

happen if Congress said, as part of a sentence, a

5

judge could incorporate a civil commitment finding and

6

say:

7

amount, and then we are going to civilly commit you

8

indefinitely, because as of today, I am finding you a

9

sexual predator subject to a mental illness.

You are going to serve X amount in jail and Y

10
11

Would that be constitutional, and if not,
why not?

12

MR. DUBOIS:

Well, that would not be

13

constitutional, Justice Sotomayor, because of the

14

indefinite nature of the commitment.

15

a system -- and we had that type of system in the

16

'50s, '60s, and '70s -- of indeterminate sentencing,

where --

You can envision

Well, I -- let's assume

19

it incorporates all the protections of -- of this

20

statute with respect to periodic review.

MR. DUBOIS:

So if we have an indeterminate­

years and you are periodically reviewed to see if you

are safe to be released, of course that’s

-MR. DUBOIS:

It's a part of the sentence.

8

It's part of the punishment for the crime which

9

brought you into custody.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, so that would be

11

true whether or not you were convicted of a sex crime

12

or a tax crime or any other crime, so long as the

13

judge was making a finding that this was necessary to

14

protect the public?

15

MR. DUBOIS:

Sure.

A judge -- whether you

16

are being sentenced for bank robbery or -- or some

17

sort of sexual offense, the judge can take into

18

account the whole of your criminal history in

19

determining what you are being sentenced for, but you

that at the end of the sentence, it has an obligation

think, historically, sort of an anomalous argument in

you have a direct link to the unexhausted power.

Even though it may be

6

competent to stand trial.

MR. DUBOIS:

8

logic or the trade-off in Greenwood, which was that we

were not going to require courts to make finely

10

grained determinations about whether or not this

11

person or that person might regain competency, and

just decide to have a simpler test that commitment is

appropriate as long as the Federal Government's

Could you explain why the

16

constitutional power that provides the basis for a

purposes -- double jeopardy and due process -- but why

I don't quite understand

Well, I think the reason, Your

6

Honor, is that at the time of conviction and sentence,
