Mr. Mizer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN C. MIZER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MIZER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Respondents are natural gas suppliers who

12

object to the way Ohio taxes them.

13

in State court rather than Federal court for two

14

independent reasons.

15

federalism dictate that the State court should resolve

16

challenges to the validity of their own tax laws.

17

second, the Tax Injunction Act squarely prohibits

18

Federal courts from issuing declaratory judgments

19

holding State tax laws unconstitutional.

20

Their suit belongs

First, principles of comity and

And

Although either of these grounds would

21

independently support reversal of the Sixth Circuit

22

here, the analysis can really begin and end with the

23

comity doctrine, because that is where the lower courts

24

have shown confusion in the -­

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Before you get into that, I

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have a question that there may be an obvious answer to,

2

but I haven't found it.

3

standing question.

4

asking as relief, and the only relief they ask for, is

5

to raise the taxes of a competitor.

6
7
8

My understanding is -- it's a

My understanding is that they are

MR. MIZER:

Am I right?

That is how they have -- that is

the case, correct.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

If that's correct, I

9

have found no case that -- I haven't looked that hard,

10

but certainly no case in this Court -- that said there

11

is standing for a firm to challenge the taxes of a

12

competitor where the remedy is:

13

there were standing for such a thing, it would -- I'm

14

surprised that there aren't competitors all over the

15

country doing business out of State bringing diversity

16

cases in Federal court, saying:

17

should increase; it's all very complicated, but the

18

Commissioner didn't properly follow State law.

19

Raise his taxes.

If

My competitor's taxes

Now, I have found no case, certainly not in

20

this Court, which said:

Where all you want is to raise

21

the tax of a competitor, you have standing.

22

this is well-settled that you can do it, but I thought I

23

would raise that for both of you at the beginning in

24

case there is something you want to say about it, which

25

might save me a little time looking it all up.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

So perhaps

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. MIZER:

Well, I think there is a good

2

reason that there -- there aren't cases in the Federal

3

courts to that effect, but it's not a standing problem.

4

And to address the standing point directly, it's because

5

they do claim an injury that is cognizable.

6

Dennis v. Higgins, they are claiming a dormant Commerce

7

Clause injury.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Under

I have no doubt, and the

standing rule I think is clear, that if we're saying

10

because I am injured, and they have injury, you can't -­

11

you must give me reduction in my tax.

12

cases say.

13

clear.

That's what those

I have no problem with that.

Absolutely

You can do it.
But where all you want is to raise somebody

14
15

else's taxes, that I had thought -- and probably

16

wrongly, but I had thought there is a prudential

17

standing rule that says you cannot bring such a lawsuit.

18

And I don't see why you should be able to.

19

me it would be a nightmare if you could, which doesn't

20

surprise.

21

So there we are.

It seems to

That's the question.

And

22

you will tell me:

No, it's all clear; they can do it.

23

And I would like some citation or something and explain

24

why they should be able to do it.

25

to, anyway.

But you don't want

It's really for them.

MR. MIZER:

I am not aware of any prudential

2

standing rule, Your Honor, any case, but that's because

3

the Tax Injunction Act and the comity doctrine have

4

always prohibited such a case.

5

there's a lack of citation in the -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

And so that's why

Well, I suppose in

7

discrimination cases, if there is a discrimination men

8

versus women one way to resolve it would be to have

9

either -- either rule apply to both sides.

10

MR. MIZER:

That's right.

And the Court has

11

said that in cases like Davis and McKesson, where a tax

12

credit has been struck down as unconstitutional for

13

either dormant Commerce Clause or equal protection

14

reasons.

15

Well, you can extend the credit if you wish or you can

16

also contract the credit, but either way -­

And this Court, in Davis and McKesson, said:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

On the other hand, until

18

the Administrative Procedure Act was enacted, which -­

19

which eliminated all prudential bars to standing -- it

20

clearly was the law that you could not complain about

21

preference, unlawful preference, being given by the

22

government under regulatory provisions to a competitor.

23

The law was:

24

that was a prudential law, I assume.

25

why it's any different from the tax law.

That's tough.

There was no standing.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

And

And I don't know

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. MIZER:

And cases would have existed

2

challenging State tax laws, regardless of the APA for

3

Federal challenges, because the -- and those cases all

4

would have been adjudicated in the State courts, because

5

that is where State tax laws and State administrative

6

procedures are best challenged.

7

The -- the rule of comity holds that the

8

Federal courts should not entertain a challenge to a

9

State tax law where that challenge would either disrupt

10

the operation of the State tax regime or would intrude

11

into the meaning or application of the State tax law.

12

Both of those elements are true here.

13

disruptive because the suit goes to the very core -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14
15

This suit is

-- State law is unclear

here that would require Federal interpretation?
MR. MIZER:

16

At pages 27 to 33 of the blue

17

brief, we identify all of the ways in which the parties,

18

the State and the Respondents, dispute the application

19

and meaning of State tax law, particularly as to what

20

taxes should be compared for apples and oranges

21

purposes.

22

And the tax -- the Ohio tax question that's

23

at issue is:

24

State tax?

25

What is a franchise tax versus what is a

There is also the disruption of the

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

application of State tax law here, because any remedy

2

that would be afforded would necessarily alter the way

3

that the State can -- can tax.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why can't the Pullman

5

doctrine or the Burford doctrine, abstention doctrines,

6

be enough to counsel Federal abstention in this case?

7

Why do we have to create another exception to Hibbs and

8

not go to another established abstention doctrine?

9

MR. MIZER:

The Court doesn't have to create

10

anything, Your Honor, because Fair Assessment and Great

11

Lakes already say that the Burford and Pullman

12

principles get sort of bonus points in the tax context.

13

And then -­

14
15
16
17
18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why did you -- did

you argue Pullman in the court below?
MR. MIZER:

Yes, the principles of

abstention were argued in the district court and -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, no, no, no.

19

cite Pullman and did you argue it on a Pullman

20

abstention basis?

21

MR. MIZER:

Did you

To be frank, I don't know if

22

Pullman was -- was specifically cited, but that's

23

because Fair Assessment itself, which was heavily cited

24

in the lower courts, incorporates the principles of

25

Pullman and Burford and says that these tax questions

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

raise -- that these tax challenges raise questions about

2

the meaning of State law, about the operation of a

3

complicated regulatory regime, and so they are better

4

left to the State court.

5

The -- the application of the State law here

6

is particularly disruptive, because the tax laws being

7

challenged intersect integrally with the regulatory

8

regime.

9

Respondents are objecting to is the gross receipts tax,

Just to give one example, among the taxes that

10

which public utilities, the local distribution

11

companies, pay, but the non-public utilities like

12

Respondents do not pay.

13

The gross receipts tax is relevant on both

14

the tax and regulatory side of the ledger, because it's

15

a tax but it's then also a cost that as we explain at

16

page 6 of the blue brief, may be included in the gas

17

cost recovery formula for the rate that the public

18

utilities may charge their customers.

19

are approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.

20

And those rates

So if the gross receipts tax is eliminated,

21

it will affect the regulatory side of things as well.

22

And that distinguishes this case from Hibbs.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think it's -- it's

24

correct -- in relation to Hibbs, is it accurate to say

25

that you think that this case is different from Hibbs

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for essentially three reasons:

2

complicated analysis of State law and Hibbs did not;

3

that this one would potentially have a substantial

4

financial effect on the State and in Hibbs that would

5

not happen; and this case involves claims under the

6

dormant Commerce Clause and equal protection rather than

7

the Establishment Clause?

8

does that capture it or is there something more?

9

MR. MIZER:

That this one involves a

Does that -- are those -­

The first two especially capture

10

it, Your Honor.

11

just an additional explanation of the first two points,

12

because in an establishment clause challenge like Hibbs,

13

the remedy is often going to be very simple.

14

And I think the third point is really

In Hibbs, for example, there was a credit

15

being challenged.

16

pull the thread of that credit, and the rest of the

17

fabric of the Arizona tax scheme would remain intact.

18

Here, by contrast, if the thread of the gross

19

receipts -- sorry, of the sales tax and the commercial

20

activities tax is pulled, the fabric of the State's

21

taxation and regulatory regime will unravel.

22

And the Federal court could simply

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose if this -- you

23

have the dormant Commerce Clause claim and it doesn't

24

require a complicated analysis of State law.

25

different rates of taxation, let's say, for two

10
Alderson Reporting Company

You have

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

different categories of entities, and it's really not a

2

very important tax credit, so pulling the thread isn't

3

going to have much effect.

4

case would come out differently?

5

that action?

6

MR. MIZER:

And this case -- then the
Comity would not bar

I think it would be a much

7

closer case, Your Honor, but still there would be an

8

interest in allowing the State courts to resolve that

9

challenge, because as the Court has explained, when a

10

State court is -- is trying to address a constitutional

11

challenge that involves the application of State law, it

12

can engage in constitutional avoidance in ways that the

13

Federal courts cannot.

14

The State courts also have greater

15

competency, of course, with their own tax law, and they

16

have a greater remedial panoply available to them.

17

So, in your hypothetical, Justice Alito,

18

the -- the Federal court could not order a decrease in

19

the taxes of the challenger because that, as Hibbs

20

explains, would be revenue depleting, whereas if it were

21

in State court, the State court could decrease the

22

revenue -- sorry -- decrease the taxes of the

23

challenger, and then that would allow the State courts

24

most naturally to remedy the -­

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's assume that States

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

have a law that said, we are going to do different tax

2

schemes for African Americans than from whites.

3

they do exactly what is done here.

4

tax on one thing but not on another.

5

give an exemption in one area, but not another.

And

They are going to
They are going to

Is that a case that would have to be -- an

6
7

equal protection challenge that would have to be decided

8

in State court?

9

MR. MIZER:

Fair Assessment says in footnote

10

4 that if it doesn't -- if such a challenge doesn't

11

require scrutiny of the meaning and application of State

12

laws, then it may -- Fair Assessment suggests that such

13

a case might be able to proceed in Federal court.
But if the -- if the challenge does require

14
15

scrutiny of State law or resolution of -- of unclear

16

State law questions, then it should be in State court,

17

and there is no reason -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

I don't know if that is

19

an answer to my question or not.

20

thing I changed in the hypothetical was that the

21

challenge was an equal protection challenge race -­

22

based on a suspect classification.

23

system is no different.

25

MR. MIZER:

But the credit

Would or would not that

I see, Your Honor.

12
Alderson Reporting Company

And if it

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

were equally complicated, then it is a challenge that

2

should go to the State courts, because there is no doubt

3

that the State court can handle Federal constitutional

4

questions and along the way, they might be able to

5

construe the State law in a way that avoids the

6

constitutional shoals -­

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And you reach that

8

conclusion under the comity principles of Fair

9

Assessment?

10

MR. MIZER:

I do, but also because the Tax

11

Injunction Act would exclude the case if it would have

12

revenue depleting effects -­

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MR. MIZER:

Revenue depleting.

-- on the State coffers.

And

15

the remedy might, in that case, have such an effect

16

if -- if the -- if the result is to tilt the balance

17

heavily against a party who then needs to have its own

18

taxes assessed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

I am curious to know why

20

neither opinion in Hibbs addressed the comity principle

21

and I would like your view on that.

22

thinking.

Your answer is:

Well, you tell me, -­

23

(Laughter.)

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

I know what you are

-- but, why wasn't that

addressed in your view?

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. MIZER:

Well, it was fully briefed in

2

Hibbs, and that is I think why the Court addressed

3

comity in footnote 9.

4

says that the comity doctrine doesn't cover such a

5

challenge.

6

is that the Court cited both Fair Assessment and Great

7

Lakes.

8

when a -- a tax challenge has a disruptive effect, for

9

all practical purposes, on the collection or

And footnote 9 of Hibbs simply

And the explanation, I think, of footnote 9

And those cases stand for the proposition that

10

administration of the State tax regime, then comity bars

11

it.
And so when the Court in footnote 9 of Hibbs

12
13

said challenges are barred by comity if they arrest or

14

countermand State tax collection, it was -- it was

15

speaking about the kind of cases at issue.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It wasn't brought up -­

17

comity wasn't brought up in Hibbs because if the -- if

18

there was an alleged constitutional violation, then

19

there was only one way to go.

20

payments to the parochial schools could not be -- had to

21

be eliminated, so there was no question of abstention

22

versus invalidation or doing something else that was

23

fancy.

24

that, because there was only one way -- only one cure.

is a constitutional violation, either the Commerce

Clause or the equal protection.

8
9

What -- the Federal court could -- is -- is
That's a

But what could the State court do?

MR. MIZER:

What could the State

I think there are three options

available to the State court.

First, it could decrease

10

the -- the taxes on the challengers, even if they don't

11

ask for such a decrease.

12

They could also increase the challenges -­

13

the taxes on the local distribution companies, or they

14

can do what the Ohio Supreme Court has done in the

15

education context, for example, which is to declare

16

unconstitutionality and then leave it for the General

17

Assembly, the Ohio legislature, to fix the problem and

18

then come back with a remedy.

19

If -- if that kind of relief were ordered by

20

the Federal court, it would mean Federal court oversight

21

essentially of Ohio budgetary processes, which this

22

Court has repeatedly discouraged.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

May I come back to your

24

answer to Justice Ginsburg's question?

25

beyond the ability of the Arizona courts, had that case

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Would it be

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

been -- had Hibbs been brought in Arizona, to hold that

2

under whatever principles of severability Arizona has,

3

the tax credits for some private schools could not be

4

stricken without striking the entire provision?

5

MR. MIZER:

I think the entire provision

6

would have to be stricken in Hibbs because of the nature

7

of the as-applied challenge there.

8

that all the money was going to private schools, private

9

religious schools.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

They were saying

The point is that -- that

11

one possible -- if there was an Establishment Clause

12

violation, one remedy would be to prohibit credits for

13

payments made to religiously affiliated schools, but

14

allow the credits for other private schools.

15

principles of severability, couldn't an Arizona court

16

say that can't be severed from -- from allowing the

17

credits for payments to secular private schools?

18

MR. MIZER:

But under

That's probably right, Your

19

Honor, and the -- what it illustrates is that often

20

State courts have available to them remedies that

21

Federal courts may not, particularly when plaintiffs

22

have pleaded the case in such a way as to tie one hand

23

behind the Federal court's back.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Doesn't that suggest Hibbs

should have come out the other way?

16
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. MIZER:

Well, to be frank, Your Honor,

2

the State of Ohio joined an amicus brief urging the

opposite outcome in Hibbs.

And to return

If -- just one more.

If

the remedy is likely to be we will leave it up to the

10

legislature -- you had -- you had two or three different

11

optional remedies -- would we say that that is an

12

adequate State remedy?

13

MR. MIZER:

Yes, I believe so, Your Honor.

14

Because so long as the challenger would be able then to

15

-- to seek some sort of contempt action if the -- if the

16

remedy were not -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17
18

legislature?

Contempt did you say?
MR. MIZER:

19

Contempt of the

Of the -- of the tax

20

commissioner.

If the tax commissioner is continuing to

21

collect unconstitutionally unbalanced taxes, then I

22

should think that there should be some enforceability

23

there.

24

But the adequacy of the challenge available

25

is -- is measured, as this Court explained in Rosewell,

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

purely by procedural measures.

And so for -- in

2

Rosewell the question was whether or not the parties

3

could go to State court and would procedurally be able

4

to get access to State court to resolve their claim and

5

that is clearly true and no one contests that here.

6

The -- to return to Justice Sotomayor's

7

question about the -- the racial cases, that may seem

8

troubling, if a racial challenge is excluded from

9

Federal court, but -- but there is no doubt that State

10

courts can resolve such claims and in fact the Ohio

11

Supreme Court handles tax cases as a routine matter.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

Where is -- the cases

13

running up to Hibbs, those were all cases that involved

14

racial discrimination, and they were in the Federal

15

courts.
MR. MIZER:

16

They were, Your Honor, and in -­

17

in every case that we have examined one of two things

18

was true:

19

based on the fact that he himself was subject to

20

unconstitutional taxes; or the party was not -- did not

21

have an adequate remedy in the State court.

22

example, in the Griffin case this Court said that the

23

problem was that in Virginia nothing was being done to

24

remedy the -- the unconstitutional burdens imposed

25

there.

Either the party was claiming standing not

For

And so the lack of an adequate remedy both under

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the comity doctrine and under the Tax Injunction Act

2

allowed the plaintiffs there access to the Federal

3

court.

4

And so the comity rule that we are

5

advocating, which is clearly laid out in both Fair

6

Assessment and Great Lakes, would not have any effect on

7

those cases because of the lack of an adequate remedy.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there anything -- I see

in their complaint, they ask for "such other relief to

10

which plaintiffs are entitled," and therefore the judge,

11

despite what they say, might just say:

12

are entitled to is you are entitled to pay fewer taxes.

13

Is that a plausible thing, in which case it

Well what you

14

would interfere with the revenue collection of the

State.

you better give me your accurate assessment, not just

I want to know both sides.

21

MR. MIZER:

The Tax Injunction Act would bar

22

the Court, I think, from entering an order that says the

23

taxes on the challengers are decreased, which

24

illustrates the reason that the State of Ohio with its

25

sovereign interest in its own tax policy -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I have no idea -- why I

2

am asking the question is I have no idea or little idea

3

of the underlying State law merits.

4

in about 10 or 15 minutes I will hear that the State law

5

merits are such that it's virtually impossible that they

6

are going to say to us:

7

will say to our competitors:

8

your chance to reply to that hypothetical argument just

9

in case they make it.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. MIZER:

And my suspicion is

Pay fewer taxes.

Rather they

Pay more taxes.

So now is

Well, first of all, Your Honor,

12

the -- the merits of this case are very much like the

13

merits of General Motors Corporation v.

14

this Court decided about 13 years ago.

15

also illustrate the complexity of any remedy that -­

16

that would be ordered in this case, because if it's so

17

simple as the Federal court simply saying that the local

18

distribution companies, the public utilities, now must

19

pay the sales tax and the commercial activities tax,

20

then suddenly those entities would be subject to five

21

taxes, a -- a much greater burden then is imposed on the

22

Respondents.

Tracy, which
But the merits

23

And then the General Assembly would have to

24

go back to the drawing board to adjust the taxes on the

25

local distribution companies.

So even if the simple

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

remedy that they ask for is entered by the Federal

2

courts, still the State of Ohio has to respond by

3

readjusting its sales tax and its commercial activities

4

tax; and in that event it first of all could easily end

5

up in a net revenue loss for the coffers of the State of

6

Ohio.

7

It also would mean that the regulatory side

8

of thing would be affected, which brings us back to the

9

Burford principles we discussed earlier, because the

10

taxes, as I said, are integrally connected to the way

11

Ohio regulates public utilities.

12

utilities have obligations to a captive market that the

13

Respondents don't have to meet.

14

their area no matter what, whereas Respondents don't

15

have to -­

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And those public

They serve customers in

Yes, but this -- but this

17

doctrine, I -- I am not very sympathetic to that

18

argument because this is a doctrine that is directed to

19

the State collecting taxes, not to interfering with

20

State regulation.

21

That -- that's a different doctrine.

MR. MIZER:

But Your Honor, I think that

22

Great Lakes and Fair Assessment stand for the

23

proposition that when a Federal court issues an order

24

that invalidates a State tax law, that has a disruptive

25

effect on the collection of taxes; and that would be

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

true here because the State of Ohio would no longer be

2

able -- would not be able to collect five different

3

taxes from local distribution companies without being -­

4

turning around and facing a new challenge on -- on

5

unconstitutionality of that burden by the local

6

distribution companies.

7

And so the -- the complicated nature of the

8

tax-regulation interplay here is all the more reason

9

that this case belongs in State court, for the State

10

courts to resolve those interconnected questions in ways

11

that they are fully equipped to answer.
The other factor that was relevant to the

12
13

Court's analysis -­
JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

I'm just a little puzzled.

15

I think you are giving the State court an awful lot of

16

power.

17

to adjust these other taxes, maybe the expenses they

18

deduct in their regulatory filings and all the rest.

19

But I don't know that the State court has any more

20

authority to grant a judicial remedy than the Federal

21

court would have.

22

Can it do it without new legislation?

MR. MIZER:

They have

The State court might be able to

23

enter a remedy, Justice Stevens, that is so simple as

24

enjoining the sales tax exemption and the commercial

25

activities tax exemption for local distribution

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

companies, and then also saying that because the LDCs

2

have to pay those taxes they no longer have to pay the

3

gross receipts tax and the other two taxes that are

4

imposed on them.

5

couldn't issue because under principles of both the Tax

6

Injunction Act and the -- and comity -­

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's an order that the Federal court

But the Tax Injunction Act

8

goes to the authority or the jurisdiction of the court

9

to entertain the case in the first place.

I'm not sure

10

the Tax Injunction Act prohibits the remedy that you

11

describe, because there is a difference between filing

12

the suit and entering relief after the suit's been

13

filed.
MR. MIZER:

14

With respect, Your Honor, I

15

think that Great -- that Grace Brethren squarely stands

16

for the proposition that a Federal court shouldn't enter

17

an order that says that the State tax law is -- that

18

declares the State tax law unconstitutional and then

19

enjoins it.

20

in order to eliminate the additional taxes on local

21

distribution companies.

22

the front end, not at the end after the Court has

23

resolved the constitutional merits and then says, well,

24

I guess I am not able to enter the order that makes the

25

most sense here to resolve the constitutional question.

And that is exactly what would be required

because it has never been raised.

I do not have a good

What I can say to the Court is that in

JUSTICE BREYER:

There is a

They might want to -- in

all the Court's cases, the challenger wanted -- he said:

I don't care; either make them pay or give me my money

2

back.

3

MR. FITCH:

Well -­

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that -- that should be

5

your case, I would have thought.

6

it so you can get into Federal court.

7

read it.

Now, that's how I

And that seems -- that's worrying to me.

8

MR. FITCH:

9

I would say is that -­

10

But you're not saying

Well, Justice Breyer, so -- what

JUSTICE BREYER:

The Establishment Clause, I

11

would add, there is a lot of reason for thinking it's

12

special in respect to standing, because there is no

13

other way to challenge the Establishment Clause.

14

that is a long-festering disagreement within this Court,

15

but I'm not sure you can apply these rules to everything

16

else.
MR. FITCH:

17

And

And I understand that, Your

18

Honor.

19

because that issue was not raised, based upon Hibbs,

20

based upon the decision in Coors, we did not see a

21

standing issue based upon this competitive situation

22

you're talking about.

23

question for additional briefing, we would obviously

24

welcome that opportunity.

25

And I guess the point that I'm trying to make is

If in fact that is an appropriate

JUSTICE BREYER:

But you see what is

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

worrying me.

What's worrying me is, is there are

2

businesses all over the country and there's Federal tax

3

law, too.

4

this is a terrific idea; I am going to go through my

5

competitor's tax returns and I will discover taxes they

6

should have paid but didn't, and all of a sudden we will

7

face a lot of lawsuits challenging other people's taxes.

8

That's what is worrying.

And suddenly people begin to think:

9

MR. FITCH:

Okay.

Hey,

And I would disagree with

10

you, Justice Breyer, for this reason.

11

substantial limitations on when this type of case can be

12

brought.

13

we can't restrain the collection of taxes.

14

abstention doctrines that have been mentioned.

15

the fact that the Court in a merits situation has to

16

give deference to the States.

We start with the TIA.

There are already

we believe this is a very narrow window.

21

There is only

What we are doing is

JUSTICE BREYER:

And this is not true of the

22

other cases.

What do you think of the other half of

23

their argument?

24

thing to see if I want to press it or not.

25

other half is:

I'll have to think about the standing

Look at your case.

26
Alderson Reporting Company

But the

Your case would just

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

be like -- just like the other cases, if you just said:

2

Give us a refund, as they did in the other cases.

3

But you haven't said that, because that

4

would run afoul of the Tax Injunction Act.

5

you have said is:

6

the State is:

7

things aside, you asked for other appropriate relief,

8

and it's highly probable in such situations that a Court

9

could -- would say:

Raise their taxes.

Now, wait a minute.

Rather, what

So the point of

Leaving all of the

Give them the exemption.

And if

10

it's going to say, give them the exemption, hey, this is

11

now not within Hibbs.

So what's your response to that?

MR. FITCH:

12

Your Honor, I don't -- as my

13

friend Mr. Mizer said, I don't believe a court could

14

say:

Give them an exemption.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. FITCH:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

There's a lot of

things they could say -­

It would be in violation of the

TIA.

18
19

Why not?

MR. FITCH:

It would interrupt -- interrupt

-- it would impede the collection of taxes.

Of course.

Of course.

23

Absolutely right.

That's what worrying me.

the answer.

it's what Justice Kennedy said in respect to

that would impede State taxes.

We are saying that if we ask for the

MR. FITCH:

And that was not what we were

seeking.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Makes sense to me.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, there's another

6

little problem.

Do you know of any case where a benefit

that A enjoys is taken away from A in a suit where A is

8

not a party?

I mean, you are fighting the Ohio tax

9

commissioner.

You want to take a benefit away from

10

these LDCs, but they are not in the suit.

11

isn't there a little due process problem with that?
MR. FITCH:

12

Don't -­

The response, Justice Ginsburg,

13

is this.

Number one, in part it takes away a tax

14

benefit from the LDC; in part it takes away a tax

benefit from the customers of the LDC.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What was that argument?

That you're taking a benefit -- you're saying:

relief we want is to take this benefit away from people

5

who are not in the lawsuit?
MR. FITCH:

by the State.

be involved, they could certainly move to intervene.

opportunity to adjoin them.

MR. FITCH:

I cannot identify a due process

problem there, Your Honor.

There is an issue that has

So you are claiming that

the Federal court could only power -- only power would

be to declare it unconstitutional and send it back the

State legislature to decide what to do?

7

claiming the Federal court has a power the State court

8

doesn't have, which is to order the exemption to be

9

rescinded?

10

Or you are

I'm not sure what your point is.
MR. FITCH:

Okay.

The point, Your Honor, is

11

this:

We believe the Federal court and the State court

12

would have the power to declare under the dormant

13

Commerce Clause and Equal Protection Clause, that this

14

exemption is unconstitutional, that either court could,

15

at that point, enjoin prospectively the operation of

16

that exemption.

happens then?

The question then becomes:

JUSTICE BREYER:

What

So then, in your opinion,

19

your next-door law firm, next to you, brings a case and

20

says:

21

because he deducted $2,000 that was illegal.

22

that?

23

is something wrong with this picture, and I can't quite

put my finger on it.

Mr. Fitch should pay $1,000 more taxes next year

point home, Justice Sotomayor.

15

asking the Federal court to rule on the

16

constitutionality on our Federal claims, enjoin this

17

exemption and the court's work is at an end at that

18

point.

19

that the legislature will be faced with a choice.

20

to deal with this -­

21

What we say is we are

What we believe will happen at that point is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How

Why should -- why should

22

the Federal court make that choice?

23

in the Federal cases where extension versus invalidation

24

has come up, those were all Federal laws and the court

25

said in the interim, we are going to extend the benefit,

33
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, in the -­

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

we are not going to take away benefits from anyone.

2

Every one of those cases they extended a benefit

3

until -- unless and until Congress acts, but there was

4

some comfort there because they were dealing -- the

5

Federal court is dealing with Federal legislation.
It seems to me that -- that there is that

6
7

choice, the State courts are much better equipped to say

8

what should happen in the interim until the legislature

9

acts.

10

MR. FITCH:

We do not believe that the

11

Federal court could extend that benefit.

12

in agreement there, Justice Ginsburg.

because in the briefs and in the argument today you are

option which is the regulatory option.

that the legislature opts on a regulatory basis to

is going to use to decide whether to -- to use comity to

3

not exercise that jurisdiction.

4

And what we are saying -- what we are saying

5

in our case is Hibbs did address comity.

6

before the Court in comity and Hibbs said, and now four

7

circuits have followed that ruling in Hibbs as well as

8

lower courts and have said, if you are not seeking to

impede State tax collection, comity does not bar -­

2

MR. FITCH:

But, Your Honor, the point we

3

are making is that some court somewhere has to make the

4

decision whether this exemption violates the dormant

5

Commerce Clause in the equal protection case.

6

was our judgment that the best forum for that was in

7

Federal court.

And it

And again, and I -- and I -- if I am not
responsive to your question, I apologize, but what we

are saying is that, we want to reach the merits on that

question of constitutionality.
And once that is done, the remedy is going

to lie with the State.

Do you -- do you recognize

20

that comity is broader than the Tax Injunction Act, and

21

if it is, how do you justify your argument that would

22

essentially limit the comity doctrine to the contours of

23

the Tax Injunction Act?

24
25

MR. FITCH:

Justice Alito, what the court

has said, not only this Court but the First Circuit said

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in Coors, is what the Sixth Circuit says is that comity

2

extends broader than the TIA.

3

repeatedly is Fair Assessment, because Fair Assessment

4

got damages and it was on a comity basis that the Court

5

held in Fair Assessment that you couldn't get around

6

your own liability by bringing a damage claim.

7

there's one example.

8
9

What they point to

So

We believe to some extent, National Private
Truck Council is an example.

Because in National

10

Private Truck Council, recall we are dealing with a

11

State court action, not a Federal court action.

12

National Private Truck Council what the court held was

13

under 1983, a State court -- a -- a -- a Federal court

14

would not order -- a State court was not obligated to

15

grant injunctive relief to grant attorneys fees under

16

1988, and that was based on comity.

In a

In that case there was still an issue of tax

17
18

collection and impeding tax collection, but certainly

19

that appeared to us to be at least an example of where

20

comity would be brought in to TIA, because the TIA

21

didn't apply in -- in National Private Truck Council.

22

There was reference to Burford before, as

23

Justice Scalia mentioned.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There is no doubt who is

Let me just go back to my

4

question before.

I understand your point about

5

regulation and nonregulation, but -- but your

6

competitors are subject to a different taxing regime

7

than you are; is that correct?

8

MR. FITCH:

They are, Your Honor.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And isn't -- is not the

10

reason they are subject to a different tax regime is

11

historically they were in regulated utilities?

12

MR. FITCH:

To -- to -- to some extent I

13

believe that's correct, Justice Stevens, but my response

14

would be this:

15

do they pay, versus what taxes do we pay -- that's a

16

merits question.

17

If we want to get into them, what taxes

That's a merits question.

Is this a compensatory tax?

I mean, have we

18

made our case -- do they have a defense because they pay

19

different taxes than we do -- that we do, and therefore

20

the State should be permitted to do that?

21

to reach that question.

22

that's not a -- not a jurisdictional question.

23

We would like

But that's a merits question,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And you don't think that

24

the very question of what taxes you compare and don't

25

compare is a matter of interpreting State law?

40
Alderson Reporting Company

You

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

don't think that the meaning of State law in terms of

2

what is comparable or not, is not implicated by any of

3

these questions?

4

MR. FITCH:

We -- we believe it is not,

5

Justice Sotomayor.

6

and see who they apply to.

7

I -- I strongly disagree with -- with my counterpart.

8

This is not a matter of interpretation.

22

Abstention doctrines

They dropped it.

It was -- it was not

So -- so the point we are -- we are -­

23

here's the point we are trying to make, as we see it.

24

We believe the footnote in Hibbs was correct; in all of

25

the Court's prior cases there has been an issue of a

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

taxpayer trying to avoid their own tax and thus impede

2

State tax collection.

3

TIA or comity, you are not precluded from original

4

Federal court jurisdiction if you are not attempting to

5

impede State tax collection.

We read Hibbs to say under the

We do not believe there is any significant

6
7

difference between our case or that analysis and the -­

8

the case in Hibbs.

9

circuits that have followed that.

As I said, that -- we now have four

10

But if I -- if I can bring us -­

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

When you say that there

12

is no impeding of State court process or taxes, because

13

neither a Federal or State court could order the

14

reduction of the exemption -­
MR. FITCH:

15
16
17

That -- that is correct, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That is -- even though

18

the practical consequence is that that is a remedy that

19

the State could choose, or must consider.

20
21
22
23
24
25

MR. FITCH:

It -- it could, Your Honor.

But -- but -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That wasn't an issue,

however, in Hibbs.
MR. FITCH:

That -- that's right.

And the

line that is repeated in a number of cases is, the net

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

effect, whether you are talking about the credit in

2

Hibbs or whether you're talking about the exemption in

3

our case, is if the Court puts on that order and the

4

legislature does not come up with a remedy, is that the

5

State would have more money.

to us, why -- since we have chosen to limit our remedies

7

by seeking a Federal court forum, it -- it -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

In fact it is a question

MR. FITCH:

What's wrong with it, Your

across in our brief, Your Honor, is that we are in a

MR. FITCH:

MR. FITCH:

18

because the exemption still exists.

19

It does not.
Why not?

The problem remains.
Why?

Well, the problem remains

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, no, no, you have it,

20

too -- they -- they work it out, so it equally applies

21

to everybody including your clients, so you are all on

22

the same footing.

23

Now what is the problem with that?

MR. FITCH:

And I guess we have to be

24

careful with the term "refund," because what I am saying

25

is -- is that we are dealing with primarily -- we have

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

three taxes to deal with.

One of them is the sales tax,

2

that's what is paid by the consumer; that would require

3

all the consumers to seek, you know, refunds.

4

cleaner in our view to simply go and get a determination

5

whether this exemption was unconstitutional.

It's much

We have forgone the --the request for

6
7

damages, we have forgone request for attorneys fees

8

because we have not alleged the 1983 claim.

9

trying to fix a problem.

10

We are

Justice Breyer, if I can in wrapping this

11

up.

We recognize -- we recognize that this Court has

12

competing interests that it has to weigh in resolving

13

this question.

14

said a minute ago, if you put that in context, the

15

context is there are numerous protections that are

16

already in place for the State to protect them from

17

Federal court interference, and we believe that the

18

decision in Hibbs and the circuits that have followed

19

Hibbs strikes a proper balance for this reason:

20

you -- first of all you protect State tax collection,

21

which has been the historic concern of this Court.

22

Second, the broad jurisdiction that Congress has given

23

in 1331 in a declaratory judgment statute, is harmonized

24

with the historic comity concerns.

25

as this Court spoke in -- in Hertz, just very recently,

What we are trying to say is that as I

Alderson Reporting Company

You -­

Third, the Court -­

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

as opposed to some vague intrusion test, you have got a

2

clear test that the Court can apply early on to decide

3

whether I got jurisdiction or not.

4

And finally, the historic right of a

5

plaintiff, which this Court has long recognized -- if

6

there is concurrent jurisdiction, the historic right of

7

a plaintiff to choose the forum in which to have their

8

claims adjudicated is preserved.

First off, Justice Scalia's

19

question about the 12(b)(1) dismissal motion.

Court, just a couple of terms ago in the Sinochem case,

21

said that the -- that a Federal court can answer

22

questions of Younger abstention before answering

23

questions of Article 3 abstention.

24

these, both the comity and TIA questions in this case,

25

are threshold non-merits questions that can be reached

And so both of

under -- under the Steel Company approach.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

questions are jurisdictional questions?

4

MR. MIZER:

No.

are jurisdictional; the point is that in Sinochem -- the

holding in Sinochem, for instance, was that -­

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What is the case you're

citing.

MR. MIZER:

It's Sinochem v. Malaysian --

that the -- the formula -­

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. MIZER:

Okay.

But the -- the holding was the

forum non conveniens doctrine can be addressed before

19

jurisdictional questions, and along the way the Court

20

said that Younger -- specifically said that Younger can

21

be answered before Article 3 standing.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay, fine.

It can be

23

answered before jurisdictional questions, but you moved

24

to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.

25

MR. MIZER:

Well -­

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And -- and that is not a

2

basis for dismissal here.

3

to state a claim, I guess, on which a Federal court can

4

grant relief.

5

The -- the basis is failure

But I -- anyway.

MR. MIZER:

Well, in any event, Your Honor,

6

we do submit that the Tax Injunction Act and the

7

jurisdictional doctrine which would prevail.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. MIZER:

That is so -- okay.

And on Justice Stevens' question

10

about the similarly situated or not similarly situated

11

nature of public utilities and nonpublic utilities,

12

Mr. Fitch has pointed to the continuing deregulation in

13

the wake of General Motors Corporation v. Tracy.

14

the Ohio Supreme Court just explained in the Columbia

15

Gas case that we cite in our brief, that continuing

16

deregulation does not change the -- the fundamental

17

holdings in Tracy:

18

burden imposed on a public utility to serve a captive

19

market, that makes that entity not similarly situated to

20

other entities.

21

But as

That when there is a regulatory

And the other point about Tracy and Columbia

22

Gas is that both of those challenges came up to this

of handling this case.

And so the State courts are perfectly capable

to order the exemption to be eliminated vis-à-vis -- or

5

to order them to have the exception?

6

that's a -- even in State court, that would not be a

remedy that could be ordered.

MR. MIZER:
Your Honor.

They are claiming

I disagree with that contention,
