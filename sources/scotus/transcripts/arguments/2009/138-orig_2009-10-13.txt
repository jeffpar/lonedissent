Mr. Frederick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
South Carolina seeks an equitable

12

apportionment with North Carolina of the Catawba River.

13

Both States act as parens patriae on behalf of all users

14

of the river within their boundaries.

15

For three reasons, this Court should not

16

adopt the Special Master's recommendation that

17

Charlotte, Duke, and the Catawba River Water Supply

18

Project be permitted to intervene as parties in this

19

original action:

20

First, the report articulates the wrong

21

legal test for intervention.

Second, under the New

22

Jersey v. New York standard, none of the three entities

23

should be permitted to intervene.

24

report's approach to intervention involves this Court in

25

deciding intramural disputes between and among water

And, third, the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

users in one State.

2

With respect to the first point, the Special

3

Master applied the wrong factors, we would submit, in

4

deciding whether or not a party or an intervenor should

5

be allowed to intervene as a party.

6

The Special Master sought to distill from

7

this Court's cases three principles that we would submit

8

are not the appropriate principles in deciding an

9

intervenor's status.

10

First, the report overemphasizes the, quote,

11

"direct stake," although the master found that the

12

equitable apportionment had no specific impact on

13

individual users of the water.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought your

15

friends agreed that the New Jersey v. New York standard

16

applied?

17

MR. FREDERICK:

Your Honor, part of what you

18

will be deciding in this case is the appropriate

19

standard for intervention, and the Special Master, we

20

respectfully submit, did not apply the New Jersey v. New

21

York factors.

22

cases, not the New Jersey v. New York case, the

23

principles that she thought should apply to govern an

24

intervenor's status, and those three principles, we

25

would submit, are incorrect.

Instead, the report distilled from other

Under the New Jersey v. New York standard,

2

the master did not make findings that would be

3

appropriate to determine the intervenor status here as

representation by either State to support any of the

6

intervenor’s request to participate as parties.

7

was no finding of a compelling interest in the sense

8

that it was truly compelling.

9

cases in -- where there is no case from this Court in

There was no finding of inadequate

There

It's hard to argue in

10

the equitable apportionment area that three intervenors

11

would have met the compelling interest standard here.

12

And, finally, the New York-New Jersey

13

standard talks about having interests that are apart

14

from other interests.

15

Catawba River Water Supply Project are simply acting on

16

behalf of all users of North Carolina water.

17

simply happen to be the largest ones.

18

But both Charlotte and the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They

Mr. Frederick, we -- we had

19

a case involving, what, a tax on -- on oil companies, in

20

which it was a State against State case, but we allowed

21

the oil companies who would pay the tax to intervene.
Now, why is that any different from this

22
23

case?
MR. FREDERICK:

First, the interests were

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why does that make any

difference?
MR. FREDERICK:

This Court has said for 200

5

years that water is a unique resource within the

6

sovereign control of States.

7

In the Maryland case, the Court permitted

8

intervention in a situation in which Louisiana had sued

9

the pipeline companies in Louisiana State court for a

10

declaratory judgment that its tax was constitutional.

11

There was also a pending FERC action in Federal court in

12

Louisiana raising the same issue, so when Maryland and

13

eight other States who were not parens patriae of the

14

various pipeline companies who sought to intervene filed

15

the original action, I think the Court appropriately

16

considered that interests of judicial efficiency called

17

for handling the Commerce Clause challenge in the

18

original action in this case.

19

And finally, the Court only devoted two

20

sentences of its opinion and didn't cite the New Jersey

21

v. -- New York v. New Jersey case in acting on the

22

intervention.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, well, these – these

24

are rules that we are making up ourselves, right, as to

25

when we are going to allow intervention or not?

1

is there any case -- I think there isn't, but tell me if

2

I'm wrong -- is there any case in which we have rejected

3

intervention that has been recommended by the Special

4

Master?

5

MR. FREDERICK:

I don't think I can recall a

6

case in that factual scenario, but I can point you to

7

Kentucky v. Indiana in 1930, in which this Court

8

rejected Kentucky's attempt to join individual Indiana

9

citizens as parties in an original action over

10

Indiana's alleged breach of a contract to build an

11

interstate bridge.

12

And the reason --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I understand your

13

basic argument that each State should represent its own

14

constituents.

15

Project in a different category?

16

both States, and I think it can reasonably fear that it

17

would be treated as a stepchild by both States.

18

But isn't the Catawba River Water Supply

MR. FREDERICK:

Because it straddles

No, in fact,

19

Mr. Chief Justice, I would submit they have the weakest

20

claim to intervention in this case.

21

Their argument, fundamentally, is that Union

22

County, North Carolina, which is the North Carolina part

23

of the joint venture with the Lancaster Water District,

24

should be permitted to have water purchased from the

25

South Carolina side of the boundary.

16

Carolina water users that they are seeking to protect --

17

Those are adequately protected, we

So in effect the Union County, North Carolina,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, except that these --

18

these three entities are the principal entities that are

19

guilty of interbasin transfers, which is essentially

20

what the -- what the dispute is about.

21

MR. FREDERICK:

The dispute is about the

22

transfer of water and consumption of water in toto.

23

Court --

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The

Well, but the focus -- the

focus of the complaint is upon interbasin transfers,
8
Alderson Reporting Company

2

isn't it?
MR. FREDERICK:

The focus of the complaint

3

highlights interbasin transfers to the extent that they

4

are a large quantifiable amount of water being taken out

5

of the Catawba River, that we submit should not be

6

counted on --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Exactly.

And these three

8

entities account for a very large proportion of those

9

interbasin transfers.

Isn't it the case that any -- any

10

decision by -- by this Court on -- on this question will

11

necessarily impact directly these three entities?

12

MR. FREDERICK:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. FREDERICK:

No.
Why not?
Because in an equitable

15

apportionment case, this Court decides which share of

16

the water is allocable to each State.

17

of State law how each State shall determine the

18

intrastate allocations of the water.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is a question

So --

I understand that, but I'm

20

talking about the real world.

21

Carolina has to cut back, and if indeed the opinion of

22

this Court says that it's taking too much because of

23

interbasin transfers, as a practical matter these three

24

entities are going to be out of luck.

MR. FREDERICK:

Honor, as this Court's cases direct us, and those cases

tell us that in situations where the Court is deciding

an equitable apportionment between two States -- water,

of course, is fungible.

6

They all divine from the State itself.

7

It's a series of molecules that

So if North Carolina, in its exercise of

8

parens patriae responsibility, determines that Charlotte

9

should have a larger share than what it currently has,

10

that's a decision for Charlotte -- for North Carolina as

11

a political entity to decide among its users.

12

not necessarily implicate this Court's action in an

13

equitable apportionment to say that what the Court will

14

ultimately decide is what Charlotte's share is.

15

not what we are seeking, and that's not what an

16

injunction from this Court equitably apportioning the

17

Catawba River would necessarily decide.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It does

That is

Are you -Mr. Frederick, if this

20

were an ordinary civil case, we would be guided by the

21

rule on permissive intervention, and appellate courts in

22

dealing with that rule give a healthy measure of respect

23

to the trial judge's determination.

24
25

So even though the civil rules are not
binding in original jurisdiction cases, isn't that a
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sound approach that we should adopt?

2

appeals would defer to a district judge's decision, so

3

we should give a healthy measure of deference to the

4

Special Master's evaluation that this will be useful.

5

MR. FREDERICK:

Just as a court of

No, for several reasons,

6

Justice Ginsburg.

First, in any appellate review

7

Situation, this Court would review de novo the legal

8

test that would be applied.

9

the master applied and articulated the wrong legal test.

Our initial submission is

10

So you would first need to determine, we would submit,

11

what is the correct legal test for submission.

12

a de novo review standard.

13

That is

But secondly, the Court has said in numerous

14

original cases it does not apply deference, although it

15

gives appropriate respect to special masters, and so

16

there would be no basis for applying a deference

17

standard to a special master ruling on a question of law

18

that fundamentally is about what this Court's original

19

jurisdiction under Article III is supposed to be about.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But, in fact, we've never

21

rejected a special master's desire to -- to have

22

intervenors in the case.

23
24
25

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, virtually every case,

Justice Scalia -JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that oil case that I

11

I forget the name of it.

MR. FREDERICK:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

The tax --

Maryland v. Louisiana.
Yes.

What had the Special

Master recommended in that case?

MR. FREDERICK:

There was actually no

6

special master recommendation in that case.

7

The Court

Virtually all of the cases that we cited in
the blue brief highlight the fact that special masters

10

routinely reject motions to intervene.

11

situation in which a special master would allow

12

intervention.

13

It is the rare

And the only example that the other side can

14

come up with is the Nebraska v. Wyoming case, in which

15

finally Basin Electric, after 10 years of participating

16

in the original action as an amicus, was allowed to

17

intervene because the Special Master viewed there to be

18

tension between the State of Nebraska's interest and

19

that that Basin Electric was seeking to vindicate.

20

--

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You

Mr. Frederick, can we go

22

back a little?

I think you just said there was no

23

special master's recommendation in

24

Maryland v. Louisiana, but I'm looking at page 745.

25

the footnote 21, it said:

In

"The master recommended that

4

5

MR. FREDERICK:

And then it says:

"It is not

And the case that it cited

6

is Oklahoma v. Texas, which is a very unusual case from

7

this Court's docket in the 1920s.

8

9

Colorado case was that in situations involving

What the Court

10

interstate allocations of water, the claimants or users

11

of a State are deemed to be represented by the State.

12

The case on which the Court relied in the Maryland case

13

was back into an old era in which it was unclear whether

14

States acting as parens patriae had the responsibility

15

to act on behalf of all claimants or users of water.

16

The Maryland case, as I said before, did not

17

analyze the New Jersey v. New York factors, and I would

18

submit that in light of the other circumstances of the

19

case, the fact that it was a Commerce Clause challenge

20

involving Federal, State, and private companies, in

21

which there was multiple litigation pending in various

22

forums, it was an exercise of the Court's decision to

23

efficiently decide the Commerce Clause challenge to

24

allow those pipeline companies in, where some of those

25

pipeline companies were not represented by States that
13
Alderson Reporting Company

question about whether there was a recommendation from

opinion in Maryland v. Louisiana, Justice Ginsburg.

that you've actually addressed the operative question of

14

presence of a party to do equity, which is what I read

15

the Special Master to be suggesting.

16

three biggest users of water, at least one of them

17

straddles both States, another has a potential license.

18

And so that each of them has a different situation than

These are the

Well, let's start with the

original jurisdiction principle.

Those are actions that

are brought invoking this Court's original jurisdiction,

2

which this Court could sit without a special master

3

and would decide the matter as it sits as a court of

6

actions of that person delegated that responsibility

7

with something akin to the deference given to district

8

judges in making various fact findings.

9

The fact that it appoints a special master to

Secondly, on a question of law, as

10

intervention fundamentally is -- and ultimately we are

11

talking about the scope and contours of this Court's

12

exercise of original jurisdiction -- what the Court has

13

said is that there are two interests that are ultimately

14

being protected:

15

State acting in its sovereign capacity on a subject,

16

water, that quintessentially is sovereign; and it is

17

doing so for judicial efficiency purposes, because it

18

allows the Court to expect each State to represent

19

adequately all of the users of water in that State.

20

One is the dignity interest of the

So, for those reasons, we think that a

21

special master recommendation ought to be reviewed with

22

the same level of scrutiny that all other aspects of a

23

special master’s --

that the private party has is a State law property

interest in water, and that’s an interest that simply

18

The only thing that this Court is deciding is what share

just -- you know, they are just Joe Dokes is –- is

7

really very unrealistic.

8

MR. MILLER:

Well, to the -- I mean, to the

9

extent that they have valuable information to provide,

10

third-party discovery can take account of that, as can

11

amicus participation.

12

for parties that have information or a special

13

perspective on the case to present an amicus submission

14

to the Special Master or to this Court.

15

that -- that's not a basis for allowing them to become

16

full parties through intervention.

17

It would be entirely appropriate

And it's -- but

And then, to the extent that there's a

18

concern about the management of this case, I think it's

19

important to keep in mind that the rule recommended by

20

the Special Master and the rule that the would-be

21

intervenors are urging this Court to adopt would, of

22

course, apply not just in this litigation, but in every

23

equitable apportionment action.

24

make the litigation of those actions much more difficult

25

to have additional non-State parties in, but it makes it

And not only does it

2

much more difficult for those cases to be settled.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, if that -- if and

3

when that is the case, the Special Master will not want

4

them to come in, as the vast majority of special masters

5

have not wanted them to come in, in the past.

6

think that's going to change.

7

MR. MILLER:

I don't

I -- I guess what I would

8

say is that I don't think that, either in the

9

recommendation of the Special Master in this case or in

10

the submissions of the -- the would-be intervenors, that

11

there’s really any logical limiting principle that

12

would not allow, as a matter of routine, large water

13

users to come in to equitable apportionment actions.

14

And that's inappropriate for the more

15

fundamental reason that these original actions in this

16

Court are not ordinary cases.

17

sitting in judgment between two sovereigns is one of the

18

most grave -- grave and delicate responsibilities the

19

Court has, and it’s a sparingly exercised jurisdiction

20

reserved for the most serious of issues, issues of such

21

importance that, if the States were independent

22

countries, would be resolved through treaties or --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This Court has said that

2

3

MR. MILLER:

Yes.

And when a State brings

4

such an action or seeks to bring such an action, it

5

can't simply file a complaint as of right.

6

seek this Court's permission to file the complaint.

7

this Court can review the complaint at that time and

8

look at who the parties are and figure out whether it's

9

an appropriate case for the exercise of this Court's

10

11

appropriate way to proceed, making that determination at

12

the outset on the basis of the State's complaint, rather

13

than through piecemeal litigation as different non-State

14

parties --

15

And that, in our view, is a much more

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, here the complaint

16

was South Carolina's complaint, and these are

17

intervenors on North Carolina's -- on North Carolina's

18

side.

19

MR. MILLER:

That's where they were seeking

20

to intervene on North Carolina's side as defendants.

21

That's right.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And as representing the

23

position of the United States, would you address the

24

FERC license that Duke Energy is raising?

25

MR. MILLER:

Yes, Your Honor.
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Under section

Official

1

27 of the Federal Power Act, which is 16 U.S.C. 821, the

2

Power Act does not affect State law water rights.

3

State law water rights are taken as a given, and it's up

4

to the licensee to have the necessary State water

rights, and a FERC license does not in any way alter the

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:

Well, South Carolina and

the United States present this vision of an equitable

divides up the flow of the river, and then it's up to

19

each State to subdivide among its users.

20

But that is not what has happened in

21

equitable apportionment cases.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And North Carolina,

just have to do what citizens do all the time, which is

get as much water as they can; and, two, when they get

It's not just that it’s

22

-- it’s a big interest, and it surely is, but they are

23

singled out in South Carolina's complaint, and

24

injunctive relief is sought against them, which, I

25

think, brings into the play the rule this Court
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

announced in Kentucky v. Indiana, which is that, if a

2

plaintiff or plaintiff State in an original action is

3

seeking relief against a citizen of a State, that

4

citizen ought to have an opportunity to come into the

5

litigation and defend its interests.

6

That's what Charlotte is seeking in this

7

case.

The joint venture, of course, is not represented

8

by either State fully because both States are hostile to

9

at least part of what the joint venture does.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let's say the

11

interest -- the dispute is really in effect between

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No -- well, of course –Do we let them just

17

use the States as, you know, a façade to get into

18

this Court and have their dispute adjudicated here?
MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:

19

No.

As in Kentucky v.

20

Indiana, if there are improper parties in original

21

action, they -- they can be dismissed, but I think it's

22

noteworthy that the Court allowed the New Jersey

23

litigation to proceed with New York City as a party

24

defendant.

25

And Charlotte's position is truly
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

indistinguishable from the position of -- of New York

2

City in that action, with -- with the sole exception

3

that Charlotte seeks to intervene, whereas New York City

4

was named as a party defendant.

5

South Carolina invokes the principle that it

6

is the master of its complaint, and we would agree with

7

that, in part.

8

allegations in claims it seeks to make, but a plaintiff

9

is not a master of the universe of -- of interests that

A plaintiff is the master of the

10

-- that may be affected by the lawsuit they have -- they

11

have brought.

12

That’s --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you think the same --

13

the same test applies to the appropriateness of naming a

14

private party defendant, as you would urge for

15

intervention by a private party defendant?

16

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:

Yes.

I think there would

17

be a very similar analysis.

18

whether a proposed defendant -- and of course, you need

19

I think that the question

leave from this Court to file an original action or to

20

name someone as a defendant in an original action.

21

think, in both cases, it raises the question:

22

this entity a proper party defendant or is the entity a

23

proper

24

intervenor?

25

I think it's a similar analysis.

Stevens:

The -- the complaint prays for North Carolina

They are the parties who are carrying

Wouldn’t it – would

it be surprising if the Special Master recommended that

all the issue that she was going to address was the

and South Carolina, and even though South Carolina

19

wanted an injunction directed against the City of

22

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:

North Carolina

I think it would not be

23

surprising if she came down -- if she were to come down

24

with a decree, it would not be surprising that -- that

25

it would decide whether or not to allow Charlotte's
41
Alderson Reporting Company

1

interbasin transfers to continue.

2

Because that's -- that was much like what

3

was decided, for example, in New Jersey v. New York.

4

There was the proposed diversion of water to New York

5

City, and the Court there ultimately entered a partial

6

injunction that banned flows to New York City above a

7

certain level.

8
9

So --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, in -- in deciding

what's equitable as between the two States, I guess the

10

-- the Court, ultimately, and the Special Master,

11

initially, will have to decide what uses of water by one

12

State or the other are not equitable uses --

17

massive uses are appropriate or not.

18

So I don't see how you could decide the

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:

Not just massive.

19

There's -- it's no accident that South Carolina focuses

20

upon these interbasin transfers, because they inflict a

21

special injury, in South Carolina's view.

22

The interbasin transfers take water out of

enough that South Carolina seeks a specific injunction

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR. BROWNING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Let me turn to two questions that Justice
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Scalia asked Mr. Frederick, but I think his response

2

needs clarification from North Carolina's perspective.

3

The first question dealt with Maryland v.

4

Louisiana, and Mr. Frederick responded that that case,

5

in which 17 pipeline companies were permitted to

6

intervene -- according to Mr. Frederick, the States in

7

that case did not serve as parens patriae with regard to

8

those 17 pipeline companies.

9

incorrect.

That is factually

In that case, two of those pipeline

10

companies -- the Michigan-Wisconsin Pipeline Company was

11

a resident of the State of Michigan, one of the

12

complaining States in that case, as well as the National

13

Gas Pipeline Company of America was an Illinois

14

corporation.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Maryland v.

16

Louisiana involved a specific tax on specific companies,

17

and they were allowed to intervene.

18

This is a question of how the equitable apportionment of

19

the water is going to be, and North Carolina can do with

20

the water whatever it will.

21
22
23

This is not that.

It strikes me as very different than
Maryland v. Louisiana.
MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, in Maryland v.

24

Louisiana, that was a taxation case, a case that goes to

25

a fundamental interest of the States, the power of
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

taxation.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did -- did the decree only

3

apply to taxing these particular companies?

4

-- could the State have taxed other companies after the

5

decree issued?

6

MR. BROWNING:

Could the

Yes, Your Honor, as the

7

Plaintiff States were seeking to attack the Louisiana

8

tax at issue.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13
14
15
16
17

As -- as the

allocation would in this case, presumably.

11
12

So it would have general applicability.

MR. BROWNING:

Well, I don’t -- and that

question -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is that yes or no?

I --

you say yes, it would have general applicability.
MR. BROWNING:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes,

Justice Scalia.
Your Honor, South Carolina has said that

18

this case is about consumption of water in toto.

19

when you look at their bill of complaint, that is simply

20

not the case.

21

in their leave for -- their motion for leave to file a

22

bill of complaint, it starts out whether North

23

Carolina's interbasin transfer statute is invalid under

24

the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.

25

And when you look at the allegations in the bill of

But

2

transfers.

4

interbasin transfers.

5

We --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, how is just this

6

involved?

Is there -- because I am amazed that this is

7

now coming to me for the first time.

8

about is interbasin transfers and that you account for

9

100 percent of them, you three.

10

right?

11

might tell me it's not right.

All this case is

Is that -- is that

Because I suspect in, like, 5 minutes, somebody

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, there are --

14

there are very few interbasin transfers.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

I -- that's not my

question.

17

MR. BROWNING:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Yes.

I want -- I’m trying –-

19

look, if Alaska sued California and the complaint was we

20

want San Francisco back, San Francisco might have a

21

right to intervene.

22

generally, maybe they wouldn't.

23

But if it was about California

So what I want to know is, what's the water

24

that is at issue in this complaint and how much of the

25

water that is at issue in this complaint do the three
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

intervenors account for?

That seems like a fairly

2

simple empirical question.

3

MR. BROWNING:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

Yes.
That's what I'm trying to

get the answer to.

6

MR. BROWNING:

Yes, Your Honor.

The -- the

7

two intervenors that have interbasin transfers account

8

for the vast majority of the water that is consumed as a

9

result of an interbasin transfer.

10

In the 2006 study that was done by Duke

11

Energy, the largest interbasin transfer is the City of

12

Charlotte at 9 million gallons per day.

13

The second --

Counsel, my basic

14

concern is that -- and I will let you finish if there is

15

more to the answer.

original jurisdiction was more important than yours, and

6

You are not incapable of protecting

Duke negotiated, over a period of several

12

years, a comprehensive relicensing agreement, with

13

various agencies of North Carolina, various agencies of

14

South Carolina, and stakeholders up and down this river.

15

As a result of that negotiated agreement,

16

there was -- the CRA was put in place, which is

17

essentially a request that FERC issue a license in

18

accordance with the provisions of that agreement.

19

That agreement would set a minimum flow of

20

water into South Carolina that is much, much higher than

21

the previous license.

16

to have a flow of water that is much higher than is set

out in the CRA.

Carolina is receiving much more water under this

negotiated agreement than they could ever hope to

achieve in an equitable apportionment action.

The fact of the matter is that these

entities have unique interests, and with respect to two

of those interests -- Duke Energy and the Catawba River

Water Supply Project -- their interests are not

All three of them have been expressly

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

10
11

MR. FREDERICK:
Mr. Chief Justice.

12
13

Thank you, counsel.

I have four points,

First --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Tell me, are you seeking

injunctive relief out of any of the three intervenors?

14

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

We seek an injunction

15

enjoining the interbasin transfer statute to the extent

16

it exceeds North Carolina's equitable apportionment.

17

are here to get our fair share of the river vis-à-vis

18

North Carolina.
And Duke's CRA application expressly

19
20

disclaims any -- any ability to go into the interbasin

21

transfer.

22

for leave to file exceptions.

23

We

That's at page 20, footnote 14, of our motion

The FERC has said it will not affect, in

24

giving its license, the equitable apportionment action

now pending before you.

1

In Duke's CRA, at paragraph 39.9, it says it

2

does not affect State water uses.

So the only issue

3

here is whether or not those expressed disclaimers

4

should be given effect when South Carolina is simply

5

seeking to determine, as between the two States, the

6

rights.

MR. FREDERICK:

The license hasn't been

It's still pending.

And that's what FERC has before it, and FERC

14

has said that the CRA will not affect what license is

issued, but I want to go back to a fundamental --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you willing to

17

concede that if whatever you ask for here affects that

18

license, once its issued, that then Duke's

19

intervention is proper?

20

MR. FREDERICK:

No, because the United

21

States can enter -- can affect the interests and

22

represent the interests of its licensees.

23

Duke's interest is completely derivative of

24

the United States' power to confer a license on an

25

energy producer.

And the United States here is saying,

no, they should not be allowed to intervene.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought Duke said the

problem is not the United States -- so much the United

4

States granting a license.

5

requested was based upon a negotiated agreement among a

6

number of entities, and that agreement goes out the

7

window once -- on the basis of this lawsuit.

The agreement is a private

contract among various water users, and it is no

different than the fact that all users of this river

11

decree this Court issues, whether they are on the South

13

Carolina side or the North Carolina side.
