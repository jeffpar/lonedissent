ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

We ask the Court in this case to take no new

11

ground beyond that established just last term in the

12

Melendez-Diaz case, but the stakes of this case are

13

high.

14

hold that a State may impose on the defendant the

15

burden of calling a prosecution witness to the stand,

16

it would severely impair the confrontation right and

17

threaten a fundamental transformation in the way

18

Anglo-American trials have been conducted for hundreds

19

of years.

20

If the Court were to reverse Melendez-Diaz and

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The State court has

21

interpreted their provision to give the defendant the

22

choice of subpoenaing the witness or asking the State

23

to bring in the witness.

24

Melendez-Diaz?

25

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Why is that overruling

Your Honor, the -- the State
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

courts, since the time of this case -- since the time

2

that these cases were tried, raised the possibility of

3

asking the -- that the defendant could ask the witness

4

to bring -- that the defendant could ask the

5

prosecution to bring in the witness.

6

really change anything from a straight subpoena

7

statute in any -- in either event.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. FRIEDMAN:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

Well, how is that

different from a notice statute?

10

It doesn't

If --

Okay.
If we take the statute

as the State supreme court has read it --

13

MR. FRIEDMAN:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.
-- they say:

In my

15

mind, it's a notice statute; tell the prosecutor you

16

either want them to call the witness or you subpoena

17

the witness.

18

Whether or not you had notice of that interpretation

19

is a separate question.

20

MR. FRIEDMAN:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22
23

That's what the State court has told us.

That -Let's separate out the

two questions.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Okay, fine, fine.

The -- the

24

two aspects that Melendez-Diaz said were wrong with

25

the subpoena statute are both present in this statute

even as interpreted by the -- by the State supreme

2

court.

3

sorry, nothing in the Magruder case -- the opinion

4

here suggests that the prosecution would bear the

5

burden of calling the witness to the stand.

6

the Magruder case, the decision of the State supreme

7

court is very explicit and goes in accordance --

Sure.
Would swearing the

24

25

unconstitutional about that, given our case law that

admissible once the witness is on the stand or

constitutionally admissible once they are on the

beyond simply saying "Is this your" --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, no, no.

"Should" is

a different question than the one I asked.

14

MR. FRIEDMAN:

No.

I mean, I think the

15

Constitution -- I think constitutionally, the -- the

16

prosecution would be compelled at least to ask:

17

is your recollection?

18

But even if that's not true --

Do you endorse this statement?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

What

Do you have anything

historically or in any case that would suggest that

JUSTICE ALITO:

19

your answer to these questions is.

20

prosecution does is call the analyst on the stand and

21

admit -- have the analyst provide a foundation for the

22

admission of the report, let's say, pursuant to the

23

hearsay exception for recorded recollection, and does

24

nothing more, would there be a Confrontation Clause

25

problem?

It's not clear to me what

9
Alderson Reporting Company

If all the

1

MR. FRIEDMAN:

And there’s -- there’s the

2

question, “Is this your report?

3

Then -- then I don't think there is a Confrontation

4

Clause problem, because -- because the prosecution has

5

put the witness on the stand, has asked those

6

questions, and then the witness -- and --

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you stand by it?”

What's the difference

8

between that situation and the situation in which the

9

report is -- is admitted, subject to -- and the

10

analyst is available, and the defense can question the

11

analyst if the defense wishes to?

12

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I think -- I think the

13

difference is that once you ask the question -- “Do

14

you stand by it?” -- then the witness has testified

15

one way or another.

16

bears the risk that the witness will not testify in

17

accordance with the prior statement.

18

And the prosecution, as I say,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

California --

On the past recollection

19

recorded, the witness doesn't stand by the statement.

20

The witness says:

23

I made the statement,

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's right.

I take

24

California v. Green at its word.

California v. Green

25

says and Owen follows up and says that if the witness
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

does not testify in accordance with the prior

2

statement, then the defendant has had some of the --

3

has had considerable benefit of cross-examination

4

already.

5

put the witness through that pace to make sure that

6

that happens.

7
8
9

So -- so the prosecution has to -- has to

Beyond that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:
just said.

I don't understand what you

Want to say it again?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

California v. Green

10

says that if the witness testifies inconsistently with

11

the prior statement, that the defendant has had the

12

benefit of cross-examination in showing the

13

inconsistency.

14

the difference, and I'm saying a difference, one

15

difference is, that if the witness does not testify in

16

accordance with the prior statement, that's apparent

17

to -- that's apparent to the jury.

18

the practical differences that we emphasize.

19

So -- so Justice Alito asked me what’s

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There are also all

You are asking us now to

20

state something that you admit is in really no

21

constitutional case or historical case, that says the

22

right to confrontation means that the witness has to

23

tell the story, and the form of telling that story has

24

to be a verbal recitation; it can't be past recorded

25

recollection because you just said they have to tell
11

the story.

2

anything else, because it has to be their story.

3

4

It can't be based on official documents or

MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, I don't believe so.

Am I

I'm

5

saying that the -- that the witness has to take the

6

stand, has to -- has to testify live, viva voce, face

7

to face, in the time-honored phrases which have always

8

governed testimony in an Anglo-American trial.

9

the -- I think the witness has to at least be asked

10

what happened.

11

then the prior statement may be introduced.

12

--

If the witness says, I don't recall,

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the -I’m not asking the Court to

go beyond anything that has previously been said.
JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the theory of this?

17

I understand in hearsay, which as we have just seen

18

demonstrated, is very complicated, filled with all

19

kinds of rules --

Confrontation Clause, I would have thought, would have

2

picked out the heart of that.

3

Raleigh and Sir Walter Raleigh says, "Bring in

4

witnesses," which they wouldn't.

5

say what this clause is about is Sir Walter Raleigh?

6

MR. FRIEDMAN:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

So we have Sir Walter

So why shouldn't we

Well, if -Bring in the witnesses.

8

Now, once you bring them in, the defendant can do what

9

he wants.

He has had his chance to cross-examine

10

them.

End of the matter, and leave the rest up to the

11

hearsay law.

12

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I want to emphasize that the

13

Confrontation Clause is about a lot more -- there were

14

nearly 200 years of history between Walter Raleigh and

15

the Confrontation Clause, and what was established is

16

that in an Anglo-American trial witnesses give their

17

testimony live, face to face, and Melendez-Diaz

18

emphasized last term you can't prove the case via an

19

affidavit.

20

So -- so it's -- it's the fundamental

21

question that -- that Crawford establishes --

22

fundamental principle that Crawford establishes is

23

this is the way witnesses testify in our trials:

24

live, in front of the jury, subject to oath and then

25

cross-exam.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why -- and -- I trust

2

the trial process, and much of your brief was talking

3

about that process --

4

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Right.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- and the fact that

6

it's much more effective when the witness tells their

7

story and you get a chance to cross-examine than if

8

you have to start from the platform of

9

cross-examination.

Once a defendant makes it known

10

that a -- he's going to cross-examine a lab

11

technician, don't you think that in the vast majority

12

of cases the prosecutor is going to put that witness

13

on?

14

MR. FRIEDMAN:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -And if he does or

16

doesn't, why shouldn't we leave it to the normal trial

17

strategy and practice to leave to that prosecutor the

18

burden of non-persuasion, which is what confrontation

19

was about?

20

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Right.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

Which is --

If -- if the prosecutor is

23

certain that the defendant is going to put the witness

24

on the stand, then -- then the prosecutor has some

25

reason to -- to put the witness on first.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

The problem

Official

1

is that the -- the defunct Virginia statute puts the

2

burden on the defendant of bringing the witness in,

3

and the defense --

4
5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -- well, I was

starting from a different proposition than you did --

6

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Right.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

that’s a question for your adversaries:

9

have known --

10

MR. FRIEDMAN:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

I'm sorry -- but --

-- because I think

Right.
-- that you should have

asked the State to bring that witness in?

13

But putting that aside --

14

MR. FRIEDMAN:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16
17

How could you

But --- assume we are reading

it the way the Court has now.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Right.

The -- the fact is

18

that under the Virginia statute, given -- and as

19

interpreted by the Commonwealth, too -- given that the

20

defendant has the burden of putting the witness on the

21

stand, defendants rarely exercise that right, because

22

it's a corrupted right, because it isn't nearly as

23

valuable, as I think Your Honor understands, as the

24

right to stand up and cross-examine a witness who has

25

actually just testified.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

I don't think that the right given by the

2

Virginia statute is -- the former Virginia statute is

3

actually the right to cross-examine.

4

cross-examination, and it's not in substance

5

cross-examination.

6

the defendant's own, and that's the way -- that's the

7

way the statute is -- is worded.

8
9

It's not in form

It's a right to make the witness

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Friedman, one of the

problems that has been brought up is that this is an

10

inordinate expense, and you're wasting the time of the

11

analyst.

12

that the analyst could testify from the lab, have

13

video conferencing, and so the analyst, while the

14

prosecutor must call her, can testify from the lab

15

instead of coming down to the courthouse?

16

Do you recognize any economy -- for example,

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That -- that is a --

17

certainly a possibility, at least on consent of the

18

defendant, and some States, including my own State of

19

Michigan, has been experimenting with that.

20

think that's a plausible possibility.

And I

21

Now, if the defendant were to insist on --

22

on live testimony, that is an open -- that's an open

23

question as to whether video testimony would be

24

acceptable.

25

transmit to Congress a proposed amendment to Federal

This Court some years ago refused to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the majority in a

2

statement by Justice Scalia said there is a virtual

3

satisfaction of the confrontation right, not a real

4

satisfaction.

5

So the matter as to whether it could be done

6

without consent hasn't been satisfied -- hasn't been

7

determined.

8

many cases I believe the defendants -- that those

9

defendants who do want confrontation would be

perfectly willing to accept video.

JUSTICE ALITO:

How can you say that?

We

16

have an amicus brief from 26 States plus the District

17

of Columbia arguing exactly the contrary.

18

MR. FRIEDMAN:

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, I

--

They say that there is a

20

very substantial category of cases in which defendants

21

really have no interest whatsoever in contesting

22

either the nature or the quantity of drugs involved,

23

but they will refuse to stipulate to those things

24

simply for the purpose of putting a financial burden

25

on the prosecution, because they know, if they do
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that, it may be helpful for them in getting a better

2

plea bargain, plus there is a certain risk that the

3

analyst will not show up, and they will get the

4

benefit of that.

5

MR. FRIEDMAN:

So, Your Honor, I think that

6

what the -- the States' amicus brief shows is that

7

there are -- there are a lot of drug prosecutions, and

8

there are a lot of drug analyses, and then there is

9

this speculation about the type of gamesmanship that

10

you have mentioned.

11

there is nothing supporting that.

12

But if we look for hard data,

So let's look at a couple of jurisdictions

13

is, if a laboratory is so organized so that six or

If I am -- and that's an issue that will

be presented to the Court, we can be pretty certain.

I think that issue is entirely orthogonal to the issue

is because floating in the back of my mind is -- is if

6

-- (a) does the Confrontation Clause apply?

7

MR. FRIEDMAN:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Right.
And if the answer to (a) is

yes, then are there different kinds of implementation

10

rules in different areas where there are other signs

11

of security, where there are other reasons for

12

thinking it's not bad testimony?

13

something that’s necessarily workable, and -- but I

14

brought it up to try to think about it.

15

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

That line is not

I think -- I think it's

16

an interesting question, and it’s question 3 in the

17

evidence exam that I am just grading, in fact.

18

think that’s an issue that the Court will have to

19

resolve.

20

But I

And, as I say, my views are what they --

21

what they are, but if you reject my views on that, it

22

doesn't change this case whatsoever.

24

how fundamental a transformation in the Anglo-American

impairment of the ability to examine.

17

It's an enormous impact,

In

practice, it is -- if the defendant said, I don't want

to cross-examine, but I still insist that the witness

20

get up on the stand and let's see what the witness can

do -- and the Commonwealth makes no attempt to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McCULLOUGH

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9
10

MR. McCULLOUGH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

I think an appropriate place to start would

12

be how the Supreme Court of Virginia construed the

13

statute and get past that and into the confrontation

14

issue.

15

The first thing I would note there is that

16

the Petitioners simply have not challenged the

17

decision of the -- the interpretation of the Supreme

18

Court of Virginia that it placed on the statute.

19

think, to the extent that they are now, for the first

20

time in their reply brief, trying to raise a separate

21

due process issue, that the construction of the court

22

was so unreasonable that it violates due process, it's

I think the -- the way the

7

Supreme Court of Virginia construed the statute is

perfectly sensible.

9

What it says -- and the key

10

excuse me -- "such witnesses shall be summoned and

12

some statutes that say the defendant shall subpoena or

13

shall summon -- for example, like the Idaho and the

appeal.

I think it was incumbent on

18

counsel to raise the issue exactly like counsel for

19

the defendant did in the Grant case.

20

noteworthy that in the Grant case the -- the motion

21

was filed well in advance of trial, on November 2nd,

22

2007, before the Supreme Court of Virginia ever

23

construed the statute in this fashion.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I ask you:

If we

5

to, that would take care of the fears of your

6

adversary that trials would become trials by

7

affidavit, that the -- that prosecutors will choose to

8

put all witnesses on -- by videotape, by affidavit, by

9

deposition, whatever mode they choose except bringing

10

them into court -- and forcing defendants then to call

11

the witnesses and do a what's -- what I call a

12

cold-cross?

13

What rule would we announce in this case --

14

MR. McCULLOUGH:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think --- that would avoid --

16

what constitutional construction of the Confrontation

17

Clause would we issue that would protect against that?

18

MR. McCULLOUGH:

I think there are several

19

constitutional, legal, and practical considerations

20

that make this -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21
22
23

practical.

No, no.

Forget the

Talk about the legal, constitutional.
MR. McCULLOUGH:

Right.

Constitutionally,

24

there are two obstacles to a wholesale type of trial

25

system where the prosecution would simply present a
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

stack of affidavits.

2

The first of those is the Due Process

3

Clause, which -- for example, in these child witness

4

cases, what a number of courts have held is that it's

5

going to inflame the jury against the defendant if a

6

videotape is introduced and then the defendant is

7

called -- forced to call the witness to the stand.

8

And that's simply not the case with these types of

9

witness.

10
11
12
13

So the Due Process Clause itself puts the

brakes on the type of wholesale at-trial -JUSTICE SCALIA:

They're trial witnesses.

Anything else?
MR. McCULLOUGH:

Another is the fact that

14

under the Confrontation Clause, the cross-examination

15

has to be effective.

16

day of trial dumps a series of affidavits on the

17

defense, it's going to be pretty difficult for the

18

defense to be in a position to effectively

19

cross-examine.

20

And so if the prosecution on the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, just one or two.

Just

21

one or two affidavits.

Or it -- the court has a rule

22

you have to provide those affidavits several weeks

23

before trial.

That would be okay?

24

MR. McCULLOUGH:

I think, under the --

I don't think the

7

I think the key to the Confrontation Clause,

8

what this Court has said for a long time, turning to

9

the history of the clause, is that it's designed to

10

protect the reliability of the government's evidence.

11

And the way it does that is by subjecting that to the

12

crucible of cross-examination, face to face, of live

13

witnesses.

14

that is, the defendant says he wants the witness there

For example, if the --

Do you have a case?

that when it is the defendant who has to take the

21

they come.

Imagine we have Sir Walter Raleigh at

do we do about that?

They weren't cross-examined, and

2

how did they get in here?

3

MR. McCULLOUGH:

I think your question goes

4

to the very heart of why we have the Confrontation

5

Clause.

6

of proof that our modern trials have.

7

thing that makes this case conceptually difficult is

8

we are so accustomed to this clean order of

presentation -- that -- that that's how we have all

It wasn't because of this formalistic order
And -- and one

tried our cases, that's how we are used to seeing

11

them, but that's not the heart of the Confrontation

The Confrontation Clause is because, for
example, the colonists were subject to anonymous --

JUSTICE BREYER:

As I read this statute, it

does let in that piece of paper.

17

MR. McCULLOUGH:

It does.

But --

analogy, isn't the statute bad?

MR. McCULLOUGH:

Well, because --

you have some special kind -- I mean, you’d have to

some special -- specially reliable evidence that sort

of fell within the Confrontation Clause but not

25

totally.

that, the harder that one is to do.

that make this procedure certainly more appropriate,

8

and one of those is, these -- what -- functionally

what you are doing when you have this witness on the

10

stand is either past recollection recorded or past

11

recollection refreshed, because they are doing

13

are largely fungible things like -- like crack cocaine

or powder cocaine.

15

of scenario where --

16

They

And so we're miles from the type

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, to put my chips on

17

the table, which you probably understand, I thought

18

the reliability of this evidence in the mine run of

19

cases was such, and the distance from Sir Walter

20

Raleigh was sufficiently great, that it fell outside

21

the scope of the Confrontation Clause for those two

22

reasons, but mine was a dissenting opinion.

23

MR. McCULLOUGH:

Right.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, therefore, what do I

25

I --

do?
41
Alderson Reporting Company

(Laughter.)

2

MR. McCULLOUGH:

Well, I think, though, even

3

-- even going back to the very heart -- the historical

4

heart of this clause, the problems for these colonists

5

was anonymous accusers and absentee witnesses.

6

-- that's why -- they were enraged because of this

7

deeply unfair trial procedure.

8

example, a harbor master might be called in and

9

records of what ships came in for these colonists who

That's

It wasn't because, for

10

were in the vice admiralty courts, and some paper is

11

introduced about what ships came in, and then they get

12

an opportunity to cross-examine them before the

13

prosecution has asked any questions of the -- the

14

harbor master.

That's not the problem, that the

Clause is designed to ensure -- the core of it -- and

a long time, a face-to-face encounter with a witness

couple points in response.

13

First of all, the statute doesn't say at

an adverse witness.

16

and then the defendant can call the witness as an

17

adverse witness.

unresolved, because it viewed those things as a due

process issue.

extensive gamesmanship.

No, I -- I think -- I -- I

don't know that -- that there's anything particularly

7

different about Virginia criminals.

8

this type of statute -- as this Court noted in

9

Melendez-Diaz, defense attorneys don't want to

I will say that

10

necessarily antagonize the court and so on by making

11

these kinds of gamesmanship demands.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

13

MR. McCULLOUGH:

Well, a cross-examination­

14

focused statute like this one more blatantly exposes

15

that type of gamesmanship and, therefore, may have a

16

better deterrent value, as opposed to a garden variety

17

statute.

18

I do want to just say, really briefly, that

19

the practical concerns, even if they are not

20

constitutional concerns, are very important because

21

the prosecution always bears the burden of persuasion,

22

and a live witness is always more compelling than a

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

11

MS. KRUGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A State adequately safeguards the

confrontation right recognized in Melendez-Diaz when

13

it guarantees that it will, on the defendant's

14

request, bring the analyst into court for face-to-face

15

confrontation and cross-examination at trial.

16
17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's not what we said in

Melendez-Diaz, unfortunately.

18

MS. KRUGER:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, Melendez-Diaz -We said the following:

20

“More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause imposes

21

a burden on the prosecution to present its witnesses,

22

not on the defendant to bring those adverse witnesses

23

into court.

24

replaced by a system in which the prosecution presents

25

its evidence via ex parte affidavits and waits for the

Its value to the defendant is not

3
4

defendant to subpoena the affiants, if he chooses.”
So you are asking us to overrule that -that statement?
MS. KRUGER:

No, Justice Scalia, not at all.

5

We believe that a State complies with that very rule

6

from Melendez-Diaz when it ensures that the analyst is

7

present in court to submit to cross-examination, which

8

is the core of the confrontation right.

9

affirmed in its decision --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He's present only if the

defendant asks for him, right?
MS. KRUGER:

That's right, and that's --

that’s because -JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

this addressed.

16

system in which the prosecution presents its evidence

17

by -- and waits for the defendant to subpoena the

18

affiants if he chooses.

19

It's not -- it's not replaced by a

MS. KRUGER:

This Court has recognized that

20

the confrontation right is designed to achieve a

21

particular purpose, and that is to ensure that the

22

government's evidence is subject to adversarial

23

testing at trial.

24
25

It is ultimately up to the defendant in
every case to decide, no matter how the prosecution
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

presents its evidence on direct, whether or not it

2

wants to confront the witness and submit that

3

witness's testimony to adversarial testing --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That may be.

It's a

5

perfectly reasonable argument.

6

saying that it doesn't contradict Melendez-Diaz.

7

MS. KRUGER:

I just object to your

I think it would be surprising

8

to discover that Melendez-Diaz went quite so far.

9

This Court has never before recognized a dimension of

10

the Confrontation Clause that would govern the manner

11

in which the prosecution presents its evidence, except

12

for the rule that it affirmed it in Crawford, which is

13

that so long as the government ensures that the

14

witness is available for cross-examination at trial,

15

the Confrontation Clause places no constraints on the

16

government's use of prior testimony or statements.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So the

18

statement, the sentence in this opinion, that, in your

19

opinion, would have the effect of limiting

20

Melendez-Diaz without overruling it, what is that

21

statement?

22

MS. KRUGER:

I think the statement is it

23

requires only that the Court reaffirm what it already

24

said in Crawford, in the context of the lab analyst

25

testimony at issue in this case, which is, again, when
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the analyst is available for cross-examination at

2

trial, the government has complied with what the

3

Confrontation Clause demands.

4

It has provided a constitutionally

5

sufficient opportunity for the defendants to submit

6

that analyst's findings to adversarial testing --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it just doesn't --

8

doesn't apply just to analysts, right?

9

there anything peculiar about analysts?

10
11

I mean, is
Would it not

exist for any other witness?
MS. KRUGER:

Well, our principal submission

12

is that the Confrontation Clause provides, in every

13

case, an opportunity for effective cross-examination.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MS. KRUGER:

Okay.

And there may be independent

16

constraints on the manner in which the prosecution

17

presents its evidence under the laws of evidence in

18

the jurisdiction because of the government's need to

19

satisfy its burden of proof and ensure a fundamentally

20

fair trial under the Due Process Clause.

21

To the extent that the Court --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23
24
25

I don't understand what --

is that a yes or a no?
MS. KRUGER:

Well, it is to say that

Confrontation Clause is not what prohibits that
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

practice.

2

equally effective sources in the law --

3

What prohibits that practice are other

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

So as far as the

4

Confrontation Clause is concerned, this would apply to

5

other witnesses as well?

6

MS. KRUGER:

I think that that’s right, but

7

even if the Court were to disagree with that

8

submission, this Court could rely on the kinds of

9

distinctions that it has drawn in other cases, like

10

Inadi or like White v. Illinois, which recognized that

11

there is a class of hearsay evidence that’s not simply

12

a weaker substitute for live testimony at trial, that

13

has independent, probative significance that makes it

14

somewhat irrelevant whether or not the court --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Indicia of reliability --

16

you want us to go back to that?

17

(Laughter.)

18

MS. KRUGER:

Is that --

No, it's not a question of the

19

reliability.

20

in which hearsay evidence and its admissibility was

21

dependent on reliability with one in which the

22

touchstone is an opportunity for cross-examination.

23

What Crawford did was replace a system

And it's precisely in response to that point

24

that Crawford, again, reaffirmed the rule that it

25

first announced in Green, that so long as the
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

out-of-court declarant is present at trial to explain

2

or defend his out-of-court statements, the

3

Confrontation Clause is satisfied.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

What if it doesn't quite

5

work, that the Confrontation Clause seems to be

6

expanding, just with the opportunity for

7

cross-examination creating all kinds of incursions

8

into areas where it’s not necessary for fairness

9

purposes?

10

Then does it make sense to say -- hey,

11

unfortunately, to say that the only workable system is

12

that you have a system which has exactly the

13

confrontation point, but indicia of reliability do

14

have an impact as to what the implications of the

15

Confrontation Clause violation are, in terms of

16

practical trial necessity.

17

MS. KRUGER:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

But -Now, there we are,

accepting the warnings of the dissenters in Crawford.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MS. KRUGER:

I don't think that the

22

touchstone of this Court's analysis need return to the

23

now discredited Ohio v. Roberts regime.

24
25

It's simply a practical point.

To the

extent the Petitioners are arguing that their
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

opportunity to confront and to cross-examine is

2

constitutionally inadequate merely because the

3

prosecution hasn't guaranteed that it would call the

4

witness to the stand first, I think the court can take

5

due account of the fact that that is not necessarily

6

so.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what about Raleigh's

8

witnesses -- you know, the hypothetical I gave you,

9

for the heart of the matter, the heart of the matter,

10

and they stick it in their affidavits, and you say,

11

oh, don't worry, don't worry, you can cross-examine

12

them later in the trial.

13

MS. KRUGER:

I think, to the extent that the

14

Court were otherwise inclined to invent a new body of

15

Confrontation Clause jurisprudence to govern the

16

manner in which the prosecution puts on its witnesses

17

and questions them, this isn't the appropriate case to

18

do it because, as we have seen from Petitioners’

19

submission earlier this morning, there is no

20

substantive difference from a defendant's

21

perspective -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you -- are you

25

position?
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Is that your

MS. KRUGER:

Our principal submission is

that the Confrontation Clause allows the government to

rely on affidavits, so long as it bring the affiants

questions --

MS. KRUGER:

Well, it's -- it’s somewhat of

a difficult question to answer because this is not a

Can you follow the same procedure

MS. KRUGER:

We think that you could, so

18

long as the defendant has an adequate opportunity to

19

cross-examine that eye witness about the testimonial

statement.

21

But even if you disagreed with that, we

22

think that the Court can take due account of the fact

23

that there is a significant difference between the

24

kind of testimony that an eyewitness provides and the

25

kind of testimony that a forensic analyst provides.

The forensic analyst's lab report is not

2

merely a weaker substitute for live testimony.

3

in fact, I think, as we see by the relative

4

infrequency with which analysts were called into court

5

before Melendez-Diaz, something that has been seen to

6

have equal value, regardless of the manner in which

7

it’s presented.

8
9

It is,

And, for that reason, we think that, in
order to decide this case, all this Court needs to

10

decide is that, in the context of forensic lab

11

analysts, what the Court said in Crawford still

12

stands, so long as the government presents the analyst

at trial for face-to-face confrontation and

14

cross-examination.

Why -- why do we have to

MS. KRUGER:

I think that this -- this case

Court to provide guidance to States that are currently

grappling with how to respond to the practical

10

problems that have been presented in the wake of

And what happened is after the --

Okay?

They were

After the defendants' trials, in a case

suggested that the defendant could ask the prosecution

20

to bring the witness in.

including Grant, the defendant on whom -- in the case

22

on whom the Commonwealth relies so heavily.

23

Many defendants did that,

The prosecution ignored those requests.

was still taking the view that this is not -- this is

not testimonial.

Up until the moment that this Court
