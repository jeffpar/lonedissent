ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The dramatic collapse of Enron had profound

12

reverberations experienced throughout the Houston

13

economy and citizenry.

14

Houston area were affected, as the court of appeals

15

explicitly recognized, so much so that 60 percent of the

16

jury venire affirmatively acknowledged in the responses

17

to questionnaires that they would be unable to set aside

18

their deep-seated biases or doubted their ability to do

19

so, or that they were angry about Enron's collapse, an

20

anger that was manifested in the vitriolic terms in

21

which Petitioner Jeff Skilling was referred to

22

repeatedly both in the questionnaires and in the

23

community more generally.

Countless individuals in the

24

The passions about this case were so intense

25

and the connections to Enron ran so deep that the entire
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

United States Attorney's Office, all 150 or so

2

attorneys, recused themselves from the investigation

3

that culminated in this prosecution.

4

In those conditions, the court of appeals

5

was correct in unanimously concluding that this was one

6

of the very rare cases in which, because of the degree

7

of passion and prejudice in the community, the process

8

of voir dire cannot be relied upon to adequately ferret

9

out and identify unduly biased jurors.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And --

What do we take from

11

trial counsel at the end of the voir dire process

12

announcing that if he had had extra preemptory

13

challenges, he would have used them only against 6 of the

14

12 people that were finally selected?

15

would have ejected, why couldn't a fair jury have been

16

found?

17

MR. SRINIVASAN:

If that's all he

Well, Your Honor, to be

18

clear even one juror who should have been excluded and

19

wasn't would have been enough, but --

20
21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's a different --

that's a different question.

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Sure.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You are taking a broader

24

proposition and saying that the presumption could not

25

under any set of circumstances be overcome, and that's
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what I'm trying to probe.

2

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

3

The reason that trial counsel objected to six specific

4

jurors at the juncture that Your Honor's referring to

5

is that that corresponded to six cause objections that had

6

been, in our view, erroneously denied.

7

suggests that we were satisfied with the remainder of

8

the jury.

9

Now, that in no way

We had made an objection -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

There was

10

only one juror that had been challenged for cause

11

against -- for which a preemptory challenge wasn't used.

12

I thought that every other for-cause challenge ended up

13

being excused on the basis of a preemptory challenge.

14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right, and that's

15

what I was trying to say, Your Honor, that the reason

16

why trial counsel identified six specific jurors was

17

that there were six other jurors who would have been on

18

the venire as to whom we had applied -- as to whom we had

19

asserted a cause challenge that was denied, and because

20

of that we had to use a preemptory to strike those

21

jurors, which left us without --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

there were six that were okay.

24
25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

But that means that

Well, no.

There were

six as -- there were six remaining as to which we didn't
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have a corresponding for-cause objection that had been

2

denied.

3

with the other six.

4

But in no way indicates that we were satisfied

From the very outset, we complained about

5

this process.

6

no juror could be seated in this case because the

7

process of voir dire couldn't adequately be relied upon

8

in these conditions.

9

We said at the outset before trial that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Tell me what in the

10

process itself, outside of your general proposition that

11

no process could find fair jurors?

12

process was deficient?

13

MR. SRINIVASAN:

What else in the

The process was deficient

14

in a couple of respects, Your Honor:

15

to time and scope.

16

conducted was essentially an ordinary voir dire for

17

ordinary circumstances.

18

that the voir dire would be conducted in a period of 1

19

day, and we objected to that.

20

First, with respect

The voir dire that the trial judge

He announced before the fact

He also announced that he would have limited

21

questioning and that counsel would have very limited

22

opportunity to follow up with additional questions.

23

also objected clearly and repeatedly to that.

24

was manifested in the voir dire that occurred, because

25

what the trial judge did is made two fundamental, we
6
Alderson Reporting Company

We

And that

Official

1

think, mistakes in the way he conducted the voir dire.

2

One occurs with respect to those jurors as

3

to whom they had laid bare their biases, and another

4

occurs with respect to those jurors as to whom they

5

didn't affirmatively acknowledge their biases, but,

6

given the conditions that prevailed in the community,

7

they might well have had biases that they didn't

8

affirmatively acknowledge.

9

Now, with respect to the first, the mistake

10

that, in our view, the trial judge made was to accept a

11

simple assurance of fairness in the face of overt statements

12

of bias and in conditions that confronted this community,

13

where there was deep-seated community prejudice and animus

14

that permeated the Houston -- that permeated the city of

15

Houston, that kind of acceptance of a simple assurance of

16

fairness in the face of repeated overt statements of bias

17

shouldn't be countenanced.

18

And we think what the trial court should

19

have done in that situation is to move to an additional

20

juror.

21

interviewed 46 jurors, nearly 8 more than the minimum

22

that was necessary to constitute a jury in this case.

23

And just to give this a frame of reference, the entire voir

24

dire process in this case took 5 hours, and the trial

25

judge interviewed each juror for approximately 4 and a half

But instead of doing that, the trial court

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

minutes.

2

By way of comparison --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But he did -- he did give

4

time for counsel to ask additional questions, trial

5

counsel.

6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8
9

He -- he did.
He asked both sides if

they had additional questions.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

He gave some time, Justice

10

Ginsburg, but he made clear before the voir dire began

11

that that opportunity was going to be limited both in

12

time and scope.

13

page 11805 of the record -- what he said was that

14

follow-up questioning would be permitted if it was

15

reasonable and if it was related to the purposes for

16

which the juror was brought before the bench.

17

With respect to scope -- and this is at

And just to paint the picture a little bit,

18

the -- the potential jurors were brought before the bench,

19

and they were left standing, which I think reinforced the

20

conception that this was going to be a rather quick affair

21

and it was not going to allow the kind of extensive,

22

meaningful follow-up that we thought was required.

23

And to give it a frame of reference, in the

24

Oklahoma City bombing case, the prosecution of Timothy

25

McVeigh, that proceeding was transferred from the city
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of Oklahoma City to Denver, but even after the transfer,

2

the trial judge conducted an 18-day voir dire with an

3

average of 1 hour of interviews per juror; 18 days and

4

1 hour as compared with 5 hours and 4 and a half minutes.

5

And we think the Oklahoma City experience is much more

6

befitting of the kind of voir dire that’s necessary in

7

circumstances of community prejudice and passion of the

8

kind that existed here.

9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You made a change of

venue motion at the outset, right?

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We did.

We --

And I'm unaware of any

13

case in which we have said a change is mandatory when

14

what's involved is money rather than life or limb.

15

or limb obviously was involved in the McVeigh case.

16

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Life

Sure, it was, Your Honor,

17

and by no means would we in any way diminish the -- the

18

profound human tragedy that accompanied the Oklahoma

19

City case, but I think the reality of the sentiment on

20

the ground in Houston was that Houston citizens, as we

21

pointed out in our brief, in fact referred to the -- to

22

what happened in the wake of the collapse of Enron in

23

terms that were similar to the way they referred to

24

terrorist attacks.

25

in terms of the 9/11 attack.

They -- they in fact talked about it

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what was remarkable

2

about some of those questionnaires, there were a lot of

3

people didn't read the newspapers.

4

people who indicated they really didn't know anything

5

about this case.

6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

There were a lot of

That's true,

7

Justice Ginsburg, but I’d like to clarify one aspect

8

of that, if I could, and that’s that our argument is not

9

-- and it hasn't been at any point in this proceeding --

10

that pretrial publicity caused the passion and prejudice

11

in the community.

12

in which pretrial publicity was a symptom rather than the

13

cause.

14

This is -- is very much a case

Now, pretrial publicity, to be sure, stoked

15

the passions that -- that already lay within the

16

community, but really this was a case in which the

17

passions existed regardless of pretrial publicity.

18

I think the juror questionnaires and the surveys and all

19

the other evidence that we put before the district

20

court manifests that.

21

questionnaires -- and they are -- there are several examples

22

of situations in which particular jurors said that they

23

were unaware of any of the pretrial publicity, they did

24

not watch the news, they didn't read the newspapers,

25

they hadn't seen the movies about Enron, but yet they

And

If you look at the juror

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

still said they had feelings about Jeff Skilling and Ken

2

Lay.

3

Juror 63, a person who wound up on the

4

panel, is a good example of that.

She answered “no” to

5

all the questions concerning her exposure to pretrial

6

publicity, but then when she was asked whether she had

7

views about the guilt or innocence of Jeff Skilling, she

8

said yes, she did; and she elaborated on that by

9

explaining that I think he probably knew he was breaking

10

the law.

11

lack of exposure to pretrial publicity --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

So this is a person who, notwithstanding a

But there was some

follow-up to that.

14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

There -- there was a bit of

15

follow-up to that, Your Honor, but I think the nature of the

16

follow-up is -- is quite illuminating on what we think are

17

some of the fatal flaws in this voir dire process.

18

follow-up --

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

The

Do you really think that

20

if -- if there had been a much more lengthy voir dire

21

and if the trial judge had been more willing to -- to

22

grant motions to dismiss for cause, that it would have

23

-- that it would not have been possible to find a fair

24

and impartial jury in the district?

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, our first --

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

certainly, there should have been a more intensive voir

2

dire, Justice Alito.

3

is that the proceedings should have been transferred,

4

not necessarily because there don't in fact exist or

5

there didn't in fact exist 12 unbiased jurors in the

6

city of Houston.

7

Now, our first order of submission

Our point is a different one, and that is

8

that in conditions where you have the level of passion

9

and prejudice that permeated the Houston community,

10

there’s too great a risk that the process of voir dire

11

and particularly the ordinary process of voir dire

12

wouldn't be successful in identifying those 12 people.

13

That's the danger.

14

And the other problem with the argument that

15

the government makes with respect to the fact that there

16

are 4 and a half million citizens in Houston, which I think

17

is part of Your Honor's question, is that that would mean

18

more if the trial judge had gone deeper into the jury

19

pool than the mere 46 jurors he did interview.

20

when he interviewed those 46 and stopped at that point,

21

what we were left with was a jury panel as to which

22

there was too great a danger of bias, too great a danger

23

that they would bring their biases to bear with them in

24

adjudicating Petitioner's guilt.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Because

Well, rule 21 says that the
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

judge must grant a transfer if the judge is satisfied

2

that a prejudice against -- that so great a prejudice

3

against the defendant exists in the transferring

4

district that the defendant cannot obtain a fair and

5

impartial trial there.

6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Correct.
Well, doesn't that suggest

8

that if you could find a fair and impartial jury with an

9

adequate voir dire, then the transfer need not be

10

granted?

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think it has to be

12

read against the context of whether we can be confident

13

that you can find that fair and impartial jury.

14

any -- I think we would say that in any community in

15

which there is 4 and a half million people, there may,

16

in fact, be 12 individuals who aren't so biased that they

17

can't sit.

18

process of voir dire, as this Court's decisions

19

repeatedly recognize, in Mu'Min, in Patton, and Murphy

20

and others, the ordinary process of voir dire in that

21

situation can't be trusted to identify those people.

The real danger, though, is that the ordinary

MR. SRINIVASAN:
Mr. Chief Justice.

No, no.

No,

With respect, that's not -- that's

10

not the only danger.

11

it, but I think there's -- there's other ones that we

12

would put forward before that one.

I mean, that's -- that's part of

13

There’s two in particular:

14

community like Houston, in the state of the -- the

15

passion and prejudice that existed in Houston at the

16

time of this trial, there’s a real concern that jurors

17

will not feel fully free to return to that community

18

delivering anything other than the conviction for which

19

the -- the community desires.

20

important concern that this Court's decisions identify.

21

And the other one, and this is in Murphy in

First, in a

And that, I think, is an

22

particular, where there’s a substantial share of the

23

community that's impassioned and prejudiced, as this one

24

was, there’s a concern that even jurors who don't lay

25

bare -- who don't affirmatively acknowledge their
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

biases -- are unwittingly subject to the same biases

2

that permeate the community.

3

-- is the reason that in these situations, we think

4

transfer is required.

5

And that sort of danger is

But even if transfer wasn't required, what

6

needed to happen was a more extensive and intensive voir

7

dire than happened here.

8

and Justice Ginsburg, this gets back to your question

9

about juror 63.

The voir dire was deficient --

The voir dire was deficient in at least

10

this respect.

11

Houston, we think it's error to accept the assurance of

12

fairness of a juror who has already laid bare their

13

biases.

14

In conditions like those that permeated

Now, juror 63, for example, she said she

15

thinks she knew that Jeff Skilling -- she thinks that

16

Jeff Skilling knew he was breaking the law.

17

someone as to whom we ought to be very concerned.

18

our view, that person shouldn't get -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19
20

This is
In

Was there a challenge for

cause against her?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

21

There -- there wasn't a

22

specific challenge for cause against her, Your Honor,

23

but -- but again, we challenged everybody on the basis

24

that voir dire wouldn't adequately ferret out biases in

25

this case.

And then we did challenge -- as Justice
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Sotomayor's question about the six specific challenges

2

that we lodged at the close of the voir dire, but before the

3

jurors were sworn -- juror 63 was one of those jurors.

4

And so I think it was evident that juror 63

5

was not at all somebody who we were satisfied with.

6

the reason is, if you look at the nature of -- at the

7

voir dire colloquy with her, the trial court asked her

8

about that statement and asked her:

9

making this statement?

10

her response was:

And

You remember

Do you still feel that way?

And

I don't know.

11

And then she acknowledged: I have no further

12

information to bring to bear on that question than I did

13

then.

14

bias that she brought with her, but the trial court was

15

unsatisfied, and he continued to press.

16

her at some point:

17

innocence?

18

And at that point, she has only fortified the

And then he asked

Can you apply the presumption of

And she said yes.

And then that was it.

But in our view, a -- a search for a --

19

-- what I think can fairly be described as a rote

20

assurance of fairness can't be sufficient, given the

21

very evident danger that someone like juror 63, who has

22

already laid bare her biases, would bring her biases

23

with her to the panel when she adjudicated Petitioner's

24

guilt or innocence.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

How do you say we -- in

16
Alderson Reporting Company

1

your opinion, if we agreed with your basic idea -- if,

2

which is totally hypothetical.

3

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Sure.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

If we agreed with that, how

5

would we sketch the lines?

That is, when does the

6

jury -- does the judge have to do more than is ordinary,

7

and what counts as more than ordinary?

8

what I have fear of, to put it out for you, is that jury

9

selection can go on a very long time.

I mean, I --

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Right.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

And judges have to -- have

12

to run their trials.

13

they have got to do more, that will become exaggerated,

14

and they’ll administer it in a way that will make it

15

hard to select juries.

16

And if we tell the judges that

That's the harm I'm worried about.

So I'm

17

asking you, how would you sketch a line that prevents

18

that harm?

19

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Justice Breyer, it is by

20

nature a contextual inquiry.

The standard that this

21

Court has articulated to identify the circumstances in

22

which this sort of extra -- I think -- precaution is

23

necessary is that there has to be, a quote, "wave of

24

public passion," close quote, and that's the language

25

that the Court has used in a number of its decisions.

you might feel, which is that that language may not be

inquiry is -JUSTICE BREYER:

I didn't ask you -- I just

asked you to do your best.

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Yes, and that --

So we’ve got the wave of

14

public passion --

15

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Wave --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

And what about the second

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Wave of public passion, and

17

half?

18
19

I guess the substrata that I would put beneath that,

20

especially for this category of cases, is pervasive

21

animus directed towards the defendant as responsible for

22

a harm felt by the entire community.
JUSTICE BREYER:

23

All right.

Now, what's the

24

second half?

The second half, which I'm really worried

25

about, is that we get into the business of running the

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

trial court's trials.

So I want to know what it is that

2

the trial court at that stage, in your opinion, other

3

than transfer, has to do?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

4

I think what the trial

5

court has to do is two things, Your Honor:

First, for a

6

juror who has laid bare his or her biases, that juror

7

should not be allowed on the panel, and an assurance of

8

fairness from that sort of juror isn't enough.

9

very least, Your Honor, on this category -- and then I’ll

At the

10

go to my second point -- in a situation in which a

11

juror has laid bare his or her biases, we think that

12

juror shouldn't be seated.

13

But if you’re going to entertain the

14

thought of seating that person, at the very least this has to

15

happen:

16

that ordinary practice would only be altered in the very

rare category of cases that involve a wave of public

passion.

But even if you didn't do that, at least the

11

following should happen, Justice Breyer, and that is

12

that when somebody utters an assurance of fairness, that

13

itself shouldn't be enough when the community is

14

permeated with the sorts of biases that attended this

15

proceeding.

reconcile their previous statements of bias with their

utterance of fairness.

18

The jurors should at least be forced to

The other point I would make is this:

That

19

the danger that this Court has identified in conditions

20

like those that pervaded the Houston community is that

21

even with prospective jurors who don't affirmatively

22

acknowledge their biases, there’s a danger that they

23

may have biases they haven't brought to the fore.

24

we think what can't happen is what the trial judge did

25

in this case, which is to refuse to question any of the

jurors on the basis of any response they gave in the

that that -- I think nobody suggests that any dishonest

5

MR. SRINIVASAN:

In other

And the

But I don't think that

6

you’ve advanced the ball, with all due respect, that much

7

by saying there has a right to honest services, because I

8

think what -- at the end of the day, what that would mean

9

is that any situation in which there’s a fiduciary duty

10

or even if there’s not a fiduciary duty, but at least

11

any situation in which there is a fiduciary duty, a

12

nondisclosure of deception would give rise to a

13

Federal felony prosecution.

14

And that has never been the understanding

15

under pre-McNally case law, and that shouldn't be the

16

understanding now, because its sweep is breathtaking, and

17

it's not something that we would ordinarily construe

18

Congress to have intended.

19

Now, I think in -- in this case, there’s

20

several objections we have to the application of the

21

honest services fraud statute to this case.

22

the statute is unconstitutionally vague.

23

particularly vague as applies to -- as applied to anything

24

beyond the narrow category of bribes and kickbacks.

25

We think it's

But I think in some ways the most
23
Alderson Reporting Company

We think

Official

1

straightforward way to understand why the honest

2

services fraud statute can't be applied validly in this

3

case is to appreciate what I think is an evolution in

4

the government's theory.

5

Weyhrauch -- and this is at page 48 of the government's

6

brief in Weyhrauch, just a few months ago.

7

said that the honest services fraud statute, quote,

8

“Nor does it cover an official whose interest is public

9

knowledge.”

10

And -- and at the time of

The government

So, at that point, I think we -- we would have

11

believed that the honest services fraud statute can't be

12

applied to Jeff Skilling, because his interest, as the

13

government acknowledges, was public knowledge.

14

But the position that the government has

15

taken now is that even though his interest was

16

disclosed, he didn't disclose that he was acting in

17

pursuit of that interest at the expense of the

18

employer's interests, which I read to be contrary to the

19

position that they took in the Weyhrauch case and, I

20

think, which is problematic in two respects.

21

First, there is no pre-McNally

22

understanding, none, that a disclosed interest can give

23

rise to honest services liability.

24

maybe more importantly --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
24
Alderson Reporting Company

And, second, and

I'm sorry.

A

Official

1

disclosed interest?

2

MR. SRINIVASAN:

A disclosed interest, where

3

the interest is disclosed.

4

situations in which the interest is undisclosed, as the

5

government suggested would be the case in the Weyhrauch

6

brief.

7

All the cases dealt with

But -- but perhaps even more importantly,

8

there is no pre-McNally understanding to the effect

9

that acting in pursuit of an interest in compensation

10

can give rise to honest services liability.

11

fact, in a post-McNally case, the Thompson case

12

out of the -- out of the Seventh Circuit, Judge

13

14

pursuit of an interest in personal compensation

And then when the stock

I thought that the government was not

limiting the -- its position to the compensation, but was

5

also dealing with the share price.

6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I think, Justice Ginsburg,

7

the government's theory on how the honest services fraud

8

statute applies in this case is laid out at page 49

9

and 50.

And the interest that the government identifies

10

that was furthered by Petitioner Skilling's action is

11

his interest in compensation.

12

government, I think, describes it.

That's -- that's how the

13

And the -- it's true, Your Honor --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

that the honest services fraud theory that was put

21

before the jury is not at all commensurate with the one

22

that’s being asserted now.

And I'll bracket for the moment that we think

23

But even if you take as a given that it's

24

the theory now, the elements of honest services fraud

25

under the government's theory are that the individual
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would act in pursuit of his interest in his own

2

compensation at the expense of the employer's interests

3

in acquiring better information with which to make an

4

informed decision.

5

And one of the fundamental problems we see

6

with that approach is that it would threaten to convert

7

almost any lie in the workplace into an honest services

8

fraud prosecution for the following --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I --

I just don't

10

-- because I'm looking at page 50.

11

discussion goes from 50 to 52, and that the part on 52

12

certainly homes in on the share -- the shares.

13

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I thought this

It -- it does, Your Honor,

14

but the interest at issue -- and I'm reading from page

15

50.

16

on page 50.

17

“That conduct constituted fraud.”

18

whether the public nature of petitioner's compensation

19

scheme prevents his conduct from constituting honest

20

services fraud.”

21

This is in the middle of the first full paragraph
The government says, “That constitute” --

And then they go on:

The only question here is

“Although the” --

22

“Although petitioner's basic compensation scheme was

23

public, his scheme to artificially inflate the

24

company's stock price by misrepresenting its financial

25

condition, in order to derive additional personal
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

benefits” -- i.e., his compensation -- “at the expense of

2

shareholders, was not” disclosed.

3
4

So I think the theory of application here is
that because he was acting allegedly --

5
6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
the "i.e."?

7

Why -- why do you put in

Additional personal benefits could be both.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Because the stock is the

8

compensation, Your Honor.

There's -- there's no -- I

9

think, in this sort of situation, there’s not a

10

disaggregation between the stock and the compensation.

11

The stock was intimately tied to his compensation, and

12

the personal benefit that, I think, was being received

13

was that compensation interest.

14
15

I mean, the government can clarify that, but
that's my understanding of the government's view.

16
17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think we’ll ask the

government to do that.

18

MR. SRINIVASAN:

And the danger with that theory

19

is that it would have the capacity to convert almost any

20

workplace lie into a Federal felony, for the following

21

reason:

22

might -- might engage in an act of deception to his

23

employer with respect to a work-related matter.

24

example, suppose that there is an employer policy that

25

says you can only use workplace computers for business

That, in a variety of situations, an employee

28
Alderson Reporting Company

For

Official

1

purposes, and when asked, the employee says that he is

2

only using it for business purposes, but he is in fact

3

using it for personal reasons.

4

will have made a deception to the employer.

5

it would be material, particularly given that it acts in

6

the face of an employer policy, and it arguably was made

7

in furtherance of the employer's personal interest in

8

maximizing his compensation at the expense of the -- at

9

the expense of the employer's interests in having better

Well, at that point he
Arguably,

10

information with which to make an informed decision

11

about the employee's future.

12

So for that reason as well, we think that

13

the application of the honest services fraud --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What you've just

15

explained is why you think the statute is very broad.

16

You haven't explained why it's vague.

17

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, there are two

18

different arguments, Your Honor.

19

submission is the statute is unconstitutionally vague,

20

and we believe that it's particularly vague as applied

21

to a category that extends beyond bribes and kickbacks.

22

And I haven't been through those arguments, but they're

23

-- they’re spelled out in our briefs.

Our threshold

particularly problematic when it's applied to the realm

Thank you, counsel.

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

12

When Judge Lake approached this case with

13

the question of how to select a jury, he had 15 years of

14

experience in selecting juries, and he informed the

15

parties that it was his experience that voir dire

16

conducted by the trial judge is more effective at

17

eliciting the potential biases of a juror than the

18

oftentimes tendentious voir dire that’s conducted by

19

the parties.

He did not ignore the fact that the Enron

collapse had a significant impact on the Houston

MR. DREEBEN:

15

16

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

There's no problem?

I went

18

through the 200 pages, and I counted -- this is only my

19

own subjective recounting of it, but I counted six of

20

whom only one lasted, but I counted five others that

21

they had to use peremptories on that include one juror,

22

29, who herself was a victim of this offense to the tune

23

of $50,000 or $60,000.

24

25

The judge said:

I will not

I counted another, juror -- what's this one

-- juror number -- number’s 74, who when he looked her

2

square in the eye and said, "Can you be fair?"

3

"I can't say yes for sure.

4

Okay?

She said,

No."

So, in my own subjective account, there

5

were five here, maybe six, certainly three, that perhaps

6

if they'd had an appeal on peremptories, which

7

apparently they don't, they might have said these should

8

have been challenged for cause.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Breyer, I think

that there was a fair trial in this case, and I think
32
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that a full reading of the voir dire reveals that

2

individuals sitting from this vantage point with a cold

3

record who were not there may have different viewpoints

4

about --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

I’d never heard of an

6

instance where a trial judge would not challenge for

7

cause -- but I'm not saying it doesn't happen -- where the

8

juror herself is a victim of the offense to the tune of

9

$50,000 to $60,000.

See, we are getting into an area that

10

I'm not familiar with, but I think that that's not

11

supposed to be.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think that there’s

13

any per se disqualification.

14

that juror did not sit, and this Court held in

15

United States v. Martinez-Salazar that one of the

16

purposes of peremptories is to protect against the

17

occasional accidental error.

18

But even if there was,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How -- but is it

19

occasional or accidental?

I think that’s what Justice

20

Breyer is getting at.

21

and one in which the judge basically said to the lawyers,

22

I'm not giving you much leeway at all, how can we be

23

satisfied that there was a fair and impartial jury picked

24

when the judge doesn't follow up on a witness who says,

25

I'm a victim of this fraud?

With such a truncated voir dire

I don't know -- I would find

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it strange that we would permit jurors who are victims of

2

the crime to serve as jurors.

3
4

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, none sat in this case.

I don't think there is any claim that they did.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but -- but the judge

6

didn't strike her for cause.

7

of not following through adequately?

8

MR. DREEBEN:

9
10

So isn't that symptomatic

I don't think that a -- what

this Court may perceive as an error in the denial of one
for-cause challenge --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but it's not just one.

12

There were like five, of which I have given you the

13

worst, and they had to use up all their peremptories.

14

And they can't appeal this.

15

together, plus the one who sat, juror 11, provides, as

16

they point out for the reasons they say, some cause for

17

concern.

18

And it's that taken

And that's what I'm trying to get at.
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Breyer, I think

19

that reading the entire voir dire reflects that the

20

judge was interested in determining whether these jurors

21

were qualified to sit.

22

the voir dire used as a lobbying or a argumentative

23

exercise by the lawyers.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Go ahead with it, but they

didn't challenge 63 for cause, so I guess they waived

15

it.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

They did not challenge 63 for

17

cause, but they -- but they came to this Court today and

18

tried to use 63 as an object lesson of what was wrong

19

with the voir dire.

20

illustrates not only what was right with the voir dire,

21

but the immense distortion that Petitioners have

22

attempted to perpetrate by putting together effectively

23

a highlight reel of every bad headline in every Houston

24

publication and claiming that the entire jurisdiction,

25

all 4.5 million people virtually, were infected with

I actually think juror 63

some sort of a pervasive prejudice that could not be

“Do you recall anything that may have --

“No.”

And then the judge, after some more questioning

about her that reveals that, among other things, Ken Lay

to, he asks her about the very question that Petitioners

the case that in a normal trial there would have been as

11

detailed a 14-page questionnaire as there was in this

12

case, that was designed to elicit any and all

13

connections to Enron.

14

Now, whether there may have been some

15

individualized mistakes along the way, whether some of

16

us would have preferred that the voir dire be more

17

extensive, is not the issue; and unless this Court is

18

prepared to set standards that are based either on a

19

stopwatch or some sort of, you know, notion of how many

victimization in the part of the community that I don't

meltdown in Houston, a 4.5 million city with a robust

MR. DREEBEN:

It seems that that's where

I don't think so,

16

Mr. Chief Justice, because the honest services component

17

actually, and the component of this trial, was really a

18

subset of the securities fraud.

19

of Petitioner's crimes were lying to Enron, lying to its

20

shareholders about the health of the company in a

21

financial sense, when, in fact, he knew that he had been

22

engaging in numerous manipulations of earnings and

23

schemes that are detailed in the briefs, in order to

24

avoid Enron having to recognize that portions of its

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if -- if you’re

going to say that the statute refers to a term of art,

5

the whole point of a term of art is that it’s a shorthand

MR. DREEBEN:

I think it's a term of art in

13

the sense that it referred to a -- a body of law that

14

until quite recently, when defendants began making

15

vagueness arguments, was understood to refer to the kinds

16

of schemes that had been prosecuted before this Court

I think it's clear enough at

interpretation of criminal statutes to dispose of cases

8

that are at the periphery and ensure that there is --

difficult position, though, if he has got to wait.

Justice Ginsburg, appears on page 1086a of the Joint

want to say at the outset that this jury instruction was

drafted against the background of Fifth Circuit law,

honest services crime than the government has taken in

background.

11

But the -- the instruction said that “to show

12

that defendants deprived Enron and its shareholders of

13

their right of honest services, the government must prove

14

beyond a reasonable doubt that, in rendering some

15

particular service or services, the defendant knew that

16

his actions were not in the best interests of Enron and

17

its shareholders or that he consciously contemplated or

18

intended such actions, and that Enron and its

19

shareholders suffered a detriment from the defendant's

breach of his duty to render honest services.”

it does seem a little circular to me.
The introduction to this jury instruction says,

3

"Honest services are the services required by the defendant's

fiduciary duty to Enron and its shareholders under State law."

5

So this was tried in a circuit that followed the State law

6

principle that’s at issue in the Weyhrauch case.

7

government defined the fiduciary duty in that way.

JUSTICE BREYER:

You can -- well, you focus

5

on what you just put together.

You said intent to deceive,

6

intent to violate the law.

7

you’re saying they don't have to have an intent to violate

8

the law because there was no State law that prohibited

9

whatever was at issue.

I believe in another case,

10

So is the government now saying -- which is a

11

big difference -- that you cannot convict somebody unless

12

they know, i.e., they intend to violate a law that

13

forbids the conduct in which they are engaging, other

14

than this honest services law, or are you not saying

15

that?

16
17

MR. DREEBEN:

I'm not saying that,

Justice Breyer.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. DREEBEN:

20
21

You’re not saying that.

I'm saying that in the

ordinary case -JUSTICE BREYER:

Then if you're not saying

22

that, what the person has to carry around with them

23

is an agency treatise.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think that what
55

1

happens, Justice Breyer, is that unless the government

2

does have some sort of legal platform like that to show

3

that there was knowledge of a duty, it's not possible

4

for the government to bring its proof to the court and

5

establish that the individual acted with the requisite

6

mens rea, unless there is activity that reveals an

7

intent to circumvent the law and to withhold the

8

information, as in Justice Sotomayor's example,

9

information about a property interest that might well

10

affect the deliberations of the council.

11

of evidence often requires use of offshore accounts --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that kind

Yes, I mean, of course they

13

intend to -- it's not the case that is obvious; it's the

14

case that is not obvious that worries me, and --

15

MR. DREEBEN:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don’t see any of those --- in the case that

17

is not obvious, of course they intend to withhold

18

information.

19

they don't know it's unlawful to do so.

20

I agree with that.

MR. DREEBEN:

But the problem is

Justice Breyer, I think if you

21

look at the cases in which this has happened, there is --

22

there’s not like a deliberation on somebody's part -- oh, do

23

I have to disclose or not disclose?

24

25

conflicting interests that every fiduciary knows you

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Dreeben, would you

clarify the issue that came up:

5

theory focused simply on the compensation or does it

6

involve the sale of shares?

MR. DREEBEN:

as well.

linked to it.

Is the government's

It involves the sale of shares

That was part of the compensation, and it’s
But, Justice Ginsburg, if you look at the

10

government's opening statement in this case, the

11

government opened by saying, “You will see that

12

defendants Lay and Skilling knew few -- a few key facts

13

about the true condition of Enron, facts that the investing

14

public did not know.

15

Lay and Skilling sold tens of millions of dollars of

16

their own Enron stock.”

17

With that information, defendants

And then continued:

“When an investor buys a

18

share of stock, an investor buys some rights in a

19

publicly traded company.

20

of stock, they buy the right to hear and receive truth

21

from the chief executive officer.

22

buy the right to have their interests placed ahead of

23

the chief executor officer every day of the week.”

24
25

When an investor buys a share

And, importantly, they

So there was, baked into this case at the
outset, the notion that these officials were not acting

in the best interests of the shareholders.

They were

furthering their own interests by maintaining a high

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
A couple of quick points on the honest

12

services fraud issue, and then a couple of points on the

13

juror issue, if I might.

14

With respect to honest services fraud, first

15

of all, I think that the government pointed to the jury

16

instruction -- and, Justice Ginsburg, this goes to some

17

questions that you had raised -- I think what's clear from

18

the capacious nature of the jury instruction that was issued

19

in this case is that the elements that the government say

20

make Jeff Skilling guilty of honest services fraud weren't

21

put before the jury or required to be found by the jury.

22

And for that reason alone, the conviction against Jeff

23

Skilling ought to be overturned.

24
25

Another point I'd make very quickly with
respect to the sweep of the government's theory
58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

concerning the workplace is, under our understanding,

2

the duty of loyalty does extend to all employees.

3

does, and, therefore, the theory that they assert should

4

apply in this case, I think, has devastating

5

implications for workplace relations.

6

It

Now, with respect to the juror question, a

7

couple of preliminary points, and then I’d like to

8

walk the Court through just one aspect of the voir dire

9

which I think exhibits the manifest flaws in the process

10
11

the trial court conducted.
With respect to the question about the

12

issuance of questionnaires, questionnaires were also

13

issued in the Timothy McVeigh case.

14

limit our comparison to Timothy McVeigh, because I think

15

in response to some of the questions that were raised, I

16

don't want to leave an impression that a multiple-day

17

voir dire with the sort of extensive questioning that we

18

think was required here is not in use in other cases

19

that involve like crimes.

20

But I don't want to

In the Martha Stewart case, for example,

21

which was a financial case, there were 6 days of voir

22

dire and after a questionnaire was issued.

23

case, the only reason you needed an extended voir dire

24

was because of the celebrity status of the defendant.

25

You didn't have the deep-seated community passion and
59
Alderson Reporting Company

And in that

Official

1

prejudice that characterized the Houston venue in this

2

case.

3

So, I think it's not at all unusual to have

4

that kind of extended voir dire, and, in fact, we would

5

say it's absolutely necessary to assure that the

6

defendant receives the fair and impartial jury to which

7

he's entitled.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

little or Martha Stewart was too much?

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

12
13

So either this was too

Well, I think the former

rather than the latter -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but it's -- it’s

14

a different model of it.

15

if you have an experienced judge who goes through this

16

all the time, I think it's reasonable for him to say:

17

bring the person in front of me.

18

I can identify the problems, look him in the eye, and I’ve

19

got a lot of experience picking a jury, and it's better to

20

let me do it than to have the lawyers have 3 weeks to do it.

21

As Mr. Dreeben was explaining,

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Look,

We’ve got a questionnaire.

Well, you don't necessarily

22

need all of that, Your Honor, but I think with respect

23

to the way in which the district court, in fact,

24

conducted this voir dire, if I could just take -- if I

25

could just direct the Court's attention to one juror in
60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

particular -- and, Justice Breyer, this is -- maps onto

2

some of the points you were making.

3

and the relevant exchange is at pages 931a to 932a of

4

the Joint Appendix, which is at -- in -- in volume 2.

5

This is juror 61,

And I think the way the trial court

6

conducted the voir dire in this case exhibits the

7

manifest flaws in his approach generally.

8

someone who at page 932a, it's revealed, answered the

9

question whether she was angry, whether there was anger

This is

10

about Enron, with yes, quote -- it was, quote, “based out

11

of greed, hurt a lot of innocent people.”

12

And to paint the picture more fully, the

13

person was also asked:

14

collapse of Enron?

15

criminal, caused a huge shock wave which the entire

16

community felt,” close quote.

Do you have an opinion about the

To which the answer was, quote, “Yes,

17

Now, at 931a at the top, she was asked the

18

question whether she had the opinion about Mr. Lay and

19

her answer was, quote, “Shame on him.”

20

And then much of this was put before her in

21

the course of the voir dire.

In the middle of page

22

932a, the first answer -- she's asked the question:

23

you presume as you start this trial that Mr. Lay is

24

innocent?”

25

don't know.

“Can

The answer is, “I hope so, but you know, I
I can't honestly answer that one way or
61
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

another.”

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then on 932, she does answer

3

it, and says, “He's assumed innocent.”

“And can you

4

conscientiously carry out that assumption?”

5

honestly say I will give it my best.”

“I could

6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Not until --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so the judge looks her

8

in the eye and says -- fine.

9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, not -- not until this

10

happens first, Justice Breyer, between 932a and 933a.

11

And so she's asked, “So that might -- might your views

12

about Ken Lay cloud your judgment relative to criminal

13

responsibility?”

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see.

15

MR. SRINIVASAN:

And her answer is --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'll read that again.

And I'll --

But my

17

question is, can we get a hold of these 238 questionnaires?

18

Are they in the record in front of us?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

19

I believe that they are.

I

20

think that they’re certainly in the record before the court

21

of appeals.

So I think that they are.
