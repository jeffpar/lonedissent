CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

General Kagan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9
10

GENERAL KAGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The Establishment Clause does not prohibit

11

the sensible action Congress took in enacting Section

12

8121 and thereby divesting the Federal Government of the

13

property at issue in this case.

14

The district court gave Congress two basic

15

options when it found the Sunrise Rock War Memorial

16

unconstitutional.

17

permanently removing the memorial, ending the dispute,

18

but also doing away with a memorial that for 75 years

19

had commemorated America's fallen soldiers and had

20

acquired deep meaning for the veterans in the community.

First, Congress could accede to

21

Or, second, Congress -

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Kagan, just as a

23

factual matter, is there any other national memorial

24

that consists of a solitary cross, just that one symbol

25

and no other?
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

GENERAL KAGAN:

I don't believe that there

2

is, Justice Ginsburg.

3

have some religious content to them.

4

example, a statue of a Catholic priest holding a very

5

large cross, but most national memorials are -- are not

6

religious.

7

There are national memorials that
There is, for

Some are.
The -- the -- you know, I think that it

8

would even be possible, for example, to make a church or

9

a synagogue a national memorial.

If -- if Dr. King's

10

church were selected as a national memorial because of

11

-- in order to honor Dr. King, I think that would be

12

permissible.

13

If -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, I was just curious

14

as a factual matter whether this lone cross, if -- if

15

there was any other memorial like that, and your answer

16

is no, but there could be other religiously oriented

17

memorials?

18

GENERAL KAGAN:

Yes, and there is at least

19

one religiously oriented memorial that I know of, which

20

is a priest holding a cross.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

What are the practical

22

consequences of something being designated as a national

23

memorial?

24
25

GENERAL KAGAN:

Very little, Justice Alito.

In fact, it has no consequences in terms of the
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government's supervision of the land.

National

2

memorials can be on private land or on public land.

3

they are on private land, nothing goes along with the

4

designation by way of more extensive regulation or

5

supervision by the National Park Service.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If

Is the -- is the private

7

property owner who has this designation free to destroy

8

it after it's been designated a national memorial?

9

GENERAL KAGAN:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

The

10

Veterans of Foreign Wars here could in fact take down

11

this memorial once it is transferred to them, if the

12

Court allows that transfer.

13
14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

substitute whatever other memorial they chose?

15

GENERAL KAGAN:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17
18

Could they then

The Or would there have to be

some government approval?
GENERAL KAGAN:

No, no, no.

The

19

reversionary clause which is at issue, which is a part

20

of the transfer legislation, says that the VFW will have

21

to put up a veterans memorial, but the content of that

22

veterans memorial is entirely up to the VFW.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it wouldn't

24

automatically require acquire a national memorial

25

status, would it, when the government hasn't seen it,
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hasn't -- I thought that to get national memorial

2

status, the government has to approve what you put up.

3

GENERAL KAGAN:

Yes, that's correct.

If the

4

VFW took down this memorial and substituted a different

5

memorial, that memorial would not at that point have

6

national memorial status.

7

There is a little bit of a dispute as to

8

whether the -- the VFW could in fact take down the

9

memorial or whether it's designation as a national

10

memorial would prevent them from doing that.

11

it's quite clear, if you look at the statute, that the

12

Section 1369, which is what the Respondents point to,

13

would not prevent the VFW from taking down this

14

memorial, if it so wanted to, because 1369 applies only

15

to national memorials which are on public property.

16

the transfer were to take place, of course, it would not

17

be on public property, or it would not be under the

18

supervision, in any way, of the Federal Government.

19

So -

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think

If

General Kagan, before you

21

go -- go on with your argument, you presented it as -

22

as though the issue before us is the -- the conveying of

23

the land.

24
25

But is it?
What this was was simply an affirmation of

the prior injunction.

The court of appeals said the
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prior injunction had not been mooted by the -- by the

2

transfer of the land.

3

that -- that prior injunction, when the land did indeed

4

belong to the government, whether that prior injunction

5

was valid?

6

So isn't really the issue whether

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, there is a question in

7

this case whether the prior injunction was valid and was

8

the display itself a violation of the Establishment

9

Clause.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

GENERAL KAGAN:

Right.
But the government argued

12

below that that question had been mooted out because of

13

the passage of the transfer legislation.

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:
appeals say no?

16
17

But didn't the court of

GENERAL KAGAN:

The court of appeals did say

no, but it remands the government -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So -- so what we have

19

before us is the court of appeals' affirmation of the

20

prior injunction, which applied to a cross on public

21

land.

22

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, I think what you have

23

before you, there were of course two stages in this

24

litigation, and the first stage declared the display

25

unconstitutional, and then the second stage declared the
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

transfer as well unconstitutional or at least a

2

violation of the prior injunction.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, if I -- if I

4

thought the display wasn't unconstitutional, the

5

transfer would a fortiori not -

6

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, that is correct.

We

7

do think that the issue before the Court now is the

8

congressional legislation which has been passed, which

9

is the transfer legislation, that that has essentially

10

changed the situation on the ground, so that no longer

11

is the question whether the display from the -- whether

12

the display by the government would be constitutional,

13

but only whether the government has the ability to

14

transfer this property and -- and to give up all

15

supervision, all control over it.

16

So that the message -

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't see why that's the

18

issue before us.

Look, procedurally this is a little

19

boring, but it seems pretty well established in the law.

20

I read a case called Toledo Scale and then there are a

21

bunch of cases on jurisdiction, which I'm not going to

22

name them because I'm sure you looked at them, but

23

Travelers Indemnity, et cetera.

24

make absolutely clear that once a litigant, you and the

25

others, have had an opportunity to raise a matter and

And it seems to me they

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

now the case is over, done, but for an injunction that

2

stays in, all those issues that they previously raised

3

or could have raised are gone; that the only question

4

left is whether the government has complied with the

5

injunction.

6

So I read the injunction.

The injunction

7

says the government is enjoined from permitting the

8

display of the Latin cross, period.

9

effect and you follow it, you are violating that

10

injunction.

11

that.

12

Once this law takes

You don't need nine proceedings to see

You are violating it.
Now, if you don't like the injunction

13

because you think the statute has so changed the

14

circumstances there is no need for it, there is a

15

remedy.

16

Judge, change the injunction.

17

that.

18

whether the Ninth Circuit is right in saying when you

19

carry the statute into effect, you are violating this

20

injunction, which I think no one could say you aren't.

21

You go back to the district court and you say:
But you haven't done

And therefore, the only question before us is

Now, now, that -- that's a very technical

22

boring issue.

23

I don't see how we could reach any other issue in this

24

case.

25

I don't know why we heard this issue, but

GENERAL KAGAN:

Justice Breyer, I think we
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are in perfect compliance with the injunction and have

2

been since the day it was issued.

3

were two injunctions issued.

4

stages of this litigation.

5

injunction that said do not display the war memorial.

6

In compliance with that injunction, the next day the war

7

memorial was covered.

8

the -- from the moment that the decision issued.

9

Now, in fact there

As I said, there were two
The first stage ended in an

So we were in compliance from

Now then, Respondents went back to the

10

district court and asked for additional relief, because

11

what -- during the first court of appeals hearing,

12

Congress had passed this transfer statute.

13

Respondents went back and said:

14

injunction that you previously gave us, we essentially

15

need a new injunction and that injunction will be to

16

stop the transfer.

17
18
19

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so the

In addition to the

But that's not what I'm

talking about.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the Respondents

20

asked to have the injunction enforced.

It is typical,

21

you get an injunction -- and I'm glad that the

22

government has recognized that that was indeed a final

23

decision because you appealed it to the Ninth Circuit

24

under 1291 as a final decision.

25

are you complying with the injunction.

Then the question is,

10
Alderson Reporting Company

One side says,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the winner -- who by the way has unquestioned standing

2

to enforce the injunction that is now final that that

3

party obtained -- the winner says:

4

enforce the injunction.

5

injunction.

6

just explained, says, do not permit the cross.

7

party comes in and says:

8

all I want you to do is enforce it.

9
10

Court, please

They are not asking for a new

They say this injunction, as Justice Breyer
The

Here's my injunction; court,

GENERAL KAGAN:

Justice Ginsburg, this is

much more than an enforcement action.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

We are talking about the

12

first.

We are talking about the first injunction.

The

13

first injunction says that the government may not permit

14

display.

15

permitting display.

You've covered it up, so you are not
You are in compliance.

16

GENERAL KAGAN:

That is correct.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what the plaintiff here

18

said is that when you comply with this statute, you will

19

not be in compliance, because you will turn it over to

20

the VFW that will uncover it, so you will have permitted

21

it to be displayed.

22

before us.

23

Now, that I can see is an issue

But I don't see any other issue before us.
GENERAL KAGAN:

Justice Breyer, again, the

24

Respondents had to go back to the district court in

25

order not just to enforce the injunction, which said
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

don't display the statue, but to get additional relief,

2

which was don't transfer the statue.

3

had taken place, it would no longer have been the

4

government's property, the government would not have

5

permitted or not permitted the display because it wasn't

6

the government's property to permit or not to permit the

7

display.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If the transfer

It seems to me unreasonable

to read the injunction to say the government shall not

10

permit anybody to display a cross on that land no matter

11

who owns the land.

12

will not permit the cross to be displayed on this parcel

13

of government land.

14

I assume the injunctions meant you

GENERAL KAGAN:

And the Ninth Circuit

15

specifically said -- when this came to the Ninth

16

Circuit, the Ninth Circuit was asked by the Respondents.

17

In order to rule on the transfer legislation, the Ninth

18

Circuit specifically said:

19

that's a decision for another day, a separate decision.

20

Because of that, the Respondents had to go back to the

21

district court and had to get the district court

22

essentially to modify the injunction and to provided

23

additional relief.

24
25

We are not going to do that;

Now, there is some question as to whether
the standing question here, just the standing question
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is precluded, and our view is that it is not preclude,

2

because the way the government views this is it's one

3

entire litigation in which all issues are open.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you know, General

5

Kagan, any case in which there has been a permanent

6

injunction ordered, final, no more appeals are possible,

7

where -- and standing was in question, raised,

8

litigated, and decided, and then when the party who won

9

the injunction comes to the court and says, court,

10

please enforce the injunction, that you can say, now we

11

can go back to square one and argue again about

12

standing?

13

determined by a final judgment.

14

I don't see how you can revive what has been

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, either this is one

15

litigation, in which all cases are before the Court, or

16

it's too entirely separate litigations, in which case

17

the Court has an obligation to independently consider

18

the standing question.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, we know it isn't

20

that because, as I think you pointed out, the same

21

docket number.

22

motion to enforce the judgment.

23

This wasn't a new complaint.

GENERAL KAGAN:

This was a

It couldn't have been a

24

motion to enforce the judgment because the government

25

was in compliance with the judgment and because the
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Ninth Circuit had said that the question that

2

respondents were raising was an entirely separate issue

3

for another day, according to the Ninth Circuit.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would suppose -- I

5

guess I don't agree with your dichotomy, either it's the

6

same action or it's entirely separate.

7

it could be some issues carry over and are the same, and

8

perhaps standing is one of those.

9

completely new, such as the effect of the legislation,

I would suppose

Other issues are

10

which couldn't have been before the district court since

11

it hadn't been passed.

12

But standing is different.

I mean, once

13

it's been determined that there is standing and that is

14

reflected in a final judgment, then I think the later

15

aspects are simply whether the person -- once it's

16

embodied in a judgment, I think that is the basis for

17

standing and not the earlier questions of whether he

18

visited it enough or planned to visit enough.

19

GENERAL KAGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, we could

20

not have taken the standing question to this Court in

21

the -- in the procedural posture that the case was at at

22

that point.

23

action on our part to ask this Court to address the

24

standing issue after the first court of appeals judgment

25

where -- where we knew that we were going to relitigate

It would have been really an irresponsible

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the question of the validity of the transfer.

2

couldn't have come to you, we wouldn't have come to you,

3

as the Solicitor General's Office and asked you to

4

adjudicate a decision that was as likely as not going to

5

be irrelevant.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We

I don't understand -- I

7

don't understand that point at all.

If you thought that

8

he didn't have standing to challenge the cross at all

9

and that the injunction itself directing you to cover up

10

the cross was wrong, you should have come to the Court.

11

It was a permanent injunction.

12

interlocutory appeal rights, you have final judgment

13

rights.

14

order for us to take that flag -- to take that cross off

15

this land was just plain wrong.

16

You were told you have

At any point you could have come and said:

GENERAL KAGAN:

The

I think, Justice Sotomayor,

17

you are right that we could have, but I don't think that

18

we would have used our discretion, in a sense knocking

19

on this Court's door, the Solicitor General's Office

20

discretion, in order to ask you to decide a question

21

that was as likely or not going to be completely

22

irrelevant depending on what happened with respect to

23

the transfer statute.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But interlocutory appeal

or finality doesn't matter what you are going to do to
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

get away from the injunction.

The issue is did you give

2

up any rights to challenge any of the issues embodied in

3

that injunction and you haven't answered why not.

4

may have a right, and you do, to challenge a

5

modification of that injunction.

6

here to do, to say the Ninth Circuit erred in modifying

7

the injunction and stopping the transfer.

8

legitimate point, because the injunction has been

9

changed.

You

That's what you are

Perfectly

But you can't go back and relitigate whether

10

he had standing to challenge that -- the presence of

11

that cross.

12

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, Justice Sotomayor, I

13

appreciate the distinction that you are making between

14

the standing question and the merits question and I

15

think you are exactly right as to that point.

16

whatever the question as to whether we have given up the

17

standing question, certainly there is no such question

18

on the merits of this -- of the validity of this

19

transfer.

20

question is -- is not the way you described it.

21

it's partly because we couldn't have come to this Court

22

or we wouldn't have come, is a better way to say it.

23

would have thought that it was not the right kind of

24

position to ask the Court to take certiorari on a

25

question that basically was very likely, we thought, was

But

But with respect, I think that the standing

16
Alderson Reporting Company

And

We

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

very likely to go away.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but that -- that's

3

because -- that's because you assume the act is going to

4

be valid.

5

such an important case Congress is taking action, and

6

therefore, you should hear our standing argument to

7

avoid the necessity of the Legislative Branch having to

8

come in.

9

You could have come here and said:

This is

You could have said that.
GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, but we didn't, because

10

we did think that Congress had acted appropriately and

11

that the congressional act was valid, and continue to do

12

so, continue to think that this -

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but the standing

14

issue was independently important to the government,

15

because the government can face this kind of question

16

again, and if you right -- if you were right on the

17

standing point -- I mean, I don't understand why the

18

government would not have had a strong incentive to say,

19

we want to get rid of these cases on the standing

20

ground, we think the Court was wrong on standing.

21

But in any case, you didn't do that, and I

22

think that you started your argument this morning in the

23

right place when you said, let's talk about this law.

24

Congress said, accepting arguendo that the Court was

25

right, here's a law that cures the constitutional
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

defect.

And that's where you were -- that's where you

2

started your argument.

3

But -

4

Maybe you can pick up with that.

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

this clear procedurally.

6

more second.

7

But just I want to just get

I'm sorry.

It'll take one

As I read this, there is no modification of

8

any injunction.

9

for, he said:

What the -- what the Respondent asked
Judge, either hold that the transfer

10

violates the current injunction, or modify the

11

injunction.

12

said the proposed transfer violates the permanent

13

injunction.

14

the third paragraph of the July 24th order, and it says,

15

you are permanently enjoined from permitting the display

16

of the Latin cross.

17

modify it, and held that -

18

GENERAL KAGAN:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then what the district court did do is he

The permanent injunction is in the, like,

Therefore, he rejected the need to

Justice Breyer.
-- this violates the

20

injunction as written, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed

21

that.

22

So is there any question in this case of

23

modifying?

Is there any question other than the one

24

that I think Justice Scalia was taking a good argument

25

about, whether the proposed statute violates the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

July 24th injunction?

2

Or why am I wrong?

3

That's what the case is about.

GENERAL KAGAN:

You -- you are incorrect,

4

Justice Breyer, because in addition to saying this

5

violates the previously given injunction, the district

6

court said, you are enjoined from transferring this

7

property in accordance with this statute.

8

was additional relief, additional relief that the Ninth

9

Circuit said was additional relief that it wasn't

And so there

10

deciding in the first go-round, and that's -- and that

11

places the question, the merits question of the validity

12

of this transfer, directly before the Court.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Thank you.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Before we get -

15

before your time expires, we would like to spend a

16

couple of minutes on the merits.

17

(Laughter.)

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

GENERAL KAGAN:

We do not, Justice Stevens.

8

The government has argued -- argued below that there was

9

no violation prior to the transfer statute, and that

10

remains the government's position, although, as I said

11

to Justice Scalia, we think that that position has been

12

overtaken by events and that the only question before

13

the Court is the transfer statute.

14

I was going to go on to say to the Chief

15

Justice that, in addition to the fact that private

16

inholdings just riddle the preserve, the government is

17

perfectly happy to put up signs which make clear that

the -- the plot in question will not in fact be the

government's, but will be the VFW's.

are a great many identification signs throughout the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How is the question

of -- I don't want to get into your rebuttal time, but

12

briefly, how is the question of whether signs are or

13

aren't valid or required before us in this case?

14

are no signs there, and you are asking us to consider

15

whether the statute is valid or not.

GENERAL KAGAN:

There

I think, Mr. Chief Justice,

17

that if we were not going to put up signs, it would

still be valid.

And as I said, there are many, many private

MR. ELIASBERG:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Justice Breyer, I would like to direct my

beginning remarks to you.

I believe you've correctly

21

stated the procedural posture exactly right.

Then he did two other things, which he listed

10

Now, I take it that those paragraphs 3 and 4

11

are an implementation of the July 24 injunction which he

12

granted, not a new injunction.

13

MR. ELIASBERG:

That's exactly correct.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that's the issue here

15

that we were just possibly debating.

16

case is whether the district judge might lawfully

17

enforce an old injunction in the manner he did, which

18

was to add paragraphs 3 and 4.

MR. ELIASBERG:

The issue in the

That question you

I believe that's -- that is

here and that is really the only question that is here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that under your

23

approach that this is looking to see if the injunction

24

is being enforced or violated, we would be reviewing an

25

act of Congress under an abuse of discretion standard,
26
Alderson Reporting Company

not -- not de novo?

2
3
4
5

MR. ELIASBERG:

That's correct.

But for

this CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Have we ever done

that before?

6

MR. ELIASBERG:

I -

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Have we ever said

8

that an act of Congress is unconstitutional without a

9

de novo review of the merits of the constitutionality?

10

MR. ELIASBERG:

I am not aware of that, but

11

I am also not aware of a situation where the act of

12

Congress is being put forth as the response to an

13

already adjudicated constitutional violation.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Eliasberg, I thought

15

that the Ninth Circuit the first time around had taken

16

meticulous care to make certain that the issue of the

17

validity of the statute would not be before the Court in

18

the first round.

view as to whether a transfer completed under Section

20

8121 would pass constitutional muster, but leave this

21

question for another day."

Judge Kozinski wrote:

"We express no

22

That's on page 104a of the petition.

23

And then the district judge said:

24

recognize the Ninth Circuit didn't touch the validity of

25

that statute, left it for another day.
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Yes, I

The day has

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

come.

2

deciding the question of whether section 8121 passes

3

constitutional muster.

4

So it is for the first time that the Court is

MR. ELIASBERG:

The only thing I would

5

disagree with you on that point, Justice Ginsburg, is

6

that the question is whether the act of Congress

7

remedies the already adjudicated constitutional

8

violation and is consistent with the injunction.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So when you get to

10

the consistent with the injunction part -- I thought it

11

was your position that we should review this question

12

solely under an abuse of discretion standard?

13

MR. ELIASBERG:

It is our position -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Because while the

15

Court did not decide the validity of the act in the

16

first case, it certainly did in the second case, which

17

is why we have the case before us.

18

MR. ELIASBERG:

That is correct.

We

19

believe -- but may I make two points, Mr. Chief Justice?

20

First, we believe in the enforcement context

21

where the question is, is this a violation of an already

22

entered injunction that was part of a final judgment,

23

that that is traditional equity principles that you

24

review for an abuse of discretion.

25

believe that we win even under a de novo standard.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Nonetheless, we

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So -- and if I could set forth some of the reasons for

2

that.

3

I think, Justice Breyer, that you have it

4

exactly correct, that what the government has done here

5

by selecting a particular transferee who has been given

6

preferential access to the land in the past to the

7

exclusion of others who wanted to erect other symbols,

8

that the government is taking affirmative steps to

9

permit, through this transfer statute, the display of

10

the cross that they are enjoined from doing.

11

Now, Justice Scalia, I believe your point is

12

at some point if this is on private land and the

13

government is not making any efforts to further this

14

display, that it couldn't possibly be that the

15

injunction forbids that.

16

but that is not the case we have in front of it.

17

And that may well be correct,

The government in this transfer statute has

18

made a significant number of affirmative steps to ensure

19

that the cross remains up.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

It has selected When this injunction was

21

first entered the statute -- nobody contemplated that

22

this statute was going to be enacted; isn't that

23

correct?

24
25

MR. ELIASBERG:

When the district court

entered the injunction, that is correct.
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.

So isn't the sensible

2

interpretation of the injunction that it was prohibiting

3

the government from permitting the display of the cross

4

on government property, and not on private property that

5

happens to be within the Mojave National Preserve?

6

MR. ELIASBERG:

I don't believe so, Justice

7

Scalia -- excuse me -- Justice Alito, for a couple of

8

reasons.

9

One of the bases for the entry of the

10

government had favored one party to come on, contrary to

11

the government's own regulations, and erect a permanent

12

symbol, while not allowing others.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Wasn't your argument that

14

this was a violation of the Establishment Clause because

15

it was on government land?

16

that even if this was on one of the ranches within the

17

Mojave National Preserve, it would still be a violation

18

of the Establishment Clause?

19
20
21

MR. ELIASBERG:

Did you make the argument

We did not make that

argument because it wasn't presented to the Court.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, it was a totally -- so

22

the situation completely changed and the district court

23

either modified the injunction -- it seems to me

24

modified the injunction by interpreting it to mean

25

something quite different from what anybody contemplated
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it meant when it was originally entered?

2

MR. ELIASBERG:

Well, I think that, as is

3

traditional equity principles, the district court is at

4

some level the master of its injunction and that's why

5

we give an abuse of discretion standard.

court very clearly said:

7

the government not to abide by my injunction; they are

8

favoring the same parties they favored when -- that was

9

part of the -

10

The district

I see this as an attempt by

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, of course, it was

11

that, but the question is whether it was a permissible

12

amendment by the government of the situation.

13

course, I will stipulate that the government was trying

14

to arrange it so that the cross could remain there.

15

that doesn't mean that it was -- it was evading the

16

injunction.

Of

But

I mean, that's -

17

19

clearly applied to the erection of a cross on private

20

land that the government had -- had transferred.

21

MR. ELIASBERG:

Well, but it's not the

22

erection of the cross.

It is the transfer of something

23

where the government has a reversionary interest.

24

very much directs the way the VFW is likely to use the

MR. ELIASBERG:

But that doesn't mean that

Well, I believe it's invalid

because I think that the affirmative steps they are

taking here really make them -- put them in a position

where they are permitting -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you disagree with

what she told us, which is that the private property

9

MR. ELIASBERG:

I think that there are very

significant obstacles to their doing that.

One, I don't

10

-- I disagree with the General's -- General Kagan's

11

description of the criminal statute that prohibits the

12

defacement of memorials on private land, because one of

13

the provisions is that we will consider it a situation

14

that is covered by the statute that the land be under

15

the jurisdiction of the Federal Government.

16

land -- the statute that designated the Mojave Preserve

17

very clearly says that the land is being transferred

18

from the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management

19

to the National Park Service and the Secretary of the

20

Interior, so it is therefore clearly under the

21

jurisdiction of the Federal Government.

22

there is -- there are possible criminal violations.

23

There is also a significant question -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I think that

You say under the

36

Well, the

Does that -- do

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you just mean they have authority to regulate the land?

2

MR. ELIASBERG:

That's correct.

But that's

3

the way the statute is written, under Federal

4

jurisdiction, so I believe that those two terms -

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I suppose they

6

have jurisdiction to regulate a lot of -- lot of land

7

that they don't own.

8
9

MR. ELIASBERG:

Well I think that in this

case when the government is actually -- there's quite a

10

bit of case law -- we set forth some in our brief -

11

where they talk about the government's power over land

12

that's within a national preserve, so I do think that

MR. ELIASBERG:

symbol to honor Christians.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think you can leap

15

from that to the conclusion that the only war dead that

16

that cross honors are the Christian war dead.

17

that's an outrageous conclusion.

18

MR. ELIASBERG:

I think

Well, my -- the point of

19

my -- point here is to say that there is a reason the

20

Jewish war veterans came in and said we don't feel

21

honored by this cross.

because it is a religious symbol of another religion.

This cross can't honor us

The context of my

question was what does the plaque say?

not giving the full text, that was not my intention to

-- to mislead the Court or to you, Mr. Chief Justice.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

MR. ELIASBERG:

All right.

My only point is that in

20

that scenario, because did I believe we were talking

21

about, is the VFW free to do this, and I was pointing to

22

the criminal statute that I said I believe said that

23

they couldn't -- wouldn't feel free to take this down.

24

But second of all, that it would be odd indeed for them

25

to take it down when there is a big plaque that says

JUSTICE ALITO:

When the Solicitor General

3

represents to us that the VFW will be perfectly free to

4

modify this memorial in any way it chooses if they

5

obtain title to this land, do you think that there's any

6

realistic fear that they will be required to maintain

7

this cross, even if they wish to -- to change it in some

8

way?

9

MR. ELIASBERG:

Well, I think that there is

10

a real -- well, but -- but I don't think that the cases

11

turn on whether a prosecutor says well, I promise you

12

that we are not going to enforce the statute.

13

we have to look at the words of the statute and the

14

words of the reversionary interest, and I think they

15

both create significant doubt as to whether the VFW

16

would feel free to turn this -- to take it down, in the

17

same way that in a context where you are talking about

18

pre-enforcement -

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think

Well, I thought your

20

argument was that although there was going to be a

21

formal transfer of title, as a practical matter, the

22

government was still involved with the maintenance of

23

the cross on this land.

24

that that's not the case, I don't know why that doesn't

25

cure the practical problem.

And when the government says

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. ELIASBERG:

Well, that -- the -- the

2

question of government -- continued government

3

involvement with the land, I believe, continues, because

4

of the reversionary interest and because of the

5

designation as a national memorial.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Whatever the -

I think -- I think

7

General Kagan agreed that they -- the Veterans couldn't

substitute some other memorial, if it's going to be a

9

national monument it has to have the government's

10

approval.

11

approval is the cross.

12

And the only one that has the government's

MR. ELIASBERG:

That is correct, Justice

13

Ginsburg.

14

with respect to the question -

15

I don't want to speak for General Kagan but

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I -- I thought the

16

government's position was it had to be maintained as a

17

national war -- as a war memorial, but not that it had

18

to be maintained as a cross.

19

MR. ELIASBERG:

That is the government's

20

position.

But Justice Ginsburg, your question is would

21

something else they put up be a national memorial, and

the answer is no.

designate a national memorial.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. ELIASBERG:

I believe that that is

2

correct, Justice Stevens, and that's an important point

3

that is intertwined with the fact that the reversionary

4

interest also continues the government's ownership in

5

the land, when their whole position is, if we privatize

6

it, as Justice Scalia pointed out, if it's just a

7

private owner, then we don't associate this cross with

8

the government.

9

We associate it with the private owner.

But the government hasn't done that.

It has

10

maintained an important ownership interest in the land

11

through that reversionary interest.

12

further questions, I will -

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If there are no

May I ask this question:

14

Do you think the issues in this case would be -- stay

15

the same or different, if this whole scenario occurred

on the Mall in -- right out in front of the

17

Washington -- the Lincoln Memorial?

18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

Would the -- the issues be any different if
it were not an isolated memorial in the desert?
MR. ELIASBERG:

Context has always mattered

to this Court in Establishment Clause cases.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

And which way would it

cut, if it is different?
MR. ELIASBERG:

Well, I do think that

Washington is, certainly, a seat of power, and there is,
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

obviously, a close tie between something that is put on

2

the National Mall in the seat of government, but I do

3

think that the designation of a national memorial is

4

also significant.

5

So, even though this may be an area that is

6

not nearly as populated as Washington, D.C., it is very

7

significant that Congress has taken the step with this

8

particular symbol, one of only 49 in the country,

9

grouping it with other iconic statues and memorials in

10

this country and tied it.

11

So I don't think that the distinction,

12

although it might have some bearing in the Court, in

13

thinking of the context, I don't think it would change

14

the result.

15

Justice Kennedy, I want to go back to -- to

16

one question you had asked earlier about the posture,

17

and I just want to reiterate.

18

when the government was saying, well, we didn't have a

19

good reason to bring this to the Court, and that's why

20

we didn't, I think your question recognized that the

21

government had very good reasons.

22

You, very clearly, said,

But -- but in addition, it's not really

23

important, when you have a final judgment, why a party

24

chooses not to try to take the last step of appeal on a

25

final judgment, and that's the United States v.
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

Munsingwear case.
The government chose not to make that step.

3

The judgment was final, and there, certainly, is no

4

basis for this Court to reopen the issues about whether

5

Mr. Buono had standing in the first instance.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, wasn't -- isn't this

7

very different from the situation in Toledo

8

Steel because -- Scale, I'm sorry -- because, if the

9

merits issue that was before the Ninth Circuit was, if

10

not technically moot, nearly moot, by the time they

11

reached it, because of the passage of the new statute.

12

This wasn't -- they said it's not moot

13

because this is simply the voluntary cessation of

14

conduct that's been held to be unlawful, but that is

15

typically applied in the situation where there is a

16

legitimate fear that the -- the party that has been held

17

to be violating the Constitution may simply return to

18

its bad old ways, once the litigation is over.

19

But, here, you have the intervening

20

enactment of a statute by the Constitution -- by the

21

Congress of the United States, and I think it would be

22

quite far-fetched to presume that Congress is simply

23

going to repeal the statute and go back to the way

24

things were, once the litigation is over.

25

So you have a merits issue that's not -- if
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

technically moot, nearly moot.

2

the case is -- is expressly not decided by the Ninth

3

Circuit.

4

court.

5

because the government didn't appeal the standing issue

6

at a time when the real merits issue in the case had not

7

been decided.

8
9

The real merits issue in

They say, take that back to the district
And you say that the standing issue goes away

MR. ELIASBERG:
Justice Alito.

Well, two points, if I may,

First, the first reason that the Ninth

10

Circuit gave for why the case wasn't moot was not

11

voluntary cessation.

12

transfer could take up to two years to effectuate, so in

13

the Ninth Circuit, that this case is far from moot.

The government conceded the land

14

Two years is more than enough time to file

15

the government to file the petition for certiorari and

16

had a ruling, both on the merits of the land on -- the

17

cross on government property, but more important, as a

18

number of Justices had pointed out, the question of

19

standing to bring an Establishment Clause case, the

20

government always have an interest in saying, this case

21

should never have been brought.

22

have had a judgment entered against us.

23

We never should had

For the government to say, we didn't really

24

care at that point because, two years from now, the

25

transfer might be effectuated is not basis for them to
48

1

argue that there was no final judgment and no reason for

2

us to appeal.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think General Kagan

4

recognized that there isn't an example of a final

5

injunction, where, after it's final as it can be, you

6

can come back and say, but, now, I want to reargue the

7

standing question that's already been determined.

8
9

But there was something that I did want to
ask you about, Judge O'Scanlon's opinion.

He said,

10

if -- if you prevail and you are right, what happens in

11

Arlington Cemetery, where there's the Argonne Cross

12

Memorial and the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, both right

13

here in Arlington, what happens to them?

14

MR. ELIASBERG:

Going back, Justice

15

Ginsburg, to the merits on the earlier question about a

16

cross on government property, I believe that the Argonne

17

Cross in the national -- in memorial cemetery is

18

extremely different.

19

There are, in the national cemeteries,

20

the -- the VA offers, to veterans and their family, a

21

choice of putting up 39 different emblems and beliefs on

22

their tombstones.

23

is surrounded by a sea of tombstones with symbols of the

24

faith of all of the different service members.

25

In Arlington, there is a cross that

In that context, I don't think anyone would
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

perceive that the government was favoring one particular

2

religion because of the variety of choices and religious

3

symbols expressed there.

4

stand-alone cross of one religious symbol that is not

5

surrounded by any other context, other than -

6

That's very different from a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Has the government ever

7

turned down -- let's say the Jewish war veterans request

8

9

MR. ELIASBERG:

They did.

There was a

10

request made for -- to put up a memorial on the site,

11

and the government said no and said, our regulations

12

forbid it.

13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I am talking about -- on

this site?

15

MR. ELIASBERG:

Yes.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You know, well, I'm not

17

talking about this site, where there already was a

18

memorial, but suppose the -- what I'm getting at is I

19

don't agree with you, that -- that every time the

20

government allows any religious symbol to be erected, it

21

has to allow all religious symbols to be erected at the

22

same place, so long as it is -- it is not discriminatory

23

in -- in accepting or rejecting requests to erect

24

religious symbols in different places.

25

I don't see why the government is convicted
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of being discriminatory.

2

MR. ELIASBERG:

I think the context here is

3

what has the government done with respect to national

4

memorials.

5

stand-alone religious symbols are of one particular

6

religious denomination, and that's Christianity.

7

The only two national memorials that are

But -- but you don't -

and they -- were both of them proposed by a private

9

group, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars?

10

MR. ELIASBERG:

Well, it's Congress -- I

11

don't know that the Veterans of Foreign Wars ever

12

proposed that this be a national memorial.

13

designated it as one.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Congress

Well, but it was erected by

15

the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

16

any instance in which Jewish war veterans or if there is

17

18

erect a memorial on public land, it was turned down?

19

MR. ELIASBERG:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, do you know of

As I said before I just don't see why they

21

all have to be on the same piece of land, in -- in order

22

for the government to be impartial.

MR. ELIASBERG:

I'm not saying that in -

24

in -- that, in every circumstance, the government has to

25

have lots of different symbols, but what the government
51

has done here JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I think you are

3

saying that, and you are saying that this has to be a

7

In fact, I'm not even sure your -- your

MR. ELIASBERG:

You say it

Right?
Well, Justice Scalia, if I

8

make one prefatory point, the government didn't bring to

this Court the merits of the question of whether the

11

cross was permissible on government property.
There is a final judgment set in this

12

circumstance.

13

question is not properly before us, but context matters,

14

and I do think, in other circumstances, there may be

15

religious symbols.

16

symbols and the context of the situation will matter.

17

In this context, it is not.

So that

There may be a myriad of religious

But I think if, in Arlington, for example -

18

19

example, a foreign government -- let's take the Canadian

20

Cross of Sacrifice, which the government has put in its

21

brief, was donated by a foreign government to honor

22

people -- Americans who fought for Canada and the

23

British Empire, in I believe it was World War I, if the

24

State of Israel made a similar request to the United

25

States, we would like to honor the Jews who fought in
52
Alderson Reporting Company

If, for

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Operation Iraqi Freedom because we believe that that was

2

an important defense of the State of Israel, and the

3

United States said, no, we are not interested, I think

4

that that would create a quite significant

5

constitutional violation -- or constitutional question,

6

but it's not the case in front of us.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask a different

8

question, just based on your understanding of all these

9

monuments?

Are there any other federal monuments that

10

contained crosses, other than those associated with the

11

cemeteries?

12

MR. ELIASBERG:

The one national memorial

13

that I am aware of that has a cross, it is of Father

14

Marquette, who was a significant historical figure.

15

is not a stand-alone cross.

16

surrounded by a number of various objects that show his

17

role as a historical figure, exploring the middle west,

18

and he is holding a cross.

It

It is Father Marquette

19

But, again, I think -- I agree with General

20

Kagan that, if we honored Martin Luther King, who was a

21

priest, or we honored -- we did something with the Old

22

North Church which had significant historical

23

significance, that would create a very different issue

24

than simply a stand-alone cross, where, when the

25

National Park Service asked its own historian to
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

determine whether it had historical value necessary to

2

bring it within the National Register of Historic

3

Places, the Park Service's own historian said, no, it

4

did not.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, this

6

probably doesn't have anything to do with anything, but

7

I'm just kind of curious, why is this cross put up -

8

you know, in the middle of nowhere?

9

(Laughter. )

10

MR. ELIASBERG:

Because the man who

11

originally put up the cross -- not this one, because it

12

has been replaced a number of times, but the man who put

13

up this particular cross, I believe was a homesteader in

14

the area when the land was owned by the Bureau of Land

15

Management, and I believe was a miner on the land.

16

hope that is correct historically.

was to take down that memorial, which meant an enormous

7

amount to veterans in the community, or to completely

dissociate the government from that memorial.

9

Congress did was to completely dissociate the government

And the choice

And what

10

from that memorial while allowing some war memorial to

stand.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

How can you say that when

13

there's a reversionary interest?

14

completely dissociated?

15

interest if they don't maintain the cross, which is the

16

monument, it goes back to the government.

17

How can you say it's

There is a reversionary

GENERAL KAGAN:

Justice Stevens, with

18

respect, the reversionary interest says that the holder,

19

the VFW, has to maintain a war memorial.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21
22

Yes, but the particular

memorial described by Congress was this cross.
GENERAL KAGAN:

23

interest simply says:

24

to be this war memorial.

25

It does not -

No, the reversionary

A war memorial.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It does not have

Yes, but then it doesn't

-- I don't think it's fair to interpret Congress's

2

interest to being and preserving this memorial.

3

GENERAL KAGAN:

To the contrary, Justice

4

Stevens.

When Congress wanted to say "this memorial,"

5

it knew to how to say it, because it said it in the 2002

6

act.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

8

GENERAL KAGAN:

9

something very different.

Right.
In the 2004 act, it said

That was after the injunction

10

had issued, so it was a completely different set of

11

circumstances.

12

against this war memorial had issued.

13

We are going to give this back to the VFW, but it's

14

going to be the VFW's choice now as to what to do with

15

it, consistent with it being some kind of war memorial.

16

A reversionary interest of a kind that Congress often

17

uses to -- when it transfers land.

18

completely -

19

Congress understood that an injunction

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Congress said:

Congress -- it's a

Do you think anyone

20

thought there is the remotest possibility they would put

21

up a different memorial?

22

GENERAL KAGAN:

I think it's left to the

23

VFW, and it's entirely the VFW's choice.

24

or ten years from now or 50 years from now the VFW

decides, along with Respondents, that a cross is an

war memorial.

3

It's no longer the government's message.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

How can they say it's an

inappropriate war memorial when Congress has designated

the national memorial as, quote, "the five-foot-tall

GENERAL KAGAN:

And -

Again, I think it is

entirely up to the VFW.

3

GENERAL KAGAN:

Justice Stevens, you are, of

4

course, right that Congress thought at the beginning,

5

prior to the injunction, that this war memorial should

not be taken down, that there was an attachment to it in

7

the local community, and that it was -- that it should

Not an unnatural thing for Congress to

When the injunction issued and when the

court found that the -- when the Congress found that the

this -- preserve a war memorial, very possibly this war
