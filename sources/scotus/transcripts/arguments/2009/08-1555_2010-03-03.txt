CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We’ll hear

Mr. Dvoretzky.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. DVORETZKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

The FSIA applies to suits against foreign

11

officials for acts taken on the state's behalf, because

12

such suits are the equivalent of a suit against the

13

state directly.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Counsel, I -- I want to just

15

say that I have one problem with the case at the outset.

16

And I don't mean to interrupt the organization of your

17

argument.

18

a question that goes to the other counsel, too.

You might want to address it later.

And it’s

I'm having difficulty seeing how the issues

19
20

as presented in the brief really resolve very much.

21

Let's assume -- I know this is not your position.

22

assume the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act grants

23

immunity to the state for this conduct and for a

24

then-serving official who is its agent and for a former

25

agent.

Let's assume there is -- there is immunity.

Why

1

isn't it just repealed, overridden, by the later

2

enactment of the Torture Victims Protection Act?

3

I just don't see the issue structured that

4

way in the briefs, and I'm puzzled by it.

But I say that

5

at the outset, and I really didn't mean to interrupt your

6

-- your good introduction.

7

MR. DVORETZKY:

The Torture Victim

8

Protection Act creates a cause of action but is silent

9

about immunity, and, therefore, has to be interpreted

10

consistently with background immunity principles and

11

consistently with a preexisting statute codifying

12

immunity, rather than --

13
14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
you have for that?

15
16

What -- what authority do

MR. DVORETZKY:

I'm sorry.

Could you

repeat --

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

19

MR. DVORETZKY:

What case authority do you

20

thing.

Also, the government previously argued that the

21

TVPA has to be interpreted consistent with preexisting

22

immunity principles.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's like a -- it's like a

clear statement rule?

3

MR. DVORETZKY:

Yes.

If Congress wishes to

4

waive immunity, it has to do so expressly.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you are right about

6

that -- I guess it would be the same under the Alien Tort

7

Statute -- then the Filartiga case -- if the -- if there

8

had been a quest -- request to dismiss because Filartiga

9

was a former officer, and the same thing in Karadzic,

10

none of those could have gone forward?

11

MR. DVORETZKY:

If, in those cases, an

12

immunity defense had been asserted and it had been

13

established that the official was acting on behalf of

14

the state, then, yes, immunity would apply.

15

defenses were not asserted in those cases, though.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Those

Is there -- is there any

17

Alien Tort Statute or the torture statute that would

18

have survived, under your view, because your view is

19

it's no exception under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities

Act, end of case?
MR. DVORETZKY:

Absolutely, there are

be brought.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

that's not going to happen.

MR. DVORETZKY:

There are cases where it has

8

happened.

9

waived immunity when claims were brought against Marcos.

10

For example, the Philippines effectively

So it certainly could happen.

11

Congress envisioned that the statute would

12

be interpreted consistently with immunity principles.

13

The legislative history supports that inference.

14

are reports in the legislative history and a

15

floor statement by Senator Specter saying that the FSIA

16

could provide an immunity defense to a claim against an

17

official where the official can establish an agency

18

relationship with the state.

There

Here, there is no question that Mr. Samantar

19
20

was acting in an official capacity, because he is being

21

sued for his actions as a prime minister and as a

22

defense minister, in the midst of what was effectively

23

quelling a secessionist insurgency.

24

inherent --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

the Torture Victim Protection Act says “an individual

who, under actual or apparent authority, or under color

Why isn't that a clear statement?

And then

6

I’ll get off this hobby horse, and you can get back to

talking about the FSIA.

against state sponsors of terrorism.

15

It's not a clear statement that speaks

And, again, where Congress has wanted to

And Dellmuth v. Muth, I think, is on point

16

because there the Court held that even though a cause of

17

action was created that would principally apply only to

18

state agencies, that in and of itself was not sufficient

19

to waive the sovereign immunity of the states.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I’ll jump on

21

the hobby horse even if Justice Kennedy is jumping off.

22

I mean, the -- the exception in the TVPA is

23

to the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state.

25

of action.

11

In the TVPA, all that Congress did was to

12

create a cause of action.

13

14

of immunity.

15

And so that cause of action

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, when you -- going

16

back to where you started -- you started saying the

17

officer must go together with the state, because in

18

reality it's the same thing; it's a suit against the

19

state.

20

But this is a case seeking money out of the

21

pocket of Samantar and no money from the treasury of

22

Somalia, so why is the suit against the officer here

23

equivalent to a suit against the state?

24

MR. DVORETZKY:

25

Because the touchstone of

foreign sovereign immunity law, which the FSIA codified,
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is that one nation's courts cannot sit in judgment of

2

another nation's acts.

3

asserted in this case is Samantar's acts on behalf of

4

the state of Somalia.

5

And the basis for liability that’s

The issue is not who pays the judgment; the

6

issue is whose acts are in question.

7

domestic context, of course, the distinction between

8

personal liability and liability from the state may

9

matter, but that's only because --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now, in the

Well, that sounds like

11

you're -- you're talking about an “act of state” doctrine,

12

not that the suit against one is the equivalent of a

13

suit against the other.

14

MR. DVORETZKY:

The “act of state” doctrine

15

is distinct from immunity doctrines, although they have

16

certain shared underpinnings and shared comity

17

considerations.

18

doctrine is concerned with not judging the acts of

19

foreign states, so too is foreign sovereign immunity

20

law.

21

foreign sovereignty immunity law.

22

And just as the under -- act of state

That's the fundamental premise of foreign -- of

In the domestic context, courts do sometimes

23

say that an official can be sued for personal liability

24

because he wasn't acting for the state if he violated

25

the state's controlling law.

U.S. courts are able to

9
Alderson Reporting Company

make that determination because our courts are the

ultimate arbiters of domestic law.

3

the ultimate arbiters of foreign law.

4

determination that an official was not acting for a

foreign state because he must have violated the foreign

state's law or international law is precisely what

7

foreign sovereign immunity prohibits.

8
9

U.S. courts are not
In fact, a

So in the foreign sovereign immunity
context, as long as the underlying acts are those of the

10

state, foreign sovereign immunity prohibits the case

11

from proceeding.

12

And that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm not sure that I

13

followed your distinction of the domestic law, per se,

14

because say, the Federal Tort Claims Act, to come within

15

that Act and to have the government cover it, the

16

officer has to be acting within the scope of her

17

employment, however careless or reckless she may be.

18

MR. DVORETZKY:

That -- and that goes to

19

when the government would be liable for the employee's

20

acts.

21

when the official can be personally liable for acts of

22

the state.

23

official can be liable when he must not have been acting

24

for the state because he violated the state's

25

controlling law.

In our case, what we’re talking about here is

And in the domestic context, we say the

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Foreign sovereign immunity prohibits that

2

determination with respect to the law of foreign states,

3

and it prohibits U.S. courts from imposing their view of

4

international law on other courts to conclude that an

5

official must not have been acting for his state.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

How will a court determine

7

whether an official was acting within the official scope

8

of the official's responsibilities?

9

MR. DVORETZKY:

Ordinarily, the foreign

10

state would tell you, and that would be dispositive of

11

the matter.

12

If the foreign state doesn't tell you, you

13

would look at the nature of the allegations in the

14

complaint and see if they fall within a category of

15

conduct that is inherently viewed in -- as sovereign.

16

Atop that list --

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the court can't tell

18

by looking at the complaint?

19

direct communication between the court and the foreign

20

government on this issue?

21

MR. DVORETZKY:

Is there going to be

A foreign government

22

ordinarily is going to -- is going to get involved in

23

the case and indicate whether it wishes to assert

24

immunity on behalf of the official or not.

25

For example, there have been several cases
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

involving suits against Israeli officials, and the

2

Israeli embassy communicated to the courts and to the

3

State Department that these were acts of Israel and the

4

official policy of the state.

5

Again, if you don't have that, though, it's

6

not going to be a difficult inquiry, typically, to look

7

and see whether inherently sovereign acts are what's at

8

issue.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Legislative --

So how is the inquiry

12

any different than the one that would go under the

13

common law head of state inquiry?

14

different in the two?

15

MR. DVORETZKY:

What would be

I -- I think the inquiry as

16

to whether it's an official act would be the same, but

17

head of state immunity is a different sort of immunity

18

than sovereign immunity.

19

it covers even personal acts by a head of state while he’s

20

in office, whereas for foreign sovereign immunity,

21

what you’re looking to distinguish is whether the

22

official was engaged in personal activity or whether he

23

was engaged in acts on behalf of the state.

24
25

It's much broader, insofar as

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. DVORETZKY:

is a different body of common law immunity that the

FSIA --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So why can't this be a -- a

different body of common law?
MR. DVORETZKY:

Do you mean, why

can't this -JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

I mean, you’re saying

11

they -- they left head of state immunity to the common

12

law, did not incorporate it in the Foreign Sovereign

13

Immunities Act.

14

did not do the same for -- for agent of state immunity?

15

Why -- why should I believe that they

MR. DVORETZKY:

Because head of state

16

immunity is not a form of sovereign immunity.

17

Congress did in this Act was it codified the law of

18

foreign sovereign immunity.

19

sovereign immunity of the state was always understood to

20

extend to officials for their official acts.

21

And what

At common law, the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Wait a minute.

Why --

22

why -- that doesn't make any sense to me.

23

have had the creation of all of these common law

24

immunities attached to foreign individuals like consular

25

and diplomatic and heads of state if state sovereign
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Why would we

Official

1

immunity was going to cover them naturally?

2

MR. DVORETZKY:

Because consular and

3

diplomatic immunity are very different in scope and in

4

purpose than state sovereign immunity.

5

There are two sources of immunity that an

6

individual might be entitled to.

7

that flows from the state itself for official acts, and

8

there is immunity that flows from the individual's

9

office, like diplomatic and consular immunity.

10

There is the immunity

Diplomatic and consular immunity are meant

11

to ensure that states can conduct their business without

12

tying up their officials while they are in office in

13

litigation in foreign courts over any matters, personal

14

or official.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm trying to go before

16

the Act, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, before it

17

was passed, because that was Congress's first statement,

18

and we have to figure out what they intended to replace

19

or not replace.

20

Before the Act came in, what activities of a

21

consular office would not have been covered under the

22

foreign sovereign immunity of a state?

23

could a diplomat have engaged in or a consular officer

24

have engaged in that state immunity, as it was

25

understood at the time, would not have given him or her?
14
Alderson Reporting Company

What activity

Official

1

MR. DVORETZKY:

He could get into a car

2

accident.

Diplomatic and consular immunity would

3

prevent the diplomat or the consul from being sued for

4

tort damages for a car accident in a foreign state.

5

Official immunity would not, because driving

6

is not considered an official policy of the state in the

7

way that, as I was saying to Justice Alito, police or

8

military conduct would be.

9

So that's the distinction between official

10

conduct and conduct that may well be within the scope of

11

employment but is not entitled to the state's immunity.

12

And where Congress --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can -- can you get to the

14

text of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that you --

15

that you assert embraces this personal immunity?

16

MR. DVORETZKY:

Section 1603(a) -- excuse

17

me -- section 1604 says that “a foreign state shall be

18

immune from the jurisdiction” of the United States and of

19

the States.

20

for his official act, that is effectively subjecting the

21

foreign state itself to U.S. jurisdiction.

22

When a suit is brought against an official

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose that the -- the

23

Department of the Army orders clothes for the soldiers

24

25

15

2

Now, it's a private entity, and someone would

4

for what happened years ago when they were part of the

6

state.

8

blocks the suit, or some other principle?

9

immunity in that case was head of state immunity, which

saying if a state disappears, it no longer exists, so

than in the incident where the entity is no longer

16

MR. DVORETZKY:

Because ultimately, what

17

foreign sovereign immunity and this statute are

18

concerned with is protecting a foreign state's act from

19

being judged in court.

20

In your example of the Department of the

21

Army which subsequently is bought by another company,

22

and the foreign state exists, the foreign state's acts

23

are still being judged regardless of the status of that

It serves different purposes.

15

16

not only from liability, but an immunity from the

17

litigation process itself.

18

Immunity prevents the
It's an immunity

The act of state doctrine is a discretionary

19

doctrine, first of all.

It's not automatic in the way

20

that immunity is; and, second of all, it applies only on

21

the merits; and, third, it serves different purposes

22

because it can be used even offensively and even in

23

cases where the state itself is not a party, simply to

24

establish the legality of a state's conduct within its

25

own territory.

So the act of state doctrine is a
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

judge-made prudential doctrine that serves different

2

purposes than immunity.

3

In your hypothetical, Justice Breyer,

4

immunity would apply to the acts of the -- of the

5

Department of the Army because, regardless of when suit

6

is brought, those acts are still those of the state.

7

the hypothetical where a state does not exist at all,

8

then 1604 would not come into play because there is no

9

foreign state to be held immune.

10

That's not this case, though.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can I come back --

12

And you said where -- where the immunity exists is at

17

604, which says a foreign state shall be immune, but

18

19

it includes an agency or instrumentality of a foreign

20

state.

21

In

And then it defines agency or

22

instrumentality in a way which, it seems to me, does not

Section 1603(a) does not

1

define a foreign state exhaustively.

2

what a foreign state includes.

3

you look at 1603(b), the very next subsection, Congress

4

said what “an agency or instrumentality” means.

5

It simply states

We know that because, if

So had it meant to define exhaustively what

6

“a foreign state” means, it could have said:

“A foreign

7

state” means its political subdivisions, agencies, or

8

instrumentalities.

9

foreign state includes a political subdivision and its

The fact that Congress said that a

10

agencies or instrumentalities suggests that it includes

11

more than just the enumerated entities.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I -- I would find it

13

extraordinary that it would go out of its way to say

14

that it includes the Department of Defense but would

15

leave up in the air whether it includes the Secretary of

16

Defense.

17

likely that you would understand a foreign state to

18

include the departments of -- of that state than that

19

you would assume a foreign state to include individuals

20

who happen to be officials of the state.

21

I mean, I -- I -- it seems to me much more

MR. DVORETZKY:

And the reason that I think

22

that Congress had to go out of its way to define what

23

constitutes an agency or instrumentality is that, at the

24

time that the FSIA was passed, there was uncertainty

25

about whether certain governmental or corporate entities
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

were included, maybe not the Department of Defense, but

2

whether certain commercial entities owned by the state

3

were entitled to the state's immunity.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

uncertainty about -- about individuals?

6

MR. DVORETZKY:

There was --

And there was no

Precisely.

There was no

7

uncertainty about whether individuals were included.

8

And so when Congress was simply continuing the common

9

law against which it passed this statute, it didn't need

10
11

to expressly say -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How can you maintain that

12

position when the Department of State takes the position

13

that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act applies to a

14

state and agencies and instrumentalities, but it doesn't

15

apply to officers?

16

didn't even have to put it in, then is -- the State

17

Department is being recalcitrant?

18

If it was all that certain that they

MR. DVORETZKY:

The State Department asked,

19

before the FSIA was passed, to have Executive discretion

20

take -- taken away with respect to immunity

21

determinations.

22

passed the FSIA, and now the Executive Branch has to be

23

held to that judgment that was made.

24
25

Congress agreed with that judgment and

JUSTICE ALITO:

As far --

It's something of a --

it's something of a mystery that the FSIA doesn't say
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

anything at all about this form of immunity; doesn't

2

codify it, doesn't abrogate it, doesn't preserve the

3

preexisting law.

4

Do you have an explanation for that?

MR. DVORETZKY:

I don't, other than the

5

explanation that I gave Justice Scalia, which is:

6

immunity was not in question at the time that the FSIA

7

was passed, and when Congress passes a statute in an

8

area where there had been preexisting common law, this

9

Court presumes that Congress meant to incorporate and

10

continue that common law and not abrogate it unless

11

Congress has spoken directly to the contrary.

12
13
14

JUSTICE ALITO:
drafted by the Executive?
MR. DVORETZKY:

This

But was this Act originally
Do you know?
I'm not sure whether it was

15

drafted by the Executive or whether it was drafted by

16

Congress, but it was passed at the request of the

17

Executive Branch because there was -- the State

18

Department was put in a position of being under

19

diplomatic pressure to grant immunity on -- on favored

20

status to certain nations who asked for it when they

21

wouldn't otherwise be entitled to it.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This --

Is there any case by us

23

in which we -- prior to the FSIA, where we recognize

24

that an individual was immunized in the way that the

25

state was, if he was acting as an agent of the state?
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Or were all of our cases having to do with other common

2

law doctrines?

3

MR. DVORETZKY:

This Court's cases generally

4

had to do with other doctrines.

5

exception to that is Underhill, in which the Second

6

Circuit's decision decided the issue on foreign

7

sovereign immunity grounds, and this Court affirmed.

8
9

The one possible

It's unclear entirely whether this Court's
affirmance was on act of state or immunity grounds, but

10

also at the time that that decision was -- came down,

11

act of state and immunity doctrines were very much

12

intertwined.

13

There is no question, however, as the

14

government argues, that the common law before the FSIA

15

recognized that officials were entitled to immunity --

16

to the state's immunity for their official acts.

17

Second Restatement, which was -- which was promulgated

18

in 1965 just before the FSIA, says that.

19

Circuit's decision from 1971, just before the FSIA was

20

passed, in Heaney, says that.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The

The Second

And it -Well, entitled to it, or --

22

or able to obtain a letter from the State Department

23

that would confer it upon them?

24

MR. DVORETZKY:

No, Your Honor --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean -- well, I mean,

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prior to the FSIA, you -- you had to get it from the

2

State Department, didn't you?

3

for that matter?

4

MR. DVORETZKY:

No.

Even the state,

The -- the -- prior to

5

the FSIA, this was a common law doctrine that courts

6

would often apply without any input from the State

7

Department.

8
9

In the Heaney case, for example, the State
Department was asked to provide input and provided none,

10

and the Second Circuit nonetheless held that, using the

11

generally applicable common law principles, that the

12

official was entitled to immunity for the state's acts.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And what -- what if the

14

State Department came in and said no, no sovereign

15

immunity here, what would the court do?

16

be bound by that?

17

MR. DVORETZKY:

Would the court

Ordinarily, the court would

18

at least defer to that.

19

definitively bound by -- by that or not, it would at

20

least be entitled to deference.

22

yes, but if they said no, that -- it pretty much

23

That's probably right.

And -- but the real issue that prompted the FSIA -24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you -- you don't

assert that to be -- to be the law now, do you?

3

has that been carried forward --

4

MR. DVORETZKY:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MR. DVORETZKY:

Has --

No --- under the FSIA?
No, because the whole

7

purpose of the FSIA -- again, at the Executive Branch's

8

request -- was to take the Executive out of that process

9

and to --

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, and then I -- I had

11

thought -- again, correct me if I am wrong -- that,

12

ultimately, in this case, whether or not within the

13

issues here present -- ultimately, you have two arguments.

14

One is that it's just implicit, inherent, necessary for

15

the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that agents be

16

covered; otherwise it won't work.

17

The other -- I take it you have a backup

18

position that even if that's wrong, that under generally

19

accepted principles of international law, that agents

20

still have immunity.

Or am I wrong about that?

21

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well --

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I had thought when I read

23

the House of Lords opinion in Jones and they talked

24

about the statute, that they took your position, this

25

first position, that the Act just won't work unless
25
Alderson Reporting Company

1

there’s an agent -- immunity for the agent.

2

it that even if we reject that position, you still have

3

a fallback position in the -- in the -- in further

4

proceedings on remand?

5

MR. DVORETZKY:

But I take

Our position is that the

6

FSIA incorporates the common law and that Mr. Samantar

7

is entitled to immunity under the statute.

8

disagree with us on that, we would certainly wish to

9

assert common law defenses on remand, but we believe

10
11
12

that the statute resolves the question.
If the Court has no further questions, I’d

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

17
18
19

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Justice Kennedy, the hobby horse that you

20

were talking about actually goes right -- right to the

21

heart of this case, and that is of the Torture Victim

22

Protection Act, in which Congress did create a cause of

23

action, was -- that cause of action was created for -- to

24

impose a liability, personal liability, for acts that

25

were done with "actual or apparent" -- but included with
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

“actual” -- authority of the foreign state.

2

Now, if Congress believed that the FSIA

3

immunized everyone who undertook acts under color of

4

law, or at a minimum with actual authority of the

5

foreign state, that was a very empty statute.

6

Now, part of the -- part of the --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. Millett, I think it's a

8

pretty empty statute as well to interpret the Foreign

9

Sovereign Immunities Act to immunize the Department of

10

Defense, but not the Secretary of Defense.

11

seems very strange.

12

MS. MILLETT:

I mean, that

It doesn't seem strange, for

13

precisely the reason that we have still with us today a

14

former minister of defense when we have no Ministry of

15

Defense and no Government of Somalia whatsoever.

16

reason is that individuals come and go.

17

engage in acts that are not acts of the state --

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

Individuals

But the state --

19

there is -- the distinction strikes me as artificial as

20

well.

21

only way a state can act is through people.

22

saying:

23

who do the acts for the state are not.

24

that can -- can work.

25

We’re talking about insulating state acts.

The

And you’re

Well, the state is insulated, but the people

MS. MILLETT:

I don't see how

The only question here is
27

Alderson Reporting Company

1

whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is the

2

source of that insulation.

3

difficulty with --

4

And the very

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, well, then --

5

but the whole point of the Act was to codify what was

6

there before, and -- and it seems odd to say, well,

7

they were codifying the immunity of the state, but not

8

the immunity of the only way a state can act, which is

9

through individuals.

10

MS. MILLETT:

Well, first of all, states do

11

corporate acts that are greater than the -- the whole is

12

much greater than the parts here.

13

case is whether the part can claim the immunity of the

14

whole, and that is a very different thing.

15

And the issue in this

The -- the individual -- individuals may

16

act.

17

contrary to authority.

18

which is the issue here, is there is no mechanism in it

19

for addressing, for example, whether this was

20

authorized.

21

They may act without authority; they may act
And the problem with the FSIA,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The -- the Ministry of

22

Defense is not the whole, either.

I mean, you -- you

23

acknowledge that -- that each individual piece of a

24

foreign sovereign acquires the immunity, but somehow

25

not -- not the principal officers of -- of the sovereign
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

entity.

2

I guess you could write it that way, but I don't know why

3

anybody would want to write it that way.

4

That seems to me very strange.

MS. MILLETT:

I mean, I guess --

Well, Justice Scalia, if

5

you're going to write a statute that addresses

6

individual immunities -- in particular, what this case

7

is about, personal immunity for personal liability,

8

then those statutes look very different.

9

What’s the first thing you are going to

10

want?

11

official capacity or what is on behalf of a state, and

12

you are going to want a mechanism for the foreign state,

13

or at least the State Department, to have input on that.

14

There’s nothing in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act

15

that addresses that.

You are going to want some way to decide what is

You're going to --

JUSTICE BREYER:

MS. MILLETT:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what is your --

-- want to identify -Right.

The question I

19

think, as I understand it, which is certainly why it’s

20

bothering me, is:

21

the set of cases where it's clear that the plaintiff is

suing an active state.

23

suing England or -- he’s suing an active state for an

24

official act.

individuals who did the act.

4

And all he does is he fills in

Now, does he suddenly fall outside the

5

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act just because he listed

6

the names of the people who did it, and everything else

7

was the same?

9

Yes, he does, because -Well, then, this Act does

nothing whatsoever.
MS. MILLETT:

That's not true, Justice Breyer.

MS. MILLETT:

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I cannot imagine any complaint that

25

MS. MILLETT:

Justice Breyer, there -- the
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question is whether Congress, in the FSIA, would have

2

thought that is a suit against the state.

3

Now, there may be many reasons that they

4

would have.

If they thought, in the Restatement’s

5

words -- which are not just if you are doing an official

6

act.

7

of jurisdiction would have the effect of enforcing a

8

rule of law against the state, then you get immunized.

If you are doing an official act, and the exercise

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

So wait --

10

MS. MILLETT:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

is only good as against a bad lawyer?

13

good lawyer would simply fill in the right names.

That --- you’re saying this Act

14

MS. MILLETT:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because any

I think -There is never a case where

this Act would give immunity if the plaintiff has a good

17

lawyer.

Is that what you’re saying?

question:

Sometimes the individual, in the first set of

Sometimes the individual does not count as the

state.

What are the principles that determine

levels here.

13

domestic law analogies here.

14

15

And they may not be

What is there to suggest that

20

Congress was looking to domestic analogies?

21

nothing -- immunity of officials under domestic law

22

doesn't bear very much resemblance to the immunities

23

that are available to foreign officials, does it?

24
25

MS. MILLETT:

This has

Well, this is a domestic

statute, and for Congress -- for purposes of Congress
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

deciding whether a lawsuit is a suit against a sovereign

2

or not against a sovereign, then that is obviously a

3

relevant framework.

4

And we know from two things -- the Torture

5

Victim Protection Act, that they looked at that framework,

6

but also embedded in the FSIA itself, in the Foreign

7

Sovereign Immunities Act itself, is that same

8

distinction between holding people personally liable and

9

holding the state liable.

10

In 1605A, the terrorist state exception, on

11

15a to 17a of the addendum to our brief, they create a

12

cause of action, one against the state and one against

13

the individual officials.

14

individual officials is a recognition that individual

15

officials can have personal capacity liability for

16

damages, consistent with the Foreign Sovereign

17

Immunities Act.

18

Petitioner's theory, every lawsuit against an

19

individual -- and the language there, is “acting under

20

color of office or employment” -- if every suit against

21

someone under color of office or employment morphs into

22

a suit against the state, there is no cause of action

23

to create against the individual.

Otherwise, if -- if, under

12

listen, these two officers were acting on behalf of --

13

of the government when they carried -- that's the Dichter

14

case and the -- and the case this Court had from the

15

Second Circuit last term.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I wonder -- I wonder

17

if the example you give or the point you make, that

18

there’s no functioning Somali Government, doesn't cut

19

the other way.

20

Let's assume you have somebody who was

21

acting in an official capacity, doing what his job

22

required, whether you like it or not, and then there’s

23

a change in the Somali government; and the United States

24

likes the new Somali government.

25

put out to -- to dry because he can't get anybody to say

That guy is kind of

what he maintains is true, which was I was acting

2

pursuant to official policy of the government.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -And the United

5

States is not going to give him the letter he needs

6

because they like the new Somali government.

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, under international law

8

the -- the official immunity exists for the benefit of

9

the state, not for the individual.

The state can waive

10

that immunity, and the state can determine whether, as

11

happened in the Philippines case, that the -- that the

12

actions being complained of were not -- were not within

13

the official activity.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I take it your answer

15

to Justice Scalia with reference to the indictment

16

against the Secretary of Defense, is that that's not

17

covered by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

18

a state interprets international law to allow the suit,

19

then it goes forward.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

And if

If -- if -- if one of

21

our officials was sued in a foreign court, then we would

22

expect the dynamic to play out as -- as I have

23

described, where the United States would take the

24

position, presumably that what was being done was within

25

the scope of official conduct after investigation and
56

assert immunity, and expect that to be respected.

2

only point is that --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that just goes back to

4

the Tate letter era, where we wait to get an e-mail

5

from the State Department to tell us what to do.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

My

And the -- this -I thought that was the

8

whole purpose of the Federal -- of Foreign Sovereign

9

Immunities Act.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

It -- it was the purpose with

11

respect to foreign sovereigns, but there were good

12

reasons why the court did that, precisely because

13

immunity questions -- as I've said, this case

14

illustrates, to -- to recognize an immunity or not

15

to recognize would -- might favor one faction or another

16

in the ongoing dispute in -- in Somalia.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Kneedler --

And so the -- what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

This is -- it's now

20

many years, and we still don't -- the State Department

21

has said in effect:

We decide.

Can you tell the Court, is this defendant

22

amenable to suit or is there an immunity that would

cover him?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. DVORETZKY:

13

I’d like to make three points:

14

all, when a suit is brought against a -- an official or

15

former official, the only question that a court will

16

need to answer under the FSIA is whether the acts

17

challenged are those of the state.

18

determination that courts can readily make and are

19

accustomed to making.

20

I’ll try to keep it short.
First of

That's a

By contrast --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Wouldn't that be the

21

same question that you would ask invoking a common law

22

protection like head of state or act of state?

23

-- whether it's under the FSIA or under a common law

24

theory -- the identical question?

25

MR. DVORETZKY:

Isn't it

It is the same inquiry that
59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you would have asked under the common law in inquiring

2

whether the state's immunity extends to its officials.

3

What the FSIA did was it codified that rule, and it took

4

away Executive Branch discretion to deviate from it.

5

you look at the Solicitor --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Isn't that the very

7

point?

8

under the common law, and we’re unsure what Congress

9

intended in the FSIA, because it certainly doesn't

If the inquiry is the same under the FSIA and

10

explicitly say it covers individual acts, shouldn't we

11

defer to the Executive's decisionmaking in what is --

12

has been, for centuries now, within its jurisdiction?

13

Why should we take that power away when the inquiry

14

would be the same under either doctrine?

15

If

MR. DVORETZKY:

First of all, as we argue in

16

our brief, this has not historically been a long-standing

17

power of the Executive in the way that the immunity

18

itself has been recognized under the common law.

19

what Congress did in 1976 was it codified the substance

20

of the common law but took away that procedure.

21

this case demonstrates exactly why it's necessary to

22

extend the FSIA to foreign officials in order to -- in

23

order to make the FSIA mean anything at all, and in

24

order to ensure the uniformity and predictability that

25

Congress intended through the statute.
60
Alderson Reporting Company

And

And

Official

1

If you look at the factors that the

2

Solicitor General proposes to take into account in this

3

case -- I’m looking at page 7 of the Solicitor

4

General's brief -- “Petitioner's residence in the United

5

States rather than Somalia, the nature of the acts

6

alleged,” the “invocation of a particular statutory right,”

7

the -- the state of the government in Somalia -- these

8

are factors that have no basis in the common law that

9

the FSIA codified.

No case has ever held that a foreign

10

official or former official loses immunity for official

11

acts on the basis of these sorts of factors.

12

Moreover --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why can't you say that if

14

the person, the individual you are suing, is a member of

15

the foreign state, is engaged in the kind of activity that

16

you’re complaining about, is subject to the orders of

17

the foreign state, and the relief would affect the

18

foreign state, you are suing the foreign state?
But where he was a member of the foreign

19
20

state, and you want money from him, even though what he

21

did in the past was an act of a foreign state, this

22

lawsuit is not affecting him in his capacity -- is not

23

affecting the foreign state.

24

25

second set, he doesn't.

Indeed, there isn't even

So in the first set, he falls in the FSIA.

In the

And you happen to have the

second set, and, therefore, he may still be immune for

2

what he did in the past, but that would be a different

3

docket.

4

MR. DVORETZKY:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6
7

All right.
That -- that's where this

is all leading me.
MR. DVORETZKY:

Because the Restatement --

8

what the Restatement, which summarized the common laws as

9

of the time of the FSIA's enactment, says that an

10

official is immune for his acts on behalf of a state if

11

exercising jurisdiction would enforce a rule of law

12

against the foreign state.

13

against a foreign state just as much by threatening to

14

bankrupt an official as soon as he leaves office --

You enforce a rule of law

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. DVORETZKY:

How does this case --

Official

1

MR. DVORETZKY:

Because enforcing a judgment

2

against a foreign official, threatening to bankrupt the

3

person as soon as he or she leaves office, has just as

4

much effect on the state itself as -- as enforcing a

5

judgment directly against the state.

6

officials to conform their conduct on behalf of --

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It will force

Never mind that this

8

person has long lived in the United States, in Virginia.

9

It will have no effect -- will have no effect whatever on

10

the government of Somalia?

11

MR. DVORETZKY:

But the -- the rule that the

12

government proposes, and the courts would presumably be

13

left to apply on their own in the many cases like this

14

one and the 9/11 litigation against the Saudis where the

15

government doesn't weigh in, that rule does not draw

16

those neat lines.

17

Why, for example, would we know that a prime

18

minister who comes to visit the United States has not

19

spent enough time here in order to have his official

20

immunity abrogated?
JUSTICE STEVENS:

21

22

quick question?

23

do not contend that your client was covered by

24

MR. DVORETZKY:

I respectfully disagree,

19

Your Honor, because 16 (b)(1) defines agencies or

instrumentality, is the means through which the state

acts.

4

I mean, we usually don't think of individuals

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And 1602 applies only to

foreign states.

5

MR. DVORETZKY:

1602 applies to states, and

6

our argument is that exercising jurisdiction over the

7

official in the circumstances like these would be

8

exercising jurisdiction over the state.

9

An entity, Your Honor, is not -- is not

10

automatically read to include a person, but it doesn't

preclude persons, either, as the Ninth Circuit held in
