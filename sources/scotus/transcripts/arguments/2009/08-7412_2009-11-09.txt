Mr. Gowdy.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN S. GOWDY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOWDY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Sentencing an adolescent to life without any

12

possibility of parole condemns him to die in prison and

13

rejects any hope that he will change for the better.

14

This sentence, like the death penalty, cruelly ignores

15

the inherent qualities of youth and the differences

16

between adolescents and adults.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

At -Are you urging that in

18

all cases, including homicide cases?

19

the line at homicide?

20

MR. GOWDY:

Or are you drawing

We are -- we are drawing the

21

line, Your Honor, at -- at non-homicide cases because we

22

recognize under the Eighth Amendment that we must look

23

at societal consensus, and society has said that murder

24

is different and has said that in the sentencing

25

practices, as demonstrated by the fact that outside of

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Florida judges and juries have imposed this sentence on

2

just 30 non-homicide offenders in just 6 States.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3
4

Thirty-eight States

allow this sentence, though, don't they?

5

MR. GOWDY:

Thirty --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thirty-eight, 39.

I

7

know you have a little dispute, but the vast majority of

8

States allow the imposition of this sentence.

9

MR. GOWDY:

The vast majority allow it and

10

they have for some time, and we believe that the fact

11

that it has been allowed for so long and imposed so

12

rarely, as the States themselves have admitted, is -- is

13

strong evidence of societal consensus.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You’re making a -I would have thought

16

that would be strong evidence that they appreciate the

17

gravity of the sentence in the particular circumstances

18

of juveniles and therefore only impose it rarely.

19

MR. GOWDY:

Your Honor, I would -- I would

20

disagree.

21

that have allowed it and have never imposed it, in -- in

22

our judgment, that -- that's evidence that it's very

23

unusual, and you couple that --

24
25

I would -- if -- if there's 30 -- 31 States

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No sentence can be -- can

be imposed rarely?

4
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. GOWDY:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

No, Your Honor, it has to –-

rarely, it becomes unconstitutional?

4

MR. GOWDY:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

When a sentence is imposed

No, Your Honor.
That's not your position?

What --

7

MR. GOWDY:

Our position is that you are

8

looking at two things.

9

because life without parole is unique, is particularly

One, is it cruel?

It's cruel

10

cruel to adolescents because it -- it gives up on the

11

adolescent and determines that he is forever unfit to

12

live in civil society.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It doesn't make it crueler

14

to him.

I don't see why it's any crueler to an

15

adolescent than it is to -- what -- where do you draw

16

the line?

At 21?

17

MR. GOWDY:

18

line that the Court drew in Roper.

19

because of the inherent -- the inherent qualities of

20

youth.

21

We draw the line at 18, the same

JUSTICE ALITO:

And it's cruel

And you are making a per se

22

argument, no?

You can imagine someone who is a month

23

short of his 18th birthday, and you are saying that, no

24

matter what this person does, commits the most horrible

25

series of non-homicide offenses that you can imagine, a

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whole series of brutal rapes, assaults that render

2

the -- the victim paraplegic but not dead, no matter

3

what, the person is sentenced shows no remorse

4

whatsoever, the worst case you can possibly imagine,

5

cannot -- that person must at some point be made

6

eligible for parole.

7

MR. GOWDY:

That's your argument?
Your Honor, that's -- that's

8

correct.

The life -- yes.

A life with parole sentence

9

would be constitutional, and that may mean that person

10

you describe still spends his entire life in prison, but

11

life with parole gives some hope to the adolescent who

12

has an inherent capacity to change.

13

hope that later in time he may be released.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

It gives him some

If we agree with you -And so if it’s -If we agree with you, at

17

what point must the parole consideration be given?

18

There is a suggestion in your brief that maybe the

19

Colorado statute, which says that a person can get

20

parole consideration after 40 years, would be

21

constitutional.

22

Is that your position?

MR. GOWDY:

Your Honor, our position is that

23

it should be left up to the States to decide.

We think

24

that the -- the Colorado provision would probably be

25

constitutional.

We will have to see what different

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

States do.

2

amount of time would give at least some hope to the

3

adolescent offender.

4

I mean, but -- but, yes, even that long

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about -- what

5

if it's the -- pursuant to the usual State parole

6

system, and it turns out that grants parole to 1 out of

7

20 applicants?

8
9

MR. GOWDY:

I think all that would have to

be required, Your Honor -- I think that would be

10

sufficient.

11

meaningful opportunity to the adolescent offender to

12

demonstrate that he has in fact changed, reformed, and

13

is now fit to live in society.

14

That's all we are asking for.

15
16
17

All that would have to be required is a

It -- that's all.

We are not asking that it be automatic right
to get back out.

If Terrance Graham or Joe Sullivan --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me that

18

your -- your argument suggests that you are, quite

19

rightly, focusing on the particular facts that have life

20

without parole.

21

to have a sentence of 50 years and then a consideration

22

where 1 out of 20 people are granted parole, I think it

23

suggests that the line you would draw is -- is pretty

24

artificial -- or certainly suggests that the next case

25

we will get is somebody with life with parole after

But if you concede that it's all right

7
Alderson Reporting Company

1

50 years.

2

MR. GOWDY:

Your Honor, first, I’m -- I’m

3

not conceding that with 50.

4

about 40.

5

The question was asked

But I understand -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Are you saying there

6

is something in the Eighth Amendment that draws a

7

distinction between 40 and 50 in that case?

8
9

MR. GOWDY:

Your Honor, I'm saying that this

sentence that we are here today before is unequivocally,

10

unmistakably a condemnation that you will never be

11

released from prison, and so this sentence clearly falls

12

on the line of being cruel because it tells an

13

adolescent, for an adolescent mistake, you can never

14

live in civil society.

15

There will be other sentences that people

16

will argue are the equivalent of this sentence, and --

17

and people may argue that with a 50-year sentence.

18

this sentence here is unequivocal, and there is no

19

question that it’s cruel because of -- of the fact that

20

it rejects any hope that the adolescent can be changed.

But

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it a fact that --

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I’m interested in -- in

23

two different things and you can address them during the

24

course of your argument.

25

argument seems to be that there are in place parole --

One is the assumption of the

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

throughout all the States -- parole systems which are

2

effective, which are operating, and that they have the

3

capacity to make accurate judgments about

4

rehabilitation.

5

do you have to -- that -- that comment on that?

6

What can I read -- what -- what studies

Secondly, unrelated, at some point I think

7

you ought to talk about the procedural bar, which is

8

something you go over very, very, very -- let's see --

9

that's Sullivan.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12
13
14
15

That’s the other case.
Pardon me.

That's

Sullivan, yes.
MR. GOWDY:

With leave, I will let

Mr. Stevenson answer about the procedural bar.
But on the first question, Your Honor, I

16

would point you to the amicus brief filed by the various

17

correctional officers that talk about the types of

18

programs that can be done.

19

very thorough and -- and would answer it far better than

20

I can in a couple minutes up here.

21

I think that that has -- is

But, yes, to answer short, we -- we believe

22

that -- that the parole systems in place can be

23

effective to do this, and in all seven States where

24

there are currently non-homicide juvenile offenders,

25

they all have functioning parole systems.

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Even Florida has it.

Even though it -- it

2

abolished parole in 1983, Florida still has 6,000

3

parole-eligible inmates and last year they heard over --

4

they made over 1,700 parole determinations.

5

the administrative burden to the State of adding these

6

–-

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

But Florida has abolished

8

parole, has it not, going forward?

9

MR. GOWDY:

10
11

So the --

Going forward, it has abolished

parole -JUSTICE ALITO:

So eventually, if things are

12

allowed to take their course, the Florida parole board

13

will go out of business.

14

MR. GOWDY:

And Florida could choose to make

15

that sentence and instead impose a sentence, as its

16

prosecutor recommended here, a 30-year determinant

17

sentence, if Florida doesn't want to reinstitute parole.

18

We are not saying it has to do parole.

19

of several constitutional options.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That’s just one

What -- what would you do

21

if there were a crime spree and there were different

22

jurisdictions?

23

the next jurisdiction for another 35 years, to be served

24

consecutively.

25

One jurisdiction imposes for 35 years,

MR. GOWDY:

Well, Your -- Your Honor, I -- I

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think that the -- that you would get into the question

2

about whether that sentence is the equivalent of life

3

without parole, and there could be an argument made that

4

if you -- obviously, if you sentence someone to 150,

5

200 years, there’s no conceivable hope of ever release,

6

150 years without parole.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the second jurisdiction

8

has the obligation, but not the first?

9

it works?

10

MR. GOWDY:

Is that the way

I would think that the -- if you

11

had that -- I would think that the -- that the judge

12

making that sentence would have to take that into

13

consideration, that this sentence is going to -- based

14

on all adolescent conduct -- it has to be all adolescent

15

conduct, not if some of the conduct is post-juvenile.

16

But, yes, I would think that the -- that the second

17

sentencing judge would need to take that into

18

consideration.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So he -- he could sentence

20

up to 1 year before the life expectancy of the -- of

21

the person in prison?
MR. GOWDY:

22
23

be okay, Your Honor.

I -- I wouldn't say that would

Well, what's he supposed to

7

I think --- consecutive?

I think there has to be some -There obviously does.

What

I propose, you know, 1 year before

MR. GOWDY:

Your -- Your Honor, I think that

8

would be coming so close to the -- the constitutional

9

line, it would be -- it would be difficult to see that

10

as constitutional, but -- but -JUSTICE SCALIA:

11
12

also unconstitutional?

13

MR. GOWDY:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. GOWDY:

Oh, 1 year before life is

Your Honor, I'm -Two years before life?

Your -- Your Honor, there would

16

definitely be a -- a difficult line to draw at that

17

case.

18

even that sentence that you are describing, there is

19

some difference between it and life without parole,

20

because only life without parole makes the unequivocal

21

assessment that the adolescent cannot be returned to

22

civil society.

23
24
25

Life without parole, though, is unequivocal.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
arguing for a categorical rule.
MR. GOWDY:

Yes.

12
Alderson Reporting Company

And

We have -- you are

Official

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your friend on the

2

other side is arguing for a categorical rule, always

3

permissible.

4

-- in an individual case, you assess the proportionality

5

of the sentence to the crime.

6

But we have a precedent that suggests in

Now, we know from Roper that death is

7

different, and we know from Roper that juveniles are

8

different.

9

consideration of the juvenile status into the

Wouldn't it make sense to incorporate the

10

proportionality review?

So that if you do have a case

11

where it's the 17-year-old who is 1 week shy of his

12

18th birthday and it is the most grievous crime

13

spree you can imagine, you can determine that in that

14

case life without parole may not be disproportionate.

15

But if it's -- and I know you would argue

16

that these are the facts here -- if it's a less grievous

17

crime and there is, for example, a younger defendant

18

involved, then in that case maybe it is

19

disproportionate.

20

Why -- why doesn't that seem more sensitive?

21

And it avoids all of the line-drawing problems we have

22

been discussing.

23

MR. GOWDY:

Well, two things:

First, Your

24

Honor, Roper states, and the science -- states it based

25

on the science, that at that age we cannot make a

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

determination about whether or not the adolescent will

2

or will not reform.

3

psychiatrist cannot do it.

4

Even an expert psychologist,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, I understand.

5

But I don't think they'll say that we can't make that

6

determination at 17 years 51 months, but we can make

7

that determination at 18 years 1 month.

8
9

MR. GOWDY:

Well, anywhere you draw the

line, Your Honor, you're going to come up with an

10

example where you are 1 day before or 1 day after, and

11

the Court in Roper struggled with where to draw the line

12

between maturity and immaturity, and it concluded,

13

rightly so, to draw the line at 18 based on both the

14

science and the legislative determinations.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

But that is because,

16

as they told us, death is different.

17

you decide that, you do have to draw a line somewhere.

18

I'm just wondering why we have to go all the way in with

19

you or all the way with your opponent when our precedent

20

allows us to consider an issue of this sort on a case­

21

by-case basis.
MR. GOWDY:

22

And you do -- once

I think it's because adolescents

23

are different.

Adolescents are different in that we

24

can't tell at this age whether they are going to reform

25

or not.

And all we are proposing is that an adolescent

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not necessarily be released, but that he be given a

2

later opportunity.

3

to adolescents are different, Your Honor, and the

4

determination can't be made at age 17 even for the most

5

heinous crimes that are committed.

6

And it boils -- it just comes down

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there any difference

7

in the terms of incarceration making this harsher than

8

otherwise?

9

that educational and vocational training is not given to

I think you suggested in -- in your brief

10

people who are in for life without parole because they

11

will never be out on the street so they don't need to be

12

transitioned back.

13

MR. GOWDY:

If I understand your question,

14

would it be different if those type of programs are made

15

available to life-without- --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

My question is, first,

you say that they are not available.

18

MR. GOWDY:

Yes.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

MR. GOWDY:

Is that -- that’s so?

Yes, that is generally true.

21

And the -- and the very website that the State of

22

Florida cites makes a point of saying that the programs

23

are for the purpose of reentry into society, and so

24

those are obviously the opposite of what life

25

without parole is.

You are never going to reenter

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

society.

2

are not available to offenders who get life without

3

parole, and that's what makes the sentence so

4

particularly cruel, to give up on a kid at that point in

5

his life.

6
7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
incarceration?

8
9

And it's generally true that those programs

So what are the terms of

They just stay in their cells and –-

MR. GOWDY:

Well, Your Honor, I think it

varies obviously by facility by facility.

But the

10

sentence means you are going to stay in your cell and

11

die there.

12

70 years, whenever you reach your natural death, and die

13

there.

14

You are going to stay in your cell for 60 or

You know, they -- they do have some limited

15

freedoms, as the State of Florida has pointed out, the

16

same types of freedoms that people on death row have.

17

But ultimately both sentences mean that you are going to

18

die in a State-controlled institution.

19

very hopeless --

20
21
22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And they are

I don't think -- the same

kind of freedom that people on death row have?
MR. GOWDY:

I --

Well, the State makes the point

23

in their brief, Your Honor, that you have the right to

24

exercise your religion, you have the -- you have the

25

right to petition the courts.

16
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Aren't they released into

2

the general population for exercise, for -- which I

3

don't think death row inmates are.

4

MR. GOWDY:

5

Your Honor, I -- obviously

everything varies facility by facility, but it’s --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I doubt whether this

7

varies.

I -- I don't know of any principle where if you

8

are in for life, you are in solitary.

9

MR. GOWDY:

Well, I’m not -- I’m not -- you

10

are correct.

I'm not suggesting they are in solitary

11

confinement.

But they are locked up for the rest of

12

their life, and they're not allowed to rejoin civil

13

society even if, as some of the former juvenile

14

offenders who filed a brief in this case, can

15

demonstrate that they have become model citizens.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

And why isn't the -- the

17

most sensible way to deal with the problem that you are

18

raising, the one that the Chief Justice suggested, to

19

permit as-applied proportionality challenges that take

20

into account the particular circumstances of the

21

juvenile in question, rather than this per se rule that

22

you are advocating, which would deprive the State of

23

Florida from reaching the judgment that there are some

24

-- there are some juveniles, some individuals who are

25

short of their 18th birthday, who cannot -- who deserve

17
Alderson Reporting Company

imprisonment in -- life imprisonment without parole?

2

Some of the actual cases that -- in which

3

this sentence has been imposed in Florida involve

4

factual situations that are so horrible that I couldn't

5

have imagined them if I hadn't actually seen them.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there is a problem

5

with that argument in this case, because the sentencing

judge made it quite plain that he was treating Graham as

7

a recidivist, not as a first-time offender.

8

Graham got a very light sentence, just 12 months in

that Graham admitted to a couple of -- to more armed

robberies.

MR. GOWDY:

He -- he admitted to the police,

that -- but even if Your Honor concedes that he was

20

convicted of all those crimes, which he was not

convicted of, but the judge, as you say, correctly

relied upon for this sentence, then we only have two

Look at

The judicial discretion

Is there a minimum?

MR. MAKAR:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The way in which -Is that an arbitrary line,

or how do you -- how do we know it shouldn't be higher

4

or lower than the line?

Well, the legislature has set

others.

9

on our books for the better part of 50, 60 years,

And then for indictment, where it goes to a
That has been

10

allowing indictment -- allowing the grand jury to make a

11

decision about whether the particular juvenile shall be

12

brought into the adult court.

13

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But then the -- what

14

is your objection to an approach that when you are

15

dealing with life without parole, for the reasons that

16

your brother has articulated, you must as a matter of

17

Federal law consider the juvenile status of the

18

defendant before that sentence is imposed?

19

MR. MAKAR:

Well --

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other words, not

21

a -- not a categorical rule that it automatically makes

22

a difference, but not a categorical rule that it can

23

never make a difference?

24
25

MR. MAKAR:

Well, sure.

And as I say,

there's the three factors I would ask the Court to look

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

at.

2

First, the structure that we have here in

3

Florida, which many States have, that deal with the age.

4

Age does matter.

5

offenders in our system do not go into adult court, and

6

an even smaller percentage of that ultimately get into

7

the adult sanctions.

8
9

Ninety-nine out of 100 juvenile

The trial judges in Florida, unless -unless it’s a very violent crime, have some discretion

10

to sentence as to age.

If you look at the transcript

11

struggled with this, struggled with age, and said:

13

Juvenile sanctions are inappropriate; youthful offenders

14

-- youthful offender sanctions are inappropriate; I'm

15

going to sentence you to -- to adult.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

Yes, but could I interrupt

17

with one question?

18

relevant on whether or not to transfer the person to the

19

adult system, but once he's in the adult system, age is

20

entirely immaterial?

21

Isn't it correct that the age is

MR. MAKAR:

That's not accurate, Justice

22

Stevens.

Under the statute 985.226, 227, and 225, we

23

have a system in which the grounds are set for when

24

juveniles can be either mandatorily or discretionarily

25

brought into the adult system.

30
Alderson Reporting Company

And then under the statute 985, the

2

punishment is graduated.

3

offenses, the juvenile sanctions must be considered and

4

the youthful offender sanctions must be considered.

5

It's only in certain limited instances, like indictment,

6

where it's a life offense, where the juvenile has been

7

indicted for life, that the trial judge is forced to do

8

adult sanctions.

of remedies the trial judge can impose is based upon

It matters

What we are saying is that if the Court

other things.

Didn't the parole supervisor say that

He did

It does suggest some hope for him.

MR. MAKAR:

Well, I think the prosecutor

12

certainly offered up to 30 years.

And the trial judge

13

who, as you can tell from the transcript, was familiar

14

that there were these home invasions going on around our

15

county, that there had been a task force established,

16

and so forth, the -- the trial judge was aware of that

believe he got a lower sentence.

MR. MAKAR:

The third one is in

For this very offense,

this home invasion, I didn't think that anyone other

MR. MAKAR:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

answer the argument that unlike an adult, because of the

immaturity, you can't really judge a person -- judge a

teenager at the point of sentencing?

after a period of time has gone by, and you see, has

this person overcome those youthful disabilities?

13

That's why a proportionality review on the spot doesn't

accommodate the -- what is the driving force of the --

your -- the Petitioner's argument is that you can't make

16

a judgment until years later to see how that person has

respect that, and certainly in Roper that was the

linchpin to the decision.

context that deals with these -- these terms of years,

22

and there -- there’s no constitutional right to parole.

be made, and States have said we are not going to have

should not give anybody life without parole.

should be evaluated, which was indeed the approach that

these decisions about who can drive, who gets the right

7

9

MR. MAKAR:

But they don't make it on

They say no juvenile can drink --

That's true but at the same --

by the same token, the juvenile justice system in

10

Florida -- and keep in mind we had a juvenile justice

11

division -- department established in 1994 because of

12

the severe problems as we outlined in our brief -- that

13

Florida has a -- has committed resources and -- and

14

programs and so forth to the juvenile justice system.

15

So given all of that, that what the Court -- I am sorry

16

-- what the State has done as -- as to age, that's why

17

we say that it matters.

18

What we are concerned about is that to

19

pursue the categorical rule that they seek, the Court

20

would have to, of course, abandon the various firewalls

21

that would stand between terms of years and also the

22

death penalty.

23

But, in addition, if the Court decides to go

24

down the proportionality route, my concern is the five

25

principles in the Harmelin concurrence about the States

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

having the ability to have diverse juvenile justice

2

programs and not have the -- sort of a lawnmower coming

through and making them all uniform.

5

in structuring these.

6

differences.

Some States are going to have the most

7

harsh laws.

The Eighth Amendment doesn't dictate any

8

particular penological theory.

9

-- it would turn the Eighth Amendment analysis on its

The Harmelin

And there’s going to be

There’s great -- and it

10

head to first allow this diversity among the States and

11

allow strong medicine for certain types of violent

12

crimes and then to kind of compare them and say, well,

13

gosh, Florida is unusual; it's different; and that

14

shouldn't be the case whatsoever.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we look just at

16

deterrence, my initial instinct is that the difference

17

in life and life without -- life with parole and life

18

without parole is just not a factor in deterrence.

19

I don't know how I'd confirm that one way or the other,

20

but let's -- let's assume that there is some basis for

21

that intuition.

22

I --

Then, insofar as the deterrence prong is

23

concerned, since it's not a deterrent, and if you assume

24

that there is rehabilitation, what is the State's

25

interest in keeping the accused, the –- the

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

defendant in custody for the rest of his life if he has

2

been rehabilitated and is no longer a real danger?

3

What's the State's interest?

4

MR. MAKAR:

Well --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And you could say

6

retribution, but then you have judges on a case-by-case

7

basis deciding when there should be retribution.

8
9

MR. MAKAR:

Well, I think certainly the

State of Florida's interest as among other States is

10

first of all to punish.

Certainly I think deterrence

11

plays a role.

12

less impact on some juveniles, but it doesn't have -- it

13

doesn't have zero impact.

We recognize that deterrence may have

It does have some impact --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

But it seems to me the

15

deterrence interest is quite minimal if you assume

16

rehabilitation or strong evidence of rehabilitation.

17

MR. MAKAR:

Well, but the deterrence goes to

18

those who would commit the same act.

19

deterring this particular individual, it goes to others

20

who --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Rather than

I thought the question

22

is:

Will the difference between life with parole and

MR. MAKAR:

it really matter or not.

6

the street people do talk about these things.

empiricism on whether the committed juvenile feels a lot

old than he would feel knowing that he was there for

12

life.

13

MR. MAKAR:

Well, I --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do we have empirical

15

studies about how much that improves the spirits of the

16

committed juvenile?

17

MR. MAKAR:

I -- I have seen none, and it --

18

it goes to the question here, which is that Graham will

19

be serving a lengthy prison term.

seeking is essentially the right to get out at some

21

point in the future and even saying that 40 years would

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And what he is

May I ask this question?

24

There are an awful lot of amicus briefs in this case,

25

and I haven't been able to read them all by any means.

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Do any of the briefs or any of the materials with which

2

you are familiar discuss the rate of -- the difference

3

between the danger of recidivism of a young offender and

4

one who is, say, 40 or 50 years old?

5
6

MR. MAKAR:

I -- I don't have that at my

grasp, but --

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it seems to me sort of

8

-- as a matter of intuition, Justice Kennedy made the

9

same sort of point.

It seems to me that the older

10

people are less likely to be recidivists than the

11

younger ones, but is -- is there any empirical evidence

12

that says that’s an incorrect or correct judgment?

13

MR. MAKAR:

Well, in terms of recidivism, I

14

think, number one, violence matters.

15

studies -- I can't quite put my finger on -- that

16

says that the violent offenders tend to recidivate more

17

than the non-violent.

18

Judge Posner has written a book called "Aging and Old

19

Age" that talks about -- in one of its chapters about

20

how age matters, and that crime rates go down as -- as

21

the population ages.

22

things out there that --

And that as one ages -- I think

So I mean there are those sorts of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

I think there are

Well, along those

24

lines -- and, again, maybe this was in the amicus

25

briefs.

Do you have a study about what age cohort is

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

responsible for most violent crime?

2

MR. MAKAR:

There are -- there are studies

3

everywhere, and I have looked at many of them, and it

4

appears that it certainly increases from age 13, and it

5

goes up to 14.

6

17, and 18.

7

depends upon what jurisdiction, and so forth.

8

tends to peak in the early 20s, the late teens or early

9

20s.

10

And it keeps going up until about 16,

It peaks.

It depends on the crime, and it
But it

So that's -- that's -- I think that's typical.
One thing I would point out that I haven't

11

had a chance to say:

The empirical question in this

12

case, I think, is very important because they are asking

13

that a constitutional rule be established on studies

14

that have just been generated literally over this summer

15

and have not been subject to meaningful review.

16

We have a concern with that.

17

the definitional questions that they have raised, you

18

know, about the offenses and what is life -- is life --

19

the studies tend to focus on life.

20

Well, in Florida we have some juveniles who are serving

21

prison terms that have 50-, 60-, 70-, 80-year sentences,

22

but they are not included within that study.

23

We think that

But what is life?

We also have in this case, for example,

24

Graham, he had a -- let's say that the judge decided to

25

give him 30 years for the main offense and 15 for the

49
Alderson Reporting Company

second and made them consecutive.

2

Graham's actuarial life --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's 45 years.

Well, we are not sure that

4

those 70-year sentences are any good, either, because

5

your -- your friend on the other side, you know, is not

6

willing to -- to pick a number at which the sentence

7

amounts to life without parole.

8

sentence does.

9

MR. MAKAR:

Maybe a 70-year

Well, they’ve conceded, in their

10

brief, that what this all boils down to is that if

11

Graham wins and he gets to go back and be resentenced,

12

that either the Florida legislature has to pass a law to

13

reinstitute parole for this category of offenders, or

14

the trial judge could say, okay, the actuarial table

15

says you are going to live to be 64.2, we're going to --

16

I'm going to sentence you to something less --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that there was

18

a parole system still functioning, so -- although it

19

will be phased out over time, but for people who

20

were incarcerated under the old regime -- and I think

21

the suggestion was that that system would take care of

22

the handful of people, not more than that, that this

23

decision would involve.

24
25

MR. MAKAR:

There is still a parole board.

Its functions have been minimized greatly.

50
Alderson Reporting Company

It has not

Official

3

sort to reinstitute that board and to take account of

4

these cases.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It would take a

Can you tell us just a

6

little bit about the Florida correctional systems, the

7

policies with respect to rehabilitation programs?

8

they don't have parole, then you might say, well, they

need them more.
Had the rehabilitation programs been

No, no.

They are in existence.

JUSTICE ALITO:

But do you know anybody who

is willing to say that, as a categorical matter, that --

3

you know, the 18th birthday is the magical date for

4

every single person?

5

MR. GOWDY:

No, Your Honor, and nobody was

6

willing to say that in Roper, but, yet, the Court still

7

drew the line at 18 for the death penalty in Roper.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Because the Court, up to

this point, has said that death is different, and the

10

rules -- the Eighth Amendment rules in capital cases are

11

entirely different from the Eighth Amendment rules in --

12

in all other cases.

13

MR. GOWDY:

We are not -- we were not --

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

If we -- you know, if we

15

abandon that, then one of two things has to happen,

16

either the rules for noncapital cases have to change

17

dramatically, or the rules for capital cases have to

18

change dramatically, unless death is different, in fact.

19

MR. GOWDY:

Well, I -- first, we -- we are

20

not asking that the procedural rules in the intricate

21

individualized death penalty sentencing scheme be

22

transported or moved over to the noncapital cases.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

I know you are not

24

asking for that, but that -- isn't that where this,

25

logically, is going?

If death is not different, then

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

there should be uniform rules across the board.
MR. GOWDY:

Absolutely not, Your Honor,

3

because those rules make no sense when you are talking

4

about adolescents, who are different, because those --

5

which a Court recognized in Roper, that those rules

6

can't be applied to adolescents because we -- you can't,

7

as a sentencer, predict the future.

8
9

And so, though death is different, it's not
different in any critical respects here because the

10

punishment, life without parole, just like death, says

11

that the offender is forever irredeemable, is forever

12

unfit to live in society, and must die in prison.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why does it say that?

Why

14

doesn't it just say that, in this particular case, what

15

this individual has done is so bad that, even if this

16

person can be rehabilitated and would not present a

17

danger to -- to society at age 60 or 70, that this

18

person is -- should be sentenced to life without parole?

19

That's -- that's what it means for an adult offender.

20

MR. GOWDY:

Your -- Your Honor, I think the

21

only difference here is -- between life without parole

22

and life with parole, is that there will be a

23

determination later, at age 30 or 40 or sometime

24

thereafter, as to whether that is the right sentence.

25

And the -- the parole official, just like

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the judge, can consider the offense as the offender, as

2

a juvenile.

3

complete determination at such a young age, and --

We're just saying that you can't make that

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

MR. GOWDY:

6
7

One reason States --

-- and you will have a more

accurate determination later.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One reason States

8

and the Federal government moved to abolish parole in --

9

in recent decades was, with depressing regularity,

10
11

prisoners released on parole committed crimes again.
And I'm just -- is there any empirical

12

evidence that tells us how often people, say, from 17 --

13

17-year-olds, when released, commit crimes again, as

14

opposed to 18- to 20-year-olds?

15

MR. GOWDY:

Your Honor, as my brother noted,

16

I think that the evidence shows that, as people get

17

older, they are less likely to recommit crimes.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But isn't that -- I

19

remember some of those studies that -- I mean, the

20

cutoff, there’s sort of a magic age at some point,

21

where people over the age of 35, or whatever, typically

22

don't engage in violent activity.

23

MR. GOWDY:

It -- it decreases over time,

24

undoubtedly, and that’s -- that supports, I think, our

25

argument here, that the -- that Terrance Graham, at age

55

47, will not be the person he was at age 17.

2

I see my time is up.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

The case is submitted.

(Whereupon, at 10:59 a.m., the case in the

Thank you, counsel.
