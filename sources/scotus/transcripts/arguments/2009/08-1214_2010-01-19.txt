Company v. the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.

Mr. Mathiason.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARRY G. MATHIASON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. MATHIASON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

This case involves two questions.

Taking

12

them in the order that the Ninth Circuit addressed

13

them, we look first at whether the complaint contained

14

sufficient facts to support a cause of action against

15

a non-signatory international union that engages in a

16

company-wide strike that violates the no-strike clause

17

of a contract between the local and the employer.

18

This is not a strike for higher wages,

19

better benefits; it's a strike for an amendment to the

20

contract that would provide immunity for the

21

international and other locals with regard to past

22

wrongdoing.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23
24
25

The -It's a tort action,

right?
MR. MATHIASON:

It is a tort action by being

4

It is

Specifically, what you would

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose --

5

6

contract is an evidentiary matter that you have to

7

establish, but the cause of action is still tort, and

8

of course 301(a) is limited to violations of

9

contracts.

10

I suppose the existence of a

MR. MATHIASON:

Your Honor, 301(a) provides

11

jurisdiction if there's a suit for a breach -- if

12

there's a suit for violation of a contract, and that

13

can be between a nonparty and a party, and then the

14

contract is between the union and the employer.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't see how

16

somebody who is not a party to the contract can

17

violate the contract.

18

sorts of things, but I don't see that they can be

19

liable for violating the contract.

interference with -- what is it, the ability to enter

12

into a contract, I think, is recognized in some

13

jurisdictions.

14
15
16

MR. MATHIASON:

That's -- that's cognizable.

That's certainly not here.
What we’re doing is looking at a very minor

17

adjustment in what would otherwise be a

18

straightforward contract action; and that is that you

19

have a situation where the international displaced the

20

local after the contract was entered into, took

21

control, and that control we manifested in several

22

specific points within our complaint.

23

-- it's effectively an agency relationship between the

24

-- at that point between the international and the

25

local, but it's an agency relationship to control them
5

And another way

to effect the breach.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, then you could have

sued on an agency claim, couldn't you?

4

MR. MATHIASON:

We did originally look at an

5

agency claim.

6

agency claim, at the time the contract was formed,

7

it's clear the local was not operating on behalf of

8

the international.

9

The problem with that is that under an

It was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but I mean -- if

10

you’re coming up and saying, well, we have a

11

principal-agent here, I could understand that, but

12

that's I didn't think the question we are here to

13

decide.

14

MR. MATHIASON:

15

whether there’s a cause of action.

16

The question to decide is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

On -- on the tortious

17

interference as to whether or not that's under 301.

18

Sure, agent-principal, I understand that.

19

that's a new argument so far as I'm concerned.

MR. MATHIASON:

of section 301 was to deal with midterm contract

So which theory are you -- are you arguing?

argument that they were -- they were the moving party,

Thereafter, what happened is you have the

14

for interference with contract relations is pre­

about that?

This Court has not said that.

In Allis-Chalmers, the Court

did address the pre-emption doctrine and indicated

that it would extend to torts.

Allis-Chalmers involved the

contract, right?

That's correct, Your Honor.

party.

MR. MATHIASON:

the strong position that it is pre-empted by 301.

the contractual issue?

you let the 301 case go forward?

15

What is the issue of

MR. MATHIASON:

The issue would be whether

16

the action of engaging in the strike violates the no­

strike clause of the collective bargaining agreement.

18
19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is there any dispute about

that?

20

MR. MATHIASON:

I think there is a dispute

21

about that. I think there’s a dispute about the

22

underlying existence of the contract, and then the --

the no-strike clause is complex.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So now the only question

that appears to be extant in my mind is whether or not

isn't that subject to arbitration by the very terms of

Justice Alito, that’s

15

exactly right.

16

mean, there is a crystal-clear understanding between

17

the parties that the time of ratification is the time

18

that the no-strike clause came into effect, and if

19

there was no ratification on July 2nd, we wouldn't

20

have signed the contract with the wage levels that are

21

described in December. When we signed it, we signed it

22

with the assumption that it was the contract that was

23

formed on July 2nd.

24
25

We agree with that.

It wasn't.

I

And the issue of formation was never given
to arbitration.

The arbitration clause in this

It's a much narrower clause than this Court has seen

12

the issue of ratification has been decided and by

13

whom.

14

MR. MATHIASON:

Justice Sotomayor, we take

15

the position, much like you've indicated in your

16

hypothetical or actual description, that the NLRB

23

says, I guess I am bound by it?

24

But there has to be a body,

Does that go to a

In other words, the contract is now final and

But there’s this interim step because we
don't yet have agreement from the other side that that

10

issue is moot and resolved.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If the contract had read,

12

not simply "claims arising under this contract," but

13

in addition said "including the formation or breach

14

thereof," if the -- if the arbitration clause had

15

included formation, then you would have no argument.

MR. MATHIASON:

unmistakable way.

agree with that -- the clause, if -- if the clause

24

included formation, then that issue would go to the

25

arbitrator.

The problem that we have here -- we

But the issue then becomes is there a

And that's a threshold issue, that you have

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought of another way of

5

putting this because I am having a hard time with it.

6

You and I could do this, couldn't we?

7

enter into a contract on May 1, and who knows what

8

happens, we disagree about what happened, and by the

9

way that had an arbitration clause in it.

We could try to

Now,

10

whether -- since we disagree about it, that would go

11

to the judge, whether we formed that contract with its

12

arbitration clause, because everything's up in the

13

air.

14

A year later, we enter into another

15

contract, and what that contract says is, we are going

16

to arbitrate every dispute between us, including that

17

old dispute about whether there was that old contract,

18

okay?

19

would certainly arbitrate the issue of contract

20

formation, even for the old one, because we said we

21

would do it, right?

And we could do that, and then you would -- you

22

MR. MATHIASON:

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. MATHIASON:

Your Honor, if that had

2

been, let's say, 4 years later, and we entered into a

3

new contract willingly and getting the exchange, the

4

no-strike clause for the arbitration, and that new

5

contract said, this is going to deal with all past

6

disputes, including prior contracts, fine.

7

When we executed that contract in December,

8

we executed the contract that we believed was formed

9

in July.

There is no meeting of the minds.

In other

10

words, the union's execution was on a contract they

11

say was formed on the 22nd.

12

There is a major, major issue here, and that

13

is on July 2nd we made the concessions on wages,

14

working conditions, and the rest of it, with the

15

explicit understanding that it would be ratified at

16

that time.

17

the joint appendix 377, has that qualification in it.

18

Stipulated fact number 16, I think it's in

If it wasn't ratified on July 2nd, then what

19

happened is it was withdrawn, it exploded, there was

20

nothing, there was nothing to be signed in December.

21

We only signed what was agreed to on July 2nd and

22

maintained that position because we believe we got the

23

benefit and the protection of a no-strike clause all

24

the way through that time period.

25

And so that is the critical distinction.
23

1

And now I couldn't agree more with this Court that

2

it's an academic exercise to go to either an

3

arbitrator or a court on whether it is in effect as of

4

July 2nd.

5

in that regard.

6

We believe the NLRB decision is preclusive

But there is underneath it, there has to be

7

a forum.

There has to be somebody to say that.

If an

8

arbitrator got the case, looked at it, said, well, I'm

9

not sure I really agree with the NLRB, and I think I'm

10

going to decide it differently, and that then went to

11

review in a court, and the arbitrator made a mistake

12

of law, a mistake of fact, it's not completely clear

13

to me that we would be able to come back to this Court

14

and get it effectively changed.

15

18

We are saying that the issue of formation
was submitted to the court, it was litigated.

But then the parties

The Court should ask itself that -- when the
union and its members are engaging in lawful,

10

protected, concerted activity, a strike, on July 1,

11

did they intend to convert that lawful economic

12

activity into a breach of contract?

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

And you say no, but what do

14

you say about the -- but you say that the arbitration

clause was intended to be retroactive.

16

MR. BONSALL:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Excuse me, Your Honor.
But you say that the

arbitration clause -- or do you? -- in the later -- in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that the

what -- wasn't the union's refusal to arbitrate what

12

precipitated this case?

13
14
15

MR. BONSALL:

Isn't that

That is not correct, Your

Honor.
On July 26th of 2004, the union was

16

confronting a Boys Markets injunction that was being

17

sought by the employer.

18

court was whether the union should be enjoined, its

19

strike should be enjoined.

20

took the clear position that there was not a contract

21

in place at that time on July 26th, but even if there

22

was, the injunction should not issue because of this

23

Court's decision in Buffalo Forge.

The issue before the trial

4

position that there was no contract, but the reason

why an injunction was not appropriate was because of

Buffalo Forge.

So on July 26th, the union did take the

There was no question

about arbitrating anything.

to have arbitration at all at the July 26th hearing.

13

The only question at that point in time was whether

14

there was ratification or not.

that the union's representative had made a

communication to the employer's representative that

the contract had been ratified.

have had the NLRB's -- the NLRB has weighed in and

2

said that there was a contract as of July 2nd, why

3

isn't that conclusive?

4

MR. BONSALL:

We think that there's still an

5

issue that is being sent to the arbitrator, the breach

6

of contract and damages, but as a precursor to that,

7

we contend that the issue never should have been

8

litigated at all by the trial court about whether

9

there was formation, because there was no question of

10

formation at that time.

11

contract ratification, and that issue falls within the

12

scope of the broad arbitration provision under the

13

collective bargaining agreement.

14

It was only a question of

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

you agree that there’s a contract in effect -32

not going to decide whether the contract is there or

not.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

And the contract has

a no-strike clause.

8

MR. BONSALL:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's correct, Your Honor.
So you expect the

10

arbitrator to say you get the benefit of the contract

operative on July 2nd?

MR. BONSALL:

We expect the arbitrator to

16

take a look at the facts that existed on July 2nd and

make a determination whether in fact at that point in

position depends upon your answer to Justice

MR. BONSALL:

Under Drake Bakeries, we do

We think

that when an employer brings a breach of contract

their remedy is to seek that breach of contract and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. NUSSBAUM
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS
MR. NUSSBAUM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
There are three basic points that I would

22

like to discuss with the Court this morning with

23

regard to the section 301 issue.

24
25

The first is that, in our view, the issue as
to whether or not a tort claim can be brought under
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

301 begins and ends with the clear language of section

2

301, which talks about suits for violation of

3

contract.

4

The second point I’d like to make is that

5

allowing the tort action, as Granite Rock is urging,

6

would work a big change in the structure that Congress

7

has established by which it has decided that major

8

issues of labor law, such as the weapons -- economic

9

weapons that parties can use, should be decided by

10

Congress through statute and by the National Labor

11

Relations Board through the application of the

12

statute.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you take the position

14

that the cause of action for interference with a

15

contract has been pre-empted insofar as State law is

16

concerned?

17

19

21

MR. NUSSBAUM:

That's, of course, not an

issue in this case because it was never attempted -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What is your position on

that point?
MR. NUSSBAUM:

The law in most of the

22

circuits is that any case which involves the

23

interpretation of a contract is pre-empted.

correct, that the Federal law has pre-empted State law

3

actions for interference with -- with contract

4

relations?

5

MR. NUSSBAUM:

Yes.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

So then you

7

are submitting to this Court that the purpose of the

8

National Relation -- Labor Relations Act and its

9

effect was to give immunity to unions for intentional

10

interference with contractual relations?

13
14

No, that is not what I

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

effect of your argument here?

15

MR. NUSSBAUM:

emption of State torts is not dependent on section

19

have been pre-empted prior, under Garmon or Machinists

20

would interfere with conduct that is arguably

22

prohibited or arguably protected, or that it is in an

23

area unregulated by Congress.

there's no action in State court because that's pre­

12

the local, not the -- not the international.

14

So

It is in your view, you -- you said, well,

16

there’s relief against the local, but there’s no

18

allegation is true that this strike would never have

19

occurred if it hadn't been for the pressure from the

20

international.

21

MR. NUSSBAUM:

No, I disagree.

There is an

22

avenue that Granite Rock could have pursued but did

23

not pursue, and that was to have filed a charge

bring a 301 action under -- a tort action under 301,

10

The question is whether 301 allows that type

11

of claim at all, whether Congress intended that, and I

12

think the language of the statute, violation of

14

bring an action against someone who --

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

A State claim, a State tort

4

I thought that did the basic pre-emptive

job.

And then where it is pre-empted by the LMRA, 301

6

creates an exception to the pre-emption, so that it

7

isn't pre-empted, if you have a suit.

thinking is probably out-of-date and wrong, so I would

MR. NUSSBAUM:

Now, my

I -- I think perhaps we are

saying the same thing --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, because I think

13

that your response to the Chief Justice's question,

14

which is why I became uncertain, is that it is the

15

LMRA -- not the LMRA at all that pre-empts tort

16

actions and State activities that interfere with labor

17

relations, as this might.

18

itself that pre-empts it, and then it is odd because

MR. NUSSBAUM:

It would have to be a proof

of damages that resulted from the unfair labor

10

practice, from the unfair conduct, which, in this

11

situation, would have been the interference into the

12

bargaining process.

13

what the damages would be, for the international as

14

opposed to the local union, I'm really not sure, but

there is certainly the capacity under the NLRA for

there to be a make-whole remedy.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you -- while saying that

MR. NUSSBAUM:

Why does

Congress did in 301 was to create limited jurisdiction

MR. NUSSBAUM:

the purpose that this is an issue that should be

claim that they brought in Federal court was not pre­

Aside from the remedies they have

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

the -- the facts of the particular case, that would

simply mean that it is protected conduct under the

4

that decision, and it is the agency that should be

5

doing it, rather than having courts get involved in

6

this area of law making up rules, because when you

for all interference; it's for improper interference.

of the international, you would create a no-man's zone

15

that would apply throughout this country, whereby

16

collective bargaining agreements entered into by

17

locals could be destroyed, violated, by an

18

international that would choose to impose itself on

19

the local and cause that to happen.

20

internationals are responsible.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Most

Do you seriously think

22

that if that becomes a problem, that the NLRB won't

23

declare it an unfair labor practice, or if they don't,

24

that they won't go to Congress and say:

25

no-man's land; now give a remedy like you did in 301?

There is a

You’re -- you’re begging Justice Breyer's

2

question, which is:

3

and it's doing so unjustly, who should make that

4

determination?

5

in a Federal court, or should it be in the first

6

instance the NLRB who says this is or isn't an unfair

7

labor practice, and if it rules it's not because the

8

law doesn't cover it, or it's not authorized to issue

9

this --

If the law pre-empts this claim

Should it be you in a State court, you

MR. MATHIASON:

Your -- Your Honor, I think

11

it's well-established this is not an unfair labor

12

practice, because you don't have jurisdiction under

13

section 8(b)(3).

14

What is suggested here is that maybe there

15

is a no-man's zone that Congress should go to and

16

regulate, but if you back up to 1947 and the passage

17

of section 301, it's inconceivable that in passing

18

that statute Congress intended to leave all

19

international unions, or anybody that controlled a

20

party, completely free from any reach of law.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

Why -- why isn't it under

22

8(b)(3)?

23

8(b)(3) that would exclude this from the labor board's

25

How does 8(b)(3) read?

MR. MATHIASON:

What is it in

Well, it is not an exclusive

a bargaining obligation on the part of an exclusive

3

representative, and the international is not in that

4

capacity.

5

In other words, 8(b)(3) contemplates

They had control, but they aren’t designated

6

in that manner, and there’s not one NLRB case in the

7

history of that agency that deviates from that, or we

And it just isn't

10

So we were looking at our options, and State

court appeared to be very clearly pre-empted by Allis-

Chalmers and a row of cases.

13

Federal law, section 301, as suggested by Lincoln

14

Mills, would absorb.

So that meant that the
