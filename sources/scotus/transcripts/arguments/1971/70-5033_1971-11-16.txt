MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

N G S
Wo will hear argumenta

in No* 37, United States against the Pullman Company and
Love against the Pullman Company.
Mr. MeClearn, you may proceed whenever you're
ready*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HUGH J, KcCLEARN, ESQ.,
'""'ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER, ' EARL A, LOVE
MR. MCCLEARN:

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case ia before this Court on writ of certiorari,
to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,
which affirmed, and then affirmed on rehearing the order of
the United States District Court for tho District of
Colorado, dismissing Mr. Love’s complaint against tho
Pullman Company, Judge Fahy dissenting from both Court of
Appeals judgments *
The issue before this Court involves the interpre­
tation of Section 706 of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act,

This section of the Statute deals with the mechanics

of lodging a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission,
More specifically, it deals with the mechanical
steps that one must take to lodge such a charge in a state
that has its own Fair Employment Practices Act, and Colorado

k»
does have such an Act# which makes discrimination in the
terms and conditions of employment on the basis of race
improper,
Mr. Love is a black man.

Hi a complaint in the

district court was that ho had bean discriminated against
in. the terms and conditions of his employment by the Pullman
Company because he was given a job classification of
"porter in charge” ‘where ho performed the same functions
as were performed by whits people that were called "conductor*
and yet he received substantially leas pay for doing so.
Ho alleges that the only basis for the differentiafcion was race, and that this constituted a violation of
Title VII.

His complaint is that this discrimination wao

perpetrated against him every day ho was employed by the
Pullman Company because of the continuing existence of the
discriminatory job classification and pay differential.
He first sought relief for this discriminatory
condition in 1963 by approaching the Colorado Civil Rights
Commission and, of course, at that time, there was no 1961}.
Civil Rights Act.

The recorda of that contact are lost*

However, he did what was required by the Colorado statute
to initiate a complaint.
Ha returned to the Colorado Civil Rights Commiasion
in 1965 and verbally reiterated his complaint.

The Colorado

Civil Rights Commission investigated his complaint in 1965

and they discussed the matter with the Pullman Company, but
the only relief that the Colorado Civil Righti:- Commission
offered Mr, Love was the opportunity to he reclassified as a
conductor.

But if ho wore to do that, he would lose all of

hie ^ob seniority and it would have actually have resulted in
Ms being laid off and being put out of work.
This relief was offered to him in a letter from
the Colorado Civil Rights Corn!asion that is dated July 30th,
1965 and to which he did not respond.

Instead, on Hay 19th,

1966, he wrote a letter directly to the Equal Employment
Opportunity commission, complaining about this discriminatory
classification and pay system, and that letter appears to
have been received by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Coxamission on Hay 23rd, 1966*
The Colorado civil Rights. Commission was advised
by. the, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that lb?. Love
had lodged a complaint with it.

The Colorado Civil Rights

Commission responded by writing a letter to the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission specifically saying that
they did not want to investigato Mr. Love’s complaint waiving
the sixty-day deferment period provided for in the statute and
Q,

When would that have started to run,

Mr. Me Gleam?
MR. MCCLEARS:
Q.

Excuse me, sir?

When would that sixty-day period have started

to run?
MR. KCOLEAHH:

The aaaah — th© sixty-day period

could have run from, I suppose, either the time when they •
received the complaint, or- the time xtien they were advised

of it, which would have been somewhere between May 23rd
and the fir-at of June, which is the date of the letter from
th© Colorado Civil Rights Commission to the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.

Q'

pid it establish or fir. any time limit for the

reference by th© Federal Commission to the State Commission?
MR* MCCJjEARH:

The statute provides that the

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can do nothing for
sixty days «Q.

That's what I’m trying to got at.

Sixty days

from what?
MR* MCCLEARH:

The term of th© statute is after

the filing of a — excuse me, the indication Is that the
EEOC can do nothing from the time when a

charge is initiated

with a state agency, and the last section of — or, the last
sentence in Section 706(h) indicates that all that need be
done, under the Federal statute, is to send a letter to the
state statute.
Q

Is that this, nShall be deemed to havo-hoen

commenced for th® purpose of this subsection

at th© time

such statement is sent by registered mail to th© appropriate

State or local authority”?
MR* MCCLEARHt

So it*a from that time — let’s so®,

ment la sent," I gather that moans* i-eliat* mailed by the -not when received —

It would indicate when it was scat*

MR* MCCLEARH:

Or by the individual complainant*

1 suppose *
•

Q,

•

••

Mr. Me Gleam* to enable me to get this into

focus, has there been any attempt by the petitioner to — oh,
scour© his rights through th© collective bargaining agent?
MR* MCCLEARN;

There was non© here, Justice

Bl&ckmun.
Q

Am I correct in my impression that there have,

however, been attempts of this kind by other petitioners in
this same predicament?
MR* MG CLEAR!! i

I’m not prepared to — in this case

or in related cases?
Q

Oh, generally*

The reason I ask is that I

have the distinct Impression — I haven’t checked it — that
we had litigation of this kind on the Court of Appeals on
which I sat before, brought by Just such petitioners against,
wall, the System Board, and Brotherhoods, and so forth.
MR. MCGLEARHi

Wall, in answer to that question, I

a
think: there has been, litigation, the Homan case from your
old circuit, and X think the. conclusion 'reached in those
end other cases has been that that is not an exclusive
remedy and that the Federal rights created by Title VII of
the 1964 Act can bo exercised regardless of whether or not
an attempt is made to seek redress under collective bargain­
ing agreements.
In answer to your specific question, here in this
case there la no record that Mr. Love mad© any formal attempt
under the collective bargaining agreement that he was working
unde?* as a portor.

But th© EEOC, after having boon told by

the Colorado Commission that the Colorado Commission, did not
want to proceed, went forward and put Mr. Love’s charge on an
official form which was sworn to on July 23rd, served that on
the Pullman. Company, which under regulations than and now in
effect, had th© right at that time to respond to the charge
of discrimination that had been lodged with EEOC.
During th® course of the next two years, the EEOC
investigated, found probable cans©, attempted to conciliate
and, being unable to do so- oca May 28th, 1968, Mr* Love
filed this litigation*
Six months thereafter, on December 3rd, 1968, the
Pullman Company moved to dismiss, and it is that motion to
dismiss which was granted.
Q,

How -«

VJhat was the relief sought?

9
MR* MCCLBARH:

The roll of sought in the complaint

in this case at that timo, and still, is for a declaratory
judgment terminating the differentiation and for bach pay on
behalf of Mr, love and all those similarly situated*
C)

There is a

I see.

I was wondering because

it appears from the brief that Mr. love voluntarily realigned
from his employment with the Pullman Company in November of

1968,
1€U MCC1BARN:
Q,

That is correct.

And 1 wondered if by any chance the issues in

this case have beoome moot because of that.
MR, MCCIEARN;

We don't believe that they are,

because of the class allegation as well as the back pay
relief which has been sought,
Now, the Tenth Circuit's judgment on rehearing,
quite properly in our judgment, determined that the complaints
that Mr» Love had made about events that occurred prior to
July 2nd, 1965* the effective date of this Act, were not
properly considered in this caste, and its judgment on
rehearing therefore is quite different, and on quit© different
grounds than its original judgment in this case or the
judgment of the district court in this case.
The Court of Appeals ruling on rehearing may bo
summarised as follows:

Because Colorado statutes prohibit

discrimination in employment, based on race, 706(b) says

3.0
that no charge may bo filed with the EEOC until sixty days
after a proceeding under the Colorado statute have been
initiated or such earlier time as such proceeding is terminated*
Mr* Lov© did not go to the Colorado agency in 1966«
Ho wont directly to th© Equal Employment Opportunity
Coasaissioa, as many others do.

The EEOC then roforrod his

complaint to the Colorado agency and was specifically
advised by it that Colorado wanted nothing further to do
with it*
When Mr. Love’s complaint was rejected by the
KEGG — ©sous© iae5 by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission,
the EEOC then commenced to process the charge which it already
physically had in its possession*
Q

In the form of that prior complaint.

MR* MCCLEARK:

The complaint which ho — the letter

which h© Bent to it on May 3.9th.

0,

Which they treated as a charge although it

had been filed with it before going to the Colorado body.
ME. MOCLEABNi

That’s correct.

The opinion on rehearing says that the EEOC cannot
consider th© letter of May 19th ao th© basis of a charge,
because It ms physically received by the EEOC prior to the
time when any approach had been made to th© Colorado Civil
Rights Commission.
Q,

Th© ~~

It just ends up, in affect, saying ’ho complaint

HR* MCCLEARS:

That’s correct*

There must he a complaint before th©

MR. MCCLEARNs
Q

That'» correct.

And that the complaint must be fey the

aggrieved employee.
MR. KCCLEAMs

Wall, the opinion can be read to the

effect that the referral of the complaint by the EEOC is not

proper.
Q

And that's tantamount to saying that the

aggrieved employee must first invoke the state remedies,
whatever the state commission is9 before he may ever go to
the Federal agency.
MR. MCCLEARMs
there's

That's right — that’s rights end

the indication is'that..he, physically® personally,

might do it.

Q

Yes.

MR. MCCEEARN:

The decision thus requires that

one administrative agency, the EEOC, which is receiving
complaints from the most unsophisticated of our citizens,
must ascertain at the time the charge is received by it,
either from the complainant or from a state administrativo

agency, whether or not a complaint has been lodged with that
stato agency.
Q,

And, I suppose, what it Is supposed to do

then II1 It finds there has not boon, and It has to return
the complaint to the employee and say, "Xcu havo to go to
the state agency before you con come to us •55
MR, MCCLEAR!s

That*® correct, and ho also le then

very proscribed time limits.

MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Hr. Wallace.

ORAL ARGUMENT OB’ LAWRENCE Gr* WALLACE, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF PETITIONERS UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
MB EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION
MR. WALLACES

Thank you, Hr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Courts
Title VII of the 1964 Act was a product of legisla­
tive compromise and accommodation in which Congress stressed
voluntary compliance by assigning the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission the role of attempting conciliation
that also conferred a right on the complainant to sue in a
Federal Court If the Commission’s efforts were unsuccessful,

3.6

and Ms was layered over by another legislative comproni;
to give state end local ©Bg>lograant commissions, where they
exist, an opportunity to attempt first to resolvo the complaint
locally while preserving, with reasonable promptness, the
complainant•s Federal remedies.

And one result of these

compromises is the uncommonly complex procedural provisions
of Section 706, set forth in our brief on pages 32 through
35, and the Act's intended beneficiaries, as has already
boon said, are lay working men and women, many of whom, are
unlettered and tmcomselod in attempting to pursue these
remedies»
Accordingly, the Equal Employment Opportunity
Conaiission and most Federal courts have from the outset
token the view that the procedural requirements of Section
706 should be applied so as to accomplish in substance the
various policies of the Federal statute, but not in a way
that imposes unnecessary obstacles to the ultimate determina­
tion of the merita of complaints made in. good faith»
The problem of this application has arisen in
various contexts, discussed in cm» brief,

Some of these

arose because the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
which, under its appropriation., has never been generously
staffed and still is not, quickly developed a sis©able backlog
of ease® which 1c still growing*
There have been imperfections and some incoasic tende

in the Commission* 3 application of those procedural
requirements, particularly in the early years.
boliery© its basio approach lias boon a sound on©*

But it&
Indeed,

the Act itself specifically authorises the Commission to
adopt procedural regulations* This is in Section 713(a),
which is sot forth on page .35 of our brief, ami the adoption
of auoh regulations is particularly appropriate with respect
to the procedural matter involved hero, the receipt of a
complaint initially by the EEOC when there is a state agency
to whom it must first be referred, because the Act, despite
the detail of procedural complexity, does not specif to tho
question of what the EEOC should do when it receives the
complaint initially in such a situation.
And eo, bearing in mind all of tho policies of tho
Act, ©specially the overall policy of preserving a Federal
remedy on the merita, ultimately, in Federal Court, tho EEOC
has adopted this policy of referring such complaints to the
appropriate state agency under regulations duly adopted.
The regulation that was In effect at the time of
this complaint was a generally-worded regulation set forth
on page $8 of our brief* The regulation has since been
refined end elaborated, and the new regulation begins on
page 36 of our brief #

1 think it* s worthwhile to look for

just a moment on page 36 at subsection (a) of that regulation
in which tho Commission recites some of the reasoning behind

the regulation, particularly in the last two ©«atones a
that subsection.

Cj

The Caasstiesioa stated:

"It Is the experience of the Commission that
the complexities

of

because

of

the prescab procedures, persons who

seek the aid of. the Consaissioa are often confused tad
even risk loss of protection of the Act.

Accordingly,

it is the intent of the Commission to simplify filing
procedures for parties in deferral. States end localities
and thereby avoid the accidental forfeiture of important
Federal rights.i{
But in the previous part of the paragraph, the
Ccsaedeeion also recites that its purpose is to encourage the
maximum degree of effectiveness In Stato and local agencies,
also in. accordance with the Congressional intent under

Section 706.
low, we believe that this practice

which the

Commission has developed Is a valid procedure under the Act
and under the Commission’s regulations, both those existing
at the time, and the present regulations*
The Court of Appeals — the majority of the Court
of Appeals believed, in it© words, ’’That the Cmsaission
could not nenlpulate the filing dates in this fashion.”

This

meant that there ware two possible defects, as the majority
of the Court of Appeals saw it.

One would be that, rather than have the

Mr. Love should have bean told to file a complaint himself
with tho Colorado agency, when the Corneal salon received the
complaint.
Wo hardly as© that this would make a substantial
differ®»©© in tho case.

Tho Colorado agency quickly indicated

that it was waiving its jurisdiction, having previously
failed to satisfy Mr. Love.
Th© other possible defect, under the majority
opinion of th© Court of Appeals, was that after the
Commission received word from the Colorado agency that it
was waiving its jurisdiction, it should have asked Mr. Love
to file another formal complaint within thirty day a, eve.»,
though ho had just «Q

Commission that it wa© waiving its Jurisdiction, so that
it hardly seams a very serious question whether Mr. Lovo

Act, including ~~

on his case, may go into Federal Court?

JIB* WALLACE:

That's right.

And wo also specify

in our brief that, even if the EEOC procedure is not valid,
we still believe that under the policy of the Federal Act
EEOC's mistake should not bar a relief for the employee, as
we have elaborated, both in this brief and in the brief w©

MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Eppich*

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD C. EPPICH, FSO,..
m BEHALF OF THE POLLMAH OOMPAHY, RESPOIDMT
MR* EPPIOHs

Mr. Chief Justice, and maj it please

the court;
X think it1 a important, to begin with, to straighten
out the sequence of filing requirements of Section 706 and
the time requirements of Section 706«
The Act is quit© clear, for it statos that no
charge may ho filed with EEOC until the state proceeding has
commenced.

That's what the Act says, and there is, just in

sjy humble opinion, no room for construction otherwise.
In this particular case, Hr. Lor© at no time filed
a written charge with the Colorado Stato Commission, nor at
any time was a written charge filed on Mr. Love's behalf*
initially, and in the trial court, wo, because the
state did listen to Mr* Love's oral claim, and because the
state did take some affirmative action, and diet terminate
the proceedings, the trial court decided yes, ho had complied
with commoncing state proceedings as required by the Act, but
we must then look at the timeliness requirements of Section
706(d) which state in equally unequivocal terns that the man.
must then file with EEOC within thirty days after the state
has terminated proceedings, ox» within two hundred ten days
after the alleged unlawful employment practice has occurred,
whichever is earlier.

It's Just that simple, just that clear.

Jja that posture, it went up to the Tenth Circuit,
and the Tenth Circuit affirmed

on the timeliness issue.

At

that point, however*, the Equal Employment Opportunities
Commission interjected into the case their deferral regulation
which la set forth in their brief and also in our brief» and
tried to justify their procedures utilised in this oa.se
based upon a 1968 regulation which, of course, wasn‘t in force
at tho tine that this particular matter transpired*
9

It was at that point that Judge Saa© made the
comments about the deferral regulations.
Then, on rehearing, it was pointed out to the
court that Titio VII of the Civil Rights Act did not become
effectivo until July 2, 196.9.

Accordingly, the matters

before the state in 1965 had to antedate the jurisdiction of
the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission and, hence, they
could not bo the basis on determining the timeliness and
hence the basis for the- decision.
It was at this point that wo got into the ’taii~
pulated filing dates,” and the “manipulated procedures,"
because this record is very clear, and the -trial court so
found, that there is one filing data in this case, and that
is May 23, 1966.

It was not until the Appellant arguments

that the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission decided
to say, "Well, we'll use another filing date,”
Tenth Circuit did not think was proper.

Granted, there is no question that racial discrimina»

not an actionable wrong, at least not in the Federal courts*
Congress created a statutory right, and within
that gtatu&tory right, Congress imposed certain limitations
and certain guidelines, and certain things that had to be
done.

And gentlemen, a reading of this Act, I imploro upon

you, can lead but to two conclusions.

One is thou

shalt go

to the state first, and thou shalt thereafter go to the
Equal Employment Opportunities Commission within the times
therein prescribed*

And failure to do that, sir, has been

held each time, by each circuit court, to bo a jurisdictional

deficiency*

At this time has the Pullman Company gotten

around to it yet?
MR. EPPICE:

The Pullman Company, sir» no longer

has any porters or porters-in-charge* as the operations have
been turned over to the government.
Q

Maybe that’s on© way to solve it.

MR. EPPXCH:
don©, but -- aaah —

Well» air, I don’t know why it waa
as far as I

It sounds like a very

technical situation, but it’s not, gentlemen.

Congress in

the legislative history, albeit It la murky in some areas»
la quite clear in on© area, and that is that the states will
have the initial opportunity to take care of these matters
and resolve them at the local level.

I don’t think there

can be any question about that.
Q,

Are you telling us that it’s crystal clear, on

the face of the statutes, that what Congress said was,
"Employee, you go to the state agency if there is on©,

you

within a certain time, or after a certain lapse of time*
Then you start all over again before the Federal G caste a si on.

How, with one

Ae I understood Mr?* Justice B?exman, the question

was that, regardless of what the state did, you still could
not go back to the Equal Opportunity Commission.
Q.

Ho, X didn’t moan to put it that way.

MR. EPPICH:
Q

All right.

That is not the case.

The way 1 moant to put it was, if you had to

wait a certain length of time, I gather sixty days, after
you go to the state agency.
ME, EPPICH!

It can be either sixty days, or thirty

days after the state has terminated its proceedings.
Q

Well, in any event, whatever may be the time

MR, EPPIGHi

All right,

She statute says thl

and I refer the Court to Section 706(b), -where it says,
charge may be .filed*” It ’ s Just that simple,

a

"No charge

may be filed” with the Equal Employment Opportunities
Comrainslon until the state proceeding has been commenced*
All right*

Then it provides that «- for a cirby

day
Q.

That is commenced by the employee?

MR. EPFXCHi
question, sir*
this to you..:

Aa&h —■* this is an Interesting

If it’s not entirely clear, I would suggest
when the Bill initially corns out of the H0use

and tc the Senate, it contained the language, the. express
language that the charge could be filed by or on behalf of
the person aggrieved* Now, the Sonata, in the Links on»*
Mansfield Amendment to it, which eventually became the law,
removed those words "on the Individual’s behalf," and Just
left in the words "filed by the individual.”
Now, I’m not going to sit here and toll this Court
that a lawyer couldn’t file a charge with the Equal 3&npXoy*aent
Opportunity Commission or with the state.

But, nevertheless,

the Act does state that you will go to the state first.

And

then, there ere vary specific -«

I do not say that3 sir,

0h, you do not.

MR. EPPICH:

Ho, sir,

I say that the Federal body

cannot accept the charge for filing unless the man has boon

Sure, if he's novor filed with, tho

state, Ms** Justice White —
Q

Ho, but I mean he? s never filed a proper

charge with the Federal authority because he filed it before
ho went to the state# actually.
ME* EPPICH:

That is correct.

However, I do not

believe that he has to file an identical charge.

1 think

that all that is required is that some direction be given
by him to revive that charge.

In other words,

“Refer to my

complaint# and lot's got on it.”
Q

How, Mr* Eppich, in this case, when he came

bach from the state, well, fee didn’t com© back from tho state
MR, EPPICH:

But I think, Your Honor —

He didn’t come back from tho state, but tho

Federal people revived the old charge, 1 take it .

Is that

right?

It’s not in the record that they did,

And you say that

would be -wrong, under the plain words of the statute?-

m,
Q

EPPICHJ

Yes, sir.

How, in the alternative, however, if they

had eat down and thought about it, they wouldn't need to
have moved on the old charge at all*

A member of the'

Commission could have filed the charge,
MR* EPPICHJ
Q

Yes, air,

At that point, without hearing a word from,

tho employe©,
ME* EPPIOHi

No, sir*

Well, do you think if a member of the

Q

Well, when they referred it to the state,

though, when they did refer if; to the state, the stato carae
back and said, !1¥© don't wmt anything to do with It." How,
was the state proceeding terminated?
MR. EPPICHs

Aaah, in that regard, let's find out

how they referred it to the state.

The only evidence in the

record is a "shop«t&Ik typo of discussion" between a
representative of the Equal Bsiploymsiii Opportunity Commission
and the Director of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission*
Q,

Well, now, let's assume there had been an

exchange of formal letters.

It Colorado says,

ho

Wa refer to you a claim, and

don't want anything to do with it,

would that have been an adequate going to the state?
MR. EPPICKi

I think it would ho a much more

difficult case from my standpoint, sip, for the very simple
reason that both the state and the Federal Act require the
filing of «. written complaint to start a state proceeding,
and X don’t believe that this is a meaningless procedural
requirement .

I do not

know of any proceeding to be commenced

without something in writing, end this is a simplo condition*
Q,

Well, if I get your position, even if, what­

ever it is that it takes to get the thing to the state had
been complied with, after the stato finished with it, never­
theless, EEOC cannot move on it until the employe© then
/

brings something within thirty days after the state * s
finished, back to the EEOC.
MR# EPPIGH:

*

Is that right?

Well, that’s what their interpretation

at the time said, yes, sir.
Q.

What’s your position?

MR. EPPICH:

I don’t think we got to that point

here, because it was never before the stats, sir.

Now, in

answer ***■»
Q,

You mean, there’s never been a state ««» after

the enactment of the Civil Rights Act -- there’s nover been
a state proceedings?

MR, EPPICH:

There's never boon a written charge

filed with the State of Colorado, no, sir»
Gj,

EPPICH:

By anybody.

Hhat was it they responded to, then, when they

‘Vo want no part of it.”
KR. EPPICH:

Apparently the "shop-talk typo

discussion5* went over all policies of the EEOC and the
Colorado Commission during discussion*
Q.

You mean nothing ever has boor, referred to

’the state in writing?
ME* EPPICH:
Q

That is correct, sir.

And it's because there’s boon a failure to

submit anything to the state agency in writing» the state
has never, for purposes of the statute, had anything to
act

on?
MR. EPPICH:

tho

state ,

Precisely, and having not satisfied

the requirement that th oy first go to the stato >

the EEOC has nover gotten to it.
Hell, let's assume, that this oral advise method
is proper, is a proper referral and, realising that matters
such as notice, and matters such as preserving a record, and
matters such as some sort of an orderly proceeding which
generally follow the filing of a written complaint, we then
get back to the situation that, well — it's referral

33
procedure that the EBOC is trying to establish here, la it
proper?

I don't think it is.

If it's only, if it*a only

to misdirect these misguided complaints, that’s one thing.
And if it is designed to get the complaint and to got the

mm before tho state so that the state can take soma meaning­
ful! action, then I have no quarrel with it.
proper»

1 think that's

I think that's In keeping with the statuto* and I

think that’s in keeping with the Congressional intent, that
the state he.vo first whack*
But the regulation that the EEOC is asking this
Court to uphold does more than that»

VJhat in effect it does,

is says this, that when those charges come in «** and let's
bear in mind wo're talking about filing dates, because we* re
talking about limitations period — when the EEOC says they'll
date and time stack them, that they'll send a copy of it to
the state*

And then, without further word • or act from the

complaining party, unless we've heard to the contrary, wo
will, on our own hook, undertake and resolve this matter for
you*

Gentlemen, I submit that that does nothing but pay

lipaervico to the requirement that the states have tho first
opportunity to do this thing because what happens?
The charges go into the Federal government first,
or the Federal agency first and, for all practical purposes,
the mechanics of the statute are complied with* but the states
don't get a meaningful whack at it*

They certainly don't if

it5 o an oral refer©nee, and that * s what they’re asking this
Court to do3 to affim an oral reference, and, secondly, to

eagr that you can have a proceeding without a written complaint
I just can’t see that that regulation accomplishes
the Congressional purpose.
Q.

Hypothetically, if this Court refers to the

Tenth Circuit, what would, next happen?

I would like to see

how this would unfold in a normal case.
MR. EPPICHt

¥©11, sir, first off, .1 think they’d

probably got in the national Railway Arbitration Act because,
of course they •»» a&fih «** labor agreements with both the
Porters Union and the Conductor© Union are, as I understand it
entered into under the auspices of the national Railway
Arbitration Act*
Whether or not he has an arbitration «— aaah — if
you reversed, whether or not we would raise that as the
defense when —• I don’t know — probably not*
Q
the Adjustment

What?

The

National Arbitration?

You mean

Board?

MR* BPPIOHs

The National Railway Labor Act, X’m

advised by the Pullman Company, is under the auspices of
whom those labor agreements are entered into, sir,
Q
talking about*

Yes, I know.

I just wondered what you were

X never heard of a Rational Railway

Arbitration Board*

MR. EPPICH*
this situation.

So you got the Pullman Company in.

They eaten into an agreement under the

auspices of one Federal Act,

This is their labor agreement.

They are paying conductors X. • They are paying porters Y.
Then another piece of Federal legislation comes
along and says that — at least Mr, levs says that this is
discriminatory against him,

How, where this fits, gentlemen,

X frankly don’t know, and X haven’t studied it out, but X
do believe that it’s going to be a problem, and X do believe
that eventually

it’ll bs raised.

And then, just simply

the jurisdictional matters are disposed of contrary to

the

Pullman Company’s position, bo it’s trial on merits.

Q,

Trial where?

MR. EPPICHs
Q,

Ho, air.

Subsequent to the adoption of Titio VII.

MR. EPPICHs

Yes, sir.

To say that it is a proper

that a written complaint be filed, because at best this was
an oral oomnami c ati on * the exact nature of which ' :o do not
know.

And this I say you cannot do.
Q

But wasn’t it none than an oral communication?

MR. EPPICHs
Q

Ho, sir.

Hot to the state.

Well, Mr. Loire, however* wrote to the EEOC?

MR* EPPICHS
Q,

Yes, sir.

And did not the EEOC refer that writing to

the Colorado Commission?
ME, EPPICHs
Q,

Ho, sir, at no time.

What did it do, just telephone?

MR. EPPICHS

Apparently, it cam© up when a

representative of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
was in Denver, talking with Mr. Reynolds about overall
policies*

'M

other words, what are we going to do with —

how are w© going to set this thing up to make it work?

And

Mr. Lovo cm© up as kind of an aside, a collateral matter.
This is what they are urging upon this Court# to have the
dignity of commencing a state proceeding in courts with the
Federal legislation, when the Federal Act itself specifically

states that you will file a written complaint *

I’m aware

of no proceeding that can be started in this manner.
Q.

Of course* - the Colorado Commission know what

it ifas all about.

They’d had it before.

MR. EPPICHi

This is questionable, sir, whether

they did* in fact, know what it was all about, and this
gets us back to this problem with the labor-management
agreements.

The

at least according to Me. Love’s letter

to ‘the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, he just
flat says, "The Colorado Commission doesn’t under strand-my
complaint,"

So let’s take

Mr. Love’s word.

I think there

is even more to it then that.
Hr. Reynolds testified in his deposition that when
the matter was initially before thorn in 1965, the Colorado
Commission was not recognising discrimination through labor
agreements as such.
natory practice.

In other words, this was not a discrimi­

However, he testified in 1966 that the

Colorado Commission’s views on this had changed, and that
they were now recognising that a man could be discriminated
against through this particular collective bargaining agree­
ment.

So that I cannot tell this Court, nor would the Tenth

Circuit say, end as a matter of fact, they specifically said
that a referral in 1966, they would not say would have been
totally futile, and based upon this record, they couldn’t.
I suggest to this Court that it may wall have been

that, had Ms?, hove, or someone on behalf of him, submitted
this written charge to the Colorado Commission, the Colorado
Commission would have considered it, and considered in view
of their enlightened views on discrimination.
This discrimination Is a changing thing.
we all recognise that.

Colorado is no different,

I think
What they

recognised in 1966 as being discriminatory, they didn’t
recognise in 1965s and what they recognised in. 1965» they
didn’t recognize in I960, and so on down the lino,
Q,

This began back in 1963, as X understand it.

HR, EPPICHi
Q,

That is correct, sir, job*

That ho went to the state Commission.

MR. EPFICH:

Yea, air, and at that time, although

the record is not entirely clear, apparently a finding of
no discrimination was made.

But here again, Mr* Love, you

so©, is tied in through hia Union to those management agree­
ment a,
Q

And then he cane back to them in 1965*

MR, EPPICH:

Came back to 1965 ~~ at which point

they could make him a conductor but, because of the seniority
rules in force, and the fact that trains just «** well, let’s
faoe it, passenger service has had it.

There just wasn’t

Mi. EPPICH:

Ho just wanted their* pay level»

Sure.

Isn't that it?

Yes, sir.

That’s as X

But he just didn't comply with the Act.

/nd I think we also have to bear in mind one other
thing.

Ho was advised, at least, jud^ng from Mr* Reynolds1

so-called SIwaivern letter of June, 1966, he was advised to
return to the Colorado Commission and file a written complaint.
We don’t have a situation here of a man being totally misled
or led down the garden path.
do it.

He chose not to.

Ho was told by the director to

That is certainly his decision.

But I believe that Congress gave him a right that he didn’t
have previously, end I think it is up to that men to comply
with what Congress says he will do to obtain the remedies
wider that Act*
How, there’s one other danger here, gentlemen,, I
think, that should be called to your attention, and it’s
getting

back again to this "manipulated filing date."

A

filing date, to me, can. have but one time, and that is, when
it is received, it Is filed.

The EEOC would. s®em to say,

"Well, wo can file them at this time when we receive them, or
wo car. sit on them and wait on them for awhile, and then fit
it into the scheme of tilings so that nobody is out of court *"

k.Q

I suggest that this practice, that they do not
£11© things whoa thoy receive it, could veil deprive a man
of hie day in court, and man

who has complied with the Act#

Let*a boas» in mind that he must go to the state
first ami thereafter, he has only thirty days within which
to file with the EEOC#
Let’s assume that the man has gone to the state*
Let’s assuas on the twenty-ninth day, ho sends his charge in
to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and, Instead
of filing it, they refer it back to the state*

Gent 1 omen,

the man la out of court, and yet he’s done everything that
the law requires of him, because the EEOC didn’t file it*
There can only be one filing date and ho shouldn’t giro them
the opportunity to manipulate these things because a man
who has don© what he was supposed to do is liable not to be
in court#

Thank you, Ms»* Eppich,

Mr* Wallace, you hay© four minutes for rebuttal*
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP LAWRENCE G, WALLACE, E&<L*,
OK BEHALF OF PETITIONERS UNITED STATES OP AMERICA
MD EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION
Mi* WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

would like to respond to two points that hay® arisen in the
questioning.

First, this record does not show the manner

in which the referral was made by EEOC to the Colorado

Commission in 1966.

Tills referral was mad© during the first

year of the administration of Titio VII and the procedures
at that time were not as regularised as they are now*

But

what the record dooa show# on page 8 of the Appendix, la tho
Colorado Commissiones response to that referral*

That

response says specifically that the ease of Mr# Love has
cause to the Commission’s attention, the Colorado Commission’o
attention, and In the last paragraph of that letter, It
seems quito clear that the Colorado Commission treated the
referral» 'whatever manner it was made in, as adequate to
Invoke its jurisdiction.
The Colorado Commission, said, "Under the circum­
stances, we could not, in good conscience, accept the sixty
day deferment period» and, accordingly, waive it.
proceed

Will you

speaking to EEOC, ".... undor the provisions

of Titio VII» to give any relief that you can to Mr* Love’?11
How, I see nothing in the Federal Act that prohibits
the state from, treating a referral, or an oral complaint of
any kind and in whatever manner made, as
the state’s jurisdiction#
agency to decide*

.adquate to invoke

This is a matter for the state

It’s a matter of state law, whether its

jurisdiction was invoked#
Q.

It’s that first sentence» "It has come to my

attention that Mr. Love has filed a complaint against the
Pullman Company through your office."

That, you say,

evidences that something gob to the State of Colorado in
writing or orally or not, it dooen’t a ay, just that a complaint

HE. WALLACE:

The record doesn't show it, but

this letter shows —
Q,

Was it an irregularity, or something?

MR* WALLACE:

Well, I think this letter chows that

whatever it — however it was clone, and the testimony is that
it was a referral from, the EEOC, tout the testimony doesn’t
say in what manner*

I think that the letter shows that how­

ever it was done, the Colorado commission treated this
referral as adequate to invoke this response that it was
waiving its sixty-day jurisdiction under the statutory
deferral period*
Q

It says more than nJurisdiction*"

It says

"sixty day deferral period."
MR* WALLACE;
has, under Title VII*

That’s right, well, that’s what it
It has sixty days before EEOC can

then accept jurisdiction, end It’s waiving that period*

It

treated its jurisdiction as Invoked, and it waived its
jurisdiction, end there’s nothing in the. Federal Act that
prevents the state from treating that referral as adequate
to invoke its jurisdiction.

What 706(b) says is that if

blie state agency requires more than just a simple, written
complaint -«

h/3

Q.

Even if it was v-rrltton, it can be bitten and

taken off»

MR. WALLACES
Q,

*« that is our position. Sow —

You’r® saying, really, that it's the state*s

privilege to determine how its jurisdiction is invoked.
MR. WALLACES That is our position, Your Honor.

We

don’t believ® the Federal statuto presumes to say that the
state could not have treated this as adequate invocation of
its jurisdiction.

It does, in 706(b) say that if the state

requires too much, then merely a written complaint, stating
the facts will be treated as having been adequate for purposes
of then .invoking the Federal remedy*
The other point X wish to respond to is
Hr. Justice Blackman*s question about whether the Pullman
Company has been prejudiced*

Xa Judge Sef* a own opinion on

rehearing* he statesi
,,Tii© record shows that the Colorado Commission in the
1965 proceeding discussed the complaint with the
Pullman Company* They have had notice*at least since
shortly before the Federal Act became effective, of
Mr. Love's complaint, and any lapse of time that
occurred thereafter is attributable to the fact
that the Company was unwilling to give redress, and
so we ask the Court to remand this case for a hearing
on the merits of this longstanding complaint of Mr* Love,, '
