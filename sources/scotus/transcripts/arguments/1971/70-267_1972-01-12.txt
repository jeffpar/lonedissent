PROCEED! N G S
MRa CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear now 70-26?,

National Labor Relations Board against Scrivener,
Mr, Bray, you may proceed whenever you're ready*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM TERRY BRAY, ESQ,.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, BRAY:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case involves a Labor Board determination of
unfair labor practices against an employer under the National
Labor Relations Act.
In this Court only a single issue is presented:
whether the employer, by discharging certain of his employees
because they had given sworn statements when meeting with a
Board agent, who was investigating unfair labor practice
charges against the employer, violated Section 8(a)(4) or
Section 8(a)(1) of the Act by virtue of the discharges,
Q

Are these independent?

MR. BRAY:
dent.

Yes, they are; we consider them indepen­

The Board held that they were independent. And we have,

all along, presented them as independent grounds for upholding
the decision of the Board.
Q

Bo you have any preference?

MR. BRAY: Do we have any preference?

We would like

for the Court to find for the Board on both grounds.

Q

X see.

MR. ERAYs

We have no preference as to which ground

if the Court chooses to go on one or the other.
£)

You mean the case equally supports either one?

MR. BRAY : We think that there are strong arguments
supporting either ground„

I would be reluctant to say.that

our arguments are more strong on one ground than the other.
Q

Mr. Bray.

MR. BRAY:
Q

Yes/ sir?

On the second ground,, your brief at page 17

states that the guarantee under 8(a) (1) includes the right of
employees to participate in the administrative proceedings —■
the processes of the Board.

I didn't see any cases cited for

that proposition in your brief.
Is this just to be taken as an assertion or are there
cases that support it?
MR. BRAY:

No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the cases which

we cite at page 18 of our brief make this abundantly clear;
indeed, the quote at the top of page 18, on. the Oil City Brass
Works case, is squarely in point on this.

The Court there did

hold that the Section 7 guarantees of employees include the
right, not only of employees to participate but to have others
participate on their behalf.

And that employer discrimination

oil account of participation in Board proceedings infringed the
employees' guarantees under Section 7, and thus violated

5
Section 8(a)(I).
The Board in this ce.se found that the discharges
violated both Section 8(a)(4) and Section 8(a)(1),

The

Court of Appeals refused, however, to sustain the Board on
either ground.

On the Section 8(a)(4) basis, the Court relied

on its earlier decision in the Ritchie case, and concluded that
th* Section 8(a)(4) covered only the precise matters stated
in that section? that is, actually giving testimony in a formal
Board hearing or filing charges with the Board,
With respect to Section 8(a)(1), the Court concluded
that it could not uphold an independent violation of that
section, because to do so would be implicitly to overrule its
decision in the Ritchie case,

and it was unwilling to do so,

We think that the Court erred on both grounds.
With respect to the factual setting, the Court of
Appeals accepted, for purposes of the legal question involved,
and which we have presented here, the findings of the Examiner
as sustained by the Board.
While respondents have taken issue v/ith our statement
of the case, and indeed have restated the case in their brief,
that essentially is a result of their view of the record
evidence and what the record evidence showed,

And their view

of the case was not sustained by the Examiner or by the Board,
and, as 1 say, the sufficiency of the evidence questions are
not here, they were not considered by the court below.

We,

6

instead, are relying on what the Examiner found arid the Board
sustained.
On that basis, the Examiner’s decision is set out in
full at pages 215 through 249 of the Appendix and shows that
the unfair labor practices here arose out off an organizational
campaign among respondent's employees during the spring of
1968»
The respondent is a sole proprietor engaged in the
electrical contractor business in Springfield, Missouri.
On March 18, 1968, five of his six employees signed
authorization cards for the Electrical Works Union.

Respondent

was notified of this the next day, and upon this notification
he refused to bargain with the union, and later during the day
complained to his employees about their activities.
Several days later he discharged three of the card
signers and on the same day hired two new employees who were
not affiliated with the union.
The next day, March 21, the union filed unfair labor
practice charges regarding the discharge of the three employees
on March 20th.
Subsequently the dischargees were reemployed, and
were working for the company when, on April 17th, the Board
field examiner called on Mr. Scrivener to discuss the charges
filed against him.
That evening the field examiner met with the five

c -.rd signers to discuss the unfair labor practice charges, and
received written statements from them»
The next day Mr. Scrivener questioned the four card
signers who were still in his employ about their meeting with
the examiner, and that afternoon he dismissed all four of them
purportedly because there was not enough work for them to do.
The examiner found that this was not the real reason
for the discharges and that, instead, the dismissals were
because these employees had met with and given sworn written
statements to the Board examiner.
He held that a discharge on this ground violated both
Section 8(a)(4) and Section 8{a){1} of the Act.
Mr. Scrivener urged that he was not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Board.

The evidence taken before the

examiner showed that indeed Mr. Scrivener did not meet the
Board's discretionary jurisdictional standetrd, but that it did
meet the statutory standard of affecting commerce.
This was shown by evidence indicating that Mr.
Scrivener purchased something in excess of $20,000 of goods
in interstate commerce during 1967, and the; projected sales
from a single source for 1968 were in excess of $30,000.
Thus the Board ~~ 1 beg your pardon t the examiner
fou;,:d that statutory jurisdiction was met, and because of the
nature of the discharges for having given si statement to the
•examiner, the.;: the Tri il Examiner concluded that public policy

B
required that the Board assert its statutory jurisdiction to
protect participants in Board proceedings.
Because the jurisdiction would be asserted on this
ground, the Examiner also went ahead to consider other unfair
labor practice charges, found that those unfair labor practices
had occurred, and recommended that the Board also remedy them.
The Board agreed with the Examiner that statutory
jurisdiction was shown and that public policy required it to.
exercise jurisdiction to protect the employees who had been
discharged on the ground that they had given a statement to
that Board field agent.
The Board held, however, that the other unrelated
unfair labor practice charges were not something over which
they should assert jurisdiction on public policy grounds, and
thus the Board dismissed them.
We think that the discharges here, based as they ware
under the facts as they come to this Court, solely on the fact
that these employees met with and gave statements to a Board
field agent investigating unfair labor practice charges
against their employer, clearly come within the protections of
Section 3(a)(4) , and also within the protection of Section
8(a)(1) .
We think that the court below erred on both grounds
in not sustaining the Board's order.
Section 8(a)(4) bars discrimination against any

9
employee by his employer because he has filed charges or given
testimony under the Act.
It is our submission that this provision protects
not only the matters precisely stated, that is filing charges
and testifying, but also the sort of in-between actions involved
here? giving sworn statements to a Board agent during the
course of an investigation of unfair labor practice charges
that had been earlier filed.
Would you draw the line at sworn written statemerits?
MR. BRAY: That.is the only thing that we need, Mr.
Justice Blackmun, for purposes of our case here.

The Board's

position is that Section 8(a)(4) offers broad protection for
any participation in a Board proceeding.

That need not be

decided, however, in order to sustain the holding in this case,
since here the employees who were discharged had given written
statements to the Examiner, and —
Q

What -- pardon me, go ahead.

MR. BRAY:
Q

Go ahead, Mr. Bray.

MR. BRAY:
8(a)(4)

Pardon me.

Our basic submission is that Section

should be construed to protect this sort of activity,

at the least.
Q

I would find it helpful, Mr. Bray, in following

up your answer its Mr. Justice Blackmun's question, if you could

10
tell us how you could reach that result as a matter of
statutory construction.

Perhaps you*re just going to get to

that now.
MR. BRAY:

Yes, sir.

I think that not only is this

construction in full accord with the obvious intent of the
section and the legislative history behind it, as well as with
the Board's long-standing view of the section, but also
substantial policy reasons.
Q

But how, as a matter of English usage?

1 mean,

is it by a broad reading of the word "testimony"?
MR. BRAY: That's precisely it, Mr. Justice.

We

think that testimony, in the context in which it occurs here
and in the context of the development of this section itself,
indicates not just testifying at a formal Board hearing but,
more broadly, the giving of information to a Board agent at
any time during a Board proceeding.
Q

If that's the case, why do you need a separate

protection for filing charges?

Wouldn't just the giving of

testimony be broad enough to cover filing charges, if your
construction is right?
MR. BRAY:

I suppose it could be, although the filing

charges is not the actual discussing of the charges after
they have beer: filed with the Board? which, we think “testifying*
covers.

The proceedings from the time the charge is filed,

wick triggers the Board's participation in the charge, would

then be protected by Section 8(a)(4) under the testifying
language „
Q

These were affidavits, weren't they?

MR, BRAY:

Yes, sir? they were.

And would they have been admissible, of

Q

themselves f without the presence of these employees as witnesse
at the hearing?
MR. BRAY:
Q

Would not?

MR. BRAY::
who gave it.

It's ray understanding they would not.

Not necessarily with the particular witnes

Perhaps soma other witness could have provided

the necessary basis for their introduction.
Q

Or perhaps if the witnesses were unavailable for

soma reason?
MR. BRAY:

Yes, sir.

Novi, the gist —Q

You mean it's only a question of authentication?

MR. BRAY:
Q

In terras of putting in the evidence.

If they were offered at the hearing?

MR. BRAY:

In general, the Rules of Civil Procedure

govern in Board proceedings ~~
Q

You mean the Rules of Evidence?

MR. BRAY:

Yes, sir.

ltd it is my understanding that the affidavits would
ordinarily have been admissible into evidence as such.

12
Indeed, the only affidavit that was actually intro­
duced into evidence was introduced to clarify some of the
testimony given by one of the affiants, which was considerably
different from his affidavit,
Q

I suppose they would have been available for

impeachment?
MR. BRAY:

Yes, certainly they would have been.

Indeed, this is standard Board procedure and Board rule, that
if a witness testifies at a hearing, any statements he has
given the Board are then available for cross-examination
purposes.
Q

Is the Board practice normally when you're

contemplating an absent witness is to have a deposition along
the lines provided for in the Rules of Civil Procedure?
MR. BRAY;

No.

It's my understanding that the Board

practice is more along the lines of what happened here. The
field agent obtains, in the field, a statement from the
employees of what transpired with respect to the matters that
he's investigating, he then puts that in writing and has the
agent sign -- I beg your pardon, has the. employee or whoever
is giving the statement sign and swear to it before him.
And this is the only preparation in terms of having
something ir, writing that goes on before the hearing begins.
Q

But then supposing that the witness who gave

the affidavit doesn't show up sfc the hearing, which I believe is

13
the quastioii Mr. Justice Brennan asked you.

Is the affidavit

then admissible?
MR. BRAY:
stand

I frankly don't know.

It’s my under­

of course the Board could subpoena the witness» to

have him come; and it has broad powers to do this.
Q

I suppose that at least the ordinary, if they

are going to purport to follow the rules of evidence, the
ordinary exceptions to hearsay would obtain?
MR. BRAY;

Precisely.

And indeed, the rules

specifically provide for that, for deposition, although that
is not the usual procedure, as I understand it.
Q

X take it, Mr. Bray, what you're saying is

that the giving of statements, written or oral, to the
investigative arm of the Board is incidental to the filing of
charges ;; \d both incidental and preliminary to testifying in
the formal hearing.
MR. BRAY;

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it's my submission

that not only is it incidental to but indeed testifying, as
that word is used in Section 8(a)(4) , is broad enough, in
context, to include all of the proceedings before Board
agents from the time the charge is filed until such time as
the hearing actually gets under way.
3

I suppose the case, civil or criminal, in the

Federal Courts or any other courts, where reprisals were of
any kind, ware inflicted upon persons for giving statements to

14
an investigator, private or public, would be dealt with by
contempt proceedings; could be —
MR. BRAY: Certainly.
Q

— dealt with by contempt proceedings on the

part of the judge, couldn’t they?
MR. BRAY;

Yes, sir.

Then the ~
Q

Mr. Bray, may I as3c, on the 8(a)(4), I gather

testimony then has the reach of giving evidence, doesn’t it?
MR. BRAY:

That’s our submission.

That was

predecessor provision, that was the language of the predecessor
provision.
Q

Well, that was the old Executive Order under the

'National Recovery Act, wasn’t it?
MR. BRAY:

Precisely.

|

And at the time Section 8(a)(4) was enacted, and it
supplanted this Executive Order, not only did Congress not
indicate any intent to narrow the protections offered but the
Senate memorandum quoted in our brief indicated that Section
8(a)(4) was intended as a mere reiteration of the Executive
Order, and thus, it’s our submission that 8(a)(4), like its
predecessor, covers any giving of evidence, and certainly the
giving of sworn statements such as here.
Farther, this comports with the clear legislative
purpose behind the section, as this Court explained that

15
purpose in Hash vs. Florida Industrial Commission„

There the

Court stated that Congress, by enacting Section 8(a)(4) , has
that it wishes all persons with information about
unfair labor practices to be completely free from any employer
coercion against reporting them to the Board.
The reason that this type of protection is necessary
is well stated in the John Hancock case, also cited in our
brief, and from the District of Columbia Circuit.
This protection must be available in order to protect
the Board*s channels of information from being dried up by
employer intimidation.
The basic aim was to keep free and unimpeded the
channels of communication between both the Board, on the one
hand, and the participants in its proceedings on the other.
And to dispel any fear by the participants that by assisting
the Board in its investigations they might be subjected to
.tempioyer reprisals,
Preliminary preparations, including the taking of
sworn statements such as here, are every bit as essential to
an effective Board proceeding as are the filing of charges
and the actual giving of testimony in a formal Board hearing.
h.nd thus should be included within the scope of this section.
As I've indicated, this interpretation for which we
urge is entirely consistent with the legislative history of
.e eereie

.

Certainly under the Executive Order under the

IS
National Industrial Recovery Act, this type of statement would
have been protected, and Congress, when it replaced the
Executive Order with Section 8(a)(4), indicated that it did
not intend to change the coverage of the protection afforded,
Q

Mr. Bray, your difficulty here with the Court of

Appeals really goes back to the Ritchie case, doesn't it?
MR. BRAY s Certainly with respect to the Eighth
Circuit, yes, sir„
Q

And, if you know, do you recall whether cert

was applied for in Ritchie?
•MR. BRAYS

It was not, to my knowledge, there is
%

no cert history on it in the citation.
Q

And you don? t know why?

MR. BRAY:

Other than ‘the fact that in that case, I

certainly know one reason why, and the reason, I think, is
fairly apparent.

In that case the Board had found that the

discharge involved violated other sections of the Act,
specifically Sections 8(a)

CD

and 8(a)(3).

The Court of

Appeals had no difficulty in sustaining the order with respect
to those two sections, and it held that it was reluctant to
enforce Section 8(a)(4) in the circumstances of the case.
Obviously we had the same relief that we would have
A&d» even if Section 8(a)(4) had been enforced.

Thus, that

was not the type of case that we needed to bring to this Court.
Kars, on the other hand, the Court has refused to

17
give these employees any relief from what we consider to be
obvious unfair labor practicesAnd we think, too, that the
Board correctly asserted jurisdiction in this context.
Q

Well, 1 take it, the case could not have been

brought here without the Solicitor General’s approval, anyway?
MR. BRAY:
Q

That’s correct, yes, sir.

And it may be that it was sought and decided by

the Solicitor General that it shouldn’t have been brought here?
MR. BRAY;
tively.

It may well have been denied administra­

That's right.
This view, also, is consistent with long-standing

Board interpretation of Section 8(a)(4).

The Board has not

always invoked Section 8(a)(4), when other violations are
involved, and the remedies for those other violations would be
the same as the remedies under Section 8(a)(4).

Indeed, we

think that explains the Ogle Protective Service Company case,
on which respondent relied, and in which the Beard merely
adopted its Examiner's finding that it would not invoke an
) (4) violation, pro forma, and without considering the
matter.
Where the Board has given detailed consideration to
the issue, it has uniformly held that Section 8(a)(4) is
violated when an employer makes discharges because of
participating In Board proceedings.
The practicalities of agency action also demand this

18
result.

A participant in a Board proceeding often doss not

actually file charges- or testify.• He may not testify because
.ais testimony is cumulative, as happened in the Da3.-Tex case?
or because the case is settled or dismissed before it gets to
hearing, which happens in over 90 percent of the Board's cases,
according to its 35th Annual Report.
Or the situation may be as it was here;

the employer

discharges his employees immediately upon learning of their
assistance to the Board, and before any hearing could possibly
have started.
If no protection is afforded for participants in
these situations, then we think it obvious that the participants
will be much less willing to assist in Board proceedings and
that this will impair the Board in its investigative and otherstatutory efforts.
Finally, several Courts of Appeals have agreed with
our view of Section 8(a)(4), specifically the Fifth Circuit
has twice sustained Board orders, finding Section 8(a)(4)
violations, and in essentially similar contexts as that
presented here.
The H & S Steel Company case, on page 16 of our brief,
oj

well -an the Pal-Tex Optical Company case on that same page,

involved Section 8(a)(4) violations xdiere the employee was
discriminated against either for giving statements to a Board
agent or for appearing at a Board hearing but not actually

19

testifying.
The o-i.'ses sited at Note 11 of our brief, on page it.
Indicate .;.hat other Courts of Appeals have also broadly read
Section 8 (a)(4) to protect participants in Board proceedings
in contexts other than merely filing charges or testifying»
Finally, the subpoena powers under Section 11 support
our view.

As I indicated, the Board could have subpoenaed

these man to give the statements which they gave the agent,
had they not done so willingly.

In that event, the Second

Circuit has held that the Board must assert jurisdiction to
protect the participants in Board proceedings.

It cannot

decline to assert jurisdiction in that circumstance.
tough the employees here gave the statements
Willingly, we think this should be encouraged, not discouraged,
and that there is no sound reason for denying equal protections
to the voluntary participant as to those who appear under threat
of subpoena.
Turning to Sectioti 8(a)(1), it was the Board Ss
position, and it is our position here, that the discharges,
on the grounds which the Examiner found, independently
violated Section 8(a)(1).

We do hot think that the court

below gave any significant consideration to this issue and
instead brushed it off with the explanation that to uphold an
independent 3(a)(1) violation would be implicitly to overrule
Ritchie?

• r.. though Ritchie involved only Section 8(a)(4).

20
It's our position that these dis sharg s. are clearly
barred by Section 8(a)(X).

That section prohibits employer

conduct that Interferes with, restrains, or coerces employees
in the exercise of rights guaranteed by Section 7«
Section 7, in turn,- assures broadly that employees
shall have the right to form, join, or assist labor organisa­
tions and to engage in other concerted activities for purpose
of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.
The Board, and various Courts of Appeals, have
repeatedly held that Section 7 — that the Section 7 guarantees
include the right to participate and give information in Board
iv

proceedings, as well as the right to have others do the same?
without fear of being penalised by an employer for having done
so»
As I mentioned, the Oil City Brass Works case, as wel'l
as the other cases on page 18 of our brief, established this
proposition»
Fur

Lt is well-established that employer

discrimination, because of participating in Board proceedings
or because of doing so on behalf of others, unlawfully
restrains rank-and-file employees in the free exercise of their
Section 7 rights and thus violates Section 8(a)(1).
Indeed, the Fifth Circuit has gone so far as to hold
that this ir;. an 3(a) (1) violation as a matter of law.
.1 Courts of Appeals cases involve quite similar

21
circumstances to those here.

The Flectro Motive Company■ease,

at pages 18 and 19 of our brief, from the Fourth Circuit, held
that an employer discharge of a Board participant for having
given a Board agent a statement, precisely the circumstances
here, violated Section 8(a) Cl),
The Southland Paint case, from the Fifth Circuit,
similarly held that the discharge of a participant, because he
testified in a Board hearing and because he gave an affidavit
to a Board agent, violated Section 8(a)(1),
In this latter case, the Fifth Circuit said that an
affidavit given in a Board proceeding is essentially the
equivalent of testifying at a Board hearing.
While both these cases involve the discharge of a
supervisor, yet we think the present case is an even stronger
one for invoking the protections of Section 8(a)(1),
Supervisors generally are excluded from the protection
of the Act, and yet in those cases the courts found that they
must be protected in order to protect the rights of the
rank-and-file employees to an effective Board proceeding.
It seems to us to follow.that certainly where an
employee himself, who is protected by the Act, participates in
a Board proceeding and then is discharged for having done so,
tfc . circumstances here, that Section 8(a)(1) has been violated
because his Section 7 rights have been infringed.
The Texas Industries case, set forth at page IS of

22
our brief, also supports our view of Section 8(a)(1),

There,

tho tilth Circuit upheld a Board finding that merely asking
employees about statements they had given a Board agent and
for copies of those statements violated Section 8(a)(1),
We think, again, that the present case, where the employer
goe-i much further and discharges the employees because they have
done so, is even more appropriate for invoking the Section
8(a)(1) protections.
The reasons that we have stated with respect to
Section 8(a)(4) also, many of those, apply to support our
construction of Section 8(a)(1).
The legislative purpose of protecting all Board
participants and assuring that all persons with information
about unfair labor practices are free to come before the Board
certainly justifies this construction.
Moreover, the practicalities of agency practice, and
the fact that many participants do not actually testify or file
charges, supports our construction of 8(a)(1) in order to
assure these men that they will be protected from discharge for
having come before the Board,
Lastly, this is, has been the consistent Board
construction of Section 8(a)(1) over many years, and this is
entitled to weight.
Tie Section 11 subpoena powers also support this
view.

As I've explained, the employees could have been sub-

23
yar.ur&d to give these statements, and hod they done so it is
alto clear that the Section 8(a)(1) protections are as broad
as the Section IX subpoena powers.
Q

Well, aren't you really talking about a

construction of Section 1 rather than 8(a)(1)?
MR. BRAYs With respect to whether the type of
activity hare involved is included within Section 7, yes; but
we think that that's clear, there have been innumerable holdings
to that effect, and we do not understand the Eighth Circuit
to have denied the enforcement of our order here on the grounds
that this type of activity is not protected activity under
Section 1.
Q

Well, what right under Section 7 do you think is

violated in this?
MR. BRAY: The right of employees, the general right
of employees to engage in concerted activity is, or includes
the right to invoke and have an effective Board proceeding to
protect those rights.

This has been held in all of the cases

cited in our brief, and we think it1s well established.
That right is infringed when a participant in a Board proceeding
is discharged because of having done so.
As 1 say, Judge Reaves for the Fifth Circuit concluded
that a discharge on this ground violated Section 8(a)(1) rights
as a matter of law.
Had these employees —

24
Q

Well, Section (4) then is just redundant, is

that it?
MR* BRAY:

Well, it's redundant if you accept ray

construction of Section 8(a)(4), but there’s no problem there
because it’s clearly established that the same activity can
violate one or all of the sections of the Act.

It need not

violate just one.
Had these employees been subpoenaed, as I say, it is
clear that they would have been.protected.
Further, the mere fact that these employees appeared
voluntary rather than pursuant to a subpoena is not any ground
for denying them similar protection.

And, indeed, the Fourth

Circuit, in the Electro Motive Company case, showed that this
had to be so because the effect on protected rights is precisely
the Seine., whether or not the participant has been subpoenaed?
and the court in that case held that it did not make any
difference whether or not a subpoena had been issued.
Q

Does it violate concerted activity if you had

only one employee involved here rather than four?
MR. BRAY;

If we had one employee involved and he

was engaged in union activities, yes, we would argue that this
was a protected right under Section 7.
In other words, I think -Q

That's concerted activity?

MR. BRAY:

ORAL ARGUMENT OP DONALD W. JONES, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. JONES:

I think that would be true, Your Honor.

However, this case — 1 v/ant to emphasise at the outset, this
case has some very unusual features, which made it unlikely
that any statements would be taken in this case from any
employees.
Q

How does the Board function, or how do employees

get the cases to the Board if any impediments are put in the
way of having them freely give statements to government agents
who corae and call on them?
MR. JONES:
Q

Uh --

How can the Board function?

MR. JONES: Well, for one thing, the Board has foreseen
this difficulty, 1 think, and they have — and the Congress has,
as well? in connection with the Administrative Procedure Act,
which has some provisions that make all, certain government
records available to the public information.

They have

exempted these statements by the Board, the Congress has, and
the Administrative Procedure Act, and Congress has said these
statements may be held strictly confidential? they are
exempted frem the public information provisions of the Board.
So all statements taken by the Board in investiga­
tion;? are held to be strictly confidential, by law, and they
caoitot hi.

tio contents of those statements or the fact of

21
their taking cannot be —
Q

Yes, but what has that got to do with the need

to interrogate witnesses before you call them?
You don’t •— lawyers don't customarily bring witnesses
into a tribunal if they don’t know what they’re going to say,
do they?
MR. JONES: That’s true, Your Honor.

However, now;

these statements that we’re talking about are taken at a stage
of the proceeding which is before any complaint has been issued.
And now as to —
Q

It’s to determine whether a complaint should

issue, isn’t it?
MR. JONES: Right.

Right.

However, in our case,

Your Honor, if I may go back to the facts of this case
momentarily, in th.i,s case the facts are this:
The charge was filed, containing a claim of 8(a)(1) ,
3(a)(3) , and 8(a)(5), I believe, originally.
Q

Yes.

MR. JONES:

Immediately upon getting this charge,

the company counsel, who was myself, wrote a letter to the
Regional Director and informed the Regional Director of the
Board that this company did not meet the Board’s jurisdictional
standards..

He did not meet the $50,000 requirement for

jurisdiction.

And we offered at that time to show our books

and records to the NLRB, so that they could see that they had

23
no jurisdiction over this company.

At the same time the

company s.- n ' the three employees then involved, who bed
allegedly, according to those original charges, been laid off,
sent them a letter saying, "You have not been laid off? you are
free to work here as usual, as long as work is available.
This is a misunderstanding."
We sent a copy of that to the Board.

The employees

came back to work.
Now, about a month later, the Labor Board agent came
down to my office — this is shown in the record — and we
had a meeting, to go over the books and records of the company
to see if, in fact, the Board had jurisdiction.
Now, contrary to what is said by.petitioner * s brief,
there is no evidence.in the record that we discussed the merits
of the charges at that time.

And in fact we did not, we

■ discussed merely the fact of whether there was jurisdiction.
Now, we had no'idea the Board was going to take any
statements, from any of our employees at that time.
no requirement that the Board do so.

There is

We think the Board had

no reason to take any statements from the employees, if they
had no jurisdiction over the company at that stage.
Now, at that stage, then, anything prior to that time
is no longer a claim to be a violation before this Court,
because the Labor Beard itself, after the hearing, declined to

assert ju::Aod .ofion on anything up to that date.

'

29

the next day, according to the evidence,
the next day, after the company representative and I mat with
ehe Labor Board investigator in my office and went over our
financial records, which show, as according to — as everyone
now admits, that the Board did not have jurisdiction at that
point, it, was outside,this company was too small to meet the
Board's jurisdictional standards.
This company, as a result of being toe small to meet
the Board's jurisdictional standards, this company could not
get access to the Board's processes to protect it from an
illegal secondary boycott, which the Onion started out against
the company on March 15, 1968, at a time when the Union
representative involved in this case admits he did not
represent a single employee of this employer.
So when that March 15, 1968, picketing started, at an
apartment house project where my client had some men working,
my client could not go to the Labor Board and say, “Please help
us stop this secondary boycott, because it violates Section
0(b)(4)% because the Labor Board’s jurisdictional standards
published said, "No, no, I’m sorry, Mr. Scrivener, you're too
small for us to protect? we haven’t got time to protect you.55
So, later, whan the Union came and said, ttbw, as the
evidence shows on the 8(a)(5) allegation, when the Union came
and presented cards to the company and said, "Now, we've signed
up the majority of your people, we want to bargain with you".

30
even though the Supreme Court ofthe United States has Said,
iGicseli Packing Company just a few years ago, that an employehas ce abnolute right to an election under 9 (c)(1) (B) under the
Act before they have to bargain, this company, my client,
could not get an election under the Labor Board, because the
Board has published standards saying, "Wo, Robert Scrivener,
you're too small; we haven81 got time to give you an election.
We haven’t got time to let you have access to our processes.”
So then the Union come along, and this Union in this
town, this particular Union in this town, has a standard
form agreement, that the only kind of agreement they will sign
is a standard form agreement, which has been negotiated at the
national level by the National Electrical Contractors
Association and the International Electrical Union.
So when they presented this contract to my client
and said, "Wow, you sign this by 6s00 o'clock tonight or else",
as shown by the record, and that contract is an exhibit in the
Appendix, even though that type of demand, especially when
the contract contains unlawful, nonmandatory subjects of
bargaining, and would — and acceding to that demand would
require my client to delegate away his bargaining responsibilities
to another association in violation of his rights under the
law, and even though this has been declared unlawful by the
boarc!, my client could not file a charge with the Board because
hs*s too small to protect.

31
io, :<

oho Pooud hau — the general counsel’s office

of the Board has attempted to use 8(a)(4) to prosecute my
client as a device when they have no jurisdiction to protect
him or to prosecute him under their own published standards.
Now, I want to go to the events that brought about
this layoff, and I’d like to clarify this.

We hear talk about

discharges? there is no evidence of any discharges on April
18, 1968.

There was an economic layoff on that date.

On

April 18, 1968, which was a day or two after — I think the
record shows it was the next day after the Labor Board had
taken the statements from the men the night before, at the
Union Hall.
Those statements were taken without notice to us,
we werenot present, we had no right to be present? they were
confidential, we had no notice of it, no knowledge of it.
The next morning, the evidence shows that two of the
employees and Mr, Scrivener had some conversation, it was an
isolated, neighborly conversation that people in the Ozarks
customarily have in a small company like this.

It’s not clear,

completely clear who started the conversation, whether the
employee started it or whether Mr. Scrivener started it.
Our version is that the employee came up to Mr.
Scrivener and raid, "Hay, Bob, we talked to the Labor Board
man last night,"

Q

Mr. Jones.

32
MR, JONES:
Q

Yes, sir?

What did the Trial Examiner find?

M'S. JONES: The .Trial Examiner used words similar to
what the petitioner uses here, they say that Mr, Scrivener
questioned the employee.
We submit that the record-is completely opposite to
that finding.

How, we have preserved our argument that there

is no substantial evidence to support the findings of the
.or at every stage of the proceedings.

We urged

that to the Board in our exceptions, which are in detail in the
Appendix; we urged that to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals
in our brief, parts of which we made an Appendix to our brief
in opposition to certiorari in this Court, so that they are
here in this Court —
Q

MR. JONES: That they were fired?

Q

Well, that evidence, would you have much

MR. JONES; The Trial Examiner so found.

The Trial

Examiner found that that violates 8(a) (3) .
Now, we appealed that decision to the Labor Board,
with our exceptions.

We presented these arguments concerning

the fast that the Labor Board had no jurisdiction under its
own jurisdictional standards, and the Labor Board did not
review the findings of fact on 8(a)(3), but they did decline
to assert jurisdiction on 8(a)(3), on the grounds that it
would not be fair for sham to prosecute my client under 8(a) (3)
when thry *— whom h© was outside their jurisdiction, under their

35
published standards, which were authorised by Congress under
Section 14(c)(1) of the Act.
Congress, when they enacted the Labor Act, they gave
the Labor Board power consistent with the commerce clause, all
the power they had on businesses affecting commerce.

But they

also, at a later time, enacted Section 14(c)(1), which gave
the Board authority to decline to assert jurisdiction over a
certain class or category of employers.
The Labor Board has exercised that power, and has
promulgated jurisdictional standards, declining to exercise
jurisdiction over a class or category of employers which, in
the nonretail trade, the nonretail industries is $50,000
annually.

My client is a small employer,.he does not meet

that, and therefore the Labor Board threw out the 8(a)(3) , the
8(a) (1), and the 8(a)(5).
The Labor Board, at page 275 of the Appendix —

MR. JONES?

Yes.

Let tue go to the Board's decision in this case —
Q

There was no cross-petition here on whether- or

not the company is in commerce?
MR. JONES:
Q

And

No, Your Honor.
the Court of Appeals is against you., and

the Board is against you on that?
MR. JONES: ■ No.

Your Honor, here is my position

on that, and I think that X am correct on this:
In the Eighth Circuit we had roughly six arguments,
which had been preserved at all stages.

Those arguments were:

We claim that the Board did

not even prove statutory jurisdiction.
Q

Well, whatever you have there, there's only one

question here, isn't there?
MR. JONES: Well, —
Q .

To come back to.

MR. JONES:

I see what Your Honor is referring to.

The point is, in my opinion, if the Court — I want to males this

37

clear, that if the Court were to decide against me, X don't
think this would mean an outright reversal, because the other
five points we urged in the Eighth Circuit have never been
considered»

The Eighth Circuit, decided for us on one of the

six points.
Q

They also said that you were marginally under

the Act.
MR. JOKES:
Q

Yes.

And —

They didn't say you were marginally out from

under the Act.
[Laughter,1
MR. JONES:

They did say that. They did not review

the substantial evidence question.
Q

Right.

MR. JONES: They did not review the constitutional
question as to whether or not it’s due process of law or a
violation of the Administrative Procedure Act to prosecute an
employer who's too small to protect under their jurisdictional
standards? to use their jurisdictional standards in an
arbitrary and capricious and discriminatory manner to prosecute
an employer who's too small to protect. They didn't decide
that.
And, in fact, while I'm mentioning that point, the
Peterson case of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals is
precedent, squarely on the point in my position on that point.

38
Because that is —
Q

Weil, you simply say that here you can support

the judgment of the Court of Appeals on any ground that, would
support it?
MR. JONES:

X think that that is proper, that if the

Court of Appeals in the Eighth Circuit was correct on any
grounds, 1 would like to have this Court sustain it on that
grounds alone.
Q

But X do want to hasten to —
Well, yet, I thought you said they passed it on

only one ground?
MR. JONES; They passed on only one ground.
Q

Our normal practice would be if we disagree with

you on the point that's here, it would be remanded to the
Court of Appeals' for the other grounds.
MR. JONES; All right.
Well, 1511 go on to the 8(a)(4).
Now, there is no issue here, in my judgment, on
8(a)(1).

X want to make that clear. There is no issue here

on 8(a)(1).

I refer to the Board's decision at page 275 of

the Appendix.
“In these circumstances, we find that equal and
effective administration of the policies of the Act require us tc
limit our exercise of jurisdiction to remedying the Section
3(a)(4) violations."

Congress used chat

They didn't use the word "statements"; they didn't use

a word of broader applicationj they used a technical legal
term, "testimonyts.
And we contend that the statute, on its face, is
clear and unambiguous and that it should be so read, and that
the Eighth Circuit's interpretation of it is just exactly what

Congress wrote.
Q

Was the purpose to insure that the employee

would have a right to give his information to the NLRB?

Was

that the main purpose, and that he should not be -punished for

it?
MR. JONES:

The — I think the purpose was exactly

what Congress — I have to rely on finding the purpose of
Congress upon

ly...what.they said,

I think the purpose,

at least it appears to me, that when Congress wrote 8(a)(4),
they said that employees need protection in two cases, in two

one, where they file a charge and directly

oonfreu.it their employer, we don't want them to be fired or

dis criminated against because they filed a charge.

That issue

is not here.
Two, where they give testimony in a Board hearing.
Now, before a — and if you look at the whole Act together,
under a Board hearing when the charge is filed and they
investigate it and then a complaint is issued, and nor ice
hearine;; at the hearing the employer has a rignt to appear and
cross-examine the witnesses, including any employees who give
■testimony.

The employer has a right to cross-examine.
Q

Well, before you get to that, then how, under

the- sun, does the Board get its charges if it doesn't talk to
the employees?
MR. JONES: That is true.

This — it’s not set forth in

the statute how the Board goes about their investigation.

Congress has provided a criminal penalty, which is

ample protection.
Now, if you say an employer says to an employee, "I’m

Board,Ei well, if his purpose is. violative of 8(a)(3), then
that’s a protection.
However, if you say his purpose—Q

Well, how about if the employer says, "You were

minutes later he says to him, "And, oh, by the way, I’m short
of business and I’ll have to lay you off.”

MR. JOKES:

All right.

there’s criminal penalties there.

This provides ample

That’s ample protection for the employee?

MR. JONES:

it would be ill-advised for an employer to do anything to an
employee that would be interfering with a Board agent's powers,
if it was subjecting him to a $5,000 penalty.

Well,is there a little difference in the standard

of proof in a criminal prosecution than a hearing before NLRB?

Yes, there is, obviously, and —

Q

Because

you don't need the testimony provision,

MR. JONES: Congress has provided — I think Congress
saw that an employee who appeared in open court against his

to every word:, and-cross-examining, the employer was present,
I think that is what Congress meant to protect.
Now, it’s —

Well, in talking to his witness out in the hall,

MR. JONES: Well, if the employee had given testimony,

meant to say that an employer could be held guilty of
discriminating against an employee for something an employee

knowledge.

they find it on the basis that there was some adverse testimony
