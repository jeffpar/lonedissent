We will hear arguments

next in 71-492, Lloyd Corporation against Tanner.
Mr. Black, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE BLACK, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BLACKs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is here upon the issuance of a writ of
certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit,
Now, the case involves a controversy between shopping
center owner and an anti-war handbiller.

1 believe, if X8m

able to properly describe the factual situation in this case,
/

it will be found not to bo the same factual situation as in
Marsh v. Alabama, nor in Logan Valley, nor in Central Hardware.
The petitioner, Lloyd Corporation, is the owner of
a number of pieces of land divided by public streets in
Portland, Oregon? used for shopping centers, as a shopping
center, and known generally as Lloyd Center la Portland,
Oregon.
The respondents in this case are individuals who
represented what they termed the resistance, advocating
resistance to the military draft.
war, anti-draft handbills.

Their handbills were anti­

These respondents sought to distribute their handbills on certain portions of petitioner's land in a mall or
walkway in. the main building of the petitioner, in Lloyd Center.
May I refer briefly to the Appendix, in which we have
copied photographs of the Center, and there's a map, real
estate map at page 115.

Also at page 116 is an aerial

photograph, Exhibit No. 4, of the Center; and, similarly,
another aerial photograph at page 117.
The area that is the entire area, including the
various buildings and the public streets in the Center and the
main building are said to compose something in the neighborhood of 50 acres.
Q

There are how many public streets run through

this, five or six as X remember?
MS. BLACK:

Yes. there are.

They run through the

various parts of the Center, Mr. Justice Douglas? none run
through the main building, which is really the subject of this
particular handbilling.
V

Q

Are the public streets identifiable in any

way, marked in any way that we can see them on there?
MR. BLACK:

There are pictures of the malls and of

the public areas? but I don't think that there is a picture
of the street as such in the exhibits. Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

Well, your exhibit on page 115 shows Broadway,

Weidler, Halsey; they are all public, aren't they?

5

MR. BLACK;

Yes, the map that I understood you to

mean in addition to that map on page 115, that will show the
public streets, and I think probably will answer your question.
That5s Exhibit No. 3, and in referring to it you will note
that the Center on the north is bound by what is known as
Broadway.

The next street that runs through the Canter is

known as Weidler Street; the second one, proceeding on down
the map, is known as Kalsey Street.
And on the west or left-hand side of the map as one
is looking at it, is Ninth Street? on the east is , I think,
Sixteenth Avenue? and on the south, the bottom part of the map
here, it will be noted, is Multnomah Street, plus an indenta­
tion of a public park called the Holladay Park, and some
other streets.
Referring further to this map, which is maybe the
easiest way to explain this, there is a dark line aroundthe
perimeter of Lloyd Center, which includes the private areas
end the public areas.

•

That perimeter is approximately one and

a half miles.
With reference to the — this was not a suburban
operation as such when it was created, these lots and streets
were there at the time Lloyd bought that property.

Not in

the Appendix but in the record'is a map of the City of
Portland, which I think is No, 3-A, Exhibit 3-A, which shows
the approximate location here of Lloyd Center in the City

6
of Portland»
If 1 may take a moment to further describe the ~
this particular area? 1 will point out that there are some 39
blocks, and the blocks there are 200 feet by 200 feet, with
streets on each side of them, some 39 blocks were intended to
bs devoted to this enterprise in 1954.

There were certain

vacations of the streets in some of the area.
noticed on the map as the large building.

That will be

There i?as not a

vacation of other streets in the area, and instead Lloyd
Corporation, following usual provisions of the city ordinance
of Portland, donated and dedicated other properties to
permit the widening of the streets and sidewalks in other
parts of the area.
I don't think that that street vacation question is
material in this case, but it may be considered material by
the respondents in the case.
The construction of the Center, which is important,
so I’ll give it one more moment here, there were two buildings
built with streets adjoining them; at the top of the map there
were two more buildings built later onf then another building,
each with public streets surrounding them.
Then the large building, which we call the main
building, which has in it what has been referred to as a mall,
a mall or a walkway, a lobby, a corridor, whatever one calls
it.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; We5II take up^there after
lunch,
MR. BLACK; Thank you, sir.
[Whereupon, at 12;00 o*clock, noon, the Court was
recessed, to reconvene at 1;GQ o’clocks p.sn., the same day,]

AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:00 p.m.3
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may continue, Mr.

Black.
MR. BLACK:
X would

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice,

like to say just one more word about the

setting, then I wi11 get into the incident and discuss a
little law, if I may.
The place where this handbilling occurred is
photographed and appears at page 134 and 135 of the Appendix.
That's in one of the interior malls or walkways in front of
the Meier a Frank entrance to that mall, in the main building
that I had described, which is one of four, in this Lloyd
Center, which in turn is in Portland, Oregon.
Now, I would like to say —
Q

Who owns the ice rink?

MR. BLACK; The Lloyd Corporation owns the ice rink.
The ice rink is; located in the basement, and there is a big
opening on the first floor where people who are walking in

the mall can look down.
Q

Did this activity take place entirely within a

building?
MR» BLACKj Within this structure which we call a ~which is a building, yes, the main building»
large building.

However, it’s a

The building is maybe — it’s built in the

forzn of a Latin or Greek cross, and it's about 900 feet on
the length and about 500 feet or thereabouts on the cross,
And this is a mall area, the interior of the building, which
leads from the public streets on the various sides, except
that it doesn’t take anything on the west side.

Q

Well, Mr. Black, it’s actually, though, an

extension, isn’t it, of the streets?

I mean the walkways,

the promenades or —
ME. BLACKs

No.

They are not an extension of the

streets, as we see it.
Q

But they are — people getting back and forth

from one -MR. BLACK s-

People can come from a public street

into the mail, yes.
Q

Yes.

And cross it to the opposite, to the

street on the opposite side, don’t they?
MR. BLACKs
Q

They cross the street, correct.

Yes.

MR. BLACK: They cross the street.

Now, on the left

side# for example, in order to get in# why# they'll have to
go up on an escalator to get to this particular level where
this handbilling took place.
Q

Is there any vehicular traffic

MR. BLACK? There's a difference in levels.
Q

in the mall?

MR. BLACKs
Q

Pardon# sir?

Any vehicular traffic?

MR. BLACK:

Ho, there is no vehicular traffic in

the mall.
Q

But there's a great deal of pedestrian traffic?

MR. BLACK:
Q

Well# ~

The public generally.

MR. BLACK:

— we hope there’s a great deal.

For

business purposes.
Q

Everyone who patronises one of these shops #

the skating rink, and so forth?
MR. BLACK:

Well, one of the various buildings,

either across the public streets or in this main building
in the mall there.
Now, 1 would like to say a. word about the policy
of the petitioner, Lloyd Corporation, because that was one
of the allegations in the complaint, which I’ll refer to in a

moment„
Before the Logan Valley case was decided in 1963,

the Lloyd Corporation had a policy of barring all handbilling
of every kind and character in that areas

handbilling by

tenants, commercial, noncommercial, or handbilling by anyone,
because it was considered to be detrimental to their business
and detrimental particularly to what they call customer
motivation,

That was the policy.

When Logan Valley was decided, I think if was about
March in i£68? we changed our policy to permit any handbilling
could come in there that wanted to come in there, if it was
related directly in its purpose to some use that was being
made there of the premises by Lloyd Corporation or by its
tenants.
For example, picketing would have been permitted,
and actually was conducted inside of the mall where the
relationship factor was present, and also where it was, there
was not an alternative because — and it was necessary to allow
the person to come in to get to the particular store in order
to do the picketing.
So that policy was changed.
Then in the fall of 1968, November 1968, about si::
months after the Logan Valley case, this incident occurred in
which the respondents, as I stated they were advocating what
they called the resistance, anti-war.

We got a telephone call

that they would be coming to the place, and the police had
been alerted, and matters of that kind.

11
Q

You showed us where the picketing — where the

leafleting occurred
MR. BLACK?
Q

1 did.

on pages 134 and 135 --

MR. BLACKs
Q

— in front of the Meier a Prank Company.

MR. BLACKS
Q

Correct.

That’s right.

Now, where can we find that on Plaintiff’s

Exhibit No. 3 on page 115?
MR. BLACK:
C>

Is that the map?

Where on page 115, where in this area would

it be, looking down?
MR. BLACK;
Q

I’ve got the Lloyd Center

MR. BLACK:
Q

It’s —

—- approximately in the center.

In the center of “~

MR. BLACKS

Can you see 138 there?

That block

which was formerly block 138?
'

Q

Yes.

MR. BLACK: About there, within 20 or 30 feet of
that, I can’t tell you exactly.
The mall area extending east and west is not a
prolongation of the streets, as such, but it goes from the
east to the west, however to go from one to the other you
have to change levels.

12
But that's about where it occurred»
Also there are entrances up — three entrances, 2
think - up to Halsey Street to the north, at the top of the
map, and there are two or three entrances down to Multnomah
Street, to the south of the map,
Q

Right•

Q

Mr» Black, I take it there’s no problem of

littering in this case?
MR, BLACK:

There was- no problem of littering in

connection with the incident involved, that is of any
consequence*

However, littering is a factor, one of the many

factors, not an all-important one, on private property.
Littering, of course, has been held not to be a reason to
deprive a person of his constitutional rights when it’s on
public proparty, but littering is one of the factors in the •
case.
Now, the incident here is — I might say as 1 gothrough

here that there are really no factual questions on

anything that is brought to the Supreme Court here»
matter is a matter of conclusion of the law.

The whole

And in regard

to the exact character of the incident involved, why, that can
be found on page 17 of the Appendix, because it's copied in
from an agreed statement of facts in the pretrial order*
So there isn't any question whatever as to what happened»
And that's the second division of the ©greed facts, starting

13
on page 16 and page 17«.
The situation briefly was one that these people came
to this area and starting making distribution of their bills
in this private mall area, and they were asked by the guards,
security guards of Lloyd Corporation, to remove themselves,
to make the distribution on the public streets in that area;
and they refused to do so,
there was a controversy.

And there was -— at first — and
Subsequently, however, they did

leave, and they were *— they finished their handbilling, or
at least some of it on the public streets that were there,
available for that purpose.
Now, -tlie matter of legal controversy results from a
suit filed by the respondents against the petitioner in the
United States District Court for Oregon, asking for a
declaratory judgment and injunction.

;

Complaint was made of

the particular incident that 1 described, and there was also
added a statement that it was a policy of the Lloyd Corporation
not to permit noncommercial handbilling of any character in
these private malls, and that they asked for a declaratory
judgment from the District Court to the effect that non­
commercial handbilling could be conducted as long as it was
peaceful and orderly, and as long as whenever the premises were
open for public access.
Now, the case was tried in the District Court, and
the court held — the decision, by the way, of the court is

14
copied in as part of the Appendix that is attached to the
petition in this cane for the writ of certiorari; it's at page
14a, is the particular part of the decision that I want to
comment on,
The court held that the privately owned mall there,
petitioner's main building there* that is the mall* called it
the malls and walkways* were "the functional equivalent of a
public business district"* citing Logan Valley decision, and
stating that respondents had a First Amendment constitutional
right under free speech provisions of it, to distributa hand­
bills there when the property was open to public access, as
long as it was peaceful and orderly.
And that
Q

Did this property, to start with, belong to the

city?
MR. BLACK:
Q

Yes.

Well, not all of it.

Part of it?

MR. BLACK s

The Lloyd Corporation bought some 39

blocks, 200 feet on a side? and those blocks were already
laid out with streets and sidewalks.

And they took part of

those, 1 think IS blocks and made their main building.

The

other. —• of which there was a fourth building built — the
other buildings were left on the lots, except for one or two
instances.

And so that's how it happened, that there were

public streets and sidewalks in part of the area, but not in

15
all of it»
Q

Were there any covenants running to the city on

that grant?
MR. BLACK?
Q

No* You mean was it a clean deal?

Yes *

MR* BLACKs

It was a clean deal, and -chare is copied

into this Appendix -They retained no jurisdiction?

Q

MR. BLACKs

They retained no interest of any kind

or character.
Q

I notice that the special agents of the Lloyd

Center are commissioned by the City of Portland as policemen.
MR. BLACK: That’s right.
no requirement of the city.

That’s Lloyd’s action?

That’s Lloyd’s action, in order

to facilitate their acting as guards in keeping order in the
place.
C

Is that a common thing in Portland for private

security guards to be commissioned?
MR. BLACK:

I can’t answer that accurately.

I5ra

sure it5s

Q

It's common here in Washington.

JR. BLACK:
Xarg

I'm sure it's done in places where it’s

enough to have security guards and things of that

character.

For example, people in bank lobbies, and things

like that.

I think they're commissioned; but I can’t make

16
that representation to yon* because I cion:t know.
Q

Why doesn’t that fact alone make the Lloyd’s

equivalent to the city?

Or isn't that fact alone enough to

show the city is participating in whatever Lloyd’s,, whatever
restrictions Lloyd placed on the property?
MR. BLACK*

1 don't think so.

I don’t think so.

think that’s just for the maintenance of order.

I

I don’t think

that that has anything to do with making it a municipality.
Q

Well, didn’t the Court say so in the case

involving an amusement park just outside of Washington a few
years ago?
C

Glen Echo Park?

0

Glen Echo Park.

MR. BLACK:

Q

I don’t know that case, I’m sorry.

Well, that was a situation in which the private

owner of the park used local police.
ME. BLACKi Well, X think, that —
C

And the Court held this would constitute State

action.
MR. BLACK § Well, I think this, X think, for example,
if 1 personally owned that entire place and I put somebody
out physically with my own hands, 2 suppose they wouldn’t have
any right to sue me for violation of their constitutional
rights.

But, on the other hand, if I called a policeman, and

if I had r policeman do it, and I charged the man with trespass

i?
under the Oregon State law, and he was arrested on that basis,
that would constitute State law, but it wouldn’t make that
place a public place or —
Q

Well, may your security guards, under this city

commission, arrest for violations of that kind on the property?
MR. BLACK:

No,

They have never done so, and did not

do so.
Q

Do they have any authority to do so?

MR, BLACK: Excuse me, sir?
Q

Do they have any authority to do so, under

their commission from the city?
MR, BLACKs
Q

Yes o

MR. BLACK:
Q

To arrest for trespass?

I don’t think any specific authority.

I thought,looking at page 120 of —

MR. BLACK:

They were instructed not to do any

arresting, and they didn’t do any arresting.
Q
authority.

Page 120 indicates they do have specific
Plaintiffs’ Exhibit No. 8.

MR. BLACK:
G

Yes.

98If a misdemeanor is committed in the presence

of the officer, arrest is proper.”
Q

Can a misdemeanor committed in the presence of

a private person be the subject of a citizen arrest in Oregon?
MR, BLACK:

I think so, yes.

18

Q

Well, then, does this add anything to the —

does the commission add anything to the power to make an
arrest for it?
MR. BLACK:

I don't think so.

I haven't thought so.

I haven't felt that that had anything to do.with the question
of whether this place is considered to be a sort of municipality
like Logan Valley.
Q

Well, I take it, a private citizen can't do

what the second paragraph says here, "the officer has every
reason to believe that a suspect participated in a felony/*
even though it's out of his presence, "arrest is proper/3
A private citizen couldn’t do that, could he?
MR. BLACK:

Well, 1' don’t know that I exactly get

your point.
Q

Were these arrests made on the basis of offenses

committed in the presence of the security guards?
MR, BLACK: There were no arrests made.
Q

Well„ 1 mean, I mean for the removal, the

efforts to remove thorn.
MR. BLACK: The guards were there, and —
Q

They witnessed the act, that's what I’m trying

to get at.
MR. BLACK:

Yes, that’s right? they witnessed the

acts, and they were the ones that told

that asked the

people to do their handbilling on the public street.

19

Q

Mr. Black, the respondents simply left after

a warning, did they?
MR. BLACK;

Yes.

And did their handbilling on the

public streets.
0

And why were they asked to leave?

MR. BLACK; They were asked to leave because it was
our private property, and we had a policy against handbilling,
and the handbilling bore no relation whatever to anything that
was
Q

Well, were they asked to leave because they were

committing a trespass under the city ordinance, or were they
asked to leave because they were violating some rule that
Lloyd had?
MR. BLACK; They were violating a rule, a policy
that Lloyd had.
Q

And so city police were enforcing that rule?

MR. BLACK: Wo 11, it wasn’t the city police, we have
these security guards. ' And, as far as that’s concerned, it
was the manager of the place, too, discussing the matter with
then; but it wasn’t a ratter where local police were called
as such.
Q

Yes.

MR, BLACK: Mhey were just told that it was a policy
and had been a policy for eight years, and were asked to —
Q

Well, !•:> most people ~~ do they wear the uniform

20

of city police?
MR. BLACK2 They have a uniform, but not the uniform
of the city police.
Q

Bo people think they have the authority to

arrest for violations of the law?
MR.

BLACK:

Q

Yes.

MR. BLACK:

X wouldn't think so.

People generally, X don't know.

Q

But the record doesn't show?

Q

Ye3, it shows on page 142:

badge where the City is gold.

"We have a silver

The button on our uniform are

all silver where the City police are all gold.

The City has a

two-inch stripe down the britches that we don't have."
It’s all in the record here, on 142.
0

Kr, Black# do you regard this factual aspect

of the case involving the security guards as any different
than if the owner of a single standing private hardware store,
finding someone leafleting inside his store that he didn’t want,
called the police and asked them to eject him?
MR. BLACK:

X don't find it any different than if

the owner had simply asked people to leave.

Just, asked them to leave.

That's all that

be arrested for trespassing.

They were told that they could
They were told that.

21
And there was some testimony, Your Honor , in the
case that was a little bit different than the stipulated
facts.

One witness testified that he had been threatened with

arrest, and the District Judge considered that to be sufficient
State action in order to justify the United States District
Court having jurisdiction under the Civil Rights Statute in
order to hear the case.
Q

But I suppose the Portland police are available

to any private property owner who finds someone on his property
that he doesn't want, on a trespass complaint, aren’t they?
MR. BLACKS
Q

It would be, yes.

Mr. Black, who selects the guards, who pays

their salaries, who has the right to fire them?
MR. BLACKs

The Lloyd Corporation selects them

and hires them, and would have the right to fire them.
Q

Does the city have any control over what the

guards do?
MR. BLACKs
Q

Rone at all.

Absolutely none.

Mr. Black, why did Lloyd have them commissioned

by the city?
MR. BLACK:

I think it’s a matter of convenience,

there's shoplifting in a place of that character, and other
disturbances.

And if these men were just attendants, as such,

they wouldn’t have the, at least they demonstrated the
apparent power to cause the incident to be taken care of.

22
Q
police?

Bo they did have the apparent power of the city

Or did you mean to say that?
MR. BLACK:

Well, 1 think the evidence shows that

they had what they call a special police commission
authorising them? but they didn’t exercise it in this case,
other than to explain the policy.
Q

But they did ostensibly have it?

MR. BLACK: Well, they —
0

Indeed, one man though they had it, because he

said he was threatened with arrest.
MR. BLACK: Well, anybody could threaten anybody with
arrest, as 3uch, it wouldn’.t have to be a policeman.
Q

Well, wouldn’t it be a little different if a

man in uniform did?
MR. BLACK:
0

Pardon, sir?

Would it be a little different if the man was

in uniform, with a gun and a club?
MR. BLACK:
any guns.

Yes.

But I don’t know that they had

Nobody had any guns, 2 don't think.
Q

But it says here

Q

Yhe record indicates that they had guns, on

page 142.
MR. BLACK-: Well, this is a large place.

It's for

the protection of the public, things ofthat character.

We

pay the taxes and administer the entire situation, as such’

23
there.
Now, just proceeding, I think.1 told you that the
Ninth Circuit decided•— rather? the District Court had
failed to give any attention to our contention that this
h&n&billing had no relation at all to the use that we were
making of the premises»
Q

And also that —

1 see on page 146 of the record? Mr» Black? that

there are a number of exceptions to the soliciting or handing
out literature or picketing.

I se® one for the American Legion?

another is the Volunteers of America; another is the Salvation
Army.

And there's *— I thought perhaps one other.
But? anyway? there are a few.
MR. BLACK;

There were soms — yes.

Between

pages 185 and 195 there is the statement of the president
of the corporation.

He was asked about that? and said that

he felt that that was a charitable feature that was engaged in.
They allowed the Salvation Army to put their kettles there
©nee a year? at Christmas.

They allowed the Veterans? I

believe? to sell their poppies on one occasion. There were
two or three things of that kind? and limited to that of a
charitable character.
I will say that there was other evidence in the
esse' of. promotional activities t and there was substantial
testimony in the case to the effect that the promotional
activities

— or the only evidence really in the case about it

24
was that the promotional activities were put on on purpose
for the purpose of bringing people there,

Everything from an

Ella Fitzgerald concert to an antique car parade,*, things like
that,
Q

I see that President Johnson and Vice President

Humphrey were invited to —
MR. BLACK?

Once every four years they ask them to

come in order to bring people to the place? and that was the
extent, all other political speeches and talks were turned
down, they were not permitted.
Q

It was generally not permitted,,

But isn't that all irrelevant unless this is a

public place?
MR. BLACK:

1 think it’s all irrelevant.

I think

that phase is irrelevant, just like it is -Q

But if it is the equivalent of Logan PlaZ'&f

it is relevant, isn't it?
MR. BLACK: Well, I think this, Mr. Justice White:
I don't know of a department store or any merchant that doesn't
put on some kind of promotion in order to get people into his
place, and these were promotions.
Q

Some of these Vietnam demonstrations attract

quite a lot of people.
MR. BLACK: Well ■— but we want to attract the kind
of people that we think will be customers there; and others
are not that.

-I think that's quite possible in any crowd.

25
Q

Isn’t it equally irrelevant if it, isn’t a public

place, because if it’s a public place the First Amendment takes
over.
MR. BLACK:

Yes, I think the First Amendment would

take over if it were a public place, and that would be
entirely different than in a private setup, 1 think.

But I

think the fact that operating a store setup, with your various
tenants, I think the promotional feature is completely
incompetent, and irrelevant in this case.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your time has expired now,

Mr. Black.
MR. BLACK; Tharsk you.
Q

Could I ask before you sit down, the ordinance

that is printed on page 194, is applicable only to the Lloyd
Center, is it not?

The city ordinance.

It’s not applicable

to other private units?
MR. BLACK:

No, that -— on page 193?

It's not a general ordinance, just an ordinance

that applied to Lloyd's?
MR. BLACK?

Yes.

A specific ordinance applicable

to the application for vacation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL R. HEIL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. NEIL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I suppose I could begin facetiously by saying that
Mr. Black says the purpose of building the shopping center was
to get people to come and buy things, and it succeeded.
plaintiffs did buy something.

These

When told to leave the

premises, they said, "Where can we eat?"

And a nice security

guard said, "Down at Manning's, right in the chopping center",
and they went there and purchased food.
Q

But —

Well, they couldn’t refuse them service, could

they, under the holdings of this Court?
MR. NEIL:

No, of course not, Your Honor? and I

don’t suggest that’s a controlling factor.
Q

Well, that doesn’t help us one way or the other,

does it?
MR. NEIL:

No, it does not.

I think, Your Honor, in view of the questions of the

27
Court, though, that it is worthwhile spending some additional
time on the facts of this ease.
It does involve a large urban shopping canter, and
I think I can perhaps assist the Court in getting the relation­
ship to 'die city and -~
Q

Was there a postal substation in Lloyd Center

at one time?
MR. NEIL;

If there is within the shopping center,

I’m not aware of it, Your Honor; the record doesn’t show.
If til© Court could look at Exhibit 3 on page 115
of the Appendix again, the map, I think you can relate it to
the aerial photographs which appear on the following two pages.
You v;ill note on Exhibit 3 this main 18-square block or formerly
18-squ.ara block area, which we call the main part of Lloyd
Center, and where the picketing •— or the handbilling took

place o
And you look on the next page in the aerial photograph, and that’s the same area that’s shown right in the
center, the same 18-block area, and you get an idea of the
structure that’s situated on that 18-block area.
0

Is it the block right under the letter C of

Lloyd Center on the map?
MR. NEIL;
0

It’s right under the word —

The letter C.

MR. NEIL:

The letter N — are you talking about the

28
map on page 115* Your Honor?
Q

Yea, 115o

MR. NEIL:

Yes* it5s bounded by Halsey Street on

the north* Multnomah on the south* Ninth and Fifteenth Streets
on the east and west.
Q

Now, are Halsey and -- well* the streets bounding

it* Halsey* Multnomah* and the others* are they public streets?
MR. NEIL:
Q

Yes* they are, Your Honor.

And as I say —

So that this is an area completely surrounded

by public streets?
MR. NEIL:
Q

Yes* it is* Your Honor.

This has — this building is surrounded by

public streets?
MR. NEIL:

Yes.

You can see the same 18-folock area on the aerial
photograph on the following page, Exhibit 4* right in the
center portion of the photograph.
The building does have several levels* or at least
more than one level* since the land is sloping somewhat, and
that photograph does not show it.
Exhibit

$

In the following photograph*

on page 11?* if you refer back to the map* that

photograph is looking from the upper righthand corner of the
map toward the lower left-hand corner.

In other words, looking

toward the west side of the City of Portland.

In the background

you can see the main downtown district on the west side of

29
the Willamette Rivar in the photograph»
So the city is bisected by the wilamette River, its
main downtown' business area is on the west side of the river?
this shopping center is situated on the east side of the river,
in

what is another commercial district of the city»
Now, this main part of the shopping center, this

former 10-square block area, is, as the evidence shews, the
portion of the shopping center which gets the main traffic
both in terms of pedestrian traffic, in terms of automobile
parking, and this sort of thing»

There are other portions

of the shopping center, but this is the main portion of it,
where the handbilling took place.
This main portion, as well as some of the other
portions, is made possible by the city vacating and conveying
to Lloyd Corporation about 8.838 acres of former public streets
and sidewalks, and those of course again are shown on the
map, at 115 of the Appendix.

You can see the dotted lines

on that map that indicate the former city streets.
Q

In your view, would it make any different in

this case whether this was all acquired from a private party
or some of it was acquired from the public domain?
MR. NEIL:

.Well, it might make some difference,

Your Honor, because here we have government assisting in
the creation of a private shopping center in a way that
probably wouldn't have been possible to create a shopping center

30

but for the vacation'of the streets.
Q

Well, is that legally and fundamentally

different from a great number of the farms in the United
States that derive from government patents?
MR* NEIL: Wells, in the sense that all title derives'
from the government, no, it is not different.
Q

Was this property simply by deed from the city ,

or was it, some of it taken by eminent domain?
MR. NEIL: The street and sidewalk property the city
conveyed was all city public property, simply ~~ I don’t know if
they had a .deed, they at least vacated it.

The law may

automatically say the adjoining property owner gets the property
in a case of vacation, and they were, of course, the adjoining
property owner on both sides of the street.
Q

And then Lloyd acquired it from the property

owners?
MR. NEIL:

No, they acquired the streets and side™'

walks from the city.
Q

Ho, I*m speaking of the lots, the blocks.

MR. NEIL:

Oh, yes.

The property, the former

private property was indeed acquired from those people.
As I say, this main area is about 8.838 acres of
former streets and sidewalks.

The shopping center has within

it, as Mr. Black mentioned, a skating rink, which is open to
the public, it has a public auditorium, which the evidence shows

31
is sometimes rented out by Lloyd Corporation, and is sometimes
donates to use.
The District Court found below the malls and walkways
within the shopping center are open to the public at all times.
Those malls, the principal malls, run north and south and
east and west, and they are about 50 feet wide, and some of the
photographs in Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 11, and some of the
photographs offered by the other side also in the Appendix,
show these broad malls and walkways within the shopping center.
The interior parking on this main part of the
shopping center affords parking for not less than 1,000
automobiles, about 850,000 square feat, so the record shows.
There is also evidence in the record that additional parking
on Lloyd Center property is available elsewhere in the shopping
center, but in this area about 1,000 cars.
Q

Mr. Neil, where on Exhibit Ho. 3, at page 115,

with relation to that main building, is the parking?

Where

do people park for that area?
MR. NEIL: Well, first of all, Your Honor, they park
throughout this main part.

It’s a multilevel structure.

You

can see some of the parking on the following page, an aerial
photograph.,

That is the upper level parking you can see.

In addition to that, there is also a lower level parking, which

you cannot see or this photograph, that underlies„ so far as
I know, the entire 18-block area, except for the skating r.ink,

32
I think, which goes down into the ground further.

So there

is underground parking under this entire 18-block area,
substantially, in addition- to the parking yon see on the
upper level on Exhibit 4.
Q

Is there any vehicular traffic to and from the

parking area, within the building itself, the part used for
retail merchandising?
MS. l*!EXL:
Q

1 didn't quite understand your question.

Welle the question probably wasn't too clecir.

Within the part of the building that is used for retail
merchandising, where people circulate back and forth from the
stores, is there any vehicular traffic?
MR. NEIL:

I see.

No, in general no, although if

you look at some of the photographs, Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 11,
on page 131, for example? there are two photographs on that
page.

If you look at the bottom photograph, and also the upper

one, you can see that there are pedestrian walkways right
adjacent to parking and vehicle movement areas. This is the
upper level, one of the upper level parking lots, shown in
both of these photographs.
So in some cases you do have sidewalks adjacent to
the parking areas.

And the underground area, you have great,

vast parking lots that probably are not, do not have sidewalks
going through them.
Q

looking at page 136, I see a camper there.

Is

33
that a street or is that a —
MR» NEIL:

No.

The record doesn't ex plain that, but

since I've been there a few times when that kind of thing was
there, I think it's a display, Your Honor, of camping auto­
mobiles.
4

Q

I see.

MR. NEIL:

As one of the questions indicated, the

Lloyd Corporation has permitted a variety of outside
activities to take place, nonprofit activities, on its malls
and walkways of its shopping center.

Some of these involve

great crowds of people, such as football rallies, political
rallies for presidential candidates, various kinds of displays,
musical performances.

There is evidence that they once had a

crowd of 20,000 people there in the shopping center for an
Ella Fitzgerald concert.
Similarly the auditorium is used, aa I mentioned
before, on a nonrental basis with the Lloyd Corporation's
permission by some groups:
Girl Scouts.
groups.

Cancer Society, Campfire Girls,

But it rents it out on a charge basis to other

In any event, there are a large number of outside

people coming,, to the shopping center to use that auditorium
or participate in some activity taking place there.
They have also permitted a number of charitable,
frankly charitable solicitations, which the court below found
were not put on to induce customer motivation but were put

34
on because the Lloyd Canter thought they were worthwhile
charities, such as the Salvation Army, the Volunteers of
America, the American Legion selling Buddy Poppies, and the
like»

Other groups, similarly considering themselves

charities, were refused such permission, such as, the record
shows, the March of Dimes and Radassah.
How, coming to the incident in question, the police
officers are employees of the corporation and they do hold
commissions, a copy of which is in evidence, vesting them with
full police authority.

That comes out of the commission.

X have no doubt that these police officers have the same
authority as a regular policeman does in the City of Portland.
And I also have, 7. think it is clear in the record, that these
policemen, as the District Court found, caused the plaintiffs
to believe that they would be arrested for trespass if they
did not cease and desist from their handbilling and go out to
the exterior public sidewalks, which they did, in order to
j

avoid arrest.
Q

Mr. Neil, if single store owner found someone

inside his store leafleting, whom he felt was trespassing and
called the Portland police to eject him, would you "feel that
brought him within the Logan Valley rule?
MR. NEIL;

No, you8re talking about single store,

inside the business premises, where business is conducted? is
that right?

33

Q

Y&s »

MR, NEIL:

Ho, that's not within the Logan Valley

rule,
Q

How does the presence of police officers here

by itself help your case?
MR, NEILs

I’m not sure it adds anything to my case,

i

except the Court's questions indicated, I guess, what is the
basis for color of law under Section 1983, under which this
ease arose,

And one basis you could answer is the presence of

deputy police officers threatening people with arrest unless
they abandoned what they considered to be their constitutional
right,
That 1 think is the relevance of that evidence,

So they left, to avoid arrest.
leaflets.

They were distributing

The evidence shows no more than five people throughout

this 20 or 25“ac;re main part of the Lloyd Center at different
places, X think two of.them were somewhere near each other, at
the Meier S Prank entrance, which counsel pointed to in the
photograph, the rest of them ware in differant places
throughout this large area.
There is no evidence whatever, in fact the findings
in evidence are to the contrary, of any violence, any distur­
bance, any upset, even the reaction, evidence is very, very
slim.

One lady asked the shopping center manager, "What's

36
going on here?"

And he told her* and she said, "Well, I don't

like those views.”

Another lady told one of the leafletters

to "Drop dead"* and a third lady said, "Stop bothering her."
So that isn't much public reaction, 2 think, for the nature
of the activity that was going on hare.
0

Do you share Mr. Black's response to my inquiry

about littering?
MR. NEIL;
Your Honor.

The evidence shows there was no littering,

Mr. Black's response was that littering is a

concern of the Lloyd Corporation, and they argue in their brief,
of course, that if the rule we contend for is allowed, they
will have Uttering expense, expense to clean up litter.
Well, they also have expense to clean up litter
when there are football rallies, a lot more.

They have expense

to clean up litter if no distribution takes place, public, in
passing through these walkways, obviously are going to drop
soma .candy wrappers.

And I'm not — there is no evidence in

A

this record that shows the cost of cleanup of whatever litter
might result from handbilling is any greater than the cost of
cleaning up candy wrappers and the like that will be dropped
by the public in any event.
Now, I think it important to emphasise, in addition
to what this case is about, what it is not about.

It does

not involve disturbance, upset, picketing, obstruction of the
normal us© of the property, such as was present in Adderly vs*

37
Florida, Cos; vs, Louisiana, or Cameron vs. Johnson.
Q

How much do you rely on the fact that these man,

these security officers held commissions from the city police?
MR. NEILs

It is one basis for showing the color of

law under Section 1933.
Q

Well, suppose they gave them the same uniforms

and just turned in their badges -MR. NEILs

No, I would argue the result should not ba

different.
Q

Then it isn’t very important, is it?

MR. NEILj

I don’t believe it is in this case, Your

Honor, no.
C

They could be plainclothes guards or they could

be uniformed guards, marked "Private Security, Lloyd Center"
or whatever.
MR. NEIL: Well, take Mr. Black’s example, that he
personally kicks them out if he’s the president of the
corporation.

He would do so, undoubtedly, under the trespass

laws of the city or the State.

Now, that seems to me to

invoke this Court’s decision in Dickey vs. S. H. Kresge, a
private party taking use of t he public statutes to enforce his
policies, in this case against First Amendment rights.

I

would think that —
Q

Well, would you say it's State action if —

suppose someone came in, assume that there’s a bank there, and

38
some bank robbers came in to rob the bank? and the bank tellers
took some clubs or guns and resisted the robberyj would yon
say that5s State action?
MR* NEIL:
Q

Self-help, isn't it?

MR. NEIL:
Q

No, I’d say that's self-defense.

Self-help, yes.

Suppose this Lloyd Center has a staff of men

highly trained in "self-help”?
MR. NEIL: Well, 1 could conceive of that happening,
but it seems t© ms —
Q-

It would be very easy, woudln’t it, for them to

• convert if the case were to turn on that kind of a point?
MR. NEILs

Yes, but it seems to me that wherever that

occurs, that party is likely to invoke the trespass laws, too.
He probably isn't —
Q

Well, what if he doesn't invoke any law, he

just grabs them by the scruff of the neck and throws him off,
he doesn’t identify the statute or the common law that he's
acting under, he just says, "This is my property? offI"

How

does that —
MR. NEIL:

Well, 1 suppose he could do that.

If

you’re asking me if that is permissible, does that change -~
Q

No, I’m just asking — I’m trying to find out

how important it is that these men have commissions, that they
have uniforms, or whatever.

39
MR, NEILs
oh.

It is something you could hang your hat

but I don't think it's that important, I agree with you,.

just trying

I have an even broader
Well, I’m not sure what I'd do about it, I’m
to find out where we’re going.

M R , NEIL:

All right.

I have an even broader ground for —Q

We held in the Griffith case, the Glen Echo

Case they were talking about a few minutes ago, that if that
deputised private guard makes the arrest, it’s State action.
MR. NEIL:
Q

1 agree with that, Your Honor.

Yes, but if the same private guards have turned,

his badge and made it — and ejected someone or made a
citizen’s arrest the following week, then would that be State
action?
MR. NEIL:

That might not be State action, but my

next argument would be that that doesn’t necessarily change the
result that should occur in this case.
Q

Well, then, the State action is not an

important factor in your view?
MR. NEIL:

Yes, it is an important factor, but that

isn’t the only thing that may create State action in this case.
For example,
Q

Well, I would suppose that the fact that the

officers were deputized agents of the State would have something

40
to do, perhaps, for purposes of 1983 jurisdiction? but since
there was no arrest here, I would suppose you6re simply relying
on the doctrine of Marsh, vs »Alabama

Logan Valley, that

this complex was government in itself —
MR. NEIL:

Yes, that's what I was about to point

out, that you
Q

in that there is no such thing as trespassing

on public sidewalks?
MR. NEIL:

Right.

That’s exactly the rationale of

Diamond vs. Bland, the California Supreme Court, where they say
once you have found functional equivalency of the private
property in question to the sidewalks of a public business
d istrict, you've answered the State action question right there.
That is the rationale of Diamond vs. Bland.

I think

it's probably a similar kind of rationale of Burton vs,
Wilmington Parking Authority, where you had the lease of
public property to a private authority.
That, in effect, you had a functional equivalent of
the public parking thing being operated now by a private
party.

And ones you’ve reached that, you’ve got State action.
Q

Isn't there this difference, though, that in

Wilmington Parking Authority there was State involvement,
whereas in Logan Valley I take it there really wasn’t any
Stats involvement, it was your notion of equivalency —

MR« NEIL:

Well, the difference, Your Honor, is that

41
the property initially was owned by a public foody in Wilmington
and it was not initially owned, all of it at least, by a public
body in either Logan Valley or this case.
Q

Wellt but do you think if the property had been

conveyed in fee simple in Wilmington, tine same result would
have obtained?
MR. NEIL:

Well,, yea, I think it might have?

for

example, suppose it was impossible to build that type of parking
structure in the Burton case without that happening, for some
reason or another.

That’s what 1 contend is the case here®

You could not build this type of shopping center without
vacating public streets and sidewalks.

There had to be State

aid, State participation by conveying property to the Lloyd
Corporation here in order to permit this kind of shopping
center to be built.
if is more than just granting them a sone change,
or anything of that sort.
Q

Does your Portland Zoning Code require site

plan approval for most major retail construction?
KiRo NEIL: The record doesn’t show that. Your Honor,
but X think, it probably dees.

The record does show that the

ordinance vacating the streets expressly recited that it was
to permit the creation of a general retail business district
by Lloyd Corporation.
1 started to talk about things this case doesn’t

&2

involve*

toother thing that it doesn't involve is, it doesn't

involve regulation, any question, in my opinion, of reasonable
regulation.

It’s a question of whether the Lloyd Corporation

may flatly and completely, totally prohibit free speech or
any kind of free speech that it doesn't approve or it doesn't
like on its own interior malls and walkways when they are,
as the District Court found, the functional equivalents of
public sidewalks in a public business district.
Q

Well, your suggestion introduces a new factor,

when you said free speech which they don't like.

Laying

aside whatever this record shows on other types of things
allowed, suppose they said all political demonstrations are
out, they don't v?ant people for the war, against the war, or
for public housing or against public housing? so that there's
no discrimination.
MR. NEIL:

Does that change the situation?
No, I don't think it does, Your Honor.

I think once —
Q

Well, it doesn't make any difference that

they're excluding things that they don't like, either.
MR. NEIL: Well, I think it does in result, Your
Honor, because one of the things I'm arguing is that if the
rule that Lloyd Corporation seeks is Adopted here, the result
is not just total prohibition, the’result, as the American
Retail Federation amicus brief clearly says, is the right to
choose which speech, which activity, which noncommercial

43
enterprise will take place an these malls and walkways, and
not merely the right to say that none shall.
So, while it isn’t an essential to my position, I
think that it is a result that will occur if my position is
not adopted.
Q

Would you think that Logan Valley just

automatically decides this case?
MR. NEIL: Well ? yes, —
Q

Well, what about — Logan Valley at least said,

noted that the activity was connected with the operations of
the “~
MR. HElLs

Well, 1 agree, just as Mr. Justice

Marshall has expressed the statement, that he is not commenting,
the Court is not. commenting on "unrelated speech”, so —
Q

Was this unrelated speech?

MR. NEIL: Well, I suppose we could get in an argument
about what is related and unrelated.
Q

Well, it isn't related in the sense that the

activity was in Logan Valley?
MR. NEIL;

That's true.

It is not related in the

sense that it has anything particularly to do with any tenant
of the shopping center.

But let’s examine that for a moment.

Suppose we had written on our invitations, or the literature
handed out here, * To the employees of Meier & Franks

Please

join us tonight at the church for a potluck supper and help us

44
express our position of the war in Vietnam".

Is that related

now?
Do the leafletters have it in their power to determine
what is related and unrelated by doing something like that?
Q

IFhen let’s assume that it isn’t related, your

argument certainly covers that, doesn’t it?
MR. NEIL:
Q

Yes,

Lot’s assume it isn't related, then what?

MR. NEIL?

Well, I think that once you get over the

functional equivalents point, that we're then just talking
about reasonable regulations rather than prohibition.

Now,

in
Q

In Marsh y„ Alabama, there were Jehovah's Wit­

nesses, and I don’t know how related that was
MR. NEIL!

— to the business of that company town.

Yes.

Completely unrelated.

Unrelated? the same as in Logan Valley?

MR. NEIL:

Yes.

But notice how much we've jumped, Your Honor, when
we have said functional equivalent.
of premises.

We’ve ruled out all kinds

We've ruled out hotel-apartment lobbies, private

residences, interiors of businesses,- industrial plants for
the most part? we're down to a pretty narrow class of property.
Q

Hardware stores?

45
MR. NEIL:

Hardware stores? interiors of hardware

stores,, at least,
X don’t knew enough about the factual record in the
Central Hardware case to comment on how appropriate or how close
a factual situation that is.
Q

What is the definition of a functional equivalent?

MR. NEIL: All right.

It seams to me — first of all?

we don’t stop at functional equivalent.

Functional equivalent

of a public sidewalk and a public business district.
let’s go back.

First of all? a business district.

Now?
The Lloyd

Center? 2 would say is a business district in the same sense
that the company town in Marsh vs. Alabama was a business
district? or Logan Valley Plasa was a business district.
Secondly? the functional equivalent of a public
sidewalk in such a district.

Clearly these pedestrian malls

and walkways serve the same function of carrying pedestrians
between businesses that a public sidewalk does.

And what’s

more? the activities that took place or. them are much akin
to the activities that might take place on public sidewalks.
Perhaps they’re even greater? because they’re broader and
they can accommodate things like automobile displays? where
the public sidewalk could not.
0

There’s one functional difference with Logan

Valley is that you admit you. had sidewalks all around this
place.

46
MR. NEIL;
Q

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

And you didn't in Legan Valley.

MR. NEIL; That’s true.

In the Logan Valley case,

Q

Well, couldn't you have reached everybody in

that mall?
MR. NEIL;
Q

No — in this case?

Yes.

MR. NEIL;

' •
No, Your Honor, we could not.

A large

number of people, the exact number not shown by the record,
arrive and leave solely by automobile.

But do those automobiles come down the public

street?

Q

Well* could you picket there?

Yes, they do, Your Honor, but if you -~

would be very difficult.

Q

Oh, I agree; it would be less difficult if

you had gone into Lloyd’s store, wouldn't it, it would be
less difficult.
MR. NEIL; Right.
Q

1 don’t think that’s the point.

MR. NEIL; Well, maybe it is.

Because I think it's

so difficult that there actually are hazards to the safety
of a person, if you5re trying to do it, and it’s ineffective,

You're speaking of the skating rink, are

you?
Q

Well, isn't there a swimming pool here too?

MR. NEILs

h skating rink.

Q

Oh, the skating rink, that's right.

girl figure-skating on it, yes.

Is

There’s a

that the functional

MR. NEIL; Well, I don’t think ~~

-* of a public counterpart?

MR. NEIL:
Q

I don’t think so.

What’s the difference?

MR. NEIL;

They charge admission, for one thing, to

this thing.
Q

Well, they do in some public rinks.

MR. NEIL:

Yes.

tod I suppose you'd put it to me,

what if they were to exclude people on the basis of race or
religion or something of that sort? and I might be able to
argue that it was, but I don't think it's crucial to whether
the malls and walkways are functional equivalents of sidewalks.
Q
was driving at.

Well, I'm trying to test what Justice Rehnquist
tod I'll be perfectly candid in saying 1

don’t understand the concept of functional —
MR, NEIL;

Of functional equivalents?

Q

I don’t see any boundaries on it.

Yes.

MR„ NEIL: Well, first of all, I limited it to the
business districts? secondly, I limit it to the functional
equivalent of sidewalks, in the sense that sidewalks, you know,
they're being used to carry pedestrian traffic between
businesses within the business district,

tod I think you’ve

then got the functional equivalent, provided that there are a
couple of other conditions that don't exist, like in Taggart
vs« Wainacker8s, apparently the sidewalk there was so narrow
that any exercise of First Amendment speech or whatever would
have unreasonably interfered with the owner's use of the
property normally.
1 can conceive that in that situation the property
right balance is greater than the right of free speech.
Similarly, if the physical conditions are such that I can
distribute my leaflet to everyone Justice Marshall was talking
about, they're going to be out on the sidewalk and 2 can
distribute to every one of them, then there's no need for me
to go on the' private property to accomplish it.
just as easily on the public sidewalk.

2 can do it

But I think this

record shows that there are a substantial number of people
that are not going to be reached by distributing on the
public sidewalk around the shopping center.
G

But is it conceivable that some people,

customers I'm speaking.of now, would refrain from going to a
place in order fcc avoid having people harass them with
pamphlets and leaflets?
MR. NEIL:

Well, yes, it is conceivable.

It is

also conceivable to me that Lloyd Corporation of the City of
Portland may adopt regulations that prevent people from
handing out leaflets in any manner that harasses people.

50
So that you must do It, if you do it at all, peacefully.

You must —
Q

Well, if you read the recent decisions of

this Court, you will find that the enforcement of such statutes
is not as easy as the writing of them.
MR, NElLs
Q

In what sense?

I don't follow you.

I’m thinking of some of the cases in which we’ve

struck down city ordinances because of the difficulty of
describing the limitations.
MR. NEIL:

Q

That’s true.

I’m speaking now of some holdings in which I’ve

joined, addressing myself to the difficulty which you —
MR. NEIL:
Q

Yes,

moved over rather rapidly.

MR. NEIL: Well, X agree that in First Amendment
cases, even on public sidewalks, that there are difficulties
of regulation.

This Court has had many cases, like Cox vs.

New Hampshire, Schneider vs. State, and all this line of cases
where you've got permits, and the question is, is the permit
valid, or is the statute valid because it’s too broad or too
vague.

And there are difficulties in regulating anything

relating to First Amendment speech and activity.
But we do it in the case of public sidewalks, it
seems to me it can be done in the ease of the functional
equivalents of public sidewalks that happen to be on private

property.
Thank you.
MR.CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Very well, your time is

up.
'lour time has been consumed, Mr. Black.
Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at Is58 ofclock, p.ra.f the case was
submitted.]
