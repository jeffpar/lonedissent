The Court will hear

arguments in Ho. 49, Hawaii against Standard Oil Company.
Mr. Blecher, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAXWELL M, BLECHER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BLECHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Court;
The basic issue presented by thisappeal on a writ of
certiorari to th® Ninth Circuit is whether the claim of a State
parens patriae for damages under the antitrust laws presents
a justiciable controversy.
At page 11 of their brief, the respondents assert that
w© are asking the Court, as they dramatically put it, ato
boldly create new law".
And while I suppose most lawyers appearing foc-fv-v.
this august body would like, in some measure, to foa
architect of some new jurisprudential principles

I

respectfully submit to you that it is the respondents, v.
asking you to affirm what we regard to be the emsa-: v. ■
decision of the Ninth Circuit, who in fact ask yen
law by overruling the established law mad® by thin
I submit to th© Court that under two separa
of precedents and analysis, reversal of the Ninth Circuit’s
decision is required.

tod to begin with, the case of this Court in 1945,
in the Stata of Georgia vs. Pennsylvania Railroad, is, 1 submit,
dispositive of th© issue frased by this appeal.
In that css® th© Court dealt with precisely the same
question laid before it here.

Namely, whether a judiciable

controversy existed by th® claim of the state of Georgia for
both damage® and injunctive relief alleged parens patriae,
based on violations of the antitrust laws in the railroad
industry *
While this Court, in holding that such

&

justiciable

controversy was presented and permitting the State of Georgia
to file an original complaint in this Court, ultimately
concluded that its prior holding in Keogh vs. Chicago and
Northwestern Railroad presented an impediment to th© collection
of damages, I respectfully submit and I think it patently
obvious that the interdiction of that defense is completely
unrelated to th© standing question presented by this appwfuU
and is no more relevant than if the claim for damages kI!
have been barred, for example, by th© statute of limitet,i
by relief, by res adjudicate, or by some other substontlv
legal defense.
The Court, in fact, dealt with the earns qu et?-/.-:.
whether or not the claim could be perfected in equity vvr.'jir
Section 16 of the Clayton Act, which the Court recall interdicts
private parties from securing injunctive relief on subject

5
matters which ar® under the jurisdiction# regulatory jurisdic­
tion of the Interstate Commerce Commission.

In that css® the

Court went on to hold that Section 16 did not interdict Georgia's
claim parens patriae for equitable relief.
But th© basic holding remains unimpaired.

The

district court found that the Georgia case was dispositive# and
that this Court had rifled in Georgia that a justiciable
controversy is presented by reason of a Section 4 claim for
damages parens patriae under -th© antitrust laws brought by a
State*
I respectfully submit that the underpinning of Georgia,
is the recognition by this Court that Section 4 of the Clayton
Act# which permits treble damages# and Section 16 of the
Clayton Act# which permits equitable relief# are co-extensivs.
A concept expressly articulated later by this Court in its
first decision in aenitfc vs„ Haaeltine in 1969# which recognised
the fact that the two statutes afford different remedies '•.•••;
the invasion of a property right.

Section 4 permits damage

and Section 16 permits injunctive relief against threats.ad
future injury.
In the Georgia case, it. must be clear# therefore.
that the Court made a value judgment and said that th® irs threat
of a State in the protection of its general economy against
invasion constituted a property right capable of protection#
«ad capable of redress under the antitrust laws.

6
So we say to yew, as we said to the district judge,
that where conduct violative of the antitrust laws affects the
general welfare of the State, where there is an alleged pricefixing conspiracy which, on the record before us, we must
accept as factually supported? where there is a pervasive
price-fixing conspiracy, affecting a large number of consumers,
■that this kind of .controversy which affects the general welfare
arid economy of the State rises above the question of local
privata rights, and involves a matter of State interest such
that it raises a property interest under Section 4 of the
Clayton Act, or Section 16 of the Clayton Act, which is
protected parang patria® by an action by the State.
How, w® submit her® that it is unnecessary to re­
examine the rational® of the Georgia vs. Pennsylvania Railroad
analysis.
We contend that the majority opinion of Mr. ^rustics
Douglas and the dissent of Mr, Justice Stone adequately exhaust
the merits ©f the respective positions which could be
»

articulated in respect ©f whether or not a State parens wtfcgjm
can stake a claim for damages under the antitrust laws, where
there has been an extensiva injury to the cons timers of fcb:
State by reason of a pervasive antitrust violation.
We ask only that the Court hare reverse

the

ax:::ox

the Ninth Circuit in holding that the Georgia case did not
dispose of the present claim in the district court*

And in

of

7
saying that, we urge upon you that what respondents who are
her© before you are in effect suggesting is that you repeal the
decision in Georgia, which has remained unimpaired for more
than 25 years.
I further respectfully submit to you that even absent
a decision in Georgia vs. Pennsylvania Railroad, this Court, on
the basis of prior precedent, would not be charging any new
jurisprudential ground were it to affirm the holding of the
district court and reverse the Ninth Circuit.
Recalling the case of J. I. Casts Company

y&,

Borafo*

this Court said that it is the duty of the court to provide
such remedies as are necessary to make effective a congressional
purpose, and that where legal rights have been invaded and a
federal statute provides for a general right to sue for such
invasion, federal courts may use any available remedy fco make
good the wrong done.
Recently, in this year, the Court again, in the
case of Bivens vs., Narcotics Agents, citing the Borah case,
concluded that it was the responsibility of the federal
judiciary to create a remedy to right a wrong where an Act of
Congress interdicted specific unlawful conduct.
Now, how do those decisions apply even absent the
Georgia precedent to this particular case?

2 would respect­

fully submit that they ought to be predicated against this
Court * s statement in Hanover Shoe vs. United Shoe Machinery,

8
that the high purpose of antitrust enforcement is best served
by permitting private treble damage actions as an effective
deterrent to violations of the law.

tod# as this Court

recognised in Hanover# that any holding which permits a group
of antitrust violators to retain the fruits of their illegal
conduct because no effective suit could be brought against
them,
toy such holding# I suggest respectfully# must -under”
mine effective lav; enforcement through treble damage litigation.
So if we take the principles of Borak # as reaffirmed
earlier this year in the Bivens case# against the background of
the judicial and legislative purpose to be served foy treble
damage litigation# I respectfully submit that that series of
precedents would require this Court to affirm the district
court.
tod here again we submit to you that it is the
respondents and not the appellants who ask you t© ignore
established precedents in affirming the. Ninth Circuit decision.
I think little need be said with respect to the
subject matter of damages which also formed in part a basis of
the Ninth Circuit's reversal of the district court's decision.
I would respectfully characteris© the holding ©£ th© Ninth
Circuit in that respect as antediluvian, because long ago we
passed the stag® in development of antitrust or any lav? where
wrongdoers are permitted fe© retain the fruits of illegal

9
conduct simply because there is some difficulty or lack of
precision in the measurement, of damages.
In Bigelow ?sB R.ko. in 1946 s, this Court made that
principi® perfectly clear in antitrust law, and it is finally
se@pi.ng down to the level- of the district courts and the
courts of appeal.
The gravamen.of this charge, as presented by the
State in the district, court is that it is entitled, it is
entitled to recover the overcharge by reason ©f the price fix
imposed up©?.', the consumers ©f the state.

And that mathematical

computation is capable, I submit to you, of almost precise
measurement, the first mistake that permeates the court of
appeals® determination that the damages in this case are
simply to© remote and speculative to be measured.
Q

Assume this case was reversed and it was tried

and that there was an award of money damages in favor of the
State of Hawaii, that money would go what, into the general
treasury of the State of Hawaii?
MR. BLECHER:

We have presented the Court, Mr.

Justice Stewart, with alternative views on that.

It's

essentially a matter of indifference to the State ©f Hawaii,
except that the administrative burdens would be substantially
reduced if your hypothetical were correct, that the money
belonged t© the State and, in effect, belonged to the citizens
only because the Stats had it available for uses which would

10
reduce the tax burden of its citizens.
On the other hand, the State is not antithetical to the
notion that it collect the money belonging to the consumers in
th® capacity as trustee and set up the necessary inarch inery
to permit those people who actually want the money to make a
claim against th® Attorney General,
But what vie do say, in response to th© question of
whether or not there are other means aval liable to redress the
wrongs done here, what we d© say is that, th© federal judiciary,
particularly at this stag® in life, ought not to be burdened
by the problems ©£ it administering a fund as is now being
don® in the collection of these cases under th® antitrust
laws.

Case that are presented for appeal, for example, in the

antibiotic litigation, with which this Court and courts of
appeals and district courts have been burdened for three
years, even though they are theoretically settled.
This is a matter, X submit to you, that ought to be
resolved between the state and its government and th© consumers;
ought not- to b© burdened upon th® courts with modus requiremerits and the administration of funds and that sort of thing.
So that the suggestion that's implicit by the
respondents that the class action is really the appropriate
moans of redress in this kind

of esse, and that this is a claim

which the State ought to assert, is, X respectfully suggest,
window dressing.

11
Q

Does th© State of Hawaii have antitrust laws?

MR* BLECHER;

Yes# it does,, Mr. Justice Whit©.

It

has an antitrust law fashioned almost verbatim after the Sherman
Act.
Q

Treble damages?

HR. BLECHER;
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

And is that cause of action

open to the state?

MR. BLECHER: As far as I know, it is open to the
Stata.

I would assume that th© federal precedents by statute

are to apply in Hawaii, and sine© the state is the person for
federal purposes, I assume it must be for State purposes as
well.
Q

And if there's treble damage ~ these treble

damages provisions lean on injury to business or property?
MR. £LECHER:

Yes, I believe it does.

I think it is

patterned almost precisely and verbatim after the Sherman Act.
and applicable portions of the Clayton Act.
Ev®n addressing ourself back to' the question

of

damages, even if the total overcharge were not the gravamen of
the complaint, and even if the State of Hawaii were, for some
reason, not entitled to that, the ninth Circuit, I respectfully
submit, erred when it said that the impact to th© general
economic welfare of the State was not, in this sophisticated
day and age, capable of reasonably precis® computation or
measurement

12
I submit that , today» as w@ pointed out in our brief
in an article in the Columbia Journal of Law and Sociology,
there has been discussion which would permit the quantification
of damages just to the injury to the economy or welfare of the
State,.
tod I also submit, in a more raconfc article, which
we have not had time to cite, by an eminent professor of economics
ha concurs in this solution, that there are ways and methods by
which economic testimony, economic analysis can quantify the
impact to a State on its ©conoray or general we liar© resulting
from a pervasive antitrust price-fixing violation»
Now, I respectfully submit here that there are no
other means that are practicably available for the redress of
this grievance.
And that's illustrated, I submit to yon, by the fact
that in the fourth amended complaint on file, as Count three,
the plaintiff here, the State of Hawaii, had a class action
seeking damages under the antitrust laws as representative of
the consumers of the State ©£ Hawaii as a result of this
*

pervasive overcharge.
It's the respondents who now come before the Court
and tell you that there ar© other and better means available
for the adjudication of this kind ©f controversy, who opposed
the maintenance of that class, successfully, and persuaded
the district judge, as he put it, that the class was

13
unmanageable*

It was this same industry and at least on®

defendant of th© group that stands before you who persuaded
Judge Augalli recently in th© District Court of New Jersey that
a consumer class action involving overcharges in the oil
industry was unmanageable.
And I respectfully submit to you that unless th©
decision in Georgia is reaffirmed and the Ninth- Circuit
reversed and States are permitted to seek th© redress of damages
for pervasive violations to the consumers, these violations
will go unredressed, the violators will be permitted to retain
th© fruits of their conspiracy, and the thrust of antitrust
enforcement substantially diminish.
And for those reasons we respectfully urge you t©
reverse the Ninth circuit's judgment.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? Very well»

Mr. Blecher.

Mr. Kirkham.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS R. KZRKHAM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KIRKHAMs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it plea.se th®

Courts
In view of the remarks of Mr. Blecher, I think it
might be helpful to clarify what is before this court and what
is not.

Ho referred to recovery of th© amounts suffered by the

— damages suffered by the citizens of Hawaii.
In the third amended complaint in this case Hawaii

14
pleaded first fcfoa cause of action for damages, to wit,
business and property, as a proprietor; and second, a cause of
action for damages suffered by its citiaens,
On the authority of an unbroken line of decisions
by this Court, Judge Pence dismissed that count, .. as had the
other judges who had considered it below, except for one,
holding that the State of Hawaii had no standing as parens
patriae to sue and recover for the injurios fco its eifcisens.
Thereupon Hawaii filed a fourth amended complaint,
with a totally different cause of action.

And this time it

asserted as its parens patriae count a claim for damages
sustained by it as distinguished from its citizens, but a
claim in addition to its injury to business and property
provided by Section 4 of the Clayton Act, namely, a claim for
injury to its general economy and prosperity..
Mow, that claim was sustained by Judge Pence on what

vm think is the most extraordinary misreading of the Georgia
case, which I'll com® fco in a moment, and it was appealed on
special appeal fco the Court of Appeals, and the only decision end only question before the Court of Appeals was whether the
fourth amended complaint of Hawaii in this case, asserting a
cause ©f action in addition to its cause of action for damages
fco business and property, for an injury to its general economy
a nd prosperity is a claim that may be recovered under the
Sherman Act

15
W© submit there were four reasons these claims could
not be recovered.
First, because the injury to the general economy and
prosperity of Hawaii is not an injury to its business ©r
property within the meaning of Section 4.
Secondly, because ©van if it could be considered the
business and property of Hawaii, nevertheless, the injury is
so remote, consequential &nd indirect, as to fall clearly outside
the area which the standing cases have held the injured person
must b© within.
Those two dispose of the case, and they were the only
two decided by the court below.
I will mention briefly

But there are two others that

that we think stand as insuperable

obstacles to Hawaii's maintenance of this suit.
The first is
a State must assert in

that the very nature of the right which
order to have a standing to sue parens

patriae as & sovereign, namely, the injury to its citizens as
a whole, to its entire social community, is a type of injury
which cannot be measured by money calculus, and that an
injunction is the only remedy that a court may grant.
And it is the only remedy which this Court has granted
in any of the parens patriae cases before it over the course of
nearly a hundred years»
And, finally, w® contend that in this case, sine© the
gravamen of the complaint is a pric@~fi.ring conspiracy, consumer-

16
oriented as is stated in the Reply Brief of Petitioners, directed
at the consumers in a particular segment of the economy.

That

that is the type of injury on which a State may not sue parens
patriae and that this is determined by the Oklahoma case in
this Court.
Now, let in© return to the points decided by the
court below.
Q

Well, just, t© makes sure I understand your last

point, your position is that the State of Hawaii could not
sue for an injunction in this ease?
MR. KIRKKAM:

No, the State — that is correct,

Either an injunction or for damages.
Now to return to the two points that were decided by
the court below.
In tiie first place, it has been settled of course,
in at least the Northern Securities case, that fcha remedies
provided in the Sherman .Act are the «exclusive remedies for the
enforcement of the Sherman Act, and that the remedies for
damages under the Sherman Act are those provided in the Clayton
Act,
The Clayton Act provides that on® injured by anything
forbidden in the antitrust laws in his business or property
may recover threefold of the damages.

The term "business and

property" has fcaan construed over and over again

by the courts

to have its ordinary meaning as referring to a business venture,

17
and fch© Clayton Act has been construed to apply within that
area In which the Sherman Act applies, which is in its freedom

?
of commerce»

It is., as this Court said in the

an act tailored fee the marketplace.

Maud

case,

And it has never bean

conceived by anyone that an injury such as an injury, an
indescribable, an immeasurable injury, in addition to the
injury t© the State*© business or property, which is not
contested, is an injury to business and property of the STate
within the meaning ©f Section 4.
When Congress amended feha Clayton Act in 1955, to
give th© United States fch© cause of action similar to that
that this Court had held in Georgia ys, Evans that belonged
fc© th© State, and permitted it to sue for an injury to its
business or property.

There is nothing in the reports,

nothing that could possibly indicate that when that right was
givsn fch© United States was being given a right fc© sue in
addition for an injury to its business or propertyr fch© right
fc© sm for some immeasurable harm to its general economy and
prosperity.
We believe that no precedent sustains that. And, as I
say, fch® unusual thing in this case is the misreading by Ida©
court, th® district court, of th© Georgia case, to read that as
reguiring that decision.
Mow, the Georgia case dcasn*t meet this case at all.
in Georgia there were two counts in the bill of complaint by

18
Georgia which war© considered by this Court*

On© was a suit,

account alleging an injury to Georgia as a proprietor»

For

injury to railroads owned by it, its institutions, and so on®
And under that count it prayed for treble damages, under the
Clayton Act,
The other count was the parens patriae count, and
under that count the State prayed for an injunction, and it
also had an unusual money damage statement in there.

It

stated that the injury to the State of Georgia as parens
patriae, m injury to its entire economy, was of such a nature
that it could not be measured by money damages.

But, said

the State of Georgia, that doesn't mean that we have not bean
injured, and therefore wa ask this court to award us 45token
damages" in an amount not to exceed $5 million.
A request in the nature of a request to an inter­
national tribunal to award reparation.
As far ss the decision of this Court indicates, the.
request for token damages in the parens patriae count was not
again mentioned or considered.
But what this court held was;

first, on Georgia1s

proprietary count, which was the only count for treble damages
in. the case, the court could not recover damages because of

the rule of the Keogh case, which dees not permit treble
damages in respect to .'rates approved by the Commission? but
that this did not dispose of the main prayer of the complaint,

19

which was for an injunction.

And the court than want on to

hold that Georgia, as a sovereign, had the right, had a standing
to sue for an injunction against, the conspiracy that underlay
tlie rates that had been fixed and that injured Georgia.
And that's all the Georgia case holds.
And it has always been quit© impossible for me to
understand how Judge Pence could have misread the case.

It

has no bearing whatsoever upon a claim of a State to obtain
treble damages under the Clayton Act for an injury to its
business or prosperity.
That claim wasn't pleadad, it wasn't argued, it
wasn't considered, it couldn't possibly have been in the mind
of the court.
The next ground of decision by the court below, we
think equally compelling»

At least sine© the decision of the

Eastman case in 1910, the courts of this nation have held that
injuries that are remote from the stream of commerce upon
which the conspiracy acts may not be recovered.

It8a the

rule of every circuit, certiorari has been denied in numerous

cases»
The rule has been stated in various ways.

It has

said that the injury must be direct instead of indirect? it's
said that the person who seeks damages must be within the
target area at which the conspiracy was directed.

Under this

principle, employees of corporations who have suffered from a

20
conspiracy, creditors of that corporation# stockholders of
that corporation, royalty holders, lessors have been hale! not
to fa© within the area of direct# which must be proved before
recovery may be had under the Clayton Act»
On the other hand# where the impact of the
conspiracy was intended to fall upon particular suppliers# ©s
in the case of a conspiracy concerned with exclusive dealing#
then not only the competitor or the person who conspired but
his supplier has been held to be sufficiently connected with
ti?.e conspiracy*

And in some cases where the lessor has had

rants teat are computed upon tee receipts of the lessee# who
has been injured by the conspirary# he has been held
sufficiently direct.
But no case has even considered effects of a
conspiracy upon consumers in a particular segment of a State8s
economy upon the entire economy and prosperity of teat State#
which is reacted upon by everything that happens within the
State*
And it seems clear beyond question that it lies
entirely outside of the area of any realm of directness*

It

is far less direct than the charity to whom tee corporation
might have contributed but for the injury? it's far lass direct
than tea injury to the school to whom the son of an employee
might have gone but for the diminution of his earnings occasioned
by the diminution in earnings the corporation occasioned by

21
conspiracy.

It’s simply outside the area.

For these reasons th© court below reversed the
district court? and wa think properly so.

And it is not

necessary to go beyond that in order to sustain that decision.
But there are two principles*, we think? that are
importent? which the State would have to overcome, as we
submit it cannot, if it were to maintain its action in this

cas® *
The first one of these, as 1 mentioned a moment ago,
is the fact that when a State appears parens patria;., it must
assert a right which is as sovereign in its nature as. the
decisions of this Court have held, which affects the welfare
and th© health and the prosperity of th® entire community»
This Court has described it ©3 rights over and
beyond th© State’s properties right®, and all th© rights of
its citizens»
That type of right is the type that Georgia asserts,
and that Hawaii asserts in this case»

it states that th© injury

that has been don® has hindered its economic growth, it has
prevented its manufacturers from growing, it’s the type of
injury that was alleged in th© Georgia case*
But that type of injury is an injury which the State
of Georgia itself said in its bill of complaint in this css®,
.find understandably no, is not measurable by a money calculus.
It simply does not present a case of controversy, it*s not a

23
justiciable issue.

And it certainly is not an issue which,

under any rational system of law, could be tried to a jury.
There is no way.

And t© segregate fix© economy of a State from

the economy of the United States, actually from the standpoint
©f proof, with the models that econometricians have made it
would be easier to measure the effect upon the national
product of the United States than it would be upon a State.
Tha economy of the state is so dependent upon the surrounding

States.
It simply doesn't present a justiciable issue.

And

therefore, tha only relief that could be granted would foe an
injunction against th© wrong that is being directed against
that State.
Now, the final reason is this;

It was articulated

by the dissenting judges in Georgia and the opinion of the Court
that met the views of the dissenting judges makes so very clear
the principle upon which 1 roly.
In Oklahoma

vp.Atchison,

Topeka & Santa Fe, a bill

of complaint was filed in this Court allaging that the railroad
ha,d overcharged the citizens of Oklahoma on rates, and it
alleged that tha industry of Oklahoma, the oil industry, the
building industry, construction industry of Oklahoma, as a young
growing State, was being seriously affected by this overcharge,
and that the overcharge of these rates was adversely affecting
the economy of the State and would, hinder its growth and

23
development .
Charge© which are virtually identical with the charges
that are made in this case, but not with those in Georgia.
This Court dismissed the bill, holding that the gravamen of
the complaint was simply the allocation of injury to individual
citizens of the Stafc©, and each of those citizens had a remedy.
Now, when the Georgia esse came, allegations ‘there
were also mad© that the economy of the state had been hindered,
its growth hindered, and had been seriously and adversely
effected.

But this Court construed, in meeting the allegationes

and the decision in Oklahoma, this Court construed and quite
specifically stated that it construed the allegations in the
Georgia bill to allege a conspiracy directed at Georgia as a
State.

And, further, that the conspiracy there alleged was

to establish discriminatory rates discriminating against
Georgia, geographically, as a State, so as to erect a trsci®
barrier around that State and disadvantage it economically
vis-a-vis the other States ©f the Union.
Now, this extraordinary allegation, of course, was
the type of allegation that was not present in the Oklahoma
case, and it did give Georgia standing, if it could prove those
allegations, for an injunction — not for damages — against
the continuation of that conspiracy.
Q

Do you agree with that?

MR. KIRKHAM:

Yes, I agree with that.

I agree with

24
that.
what are the prerequisites for so injunction?

q

What kind of a — I suppose it’s to prevent irreparable injury?

MR. KIRKHAM:

It would b© to prevent irreparable

injury and on©
Q

Well, what kind of injury would it have been to

Georgia as a State?
MR. KIRKHAM:
Q

Well, the allegation —

Aside from injury fco its economy or its

citizens*
ME* KIRKHAM: Well, there were two types of injuriest
one was the injury that Georgia suffered by the excessive
rates paid by railroads owned by it and by institutions that
it owned

q

l understand that.

MR* KlRKKAMs

— and the other type of injury was

the injury to Georgia as an organised community*
Q

Well, what kind of an injury is that?

ho» would that be manifested?

I mean

What would be,.a symptom of it?

MR. KIRKHAM: A symptom of it?-. It would be very
difficult to prove, Mr. Justice, but Georgia.alleged that its
industries had been hindered, that in the north industry had
grown and in the south it had been retarded.
Of course, when they came fco prove —
0

well, you’d still b@ proving injury to individual

25
industries and citisens.
MR» KIRKHAM:

It would b® — and somehow you would

finally aggravate them.
Q

Or you would just roll it up in a ball and call

it its economy?
MR. KIRKHAM:
Q

Could call it its economy.

And you would agree that the State could get an

injunction on that basis?
MR. KIRKHAM:

Well, I would agree that Georgia —

X would agree that Georgia, and the injunction that this Court
said could be granted in Georgia does not operate as a
precedent for an injunction in this case.
Q

What if you were wrong ©bout that?

MR. KIRKHAM:

Mr. Justice, I can't b® wrong ©bout

that, because —
Q

You mean your fourth point is essential for you

to win hisir®?
MR. KIRKHAM:

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

Ho.

I'm

talking about, the distinction of the Georgia case.
Q

Well, let's assume, than, you are really wrong-

on your fourth point, that the State can get an injunction in
this case because there is some kind of an■inj ury that you want
to prevent irreparable harm to.
MR. KIRKHAM:

It has no bearing on this case.

It

MR. KIRKHAM:

It would be no different from the

relief that it could get.
I would simply say this# that a court in the appro­

As parens patriae it doss not have standing to sue#

The problem of measuring the economy does not coma

until you reach the area of damages *
Q

X understand that»

But ~~

MR» KIRKHAM: The injunction is against the continuance
©f the conspiracy.
Q

But if the State can get an injunction her®, I

assume you're saying that some court would be saying, and if
w® said it we'd foe saying it, that it is an injury to the State
which the injunction must issue to prevent.

And then yon get

down *—
MR. KIRKHAM:

Yes, but X think that would be bad

law.
Q

Well, X understand that.

But let’s assume that

you're wrong.
MR. KIRKHAM:

Very well.

Then it has no effect upon

the result in this case.
Q

Because even though the State is injured as a

State in its econoray, or somehow, it's — yon just can't
measure it, is that it?
MR. KIRKHAM:

That's right.

And the only wrong that

tli® petitioner complains of as injuring that State is the
conspiracy, and the conspiracy, if proved, may b© enjoined.
Q

Of course the court belov; didn't decide it on

‘that basis, —
MR. KIRKHAM:
Q

Mo, BO —

— it is not measurable.

28
MR. KIRKMAMs

It did not reach the point with

respect to parens patriae, didn’t find it necessary to, and,
most respectfully, I submit that it is not necessary to reach
those points.
Mow, if I may say just a word in closing.

I am not.

unmindful of the policy argument that petitioner is urging
before this Court with respect to liberal enforcement of the
antitrust laws.

I think there can be no disagreement with the

fact that the Sherman Act expressed its principles just as
fundamental to our economic life a© the Bill of Rights is fc©
cur civil liberties *
But, m 1 pointed out earliar, it has been held from
the beginning that the remedies under the Sherman Act are
the exclusive remedies for its • enforcement.

Cases like J . I»

Cas® and Bivens and Sullivan, to"which Mr. Blecher referred, are
cases where the Court has, as it always has, supplied from its
arsenal of actions a remedy for any. person who has suffered
from a violation of his rights enacted by statute where the
statute does not provide for a remedy.
But her© the statuto does provide for remedies, and
they have been held over and over to be exclusive.
The other point is, 1 think, that factually — Mr.
Blecher, 7. think, is mistaken.

This Court is familiar with the

statistics that are handed down by the administrative office.
In the last ten years the number of private treble-damage

29
actions filed ©very year in this country has nearly quadrupled.
As of last June, there were over 2,000 antitrust cases pending
in the federal courts of this country.

And as all of us who

are familiar with the nature of those cases know, they are
— many, many are class actions? and the result is that there
are literally millions of plaintiffs before the courts of this
country today in treble damage antitrust actions»
Q

Do you think the federal — the Congress could

give the States standing to sue on behalf of its citizens to
recover treble damages?
MR. KIRKHAMs
g

Yes, I think so.

I mean, there would be a ground of facts ~~

grounds for a case of controversy?
MR.. KIRXHAM:

I think they could probably, that

Congress could give the States a right to sue for damages to
its citizens.

X don't think it's likely that Congress would.

Most unlikely that it would.

?
Judge- Ray ha lf in on© of these cases, has held that
the State can exercise its powers, the ancient powers of the
king, parens patriae, as protector of incompetents, idiots,
and lunatics.

And he has said that any antitrust defendant,

potential defendant, who doss not have a sis® large enough to
make him wish to litigate it as non sui juris, therefor©
incompetent, arid therefore the State can sue.
I think will be appealed.

This decision

30

But the last statement I do wish to emphasise is that
in fact the remedies provided by Congress are providing a
very formidable arsenal for the enforcement of the antitrust

laws»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr* Kirkham.

Mr. Blecher, you have 14 minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAXWELL M. BLECHER, ESQ«,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BLECHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Respondent's suggestion that the Georgia case did not
dispose of this because the claim for damages in the Georgia,
case was solely with respect to Georgia's own railroads.
Its proprietary interest is, I respectfully submit, clearly
refuted by the language of the Court itself.

The majority

opinion holding, as it did, that Georgia may maintain this
suit as parens, patriae acting on behalf of her citizens.
That was the language of the holding, and in making that
holding, the very next phrase is?

"we treat the injury to the

State as proprietor merely as makeweight".
So it seems perfectly clear, when you read the
allegations of the Georgia petition, that they alleged one
total injury to the economy,' to the citizenry of the State.
And in reaching that analysis, X think it perfectly obvious
that a State is for purposes of bringing a parens patriae law­
suit, whether it be injunction or demages, nothing more than

31
the aggregation of its people which, as Mr. Justice White
points out,, when altogether, is called the economy or welfare
of the community.
It's perfectly obvious, it seems to us, that the
Georgia case said that the total controversy rose above the
question of a. mere local or private right, and that Georgia,
acting on behalf of its people, was entitled to litigate the
question of recovery of damages parans patriae in addition to
the claim for injunctive relief.
And, carrying that to its logical extension, if, as
respondents contend, parens patriae doctrine is totally
unnecessary because the sweep of Clayton 16 is sufficiently
broad to permit suits for injunctive relief wholly apart from
the doctrine of parens, patriae, than I respectfully submit the
entire question presented to this Court in Georgia was futile,
a waste of the Court's time to present to it an issue as to
whether a justiciable controversy existed, because the question
litigated in Georgia is whether that ball of wax, that economy,
that general interest of the State constituted a property
right capable of protection by both damage relief and injunctive
• y

relief.
And if there has been an injury, if there has been an
injury to the State that permits it to acquire injunctive
relief, then, as I pointed out in our opening, it seems to me
w©'v© long passed the day where that injury is not susceptible

32

of scan© reasonable monetary estimate for purposes of recovering
damages»

And the starting point has to be the overcharge to

the consumers as a whole.
Now, for these reasons, we think that the Ninth
Circuit's opinion must be reversed.
Let me leave you with this final thought, if I may.
While it's true that there are a large number of antitrust
cases, as Mr. Kirkhem correctly points out, pending in the
district courts, most of them are the result of singular type
litigation following government complaints and indictments.
And the impact on the courts in those cases is going
to b© substantially reduced, I submit, by perrfd feting, instead
of ih© aggregate number of cases, a single case by a State
through,,; generally, an elected or appointed responsible
official, to recover damages for a pervasive price-fixing
agreement.
While fch© respondents have made many technical
legal arguments which are designed to preclude the recovery
by the State in a case such ©s this, they have not answered

the question which I say to you is the singular — of singular
importance, and that is, Mr. Justices, what happens to the
money they have acquired as & result ©f this legal conduct?
If you follow th© path they have charted for you,
»

they retain it in antitrust enforcement and this bill of rights,
to which Mr. KirJcham refers, suffer -enormously.

33
I say the case cries for reversal.
Q

Let me just ask you» if — your theory is that

the injury to the State is separate from that of the consumers?

MR. BLECHER;

I say it is separate — I think, Mr.

Justice Whifc©? that you
y

Well, afc least yon claim an injury to the State?

MR. aLECHER;
Q

Yes.

And that if the State recovered, could any

consumer recover again?
MR. BLECHER?
Q

I think that would -™

I mean for his separate injury.

MR. BLECHER:

1

think that would depend upon the —

a clarification of Georgia, that this Court would be required
to make, consistent with the —
Q

Yes, but what's your answer to it?

Could he or

couldn’t ha?
MR. BLECHER:

I would think that the appropriate

mechanism would be for fch© State to recover 'the money, to keep
it, and assume that the citizens are benefitted by the return
of the money to the state.
Q

And so you would dismiss the citizens5 suit?

MR. BLECHER; Right.
On the other hand, where —•
Q

So it really Is — his damages really are being

recovered by the State?

34
MR, BLECHER:

in on® form or another.

But, recognizing

the problems 'that might be present by the first approach, as 1
suggested to Mr, Justice Stewart, the State is not antithetical
to the view that it recover under what we think is the alternate
parens patriae approach» and that is recover as trustee, with
an obligation imposed upon it to ratum the money to these
people who can present an appropriate claim through the
machinations of Stats or mechanics of State government,
Q

But on either of your approaches, then, what the

state is recovering is money representing damages suffered by
its citizens?
MR. BLECHERs

No, no, I wouldn't say that, Mr. White.

Under the second theory, clearly it recovers the citizens'
money,

Under the first, 1 think that one of the measurements

of the impact upon the economy of the State or upon its
general welfare has to be the total overcharge to the people,
Q

But you would still bar the citizens8 suit?

MR, BLECHER:; Not under the first approach,
Q

Well, I thought you said you would,

MR. BLECHERs
Q

No.

I -- that's a mistake, I ~~

S© you wouldn’t — if the State kept the money

in its own treasury, the citizen should be able to sue for his
own injury?
MR. BLECHERs That is correct, and that's what Judge
Pence held in this case.

That's what the district court judge

35

held,
y

Wellf thank you.

I just wanted to make it clear.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Blechar,

Mr, Kirkham.
