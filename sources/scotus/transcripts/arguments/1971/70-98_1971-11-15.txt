MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? We will hear arguments
next in No. 98, Sanfcofeello against New York.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY IRVING ANOLIK, ESQ.
ON BEHAI,F OF PETITIONER
MR. ANTOLIK:

Mr. Chief Justice, my if. please

the Court 5
This case is here on certiorari, Appellate Division
of the Supreme Court, State of New York, which affirmed a
judgment of the Supreme Court, Bronx County, convicting
Saniobello, the Petitioner, of possession of gambling records
in the second degree as a misdemeanor upon his plea of
guilty.
The issue before this Court is whether or not absent
a promise which admittedly was articulated by an Assistant
District Attorney to refrain from any recommendation with
respect to sentence, Santobello would have pled guilty in the
first place.

We maintain that is the only Issue before this

Court.
At the trial level, the Executive Assistant, Mr.
Rotker, when asked whether or not a promise had been articu­
lated, that is, when he was asked before the sentencing judge,
said that the minutes of the plea did not reveal any such
promise, although he had been personally present at the plea.
Comraendably, Mr. Sullivan, who is Chief of the Appeals Bureau
of that Office, inquired of Assistant District Attorney

4
'

Greenfield* who had been also present at the plea of guilty
with Mr» Rotker* he notified Mr» Sullivan that such a promise
had indeed, been made* and that in the briefs before this
Court* as they ware before the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of New York* there is a confession that the
promise had in fact been made and broken.
We respectfully maintain that had Mr. Rotker, the
Executive Assistant* told Justice Gellinoff, who was the
sentencing judge in this case* that the proraise in fact had
been made* one* Justice Gellinoff probably would have per­
mitted withdrawal of the plea of guilty? or two* certainly
under the American Bar Association standards* the District
Attorney would have bean bound to have assisted the defendant
in withdrawing his plea of guilty.

Instead* the impression

was left with Justice Gellinoff that no such promise had been
made.
The rectification of appeal was small solace to
Santo bell©
Now in the course of the proceedings—
Q

How the promise was that the prosecutor would make

no recommendation as to sentence?
MR. ANOUKi
Q

That is correct* Mr» Justice Stewart.

That was the length and breadth of it?
MR. ANOLXIsThat is correct, and we maintain that

that has a substantial influence* contrary to my illustrious

5
colleague hare, we maintain thao la a substantial influence
upon a sentencing in court»

Xn their briefs they maintain

that judges are. never influenced by recommendations'or lack
of recommendations of prosecutors*
Q
enced

,

But this particular charge said he wasn’t influ­
didn91 it?
MR. ANOLIKs

That is quite true, Mr, Justice

Stewart, he said that? but we maintain that, what he said:
and the consequences of what he did are quite incompatible.
We maintain that in White v. Gaffney, for example, the Tenth
Circuit case which is adverted to# that there too the judge
said he was not the least bit influenced.

Since my colleague

here went dehors the record, so to speak, in saying judges
are never influenced, and incidentally he is my successor
as Chief of the Appeals Bureau, in that office, I think that
1 can ask this Court to take judicial notice of the fact
that judges are frequently influenced by what prosecutors
say, so to say that it was oe minimis or that the judge
merely by articulating that he was not influenced, is of
no

solace because it begs the question.

The issue here is

not whether the sentence was fair? that’s not the issue
at all.

But that seems to be what the Respondent is main­

taining, that the* sentence was fair.

It was the maximum,

permitted under the law, and perhaps it was fair, but that
is not the issue

Q

The issue is that when the prosecutor gives a

promise of a quid pro -quo for a plea of guilty, clue process
requires that he tell the court.
MR. ANOLXKs

That is absolutely correct. Justice

Stewart, and that is our position.
Now in the course of —
Q

What is the remedy for that, then?

Would the

remedy be to send it back or under resentencing in circum­
stances where there was no recommendation? in other words,
the promis® fulfilled?
No, the remedy would he to permit the—

MR. ANOLXH3

Q

Well, why wouldn’t that be delivery of the considera­

tion of promise?
MR. fiNOLIKs

Well, it conceivably could be the
;

delivery or the promise except that now, because of the
notoriety which this case has achieved, we maintain it would be
of no use.

This case is extremely well known now in. Bronx

County.
Q

What’s the reason for the notoriety?

What’s the

reason that the judge cannot be assumed to make a decision
independently?
MR. ANOLXK;

Well, a judge certainly can foe assumed

to make a decision independently.
no

“Justice Gellinoff gave

articulation of a promise at all had taken place. Quite

possibly he might have given a year’s sentence? that is entirely

possible.
that

That is vlat lie said at the time„

However,

is merely speculation.
Q

I thought he wanted to withdraw his plea?
MR. ANOLIK:

He does want to withdraw his plea.

That is exactly what he wants to do, Justice.
Q

Then there would be a trial on the merits.
MR.AKOLIK:

That's correct.

That is the only

remedy we’re seeking here, is the right to withdraw his plea
of guilty and to plead anew.
Q

That doesn’t necessarily mean that is the remedy

that you would get.
MR. ANOLIK:

That 1 realize, but by the same token,

it would be the only fair remedy, because the fact remains
that we are now trying to undo what has been done wrongly.
Q

It’s a question of whether you get specific per­

formance or rescission,
MR. ANOLIEs That’s correct, and we maintain that
where there has been a misrepresentation, even if it was
without malicious intent, and we’re not alleging malicious­
ness here, even if it were without malicious intent, the
only remedy is to permit the withdrawal of the plea of guilty,
Q

That is rescission of the contract,
MR. ANOLIK: In effect# yes.

Q

The Chief Justice was expressing the tentative

view in his question that maybe what you wanted was specific

8
performance of the contract- that the prosecutor would make
no recommendation»
MR» &NOLIK;

and I recognize the possibility of

that interpretation, but we are not asking for that»

We

feel under the circumstances of this case it would be unfair
'because you could not undo the publicity and notoriety that
has taken place in this case»
Q

Would it be acceptable to the reinstatement of the.

dismissed felony counts?
MR. ANOLXKs

Oh, by all means, reinstatement of the

felony counts would certainly follow, and that he would have
to go to trial and face the possibility of a number of years
in jail»

We well recognise that*

I communicated this to the

Petitioner, and he3s willing to take his chances on that.
Mr. Justice Blackmun, there's no question about
that.

He would have to face trial on the original felony

counts.
Q

I wanted to be sure? I didn't get it from your brief.
MR. ANOLIKe I want to make that quite sure that

I am not asking that he be permitted to go to trial on a
misdemeanor.

That would be totally unfair, and I'm not trying

to advocate such a procedure at all, Justice Blackmun.
The prosecutor in his brief, the Respondent’s brief,
indicates that during the course of these proceedings, and
perhaps 1 should take one moment just to give you the

9

chronology of what occurred hero.

The defendant here had

originally been indicted for two felonies involving gambling.
He had made a motion to suppress evidence returnable June 17,
1969.

On June 16, 1969, the day before the return day of

that motion, he interposed a plea of guilty to the misdemeanor
before Justice Marks.

On the 17th, the motion to suppress

evidence was apparently adjourned without any disposition.
A lawyer by the name of Fruchtman represented the defendant
during these times,
Subsequently, I believe it was September or October
1969, a different lawyer by the name of Aronstein was retained
by the Petitioner herein, and he then apparently tried to
revive the quiescent or dormant motion to suppress, and in. the
course of doing that he indicated that this Petitioner was
unaware of certain rights which apparently was an incorrect
statement.

Now, if there had been an issue of credibility

as to whether or not a promise had been made, note if there had
not he'sn a. confess ioW bvt':

-hat a promise had been made and

broken, then, this factor would be significant in judging the
credibility of the Petitioner, and we maintain that bringing
this issue up is irrelevant completely, because it begs the
question here? namely, that whether or not the credibility of
the Petitioner is good or bad as to a collateral issue, the
fact remains that by confession this issue was crystallised,,
namely, that the promise was made and broken.

So to that

****** w$'

winh *» «iatiajttimn that from the brief of

the Respondent *
Ke also maintain that in this ease, the District
Attorney says
he vac innocent,

this defendant has never indicated that
Well, in our brief of course we say he is

co maintaining, bust if we lock at what he was trying to do,
anfi I thinks Kr. Justice Bl&ckmun put his finger on it, here is
a defendant who is asking that ha be put back in status quo
ante, that he be permitted tc withdraw his plea of guilty
and go tc trial on the felonies*

Obviously, if he were guilty

and felt that he would certainly be convicted, X doubt that
he would seek such a remedy, so X think that certainly eirctmvs'tantially and infer&ntially he clearly indicates and has
always indicated that he is innocent# and I think that too is
an irrelevant aspect of this case because the Petitioner has
made no doubt whatsoever as to.what he is seeking here and
no more and no Isas, of coarse.

At the time of the sentencing, and 2 might point
out most respectfully to your Honors that the sentencing
minutes begin at pegs 21-h of the Joint Appendix,

Inadver­

tently it seams that the printer referred to it, continuing
calling it plea.

The sentence begins at 2I~'A of the Joint

Appendix.
ISow at the time of the -sentencing here, which
incidentally came on before a different justice than the justice

11
who accepted the plea of guilty.

Justice Marks» as 1 had

indicated, accepted the plea of guilty.

He had retired at

the end of 1969*. and he then apparently was superseded in the
capacity of sentencing judge, anyway, by Justice Gellinoff.
The District Attorney argues in his brief, and there is no
basis in the record for this incidentally, but he contends
in his brief that Santobello received the functional equiva­
lency of his promise.

Now, I frankly fail to follow that

line of reasoning, and I believe that it is a casuistic
line of reasoning because there was no functional equiva­
lency here.

The Respondent says after all, Justice Gellinoff

said, ipse dir.It that he did not really pay any attention
to the prosecutor.
Now we have to bear in mind that the prosecutor
here, who was the Executive Assistant, 1 think second or
third in command of that office, came in and made an
impassioned plea for the maximum possible sentence under the
law, adverting to matters clearly dehors the record., conceding
in the record that he did not know what the probation report
contained, linking this defendant with organized crime—
whether or not there is such a thing in the probation
report, I don't know, because I haven’t seen it—

Q

Is that all in the appendix?
MR. ANOLXKr Oh, yes,

G

It ends at 21?

Yes,

12
MR, ANOLIKs

Yes# but page 33, 34 and 35, 3’ think

you will find that, Mr, Chief Justice,
1 think that that is very significant because, after
all, we are not just dealing with a simple articulation
of a statement.

Page 30~A, the actual words "arraign” and

“sentence" appear, so 21 and 30*A are just preliminaries,
although it's part of the sentencing minutes, but 30-A begins
the actually meat, so to speak, of the sentencing minutes,
and X would point out, Mr, Chief Justice, that Mr, Rotker
begins at page 32-A# and in the course of that, as I say,
he brings in a number of things which were completely irrele­
vant , and I think the fact that he adverts to organised crime,
adverts to the fact that this man had allegedly—or not
allegedly, but. had previously been convicted of a murder,
which incidentally, as I understand it from knowledge of the
co-defendant in that same case, a fellow by the name of
Joseph Corbo(phonetic), the United States Court of Appeals had
declared that a confession in the Corbo case had been invol­
untarily obtained, and it is my understanding that Sar.tobello
also reaped the benefit of that because were it not for that,
he'd 8till be in jail.

He was apparently given time

and got out after 11 or 12 years of that sentence.

served
So he

had previously been the victim of a coerced confession.
It's true that a plea of guilty may not be an extra-judicial
confession, but it is nonetheless an ultimate confession of

13
guilt, and when the prosecutor says that he was sophisticated;,
he may be correct to the extent that he knew what could happen
to him because he had been victimized as the victim of a
coerced confession, so we maintain that the all too often
function of a prosecutor who perhaps sometimes is carried
away by his seal, of bringing in completely irrelevant
inflammatory and prejudicial matter, to which the haplessdefendant has no right to confront witnesses, can not coma
forward and say, "What’s the basis of these allegations?0
They are just articulated at the time of sentence, which
was dons; here, and to say that a judge can sit by completely
without being affected by that I say is a mental gymnastic
which no judge in the world or very few judges could possibly
perform, and just to paraphrase Judge Hand on that, and we
maintain that is an important factor in this case.
Now in addition to the foregoing, the District
Attorney in arguing further on his conception of functional
equivalency states that we really should look into -the issue
of whether or not this man received a fair sentence, and
with all due respect to the Respondent, I think that
completely misses the point here.

We’re dealing now with a

concept of whether or not the representation of the District
attorney, a public prosecutor, whether or not it is
malicious or innocent, if he makes a representation, does be
have the right to break that representation, if it in fact

14
induced a plea of guilty?
Justice Gellinoff permitted no hearing on this
issue, though

Mr.Aronstein said the trial attorney who

was present at that time, was prepared to come forward and
testify under oath that such a promise was made, and you
must bear in mind, ©no I give the benefit of the doubt to
Executive Assistant Rotker, you must hear in mind that at that
time, Mr. Rotker made no inquiry of anyone as to whether a
promise was, in fact, made.

He merely said that there is

nothing in the plea minutes to indicate it was made.
Wow that, frankly, from an experienced prosecutor is a very
amazing statement, and perhaps this Court should be oriented
to the extent of knowing what goes on at a plea bargaining
session, which perhaps you know far better than myself, but
at a plea bargaining session, unfortunately, there is a cer­
tain charade that is put on, and X don't think that my
colleague would contest this? namely, that outside the presence
of the sentencing judge, the prosecutor and the defense counsel
'get together and perhaps ask each other, well, how can we
resolve this case?

I recognise that this Court has said

that plea bargaining was perfectly proper, and I’m not
condemning it, but the point is.that they decide that this case
can be resolved by offering a plea of guilty to a misdemeanor
which was done in this case.
But no attorney worth his salt, who is experienced

13
in the criminal field,, and Mr.’ Aronstein at that time was a
man of about seventy-five, who had been practicing criminal
law for many, many years—no attorney worth his salt would
accept a plea bargain without at least some conception as
to what, the possible sentence might be.
Now I might say that Justice Marks had a reputation
of being a fairly lenient sentencer.

Justice Gellinoff has

a contrary reputation. The representation was elicited from
Assistant District Attorney Greenfield that he would not in
any way put the judge, so to speak, on a spot? that he would
refrain from making any representation whatsoever or recom­
mendation with respect to sentence, and in that context,
this was communicated to the Petitioner, and that is the
%
reason that ha pled guilty.
Now you may wonder why it was that this was not put
on the record.
record,

For some reason it is almost never put on the

I might point out that in the allocution at the time

of plea—not sentence, now, but .plea—which is at pagas 19
and 20 particularly of the Joint Appendix, for some reason
and perhaps for good reason, the judge, Justice Marks, did
not ask the Petitioner, “Was a promise made to you1?" which
is very unusual in New York, because that is almost always
asked,

in this case it was not asked.

So we may well infer

that even the- judge, perhaps, was aware of the fact that a
promise had been made.

Now, if that were the case, of course

16
it would merely exacerbate the situation# but it is quite
contrary to usual practice not to specifically inquire, of
a defendant who was taking a plea# "Were any promises made
to you?

Were any threats made to you?"

In this case#

neither of those two questions were ever put to Santobello.
The ABA standards# as I have adverted to already,
clearly indicate what the responsibilities of the prosecutor
are.

Those ABA standards, the American Bar Association

standards, were clearly violated.

Again, 1 hasten to add,

your Honors, X am not alleging malicious violation, because
I have no reason to believe that it's malicious, particularly
in view of Mr. Sullivan’s very commendable admission that
‘die promises were made, but I do think the damage has been
done, and the only remedy of course, we would maintain, would
be the remedy of permitting a withdrawal of the plea of
guilty.

Let him go to trial on the felonies, and if he's

convicted of the felonies and serves many years, well, that’s
his problem,,
Q

He has been made well aware of these facts.

This case began with the two felony charges that

he was indicted on?
MR. ANOLIKs That’s correct,
Q

Than as a result of the plea bargain, he pleaded

guilty to one misdemeanor?
MR. ANOLIKs That is correct.
Q

Were the felony indictments dismissed then?

17
MR. MfOLIKt No, they “./ere not.

The procedure that

would be followed when a plea of guilty is permitted to be
withdrawn, is that the felony indictments would automatically
be reinstated.

He would have to go to trial on the felony

indictments. I'm quite sure that my colleague, Mr. Sullivan,
would not for a moment deny that fact.
0

And there would be no double jeopardy?

MR.ANOLIRs There would be no double jeopardy ir
ray opinion, and as a matter of fact, I think that, his bring­
ing this proceeding to a withdrawal of the plea would be a
waiver of such defense.

Certainly I would not be a party

to such a defense.
q

There8s no question, as I get it, that the felony

indictments are still outstanding?
MR. ANOUK:

No question about it, if there should

be a reversal permitting him to re-plead, I don't think
there

'is any question about that.
Q

Looking at page 35 of the Appendix where the sen­

tencing judge said in response to Mr. Aronstein’s calling
attention to the agreement which had not been fulfilled,
he said, *7 am not afc all influenced by what the District
A-

Attorney says.
■ what •
do.

It doesn't make a particle of difference

the District Attorney says he will do or doesn't

X have here”—and thten he goes on reading- apparently

from the presentence report, indicating that this man, as he

18
put it, was a professional criminal, a recidivist, and. that
the only way of halting his criminal activities was to--put him
away.

That's the language that he used,
Q

Now, in -die face of that categorical language,

you insist# as 1 understand it, that the judge would not have
given this same sentence if the District Attorney had been
absolutely silent?
MR, AN0L2CKs

Well, Chief Justice, X would say this.

Perhaps he would have, perhaps he would not have—~I don * t
know.
' Q

Who is the best judge of that, of those available,

who can speak to it?
MR. ANQLXK:
Q

The judge himself, of course.

Now he didn’t have much of a range here to work in,

did he?
MR. ANOUK: Yes, he did.

He could have given him

a suspended sentence, or anything up to a year.
Q

Ifm speaking of the difference in the range where you

have no sentence to one year, or if you had. one year to 20
years, that's the kind of range I'm talking about.
MR, ANOUK; That’s true. Well, 1 think, though,
Chief Justice, that you are addressing yourself to the fair­
ness of the sentence, and we —-

Q

l*m addressing myself to the whole problem.
MR. ANOLXKz Yes, I realise that.

19
Q

I can understand you as an advocate wanting to

compartmentise,
MR. AHOLZKs I Jrn not trying to avoid the question,
believe me.

I fully recognize the problem that you are posing,

Mr, Chief Justice, but it would appear to me that this would
'

go to the very heart of the bargaining process because in
effect it would be establishing the precedent that a prosecu­
tor could violate a promise, and as long as the sentencing
judge says, ''Well, it's true he violated a promise, but I'm
not influenced by it anyway; I'm going to give him this maxi­
mum sentence anyway,5' I think that would go to the very gut
of the plea bargaining process and render it a mockery.
No defendant would feel safe in relying upon the promise of a
prosecutor again, because of the fact he would know that the
prosecutor could deliberately violate it, knowing that if he
were lucky enough to put him before a tough judge, and bear
in mind in this situation, the prosecutor picks the judge.
When a judge retires, the calendar procedure in New York County
and I believe it's the same in Bronx County, is that the
judges are selected by the prosecutor? they are not. auto­
matically picked out of the lot, as are cases in the Southern
District of New York.

So it's quite something when a prose­

cutor can pick out a judge who he knows is tough, and that's
what, happened in this case, so it's quite something to consider,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Mr. Sullivan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL J.r SULLIVAN /• BSQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, SULLIVAN: Mr, Chief .Justice and may it please
the Court:
1 know of course that this tribunal will look in
my briefs for a statement of the legal position I have taken.
As yet, I haven8t heard it articulated.

Perhaps more import”

antly, 1 haven’t really heard much that resembles factually
the case of Santofcello against, New York,

I propose to go

into that specific case.
Now to begin with? counsel has seemed to have some
difficulty in focusing on just what the legal question is
here.

While we are not accused of trying to overreach

in this case, the fact is that this record will demonstrate
we don’t have a prosecutor misconduct case at all.

There is

no proof on this record of any bad faith on our part.

It

has been disclosed to the court that when time permitted,
we became aware of it, we disclosed the true fact here.
Now the legal question that I do 'sea here is one
of reviewing the exercise of judicial discretion? in other
words, the judge at the sentencing level being asked permis­
sion to withdraw the plea, he acts vis-a-vis the situation,
finding out now before he sentences the Petitioner, that
perhaps such a promise has been made,
hopefully, to that in a moment,

Now I’ll come back,

22
There’s more in this record than even the sentencing
judge was aware of.

Of course I am aware of the powers of

this Court to review the record in its entirety, and 2 submit
to your Honors that if you look at this record, one thing
becomes crystal clear- that this whole claim by the Petitioner
can be fairly branded a sham.

The fact of the matter is that

there was never a viable sentence agreement, if we can analo­
gize contract law? in other words, Santobello just never put
any stock in this representation.
came up.

You will recall how it

One Assistant District Attorney told his first

counsel that he, the prosecutor, would remain taciturn at the
time of sentence, Petitioner is given a misdemeanor plea,
»

go ahead into the future, a different assistant is in the
park, and he asks for a maximum sentence, which in this case
was a year.
Mow in support, of my claim that t say the record
demonstrates this, which I think can fairly be called a sham
claim, I call the Court’s attention to several things.
From Santobello * s perspective, he himself of course, with
his prior murder conviction, was no greenhorn in the courts.
He knew that certainly judges control sentences, and there
was no judge privy to any of the promises made here.

1 have

spoken already about the limited scope, and the nature of the
promise itself X think has relevance here, when a man hopes
a prosecutor remains taciturn at the time of sentence, he

22

isn't really opting for much in this situation.

It's more,

I would suggest, an expectancy or hope, than a promise,
and I refer in ray brief to several cases on that score.
Q

Hr. Sullivan, where in the appendix, to the record

can we find the words of this promise, and the circumstances
under which it was made, or does it all rest now just simply
on a concession of view with your colleagues?
MR. SULLIVAN;
division,

The claim was made in the appellate

What happened simply is that the fellow who was

named in the record asked him if he had made this promise,
and ha said yes.
Q

And that's all we have is just your concession?

We don't know when, where or how?
MR. SULLIVAN; No, but I am willing to concede that
the promise was made before the man pleaded.

I know that

to be a. fact, and I think in this area I can certainly make
the concession.
In short, the way I got it, counsel said, "Are
you going to ask for anything at the time of sentencing,"
and the Assistant said, "No, I won't."

That's Assistant A and

then of course B comes into the picture at the actual time
of sentence.
Q
record?

Do we even have that much in writing anywhere in the

23
No Q

It is just your concession before the courts and

here?
MR, SULLIVANs Right,, -mS tee problem there was in a
review of the record, whether we should m ake a concession
or whether the hard balance, at least in our view we
felt the nan had not been overreached and thus proceeded*.
'•that's on 34-a-

of the Appellant's appendix.

Now. while .characterizing the Petitioner here, I
think I may fairly say on this record that he was engaged
in judge shopping here,

But apropos of wha". 1 *r saying here that this

find that the record in the car-u, chat itcvcobello's first
option in this case was to move to suppress the tangible
evidence that had been found on his person,.

Now he prefaced

that several months until Justice Marks who usually is in
New York County was in the Bronx; he timed it.
he takes a plea before Justice Marks,

As it happened,

Now he withdrew

24
the motionr

We never had any claim of innocence which has

a very important hearing under the laws of New York State*,
because if a man makes such a claim, the actual pronouncement
of sentence pretty much is you have to do something about
it, let him vacate, or at least have a hearing.
So now,. I say that*s an indication be picked his
■judge.and it looked like it was going along all right.
The judge ordered a probation report.

Now before Justice

Narks with no preliminaries, no reporter, no preliminaries
Justice Narks gets up and says for the record one line.,
"In view of the probation report* I'm putting this case
over."

X say that's an augury of things to come, that a

justice, armed with a full probation report, now knows the
background and Santobollo knows the background.

In short,

t

there is very little hope even before justice Marks, so
what happens?

A week goes by, we have a change in the

defense lawyers, in comes Santobello the Petitioner with
a battery of motions now, one of which is to withdraw the
plea of guilty.

In it among other things he swears in an

affidavit that he didn't know he had a right to move to
suppress, the fact being he already put in a sworn affidavit
abandoning that claim.
We submit to the Court as evidence of the conduct
of this man, that can be taken as prima ■ facie evidence, of
perjury and more important in this context, the fact that what

was happening here was Santobello the Petitioner was *
trying to dupe the courts in New York State, and this case
really is the other way around.
Q

Trying to do what?
MR. SULLIVAN; Dupe.

So I am suggesting to this

Court and on this record that you may conclude that you have

tage, not at all concerned with a claim of innocence which
is nowhere in this case—-1 hear it now for the first time—
and all he wants to do is walk away.

What's avoiding

What's another mark, against his particular

background?
Q

How much of the sentence if any has he served?
MR. SULLIVAN:

Oh, I think a matter of days he'd

get out on post-bail application, Mr, Chief Justice.
Now again, as I say, it's tangential to the case,
that particular affidavit which is fairly susceptible to
characterisation as perjurious has somehow disappeared from
the files of the New York Supreme Court.

In any event, now,

he reactivates his suppression motion in conjunction with
this effort to withdraw his plea.

Additionally, as I say,

he doesn't trigger the New York law by making a claim of
innocence.

At that time we offered him a hearing, par­

ticularly as we put in our own opposing papers, to challenge
the assertion about lack of knowledge of constitutional rich

Well, no judge could have been much tougher under

this plea of guilty.

He gave him the maximum sentence.

we come again to this probation report which is before the

7. think you’ll find it. rather clear in. the

He starts mouthing some things about prior motions,

about some comment that he didn’t know what had happened,
and there had been a ruling on it, all bogged down in that.
I think the fair characterization of the episode is that this
is a last ditch stand, to stay out of jail.
Now never was there & formal motion. What happened
was this:

the. man was sentenced, Ssntcbello? Counsel Aron-

stein then brought, up the subject of this prior promise!.

27

Events happened very quickly now.

The prosecutor

said something about it not being reflected in the minutes.
The prosecution or the defense,, for that matter, real'ly didn't get an opportunity to dwell on the subject or go
into evidence, because the judge took over? so there was
no opportunity to do any more, even if we wanted to.

What

the judge said, in essence, was promise or not, X wouldn't
be affected because I've got an overriding probation report,
I would have no alternative.
for the maximum.

There was silence, and you asked

There is only one tiling I can do.

There is a quoted portion in the record of the probation
report which is a plea to remove this man from the streets,
and. this court now has the full probation report, and of
course would be in a better position than I to make an analysi
of the propriety Of that decision which, as I see it, is
the question in this case,

Usually this kind of thing comes

up in a collateral post-conviction application.

What happened

here of course is that the sentencing judge was apprised of it
Now there is a Tenth Circuit case that p,r. Anolik.
referred to, in which Kansas went along much the way I have
been speaking, and the Tenth Circuit came into judgment, on
reasoning I have some difficulty coping with.

However,

Kansas’s approach was the matter of exercise of judicial
discretion.

The case involved, however, a light sentence

without hope of parole, and while we’ll never know, the point

28

is that the case was vacated, and the reason isn't clear
They talk in terms of the effectiveness of the promise. I
don't see, really, what difference that would make because
had we gone ahead and remained taciturn and. he. got no benefit
from it hypothetically, then of course he would have gotten
all that he opted for, bargained for, and that's what I say
essentially that's what happened here.

The judge is not privy

to it? he's apprised of what happened.

It was the judge's

position there was nothing else he could do about it.
Now I think the biggest difference between this
case and White and Gaffney and all, is there's no proof of
reliance whatsoever in this case.

As I said before, it has

been suggested here that in reliance upon this assertion,
promise to remain taciturn, that Santobello took the plea.
You don’t find that in the record at all, and if we were even
to assume, this Court may exercise its powers over the fact
that if Santobello were called to hearing—and I don't see
that it would be necessary here--we assume he would testify
that he relied on it—well, whether that is a

fact or not,

you have enough record evidence here, taking a broader view
of the record, to reject that claim.
In constitutional terms of the narrower case, if
you reject that argument, I suggest to your Honors that he
did in fact get what I call the functional equivalency.
Certainly the man's going to promise something, we have to live

jo

up, we wouldn't be here.
Q

Mr. Sullivan, you say on the presentence report,

when we study it, we’ll then know nothing else could be done
but an actual sentence?
MR. SULLIVAN: Right, Mr. Justice Marshall, I say
that —
Q

Well, can I assume that the District Attorney had

the same feeling?
MR. SULLIVAN:
Q

I think he would have gone in—

Why did he take his time arguing?
MR. SULLIVAN: Icn sorry, Mr. Justice?

Q

Why did he make the statement that he had to

make at. the sentencing if he was so sure there was nothing
else that Judge Marks could do but give him the maximum?
He could have mooted this whole thing out, coy.ldn't he?
mr.

SULLIVAN: Mr. Justice Marshall, I think, he could.

He could have stopped, he could have checked it.

I read

this record, and there’s no indication certainly that he knew
what the other fellow had done, you see.
very quick.

As I say, it was

The whole thing is a line or two in the record,

and it’s over„
Q

Well, we can look at this presenfcence report which

I’ve looked at, and you say we’re all aware that there was
nothing else he could do.

I don’t see why you have a presen­

tation at all at the sentencing.

30

MR. SULLIVAN; Mr. Justice Marshall, I don't know
either.

I think myself that that would have

been the case,

but the focusing on what I believe to be the legal question
Q

What you are trying to do is find out what was

in the state’s attorney's mind, what was in the judge’s
mind—
MR. SULLIVAN; It's true this is not the conventional
type record -that comes up, but we are trying, I submit
respectfully, to assess the exercise of discretion by the
sentencing judge.

That's what is reviewable here, and

what I do know by record indications here, I respectfully
submit that the exercise of that discretion cannot be
faulted and in this context that the judge’s going ahead in
this fashion did not deprive the Petitioner of his consti­
tutional rights.
Q

Mr. Sullivan, if this case should go back, do

you share opposing counsel’s assurance that the felony charges
would be reinstated?
MR. SULLIVAN; Mr. Justice Blackman, I feel they
will, yes.
Q]

There's no limitations barrier or double jeopardy

aspect that you know of?
mr.

on that.

SULLIVAN; No, Mr. Justice.

We’ve had cases

That wouldn't be so. May I suggest, Mr. Justice

Blackmun, that you have virtually all you'd ever get in a

31

hearing of any kind presently in the record.

All I can

imagine would be added would be an assertion by Santohello that
he relied upon this representation, and I just can't imagine
what else would corne up because constitutionally speaking, in
my view at least, it makes no difference what the prosecu­
torial intendent was, and I say yes, a promise was not kept
in this case, 7out in this record Santobellc against New
York, one may fairly conclude that that failure to literally
comply, after all they mention it before sentence, would
be an innocuous sort of thing in constitutional terms and the,
harmless error doctrine that we apply elsewhere would have
a bearing here.
for.

In short, Santobellc got what he bargained

There are no guarantees in this kind of situation that

you will stay out of jail.
In sum, then, I. submit nothing in this case vio­
lates the declarations of the Court or anyone’s norms of
ethics respecting what happened to Santohello, and that, this
case can he affirmed.
Thank you.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY IRVING ANOLIK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ANOLIK5 Mr. Chief Justice—
Q

Let me ask you this before you start, Mr, Anolik.

Would you suggest that if this case hypothetically were
remanded for resentencing with fulfillment•of the promise

32
before a different judge, that that new judge could not
approach the matter with an open mind?
HR. ANOLIK: 1 would, say that he could not, for
two reasons.
Q

It doesn't make any difference who he is?
HR. ANOLIK;

Q

Well, as I say, theoretically—

Is that your point?
HR. ANOLIK;

Well, theoretically it is possible,

Chief Justice, but I would say the fact is that the promise
was made and broken, and this defendant relied upon the
promise.

Now under those circumstances, it would establish

a very dangerous precedent to the plea bargaining system;
namely, that a prosecutor-Q

That's something that we are capable of evaluating.
MR. ANOLIK:

Q

Oh, of course.

I'm just asking the direct question, I take it

it's your position, that no matter who the judge is, he can't
fairly sentence this man just on the basis of the record
without any recommendation?
HR. ANOLIK:

I would say it is extremely difficult,

Mr. Chief Justice, because X know of my own experiences
in cases of a great deal of notoriety in New York, you maybe
would have to get some out-of-state judge or something? and
I think that in itself would be almost like a red flag,
bringing in a judge from a different area.

We maintain that

33
the only remedy here is to permit him to withdraw his plea
and re«plead»
We also question whether or not the prosecutor
here,if he wanted to be fair, once he found out this was
coming to< court, as the American Bar Association Standard
4.3 requires, enjoin in a motion to permit him to withdraw?
And indeed the fact is that a motion to suppress if made
is given great import.

Under New York Law, 813 c of the

Code of Court Procedure, a motion to suppress may be made
consistently with the plea of guilty.

It survives the plea

of guilty, and in fact many times that is trie way that a
motion to sujjpress is crystallised, so there's nothing
inconsistent whatsoever in having made a motion to suppress.
Q

What would the maximum sentence be if your client

were found guilty or pleaded guilty to the two oricrinal
felonies?
MR. ANOLIK:

Well, consecutive or concurrent

punishment?
Q

Maximum.
MR. ANOLIK: I believe it would be eight years alto­

gether.

It would he eight years, so it would be the theoreti­

cal maximum.
Q

Four on each count?
MR. ANOLIK;

Yes, and I thinb that certainly if he

were completely guilty, he'd he out of his mind to be seeding

34
the relief which he has directed me to seek,- so I think he
was well aware of the exposure he has here, 4nd nonetheless
he has asked me to bring this petition on for him on
appellate counsel*, as you can appreciate, and we urgently ask
this be done because of the fairness in this case and because
of the damage it would do to the entire plea bargaining
process, if this is permitted to stand, and we think it3?;
the only fair thing to do under the circumstances, particu­
larly in view of the commendable admission that the promise
was made and broken.
At page 34«a by the way, of the record, the
attorney specifically said, now if what Mr. Pruchtman—who
is the trial lawer—says is true, then the plea was obtained
by fraud and deception by the District Attorney, if it was
obtained on the express promise that the District Attorney
would make no recommendations.

It is right in the record,

Mr. Justice Stewart, the fact that it was called to the
attention of the court.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Anolik.

Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:11 o'clock, p.m. the case was submitted.)
