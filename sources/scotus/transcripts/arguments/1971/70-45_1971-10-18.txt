MR,, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

in Ho. 45, the United States against Brewster.
Excuse as®, Mr. Solicitor General, fch® orders have
been duly filed and certified, as you know, and will not
otherwise b© announced.
Mr, Solicitor General, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR, GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a direct appeal from a decision of the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia,
which has held that an' Act of Congress, generally applicable
‘throughout the United States, is unconstitutional ao applied
to the offense charged in the criminal indictment before it.
The offense, to put it simply, is bribery? and the
defendant against whom the charge is made was a United State®
•Senator at th© time charged, is now a former United States
Senator.
The facts are simple.

There is virtually nothing

before the Court except tli® indictment found by the Grand
Jury, and a motion to dismiss fch® indictment, which was
granted.
The indictment contains a number of counts.

The odd-

4
numbered comits relate to the defendant, the alleged bribe©.
The even-numbered counts relate to the parties who are charged
with having offered ©r given the bribes, the bribers.
tod the underlying facts appear on page 1 of the
Appendix, as alleged in the indictment, that at all times
Daniel Brewster was a public official of the United States, a
member of the Senate of the United States from the State of
Maryland,
Then the gist of the charge appears on page 2 of
the Appendix with respect to count 1 — end x repeat, the
odd-numbered counts relate to Senator Brewster and are all
essentially the cam©, as far as the issue now before the Court
is concerned.

And th© charge is that he corruptly asked,

solicited, sought, accepted, received, and agreed to receive
the sura of $5,000 for himself and foreign entity, that is the
D. c. .Committe® for Maryland Education, from Cyrus T, Anderson
and Spiegel, Xnc:., in return for being influenced in his
performance of official acts in respect of his action, vote,
and decision on postage rat® legislation, which might at any
time be pending before him in his official capacity.
Mow, the motion which was filed on behalf of the
defendant appears on pag© 3 of the Appendix,

There is ©loo

another motion on' pngs 9 which relates to vagueness and things
of fchnfc sort, which was not dealt with in any way by the
District Court, and an appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act

5

brings to this Court only th@ issue which was dealt with —
excuse me# this is not the Criminal Appeals Act, this is the
ike».-, allowing direct appeals in cases where an Act of Congress*
h©£: boon held unconstitutional*

And such an appeal brings her©

only the issue which was decided below»
In© motion to dismiss# on page 8 of the App@ncli.3Cj
feh® defendant moves to dismiss the odd-numbered counts# and
fch© ground is that counts 1, 3# 5# and

1

of the indictment

charge this defendant with violations of 18
cizUi

u.S.c. 201(c) CD#

in each such count this defendant is charged with being

influenced in Ms performance ©f official sets in hi®
capacity as a United States Senator.
And there is# of course# not the slightest doubt
that that is what the indictment charges?

that he was

inrlu&nced in his official act in his capacity as a United
Statas Senator.

Appeals Act.

This is an appeal under the Criminal

It-might possibly have been brought under the

ocher ®tatut©# but it is an appeal under the Criminal Appeals
aC^«

statute involved is the former form of Section 3731

of Title 18, known as the Criminal Appeals Act..
Th© amendment to this prevision # which was enacted
las-© January# i.s not applicable# since the ca«e was begun by

6
indictment on December 1, IS69, more than a year before the
enactment of the amendment„
The relevant provisions of the Criminal Appeals Act
are quoted on peg© 5 of the Appellee9$ Motion t© Dismiss or
Affirm, and on page 9 of feh© Appellee8® Brief, and to refresh
the Court * s recollection I will read the two provisions
involved, which ar®, at least verbally, relatively simpla.
Appeal lies to tills Court under that statutes .
"From a decision or judgment setting aside, or
dismissing any indictment or information, or any count thereof,
where such decision or judgment is based upon the invalidity
or construction of the statute upon which the indictment or
information is founded«11
And the other statute relating.to appeals on acts?,
decisions holding Acte of Congress unconstitutional, is not
applicable, because it applies only to civil cases, and this
is a criminal ease.
And the second head of jurisdiction, under the old
Criminal Appeals Act, iss
“From the decision or judgment sustaining a motion
in bar, when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy."
And we contend that there is jurisdiction under this
case under either or both of those two provisions of the former
Criminal Appeal© Act.
In the first place., it's entirely clear that the

7
defendant, has not bean put in jeopardy.

Mo jury was empaneled,

nor was the case in any way submitted to the judge as a trier
of the facts, with the judge sitting in place of a jury.
There was simply the indictment and a motion to
dismiss.

The traditional way to raise © legal question with

respect to a criminal indictment.

And thus the case comes

within the language of Justice Harlan in the Sisson case,
where, in distinguishing this Court’s decision in United States
v. Covington, Justice Harlan noted that the dismissal in
Covington was "before trial, without, any evidentiary hearing."
And that is printed in italics in the report itself.
That, of course, is exactly the situation here.
This was before trial and without any evidentiary hearing.
And, similarly, the situation comes clearly within
the language need in the Court’s opinion in the Jorn caselast term, where it was said -that in enacting the Criminal
Appeals Act, Congress wished "to avoid subjecting the defendant
to a second trial where -the first trial had terminated in a
manner favorable

defendant, ©it

because of a jury •

verdict or because of judicial action.*
Here there'has never been a first trial.

There has

been a motion to dismiss, entirely on the face of the pleadings.
There has been a decision on that motion to dismiss, but that is
not in the sense of the Criminal Appeals Act, or of the sense
of double jeopardy, & trial.

e
In this case there was no stipulation of facts of any
sort»

There was nothing that could even be regarded as a bill

of particulars or anything like that.

There were no conces­

sions by the government of any sort, nor any factual assertions
by the government beyond what is stated in the indictment.
The entire proceedings before Judge Hart are printed
in the Appendix.

I believe that what I' have said with respect

to them is fully supported by the record.
There is nothing in it to support a contention that
Judge Hart made5, any sort of a factual determination or
adjudication.

What he decided is that on the facts allaged in

the indictment the statute cannot be constitutionally applied.
Mr. Ramsey quite properly points to language which
was used by Judge Hart in expressing his opinion, and this
appears on page 33 of the Appendix, and Judge Hart did say,
right at the middle of the page:

"Gentlemen, based on the

facta of this case" — which sounds bad from rav point of view
■— "it is admitted by the government" — which sounds bad from
my point of view — "that the five counts of the indictment
which charge Senator Brewster relate to the acceptance of
bribes in connection with performance of a>. legislative function
by a Senator of the United states."
From an examination of the transcript, it is
readily apparent that tbs facts to which Judge Hart was referring
were those stated in the indictment, not anything that was

9

conceded by the government or asserted by the government or
offered by way of affidavit* deposition* in any other way in
■terms of facts above and beyond the facts alleged in the
indictment* and it is also clear that nothing was admitted in
a factual sense by counsel for the government before Judge

Hart.
Insofar as counsel admitted «anything there, it was
that the facts charged an the indictment are those which are
there alleged; namely, that the defendant was at ©11 relevant
times a United states Senator, and that ho is charged with
seeking and receiving a bribe under the circumstances as stated
in the indictment.
Thus there is clearly a case in which the court
below has held that an Act of Congress is unconstitutional as
applied to the facts alleged in this indictment.

And this

seems to com® squarely within this Court's decision in the
Knox case, in 396 U.S., which upheld the jurisdiction of this
7

Court under the Criminal Appeals Act,where the statute had
been held unconstitutional as applied to the facts ;alleged in
the indictment, although not generally unconstitutional.
It is also our view that there is jurisdiction under
the other clause ©f Section 3731, the one relating to a motion
in bar.

Now, we contend that the assertion made in the motion

to dismiss in this case, namely, that this defendant is charged
with being influenced in his performance of official acts in

10
his capacity as a United Statas Sanator, and that th© indictment
for this reason violates the provision of Article I, Section 6
of the United States Constitution, is a motion in bar.
Sometimes a motion in bar is referred to as a
confession, and avoidance,

tod Mr. Ramsey has said that the

defendant has not confessed.

I think, though, that the problem

comes from too broad a use ©f the word "confession".

when a

person raises the statute of limitations, or a pardon, this is
clearly within th© motion in bar provision.

Yet in such a

case the defendant, need not confess, he says, in effect,
"whether I did it or not, or even if I did do it, you cannot
prosecute me because of the statute of limitations, or of the
pardon, as the case may be.
tod this is exactly what Senator Brewster's counsel
has said here;

"whether I did it or not, or even if I did do

if, you cannot prosecute rm because of the speech or debate
clauseo"

This seems to m® to be whet is meant by motion ip

bar, as used in this statute, or by the term "special plea in
bar53, which was used in its original form.
It is, for example, the kind of motion that would
have been mad© by a Member of the House of Commons in the
18th Century if there were a charge against him which h© alleged
case within parliamentary privilege.
What th© defendant is saying is that "even if I
admitted all of the facts, I have a special defense"; that, I

11

suggest;# is a motion in bar and brings this case within the
j urisdietional statute.
Now, let ins turn to the merits of the case, which is,
of course, @ natural sequel to the Court's decision in the
Johnson case, in 383 U.S.» decided a little over five years
ago.
Understandably enough, the appellee relies on th©
Johnson decision, and it is incumbent on me to show that the
facts there make that case distinguishable from those which
are alleged in this indictment.

And I repeat, we have nothing

here except the facts alleged in the indictment,

it is

perfectly possible, it seems to me, for this trial to be
conducted under this indictment in a way which might infringe
the Johnson case, and if that were done there would be another
issue.
But that isn't the problem here.

The problem here

is whether the trial can b® conducted in such a way as not to
infringe th© Johnson case, and I submit that it can.
Q

Th© Johnson case came her® after a conviction,

didn't it?
MR. GRISWOLDi

The Johnson case cam© hare after a

verdict of. guilty by a jury in a full trial.
Q

And a full transcript of the evidence?

MR. GRISWOLDs

A. full transcript of the evidence.

Reversal by the Court of Appeals, and that, reversal was upheld

12
by this Courto
And, indeed,, with the benefit of hindsight» it seems
apparent that the Johnnon case was an unfortunate one to bring
here» from the government5s point of view»
In the first place, th© charge there, the issue there
related to a charge under th© conspiracy statute, which is,
I suppose, th® most general of all criminal statutes, the one
most subject t© undue extension by wide-ranging prosecutors.
In the second place, th© prosecution of Congressman
Johnson largely turned on a speech which he had made on the
Floor of Congress — that is, the prosecution with respect to
this; there v?as also another corat about conflict of interest,
which related fco his appearances in th® Department of Justice.
But the conspiracy charge related to a speech he had made on
th© Floor of Congress relating to building and loan associa­
tions,

Although the record was a long one and had many things

in it, 50 pages of th© transcript related to th© speech in the
ft''

/

case presented by th© government,

And there was much snore

about the speech in th© presentation of the defense.
Th© government indeed introduced a copy of the
speech in evidence.

The conspiracy charge was that th© speech

was not mad® for any legislative purpose, but was mad© by
Congressman Johnson for a fee in order that it might be
reprinted and distributed to prospective depositors, so as fco
encourage them to make deposits in Maryland Savings and loan

13
associations«
It is also relevant, I think, that the indictment
contained a substantial allegation about the speech, and this
was reproduced, in this Court’s opinion at page 184, paragraph
15; I read from the opinion;
"It wes a part of said conspiracy that the said
Thomas F. Johnson should render services for compensation, to
wit;

the making of the speech defending the operations of

Maryland’s independent savings and loan associations, the
financial stability and solvency thereof, and fcha reliability
and integrity of the commercial insurance on investments mad©
by said independent savings and loan associations on the
Floor of the House of Representatives."
Thus, that was a central part of the actual charge
in that case.
It should be observed, too, that the Court's
opinion is narrowly guarded, on page 184 of the•opinion Justice
Harlan said, near the top of the page:

"Whatever room the

Constitution may allow for such factors in the context of a
different kind of prosecution", and here wo clearly have a
different kind of prosecution.
hnti then on page 135 Justice Harlan said, “We

emphasis© that our holding is limited to prosecutions involving
circumstances such as those presented in the case before us,"
which involved extensive utilisation ss a central factor in the

14
prosecution of the making of & speech«
And the Court said* "we expressly leave open for
consideration# when the case arises# a prosecution which#
though possibly entailing inquiry into legislative acts or
motivations# is founded on a narrowly drawn statute passed by
Congress in the exercise of its legislative power to regulate
the conduct of its Members."
Q

Are you suggesting# Mr. Solicitor General# that

if the form of statute we have here had been the form of
statutes involved in the .Johnson case the result might have been
the other way around?
MR. GRISWOLDj

Mr. Justice Brennan# I think very

likely not# because of the extensive use of the speech.

It's

a little hard for ms to answer it# because the very fact that
it was a conspiracy charge# and that you than had to allege
extensive activities to support the conspiracy, is part of what
brought up the problem.

And I would agree that if this case

went to trial and wa ended up with © record like that in the
Johnson case, that wa might well have a very serious problem.
And it will not be my responsibility to try the case —
Q

Suppose we. had had a provision of this vary

statute that .we're dealing with now# another section# which
had said it was .a criminal offense to accept a bribe for making
a speech on the Floor of the House.
precise section that we dealt with.

Suppose that were the

15
MR,, GRISWOLDt

Mr» Justices, 1 would be prepared to

defend that under the Johnson decision, it is a more difficult
ces© than we have here,

though not © great deal mors difficult

because* this one refers to vote.
Q

And the government seems to squat® speaking and

voting in terms of the reach of the clause*
MR* GRISWOLD:

Wo, Mr. Justice, I think the Court

has at times equated speeches —
Q

Yes, but you raak© no argument that the speech

and debate clause does not reach voting.
MR* GRISWOLD:
Q

Mr. Justice, I —

You seam to concede it.

MR. GRISWOLD:
in all its impact.

— am not quite willing to accept that

After all, the speech and debate clausa

refers only to speech and debate,
Q

And —

So you're just not arguing it here?

MR. GRISWOLD:

I'm just not arguing it.

5
I recognise

that it's very closely related, but some of the talk, to the
effect that some of the references in tha ©pinions, to the
effect that it applies to votes as well, seems to me to be an
example of that well-known circumstance that we are always
dealing with, of fch® tendency of principals to expand them­
selves to the limit of their logic.

And all that I need say

her© is that the Johnson case, involving extensive use of the
speech, which is precisely what the Constitution refers to,

16
speech or debate,,
For example, there are other extensions of the speech
or debate clausa made so fer in Mr. Ramsey'© brief that it
applies to any activity conducted.by a Senator or a Congressman
in connection with his legislative work.

And 1 think that is

far too extensive.
Now, I agree that the line between vote and speech
is pretty small,, but the Constitution refers only to speech.
And X think that language in the opinion in the Johnson case,
to which X have just referred, indicates that if there is
reference to a vote but it is incidental, tangential, is not
the essence of the charge that the constitutional provision does
not cr).5l<© it impossible for Congress to allocate the determina­
tion of tire factual matters involved with respect to briber^
of & Congressman or Senator to tire courts.
Q

Does the conjunction of the terms "speech and

debate" in the Constitution indicate that it is speeches in
the Congress on the Floor and debates in the Congress on the
Floor that, is being talked about, or is it broader than that?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, it is speech or

debate, rather than speech and debate.
Q

Speech or debate, yes.

MR. GRISWOLDs

X don't think that,in this context,
i

makes any difference.

X would suppose that if they had wanted

to say vote, they *— it might have occurred to somebody, for

17
any "speech, debate or vote® in either House»

Vote is

expressly left out»
If the Court feels that the speech or debat© clause
m alces it impossible for Congress to make it a crime for a
Congressman to accept a bribe, then this appeal must fail»
2 do not 'think that the Johnson case decided that.

I do not

think that the speech ©r debate clause requires that conclusion.
I think that the Johnson case itself expressly left this
question open, and indicated that under a properly drawn
statute the mere fact that there was some reference to a vote
was not fatal»
Q

Well, may I ha clear about this, Mr. Solicitors

you are not, however, contending that the speech and debate
clausa protects only spsach, are you?
MR. GRISWOLDs
Justice.

I'm walking right up to that, Mr.

I agree that th® Court has said, several times, in

somewhat sweeping ways, that it goes beyond speech or debate.
However, as I read the Constitution, what th© Constitution says
r’

is speech or debate; and I still find some difficulty ia
seeing how it is appropriate to construe it to apply to other
things than speech or debate, and 1 know of no case where th©
Court has so decided *
Q

Well, what’s troubling me, of course, is what’s

in your footnote at the bottom ©f page 11, where you say,
"Whatever th© precise limits of Johnson, we do- not contend59 —

18
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

Well —

”that the claws© protects only speech.”

MR. GRISWOLDs

— X recall that, and it is there,

and I am not contending that it is limited to speech or to
lit@raJ.ly to speech? 2 am perfectly aware of the fact that
words have to be construed in a broader significance.

But

what I am trying to maintain is that -the mere fact that there
la a reference in this indictment t© a vote doss not mean that
the statute is unconstitutional a© applied to this, the charge
in this indictment; and I am suggesting that the Court has
never so decided.
Q

Would you think that speech or debate reached

speaking and utterance in a committee hearing?
MR. GRISWOLDi

Well, I would think not, myself.

—■ well, let me modify that.

But

I think, of course, that a

Congressman or Senator should be protected against suits for
libel from things said in committee h@ar.lng.

But the

constitutional provision is for any speech ©r debate in either
house.
We don’t have that issue her,©.

I repeat, 1 think

that some of the language in some of the cases has been very
broad, and that there are no decisions on such matters, even
with, respect to what is said in committee hearings.

But it

ia not -- there is nothing about a committee hearing in this
case? it's not necessary to decide that.

19
Xed like, in the brief time remaining, to refer to
the legislative history of this statute, because, as it now
stands, it is in somewhat broad language.

This is the statute

which is quoted on pages 2 and 3 of our brief»

It refers to

public official who does these things, and then public official
is defined to include a Member of Congress.
This is not brought out in our brief, and I would
like an opportunity, very briefly, to present its
The history of tha statutory provision is that in
1853 Congress enacted a statute which was specifically applic­
able to Members of Congress who take bribes, and who take
bribes with intent to influence his vote or decision on any
question.

From 1853 on, Congress has specifically provided

that it was a crime for a Congressman or Senator to take a
bribe intended to influence his vote.
That was continued in the Revised Statutas of 1874,
and 1878»

It was continued in the Criminal Cod© of 1908»

And it was in effect in 1962, when Congress passed the present
statute»
But it is entirely clear that in enacting th®
present statute th® motivation to consolidate a lot of
separate bribery provisions dealing with public officials
generally cam® from Congress and not from the Executive.
There was a report by a staff of subcommittee No. 5 of th®
Committee on Judiciary of the House of Representatives in 1958,

20

which recommended the consolidation of these provisions.
page 71 of that report:

At

It is recommended that the provisions

prohibiting the bribery of federal employees, Members of
Congress, and judges and judicial officers, including jurors,
b@ combined in a singl© section.
And then that is carried forward in the Committee
Reports, Senate Report Mo. 2213 in the 87th Congress, £:Th@
current bribery laws consist of separate sections applicable
to various categories of parsons, government employees, Members
of Congress, judges, and others.

Section 201 would bring all

these categories within the purview of one section, and make
uniform th© proscribed act of bribery as well as the intent or
purpose involved."
And there is a similar provision in the House
Committee Report, which is House Report Mo. 748 in the 07th
Congress.
Mow, there was at that time, as you may recall, a
considerable development of thought about conflict of interest,
a bill with respect to conflict of interest cam© before
Congress, and it was at th® initiative of the Senate Judiciary
— of th® House Judiciary Committee that these provisions with
respect t© bribery were Consolidated and introduced in th© same
bill,

'i
And I think it is perfectly fair to say that this

statute should b© construed in the light of its clear and long™

21
continued history as one which, in part at least, is focused
by Congress on the actions of Congressmen and Senators, and
amounts t© a clear declaration by Congress that this sort ©f
conduct should bs tried in the courts with the procedural
safeguards and provisions which are applicable to criminal
prosecutions before the judiciary.
Q
enacted?

Whan was this statute, in its present form,

I didn't *—
MR. GRISWOLDS
Q

In 1962.

1962?

MR. GRISWOLD: It was 1958 that the House Committee
/

recommended that they b@ consolidated.

When the conflict of

interest statute cam® along, that was put in as a part of it,
and it -was in 1962 that all the various bribery provisions were
brought together into a single statute, which looks quite
broad ©s it is now, but which, in the light of its historical
background, is, it seems to ms, quite narrowly focused in
thi® application on bribery of Congressmen and Senators.

I'd like to address myself first, if I may, to what
I believe is a misconception on the part of fch© Solicitor —
Mr. Solicitor General as respects the factual background of
this cas®, which was before Judges Hart, at the tim® h©
decided the issue, which brings the case here.
At page 12 of the Appendix there appears colloquy

remarks to Judge Hart, if -the Court please,

It is —

Well — but how are we to treat it as summary

We don't have the base® upon which you make that

argument.
MR® RAMSEY:

I would say, Mr. Justice, that our

approach to that is that the Assistant did make a concession
of fact.

That is to say that it was a stipulation which was

mad© by th© Assistant as respects what the facts of the case
were, put before the district judge, and the district judge
was entitled to rely upon that as negating th© need for
additional proof in tills particular record.

Although the

confidential memo doss exist in th© records of the District
Court.
But h© saw no need to, in effect, say:

we will put

on th® record th© full confidential memorandum, which has been
heretofore filed.

And, obviously, what was the concern of

counsel end the court at that point in time was that this case

There was no need to have further newspaper publicity

But Judge Hart didn’t need to put it on the record,
where tha Assistent said flatly, on behalf of the United

States, —
Q

Mr. Rameey, did h© give a stipulation or did

ha adhere to the interpretation of what, the indictment said?
MR. RAMSEYt

Mr. Justice, the approach was that the

govermieat supplied a memorandum ©f alleged —
Q

So far as I’m concerned, it’s a memorandum that

isn't in this record? I am not interested in it.

At least

for this question.
MR. RAMSEYx

Well, all X — feh© only answer X can

give to that, Mr. Justice Marshall, is —
Q

Ra didn’t detail that in hi® statement, did h©?

MR. RAMSEYs

That is the essence of the memorandum,

that nothing except legislative acts are concerned, sir.
Q

The point is that he did not mention the

memorandum, did he?
MR. RAMSEYs

He did not mention fch© memorandum, no,

sir.
Q

Wasn't he merely stating what his ©pinion was

MS. RAMSEYs
that,

EJo, Your Honor, X must disagree with

what h© was saying was what the record in fact disclosed,

that is t© say, —

Q

Well, what record?

MRo RAMSEY 2

The record which the Assistant knew

about, th© court knew ©bout —
Q

In this record?

MR. RAMSEYs

The record in the case before Judge Hart ,

sir.
Q

Is it her©?

MR. RAMSEY %

It is not, except in th© form of the

concession by the Assistant.
Q

Welly the judge, Judge Hart, in the first,

paragraph of his opinionf speaks of the facts of tills case.
MR. RAMSEY:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

And ifc was on that

basis that I was trying to put in context ©11 that was said
b©for® th© court was 'that the court was relying ©si facte which
he knew to be concession© in th© record by th© United States,
openly conceded by th© Assistant, that he was tasting
legislative acts, pure and simple.
Q

Well, Mr. Ramsey, I'm looking at page 2 of th®

Appendix, the indictment, just above the middle of the page.
!•

The indictment charges Min return for being influenced in his
performance of official acts in respect to his action, vote, and
decision on postage rate legislation which might at any time
be pending before him in his official capacity".
MR. RAMSEY:
Q

Mow, --

Yes, Your Honor.

— how would any details of this so-called bill

21
of particulars b© basically different from that» except to
pinpoint the particular day os hour or what-not?
MR. RAMSEY:

That's precisely the way in which the

particulars — the particulars simply address themselves to the
allegation of the indictment which was that it was official
action.

That is to say» legislative action.

And that is

on a given day» at a given time, in a

precisely what it dids

given committe® hearing» in a given vote on the Floor» there
was a certain step taken by the Senator which is alleged to
show that
his action» vote» and decision was,inferrentially at
✓
least» premised upon antecedent conduct or relations with
Spiegel and/or Anderson.
Q

I have difficulty seeing how the hour or the

day actually enlarges what is already said in the indictment»
so far m the constitutional provision is concerned» —
MR. RAMSEY I
Q

Well, I —

-*• or the jurisdiction of the Court.

MR. RAMSEY:

Well» I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that

so far as the jurisdiction and so far as the constitutional
point ©re concerned, it can be addressed purely on the basis
of the structure of the indictment.
1 believe, however, in fairness to the Court, that
all of these items which appear throughout this record, in
which the Solicitor General hsd not caught the items in their
»

context» do clearly indicate -that the government never con-

28
t©sided it was anything but legislative action, which was under
attack here*

Therefore, we are not up against a miasma of

claims that h® may have acted with the Executives for example*,
in fch© Burton type situation, where a U. S, Senator — ©r a
Johnson type substantive counts, where a Congressman work©
into the Executive side ©f the government and may indeed fc@
subjected to criminal prosecution, as was Congressman Johnson,
in connection with, his activities before the Attorney General
of the United States, on the Executive side»
Now, this is the position which w© havs taken right
along.

That is to say# that basically you may approach the

entirety of the problem, both as a const!tutional matter and ®@
a jurisdictional matter, on the basis of the indictment before
the Court and our motion to dismiss.

Because we view our

motion to dismiss, if the Court please, in this postures
under the earlier teachings of the Court, in the cases which
have dealt with the speech or debate clause, as it has come
before this Court, it has taken on a significance which is to
the effect that not only does the clause give protection t©
the accused Senator or Congressman from the accusation itself,
but frees him, indeed, from the obligation to defend himself.
This, of course, Mr. Chief Justice, you will recall,
was an aspect of the Powell case in the lower court opinion,
the Circuit Court opinion, written while you were on the bench
hare in D.

c«,

and it also was the teaching of the Dorobrowski

29
casa, and ultimately of the Powell case before this Court, whan
it caa-ss up hare.

That there was freedom not only from fch©

charge itself, but, in addition, it was intended to free fch©
particular public servant of the obligation ©f defending
himself, which is an even more subtle concept in the sens® that
it doesn't quite coin© to fch© same form of immunity that we
normally think of.

Xfe steps in ahead.

And what we had don®, by our motion to dismiss in
this case, was invite the District Court's attention to fch©
operative ©vents which led t© our being in a position where
w© could say fc© fch® courts

Wa ought to fo@ protected against

the obligation ©ven fc© defend ourselves, because —
Q

Defend himself from what?

MR, RAMSEY:

Defend himself from that — the liability,

Mr* Justice, it speaks in terras of being questioned in any
other place, on speech or debate ~"

Q

On any speech or debate?

MR. RAMSEY*
Q

That is correct.

Mow, let's assume that the defendant in this

case never made a speech, never engaged in debate, never cast
a vote, in committee or on the Floor? but, nonetheless, took
a briba in return for his promise to do on© of fehosa things.
But eithcsr he never got around to it, or he broke his promis®.
Then what would the posture ©f fch© case be?
MR• RAMSEY:

I think, Mr. Justice Stewart, the

30
problem we*re v.p against there is whether this — his motiva­
tion may he questioned.
Q

That is to say, —

What was the bribe?

MR. RAMSEY:

— whsfc was his motive in accepting the

money, is really what you’re asking me, sir.

Q

Yes.

MR. RAMSEYs

tod to that extent, you see, you go to

motivation, in feh® Kilboum case and all ©f th© other esses
have addressed themselves not only to acts and conduct, but
anything which inquires into motive for the vote.
Q

Well, in my hypothetical case there was no vote.

He took a bribe in return for his promise to vote in a certain
way, or make a certain speech, but either h® broke his premise
or else he never got around to it, before he was indicted.
Then what role, if any, would the speech or debate clause
have in that?
MR. RAMSEYs

it seams to me that the speech or debat®

claws© would again keep him from being questioned in any feth@r
place other than the Hows®, of which he was a member.

W© do

not contend that the Senator or Congressman goes scot-free.
Q

Questioned for what in any other place?

He’s

now just simply being charged with taking a bribe.
MR. RAMSEY:
Q
th© Senate —

But in order to prove th© bribe up —

And he's never don© anything in th® House or in

31
MR. RAMSEY:
Q

That’s correct.

— in raspons© to the bribe?

ME. RAMSEY;

Yes, Yowr Honor.

If I may address myself to the point, Mr. Justice,
th© way I see it, the situation is this %

At the time h®

accepted the money, in order to prove up the bribery case, it
would be necessary fco prove that he undertook to do a certain
thing.

That is to say, that he was to b@ motivated in

connection with official conduct.

Otherwise you have proven

n© bribe.
It is precisely that, which the constitutional clause
would interdict, and stop the inquiry into.
Q

It doesn't say so, does it?

Counsel doesn’t

say so.
MR. RAMSEY:

Well, I think, sir, that constitutional

clauses, taken on the gloss of the cases which have interpreted
it all the way down,
Q

Well, what case interprets it in a way to

support your answer to my question?
MR. RAMSEY;

It seems to me that the Kilbourn case

does, sir, in connection with motive, inquiry into motive,
in any place other than the lions© ©f which he is a member.
Q
or a vote?

Inquiry into what?

Making a speech, a debate,

Here, under my question, there was no speech, there
(

was n© debate, there was no vote? there was merely the taking

32
of a bribe.
MR. RAMSEY:

X understand th© proposition which th©

Court puts to me, but X trust it is not thought to be this
situation, sir, bec&us© this was alleged to fo© for a vote for
various conduct.
Q

Wall, this was given in turn for a promise t©

vote a certain way.
MR. RAMSEY 2 Well -Q

Is there ©n allegation that there was any such

vote?
MR. RAMSEY:
Q

In the indictment?

MR. RAMSEY5
Q

Yas, sir.

Yes, sir.

In all of the counts?

MR. RAMSEY:

On© — well, -the initial counts, th©

first counts all deal with pending or to be pending before him;
the last count, sir, goes to 201(g), which has to do with
past conduct as distinct from anticipatory conduct.

So h@

is alleged to have received, in connection with his vote and
)

his action and his official conduct in connection with either
anticipated or coming legislation, legislation pending in th©
Congress; and, in the last count, with legislation which had
been in an earlier Congress, sir.
Q

It seems to m© that at least som© of the

counts of this indictment pretty well fit under ray hypothetical

33
asse*
ME. RAMSEY;

Wells- this is why I say to fcha Court

that the concession by the Assistant that what is talked about
is vote* and what is talked about is legislative conduct,
pure and simple —
Q

What is talked about in th© indictment is

taking a bribe, isn’t it?
MR. RAMSEYs That is correct.

In return for being

influenced and in respect to his action, vote, and decision.
Q

Mr. Ramsey,

MR. RAMSEYs
Q

-

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

— would your answer or your position b©

essentially the earn© if the bribe had been given to a Member
for the explicit promise not to vote and not to make a speech?
That is, suppose h© w@r© an opponent of fcha legislation, and
the money were paid for the negative instead of the positiva?
MR. RAMSEY: To stay away and abstain from —
Q

T© stay away, to absent himself.

MR. RAMSEY:

I would think that in that instance,

again you would be inquiring into the motive of a legislator,
and I believe, sir, that the speech or debate clause would
protect against inquiry.
Now, as I said ■—*
Q
away.

Nov?, if he stayed away, inquiry into his staying

34
MR, RAMSEY?

That8a correct, sir*

That,8 s absolutely

correct,
Q

Right o

MR. RAMSEYs

But ©a© has got —* on© is fch© necessary

quantum of proof, in order to prove up the other.

As the

Court pointed out in the Johnson ess©, Mr. Justice Stewart,
you've got & number of aspects ‘in this speech or debate clause.
One of them may be the exclusion of evidence at the trial, for
examplej because if this case had gone to ferial and testimony
had been elicited or sought to be elicited which had to do
with motive for his acceptance of particular moneys, Imraediat©ly you would have had confronting the court the problem of

to what extent is an evidentiary matter, assuming that we
don't meet it as a jurisdictional matter.

This problem was

raised also in the Powell case.
Does speech or debate address itself to jurisdiction
of the court?

In one phase of our brief

we have suggested

that it does, in the sense that this is a power delegated
constitutionally to one branch of government, and should not be
intruded upon by another.
In another portion of the brief w@ hav© suggested
that the Congress jointly cannot do what the Constitution
gives to each of the houses, respectively, the power to punish
its own members.
So that there still is, in the background of this

35
problem, th© question of s

Is it jurisdictionel?

Nov?, if it is not jurisdictional, and ws d© suggest
at ©ns point that it may b®, it certainly, zander th® Johnson
css® and I think under any rule of reason, it has its explica­
tion in th© problems of admissibility of evidence at trial,
where you run into constitutional interdiction, if you try to
elicit th© Johnson type testimony.
Q

Did you vote?

Why did yon?

Mr. Ramsey, —

MR. RAMSEYs

I

Yes, sir?

I

Q

— suppose a Senator or a Congressman accepts

$5,000 from A to speak and vote on future legislation, another

I

$5,000 from B to speak against and vote against a pies-® of
(

legislation, and goes fishing.
[Laughter.1
Is he up for bribery?
MR. RAMSEY:

2 would certainly say, sir, that both

of those actions of his would be subject to discipline in his
house.

I am simply addressing myself in this instance to

saying that thay should not b© questioned in any other place.
Which is what, the speech and debate says —
\

Q

What would he be disciplined in the house for,

for going fishing?
MR. RAMSEY:

For improper conduct — no, for improper

conduct in c®nn©ction with holding out that he would b© willing
to b© influenced in his vote.

36
It's the ©Id, 1 hope; the impossible story is -~
[laughing]

— equality applies both ways, and he ought to get

a fair result.
Th© fishing aspact of it, I don't think would fo© a
subject of discipline, Mr. Justice Marshall.
Coming to the —
Q

As I understand you, Mr. Ramsey, your position

is that the speech and debat© clause goes so far as to include
"except in fehs house in which he is a member”.

Any kind of

discipline against a Senator or a Congressman, where on©
official — what he has. don© is in connection with his function
as a Senator or a Congressman.
MR. RAMSEY:

Do you go that far?

I do, sir.

If it's l©gislafcive.

Ae

Mr. Chief Justice characterized it here, as legislative
conduct? yes, sir, X do,
Q

That5s what, when X said let's connect it

with is official responsibility, I meant.
MR, RAMSEY:
Q

Yes, sir? X do.

Mow ™~ and you say that the only discipline to

which he may be subject is any that may be imposed by his own
house? which v?ould take what form?
MR. RAMSEY:

It could take the form, as it has in the

past illustrations which are found throughout the various
studies of the Congress, it can he expulsion, for example,
suspension from the house, even imprisonment, and discipline

3?
by fine? may be imposed within the framework of th® House ©f
Congress' ability to discipline their own members,
Q

But what 'the House or Senate might do* in

V

disciplining a member* ~~
MR. RAMSEY:
Q

Yes* sir.

— is nothing that the Congress may say shall

b© turned over to the courts to do for them?
MR. RAMSEY:
Justice Brennan.

That is one portion ©£ our brief* Mr.

W© address ourself to that and suggest that

whsr© fch® Congress allocates it t© each house* that it is not
delegated to the Congress as a whole for the purpose of
legislating concerning it.
Wow* I think* sir* we hav® eliminated or omitted
only one* and that is a major thing t© a politician* and that
is th© people at the polls.

They have the absolute right to

turn him out* and this* of course* is on© of the political
realities of th© whole situation* which ultimately must be
faced by everybody who must run for office? and it is on®/of
the real justifications for giving a political judgment as
respacfcs proper punishment to a political forum as distinct
from a judicial forum.
It permits the testate of the conduct of the members.
As the Solicitor General arguas* h® says get it out of the
political forum* put it into the courts where th© dispassionate
grand jury* the dispassionate judges may hear it.

38

W© say, on fch® other hand, that ©very reasonable
practicality having to do with man who must foe elected to
office, to men who must seek campaign contributions, toman
who necessarily must confer with, consult with, and be
influenced by their constituents, day after day, in order to
avoid an inference being drawn in a grand jury by an overactive prosecutor.»
Q

Is there anything in the framers:* consideration

of the speech and debate clause that supports that position?
MR. RAMSEY:

I believe, sir, that y©^i will find this

philosophy, that is to say, the philosophy of the right to a
political philosophy is, for example, covered by Mr. Kirby
in his study for the bar of the City of Now York, as respects
the matter.
It*s covered by a Harvard Law Review Article, in
1? Harvard Lav? Review —
Q

Perhaps w® can got that, whether there were any

minutes, any kind of record, of what it was the framers
reported as what they had in mind when they adopted the speech
and debate clause in its present form.
MR. RAMSEY:

I do not believe, sir, that I can

honestly represent that there is a specific statement mad© by
on© of the framers of the Constitution as respects this, but
certainly shortly after it was put into effect as a
constitutional provision, it was *— it has been interpreted,

39
ia effect, to retaining this right within the political
body,, if the Court pleas©.
Q

But. at least we have a history, I gather, which

goes back to 1853, of Congress enacting this form of statute,
to relate to the Congress —
MR. RAMSEYt

You do hav® such a history, Mr.

Justice Brennan, but I v?ould submit that you also have,
c©~incid@nfe with it, you have running alongside of fch® 1853
statute, you have repeated assertions by the Congress, or the
houses ©f th© Congress, of fchair right t© seek out the
alleged bribe-takers, the Oakes-Ames typo case, all ©f which
are fully discussed in the historical footnotes in our brief.
And in 1873 they are into the Credit Mob i Her
scandal, in depth, with alleged bribery in the Congress,
with the Executive not attempting to use the 1853 statute for
any proaec ution.
You have the repeated assertion of Congress4 right
to fulfill its constitutional obligation to discipline its
own members, sir.
Now, in connection with the 1853 statute, I believe,
sir, that this should foe kept in mind.

Certainly the 1853
9

statute was designed to cover situations such as the case of
U. -S, vs. Burton, such as the case of U. S. V3„ Johnson., where
the whole thrust forward of the case was on th© basis th&fc
Johnson had bean bought.

He was bribed.

He v7as a bribed

40

Congressman,

The conspiracy element was admittedly the

textural basis for the case* but it was a claimed bribery,
and tiie government advanced many of the same arguments tfosra
that are advanced here; and they analogiae to and reason from
bribery statutes, including the one which is before us now,
Q

Well, but as I recall it, Justice Harlan's

opinion for the Court did reserve this very question,
MR, RAMSEY:

Justice Harlan certainly did, sir, and

it's explicit —
Q

But that suggests that mayba Johnson didn't

answer this question.
MR. RAMSEY;

Well, I*m not sure that Justice Harlan,

by reserving it, suggested necessarily that this Court would,
when it cam© up, still consider it an adequate case.
Q

Except that ordinarily if we reserve a question,

I think i*@ try to get over the message that we’re not deciding
that question.
MR. RAMSEY;

Precisely,

tod if you have not

decided it, sir, that I submit you can decide yes or you may
decide no, as the case may be.
Q

Mr. Ramsey, —

MR. RAMSEY;
Q

Yes, sir?

— I don't know whether this analogy would foe

helpful or not, but let m@ try it;
Suppose the Senator or a member of either house was

41
charged, not with receiving a bribe in relation to his official
conduct, but with paying a bribe to another member, not in the
House but downtown at a hotel or in a restaurant.

Would you

say that he was immune from prosecution?
MR. RAMSEY?

I 'think, Mr. Chief Justice, that you

are addressing yourself precisely to the set of facts that
existed in the G©k©s Ames case in 1873, when the Congress tried
the issue out themselves and the courts did not intercede.
That was the distribution of stock in connection with the
Credit Mobilior setup, ’where eight, ten, or twelve — spread
throughout th© Congress, as a practical matter, and up and
down the line.

v

I would say this, it seems to me that the Hous® is
capable of handling that problem on its own.

It seems to us

that th© Constitution commits that problem to 'the house of
which the man is a member.

And it seems to us that the

Constitution interdicts the intercession of the Executive.
Because the basic situation, as we see it, is this:
To rule or hold otherwise would give such powerful
control in the Executive to harass, investigate, and generally
badger anybody who makes a politically unpopular decision,
unpopular to the Executive — possibly perfectly acceptable
to th® Legislative side.

And always you have in the political

forum, you have 'the concurrence of ths need to get elected,
th® concurrence of campaign funds, the concurrence of visits

42
from constituents.

The likelihood that the Congressman3s votes

will indeed represent him as a Silver Bloc Senator# as a Farm
Bloc Senator# as a Fishing Bloc Senator# all having received
campaign contributions from those particular elements of their
constituents
One® you have an affirmative vota on a contribution#
we com© then to the question of:

May you put that before a

grand jury and say# '’Now, we're not suggesting it to you but
you may certainly draw an inference that there's cans© and
effect.ts
Th© thrust# the overpowering thrust to the freedom
of th® Congressman# which is posed by that type of a rule
would# it sto us, go a long way to destroy the basic
fabric of our tripartite form of government.
Q

But you don't suggest that the element of

official conduct, or conduct within the scops of his office# is involved when, he's a disburse? of the money rather than fa
receiver# do you?
ME. RAMSEYs

He would# in that instance, it seems t©

me, fail within the, as th® Solicitor General described it#
the briber not th© bribe©# is the postulate which you’re
putting to me# Mr. Chief Justice# as I understand it.
And it seems to me that what you certainly have in
that case is probably the ability to get him as principal
first degree# no matter which side of the coin he's on# if he

43
oocwpj.es his offici©! position.
So I am not sure that which side he's on would make
much difference in my professional judgment, as respects his
possible freedom from or subjection to discipline or trial,
as a result of his conduct, sir,
Mow, I would like to address myself, just for a
moment, if 1 may, t© ©n© further aspect of this point with
respect to th® breadth of the privilege.
I think it's perfectly clear, and I think Mr. Justice
Brennan's question to the Solicitor General makes it clear, and
th© concession at page 11 of the government*a brief, that
what is covered by the speech or debate clause are"committee
reports, resolutions, and the act of voting, as are‘things
generally dona in a session of th® house by on© of its

members

in relation to the business before it.8”
And I am talcing that quote directly out of this

Court’s opinion in the Powell case.

And it of course carries

forward a saries of other decisions, which had ante ceded -going all the way back to some of the landmark decisions in
th© early days shortly after the Constitution was adopted?
and at a time when it may reasonably b® thought that, the judges
who were writing about it had reason to know basically what
was in th© mind ©£ th© framers.
Insofar as th© 1853 Act is concerned, we say this
very simply.

The 1853 Act could constitute a perfectly proper

44

exercise of Congressional authority without coming into
conflict with speech or debate if it is lira!ted in its
impact to situations v;h@rs a Senator may or did receive moneys
in connection with Executive conduct or conduct relating to
the Judiciary, but not in connection with Legislative.
And it is there, again coining back, Mr. Chief Justice,
to th® question which you put to me, sir, it is there that w©
com© back to say that is within th© ambit of th© house of which
he is a member? it is without th® ambit of the Judiciary and
the Executive.
And looking at the 1853 Act, and looking at th©
1962 revision of it, we most respectfully urge that in ©ach of
those instances this can b© given constitutional validity in
its broad range, to protect against bribery? but that the
Executive and Judiciary should withhold their hand where they
intrude in to what might, be called the basic defensive
mechanism given by the .Constitution to th© Members of the
Congress of the United States.
Q

How far would you carry this in terms of

other crimes, Mr. Ramsay?

You remember, historically, 100

years ago, more ©r less, some Members of the Congress struck
©ach other and challenged each other to duels, perhaps even
shot ©ach other.
MR. RAMSEY:
Q

Indeed' they did.

Was there immunity from prosecution there,

45
across the hoard?
ME. RAMSEY:

As a practical matter * all of those we

recall are in the House and Senate proceedings, and they were
q?jdfc© frequently called t© task; particularly at about the tiro®
of the Civil War? they were called to task for challenging to
duels, for fisticuffs ©n the floors of the various houses of
Congress .
And basically I would say that that is not covered by
speech or debate, or by this Court’s interpretation of speech
or debate.
Nov?, again, on the other side of that, it is clearly
within the House’s power to punish unseemly behavior on the
floor of its legislative hall,
Q

The question is, is it beyond the power of the

Executive?
MR. RAMSEYj

I would think, sir, it would probably,

in most instance», fall outside fch© scope which 1 contend for
the speech or debate clause, as interpreted by this Court.
Q

Would you say, then, Mr. Ramsey, that if there

were a statute which punished an assault by on® Congressman
upon another, and provided that the punishment should b© by
the Judiciary in the form of a prosecution, you would say that
that would be constitutional?
MR. RAMSEY:

1 would think that it would, sir, because

I think it would fall outside the definitiori of things

46
ordinarily dons in the session ©£ the houses of which they are
a member.
In other words, I simply cannot read bodily assault
into it.
Now, I would say, contrariwise, Mr. Justice Brennan,
that what would occur would b© that the house itself would
take immediate steps, and there would b© little need for the
Judiciary or the Executive ever to concern itself with that
type situation.
Q

Well, let's take a rather outlandish hypothetical.

One wanted to vote, a Congressman, a Senator wanted to vote a
certain way, and for some reason or other he thought a fellow
Senator was impeding his recording of his vote, his announcement
©f it, and s© he just got a gun and shot the Senator standing
in his way.
MR. RAMSEY;

[laughing]

I have no doubt this Court

would, in due course, find that that was a perfectly appropriate
case for criminal proceeding.
Q

That would not be, even though what was

involved was an attempted interference with his vote, you
still say that that was not covered by the speech or debate
clause?
MS. RAMSEY:

I would say that I think that is correct,

sir, because 2 think this is an extrame means used to rectify
an error made, which could otherwise be rectified without the

47
need for physical violence.
And I think as a practical mattere Mr. Justice
Brennan, we may be debating something which possibly we don’t
©van have to debate, in that it may well b@ that because it
occurred on federal property you might reasonably h@ able to
apply Title 10 to a murder, for example, which occurred under
the circumstances which the Justice has outlined,

h general criminal statute, but this not being within
the ambit ©£ speech or debate, h@nc@ permissible.
Q

1 take it, your position is that immunity of

Congressmen and Senators is defined

by the speech or debate

clause, and there is no separate doctrine, aside from that, of
legislative immunity?^
ME. RAMSEY:

I am directing my attention, Justice

White, to only speech or debate as interpreted by this Court
as sufficient to cover this particular case,

X am not arguing

a generalised legislative immunity, as such, sir.
Q

Do you read Dorbrowski y. Eastland as suggesting

that there is a doctrine of legislative immunity, aside from
the speech or debat© clause?
MR. RAMSEY:

Well, I suppose Dombrowskl v. Eastland

can be read for that; it was focused more on the right ©f the
staff members to, shall we say, have the benefit of,
Q

a Senator

Yes, but there was a question of the immunity of

48
MR. RAMSEY:

Y©sP sir? there was-

There vary

definitely was.
Q

But,generally speaking, the doctrine of

legislative immunity is one that's applicable to anyone known
as a defendant in a civil action, isn't that correct?

Any

member?
MR. RAMSEY:

That was Dombrowakf, of course, sir.

That was not criminal.
Q

It8© not generally considered to be a doctrine,

then.
MR. RAMSEY:

Well, Powell, of course, also was civil

as distinct from criminal.
And so in both of those instances you were talking
— 1 think we invariably find in the opinions, Mr. Justice
Whit.©, you invariably find discussions which tend to talk in
terms of legislative immunity as a shorthand form of referring
to what is given, or the protection accorded under a given set
of circumstances; and we most frequently see them in fch©
context of libel suits, and we frequently see them in the
context
Q

But legislative — I mean the speech ©r debate

clause would protect a Congressman or Senator against civil
liability as well as criminal.

As a matter of fact* I suppose

protection against libel was a major function of the —"
MR. RAMSEY:

Indeed, I would expect so, sir-

49
Q

— speech or debate clause.

MR* RAMSEY:
other plae®.

Yes, it stay not be questioned in any

As thay say, it is not a word, really, which is

on© of the terms of work we are accustomed to.

And as the

Chief Justice said in a lower court opinion in Powell, in
connection with that "may not be questioned" has implicit in
it "need not answer".

This is ~ it’s © word that has more

meaning, really, than our standard words which go to privilege.
It speaks in terms of, for a speech or debate h©
may not b@ questioned in any other place.

And the historical

antecedents ©f it vary clearly indicate that they were talking
about courts in the older days, they were talking about courts
■3

in our early charter provision® and in our early State
constitutions? that's exactly what they had in mind.
Q

Well, let's take the Powell case, which is

probably as broad a statement of the speech or debate clause
r'-

coverage as any.
MR. RAMSEY:
Q

Yes, sir.

At least it — and it picked up prior cases,

you ®®y?

MR. RAMSEY:
Q

That's correct, sir.

Mow, that clause arose in that case in the

context of a claim against a Congressman in th® civil context.
MR. RAMSEY:
Q

And •—»

That is correct.

50
MR» RAMSEY:

Of course it rules out the exclusion

of the Congressman
Q

1 understand; 1 understand»

MR» RAMSEY:

—* from the Congress, and the question

of th© liability ©f his brothers in th© house for their
conduct in that connection, sir.
Q

You think th©. speech or debate clause should

have th© sain© construction in civil and criminal context?
MR. RAMSEY:

I think as a practical matter, Mr.

Justice White, it has an even broader application in th©
i

criminal context, because of its antecedents; its parliamentary
antecedents, with the fears of torture, th© fears of commitment
to the Tower, the fears of imprisonment, which ware used to
dominate the Members of Parliament.

We brought that forward

into our structure, as it came into our Articles of Confeder­
ation, and thence into our Constitution, largely to keep th©
Executive from dominating the Legislative.
Therefore, to me, speech or debate, because of its
historical antecedents, has even greater application in the
criminal, field, because that was- one of the major things
which the framers war® attempting to protect the Legislative
against, was intimidation by threat of grand jury, by threat
of even a baseless indictment, which can wreck a political
being.
Q

I fcak© it, just to pursue that one hypothetical,

51
that, ysm have conceded that if one Member arranged to kidnap
or otherwise coerce & Member from going to the Floor to vote,
he did this downtown# that that would be subject to ordinary
prosecution, criminal prosecution, conduct outside the house,
let’s say; but that if h® hands in an envelope with a lot of
money in it to do the same thing, that somehow then becomes
connected with official duty,
MR. RAMSEY3

X think, Mr. Chief Justice, the point

which I make as respects that is this*
Tfo® on© has to do with conduct, physical conduct, if
the Court please; the other has to do with attempting to
motivate —
Q

Let’s just make it a threat, then.

A threat of

physical violence, not the actual physical violence.
MR. RAMSEYs

Well, Icm unclear in the hypothetical

which the Court puts to me.
©f the indictment?
Q

Who would be the subject matter

The man who made tea threat or ~

The threatenor and the briber, the man who is

threatening or giving the bribe, not the receiver.
MR, RAMSEY:

Not the receiver.

In that connection, I would take the position that
the threatens»- should be subject, and I’m sure would b©
subject, to criminal prosecution.

If you were attempting to

inquire into why the man who got the bribe voted, motivation
being the question you’d be posing in order to prove the bribe,

52
I would think that you would hav© an interdiction of the
speech or debate clause; as against inquiry into acceptor's
motivation, sir.
Now, contrariwise, the man who gives the bribe, you
are not inquiring into his motive as respects a vote, you are
inquiring into hi© attempting to motivate another.

And some-

where between thoss two extremes would lie the line of determination, where I believe tills Court would say Kno'5 as to the
recipient, if you're trying to .prove his motive; and "yes" as
to the bribe-giver, if you’re attempting to prove that h@ was
instituting conduct which would motivate another.
Q

Mr. Ramsey.

MR. RAMSEY;
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice White.

Let*© assume an instance like is involved in
f

this case takes place, and the Congress then, by the particu­
lar house involved, by resolution unanimously passes and says,
**W© waive any right to punish the Member, and will let the
authorities proceed against him under the criminal laws'4?
MR. RAMSEY:

1 would say, Mr. Justice White, the

answer to that has got to be in ‘the basic reason for the clause.
Q

Postulate —

MR. RAMSEY:

Let's assume that the house may give up

its prerogative, so to speak; but I think the Court must look
deeper.
house,

Th@ prerogative is not there only to protect that

53
Q

Just a rsinufc© ~~

MR, RAMSEYs

It's put there fco protect the persons

who elected tli© members ©f that house as well as the members.
Q

Well,, if the house couldn’t do that, a fortiori,

couldn’t do what is don© her©?
MR. RAMSEY:

There is some harping at Judge Hart’s

colloquy in the government8s brief, but Judge Hart put a
similar postulate in the colloquy before the court, in the
lower court, and I think that this is the reasoning which the
lower court was using:

if they can't do it, how can -they

combine with another house, which has no power over their
members, and give up this right?

Which, frankly, is bottomed

on the right of the people's representative to b© protected
in freedom of speech, freedom of debate, and as that clause
has been interpreted by this Court through the years.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and gentlemen.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Ramsey.

Mr. Solicitor General, you have about three minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N» GRISWOLD,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GRISWOLD:

Thank you, Mr. chief Justice.

Unless this Court is prepared to hold that Congress
has no constitutional power to make it a crime for a
Congressman or Senator fco accept a bribe for any sort of.
f

conduct with respect to his legislative responsibilities, I

54
b@li.eve. that: this judgment should be reversed*
Q

Well,, they could make it a crime, Mr. Solicitor

General, but provide for the trial of the Member in the House
or the Senate.
MR. GRISWOLDi

Ch, yes.

When I said make it a

crime, I meant a crime in the traditional sense, by indictment
by grand jury, and prosecution in court.
There isn’t any doubt that either house has the
power to subject to penalty and to expel a member who does
anything which the house thinks warrants that.
There is a further problem, which has been referred
to in the cases, which is, as far as the Home of Representa­
tives is concerned, imprisonment can extend only until the
termination of that Session of the Home? and if the bribery
was not found until, in the old days, the 2nd of March, you'd
have to hold the trial and he'd be released on the 4th ©f

1

March, whenever the Congress expires.
Moreover, it is perfectly clear that the practical
problems with respect to trial of these matters before the
House or the Senate are difficult, a fair trial of one of these
matters might be complicated, might tab© the time, for a month,
©f the Congressmen -and Senators.

And, I repeat, if Congress

chooses to allocate that to the regular courts, unless the
court is prepared to hold that Congress cannot constitutionally
do that, this judgment should be reversed.

55
I would repeat —
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, the Congress here not

only allocated the job*, the task ©£ actual trial, but the
decision as to whether fe© proceed —
ME. GRISWOLDs
q

Yes, Mr. Justice, 'that --

— to the Executive Branch of the 'government.

MR. GRISWOLD §

That is true, and that point is made

with respect t© the contempt of a witness, that it does require
a resolution ©f the house, on recommendation from the
committee, before it goes to fell® Executive for proper action.
Q

But that i© not required in this instance?

MR. GRISWOLD?

And that is not required in this

instance.
Q

Well, Mr. Solicitor General, may I asks

I take

it that goes this far, that suppose the Senate unanimously
has adopted a resolution that nw© do not wish to call Senator
Brewster into account for this conduct®, nevertheless, I gather
that the Executive could go ahead with a trial?
MR, GRISWOLDi

It would be our position that the

Executive could go ahead under this statute.

And I repeat,

our position is -that unless the Court is prepared to hold that
Congress has no constitutional power to make it a crime for a
Congressman or Senator to accept a bribe for legislative
conduct
Q

1 don't think he conducted a crime —

56
MR. GRISWOLDs

this judgment should be reversed.

I*et me refer to the fact that the statute in this
cate, ©s it now stands, makes no reference whatever to votes
1'

it simply says "before him in his official capacity.”5
Md, though I don't need to go so far, I think that a conviction
could be sustained under this indictment without any showing
as to how Senator Brewster voted on any matter, or indeed
without any evidence that h© voted at all.
Finally, I would call attention to the fact that
there was a concurring opinion in the Johnson ease by Chief
Justice Warren la which Justices Brennan and Douglas concurred,
which proceeded on the narrow ground of the extensivo us® of
the speech in that case, thus there is nothing there decided
beyond that, by anything except a 4 to 3 decision; and our
position is that the problem of this case was not only expressly
1®ft open, but © considerable intimation that the Court did
not think that it should g© as far in construing this rather
simple language of the speech and debate clause as to make it
impossible for Congress, by statute, to make it a crime for ©
Congressman or Senator .to accept a bribe.
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General.
Thank you, Mr. Ramsey.
The case is submitted.
