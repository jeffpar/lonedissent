ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEOFFREY CREYKE, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONS?
MR. CREYKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
This case is also here for reargument, and it comes
from the United States Court of Claims.

It involves the finality-

under a 1961 federal construction contract of an administrative
disputes decision favorable to the contractor allowing payment
for certain routine contract changes, which decision v?as
accepted by the contractor and by the agency, the Atomic
Energy Commission, but was collaterally attacked by the
Comptroller General on his own initiative precluding payment
and forcing us to sue in the Court of Claims.
There is no issue as to the authority to enter the
contract, obligate funds, or indeed to conduct the disputes
process? neither is there any allegation of any fraud, wrong­
doing or impropriety whatsoever on the part of anyone
connected with tha contractor or the AEC.
The matter is simply one which we say the Comptroller
General, is; an overreaching of his powers, has blocked payment
of the resolution of this matter under the disputes process,

4
forcing the contractor into litigation-

i;.1 n

•

ot

Justice here takes the position that the action of the
Comptroller General is immaterial; and, although it is not
supported by the Atomic Energy Commission in its pursuit of
this, nevertheless contends that this creates a right of
judicial review of this proceeding.
The case was decided by the Court of Claims in a
4-to~3 opinion, the majority holding that regardless of what
precipitated the litigation there would be a judicial review
conducted under the standards of the Wunderlich Act of 1954.
And the case was remanded to the Commissioner of the Court of
Claims for a hearing on the merits.
Therefore, the case is not here on the merits as
such, but on the question of the finality of this determination
under the disputes process, and the rights of the contractor,
which he is asserting to hold that that disputes process, having
been accepted by the agency, was final, and is not subject to
collateral attack.

The case therefore involves a contract

between the agencies and an interpretation of this Wunderlich
Act.
If I may briefly review the history of the case
itself, it is laid out as a chronology on page 1 of the
Appendix.

It was a lump-sum competitively bid construction

contract to build a portion of the Atomic Reactor Test Station
for the Navy in Idaho.

5
The original sum was $1,272,000 and the contract
performance period was 100 days, or to run from August of ’61
to February of *62«
The contract was entered into cn a U. S. standard
Form 23, 23&, and so forth, based on a contract of the 1953
edition, with the normal and usual adjustment clauses, changes,
changed conditions, and other factors in the contract.
The work, however, due to extra work and extra time,
actually consumed 325 days, or, in effect, approximately double
the time of performance and the expenditures involved.
Six claims arose out of this, amounting to $i,950,00f
*

X •

and claims for an additional 120 days of time extensions.
They are routine claims, nothing extraordinary, other than
the magnitude of them in relation to the basic contract, the
type of thing that is encountered in almost all federal
constrnotion centracfcs.
Denied by the Contracting Officer, a timely appeal
taken, they were referred by the Atomic Energy Commission
under then existing practice to an Examiner, who heard, at a
3.3-day hearing, the claimst and an adversary proceeding found
in December ‘62 for the appellant here on liability.

The

matter was remanded by him to the Contracting Officer to
negotiate quantum.
The Contracting Officer appealed to the Commission
itself.

This proceeding, to this extent, being a little

6
different from your normal Board of Contract Appeals type of
proceeding, which is prevalent throughout most of the federal
departments today.
The full Commission —
Q

You mean including this Commission, Mr. Creyke?

MR. CREYKE:
Q

Sir, today —

Yes.

MR. CREYKE:

■— they have a Board of Contract Appeals

just as does the Department of Defense and other agencies.
Q

Yes.

MR. CREYKE:

In November of 'S3 the full Commission

reaffirmed some of the claims and granted a review by the full
Commission on several, mostly pertaining to time extensions.
In May 13, 1964, the Commission itself, in a formal act,
affirmed the claims other than a slight modification on one
regarding time of site access, which it remanded for
negotiation, and directed the Contracting —
Q

Do 1 gather that today that kind of action

would be taken not by the Commission itself but by Board of —
MR. CREYKE:

The Atomic Energy Commission Board of

Contract Appeals —
Q

Yes.

MR. CREYKE':

— which is very much like the counter­

part of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.
Q

Yes.

7

MR. CREYXE:

Yes, sir, Your Honor.

There was this remand to the Contracting Officer
again in May of 364, then by the full Commission, but in the
meanwhile the Disbursing Officer had addressed an inquiry to
the General Accounting Officer regarding certain setoffs,
involving about $32,000, items which were independent of the
merits of the claims themselves, and so found by the Commission
or the Court of Claims who reported on this case.
But the request which went to the General Accounting
Office expressly stated that it was not to be construed as a
request for a review of or concurrence in the dispute.
Nevertheless, the General Accounting Office did,
contending that it had a right, acting in an executive
capacity and under the standards of the Wunderlich Act, to
review the entire decision, did so, taking 33 months to do it;
and in a 260-page opinion set aside the entire decision.

It

allowed not one cent, it allowed not one day's time extension,
had in its own papers filed in these proceedings, it character­
ises this action as an advance notice of disallowance.
Q

Well, you said they set aside.

Is that what

GAO did, or —
MR. CREYKE:
"set

Perhaps I inadvertently' used the words

de", I should have said they simply blocked payment

of this, taking the position that the contractor was not
entitled to any compensation whatsoever.

Q

tod suppose,, despite GAO's expressing dis­

approval » AEC had gone forward nevertheless and paid it? what
would have been the risk in making the payment that the
members of the Commission would take?
MR. CREYKE: 1 suppose they would be subjected to
possible charges personally, or their bond being charged by
the Comptroller General for the amount so disbursed, if his
position has ultimately been maintained.
Q

And the amount involved was about a million

dollars, was it?
MR. CREYKE;
Q

Sir, the amount claim. 'Was $1,950,000.

Well, I mean, the agreed settlement was for how

much?
MR. CREYKE;
Q

Oh, I see.

MR. CREYKE;
Q

The Examiner found liability —

Yes.

MR. CREYKE;
Q

There was never an agreed settlement.

— the Commissioner affirmed liability.

So the amount had not been fixed?

MR. CREYKE; The amount had not been resolved.
Q

Rut whatever it was --

MR, CREYKE:

It was in negotiation? the amount

claimed as a million nine hundred.
Q

But .if the payment had been made, if settlement

had bean agreed upon and the payment made, a million dollars,

9
whatever the amount was, then the members of the Commission ran
the risk, by paying it, of personal liability?
MR, CREYKE: Correct, sir.

Or a liability under bond,

' or the Disbursing Officer might have run that risk.
Q

Yes o

MR. CREYKE:

That is not altogether clear to me,

the full extent of that proposal.
Q

Well, 1 expect ~-

MR. CREYKE:

But it would be, as we view it, a total

deterrent to making disbursements.
Q

Well, if you or I were members of the Commission,

we'd hesitate twice with that sword over our heads, wouldn't
we?

Making the payment.
MR. CREYKE:

Agreed.

I quite agree, Mr. Justice

Blackiaun.
Q

What happened to the petitioner in the meantimeY

Is the petitioner still in business?
MR. CREYKE:

Sir, the petitioner is not in business.

He’s been unable to continue in business ever since.
Q

Is there anything in the record about this?

Well, don’t —- I don't want to take up your time, but

I just —
MR, CREYKE:

1 would say there is no — nothing in

the record itevilf to this affect, bearing in mind, sir, that
the record, as such, can only be the record of the Atomic

10
Energy Commission proceeding, as reviewed under the motion
for summary judgment proceeding in the Court of Claims.
Q

When, as, and if they receive soma money, will

they receive interest from the time when it was due?
MR. CREYKE:

Under the present state of the law, no,

sir.
Q

The Court of Claims cannot make an allowance of

interest, as such, can it?
MR. CREYKE:

Mo, it cannot. There have been some

decisions in recent years which have enabled the Court of
Claims to recognise as overhead expense certain interest
accruing during a period of extended overhead while the work
was being performed.

But there is no basis for allowing

interest for the period beyond the time when the contract was
completed, which was of course in 1S62.
Q

•

It would take special legislation to treat that

aspect of the problem, I suppose?
MR. CREYKEs

I would think it would.

There is a

remote possibility that it has been discussed, that one might
go for an amendment without consideration under Public Law
87-653.

It is unprecedented, but it is simply something

that has run through our thinking.
Q

/ Mr. Creyke, in the

lawsuit as a consequence?
MR. CREYKE:

Correct.

then you had to bring the

11
Q

lowt in that lawsuit, the government defended

of course, is this 260-page memorandum of any binding effect
on anyone'In the lawsuit?
MR. CREYKE:
Q

None whatsoever, sir.

Ite3 as if it were never read.

MR. CREYKE*

It is a published opinion, and therefore

we feel free to refer to it because it's in the opinions of
the Comptroller General.
Q

But the issue *—

MR. CREYKE:

But the issue in this suit, once we

brought it —
Q

Yes.

MR. CREYKE:

— in the Court of Claims, it came to

issue on cross-motions for summary judgment.
Q

Yes.

MR. CREYKE:
Q

Now, we —

But those cross-motions have to be decided by

the Court of Claims independently of this 260-page memorandum
or anything said in it?
MR. CREYKE:

Yes.

But it should be noted that in

the Court of Claims, not only the Department of Justice but
an attorney from the General Accounting Office appeared with
the government; at a. later point they diverted, and we were
faced with more than one adversary. But initially, in the
initial notion, it was filed not only by the Department but by

12
the — joined by the Comptroller General.
I£ I may discuss the Court of Claims proceeding
Q

May X ask a question before you. proceed?

What was the scope of the review of GJlO?

Was it

de novo?
MR. CREYKE:

They reviewed it, as I understand it,

on the .basis of saying that it was a review as to whether the
decision of the AEG, affirming the Examiner’s decision,- was
supported by substantial evidence, and whether it was correct
as a matter of law.
Q

They found it was not.

Did GAO accept findings of fact by the AEC or

its Examiner?
MR. CREYKE:
Q

They made its own findings of fact?

MR. CREYKE:
Q

Negative.

Yes, sir.

And no payment could be made in face of that

decision by GAO?
MR* CREYKE:
yes.

Practically speaking, that is correct,

But no payment has been made.
Q

Yes.

Only practically speaking.

AEC could have

gone ahead and told its Disbursing Officer to pay it anyway,
cou&fcn't it?
MR. CREYKE:

X think the Disbursing Officer would

have been within his own rights to independently refuse to
make that, at the direction of his superiors.

13
Q

And neither was going to risk making that

payment, for fear of a personal liability if they did it in
face of a disapproval of the General Accounting Office? wasn’t
that it?
MR. CREYKE s • I quite agree.
Q

And when you answered Mr. Justice Powell that

this was a. de novo review, I gather it's not a review of any
kind, whatever that 260-page memorandum, it has no legal effect
except as1 the statement of why GAO disapproved? wasn't that it?
MR. CREYKE:
Q

Yes, sir.

Historically 1 understand there have been

occasions where payments were made notwithstanding the opposi­
tion of the Comptroller General, but that was where the
Attorney General took the opposite position.
MR. CREYKEs

Historically, and particularly in the

period of the 19th Century, there were numerous cases and some
in this century where the Attorney General took an entirely
different view of the rights of the Comptroller General and
specifically held that in matters vested in the discretion
of the administrative official that he had no right to super­
impose his judgment.
And one of the big issues in this case will be whether
that was altered by the Wunderlich Act.

In other words, this

Court, in Mason 5 Hanger, very clearly held that the Comptroller
General had no right to inject —

14
Q

I’m going to tell hire, Mr. Creyke.

In this

very caste, suppose the Attorney General had said, No, I don't
agree with the Comptroller General and I'm not going to defend
this suit.

Might he have done that?
MR. CREYKE;
Q

Yes,

And the General Accounting Office would be

helpless to do anything about it?
MR. CREYKE;
Q

I think that's so.

And judgment would have gone, as a course for

your client?
ME. CREYKE;

1 think that's correct, Your Honor,

But our point here is there there would be nc case
on which to make such a determination were it not for the
improper, unwarranted, and illegal act of the Comptroller
General.
In fact, if we can go back just a second to the
proceedings in the Court of Claims, I think it's important to
bring out that having been referred to the Commissioner first,
he made a recommendation to the Court that the Court find that,
this was a breach of contract and that it render summary
j udgment*
0

Tell me, Mr. Creyke, suppose the Comptroller

General had not taken the action he did, but the Disbursing
Officer, for whatever reason, ha just refused to pay? you would
then still have had to sue, wouldn't you?

IS
HR. CREYKE:
Q

If the Disbursing Officer —

~~ had refused to pay.

MR. CREYKE;

— had refused to pay, in accordance

with the —
Q

No, the GAO did nothing.

MR. CREYKE;
Q

Yes.

But the Disbursing Officer just refused to pay?

you would still have to sue, wouldn't you?
MR. CREYKE;

I believe not, because it would have

been taken away from him by the action of the Commission, by
which he would be bound, since there is a formal act of the
Commission.

And the hypothetical situation you’re projecting,

as-I understand it, would entail a reversal of position cn the
part of the Commission or its representative.
Q

But you don't get a check until the Disbursing

Officer fills it out and sends it to you, do you?
MR. CREYKE;
Q
to you.

That's correct.

So, he. doesn't fill it out and doesn't send it

Then what’s your position?
MR. CREYKE;

What do you have to do?

If such a situation were to occur, then

I would suppose that in due course if we were unable to resolve
it we would have the possibilities of either seeking a mandamus
action, which has bean done in some cases where it involves
simply a ministerial action to carry out the obligation of the
United States, or the possibility of bringing an action in the

16
Court of Claims»
Q

Xu either event, the Attorney General would

defend your action, X take it?
MR. CREYKEj

Xn either event the Attorney General

would have the responsibility of defending a suit against the
United States.
Q

And suppose the Attorney General were then to say,

Well, GAO may have thought this was all right, but X don't, and
I'm going to defend it on the ground on which the GAO says it
should have been set aside?
MR. CREYKE: Well, this is a procedure which actually
the Attorney General suggested in that opinion in January of
1969 with which we took such strong issue,

Xn other words,

in effect he suggested that anyone within the government who
was not satisfied had the right to short-circuit, if you
will, the disputes process and throw the thing into litigation,
whereby the contractor who is plagued by the government's rule
accepted this onerous contract with all the incumbent
responsibilities of carrying forth changes at his expense.
Of carrying forward at his expense in accordance with the
Contracting Officer's determination while the dispute is
being resolved.

Ha would still have the additional onus,

having won, of carrying on this litigation.
How, that is not the way the disputes process works.
Q

Mr. Creyke, X*m not sure X followed those

17
hypothetical situations as they evolved in this colloquy» but
if the Comptroller General had taken no position and if the
Atomic Energy Commission had approved the payment» but its
Disbursing Officer refused to pay» the Atomic Energy
Commission might solve that by just getting a new Disbursing
Officer» might they not?
MR, CRBYKEs
Q

Quite so.

In .other words» he has no authority to interpose

himself, no legal authority to interpose himself between a
decision of the Commission and a contractor?
MR. CREYKEs

Absolute case of insubordination because

in that situation, by statute, the Atomic Energy Commission is
the delegated representative of the government.

And in this

situation the Commission itself has acted, has made a
determination, and that determination has never yet been altered,
Q

But 1 suppose, then, in light of that theory»

as Professor Petrowitz, in his amicus brief filed, suggests
you'd have then a suit against the government for damages for
breach of it's disputes contract?
MR. GREYKEt‘ 1 agree with that theory,
fact,

Now, in

■ Commissioner White's opinion in the Court of Claims

held that this non-payment in our case constituted a breach
of contract, because the remedies, as suggested, as required,
were sot carried out, were unavailable•
Q

That sometimes takes a long purse to assert

18
contractual rights.
MR. CRE'/KE:

1 would say it does.

It took a long

time in this case , Mr. Justice Douglas.
We*re — one of our problems in this case, of course,
is that SSE Contractors is taking on not one but three
adversaries, really, in a sense; although we have no conflict
with the Atomic Energy Commission at this point in time, we
do have problems, on the one hand, with the Comptroller
General, and on the other hand with the Attorney General.
As I started to say a little bit ago, in the initial
proceedings In the Court of Claims they were together.

Later,

after the Commissioner found for S£E and after we filed ~~
excuse me? after the government jointly filed a brief seeking
review, and we responded, they split and Look different
positions, and filed amicus brief in behalf of the Comptroller
General asserting different positions from those which the
Department of Justie© had asserted.
The Department of Justice seemed to bottom its case
on this nebulous right of making independent review,
notwithstanding the circumstances of how the matter cam© about,
It is our position that you simply cannot arrive at

such a situation without giving recognition to and approval of
ach of contract and an illegal failure on the

part of the agency of this United States, the Atomic Energy
salon, to carry out

h this contractor.

19
Now, from time imp

norial, this Court has recognised

the rights of and encouraged parties to provide methods whereby
they could resolve their own disputes.
In the ease of the government this has been recognised
particularly in the Jonas case 120 years ago, as well as in the
Mason & Hanger case to which 2 adverted a little while ago,
which both specifically involved an attempt by the Comptroller
General to overrule the head of an agency on a routine contract
matter.
There this Court held that there was no such power.
Now, was this altered by the

Wunderlich 'Act?

Remember that that Act came about as e. result of two decisions
of this Court in 1950 «and 1951, whereby this Court, in
upholding the rights of parties to contract for their own
remedies, said that they had contracted away the right to
judicial review’.
In the Moorman case, involving questions of law, and
in the Wunderlich case, involving questions of fact, the Court
suggested that if Congress felt a different standard should be
applied, it was a matter for Congress to undertake.

Q

Congress

We have it on page 3 and 21

It's short ~~

Well, Mr. Crsyke, apart from the Wunderlich Act-

I guess all the way back, as you said, 100 years ago or so?
MR. CREYKEi

We cited the Jones case in the 1850's,

20
yes, sir.

Q

Yes, and Xlhl.berg, and the rest of them —

MR. CREYKE:
0

Yes.

Certainly these ware all done— this was a

contractual matter, wasn’t it?
MR. CREYKE: Correct.
Q

And the parties would contract, as 1 recall it

they’d leave the decision to an official of one of them, and
that any matter in dispute would he resolved by him and that
h?.s decision would be final and conclusive.

That's as much

as the clause said initially, isn’t that right?

The original

form of the clause is a very short thing -—
MR. CREYKE:
Q

Yes.

for something like that, wasn’t it?

1 gather the fraud exception was engrafted by the
courts, wasn’t it?

at that tits* the fora of tbs clause, the

of one of the contracting parties would be conclusive and
binding, and the Court said that that was enforcible, in the
absence of fraud. Is that right?
MR. CREYKEs

Q

Yes, tour Honor.

And if there were fraud, then even the party

whose official had been agreed upon as the one who should make

award, could he not, for fraud?
MR. CREYKE;

MR. CREYKE:

Yes.

It has been characterised as

tantamount to arbitration by some, although we say it is not
because —
Q

Well, now you have a contract in which you have

a provision which expands, doesn’t it, on the initial form of
the disputes clause, from the simple clause it includes these

it
exceptions,that/m&y ha set aside where fraudulent — fraud is
expressly stated — and in four other exceptions.
Now, just, as a matter of contract law under the old
vital cases, why isn’t that ©«forcible?

22

Just as the initial clause was always enforcible ,
and the fraud exception, of course? why do you even have to get
to the Wunderlich Act here?

Well, I don't quite-understand why,under

everything since Kihlberg, these clauses have bean enforcible
at the suit of either, why that isn't enforcible as to all those
grounds of attack,
MR. CREYKEs

Sir, if you take the exact wording of

the clause, it's plainly • intended only to provide for the
contractor, because it says, "The decision ... shall be final
conclusive unless ...» the Contractor mails or otherwise
furnishes to the Contracting Officer” —
Q

You mean **- is this to say now that the

government, under this clause, cannot attack, as it always
could aver since Kihlbsrg, the act of its own official for
frav.d?
MR. CREYKEs

No, it is not, sir.

That is, it's

saying that the government cannot attack under this clause the
decision ofthe Contracting Officer and of the Commission.
Q

Well, no, that isn't what it says.

It says,

as only providing for a means for a contractor

to go forward with these appeals.
Q

It is

I suggest not where fraud was involved.

It

was always, even without the word "fraud” in the disputes clause,
tine government could attack the award of its own official for
fraud, couldn't it?
MR. CREYKEs

Q

It could for fraud.

All right.

Well, now they put the word "fraud"

in the provision itself and then added several other grounds
of attack.
MR. CREYKEs The clause which is in question here, of
course, was not the Wunderlich Act clause, which words it a
1 .ittle different,/ but this is the clause for our contract, and
w«8 ©re "**»

Q

Yes, this is the clause — what I'm reading from

is
MR. CREYKEs
Q

It is the clause under cur contract.

Yes.

But which you, I gather, negotiated with the
government?

I take it, when the contract was entered into.

MR. CREYKEs

Well, the word '’negotiated" has other

broad implications there
Q

Well, you would not have had the contract if

you hadn't agreed to a contract which included that provision,
I take it?

Is that right?
MR, CREYKEs

That’s correct, sir.

I Would like to conclude by saying that I feel if
this ease is on® in which fcha broad aspects of this entire
problem, the application of the disputes process, is of value
to the government and the contracting industry, it should be
given very serious consideration.

That the power to control

the incidence of contract, including this, should be limited
to those of the using agency, that it be determined that
traditionally, although construction might indicata the power
existed by the government to process this, in fact over the
years there is no background or no experience of it having
been done, that the government has the power to write
contracts and regulations to give itself powers of review which
it did not do so here*
And that there will be a vast harm dons to this

contractor as well as to the entire contracting industry if
this case is not overruled.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Q

Thank you, Mr. Creyke —

Mr, Creyke, let ms follow through on one of

Justice Brennan's questions; because I'm not sure that you
caught the full import of it.
I think it is his position that at all times the
government could appeal on the ground of fraud.

At all times,

prior to Wunderlich, at any time?
MR. CREYKEs
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

find the next step is that by putting in the

3.anguage of "fraud”, into the contract, this didn't disturb
that rule? and by putting in other grounds for appeal, the
implication is that the government can appeal with respect to
all those other grounds as well.
What I’d like to get is your answer to that suggestion.
MR. CREYKE:

As I read the background of that, Mr.

Justice Blackoun, the intention of putting that reference to
fraud in there, and it's brought out in the amicus brief of
the American Bar, was to expressly overcome the strict
standards established by this Court,in limiting a contractor
to right of review in the Wunderlich decision, in cases where
fraud was alleged.

It said it shall not be limited to that,

arid that the same, nevertheless, shall be presumed final unless

27
not supported by substantial evidence as well as no1'

filling

the other four standards as set out in the latter part of that
article *
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER!

Mr. Creyke, since you've

answered that last question after you had yielded the lectern,
we511 give you the three minutes you were trying to save $ and
we’ll enlarge you accordingly, Mr. Jaffa.
ME. CREYKE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Jaffa.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING JAFFE, ESQ.,
CM BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. JAFFE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court;
The real issue in this case is whether or not the
government may challenge in court a decision favorable to a
contractor rendered by an agency under the standard,

m

disputes

clause, on the ground that it does not meet the standards of
the Wunderlich Act,
Now, it should be horns in mind that the only
decision placed before the Court of Claims was not the GAO * s
opinion, not anything that the Department of Justice had done,
but the Atomic Energy Commission decision? and that decision
is challenged.

That is, the finality of that decision is

challenged, in .our answer, on the ground that it does not
comport with the standards of the Wunderlich Act.

2a
Q

In going to the practical matters that we have

explored —*
MR. JAFFEs
Q

Yes.

— in the colloquy, if the General Accounting

Office had never got into this situation at all, what would
the Atomic Energy Commission have done at the conclusion of
the performance?
MR. JAFF.E:
Q

Well, let me answer that question

Is it fair to assume that they would have paid

the contractor?
MR. JAPFE:

.Well ~~ yes.

In the normal course of

events, as happens with all of these contracts, the matter
would have been continued and concluded before the Contracting
Officer, which was where the Atomic Energy Commission sent it,
presumedly an amount that was due, since they found the
government liable on several of the claims, would have
ultimately been determined and paid by the agency’s Disbursing
or Certifying Officer.
However, I would like to answer the question that
was posed’ by Mr. Justice Brennans
Officer had not paid?

Suppose that the Disbursing

This is not a hypothetical situation,

except for this particular case, because the Disbursing
Officer of another agency not so long ago refused to pay.
1 say that mandamus would not lie, it's not a
ministerial act, because that decision which the Disbursing

29
Officer refused fee pay could be subjected to challenge by the
very device of refusing to pay.

It is not a decision which

requires payment taxless it is one which is not fraudulent ,
not arbitrary or capricious , not clearly so erroneo\is as to
apply bad faith; it must be supported by substantial evidence.
And one step more, it must be correct as a matter of law.
That's Section 320 ~~ the second section of the Wunderlich
Act .
So that on any of these grounds there is no — that
is, if any of those grounds are not met, there is no requirement
to pay.
How, the Disbursing Officer, assuming that he came
to the conclusion that this decision was infirm

under the

standards of the Wunderlich Act, could not foe compelled in
mandamus, in my opinion, to pay; it is not a ministerial act
required of him*

And the case to be subjected to judicial

scrutiny,
In this case there, has not yet been a determination
by a court of competent jurisdiction, namely the Court of
Claims, that this decision of the Atomic Energy Commission
hae any viability whatever or that any payment is required.
The reason it has not reached that decision is because the
plaintiff has contended, and this Court has granted certiorari,
that tii:; standards of the Wunderlich Act are available only
to this contractor? that there was nothing under the Wunderlich

30

Act which enabled tl

lenge a decision of

its own agency.
That depends upon who the government is.

Q

Well- 1 think 1 can answer that, Mr.

MR* JAPFSs
Justice Douglas —
Q

Yes.

Is the government the AEG in this case,

or is it the Department of Justice?

MR. JAFFE: Welly I think what you’re really asking
me is the mechanics of procedure as to how the matter gets
into court.

And it can get into court in a variety of ways.

The government, as Congressman Willis said when the question
I

was posed to him in the consideration of the Wunderlich Act,
said that it might be the General Accounting Office, it might
foe the Department of Justice, it might be the agency
involved.
Now, lot us assume, for example, another means by
which this could have come to court, and howt he government
would have assorted its rights.

Suppose, for example, the

disbursing officer did pay, as would have been true in the
normal course of events, and then the. General Accounting
Office, in auditing th©g©
»

accounts, looks at this decision

.<

and comes to the conclusion that it3s erroneous as a matter

of law on the basis of the decision on its face, and therefore
raw mt.it® it to the. Department of Justice with the request that
•vs look into it for the purpose of recouping money 'erroneously

31
or illegally paid, because the decision of an agency, under a
disputes clause, was not entitled to finality under the
Wunder1ich Act.
Now, that would be another way, as the Attorney General
said in his opinion of January 6, 1969, in which this could be
tested»
Q

Mr. Jaffee, what’s the risk that the Corralssion

ran hers, after the GAO 260-page memorandum, and then they
paid? if they had .gone through with the payment, who would have
taken what risk?
MR. JAFFE:

Wall, tha risk, there is a risk, Mr,

Justice Brennan, because the statutes which govern the
General Accounting Office also provide that if a payment is
illegally or erroneously made, and I won't go into the bad
faith or the other factors that assist» but just plainly the
illegally or erroneously that he may charge the accountable
officer for that payment.
Q .

Personally?

MR. JAFFE %

Personally.

Or through his bondsman.

I wish to mention in passing that this is so seldom used that
1 can find no case that’s upheld it,

absent corruption or

venality.

y

•

But, nevertheless, on its face, that is a remedy
which is available.

Q

And it is that a —

Well, isn't it a practice in government, when

32
GAO indicates disapproval of a payment about to be made, is
it the general practice to make it or does sometimes GAO
decides, or what happens?
MR, tf&FFEs The general practice isf 2 must admit#
to use discretion as the better part of valor and not pay.
He

.

, .there are innumerable circumstances in

which the agency head# having received an opinion of the
General Accounting Office# usually an advance opinion# that a
payment# if made, would be disallowed -by him in the subsequent
audit of accounts.
And# incidentally, the General Accounting Office
uses language which indicates that it’s his opinion# that it is
advisory# *1 advise”# et cetera, as he did in this case.
However# they do not pay.

But 1 submit that that's

a matter of prudence# particularly in this kind of a
situation# and they should not. pay# because it never results
in anything other than a resort to the courts# where

—* and no

one has ever contended -~
Q

Well, now# suppose there is# as was here# then#

a suit is brought? what could the Attorney General do about
the lawsuit?
MR. JAFFEx

One of two things.

He would examine# as

he did in this case, the decision — incidentally# the Attorney
General did not got into this suit at all# for any purpose# or
in any way interfere or intervene in the disputes process.

33
Q

Until the lawsuit*

ME. tf&FFS:

Q

Until the lawsuit was filed.

3?es.

MR. J&FFE; When we received the petitions that were
filed in the Court of Claims, we did with that petition
exactly what we do with every other petition, summons or
complaint which wa receive.

We obtain from the interested

agency all the background data, their advice and assistance
which we got hare, and we examine into it.

We ware aware at

that point of the action of -the Comptroller General.

We paid

no attention to it, because we knew that what they .said was
not binding in court, and that we had a statutory responsibility
to exercise a Xitig&fcive judgment.
0

Sc you could hatas confessed judgment, so to

speak?
MR.

t

Wo certainly could have, as we did in

another case not so long ago, where the GAO was not involved,

1 must admit, but where the Disbursing Officer refused to pay
tr:.. •"•voision of the Bear'd of Contract Appeals of his agency,
hacauae fee thought it was an unsound decision.
We disagreed with that Disbursing Officer and
to the entry of judgment, and It was a substantial

sum,
Mow, in this particular case, we did examine the
record, that is the record before the agency? we examined it

34
from the point of view of the evidence that was submit tact.
We examined it from the point of view of the decisions of the
Hearing Examiner, which were•not disturbed by the Atomic
Energy Commission, and we examined the decision of the Atomic
Energy Commission to the extent that it passed on any of the
/

claims •
We came to the conclusion, which, only coincidental,
was almost the same as that of the Comptroller General, that
this decision in this case did not satisfy the standards of
the Wunderlich Act.

Q

Well, tell me, Mr.Jaffe, could you have

defended simply on the basis of the provisions of the clause
that Mr. Creyke and I were discussing, without reference to
the Wunderlich Act?
MS. JAFPEt

Oh, I think we could, if we had no

Wunderlich Act, because I do not think that there is anything
in the Wunderlich Act or in the judicial precedents which would
make that kind of a contract provision tmenforcible.
However, X do want to add that the' language in this
contract tracks the language of the Wunderlich Act? it is
virtually the same.

And I call to the Court’s attention that

the Wunderlich Act is worded that in terms at ho‘provision of
.:;ny contract may limit finality only to fraud, provided,
however, that finality will attach unless the decision of
the head of an agency or a Board of Contract' Appeals.

,

So the fast that the ABC in this case was the agency
whose decision, itself? doss not make it any different at all
from that of a Board of Contract Appeals,

There’s no

immunisation from the — any greater immunization from the
head ©f the department between a Board of Contract Appeals
and the head of the agency itself.
Now? of course, the way the petitioner would have
this Court construe this contract would foe in direct contra­
vention cf the language of the Wunderlich Act,

The petitioner

contends that the disputes clause in this contract must foe
read, as he argues, as limiting the government to setting a
decision of an agency head aside only if he can show
fraud or overreaching? that the entire history, says he, which
we dispute, of the Wunderlich Act shows that the recourse to
the courts for judicial review was intended to be available
only to the contractor.
Q

Who wrote the Wunderlich Act?

MR. JAPPSs

Actually wrote it?

Actually written by the General Accounting

Office, in my opinion.
0

And this is an argument that the General

.g1.;'eg Office wrote or behalf of the government# a statute
which would limit attack on these contracts only to attacks
by the contractor?

MR, JAPPSt Well, of course, the General Accounting
office never had that in mind, as the legislative history

36

clearly shows«

Q

But it seems rather peculiar, 1 should think, -—

MR. JAFFE':
Q

Well, they —

— that the General Accounting Office would be

acting as the agent of the contractor to get such legislation.
MR, JAFFE:

The General Accounting Office repeatedly

stated to the committee that it was asking for this legislation
not only for the benefit of the contractor but because the
narrow, limited test of fraud hampered the government, and
hampered the GAO in auditing accounts.

Q

Now, the General Accounting Office, though, in

the initial dr-aft that it offered as a substitute for the
MeCarran proposal —

MR. JAFFEs
Q

Yes.

this was on the McCarran proposal, did have

store than, just an expanded basis of judicial review? it
also would have, if it had got that legislation, as X remember,
would also have had the authority itself to act as a court of
claims.
MR. JAFFE;

Right.

Wow, let me comment on that,

Mr. Justice Brennan.
The original statute as drafted by GAO, I believe,

included "unless the General Accounting Office or a court
a,

at cetera, ®fc cetera.

t'r,/r the interpretation of that clause, in my opinion,-

37
would have equated the General Accounting Office precisely as
it would a court, it would have had authority to reverse an
opinion •—
Q

Well, in any event, the GAO itself withdrew

that whan it got to the House in the succeeding —
MR, JAFFJS1

Yes,

And itself suggested & substitute

which eliminated the word® "General Accounting Office or a
court"♦

Wow, of courses, the statute speaks in terms of

judicial review, and there was never any question of access
to a court,
Q

But the expanded ground of judicial review

remained, as GAO initially wrote it in the first substitute
for the McCarraa one?
MR, JAFFE:

Yes,

And the GAO felt at that tint®, and

I submit to this Court that they were correct, that the
GAO authority would hot he hampered, that is the authority that
they wanted to have and that they thought they always did
have before this Court's decision in the Wunderlich case, that
in auditing accounts, to use a broad standard of review.
And indeed they must.

For them to determina whether a payment

is or will be illegal, or unlawful, or within the contemplation
of statute or law, they must apply the applicable principles
©£ law.
;
r

In

if tho;

i

16 principles

and the standards t© b® applied are those sot forth in the.

Wunderlich Act.
So whether or not they are -ant.toned when they audit
accounts# when they render an advance opinion, in order to
determine whether it is or will be a lawful expenditure# they
must apply the applicable law# the Wunderlich Act.
Wow# there’s no suggestion# I am sure# and none have
been made, that the Wunderlich Act in any way repealed
those provisions of the law which give to the General Accounting
Office the authority to render an advance opinion to a
Certifying Officer# as was the case here, or to .audit accounts
and to disallow items which were illegally or erroneously
paid.
Now, in a contract matter, that must be the standard
of the Wunderlich Act»
Now, X will not dwell on the legislative history,
because we believe that it supports the view that the
government has equal access to the courts with the contractor,
without question.

However, the legislative history of the

of this problem, when you say the government you mean what
entity?

What part of the government?

MR. JAPFE%
Accounting Office,

I mean any — the agency, the General
or tha Department of Justice.

I think what we're really speaking about is not who
is the only person who may speak, but who and under what
circumstances can the matter be precipitated into a court
review.

-r

Now, 2 think that that can occur in many ways.
think the most usual way would bs by failing to pay.
who is going to make that determination?

I

How,

Perhaps the nest

answer is how that determination has been made in the many
instances which have occurred in the past, prior to this case,
prior to the Langenfelder case, many cases that Judge Davis
ox the Court of Claims detailed in the Langenfelder care.
The usual way is not to pay, and who determines
that?

formally it#s the general counsel of the agency who

It doesn't

And that precipitates payment.

Occasionally the matter will be submitted to the

40

Department of Justice.

Somebody in the agency, and it has to

foe someone high up, because v?e do not accept communications
from trial attorneys or lower staff echelons, someone in
the general counsel's office or an Assistant Secretary will
write to us and say they're disturbed about an opinion, as
did NASA, as did FAA, as did several agencies.

And the

question they ask us is not to intervene- in the disputas
process, as the petitioner would have you believe? the
decision has already been rendered.

“The disputes process is

at a close.
The question is, if we don't pay, will yon defend us?
Will this withstand, scrutiny?
How, so far, unfortunately, we found that it wouldn't
withstand scrutiny.

All we could find is that if we were the

judges, we would have decided differently.

But that's no

reason for challenging, as the courts have frequently said.

I should remind the Court of a

That in this particular case, for example, the

not have ignored the matter had it been paid.

But he would

be powerless to So anything except send it to the Department

Q

It doesn’t happen very often, does it?

MR. JAPFSi Very, very seldom.
I should add here* in tis particular, case the only
real relief available was not to pay.

The reason X say that

is because prior to the completion of this contract the
all payments thereunder, at least sir. months before, the
contract was

completed, and while it was being performed, all

payments hereunder were assigned to a bank,
wonder why we speak so much about the

I therefore

— that the contractor

went out of business because of the delay in payment.
The contractor received almost -- that is, we paid
the full contract price under this contract.

These are the

extras, the things that have not yet been determined ..that they
are. entitled to payment on.

And any payment >ra decide, or is

MR. J&FFEs

Now, X had been about to speak briefly

about the legislative history.

The legislative history, of

course, as some lawyer in the field has once said, has a little
bit of very thing for everybody and therefore is a little
confusing.
What we had originally was a proposal» a Wunderlich
Act proposal, which would have included the GAO equally with
the courts.

That was deleted.

And the GAO was taken out, and

the word "court58 was taken out, but we still speak of the
judicial review.
It was quite clear, we say,from the legislative
historyt two things were quite clear.

That this access to the

r

courts for judicial review under the standards they were
setting forth was available to both parties.

The reason that

I say that it was aware is because there were bills before the
Congress, including one presented by the American Bar
Association, specifically to limit this judicial review to the
contractor.

But Congress did not accept any of those.

There were debates on whether or not this wouldn’t

be equally available to the government as well as the
contractor, end that the Congressmen indicated that they though:,
it was.
There is no suggestion that it isn’t, available to the ..,

45
and there’s certainly nothing on the face of the Act which
indicates that it is available only to the contractor.
The Act itself would seem to make that clear.

It.says "any

decision of the head of a department" and "any such decision
shall only have finality", if it is not fraudulent or capricious,
at cetera.
Mow, it doesn’t say any decision adverse to a
contractor? and X don’t think that that should be reed in,
particularly in the light of the legislative history.

It is also strange, it seems to m®, that the argument
should be made that the Wunderlich Act actually provides for
two standards;

one standard for the contractor, which covers

this entire panoply of broadened standards? and quite another
for the government.
overreaching.

The government is limited to fraud and

That is precisely what it was that the Wunderlich

Act was seeking to overcome.
As a matter of fact, if that were true, then the
language of the Wunderlich Act, which says that no provision
of any contractor shall limit any decision of the head of an
agency or by the Board of Contract Appeals to fraud would
again have to be interpolated as meaning only as against the
contractor’s complaint.

But it could be so limited as far as
/

the government was concerned.

X submit that there is nothing in the language,
nothing in the history, nothing in the logic, which would call

46
for that view.
Sithat the govezmimit should have and does
have equal access to the courts to challenge the decision of
an agency head or of a Board of Contract Appeals on the basis
set forth in the Wunderlich Act? that is, that the standards
there have not been met- that no finality should therefore
attach to the decision? and therefore no payment? if one is
ordered? should legally or lawfully be made under such a
decision.
Now, the question that’s raised:
government?

Who is the

I have answered in the only way that 1 can, the

norma3. way in which the government gets a case into court.
Now, that could be done, normally, in one of the
three ways 1 suggested.
others.

I don’t think we need look for any

That's ample protection for the government, that

payment can be made? as the Attorney General said, and w©
can seek to recoup'.:, it in a private suit of our own? if it?
in fact? was erroneous? and we would have the test in that
suit in the District Court.
Q

How — does this procedure go on ©very day in tJt a

week?
MR. JAFPB:
day in the week.

The disputes procedure goes on every

The involvement of not paying a decision of

a Board of Contract Appeals rises very rarely.

The way that —

frankly, the way in which the government9s access to the

courts has arisen in the past most frequently has been where
a contractor submits several claims to a board; the board rules
in the contractor's favor with respect to three or four of
them, and rules against hint with respect to two or three of
them,

And hess dissatisfied with the two or three which have

been adverse to him, and he institutes a suit in the Court of
Claims seeking to set aside the Board < s decision with respect
to those which were adverse, and we,

In defending, again look

at the entire record.
We come to the conclusion that tho 1-card was correct
in denying the two or three it.did, but was incorrect in
allowing two of the four that they had allowed, because it

So when you say the government must have its

MR. JAFFEt

It could.

That could be on© way.

the contract says, I don't owe you this money? and the other

Mr, Jaffe, I'm still bothered, 1 think, by your

answer to Justice Douglas's question, as to who is the
government.

What comes to me out of your explanation is that

this contractor has three tiers to overcomes

Comptroller General, and the Attorney General.
MR. JAFFE;

He really doesn't have three tiers to

contractor.

He‘needn't wait one moment for the General

Accounting Of flee., to act or consider the advance opinion, or
have any advance request from any Disbursing Officer or
Certifying Officer.

Ho can go into court immediately he

hears that the General Accounting Office views have been

x
solicited.
So the General Accounting Office,provides no tier
to him at all.

It is one means for the. government to be aware

that there may be an illegal payment about to be made, or, if
it is made, to recoup it.

That's the manner in which the

General Accounting Office-enters the picture, but it's not a
tier of review, as such,
Mow, the Department of Justice comes in, only
if an agency should decide to ask the Department, first, Will
you defend us?

Or, in this case for example, where the

51
Comptroller General has issued an opinion which he says that
this would be an invalid payment, the head of the department
could com® in and say to us, Do 1 have to listen to the
Comptroller General?

1969, have told the Agency, Your accountable officers need not

Do we have a basis for defending a suit, or for

prosecuting a suit?

In neither event do 1 think the Court should assume
that the contractor is entitled to money, any money, or any
payment until the Court has had an opportunity to scrutinise
that decision under the standards of the Wunderlich Act,
Until then, it is not an order or a decision entitled to
finality, which requires any payment»
Q

Well, I expect, Mr, Jaffe, this may be a very

cumbersome and difficult and, in terras of modern business, quite
inefficient way of doing things.

But that’s the way Congress

has ordered, 1 gather you suggest, that government business
shall be carried on in these instances?

I think that that’s the natural conse­

quence of the Wunderlich Act, and the terms of the contract

It is.

It's right in the history; so it says.

Q

Well, I don’t know who wrote the

MR, CREYKE: The Comptroller General proposed in the
82nd Congress, when the bill was under consideration, that he
be included; he was.

Strong objection was made —
;

Q

And he wrote the very bill that included him.

MR. CREYKE:
Q

Yes?

The Comptroller General wrote the very bill

that included him,
MR. CRSYKE*

Oh, yes, I thought you were speaking

of the very initial bill, Senate 2487, and that's the one I
don't know who wrote it,
Q

Eo, I don't either, and the history doesn't

Right.

words they used.
MR. CREYKEj

Yes, they did.

And here's the

letter, which I have in House Report 1380, which says in effect
that it is intended — it is not intended to either change
jurisidction or to grant any new jurisdiction, but to recognise',
the jurisdiction which he has.

Which we say is not intended.

Now, with respect to the over-all intent of the Act,
one,we don't believe that it was ever intended that a using
agency would attack its own decision by fraud.

With res­

to fraud otherwise, there are always remedies available to
the government otherwise.
But the procedure, as it has been aborted here, to
take away from the disputes process its efficacy is simply
calamitous within the operation of the system as it now works.
When a contractor signs a government contract, and he agrees
to the changes clause, and to do the work as it's changed,
and he agrees to the disputes clause and says he’ll keep right
on going at his expense, as the government interprets the

56

involved there, of those omnipotent powers being granted to
the government, the government is given the right to decision
itself .

Thank you, Mr. Jaffie.
