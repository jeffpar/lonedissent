CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments next

in Mo. 71-308, United States against Byrum.
Mr. Zina.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. ZINN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SIMMs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
State planners have long sought a method whereby
majority owners of closely held corporate stocks could maintain
control of their corporations throughout their lifetimes, but
nevertheless be able to pass on their businesses at death,
without payment of an. estate tax.
This Federal estate tax case presents an attempt
which has thus far been successful to achieve these two most
desirable goals.

Here the method employed is a transfer of

a portion of the majority owner's stock to a trust, with the
owner retaining assured lifetime control of his corporations
by

reserving the right to vote the stock he transferred in

trust, and the right to veto any sale of that stock by the
trustee.
We brought this case here on certiorari to the
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit because of our concern
with its effect on the administration of the Federal estate
tax laws.

4
The specific facts are these:

The decedent, Mr.

fymu, owned controlling stock interests in three corporation!;,.
X>ate in 1953 he created an irrevocable trust naming a bank as
trustee, to which he thereafter transferred stock in the
three corporations.

The trustee had power, until Mr. Byrura's

youngest child reached age 21, to distribute trust income and
principal to the beneficiaries in its discretion.

When the

youngest child reached age 21, separate trusts were to be
established for each child, or for the surviving issue of any
deceased child.
Each child's separate trust was to terminate when
that child reached age 35.
The trust instrument specifically provided that Mr.
Byrum would retain for his lifetime the right to vote all
unlisted stocks, such as the stock in the three corporations
ha transferred, and the right to veto any sale of that stock
by the trustee.
On page 4 of our opening brief there appears a small
chart, showing the percentage of each corporation's stock
owned by Mr. Byrum and by the trust at the time of Mr. Byrum's
death.

In the case of the first corporation, which is Byrum
Lithographing Company, you can see that the total originally
owned by Mr. Byruin was 71 percent of the corporation stock.

Ik; transferred 12 percent of the stock in trust, and retained

S3 percent in his own name.
0

Did he still retain it at his death?

MR. ZINNs
Q

Yes, sir, he did.

Was there ever any instance — X suppose there

wasn't ~~ where a sale was proposed end there was a veto?
MR. ZINNs

This case cam® on on cross motion for

summary judgment, Mr. Justice Blackmun, and the record doesn't
reveal any such instance.
The situation that obtained with Byrum Lithographing
then, so far as the record discloses, is that at all times
Mr. Byrum owned the — was able to vote 71 percent of the stock
of the corporation and, at all times until his death, was in
control of the corporation.
Looking at the second and third corporations, Graphic
Realty and Bychrome, the situation is the same.

He originally

owned 83 and 88 percent of the stock of those corporations?
transferred a portion in trust.

And, by retaining the right to

vote that stock for his lifetime and the right to veto any
sale of the stock, was assured lifetime control of those
corporations as well as Byrum Lithographing.
Q

The trust had been in existence less than six

years at the time of his death?
MR. 2INN: The trust was created in December 1950.
Q

And ha died in September of '64.

MR. SINN;

That's right.

6
And these ware a series of transfers » it wasn't,
just one transfer in trust.
ME. SINN:
Q

That's correct.

It was creation of the trust in '58 and then

a series of transfers over the ensuing years until his death.
MR. ZINNs
Q

That’s correct.

And how would the case stand if the trust had

lasted — if he’d lived another ten yeans and had transferred
all of this closely held trust to the — closely held stock
in these corporations to the trust at the time of his death»
but had retained of course the same» that the trust had had
the same provisions?
•

MR. 22NN:

So far as the United States is concerned,.

Mr. Justice Stewart, the case would be precisely the safes.

Q

1 thought you would say that? I just wanted to

be sure.
MR. SINN:
Q

Indeed, that may have been the plan.

Yes.

MR. SINN:

In order to obtain the maximum gift tax

exclusion.
So if the entire 71 percent and 83 porcent an3
88 parcent, respectively, had, at the time of Mr. Byrum.5s
death, been in the hands of the trustee, your case would siii 11
the sa-un? and your submission would still be the ^arae, woul.:
it not?

?
ME. ZINNs

Yes, it would, and I would suggest that

that would be a panacea for State planners, because -™
Q

Well, — yes.

That is what you’re now suggesting,

but —
MR. 3INI?;
Q

That's right.

— but the fact that the majority was still in

his hands at the time of his death doesn't make your case any
stronger, really, does it?
MR. 2 INN:

That’s only true in the case of the first

corporation.
Q
his hands.

All right, that a large percentage was still in
Does it?

MR. 2INN %

We don’t rely on a distinction between

whether the stock retained in his own name was enough to
control, or whether the combined right to vote the transferred
stock —
Q

If there had bean a complete transfer of all of

this stock, given to the trust in 1958, your submission would
still foe basically the same, wouldn't it?
. MR. SINNs

We’d still be here, yes, sir.

Q

Yes.

Q

Suppose he had transferred, not to the trust,

but had just sold to unaffiliated interests all or a substantial
percentage of the shares he retained initially? would that
make & differanea?

e
MR. 2 INK:
Q

Sold the stock?

Sold the stock he retained, to outside people.

Suppose he had?
MR. SIM's

In other words * suppose that he didn't have

control?
Q

Right.

MR. ZINK: Well, in the case of the first corporation,
if he got below Si percent. — SO percent ownership, we might
still be here if we could show that he had, in substance had
control, even with a smaller interest*
Q

Yovr case rests on control, then, does it not?

MR. Sim i
Q

Yes, it does.

Effective control?

MR. ZINK:

Effective control, that's right.

And if

it were less than 50 percent, it still might be effective
control.

We’d have to look at the particular facts*
Q

Well, this is the point I was leading up to.

You rest on control, and it may or may not exist, depending
on whether he had 50 percent or more?
MR. ZINK:

Right.

But In this case we don't have

that problem, Mr. Justice Powell, because there’s no question
of control.
Q
Q

I understand.

I understand.

Mr. Sinn, is the term "effective control” one

that's used in the statute or in the regulation?

9
MR. ZIKN8

No, it is not, Mr. Justice, I'm going

to get to the statute in just one moment, if I may.
0

Are you going to give us, somewhere along the

line, the definition of '’effective control”, and why it is
the controlling principal?
MR, SINNj

No, because we don't think we have to rely

on effective control in this case.

He had actual control.

That's not disputed.
But the District Court and the Court of Appeals, and
I think the respondent, concedes that Mr. Byrum was in control
of this corporation for his lifetime.
Q

But 1 took it, in your answer to the question

of Mr. Justice Powell, that you said effective control would
be equally good, it might be a weaker ease in some respects,
but 2 take it the rationale of your argument must embrace
both actual control and effective control?
MR. 5?INIt

Yes, sir.

. We will -•*- I hope to demonstrate why this was in
affect a testamentary transfer because of the retention of
control.

In this case legal control? perhaps in another

affective control.
After Mr. Byrum’s death in September of 1964, the
Commissioner asserted estate tax deficiencies against his
estate, on the ground that the stock transferred in trust was

includible in his gross estate under both Section 2036(a)(1)

10
and 2036(a)(2) of the Code.
The est ?.te of course had included in the gross
estate only the stock retained by Mr. Byrum in his own name.

The statute is set out on pages 2 and 3 of our
opening brief? and reads as followss
a'The value of the gross estate shall include the
value of all property to the extent of any interest therein
of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer (except
in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consider;,
tion in money or money'"s worth) , by trust or otherwise, under
which he has retained for his life or for any period not
ascertainable without, reference to his death or for any period,
which does not in fact end before his death:
B(1) the possession or enjoyment of, or the right tc
the income from, the property, or
”(2) the right, either alone or in conjunction with
any persons, to designate the persons who shall possess or
enjoy the property or the income therefrom.”
On cross motions for summary judgment in the DistrictCourt, the District Court granted the estate's motion and
a divided Sixth Circuit affirmed.
We begin any discussion of Section 2036 with this
Court's decision in the Q8M&Iley case six.- - years ago, and
more recently in the Gras© Estate case in 1969.

.1, Hid

in QGalley, Mr. Justice White, speaking

II
for the Court.» stated that the predecessor of Section 20 36
was, and I quote, "an important part of the legislative
policy of subjecting to tax all property which has been the
subject of an incomplete inter vivos transfer."
In Grace Estate, Mr. Justice Marshall, writing for
the Court, explained that the purpose of the predecessor of
Section 2036, and 1 quote now from 325 U.S., at 320, "was to
include in a decedent®3 gross estate transfers that are
essentially testamentary, i.e., transfers which leave the
transferor a significant interest in or control ever the
property transferred during his lifetime."
Q

Wan that a case involving reciprocal trust?

ME. ZINK:
Q

Unquote.

Yes, that was the cross trust.

Because I didn't sit in that case then.

MR. ZXNMt

Judged by these statements of purpose of

Section 2036, we think that these transfers must be considered
incomplete until the time of Mr. Byrum's death, that is
essentially testamentary.
Nothing changed with regard to corporate operations
following the transfers.
been previously.

Mr. Byrum was in control as he had

All that the beneficiaries had after the

transfers wore Cl) the right to receive such dividends as
Mr. Byrum, as controlling stockholder, determined should be
paid

(2) the right to receive the proceeds of a sale of the

stock if Mr. Byru::i agreed that the stock should ba sold, and

12

(3 )

th-3 fight to the proceeds on liquidation of any of the

corporations if Mr, Byrum voted in favor of the liquidations.
Q

Weil, what they had was the — whatever rights

beneficial stockholders have in any corporation, then, am I
correct?

Whether the owner was Mr. Byrum or Mr. Smith or

Mr. Jones.

What the beneficiaries of the trust had were what

the beneficial owners of shares in a corporation have.
Correct?
MR. 2XNI1:
Q

19m not sure I understand the —

Well, whatever those rights are is what they

had«
■MR. 55INII; Well, the statute doesn’t tax all of the
rights, all such interest, Mr. Justice, but it taxes them
where they’re transferred to trust and the transfer, in effects
is testamentary, as it is here.
Q

Well, you said the beneficiaries of the trust,

you were implying that they got very little because -MR. SIKH: That’s right.
Q

— Mr* Byrum controlled, his control over

what they got —
MR. SIKH:
Q

They got whatever he said they should.

Well, they got whatever shareholders — whatever

right shareholders have? beneficial shareholders.
MR. SSINH: Well, I would draw a distinction, I think,
between —

13
Q

And this would foe tame whether Mr. Byrum were

the owner of the majority of the stock or whether Mr. Jon
Smith were?
MR. ZIMI'Is

That's right.

Section 2036 taxes such

*

transfers, we believe, where the transferror isn't controlling.
Q

Of course we're now talking about the taxability

of Mr. Byrum's estate, but —
MR. Z INI I:
q

Co r re e t„

— you. implied that somehow or another, since

he was the owner of the corporation, that the beneficiaries
of the trust got less.
Q

I didn't follow that argument.

Could he have originally given the voting rights

to someone else, ether than retaining them?
MR. ZXBJFt

He could have given them to the trustee,

Mr. Chief Justice.
. Q

Well, I'm speaking of a third person; could ha

have given them tc a third person?
MR. ZINK:

He could have given them to a third person.

And then you're going to ask me whether — what the tax
consequences would be?
Q

In the case of the first corporation —*

I don't know whether I am or not.

MR. 2INN;

In the case of the first corporation, we'd

still be here, because he retained in his own name.
Q

Doesn't your position assume improper decisions

on his part to withhold the payment of dividends?

14
MR, SINN*

Not at all.

We think fully within the

c<oa of this fiduciary duty he could have determined. that all
of the money should foe returned to the corporation.
0

Well, there are limits on that, aren’t there?

MR. SINN: Very scanty ones, Mr. Chief Justice.

We

think the record in this case shows clearly enough how little
did go on.

If you will refer to page 25 and 26 of the

record, yon will see that the dividends that were paid on the
transfer of stock from the time of - creation of the trust unti/
Mr. Byrum's death totaled $303.50.
Q

What had it been in a comparable period before

that?
MR. 2INNs We don't knot/ that. But we do know7 in the
period immediately after Mr. Byrum's death the dividends
wont up from ten cents a share on each of the stock to two
'/.■liars a share? a twentyfold increase.

And that the dividend:

in the first year after his death were $1,498, which was somefive times what they had.been in the preceding six years.
Q

I suppose you would agree that conceivably,

possibly, that was a very unwise — could have been a very
unwise dividend decision?
MR'. ZXO* Right.

But the fact of the matter is, Mr.

Chief Justice, that so long as directors act in good faith
in determining dividend policy, there's virtually no check
on them.

15
Q

Do.'5bp.*t that apply before just as well as after?

i'vL. SXE-3:

Yes, sir. But that was precisely the

limitation on the grantor in the O8Mailey case, in which this
Court held that the power to accumulate income constitutes
the right to designate within the meaning of Section 2036,
Q

I didn't understand that as a holding of the

Court, because that wasn't the issue in that case.

What it was

was an apparent approval of what the Court recognized to foe a
rule of long standing? isn't that right?

I just read the

opinion.
MB. ZIN1J:

1 would say that it's something —• x would

agree with you — that technically it's not holding on the
other —
Q

But that's not the issue?

ME. ZXKU:
it's something

That holding presupposes

ME. Z2MII:

Q

Because that was not the issue, that had not

been questioned
■-

-

....

10
Q

— by the -other party in that case?

MR. 2IS!?;

That's right.

In any event, our point here is that the grantor in
the O8Halley case also had to act in good faith, despite the
broad grant of power that he retained to withhold or distribute,
income to the beneficiaries.

If it was shown that he was

acting out of his private interest rather than out of the
beneficiaries' interest in exercising that power, we think a
court of equity would have stepped in and could have required
a distribution.

Every trustee has © duty of good faith and a

duty of good motive.

But in order to establish an objective

.'limitation on the power to designate# we think there has to be
a more specific duty.
And nothing in respondent's brief or, for that
matter# in amici * s brief suggests that there is any objective
standard by which a corporate director's exorcise of
discretion is limited.

They can — if they decide to return

all of the corporation's profits into the business, there's l.
way that a court can step in and do anything about it, unless
you could show that the director had a bad motive.
But that's a subjective standard.
Q

Well, there can be federal income tax conee~

quencas, can there not?
MR. EXMN;
Q

In this particular case?

If there is fin unreasonable accumulation of

17
earnings?
MR. SINKt
Q

Yes.

Which motivates directors not to do so, if

they're going to run that. race.
MR. 2INK ;

X would say a couple of things about, that.

First of ally there's a $100,000 exemption from the Section
531 tax.
Q

Yes..

MR. ZINMi
a reii

tod secondly, that still doesn't prevent

.intent of all the earnings.

There’s no way that

the; Section 531 tax can check *— can ba a check on —
Q

If you reinvest —

MR. SINK:;

the policy.

If you reinvest in the

business
Q

in the plant.

MR. ZXNN?
Q

— it’s only if you sit on it.

Right. Right.

MR. ZXNN.t

tod again, we fail to see any distinction

between the limitation on the power here, and the limitation
on the power in Q*Mailey.

It's roughly the same thing.

And for that reason wa think that the trust assets are taxable
under Section 20361a)(2)„ because Mr. Syrum retained the right
to designate.
Q

Mr. 2inn.

MR. SINK?

Yes, sir.

10

Q

I'd like to ha sure I understand your position.

Ouppc ea the stock placed in the trust had
all?

20

Let's assume it were nonvoting stock.

voting rights at
So, with respect

to that trust, no problem, no issue with respect to voting»
But the grantor had retained control of the corporation through
retention of voting stock*

MB* SINlls

Would your position be the same?

We’d he here, Mr. Justice.

That15s

pretty close to Revenue ruling that —

Q

Would you still be here —

MR. 2IWN:

-- Chief Judge Phillips relied upon in

his dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals, Revenue ruling
67-54.
Q

67-54?

MR. ZINN:

Yes, and it's reprinted beginning at paga

48 of the record Appendix.
Mr. justice, our concern here is not with the
formalities, but over since this Court decided the Hallock
case, it has consistently held that estate tax clause to ba
determined by the realities of the situation.

The realities

.a^ precisely the same, whether the grantor transfers nonvoting stock in. trust or whether he transfers voting but •
retains control of the corporation.
Q

Suppose there had been no limitation on the

sole of the stock transferred to the trustee, would that nako
a difference?

19
MR. SINK:

I think that might make a difference, Mr.

Justice, if the trustee had the power to sell, and if the stock
was marketable, and if it could be shown that there was no
understanding off the record, whether express or implied,
between the grantor and the trusteei then 1 think that the
government would not raise this kind of question.
Q

But it might, if in fact the trustee had not

sold?
MR. ZINH: It might, but I would point to
Q

But only if no dividends had been paid?

MR. Z2HH:

No, that wouldn*t make any difference.

I think that, helps our case, Mr. Justice White.
0

Well, I know, but in the example.

1 mean if the

trustee doesn't sell, the only reason he doesn’t sell is
because dividends have been paid.
I mean, ha*s probably under a duty to sell if this
isn't a good investments
MR. SINKs
Q

Well, he might be under a duty to sail

Might be?

What trustee do you know of that

can hold an unproductive voting common stock for any length
of time?
MR. ZINNs Well, the trustee in amici5s ease di 1

1:

,

Without a waiver in the trust, allowing bln to

hold the family stock?

20

MR.

'•?:

Wall, -the grantor in amicias case was

the trustee, and while the facts aren't of record yet# the

deficiency notice just hadn't issued.

That stock,was '

transferred in trust in 1948# and the decedent there died in
196?.
The government has asserted that the value of the
stock transferred, at the date of the decedent’s death,.was
$24.5 million.

Now, that’s subject to question, of course,

that’s the government's valuation»
But 2 don't think it's subject to question that only
$300 of dividends was paid on that stock in the twenty years
it's been held.
Q

Well, let’s assume. — and maybe this is' the case

2 want to put to you:

Suppose the grantor transfers to a

bank and to himself as trustee,
MR.SINNs Right.
Q

— 100 percent of the stock of a corporation.

MR. ZINK: Right.
Q ,

Ant. he becomes a trustee, but the trustees are

under a duty to distribute all of the income that they rsceiv.
MR. ZINK': Right.
Q

But they happen to be, between the two of them,

100 parcant owner: of the corporation.

And as trustees they

•lave the control we've been talking about.
MR. SINKs

Yes.

21
Q

Doos this make a difference?

MR. ZINH:
Q

We5d he here.

You'd be here , even though — even though the

trustees are under a fiduciary duty as trustees that this
taxpayer in this 'case is not?
MR» SIMM;

We question whether they have more than

Ln those circumsetances, more than the good
faith fiduciary duty.
Q

Because —

Well, at least they have whatever fiduciary

duty a trustee's got?
MR* ZXNH: Well, —
Q

To produce the kind of income for beneficiaries

that trustees as’© supposed to produce.
MR, 31 Nil:

Well, maybe they’re supposed to produce

it, Mr. Justice, but the fact of the matter is that they just
don’t lreduce it.

ted 1 don’t think amici8s case is atypical,

when you have a situation like this.
Q

So you say that any time the owner of stock

makes a transfer, whether he remains as a ~ whether he’s a
trustee of whether he’s not a trustee ~
MR. ZXNNs
Q

Well —•

— as long as he’s got control, whether as a

trustees or as not; the same result?
MR. ZlHjfts Well, I'm saying that unless the —- unless

Mv has a duty to sell the stock, if a determination is made that

22
no dividend should'be paid, in the exercise of his power as
director he May determine that there shouldn't be any

MR. aiNi'i;

He may determine that the corporation has

That! s right.

is:

And so there's a conflict in duties

And we say that the way that that conflict is resolved
yes, the trustee has a duty of good faith; yes, the

trustee has a duty of ‘pure motive; bat he has no duty in those
circumstances to fairly apportion *-“
Q

You say trustees never sail unproductive stock

in closely held corporations.
MR. ZIEJHj

Well, I don't know about that.

Well, as 1 say, in this case one could

make the same argument as in amici's case; but the fact that
they didn't sell.
Q

Well, in this case he had the duty not to sell,

except for the
MR. ZINK: The trustee?
Q

except with the permission of the grantor.

That was a trust instrument under which he was operating.
MR. ZINK:

This is an easier case for the government,

23
but I would not bo prepared to concede amici's case.

I think

the facts in that case are so bizarte that it's a stronger
case for the government.

Well, you don't need to concede it or argue it,

Q
X guess.

MR. 322511«

One last word, Mr* Justice Powell, with

regard to the question of where the power to sell is given
to the trusts®, I will refer you to the Beckwith case, which is
cited in the-footnote on page 19 of our brief, involving a
situation largely like the one that you raised.
Q
yous

May 2 ask this question, while I’ve interrupted

Getting back to control, you8re familiar, I'm sure,

with the presumption applied by the SEC to the effect that a
10 percent owner is presumptively a controlling stockholder-?
would you carry ycur doctrine that far?

MR. ZINNs

1 might if the rest of the stock was

45/45, and the other two people were at loggerheads.
Mr. Chief Justice, I should like to reserve my
remaining time.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs Very 'well, Mr. Sinn.
Mr. Snyder.
OEM. ARGUMENT OF LARRY H. SNYDER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. SNYDERs
Court 5

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

24

Tha fee :rs of this case are relatively simple, and,
tc my knowledge,

;hey*re not in dispute•

However, I think there

is some danger that cr;. ? of. the more important facts may be
obscured by rather extensive citations of previous cases in
some of the arguments.
- So, at the risk of repeating some of the facts that
are before you, I would like to outline briefly some o£ the
more important elements of the Byrum trust.
Counsel has told you it's an irrevocable trust for
the children of the decedent, and that a national banking
corporation is trustee.
The trust instrument provides that until the youngest
of these minor children reaches 21, no distributions from
either — let's put it this way, that the distributions from
either corpus or income are entirely within the discretion
of the trustee, having due regard for the education and the
maintenance and the care for the children.
Upon the youngest child's reaching 21, the terms of
the trust provide that the trust corpus is to be divided into
separate trust funds for each of the living or deceased
children of the decedent, and that each such fund is to
continue until that beneficiary reaches the age of 35.
If, prior to reaching age 35, a beneficiary has an
emergency such as an extended illness or some other need,
the trustee is authorized to pay to or on behalf of that

25
bsncficary, from either corpus or income.

Otherwise the

income is to he accumulated and to be distributed at the
termination of the trust.
Decedent did retain the right to vote the stock,
the unlisted stock held in the trust corpus.

And it's true

that there was, at the time of the decedent's death, unlisted
stock in three corporations, and that the right to vote this
stock, together with the right to vote the stock owned by the
decedent, gave him the majority voting interest in these
three corporations.
Q

Mr. Snyder, does the record show who drew this

trust instrument?
MR. SNYDER:
Court's interested.
Q

No, sir.

But X know who did, if the

My law partner did, before I joined them.

Before what?

MR. SNYDER:

Before I was associated with my law

partner.
Q

Was Mr. Byrum an officer of the corporation?

MR. SNYDERs

Yes, I believe he was an officer of all

three corporations»
Q

Salaried officer?

MR. SNYDER:

Yes.

The government has made the principal issue in this
case a question of whether this right to vote stock —
Incidentally, let me follow through:

Was Mr,

26
Byrum a director of the trustee bank?
MR. SNYDERf
Q

No.

Was fee a customer otherwise, than a trust

customer?
MR» SNYDER:
Q

I'd have to guess at that; I don't knew.

The record doesn't show?

MR. SNYDER:

I didn't know Mr. Byritra„

X doubt very

much — I know he wasn’t a director; but X9m in no position
to know whether he was a customer of that bank or not.
As 3: started to say, the government has made the
principal issue in this case the question of whether this
reserved, power to vote this stock constituted the right to
designate the parsons who shall possess or enjoy this
**• ‘

property, or the ;.nccme from the property, the stock, within
the meaning of Section 2036(a)(2).
The argument is, of course, that the right to vote
this stock gave him the right t© dictate the corporate
dividend policies of these three corporations, and therefor#
to regulate the. flow of dividend income to the trust.
Now, assuming for the moment that decedent had this
absolute right to dictate a corporate dividend policy, it
by no means follows under the circumstances of Byrum, at least,
that he had the power to shift the income of this stock to
beneficial enjoyment said by the cases to be the basis for
tm

aider Section 2036(a) (2).

21
As indicated earlier, the income from this stock
did not vest, in the sense that it was not payable as earned,
it was to foe accumulated unless there were certain emergencies
or other conditions shown, at which time it was with the
discretion of the trustee to pay this income.
If that condition or those conditions did not
@3dtst, then the income was accumulated, added to the corpus of
the trust, and paid to the beneficiary on the termination.
We submit that this indirect conditional power to
effect distributions of income from the trust does not
constitute a right to designate who shall receive the trust
income.
The right to designate, the term "right to designate"
we feel implies some sort of a permissive choica between
potential income beneficiaries —
Q

Well, do you accept the proposition that a

trustee’s power to accumulate or not is equivalent — is the
right to designate: within the meaning of the statute?
In other words, the 0*Mailey — what O’Malley has
said to stand for by the government.

Do you accept that as a

standard for it?
ME. SNYDERs
Q

I accept that, yes.

You do?

ME, SNYDERt

I think O’Malley is distinguishable.

0?Malloy was a direct power.

23

Q

Yes.

MR. SNYDER;

In 0*Mailey, as I recall Q9Mailey,

the set' :law ' trustee had the —
Q<

— power to accumulate.

And the Court said

-Lt-rt was the power--to- designate with:'
statute.
MR. SNYDER:
permissive choice.
Q

Thors it was the conscious,, the

Sat' law had the power to —

Yot: do being by accepting that, but then you

distinguish this situation?
MR* SNYDER:
Q

I'd like not to accept it, but it’s law.

You think you’re stuck with it?

MR. SNYDER;

1 think 2 am.

So we si bmifc that there isn't in this case, and the
facte of Byrum, this right to designate which predicates tax
under Section 203£(a)(2), at least if the terms of the
statute are to have any meaning at all.
Q

Mr. Snyder, I've fallen off the wagon along

the way some place.

Prior to age 21, there is no accumulation

direction, I take it?
Prior to age 21 —
MR. SNYDER;

No, sir.

Prior to age 21 — well,

it ~~

Q

Everything is discretionary distribution?

ME* SNYDER;

It's a discretionary distribution, that's

29
right.
Q

After the youngest reaches 21, then there is

trie direction to accumulate except in conditions of emergency.
MR. SNYDER:

Yes, sir.

But the discretion to

distribute income from —~ or corpus from the trust before the
youngest child reaches 21, you. will further read in this:
“with due regard ., for education, maintenance and care” of
the child or children.
So the question has not arisen under the Byrum trust
that

it would seem to me that under the -- and I think this

is the way it*s interpreted, that it is accumulated unless
tt ■ trustee determines in its discretion that there is a,:..seed
for distribution of either income or corpus for educational
needs or for maintenance or for care of that child or the
children.
Q

2 suppose that if the stock had been given, but

the trust instrument had said:

I retain the income from the

stock for my lifetime — that stock would be includable in
his estate?
MR. SNYDER: As far as I*m concerned, it would be.
yes.
Q

And if the trust instrument said:

I will pay to

you what part of the income from the stock that I feel
inclined to pay you? I may pay you 100 percent of it or I may
pay you 50 percent of it.

That would be the same result,

30
wouldn't it?
MR. SNYDER:

Are you talking now — who is the

trustee in this instance?
Q

Well# an independent trustee.

Mr. Byrum gives

this stock to the* bank as trustee# but says;

I'm going to —

MR. SNYDER: • Oh# the terms of the
Q

how much of the income I keep is up to me.

MR. SNYDER;

Mr. Byrum has reserved this power to

determine what amount —
Q

Or he says;

I may pay you 100 percent all the

time, but -MR. SNYDER:

Or it may not be.

X would say under

those terms that it was taxable# and includible in the estate
of the decedent.
Some may not agree with me# but I don't see how
that could be held not to be taxable in that case.
Speaking her© whether the income is definitely ~
Q

Well, he said;

I won't keep any of it for

myself# but X retain the power to have some of it channeled
to somebody else besides you# Mr. Trustee.
MR. SNYDERt Well# of course, we keep narrowing that.
1 wo:Id think# even in that case# it would he still a taxable
transaction.
Q

Yes.

Kb, SNYDER: But here he's unequivocally desparted

from any interest in this income in this stock whatsoever.
Q

But he does have to retain the power to direct

that the money shell be used in the corporation?
MR. SNYDERs Well, fca does have a majority voting
interest in the corporations, and I think that's a point that
should be considered.

Because, contrary to the position of

the government in this case, I disagree that this gives, or
gave Mr. Byrum the right to dictate dividend policies to suit
his personal interest.
Under the law of Ohio and under the general corpora­
tion law, ha stood in a fiduciary relationship to these
corporations and to all the stockholders of the corporations,
and significantly in all three of these corporations there was
a minority stockholder outstanding — or minority stock
interest outstanding, who was not related to Mr. Byrum, was
not.a member of his family. .
We submit that he could not have regulated the
dividend flow from these corporations to suit his personal
interest, his private purpose, without violating his position
of trust.
And the question arose as to what objective standard
is there to hold the majority stockholder and the directors to;
yWl the objective standard is this, I think quite clearly, and
D is is corporation law, is that the stockholders are entitled
to the profits of the corporation other than those profits

32

which ara reasonably needed for the business.
hnd the question of what profits are reasonably
needed for the business is a question that's answered constantly
by the courts.

&i& it is, of course, the very question which is

involved in the corporate accumulated earnings tax, which was
referred to by Justice Stewart,
So there very definitely is an objective standard
to which a majority stockholder is held.

Indeed, in many

respects 1 think it*s more objective, more restrictive than
is somt of the — are some of the standards supposedly
imposed upon trustees»
Quite clearly, it is not a matter of the good faith
of the majority stockholder or of a majority or of the board

of trustee®.

There's an objective standard.

They are

obligated to pay out the profits of the corporation, unless
••.-.hero is a reason, a business need, to retain these profits.
Q

. Snyder, what do you think was the purpose

of it?* Byrusa in retaining these powers?
MR. SJSYDSRs Well, 1 think the purpose of' Mr. —
t the purpose of Mr. Byrusa — understand,
X-did not know him and was not around when the trust was
created — 1 think his purpose was to attempt to hold the
corporation together.

1 think a small corporation is at an

citrons disadvantage for an owner having an interest in small
cec.porationc over a larger corporation.

You can give extensive

33

L’.ook to the large listed corporation away without the danger
of having the corporation collapse.‘this was a small, everyday kind of a business, and
I think lie was concerned about the business judgments the
bank would make or a successor trustee, which would have to be
a corporation.
So in answer to your question, I think he was
concerned about the business judgments that might occur if the
right to vote his stock is given to the national bank.
Frankly, I don't agree with him, I think that — 1
don’t know how it is other places, but in Columbus, Ohio, he
probably didn’t have to do that.

I5m sure the bank would

have called him and said, Mr. Byrum, how do you want us to
vote this stock?
But that isn’t our case, unfortunately, he did retain
the right to vote this stock.
But focusing again on the statute, which we can’t
get away from, Section 2036(a)(2), I don’t really think, in
t he circumstances of Byrum, that there is any shifting of
corporate income, or rather of dividend income by the payment
or the withholding of dividends.
If dividends are declared, they are paid, under tha
terms of this trust, unequivocally to the trust.

Mr. Byrtira had

nothing to do with it. They were subject to being withdrawn
under the terms of the trust, he had no control of that.

34
If dividends were withheld as a result of legitimate
how can you say there's any shifting of

iiness
incomeV

If they were withheld partially or totally because

of his private motives, then the minority stockholders had
redress in the courts.
ted, indeed, under those circumstances I think the
trustee himself would be obligated to take action, because,
ter all, he is representing the stockholders and beneficiaries
of this trust.
Q

What if Mr. Byrum had been, himself, the

trustee? would that have made your case stronger or weaker?
MR. SNYDERr

Q

In addition to the ~

In addition to everythin- else, what if he had

been a co-trustee?
MR. SNYDER:
casa.

I don't think it would have changed my

I don't thank it would particularly help it? but I

don't think it would damage it, either.

Which is not a —

it's a rather equivocal answer.
Q

No., well, I think you're probably —

MR. SNYDER:

I don’t see that the situation would

change.
Q

The government agrees with you on that.

MR. SNYDERs
Q
i

[Laughing]

Yes.

It would bring us a little closer, factually,

the laaig ■ r. v

Northern Trust case, wouldn’t it?

35
MR* SSr/r/SKs

Yes, 1 think it would.

And I think

really that Byrum rises and falls on the Relnecke, because
Byrum is, after all, no more than an administrative power.
Byrum had no more than an administrative power.

As a matter

of fact, it was an indirect administrative power*
Q

Of course Relnecke was under the old statute,

wasn’t it?
MR. SNYDER:
Byrum is this

Yes, it was.

But the issue common to

well, let n© back up.

The specific question in Relneoke was whether ti-os-:..
powers to settle or to supervise the investments of the trust
or vote the stock held in trust, whether this constituted the
gift of the corpus of the trust, a gift intended to takes eff
at or after death.
Now, the rule of Relnecke is that this kind of
administrative power did not delay possession or enjoyment,
did not delay the vesting of possession or enjoyment. The
question is here, does the same kind of a power cause a
shifting"of possession or enjoyment. And by a parody of
*•
reasoning, if it does not constitute a delay of possession or
enjoyment, it doesn’t constitute a shifting-of possession or
enjoyment.
I think that R-sinecke and all the eases, lower court
cases that have been decided after Relnecke and followed
. ..

elv. ,

stand fc.i a complete bar to the position of the

36

government here.

They havs, as you point out# attempted to

discount it. because it was enacted before the predecessor to
Section 2036(a)(2); but the fact of the matter is there's a
common thread in Reinecke and in Byrum.

And Rain®eke cannot be

dismissed.

Q

One last question and I'll stop.

any chance a reversion here in Mr. Byrum?

Was there by

What If he survived

all of the issue?
MR. SNYDER:
Q

No# there wasn't.

All right•

MR. SNYDER:

The —

That’s good enough.

~ specific provision saying that there

shall be no revision, I can't pick it out of the record for
you now; but it's a part of the trust instrument -Q

1 was having trouble finding it.

MR. SNYDER:

— and there is no possibility of a

revert in this case.
To this point, discussion has bean about the Section
2036(a)(2) issue.
of Section

The government also raises the question

the applicability of Section 2036(a)(1).

I

think the argument in support of its position is unpersuasive
on its face, and 1* don't intend, at this oral argument, to try
to add to the briefs on this question, unless there are some
specific questions.

2 would like to direct attention just briefly to
id... government's

a ply brief.

It seems to me in its reply brief

31

tie government backs off from its earlier position.
They tate a new tack and say that actually Byrum is
disposed of by the precedents of three cases decided by. this
Court, the one being the 0♦Hailey case that we've discussed her-.:
and the other is

Commissioner vs. Estate of.Holmes, and Lober

"m. U.-S.f and also suggestsr or so it seems to me, that we
didn’t cite these cases because we were trying to avoid them,
And we didn’t cite them? but we’re net trying to avoid them.
Because on this point we agree with the government, and think
these three cases do invite comparison with Byrum.
We’ve compared O’Malley.

As you will recall, in

Holmes and in Labor, the sot law reserved the right to terminate
the trust in those two situations before their specified
termination date, and thereby to cut off the contingent
remainder interest.
And as compared to Byrum, we think clearly here in
Lobsr and in Holmes is the situation where the set law held
a conscious, permissive, and open choice? he had an open
power to directly affect the beneficiaries of those two trusts.
This is not the case in Byrum.

The government has

to look to seme subjective consideration about stock
manipulation or dividend manipulation in order to get to where
it is now.
We submit that this ought not be made the basis of
taxation

The government has alsof somewhere in one of its
briefs, indicated that if Byrum was not reversed# that there
will be a great deal of litigation to follow.

1 think, frankly

just the opposite is true.' 1 think it’s been demonstrated by
the argument here today that. Byrum is just one step in the
government's plan to expand Section 2036.

And 1 suppose then

2038.
Because if I understood correctly the argument here#

1 don't think even a trust will stand in the way of a
government search to tax these transactions.
And I would simply say to you in conclusion that
if these are situations# if Byrum represents a situation that#
on equity# dictates that there should be a tax, I don't think
it is# but assuming that that5 s true, then I submit to you
it's for the Congress to enact the statutes to tax*

It's

not taxable under the present laws.
And I submit# in all due respect# it should not be
made taxable by this Courts but should be left to the Congress.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you# Mr. Snyder.
Mr. 3imi# do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. 2CT# ESQ.#
OK BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. limit

Yes# Mr. Chief Justice# I do.

Three points.

First# if this Court affirms the

39
decision below, I venture to suggest that, in the absence of

further : >gislative change, it will be a rare case indeed when
stoeh in a closely held corporation is subject to the estate
t&K.
I don51 think this is consistent *»~
Q

Well, stock in a closely held corporation is

transferred in trust to somebody else, you mean?
MR, ZIEJK::

Well, if you can do it this way, Mr.

Justice, and keep control throughout your lifetime, 1 don't
see why you'd transfer it to an independent trustee.
I would suggest only that this is totally incompatible
.with the congressional intent.

I would refer the Court to

Section 303 of the Code, which provides a special redemption
provision for the payment of death taxes and administrative
expenses, and is usually applicable only in the case of stock
of closely held corporations.
1 would refer also to Section 616S of the Code,
which provides that where the bulk of an estate is made up of
stock of a closely held corporation, the estate tax may foe
paid in ten installments, rather than 15 months after death.
X would like to return, if X may, to Mr. Justice
White's query regarding the duties of trustees.

I would agree

with him that where the trustee has only those powers necessary
under State law, that is that they be confined in investment
to the legal list that he has the duty to apportion fairly

40
the income beneficiaries and the remaindermen.
But yon can take gradations of that case, and
first you can give: him the power to go beyond the legal list
end that gives him some more latitude in shifting the
beneficial enjoyment of income, as —
Q

But just what if he*s subject to the most

prevailing rule that he has to act like a prudent trustee?
MR. SIM’s Well, I think it would, but these additional
powers, Mr. Justice, are put into the trust instruments, and
they go so far as to say -Q

Well, X understand that, but I just asked you

about an ordinary trustee.
MR. 2INI':

If he has only the powers to invest —

talking about the investment power — to invest in property
.

.

!

•

on the legal list, we wouldn’t say that he has the right to
designate.

But when he can go beyond that, and go beyond —
Q

X know, but however broad the powers you give in

a trust, whether he has to go on a legal list or whether he

has to take bonds' or common stock, it’s still subject
normally, unless there's some specific provision in the trust

~~ that doesn’t give any power to hold a

common e todi *

41
MR. ZINM:

Well,, it may give power, I think that it

could give power to invest, let's say, —
Q

Well, we *11 have to have an exchange of briefs

under the State lav? sometime.
MR. 2IKM:

X would like to make one last point.

We rely also on Section 2036(a)(1) of the Code.

We say that

the decedent here, retained the enjoyment of the transferred
property, and we think again the Court's realistic approach,
that has been applied since Hallook, should be applied here.
If one has a bond of ATST, obviously the essence of
enjoyment of that bond is the income from the bond.

If one

has an oil painting, the essence of enjoyment of the oil
painting is having it hang in one's home.
In the case of a closed corporation, the essence'
of enjoyment is controlling that corporation, setting one's
own salary, setting one's own fringe benefits, withint limits
to be sure, but sotting them nonetheless.

And I would, in

closing, refer the Court to the quotation from Professor
O'Neal, which we have set out at some length on pages 24 and
25 of our brief.
Thank you, Mr. Chief «Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Zina.
Thank you, Mr. Snyder.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2s33 o'clock, p.m., the case was
submitted.]
