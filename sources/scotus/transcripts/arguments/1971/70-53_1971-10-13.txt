MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Stone, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICKARD B. STONE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. STONE;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
This case, which is on direct appeal from the United
States District Court for the Southern District of West
Virginia, is in a somewhat unusual posture, in that a single­
judge District Court has declared unconstitutional Section 224
of the Social Security Act.
In the more normal instance, of course, an adjudica­
tion that a Federal statute is unconstitutional would originate
and direct appeal would be taken from a three™judge court.
This Court has held, however, in a closely simileo:
context, in Flemming v. Nestor reported at 363 U.S., and in
other cases as well, that a three-judge court is not mandatory
under 28 U.S.C. 2282, when an action based on the alleged
unconstitutionality of the Federal statute does not seek to
enjoin the operation of a statuto icy scheme but merely to
require the payment of sonte benefit afforded by that scheme.
And the; Court has invariably entertained direct appeals in

these circumstances *
No question has been raised by the other side as to
jurisdiction, and I take it that there is none.
In this case the provision in question, Section 224
of the Social Security Act, provides that social security
disability benefits which correspond roughly to lost earnings
resulting fromnthe claimant's disability must be reduced
according to a fairly complex formula, by virtue of the
recipient's simultaneous receipt of periodic workmen's
compensation benefits under a State or Federal Workmen's
Compensation plan.

In the ordinary case, of course, it's the

State plan.
The offset provision only applies, for purposes
relevant here, if the total of the claimant's social security
disability benefits and his workmen's compensation benefits
exceed 80 percent of his average monthly earnings, and that's
gross earnings without taking into account tax computations,
prior to injury,
Q

Over any particular period?

MR. STONE: Excuse me?
Q

Over any particular — 80 percent of what

earnings?
MR. STONE:

The average monthly earnings as computed

on a five-year period.
And benefits are only reduced insofar as they exceed

5
80 percent of those earnings.

And of course the actual effect,

for anyone whose tax status puts hire? — causes him to pay
income tax in excess of 20 percent of his gross salary?
actually it comes out even with the 80 percent, it comes out
with more in take-home pay than he; had prior to his injury.
The appellee in this case, Mr. Belcher, became
disabled in 1968 and was awarded $330 a month in social
security disability benefits, without regard to any workmen's
compensation, as the Secretary had no notice of his receipt of
workmen's compensation at that time, and that award was made
in October of 1968.
Three months later, the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare notified Mr. Belcher that his federal
bensfits would be reduced by $104 a month because of his
simultaneous receipt of $203 per month in State workmen's
compensation benefits.
This scheme is quite simple, without the offset Mr.
Belcher would have received a total of $534 in social security
and workmen's compensation benefits, which would have been 100
percent of his prior gross earnings.

And as a result of the

offset his benefits totaled $430 or exactly 80 percent of his
average prior earnings.
Mr. Belcher requested a hearing to challenge the
reduction in his federal benefits, and a hearing was held be­
fore a Hearing Examiner, at which the appellee was represented

6

by an attorney, who I believe represents him here in this
Court today.
The Hearing Examiner upheld the reduction, and this
ruling became, in the normal course of HEW administrative
rulings, the final decision of the Secretary of HEW.
Appellee then brought suit in the United States
District Court under Section 405, 42 U.S.C. 405(g), to review
the Secretary's administrative decision.
I take it that at no point in the court below or in
the administrative process has Appellee denied any aspect of
the factual or legal basis which underlay the Secretary's
determination that Section 224 applied to him in precisely the
manner in which HEW applied it, nor has Appellee raised any
question whatsoever as to the procedural rights, such as an
evidentiary hearing, which have been fully afforded to him.
His sole contention and sole ground of the decision
in the District Court below was that it is unconstitutional,
as a substantive matter, for Congress to reduce social
security disability benefits by virtue of workmen's compensation benefits.

In upholding the appellee's claim, the court

below stands alone and is at odds with eight other District
Courts, at least eight other District Courts that have
routinesly ruled on this question, and with a recent decision
of the Sixth Circuit court of Appeals, which has upheld the
constitutionality of Section 224.

7
Now, the court arrived at its decision that Section
224 is unconstitutional on essentially two grounds.
The first of these grounds, I believe, can be dealt
with rather briefly, and I think reflects a misconception of
certain decisions of this Court which ought to be prettyreadi Xy apparent here.
In Goldberg v. Kelly, at 397 U.S. 254, this Court
held that when the administrators of a State welfare program -■
in that case it was the Aid for Dependent Children program —
determined that a particular recipient no longer qualified for
benefits tinder the statutory standards governing that program,
those benefits cannot be cut off until the recipient has been
given some sort of an evidentiary hearing.
This Court reasoned in Goldberg that a welfare
recipient in the AFDC program has at least a sufficient right,
whether you call it a property right or whatever you call it,
in those benefits so that it violates standard notions of
procedural due process to cut off those benefits summarily
without any kind of a proceeding.
Q

And there is no claim here, as I understand it,

that there was any deficiency in procedural due process?
MR. STONE:

No, no claim whatsoever, Mr. Justice

Brennar.
It may be said, I suppose, that what Goldberg did
was to put to final rest a theory that really the government

8
had not attempted to make in the welfare context for some time,
that those benefits are really a privilege rather than a right,
and that that automatically cuts off any procedural difficulty
in simply taking them away.

And I think that that doctrine

has been laid to rest, and those abstractions, happily, are not
at issue here.
However, this District Court, through a process that
is not entirely elaborated and which is somewhat mystical to
me, reasons on the basis of Goldberg v. Kelly that Congress
cannot build into the statutory formula for computing social
security disability benefits, which it analogizes to welfare
benefits, any circumstances which would reduce the maximum
allowable benefit.
Now, without going into the applicability of Goldberg
v. Kelly to social security programs, a question which will
soon be before this Court, on which certiorari was granted
yesterday, I gather, I think it is safe to say that Goldberg v.
Kelly, which dealt entirely with procedural rights not in
question here, in no way implies a limitation on the legisla­
tive authority to devise a reasonable substantive formula for
determining the proper amount of social security benefits owed
to any claimant.
In other words, from Goldberg v. Kelly, which, if
applied to this case, I suppose might preclude HEW from cutting
out the claimant's benefits without hearing, it is many very,

9

very long steps to the notion that that claimant has a veste(3
interest if the maximum amount of benefit which the statute
ever even potentially afforded to hint, or the notion that
Congress can attach no other qualifications to the statutory
standard which governs the amount of benefits owing to the
I

claimant.
Q

And HEW couldn't do anything about it?

MR. STOKE:
0

Excuse me?

Assuming they had a hearing, they had lawyers,

and they had everything else; they couldn't do anything but
just what they did, is that right?
MR. STONE: That's right.

That's right, Mr. Justice

Marshall, this is the statutory standard, and it is the
statutory standard which Mr. Belcher brings to question here,
and on which the district judge ruled.
As a matter of fact, it shows in the record that the
— this hearing process was, I suppose, essentially a little
useless, since the ground that was being claimed was the
unconstitutionality of the statute, and the Hearing Examiner
noted several times that you don't seem to bring into question
anything about your applicability to jfche statute.
Now, it's interesting to note, just to put this into
perspective, that when disability benefits were first introduced
into tie Social Security program in 1956, recipients were
required to offset the full amount of workmen's compensation

10
benefits regardless of whether the total of disability and
workmen's compensation exceeded any specified limit.

That

provision was temporarily repealed in 1958, and then re-enacted
in 1965, with the current proviso that the benefits will not
be reduced unless the total of the tv?o types of programs equals
80 percent of prior earnings.
Q

Why do you think there was this variation in

Congressional treatment?
MR. STONE:
Q

The legislative history —

You talked about --

MR. STONE:
Q

Yes, we talked about --

— infrequency behind the repeal, but why was

it put back in?
MR. STONE:

It was repealed in 1958 essentially

because there was testimony in legislative hearings to the
effect that there really x^ere not that many instances of
duplication.

I point out that the workmen's compensation

program has very much expanded since then.

It was thought

that the offset was somewhat experimental when it was passed
in 1956.

In 1958 Congress was persuaded in some way that there

simply weren't enough instances of duplication to merit having
to go through the administrative difficulty of enforcing these
offset provisions.
Now, between 1958 and 1965 there were volumes and
volumes of testimony, to which we refer in our brief, to the

11
effect that in fact there was a serious amount of duplication.
The State workmen's compensation coverage had grown by leaps
and bounds, and that this duplication was posing a serious
problem both from the point of view of purposes of the Social
Security Act, which I shall discuss shortly, and from -Q

Wasn't there, Mr. Stone, an increase in State

workmen's compensation benefits over that period?
MR. STONE;

An increase in the number of — the

.mount of State coverage as well in the amount of benefits -Q

Yes.

MR. STONE;

— provided.

Now, I think it is also worth noting that, though
I think it is quite clear that Congress did not have to do so,
it did in fact restrict the offset provision contained in
Section 224 to persons whose injuries occurred after the date
of the statute and thus who had not come to rely upon the
receipt of a certain amount of income, which would then be,
later on, lowered.
Appellee's injury occurred in 1968, and so that in
order to attack the application of Section 224 in his case, he
must argue, as I suppose he does, either that the original
Section 224 was unconstitutional in its inclusion of an offset
provision, or that the temporary repeal of that provision in
some way forever precluded Congress from restoring an offset or
from reducing the maximum allowable benefit with respect to an

12
individual claimant.
I think it is net an exaggeration, and does not need
much elaboration, to say that the holding of the court below
on this point that Congress cannot, in effect, include an
offset provision in this kind of statute or reduce benefits
which are theoretically potential in the statute would throw
into chaos a great number of the social security and welfare
programs in force today, virtually all of which, by necessity,
compute their benefits in terms of offset in reductions which
are geared to the legislative view of need, and which are
designed to provide the most effective distribution of limited
funds.
Q

On that theory, why wouldn't Congress have an

offset for any kind of private return?
MR. STONE:

Well, that's exactly what I'm getting

into new, Mr. Justice Blackmun.
The second ground which the District Court relied
upon, and which appellants raise to invalidate Section 224 is
based upon the claim that Section 224 discriminates
invidiously between workmen's compensation — recipients of
workmen's compensation benefits, whose social security
disability benefits may be reduced in certain circumstances,
and recipients of any other type of relief, such as tort
recovery and private insurance proceeds whose social security
disability benefits are not thereby reduced.

13

Now, with respect to this argument, which I suppose
is really the key argument in the case, 1 would like, at the
outset, to reiterate two very well-known and related equal
protection concepts, v/hich have been repeatedly affirmed by
this Court, and which are quite clearly, I would even say
perhaps classically applicable to the circumstances of this
case.
One of these is the concept that legislative
reforms, such as Congress had in mind in the offset provision
of Section 224, is not invidiously discriminatory merely
because it does not go far enough.

In other words, even if the

reasons which Congress had in mind when it formulated the off­
set provision, such as to avoid excessive benefits and
encourage the rehabilitation of workers, even if those reasons
are equally applicable to recipients of other kinds of
disability recovery ~ and I will show shortly that Congress
did not believe that they were equally applicable -- Congress'
failure to require the offset of these other benefits doss not,
by itself, render Section 224 unconstitutional.
This Court's, I suppose, classic statement of that
was Williamson v. Lee Optical Company, at 348 U.S., in which
the Court said that the reform may take one step at a time,
addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most
acute to the legislative mind.
In tills case, the legislative history, which we have

14
referred fco at length in our brief# shows, I think, clearly that
the problem which was most acute in Congress' mind was in fact
the high percentage of disability recipients whose simultaneous
workmen's compensation benefits brought their combined receipts
— from those two sources — well above their pre-injury
salaries and incomes.
And I guess it's natural enough that Congress would
have focused primarily on workmen's compensation, since these
programs have really become very, very widespread, are now
in operation in all States and jurisdictions of the United
States; and in many States are in fact compulsory.
Q

What about the argument that this man had

casualty insurance?
MR. STONE:
Q

Well, the —

He would get both?

MR. STONE:

If he has casualty insurance or indeed

receives from any kind of program other than a workmen's
compensation program, he would get them both.

And I am about

to explain —
Q

Would you then go into that?

MR. STONE:
Marshall.

I am just about to do that, Mr. Justice

That will be the bulk of the rest of my argument,

in fact.
Just to bear in mind the second, and this is perhaps
the most important concept applicable in this area altogether,

15

is that in a context which does not involve what this Court
has called ftin&amental constitutional rights, and a context in
which the classification is not suspect in any grounds, for
example, of race or religion, which I clearly take it that no
one claims that this classification is.
In that context a statutory classification is not
invalid merely because it is rough or imperfect in some
respect, but only if that classification cannot be rationally
justified on any ground whatsoever.

This Court has quite

recently applied that notion in the area of social welfare in
Dandridge v. Williams, cited at 397 U.S., and of course in
Flemming v. Nestor, at 383 U.S.
In Dandridge, the Court held valid under the equal
protection clause a statutory scheme which premised eligibility
for assistance under the Aid for Dependent Children program
on the basis of the number of dependent children, but then set
a maximum amount of benefit that could be recovered regardless
of the number of children.
And I submit that this case, in which the offset
provision in question is not even applicable unless the very
standard of need which Congress has defined, which is 80 percent
of prior earnings, has been met.

It is considerably easier to

decide, really, on both of the grounds raised by the appellees
in the court below than is Dandridge v. Williams, and is far
easier to decide than Flemming v. Mesfcor.

16

Indeed, I think that appellees in the court below
raised a number of interesting questions with respect to what
Mr. Justice Marshall has just asked.

A number of interesting

questions with respect to the wisdom of Congress' decision to
apply Section 224 to recipients of workmen's compensation
only.
But I think that their arguments have in no way cast
doubt upon the constitutionality of Section 224, because the
abundant legislative history in this area shows that Congress
indeed had a perfectly plausible, even if debatable, rationale
for singling out duplicating benefits arising from workmen's
compensation programs.
Q

Does the history show that Congress addressed

any attention to these other things, casualty awards and so
on?
MR. STONE: What it shows, Mr. Justice Brennan, it
shows light reference, some reference to these other problems,
and we have cited those in our brief.

Its primary focus was

on the workmen’s compensation problem, but I think it is
important to not© that the reasons why it especially wanted
to avoid duplication in the workmen's compensation area are
not applicable to these other areas.

So that Congress did

focus on certain specific reasons which would not have been
applicable to the other areas.
At every stage of the history of this provision,

17
Ongress considered volumes of testimony to the effect that if
excessive duplication of benefits were allowed*, many States
vould eliminate or seriously curtail the coverage of their
workmen's compensation programs.
And the reason for this is that the States will
inevitably want to avoid excessive duplication and to encourage
rehabilitation.

And that theory would not be true of fch©

disabled workers themselves.

It’s perfectly natural that the

disabled workers themselves are’perfectly happy to get better
benefits after their injury than before.

They are not going

t> have any particular interest in rehabilitation, really,,
oily the State administering a State-run program is going to be
witching out for that interest.
So that alternative routes to federal coverage will
rsally only be cut off in areas which are governed by the

Spates.
Q

Mr. Stone, if this decision would stand as it is

row, is it conceivable that one response of the States might
te to just adopt this type of a statute in their workmen’s
compensation programs, and require a deduction of any amount
received from Social Security?
MR. STONE:
Chief Justice.

It's possible that they could do that, Mr.

The regulations, incidentally, the HEW

regulations quite clearly provide for that circumstance.
are on© or two States 'which already do that.

And in those

There

18

circumstances the benefits are hot offset.

State workmen's

compensation benefits are not offset if the State itself has
an offset provision geared to the federal program.

Otherwise

you would get involved in an endless roundabout argument that
would have no conclusion, and I guess Congress just took it
upon itself to — and HEW took it upon itself to foreclose
that possibility.
Q

It's certainly a logical thing, if this sort of

thing was very widespread, that with the States wider financial
pressure, they would rather have the deduction the other way,
than as decided by the District Court here.
MR. STONE: That's right.

That's right.

I would add another rationale which we illustrate in
our brief, is that Congress has really, from the inception of
the Social Security program, attempted not to discourage
potential claimants from procuring protection through private
means, such as insurance.

t -

It appears that this consideration, the interest
in maintaining other alternative methods to federal protection,
has really outweighed Congress8 interest —• with respect to
private insurance, tort recovery, and so on, has outweighed
Congress' interest in avoiding duplicating benefits.
Indeed, if you take as the over-all rationale, which
1 think comes quite naturally out of the legislative history,
that everything Congress has done in this area has reflected

IS
an interest in encouraging the maintenance of non™federal
sources of this recovery, with this interest in mind the
decision to require offset in the case of workmen's compensation
recoveries but not in other cases seems sensible enough, even
if its conclusions are arguable.
Q

But if you strike down the statute, Congress

might very well equalize it by saying we'll deduct everything.
MR. STONE;

I'm not sure whether they would say that

we will deduct everything, or that the offset provision would
simply be eliminated and they would cover everything, which
would have a most unfortunate effect in many ways; or whether
simply they would reduce benefits across the board in some
way.

I think it's very speculative as to what they would do.
There are, in any event, other rationales in support

of Section 224, several of which are developed by the Sixth
Circuit in the Lofty v. Richardson case, decided at 440 F. 2d,
to which I refer the Court.

Many of those are quite

interesting suggestions of possible rationales.
I have focused here, and we have focused primarily
in our brief on those rationales which were quite clearly before
Congress when it considered the statute.

Not that it is

necessary to support a statute in this area purely on the basis
of actually considered rationale.
Q

What was originally the purpose of expanding

social security to cover disability payments?

20
MR. STONE;

Meli,. I don’t entirely know the answer

to that, Mr. Justice White, but from what I have been able to
gather, this occurred in a time in which there was not as ’wide­
spread a coverage under workmen’s compensation claims as before,
it was part of the on-going —
Q

And they were too low?

MR. STONE;

Yes, and they were too low.

-- and it was part of the on-going Federal Social
Security program to cover as many areas of hard-core need as
the Federal Government could.
Q

But it was the shortcomings in other areas

which prompted it in the first place, I suppose.
MR. STONE;

That is my understanding.

And those

shortcomings have, to some extent, been alleviated in recent
years, though I suppose it's not to a point where federal
coverage is no longer necessary.

At least Congress has not

made —
Q

But, in any event, under the present law,

social security will bring them up to some proper percentage
of their —
MR. STONE;

Of their prior earnings.

pretty close to their entire take-home.

In fact,

Eighty percent of

gross.
In conclusion, I believe that we have established
tluvt the only real questions raised by appellee and by the

21
court below are not as to whether Section 224 is constitutional,
but simply as to whether it is the wisest scheme which Congress
could have adopted.

That is debatable.

I think it's quite

a wise scheme in fact.
In any event, that issue is not before this Court,
and for that reason I believe that the judgment below should
be reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Harris.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN CHARLES HARRIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. HARRIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The District Court, interpreting Goldberg v. Kelly
as determining that welfare was a property right and therefore
protected by the due property clause, held that to distinguish
between welfare and social security was illogical and grossly
inequitable.
It further held that Section 224 of the Social
Security Act arbitrarily discriminated between the disabled
worker and other disabled persons, and therefore violating the
due process clause of the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments.
In addition to this, the District Court also stated
that the workmen's compensation law in the State of West
Virginia is very unique insofar as it is a voluntary law,
where the employer and the employee voluntarily go into this

22
particular Act and go under the Act, and therefore, as such,
the highest court in the State of West Virginia has held that
this is an integral part of the contract between the employer
and employee.
And the act of receiving benefits or not receiving
benefits under the Social Security Act, and in this particular
case Mr. Belcher, his payments were reduced in violation of
his contract with his employer, as covered under the
Compensation Act of the State of West Virginia.
Q

Does the worker have the option, at any time

when he's hurt, to sue or to get workmen's compensation?
MR. HARRIS:
his right to sue.
Q

No, once the election is made, he loses

He loses his common-law right.

When is the election?

MR. HARRIS:

When he goes to work?

Actually it's, in most cases — in this

particular case here it was a union election.

But otherwise

I presume the burden is on the employer to accept the workmen's
compensation law and then posting a notice to the employees
saying that "I am under the law, and therefore if you work for
me, why, you are waiving your common-law right."
Q

The compensation payments are from private

insurance or from State funds?
MR. HARRIS:
Q

It's a State fund.

State fund.

MR. HARRIS:

But the contributions come from the

23

employers.
Q

Yes „

MR. HARRIS:

It is not public funds, it is admin­

istered as a trust fund, with the money coming from the
employers.
Q

So you're saying, I take it, then, that there

are no State costs in that situation?
MR. HARRIS: There is no State cost.
Q

Except as it might come in indirectly by the —

just the welfare payments or something of this kind?

No

direct State cost.
MR. HARRIS:

No, it is a fund administered by the

— the funds that are received from the employer, and each
employer pays a premium, if you want to call it that, on the
payroll that he pays to his employees.

It's very similar to

the other States if they have an insurance policy,the rate is
applied to the amount of payroll, and that's the basis of
their insurance payment to the insurance company; the premium.
Q

Mr. Harris, since the employee, from what you

have just said, apparently makes no contribution, pays nothing
for it, doesn't that distinguish it from private insurance
for which the employee would have to be paying out his own
funds?
MR. HARRIS:

Yes, it does.

It does differentiate

between private insurance for which he would pay the premium,

24
but it doesn't differentiate from other States where the
employer pays the premium on the workmen's compensation insur­
ance.
In other States, and there are only six States that
have State funds; the other 44 States do have insurance.

The

employer buys insurance, pays for it fully, and this covers
the employee in the event of industrial accident.
Nov/, the appellant contends that Goldberg, which is
the basis of the decision in the District Court, was strictly
applied to a procedure requirement? and further they contend
that the discrimination was justified, in justifying the
discrimination against disabled workers as compared to other
disabled people.

They say this was justified so otherwise it

would not weaken workmen's compensation lav/s.
And quite the contrary is true, as pointed out by
Mr. chief Justice here, that the States are and will in the
future reduce their workmen's compensation benefits and there­
fore weaken the law, to enable less money from them and more
money from the Federal Government in the form of the social
security laws.
Q

Tell me, why would the States do that?

If it

doesn't cost the State anything?
MR. HARRIS:

I would say that the State is subject

to the same pressures from employers, from the organizations
— I notice in the brief here most of the opposition to the

25
repeal of this particular section# Section 224, came from the
National Association of Manufacturers? it came from the
Chamber of Commerce.

And I think the same thing could apply

in a particular State where the National Association of
Manufacturers, Chambers of Commerce, other employees could
pressure the legislators to reduce the amount of payment for
disability under social security and in fact save them the
expense, since the rates are based on experience, and the more
injuries the more losses the more the employer will pay for
his contribution to social security *— or to workmen's
compensation.
Now, Flemming vs. Nestor, which was decided in 1960,
upheld the refusal of social security benefits to a deportee,
and then went on to say that?

This i3 not to say, however,

the Congress may exercise its power to modify the statutory
scheme free of all constitutional restraint.

The interest of

a covered employee under the Act is of sufficient substance to
fall within the protection from arbitrary government action
afforded by the due process clause.
And of course, mentioning this particular case of
Nestor, they said:

Such is not the case here.

The fact of a

beneficiary's residence abroad, in the case of a deportee, a
presumably permanent residence, can be of obvious relevance to
the question of eligibility.
And this was the decision in Nestor.

26
Nestor held that Congress could not arbitrarily
change the scheme of social security.
Q

In the same particular

Well, my, if Nestor held that Congress could

constitutionally strip him of any benefit whatever if he moves
abroad —
MR. HARRIS:
Q

If he moved abroad.

What happened there?

But this —

I just wonder, if Congres

can go that far, is this going that far?
MR. HARRIS:

This is a question of eligibility, as

to whether he was eligible.
Q

This particular —

I know, but the practical effect was that

r.otwithstanding, as I recall the facts in that case, I don't
think I go along with that; but my recollection is that he
spent some 30 years in this country, hadn't he, when he was
deported?

And he had been contributing all those years to

social security, and Congress said, because he was deported —
i.e was a Communist or something, as I remember it —
MR. HARRIS:
Q

Yes.

— and we, this Court held that he constitution

ally be stripped of all his benefits.
MR. HARRIS:

I believe the Court based their

decision on whether he was eligible.
Q

Well, I don't see that that has — the plain

fact is he lost all his benefits, didn't he?
lave involved here is a reduction of them

And what we

27
MR. HARRISs

This is true, he did lose his benefits,

but the Court did rule he wasn't eligible.
In this particular case, the man is eligible, and
in 1965, when he was under the Act,they did reduce his benefits.
But, in this particular, in the same decision they
quoted Senator George, when this original Social Security Act
was put into being, and he said;
"It comports better than any substitute we have
discovered with the American concept that free men want to
earn their security and not ask for doles — that what is due
as a matter of earned right is far better than a gratuity.
"Social Security is not a handout; it is not charity;
it is not relief.

It is an earned right based upon the

contributions and earnings of the individual.

As an earned

right, the individual is eligible to receive his benefit in
dignity and self-respect."
Now, although Goldberg vs. Kelly spelled out
procedure requirements, the decision rested on due process clause
of the Constitution.

And in doing so, made welfare a property

right that could not be deprived without due process of lav;.
Now, in this particular case, the argument from the ,
appellant is that we must go back and get our due process of
law —
Q
entitlement?

Is this a property right or a statutory
In Goldberg.

28

MR. HARRIS:
a property right.

Well, as the Constitution would say,

In the case of Loving, it was liberty

without due process of law? and Loving went to the Supreme
Court of Virginia, and when they came here they weren't looking
for more procedure, they were looking for a wedding license.
And this Court gave them a wedding license.
Q

What do you want here?

MR. HARRIS s We are looking —
Q

Do you want a hearing?

Q

What's the purpose?

MR. HARRIS:
Q

Do I --

Do you want a hearing from this Court?

MR. HARRIS:

No, no, we’re not looking for a procedure.

I believe the procedure is gone.

We're attacking — or -we3re

asking for an affirmation of the opinion of the District Court
which says that this particular Section 224 of the Social
Security Act is unconstitutional.
Q

In that it denies due process?

MR. HARRIS:

Not on the basis of due process; on the

basis that this was a property right protected by the
Constitution.
Q

Wasn't Goldberg due process?

MR. HARRIS:

Goldberg was due process.

Eut I was

pointing out, in the Loving case —
C>

Well, are you arguing due process or property

29
right protection; that's all I ask you.
MR. HARRIS;
Q

We're arguing both.

Well, where does due process come in?

MR. HARRIS; Due process is that sometimes procedure
will not give you your answer.

You can be deprived, you can

carry all the procedure you want —
Q

Well, exactly what were you deprived of?

MR. HARRIS;
Q

You mean as far as due *—

I mean as to due process.

MR. HARRIS;

I believe, as I pointed out, in the

Loving case, that they had exercised — they had all the due
process they could get, all the way up to this Court; but it
still didn't give them what they wanted.
Q

You're not asking for a marriage license here,

are you?
MR. HARRIS;

No, I'm not looking for a marriage

license, but I'm saying that the due process was not necessarily
a procedure, or a hearing.
rights.

We're looking for protection of

If we go back to the District Court for a hearing on

this, as to whether he should lose his property right, we would
then determine whether he would be properly rehabilitated if
he doesn't get the full amount of his workmen's compensation,
or whether it would weaken the system of workmen's compensa­
tion.
These are the factors that the government relies on,

30

as the purpose for the Section 224 of the Act, that if this is
not in there it will weaken the workmen9s compensation system
and it will not enable the worker that’s disabled to be
rehabilitated.
So we're looking for due process, but a procedure
will not benefit us.

We want to protect the rights that are

protected under due process.

And the due process is the Act

of Congress, that Congress is taking away from this man
something which he has earned, and therefore a hearing will not
do us any good? what we need is an overturn of the statute
that takes this property away from him.
Q

Well, aren't social security taxes, though,

based on some estimate of prediction about how large the
taxes ought to be to maintain a solvent fund?

And based on

how long people normally stay out of work for certain kinds of
injuries, and things like that?
MR. HARRIS:
Q

Well, it's definitely —

Isn't there any actuarial consideration?

MR. HARRIS:

Actuarial.

It's very, very definitely

an acturial situation.
Q

But if the prediction is distorted by people

staying away from work longer than they normally would,
because of payments from other sources, isn't that a considera­
tion?
MR. HARRIS:

It is a consideration.

Whether it's a

31

sufficient consideration is another thing.

There’s a lot of

things that could be considered,
Q

But hasn't this Court said it doesn't have to be

a perfect classification if it's a rational classification?
MR, HARRIS:

But is it not discriminatory if they

pick on one small section?

Doesn't the trial court mention

the Fourteenth Amendment,—
Q

But you

MR. HARRIS:
Q

— equal protection of the law.

Didn't I understand you virtually to concede

that if deduction were made for every type of benefit privately
secured as well as this, you would have no complaint?
MR. HARRIS:

I would agree.

I believe in this

particular point —
Q

But with regard to the private kind, they don't

pay for this.
MR. HARRIS:

They do — the — if a man is injured

and he's eligible for the disability provisions of Social
' Security —
Q

I'm speaking of the workmen's compensation.

He

doesn't pay for — the employee does not pay for that insurance
coverage.

Now, isn't -—
MR. HARRIS: But there are other benefits which this

man can receive that he doesn't pay for, but his social
security is not reduced.

32
For instance, V& payments, if he receives any
pension from the Veterans Administration? if he receives a
tort settlement.

In some cases they talk about maybe it. xtfould

stop him from malingering if he didn't receive sufficient
amount of money.

But if he receives a tort settlement — if

he is fully disabled and he receives a tort settlement, he
could receive up to a half million dollars, and still collect
the disability provisions of Social Security.
He can get welfare, and this is often the case; that
he gets welfare, including Aid to Dependent Children, which he
doesn't pay anything for.

But his Social Security is not

reduced.
Nov/, there's on© thing that is very interesting
here.

Mr. West, my associate, gave me a letter that was sent

to him by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,
and it reads:
Dear Mr. West:
Q

Is that in the record?

MR. HARRIS:
Q

According to our records --

No, it is not.

This is just --

Then I think we don't want ---

MR. HARRIS:

This is just an idea of the fairness,

I'm not —
Q

Well, if it isn't in the record, we don't want

it read.
MR. HARRIS:

All right.

Well, anyway, what it says

33

— I mean what they’re doing in this particular case is saying
that the benefits are reduced beceiuse of the workmen's
compensation, where the payment to the wife is $1.70 a month,
and to the children $5.10 a month, the man's workmen's
compensation benefits were $25 a month — that's $25 a week,
and he's on welfare.

He can't live otherwise.

In the case of food stamps, if he gets food stamps
his benefits are not reduced.

He pays nothing for this.

In this particular case, Mr. Belcher was a member of
the retirement plan for the United Mine Workers, and at age 55
— he's only 53 — at age 55 he could collect a pension.

But

still his benefits, his social security would not be reduced.
If he has investment income, if he owns property and
from this property is getting rental income — now, this, in
some way you might say this would cost him money; but his
benefits from social security would not be reduced by that.
If the relatives give him gifts, if he's supported by
others, this doesn't cost him anything, and he gets that, he
gets no reduction in his social security.
In addition, under the Act, he can go to v/ork on a
trial basis for up to nine months, earn as much as he pleases,
and the money he makes during those nine months does not
reduce his social security disability.
Also, in addition, unless his income is from
substantial gainful employment, and they usually fix this at

34

$50 a month during the time hess getting his disability,, then
his payments are not reduced for that income that is not
substantial gainful employment.
Now, what I haven’t mentioned here is the private
insurance.

If he buys private insurance, private accident and

health insurance, it's not reduced for that,
Also, in addition, there’s one other thing, if he has
life insurance and a waiver of premium on it, when he5s disabled
he pays no more premiurn, which, in effect, is a dividend to him
from the company:

the company pays his premiums for him.,

So these —
Q

Let me get one thing straight.

If a State does

not have a State fund, but the employers buy their workmen’s
compensation insurance from private companies, arid a man is
injured and he is collecting workmen's compensation under one
of those privately insured plans, from his employer —
MR. HARRIS:
Q

Right.

— is his social security reduced?

MR. HARRIS:

His social security would be reduced.

Now, the one thing that is misleading -Q

But it -wouldn’t be if he had bought his own

disability insurance?
MR. KARRIS:

No, it would not.

Any of these other

things that I mentioned here —
Q

But the deduction is made for all kinds of State

35

workmen's compensation programs?
MR. HARRIS:
Q

Only workmen's compensation.

That's what I mean.

MR. HARRIS: All right.
Now, there's one thing that's misleading.

The

formula is very involved as to determine just how much the
reduction would amount to.

But the lav; says that basically it

will be reduced to 80 percent of his earnings,, but not less
than zero.
Now, in some cases it does get down to zero, it gets
down to close to zero.

In the case here, this person is

getting — it's reduced down to $1.70 for the wife and $5.10
for the children.

So it can be reduced down much lov/er than

the 80 percent.
Q

But it isn’t reduced to the extent that it was

under the original Social Security Act?
MR. HARRIS:

No, the original eliminated the entire

■— but again this was repealed.
All right.

One thing, one further thing on this is

that there's some conversation, or some reason given here that
maybe rehabilitation is the reason for this, that you want to
discourage people from malingering, or you want them to be
rehabilitated and become productive again.

This is only paid

for disability, it's not paid for anyone — for total disability,
but anyone who is not totally disabled doesn't get any benefits

36

under this particular section of the Act.
Nov?, to establish whether you're disabled, it requires
that you must be — there must be a medically determinable
physical or mental impairment that can result in death or
which has lasting or can be expected to last

for a continuous

period of not less than 12 months.
So we're not talking about someone malingering.
Now, again, too, the Act is going — is administered
to the extent that in the event that this man is malingering,
they can — and I imagine under Goldberg you have to give him
due process of law, give him a hearing — but they can remove
his benefits from him, if he is well.
Again it would be a medical determination.
So, as far as workmen's compensation, there could be
malingering, because it's not — it's a temporary basis.
3ut in this particular case, under Social Security,
it must be a serious injury or —Q
last?

How long does workmen's compensation normally

Say in a permanent disability case, woxild it go on

for xnore than two years?
MR. HARRISi
that.

It depends.

Or one year?

If — yes, it could go on for more than

Often you get a permanent award.

Now, if

a man loses a leg, you get during the time — until such time
as he gats his award, he gets weekly payments, and after that
he gets an award of maybe 200 weeks for the loss of the lag.

37

Q

But not for life?

MR. HARRIS:

For life?

It could go on for life.

The workmen's compensation is paid for by the
employer and it is really a purchase of insurance.

And if

you want to consider it, it's part of the cost of labor.

In

West Virginia., the court, the highest court of the land, ruled
that it is a contract, part of the contract between the employer
and the employee.

Therefore it is part, in West Virginia it

is part of the income or salary of the employee.
he does pay for it.

So, in effect,

He pays for the — through the cost of

labor he does pay for his workmen's compensation.

Even though

the money never passes through him, it passes strictly to the
fund from the employer.
Again, as far as — going back to the Nestor case,
we're saying that Congress cannot be arbitrary.

If Congress

had a specific purpose that was impartially applied to all
people who would be disabled, then I would be perfectly
agreeable that this was a good lav/.

But arbitrarily they are

picking on the individual who is v/orking and disabled as
opposed to the individual who is not working and disabled.
Nov/, I have my own opinion as to where this
particular exclusion came into the — how this particular
exclusion came into the Act.

And I think probably in 1956

that someone was delegated with the job of coming up with an
accident or disability provision for the compensation, for the

38

Social Security Act.
And looking to see where* they would find what would
be the proper terras to put in there, they picked up accident
and health insurance.

And in every accident and health

policy there is an exclusion for workmen’s compensation.
Q

Mr. Harris,

why don’t you get to the legisla­

tive history instead of your opinion as to what might have
happened?
MR. HARRIS:

Well, I don't — I wouldn’t — no, I

have the legislative history.

The Act was passed in 1956, or

The only thing I can determine is,

why would they exclude only workmen's compensation?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, I think you've

been over that ground pretty well now, Counsel? and if you
haven't any more, I suggest you draw yolu argument to a close.
MR. HARRIS:

Okay.

Wall, there is no plausible rationale for the
discrimination between this worker who is injured as a result
of employment and others who may be injured otherwise, and
therefore cannot — are not excluded, or not reduced or offset
by the workmen's compensation benefits.
