MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We311 hear arguments next

in Woe 70-45, United States against Brewster.
Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
On BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GRISWOLD:

May it please the Court:

This case is here on reargument.

It is a direct

appeal from a decision of the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia dismissing an indictment on constitu­
tional grounds.
The indictment appears beginning on page 1 of the
Appendix, it consists of nine counts, or ten counts, the oddnumbered ones of which relate to the defendant, former Senator
Brewster; the even-numb©red counts are not before the Court at
all.

And the first count may be taken, for the purposes of this

appeal, as typical of the rest, raising the question which was
decided.
The first allegation in the count is that:

"At all

times hereinafter mentioned in this indictment,-Daniel B.
Brewster was a public official ... that is, a member of the
Senate of the United States from the State of Maryland."
And then over cn page 2 of the indictment, the
principal allegation of the first count is that:’, "Daniel B.
Brewster being a public official ... acting for and on behalf

thereof .directly and indirectly, corruptly asked * solicited,
sought, accepted,, received and agreed to receive the sum of
$5,000 for himself and for an entity ... in return for being
influenced in his performance of official acts in respect to
his action, vote, and decision on postage rate legislation
which raight at any time be pending before him in his official
capacity and in his place of trust and profit? in violation of
Sections 201(c)(1) and 2, Title 18, United States Code»"
After the indictment was found, defendant, through
his counsel, filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, in fact
two motions to dismiss, but the only one that's, her© is the
one which appears on page 8 of the Appendix.

And the motion to

dismiss the odd-numbered counts of the indictment was on the
ground that in each such count the defendant is charged with
being influenced in his performance of official acts in his
capacity as a United States Senator; and than, finally, the
third reason of the motion to dismiss:

"Each Count of the

Indictment, as charged, against this Defendant violates the
provision of Article 1, Section 6 of the United States
Constitution."

Which is the speech or debate clause, which,

it will be remembered, says in rather simple terms that for
any speech or debate in either House, Senators or Representative
shall not he questioned in any other place.
The language, the important language here is "any
speech or debate in either House"

5

And then the order of the court from which this appeal
is taken appears on page 34 of the Appendix:

"Ordered that the

defendant’s motion be granted, and the indictment and hereby is
dismissed as to the defendant Brewster for the reasons stated
orally by the Court at the hearing on October 9, 1970,®
And those reasons appear on the preceding page, page
33p where the Court said:
"Gentleman, based on the facts of this case, it is
admitted by the Government that the five counts of the
indictment which charge Senator Brewster relate to the acceptance
of bribes in connection with the performance of a legislative
function by a Sanator of the United States."
Now, I suggest that that’s simply a paraphrase of
exactly what the indictment says.
And then:

"It is the opinion of this Court that the

immunity under the Speech and Debate Clause of the Constitution,
particularly in view of the interpretation given that Clause
by the Supreme Court in Johnson, shields Senator Brewster,
constitutionally shields him from any prosecution for alleged
bribery to perform a legislative act,"
The question of the jurisdiction of this appeal has
baen deferred to the hearing of the merits,

I.find it, myself,

somewhat difficult to see that there is doubt as to the
jurisdiction of the appeal.

This arises under the old version

of the Criminal Appeals Act, since the indictment was found

6
hare before January 1971, and it seems to us that this appeal
comes under two of the clauses of that statute.
there is a suggestion in Mr. Ramsey's brief that, for
some reason*, the statute is not applicable because of a reference
to a conference memorandum, which was said to be before the
judge; it is not in the Appendix.

I have never seen it.

1 would like to suggest, with respect to it, that
there is no procedure for summary judgment in the rules of
criminal procedure.

2 think that there is a sort of a spill-

over hers because we're familiar with summary judgment in the
rules of civil procedure, that this is in some way a decision
on a summary judgment.
But I know of no procedure in the rules of criminal
procedure for summary judgment.
And then 1 would like to suggest, Mr. Ramsey says
that this was the equivalent of an acquittal, I would like to
point out that no jury had been empaneled, no trial had been
commenced, and X would like to suggest that,as far as anything
2 have heard of in the lav; of criminal procedure so far, there
cannot be an acquittal except at a trial.

That is, until a

jury has been empaneled.
Now, this becomes a little complicated in the ease
of a trial without jury, but I still suggest that there cannot
be an acquittal without a trial.

That is, that the commence­

ment of a trial without a jury is a rather formal act, like the

7
empaneling of a jury, and requires, among other things, that
the right to trial by jury has been waived,

There was no such

waiver here, and there was no trial.
There cannot be double jeopardy until there has been
jeopardy.

Here no jury had been empaneled, and jeopardy had

not attached.
I world like, in c).osing the jurisdictional part of
my argument, to refer to two decisions of this Court, which
are not cited in my brief, one of them, the first of them, is
cited in an early brief of Mr. Ramsey, though for another
point.

That is the case of United States v. Fruehauf,1r 365

U.S., where the situation is almost exactly parallel to that
here.

There had been memoranda before the District Court..

There was a direct appeal to this Court under the Criminal
Appeals Act.
If the position taken now by Mr. Ramsey is correct,
even assuming that the conference memorandum to which he refers
is a part of the record here, that case, that appeal should
have been dismissed on the ground that there had been a decision
under summary judgment or an acquittal.

That decision —

that appeal not only was not dismissed, but the case was sent
back to the District Court for trial.
And then another case which is not cited in our
brief, but it is so closely parallel that I think it appropriate
to mention it here.

United States v. Baisefch, 342 U.S. 277,

8
where it appeared that there had been a stipulation in the
District Court ,r and there again if the decision of the court
with respect to that stipulation had amounted to an acquittal
or a decision on a summary judgment, the appeal should have
been dismissed, but the appeal was not dismissed»
Doth of these cases are discussed in Mr» Justice
Harlan's opinion in United States vSisson, in 399 U.3.

But

2 would point out that the Sisson case is clearly inapplicable
hare, because there there had been a full trial and the judge's
decision, which amounted to the entry of a judgment notwith­
standing the verdict, was based on facts which appeared at the
trial? thus jeopardy had attached and the basis for an appeal
was removed,

was held in the Sisson case itself.

Now, turning to the merits here, the case is of course
the sjpp beyond the Court’s decision in United States v.
Johnson, which was decided some six years ago.

The appellee

relies on the Johnson decision, but 1 think that it is, by its
own terms, inapplicable here.
With the benefit of hindsight, one can say that the
Johnson case was an unfortunate case to brinq before the Court.
The charge there was under the conspiracy statute which is a
very general statute; while the charge here is under a bribery
statuta, one which, with respect to Congressmen and Senators,
has a continuous history, going back to 1853, 119 years,
during which time Congress has expressly said that when a

9

Congressman or a Senator accepts a bribe he should be subject
to prosecution through the regular procedures of the criminal
courts.
But in the Johnson case as well not much concern was
given about the speech or debate clause, in initiating the
prosecution or in carrying it out.

In the case the indictment

contained a specific reference to the speech and debate clause,
which was quoted at some length in the Court8s opinion.

This

is on page'184, and paragraph 15 of the indictment said it was
a part of said conspiracy that the said Thomas F. Johnson should
render services for compensation, to wit, the making of a
speech defending the operations of Maryland savings and loan
associations, and so on.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, do you recall whether in

the Johnson case there was a motion in the trial court
challenging the indictment on that specific ground?
MR. GRISWOLD:

I do not recall, Mr. Chief Justice.

I do not believe that it appears anywhere in the opinion of
this Court? I have not searched through the record as to what

I
was done in the District Court.
Not only was this in the indictment but at the trial
itself, some 50 pages of the transcript related to the speech
in the case presented by the government.

Andhaving been so

opened up by the government, there was much more about the
speech in the presentation of the defense.

10
The government introduced a copy of the speech in
evidence and devoted substantial argument to the proposition
that the nature of the conspiracy was that the speech should
bo delivered in order that it could be reprinted and distributed
among appropriate persons in Maryland»
How,- too, with respect to the Johnson case, it's
very significant that the opinion was narrowly guarded.
page 184 of the opinion, the Court said:

On

Whatever room the

Constitution may allow for such factors in the context of a
different kind of prosecution — and this of course is a
bribery prosecution not a conspiracy prosecution.
And then on page 185 the Court said:

We emphasise

that our holding is limited to prosecutions involving
circumstances as those presented in the case before us.

We

expressly leave open for consideration, when the case arises,
a prosecution which though possibly entailing inquiry into
legislative acts or motivations is founded upon a narrowly
drawn statute, passed by Congress in the exercise of its
legislative power to regulate the conduct of its members.
Then 1 think it’s not irrelevant to point out three
members of the Court, Chief Justice Warren and Justices Douglas
and Brennan, concurred only in the limited holding of the
Court, that the use of the Congressman's speech during this
particular trial, with an examination into its authorship,
motivation, and content, was violative of the speech or debate

11
clause»
Two members of the Court took no part in the case,
so that there ware only four Justices who concurred, in anything
broader than the limited holding referred to in Chief Justice
Warren'a opinion *
Now, there's nothing like this in this case.
is no speech at all.

There

Indeed, as I've indicated, there's no

evidence before the Court.

There was no examination into the

authorship, motivation, and content of any speech.

There is a

reference in each count to the effect that Senator Brewster is
charged with taking a bribe, and I quote, "in return for being
influenced in his performance of official acts in respect to
his action, vote, and decision on postage rate legislation."
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, suppose, under this

indictment, the case V7ere tried and the defendant established
that ha voted not at all, absented himself or abstained, or
voted contrary to the agreement charged? would that —* if,
nevertheless, a bribe had been paid, would that undermine the
case, the government's case?
MR. GRISWOLD;

I think not, Mr. Chief Justice, if

the defendant was the one who brovtght that out.

I am a little

concerned about the — if the prosecution relies on a vote.
Q

I*m assuming the defendant would be the one who

brought it out.
MR, GRISWOLDs

If the defendant brings it out, I

12
assume ha can waive — well, 1 don't know»

It says, '’shall not

be questioned”? unless he relies on it, I find it hard to see
how he can complain that he is being questioned.
1 would think, certainly under the -Johanson case, it
is clear that the government cannot maintain the prosecution if
it relies directly on the giving of a speech.
reference in the opinion to tangential use.
know just what ’’tangential use” means.

There is some
I don’t quite

I would think that it

might perhaps be within that language if it were shown that
there was a speech, but if the text of the speech was not
relied on, and if the xaofcivation and authorship of the speech
were not gone into.
But I would suggest, Mr. Chief Justice, that this
indictment, at this stage, can be sustained without answering
these questions.

1 don’t know just where the line is.

I

know that the Constitution says "speech or debate in either
House"; and I don’t think that that is broad enough or ought
to foe held to be broad enough to cover things which occur
outside of sessions of the House which might be construed to
include sessions of committees.

A committee may be, for this

purpose, something done in the House.
It doesn’t say "vote”, but I am troubled about "vote",
and there are opinions of the Court, which have indicated,
though I don’t think actually decided, that vote may be enough.
But this indictment charges him with receiving a

13
bribe for being influenced in his performance of official acts
in respect to his action, vote, and decision on postage rata
legislation.
Well, now, suppose we strike out "vote"; suppose we
say that that can't be referred to.
let's strike it out.

1 don't concede that, but

There is still plenty in this indictment,

and the evidence at the trial may show nothing relating to a
vote, there is no charge with respect to a speech, which is the
only thing to which the Johnson case applies; and unless the
Court is prepared to hold that nothing that a Senator does as
a Senator can be questioned in any other place, under the
speech and debate clause, a result far beyond anything that
has ever yet' been decided, it seems to me that there is no
basis for holding that this indictment, of itself, without any
evidence, is in violation of the speech and debate clause.
Our position —
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, isn't the difference that

there's no speech involved, this is "act"; and wouldn't it be
true that if the Senator took the $5,000 and the next day the
bill was withdrawn from Congress, he couldn’t have voted or
done anything on it, but he would still be guilty?
MR, GRISWOLD;

Yes, Mr, Justice Marshall,

that

would be ■—*
Q

Because he took the bribe.

MR. GRISWOLD;

•— it would be our position that the

.14

crime is committed when the bribe is either solicited or
received.

He doesn't have to receive it# with the requisite

intent# and that it is not necessary to prove that there was
in fact any legislative act of any kind.
And I think that becomes quite clear when you consider
the solicitation language in the statute:
solicits any bribe.

asks# demands# seeks#

It would not be possible to prosecute

the solicitation of a bribe if the other construction of the
statute is taken until you waited to see whether he did some­
thing.
And# as I have tried to develop in the supplemental
brief which we have filed# I think that a prosecution under
this statute can be maintained and that the indictment is
sufficient without the showing of any speech or debate of any
kind# without the shewing of any action# if there is evidence
which can show that at the time he solicited or received the
bribe he intended to take legislative action in accordance with
the bribe's request.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Kr. Ramsey.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN P. RAMSEY# ESQ.,
ON BEHAI,F OF THE APPELLEE
MR. RAMSEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I should like to address myself first to the sugges­
tion made by the Solicitor General in his closing comments.

15
First# I would request of the Court that- attention be
given to the fact that this particular subject matter# which is
now asserted by the Solicitor General, was never argued below?
it was not the textural aspect of the case when it was before
the District Judge»
What was before the District Judge was perfectly
clearly set forth in connection with the debate and colloquy,
and in connection with the record of the case as it there
existed»
Government counsel there said that under this
indictment, and I’m quoting from page 28 of the record
extract, "we are not contending that what is being charged
here, that is the activity by Brewster, was any tiling other than
a legislative act? we are not ducking the question, it is
squarely presented.

They are legislative acts, we are not

going to quibble over there,"
Now, the important point to this case, as we see it,
is thiss
or debate.

This case does not test the outer limits of speech
This case falls squarely within the hard core of

speech or debate.
In the earlier arguments in the brief of the
government which was earlier submitted in this case, the
government conceded that while the precise limits of Johnson
may be a little vague, quote, "We do not contend that the clause
protects only speech."

16
And then they went back to two former holdings of
this Court, in the Powe11 case and in the Kilbourn case,
committee reports,, resolutions, and the act of voting are
equally covered, as are, quote, "things generally done in a
session of the House by one of its Members in relation to the
business, before it."
That has never been a doubted proposition.

It was

against the text of that, and this Court*s holding as it •.
enclosed it on the speech or debate clause, that District Judge
Hart made his decision.

Against the background of that, he

placed an indictment, which called, as the Solicitor General
has candidly conceded to the Court, into question official
conduct in the nature of action, vote, and decision.
Now, this illusive memorandum of conferences was known
to trial counsel below, and certainly appellate counsel are
charged with knowledge of what trial counsel did know.

All v;e

put that before the Court for, in the first instance, was to
make the Court aware that this case was not decided in a i^acuum,
that there was justification for the comment by Judge Hart,
quote, "based on the facts of this case", close quote, that
this was not decided in the abstract.
As one of the Justices —
Q

You*re saying it was not decided on the indict­

ment?
MR. RAMSEYs

It was not decided in the abstract,

17
Q

On the indictment?

MR. RAMSEY:

Well, I’m coming to that, sir.

One of

the Justices, Mr. Chief Justice, inquired before — I think it
was Justice Stewart — Did not the indictment say "action, vote,
or decision"; and it did, sir.
But that was simply clarified, and in that regard
our position in that matter is this;

Basically, when a

Congressman — using that, of course, in its general phraseology
~~ when a Congressman is accused of improper conduct, improper
motivation, then there must come soma point in the proceeding
when either, before the grand jury action is brought to stop
improper intrusion into areas covered by speech or debate, or
if after indictment, when the trial court has occasion to have
access to the precise facts upon which the application of
speech or debate is made apparent $
happened in this particular case.

We say that that is what
It was not challenged at

the grand jury level, as i,3 true in another case currently
pending, and as to which X will make no detailed comment?
but it was challenged by a 12(b)(1) motion as soon as it could
be.
That is to say, we put before the court, and the
government cooperated in putting before the court, that what
was being questioned in this case was legislative conduct, not
the postulated absence of legislative conduct.
Q

Well, what phase of legislative conduct is the

18
taking of a bribe?
MR. RAMSEYs

It is •— Mr. Justice Marshall, my answer

to that would not be a direct one, it would be this, sir;
You would be testing motivation if you say that a give phase
of legislative conduct, whether it be vote, whether it be
committee discussion, whether it be a report written by a given
Congressman, was motivated in one way, or by one set of
circumstances* you then fall within the ambit of speech or
debate.
Q

Well, what has speech and debate got to do with

taking a bribe?
MR. RAMSEY: The taking of the bribe is in the concept
of an indictment like that before this Court, sir.
Q

Well, is speech or debate mentioned in the

indictment?
MR. RAMSEY:

Oh, no, it is not.

You are asking, sir,

whether it is said in the indictment that a particular speech
was made as
0

No, the words “speech or debate" or anything

closely resembling it in the indictment?

Which is the one

thing that we have before us.
, .

MR. RAMSEY:

No.

I would have to answer that,

directly, sir, that is not in the indictment.

There is no

word —
V

Q

And that*s all we have before us is that he took

19
a bribe.
MR. RAMSEYs
Q

Well, —

Even if he never made a speech about anything.

MR. RAMSEY; Well, I respectfully submit, Mr. Justice
Marshall, -Q

Well, as 1 understand your position, when a

Member of Congress takas a bribe of any amount of money and
then makes a speech, he is in a different category from anybody
else in the United States?
ME. RAMSEY;

No, he3s in the same category as any

other Congressman who doss the same things —
Q

Or any other person?

MR. RAMSEY;

— he is subject to penalty in his own

House, which has the right to question him; but he is to be
questioned Kin no other place” in the language of speech or
debate, sir.
Q

Well, can he raise that if he doesn't make a

speech?
MR. RAMSEY;

If he does not make a speech, then we

are back to the inquiry of the breadth of speech or debate.
Are wa ■ strictly talking speech or debate?

.And we say, since

Kilbourn in 1881, that has not been so.
Q

Well, so far as I’m concerned, my ambit of speech

and debate at. least stops at the bribe.
[Laughter.]

20

MR. RAMSEY: Well,, let me put it this way, Mr.
Justice Marshall ~~
Q

This is like a freedom of speech case.

A man

has the right of freedom of speech, but that doesn’t give him
the right to act illegally.
act of taking a bribe.

And this is an act, solely, the

That’s the only thing involved in this

case. And don’t you agree that that point was left open in
Johnson?
MR. RAMSEY:

Wo, I say what was left open in Johnson,

Mr. Justice Marshall, was the issue of whether there was an
outer perimeter where this Court — or parameter, I should say,
where this Court v;ill say that speech or debate does not
protect.

But in this instant case, speech or debate, as an

applicable principle, was conceded before the lower court.
Q

Where is that in the record?

MR. RAMSEY:

As a practical matter, the issue is

posed in this fashion in the lower court:

They say, ”We say

it was legislative activity? ha was motivated in his legislative
conduct by the acceptance of improper sums of money.”
We say, and this was the thrust in ths lower court
and also in the government9s original brief in this Court, "that
this however falls out of that heartland of speech or debate
and is within the exclusion which this Court reserved when
Johnson was decided."
We say, to the contrary', that on that issue, as posed

21
before the lower court, that what was done in this case/'and
the facts as alleged in this case fall squarely within what was
covered by Johnson, and do not fall within the exclusion.
We do not say that it is not possible to postulate a situation
which will take it to the outer limit of speech or debete and
beyond the outer limit of speech or debate;, so that there may
be an indictable crime.
But, as was said in the Johnson case, it is our
position that speech or debate extends at least so far as?
and that is the language of this Court in that opinion. And we
3ay it does clearly extend "so far as” to protect against
inquiry as respects legislative acts under the circumstances
of this case.

And that is the way in which this whole issue

came up.
These assumptions, these hypotheses, these hypothetical
illustrations were never part of the case when it was before
Judge Hart, and there is no doubt in my mind that this Court
can and will, on some occasion, take the speech or debate clause,
analyze it, and find it without application to certain sets of
conduct as, for example, in Burton, and as in Johnson, where
•the conduct is not related to legislative acts but is related
tos executive.
We agree that that is the past ruling of this Court,
and wo "~
Q

But is it not a routine function of Congressmen

22
to advocate propositions and to importune officers of the
Executive Branch to do one thing or another for their
constituents?
MR. RAMSEY:

I suggest, sir, that Senator Burton

would have loved to have had the Chief Justice express similar
opinions back at the time of his case; but 1 think that’s
decided, I think the Executive ---■
0

I’m speaking of the factual matter#

Isn’t that

what -~
MR. RAMSEY:
such, sir.

But it is not legislative conduct, as

The legislative process, turning as it does

necessarily to the absorption of the representative of his
various constituents8 wishes and desires, of the need to
represent them in connection with subject matters which come
before him for political judgment and for judgments as respects
policy, he must be free, and he is indeed free; and this is
V

the significant aspect and the significant posture of a
Senator or a Congressman in this regard.

He must always be

open to suggestions, to pressure, he must always be open to
the possibility that an executive desiring to penalise someone
who has voted against the executive may wish to posture him
against his voting record with his list of contributors/ with
on inference to follow, if an unfriendly grand jury chooses to
draw it, that there is a necessary connection between the
assemblage of the money necessary to win a campaign and the

23
favorable vote, be it on fishing, be it on oil, be it on
what-may-it~be.
Q

But ~~
Now, you spoke, Mr. Ramsey, of some of these

hypothetical situations not being before the court, the District
Court, which is of course trite? but that’s because, in part,
no evidence was taken, the case never reached that point.

Is

that not so?
MR. RAMSEY:

Well, it is because, if you please, Mr.

Chief Justice, it is because the government postured its ease
before the District Judge and said:

We expect to prove this

case by proving legislative acts of Senator Brewster.
And the judge took their representation that this
was so.

It became a concessum of record, and it was a concession

predicated on known facts, known to the judge, known to counsel,
and his opinion expressly stated, "based on the- facts of this
case".

i
So that it was not simply a case of taking up

hypothetical*, the government had not postured either its
indictment or its presentation on hypothetical ability to
reach outside and find some circumstance which would permit
the drawing of a claim that it was outside speech or debate»
It had challenged the lower court, by bringing in an
indictment squarely designed to fall within speech or debate,
as Johnson defined it, and put the issue to the District Judge
to aay that this was a narrowly drawn statute.

That's exactly

24
the way they attempted to posture it,
l£ow, under those circumstances, it was clean and
clear that they posed the issue to the trial courts

Are you

now willing to say that if we take a statute which we deem to
be a precise, narrowly drawn statute, that you will say that
speech or debate must surrender to it?
And that was the way it was before the court.

Arid

the facts were before the court that what was being challenged
was legislative conduct of the Senator.

Mr. Ramsey,

MR. RAMSEY;
Q

Yes, sir.

isn't the logical import, both of Judge

Hart's ruling below and your argument here, that Congress
cannot, under any circumstances, provide for the judicial
prosecution of the taking of a bribe by a Member of Congress?
MR. RAMSEY;

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I do not believe

that that is a necessary corollary.

I think by the reservation

which was made by the Court in Johnson, it was indicated that
there might be an area where such a bribe could be penalized.
We argue, as you are aware, sir, in our brief that
it being a power granted to each of the Houses to inquire
into motivation of Members, and not granted to the Houses as
Houses of Congress to legislate on generally, that they cannot
take away the power which the people gave, or the protection
the people gave their representatives.

25
But, coming past that point, I would say, sir, that
in, for example, the bribed Congressman's immunity from
prosecution, which is commented an in Harvard Law Review
quite extensively, said is one of the leading worsts dealing
with this subject matter, there is a suggestion made that a
properly drawn statute might fos structured which could permit
it.
We are somewhat ambivalent on that, since we argue
that there is no constitutional power to delegate that right,
the Section 5 right, over to the courts for inquiry.

But,

basically, I would say yes, there may bs a chance, Mr. Justice
Rehnquist, where it could be done,
Q

What sort of a situation would that be,

consistent with your own position?
MR. RAMSEY: Well, as a practical matter, 1 would
think that some of the — in the first argument in this case
we had a series of hypotheticals put to counsel for the
appellee, and it was an attempt, really, to move away from the
heartland of speech or debate and outward.
Mr, Justice Marshall pose3 a somewhat similar
problem:

Are we at the outer limits of speech or debate,

where a bribe was accepted and agreed to, where there is no
need to introduce any evidence concerning official action
taken, any official vote given, any official resolution
drafted, any official speech given?

Are we going to reach the

26
point where the Court will now say;

You are sufficiently away

from inquiry into legislative acts that we should sustain the
prosecution?
Q

Well, do you mean that it would be permissible

for the government to prove an agreement of the nature you’ve
just described* so long as there's no need to inquire whether
it was performed or not?
MR. R&MSEYs Well, 1 would say — I understood your
question to be, sir, if I could postulate a circumstance, I’m
not saying that's the only circumstance.
I would suggest this to you, sir,- that if the indictmant was premised on a set of facts which would permit proof
that a given man had agreed to take a given bribe and then he
did nothing, that you might possibly foe able to sustain the
indictment because the agreement itself constituted the bribe.
But where you have, on the other end of the echelon, that is
to say, that he was alleged to have taken a bribe to be but
motivated to vote for and did vote for, then you open up
inquiry into the very area of his conduct, which is proscribed
by speech or debate,
Q

Well, take your first case, where you say he

took a bribe and did nothing.

Certainly bribes aren’t given

without soma understanding, contractual understanding, of a
performance.

Even in your first ease, where he did nothing,

there would have to have been an agreement by him to do

21
something, or it wouldn't be a bribe, as one commonly understands
it.
MR. RAMSEY: Well, this is why the outer limits of
the problem, as I say, we focused our attention on them almost
wholly by virtue of hypofchet;Lcals from various Justices at the
last hearing, we think that focuses on the wrong issue in the
case.

That is not this ease, as we conceive.

This case is

differently postured.
Q

Mo, but wa’ve got to apply some sort of a

rational standard that’s capable of being applied, not just to
this case but to other cases, too, in order to reach a result,
don’t we?
MR. RAMSEY:

I quite agree that the Court is correct

in trying to test the outer reach of any decision which it
makes.

But I remind you, sir, that this case is before the

Court under the Criminal Appeals Act on the facts of this
case.
Q

On the facts of this case.

Is there any

allegation in the indictment that he did vote that way?
MR. RAMSEY:
Q

Wo, there’s nothing in there that says it.

Well, —

There is nothing in the record of this?

MR. RAMSEY;

You postulated the same hypothetical to

ms at the least hearing, and again I would have to give you,
Mr. Justice Marshall, the same answer which I gave?

It depends

on whether this indictment, which is challenged and which is
before the Court, would require proof as respects his legis­
lative conduct thereafter.

If that be so, then we say it

comes under Johnson.
Q

Well, it wouldn't be under Johnson, all the

government had to prove was that he took the bribe for the

29

express promise of doing something, and that was the crime.
Regardless of what he did thereafter,
MR, RAMSEY:

I do not so read Johnson, if Mr, Justice

Marshall, you are stating that as the holding of Johnson,

to do something?

What else does the government have to prove?

MR. RAMSEY:

ment, that —
Q

What els® did the government have to prove?

MR. RAMSEY: i would suggest, sir, that the government

must necessarily prove that it was to influence him in the
performance of an official act.

It was for that purpose?

MR. RAMSEY: That is correct, and that is the allega­
tion *-~
Q

That’s all the government has to prove?

MR. RAMSEY:
Q

And that allegation

And the only speech the government has to show

is that Senator Jones’ speech was:
vote the way you want me to vote.

Give me $5,000 and I’ll
That's not the kind of

speech 1 think is covered.
MR. RAMSEY:

I am suggesting to you, sir, that what

was done in this case was that legislative conduct, as alleged,
in his action, vote, and decision are what they intended to
prove, and that that, is the very area of inquiry which is
foreclosed by speech or debate.
New, I am not suggesting that what is foreclosed by
speech or debate is the conversation having to do with whether
or not a bribe would or would not be paid.

I ayn saying the

government said in this case: ,!We intend to show the receipt of
campaign contributions", because the first count which the
Solicitor General selected is typical, and which I will use
as typical, if the Court will keep in mind that count nine has
a slight varying, in that it refers backward to the receipt
of moneys theretofore, as distinct from — or action taken

31

theretofore as distinct from anticipated action,.
St is alleged in this indictment that the defendant
"soughty accepted, received and agreed to receive the sum of
$5,000 for himself and for an entity, the Do C, Committee for
Maryland Education”, a political fund, in other words, is what
is alleged to be involved,
Then they go on to say:

‘'And we intend to show that

this was in return for being influenced in the performance of
his official acts in respect to his action, vote, and decision.w
And it was to that subject matter that the Assistant United
States Attorney addressed himself when asked by the court as
to whether the acts which were challenged were legislative in
nature? and he said, Yes, sir, they are.
And that was in accord with the understanding of
everybody concerned, that they were legislative acts.

And

that being the case, it is perfectly clear that this was an
attempt to precisely stage this case for that decision.
It was so decided, and that falls square in Johnson.
Q

But we will never know what the government would

rest its case on, unless there3s a trial, will x*e?
MR. RAMSEY; Well, I suspect, sir, that very many
times, very competent trial judges are perfectly willing and,
indeed, need to re:ly on an open concession, such as was made
by the Assistant United States Attorney in this case, that it
was legislative conduct which is challenged.

And that against

32
the background of a fully known revelation to the trial judge
of precisely what factual data the government intended to
prove, which they supplied, as they said, in freehanded fashion
to the defendant? but did not put into the record because of

the very good chance of pretrial prejudicial publicity, in a
case with trial then pending shortly after the hearing date
of the motions which were then before the court.
And it is, I suggest to the Court, a perfectly
useful, desirable, and necessary proposition.

The courts procee

on this particularly in areas where, as the Court said in
Powell, the Congressman should be relieved of the obligation
to defend himself.
There is, under the decisions of this Court, no
constitutional basis for making a crime out of conduct, where
you must necessarily go to motivation for legislative conduct
in order to prove that a given sura of money was received or had,
by the particular man in question, by reason of a specific
motivation on his part.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will pick up there

AFTERNOON SESSION
[ I s 0 0 p. m . ]
UR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Ramsey, you may

continue»
MR. RAMSEY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice? and may it

please the Court:
In order to put our position in this case in proper
context, I think a return to the basic principles on which we
rely may be helpful.
First of all, w© premise our argument on the announced
concept, as laid down by this Court, that one of the functions
of the speech and debate clause is to relieve the Senator from
the duties of defending himself.

That is announced in several

of the recent expositions as respects the meaning of speech or
debate.
We further would state to the Court that this
imposes a duty on the trier of such cases, or one before whom
such case comes, to inquire into the case *tfhieh is intended to
be made by the prosecutor against the defendant, under the
particular facts of that case.
Now, keep in mind, if you will, please, that our
\

position is that if there is an interrogation which is
violative o£ speech or debate, and an indictment has already
been returned, there has been at least one violation of speech
or debate in the very grand jury inquiry which was the under-

34
lying precidate for the indictment which is returned.

Therefore,

it behooves the District Judge before whom such a case comes
to look to the facts of the case, to look to the indictment, and
to see whether what has been done is a set of circumstances
which leads to application of speech or debate, and which
ought properly to cause him to enter into the case for the
purpose of dismissing it because he has an obligation to honor
the Senator4s right not to foe called upon to defend, if the
case is violative of speech or debate.
Q

Hr. Ramsey.

HR. RAMSEY:
Q

Yes, sir.

Why couldn’t that be treated simply as a matter

of privilege, that is, forbid the inquiry if one seeks to make
the inquiry during the trial rather than throw out the whole
case?
MR. RAMSEY: As a practical matter, Hr. Justice
RehnquiSt, the way we see it, and what we premise our argument
on is a direct quote out of the Johnson case, and in that case
this Court said, speaking there of conspiring to give a speech
in return for compensation from private sources s

However

reprehensible, we believe that the speech or debate clause
extends at least so far as to prevent it from being made the
basis of a criminal charge.

Speaking backward to the quality

of that as a sufficiently indictable basis, and I think the
policy consideration, sir, which is behind that is simply

35
this;
The clause is designed to prevent harassment of the
legislator by either an unfriendly executive or an unfriendly
judiciary, if that be the case.

But in the first instance,, the

grand jury investigation, it is to shield him from being hailed
in before a grand jury, queried as respects his motives.
Now, if I may postulate a case which is illustrative,
I think it would run this way;
Is it not, if the court does not vindicate speech or
debate as stopping grand jury inquiry, is it not perfectly
possible for an unfriendly prosecutor to hail in any Member
of the Congress, put before that grand jury a list of the
contributors who contributed to his last campaign, and within
the frame or reference of the bribery statute to then put
against that testimony that a given Senator and/or Congressman
voted in a particular way favorable to the very interests who
had contributed so heavily to his campaign funding at the time
when he ran?
Mow, from that, it would be postulated that you may
draw the inference that the' vote favorable to whatever
interest it may bs could be said to be, or an inference could
be drawn that it was predicated upon, the earlier contribution
of money to his campaign.
It is this peculiar aspect of the elective process,
the need of the representative to get himself elected, which

36
sets apart the legislative from ail the balance of government
with the exception of, of course, the President and the Vice
President, who are in a position where they necessarily are
participants in political campaigns in order to become elected
representatives of the people.
But, basically, we think the policy is cleanly stated,
and we think the policy a wise one, in that the essence of the
charge, again as this Court said in Johnson, and speaking there
to the Johnson charge, in this context, is that the Congressman * s
conduct was improperly motivated? and, as will appear, that is
precisely what the speech or debate clause generally forecloses
from executive and judicial inquiry.
Now, coming back to my original view of the matter,
1 would say, sir, that we approach it this ways

the court owes

an obligation because of the prior —- "the court”, I am talking
now of the court hearing such a case
examine the facts.

owes an obligation to

In this case it was conceded by the

government and found by the court that a necessary root of the
case was inquiry into legislative conduct.

And it was at that

stage that Judge Bart granted the motion.
Nov/, the vice of a prosecution of this sort is that
it would seek to have a finder of fact, usually a jury, but
not necessarily so, to draw inferences between the campaign
funds on the one hand, and positions taken politically.
Judgment calls by a man who makes policy, a man who does indeed

3?
address himself to considerations which are based upon the
well-being of those whom he represents.
Q

Now, Mr. Ramsey,the language that you just alluded

to, or paraphrased from the Johnson opinion, were in the context
of the discussion of an alleged payment for making a speech
on the Floor of the House,

That has quite a bit to do with it,

does it not?
MR. RAMSEY:

Well, I would say, sir, that while you

are correct, of course, Mr. Chief Justice, they were in a case
which dealt with that subject matter.
Q

Well, and those particular remarks, I think,

were addressed to that general problem, were they not?
MR. RAMSEYs

I think — I purported to be quoting,

Your Honor, 1 may have been paraphrasing? but;

However

reprehensible, and I had interspersed "conspiring to give a
speech in return for payment by private individuals", it may

he we belie® the speech or debate clause extends at least so
£®r.
That was, of course, in the aspect of the case where
they were discussing a .speech which was given by Congressman
Johnson, and I believe that was the Court's inquiry to me, and
the answer is:
Q

Yes, sir, that is correct.
And this Court did not want to try to make the

evaluation, the fact evaluation of whether the speech on the
Floor of the House had influenced the verdict as distinguished

38
from other things that Congressman Johnson had done.

Isn’t

that correct?
MR. RAMSEY: Well, 1 think, Mr. Chief Justice, this
Court sent the case back and said that if it could be purged of
elements offensive to the speech or debate, that was no reason
why there could not be a proceeding which would go to the other
aspects of the case.

But the speech was so thoroughly inter-

twined into the governmental evidence in the original case
that it was impossible to sort it out at that point; and it
simply went back for a new trial.
Q

tod he was tried and convicted?
t

MR. RAMSEY:

On substantive counts, which in no way

involved the speech, and which frankly spoke only to those
aspects of the matter which had to do with his having
interceded in connection with executive affairs as distinct
from performing legislative functions.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Ramsey.

Mr. Solicitor General, you have seven minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
It seems to me that Mr. Ramsey unduly treats
"legislative act" as synonymous with, and absolutely the

39

equivalent of, "speech or debate"0
There is nothing in the Constitution which refers in
any way to legislative acts, and we submit there are many acts
xtfhich a legislator may do and may properly do as a legislator,
which are appropriate for a Congressman or a Senator to do,
which are customarily done by Congressmen or Senators, which
are not speech or debate and which are not within the protection
of the speech or debate clause.
If the Court should reach the conclusion that the
speech or debate clause protects a Congressman or Senator with
respect to anything that he does after he takes the oath of
office, our case would be difficult, although, as Mr, Justice
Marshall has suggested, it is very hard to accept the conclu­
sion that taking a bribe is a legislative act even within a
very broad definition of that term.
As we see this case, the case can be proved without
bringing into question any legislative
debate.

act •— any speech or

The only word in the indictment which gives me any

pause at all is the word "vote".

If the word "vote" were not

there, if we now excise it and make no use of it, I can find
nothing in the indictment which is in any way in conflict
with the speech or debate clause.
It is suggested, turning to another matter, that the
matter of punishing a Senator who takes a bribe is, by the
Constitution, committed solely to that House of Congress, and

40
that Congress as a legislative body has no power to deal with
that, I should think that that was adequately disposed of by
this Court's decision in the Burton case some 60 years ago,
where a Congressman was convicted under a statute for taking
fees in connection with appearances before the Executive Branch
of the government; and more recently in Powell v. McCormack,
where a similar argument was made that the power of Congress,
of the House or Senate to exclude was exclusive, and that that
prevented the court from giving a declaratory judgment on the
matter.
Both of those cases seem to me to dispose of that
contention.
Then, finally, as has been suggested in the argument,
it seems to me that the — or our position is here that the
offense was committed when the bribe was solicited or taken,
with the requisite intent; it is immaterial thereafter whether
any action/ including even any legislative action 3hort of
speech or debate was done.

The argument is rather similar to

that which was rejected in the case in the Second Circuit
involving Judge Manton, where a part of the defense was that
it's a different statute, the case is not controlling but the
analogy is close,

Part of the defense was that though he took

the bribe it didn't influence his decisions at all if the
cases were decided right.
tod a part of the charge which was sought to be

41
submitted to the jury there was that if the cases were decided
right, then he couldn't be convicted.
That was — that argument was rejected by a Court of
Appeals, on which Mr. Justice Sutherland sat, and the decision
was that the taking of the bribe completed the offense and it
was not necessary to show that the promised action was carried
out.
Similarly here the taking of the bribe, at least with
the requisite intent, is the essence and the substance of the
offense? and, as we see it, it is not necessaz-y to prove
certainly any speech or debate in order to maintain the
prosecution.
Accordingly, we think the judgment below should be
reversed.
MR. chief justice BURGER;

Thank you, Mr, Solicitor

General.
Thank you, Mr. Ramsey.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:14 o’clock, p.m,, the case was
submitted.]
