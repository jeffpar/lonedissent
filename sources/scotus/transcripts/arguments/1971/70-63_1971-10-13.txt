ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J» COME, ESQ.#
ON BEHALF OF NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
MR, COME;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please th®

Court;
This case is here on certiorari to the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and it presents
a question involving the interpretation of th® jurisdictional
dispute provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.

Nov/,

Section 8(b)(4)(D) of the National Labor Relations Act, which
is set out at page 3 of the Government's brief, makes it an
unfair labor practice for a labor organization to strike or
threaten to strike an employer for an object of forcing him to
assign work to employees in a particular labor organization or
in a particular trade,eraft,or class, rather than to employees
in another labor organization or in another trade, craft, or
class.
Now, Section 10(k) of the Act provides that whenever
it is charged that any person has engaged in an unfair labor
practice within the meaning of Section 8(b)(4)(D), the Board,

5

instead of immediately proceeding in the regular complaint,
unfair labor practice fashion that it does with other unfair
labor practice charges, holds that unfair 8(b)(4)(D) charge
in abeyance because 10(k) states that"the Board is empowered
and directed to hear and determine the dispute out of which
such unfair labor practice shall have arisen, unless the
parties to such dispute submit to the Board satisfactory
evidence that they have adjusted or agreed upon methods for
the voluntary adjustment of the dispute.”
Now, the Board, since 10(k) was added to the Act in
1947, has interpreted the phrase ”the parties to such dispute”
to include not only the competing unions but also the
employer who made the work assignment.

Hence, unless all

three parties have agreed upon methods for the voluntary
adjustment of the dispute, the Board itself must determine the
dispute under Section 10(k).
The court below, ;by a divided vote, held that the
parties to such dispute means only the competing unions, and
thus, since they but not the employer were bound by a voluntary
method of adjustment, the Board had no power to redetermine
the dispute under Section 10(k) ; and the correctness of this
interpretation is the issue that we have here.

i

Now, the underlying facts are briefly these;
The Plasterers' Union picketed two different jobs
in furtherance of its demand that the work of applying a coat

6

of Portland cement mortar to the walls upon which tile

was

to be thereafter installed should bs assigned to employees
represented by the Plasterers rather than to those represented
by the Tile Setters Union.
The first job involves an addition to a library at
the University of Houston.

The general contractor,

South­

western, had subcontracted the tile job to Texas State, a tile
contractor employing members of the Tile Setters Union.

And it

subcontracted the job of installing the tile.
The Plasterers claimed toe mortar work was theirs,
and when that claim was rejected by Texas State, the sub­
contractor, they submitted the dispute to the National Joint
Board for the Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes, a tribunal
established by the Building Trades Department of the AFL-CXO,
and certain employer groups.
Both unions, by virtu® of their affiliation with
Internationals who are members of the Building Trades Depart­
ment were bound by decisions of toe Joint Board.

But neither

Texas State, the subcontractor, nor the association to which it
belonged had agreed to be bound by the decisions of the Joint
Board.
The Joint Board awarded the disputed work to the
Plasterers, finding that toe matter was governed by a 1917
agreement between the two International Unions and a 1924
decision interpreting that agreement.

7

Parenthetically 1 might point out at this point
that the whole dispute arose because of the development of new
bonding agents that weren’t discovered until 1950.
But, nonetheless, the Joint Board awarded this work
to the Plasterers, based on the 1917 agreement.
When Texas State refused to change its work assign­
ment in accord with the Joint Board award, Plasterers
commenced picketing at the jobsite to force such a change,
Southw©stern, the general contractor, filed charges with the
Board alleging that the picketing violated Section 8(b) (4) (D)
of the Act.
The second job involved the remodeling of the Rainbo
Bakery.

There Martini, a tile contractor, under contract with

the Tile Setters Union, was assigned the job of installing the
tilej Plasterers claiming the work, began picketing.

Again

Martini was not bound by the procedures of the Joint Board,
and, accordingly, it filed unfair labor practice charges
with the Board.
The Board's regional director, finding reasonable
cause to believe that the charges had merit, and finding that
neither of the employers, either Texas State or Martini, were
bound by a voluntary method of adjustment, proceeded to a
10(k) hearing, at which both the competing unions and the
employers involved presented argument and evidence — it was
a seven-day hearing -— in support of their respective positions.

8

The Board, on the basis of the record thus developed
and in conformity with this Court's decision in CBS, which
directed the Board to consider all relevant factors in
determining the jurisdictional disputes, so the Board considers
the collective bargaining agreements between the parties ;
employer,area,and industry practice; relevant skills and
efficiency of operation; agreements between the two unions,
and the Joint Board award; on the basis, after considering
all of these factors and the evidence adduced, the Board
concluded that employees represented by the Tile Setters
rather than those represented by the Plasterers were entitled
to the work in dispute.
In short, it came out differently than the Joint
Board had, which had awarded the work to the Plasterers.
When th© Plasterers refused to comply with the Board's
determination of the work dispute, the Board's General
Counsel at that point issued a complaint upon the 8(b)(4)(D)
charge which had been held in abeyance in the expectation that
the Section 10(k) determination would have settled the matter.
When it didn't, under the scheme of the statute, you pick up
the unfair labor practice end of the case again.
issued.

Complaint was

It went to the Board, the Board concluded that the

picketing by the Plasterers violated Section 8(b)(4)(D) and it
issued a cease and desist order requiring the Plasterers fco
cease this activity and to post appropriate notices.

9
As indicated earlier, the court below refused to
enforce the Board's order on the ground that the Board had no
power to redetermine the dispute.
Now, as I indicated at the outset, the abstention
clause in Section 10(k) comes into play when the parties to
such dispute submit to the Board satisfactory evidence that
they have adjusted or agreed upon methods for the voluntary
adjustment of the dispute.
Now, Congress didn't define who the parties to the
dispute were, and it didn’t indicate whether "dispute’11’ means
the underlying jurisdictional dispute or it means the dispute
and the jurisdictional strike, which has emanated from the
dispute.
The court below construed the term "such dispute"
to mean merely the basic work controversy, and it concluded
that only the two Unions were parties to that dispute because,
in the words of the court below, "the employer in a juris­
dictional dispute is a neutral caught in the crossfire between
the disputing unions, and unable to satisfy either; he cares
not how the dispute is decided but wants merely that it be
decided."
Now, we submit, therein lies the fundamental error
in the court’s reasoning; namely, that the employer is
necessarily a neutral party to a jurisdictional dispute.
Q

what is the language you've just quoted?

You are

10
quoting from what, the CBS opinion of this Court or fche Court
of Appeals opinion in this case?
MR. COME:

I'm quoting from the Court of Appeals

opinion, Justice Stewart, at Record 375.
Q

That's attached tc your brief, too, isn't it?

In the Appendix?
MR. COMEs

It's in the yellow or the buff-colored

appendix; 375.
Q

The court was relying on the opinion of this

Court in the CBS case?
MR. COME;

Yes, Your Honor.

It purported to find

support for its position in this Court's opinion in CBS, where
this Court did refer to a jurisdictional dispute as a dispute
between two unions.

But we submit that no one would quarrel

with that characterisation as a general proposition.

The

issue in CBS was not this issue, this Court had no occasion
to reach it, because in CBS none of the parties were bound by
a voluntary method of adjustment; the only question was:
conceding that the Board had power under Section 10(k) , did it
properly exercise that power when it merely rubber-stamped
the employer's work assignment and did not undertake to
consider all the other relevant factors.
And this Court said that the Board had to determine
the dispute in the conventional way that an arbitrator would,
by considering all the factors; and fche Board certainly

11
complied with that obligation here.
Now, furthermore, in CBS you had a somewhat atypical
situation in that the employer there employed both groups of
employees;

He employed stagehands and he employed the

technicians.
In that sense

in that kind of a situation, perhaps

more so than in others, he's relatively indifferent as to which
group does the work.

That is not the typical case, nor is

the situation here.
In the typical case, which is typified by the
situation in the building construction industry, the employer's
economic interests will be directly affected by the assignment
of work and thus, in no meaningful sense, can he be said to be
a neutral or indifferent as to its outcome.

Indeed, John

Dunlop, the first Chairman of the Joint Board, has stated,in
a passage that we quote in our brief, the fact that some
unions work exclusively as a matter of policy or custom for
particular contractors tends to convert competition among
contractors also into jurisdictional disputes between unions.
More accurately, the disspute is between a contractor
and a union on one side against another contractor and union
on the other.

And this is certainly what we had in this case.

Indeed, in recognition of the employer's interest,
the National Joint Board, from its inception, has included
employer groups in its structure; and it has operated under

12

the explicit, principle that an employer is not bound by its
procedures unless he has specifically so agreed.
Turning to the facts here, neither Texas State nor
Martini has a collective bargaining agreement with the
Plasterers11 Union, but both had one with the Til© Setters
Union.

Neither employed plasterers.

An award of work to

Plasterers would have required these contractors either to
hire a new complement of employees, whom they believed were
less skillful and whose rates were higher than those of Tile
Setters, or to give up their subcontracts.
In these circumstances it can hardly be said that
Texas State or Martini were neutral as to how the work
assignment dispute was resolved.
Now, the court below supported its reading of the
statute by relying on the fact that the employer is not bound
by a Section 10(k) determination of the Board, ergo he's not
a party.
Now, we submit, in the first place, that this fact
doesn't lessen the employer's direct interest in the resolution
of the dispute and relegate him to the status of a neutral
"cares not how it is decided".
Furthermore, a Section 10(k) determination in favor
of the striking union is enforcible against the employer in
the sense that the union is free to bring strike pressure
against him, because there is the — there is an unrest clause

13

in Section 8(b){4}(D)

that excepts from the ban of 8(b)(4)(D)

a strike where the employer is failing to conform to an order
or certification of a board.

So that if the striking union

prevails in a 10 (k) determination,, the employer does not comply
with the award and reassign the work to it, it is free to bring
economic pressure on the employer.
So that in a very real sense there is pressure on the
employer here to comply with the 10(k) award.
As a matter of fact, nobody is really bound in a
technical sense by a 10(k) award, because even the winning
union doesn't gat the work in the sense that the 10(k)
determination requires the employer to change his assignment.
All that it does is to give hirn a right to bring economic
pressure, as I have indicated.
Now, the third support, principal support for the
court below*s decision —Q

What does the 10(k) order say, by the way?

I mean, what does the typical one say?

Is it phrased in terms

designating the bargaining representatives for the particular
working man?
MR. COME

%

No.

which is set forth on page

Well, let's look at the one here,
point 4 of the Appendix, where

the Board says:
"Til© layers employed by Texas State and Martini
Tile, who are represented by the Tile Setters, are entitled

14
to perform the work of applying the coat of Portland cemento
Plasterers' Local is not entitled by means subscribed by
Section 8(b)(4)(D) to force or require."
Q

Well, is that the kind of an order that the

unrest clause in (D) talks about?

It talks about an order

determining the bargaining representatives for employees
performing such work.
MR. COME:

Is that a 10 (k) order?
Yes.

The General Counsel and the Board

have so interpreted that as applying to a ~
Q

To a 10(k) order?

MR. COME:
Q

—• to a 10 (k) order.

Yes, Your Honor.

Because what they are really saying is, "Here's

some work to be don®, and the bargaining representative for
that work is a certain union"?

Is that what a 10(k) order

says?
MR. COME:

Well, the 10(k) order doesn't run to a

particular union, because always you would get into trouble
with 8(b)(2) and 8(a)(3).

It goes to employees of the craft

who may be represented by the particular union.

It doesn't

run to th® particular union as such.
Q

There is no — nobody in this case disputes that

unrest clause in (D) as referring to a 10(k) order?
MR. COME:
C

Not to my knowledge, Your Honor.

Mr. Come.

MR. COME:

Yes, Your Honor?

15

Q

In the 10(k) proceedings ■—

MR. COME;

Q

Yes, Your Honor.

— the employers were what, parties mads so by

the Board or were they infcervenorss?
MR. COME:
Q

They were parties of

by the Board.

And yet there is no order that goes against the

employers?
MR. COME;

No, Your Honor, because the nature of the

10(k) proceeding is that it doesn't even go against the union,
all it does is to make a declaration of who is entitled to
the work and who is not entitled to strike for the work.
Why isn't the — I gather the Board has always

Q

made the employer in the situation a party, has it, in the
proceeding?
MR. COME;
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

By force of what?

Q

Is it the employer who starts

he has to file

a complaint before the case is triggered, doesn't he?
MR. COME;
charging party.

Generally the employer has been the

He doesn't have to be.

It can be — a charge

may be filed by any person.
Q

Here it was the employer?

MR. COME;

Here it was the employer.

In, I would

say, oh, 90 percent of the cases it is the employer,
Q

But I gather even if the employer is not the

16
charging party, the employer is made a party by the Board?
MR. COME:

That is correct.

And that flows from the

general provision of the Board's rules which defines "party5'
as generally anyone who has an interest in the proceeding.
So that the Board ha®, from the beginning, treated the employer
as a party to a —
Q

But in no case is the order different from the

one that was entered in this case?
MR. COME:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

It simply designated the employees of the

employers entitled to perform the work?
MR. COME:
Q

If I may interrupt --

MR. COME:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, sir.

I know titles have very little significance,

but the 10(k) title is "Hearings on jurisdictional strikes".
>v

There was never a strike here, was there?
MR. COME:

There was, Your Honor, in the sense that

the picketing is regarded as a st3:ike.

You had picketing by

the Plasterers in both cas€*s, to change the -- to get the work.
And that would be deemed a strike,,

A3 a matter of fact, the

operative part of 8(b)(4)(D) says:

unfair to "engage or induce

or encourage’any individual to engage in a strike or a refusal
in the course of his employment to work on any goods."
it —

And

17
Q

In any ©vent, you read no restrictive influence

in the title?
MR. COME:

Mo, Your Honor.

Because I think that, in

labor parlance, a strike and picketing are pretty synonymous.
Wow, .1 was just going to say, in conclusion, that”
the court below» found support for its position in the legis­
lative history of 8(b)(4)(D) and 10 (k).
Q

Incidentally, may I ask —

MR. COME:
Q

Yes.

Kow long has the Board adhered to its inter­

pretation of parties in this?
MR. COME:

Since 10(k) was added to the statute in

1947.
Q

And what was the first case under that?

MR. COME:

The first case t*as a case called

Westinghouse.
Q

What year?

MR. COME:
Q

1940 What?

MR. COME:
Q

That was in 1949. 83 .NLRB 477.

1949.

All right.

.And the Board adhered to that

interpretation ?
MR. COME:

Yes, Yota: Honor.

We have listed some

of the cases in Footnote 6 at page 15 of our brief.
The court below, as I indicated, found support for

18

its position in the legislative history of 8(b)(4)(D) and 10(k).
We submit that its reliance is misplaced because,, as
Judge McKinnon pointed out in his dissent in the court below,
Congress really did not focus upon this particular problem in
the legislative history.
You will find statements in the legislative history
describing a jurisdictional dispute as a dispute between two
unions, which is a truism that nobody would seriously quarrel
with? they have their origin in a dispute between two unions
or between two employee groups, but it doesn't follow that
the employer has no interest, certainly where, as must be the
case before the Board can get into the act, he has been
implicated by a strike or a strike threat.
Secondly, the court relies on the fact that Senator
Morse, who proposed a 10(k) provision which, as he proposed it,
gave tha Board the alternative of either deciding the dispute
for itself or appointing an arbitrator, which was taken out
in conference, indicated that he felt that this would be
inducement to the unions, as it was in War Labor Board days,
to settle the jurisdictional dispute themselves.

If you had

hanging over them the club of government determination of the
dispute.
Mow, we submit there's nothing inconsistent between
a desire to have the two unions resolve it for themselves on
the one hand and, on the other, saying that if they're not

19

able to resolv@ it by themselves, a binding or final determina­
tion can't count if it excludes the employer.

Which is the

problem that we have here.
Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Com®.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY WAYNE S. BISHOP, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER, TEXAS
STATE TILE & TERRAS!ZQ CO., INC., ET AL.
MR. BISHOP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In the few minutes that I have here I would like to
emphasize two points of statutory language, which I think are
relevant to support the determination of the Board here.

As

Mr. Com® indicated in his argument, the real question here in
terms of statutory language is:

what did Congress mean by

who are the parties to the dispute by which the unfair labor
/

practice arose?
It is our contention that this dispute must have
arisen out of the union's disagreement with the employer’s
work assignment, not just the union's disagreement with another
union over who is entitled to claim this work.
I think this can be illustrated by the facts in this
case in the Appendix, pages 17 to 19, the factual sequence is
indicated.
The factual circumstance was that the respondent

20
union, the Plasterers' representative sought and demanded the
work in dispute here in a series of meetings over several
months, after the employer had indicated that he would assign
the work to the Tile Setters.

The Tile Setters were employees

of this employer, who were members of the Tile Setters Union;
the employer had no contract with the Plasterers.
There was no picketing over these several months
while the parties discussed this.
Q

And as long as that was true, no unfair labor

practice complaint could be filed and no 10(k) proceeding could
be started?
MR. BISHOP:
occurred.

That's right, not until the picketing

And with regard to the question —
Q

Let's assume

MR. BISHOP:
the picketing start?

the picketing does start, then —

I think the question is:

why doss

Then that explains who the dispute is

really with.
The picketing starts because the employer has given
an indication to the union, or the union has some reason to
believe that the employer is going to assign the work in
question to the other union.
Q

And in that event is not going to assign it

to the picketing —* the employees' representative of the
picketing union?
MR. BISHOP:

That's right, Mr. Justice Brennan.

21
G

But iff before the employer gets to the Board

with a complaint, the picketing ceases although the dispute
hasn't ceased, there can be no 10(k) proceeding?
MR. BISHOP:
don't see

how

If there is no active picketing, I

an 8(b)(4)(D) charge, is filed.

Q

Let's assume there is picketing and a complaint

is filed, and the 10(k) proceeding is started and the
picketing then ceases?
MR. BISHOP:

I think it would depend upon what

circumstances the picketing ceases.
Q

I think what --

Well, the parties say that there is no unfair

labor practice going on, and there can't be any 10(k)
proceeding.

I m®an the unions say that.

MR. BISHOP:

If the unions at that point indicate

that they have settled th© dispute, if one union issues an
indication that it has disclaimed any interest in the work,
then the Board, under its Safeway doctrine, will not hold a
10(k) hearing.
Q

Even though the employer objects?

MR. BISHOP:
Q

That’s right.

Let’s assume the —

MR. BISHOP:

I think there has to be a disclaimer

at that point.
Q
says,

Well, one union disclaims it, but the employer

"I’m sorry, the disclaiming ion ion is the union I want

22

to do the work. "
MR. BISHOPs
Q

Right.

If that —

Let's assume the Tile Setters in this case had

disclaimed.
MR. BISHOP;
Q

If the Tile Setters do disclaim?

And the employer says, "I don’t want the

Plasterers, I want the Tile Setters."
MR. BISHOPs

Then the Board dismisses the

8(b) (4) (D) .
Q

Well, then, how can it mean that "parties”

includes the employer?
MR. BISHOPs

Because the — well, there's an

indication to the statutory language, under 8(b)(4)(D), that
Congress intended under similar circumstances that there
would still be an 8(b)(4)(D).

That is, by a change in the

language in 8(b)(4)(D), where, under the Senate bill as it
was originally passed, the Senate passed language that the
dispute over the work assignment has to be between the two
unions involved.

In conference this was changed to make it

broader than the two unions involved, but also the non-union
employees of the employer.
Q

Under that —

I suppose if one union disclaims it, what that

really means is that it's refusing to do the work?
MR. BISHOPs
Q

That really means that —

So why would the Board ever dismiss it?

23
MR. BISHOP:

That really means that there is no

active jurisdictional dispute,, because the —
Q

Well, there is.

The employer wants the Tile

Setters to do it, and the Tile Setters refuse to do it.
MR. BISHOP:
Q

But the —

Why do you apply the Safeway doctrine?

MR. BISHOP:

Well, there really is -- the employer,

under that circumstance, has the option of assigning someone
else; he’s not forced to assign it to the picketing union.
He may assign it to other of his own employees.
But the absence of a claim under that circumstance
means no 8(b)(4)(D).

What would happen, if the employer does

not want the Plasterers to do the work, —
Q

Do you think that’s very relevant, how you

define "parties" then, under 10(k)?
MR. BISHOP:

Well, I think not.

Because I think

what happens is the employer assigns work to v7homever he
wishes at that time, and the Plasterers then come back again.
Q

Well, then, it’s a question of the way the

union — the procedure then for the union.

I mean instead of

coming up on these facts, unions can always abort the 10 (30
by one disclaiming, if they really settle the dispute.

All

they have to do is add one more step to their settlement,
namely, A disclaims.
whatsoever.

In this case it has no importance

24
Q

That simply means that there is no dispute

existing, doesn't it?
MR. BISHOP;

That's right.

There's no reason to file

an 8(b)(4)(D) at that stage? there is no dispute
Q

It has been filed and the employer says the

dispute is not settled, “I don't want the Tile Setters" —
"I want the Tile Setters not the Plasterers."
MR. BISHOP;

But if the Tile Setters don't want the

work, I think there is no basis under which Congress or the
Board could force the Tile Setters to take that work.

And the

employer then is at his option, he may assign it to another
group.

The Plasterers come back and pickets at that time.

This group does not complain.

We have our 8(b)(4)(D) and our

10(k) determination.
Q

Then the power to moot the 10(k) proceeding is

in the two unions?
MR. BISHOP:

The power to moot the 8(b)(4)(D) also,

but it does not moot it in terms of the employer ultimately.
The employer can still assign the work according to his choice,
and we then go back to the same proceeding again.
Q

Thank you.

MR. BISHOP:
Q

But the —

Going back to this illustration, if the Tile

Setters simply refuse to do the work by disclaimer, there
isn't any power in Congress or the employer or anyone else to

25
make them do it, is there?
MR. BISHOP;

I think not.

I think this is with

regard to the question Justice Brennan asked earlier, and
this —

MR. BISHOP;

Q

Could he fire them for refusing to do the work?

MR. BISHOP;

They are employees of his, I think he

possibly could, as long as there is not some discriminatory
motive, or anti-union discriminatory motive, I think that
would be a basis under which he could discharge employees for
failing to carry out the vxork assignment.
Q

If they then —■

Anyway, you do agree, then, that the unions do

have power to dissolve the entire 10(k) proceeding by
agreement and a disclaimer?
MR. BISHOP;

Right.

I agree with the Board’s
4

Safeway doctrine, but I don’t think it's entirely controlling
under the circumstances her®.
8(b)(4)(D) shows this.

I think the language of

Because Senator Taft, in the conference

agreement he explained to the rest of the Senate that the
intention in changing the language of 8(b)(4)(D) was to permit
th® same statutory protection when an employer assigned work
to his own non-union employees as when there was a two--"onion
dispute over the work

26

Under this circumstance it seems quite indicative that
Congress meant that that would be a dispute* essentially
between the union and the employer.
dispute* you see.

It's not an interunion

They are not tv?o quarreling unions under

that circumstance.
The Congress must have meant* under that circumstance*
that the Board would be a party to a 10 (k) hearing because
there would be — a 10(k) hearing would not have much relevance
to a reasonable determination if only the ohe'^union was there
presenting their positions

the unrepresented* the non-union

employees would not have a power under their own resources to
represent themselves.

The employer would be the party there

in the 10(k) hearing representing the work assignment.
We think this is a very strong indication of intent
on the part of Congress to make the employer a party to the
dispute.
I would like to make one comment with regard to the
question that Justice Brennan was asking about with regard to
the Board not binding the employer in the 10(k) award.

1

think this ties in entirely with the entire scope of the Act*
whereby Congress has intentionally kept the NLRB and the
government out of the substantive terms and conditions of
employment.
I think this is further indication, what Congress
did in 10(k)* they could have given the Board authority to

issue a 10 (k) order which would have bound the employer and the
union»

That would have made a compulsory arbitration or

But Congress decided not to do that.

All they did was restrict what circum­

Q

Just a moment, Mr. Bishop.

The issue before us,

as I understand it, is whether the Board should have abstained

MR. BISHOP;

That's right.

So the questions that Mr. Justice White is

putting to you I suppose don’t go to that, do they?
Actually, whether or not the proceeding is aborted,
whether or not it's terminated, whatever the case may be, the
issue we have to decide is whether the Board properly initiated

That's right.

23
In that regard, Justice White, I think it's important
that some of the cases that are cited in the —
Q

Well, would it ever damage one of the unions to

— if they really settled the dispute — to also disclaim?
Why wouldn't the union against whom the settlement operates
always be willing to disclaim, if there's really a settlement?
MR. BISHOP:
Q

Through the Joint Board procedures?

If they are bound by it and there's nothing

they can do about it, if they've agreed to it, and it's really
settled, how would it ever damage the union to just go ahead
and say "We disclaim"?
MR. BISHOP:

If they disclaim the work and the work

is assigned to the other union, you say the losing union, under
a 10(k)?
Q

Well, if there’s a settlement, the unions

settle between themselves who is going to get the work? is
that right?
While the union that isn't going to get the work, I
would think would always be willing to disclaim, and abort any
possibility of an unfair labor practice proceeding or a 10(k)
proceeding„
MR. BISHOP: Well, the union who did not get the work
under that circumstance, if he does not adhere to their
settlement, for reasons of his own, then has the opportunity,
if the case does go to the NLRB, of having the Board decide

29

that he8 s entitled to the work„
Q

What that means* then* is that the case really

isn't settled.

I mean it hasn't really been settled between

the unions.
MR. BISHOPs
Right.

It has not been ultimately settled.

I think that's more a problem of the voluntary

settlement procedure having provisions for enforcement of
their decisions, among those parties.

I have no quarrel with the Safeway

I think it's in the absence of active claims

for the work, the Board does not proceed on an 8(b)(4)(D) or
a 10(k) charge.
Q

In this connection, Mr. Bishop, what was the

practical result as to this job in Houston, or these jobs?
Who did the work down there?

30

MR. BISHOP

%

The practical result was that the Til©

Setters, who were the -™ or the employees represented by the
Tile Setters did the work.

They vrere the employees of the

contractor, and they received the assignment of the NLRB.
Q

Well, does this tie in to Justice White's

comment, then, that there really wasn't a settlement between
the two unions?
MR. BISHOP:

There was not a binding settlement

between the two unions.
Q

Despite what the Joint Board —

MR. BISHOP:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Bishop.

Mr. Capuano.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD J. CAPUANO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PLASTERERS' LOCAL UNION NO. 79
MR. CAPUANO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Board, in its argument, right at the conclusion,
mentioned, in answer to a question, 23 years of NLRB precedent
which is involved in this case.
It is certainly true that this decision, or the
Board's position in this issue has been followed for 23 years.

31
However , I think it's fair to state that there is
more reasoned analysis in the decision of the Court of Appeals;,
which is on review here, than there is in the sum total of
©very case the NLRB has decided this issue in 23 years.

The

NLRB simply has refused to analyze its position, the legis­
lative history, this Court's decision in CBS, simply, as on®
of the petitioners states in his brief, couches its decisions
in statutory terms, always denying the voluntary adjustment
procedure any credibility when the two unions or the two labor
groups are bound.
Q

Well, isn't it correct that the courts have

historically allowed the Board, with its presumed expert
experience, wide latitude in dealing with the practical
aspects of these things?
MR. CAPUANCs

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, the

courts have allowed the Board wide latitude in dealing with
practicalities.

But 1 think what we're dealing with here is

policy, policy that Congress set down in Section 10(k), and
therefore the Board does not have the latitude it would if it
was simply applying a mechanical doctrine.
Q

Well, as a practical matter, then, I take it you

disagree with the statement of the Court of Appeals that the
employer is just an innocent bystander who doesn't care one
way or the other about the outcome of the jurisdictional
disputo?

32
MR. CAPUANO;

No, I agr€as with that statement because

I believe what Judge Lever».thal was stating there is what the
legislative history reflects, and that is that this section of
the Act, and has this Court has said, in fact the whole dominant
theme throughout Section 8(b), 8(b)(4) is to protect neutral
employers.
Just last term, as a matter of fact, in the Local
825 Operating Engineers8 case, at 400 U.S., this Court again
reiterated what it said in National Woodwork, and we believe
it was actually affirming, reaffirming itfhat it said in CBS.
The protection of this section of the Act, 10(k) and 8(b)(4),
is to protect an employer's neutral interest.
Now, Judge Leventhal recognized, and we certainly
have conceded in our brief, that there are employers who have
preferences.

Of course there are, no one would deny that.

And Judge Leventhal recognized it.
But the Act, this particular section of the Act, or
these two sections, were not designed to protect that prefer­
ence.

They were only designed to protect the neutrality of

that employer when he1s caught between the two warring unions„
Now, he may also have a preference, but he can
support that preference once the 10(k) decision is decided,
or the two unions agree voluntarily, then one union goes back
to deal with the employer, and at that point, under the whole
structure of the Act, his economic interest can be protected

33

by self-help.

And we believe that's exactly what Judge

Leventhal was saying, and that is exactly the intent of the
whole Act»
Q

But, in this case the Plasterers weren't working

there at all*
MR. CAPUANO:

Oh, yes, Justice Marshall, the Plaster­

ers were working there for a plastering contractor.
on that job.
Q

They ware

In fact —
They were on that job?

MR. CAPUANO:

They were the ones who put the scratch

coat, which is the preliminary coat, on the wall, after while
the Tile Setters came and put their float coat on.
Q

They were regular employees of the contractor?

MR. CAPUANO:

Well now, they weren't regular

employees of the tile setting contractor, they were regular
employees of the plastering contractor, who also had a stab —■
yes — who also had a sub- —
Q

Then they weren't employees of the tile setting

contractor?
MR. CAPUANO:
Q

No, sir.

That is correct.

So would the subcontractor have an interest

in protecting his own employees —
MR. CAPUANOs
Q

Yes, sir, he has an interest —

— outside, with the local?

MR. CAPUANO:

He has the interest, but Congress —

34

Q

But that's not sufficient, then?

MR. CAPUANOs

No.

I say that Congress said in the

10<k) proceeding that isn't where his interest was going to be
protected.

His interest was going to be protected after the

two unions had settled between themselves this dispute, and
then one union would go back and deal with the employer.
I mean, his interest is being protected in this manner, just as
if his tile setter employees, during the course of that job,
said they wanted 20 cents an hour more.
Q

I just think, in view of this, that the employer

— the last thing he'd want would be one more union to deal
with.

Am I right?
MR. CAPUANO:

That may very well be the case, yes,

but that is not the interest that Congress said should be
protected.

Because, you see, Justice Marshall, if Congress

had wanted to give him that sort of protection, they would
have drafted 10(k) so that he was bound by the decision.
As it stands now, tinder Section 10 (k), the employer
can demand a Board hearing, he can demand a Board hearing —
I mean a Board order which is going to bind the union, but
which then the employer can completely ignore.
Mow, we think if Congress wanted to do what you
suggested, they would have said, ’’All right, Mr. Employer, you
©re now going to be bound by this 10(k) award."

But Congress

was not about to adopt any form of compulsory arbitration

35
binding the employer and the union in the. Act,
Now, we think that the language of Section 10(k)
supports our position very clearly.

The last sentence states,

and we have quoted it in our brief on page 8 — and our brief
is the red one *— "Upon compliance by the parties to the
dispute with the decision of the Board or upon such voluntary
adjustment of the dispute, such charge shall be dismissed."
Well, as I just indicated, the employer doesn't have
to comply with the decision at all.

If the two unions

involved comply, the charge is going to be dismissed, the
employer can go on making the assignment as he pleases.
Now, clearly, if the employer doesn’t have to comply,
certainly the words "parties to the dispute” in that last
sentence cannot include the employer.
The first sentence also uses the same phrase,
"parties to such dispute".

There again, if in the last sentence

it means only the disputing unions are labor groups, we submit
it cannot mean anything differently in the first sentence,
But, more importantly, the first sentence, with regard to the
word "dispute", states —- and we have this quote at page 10
of our brief — "The Board is empowered and directed to hear
and determine the dispute out of which such unfair labor
practice shall have arisen."
Now, the Board, in its brief and argument, has said,
well, the dispute there means a jurisdictional strike.

36

Well; we submit the dispute cannot mean the
jurisdictional strike? that the jurisdictional strike is the
unfair labor practice»'

And if you made a substitution of

terms in that very sentence, it would read that the Board is
empowered and directed to hear and determine the dispute out
of which such strike arose.

The strike is the unfair labor

practice.
And I think a short analogy would be in a discrimina­
tory discharge case.

That's an unfair labor practice.

The

discriminatory discharge itself ie the unfair labor practice.
The unfair labor practice doesn't arise out of the
discriminatory discharge, and we simply cannot understand the
basis of the Board's argument that the strike equals a dispute.
We also believe that this Court, in CBS, answered
that question, and in answering that question it was a necessary
predicate to the Court's decision in CBS.

Because — I think

I should go back a little bit prior to CBS, to recall just what
the Board was doing.
For 13 years the Board, when it held a Section 10(k)
case, was simply determining the validity of the jurisdictional
strike.

The Board would state in its decision whether the

striking union was.entitled to the work because of an out­
standing Board order, certification, or collective bargaining
agreement.

If it wasn't, then the employer's assignment was

affirmed every time.

37

Therefore, the Board was equating the dispute that it
had to determine with the validity of the jurisdictional
strike.
When the case came to this Court, Justice Black,
writing for the unanimous Court, very clearly and necessarily
determined what the word "dispute” means in 10(k).

And if I

may quote him — and this is at the bottom of page 14 of our
briefs
"And the clause 'the dispute out of which such
unfair labor practice shall have arisen' can have no other
meaning except a jurisdictional dispute under Section
8(b)(4)(D) which is a dispute between two or more groups of
employees over which is entitled to do certain work for an
employer."
Now, we submit
Q

It doesn't say that's the only thing it is.

That is a statement of an obvious truth, that the dispute is
what you have just read.

But it doesn't say that that's all
I

it is, that that's the only way you can have a dispute, does
it?
MR. CAPUANOs

I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that the

way it is written, referring specifically to the clause in
Section 10(k), that he's clearly talking about the use of the
term in 10(k).
Nov;, of course, in another situation not involved
*

38

with 10 (k) ,

dispute may mean something else. But this is why

we believe that this question, as to what dispute means in
10(k), has been settled, because the Court there was
specifically referring to 10(k).
With regard to the voluntary adjustment or
abstention provision of 10(k), this Court in C3S also made
reference to it and explained that the Board, in the case
before the Court then, had to hold a 10(k) hearing because -and I'm paraphrasing the Court

because the two unions, the

Technicians and the Stagehands, were not able to settle their
dispute.
The Court stated — and again this is quoted on page
14 of our brief ■— "Section 10(k) offers strong inducements to
quarrelling unions to settle their differences by directing
dismissal of unfair labor practice charges upon voluntary
adjustment of jurisdictional disputes."

Close quote.

The Court of Appeals here recognized that once it is
determined what dispute is covered by Section 10(k), the
parties to the dispute, for the purposes of the abstention
provision, necessarily means the two disputing labor groups or
unions.

It can have no other meaning.
Now, we rely, of course, as I've stated, on CBS,

and we submit that this Court, in CBS, relied upon the
legislative history of this Act and the thrust of the Act.
The Court went into the legislative history rather thoroughly,

39

and, while we don't think a reanalysis is necessary here, I
think briefly I would like to say a few words about the
legislative history.
The House bill that was introduced in 1947 did not
contain any provision similar to Section 10(k).
was introduced in the. Senate by Senator Morse.

Section 10(k)
Fortunately,

in this particular situation, we have a very clear statement
as to where the idea for Section 10(k) developed.
Senator Morse explained in the legislative history
that while he was a member of the War Labor Board, one night
a very serious jurisdictional dispute occurred between two
unions, which resulted in a work stoppage.

Senator Morse

stated that the War Labor Board called the unions together
and they told them to get the men back to work or, if they
didn't, the War Labor Board was going to appoint an arbitrator
to settle the dispute.
Wow, the only fair reading from this point of the
legislative history is that the two tin ions got together and
settled the dispute.

Because there is somewhat of a gap there,

Senator Moms simply goes on to say the men went back to work,
But I think the only fair reading is that they got
together, settled the dispute, and the men went back to work.
But, in any event, Senator Morse then went on to
explain that he decided the War Labor Board ought to have a
policy, to avoid these situations in the future.

So he proposed

40

a resolution which became that policy, which said to the two
unions involved;

You have 24 hours to settle the jurisdictional

dispute without economic action? and if you don't, we are going
to appoint an arbitrator to settle it for you, and it's going
to be binding on you.
And, as he explained, he wanted to get the same
incentive into the Act? and that's why he proposed Section 10(k),
which was adopted almost completely the way he proposed it.
There is only one deletion and that is that Senator Morse
proposed that if the two unions or — excuse me — if the
parties, in the language of the statute, could not agree upon
a settlement of the dispute the Board could hear the dispute
itself or the Board could appoint an arbitrator to hear it.
The provision allowing the Board to appoint an
arbitrator was deleted.

It was deleted without comment in the

conference.
But we submit that we had a very clear statement from
Senator Morse as to what the reason for Section 10(k) was for
being put into the Act, or being proposed.

Other legislators,

Senator Murray for example, also echoed his hopes that this
provision, Section 10(k), would encourage unions to set up
machinery to settle jurisdictional disputes themselves before
governmental action was necessary.
In effect, then, Congress established a scheme for
tii® settlement of jurisdictional disputes, which resulted in

*

41

work stoppages, which we think is clearly discerned from the
statute and -the legislative history.
It's got four steps.
First, there's a jurisdictional dispute between two
unions, which results in a work stoppage.

Congress said that
* loft)
work stoppage is going to be halted by a 10-hour injunction.
Second step:

Congress proposed 10(k).

It said in

Section 10(k) we're going to have an opportunity for the two
unions to get together and resolve their dispute.

The

abstention provision.
Step three:

If the two unions or labor groups can't

resolve their dispute,, themselves, then the NLRB is going to
have to make a binding determination of that dispute in the
10(k) hearing.
Step No. 4:

Out of the voluntary mechanism, or out

of the 10(k) hearing before the Board, one union will prevail.
One union will go back and deal with the employer, will
negotiate.

Each will be able to use their own economic

weapons at that point.

Congress was not imposing substantive

terms on either the unions or the employer.

Congress

recognised that what it wanted to do was to protect the
neutral employer, the employer caught in the middle, the
helpless victim between the two v/arring unions.

The legislative

history, beginning even with the House statements and the House
report, all show that Congress was concerned about the neutral

42
employer, the innocent victim of the warring unions* the helpless
victim caught between these two unions.

And* as Justice Black

said in CBS * the employer who is caught between the Devil
and the Deep Blue.
That was the interest that Congress was trying tc
protect.

That was its policy.

Of course the employers may

have a preference* but Congress did not grant* in Section 10(k)
or 8(b)(4), protection of an employer’s economic interest.
Congress reserved that issue to the normal prophesies of
collective bargaining.
And we submit that what the Board is trying to do
here is establish its own policy as to the relative economic
strength between an employer and a union dealing over a work
assignment controversy. .
But we submit the Board doesn’t have that right when
Congress has laid down that policy.
Now
Q

Well, the Board can’t compel the employer,

though.
MR. CAPUANO
Q

That’s —

Even if it settles the 10(k), even if the

Board’s power is upheld in this case.
MR. CAPUANO?

That’s precisely one of our main

arguments in support of our position, that the Board is not
carrying out its duty simply for that reason, that the Board

43

cannot force the employer to do anything.

And this employer

can ignore the voluntary procedure that the two unions have
entered into.

They can agree to the Joint Board or some other

The employer
Q

But there wouldn't be a problem here if one of

the unions were to obey the Joint Board.
MR. CAPUANO:

Mr. Justice White, the policy or the

rule that the Board is following here is discouraging unions,
it's discouraging employers from joining into these groups.
Q

Well, isn't it correct that if the Til® Setters

would disclaim the work, the whole proceeding would be aborted?
MR. CAPUANO:

Under the Board’s Safeway doctrine,

yes, sir, that is correct.
Q

Well, then, why doesn't the Tile Setters do it?

MR. CAPUANO:

Because of the policy that the NLRB

is following, that we're trying to get reversed in this case.
Q

I know, but the Tile Setters, what they're

saying is that "we did have a voluntary way of settling our
dispute through the Joint Board, but we just won’t comply."
MR. CAPUANO:

They said they won't comply because the

employer isn't bound, and that we know that if the employer
isn't bound, the NLRB —
Q

I don't care for whatever reason it is, the

employer is never bound, whether there is a hearing or not.
And so I don’t know what kind of an argument that is.

44
MR. CAPUANO:

Well, the argument runs like this:

We won't comply because the employer isn't bound.

We know that

if the employer isn't bound to the voluntary adjustment, the
NLRB will hold a 10(k) hearing.
Q

Then the employer still won't be bound.

MR. CAPUANO:

No.

But w© have a second bite at the

apple to get the work.
Q

But, nonetheless, the union is not complying

with the Joint Board determination.
MR. CAPUANO:
Q

Absolutely.

And if it did, and disclaimed, there vould ba

no 8(b)(4)(D) and no 10(k) proceeding.
MR. CAPUANO:
Q

That’s correct.

New, so what we really have here is a si nation

where not only the employer has not agreed to the settlevanfc,
but one of the unions has not.
MR. CAPUANO:

Only as a result of the Board's

policy, yes, sir.
Q

Now, wait a minute, if the union — if one of the

unions, if the Tile Setters really would comply with the
Joint Board determination, there would be no dispute here.
MR. CAPUANO:
Q

That's correct.

The fact is that they will not disclaim, they

are still claiming the work, and so they — there just isn't
any voluntary adjustment yet.

45
MR. CAPUANO:
Q

Yes, but ~

Even between the unions.

MR. CAPUANO:

Ho, sir.

We believe there was a

voluntary adjustment when they agreed to the Joint Board and
decision was issued, they are only refusing to comply because
they know they can get another —
Q

But they are refusing to comply, and are still

claiming the work?
MR. CAPUANO:
in a circle.

Yes, sir.

But I think it goes somewhat

If the Board was not following the policy or

rule which is in issue here, there would simply be no reason
for the Tile Setters not to comply because they would know
that the NLRB ~

Oh, yes, there would still be.

refuse to comply, and they could still strike.

They could still
They could

still picket.
MR. CAPUANO:
the Joint Board.
Q

Not if they lost, as they did before

They could not.

That's the point I'm making.

Why couldn't they?

MR. CAPUANO:

Because the NLRB would then seek an

injunction against them, presuming a charge is filed against
them.
In other words, once they know that they can’t get a
second bit® at the apple before the NLRB —
Q

What would be their unfair labor practice?

46

MR. CAPUANO:

Striking to force the change in the

assignment of work,, contrary to a Board order.
Q

Well, it wouldn't he contrary to a Board order.

MR. CAPUANO:
the Plasterers.
Q

Yes, because the Board order was to

In other words, the employer —
I don't mean ■— I mean the Joint Board, let's

assume the Joint Board — the Joint Board gave it to the
Plasterers, right?
MR. CAPUANO:
Q

Now, the Tile Setters didn't comply.

MR. CAPUANO:
Q

You mean the NLRB?

NLRB?

MR. CAPUANO:
Q

That's correct,

Now, if the Board gives it to the Plasterers —

MR. CAPUANO:
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes.

-- gives it to the Plasterers, then the Tile

Setters are bound.
MR. CAPUANO:

Yes, they're bound in the sense that

if they struck -Q

They would be in an 8(b)(4)(D)?

MR. CAPUANO:

Yes, sir; that's correct.

And the only reason they are refusing to be bound
by this Joint Board is that they know they can get a second
bit of the apple.

The employer refuses to be bound by the

voluntary mechanism because he knows that he can wait to see

47
how the voluntary adjustment will work out.

If his preference

isn't sustained there,, then he knows he can demand a 10(k)
hearing before the NLRB; and if his preference isn't sustained
there, he can completely ignore both proceedings and go his
own way.
Q

Now, really what you're saying is that — of

course, for this proviso to be applicable, you have to assume
there's been a settlement or a method for settlement.
MR. CAPUANO:
Q

You mean the abstention provision?

Yes.

MR. CAPUANOs

No, the abstention provision comes

into effect if the parties have agreed ■—
Q

Well, if the Board has satisfactory evidence

that they have adjusted, or agreed upon methods for a voluntary
adjustment of the dispute.
MR. CAPUANOs
hold a 10(k).

That's right.

Then the Board won't

The Board will dismiss the charge when there's

been compliance with the adjustment.
But, as Judge Leventhal pointed out, stability is
maintained because during this period a 10(1) injunction is
in effect, which is obtained by the Board as soon as the
8(b)(4)(D) charge is filed.

So the whole scheme of the

statute —•
Q

But you're saying what the Board must do is to

recognize the fact that there has been a voluntary adjustment

48

here in the sense that the Joint Board has determined the
dispute?
MR. CAPUANOs
Q

Yes, sir? that’s correct.

And that the Board must recognize that one union

is bound by it — I mean that both unions are bound by it?
MR. CAPUANOs

Yes? right, Mr. Justice White.

That’s

correct.
Q

But both unions, I gather, are not bound by it?

MR. CAPUANOs

Well, both unions are affiliates to

the Building and Construction Trades Department.
Q

But what I don't quite understand, as I gather

your argument, is agreed upon methods for the voluntary
adjustment.

Certainly they've agreed upon a method.

MR. CAPUANOs
Q

That’s correct.

And the dispute has been submitted to the Joint

Board and it's decided it, and the loser refuses to be bound.
Is that what that means that —
MR. CAPUANOs
Q

— that satisfies him?

MR. CAPUANOs
Q

He refuses

He refuses to —

For whatever reason he does,

is his position

satisfied merely because they’ve agreed upon a method?
MR. CAPUANOs

Yes, sir, it is.

The Board, in many

cases, has held that the Joint Board is a method for the
settling of disputes

49
Q

It isn't very effective, then, is it?

MR» CAPUANO;

It would be effective but for the rule

of the Board in this case, Mr. Chief Justice; because then
there would simply be no reason for a union not to comply,
because it knew it was not going to get its second bite at
the apple with the NLRB.

And with the record of the NLRB,

we submit that the losing union before the voluntary procedure
many times is encouraged to seek the second hearing before the
NLRB, where perhaps the employer’s preference would be upheld.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr» Capuano.

Mr. Gold.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF AFL-CIO, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. GOLD;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
In light of the excellence of the opinion below,
which sets out all the affirmative points upon which —
Q

It's always easy to say that when you've won,

isn't it?
[Laughter.]
MR. GOLD;
Q

Yes.

Well, there are times, although --

If you had lost you wouldn’t feel that way

about it.
MR. GOLD;

Well, there are times, Mr. Justice

50

Brennan, when an advocate is upset about the way he's won
below, he’s been brought up here and he has the feeling that,
due to certain deficiences in the opinion bslov?, he wants to
duck it.
But I want to make it most emphatically clear that
we are not in that position this time.

It’s a happy exception.

And we do most heavily rely on the opinion below
which shows that all of the accepted indicia of ascertaining
Congressional intent, the language and structure of the
particular provision, the over-all structure of the Act, the
legislative history, and this Court’s precedents, all support
our position.
Q

All of which overrides 23 years of administra­

tive interpretation.
MR. GOLD;
Q

We do believe so.

Thirteen years —

It's been a long time since that's happened,

hasn't it?
MR. GOLD;

Well, it's been ten years.

Last time it

took 13 — last time it was the unanimous opinion of this
Court which overru3.ed 13 years of administrative action, which
the Board claimed had amalgamated its reading —■
Q

What case was that?

MR. GOLD;
Q

CBS, sir.

What's your view of why this abstention pro­

vision is triggered here?

Where a union has apparently agreed

5.1
upon the method for settlement, then repudiates its entire
undertaking, and still insists on having the work.

Why, then,

is this abstention provision triggered, when not even one of
the unions wants — when one of the unions hasn't agreed on
the assignment?
MR. golds

As we read the statute, Mr. Justice White

— and the language is on page 3 of the Board's brief? I guess
that's what we've all been referring to ■—
Q

Yes»

MR. GOLDs

— the Board is instructed to defer when

it receives satisfactory evidence that they, the parties, have
adjusted or agreed upon methods for voluntary adjustment of
the dispute.
The statute doesn't merely say that there has to be
an adjustment which leads to a disclaimer.

That is one

situation, and that's the situation which the Board recognizes
Q

Well, I agree, but apparently one of the unions

has not only repudiated his agreement to abide by the adjust­
ment, but have repudicated the method of adjustment.
MR. GOLD?

Wo, they haven't repudiated the method,

they have said that in light — they have the work in their
hands, and they say they are not going to disclaim and leave
it alone at this time.
Q

Well,

"we're still going to claim the work,

regardless of the method that we previously agreed on", which

52

seems to me a repudiation of the entire procedure.
MR. GOLD ;

Well, I don’t think so, because •— it

may be repudiation, but it’s one that's correctable in light
of — we believe in light of Section 301, which applies to
agreements between unions.
Q

But what you have is --

You mean the Joint Board

a determination

pursuant to the agreement to submit to the Joint Board would
be enforcible under 301?
MR. GOLDs

Yes, I believe so.

As an arbitral award,

there is a Seventh Circuit decision involving a Textile
Workers —
Q

Has that been tried?

MR. GOLD;
Q

Yes.

An agreement between two unions?

MR. GOLD;

Yes.

There are decisions holding that

agreements between unions to submit this type of dispute to
arbitration are enforcible or —
Q

Well, why isn't that kind of an issue, then,

-- why isn't that kind of an issue a proper one for the -~
for enforcement?
I mean, I have the end result of such enforcement
proceedings, the disclaimer.
MR. GOLD; Well, it would be.

But you have problems

of —- well, he would be, it would be a judicially required
disclaimer? but what you have is, as long as the Board continues

53
on its policy of not recognizing the award, you have a
practical point.

The union which prevailed before the Joint

Board is barred from using economic force; therefore, -Q

Tell me, if the union that prevailed may resort

to 301, that's the only party to the agreement that could
resort to 301, isn't it?
MR. GOLD;

Yes.

I think so.

The party that prevailed

would be —■
Q

In this instance only the Plasterers then

"‘'"could resort to 301?
MR. GOLD;

That's correct.

The only one with an

interest could.
Q

But the employer couldn't?

MR. GOLD;

No, because he wouldn't be a party.

Nov/, there are situations in which employers are a
part of the mechanism, and, as Judge Leventhal pointed out in
his decision, where that happens then everybody is in, and
the whole matter is resolved.
But this statute, in 10(k), is only designed to
regulate the use of economic force in situations where there
has been a dispute which has ripened into a jurisdictional
strike.

At that point, under Section 10(1), the Board comes

along and gets an injunction.

It then holds the 10(k) hearing.

At the 10(k) hearing it determines which union is to be allowed
to use economic force.

54
That: is what the statute does.

It is drawing out

the interunion dispute and, as Mr. Capuano put it, stating
which party will come back, will be allowed to use economic
force.

That is the only effect.
And that’s why we think the government’s argument

that 10(k) is meant to settle jurisdictional strikes is wrong.
It is not.

That’s exactly the argument that was made in CBS,

that because the employer isn't affected by the 10(k) award
they have to give the work to the union that the employer wants
to give it to.

But that is not the point of the statute.

This part of the statute, as all the other parts,
are consistent with what this Court has emphasized, from
insurance agents through American Ship and, most recently,
in H. K. Porter. that where you have an economic issue the
parties are to work that out.

And therefore Congress, in line

with the whole scheme of 8(b)(4)(D), as you point out, Mr.
Justice Brennan, in National Woodwork, only protects employers
in the position of neutrals.
We're not arguing here that the employer doesn’t
have a preference.

As a matter of fact, this isn't a fact

question. We recognize that employers may have a preference as
a matter of fact; but the only thing that has been protected
is their interest in being free of the conflicting claims
of disputing unions.

Q

Their only —

In other words, the question before us?; isn’t it?

55
MR. GOLD:

Well, as I said, Mr. Capuano has tried

to spell out our affirmative arguments and, as I say, we think
they have also been spelled out fully by the court below.
I'm saying that we believe that every one of these indicia
points to the fact that employers in the positions of neutrals,
that the interest in neutrality or the interest in being free
of competing claims, is the only one protected.
And, as I say, we rely on the language of Section
10(k), which would be nonsensical, since it talks about
compliance with the award if parties included employer, it is
shown by the whole structure of 10(k) which only deals with
the use of economic force.

It's shown by the whole structure

of the Act, which says that,except when the employer is in the
position of a neutral, economic matters between he and unions
are to be settled by the parties through economic force.
And it’s shown by the legislative history, which is
indicated in page 16 of our brief, where every comment made
indicated that Congress was focusing on the situation of an
employer who's a helpless victim, who's caught between unions.
And there isn't a single indication, and we believe
you would need the strongest indication, in light of the whole
structure of the Act, there's not a single indication that
this was a provision to pull the economic chestnuts out of
the fire of an employer who had a particular preference.
Q

Mr. Gold, on that I gather your whole argument

56

really comes down* for all the reasons you’ve suggested, that
in this case there was a method agreed upon.
MR. GOLD;
Q

Yes.

And that’s if there exists an agreed-upon

method; and that ends the case.
MR. GOLDs
Q

Yes.

And that whether or not the method is in fact

employed — suppose it's not employed at all?
MR. GOLDs
Q

No.

I think that the parties have to —

They at least have to employ it; is that it?

MR. GOLD;

Well, you have to give satisfactory

evidence that they have adjusted or agreed upon method.
Q

All right.

It's an agreed-upon method, but it

must be at least employed by —
MR. GOLD:

Yes, I think somebody would have to make a

claim and get a — in the process of getting a decision.
Q

All right.

as you would go.

But you stop short, that's as far

Then it's resorted to, and the Joint Board

decides it, and the losing union repudiates the agreement; and
you say that's immaterial.

Nevertheless, as far as the

statute is concerned, the Board has no jurisdiction.
MR. GOLD: Right.

And of course at that point there

is a method of assuring — the statute provides methods.
Again, as Judge Leventhal points out, the statute provides a
method of assuring that the employer will not be caught between

57

those two unions.

The losing union can be subjected to the

judicial — can be brought to a judicial tribunal to correct
its — the error of its ways.
Q

The Board's answer is that, there is another

party, the employer; but if the Board, even if the employer is
a party, dismisses the proceeding and there's a disclaimer,
I would think you would say — which you do, I take it — that
when there's a binding method agreed upon, the Board should
recognize that it is binding on the parties and it should be
therefore equivalent to a disclaimer.
MR. GOLDS

Right.

Our argument, very simply, is that when the Board —
Q

Evan if the employer is a party, I mean.

MR. GOLDs

Right.

We’re saying that where the

Board, under its so-called Safeway doctrine, dismisses on a
d isclaimer, it’s giving effect to the language "the parties
have adjusted".

And we're saying what they're failing to do

here —
Q

Yes, and then you wind up by saying that it's

not for the Board — for the cease and desist order that brings
the repudiating union in line, it's some other method of
enforcement.
MR. GOLD:
Q
something?

Right.

Right.

Under 301 or, I take it, @ State proceeding or

58

MR. GOLD; Well, I think it would be 301.

But I would

point out that the Board plays a role, and they admit it in
Footnote 21.

What happens is, if you have a repudiating union,

that union cannot utilize economic force, because the Board
treats its order of dismissing the proceeding, or quashing
the hearing, as a Board order, and treats the losing union as
if it had lost before it.

And if that losing union ever tries

to use economic force, it will get a 10(1) injunction against
it.
Q

Well, it v?ould have to be a new proceeding,

though, wouldn't it?
MR. GOLD %

No.

There would be an 8(b)(4) (D) charge

against that union, the losing union.
Q

Another charge?

MR. GOLD s
Q

Yes.

Well, why is that?

They wouldn't be striking

contrary to an order if it8s just a dismissal on the grounds
that there is no longer the basis for a 10(k) proceeding.
MR. GOLD: Well, as I say, the Board takes the
position, and I think it has to because the whole purpose of
the statuta would be undermined, that the dismissal is the
equivalent of an order? and that somebody who — a union which
strikes after a dismissal on the ground that there has been a
settlement is striking contrary to a Board order.
Because the whole purpose, as Senator Morse explained

59

it* as we note in the introductory section of our brief* the
whole problem here* prior to 10 (k)* was that there were union
methods of settlement which Congress wanted to encourage, but
which didn't work where a union had a great deal to lose.
They would defy the tribunal.

That was before 301, as well,

since this was in 1947.
Q

Has there ever been a 301 proceeding to enforce

one union —
MR. GOLD:

There are some 301 proceedings pending,

as I —
Q

Has any one come to decision?

MR. GOLDs
decision.

I'm not aware that any has come to

I would point out, as I indicated, that on the

in the brief in opposition, the case of United Textile
Workers versus Textile Union of America, 258 Fed 2d 743, is
cited; and that is the case holding that an arbitration to
decide if a dispute between two unionts is enforcible under
301.
But, as I started — just to conclude the thought I
was on;

The whole theory of the statute would be undermined

if an order quashing the hearing was not an order for the
purposes of 8(b)(4)(D), because, as I started to say, you had
unions which wouldn't comply because it hurt too much.
they would try to use economic force.

Then

And the whole purpose

of 10(k) is to put a final spur into ~ is to give an impetus

60

to compliance by taking away the right of the losing union to
use economic force.
And once that's taken away* that union is in very —
Q

Well* v;hen there's a disclaimer and the Safeway

doctrine is applicable and the proceeding dismissed* is that
dismissal order the — would the dismissal order be a basis
for a charge* if the union repudiated the disclaimer?
MR. GOLDs

Yes, Your Honor.

That is the lav/ cited

under Footnote 21 of the Board's brief.
And I would just note again in conclusion that the
striking thing about the Board's presentation is that it makes
no affirmative argument.
in the statute.

It doesn't point to a single basis

Every argument is based on the notion that

the employer has an economic interest.
And our answer to that is:

that was not a protected

interest* so far as Congress was concerned.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you* Mr. Gold.

You have four minutes left for rebuttal, Mr. Come.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY NORTON J. COME* ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
MR. COME:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I think that when all is said on the other side we
com© back to what* in our view, is really the central
question here; namely* whether or not* in view of the vital
interest that the employer has in the resolution of a

61

jurisdictional dispute * plus the fact that Congress was
interested in having these disputes settled in the public
interest, it is reasonable to assume that Congress, although
it was perfectly willing to encourage the unions to try to
adjust these matters short of economic pressure, intended that
when you got down to the nitty-gritty of being unable to
resolve the matter, and having pulled in the employer through
economic pressure, Congress could have intended that there
would be a binding settlement that would exclude the interests
of the employer.
After all, certainly it seems rational to believe
that if there is going to be a final and binding resolution,
it's going to be —
Q

But it isn't binding on the employer.

MR. COMEs

Well, it's binding for all practical

purposes, because the employer is not long going to stand up
under the economic pressure of a picket line or a strike.
Where there is weighty compulsion on him to comply with the
©ward.
Q

Do you agree, Mr. Come, that these Joint Board

awards are enforcible under 301?
MR. COME?
Your Honor.

I think that that's an open question,

I think that — there’s one case that's cited,

where they tried to enforce it against the employer, and the
court refused to do it on the ground that since he was not a

62

party, it could not be enforced against him.
There are a couple of cases in the lower courts that
have enforced it against the two unions.
mean?

But what does that

That still doesn't compel the employer to reassign the

work.
Whereas, under our setup, he would be subjected to
economic pressure ~
Q

Well, one of the suggestions is that the Board

is the more efficient remedy.
MR. COME;
Q

Well —

It doesn't say that there aren't other

remedies.
MR. COME;
Q

No.

That is correct, sir,

If Congress intended that they ought to resort

to other remedies, I suppose they could.
MR. COME;

Well, I think that's the basic problem,

and I think that you don't get any answer to this from the
legislative history, because, as is often the case, the
problem that comes up is one that wasn't directly focused on.
So you have to bring to bear, we believe, the realities of
the situation.

And the big reality here is the employer's

economic interest in the matter, and certainly it's a form
book rule of law that you don't make — I don't want to use the
word "binding", because this isn't binding in the technical
sense — but you don't make a substantial decision that is

63
going to affect the interest of a party, at least in the way
that the employer’s interest is affected here by being
subjected to a picket line, what I do point out of at least
1 etting him be hurt.
Furthermore, since this is to be settled ~ I'll be
finished in a moment, Your Honor

in the public interest,

you want a proceeding that's going to insure that it will bring
out all factors, including factors of economy and efficiency
of operation.

And when the employer —
t

Q

I couldn't agree with you more, but if Congress

legislated otherwise, I suppose it's for Congress to put it
in order.
MR. COME;

That is correct, Your Honor.

But, as I

say, one of the tools that we believe has to be brought to bear
here is the economic realities of the situation, which, we
submit, Congress could not have been blind to.
Thank you.
Q

Well, your basic organization or superficial

level of the matter of statutory construction is simply that
the parties to such dispute includes, or may include, th®
employer.
MR. COME; That is correct, sir.
Q

And Congress did legislate, just th© way you

said it did.
MR. COME; That is correct5 and that is, even if you

64
interpret "dispute" as the court below interpreted it.

It is

not central to our argument that dispute has to be the dispute
over th© jurisdictional strike.
We think that -Q

Right.

MR. COME;

— because even if .it's only a dispute

over the work assignment, the employer is a party to that,
at least at the point where he isn't willing to go along, which
he certainly wasn't willing to do in this case.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Come.

Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11s37 o'clock, a.ro„, the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
