MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

We will hear arguments

next in No. 27, Kitchum against Foster.
Mr. Smith, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
OEM, ARGUMENT OF ROBERT EUGENE SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE APPELLANT
MR. SMITHi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
This case arose in the State of Florida, in a town
called Panama City, in which a State Court judge granted a
closing requested by the prosecution of an adult book store,
selling adult materials.

And so identified.

This was predicated after a hearing in which the
trial judge, looked at a certain few publications, and felt that
if these were representative the whole store should be closed.
It was injunctive
Q

You say "representative'5, representative of what?

Of all the books, or —
MR. SMITH;
Q

— of some of the books, or

MR. SMITH;
and Life,

Yes, sir? this is —

This is not a store that was selling Time

Consistent with what some counsel view the decisions

?
of this Court, since Redrup, to meari, it was an adult book
store, identified as an adult book store, and, you know, you
must be 21 to enter

4
So that no one would enter and be intruded upon, on
their privacy, looking to buy Indies? Homs Journal or something
of this nature.
So we are dealing with only adult merchandise, and
the concession, or any representation that all the material
was adult-only oriented; whether it be pocket novel, whether
it be girlie magazines.

There were all adult-only oriented

material«,
That was the way the view of the judge, wo suggest,
looked at the entire thing; and that’s what I mean by the
tar® "representative"s

adult-only versus reporfcorial or

newspapers or things of that nature, sir.

And —
Q

Well, do you suggest that soma of the things

that were in evidence and used by the judge were representative
of Ladies Home Journal, for example?
MR. SMITH;

Mo, sir? it was not contended that —» we

said it was representative of it, of the material, and all the
material was adult —
Q

W^ll, what you mean to say, in adult material,

is that it’s material that deals explicitly with sexual —MR, SMITH;

Well, maybe not explicitly, it; * a . suggestive

or it9s —
Q

Well, it deals with sex?

MRo SMITH:

Ripe materials, yes, sir.

Q

And that*s what it is?

MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir*

And that was the whole contents of the store?

MR, SMITH:

Yes, sir,

Wes for adults only, roto-type materials.
Q

Yea.

MR, SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir.

Whan you say "material", was it all literary

or pictorial material?
MR. SMITH:

A■combination, air.

Mostly pocket

novels, but a lot of girlie type, magazines? primarily girlie
type magazines that were either — also some cover girl and
exciting, which we are involved in in Bloss vs. Sykema, that
have been held by this Court, by a 4~to-3 decision, then,
seemingly to be protected.

These same publications ware in

that particular store,
Thereafter, a -*•
0

Do you say it was all literary or pictorial,

was it, or did it involve articles of clothing, and things
like that?
MR. SMITHs

It did not involve articles of clothing,

it was strictly an adult book store, yes, sir.

Q

Right.

MR. SMITH:

And thereafter an injunction was sought,

a temporary restraining order was sought? complaint was filed,

6
asking for a three-judge court»

Judge Arnow granted a temporary

restraining order,, after first having found that Combrowska. ra..
Pfisfcer circumstances were present, irreparable harm —
Q

Excuse me, Mr. Smith,

May 1 asks

in this

Florida statutory scheme, is this business of a procedure by
which a vendor’s place of business could be closed, is that a
section of the general statutory scheme —
MR. SMITH;
Q

-- dealing with obscenity?

MR. SMITH?
Q

Dealing with obscenity.

Yes, sir.

And now, I gather, they have other alternatives

besides criminal prosecution or, perhaps

or are they ~~

MR. SMITH: This was not a criminal prosecution,
Your Honor.
Q

Ho e I understand that.

But isn’t there also a

provision for an injunction against distribution and sales of
magazines?
MR. SMITH:
Q

And this procedure — this procedure is what?

MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir.

A nuisance.

A nuisance.

And that’s independently of the

injunction procedure?
MR. SMITH;
G

Yes, sir.

That’s correct.

Now, in either case, whether either procedure is

employed, may it then be followed by a criminal proceeding?

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, in this particular case, a

criminal procedure had predated the civil procedure.

They

had taken seme of the publications which were the subject of a
pending criminal case and utilized those in the civil procedure
that followed thereafter.

The injunctive relief sought was

as to the closing of the entire store ~~
Q

Perhaps that answers my question. Then, I gather,

either the injunction procedure or this closing procedure
may be conducted independently of any criminal proceeding.
MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir? that6s correct.

Is that it?

MR. SMITH:

Thafc,js my under standing , yes, sir.

The temporary restraining order was issued by a
— Judge ArnoWc

Thereafter a — Judge Amow issued another

temporary restraining order continuing it, pending i hearing
on a three-judge court, because the trial judge wanted to cite
the petitioner for contempt, because he 'had offered something
for sale after the Federal District Court had said that the
injunctive order was hot proper, or at least was stayed pending
the three-judge court hearing.
Nevertheless, ultimately we got to the question of the
three-judge court.

And after the three-judge court had

convened, this Court decided the Atlantic Coast Rail Lines case.
And that seemed to close it as far as the three-judge court was
concerned below.

They vacated all injunctions that were

8
pending,, and they denied the injunctive relief sought below
based, they said, upon the anti-injmiction law as interpreting
it from the Atlantic Coast r

Linar case.

This, we suggest now, is a civil proceeding; this is
not criminal, single criminal proceeding as we had in some of
the other cases that this Court decided, as in Younger vs.
Harris.
Q

And not dealing with — I want to be sure —

not integrated with any criminal proceeding?
MR* SMITH?

Ho, sir? it was not integrated.

It was

a separate proceeding and the judge’s order was to close the
entire business, and to not remove from the premises any of
the publications that were there. And ultimately;, thereafter,
he issued an order allowing the publications on the premises
to be seised? and. we have set out a list of the publications
which were seised in the Appendix* most of which are in the
handwriting, I think, of the sheriff and his deputies? and that
is in — it’s a rather substantial compendium, beginning on
page 198 of Volume 1 of the Appendix in this case, and
continuing through to the end, to page 251.
So these were the publications which were seized by
virtu© of the court order after the closing.
Now ~~

Q

What’s happened to them?

destroyed or any tiling?

Have they been

9
ME. SMITH:
Q

No, sir, they have not been destroyed.

May they be —
;

MRo SMITH:
0

They have been returned *»-

Oh,

MR» SMITH:

— since that time, as a result of

other activities that occurred in the judicial system in the
State of Florida.
In another' case, which Mr. Marky has called to the
i'

attention of this Court, and I believe he has placed it in the
bade of his brief,, called Kltchum vs, Sohaub, the Florida
Supreme Court, when considering the issue, a comparable issue,
decided that the judge below had been a little too ambitious,
and, too, in his rulings and reversed upon the concept of Near
vs, Minnesota.

And this was July 9, 1971,

after this Court

had noted probable jurisdiction in the Mltchurn vs. Foster case.
Q

And this was in another case?

MR. SMITH:
Q

But with Mitchum as a party?

MR. SMITH:
Q

A separata proceeding, sir.

Yes, sir; and Mr. Marky and I ware counsel.

And involving the same material?

MR. SMITH:

No, sir.

Same type of material, but not

■— a different geographical location.
Q

But you never went to the Florida Supreme Court

in this case?
MR. SMITH:

Sir, we went to a different court, went

io
to an appellate court, and it's working its way up.
Q

I know, but you didn’t attempt to go to the

Florida Supreme Court?
MR. SMITHs

It’s working its way up at the present

time, I gather? except this is what has occurred, Your Honors
The court, the intermediate court of appeals treated it.

Sn

Florida, if a constitutional question was presented, the State,
in this particular case, the Mitchum vs„ Sehaub, moved to
transfer the matter because'of its importance as a constitutional
issue out of the District Court of Appeals and into the Supreme
I
j

Court.

While the other case ended up in the District Court
of Appeals, and the District Court of Appeals affirmed Judge
Fitzpatrick*s order below, and said that what had occurred in
this case was proper and Judge Fitzpatrick was not wrong, just
as late as 29 November 1971.
In anticipation, we suggest, of this case being heard
today, Judge Fitzpatrick entered a final order and said, in
essence, that he had been overbroad in his interpretation
and he was now cutting back and limiting the effect of his
order.
November 2$, 1971.
Q

In this case'?

MR. SMITH?
Q

1 will leave a copy —

In this case.,

On what circumstances?

11
MR» SMITH:

To the publications which were before

him*
Q

Were they the same —

MR. SMITH:

Mo, sir; to the publications, the similar

named publications which are before the Court
Q

But the store remains closed now?

MR. SMITH:
G

The store is now out of business.

I mean then.

MR. SMITH:

It remained closed for a substantial

period of time, yes, sir, pending going through the appellate
route.
4

So, again, it want to a District Court of Appeals,
which affirmed Judge Fitapafcrick1s order.
0

Right»

Could you have gone any further then in

the Florida courts?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, we would have gone had it not been

for the entry of this order.
Q

For the entry of this order.

Q

Modifying orders?

MR. SMITH:
Q

Of the modifying orders?

MR. SMITH:
Q

Pardon?

Yes.

November 29, 1971.

Well, what about — what's your position with

respect to what's left under the order?
MR, SMITH:

We have a petition for rehearing pending.

12
.In that particular case»

And what’s left of the order, in

essence, Your Honor, is that no longer do we have a nuisance
law closing which says that the entire store is closed#
Tour Honor, it is questionable, in all candor, based
upon what happened on November 29, 1971.
Q

Could you speak a little louder?

MR. SMITH#

It is questionable, based upon what

happened on November 29, IS71.
Q

Of,course now, I take it, if you can afford it

you can open the store and — with everything except those
few

—
MR. SMITH?
0

Yes, sir.

-- that were before Judge Fitspatrick?

MR. SMITHs That would be correct.

That would be

correct.
/'

Q

He withdrew his injunction closing the store?

MR. SMITHi Closing the entire business,
Q

Where is that in the record?

MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir.

Pardos, sir?

Where is that in the record?

Id. SMITH:

This is a brand new — this just came

down, sir? 1 just got it, I think it was —Q

Could we have copies?

MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir? 1 will leave it here.

If you leave it with the Clerk, ha’ll make

13
copies for us»

It might have helped if those bad bean supplied

to the Court in advance of today3s argument.
MR, SMITHs

Yes»

Unfortunately, Your Honor, I just

got this on Friday *— on Monday from local counsel, that -« of
course it’s not Mr. Marky's fault, but —■ .
We had argued and said that the law in florida is
unconstitutional. We raised a facial attack upon the
constitutionality of the law as it is -- the obscenity law.
Myer vs. Austin is a case which has been pending in this Court
for some 13, 14 months, and which two of the three-judge court
in Jacksonville declared the Florida obscenity law to be
unconstitutional,
0

I think, though, Mr. Smith, the present state of

the judgment below doesn't raise this question at all.
MR. SMITH:
Q

No, sir.

How can we have a judgment before us; that —

under which you ean appeal it?
MR. SMITH:

In the case below we raised many issues

regarding the constitutionality of the law, including its
facial and its application.
Q

Did you seek damages, as well as —

MR. SMITH: We sought damages as well.

We said the

irreparable injury at the time we instituted suit was the
holding of the court closing the entire store.

The three-judge

court said, We don't reach any of your issues, because, under

14
3j^-Y?-e3 case, we are now foreclosed from
acting under the Civil Eights Act.
Q

Well, now, suppose the three-judge court had had

before it this order of November 29? would they not have been
right?
MR, SMITH?

Working on the standing based on the

Atlantic Coast _Rail Lines case?
Q

Well, in doing nothing without reason

MR, SMITHS
Q

No, sir,

Are you interested in sustaining the — in this

case, the power of the three-judge court to issue an injunction?
MR, SMITHs

Yes, sir.

We want to go back to the

three-judge court, and have our full hearing on the merits
involving the obscenity law in general, as we have attacked it.
And not just what has occurred here,
Q

Well, did you raise the.

facial attack in the

State court?
MR, SMITH?

We raised the facial attack in the

Federal Court,
Q

Before Judge Fitzpatrick?

MR, SMITH?

Yes, sir? it was raised before Judge

Fitzpatrick.
Q

And that was raised in the Court of Appeals?

MR, SMITHs

Yes, sir.

Raising and preserving, of

course, is England vs, Louisiana Medical Examiners, that it.

15
requires us to.
So this is where I come, having to argue the case,
as we suggest, predicated upon what had occurred on November
29 th.
We suggest that, if we’re permitted
Q

Did you say that what you submitted, do 1

understand you correctly, followed what England said when you
submitted the constitutional question to the State court?
You said you were not, however —
MR. SMITHS Waiving —
q

— waiving your* right to come back to the Federal

Court?
MR. SMITH:
Q

On those issues if they're decided against you?

MR. SMITH5
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes.

Wall, you may not have waived, but you — the

State proceeding was underway before the Federal proceeding
was ~MR. SMITH:
Q

— was started.

MR. SMITHs
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, it was a civil proceeding underway.

And England is an abstention ease, where there

hasn’t been any State proceeding pending.
MR, SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir.

Except after abstention.

16
MR. SMITH:

But there is some language which suggests

that we should say something, as was done in this case.
The — we're asking for the right to have the — to
say that the 2283 does not act as a bar to injunctive relief
when a proper case is made out, and we say that at the time we
made out a proper case, we don't think circumstances have
been rendered moot, and we’d like to have a chance to have the.
Court consider the other constitutional arguments regarding
the statute, which were raised at that time, and to seek
prospective criminal injunctive relief from cases which are
not now pending.
The history of the anti-injunction statute is of
course one that starts back in the early days, in 1870 — 1773
when the first act was passed by the Congress.

,

It has bean

suggested that the first act may have been limited only to the
Justices of this Court.
However, SO years later, this Court considered that
was ®i?t so, and held it applicable to all of the courts.
There were subsequent amendments that occurred,
particularly after the 194.1 Ten cay case, in which the — certain
exemptions existed in the law and were stricken out.

And

thereafter the exemptions stricken out, a relitigation of
issues already decided by the Court.
And Justice Frankfurter seemed to suggest, in the
Toucey case, that the exceptions to the anti-injunction action

17
could be inferred from other Federal legislation, and it did
not have to expressly say so»
After Justice Reed, in dissenting this case, felt
there should be a certain flexibility supplied by judicial
interpretation, and seemingly, in 1948, it was recodified*
That was the partial prospect involved.
In the loiter Minerals case, the Court said that the
anti-injunction statute did not apply to the United States, and
so it was perfectly — it could be an exception in that regard.
Seemingly as an issue of policy.
This Court decided in .1955, the Amalgamated Clothing
Workers vs. Richtean Brothers case, in which Mr. Justice
Frankfurter again spoke for the Court, and, in essence, Mr.
Justice Frankfurter suggested that this Court could not whittle
sway the intent of Congress .in the Anti-in junction Act.

In 1970, when the Atlantic Coast Rail Linos case
came down, the decision said that a federal injunction could
,fidt be obtained unless — because of the anti-injunction
statue.

That was not a civil rights case; and so wa say that

there would be some exception to it.
There have been many decisions throughout the country.
There is an amicus brief that has been filed here from the
Third Circuit relating to certair judgments of the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals.

There are Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals

judgments, and three-judge court judgments throughout the

18
Fifth Circuit, which are wide-ranging.

There6 s a new one out

by Judge Goldberg, cited fc'obbs vs. Thompson, this is brand new;
it's just been reported in the advance sheets, 448 Fed 26, 456,
in which Judge Goldberg undertakes to explain what this Court
meant in Younger vs. Harris and the other cases.
But it seems t we suggest, that the anti-injunction
statute gives way, when we8re dealing with public rights
versus private rights.

Because we think that that seems to be

implicit in the Laiter Minerals Company case.

And we say that

when there are public rights, because of the need to protect
and preserve the public rights, that the anti-injunction
statute could be considered not to be applicable.
Q

Why is this — is this an argument that 1933 is

within the —
MR. SMITH:
Q

— special authorization exception under 2283?

MR, SMITH:
that.

2283 — oh, yes —

It8s different.

Mo, sir? I art! not saying

We of course have argued that, in our brief, but, aside

from that, we think there are essentially three grounds:
is, is it an exception?

one

And in this context, the argument

Ism taking now, it is not necessarily exception but that, as
a matter of policy, whan, seemingly, private versus public
rights are involved —
Q

Well, then, that means we have to leave in —

what do we do, leave a brief on 2283 out of the picture

19
entirely?
MR. SMITH:

No, sir.

anti-in junction statute.

It just — in fcha — there’s an

Leiter i Mineral a vs. U. J3this Court

said it wasn’t meant to apply to the United States Government.
Q

That’s right.

MR. SMITH:

Because the United States Government was

protesting public rights.
Q

Well, we said that only a couple of weeks ago

in another case ~™
MR. SMITH:
0

~~ involving the

MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes.
National Labor Relations Board.

Yes, sir.

But — now, what are the rights of the United

States Government involved in that?
MR. SMITH:
Q

I see.

MR. SMITE:
Q

— termed it rights of the people.

In other words

MR. SMITH;

Q

We say rights of the people —

Public rights.

— not only is the United States not bound by

the prohibition of 2283, but also something called the rights
of the people?’ is that it?
MR. SMITH:
eights„

Yes, sir — well, public versus private

Judge Griffin Bell

Machesky vs, Bisssel,

of

the Fifth Circuit, writing in

which Is mentioned in our brief, talks

2 i.

about the difference between the two categories, and suggests
that, as a. matter of comity, that the ~~ that when public rights
©re involved, the anti-injunction statute —
Q

And what are the public rights here?

MR» SMITH:

Here it is the right of the public, the

First Amendment right, the chilling of speech, the right to be
able to use and close up an entire business entity, which is
offering — at least presumptively protected First amendment
materials? and we say that this is the right in this, and
Mr. Justice Brennan, writing in, for instance, Quantity Books
vs. Kansas, this Court pointed out that the public, in
essence would only bs able to have access to publications which
had been the subject of seizure, depending upon the right of
the distributor to get additional copies, which themselves would
be subject to seizure.
And that it was the public, seemingly, the public's
right to have access to non-obscene materials, which could
be. involved.

-

So we're talking throughout —
Q

But you're not talking about the public, you’re

talking about the adult public.
MR. SMITHs

We’re talking about the interested adult

public, yes, Your Honor.
Q

Well, that’s the only group you’re talking about.

MR. SMITHs

Yes, sir, because there is nc question

21
of minors ■—
Q

That's not the public.

MR. SMITHs

Yes, sir.

There's no question of minors

involved here at all.
Q

Well, I mean it's not the public in general?

this is a class of the public you're talking about.
MS. SMITH: 'Yes, sir.
Q

Are you addressing yourself to the case as it

is now or the case as it was before ~~
MR. SMITHs
Q

The case as it was, Your Honor.

-- the 29th of November?

MR. SMITHs

The ease as it was, in all candor.

We

say that in Dorabrowskt vs, Pfisfcey, the distinction of saying
that if you win the race to the courthouse door, it’s all
right, and you can stay in the Federal court, versus saying if
they win the right — they win the race to the courthouse
r ‘

V.

i-

door and follow in the State court, you don't have that right,
and say he's artificial.
Q

They may be artificial, but not with — it's

rather the whole point in Section £283, which dates back to the
Year One of the existence of —
MR. SMITHs
Q

— this country as a nation, isn’t it?

MR* SMITHs
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir,

That's the whole point of it.

22
MR. SMITH*
Q

Who wine the race»

MR. SMITH:
Q

But we say that the —

— the ~ the —

Whoever wins the race, then the litigation pro­

ceeds in that court,

tod that’s exactly what 2283 has the

effect of saying.
ME, SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir.

It goes back to the very first Congress of this

nation.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

The conflict between federalism

and the State court rights to proceed is the same, because,
immediately after a federal court enters, has a suit entered
t

and the State court proceeding is undertaken, them.',

still

becomes a possible conflict with —
Q

There “is no conflict if the federal court stays

out of it, and is told to stay out of it.
ME, SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir.

That’s exactly the purpose, the self-evident

purpose of 2283 and its predecessor was to keep e> federal court
out of it; and thereby to avoid conflict,
MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir.

Bo you agree with that?

MR. SMITH;

Yes, sir.

It seems that that would be

the original purpose, yes, sir.
Except when there's unusual circumstances, that this

23
Court
Q

Well, wouldn't vou agree also, Mr* Smith, that

the federal judges have no monopoly on enforcing the Federal
Consfitution *
MR. SMITH?
Q

Yes, sir? that’s correct.

That's equally the responsibility of State judges,

isn’t it?
MR. SMITH? That’s correct*
Q

Well, then, I don’t quit® follow you.

The

State courts don’t have one whit different responsibility from
federal judges*
MR. SMITH:

Mo, sir? but if -- suppose special

ciruni3tances seams to be present, and if they were present,
there would be a justification, we suggest, for the federal
court to intervene.

It makes it clear that there is this,

a certain type of harassment*

If there is the irreparable

harm involved in this —*
Q

The only harassment that we*ve seen ~~ we said in

the Younger line

cases, of course, that harassment, bad faith?

but is that suggested here?
MR. SMITHt

Yes, sir.

It is*

But if, in the Younger

line of cases, this Court has said that bad faith ana harass­
ment may be the type of situation which would allow an
injunction to proceed, then isn’t it saying that 2283 is not
an absolute bar to the impositions?

Welly it isn’t., because we expressly saved that

0

question in those cases*
MR. SMITH %

Well, there, of course, there's a

conflict as to whether —
Didns t we?

Q

MR. SMITH5

— you did or did not.

Coast Rail Lines case seems to say no.

The Atlantic

Your Honor, it seems to say that this is — that nothing is an

Q

Yes, but in Atlantic Coast Line there wasn’t any

question of harassment or the lack of good faith.

And if you

prosecution that lacks good faith, what you’re

really saying is that it's not a State prosecution at all.
MR. SMITH: Well, then that’s what it comes back to,
Q

This doesn't qualify as a prosecution.

MR. SMITH:

It qualifies as a prosecution, yes.

It is a prosecution,
Q

Well, if it's just a harassment,which --

MR, SMITH:

'

But then the court, in reaching that

rationale, would suggest by. then saying that the 2283 hs not
applicable in that kind of case.
Q

'

Well, but Younger va Harris line of cases 'save ■

that question.
MR, SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir? I know that.

While saying that you could have an injunction.

HR. SMITH?

Q

Yes, sir,

That’s? in unusual circumstances.

MR. SMITH?

Yes, sir.

And we say that those type of

unusual circumstances were presented in this case, first 'was
presented to the court down below, and those were the complete
closing of the business entities, on the basis that without
any question as to what would occur in the future, it was a
total, complete prior restraint in operating that business
activity,

find at that time the case was presented.

Q

M

I correct that since that time the State

courts have opened up the place., and have removed the bar
against doing business, and have returned all of the books
except the nine books;is that correct?
MR. SMITH;
Q

All that relief was granted in the State courts»

MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir, in stages ~~

On November 29, 1971»

Well, I thought you said the books were given

back earlier.
.MR. SMITH? The books were given back earlier, but
with regard to allowing the store to open «—■
Q

So, as of now, all you want is for us to declare

it a statutory injunction?
MR. SMITH;

Yes, sir.

Let us go back in the State

court and have our hearing on whether there’s other than
insufficient —

26

You mean in a three“judge court?

Q

MR. SMITH:

That's right.

I'm sorry.

A three-

judge federal court.
Q

I take it, Mr. Smith,

if, many will agree that,

1983 suits are within the express authorization exception, you
wouldn't have to deal with whether it's public or private rights,
argument, would you?
MR, SMITH:
Q

Hot as presented here, no, sir.

But you would still have to deal with them in

Younger V» Harris?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir? but ©£ course that was criminal?

this is civil.
Q

Well, you'd still have to deal with whether

Younger v. Harris rights now apply to civil cases as well as
criminal?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

Which we suggest a very excellent ■
Q

Because Younger v. Harris was a 1983 suit.

MR. SMITH; Yes, sir; I'm aware of that.
As I pointed out to the Court, there's an excellent
analysis by

— of what you all meant in Younger v. Harris in

Hobbs va, Thompson, decided by Judge Goldberg in the Fifth
Circuit.
Q

Is that cited in your brief, did you say?

MR, SMITH;

Ho, sir? that has just been reported,

Q

448, 4567

MS. SMITH:
Q

Thank you.

MR. SMITH:
q

Yes, sir,

Thank you,

Excuse me, the District Court didn't — in view

of its understanding of the effect of 2283, the District Court
did not, did it, consider any question of whether or not there
was harassment here?

They thought it was absolutely ~~ that

an injunction was absolutely barred, did it not?
MR. SMITH?

Yes, sir? but the District Court judge,

Judge Arnow ~~
Q

Well, the single judge?

15m now talking about

the District Court's final order in this case.
MR. SMITH;
Q

In no way considered that.

I mean tha three-judge court,

MR, SMITH;

Yes, sir.

In no way considered that,

because it felt absolutely barred by Atlantic Coast Dine —
Q

Whether or not there was harassment, the court

thought it was barred from issuing an injunction, did it not?
MR. SMITH; That’s correct,
Q

So it’s never had an opportunity to consider

the issue of whether or not —
MR. SMITH;
Q

That is correct,

— there was the kind of harassment that would

as
have mad© this case one of the exceptional situations referred,
to in Younger and its companion cases, because of its view
that 1983

that 2283 wholly barred an injunction in this

action, regardless of whether or not there was harassment.
Is that it?
MR. SMITHS
Q

Yes, sir.

Is that the way you understand it?

MR. SMITH?

Yes, sir.

That's right.

Q

Right„

Q

You tendered that issue of harassment?

MR. SMITH?

Yes, sir, that is facially raised in the

plea.
Q

Very good.

Thank you.

MR. SMITH? Thank you.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? Mr, Narky.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND I*. MARKY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
V

MR. MARKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court-:
The position of the appellees before the Court is
that the three-judge court proparly concluded that the antiin junction statute was an absolute bar, that 1983 was not an
express exception to that particular provision in property,
declined to grant injunctive relief.
The 'question that is not before the Court is whether

29

the coart erred in perhaps declining to grant declaratory
relief.

Thus we don't have the dilemma raised in the sextet.

Younger, et cetera, wherein,Justice Brennanf 1 believe you
discussed the differences that may exist in declaratory
relief.
So 1 ’wish to make it clear that subsequently the
court declined to grant declaratory relief? but that has not
been raised on. appeal, and it has not been cited as

error,

and it has not been argued? so X will not address myself to the
question of whether they should have perhaps gone on and
granted declaratory relief for whatever purpose it may serve.
The only reason 1 mention that is X know there's a
question of the Court as to whether the same standards are
always applicable to a declaratory relief as opposed to
injunctive relief.
Md X want to make certain that that is not in issue
before the Court.
Q

Counsel •*-

MR. MARRYs
Q

Yes, Your Honor?

Do you say that the federal court properly

proceeded to grant declaratory relief?
MR. MARKY:

No, they did not grant declaratory relief,

Your E&nor, they did include it —
Q

Well, would you say that they properly could

30

MR. MAjRKYs
Your Honor*

I don't know what the answer to that is.

There is some confusion, even is Mr* Justice

Black's majority opinion in Younger as to whether the same
standards applicable are always applicable in declaratory relief
that are in injunctive relief situations *
So —
0

Your point is that that's a question you need not

answer in this case?
Mil* MARKY2

Yes, Your Honor.

I've got enough

confusion without, that*
Q

And we need not answer it in this ease?

MR. MARKY:

Correct*

The position of the appellees is that Atl£;^tic _Ccast
Line is absolutely dispositive of the issues raised herein*
And that 1983 is not an exception to 228^\
Now, I cite in my brief several ca^es, specifically
so holding; and we are relying on, in the main, the case of
Baines vs* City of Danville, out of the Fourth Circuit in 1963,
wherein that court made a lengthy analysis of the problems that
would be created in this situation, the confusion and the
disorder over one federal judge attempting to get into the
bonafideness, or the lack thereof, of the prosecutor and
trial judge or any other institutional officers.
They also concluded that unlike the removal statute,
which, implicit within that very statute itself, is that the

31
court has total jurisdiction,
Hud 1 would agree that, by necessary corollary, that
when they remove it they have added, for all purposes,
Ksingularly”»
Thera is no such antagonism when we3re talking about
1983 and 2283,

In fact, all 2283 is is a limitation upon the

chancellor's authority to engage in & certain-limited type of
injunctive relief,* although he may occupy a general grant or
general power of equity.
And I would suggest that that is clearly correct.
Civil rights actions authorising injunctions against university
presidents, penal institution wardens, all sorts of people,
wholly and completely unrelated to the criminal State prosecu­
tion', or indeed a civil prosecution? and in that context I
would note that while there has been some suggestion that
because this is a civil case we have a problem.
But Mr. Justice Stewart, in footnote- 3 of your
concurring opinion, noted that there is no distinction in’ the
civil — in the anti-injunction statute itself, as the civil
and the criminal provision.
Secondly, I thought that the law was that each party
had the right to seek out his own forum, and I would be aghast,
%

if I were a State plaintiff, to be suddenly thrust in a federal
Court as a federal defendant f, and now having to figh

my .way
i

back into the court that I selected first.

32
So Z would suggest that because it's civil should mate
no difference as to the application of the anti-injunction
statute.

Moreover, the State, in fact, is a party in these

proceedings•

The State is trying to implement a substantial

State interest that they have, and that is expressed in the
penal laws.
Under Kingsley Books, Inc, vs. Mew York, this Court
recognised that we could use alternative methods, civil and
criminal? we have elected to attempt the civil.
In this context, 2 would like to tell the Court that
I am fully aware of — painfully aware of, I might add, in
light of the Florida Supreme Court6s reversal of my judgment
that it was in error.
1 would agree that I was wrong, just as•

the trial

judge was wrong in Atlantic Coast Line? but that is not bad
faith.

Many of us make mistakes.

I frequently do, and I

think 1 probably will in the future.
f

Indeed, my argument right here may be a mistake.
And yet I would suggest that an erroneous initial
application, and a subsequent declaration that I was wrong,
cannot retroactively go back end impute to me a bad faith on
my effort to merely augur a legal position that may or may not
prevail.
Many defendants claim the rights of Gideon, long
before they prevail; so it's not unusual that the prosecutor

33
on occasion is going to be auguring the position that may be.
contrary to the law? but I think that’s the way the law
gradually is effectuated and made more meaningful.

Bo, for these reasons,. X would suggest that it makes
no difference whether it’s civil or criminal.
Going back to Baines vs«■ City of Danville, X find it
very interesting that in Haras ley ?, Hyera, an 18 ill case,
involving a situation not unlike this, where the defendant,
the State defendant attempted to put the court, or the parties
in a squabble,, more or less to “divide and conquer” by thrusting
the State into a federal-state collision, to get this worked
out.
In the meantime there is delay, there:'s protraction,
there is confusion, and no one is properly distributed,
that judge, in the Hemsley case in 1891, concluded that it would
just be chaos to allow the question begging that goes on
invariably in these kind of lawsuitss
Is the statute constitutional?

Is there bad faith?

Et cetera, et cetera.
Interestingly, in that case, Judge Caldwell completely
interpreted 720, Section 720, the predecessor to 2283,
consistent to the way this Court did in the Atlantic Coast Lin®,
Railroad caset

that it is an absolute bar unless you can fit

within one of the exceptions.

And that the exception, which

than did not exist, the Civil Rights Act was not an exception

34
to it.

That the Civil Rights Act did nothing to change the

relationship of the State government and the Federal government?
that they remained reasonably intact»
I say that this is consistent, and it shove the
history —- the history, because this was 20 years after the
Civil Rights Act was enacted? that at that time the framers did
not in fact intend for the Civil Rights Act to be a repeal of
the principles recognised in Atlantic Coast Lina, which are
t

4.

embedded in the Tenth Amendment.
I would say that that dispute that is going on, that
went on 'with the framers, that Mr. Justice Black talked about,
that there were those who disagreed as to whether wa should
have an independent federal judiciary to determine all federal
questions.
I say that that debate was resolved by the framers,
but the debate rages on, and the debate is brought to this
tribunal? it is actually brought to this tribunal.

And I

would urge to this Court that this is not the proper place to
bring it.
The reconsideration or the. re-evaluation of the policy
decision made two hundred years ago more properly rests in the
Congress.

And I would buttress this by noting that this

Court, when they talked to the removal statuta, in a civil
rights setting, not in a dirty-book case, quote-unquote, a
legitimate civil rights action.

35
In construing the Civil Rights Act, this Court took
the view expressed by the Fourth Circuit in, ©gain, Raines vs,
Clfcy |o£ pan1 le, another case but related to removal, and
*■

strictly construed that? instead of ® statuta of this vintage
ought not be loosely construed and fcc providing the reason
thereon, to wit:

Justice Holmes noted, to cut red tape and

intervan©«
So X would suggest that this Court's interpretation
of the Civil Rights Act, and you noted in there, the absolute
chaos that would result in this respect, the appeal of the
removal ruling, perhaps to the Court of Appeals and denial of
cert to this Court? and that hearings to be conducted, 200 miles
away,

You noted that a year and a. half later, after all the

legal proceedings ware over, it might get back tc trial.
Well, 1 would like to relate this aspect to the case.
Q

How do you construe the word “inequity" in 1983?

MR. MARKY: That merely recognises, Mr. Justice
Douglas, that injunction’ may issue in, say, a suit by a prisoner
against a warden.

If there was no equity grant there, there

would be no power for a federal court, for example, to enjoin
the warden of a penal institution, or the president of a
university.
So I think the general grant of equity should not be
loosely interpreted to mean that 2283 is no longer applicable,
because Atlantic Coast Line says we must not loosely construe

this — these

2283; that it should not he eroded.

The

proper respect for State and Federal relations should not be
intruded.
Now, I am Barely suggesting ~0

There was no constitutional First Amendment

claim in Atlantic Coast Lines?

MR. MARKYs

c*»*gc»

Your Herne r, there was no mention, but

men were picketing and attempting to picket in a very public
way by which to attempt to redress their grievances in &
labor dispute.

To ignore the context, Your Honor.

What I am

saying is that if the Civil Rights Act were an exception, the
people in the Atlantic Coast Lina, although it could not have
gotten in under Norris-LaGuardia, would have been the first to
urge to Your Honors tbs Civil Rights Act.

X say it Bakes

the anti-injunction statute —
Q

1283 wasn't before us there.

MR. MARKY:

No, no, I say if you construe 1983 to

be an exception, who will need Norris-LaGuardia?

Who will

need any other statute?

They will

Who will need removal?

just file a civil rights action,

If 2283 becomes meaningless

— in fact, this is exactly what the Court held in Baines vs.
City of Danville*

They said, If we interpret, we open it up

to such loose construction, we avoid the reason for the statute’s
existence.
So I would again urge that we look at it in this

respect*

It just will not work, Your Honor»

alluded to Machosky vs* Biss©I.

Counsel has

This is also in Sheridan vs»

garrison»

The Fifth Circuit didn9t say 1983 was an express

exception»

They held, in fact, that they could grant

injunctive relief because 2283 was a rule of comity,, not an
absoluta bar*
But that was repudiated in the Atlantic Coast Line
Railroad and with it went Sheridan and Machesty»

And this, if

it please the Court, is why Judge Amow actually receded after
Atlantic Coast Line, because the theory under which he was —
q

In Florida, can you put a men out of business

permanently because of the ideas that he has, the way he’s
voted, —
MR. MAEKYs
Q

Your Honor, again, that --

—his philosophy?

MR» MARKY:

-- issue was resolved against me in the

Florida Supreme Court, and 1 concede that it was an erroneous
initial application»
it the same.

It's my feirsfc Amendment, and I respect

I don't like, of course, trampling on it.

But, quote, unquote, whenever a trampling — in other
words it requires a close examination, rhd an articulation
between opposing counsel before we can understand or even
appreciate that there has in fact been a trampling of rights.
In this respect, Mr. Justice Douglas, we had a case
that is cited in both Sheridan and Machesky, it’s called

38
e
Dawkins vs. Green.

There it was a civil rights aa.se, allegedly,

where a man threw a Molotov cocktail into a laundry store»
They filed a civil rights action in the District Court in
Tallahassee.

I handled the case.

They claimed that it

violated their First Amendment freedom and we were harassing
them.
The court granted a' motion to dismiss on my basis.
An, appeal was lodged in the Fifth Circuit»
reversed and said hold a hearing.

The Fifth Circuit

By the time we got to hearing,

Mr. Counselor said ~ files a motion for voluntary dismissal.
But the State defendant, who was then the federal plaintiff,
was gone from the custody of the State of Florida»

It was 18

months later, and he was gone.
Now, either Your Honor — I think it was in Perez vs»
?
Ledesma or in Dyson, one of the two — said, Well, who would
suggest that you can throw rocks and bottles in the name of
speech?

Yet Mr. Dawkins «jot in under the concept of

Dombrowski, which I have no objection to.

Domhrowsiel •»- that

man could not have vindicated his rights in any State
proceeding.
Q

The obtaining of the lists —
But there is a slight difference between selling

a book and throwing a Molotov cocktail.
MR. MARRYs

Mr, Justice Marshall, I think it, in

itself, it!s comparable.
Q

And 1 don't know, just because somebody says that

39
throwing a Molotov cocktail is symbolic to speech, that doesn’t
make it so.

We're dealing here with selling what could be

protected by the First amendment.
MR. MARKYs

No.

I’m not saying it is or not.

I agree with that. Your Honor, but

only when a court gets seated and starts going into the matter
can we determine whether they’re protected or not protected.
1 mean, somehow we've got to start a proceeding, unless this
Court recedes from Roth v. United States and United States v.
Reddel, and those cases.
Q

Unless you recede from that —■

But you admit that this was — you say that this

nuisance injunction is the same as a criminal proceeding.
MR. MARKYs

It disposes of attempting to enforce a

legitimate procedure„
Let me; put it in this context —
Q

What happens at the first conviction?

Was he

convicted?
MR. MARKYs

His salesmen were convicted.

Their

conviction was confirmed by the Florida Supreme Court, and no
appeal was lodged to this Court from that conviction. The books
that counsel has described, the District Court of Appeals had
first described them &s autophallicial and masturbation was
one of the books, which cannot fit within any case ever
decided by this Court.

I'm reasonably confident of that, Your

Honor„
So I don't want to get into an inquiry as to whether

40
the books were obscene, not obscene, or anything else, because
I think, as it actually happened, the State court could have
solved this.
0

tod did resolve it.
You say that the State of Florida, in order to

enforce its criminal law, must put a man out of business?
MR. MARKY:
Q

That it’s necessary?

MR. MARKYs

Q

Ho, Your Honor.

No —

Wall, why did you close him up?

MR. MARKY:

The judge concluded that the store, based

on the stipulation or the representation of counsel, that
all of the books that ware being sold were obscene,

tod since

all of the books were obscene, the store was actually operating
as a public nuisance.

Now, that judge was wrong, Your Honor,

I —
Q

Exit that’s the State of Florida, isn't it?

MR. MARKY:
Q

Yes, sir.

So the State of Florida, you say, is doing

—

needs this nuisance statute in order to enforce its criminal law.
MR. MARKY:
Q

No.

No, that!s —

That's where I get in a lot of trouble.

MR. MARKY:

— that is not what I'm trying to

suggest, Mr. Justice Marshall.

I'm saying that many times a

civil action may be a part of the State's machinery for
enforcing — is to protect the area.

For example, enforcement

4i
cases.

We have civil injunctions against it, with cine and

forfeiture, and we also have criminal penalties.
Bo the State many times uses its civil remedies *
Mow, 1 couldn't help but note counsel's reference to
Hobbs vs. Thompson, which he cited to this Court, 448 Fed 2dr
just decided by Judge Goldberg in the Fifth Circuit,

They

did say a lot about what this Court said in Younger, but the
negative predicate of younger has not been qualified by what
you do here today in this case? and Hr, Justice Stewart
noted that in either footnote 2 or 3 in his concurring opinion
in Younger vs. Karris.

It's a negative predicate.

Yon

don't decide the case, at. the same time saying, Well, we won't
answer that in these proceedings.

The case is here now to

b© decided.
But in the Hobbs case they used that negative predicate
to actually answer the question.
Q

That!s in Hobbs?

MR. M&RKYs

Yes.

And, Your Honor, at page 468 of

the Hobbs opinion you'll see this, and 1 would like to just
read it:
In the instant case we are not even faced with the
force and applicability of the anti-injunction act,

The

present challenge to the Macon ordinance and charter provisions
not only is outside the criminal sphere but also poses no
possibility of interference with pending stats proceedings.

42
The present challenge simply requests relief against allegedly
unconstitutional state action in the form of conditioning
employment upon the surrender of political activity,
?

'

?

Kowt that is nothing but Brad-dock vs, Bullitt, where
you said you could not make a man surrender his employment in
lieu of signing a loyalty oath.
about Hobbs,

So there is nothing strange

If it didn't interfere with the State proceeding,

why did it go into discussing the import of Younger?
they have now done is create a morass,

All

And 1 rather doubt

1 don't know what the law in the Fifth Circuit is,
Which goes to ths point that 1 guess the appellee is
stating? there's clear authority that this Court should not
interpret 1983 as an express exception.
Why should you not?
First of all, the practical problems mentioned in
Greenwood vs. Peacock, and I cite these in the brief.

Just

like in the Dawkins case that X alluded to earlier, 200 miles
away, 18 months later, and we don't have a defendant.

Those

are the practical problems.
Moreover, in every case you're going to have to hold
a hearing to determine the bonafideness, where, ns X think
Mr, Justice Brennan noted that, normally you should be able to
loo!?: at the pleadings to determine who first filed it, and
that ought to be the end of it.
And X say that a construction that I augur for avoids

43
the necessity of these hearings.

And, 1 might add this,

every time Year Honors — every time a hearing is held and it
is denied, the appellant is going to appeal, I mean the
plaintiff is going to appeal if it's denied.

If it’s granted,

I tell you the State will appeal, because it cannot afford to
have an order on the books declaring its officers in bad faith.
Consequently there will ba direct appeals to this
Court from every civil rights case.

And

2

think the Court can

take judicial knowledge of the increase in civil rights actions
brought before this Court under 1983, in the face of a pending
State proceeding.
Another reason is that I think that this, a
construction similar to mine, promotes the speedy, orderly
dispensation of justice.
In Florida we have adopted a new rule, guaranteeing
a speedy trial within SO days or an Immediate releases.
court docket is not art excuse.

Nothing.

The

If the man is not

tried within SO days, he is unconditionally released,
All this will do is delay and protract the legal
proceedings *
Is this Court’s interpretation, as they suggested,
necessary to the enhancement of justice and the promotion of
liberty in this country?

I suggest the answer is in the

negative,
The Fourth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, the Seventh

Circuit» and the Second Circuit, the largest circuits in the
United States, have held it’s an absolute bar and 1983 is not
an express exception»
1 would ask the Court, in those jurisdictions where
it cannot be maintained, because it is an absolute bar, which
means they do not get a hearing, have our people suffered such
a deprivation of their liberty that it is posing a serious
threat to the country?
I would suggest the answer is in the negative,
1 think that our State courts are and trying to the
best of their abilities, to the ability that God gave them,
to do justice,
Now, occasionally that may even ba questioned, but
on those rare occasions that, it does occur, this Court,
through its greater jurisdiction, because it is the ultimate
arbiter of all action, can take care of these needs.

Indeed,

that is where 1 brought my claim for relief in the M & w theatres
case, where bad faith was stipulated not to exist, and Judge
Arnow enjoined,
I sought a State order, and Mr, Justice Black granted?
it's now pending before this Court, apparently to be disposed
of in light of whatever you do in this case,

Q

But in that ease, I understand, you just told

us, that bad faith or harassment was stipulated not to exist;
in the present case that's never been done —

45
MR* MARRY:

No, all 1 *ia — what I’m saying, Your

Honor, is that I don’t think there is so much widespread
deprivation by State courts, and that’s what we're talking
about, you’re saying the State charge is in bad faith,
Q

Yas.

MR. MARRYs

And in your cases, dealing with removal

in Greenwood, you. said you should not put a State judge on
trial.

The embarrassment between the State judges and the

Federal judges in their testimonies,, and in their appearances
before each other in this case

bespeaks the answer, 1 would

suggest to the Court,
When we think that it will — when we know that a
construction such as the appellees suggest, and suggested upon
the court, makes it easier for trial judges below to dispose
of whether they should proceed or not proceed.
what produced Gideon.

Not unlike

In fact, in Gideon vs* Wainwrlght, one

of the very reasons that prompted this Court to hold as they
did was that it would avoid the necessity of having to make
an independent inquiry over and over as to whether there was
an abuse of discretion.
I say a rule favorable, as rendered below, will
have precisely the same effect in achievement.
Q

Mr. Marky, what is your answer to your brother's

argument that he did allege harassment and bad faith, and he ’ s
at least entitled to a. hearing in the District Court on those

46
allegations?
HR, MARKYs

Your Honor, 18ve had many cases where it

was alleged that there was harassment, and none was shown.
And finally, after the hearing —•
Q

Well, we have no way of knowing that.

MS. MARKYs

2 understand, Your Honor.

My answer to

that is that the -- in the jurisdictions where they have ruled
in my favor, they have not had hearings either, because it’s
an absolute bar; it's not an exception.

Ergo, these people

have not been getting hearings r either»
And I say that under Atlantic Coast Line, once he's
in the State court and he has suffered an adverse ruling, this
Court has emergency relief to rule on that matter.
Q

In other words, you're arguing that 2283 is a

complete bar, even if he can show harassment, and bad faith,
so long as the pending State proceeding is a civil on®; is
that it?
MR. NARKY:
Q

Well, 1 know, but -«-

Q

Yes.

Or criminal, Your Honor.

In any event, that's what I:m saying.

But. Younger points the other way, doesn't it?

MR. MARKY:
Your Honor, again.

No, Younger is from a negative predicate,
In that case

Q

Well, X suggest that it points the other way.

Q

Well, whatever — however Younger points —

MR„ M&RKY;
Q

Cannot.

— this Court decided exactly what you say the

law ought to be.

This Court in this case decided this case

just the way you say it should have been done.

So if the

error is there —
MR. MARK?:
0

That, yes — yes, Your Honor.

it's on the part of the Court, and certainly

not in your argument; you're simply adopting the reasoning
of the District Court in this case.
MR. MARRY:
Q

That is correct.

Which, to be sure, did not have the benefit

if that's the word — of the, of our opinions in Younger and
related cases,
MR. MARKYs

Right.

Yes.

All I'm — in addition to the avoidance of the
question that X need not even go into, my argument is consistent
with ACL, their argument applies to the things of it.
So when, we look at the totality of the reasons and
justifications that X have pointed out to the Court, the
benefits to be inured, the simplicity of resolution, the
avoidance of conduct; and"we contrast that with what they
want, disorder, chaos, delay

X*m not impeaching your integrity

or morality; all I'm saying is that if I were a defense lawyer,

cis this Court has noted in Stef anelli, every defense lawyer
would feel obliged to come forward and raise this on behalf of
his client.

✓

That is the only benefit that will come from such a
ruling, and I respectfully urge this Court to affirm the
action taken by the three-judge court in the ease below.
Thank you. very much.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Maxkv.

Mr, Smith, you have three minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT EUGENE SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. SMITH;

Just a few brief things:

Judge

Fitzpatrick on the 6th day of April 1970, when he entered his
preliminary order, held that the activities of the defendant
in Panama City were prima facie, injurious, and damaging to
the morals and manners of the people of the State of Florida?
were prima facie subversive to public order and decency; and
prime, facie constitute a public nuisance®

And that the p3.amii£K

had'demonstrated irreparable harm and damage to the plaintiff
that case being the State — to the morals end welfare snu
safety of the people of the State of Florida.
There was no evidence before that court of any kind
in that regard.
And the court ordered;

they are further hereby

enjoined from operating and maintaining an£ business on the

premises, and are further enjoined from removing say thing
from the premises.
And thereafter an immediate request was made for
superseding thiss

Stay the effect of your order? Your Honor?

so we can appeal*
No, he would not 'do so.

Immediate request for

supersedeas was made to the Court of Appeals, and they denied
the same, and, by order, denied the same and said that they
could not say that the judge below was in error; and denied
us the relief, and we had to await our appellate relief there.
It was thereafter that the federal suit was filed.
And, although Judge Fitzpatrick said the defendants
can have an expeditious hearing, time and time again defense
counsel filed a request for an expeditious hearing and it was
denied.

It was for this reason that the federal court inter­

vention was sought, because we felt that the whole circumstances
were — an irreparable harm was present, we wanted to prove
cur bad faith; we felt the use of the nuisance law, and the
way it was used in this case, was erroneous and we felt we*d
like to have the right, and would like to have the right to go
back to the District Court and so demonstrate that to the
court.
Q

Well, Mr. Smith? if we should decide this case in

your favor, on the inapplicability

in this case for some reason

or another, if Section 2283? or, more precisely, if we should

so
decide either that 2283 were as inevitable or that one of the
exceptions therein provided were applicable,, in 2283, then,
what you’re telling us now is just the matter that you would
then be permitted to present to the District Court.

Because

that's never been litigated at trial or even considered by the
District Court, other than in the three-judge District Court
action,
MR.SMITH:

Yes, that's why I said we would want ■;•••

go back —
Q

But you’re not — it’s not the point of your

argument, there's no sense in —
MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir, Your Honor.

Only except to say that it was in your

complaint and you had —
MR. SMITE:
Q

It’s not moot —

— and you brought it to the attention of the

District Court.
MR. SMITH:
Q
you:

Yes, sir.

Well, one other question, while I’ve interrupted

I just read Hobbs v. Thompson, insofar as one can read

while he*s trying to listen,

1 don’t find that that case

involves any application of 2283, did it?
There wasn't a pending State proceeding, was there?
MR. SMITH:

All I said, sir, was that it was a good

discussion of what this Court had said in Younger, and a good
MWtn )1W<W»W U—

51
discussion on this issue.
Q

X wasn't saying that it was —

Well» whatever you were saying» did it involve

a pending Stata proceeding?
MR. SMITH:
Q

I diem31 think so.

MR, SMITH:
Q

No» sir.

Right.

MR. SMITH:

Yes» sir.

It's just a good discussion.

Thank you very much.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you» Mr. Smith.
Thank you» Mr. Marky.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon» at 2:11 p.m., the case was submitted.]
