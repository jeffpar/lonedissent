MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We'll hear arguments

next in 71-1016, Federal Power Commission against Louisiana
Electric Power, and 71-1040, United Gas Pipe Line against
Louisiana Light & Power, consolidated cases.
Hr. Gooch, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GORDON GOOCH, ESC). ,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION
MR. GOOCH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents two basic issues.

First is the

issue of whether the Federal Power Commission has jurisdiction
to protect the interstate consumers of natural gas
transported in interstate commerce regardless of whether
the ultimate customer of that gas is a customer of the
distribution company or a direct: purchaser from the pipeline.
The second issue is whether or not-Q

State that, first one again.

MR. GOOCII:

Yes, sir.

It's whether the Federal

Power Commission has jurisdiction under Section l{b) of the
Natural Gas Act and Sections 4, 5, and 16, to

regulate the

curtailments of service of gas transported in interstate
commerce by interstate pipelines regardless of whether the
customer is a customer of a distribution company or a direct
purchaser from the pipeline.

The second issue is whether the Fifth Circuit
properly found that the Federal Power Commission did not have
jurisdiction over certain facilities when the Federal Power
Commission subsequently has found that they did have
jurisdiction over those facilities due to the injection of
substantial quantities of interstate gas.
The case arose when Louisiana Power & Light filed
suit in the District Court in Louisiana, seeking to enjoin
United Gas Pipe Line from implementing any curtailment
program which would result in the reduction of gas delivered
to two of their generating plants.

At the time the suit was

instituted two separate proceedings were pending before the
Federal Power Commission.

The first proceeding, a curtailment

proceeding, was to determine the Federal Power Commission's
jurisdiction to allocate the supplies of interstate natural
gas pipelines when their gas supplies were so depleted that
they were unable to meet the contracts of all of their
consumers in. all states served by the pipeline, directly or
indirectly.
\

.

And a second proceedin was pending to determine the
jurisdictional status of certain facilities that are part of
the United Gas Pipe Line system that part of the time in the
past had been operated in intrastate commerce with a separate
system of supply, but subsequently quantities of interstate
gas had been injected into the former intrastate

system.

5
And the question presented was whether Or not those facilities
therefore were subject to federal and not state jurisdiction.
Louisiana Power

&,

Light Company obtained a

temporary restraining order, ordering United to make their
full deliveries without curtailment on LP&L's claim that
domestic customers did not need the gas that was ordered
curtailed.

In time sequence now, and I'll skip some

procedural matters, in time sequence the Federal Power
Commission then held in the curtailment proceeding that under
Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act, Sections 4 and 5, and
decisions of this Court in the transport case in Panhandle
in 332 U. S., that the Federal Power Commission had plainly
jurisdiction under its transportation authority over gas
dedicated to interstate commerce being transferred in
interstate commerce and had the power to curtail any and all
customers of a pipeline in order to be sure that a fair
allocation of gas supplies would be available to all
interstate consumers.
Next in time sequence the Fifth Circuit held that
the Federal Power Commission had no jurisdiction to order
curtailments of deliveries of gas dedicated to interstate
t

commerce, transported in interstate commerce, but delivered
to direct industrial consumers as distinguished from deliveries
i

to distribution companies for ultimate resale to public
citizens and industries.

6

S ubssquently-Q

It held that the Commission had the power

neither under under 1(b),

4 and 5, nor under Section 7, I

take it.
MR. GOOCH:

Sir, it would appear to me that the

Fifth Circuit held that under Section 7(b) the Commission
could have an abandonment proceeding and order the direct
industrials completely off an interstate pipeline.

The Fifth

Circuit said that between the initial certification under
Section 7—■
Q

Yes, but they held that they could not have a

curtailment proceeding.
MR. GOOCH:
Q

Under Section 7.

MR. GOOCH:
that.

That’s correct, sir.

No, sir, they didn’t really approach

They only said to the extent the Federal Power
i

Commission has any jurisdiction it’s under Section 7, and
that would be limited to the initial certification of the
abandonment but othing in between.
Q:

Yes.

MR. GOOCH:

And the curtailment proceedings are

handled under Sections 4, 5, and 16, not under Section 7.
Q

I know, but wasn't one of the claims for the

Fifth Circuit that there could be a curtailment short of
abandonment under Section 7?

7
MR. GOOCH:
Q

Yes, sir.

And they rejected that?

MR. GOOCH:

I can't say that, sir.

1 think that

they would permit an abandonment proceeding if it had the
result of reducing permanently the services to a direct
industrial customer.

I don’t think there is any question

in the Fifth Circuit that curtailments could be handled—
that is to say, abandonments of service could be handled under
Section 7.

That wasn’t an issue.

The issue was whether or

not it could be handled under Sections 4, 5 and 16.
Rut this Circuit went on to hold that the Federal
Power Commission could not exercise jurisdiction over the
former intrastate facilities because in the Fifth Circuit's
view the quantities of gas injected into that system were
da minimis, and there was a possibility that another Affiliate
of the pipeline could have put the same quantities of gas
into the system, they were interstate gas.
In the Federal Power Commission's opinion
subsequently issued, the Commission found that the gas being
f

injected into the system was substantial--in fact, made 67
percent of the peak day deliveries for the New Orleans system
and found that the affiliate of the United Gas Pipe Line did
not have sufficient quantities on a deliverability basis to
make up the difference, and that the interstate gas was needed
in order to maintain the peak day viability of the formerly

8

intrastate system.
Both Commission decisions, both deciding its
authority under curtailment and also deciding its authority
over the green system, as it!s called, are now pending before
the Fifth Circuit Court decision.
The Commission, through the Solicitor General,
requested certiorari because if the Fifth Circuit's decision
is correct and the Federal Power Commission has no jurisdiction
over gas transported in interstate commerce, except as an
initial certifying matter or except at the conclusion of art
abandonment proceeding after the individual customer is being
compelled to abandon, then the Federal Power Commission is
powerless to prevent the interstate consumers of natural gas,
x

the domestic consumers, the homes, the schools, the
i

hospitals, from being certain that they have a chance for
their fair share of the scarce gas supply -when the pipelines
are unable to meet all of their contracts.
LP&L has put a question that the Louisiana
Commission is better able to determine the public interest
of Louisiana citizens for the use of gas supply than the
Federal Power Commission, and they argue that the elected
officials of the State of Louisiana would be more likely to
protect the interests of Louisiana citizens than would the
Federal Power Commission.

We don’t argue that point.

Our

point is that it's our responsibility, as we read the Natural

9

Gas Act and the decisions of this Court

under it, it is our

responsibility to protect the gas supply of all consumers in
all states served by the interstate pipeline and in this case
gas from United gets as far away as Boston, because they
resell Texas Gas, Texas Eastern, Transeo, Southern Natural,
and that gas then is transported not only in interstate
commerce by United but by other pipelines throughout the
eastern, portion of the United States,

And if the Federal

Power Commission has no authority to curtail or divert the
volumes that are dedicated to industrial consumers in the
state of-production or in any other state, then the Commission
has no authority either to prohibit undue preferences or
discriminations under Section 4, which is a clear grant of
authority to the Commission, nor any action under Section 5
or .16 of the Gas Act..
Section l(fo) of the Natural Gas Act from which our
authority derives states clearly we have three alternate
bases of independent responsibility and jurisdiction.

The

first is jurisdiction over transportation of gas in interstat^
commerce.

The second is over sales for resale of gas in

interstate commerce.

And the third is over the natural gas

companies themselves.

And this Court in the East Ohio case

in 338 U. S., and the Panhandle case in 332 U. 5„, has clearly
set out those as independent grounds of the Federal Power
Commission's jurisdiction.

And in two cases, the Panhandle

10

332 and in Transeo 365, this Court has specifically
recognized that when curtailments are necessary, that
curtailments and interruption of service are a matter that
relates to transportation and therefore within the jurisdiction
of the Federal Power Commission to control in allocating the
competing demands among the several states.
Q

Transeo was an initial certification

proceeding.
MR. GOOCH:

Yes, sir.

In the Transeo case in

recognition the Court recognized the types of authority that
the Federal Power Commission had.

Both the Panhandle case

and the Transeo were not curtailment cases—that is to say,
where the issue was presented.

But in both of those eases

the Court recognized that in a matter of allocating gas
supply among the several states that it was the type of
authority that was granted to this Commission.
0

Would United have to get consent of the Federal

Power Commission to curtail transportation to LPL?
MR. GOOCH:
Q

Yes, sir.

Under what section?

MR. GOOCH:

They would have to--you mean—assuming

the contract-Q

Let's assume there was no contract.

MR. GOOCH:
Q

No contract at all.

Just been selling gas to LPL over a long period

11
of time and they suddenly decided they want to sell it ali­
to transport it all farther east»
MR. GOOCH;
Q

They would have to gat consent?

MR. GOOCH;
Q

No, sir, they could not do that.

Yes, sir.

Under what section?

MR. GOOCH;

The Federal Power Commission has

ordered all pipelines that are unable to meet all their
contracts-—sill their contracts, direct or indirect—to file
u:adar Section 4»
Q

I know they *ve ordered, but that's sort of

assuming the answer to this case, isn't it?
MR. GOOCH:

Well, sir, it seems to me that the

Federal Power Commission has three choices.

The Federal

Power Commission may proceed under Section 4 and 5 as one
choice.

The Federal Power Commission may proceed under

Section 7 and order abandonment, if it so chooses.
Q

Or forbid it.

MR. GOOCH:

Or forbid it.

Yes, sir, that's correct.

And the third is under Section 16 or otherwise, as
we had a rulemaking on 4 or 5, which considered the
possibility of adopting regulations nationwide that would
handle this problem so that we wouldn't run the risk of
householders having—
Q

Would United hage te= get consent from the

12
Federal Power Commission if it cut down its deliveries to its
domestic*—to the utilities for resale?
MRo GOOCH;
Q

Yes, sir.

So, one way or another, if they can't satisfy

both direct users and the utility customers, they are going
to have to—
MR. GOOCH;
Q

Somebody is going to be curtailed.

Somebody is going to have to go to the

Commission.
MR. GOOCH;
Q

Yes, sir.

One way or the other.

MR. GOOCH:

Yes, sir.

But the Fifth Circuit has

held that the direct customers do not come to the Commission.
They are free to sue for their full contract quantities in
court and then it’s up to the court to determine who had to
allocate the gas and decide who gets the gas.
Q

There are some contract provisions in the

contract sale under which United could curtail without coming
to the Commission.
MR. GOOCH:

Well, sir, the problem with that is

there are some three hundred and soma odd contracts on
United's system.
same.

All the contract, provisions are not the

And the extent to which you rely on contract rather

than regulation to decide who gets interrupted you then have
two problems.

One, a court, assuming a state court is

13
handling it, it has the jurisdiction to affect, gas in other
states» that is to say, divert it from an interstate stream
to serve a local need; he has got to determine if it has a
domestic preference in it.

lie has got to determine what

all the domestic needs on the entire interstate
before he can do it.

system is

That's what the Commission does.

The

court would have to do it too.
Secondly, in this very case on LPL's sworn
allegation the District Court entered a temporary restraining
order saying that the domestic customers did not need the
gets and therefore LP£L could not be interrupted.

So, we run

the risk of multiple litigation on contract by contract
basis with no one, unless every distribution company and
every customer participates.
Q

So, a court could decide that United had to

satisfy its deliveries to LPSL, and the Commission could
refuse to give United the permission to cut down its gas
deliveries to the utility resellers.
MR. GOOCH:

That's a possibility, sir.

Basically,

what the Commission is doing—
Q

In exactly the same circumstances.

MS. GOOCH:

I think so.

I'm not sure I understood

your question.
Q

I mean, the Commission and the permission,

the courts could decide differently on this.

MR. GOOCH:

Oh, yes, sir; no question about that.

And the other proposition is the Federal Power Commission is
claiming the right to override the contracts, no matter what
they say, so that a rational system of interstate priorities
can be set up so that the interstate customers will not

have

their gas diverted on the basis of a state regulatory
commission or state or other court and instead there will be
an interstate regulation of an interstate gas stream.
Q

May I ask, Mr. Gooch, this gets back to a

question Mr. Justice VThite asked you earlier.

You said that

you did not think that the Section 7 issue, jurisdictional
issue, had been decided by the Fifth Circuit?
MR. GOOCH:

Uo, sir, I don't mean to say that.

I

don’t think there is any question in the Fifth Circuit’s
decision that the Commission could proceed by way of
abandonment and knock a direct industrial or any other
customer off an interstate pipeline,,
Q
the

What does this mean 17(a):

The issue is, Does

FPC have the authority to modify or condition the

certificate issued for facilities used to make a direct sale?
Or, more briefly stated, Does the Commission have continuing
jurisdiction?

The FPC asserts that it does and it needs to

have this jurisdiction to make active what it conceives to be
the full extent of its regulatory powers.
assertion.

We deny this

15
MR. GOOCH:

We didn't claim that, sir.

We weren't,

claiming that we had a modification of the certificate.

What

we were saying was that under Section 4 and 5 of the Natural
Gas Act that says that the Commission has certain powers,
among which is to prevent discrimination against any person,
that we have the power to override the contracts that were
behind those certificates.
Q

Are you saying then t’gat to do what you're

doing in this case you could not operate under Section 7?
HR. GOOCH:

No, sir, we could not, because until

the end of a lengthy proceeding, until the end of a
lengthy proceeding, I don’t know who would determine where
the interstate gas supply would go.

That would depend on who

got to the courthouse first or who was closer to the
interstate source in the producing states—
Q

Couldn't that be gotten on an individual

pipeline company basis?
MR. GOOCII:
Q

And individual contract basis rather.

MR. GOOCII:
Q

Yes, sir.

Not an individual contract basis.

But each individual pipeline.

MR. GOOCH:

Yes, sir, it does.

Because the Federal

Power Commission has no jurisdiction whatsoever to order
interstate pipelines to exchange gas among themselves.
can we order gas from the intrastate market into the

Nor

16

interstate market, nor can we order a producer to sell gas
to the interstate market.
May 1 have the remaining time for Mr. Harvin,
please?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Gooch.

Mr. Harvin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. HARVIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED GAS PIPE LINE COMPANY
MR. HARVIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and .may it please

the Court:
While the question before the Court is a limited
one of the curtailment jurisdiction of the Federal Power
Commission, the Commission has graciously conceded five
minutes of its presentation to United, its co-petitioner
here, to speak to a few of the practical aspects of this
problem that we hope the Court will keep in its mind as it
decides the question of FPC curtailment jurisdiction or not.
United is an interstate gas transmission system
covering the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama
and Florida, and supplying some five other jurisdictional
pipelines which in turn supply much of the gas that's
eventually consumed in the Midwest and in the East.
In addition to people such as Louisiana Power &
Light and in addition to those other jurisdictional pipeline
customers, we serve over 200 other direct industrial

17
customers, including some 14 different power plants, such as
Louisiana Power & Light.

We serve over 100 distribution

companies that in turn supply gas to some 800 different
communities.

And of extreme significance is the fact that

some 37 percent of our volume is taken up in these direct
industrial sales.

And this makes the decision of the Court

of Appeals, excluding direct industrial sales from the
curtailment, jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission,
extremely important, not only to United but to United's
other customers as well.

For it’s undisputed that the total

gas requirements of all of United’s customers just cannot
be met irrespective of what this Court decides about whether
the FFC has curtailed that jurisdiction or not.
The electrical utilities and the other direct
industrial customers all assert different theories about
why they should have priority to get their full requirements,
and they do so without regard to the impact or effect that
these postions

they're taking may have on the distribution

companies and the domestic consumers along the length and the
breadth of our system.
If these conflicting interests are to be resolved
in times of a system--wide shortage without effective
regulation, the priorities will have to be based on such
factors as who has the physical capacity by virtue of his
geographical location, close to the source of the supply of

18
United's gas or who is able to get to the courthouse first
and enjoin United's reduction of deliveries.

Gas beyond

curtailed levels that's obtained by such means is simply going
to be taken away from others of United's customers.

So, we

get right down to the question of who is going to determine
the priorities to an interstate pipeline's limited supplies
of gas among a variety of customers in many, many states.
Reducing deliveries to industrial customers as may
be necessary to meet human needs requirements is basically
a matter of interrupting service, not abandoning contracts.
And it calls for interruption of services all along the
interstate pipeline system.

And this Court had announced on

two occasions that interrupting service was a matter largely
related to the transportation jurisdiction of the Federal
Power Commission, thus within its jurisdiction.

That was the

procedure United followed to implement and seek FPC approval
of a curtailment program, a curtailment which had its impact
on industrial sales.

It has thus far had no impact and

foreseeably and hopefully it will have no impact on 'domestic
consumers.

The same is true with respect to the gas that’s

supplied to the poster plants.

Their deliveries are

reduced

to the extent that they use gas for the generation of
electricity for industrial consumption but their human needs
requirements are supplied without any reduction whatsoever.
Under FPC jurisdiction we believe that this program

19
of orderly reduction of deliveries can be handled in the
public interest»

It can be handled

uniformly whether

exceptional circumstances that apply to one customer; they
can be viewed in light of the interests of all of the
customers»
State regulatory agencies for the practical and
legal purposes are not equipped to

handle such problems of

an interstate pipeline system and to allow it to be conducted
toy random litigation and conflicting court decisions based
upon different facts relating to different special interests
in different states, is to put us in a complete state of
chaos in the gas industry»

This is not to suggest that need

creates federal power and the curtailment jurisdiction in the
Federal Power Commission.

It is to suggest that since

Congress specifically wanted to avoid any regulatory gap and
since the job cannot be done at the local and the state
level, that the logical place for it to he done is within the
parameters of the Natural Gas Act by the Federal Power
Commission.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Harvin.

Mr. Carter.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW P, CARTER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE LOUISIANA POWER -S LIGHT COMPANY
MR. CARTER:
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

20

LPSL's affirmative position in this case is that
its contracts with the United are direct sales contracts,
direct industrial sales contracts, exempt under Section 1(b)
of the Act,

The Fifth Circuit has so held.

That's the

decision we're here on for review.
The FPC in order to skirt that holding is arguing
that it has a plenary jurisdiction under what it terras its
transportation authority.

And it points to the first part

of Section 1(b) to say that that is where its transportation
authority resides.
Our brief we believe adequately talks about the
direct sales aspects and we believe the Fifth Circuit opinion
adequately speaks to that subject, and we are going to spend
our time today in rebutting the position that the FPC takes
about this plenary transportation authority,
I think that while there is a lot of chaff in this
case we can get to the essence very quickly by my saying that
in order to determine the jurisdiction here, all we have to
look at is three key factors, and I’m not going to say as
Mr. Plotkin said earlier that this is a simple issue.

But 1

believe if we look at the three factors, it will simplify the
case for the Court.

Those three factors are, first of all,

the congressional history.

And in this case I don’t believe

I can emphasize too strongly the effect of that congressional
history on this whole matter.

21
The second thing is the decisions of this Court,
and I'm speaking now of the Panhandle Indiana case, 337,
and of the Transeo case in

365 U. 8„

And the third is the actions of the PPC itself.
Addressing myself to the congressional history
first; and I'll dwell on it a little bit because, as I said,
it is so important to this whole matter.

We did a rather

comprehensive study of that legislative history, and it
became more interesting all along because we found that the
history is taking place during 1936-37-38, which I believe
we all will agree ware the high water marks of the Roosevelt
Administration in terms of the passage of regulatory
legislation and an example of that, I would say, is the.
National Labor Relations Act, which as I think the Court
knows so well has an exclusive or peremptory nature to it, ,
and I think all of that legislation at that time was of the
same type, with the clear exception of this Natural Gas Act.
And that's the interesting thing about this congressional
history, is that Congress—and apparently it was getting a
lot of heat, Is 1.1 say, from the National Association of
Railroad and Utility Commissioners, the representatives of
the state authorities, and speaking for the states they made
a strong case for the proposition of dual regulation here.
And as a result , yo\i had running like a thread through the
congressional history the proposition that we were to have

22

dual regulation and that we were going to leave to tha
states those things that the states had already been
regulating and that Congress felt they could reach and the
courts felt they could reach,
Section 1(b) reflects that history because
Section 1(b) really is a two-part sort of statute *

In the

first part of the statute, it tells what matters will, fall
into the ambit of FPC jurisdiction, and then it has block
clause in it, a conservatory proviso, which refers to the
states those things that are to be for state regulation, and
it is in that conservatory proviso that we find the saving
grace to our position here because it was there that Congress
reflected in the statute that Congressional history that I
just described.
The second aspect that I find in the congressional
history that’s so pertinent here is that Congress indicated
plainly and unqualifiedly that it knew of the court decision
and the reach of the states under those court decisions, and
specifically mentioned the Pennsylvania Gas Company case
during the congressional debates.

I think that without

dxv'elling on any long quotes from the congressional history,
I do have a sample that's only one short couple of sentences
that sums the whole matter up here.

In House Report 709 of

the 75th Congress, which is tha—I would say it's the
foundation report in all of this congressional history, and

23
the Court will find that this Court has many times discussed
that House report and cited it in its decisions.

And in that

House Report 70S it is said,- "The states have of course for
many years regulated sales of natural gas to consumers in
intrastate transactions.

The states have also been able to

regulate sales to consumers even though.such sales are in
interstate commercef such sales being considered local in
character and in the absence of congressional prohibition
subject to state regulationand they cite the Pennsylvania
Gas Company case.

And then they say, "There is no intention

in enacting the present legislation to disturb the states
in the exercise of such jurisdiction."
Hoitf, Your Honors, it seems to me plain from that
congressional history that the FPC's claim to a plenary
transportation jurisdiction just is completely contradicted
by that history, because the Congress knew that these direct
industrial sales were being made through interstate
facilities, which is what the FFC says gives them this
plenary authority.

And yet they exempted in Section 1(b)

all of their sales, even though they wesre through interstate
facilities.

So, I think the first key furnishes us a rather

adequate peg for the FPC coffin.
Q

Mr. Carter--

MR.' CARTER:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

—turning to 1(b), isn't there a very specific

24
exclusion there that you’re relying on?
MR. CARTER:

Yes, Mr. Justice Relinquist, we’re

relying on the exclusion that comes about from the
conservatory proviso that commences with "but shall not
apply to any other transportation or sale of natural gas."'
We say that that language, when compared with the
language of the remainder of that section, means to reflect
the congressional history that 1 just talked about of
exempting all direct industrial sales, even those made
interstate ffacilities.
been held to mean.

•fchrouch

And that’s what that language has

This isn’t my interpretation.

Let's go.to the second factor I said was a key here.
Let’s talk about for a moment the decisions of this Court,
and I’m speaking now again of Panhandle Indiana and Transeo.
The Par>handle Indiana case involved an effort by a pipe line
to make a direct sale in Indiana.

The Indiana Commission

sought to regulate both the rate of that sale and the service
term.

And, by the way, you'll find in- the briefs, although it

didn't come out in this oral argument, that they arei the—
I part company and I think the Fifth Circuit does too with
the FPC when they tried to talk about separating out rate by

I think it’s perfectly understandable
!

from the whole, you might say, congeries of jurisprudence
on this whole subject that a sale includes not only rate but
i

other terms, and their knowledgeable former chairman,

25
Mr. Swidler , certainly admitted that during his efforts in
Congress.

But back to the Panhandle case.

In that case the

state commission was trying to regulate both the rate and
the service terms, which is what's afoot in this case, because
we're arguing here about curtailment.
The pipeline went into court and sought an
injunction on the ground that the PPC had jurisdiction, and
this Court held that the PPC had no jurisdiction over a direct
industrial sale of the type LP&L has here.

And it said that

the state could regulate the rate and the terms—-the rate
and the terms.

• V.

Now, may it please the Court, it is from that
decision way at the end of the decision, about the last
paragraph or two, that we find a random sentence from
Mr. Justice Rutledge that lo and behald has furnished what I
call in ray brief the straw dictum that the PPC is hanging on
desperately here.

That's a sentence where Mr. Justice

Rutledge talked about interruptions of service and suggested
that the PPC might be able to handle those in accommodation
with the states.
To take that random sentence at the end of that
decision after the majority-*--after the holding had been made
that there was this exemption of a direct industrial sale in
both its rates and its terms—means certainly that it had to
be dictum because otherwise it would contradict the main

26
holding.

But it also rather much peaked our curiosity and

we went to the brief of Panhandle that Mr. Justice Rutledge
was speaking to when he got to that point.

It looked to me

like he was just trying to tidy up his opinion and answer all
of Panhandle's little complaints, and he sure enough was
doing that because Panhandle's brief was arguing that there
might be a conflict between state and state and state and
federal power commissions if this Court were tc hold that
the state had jurisdiction of the rates and terms.
So, upon looking at Panhandle's brief, lo and behold
we find that what they were talking about and therefore what
we have to assume Mr. Justice Rutledge was talking about was
a proposition of the initial certification of a direct
industrial sale.

And unquestionably there is no quarrel in

this case about their initial certificate authority as a
transportation matter.

And that’s what Mr. Justice Rutledge

was talking about, and it furnishes the FPC no comfort here
v?hatever.
Now, over to the Transeo case which I think is really
the dispositive situation here.
a transportation case.

That case, Your Honors, was

In that case an electric utility in

New York State bought some case down in Texas and wanted the
pipeline company to haul it for them, transport it for them,
to New York.

And the matter came before the FPC on a

transportation certificate, the very thing that is in dispute

27
here

and the thing that they say they have a continuing

jurisdiction over.

What did the PPG do there?

If they are

ever going to be right, it would be in this case, and what
happened?

This

Court held just as squarely as can foe—

Chief Justice Warren said there is only a veto power in the
transportation authority of the FPC, only a veto power.

And,

of course, I think veto power implies initial power anyhow.
But those are Chief Justice Warren's exact words, and then
in less than one page later he said that the FPC,as it itself
understands, does not have allocation power, complete
allocation power, to use his exact words..
So, Your Honors, it seems to us just as plain as
cars be from Panhandle and Transeo that you have the second
peg in the FPC coffin, because there is absolutely no
authority in the FPC over a direct industrial sale or the
transportation of gas for a direct industrial sale—
Q

<

I take it if the contract here between United

and LPL had expired and United said to LPL, "We're only going
to sell you half as much gas from now on," and ceased trans­
porting that much to LPL, that you say the United wouldn't
have to get permission from anybody?
MR. CARTER;

Ho.

I think, Your Honor, at that

point, at the termination of a contract, you have a situation
then developed that is akin to a new certicicate, because now
you axe

going to have a new contract.

So, I think if United

28
took that position—Q

What if United said we aren’t going to sell

you anything?
MR. CARTER:

If they said we aren’t going to sell

you anything, I think we would just have to look for another
supplier, Mr. Justice White.
Q

I know you would probably have to, but would

United have to get consent of the FPC before it terminated
this transportation?
MR. CARTER:

Actually I have my own debates within

myself as to that, to give you an honest answer.
Q

I mean, if LPL came up

to the Commission and

said please don’t give them consent, would the FPC have veto
power over that termination?
MR. CARTER:
White.

I would think probably not, Mr. Justice

1 would think they might be able to-—■
Q

You must say that, mustn’t you?

MR, CARTER:

No, I don’t think so.

I haven’t really

thought it through to find out whether it helps me or not
actually.

[Laughter J
In other words, you’re a little ahead of me.
I think the third key, and. I’ll have to try to

travel through this rather quickly, although it’s a halting
sort of thing, and that third key is the FPC actions themselves.
And to try to briefly cover it, I'll put it this way.

In the

29

City of Hastings case back in 1954 in footnote three of that
case, the Court commented

or

the Commission*s statement that

it had been to Congress to recommend that it extend our
jurisdiction over interstate sales by natural gas companies
to include direct sales to industries and sales to utilities
which are not for resale»
you today.

That's us.

That’s the case you have before

And the Commission obviously didn't

get that, sort: of authority.

Nothing has been done to the

act since 1954 and then up to 19S3 we come and we find that
in 1963, Mr. Swidler, who was then the Chairman of the FPC
and who has a reputation as a very knowledgeable man in this
field, had this to say to Congress.

He is talking noii? to

Congress, and he says, "Under existing law the Commission’s
authority is limited to sales for resale in interstate
commerce.

Hence, the price and other terms"—that's my

emphasis, and other terms—"of a direct sale by pipeline to
an industrual customer^-that’s us—"outside the sphere- of this
Commission's regulatory authority."

That's the Chairman

himself speaking, and he then went on to ask Congress to give
them the authority to require that interstate industrial gas
sales, that's us, will be made at such prices and on such
terras as to realize the potential benefits of such sales to
both domestic

and industrial consumers, and Congress turned

him down.
So, now we come up to 1970 and we’re getting rather

30

close up to date.

In 1970 this same commission that is

appearing before this Court and saying we’ve got this plenary
authority said to Congress that its recommendation was that
Congress enact "a new subsection to Section 7 of the Natural
Gas Act that would enable the Commission to determine when
an emergency exists so as to require"—and now I'm
emphasizing--"load curtailment and allocation"'—that is
what's being attempted here—"load curtailment and allocation
of gas by any gas company/ whether or not it is otherwise
subject to the Commission's jurisdiction."
Now, the FPC says in its reply brief that the effort
there was to reach distribution companies in intrastate
pipelines.

Your Honors, with all respect to the FPC, and I'm

not saying this meanly, but that's just solemn nonsense on
their part because they already have a

reach of distribution

companies by way of their authority over the pipelines.
Q

Mr. Carter—

HR. CARTER;
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Getting back to 1(b) and then some of this

authority in the first part of the section, do you conceive
the reservations in the latter part of the section to take
away the parts that were granted in the first section, or are
they simply a statement of the observe side simply pointing
out what wasn't granted?
MR. CARTER;

I think they are a very carefully

31

phrased reservation of the powers to the states so that you
could look at it this way, and I'm not saying that it's the
only way to look at it, but you could look at it as though
those first portions of that section or the statement of
jurisdiction by the PPC and that the latter conservatory
proviso is to indicate which portions of that upper part are
actually reserved to -the states.
Q

So, you say than were it not for the proviso,

the granting would give broader power if it stood by itself?
MR. CARTER:
question, Your Honor.

I'm not sure I understand that
If you mean if the two parts were

separated?
Q

Yes.

Assume that the granting provisions

stood by themselves and what you heard was the conservatory
provisions were absent, I taka it then you would feel that
there was more authority conferred in that situation than the
way the section is written now?
MR. CARTER:

Yes, I do think that.

Now, I think I had just about finished saying what
I had to say about the FPC actions themselves, of going to
Congress to ask for an authority that they are now saying to
this Court that they have.

And I think that the best evidence

of an agency's lack of jurisdiction is the agency's own
admission of that lack of jurisdiction.
the third peg in the FPC coffin here.

So, I consider that
And I turn at that

32
point to the issue involved in what is known as the green
system.

And if Your Honors would refer to the first appendix

in our brief, which is about midway—it's a foldout map, and
I assure the Court that we have no idea of emulating any
popular magazine, but this fold-out map shows, I think, the
location and the configuration of the green system very
clearly.

And Your Honors will note that the green system

lies in the very deep part of the south part of Louisiana,
which means you3re really getting down south.

And that

green system, Your Honors, is a system that was designed and
constructed to be an intrastate system, as you can see merely
by looking at it.

And it’s a self-contained separate system,

and in the court below by United's own witnesses we were able
to prove that this line is located

wholly in Louisiana, the

gas going into that line produced vjholly in Louisiana, it's
shipped wholly in Louisiana, and it’s consumed wholly in
Louisiana.
We also showed that there was 2.6 or .7 percent of
gas from what's known as the black system, which is an
interstate line nearby, was artificially injected into that
green system by United in 1370, and I say artificially for
this reason:

The proof also shows that they need not have

put that black gas into the green system, and indeed one of
y

their wholly owned subsidiary companies breached some of its
contracts in not putting enough green gas into the system.

33

So, you had a situation there where practically
everything about it is intrastate.
The Fifth Circuit looked at that whole situation
and they, on the teachings of the Lo-Vaca case out of this
Court decided, not as the FPC has said to the Court today
that this matter" was d® minimis, this 2.6 percent, that had
nothing to do with the holding.

Actually the Court will find

upon reading the Fifth Circuit decision that the decision on
the green system went off on what is known as the channel of
constant flow, which is a teaching coming out of the Lo-Vaca
case and also and quietly out of Aralrada.
Q

Didn’t our recent case in Florida's tend to

undermine your position on that?
MR. CARTER?

Not at all, Mr. Chief Justice, because

you have in the case of the green system a wholly different
channel.
system.

There is a different pressure from the black
Unlike in Florida Power where you had some inter­

connection—you see, electricity is traveling on the same
level, let's put it that way.

Here the pressure in the green

system is a wholly different pressure than the black system.
So, in order to put gas from the black system into the green
system, you have to manipulate valvas and push it into that
system, and you can't get it back cut of the green system
because the pressure is lower.

So, this just guides you

naturally into this theory of the channel of constant flow,

34
and that’s what the Fifth Circuit went off on, which was
Lo-Vaca all over again.
Finally on the green system, I think we just get down
to a case of commonser.se, Your Honor.

Here is a pipeline—

looking at that map you see where it is.

It's laying right

on. top of some of the largest natural gas fields in the
Western Hemisphere, and you have here people telling us that
they’ve got to inject some black gas, some interstate gas,
into this green system in order to make it viable?

That’s

like chopping ice in Greenland and shipping it to Alaska.
There is just no sense to that sort o£-~
Q

What was the Court’s power to do this ab initio

in a suit like this rather than on review of the Power
Commission?
MR. CARTER;
walked into this case.

Mr. Justice White, the FPC voluntarily
This case started out as a simple

injunction sxiit-—
Q

Let's ass\jme it hadn’t walked into it and the

United had pleaded primary jurisdiction.
MR. CARTER;

Even if it had not walked into it, I

would say to you that once it got into it and took court, then
the Panhandle case applied.
Q

Let’s assume it never was in it.

MR, CARTER;

If it never was in it, I don't think

you'd ever have the question of primary jurisdiction arise.

35
Q
raised it.

Well, I don't know.

United easily could have

It’s the 'way it's usually raised.

Let’s assume

United had raised it.
MR. CARTER?
Q

It might have made a difference.

Do you think there would have been an arguable

primary jurisdiction of the Commission?
MR. CARTER:

I don’t think it would have been, but

it might have.
Q

But, in any event, the Commission coming in

and litigating the issue cured it?
MR. CARTER:

I think it did in terms of what has

actually happened here, yes, Your Honor,
I imagine my time, since X see the white light,
has apparently just about expired.

I’ll j\isfc close,

Mr. Chief Justice, by saying to the Court that what we’re
saying in essence here, and all that we're saying is, that
we -think this Court should stick by the duality of regulation
that Congress prescribed, that was put into the act, and that
this Court went by in Transeo and Panhandle.
I thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Carter;

and,Mr. Gooch, you have six minutes of the fen that you
reserved.
REBUTTAL BY MR. GOOCH
MR. GOOCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

It seems

36
to me most clear from looking at the legislative history
of Section 1(b) of the Act, when you look at the committee
report itself, it says that the language—but shall not
apply to any other transportation or sale.

The legislative

history says that the coded words were not actually
necessary and were put in to replace language that had
previously been in the prior draft of the bill, which was
HR 4008,
Q

Mr. Gooch, would you concede that if your

opponents could bring these curtailment matters within the
definition of anything that they refer to as the conservatory
portions, that you would lose?
MR. GOOCH:

No, sir, because if we are going to lose

on that ground, we are going to lose because it1s not in the
transportation jurisdiction, because I don’t think that, based
on the legislative history and a reading of the statute, I
don’t think the "but for” language makes any difference.

In

other words, as the legislative history said, the but for
language is not necessary,
Q

If it’s within the transportation jurisdiction

it shouldn't come within any event.
MR. GOOCH;
Q

That's correct.

In other words, if it is within one event,

then it doesn't come within the transportation jurisdiction.
MR, GOOCH;

I agree, sir.

The legislative history of 4008 specifically had
a clause in it that said this shall not apply to rates charged
to direct industrial users or any other rate.

When you look

at the hearings, the whole issue was rate jurisdiction and
this Commission was not given rate jurisdiction over retail
rates regardless of who made the retail rates, whether it's
a distribution company or direct»

And we don't claim

jurisdiction over rates»
This Court in the Transco Extorni case, 365 tS. S. 1,
on approximately page 21 recognised that that proviso was to
take weight jurisdiction out, and these references to
Chairman Swidler's testimony was when he was trying to get
for the Federal Power Commission jurisdiction over the
rates at which direct industrial sales are made; because in
a rate case at the Federal Power Commission new, we first
allocate the cost to the direct industrial sales and throw
them out, and we don’t consider them no further and we there­
fore set rates only to the sales for resale.

We exercise no

rate jurisdiction over the direct industrial sales, and the
cases on Panhandle—this is the first I've heard that
Panhandle

dealt, to allocations of new service because

Mr. Justice Rutledge said, ’'Appellant also envisions

in

conflicting regulations by the Commission to the various
states in its main pipeline search, particularly in relation
to curtailment of service when weather conditions or others

38
require,"
I don’t believe Mr. Justice Rutledge can fairly be
talking about initial licensing when he’s talking about
curtailment in this matter.
The Commission did report in. its annual report in
1370 that it thought that it should have jurisdiction to
compel the inner connection, regardless of whether it had
jurisdiction over the pipeline's different types of
customers, because various distribution companies are
I

occasionally served by more than one pipeline; some
distribution companies now have their own imports.

Some

distribution companies have their own supplies of natura.1
gas and that would supplement and augment our curtailment
jurisdiction.
Mr. Justice V7hite, 7(b) does require that United
may not abandon a direct sale until it comes in and gets
permission from the Federal Power Commission..

The mere fact

that tiie contract has expired does not permit an interstate
pipeline from terminating any service; 7(b) prohibits the
termination of any service Until the Commission has authorised
it to do so.

It’s not a

question of terminating a sale;

it’s the service.
Q

Did United itself come into this, apply to the

FPC?
MR. GOOCHs

Yes.

39

Q

Under what section?

MR. GOOCH:
Q

It asked for a declaratory order.

Under what?

MR. GOOCH:

Under our regular rules and practice

and procedure for it, just to ask a declaratory order.
Q

What kind of power of the Commission did it

ask to be invoked?
MR. GOOCH:

You see, United already had a

curtailment plan as part of their tariff, and they did not
have to file a new curtailment plan at that time, and they
vasked the Commission if they 'were faithfully following the
curtailment plan that the Commission wanted them to follow.
And so that would be, in my view, under both Section 4 and 5.
And the Commission set it down for a hearing.
Q

You said what, Mr. Gooch, they already had

a curtailment plan?
MR. GOOCH:

Yes, they did.

tariff on file for curtailment.

They had a general

And they asked whether or

not that should be applied also to the direct industrial.
Q

How long was that on file?

MR. GOOCH:
recall.

Well, for several years, sir.

I don’t

Six or seven years or perhaps even longer.
And then whan the Commission found that seven

pipelines were having to go to curtailment, 14 pipelines had
to buy emergency supplies of gas? when the Commission could

40
anticipate that that was happening and the interstate pipeline
were unable to meat, the

Commission under Order 431 ordered

all pipelines to file new curtailment plans, and the
Commission

now has some 26 of these pending in order to make

a full allocation of the interstate supplies of gas among
the interstate pipelines/ not the intrastate pipelines»
With regard to the green system, the Federal Power
Commission intervened.

But all we could say to the court

when we intervened is, "Vie have a proceeding pending in which
we are taking evidence to determine what the jurisdictional
status of this case isand all of our evidence was this is
what's pending before the Federal Power Commission.

Until the

Federal Power Commission completed the hearing, got the
evidence, analyzed it, and took a position, we who intervened
on behalf of the Commission were unable to say whether the
system was jurisdictional or not.

And our findings of the

Commission after review of the whole record was that if the
interstate supply of gas was shut off

from that system on a

cold day, 67 percent of the gas used in the New Orleans area
would also be shut off.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you, gentlemen»

Thank you, Mr. Gooch.

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 2:10 o * clock p.m. the case was
submitted.3
