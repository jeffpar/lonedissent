ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER N. BOWMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BOWMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court;
This is a case arising in the State of Tennessee, on
a writ of certiorari to this court.
The fasts in this particular case are of grave
importance•

June of 1968, Dennis Stephen Duncan, and another

:ucandant were indicted by the Montgomery County Criminal Courv
.-.barged with armed robbery.

Said indictment charged robbery

in the normal commori law terms and added that said robbery was
accomplished with the use of a deadly weapon, to-wifc: a gun,
co-wit; a .22 caliber pistol.
The matter proceeded to trial, a jury was selected
and sworn, the defendant entered his plea of not guilty, the
State put its first witness on tne stand.

The first witness,

• :.v Albright «was asked the type of gun they were

'

looking for".

Hi? answer was a . 22 caliber rifle.

4

To this,

counsel for the Defendant objected on the basis that the
indie meat charged the robbery was accomplished with a .22
caliber pistol.

After much argument, out of the presence of

the jury, the judge ruled in favor of the Counsel for the
Defendant and the Attorney General said, "Well, in this case
then X think what ought to be done is the jury to be instructed
to return a verdict of not guilty” and this was done.

The

judge instructed the jury that because of the fact there was
a mistake in the indictment, that he was instructing the jury
to return a verdict of not guilty for the Defendants.
A short time later the Defendants were again indicted
Charging the s.arue facts as had fcaen charged in the original
indictment, except this time charging that the robbery was
accomplished ’with a deadly weapon, fco-wit: again, to-wit: a
,22 caliber rifle.

That was the original difference in the

".ro indictments t in the first indictment, a finding of double
jeopardy was found, alleging both a violation

of the State

of Tennessee Constitutional provisions and the United Statas
lonotitutional provisions.

This plea was overruled and the

matter went fee trial.
At the trial, when the prosecution was asked, "was
than any other robbery at this service station on this day,"
the answer was no.
As ai result of this second trial, the defendant was

5
-our*d guilty.

After this occurred, proper appeals were

perfected , the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, with one
judge dis seating, overruled the- Montgomery County Criminal
Court and ordered the 1 Trends,nit s release:
v ;•:■ • r vs sea T otitiono-5

Tennessee ttiipserae

The State of
Court.

As a result

of this,certiorari was granted by the Tennessee Supreme Court
and the Tennessee Criminal Court overruled the Tennessee Court
of Criminal Appeals.
The question involved is,- is the mere changing of
the type of weapon in this indictment, does this create a
different offense,
iot apply?

so that the double jeopardy provisions do

Now there are several tests that have been applied

ever the-years to determine whether or not the double jeopardy
provisions of the Constitution apply, and one of these,

are

they the same offenses?
Tennessee * a Armed Robbery Statute, Ho*

31-1901,, w . -v,

out, in the common law terminology, the robbery provisionis,
just as would ha in the common law, all those things; which art
necessary, and adds the punishment.

Then it goes on

to say

"But if said robbery is accomplished with the use of a deadly
'weapon, then the punishment, such-and-such.”
The Tornossee Suprema Court has held that this
particular statute, when the punishment was increased by the
legislation of 1955,

for armed robbery,' they did not create a

..a.acffeois-j, lot the only offense was robbery.
Now, back at the original trial of this case, whan

th-a attorney General asked that the judge direct the jury to
return a verdict of not guilty, Counsel for Defendant objected,
do felt that they could go ahead and proceed because robbery
vae still there, even if they could prove a weapon, even if
they could' prove the particular type of weapon that was

involved.
Q

K:c. Bowman, under Tennessee practice, aid the

State have any remedy by way of amendment on the indictment
available at this point, or was it stuck -with the indictment
as drawn?
MR. BOWMAN: There is a statute in Tennessee, Mr.
Justice, that provides that by agreement of counsel, an
indictment can be amended, so that if this had been done,
yes, the indictment could have been amended. My thoughts
or. the matter were, had the Attorney General said to counsel
for the defendant, and 1 was counsel for the defendant at
that stage, "Let’s amend the indictment,'or if you refuse
to amend the indictment, then I will ask the judge to grant a
mistrial,M we may have been in a different situation, but this
was not the case.
The Attorney General said to the Court, "We will
vith.'r go ahead and try him on this one, or I’ll have hits

re-indietedp3 and he chose to have the request of the judge
ho instruct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty, and then
did

idiot, so there vaa a procedure if it had been followed.

7
but it was not,
Q

You have told us that you objected to the idea

of having the jury return a verdict of acquittal on the first
ind ietaient?
MR» BOWMAN:
0

Yes, your Honor.

It. doesn’t appear in the record?

MR. BOWMAN:

Yes, it does, your Honor»

Appendix, but it is in the record.

It's not in

We did request that the

jury not be instructed to return a verdict of not guilty.

We

felt that this would ba a problem that would arise in the
future, if this .was done,
Q

It was your objection, however, to put this whole

business in motion, wasn’t it?
MR. BOWMAN:
0

Yes, your Honor.

And none of this is in the Appendix that I can

find.
MR. BOWMAN;
whet page that is on.

It appears in the order—-let me see
It appears on page 5 of the Judgment of

the Criminal Court of Montgomery County.
Q

Thank you.

MR. BOWMAN:

And X think in there it states—I

b ilieve it states that we objected, but it does appear in the
opinion of the Criminal Court of Appeals in Tennessee, I know,
and it in not recorded that wo did object to this being done.
Q

or. Bowman, I cake it from your answer to

8
Justice Rehnquist, that you were unwilling to agree to
an amendment of the indictment?
N:
you,

Your Honor, to be perfectly frank with

\t the time that this was tried originally,

I had been

practicing for some five months or six months and was not even
avare of the statute that allowed an amendment of the indictment
I think the record will show 1 stated to the Court I did not
know whether the indictment could be amended or not at that
dr.e, but since that time, and doing much research on this ease.
■ M- course I have found that there is a statute which would have
allowed the indictment to be amended»
Q

1 an not suggesting by any means that you should

have consented.

That was a matter of your choice as an

replicant, and perhaps even without knowing the statutes, you
nay have made the correct choice,
MS. BOWMAN?

Thank you.

The particular law involved in this case, there isn’t
c.y that is directly in point.

A completa search of the records

or I say as complete a search as can be done, as I have been
able to do, has not revealed a case that is directly in point
■■■‘frk the facts and situation in this case.

There are cases

/

ho.Id t: o'

it is ■ ■ t double jeopardy to indict a man the

tiins,whersr the item stolen, we'll say, was described
a*- perly, i jx; . r■■■■.■ in one case the serial number of an
:bi

Thera are cases which hold that if you indict for
a white horse, you can’t be ^onvli^ted
a hi.: ck horse.

'for stealing

To be indicted for stealing a black horse,

then, it is not double jeopardy.

But each of these cases

involve a particular thing stolen, the description of a
necessary element of the offense, and this case, the second
indictment charges that $70 was taken from the person of
Johnny Bryant, the proprietor of the Red Ace Service Station,
exactly the same things as are charged in the first indictment,
Q

Mr. Bowman, under Tennessee practice, is it

uocewsary to- Isa specific about the deadly weapon?
HR. BOWMAN2

Your Honor, from reading the cases in
*

Tennessee, it would have been sufficient for the indictment
to have merely said robbery accomplished with the use of a
deadly weapon. Period,

It want a little bit further and said

it was don© with a gun, but it was not necessary to specifically
describe the weapon used.

This was just a matter that was

added to make it more particular.
Q

In effect then the rulings of the Trial Court was

that since the state had chosen to be particular in the
indictment, it was stuck with -the particular language it used.
granting your notion to refust the offer of the gun?
MR. BOWMAN: . Yes, your Honor, that was their position
Of course it was our position at the time that a conviction for
robbery, which is the old defense under Tennessee law, could

:

'

have foe on obtained, even if they had not been able to

prove the type of weapon or prove that there was a deadly
weapon used, and of course it is our contention that the
acquittal of the original indictment accorded the Defendant
of the very crime of robbery, of the very crime of taking
$70 from the parson of Johnny Bryant, being proprietor of the
Red Ace Service Station.
i-

Q

Do you think the white horse and black horse case

in Tennessee was wrongly decided?
MR. EOWMANs
Q

No, your Honor, I can distinguish—

Certainly there is nothing- in the Tennessee

statute, in the statutes now I am talking about, that makes it
a.n offense to steal a white horse and quite a separate offense
to steal a black horse?
MR. BOWMANS
Q

No, Mr. Justice.

It’s larcency;if it's over a certain amount, it’s

grand larcency, and if it's under a certain amount, it’s petty
larcency ?
MR. BOWMAN:

Yes, but now if I wore charged with

going out and stealing your automobile, and it turned out it
was Mr. Chief Justice’s automobile that X had stolen, the first
irtd riment, charges would ba dismissed on that.

I could be

indi-:.tad on the second one because of the fact I did steal
f .at

automobile but there are two separate offenses
■ tool t:

■ :r in this particular situation, especially under

the T^.nr-eessa Robbery Statute, there is only one offense in
Tennessee, and that is robbery,
G

There is only

one offense I suppose covering

larceney, grand or petty?

MaI„: BOWMAN:

Right,

Ant; how about the other cases , the brass and
bronze rollers?
T'4E„ BOWMAN:

In the .brass and bronze roller case,

a mistrial was granted, and they were reindicted after reds trial
Thera was not a directed verdict of acquittal in that particular
case, and X am not satisfied, particularly, that that case is
right.
Q

In this case, it seems strange to people familiar

with the present federal practice and procedures in criminal

cases, this Tennessee practice seems pretty archaic, but as I
understand the Tennessee-law, it Is simply this, that if, as
or when the state chooses to be very specific in its indictment,
",o describe the horse as a black horse, then that is a separata
offends.

That * s the only way these cases can be understood,

at least by-me,from a charge that somebody stole a white horse.

m. BOWMAN;
Q
teen -rr-

Yes, your Honor.

And- under Tennessee practice and procedures, these

a yvr::

offenses because the prosecutor or grand jury

ms chosen to make them so.
:m, BOWMANr

Yes, your Honor.

0

Regardless of what the statute may say?

MR,

?e3; Mr, Justice, but what 1 am saving

though is the fact that you describe a horse a different way,
you .••re describing a particular element differently, and that
element of the offense is describing the thing stolen, the
oo'.o ucy ccssvaitted, in the armed robbery statute, yon are net
describing a necessary element of the offense difficulty at.
any time because in the Tennessee statute, whether a deadly
weapon is used or not, only goes to. the punishment, not to
a description of the offense whatsoever.
Q

Well, I don't want to push the matter, but surely

it's not a different punishment in Tennessee for stealing a
black horse than there is for stealing a white horse, is there!
fit BOWMAN:

Wo, your Honor, there is not, it would

be the same thing, but you would have committed an entirely
different offence by stealing the black horse than you would
by stealing the white horse.
q

Thai, is what Tennessee law says?

It seems very

odd but that is what it says, is it not?
MR. BOWMAN:

That's right.

Of course my interpretation

•.f the federal law is yen would have the same problem,

i think

it was the general case where a man was indicted in the Federal
Oy.uru and charged with stealing an automobile and the*' serial
i

n svb.-r was listed and it turned out that cha serial number was
'c

The Federal Court then held ha could be reindicted,

13

v.5~ tried, and the double jeopardy provision would not apply.
Q

Mr» ’d,axm:m, would you back up a minute.

You -did'

refuse to permit the indictment to be amended?
MR. BOWMANi

Yes, your Honor.

I think I stated that

I didn’t think the indictment could be amended,

at the time

I was .not aware of the particular statute involved.
Q

There is no way for Counsel to agree to amendment

and indictment, you said.
MR. BOWMAN:
0

That's correct, your Honor.

Mr. Bowman, in Tennessee is it lawful to carry

a .23 rifle around?
MR. BOWMAN?

Is there any inhibition on it?
There is a statute dealing with deadly

weapons, and a .22 caliber pistol would definitely be illegal
to carry

around.
Q

That is what I am trying to get at.

Is there a

difference in the legality of walking down the street with a
>22 rifle as against a pistol in your pocket?
MR. BOWMAN:

There is some case law in Tennessee which

holds that it is not illegal to carry a rifle per se- but it
would fcs to carry a pistol.
Q

You don’t get a license'to carry the pistol,

special permit or something?
Ml. BOWMAN:
Q

We have no special permits in Tennessee.

'-and guns are illegal in Tennessee?

MR. BOWMAN:

If ycu carry them with the intent to go

14
SiTsiK; :d

and •fch-;:., pres

>tion is, ar far as a hand gun,- 1

vou

hsve get it in your possession and loaded, that you are
carrying it with an intent to go armed.

A rifle, the

presumption doesn't arise, neither does it arise with a shot
gun , because people go hunting.
Q

Well, do you think that there is a substantive

difference, then?

One offensa charged here was the gun which

is legal to possess and the other one, a pistol, which is
illegal to possess.
MR. BOWMAH:

No, your Honor, I don’t because the

statute charges "with & deadly weapon" and of course even under

the deadly weapon statute in Tennessee, if it can bo done, the
.presumption is if you carry a hand gun, it's with intent to
fo , rmed, but it can be also with a rifle where it was used
for the purpose of going armed.

That is, if I did use that

weapon to shoot somebody or to hold up a service station.
Q

Mr. Bowman, in Tennessee, is there a difference

between a mistrial and acquittal in Tennessee?
MR. BOWMAN:

Yes, your Honor.

Is there any reason why this couldn't have been

Q

declared a mistrial rather than acquittal?
x. .-sowft&Ni

I think the same question would have bee

rai; V.': all tfg vmy up the line, Mr. Justice, if there had been

an acquittal as there has been now.
0

It wasn't discussed, this trial point was never

discussed as I read the record.
MR. BOWMANIt naver was even mentioned that the
proceedings—

Q

Wo11, is there any peculiar rule in Tennessee

that makes that necessary?
MR. BOWMAN:

Mr. Justice, not that I know of.

Wow

it3s possible there was, but 1 do not know of any.
What would nave bean the situation if this man had
walked in with a .22 caliber pistol in one hand and a .22
caliber rifle in-the other hand?

I daresay that this Court

arr other Court would allow a prosecution to establish for
armed robbery with a pistol, then for armed robbery
rifle.

The question of being

think would arise under those

with the

two separate offenses I don’t
circumstances, but if 1 apply it

to the facts as we haw here, that As exactly what is trying to
be done, trying to >

it two separate offenses by a change

in the weapon.
0

You haven’t mentioned one of the tests in some of

the cares, in evaluating double jeopardy, and that is whether
the same evidence is involved?
MR. BOWMAN:
the same o£f<

Yea, Tennessee has applied over the years

se tests and there have been cases in Tennessee

as far back as the early 1800’s, Hite, versus;,.State

which made

tl Kit distinction between rhere a bank note was stolen payable to
or 3 br u:-, the

war initiated and acquitted and because it

IS
turned out that the bank note was payable at the other bank,

:: :b r.hey reindicted him, and the Court said this was not
double jeopardy.

But here again, it would just like if the

dir.se time they had. said he had stolen the property of
Mr. Justice and the second tine he had stolen the property of
another one of the Justices, so Tennessee says those two cases
are not the sat?e offenses, and of course it is our contention
that the 'jobbery, the basic argument of this crime is the sane:
offense in both cases.
v?

Mr. Bowman, a moment ago in your argument you

said that you thought the State could have proceeded notwith­
standing exclusion of the gun for simple prosecution for
robbery.

vould that have carried as savers a maximan penalty

as if they had been able to introduce evidence of the gun?
MR, EOWHAH:

No, Mr. Justice, under Tennessee lav-

tor armed robbery you can be given the death sentence or any

iiino less to a minimum of 10 years, for simple robbery, and
y.'iv' be* mistaken as to what the punishment is. I -believe it in
three to ten years.

The punishment would not have been affected

by not having been able to prove the gun.
This was the big thing, to increase the punishment

:<ie the purpose in alleging the gun, but there would have been
nothing that would have kept it from going on and proving it
:-?as simple rotbery, and the only robbery involved here, and
tie : vbberv of this service station.

17
Now tu:.:

tu that have been applied have been the

■Suae as in i-.be: f tts oflease test and you read the cases over
fclis years and it:... really hard in lots of those cases to
determine.what is being held but in most of the same offensa
tests, it's talkire about the white and the black horse, a
bank note payable at the Mechanics Bank instead of at the
American Bank, a ear bearing a wrong serial number as compared
to a car bearing the right serial number, brass and bronze
roller,* banks-, and so forth,

But each of these cases deals

with a substantive matter in the indictment,a

substantive

«attor of that particular, whether it be common lav,’ or statutory
crime„
Q

Mow when you are talking about this series of

casea,- Mr. Bowman, arc you talking about Tennessee cases and
Federal cases?
Up until Benton against Maryland , decided in 1969,
Tennessee wasn't obligated in any way

to follow the Federal

test of double jeopardy, was it?
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

No, your Honor.

Well, those are of interest as far as Tennessee

law goes, but we are here to determine the Federal constitutione
insue only after Beaton against Maryland, is that correct?
MR. BOWMAN:

Yes.

The Federal Courts have applied and have held it is
n.

•• fcituii • •a.u.'.ly proper to apply the same nffense test and

18
even recently in the various circuits
holding that this is a .proper test to determine the double
jeopardy provisions.
Q

And that is easy enough in the Federal system,

where we are at least more or less familiar with the rules and
practices of procedures on indictments but when we run into
this archaic Tennessee system, it becomes a little hard to
apply, particularly when Tennessee seems to say that if a
grand jury chooses to be specific in its indictment, then it
carves out that offense only; a dark horse larcency, and that's
a

-separate offense from a white horse larcency.

That's the

only thing that those cases can mean, isn’t it?
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

I think you're right.

Then they are different offenses because the grand

jury has chosen to specify the offense and make a distinguishing
offense .
MR. BOWMAN:

That’s right.

If they would have said

larcency of the horse of Sam Jones.
Q

Larcency of & horse of Sam Jones, then black or

white would come under the indictment ?
ill. BOWMAN:

That's right, but if they had said, t

hors- ■ of Sam Jones and it turned out to be Bob Marshall' s, of
course we have a different situation.
0

A different: situation.

«1. • aapmj :

When you lock at the facts in the

-

'U ' ' • i-ioY, and vh'

/ariou •? opinions in the particular case?

earn 1 feel that whatever test you would apply, either the
evidence or suvne offense, you are going to find that ther
in the same crime in all situations, that the robbery was the
only crime that Was committed under Tennessee law, and that
ays,dying this and to the standards set forth by this Court, ih
ths.ro is double jeopardy.
Q

But to show it was larcency committed with a

dangerous weapon, the evidence is not the same, is it?
MR. BOWMANi

Tt could have been shown if the

indictment simply said—
Q

Well, we are looking at the indictment as it was

in each of the two indictments.

It's different evidence in

cue second caes as to the nature of the dangerous weapon from
. V., it would have been in the first, case.
MR. BOWMAN:-. Mas . Chief Justice.

It would have

yuired that a different type of weapon be proven.
„

Q

You couldn't have established the case under the

, sccac indictment, from what you say of Tennessee law, by
oiny a kind of weapon not described in the indictment?
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

Your question, as I understand It—

1 have forgotten which came first, the pistol or

the rifle, butKR., ro'YlANs
,: e

riire we;.;

The pistol was the first indictment and

the second indictment

20

Q

Well, in the trial on the rifle indictment;

«eraId they have made a cate by showing that he used a pistol?
bowman:

In the rifle indictment could they haw;

made a case showing he used a pistol?

I don't think so, but

I don't know.

Q

One short answer, that the «arae rifle was used

in both—
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

Pardon ms?

The exact same rifle was in both?

MR. BOWMAN:

Yes, it's the same weapon both times.

There weren't two weapons used in the commission of this orim*
There was only one»
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Mr. Falk.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP EVERETT H. FALK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FALK;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The central issue, of course, in this case is
whether these two indictments, the first charging robbery
accomplished with a pistol and the second charging robberyaccomplished with a rifle charges two separate offensas.

If

they do,, than of course the Defendant or the Petitioner here
enti­ led to his plea of double jeopardy. If not, we contend
«?* ^ ,*j »y»

is not entitled to his plea of double jeopardy and he

20

%":Ei convicted of robbery with a rifle.
Ivor', in Tennessee, as the quesfioninc of Mr. Bowman
has indicated, where the indictment describes with particular!*
state 1b required to prove with ^particular

-aftd- wharfc-

there is a material variance between the indictment and the
proof, the; prosecution can be .

terminated at that point, el the

by dismissal or by a directed verdict or by a mistrial.
Q

Well, doesn’t the very fact that there sas a

directed verdict of acquittal under the first indictment show
that in Tennessee, at least there was a separate offense, havir
Ir-'sieved him for armed robbery by use of a pistol, end that
the grand .jury carved cut an offense and the state said he is

.b: guilty of that offense, or else they couldn’t have had a
directed verdict of acquittal?
Msb FALK:

That’s correct, Mr. Justice, that is our

position that it is a separate offense and that the second
indictment charged a different offense and that the second
indictmsnt charging a different offense, it would preclude the
Petitioner from prevailing on his plea of double jeopardy.
It is our opinion that the Fifth Amendment

through the Fourteenth Amendment applicable at Tennessee
prohibits successive prosecutions only for the same offense,
'mb. r.ot necessarily for the same act.

The same offense is the

proscription 'o which the Fifth Amendment applies and
c .it1;

to which the Tennessee constitutional provision

21
also applies.

Q

Wov.Ii'.n'x yon bo io. better shape iS you had

two statutes, one for robbery with a rifle, one tor robbery
with e pistol, which you don't have?
MR. FALK;

Wa would be in battel* shape, Mr. Justice.

I dca’t thin! that it would necessarily ba controlling in
this case. X think that the statute in Tennessee prescr x b
or carves out or describes the offense of robbery, robbery

being the forcible taking of property from the person through
violence or through putting in fear.

Now, the deadly-

weapon in this case or in any case would ba the means by
which the person from whom the property was taken was put in
fear.
Q

Under the pleading rules in Tennessee, I gather•

:-c;h?.ie as they seem to be, it would have been sufficient for
-hw indictment tc have alleged robbery by use of a deadly
weapon, to-wit:

a firearm.

MR. FALK: It would have been permissible and the

State would have been allowed to prove a /"deadly type of weapdtt >
I

‘

‘

under such description.
Q

h firearm.

MR. tAIKz h firearm, yes, Mr. Justice.

If, however,

oho indictment describes the particularity, the type of deadly
ws-apnn or th® typ* of firearm, then the State is required
to prove that .

22
Q

in Tennessee?

MR. FALK: In Tennessee.

Q

The Stats has elected to make a separate offenso,

otherwise there could not have been a directed verdict of
acquittal.
MR. FALK;
Q

That*s right, Mr. Justice.

Well, what is a directed verdict of acquittal

in this case?
MR. FALK;

In this case, a directed verdict of

acquittal, in our opinion, acquits the Petitioner of thecrime
on the basis of the material variance. The issue decided

by that directed verdict of acquittal is the issue which was
the subject o£ the material variance, to-wits

that the

betifciossr did not rcb this person with a pistol.

That is the

issue.
Q
of what"?

Well, the verdict said, "We find him not guilty

Not guilty of violating the statute of Tennessee,

which says robbery with the use of a deadly weapon.

Isn't

that what it said?
MR, TMtK: X believe, Mr. Justice, that the directed
verdict said ha was not guilty -as charged in the indictment.
<:

Well, I ask yon the same question I asked

Mr. Bowman."It was the same weapon that was used in both

cases?
MR. FALK;

Oh, yes, Mr. Justice.

Q

M. -. FALK:

The same witness testified in both.

Mr. Albright, I believe, who was an investigator for the
Clarksville Police Department, testified in both cases.
Q

Does that get into the double jeopardy problem?

MR. FALK:

I don't believe it does,

we don’t

disagree with the fact that the Petitioner was placed in
j ae-psrdy in the first trial.

We will have to admit that, that

he was in jeopardy in his first trial, and if this second
offense is the same as his first offense, then—

I don't believe so, Mr. Justice, on the

trial that ho had committed the robbery with the rifle, they
lie not do that.

Want you are saying is that Tennessee follows the

.'."let variance rule,

bo you happen to know how many states

■fail into that category?

R« FALK:

X have nov. been, able to determina the

■■-race number of states.

I believe that the majority rule

'.:,aanq the states is towards a more lenient determination of
whether a variance is material.

More leeway is given in most

states, I would say, in determining whether variance is
material than in Tennessee.

However, I don’t know whether

Tennessee is the only state or how many states do follow this
rather strict material variance rule that Tennessee follows.

0.

May I ask, Mr. Falk, X gather the state concede

we are to decide tea issue before us based on Federal double
jeopardy atandards?
MR. FALK:

I believe that Federal double jeopardy

standards are applicable to the State of Tennessee.

Benton

versus Maryland.
Q

If I am right as to dates, X think we decided

tentpr, which subjected the states to Federal double jeopardy
standard?:-, on June 25, 1969.

As 1 understand it, this second

::.:ial and conviction was on March .1969, three months earlier.
MR. FALK:

Q

Yes, that is true.

The state still concedes that the Federal

standards apply?
MR. FALK:

Well, the Federal standards were not

applicable at the trial, for Benton versus Maryland

had not

been decided at the trial of the Petitioner, but I believe
that, this Court can use the Federal standards to—

26

0

well, the principle of Be-nten against Maryland

was ra&dc-i fully retroactive.

m„ FALK: Yes.,
Q

In two different cases that was made explicit.

MR. FALKt Yes, that is my understanding, Mr. Justice,
that it is retroactive.

It is our opinion that Federal double

jeopardy standards are applicable.
0

The Federal constitutional guarantee against

double jeopardy is applicable.

The problem here is the

impact of that standard with the—what I have referred to as
r

the archaic pleading rules of Tennessee.
MR, FMi'ds

That seems fee be the problem.

Wa would

contend that although archaic, the Tennessee rule, the
strict rule with respect to material variance actually pro­
tects the accused in several respects.

First, it requires

the State to prove all of the allegations contained in the
indictment that are not surplusage.

It has the advantage of

identifying the crime 'with a high degree of particularity.
that respect, it would minimize the chance and accused would
receive an unjust conviction.
•v'e would also state it reduces the chance of error
in the trial court in determining whether e. variance is
material, in that it would require the state to prove the
charges as described in the indictment.
So wo contend that while it may not be in the

Mr. Falk, are you familiar with the Court's

decision last term in Jorn?
MR. FALK;
Q

Yesf I am.

You didn't cite it in your brief and I think

your opponents didn't cits it.

Do you feel it has no bearing

I think it has a bearing.

to determine whether or not the trial judge abused
Aeration in declaring a mistrial, if a mistrial had been

declared in this case.
Q

Well, is there any practical difference as to

u : between directing a verdict of acquittal at this stage
of the trial and having a mistrial under Tennessee law?
MR. FALK;

Under Tennessee law, no.

Under Federal

law, " would say- the only difference would be that by
dixvK,xir.g a verdict of acquittal, it would perhaps raise the
of: collateral estoppel at a second trial, whether or not
i:... c. ..

iscuss were decided in the first trial.

A mistrial

Ic! : -,t raise the issue of collateral estoppel but a directed

O

But if the practical consequences are the same

it wonid he unusual if Federal law would provide for a
different outcome in one than in the other, wouldn't if?
HR. FALK:
o

Yes, it Would.

Well, except clearly with mistrial there might

or might not be a problem under Jorn

but with acquittal it i

certainly vary clear he could never again be tried for armed
robbery with the use of a deadly weapon, to-wit, a firearm,
to-wit, a pistol, isn't that clear?
MR. FALK:
q

That is clear, Mr. Justice.

It would be a separate offense and the acquitta

absolutely barred subsequent prosecution for that offense.
Mistrial might ba up to™
MR. FALK:

Q

I think a mistrial might have raised the

We concede he was in jeopardy at the first trial
Under the indictment charging him with armed

robbery by use of a .22 caliber pistol, isn't that right?
MR. FALK:
Q

He was in jeopardy of that?

HR. FALK:
Q

Yes, Hr. Justice.

He was in jeopardy of that?

MR*. FALK:
Q

Yes, Hr. Justice.

He was in jeopardy of that, yas.

Had he been acquitted of that, he could never

again be brought to trial for that?
MH. FALK:

That is true.

I think that is perfectly

29

clear.
Q

It is probably also true under Jorn, but

depending upon what the genesis of the mistrial was, isn't
that what Jorn holds?
MR. FALK:

¥■:

s f that is what Jorn holds..

I think it

is possible he could have contended double jeopardy? even
if a mistrial had been declared under the authority of Jorn.
So in summary, we would contend that the variance
was material under Tennessee practice.

It was material even

under Tennessee8a interpretation of the robbery statute.,
because it went to the heart of the means by which the property
was taken from the individual, by violence and putting in fear.
The means used to put the victim in fear was the deadly weapon.
In the first indictment it was described as a pistol, and in
the second indictment it was described as

ti

.22 caliber rifle.

We’contend this is a material averment going right to the
heart of the means by which the person or victim was put in
fear, and therefore as a material alleging, a material averment,
a variance between the two would be a material variance and
the same evidence would not support both indictments.
Q

Of course that would be, as suggested earlier,

a ridiculous argument to make in the Federal system where you
can amend an.

indictment practically right up to the time of

verdict to conform to the proof.

You are saying that Tennessee

has held that these are separate offenses and this Court is

30
under the' double jeopardy clause of tiie Federal
iou ho require Tennessee to amend its law as to the
procad-

.in its own state Criminal Courts.
UR. FALK:
Q

that is the substance of our supposition.

Mr. Falk, does Tennessee criminal practice

recognize -the bill of particulars?

Can a defendant demand a

bill of particulars?
MR. FALK:

Not as such, Mr. Justice.

I don't knew

of any provision in Tennessee law for a bill of particulars as
. such.

As Mr. Bowman stated, there is a statute that does

permit an amendment of an indictment upon the consent of the

c ransels

involved, the prosecuting attorney and defense' couns-a

l.i this case, according to Mr. Bowman who was the defense
, unsel at the trial level, this

was not agreed to.

He

sto ed, 1 believe, that he would not agree to this, so that
statute, although available, was not utilized in this ease.
Q

Well, suppose the indictment alleges armed

robbery with & deadly weapon, the defendant doesn't have any
pre-trial machanism available to him to demand from the state
.what deadly weapon are you charging that 3, bsed?
MR.. FALK:

There is no procedure that I know of for

the defendant to utilize to obtain from the state or to
require the state to describe with particularity the deadly
weapon used.
q

would that be : sufficient indictment as a matte

31

of Tennessee law, just "a deadly weapon?
I believe it would, Mr » Justice, it would

MR. FALK:

be a valid indictment in Tennessee just to allege that the
parson was put in fear through the use of a deadly weapon.
Q

Then yon could show it was a crowbar, a dagger,

a kitchen knife or a machine gun or pistol or hand gun?
MR. FALK:

There is a substantial body of law in

Tennessee as to what constitutes a deadly weapon.
Q

Wall, '1 assume there is, but let’s assume those

a. c i as s anyw ay.
MR. FALK:

Well, I don’t know about a crowbar, but

firearms have been held to be deadly weapons.
the r ture of the way

It goes more to

the 'weapon is used when it gets to

/sapons not traditional—thought of as deadly weapons.
Q

Perhaps I am repeating my brother Rehnquist’s

question when X ask, is there any way that a defendant in
Tennessee charged under an indictment with robbery with the use
of a deadly weapon, can get anything from the prosecution as to
what deadly weapon you are thinking about?
MR. FALK;

In Tennessee I don't believe there is a

specific procedure whereby he can get that particular
w\v.

We do have a preliminary hearing procedure in

Wannesses which was required recently by statute.
know of any

I do not

way that a defendant could require the state to

«ullage with particularity the deadly weapon used.

32

Q

Why is it if that would be a sufficient

indictment, why is it the practice in Tennessee to get very,
very detailed specific, explicit white horse, black horse,
brass rollers, bronze rollers, pistols and rifles?

Why is it

done?
MR. FALK:

Well, 1 don’t know why it is done.

It's

a long line of case precedents beginning back in the early
1800's, requiring where the state alleges with particularity
to prove with particularity .
Q

Yes, but then why does the state allege it? If

it then is locked up in the duty of proving it, if it doesn't
have to allege it?
MR. FALK:

Well, I don't know.

X think it varies
t

throughout the state between grand juries as to how these'
things are alleged.

It is obvious in this case, I think, that

if was'alleged with too high a degree of particularity.

X

don't know why it occurs or could occur that it ’would be alleged
with not quite enough degree of particularity.

My opinion is

that a deadly weapon allegation would be sufficient.
not seen such an indictment returned in Tennessee.

1 have
I have not

seen, a lot of them, but I have not. seen one that is returned
with this little degree of particularity.

Most of them allege

robbery with a deadly weapon, to-wit, a gun.

X think a gun is

a common description of the deadly weapon where a gun is used.
Q

Mr. Falk, what significance is the finding of the

second jury, that they say upon their oath, that they find the

defendants, naming them, guilty of armed robbery? They didn'
\
use the word .rifle c:c pistoleither one.«
Isn't it all cue
crime?

Isn't that the crime they were charged with in both

cases# armed robbery?
MR. FALK:

Wellf it is our opinion that—-wall# first

of all# there is .not a crime in Tennessee such as armed robbery
"e such.

It is robbery and if a deadly weapon is used# then

the statute provides for a much greater punishment all the
way up to and including the death penalty.
Q

But they were found guilty of armed robbery.

That is what the jury's verdict was.
MR. FALK:

Well# this jury's verdict# I think#

stating armed robbery# means they were found guilty of robbery
accomplished by the use of a deadly weapon.
Q

A .22 rifle.

in your answers?

You didn't go that far# did you#

Didn't go that far# did you?

MR. FALK:

Well# they didn’t say that in their

verdicfc, that* s true.
Q

So if he had been, tried on the other one# they

would have brought in the 3ante verdict?
MR. FALK:

That would have been the same verdict#

armed robbery, or robbery accomplished by the use of a deadly

Q

That gives you a problem, doesn’t it?

MS. FALK:

It doesn't give me any problem#

34

Mt'c Justa.ce, because X don't believe that the verdict is
required to be that specific.
a^ieijteC» ‘:'‘i

X think that since what is

.-.idxcfcmen t becomes the means? of putting the

person zn fear, the means of obtaining this property by force,
this is the essential ingredient that was alleged in the
indictment*
C*

iso they are both the same?

Would there be any

difference between a . .12 and a .45 pistol?
JR. FALK:

There would be a difference*

1 don't know

whether-that difference would be viewed as material 'dr not.
I here is a much greater difference between a pistol and a rifle
Q

Well, if he were found not guilty of robbery

witn a .32, could you indict him and try him for armed robbery
with a .45?
MR. FALK:

I believe.you could, Mr. Justice.

They’re

obviously not the same type of weapon.
G

As using the same pistol as evidence?

You used

the same rifle in both of these cases.
I4E„ FALK:
Mr. Justice on that.

Well, I would have to disagree with
X think that the rifle was never

xnuroduced in evidence at the first trial, regardless of
whether it was in the courtroom or not.
Q

Well* the Police Chief or whatever his title

vac, tostifled as to a rifle and X am asking you, even though
it does not appear in the record, is that the same rifle that

35
was used in the second trial?
MR. FALK:

It was the same rifle.

It was, I will

have to—from my reading of the record, it was the same rifle.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Falk.

Mr. Bowman, you have a few minutes left.

Do you

have anything further? REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER N. BOWMAN,ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BOWMAN:

I would just like to add that an

approval of this practice would allow an

Attorney General

in the State of Tennessee to indict a man for armed robbery,
knowing he was alleging the wrong type of weapon, try him, have
a verdict of not guilty returned, again indict him, again
alleging the wrong type of weapon, again try him and sc,- forth
on

down the line.

The Attorney General stated at the first

trial, and it's in the records, "I made a mistake in the
indictment."
Now the approvalwould allow him to make a mistake
and try a man over and over and over again until he finally
decided to allege in the indictment or have the grand jury
urn an indicte

with the right type of weapon.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you, Mr. Falk,

Thank you, Mr. Bowman.

The case is submitted.
