CHIEF JUSTICE BERGER:

We will hear arguments next

in No. 77, North Carolina against Rice.

Mr. Safron, you

may proceed whenever you are ready.
MR, SAFRON:
the court:
for writ of

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case is before this court upon a petition
.f:ert1or1

to the

u. s.

Court of Appeals

for the Fourth Circuit which held in Rice versus North Carolina
that upon the strength of Pearce the imposition of a
greater sentence is impermissible in a situation in which
a defendant receives a trial

de novo

in the

Superior Court from a lower criminal court and that was
the legal conclusion without the courts giving any legal
reasoning,

The court then went on to state in reference

to all the cases to the

contra

that they simply

disagree and ordered the State of North Carolina to
expunge any record of Mr. Rice's conviction in the Bunk1n
County Superior Court,

Wayne Claude Rice was originally

arrested on July 2, 1968 for driving under the influence
of alcohol .

On July 19 , 1968, he was tried in the

Bunk1n

County Court which was then in existence and received a
sentence of a nine month sentence suspended upon payment
of a fine of $100 and costs.

As was his absolute right,

he applied for a trial de novo

in the

Bunkin

On August 2, his right to trial

was assured and on that day, he first pted

3

guilty to 12 offenses of uttering worthless checks and then
was tried upon his plea of not guilty on the charge of
driving under the influence.
QUESTION:

I noticed, Mr. Safron,in the brief,

the reference to the worthless check charge.

T~at has

nothing to do with the issues before us at all.
MR, SAFRON:

Only in this regard, your Honor:

There were these 12 worthless check charges,

He pled guilty

to those, was then tried upon a plea of not guilty as to
driving under the influence.

The sentences that were then

i~posed he received a two year active sentence for driving
under the influence, the maximum then permitted under the
law,. but at the same time when the judge sentenced him
as to the worthless check charges, he was sentenced to
12 consecutive one month sentences to run concurrently
with the sentence imposed for driving under the influence,
QUESTION:

But it was only partially concurrent.

In other words, one was a total of one year;

the driving

while intoxicating was two years7
MR, SAFRON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor,
So, we do not have really the concurrent

sentence doctrine?
MR, SAFRON:

Not except for -- for the first year

the sentences were concurrent;whereas the court could have
imposed the sentence consecutively, it was imposed concurrently

4

and he received no greater sentence as a result of having pled
guilty to the worthless check charges.
QUESTION:

We have at least one additional year

based on the driving while intoxicated?
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:

Yes> your Honor, that is true.
And in the original so-called sub-

constitutional court to quote your adversaries, sentence was
what?
~1R. SAFRON:

His original sentence was 9 months

susper.ded upon payment of $100 fine ano costs.
QUESTION:

So, we have before us this issue

squarely presented,
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:

Quite clearly.
It is not blunted at all really by

the concurrent sentence doctrine.
MR. SAFRON:

Not at all.

In fact, concurrent

sentence, your Honor, I believe is merely something that
applies to the Federal judiciary and is not applicable
to the States .
QUESTION:

There was only one indictment, the

forged check?
MR. SAFRON:
apart, your Honor.

That was something separate and

He received 12 -- there were 12

warrants in the County Court.

Yes, your Honor.
And was he convicted by the same judge

MR. SAFRON:

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:

I have no idea.
I am very confused how the check

thing got involved in this case.
MR, SAFRON:

Only in this respect, your Honor:

On the same day when his trial de novo

for the worthless

checks came up for hearing, he al.so was on for hearing for
his drunk driving charge.
QUESTION:

That was a

QUESTION:

trial too?

These are all de novo.
What is the maxilll1.1Dl sentence for the

bad check charge?
MR. SAFRON:

It depends, your Honor, upon the

At the present time, if it does not exceed $50,

the maximum is 30 days.
QUESTION:

were

these all under

$50?

6

MR. SAFRON:

Apparently so, your Honor,

QUESTION:

How many offenses subject to this

procedure of a trial de novo?
MR, SAFRON:

Every petty offense, your Honor.

The

right to trial de novo is an absolute right granted in the
North Carolina constitution,
QUESTION:

But only for particular offenses?

MR. SAFRON:· No, your Honor,

For every offense

which is originally tried in what are not say the District
Courts,

This could be an ordinance violation,

An overtime parking ticket,
QUESTION:

Traffic violation,.

What offenses are subject first to

trial in the District Court?
MR. SAFRON:

In the District Court, your Honor?

Or perhaps let me express it the other way:

The original

jurisdiction of the Superior Court is only applicible to
felonies .

All other offenses the District Court has

original jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

That is --

In the District Court, in any of the

cases tried in the District Court, no right to trial by
jury?
MR. SAFRON:

There is no right to trial by jury

in the District Court , your Honor,in criminal manners.
QUESTION:

Every offense tr:fable

in the

District Court is an offense as to which on conviction the

7

accused may have a trial de novo of right, is that it?
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:

That is exactly right, your Honor.
Are these worthless check charges,

would they have been

triable

MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:

Oh yes• your Honor.
I see.

MR. SAFRON:

in the District Court?

Were they in fact in this case?

Oh yes• your Honor.

They were

tried in what was then the County Court.
QUESTION: Did he pleed guilty?
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:

And then he appeared and pled guilty.
He pled guilty to the worthless check

charges?
MR, SAFRON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor,
What punishment did he get in the

District Court or the County Court on those charges?
MR, SAFRON:
QUESTION:

I am really not sure, your Honor.
In any event, whatever it was he appealed

and got what, a new and larger sentence?
MR, SAFRON:

No, your Honor, I believe it was the

same but I am really not sure,

QUESTION:

Was this his first conviction for

driving while intoxicated?
MR. SAFRON:

No, your Honor.

In 1962, he was

convicted of escape, temporary larceny of an automobile,
larceny of an automobile and drunk driving.
QUESTION:

It was not his first.

This was -This explains

brief, it is stated this was Mr. Rice's

first conviction for driving while intoxicated.

This is a

misstatement .
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:
nine month sentence

This is a misstatement, your Honor.
Then, secondly, I am confused about the
imposed in the County Court when the

statut~ says for the first conviction only 30 days.
MR. SAFRON:

Oh, we are talking now, your Honor,

9

of nine months for driving under the influence.

Thirty

days was the bad check charge.

QUESTION:

I am not talking about the sentence,

am talking about the statute.

Doesn't the statute make the

first offense punishable in no more than 30 days?
MR. SAFRON:

No, your Honor.

Now, there is a

problem involved here due to the fact that the sentence
for driving under the influence was administered subsequewt to Mr, Rice's trial,

Whether or not that amendment

in the statute and the downgrading of the maximum should
fog the issue here, I am really not sure,

The maximum

now, I believe, is six months for first offenses, driving
under the influence,
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:

In any event, he got nine months .
He received nine months at a time

when two years was a permissible maxUffillll, your Honor,

SAFRON:

Only for a third offense?
No, your Honor.

At that time,

the statute permitted up to two y~ars for first offenses
driving under the influence.

He did receive the maximum

but this is fogging the issue because of a subsequent
legislative downgrading of the maximum sentence.
QUESTIONL:

Well, it is evident I am

be-fogged by your statutes.

Maybe Mr. Van Alstyne can

HR. SAFRON:

But, since I have this here, I

just want to point out that,sincc 1948,Mr. Rice has spent
more time in custody than he has out of custody.
QUESTION:

One last sucstion.

Even if he were to

plead guilty in the lower court, does he have a right to a
trial de novo in the Superior Court?
HR. SAFRON:

There is an absolute right to trial

de novo in the State of North Carolina, your Honor.

It

does not matter whether or not the defendant pled guilty
or not guilty.

If he pled guilty and is not satisfied with

the sentence that is imposed, he can apply for trial de novo

that wipes the entire proceeding clean.

It is completely

off the record and he will then have an opportunity for
a jury trial in the Superior Court as if nothing had ever
happened before.

I have just been advised that according

in the Superior Court as he had received in the County
Court upon the worthless check charges,

Let me clear this up before we go

Is it possible that the information about his

prior record came to the attention of the court,the second
court involved in the de novo trial?
MR. QSAFRON:

Your Honor, I am confident that

upon his trial in Superior Court, ~lhich was then the

11

responsibility of the solicitor, a full jury trial, that
this information was obtained.

Now, I am familiar with

procedures in the District Courts, previously the County
Courts ,

The only record available to the judge at the

ti.me is a list of the man's convictions in that particular
court.

The court does not have available to it, due to the

tremendous number of cases which are processed,the availability
of, say, an FBI record,or in our State,a

he sentence -- two months later after the sentence was

pronounced, the judge had come across that wrap sheet,
Would he have done ar.}'thing about it?
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:

Nothing at all, your Honor.
What is the difference between that

case and this case?

We are talking, now, about the District Court judge or the
Superior Court judge?

eyes of our case law and our statutes, this wipes the

Does he have any other way of appealing?

MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:

From the District Court?
Yes, sir.

MR. SAFRON:

No, your Honor.
So, that is an appeal.

MR. SAFRON:

Well, I would not call it an appeal

as such.

law of the State of North Carolina, Massachusetts, and
several other states provides that there shall be a right to

QUESTION:

But under the constitution, is a man

convicted in a District Court of North Carolina entitled
to an appeal to test the legality of his conviction?
MR. SAFRON:

context, your Honor, there is no -QUESTION:

The procedure would be this, of

District Court, he can apply for trial de novo in the

If he is unsatisfied with the conviction

and, well, I should not say sentence, but unsatisfied with
the conviction in the Superior Court, he may apply -- he
may appeal as a matter of right to the North Carolina Court
of Appeals.

From the North Carolina Court of Appeals, he

could then, if it is a constitutional issue presented which
had not previously been determined, apply either by

North Carolina.

will be enhanced, is there any other way he can test that

MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:

I have no idea.
He is not in custody?
But we have a Fourth Circuit opinion

order, which tells us that

must expunge the record and,

he probably

will, then according to that expunction order, this
conviction would never have existed and there would be no
possibility for~No. l,to impose a sentence which is
required upon the second conviction,driving under the
influence or license revocation for that period of time.
QUESTION:

What if we held the case was moot

when the Fourth Circuit acted? Would that solve your
problem?
MR. SAFRON:

No, your Honor, because it is

obvious that the Fourth Circuit would merely reinstate
in yet another case this doctrine and we would be faced with

19
what we are facing now.
QUESTION:

Then you want us to give an advisory

opinion.
MR, SAFRON:

I don't believe it is advisory, Your

Honor, because we have the order of the Fourth Circuit requiring expunetion staring us 1n the face.

This 1s a valid order

and I would say to this Court that this order gives validity to
the status of our case before this Court,

MR. SAFRON:

It is not moot, Your Honor.

There is an

effective.
The American Bar Association has had the opportunity
to review this very contention.

In the Am9rican Bar Association

standard relating to Jury trial, I point this Court 1s attention
to l,l(b) 1n the American Bar's standard.

The approved draft,

issued in 1968, states:
"Defendants 1n all criminal cases should have the
right to be tried by a Jury of twelve, whose verdict must
be unanimous.

Except where not barred by applicable

Constitutional provisions, the right to Jury trial may
be limited 1n one or more of the following ways : "
"(b)

By

requiring trial without Jury for lesser

offenses provided there 1s a right to appeal without

20

unreasonable restrictions to a Court in which a trial

,·

de novo by jury has been had,"
That is exactly the situation which our District Court
system provides,
In the commentary in the ABA approved draft, it also

discusses the various states in which this is a part of the
State Constitution and that includes Delaware, New Hampshire,
North carolina, Virginia and Nassachusetts,
In fact, I would like to point this Court's attention

to the fact that the Supreme Judicial Council of the State of
Massachusetts has Just had t he opportunity to review this very
issue,

In Massachusetts, as in North Carolina, this is an

organic part of the State Constitution,
In the case of .Mann v, Commonwealth, which was first

decided June 15 of this year and is reported in 271 Northeast
Second at 331, a very recent case, came out Just the end of
last month, the Chief Justice of I<lassachusetts, before a unani•
mous court, found, as has the State Supreme Court; of North
Carolina, Virginia, Nebraska, Michigan, Maine and the First
Circuit Court of Appeals in Lemieux v. Robbins, that the imposition of a greater sentence upon trial de novo 1s not violative
of due process and does not contradict this Court's opinion in
North Carolina v. Pearce.
QUE.STION:

Do you know how recurring it is that the

sentences 1n the Superior Court are considerably higher than

21

the District Courts or County Courts in the same case?
MR. SAFRON:

Well, Your Honor, th1s, of course, 1s

almost an impossible figure to produce.
If it were only one a year, you really

QUESTION:

wouldn't care, would you?
MR. SAFRON:

I can point this out, Your HonoI?:

Last

year, f1nally -- in December of last year~- our District Court
system was fully implemented through the hundred counties 1n
North Carolina and statistics we have reflect those eightythree counties which are under the adm1nistrat1ve office of the
oourts.

Last year, in those eighty-three out of the hundred

counties for which figures are available, there were sixteen
thousand seven hundred fifty-one of such hearings which
constituted fifty-seven po1nt four percent of all oases tried
in our Superior Court.
I would submit in this regard that when fifty-seven

the formalities of the Superior Court, a~e de novo trials,

You mean fifty-seven percent of them are

cases that came from the District Court.
MR. SAFRON:

That's right, Your Honor.

Of all crimi-

nal cases tried 1n our Superior Court, fifty-seven percent are
de novo hearings.
QUESTION:

I am wondering how you would describe

22

North Carolina's interest in not being restricted sentence-wise
when the case is tried in the Superior Court.
MR. SAFRON:

Your Honor, I would say this:

Obviously

the state has an interest 1n trying to save a system of criminal
justice. Without the District Courts, the Superior Courts will
not be able to function.
QUESTION:

But that isn't the issue here.

MR. SAFRON:

This is part of it, Your Honor.

If I

can just be blunt, we are frightened silly that if it is a oneway street, if the state and the defendant are not on a parity,
if every defendant knows that the sentence imposed below 1s the
absolute maximum, if he has everything to gain and possibly
nothing to lose. then I doubt if the Superior Courts can long
survive.
We are presently trying to keep up with the Constitutional requirement or speedy trial.

QUESTION:

Well, you are saying, then, that you would

like to handle the great bulk of your criminal litigation without a Jury.

Court Judge -QUESTION:

If sentences were less in the District

Courts than they are in the Superior Courts, perhaps they would

below?
MR. SAFRON:

the Petitioner's brief, he cites the Debonas case

1n New Jersey, which was determined by the Supreme Court of

New Jersey as a policy issue.

As a matter of policy, the

Supreme Court of New Jersey took the opportunity to criticize
the structuring of their l4unicipal Courts, which were locally
appointed part-time Judges.
In

North Carolina, we have a District Court system

24
with full-time judges.

It 1s a unified system which has taken

fifieen years to implement.

Tl;e professor cites comments from a

report in the mid-fifties and that report we took to heart and
the State of North Carolina revamped its entire Judicial system.
We have a completely unified system now with full-time Judges

who are paid a very respectable salary.
QUESTION:

Mr. Safron, do I gather what you are saying

is that in order to limit the number of appeals de novo, it iu
necessary to enhance the sentence every once 1n a while?
MR. SAFRON: Your Honor, no,

There are very few cases

in which that occurs.
QUESTION: What are you saying, then?

You are saying

you want to leave this intact. Why?
MR. SAFRON: Well, there areseveral reasons.
QUESTION: You said because you don't want to increase
the number of cases in the Superior Court.
MR, SAFRON:

Let me say this:

Number one, the

professor states 1n his brief there is no provision for representation

1n

the District Court.

That is wrong.

He cites as

precedent for one point the case of State v. Morris, which he
cites for the proposition that the Supreme Court of North
Carolina has refused to adopt the holding in the patent case
which was the basis for Pearce, but in that very case -- State

v. Morris -- associate Justice Suzy Sharp held that a man has a
Constitutional right to representation by counsel if he 1e

We

If that man wishes to

appeal, it goes on to the Superior Court, with that same coun-

sel paid for

by

the State.

If he wishes to appeal to the Court

of Appeals, we pay tor counsel.
This year, we funded one million eight hundred
thousand dollars for appointment of counsel. We have public
defenders in two of our counties.

We have counsel 1n those

courts. The public defenders' offices, 1n their reports to the
court which -- excuse me, Your Honor, I see that
QUESTION:
nR. SAFRON:

Finish what you are saying.

In the public defenders I offices and

under our statutory scheme which provides for the appointment
of counsel, in any felony case and any misdemeanor case for
which the authorized punishment exceeds 3ix months 1n prison
or five hundred dollars, we have counsel.
To illustrate this very point, the public defenders'
offices in the two test counties where we presently have public
defenders, 1n one county they were appointed to represent
nine hundred forty-nine persons during the year.

That was

eight hundred seventy-seven felonies and they also were involved
in three hundred ninety-six serious misdemeanors.
They state:

"In the course of its representation,

the office made six hundred twelve appearances 1n the
District Court and four hundred four 1n the Superior

26
Court."
The other office made six hundred one appearances 1n
the District Court and two hundred thirty-nine 1n the Superior
Court,
We do have counsel in the District Court system.

If there are any questions -CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Van Alstyne,

Thank you,

MR. VAN AWTYNE:

Mr.

Chief Justice, may it please

this Court:

If I might, rather than launching into an original
argument, I would like to attempt to respond to some of the
questions which are directed to Mr, Safron simply by way of

helpful clarification.
So tar as the technicality of What it is called when
one seeks a new trial against the correction of what he may
believe to be an injustice committed in the course of bis

original trial in the General County Court or now 1n the
Diatrict Court, it 1s perfectly clear that even in the view of
the state, itself, it 1s an appeal,
Indeed, by turning to page seventeen of petitioner 1G
append1X one will note that the statute so defines it, itself,
It 1s called an appeal to Superior Court. Subsequently, appeal
from District Court.

Subsequently, appeal from Justice; trial

de novo.
~UESTION:

The only point, I suppose, Professor Van

Alstyne, is that unlike a conventional appeal, one need not
even alledge any error.
MR. VAN AWTYNE:
QUESTION:

Indeed,

One has an absolute right to this new

trial without even claiming any error in the original trial.
MR. VAN AWTYNE:

Unquestionably correct.

What needs to be observed side by side that

28
observation, however, is that it is also the exclusive recourse
one has from any grievance which he may honestly feel to purvey
that original trial.
In this respect, it seems to me, therefore, most

important that one take the accurate measure of the character
cf the Court in which he 1s first _tried.

QUESTION:

In that connection, does this mean if he

feels there is error below in the District Court that he may
not even move for a new trial 1n that . court? His only avenue
of relief is to take the so-called appeal.
I>lR. VAN ALSTYNE:
1s

To the best of

my

knowledge, that

the case. That 1s correct. There 13 no other reoo:Jrse.

The court in which he 1s first tried is not a court that merely
tries petty offenses.

I quite take exception to that

description.
Indeed, the original and exclusive jurisdiction,
original and exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court runs
to misdemeanors which, In North carolina, are defined as
offenses punishible by as much as two years in prison.
Indeed, that 1s exactly this case and that is how it
originated.

I think it quite, then, begs the question.

QUESTION: Which offense?
MR. VAN ALSTYNE:

On

the drunk driving offense,

itself, to be sure the Legislature has since revised the maximum penalty downward but at the time 1n question it was

29
pun1sh1ble by two years. There 1s no doubt or quarrel, then,
between us that sole jurisdiction in the first instance was 1n
the General County Court. There is no possible relief from
the sanction and result of that decision in the County Court
ether than through an appeal for trial de novo.
Q~TION: What about the paragraph at Section twenty
point one seventy-nine? As I read it, it says for a first
conviction it 1s punishible by a fine of not less than one
hundred dollars.
NR. VAN AI3TYNE:
Blackmun.

That's correct, Mr. Justice

In that respect, I think the clarification we were

seeking earlier may be 1n front of us.
Q~TION:

All right •

Q~TION: What about the point that was raised on
whether in the SUPerior Court information about the man's
prior record was available, which was not in the record of the
first court?
MR. VAN AI3TYNE:

That, of course, is a possibility.

Respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice, it was the burden of the
state so to demonstrate in the court below that there was that

kind of evidence in front of the Superior Court Judge not
present before the County Court Judge,

That evidence was not

produced,
It now is a matter of retrospective idle speculation

based upon the subsequent securing of a wrap sheet and other

30
data.

That 1s a possible explanation.
QUESTION:

Ia there a date on that sheet?

l'lR, VAN ALSTYNE: There 1s •
available to me,

It has not been made

I can only report to you a direct quotation

from the Federal Court of Appeals that says in this respect the
record reveals nothing which warrants the increased punishment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Van Alstyne, could -- do you mean you

have never seen this document?
MR, VAN ALSTYNE:

I have not,

QUESTION: And it wasn't before the court below?
MR. VAN ALSTYNE:

It was not,

CWESTION: But if you are right in your basic contention, this 1s wholly irrelevant.
MR, VAN ALSTYNE:

It 1s ,

QUESTION: Even if the reason for the enhanced
sentence had been information in the wrap sheet that was not
available in the lower oourt -MR, VAN ALSTYNE:
QUESTION:

Indeed• it is ,

If you are right, you still prevail,

This

is an irrelevant consideration, isn't it?
MR. VAN ALSTYNE:

Indeed,

I don't rest upon this

outside observation as critical to aff1rmance of the decision
below.

Indeed, a reasonable reading of the decision before this

court in an opinion of your authorship confines the permissibility of harsher sentencing pursuant to a subsequent trial to

31
evidence respecting tbe conduct or the accused, wh1cb conduct
must, itself, occur subsequent to the first trial.
It seems to me, in retrospect, that the manner 1n
which that line was drawn may well have anticipated this kind

of case whereby when the retr.1al occurs in a more formal court
following a trial in a court which does not even make a record,
necessarily, therefore, there 1s no record or the earlier trial
for the Superior Court Judge to compare and, thus, to determine
whether there bas been new evidence introduced respecting
aggravating circumstances of the crime or, indeed, additional
data respecting the background or the accused.
~TION: By the same token, I think, then, that
upon trial de novo in the Superior Court the defendant isn't
burdened by what bas happened in the District Court, either.
I mean, there 1s, as you said, no finding or an error. There
is no question of reviewing the summary of evidence or things
lilce that.

It 1s a brand new proceeding.
MR. VAN AISTYNE:

It

1s

no different than what could have

MR. VAN AIS'I'YNE:

QUESTION: So isn't the question here really whether
the state may interpose between him and a Constitutional trial,

32
a trial in the District Court without a jury and without a
record?
MR. VAN AWTYNE:

I think that 1s certainly among the

questions.

Isn't that a little different than your

A real problem could be

MR• VAN ALSTrnE:

I think it 1s a crucial point to

the case andmakes the outcome in the court below quite right
on that basis, alone.

I do not understand how any reasonable

concept of due process can contemplate the power of a state to
subJect a man to trial and punishment without any due process.
Indeed, the Judge reed not be law-trained.
exo eption to the description of these Judges.

There

I take

no

record to determine the voluntariness of pleas nor the

admissibility of ~vidence.

These are very stripped down,

economically operated courts.

They are operated now as the

state concedes without access to trial by jury with offenses
punishible by two years.
QUESTION:

The harm there 1s to the defendant when

te is first subjected to a trial in the District Court before

re can get to the Superior Court.
MR•, VAN ALSTrnE:

I think the harm is palpable and

addresses itself to every man's common sense.

To the extent

the state says that ifyou are willing to succomb to the punishment that has been imposed upon you by trading off that which
the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees, then we will, to that
extent, insulate from the rislc of more severe treatment.

It

is a kind of bargain that is made in the background without

any of the overt circumtances, however, which might ordinarily
participate in honest guilty plea bargaining. There is no
election here.

34

QUE.STION: Would you make the same argument 1f the
defendant had a cho1ce 1n the first place?
MR. VAN ALSTYNE:

It seems to me the case 1s somewhat

different and 1t 1s harder andcloser.

f'\1 frank position would

be that the result should be the same because I do think there
are other poisonous elements to this kind or procedure,
It 1s true that if he had an election in the first
instance respecting the court in which he might first be tried,
there would be less reason for this court to be apprehensive
that the Superior Court judges would harbor the mot1ve to discourage seeking access to theDistrict Court in the first
instance through the menace of harsher sentencing.
It is also true that with that election 1n front of
him honestly to be made 1n the initial preference for the
District Court, it may consciously be entertained by the
accused that he may be more leniently treated,

That, at least,

comes closer to an honest kind or negotiated election but that
is not this case.
QUESTION:

In your argument, I still don 1t see how

the Pearce rationale really solves your basic objection.
MR. VAN A~TYNE:

Oh, no,

ray

objection would exist

quite apart from Pearce.
QUESTION:

I see.

Even if the Court or Appeals

1s

correct, even if we affirmed this case, 1t seems to me that this
basic objection to the two tier proposal -- proceedure -- still

35

remains.
MR. VAN AUJTYNE:
QUESTION:

Yes •

He still has to --

MR. VAN ALSTYNE:
QUESTION:

I did not attempt in

tey

brief --

Indeed, it would remain even were North

Carolina to provide, as some states -- I gather New Jersey has
done it -- that the sentence may not exceed in the SuPerior
Court.
MR. VAN ALSTYNE: You would still have the same
argument.

I think there is an independent Constituional -QUESTION:

Is this automatic?

MR. VAL ALSTYNE:

Resp7ctfully, no, because .it is not

necessary for the court to affirm, to anticiate a next case.
That 1s to say, the appropriate case in which this issue would
be raised, it seems to me -QUESTION:

Without this basic obJection, it seems to

me the Pearce point 1s only gaining strength from this.
MR. VAN ALSTYNE: Well, respectfully, I think it has
separate strength.

Indeed, the reasoning of Pearce, 1f I may

quote the Court •sopinion, was ~his:

Due process of law requires

that vindictiveness against the defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the
sentencing he receives after a new trial.

Since the fear of

vindictiveness may Constitutionally deter a defendant's exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first

36
conviction, due process also requires that a defendant be freed
of apprehension of such a related retaliary motivation on the

part of the sentencing judge.
Respectfully, I submit that that, at least, is the
rationale on due process.
QUESTION:

In the absence of conduct subsequent to

the initial sentence -MR. VAN ALSTYNE:
QUESTION:

Indeed.

-- which would justify an increased

sentence after the -MR. VAN ALSTYNE: Yes •
QUESTION:
submission.

This would come down, I gather, in your

All we would decide in this case -- or would need

to decide in this case -- to affirm is that that approach
applies as much in this frame of reference as it did in what
we had before us in Pearce.
MR. VAN ALSTYNE: Yes.
QUESTION:

That would still leave what?

MR. VAN ALSTYNE:

It still leaves a Constitutional

naw remaining in the system which this Court will doubtless
have to consider in the course of time.
QUESTION:

In New Jersey you would have to argue the

other, wouldn•t :,ou
MR. VAN ALSTYNE:
QUF.STION:

Indeed.

-- since there I think it

MR. VAN AI.8TYNE:

That

1s

correct.

I have no doubt

that consistent w1th the U.s. v. Jackson there is n0\'1 a fundamental law. There 18 an additional relevance to that observation.

Mr. Safron essentially says tllat the judicial system of

the state 18 at stake.

To the extent that it 18 separate

because of this observation respecting juries, it see~s to me,
therefore, "e cannot argue against deferments in this instance
on the basis of preserving a system which already has a fatal
flaw in it and will require some ir~mediate revision.
QUESTION:

Is it possible that one response to the

Fourth Circuit holding, if it stands, would be for all or the
sentences 1n the First Court -- now the Dis~rict Court -- to be
the 1118.Jdmum?
MR, VAN AI.8TYNE:

It 1s possible,

Mr.

Chief Justice,

Respectfully, that argument was presented by counsel for the
State of North carolina in Pearce, itself,

The same specula-

t1on was made that if this court were to accept theargument at
that time, a pernicious reaction might set !n among Superior
Court judges always in the first instance to place the maximum
sentence upon the accused.
It 1s my opinion, therefore, that that argument,
having been made previously and the court not entertaining
quite so negative an attitude toward the Superior Court judges
and observing also that if they were to do so, if anything, it

38
would then merely accelerate and prompt further appeals in ever:,

instance under such a regime,
QUESTION: '\Vhat 1s the remedy that Pearce preacr1bes
for the enhanced sentence on the second time around?

rm.

VAN ALSTYNE:

7-'he remedy

1s to

per~it th~ enhance-

ment of sentence only by a mode which makes practical then
subsequent judicial reviews.
QUESTION:

When they find the sentence which is not

merited under Pearce, what is the remedy?
MR. VAN AI8'l'YNE:

I beg your pardon.

I misunderstood,

The appropriate remedy, I take it, would be to enter a contingent order of habius, 1f that's the way the case comes up.
Specifically, that the state must correct the record and reduce
the sentence.

It does not require the obliteration of the find-

ing of conviction.

I agree with that, and to that extent I think that
there was a clerical error by the Fourth Circuit.

The correc-

tl.on to be made 1s to correct the record respecting the
intensity of sentence.
QUESTION:
Mr.

van Alstyne.

Do

It didn •t read like a clerical error to me,
you think it is just an oversight?

MR. VAN AI8TYNE:

Respectfully, Mr. Chief' Justice, I

earnestly do. Nothing in the argument presented below• nothing
in the f'abric of Pearce, suggests that the conviction subsequently secured pursuant to a fair trial

1s

oblitemted or that

39

all go i'ree.
It 1s, rather, that the excess of service attributable
to the Constitutionally improper harsher sentence must be
relieved.

To the extent, therefore, that the order was to

expunge the whole conviction rather than to let the public
record show that the sentence 1s merely that originally imposed
1n the General County Court~-

QUESTION: Let me read you the language that led me
d01l1111 the other road.

I am reading from I.he opinion.

"Rice is

not to be held to his conviction, 11 which means the conviction
is set aside.

Is that the remedy prescribed by Pearce?

MR. VAN ALSTYNE:
QUESTION:

It 1s not.

Then this

1s

not a clerical error but a

Judicial error, isn't it?
r,!R. VAN ALSTYNE:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and for

this Court appropriately in the disposition of the case to note
that and call for its correction seems to me eminently appropriate.

There ie nothing in the argument of Pearce or this case

that means to overthrow the conviction, itself.
QUESTION:

Then doean •t the point of the Chief Justice

take us even further dOl'Jll the road?

If you agree that -- as I

think you are quite right in conceding that there 1s nothing
invalid about this conviction, and since he has now served his
sentence the only validity went to the length of the sentence
which he nOIY served,

why

isn •t this case moot?

40
MR. VAN A~TYNE:

In D1Y Judgment, that issue was an

honest issue which was litigated in the Fourth Circuit.

The

Fourth Circuit position was that consistent with this Court's
opinions in Kararas and Sibron and one or its

own

decisions, a

case called Hewett v. North cariolina, the citation of which I
can provide, there were collateral legal consequences
QUESTION:

From the conviction.

MR. VAN A~TYNE:

I beg your pardon.

In the argument

that I presented respecting mootness to the Fourth Circuit,
collateral legal consequences assigned to the record of
sentence that the degree or intensity of sentence might itself
have a tracible collateral legal conseQ.uence.

One of these,

or course, bears upon the possibility of subsequent conviction
for another offense.

That sentence imPosed pursuant to the

subsequent conviction might roreseeably of course even be
harsher than it would otherw1se in light of previous sentences.
That is to say not merely the record of conviction but surely
the degree of sentence, the severity of pun1Sh.~ent.
QUESTION:

The Fourth Circuit apparently

didn't understand 1t or didn't ac~ept your argument, because
they say injurious consequences because or the convictions
might still obtain and you are now conceding that the convictions
were improperly set aside.

MR. VAN AI.5TYNE:
as a concession.

Yes.

Respectfully, I don't mean it

It has never been

my

position that Pearce

41
meant anything other th.an a correction of the sentence. The
mootness issue was not only not raised

by

the state in its

petition, but it is not briefed and it seemed to me unseemly to
try to respond.
Indeed, the state did not contest the viability of
the case below.
QUESTION: You suggest that upon conviction of some
other offense, if he again committed an offense, and the fact
th.at the record would show two years, if that's what it shows,
rather than having the two years expunged, 1t might result on
the subsequent conviction 1n a harsher sentence than otherwise.
MR. VAN ALSTYNE:

second trial as a denial of federal due process in that by
discouragement it impinges upon the giving of an appeal.
QUF.5TION:

there one word in Pearce that says we

were really aiming at the conviction?
MR, VAN AISTYNE:

Nothing,

I can assure you nothing

in my submission or in the briefs submitted to the Fourth

43
Circuit invited that view or the case.

I merely mean to suggest

in the appropriate disposition of the case surely the order can
fittingly be described so as to cure that part or the judgment.
QUF.sTION: So you are assuming here that the convictions are valid.
MR. VAN AI..STYNE:

Indeed.

l'1ay I observe also with

regard to the alleged parade,of horribles that 1s foreseen to
flow from an affirmance of what I now reGard as a perfectly
ordinary decision that at least nine states that have examined
this problem have already set their laws systematically against
harsher sentencing, even in the context of these absolute rights
for appeal of trial de novo, Five of these based it on Pearce,
itself.
The reasoning is identical all the way through.
Indeed, as the Indiana Supreme Court observed this year exactly
w1 th respect to this situation, we fail to see where the de

novo aspect of the trial in criminal court has any bearing upon
the logic of the Pearce case, which is simply that the threat
or possibility of having a greater sentence imposed should not
be a deterrant to the exercise of one's right of appeal.

These

states include Arizona, Indiana, Hawaii, Maryland, New Mexico
by statute and not merely by judicial fiat, Louis1anna since

about 1950 has had a dual trial system but under a construction
of the state•s own Constitution has fore more than a decade
forbidden any harsher sentencing.

The alleged parade or

horribles has simply not materialized.

I cannot know, honestly.

It seems

a sensible guess, respectfully, but I don't have the figures.
Perhaps Mr. Safron does.
QUESTIO?l:

If after the guilty plea 1a arrived at

in the hypothetical case Mr. Justice White suggested, the man
then asserts his right to a trial de novo, is h1s guilty plea
under North Carolina law admissible in evidence against h1m in
the new trial?
MR. VAN AISTYNE:

I w111 appreciate assistance by

counsel of the state because I am not certain.

I am advised by

some local attorneys that 1t is adru1ss1ble but I do not know
that and would willingly stand corrected on the matter.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you this, then:

On a retr3.a l

in Superior Court, 1f the state can produce ~dence of what his
testimony was in the District Court, is that admissible?
MR. VAN AISTYNE:
truly.

I don't know.

I caMot answer

Part of the difficulty is again that there simply 1s no

record or transcript of that first session.
May I, in the few remaining moments
QUESTION:

May I ask 1t this way:

There was a record

in the Superior Court in this case?
MR. VAN ALSTYNE:

Yes, As far as I know, that t1as

never made a part of the record in the case now presented -QUESTION: At least, on the bad check charges there

was a guilty plea as to that, wasn't there?
MR. VAN AISTYNE: Yes ,
QUESTION: Was there a trial of the drunken driver?
MR. VAN AIS'l'YNE:
QUESTION:

Indeed, therl;) was.

Evidence taken?

I-lR. VAN ALSTYNE:

Indeed, there was.

QUESTION: And you don't knOIV lVhether the record
indicates any cross examination based on testimony given in the
other --

rm.

VAN ALSTYNE:

No, I don't know.

It is true Mr.

Rice was represented ill the course of that trial by court
assigned counsel as well, but there is simply no record that
was --

QUESTION: You have no transcript of the Superior
Court.
MR. VAN AISTYNE:

We do not, Your Honor, no, A

question was raised earlier as to the ascertained frequency of
harsher sentencing ill North Carolina in ·chis configuration of
cases.

I have tried to determine that and there are no records

kept of this matter.

Indeed, I think one can understand

readily why. Since the General County Court andnow the District

48
Court makes no record and the state nom1nally treats 1t as
though it were 1ndeed a new ball game, we have nothing to
compare it to work back. This court, ho\/ever, d:1.d rely upon a
relatively informal survey 1n Pearce, itself, that was published
in the Duke Law Journal finding by a sample of the judges and
their records 1n the Pearce profile of cases that harsher
,

sentenc1ng was imposed upon new trial 1n around seventy percent
of all retrials following successful appeal.
Now I am not a practitioner 1n the North Carolina
District Court.

I can merely assure the court that there 1s

widespread interest 1n the bar because it is habicual for
attorneys to advise their clients pursuant to the District
Courtproceeding that unless they are confident of success they
ought not appeal for trial de novo for the frequency of harsher
sentencing is believed to be quite widespread.
But there are no figures available. As I say, I do
not believe that the condition of records makes it possible to
gather that information at all.
Respectfully, then, I want to return to what I regard
as the central issue. The court has established a set of
subconst1tut1onal courts that systematically deny an accused
his fundamental Fourteenth Amendment safeguards.

It does not

give him an opportunity to trade that off against the Superior
Court.

This is not a case of bargain1ng of any kind.

He stood

upon his plea of 1nnosence and he sought recourse through the

49
only mechanism the state allows h1m.
The state essentially then sets up a kind of electric
fence.

If' one 1s brazen enough to press forward with a de-

mand for really rudimentary fair play, he 1s made to talce the
risk of judicially unreviewible and unexplained harsher
sentencing.

That, in essence, is this case.

As I say, the great, majority of state supreme courts,
not federal courts, which have re-examined this system subsequent to Pearce have pronounced it absolutely inadequate and I
can anticipate no parade of horribles.
QUESTION:

Let 1s assume that North Carolina had the

system or trying people in the District Court and having a
finding of guilty or innocence but postponed the sentencing
and then run through an appeal. You could appeal from your
own

conviction.
l•lR. VAN ALSTYNE:

Sentence, respectfully, to be then

determined and imposed by whom at what date?
QUF.<3TION1

Well, they made it two different items.

You could appeal from your conviction or you could appeal from
your sentence.
Now if he did not appeal from h1B conviction within
ten ~s. then he is sentenced 1n the District Court but the
conviction 1s
MR. VAN .AI.STYNE:

If he did not appeal from his

conviction within ten days, sentence would then be imposed .

Do

50
I understand it? And the question is -QUF.STION : And his conviction would no longer be open
to attack,
MR, VAN ALSTYNE: Yes.

I think '.;hat raises at least a

vecy substantial procedural due process question.
QUESTION: At least, you get back to the question you
were talk1ng about earlier.
t<IR.

VAN ALSTYNE: Yes, indeed,

ical is very well taken.

I think the hypothet-

'I'he question forthis court 1s the

extent to which the state may suspend this Sword of Damocles
while placing the accused in a dilemma for a certain critical
period of time, and I would have serious doubts as to whether
that procedure, in the absence of very compelling governmental
interests to be served, which I can •t diucern 1n the hypothetical, its:il.f, should be allowed consistent with due process .
QUESTION:

Would you see a Constitutional question

if it developed on a survey that every judge in every case in
the District Court imposed a maximum sentence and that in a
given percentage, ten or fifteen percent, they later entertained

motions for modification of the sentence and did reduce the
sentence?
MR. VAN ALSTYNE:
QUESTION:

Mr.

Clfl.ef Justice --

Is there a due process question there, too?

MR. VAN ALSTYNE:

I do think so. indeed.

If

firm

figures of that kind would be forthcoming in a given piece of

51
litigation, then it seems to me at least to yield a prima facie
inference of punitive original sentencing which would at least
shift a burden of coming forward with sorne explanation so as to
account for such an odd and peculiar pattern,
QUESTION:

Now is your argument here -- does your

argument go right across the board to the so-called petty and
serious

MR, VAN AI.STYNE:

It need not, of course.

The extent

to which the Fourteenth Amendment nay somehow be abdicated when
the maximum punishment a man may endure may be as light as
ninety days is, of course, an open quest:!.on.
quite frankly to take the position that

110

I am not prepared

aspect of the

Fourteenth Amendment whatever applies, though the penalty
cannot exceed ninety days.

Possibly counsel can, but at least

impartiality of the requirement of fact, for instance, and the
recquisite of a hearJJlg, itself -- these are all hard core
elements of due process and an absolute notion they can all
universally be dispensed with because a roan may be subjected to
no more than nJJlety days loes of freedom strikes me as quite
implausible.
QUESTION:

It

1s

not abdication of the Fourteenth

Amendment. The question 1s: What does the Fourteenth Amendment
require 1n those circumstances?

rm.

VAN AI.STYNE: Yes, of course.

rephrasJJlg of 1t.

That's aproper

I announced the view, I suppose, in tak1ng

52
that position.
QUESTION:

We have given you a little bit of extra

time so we will give you three minutes if you need it, Mr.
Safron.

MR. SAFRON:

Thank you.

I hava the annual report of

the administrative office of courts for the year nineteenseventy and 1n answer to the' question concerning representation
of indigents the report reads:

Concern

has

been expressed as to

the incidents of ind1gency among the defendants in criminal
cases processed by our courts. As to the trial courts, this
data 1s not available.

In

the appellate division, it 1s

available and interesting,
Of the criminal appeals docketed in the Court of
Appeals during calendar year 1968, seventy point three percent
involved indigents.

The figures for 1969 and nineteen-seventy

were seventy-two point two percent and seventy-six point one
percent, respectively.
In

the Supreme Court, seventy-three point one

percent of the criminal appeals docketed in 1968 were brought
by indigents.

During the two succeeding years the percentages

were seventy-one point eight and eighty-one point one percent
respectively.
This data would seem to support the inference already
drawn

by some on the basis of the records on appeal that many

indigents have come to the appellate court for no other

53

apparent reason than that the court is there.
There are some other comments.
QUESTION: That leads to confusion.
t•lR, SAFRON:

No, Your Honor, and I am not reading

further because there are some other comments.
I would like to point out 1n this year we budgeted
one million eight hundred 1:'7enty-two thousand seven hundred
ninety-seven dollars for indigent counsel and I am advised in
discussion yesterday with the administrative director of the
courts that the courts will rm out of money.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, t:'lr. Safron.

Thank you, Mr. van Alstyne.
The case 1s submitted,
(Whereupon, at 2:00 P,M, the case was submitted,)
