MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

against Richardson.
Mr. Gray, I think you may proceed now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF L. PATRICK GRAY, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE SECRETARY OF IiEW
MR. GRAY:

Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it please the Court:
These two cases are here before the Court on cross
appeals which have been consolidated for purposes of argument.
These cases arise from a final judgment, of a
statutory three-judge court in the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia.
The court belov? held that Section 225 of the Social
Security Act was unconstitutional, in that under that Act the
recipient of social security disability insurance was not
afforded the opportunity for an oral hearing prior to suspension.
The court below relied on the decision of this Court
in a recent case, Goldberg v. Kelly, which has since become
rather well-known in this particular field of the law.
Section 225 of the Social Security Act permits the
Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,
on information obtained by him or submitted to him, to suspend
the benefits, the payments to the social security disability

4
insurance recipient pending further investigation»
This particular section of the Social Security Act
has no provision whatsoever for hearing»

It should be noted

also»- Your Honors, that this particular section of the Social
Security Act has been commented on in the floor debates of the
Congress and in the reports of the various committees of the
Congress, and its purpose has been explicitly stated to permit
the Secretary to protect the social security trust funds to
administer the social security disability insurance program in
a practical, efficient, and helpful manner, so as to assist
the maximum number of beneficiaries within the resources
available.
This case first arose when the appellee/crossappellant, one Radie Wright, applied in the Washington, D» C,
District Office for social security benefits,

Mr, Wright had

worked since the age of 14 and had been recently hospitalised;
in October of 1965, to be exact; and his application for
social security disability insurance benefits was filed June
1, 1966,
Q

Excuse me, Mr, Gray,

MR. GRAY;
Q

Yes?

Might I ask, do I understand that the Secretary

has now adopted procedures and required States to adopt
procedures which rather provide most of the requirements of
Goldberg?

5

MR. GRAY;

No, sir; Mr,, Justice Brennan, that’s not

quite the ease here.
Q

All right.

MR. GRAY;

He has adopted procedures suggested by

the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
to a certain extent.
Q

I see.

MR. GRAY;
Q

And I would —But not going as far as —
No, sir.

— were they applicable under Goldberg?

MR. GRAY;

Not going as far as the holding of the

District Court, nor as far as the cross-ar>pellant would like
the Secretary to go.
Q

No, but how do they compare with the reouire-

menfcs in Goldberg on termination of welfare benefits?
MR. GRAY: They would not go as far either, Your Honor,
Q

Where would they —• in what respect would they

go, then?
MR. GRAY:

They would go — let me tell you, perhaps.

Your Honor, right at this point in time what they would do*
The District Court below, as a part of its holding,
stated that the recipient should receive time and notice and an
opportunity to respond.

And the Secretary has gone that far

in his new regulations going out through the social security
disability insurance system to state agencies, that they shall
not recommend suspension until they contact that recipient,

6

give him timely notice, offer him the opportunity to present
his case, which I might *—
Q

Meanwhile continuing the payment of benefits?

MR. GRAYs

Yes.

There would be no suspension

recommendation issued then, sir.
Q

Yes.

MR. GRAY:

I might point out, Mr. Justice Brennan,

as you well know, Your Honor, that at this point in time a
recipient or an applicant can come right in to that District
Office now, at the very first step of intake, with counsel in
tow, and can have that counsel assist him at every step of the
proceeding, right along, right up to the point of —■
Q

I didn’t mean to interrupt you.

Would you

complete?
MR. GRAY:
Q

Yes, sir.

Mr. Gray, just let me follow through with this

point, if X may?

Somewhere along the line will yon tell us

what you think the District Court ordered here that is not
covered by the new regulations?

This ties in to Mr. Justice

Brennan’s question.
MR. GRAY;

I can tell you that right now, Mr. Justice

Blackmun.
Q

All right.

MR. GRAY;

The District Court below felt that, as an

additional step, there might be an occasion on which an informal

7
hearing could be held before an impartial official or hearing
examiner„ and they also went one step further and said that
when the evidence is found to contradict that evidence held by
the Social Security Administration, there might very well be a
formal hearing? and the next step they took was to say that
we8re not going to prejudge this matter, we're going to permit
the Social Security Administration to develop presuspension
procedures, at which time we will then take a look and see if
those procedures meet all the reguirements that we are laving
out here.
And the government's position before you today, Your
Honors, is that we go along with the first part of the Court's
order below, and we believe that -—
Q

And that's notice —

MR. GRAY:
Q

Yes, timely notice.

— and an opportunity to protest.

MR. CRAY? That's right.
Q

And in what form?

MR. GRAY:
Q

But no hearing?

MR. GRAYi
Q

In the form of written submission.

No hearing, Mr. Justice Brennan,

And written submissions, of course, are

considered by whom?
MR. GRAY; They're considered right up the line.
They would become a part of that claimant's file folder.

8

Q

Right.

MR. GRAY; And they would become a part right there
at the State agency and would carry right on up the line, all
the way in to the Federal District Court for review and —
Q

And therefore I gather, unlike what5s required

before termination of welfare benefits, an opportunity for a
hearing before, if not an impartial, at least, more or less
an independent member of the operation.

Here, I guess, he

gets notice and a chance to protest in writing and that's the
end of it, is it?
MR.GRAY:

Well, he gets

in our regulations too

he also gets a second chance at that same State agency level.
If he doesn't come in right away and the State agency still is
of that mind, they notify him again.
Q

Yes.

MR. GRAY: And he's given ten days more.
Q

To do what?

MR. GRAY: To do the same thing, file -Q

That is, to file a written protest.

MR. GRAYs

•—• written submissions.

But the extent

of his relief there, Your Honor, is that —

Q

But, in any event, his case is decided on the

basis of what he submits in writing, without a hearing?
MR. GRAY: That is correct.
Q

Yes.

MR. GRAY % That is correct.

On the basis of what he

submits in writing. Your Honor, and in addition what the State
agency has compiled in the way of evidence from the hospitals,
the physicians, the laboratories, —Q

Yes, but he doesn’t get --

MR. GRAY:

— the vocational rehabilitation people

that have, seen him.
Q

— he gets no opportunity at a hearing to

challenge any of the other materials that have been collected
by the agency?
MR. GRAY:

Let me say that he gets no opportunity.

But, 1 think. Your Honor, — he gets no opportunity in the
legal sense, as we lawyers understand it.
Q

Yes.

MR. GRAY:

But let me say, Your Honor, that the

Social Security Administration, as you well know and this
Court: knows, leans" over backwards to be of help and assistance
to individuals.

And I have not the slightest doubt in my mind,

and I think if Secretary Richardson were standing before this
Court he would say the same thing, if that recipient came into
that State agency down in Virginia, which involved one of these
cases, the cross-appellant Atkins, with his attorney in tow,
that that State agency would permit that recipient and his
attorney to make all the points they wanted to make right there,
and they would build that record, and that record would move

10

right on up the line just as they desired to build it.
But if you're speaking, Your Honor, in terms of the
hearing, as wa understand it, under the due process clause,
with all of the protections that Your Honor specified in the
opinion of the Court which you delivered in Goldberg, no, we
do not acced at all.
Q

Now, may I just bother you with one more

question?
MR. GRAY:
Q

Yas, sir.

And then I'll let you be.

In neither of these cases, where the provisions of
these new regulations provided, even though there were no
regulations, that is, neither of these got the kind

of notice

and the opportunity to file written protests?
MR. GRAY:

Not the kind that we mention, Your Honor,

in our supplemental brief.
•

Q

Yes.

MR. GRAY: But other things were done, which, of course,
are in ray statement of facts that were being made, sir.
Yes?
Q

Let me be sure that I have that clear.

They

would get more now than they did get at the time they were
processed?
MR. GRAYs That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

Under the Secretary*s regulations, —

11

MR. GRAY: That is correct, sir.
Q

*— independent of the District Court?

MR. GRAY;

But the Secretary

I think it must be

stated t Mr. Chief Justice, that the new regulation of the
Secretary, appearing in cur Supplemental Brief, was developed
and published as a result of the — a portion of the opinion
of the three-judge court below, sir.
Mr. Gray, you said that when they submit their

Q

written statement it goes right up through the line?
MR. GRAY;
Q

Yes, sir, it becomes a part of

Is that the same line it went up before?

MR. GRAY:

It becomes a part of the claimant’s

folder, and it goes —
Q

Well, I mean there’s no difference in what

happened before, except you’ve got this one statement from the
claimant?
MR. GRAY: That is correct, Mr. Justice Marshall.
It goes from —
Q

And the claimant doesn't know what happens at

any one of those steps?
MR. GRAY:

I don't think that that statement can be

made, Mr. Justice Marshall, because in these types of cases,
unlike other cases, the claimant neither goes to work, his
work activity, he holds in his hands the control, his work
activity generates the activity ~~

Q

If he's able?

MR. GRAY:

MR. GRAY;

blinded, Your Honor.
Q

Or if he's ~

Yes, sir.

Or in the improvement in his

So we don't have a claimant here who is
We have a claimant here who really knows.

But does he know what this person said about

him?
MR. GRAY:

I don't think he would know what this

person said about him, no.
Q

Or any other person?

MR. GRAY;

Mo, sir.

He would know what his own

physician said about him, certainly.
Q

But he never finds out what's in that document

that "goes up the line"?
MR. GRAY:

I would say that you're correct, Mr.

Justice Marshall, in that he does not look at it; but what I
said before in response to a question of Mr. Justice Brennan,
and 1 think that if Secretary Richardson were here he'd say
it, that if that claimant walked into that State agency with
his attorney, he’d get it.
Q

I agree with you fully, but neither you nor

Secretary Richardson are in all these offices.
MR. GRAY;
operates.

I know, but that's the basis on which it

13
Q

These are ordinary peoplein these,,

MR. GRAY; That's right, they're human beings, they’re
very interested in the fairness and integrity of the system.
Q

I assume that, too.

And I also assume that a

fair judge and a fair jury will do well; but we still have the
hearing„
MR. GRAY;

Oh, I know.

In some cases you do for

certain reasons, which do not exist in these cases, Your Honor.
Q

Well, why can't you give a hearing in these?

MR. GRAY: We feel that there is no compelling
individual, private reason to hold a hearing here that is so
great that it necessarily must override, in our system of
jurisprudence, a governmental function representing the
interests of so many people that are at stake in the
administration of this program.
Q

Mr. Gray, are you finding comfort in the Joppa

case of last term and the other one -— was it Perales?
MR. GRAY:

Perales.

I find comfort in both cases.

In Perales because of the opinion and the extent to which that
opinion went; and in the Court's holding there.

In Joppa the

Court, as you know, Mr. Justice Blackmun, did not reach the
constitutional question raised in that unemployment compensation
case on the West Coast.

I feel, of course, that that lower

court was in error and I think there's a case now in New York,
Torres and Danger v. Mew York State Labor Department,

where a

contrary result was reached in the Joppa .cage»
Q

Well, actually, the Secretary's position isn't

very different than it was in Perales .
are being mades
and the like.

Your same arguments

the volume of claims, and practical necessity
Are they not?

MR. GRAY:

1 think that that certainly is true. And

we might go even a little further than we went in Perales in
trying to explain in a little greater detail the procedures
that are involved here.

Because we feel that these procedures

are the matrix on which the government's case rests.
These are the things that this Court must look at
first to see whether the constitutional rights of these
individuals, who are to benefit from this system enacted by
the Congress, are being infringed upon.

And we rather

vigorously contend in our brief that they are not, that the
governmental function must prevail.

We don't argue that the ;

public necessarily is so sacred, we say more than the
conservation is involved here; it's rather the allocation of
these resources.
Shall these resources be allocated to assist others
who are in need to the maximum extent, or shall they be tied
up in a vast bureaucracy for which there is no real constitu­
tional need in these types of cases.
This case, these facts are not a Goldberg context
at all; 1 don't see that context here.

15
May I proceed, Mr. Chief Justice, with Mr. Wright?
Mr. Wright went in and made this application, and at
the time he made the application he completed Item 21 of the
application, and he also received the standard information
which every applicant receives, that if he goes hack to work
he should report that? if his physical condition improves he
should report that; if he applies for workmen's compensation
he should report that.
His application was completed.

The District Office

referred it to the State agency, which is the Department of
Vocational Rehabilitation here in the District of Columbia.
All the papers, including his records from Freedmen's Hospital
and from the Veterans Administration, all were examined, and
a decision was made that Mr. Wright was indeed disabled within
the meaning of the terms of the Act.
His illness, in point of fact, was rather severe at
the time, following his hospitalization for hemorrhaging, and
it stemmed all around cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension,
chronic gastritis? and, in fact, the Social Security
Administration, their 13DI, Bureau of Disability Insurance,
deemed his physical condition to be so severe that he was
not routinely programmed ahead for a review, as they do
regularly in order, once again, to keep track of all these
applicants.
Time passed.

This was in 1966, and he began receiving

IS
payments from May 1.
began to feel better.

Time passed, and Mr» Wright apparently
Because in 1970, earnings began to show

up in the Bureau of Disability Insurance for Mr. Wright.
Nowi how did they show up?
The employers, in reporting these earnings, report
them to, of course, the Internal Revenue Service, which in turn
reports them over to the Social Security Administration for
posting to the social security account, and those folks know who
is receiving social security disability insurance, and there
is a transfer, a cross-indexing.
So that a recipient of social security disability
insurance, working and receiving earnings,

have wage

postings on his account? and this occurs within the Social
Security Administration.
When BDI learned of earnings for Mr. Wright, earnings
for the June quarter of 1968 to the December quarter of 1968,
and for the first quarter of 1969, they immediately caused a
field investigation to be instituted, and that referral was
made to the Social Security District Office in the District
of Columbia.
An interviewer went to call upon Mr. Wright.

The

interview was lass than satisfactory, Mr. Wright was a little
difficult to communicate with, but he did indicate that he had
worked„

The young lady who interviewed him stated to him that

indeed it looked as though his social security disability

17
insurance benefits might be in jeopardy because of his having
worked.

That, of course, is one of the provisions of the

Social Security Act, one of the definitions of disability:
if an individual is able to engage in substantial gainful
activity, he cannot be disabled under the Act.
Well, the investigation proceeded, and, as it turned
out, Mr. Wright had indeed apparently felt better, because he
worked — he not only worked in the June 568 quarter, the
December e60 quarter, but he worked in every quarter of the
calendar year 1969, and he earned approximately $626 and some
cents in 1960, and $4,041 and some cents in 1969.
Now, when all this verification went through, and
the District

Mr. Justice Stewart, the time lag here

was a little long because normally it’s nine months,

MR, GRAY: Before it gets to BDI, and before BDI
triggers off the field investigation.
Q

Nine months from what?

Nine months from the

reporting time —
MR. GRAY;

From the reporting time of the employer,

xe
yes , sir.,
Q

— by the employer to the Commission?

MR. GR2\Ys

The employer has to report earnings

to the Internal Revenue Service,, and -Q

To the Commission, the GXR.

MR. GRAY:
Q

— it was a little -—

There's a nine months lag.

MR. GRAYs

It was a little longer in this case,

because EDI instituted their field investigation in February,
February 2nd, 1970.
But, in any event, when that was compiled, BDI
sent the report back to the District of Columbia Department
of Vocational Rehabilitation for a further look at this case,
even though, here it was obvious that the man had worked, was
in violation; no longer disabled, no longer entitled under the
law.

But the case folder went back and an additional looksee

was taken, and the District Office concluded that Mr. Wright
had indeed engaged in substantial gainful activity and was
no longer therefore entitled to social security disability
benefits,
He x^as so notified, and the letter of notification
indicated that his trial work period had completed.

Here's

another distinguishing feature from the welfare recipient,
the social security disability recipient may work for a period
of nine months, none of which need be consecutivey but the law

19
the Congress has seen fit , and the Secretary in his implementing
regulations has seen fit to permit this recipient to go back
and try to rehabilitate himself, try to get back into the
mainstream of society, so to speak»
Mr» Wright had indeed utilized more than his ninemonth trial work period, and he was determined to have ceased
to be disabled as of August of 1969, and his benefits, he
was advised that his benefits were going to be suspended.
And they 'were indeed suspended for a short period of time.
Q

Is this by computer?

MR. GRAY: Sir?
Q

Was this information from a computer?

MR. GRAY:

X must presume it is, because, based on

my own knowledge, Mr. Justice Marshall, from having been in
HEW, that knowing that SSA is heavily computerized, that's the
only way they could handlfe the workload that they handle.

And

I must assume that that is correct.
Q

Then you said a young lady went and talked to

him.
MR. GRAY: That's at the District Office level, Mr.
Justice Marshall.
Q

What else, what other reliable information do

you have, other than the computer —
MR. GRAY:

Oh, we don't rely on the computer at all,

it would be folly to do that, Mr. Justice Marshall.

Verifica-

20

tion is made of these wages paid by direct contact with the
reporting employer? no reliance is placed on that computer for
that kind of verification,
Q

The computer just triggers the further inquiry,

is that it?
MR. GRAY;

That's right.

That's the microswitch,

Mr. Chief Justice, that begins this whole procedure, starts it
all going.
Q

There's no dispute about the fact of the earnings,

is there, in the case?
MR. GRAY:

No, sir.

In any event, Mr. Wright brought suit, and he was
without benefits for a short period of time.

He brought suit

on May 13, 1970; on May 14, 1970, Judge Gasch issued a temporary
restraining order restraining the Secretary from suspending
Mr. Wright's benefits.

And that action was taken, and Mr.

Wright has been paid the benefits since then.
And then Mr. John D„ Atkins, plaintiff-infcervanor,
enters this case.

He doesn't corae into the case until about

August, but he comes in as a plaintiff-intervenor on the basis
that he had been hospitalised by reason of mental illness, and
he was hospitalised over in the Veterans Administration Hospital
at Perry Point, Maryland.

And he was hospitalised in December

of 1956, and began receiving benefits some six months
thereafter and remained in that hospital over there until

21
January ? of 1969«
The Social Security Administration, for soma reason
or another, did not find mat that Mr. Atkins was no longer
in Perry Point until about September of 1969, when hia check
was returned from Perry Point V.A. Hospital to the Social
Security Administration, to SDI.
Apparently Perry Point had been forwarding his checks
to Mr. Atkins, because Mr. Atkins had left the V. A. Hospital al
Perry Point, Maryland, and had gone over to Virginia to another
hospital, mental hospital, Western Hospital at Salem, Virginia?
stayed there a 'short period of time, then went down to the
Veterans Administration Hospital at Roanoke.
But when Social Security received the notice —
received the check back, that immediately triggered off, in
accordance with its procedures, a continuing disability
investigation.

And they had to find out what Mr. Atkins was

up to.
So the claim folder went first to Towson, Maryland,
and then it went, down to Virginia; but, suffice it to say, the
case finally became'one before the State agency there in
Virginia.

The State agency want through the same routine:

they contacted Mr. Atkins, talked with his clinical psychologist
looked very, vary carefully at the medical evidence then
available to them: and made a decision that Mr. Atkins*
condition had physically improved sufficiently so that he was

no longer disabled.
Mr. Atkins -** this occurred on February 3rd, .1970,
On February 4, 1970, Mr, Atkins wrote the Social Security
Administration and protested, submitted his own evidence, hie
wife called EDI three or four times.

His Congressman got in

touch with Social Security Administration,

And, to compress

the facts, in view of the fact that time is rapidly running
out on me. Your Honor, he was reinstated.

His case was sent

back rather quickly.
Another hard look was taken at additional evidence,
and he was reinstated.
And I think, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like
to reserve the balance of my time for any rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Very well, Mr. Gray.
Mr. Sayler.

;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. SAYLER, ESQ, ,
OR BEHALF OF WRIGHT, ET AL.
MR. SAYLER:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I am here representing several named individuals in
the class of disability recipients.
The government's presentation has made clear we're
dealing here with a complicated statutory scheme.

That

should not obscure the fact that the legal issues in this case
are uncomplicated.

They've been considerably narrowed in this

23

When this case began nearly two years ago» the
government was arguing that the provision in the statute
authorising summary suspension of disability payments was
constitutional.

Judges Gash» Robb, and Matthews disagreed;

and the government has abandoned that contention in this Court.
It concedes that that statutory section is unconstitutional» and
it concedes that there is a right to an opportunity to a hearing
before disability benefits are terminated.
Mow, these are the propositions that we have been
attempting to establish in this case, and we had assumed that
ones they were recognised that would obviate the necessity for
action by this Court.

But that has not proved to he the case.

Because, in this Court, the government contends that the right
to a hearing it would provide means a paper hearing, called a
hearing on paper.
By this, the government says, it would provide
notice? if it found conflicting evidence, it would mrovide a
oriel' summary of evidence adverse to the recipient? it would
provide an opportunity to file a piece of paper.
It would not, under any circumstances, regardless
of whether or not conflicting evidence of continuing disability
existed, it would not provide opportunity for an oral proceeding
of any kind; it would not assure a decision by an impartial
decision-maker.

The. government’s basic position is that these latter
procedural protections are unnecessary, because the decisions
in this area, uniquely objective and reliable, as Mr. Gray jus-!
said, the government bands over backwards to assure the
recipients may stay on the rolls.
There is one overwhelming statistic which demonstrates
the difficulty the government has in sustaining that position.
At the present time, hearings' are required as a matter of
»

statutory right after termination, many months down the road.
In those cases, paper determinations that disability has
ceased are reversed in 55 percent of the cases.
More times than not, when the recipient gets to the
hearing, has an opportunity to tell his story, to present
affirmative evidence, cross-examination prevails —
C*

Is that post-termination proceeding somewhat

like the post-termination proceeding in welfare cases'?
MR. SAYLER:
Q

Yes, that's right, Your Honor.

Do they then get back payments, retroactively?

MR. SAYLER: That is right, Your Honor.
The statute requires that.

The problem, of course,

is that during the many months —
Q

You say it’s way down the road; how long?

MR. SAYLERs

The statistics are in the record,

soar 'Maere between four and six months; different statistics
have been supplied from one time to another, and they are all

A considerable period is consumed while the recipient
is cut off from payment.

Once he gets to that hearing, more

Well, I gather, —

— he prevails.

Well, X don * t know what it may have been at the

time this case was brought? but I gather, under the new
procedures, until the so-called paper hearing procedure has
been completed, the recipient will continue to get his
disabi 1 ity benefi.ts?
MS. SAYLER:

That is my understanding, on the basis

Then they *d be terminated, and then the post­

termination proceedings would take how long?

Six months or

more?
MR. SAYLER:

Some have been three or four months

beyond the paper hearing.
Q

And after that interval, after the initial

termination or suspension, whatever label is put upon it,

ha gets no disability benefits unless they're reinstated at
the post-termination hearing?
MR. SAYLER:

That's right.

And then if he does get them reinstated, they

are retroactive, are they, to the date of suspension or whatever

26
it was?
MR., SAYLSR:
the welfare area.

That’s right*

Just as was the case in

Precisely the same.

We think that that 55 percent statistic is more
eloquent than pages of testimony, to demonstrate the importance
of the protections we seek, and the inadequacy of the procedures
that are now followed or that would be followed under the
protections the government has now undertaken to provide.
Q

And 1 gather your position is.that nothing short

of the Goldberg procedures would satisfy the constitutional
question? is that it?
MR. SAYLERs

Your Honor, we take from Goldberg the

language that the Court in that case was undertaking to
prescribe the minimum, what it called the rudimentary due
process„ and we are —
Q

Yes, but do you think anything more than that is

required in this situation?
MR.SAYLERs

Your Honor, we are seeking only those

rudimentary protections provided in the Goldberg decision.
Q

Mr. Sayler, I noticed in the government’s

brief they relied rather heavily on Cafeteria Workers vs.
beElroy, and you, in your reply to thorn, treated that case
in a footnote as if it were virtually limited to its facts?
at least that's one impression one could get from your treat­
ment of it,.

Do you disagree with the general statements of

27
the Court in McElroy that due process is a flexible concept and
WIKVRIMIWIOH*.»

*

you have to analyze precisely what it is that you * re effecting
before you decide what procedures will be accorded?
MR. SAYLER:

Not at ally Mr. Justice Sehnquist.

Our basic proposition is that Cafeteria establishes basic
propositions , which have been set forth in a number of other
cases, that the Court is obliged to indulge in a balancing
of the interests of government- on the one side and the persons
affected by governmental interest on the other side.
We think this is the case where the balance must be
struck very ranch on the side of the recipients.

In view of

the pressing need of disability payments, we have indicated
the statistics in our brief on this point.
The facts are that disability recipients are over
half dependent on disability benefits fox- their income.
of there arc over 80 percent dependent.

Most

As a category, the

disability recipients have a very low level of educational
attainmentv which very much hampers thair prospects to gain
substantial income once they are terminated from the disability
roils»
Their work experience, even those who are able to
work f is not very bright.

Labor experience is characterized

by an extremely high unemployment? characterised by mostly
part-time work.
Cur point is that the prospect of a man who is cut

28
off from the disability program c a man who must 'qualify in the
first instance..fader the most ri gid definition of disability,
that is not a man who is in any sense a potential Olympic
This is a roan who needs those moneys, and that's

champion.

why Congress has provided them to him.

He needs them in the

same sense that the welfare recipient needed those moneys in
the Goldberg; situation.
Q

S suppose the balancing factor would fit under

what you just referred to in the Cafeteria Workers case„
V-

would be the amounts that are paid out in disability payments
to people for periods after they had become ineligible.

Does

the record show anything about the dollar amounts/ either
estimates or accurate figures on that?
ME. SAYLERj

Yes. The average, recipient receives,

according to government figures, something along the lines’ of
$200 a month.
How, the government has undertaken an estimate of
what it would cost to give hearings, an opportunity for a
hearing, satisfying the Goldberg standards.

And it has

determined that it would cost something in the neighborhood of
$16 million.
Now, the problem, with that estimate, Your Honor,
is that it assumes that every person who is terminated, in an
effort to gain unwarranted payments, would demand a hearing,
duel the experience under Goldberg, in the welfare context, does

29
not boar that out at all.

Less than 10 percent in the District

of Columbia of persons who are cut off from welfare are now
«©Handing a hearing.
The government also assumes that the government would
prevail in every one of these hearings.

Every one of them,

And that there would therefore be proper payments in every
case.

The fact, again, is that it's losing more of these cases

than it9s winning.
We’ve recomputed those figures on the basis of the
government statistics, and the cost would be considerably less
than $1 million, even assuming twice as many recipients sought
a hearing as now seek a post-termination hearing.

Even

assuming that the government had no power to collect any over­
payments it might make, and it has substantial statutory
povrer to collect overpayments in the disability context, unlike
•the welfare content where the government has no power to collect
overpayments t and even assuming that this hearing would require
a full two months over and above the paper hearing that the
government has now —*
Q

You estimate a million dollars for the whole

United States, for the personnel necessary, the expense
necessary to do this?
MR. SAYLER: We have computed this on the basis, Your
Honor, that the government has computed it, on the basis of
payments that would be made to recipients in the interim, as

30
distinguished front undertaking any computation,
Q

But I was thinking of the geographical area.

Is that for the District of Columbia or the whole United
States?
MR. SAYLERs

No, that figure I have just given you

is for the entire country. There are some 37,000 cessations a
year in this area, and something in the neighborhood of 4,000
recipients have been seeking hearings.
I've computed that on the basis of the entire
country,
What I have not undertaken is
Q

Your assumption is that you could have the

machinery for 4,000 cases, that could be handled for a million
dollars?
MR. SAYLER:

It would be considerably less than a

million dollars, and what I want to make clear is that we have
not undertaken to compute the cost to the government of
operating this machine/.

We're trying to figure out how much

money would be expended in making the payments, which might
be determined after the hearing —0

You're talking about administrative expenses?

MR. SAYLER; That's right.
Q

So X was --

MR. SAYLER;

The government did not undertake that

31

Q

Oh, I see,

I was thinking of the figure that’s

in a footnote, I think in the Goldberg case, or the parallel
Mew York case, that in Los Angeles County alone there are
12,909 employees who service the welfare recipients, and
therefore your raillion-dollar figure wouldn’t go very far
to paying —
MR. SAYLER: That’s right,
Q

— those employees, would it?

MR. SAYLER:

I’m sorry, Mr. Chief Justice,

The

point that that illustrates is that the welfare program, where
prior hearings were held required, $ .Swarfs the size of the
disability program, both in numbers of recipients and in
numbers of cessations.
Q

While I have you interrupted, Mr. Sayler, 1

suppose you’d agree that in some respects this program is
analogous to a private insurance contract for disability
insurance, the standards, I suspect, are very much the same,
total and permanent disability? and in general there is an
analogy there.

Would you agree?

MR. SAYI-ER:

To some extent, Your Honor.

no halfway disability in this program,
cither all in or you’re all out.
Q

There is

It’s all — you’re

There’s no partial disability.

I understand, there’s no partial disability,

MS, SAYLER: And the insurance programs generally have
attempted to use a more objective standard to determine

disability.

They use schedules»

If a person qualifies under

Schedule X, he is or is not disabled.
The government in this program has undertaken a
quite more elaborate scheme.

This program is to be based on

the individual facts of each individual case, as the
regulations made clear.
Q

What happens to a policyholder on either life

insurance or accident insurance that receives a total and
permanent disability from, let us say, the Aetna or one of the
other large companies, and they discover that he is working
full time and making 5, 6, S thousand dollars a year? what
do they do to his payments, ordinarily?
MR. SAILER?
Q

In the event they determine what?

That ha’s earning a lot of money, that he's no

longer totally and permanently disabled.

They terminate him,

don't they?
MR. SAYLERs Well, I take it that would be a factor
that the insurance company would take into account, and would
undertake an inquiry.
0

Well, they'd write him a letter and tell him

his payments are being stopped, wouldn’t they?
MR. SAYLER:

One 'would hope that an insurance company

would do more than that, and would undertake an incretiry to
determine tha facts.
Q

Well, I'm assuming that they found these circum-

stances of his earnings by an inquiry, and perhaps sent
investigators out to watch him leave in the morning, and in a
very large case, you've probably Known of t&em, they'd take
moving picture: of him, the man playing golf, or whatever it
may be.

lsm sure you don't have any welfare recipients doing

that that you — this is the technique that an insurance
company employs, and then they send him a letter and stop the
payments ? don? t they?
MS. SAYLER:

Your Honor, I'm trying to make two

points in response to that.
One is that the insurance disability programs usually
use a considerably more objective standard of disability than
federal programs.
The other is that one would assume that an insurance
company would apply its standards fairly, and if its standards
required, as the federal regulations do in. the disability
area, that a thorough inquiry into all the facts ha made, that
a determination not be based on ariy easy litmus test? a
determination not be based solely on earnings, which the
regulations say; not be based solely on a doctor's report,
which the regulations say.
0

But an insurance company —

Well, that sounds to me, Mr. Sayler, like really

a question of law you have here, rather than a factual question
requiring a hearing.
MR. SAYLER;

I'm not sure I understand the question.

34
The question of whether the disability is —
Q

Well, the government automatically terminates

— well, it automatically terminates when it verifies earnings
of a certain amount?
I4R. SAYLER:

In some of the cases , Your Honor.

More

of the cases are so-called medical cessations, where they have
a doctor4s report.
Q

Well, in Mr. Wright’s case it was an earnings

case?
MR. SAYLER % An earnings case, yes.
Q

And you’re saying that the government may not

terminate just upon verification of earnings?
MR. SAYLER: That's right, Your Honor.
Q

And is that a question of law or ia it a factual

matter for a hearing?
MR. SAYLERs
of fact.

Ho, the regulations make that a question

They say that the mere fact that a recipient has

earned money is not the end of the inquiry, but the beginning
of it.

He has an opportunity to show how he performed, whether

he was able to continue; and in Mr. Wright's case, he was not.
He undertook to work and he could not continue.

He had to stop.

The regulations say that's the kind of inquiry that
should bo undertaken, and that’s the kind of inquiry that is
undertaken at the end of the road, in the post-terrain at ion
hearings now required as a matter of statutory lav;.

35
Well- I take it that there was

Q

personal

interview with Mr. Wright,, end he verified the P his earnings
that he had had?

MR. SAYLER: That's right.
Q

And — but, nevertheless, claimed that he was

still disabled?
MR. SAYLER; That's right.

And he undertook a hearing.

He asked for a hearing

at. that point.
Q

Yes.

But he had an opportunity to say anything

he wanted to at that time?
MR. SAYLER;
Q

Well, —

Either personally in the interview, or in

writing afterwards?
MR. SAYLER; That's right.
Q

He could have —

Ke could have revealed any of the circumstances

which would indicate that despite his earnings he was still
disabled?
MR. SAYLER;
provided in Goldbergs

Yes. But he would not have protections

tell his story.

Well, he had an interview.

And ths government says in its brief that he

is not qualified to make judgments of medical disability.
C?

Well, he could have told him anything he wanted

to, though? MR.SAYLERs
Mr. Justice White.

That is right.

I'm not disputing that,

What. 1 am saying is that the questions

that arise in this context are inherently complicated and
subjective.

That’s what the legislative history says, that’s

what the regulations say.

The 55 percent reversal rate, which

arises only on the basis of terminations on the basis of either
medical evidence or employer’s report is eloquent testimony
that these are tough fact questions.
Indeed, in 3* respects they're the identical fact
questions that arise in the welfare context, because this Court
has required prior hearings under welfare disability programs
for these very precise same issues, as are raised in these

cases,
We say that Goldberg rules this case.

The same kind

of top complex fact issue, the same kind of pressing interest
and receiving benefits? no basis in the Social Security Act
which governs both disability and welfare to distinguish Goldberg
in

C.h.1G C6.£6 >

la fact the government has recognized the eloss
connection between the two.

It argued in its brief in the

37
Goldberg cv.se to this Court that it would be inconsistent to
provide hearings in the welfare context and not. in the dis­
ability content*

It went on to say the disability case was

the a fortiori case, because the disability recipient,as a
mandatory condition of his entitlement, must have contributed
substantial funds for a protracted period, the precise fund
from which he proposes to draw his benefits.
It*s not true in the welfare context.
As this Court said in Flemming v, Nestor, in that
sense social security benefits are earned, a functioning
member of the economy ought to be able to draw upon that
economy when the protected against event takes place.
We think it would be intolerable to distinguish the
disability case and the welfare case.

That would create the

anomalous result that the man who has contributed his money
over the years, and worked, would have fewer procedural
prtections than the welfare recipient who is not required to
contribute to a fund.
Q

How would you analogiae that to a man who has

bought and paid for an insurance policy, private policy —
MR. SAYLER:
Q

Well, I think there's -—

do you think the Aetna Insurance Company, for

example, must give notice before they terminate payments, and
a hearing, as a matter of due process?

Now, I srn not talking

about what they do, what their practices are, what their

38
contract provides. What would be the constitutional obligation
in a private insurance for disability?
MR. SAYLER;
Q

Well, I think —

Would it be the same as this?

MR. SAYLER: Well, I would say the answer comes out
the same way.

If one buys a permanent disability protection

policy, which I happen to have now, I paid my money for five
years?.if I become disabled tomorrow, I am entitled, as a
matter of contract, to all of it.

That’s benefits.

I’ve

paid ray money, I’ve earned it.
They cannot turn around and say, "Oh, no, we. don’t
think wcshould be paying this money."
Q

But you don’t have a right to insist to the

insurance company that they grant you a hearing.

If you don’t

like what the insurance company does, you go to court, I think.

Go to court and try to enforce my

That’s the point. I was trying fco make

is that ;Lt#s an awfully important distinction»

But the analogy

bet aen insurance and a disability recipient’s right to claim
benefits when the protected-against event transpires is a
very close one.
One other reason we think it would be intolerable to
distinguish Goldberg in this case is that the upshot would be
that the States which administer the welfare programs would
be held to a higher procedural due process requirement under
the Federal Constitution than would the Federal Government
which administers the social security program.
I want to say one final word about the relief we
seek in this Court.
thingss

I think the Court can either do two

It could remand to the lower court to enjoin further

terminations without affording the preliminary hearings
satisfying Goibarg v. Kelly standards.
/

The character of the government’s argument has
suggested an alternative approach.

The government now does

concede the unconstitutionality of the exception in the Act,
which permits summary termination.

Now, admitting the

unconstitufcionality of that provision leaves extant and standing
only the general requirement in the Act that, an oral hearing
must precede final agency action.

That’s set forth in Sections

605 sad 421: Section 1303 of the Act is the severability

provision, which says if one provision is declared
unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains standing.
What this would mean would be that the general
requirement would obtain, oral hearings which are now
statutorily required, as a matter of statutory construction,
would have to be held before disability benefits could be
terminated»
This in effect gives the matter back to Congress,
And it says the summary suspension that you have undertaken
'will not satisfy the recent teachings of this Court,

We decla.r

that section unconstitutional.
Congress at that point either leaves the existing
oral hearings as they are, can order them speeded up; Congress.,
on the other hand, may decide that it doss want to have some
sort of a preliminary determination before the full-scale
hearing, and it may decide that it wants to institute a
Goldberg v, Kelly type oral hearing, which meets just the
rudimentary requirements of due process.
This, we think, should more- appropriately be
determined by the Congress rather- than the government in a
brief, which has undertaken, in the 13th hour in this case,
to rewrite a summary suspension provision into the Act of
Congress.
The essence of our case is that, as the Court said
in Perales, the social security system must be fair.

We don’t

4.1
think the procedures which fall short of the Goldberg y.;. Kelly
standards can be said to be fair.
We would urge this Court to make it clear that those
standards obtain in this area, as well as in ether areas.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs Thank you, Mr. Sayler.
Mr. Gray, you have three minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF L. PATRICK GRAY, III, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF SECRETARY OF HEW
MR. GRAY; Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
May it please the Court:
I would like just to make a brief comment regarding
Mr. Sayler"s statement concerning reversal rates.
Appendix B in the government's brief contains
statistics for the fiscal year 1971, and much can be done with
figures, as W all know”. And I think the only fair way to
h-.mC.le this particular matter of the reversal rate and the
play on numbers is to take the actual number of claims that
are processed and then trace those through and find the
reversals.
And that brings you to a 6.6 percent rate of reversal.
That speaks something for this system.

At least a sufficient

number of individuals somewhere throughout this total number
of claims who do not feel that the system has dealt with them
unfairly.

And 1 would merely submit to the Court that this
kind of a consideration be given to dealing with statistics»

I would like also to point out once again and
reaffirm the fact that the government has not conceded anything,
This is not summary decapitation that we are engaged in here,
and we have never considered it to be, and we have not conceded
any point of constitutionality, and we stand by firmly the
points made in our brief to this Honorable Court.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Gray.

Thank you, Mr. Sayler.
The case is submitted.
