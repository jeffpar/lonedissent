MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

now in A-483, Committee for Nuclear Responsibility against
Schlesinger.
Mr. Sive, you may proceed whenever you0re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID SIVE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SIVE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
2 am David Sive, on behalf of the applicants for
the injunction.
The time assigned to me was, I believe, 30 minutes,
but I would like to at this time ask tint approximately eight
minutes of that be held for rebuttal.

And. thus I will

confine myself to 22 minutes.
This action arises primarily under the National
Environmental Policy Act.

Actually the action, the complaint

sets forth four claims s
One under other statutes? one under the Fifth and
Ninth Amendments to the Federal Constitution? and one under
the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
However, because of the urgency and the simple
squeeze of time that was with us throughout the action, to
some of the details of which 2 will refer, we were only able
really to dig into, to the extent we could, the principal

4
first claim arising under the National Environmental Policy
Act, which X will hereafter refer to as NEPA»
Q

Mr. Sive, if X might ask, have you filed a

petition for cert?
MR. SIVE:
Q

Not as yet, Your Honor, no.

But you plan to?

MR. SIVE:

We can file one tomorrow night, and we

stated in the application we could file on® on Monday, if
need be we'll file it tomorrow morning? and work through the
night.
Q

Are you raising all the questions that you're

about to address to us?
MR, SXVEs

The questions which I think we're forced

to limit ourselves to are those claims under NEPA.

At

least we will argue those essentially, and not make any —
Q

You’re not going to raise the Fifth and Ninth

Amendment claims, then, are you?
MR. SIVE:

I think there is just not time to

properly brief that at this point, Your Honor.
The applicability of NEPA is unquestioned. And this
is important, because X think at the heart of the problem,
perhaps the unusual and the unprecedented problem before us
is the question of the law governing the acts of the
defendants, the Atomic Energy Commission, and whether that
lav? does govern, on this day and on this very hour,

s
approximately tea hours before the act, to enjoin which was
the purpose, of the lawsuit*
And -there is no doubt about the applicability of
NEPA* from the ■very first, and it became law on January X,
1970»

As soon as it became I aw* the Commission acknowledged

that, and,as is stated in the application,

began preparing

draft impact statements, issued a draft in June of 970, and
the final impact statement on June 21st of 1971*
Q

Mr» Sire.

MR., SZVEs
Q

Yea?

We're talking particularly about Section 102?

MR* SIVE:

I am, yes.

In 102(c) and the impact

s tatement provision.
Q

Right»

And you say, as I understand quite

correctly, that its applicability is a matter of common ground
between you and your brothers on the ether side in this case?
MR. SITEs
Q

Absolutely, Your Honor.

That's correct.

But is it conceded that the filing of a

sufficient impact statement, under 102(c), is a condition
precedent to the government proceeding with the planned
operation?
MR. SIVE:
Q

1 think, Your Honor

Its app3.icabil.ity is conceded, but is that

conceded, is that second point conceded?
MR. SIVEs

I think it is, Your Honor.

6
Q

As a condition precedent.

That if, in other

words, in this case, the government should concede that in one
way or another -the impact statement was deficient under the
law, that it would further concede that, your application
for an injunction should be granted?
Do you understand that that, is conceded?
MR, SIVEs

Yes,

Yes, I do, Your Honor, and I can

only answer by saying 1 think it is conceded, because at no
point to date, as far as 1 can recall, has that question ever
been .raised. And the. whole argument and the whole course of
proceeding before is to the sufficiency of the .impact statement,
but if it be not conceded, then I simply refer Your Honors
respectfully to the cases on page 89 of our brief submitted
to the Court of Appeals,
Q

I understand the Court of Appeals stated some

doubts as to the adequacy of the impact statement, but didn't
reach the decision, it just want on to hold that it would bo
interfering with a Presidential function,
MR, SIVE:

1 think that is not quite correct, Your

Honor.
As 1 understand -the Court of Appeals opinion, and
the vital language is on page 3, and the whole opinion is the
last opinion attached to the petition, the court, the District
Court and the Court of Appeals never questioned the impact
of the language of 102, and no question was ever raised by

7
either court that, if the impact- statement were insufficient.
•die detonation was illegal.
Now* the Court of Appeals did address itself to the
question of ‘die Presidential power.

And with respect to that*

I respectfully refer Your Honors to the October 28th opinion.
That opinion was issued the day after the argument on the
second appeal.

That argument was at 2;15 on October 27th.

.And at 12; 15 the respondents,, the Commission* held a press
conference and issued a press release* and stated;

We have

now received, the requisite Presidential authority.
And then.argued before the Court of Appeals that
the President having given that authority* the Court had no
jurisdiction.
The Appeals Court held* consistently with the
arguments we then made* that the validity of the detonation
rested on two conditions;

one* the obedience by the Commission

to NEPAj two* the Presidential approval required an especial
provision of the Appropriations Act* appropriating the basic
budget for the Commission for this fiscal year.
That issue may foe raised again by the Solicitor
General.

There is some indication in their Court of Appeals

brief that they will again argue that -the President having
approved this* -that sweeps NEPA aside.
We believe that is wrong* and the Court of Appeals —
Q

And that Presidential approval followed an action

8
by the Congress on the authorization and appropriation
committees, did it not?
MR. SIVE;
Q

That5s correct, Your Honor.

And the condition was what?

In the authorization

and the appropriations that, the President was to —
MR. SXVE:

Personally approve.

That condition
Q

And that statute followed

MR. SXVE:, HEPA.
And that statute, Your Honor, that appropriation
bill and that particular requirement of personal Presidential
approval, arose as a kind of compromise in a debate*

There was

a very strenuous debate about whether this detonation should
go at all.

Q

Well, whatever may be behind it, the fact is

■the appropriation bill and the authorisation bill as to Cannikin,
in terms of Congressional action, beti'» followed the adoption of
NEPA?
MR. SXVE:
Q

That's correct, Your Honor, yes.

How, may I ask one thing, Mr. Sive;

What

actually is before us --- your application for some kind of
injunctive relief, I take it, is only pending our action, the
Court's action on your petition for certiorari, isn't it?
MR. SXVE; That is correct, Your Honor.
Q

In other words, you can't, I gather — I don't

9
suggest that you can’t

ask us for any kind of permanent

injunction?
MR„ SXVEs
Q

No, Your Honor.

At this juncture.

All that you can get, I gather#

is that we enjoin the detonation pending our action on your
petition for cert?
MR. SXVEs
Q

Precisely correct.

Which could be next week.

You3 re telling us

that it will be filed
MR. SIVE;

We can# Your Honor.

If need be# we’ll

file the petition for cert by noon tomorrow.

My associates

and I are prepared to work through the night# we’ve done that
several times in the last two weeks.
Q

Well# how much of a postponement# then# are you

asking for?
MR. SIVE;

If Your Honors can hear the petition for

beginning Monday morning# is convenient to Your Honors.

We'll

We’ll be back with petition# if

Q

Because# obviously# if we don’t grant the

MR. SIVE:
Q

And you can’t have —
That’s precisely correct# Your Honor.

-“it for

longer than the time if takes us to

10
act on your petition,

of some of the provisions of law

by the respondents is at

And this is spelled out in the

Based upon what i call the conflicting reports?

the reports of the government agencies specifically recommending
against Cannikin? because of the environmental hazards? after
the struggle which is recited in the application? came to us
simultaneously with the denial of the preliminary injunction.
Q

Well? may I ask? do you take any position that

if we don't grant you a stay at least long enough for us to
consider and decide whether we're going to grant your petition
for cert? that the whole case would become moot? is that it?
MR. SIVE;

Yes? Your Honor? that is correct.

There is a possibility

of amending the complaint

to allege a claim? perhaps? under the Freedom of Information
Act? to exposure of some of the documents as to which the
District Court and Appeals Court upheld the

executive

privilege.
It would be a different kind of action? and I would
have to —
Q

Well? I thought you told me earlier that you

are limiting -the questions presented in your petition?

11
MR. SIVE;
Q

— just to NEPA?

MR. SIVEs
Q

That9s correct.

That’s exactly correct, Your Honor.

We*re not concerned with the information.

MR. SIVEs

I think not.

And I think the answer is

the case does become completely moot once the detonation goes.
The whole action is to enjoin that detonation for illegality.
Q

Well, isn’t it the Congress that sets up the

scheme of liability of the government for nuclear accidents
or nuclear detonations?
MR. SIVEs

Yes, the so-called Price-Anderson bill

does provide *—
Q

Does that cover this kind of case?

MR. SIVE;

I don't think so, Your Honor.

1 think that

goes to the merits, perhaps, of the standing of the plaintiffs.
Q

I just mention it, because, if it does, then

if the prospect, of government liability is in the offing, I
don't see how we can say that this litigation would become
.moot.
MR. SIVEs

The answer is, Your Honor, it does not.

All that that does is limit the damages recoverable by an
individual damaged as to his person.
This action is not for pecuniary injury or damage
to property.

It's the public interest, of which our plaintiffs,

we believe, are the responsible representatives, not based on a

12
pecuniary damage.
Q

I understands, but

MR, SITE; Forgive me.
Q

Mr. Sive —

MS. SIVE:
Q

Yes?

X take it that when the appropriation bill was

debated in the Senate, that the impact statement at issue here
was before the Senate in that debate, and some Senators
questioned its adequacy and there was a proposal to forbid the
use of funds for this purpose?
MR. SIVE:
Q
comproxai s e.

And ultimately Senator Pastors proposed a
True ?

MR. SIVE:
Q

That9s correct# Your Honos:.

He proposed a compromise

Which became Section 103 of the Appropriation

bill?
MR. SIVE:

Yes.

However, X think. Your Honor, that

the compromise he proposed was not addressed to the impact
statement.
Q

Well, I know, but it was addressed to whether or

or to settle a debate about whether cr not funds should be
appropriated for this purpose?
MR» SIVE:

Yes, for whether or not there should be

a speed fie prohibition of this detonation.
Q

And instead they put a condition upon the

expenditure of funds for this purpose, and left it with the
President?
MR. SXVS:
Q

As to whether or not funds would be ~

MR. SITE;
Q

Left it with the President —

Yes.

— would be appropriated — would be spent for

that purpose?
MR. SIVEs

Right.

1 think -that in the context of

that whole debate, as is stated in -the Circuit Court opinion,
what was done was an extra condition, in addition to the
condition that ~~

'Pastore saids

This pinpoints the authority and responsibility

that all departments concerned, whether it be the State
Department, the Office of Science and Technology, let them
bring their causes to the Oval Room in the White House, and
then let the President of the United States, who is the firstresponsible citizen of the country, make the decision.
Do you think Congress anticipated that he would
gather all the information and decide the adequacy of the
various factors that went into such, a decision?
MR. SIVEs

I think not, Your Honor.

And I think

that part of the answer to that is in the original Circuit
Court opinion of October 5, and part of the answer to that is
in the history of this whole matter, with which I have some

14
personal acquaintance from the very start.

That from the very

first there was an effort to forbid this, and the compromise
on that was imposing the extra condition of the President's

Q

When they denied interlocutory relief, must

•they not have concluded that you had not made a showing of
probability of success, requisita to meat the Virginia
Petroleum standard?
"
If
MR. SIVEs /Your Honor is speaking of the Court of
Appeals decision of November 3rd; I think no.
Q

Collectively, all of their holdings.

MR. SIVEs

I think the same answer applies, Your

Honor.
Q

How could they have reached the result they

reached?
MR. SIVEs

Ihey reached the result, the Court of

Appeals, because they determined that there was insufficient
time, even one or two days, to study the very documents which
we have been trying for three months to secure, which were
finally delivered to the court for an in camera inspection last
Saturday, and finally came to us on November 2, and were
delivered to the Court of Appeals simultaneously with the

16

notices of appeal.
And the Court of Appeals, I submit,1 erroneously
stated that the necessity is so pressing, and this is so
desperate a situation that we just do not have the time to
take even the 48 hours to look at the documents, which I
think now Your Honors have.
I think you have ail of the documents.

The Train

memoranda, the Ruckelshaus recommendation against the shot;
many of which X have not seen.

And those documents, I think,

show the strength of our case, X think strong enough, if we
have the time, to mov§ for summary judgment in the case.
And X think that the Court of Appeals decision is
not a holding.

I 'think it specifically says that it is not a

holding that our claim does not have merit.
the opposite.

It says, I think,

It says that our claims do have substantial

merit -Q

Well, the standard is not whether it has merit,

under the holding of that court about ten years ago, but whether
you have met the burden showing that you probably will be
successful.

That's one of the basic standards, which is of

course ancient inequity, isn’t it?
MR, SIVEs That is correct, Your Honor.
we have met that burden.

But I think

Had the Circuit Court of Appeals

taken the 48 hours to look at the documents delivered to them,
and we could have met that burden much more easily by being

17
given 24 hoars between the time we finally got the documents
and 'the District Court ruled on the preliminary injunction
motion.
And what is important, sad I think goes to the
heart of this matter, is that we began the action as soon as
impossible after -the impact statement.

We began the discovery

to secure those documents, with the recommendations which the
October 5 opinion said:

if they exist, we must prevail.

We began that the very first day permitted by Rule 26.
summary judgment motion was granted.

The

We came back immediately

after the October 5th opinion.
For three weeks there was an unprecedented series
of efforts by us to secure those documents, an unprecedented
series of objections by the government? finally the Executive
Privilege objection, the constitutional objection, the
determination of that on October 28.

And finally the

documents came to us the morning of November 1st.
Q

Mr. Sive, when did the Commission schedule

November 6th as the date for detonation?
MR. SIVE:
five days ago.
Q

1 think. Your Honor, it was approximately

My recollection -Well, had it ever scheduled any earlier date,

or aiiy other date?
MR. SIVE:
knowledge —

Thee was talk, and I didn’t have direct

Q

No, I mean was there actually a scheduling of a

date other than — or is this the only date that's ever been
scheduled?
MR.. SIVEs

I think the only specific date.

At that press release and that press conference at
noon on October 27th, they stated they'd begun the storming.
And they said, I think, "a week from today we'll be ready to
detonate".

Meaning, as I understand it, ready if then

conditions permit.
I think that there is tins© to delay the detonation
for us to present the petition for cert and for Your Honors
to rule upon it.
1 see that I just have one minute left of the time
which I will take initially, and X will use that to simply
state what X think ie really the —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Counsel, if I may

interrupt you *—
MR. SIVEs

Yes,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

— v?8*ll extend your time

at the moment five more minutas, and play if by ear, as it were
as we go along? and the same extension for counsel.
MR, SIVEi

Well, thank you.

Then 1 will take more

time .
But to come to the heart of the matter here, which
I think Your Honors correctly raises

What proof did we put In

19
to show the merits of the case, and how do we judge this,
applying the ordinary rules under Rule 65, and then what is
extraordinary about idie case?
I believe that if Your Honors look at the documents,
you will see the recommendationsspecifically against Cannikin
by governmental agencies, recommendations to which there was
no reference in the impact statement.

You will see references

to a number of opposing scientific views, held by scientists
within governmental agencies,
Q

Is there anything unusual about that, the

processes of government, whether they are going to build a
new type of battleship or submarine or airplane?

Are there

position papers of various experts within and from outside
the gover-ment that are in conflict?
MR, SIVEs That is not unusual, Your Honor,

Under the

statute which we are proceeding, the applicability of which
is knowledge, and under the Court of Appeals holding of
October 5, which I say is the substantive law from which we
have started.

The Court of Appeals stated that the impact

statement is defective, and therefore the detonation illegal,
if -there are responsible opposing scientific views opposing
some of the substantial views set forth in the impact
statement, to which no meaningful reference is made in the
impact statement.
And there's a second grounds

If there are reports

20
specifically reconsaendingr against Cannikin because of its
environmental hazards.
From that point on, October 5th, is when we started
this'process of discovery, to secure the secret documents in
which -there are the responsible opposing views about the very
basic hazards of Cannikin.
of earthquakes.

The basic hazards of Tsunami

Those are set forth in the Train memorandum,

Mr. Russell Train, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental
Quality.

Tlie recommendation, 1 believe, against Cannikin is

set forth in the Ruckelshaus document, which Your Honors have,
which 1 have not seen.
The opposing scientific views go right through the
several papers to which reference is made in the affidavit
which we submitted by my associate, James Burke, after the
• one-hour’s look that we had at the» papers when they were
delivered to us simultaneously with the ruling on the
preliminary injunction.
Now, that is the substantive law in the October 5
opinion.

And the question, then, is* Should that law be

brushed 'aside?

Should there be something different?

Should

there be some permission granted to -the Commission to waive
tiafc law aside?'
On -the ground that there is seme pressing necessity
which requires that.
Q

I just want to be sure I understand your

21
position, Mr. Sive.

You referred to the merits of the case.

New, the merits of the case, basically, aside from your Fifth
Amendment argument, the merits of the case go to the suffici­
ency, the legal sufficiency of the impact statement, under
Section 102(c)? is that right?
MR. SXVEs
Q

That's correct, Your Honor.

They go not at all, you're not asking this

Court, nor did you ask the District Court nor the Court of
Appeals, to itself weigh the impact of this proposed detonation
upon the environment, did you?
MR. SXVE:
Q

No, Your Honor.

That's no business of the Court, is it?

MR. SIVS:

No.

And the Appeals Court said that it

would not be the ultimate judge of the correctness of the
views on one side or the other.
Q

tod that is the law, at least in the Court of

Appeals for -the District of Columbia?
MR. SXVE:

Yes.

That would be subject, perhaps,

to a ruling by the administrative agency which might be
impeached for being wholly capricious.

We don't have that

issue here.
Q

Right.

So the merits of •the case go to the

legal sufficiency of the impact statement under Section 102(c)
of the Act?
MR, SXVE: That is correct.

And as authority for

22
enjoining a works, which is described in an impact statement,
or where 'there is no impact statement rendered, or the
impact statement is insufficient»
To enjoin that, the cases, some of them are set forth
on pages 8 and 9, we know them, the Arkansas Dam case, the
Alaskan pipeline case, and the others.
Wow "**
Q

Now we have before us, now, so far as this case

has gone, an opinion earlier this month by the United States
Court of Appeals, not deciding, not deciding whether or not
the, impact statement was sufficient, saying that they didn’t
have time to decide that, expressing doubts as to its
sufficiency, and not expressing any view as to the probability
of ultimate success? but saying that under those circumstances
it would then weigh the equities and, balancing the equities
on both sides, it declined your application.
That’s what we have.
So we have the basic merits of the case, wholly
unresolved by the Court of Appeals.

Is that correct?

They

were resolved in the District Court against, you.
MR. SIVEs
Q

Unresolved, Your Honor, I would —

Xfc was the finding of the District Court that the

impact statement was wholly sufficient under the law.

And

that was disavowed by the Court of Appeals.
MR. SITEs

Yes.

The Court of Appeals stated our

23
failure to enjoin the test la not predicated on the conviction
that the ABC has complied»
Q

High t.

MR, SIVE? And then it referred to the serious
question.

But it did not give itself the time to look at the

documents to —~
Q

We11; it didn’t decide the merits of the case.

MR. SIVS: That’s correct. Your Honor.

And it

didn’t decide the merits because of what I think is the basic
error of the Court of Appeals.

It assumed that there is some

necessity which requires that the NEPA law be waved aside
in these circumstances.

And not giving itself the two or

three 'days necessary repeals that NEPA provision, because it
was 'die Commission who chose to file the impact statement
only four months before the scheduled area of the time of the
test.

It was the Commission which moved to dismiss the

complaint? the District Court which erroneously did so? the
Commission which then frustrated the whole lawsuit from
October 5th through November 2nd? and finally we, whan we
finally begin to secure the meaningful discovery of the
very documents which, under the Court of Appeals October 5
opinion, we think are our case.
Under -that substantive law, then the Court cf Appeals
says,we submit erroneously? we throw up our hands, this is
too urgent# this comes at too late a stage.

24
Arid so the final question is:

Is there such

necessity, such emergency that this detonation must, go ahead,
that the major substantive less? applicable to it, acknowledged
applicable to it, must be brushed aside?
fed we submit that there is not that necessity.
The one item which the Commission refers to in in that press
release, when they said, in so many words:

The necessity

of the shot overrides the environmental consideration.
But we have no situation of martial law, of war,
of emergency, of invasion? no situation whatsoever which
should repeal, for practical purposes, the substantive law.
And the failure of the District and the Circuit
Courts to give themselves the time to look at the documents
which, we submit, spell out our case, we think was a disregard
of the substantive law, and in the circumstances to which the
Circuit Court itself referred, mildly,perhaps, criticising
what I do not do the Commission and its attorneys were
concentrating on frustrating the discovery to get to the point
where the detonation would be there when we finally gat the
documents,
In those circumstances, the Circuit Court said we
cannot act.

And in those circumstances is when we determined,

my clients and myself, 'that wo would come to this Court to
place before you the ultimate issue of whether the Commission,,

which has the power to make the machines which can virtually

25
destroy the earth; has the same obligation to obey the
substantive law NEP& applicable to it —
Q

Well, let’s concede that it has an obligation

to obey that law, doesn’t it?
MR. SIVE:
Q

That's correct.

You began your argument by saying that.

So

let’s not indulge in this rhetoric, if it’s beyond the issues
in this case.

That’s not in issue,,

The Commission concedes

that it has an obligation to obey —
ME. SIVEs
Q

1 -think that is correct.

I thought you were getting into your main

argument.
MR, SIVS;

What the Commission does not concede,

I think, and what the Court of Appeals perhaps did not hold,
and what I ask this Court to hold, is that where the circum­
stances of the bringing of the only action possible to test
the substantive law were such that the plaintiffs did everything
humanly possible to

bring that, and then, at the last moment,

they secure the evidence in the documents; simultaneously
therewith the District Court denies the preliminary injunction
motion,
Then we say if there is no concession that there
must be that time to look at those documents, than they do not
concede the practical applicability of the substantive law?
and, for all practical purposes, the substantive lav? is

26
repealed.
Q

Has there been any question raised in this case

as to the standing of your clients?
MR « SXVEs
Q

Ho# Your Honor , there has not.

X --

The point was never raised?

MR. SIVEs

Nona at all.

I know that there is before

this Court the Mineral King case, and that involves some of
the same organisations involved here? but the government has
never raised the question of the standing.
Q

You have emphasised several times , counsel, that

perhaps the Court of Appeals and the District Court did not
look at the non-record documents, because they didn’t have the
time.

Now, you indicated we have them.

Are you aware that

the totality of those documents could be read by anyone
within, at -the outside, three hours?
MR. SIVEs

At the very outside?

I don’t know the precise extent of them,

Your Honor, because some of them I have not seen.

2 know that

the Court of Appeals stated that it doesn’t have time to look
at the documents which were thrust albeit just one day before
its determination.
I only know the number of pages in the documents
which were shown to me.

Your Honors have greater knowledge

of the precise extent of the documents.
*1

But those documents, we submit, have the specific
recommendations of governmental agencies against Cannikin.

27
Those documents show the Coast -- the U. S,
Geological Survey, stating that the tritium may escape to the
sea within one to two years instead of three years or more;
stating that the concentration may he 100,000 times the
allowable limit instead of the 1200 times in the impact
statement*
The existence of the Geological Survey study, which
is discussed at length in the Train memo, doesn't appear at
all in the impact statement*
Q

Now, -then, the Commission, of course, had to

take all of these things mid weigh them in this decision <>
I understood you to concede that that was the case?
MR* SXVEs

Yes»

The Commission took these documents(

and it had to weigh them, and under the Court of Appeals
holding the Commission had the duty to place in the impact
statement some reasonable reference to, some meaningful
reference to the opposing scientific views and references to
are set forth in total, the reports of government agencies
against the detonation*
And those reports —•
Q

You mean they can't simply says

we've had.the

great deal of material, and we’ve considered all of it, and
it doesn't affect our determination.
MR, SIVEs
Q

Precisely,

What they had to do was to take each -- what

28
was the word you used ;
MR. SIVBs

responsible?

Responsible opposing views make a

meaningful —
Q

They had to say there was the opposing view of

this agency, a responsible one, and they said such-and-such;
nevertheless we don’t accept that for the following reasons;
that sort of tiling?
MR. SIVE:

That is the holding of the Circuit Court.

And, Your Honors, I will point out, too, that we’re not

here

dealing with something which is just a matter of another
airport or another dam or another bridge; we’re dealing with
responsible opposing views as to the perils of a 5-megaton
bomb.

We’res not simply dealing with a technical aspect of

the law*
Q

it'*s that deficiency, if 1 get it correctly, Mr.

Sive, that you say makes out a violation cf 102(c)?
MR. SIVEs
Q

That deficiency and the second deficiency

Or non-compliance, in other words?

MR. SIVE; That’s correct.
The second is the deletion of the recommendations
specifically against Cannikin by the principal environmental
protection agencies, EQC and EPA,
Q

You mean the Commission deleted something?

MR. SIVE: The impact statement —
Q

Yes.

29
has no reference to —

MR., SIVEs
Q

Well*, that’s an omission not a deletion.

MR. SIVEs

Perhaps it is an omission, yes.

The principal environmental protection agencies
recommended against this.

And what happened was that -the

recommendations against -die detonation went to an Under
Secretary’s committee —
Q

Yes, but just let ®te get back to this.

If I’ve

understood your position correctly, it is that the Commission,
under 102(c), has a duty to address itself specifically to
certain responsible opposition, as you put it.
does the address take?

What form

They say,85We * ve had this opposition,

and it nevertheless does not lead to a different conclusion
for the following reasons.53 Or how is that to be done?
MR. SIVEs Essentially it would be that.

"We have

studied the opposing views, w© acknowledge -chat there are those
opposing views” **Q

But they have to name them, is that what you5‘re

getting at?
MR. SIVE:

Yes, they must make a meaningful

reference to them.
And the reason for that is that the impact statement
is what goes to all of the other government agencies and goes
to the public, and under the Arkansas Dam case, is the public
document the disclosure of the environmental hazard, and the

30
other agencies and the public in this case included the State

of Alaska* and the Governor of Alaska* and all of those
agencies concerned with the peril.
And what the Commission failed to do here was to
disclose -the most vital aspects of the study of Cannikin* and
render the statement substantially misleading.

And it did

that on the basis of claims of privilege later made in this
suit* that the ”against" part of the study of the agencies
could go to an Under Secretary*s committee and be —
Q

Xs that the Irwin committee?

MR. SIVEs That5s correct,. Your Honor.
Q

As I take it* if you're right about this* then

the facts* that when they considered -the impact statement* if
they did* in the Senate at the time of -the appropriation bill*
they did not have what was the form of statement that the
statute requires.

Xs that right?
|

MR. SIVEs

X didn't catch the last part of Your

Honor * s question.
Q

Do I understand that the impact statement was

before the Senate when it considered the appropriation bill
this last month or so?
MR, SIVEs The impact statement had been issued on
June 21st.
Q

Well* was it debated in connection with the

appropriation bill?

31
MR. S3!VE:

There; are references to the impact

statement.
Q

Right.

And 1 gather vour position Is that that

gets us nowhere,, because the impact statement that was before
the Senate, was before us, and wars before the Courts below,,
was not in compliance with Section 102 fc).
MR. SXVE:

Yes.

And the impact

statement, if it
J
was used or referred to by the Senate, misled them as much as

it misled the public.
Moreover, «—
Q

They didn’t approve the blast — 2 mean they

didn’t approve the detonation.
MR. SIVE: That’s right,
Q

They said, "Let's settle this big argument

about whether or not it should or shouldn’t over in the
White House"?
MR. SIVE:

I think not, Your Honor.

I think what

they said was, "Let’s impose an extra condition on this".
Q

Yes. Well, they said the President was to have

the decision as to whether or not the blast was to take place.
MR. SIVE:

They said that, I believe, as an extra

condition. They did not repeal NEP&’s applicability to this,
as they could well have done, as NEPA could provide that all
detonations or all
be exempt from NEPA.

Atomic Energy Commission major works will
They did not do that.

32
And it’s interesting, too, that during that debate,
and this shows the way the documents matter was managed,
nobody ever knew the classified information as to what this
shot was for, the Spartan warhead, until the Commission ran
into some political difficulties, and then, during the midst
of that debate, it released the information that this was for
the Spartan warhead,
Q

That was in a letter to Senator Pastor®.

MR. SIVEs That5s right.
Q

Right.

MR. SlVEz Correct,
Q

How, Section 102(c)(3) provides that the

impact statement contain a — include a possible alternative

(

to the proposed action.

/•
j

MR, SIVEs
Q

Yes? right, right.

f

Is it your contention that Part 4 of the impact

statement, page 46, listing the alternatives, is legally
insufficient under the statute?
MR. SIVEs
Q

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

Why, and how?

MR. SIVEs

The basic thrust of the impact statement

is that we must proceed with this shot, and the necessity of
proceeding with it. outweighs any environmental hazards.
But we submit that it is not fulfilling the obliga­
tion to simply way what they did:

that this is a military

33
necessity.
Q

■ Well,- you've read ~ I'm sure you've read page

46?
MR. SXVEs
Q

I‘11 get out my copy.

Of the impact statement.

MR. SIVE:
Q

Yes, I have.

Of the impact statement.

It's all in Part 4*. arid it appears on one page.

And that, 1 suppose, is in response to Section 102(c)(3)?
MR. SJVE:

Yes.

If Your Honor is referring to the ona, this
altemativeBnot testing the device would severely hamper the
development o£ nuclear1 weapons technology.”
That, we submit, is insufficient.
Q

Wall, what -~

MR. SIVE:

However, that is not the issue which

we were able to litigate.
Q

Ho.

But then 2 is testing the device at another

location.
MR. SIVE:
Q

That's right.

3 is testing a smaller-yieid device.

And 4 is

delaying the Cannikin test for mors study of environmental
matters.
MR. SIVE: That's right.
Q

Those are the four.1 alternatives listed. And

you say that's insufficient under 102(c)(3)?

34
MR* SIVE:

The — yes, we say that is insufficient,

but that is a separate ground of illegality from what I've
been discussing thus far.
Q

Well, the illegality is the insufficiency of

the impact statement under 102(c).

That's your claim?

MR* SITE: That is correct*
And one of the aspects —
Q

what I'm trying to get at is:

what specifically

is the claim to illegality?
MR* SIVE:
Q

The setting forth of —

Like you, I stayed up fairly late last night,

and I read the impact statement.

But I don’t have it word for

word in mind, and that’s the reason I'm interested in your
answer.
MR. SIVE:

I think the answer, Your Honor, is clear.

If you have a copy of 102(c) —
Q

Yes.

MR. SIVE:

— it provides that the detailed statement

by the responsible official —• and the detailed statement is
the impact statement — shall set forth five items, the third
of which, one of which is the alternatives to the proposed
action.
Q

Alternatives to the proposed action.

Right.

MR. SIVE: That page 46 sets forth the alternatives,
and may or may not be sufficient as that third item.

The items

35
which I*ve been discussing thus far are under the other items,
because this impact statement does not set forth with
particularity required by the law of this case, and the other
cases on pages 8 and 9 of our brief in the Appeals Court, of
the environmental consequences.
And those environmental consequences are the
substantial hazards, the hazards of tidal waves going to
Hawaii, and this is from the Train memo not from our affidavits,
those are the hazards which the Court of Appeals was referring
to when it said "opposing scientific views'5.
And Your Honor’s question is addressed to Item 3,
but Item 3 only of what is in the impact statement.
Q

Subsection 3.

MR. SXVE;
Q

Forgive me, subsection 3.

Item 4 or 5, I think, page 46.

MR. SIVE:

Yes.

of the text of the Act.

I'm referring to Item 3 of 102(c)
And that page 46 is the purported

satisfaction of that single item.
Q

Right.

MR. SIVE;

I think, Your Honor — forgive me.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You are now cutting

into your rebuttal time.
MR. SIVE;

Yes.

Well, than I will halt at this time,

and save myself, if I may, five or seven minutes for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

MR. SIVE:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

total of 15 minutes, and we611 do likewise with the Solicitor

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GRISWOLD:

May it please the Courts

Of course we must comply with the law.

We have.

There is a question of standing in this case, as is
evident enough when one reads the names of the plaintiffs,
which includes, among other things, a Canadian unincorporated
association.

We have not raised that question below simply

because of the content, the —- we’re trying to facilitate
the consideration of this in the Court.

We're trying to avoid

delay.
And I mention it only because of its relevance to
what seems to me to be an underlying question hare, a question
of separation of powers.
Whether this is something which should be decided by
the courts, or whether this is something which is properly
under our system, left to the determination of the politically
responsible officers of the government.
The question of law in this case is a narrow one.

37
There is no basis for an injunction unless something illegal
la threatened.

There is nothing illegal here.

The sole Question arises under the Environmental
Protection Act, which requires, in section 102, that an
environmental impact statement be made and published.

An

environmental impact statement was made and published by the
AEC.
1 hold it in ay hands.
It was published on June 21, 1971.

But an earlier

draft of it was prepared in 1970, nearly a year before it went
out? was widely circulated and distributed.
received.

Comments were

It was not sprung on anybody in 1971.
And it is the impact statement required by the

statute.

It is obviously carefully, thoughtfully done, in

good faith.

No court below has decided to the contrary*

There is nothing in the Environmental Protection Act
or in any other Act which requires this statement to be right,
to be exhaustive, to cover everything.

There is nothing in

this statute, using the words that Mr. Sive used, which
requires the Commission to consider all responsible opposition
and to make intelligent and relevant response thereto.
The statute is quite simples !'A11 agencies of the federal
government, shall (c) include in ©vary recommendation or
report on proposals for legislation and other major federal
actions*' — which applies to the ABC and they have always

38
recognized that it does •““•"significantly affecting the quality
of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible
official"—- and here the responsible official is the general
manager of the AEG, who has signed this? and the statement,
all told, is 75 or 80, 69 pages long, plus supplementary
material.
"... a detailed statement on"— and then five things
are listed, and if the statement is examined, those five
things are covered.
Prior to making any detailed statement, the responsible
federal official shall consult with and obtain tha comments of
any federal agency which has jurisdiction by lav? or special
expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved,
copies of such statements and comments and the views of the
appropriate federal, state and local agencies which are
authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards
shall be made available to the President, the Council on
Environmental Quality and to the public, as provided in
section 552, -Title V*,1 which is commonly known as the Freedom
of Information Act, "and all of the statements received are
included in .the impact statement and shall accompany tha
proposal through -the existing agency review process."
Now, that is the statute, and it has been fully
complied with.
Q

Are those referred to in the impact statement?

39
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, they are included as an Appendix

to the impact statement* a considerable number of letters from
officers of the government, and responses by the agency.
There is nothing in the Act which requires the statement to
be right; there is nothing in the Act ttfhich gives any court
any authority to review the statement in any way.

It is not

a decision —
Q

Well, you don't mean the Court can't review

whether or not it complies with 102(c), do you?
MR. GRISWOLD:

I don't mean that, Mr. Justice.

I

think it obviously does comply with section 102(c), if it
ware —
Q

Well, what is your position —

MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

— if it were — excuse me.

The issue is whether this one does or doesn’t

comply with 102(c).
MR. GRISWOLD:

% position is that it is perfectly

obvious that it does comply with 102(cj.
Q
position.

I understand that.

I understand that's your

But that’s the issue, isn’t it?
MR. GRISWOLD: That, I assume, is the issue.
Q

And certainly that's an issue for the courts to

decide, isn’t it?
MR. GRISWOLD: That is an issue for a court to decide.
Q

Right.

40
MR. GRISWOLD:

And if the statement were one page long

and said, "Well, we really don't think this is very important’
and we've put down these fiv© things, and we say that they
are all complied with58, it would be inadequate.
But this is not such a statement by any possibility.
Q

I didn't find Train's statement, is that in —*

MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

You didn't find --?

Russell Train's statement.

MR. GRISWOLD:

Russell Trainc s statement is not —

was not — X will come to that in a moment.

Russell Train's

statement was made to the Under Secretary's committee of the
National Security Council.

It was not made to the Atomic

Energy Coavaission in response to this, and was not required by
the statute to be included or to be daalt with.
Q

Nor can I find Ruokelhaus’s statement*

MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

In tiie same way, I will come to that.

Okay.

MR. GRISWOLD: And 1 think that «- well, X would like
just to finish this part, because that's the next part of ray
argument.
Q

Yes.

MR. GRISWOLD:

This is not a decision based on a

record which can then be examined to see whether it's based
on adequate evidence.

It's simply an environmental impact

statement, required by law, and duly and carefully made.

41

Now, the court below suggests that the action of
the AEC way be illegal.

But it does not suggest any statute

under which it may be illegal.

It doss not suggest any

statute which the AEC may have violated.
I do not believe that there is any such statist©.
Q

Well, Mr. Solicitor General, let'a assume that

it were clear that th© impact statement were legally insuffici­
ent.

Let * s assume that it was a one-page statement of

abstract conclusions, which I think you conceded in argument
would be insufficient under 102(c), a moment ago.
MR. GRISWOLDs

Yes, Mr. Justice, I think they must

make a good-faith effort to comply with section 102, and to
me, it is perfectly c3.ear they have.
Q

Yes, I understand that.

Let me finish my question.

Let's assume that it

were conceded that the impact statement were insufficient under
102(c).

Then, would you concede, as a matter of law, that

this proposed detonation should be enjoined?

Do you, in

other words —
}

MR. GRISWOLDs
Q

No, lie. Justice, because —

Do you, in other words, concede that the filing

of a legally sufficient impact statement is a condition
precedent to the government’s going forward with its proposed
action?

MR. GRISWOLDs

I think it would be, Mr. Justice, if

42
it ware not for the actions of Congress, in effect, delegating
this decision to the President, and the President's decision
made pursuant to that delegation.

Which I think takes this

out from under an ordinary environmental impact statement
situation.
Q

But if —

Q

Then you'd go so far as to say you didn't need

an impact statement?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Even if there had been no impact

statement issued at all, X believe that if Congress chooses
to say, "Well, whether or not there shall be a dotonati.cn at
Amchitka is to be decided by the President", and the President
makes that decision, both in his capacity as Chief Executive
and as Commander-in-chief, I believe that should determine
the matter and should be regarded as a matter properly con- •—
Q

Well, now,let me see if I understand that.

You are than suggesting that the action with respect to both
the authorisation and the appropriation bills, which said, in
effect, "let the President personally decide whether Cannikin
shall be detonated", that that action had the effect of
superseding NEPA.
And why do you — if that's so — is that your
position?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Well, that is one of my positions.

My other position is that NEPA was fully complied with.

43
Q

I see»

But you’re saying even if it were not

complied with* then section 102(c), for the purposes of
Cannikin, was washed out by the Congress in its action on the
appropriation bill?
MR, GRISWOLDs

Yes, Mr. Justice, I think we have

both grounds to roly on.

1 think the first is perhaps the

clearer and stronger ground, but -the second is one which seems
to me to have great merit.
Q

I gather the Court of appeals disagreed with

that, decision, did it not?

Expressly.

%

MR. GRISWOLDs

No, they said that ‘— what Mr. Siva

says, that the President’s approval was an additional
condition.
G

That’s what I say.

They disagreed with your

position.
MR. GRISWOLDs

That doesn't seem to me to foe a

realistic appraisal of what —
Q

It may not foe, font all I am eisking is:

The

Court of Appeals disagreed with the position the government
is urging hare this morning?
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Yes.

MR. GRISWOLD;1'

X assume I*m free to disagree with

Of course you are

MR. GRISWOLD 3
Q

with the Court of Appeals

Of course you are, as Xsm free to disagree with

you.
MR. GRXSWOLDs

— on this matter.

Here the Atomic Energy Commission has made its
environmental impact statement, and that is all it is
required to do under the lav;.
Q

There is no basis for review»

It is required to make one that complies with

the provisions of 102(c).
MR. GRISWOLDs
Q

Yes, Mr, Justice.

It can’t just file a paper labeled impact

statement.
MR. GRISWOLD a
Q

Right.

MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

I agree, Mr. Justice.

And I think they have.

Right.

MR. GRISWOLD:

As I think can be quickly determined

by anyone who examines it.
There is no basis for review in the statute or for
second-guessing the Commission, which has performed its
function and has complied with the statute, and has met all
of the requirements of the statute fully»
How, the next point, and I think it is important.
The statements which were sought, and most of which have been
given, were not made to the Atomic Energy Commission.

They

45
are not part of the process leading to the environmental
impact statement.
Every one of the statements sought, without exception,
was made to the Under Secretary*s committee, of the National
Security Council.

And I have here a copy of the subpoena,

which was served on Mr. Seaborg, requiring him, not personally
but through a representative, to appear? and the subject
stated?

With respect to testify with respect to actions and

procedures of the Council on Environmental Quality, as an
adviser to the

to Mr. Train -— actions and procedures of the Council on
Environmental Quality as an adviser to the Under Secretary*s
committee of the National Security Council, with respect to
the underground nuclear weapons test proposed by the Atomic
Energy Commission, known as Cannikin.
Well now, what is the —
Q

Just a moment, Mr. Solicitor General.

The

language that you read to us earlier from 102(c), ”the
responsible public official shall consult with and obtain
the comments of any federal”
MR. GRXSWOLDs
Q

any federal agency.

Yes.

"Which has jurisdiction by law or special

expertise" and so forth.

Does that not embrace consultation

with those who prepared these vary statements?
MR. GRISWOLDs

1 think not, Mr. Justice.

46
Q

Oh, it doss not?

1 see.

In that connection, my related question concerns the
Councilp Mr. Train's Council.

His Council prepared the

guidelines, did it not, for the 102(c) compliance?
MR. GRISWOLDs
Justice.

I'm sorry.

I'm not prepared to answer that, Mr.

the relationship of the Executive in matters of tills kind.
But there is —*
Q

Well, isn't the Environmental Protection Agency

MR. GRISWOLD:

No, the Environmental Protection

And so you say it’s not a federal agency within

MR. GRISWOLD:

I think it is probably not within the

meaning of that statute, just as 1' think Dr. Kissinger is not
a federal agency within the meaning of that statute.

Well, then —

issued.
How, what is the Under Secretary's committee?
a little mysterious.

That’a

But there has been a statute for 25

years setting up the National Security Council* which consists
now of a number of high-level Cabinet officers.
And there is a National Security decision memorandum

Now, that is not an executive order, because coming

in the National Security zone it is not published as an
executive order.

But it is, for all practical purposes, an

executive order.
It was signed by President Richard Nixon on
January 20, 1969, which was Inauguration Day, and it provides
for the reorganisation of the National Security Council
system.
And one of the things it provides for setting up is
the National Security Council Under Secretary's committee,
which shall consider a number of items, including other
operational matters referred to it jointly by the Under
Secretary of State and the Assistant to the President for
National Security Affairs.
And then there is a National Security decision
memorandum 18, dated June 27, 1969, which is secret, and
properly secret.

But I have been authorised to quote two

passages from it.
"The President" — this is signed by Dr. Kissinger,

49
the adviser to the President.
"The President has directed that the National Security
Council Under Secretary's committee will review -the annual
underground nuclear test program and quarterly «request for
authorisation of specific scheduled tests.**
And then:
"The results of the committee's review of the
underground nuclear test program, and its recommendations,
should be transmitted to the President in time to allow him
to give them full consideration before the scheduled events
are to take place."
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, absent the section 103

of the appropriation bill, would the President have had the
power to stop this detonation anyway?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Oh, yes, Mr. Justice.

I'm sure he

would have had -- I cannot now cite the statute or the
authority, but I am sure that the President, either under
statute or under executive power, would have had ■(die power
at least to delay it, to refer the matter to Congress for
recommendation? as X understand the law, the President is
never under any legal obligation to expend money which the
Congress has appropriated.

He may be under various and sundry

political and moral obligations.
Q

Well, wasn't tills an appropriation to the AEG?

MR. GRISWOLD: This was an appropriation to the ARC,

50
yes, Mr. Justice.
Q

Well, can the President interdict the AEC

decisions?
MR. GRISWOLDs

X have no doubt that he can, as a

practical matter, and if X were more familiar with the details
of the Atomic Energy Act, I am sure I could cite you a
provision which would give him rather explicit power with
respect to all atomic detonations.
Q
jurisdiction.

I suppose the place, anyway, was under federal
He probably had some powers to ~~

MS. GRISWOLD: The area is certainly federal land,
Q

Yes. Thank you.

MR. GRISWOLDs

Now, as X pointed out, the Under

Secretary's committee was specifically directed by the
President to review the annual nuclear test program.

Dr.

Kissinger's memorandum transmitted an order of the President,
though signed by him.

It's obviously part of the process of

aiding him, just as the Clerk or a Deputy Clerk signs for
this Court in transmitting an order of the Court.
Every item sought hare was prepared as a part of
this process.

It should foe clearly privileged throughout.

There is no statute to the contrary.

Not the Environmental

Protection Act, for it has nothing to do with the procedures
of the AEC under that Act.
It is — in its decision of October 28, the Court of
\

51
Appeals required much of this material to foe made public, or
to be made available to counsel on ‘the other side.
We thought that decision was plainly wrong, and
plainly unsupported by any statute.

But we did not seek

certiorari, because we did not want to bring this question
to tills Court under such time pressure.
Instead,we accepted the decision of the Court of

'

Appeals, as far as it and the District Court are concerned,
and we went back to the District Court and complied fully
with the decision of the Court of Appeals.

At least we did

everything that Judge Hart required under that decision, and
more»
But it is still our position, which we rely on her©,
that the decision of th® Court of Appeals as to these materials,
all of which were prepared for 'die Under Secretary's committee
of the National Security Council, was wrong.

Both as a matter

of the President's privilege to get information on a secure
confidential basis and because it had nothing to do with the
environmental impact statement of the AEC.
X think the publication of Mr. Train's memorandum
t

itself illustrates the inherent difficulties in the problem
Of simply making everything of this kind available.
Now we come to the statutory provisions *—
Q

When was Mr. Train's communication first made

available to either the parties in this case or the public?

52
Was that a privat© communication originally, Mr. Train’s?
MR. GRISWOLDs

Mr. Train’s communication was a

communication to the Under Secretary’s committee in response
to a request from the Under Secretary's committee, arising
under the duty established by this order signed by Dr.
Kissinger, National Defense memorandum Wo. 18.

Q

In other words, he was fulfilling his function

as an adviser to the Executive Branch when ha wrote that
memorandum?
MR. GRISWOLD;

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is

a part of the President's responsibility under statutes that
1 have not at my fingertips, to have ultimate control with
respect to planning and final decision of atomic detonations.
How we have the statute, and there are two statutes.
In considering the Atomic Energy Commission authorisation
bill, both the House and the Senate considered amendments -that
would have eliminated authorisation for the Cannikin test*
2 have the Congressional Record citations here.
The amendments v?era not passed.

In connection with

-- no, not of the authorisation? I don't believe the impact
statement was available.

It may have been.

The author!sation bill was approved by the President
on August 11th, 1971, sin weeks after the impact statement was
issued.
The Appropriations Act, the Public Works Appropria-

53
•cions bili of 3.972, bo ili the House and the Senate debated
resolutions to delete from the bill funds for the Cannikin
project.

In the House the amendment was defeated.

In th©

Senate the original amendment to delete the funds was with­
drawn —
Q

Excuse me, Mr. Solicitor.

Was there a line

item for Cannikin?
MR. GRISWOLD:

No, Mr. Justice, it is — I have —

these are the Senate and House hearings, which I brought,
and in th© time 1 have had available, it appears to me that
it is included in a line “weapons, $848,100,000w.

Q

So, I gather,the amendment actually was simply

that no part of the appropriation should fee expanded for
Cannikin?

Is that it?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, I assume that was it.

On the other — it is perfectly clear that in the
discussion in the Appropriations Committee there is specific
reference to Cannikin, and in the debate on the Floors of
Congress there was specific reference to Cannikin.
And the amendment to delete was withdrawn, and what
Congress finally passed, after it got through the Senate and
the conference process, is section 103 of the Act of October
5, 1971, 8S Stat 368. "None of the funds appropriated by
this Act shall be obligated or expended to detonate any
underground nuclear test scheduled to be conducted on Amchitka

54
Island, Alaska* unless the President gives his direct
approval for such test."
And the President has given that approval.
Now* let me say one thing which I say with regret.
But the time situation is extraordinarily difficult.

In the

first place* in this part of the world* that far north* there
are only three hours of daylight every day.

Ontil 12: 30 today it is possible to stop it, but
at 12:30 the unwinding of the life-support devices, which

Once that process has begun* it is not feasible to
do anything except either detonate it at 5:00 this afternoon,
or abandon the project.

55
Q

This is 12s30 our time?

MR. GRISWOLD it

These are — the times I'm giving- are

our — are Eastern Standard Time.

There is a six-hour time

If it is delayed after 12s30 today, it must be
delayed for at least three days because of the weather
conditions.

The chances of mechanical malfunction increase

exponentially with the passage of time.

Partly because there

evaluation of the chances.
Q

Well, may I ask, Mr. Solicitor General;

I

gather -that the real issue before us is whether we're going to
grant an injunction pending an opportunity to pass on the
plaintiff's petition for certiorari.
MR. GRISWOLD;
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice.

And if this detonation goes off this afternoon,

there's nothing left of the case, is there?
MR. GRISWOLD;

That is clear.

(Laughter,)
Q

So the whole case is moot, without our ever

having had a chance to see the petition for certiorari., which
counsel tells us they can file by *—

56
ME. GRISWOLD;

Except the chance that you have here,

under which I have tried to show that there is no legal basis
upon which they can proceed.
Q

And you've done it very wall.

But suppose we

don't agree with it?
(Laughter.}
MR, GRISWOLDs The judgment is for you, of course,
Mr. Justice.
Q

Yes.

Well

but I. think you appreciate our

dilemma.
MR. GRISWOLDs
Q

X certainly ~~

If tills goes off tills afternoon at 5 o'clock,

we'll never have a chance to pass on the merits of this case.
MR. GRISWOLD;

That could be, too, and if you do

stay it, of course every effort will be made to see that your
orders are complied with.

But it may well amount to a

permanent injunction against the —
Q

Well, that, I take it, depends on how quickly

ws get the consideration of the petition for certiorari.
MR. GRISWOLDs

No, Mr. Justice, I'm told 'that the

chance that-it will be a total failure, and now irretrievable,
that there will ba nothing to clo but start over? that a year
will ba lost.
Q

Now, I thought you said three days.

You can't

What was that word?

MR. GRXSWOLDs

Exponentially.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We'll have no more of

that.
Just a minute, counsel.
The audience will observe proper demeanor at all
times during arguments of the cases in this Court,

I hop©

•that need not be said again.
MR. GRISWOLD:

If It is two times tomorrow against

itf it will be four times on Monday, and it will be eight
times on Tuesday,

ibid that is a very — it amounts to

deciding whether you let the case go moot or whether you issue
what is in effect a permanent injunction against this, which
involvas not only -- I'm not relying on the expense, the
country can stand the expense.

But whether we can stand the

delay in getting information about nuclear devices is a far
more serious matter.
And I come to this, I have a final but important
word.
The purpose of this detonation is to preserve the

58
peace.
For the past twenty years we have kept the peace
between the Great Powers, and this has been done in considerable
part by maintaining a balance of deterrents.
That may be an unfortunate way to have to keep the
peace, but it is the way we have done it.

This has not been

easy, and it has taken great skill and effort by the
politicians and the scientists of the world.
We all hope, X am sure, that a better way will
eventually evolve by which the peace can be maintained.

But

the fact is that it has been the balance of deterrents which
has been the controlling factor in the recent past and at the
present time.
On the other side of the world, in the Northern
Hemisphere, an underground nuclear explosion of 6 megatons,
larger the one involved here, occurred on October 17, 1970.
There was no great world outcry, and the matter was not before
any courts.
It seems odd that it should be thought that those
responsible for our national security cannot obtain information
of the same order.

For obtaining information useful in

preserving our national security is -the only objective hers.
It seems odd that our officers cannot obtain this
information when their plans have been carefully made, their
expenditures have been authorised by Congress, their actions

59
have been approved by the President, and there is no lav? or
legal provision of any sort which has not been fully complied
vjith.
X submit -that there is no basis for granting an
injunction, and it should be denied.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?.

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General»
Mr. Siva,, you have about seven minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID SIVE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SIVSi

I think I will not use the whole of the

seven.
Just to clarify a couple of items which arose.
First, we do not. seek a permanent injunction in the
sense that if our prayer for relief is granted, this is
enjoined.

The injunction which would issue with a final

judgment far us would only be until the law is obeyed.
»•

Also, we do not reach here
Q

Well, I think on until your petition for

certiorari was disposed of, isn't that what you mean,?
MR. SIVEs
Q

Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.

Yes.

MR. SIVEs

But I'm addressing myself to the ultimate

relief going beyond that.

Assuming more, that the petition

would be granted, this Court would overrule, and then final

€0
judgment for us.
That enjoins it only while the violation of law so
found is outstanding.

When and if that violation of law is

removed, then the shot may proceed.
And chat means that the ultimate question is what
Mr. Solicitor General has said, is it so important that this
shot proceed now?

X know about the detonation, at least I've

read of it..by another nation.
I also know that the District Court raised this
question and asked me:

How are we going to compete?

And my only answer to that was that 25 years ago.
when many of us ware in a war, when 2 was there in the
Infantry, the same question was raised, and I told His
Honors

Somehow we won.
And we won because, I think, wa have a system of

law, aiid X think that is a far more important question than
what may be the need for nuclear deterrents, which X think'is
not in issue in this case.
And we haven't ever raised that issue, and we
haven’t ever asked for anything which goes to any military
secrecy.

Every document we’ve asked for, every question on

every deposition, has said?

Take out anything military?

take out anything dealing with foreign policy.
And so we went to the agency which had the
environmental information, and here is where there is one

61
specific answer in the law to a question which one of Your
Honors raised?

The EPA is specifically included in the EQC

guidelines promulgated on April 30, 1970, as one of the
agencies with the special expertise which the committing
agency, the project agency, the AEC must consult.
Q

Do we know — we have no reason to know, one way

or the other, whether -the agency did consult the SPA, do we?
ME. SIVE:
Q

Well —

MR. SXVEs
Q

I don’t know whether they did.

If they —

—» do we know that they did or that they

didn’t, that’s my question.
MR. SIVE:
Q

Ho.

MR. SIVEs
Q

That's right, we do not know whether —-

-**- they did or did not.

It doesn't appear in the impact report one

way or 'the other, does it?
f

MR. SIVEs Right.
We know that —
Q

But assuming — there is a presumption in the

law of regularity, and assuming that the guidelines that you
refer to requires the agency to consult the ERA, and shouldn't
there further be a presumption that they did so?
MR. SIVEs

1

think, Your Honor, the answer is that

if they did consult the EPA under the guidelines and the Act,

62
that consul tat ion and the answer of the SPA must be set forth
j.n the impact statement,
Q

Wail, that’s a differentquestion.

MR. SIVEs
Q

It’s a related question,

MR. SIVEi
Q

Yes,

Right.

MR. SIVEs

It goes beyond Your Honosr’s question.
Right.
And that is the defect of law. They did

not set forth —
Q

Weil, that’s your claim on the merits,

MR. ST.VE:
Q

Yes.

It’s related to your claim on the merits.

MR. SXVSs

Yes. And the EPA is a specific agency

under the April 30 guidelines.
Now, the CEQ itself is not.

We submit that the CEQ

is, to take the language of the statute,

mi

agency which

does have the special expertise and it should be one of
the agencies.
But, beyond that.
Q

How about the Department of Interior?

MR, SIiTE:
Q

Pardon?

Would you think the Department of Interior

would also be an agency with expertise?
MR. SIVE;

oh, yes, -that is specifically named, I

think, in the guidelines,

X can check that. Your Honor,

S3
Yes, it is.
Q

Don’t let ras hold you up, for that.

MR.SIVS:
Q

I beg your pardon?

Don't let rae hold up your argument.

MR. SXVE:

Yes, the Department of the Interior is,

and I can submit to Your Honors copies of the April 30
guidelines.
Specific sections — specific departments are
named, and the project agency is directed to go to them, and
the response which comes is directed by the Act and the
guidelines to be in the impact statement.
Now, what happened here is just as the Solicitor
General said.

Certain reviews by certain agencies, including

the SPA, specifically directed by the Act fee ho put into HBPA,
and the CEQ, which, we submit, should have been, and agencies
of the Department of the Interior, not the ones mentioned in
the impact statement, the U. S. Geological Survey.

Those

agencies were funneled into the Under Secretary's committee,
and that was what created the executive privilege problem.
There, however, we and the Circuit Court and District
Court excised all of the military information, we never
ashed for that, and we said, '’Present only the environmental
information", and the question is:

Under the law, was the

Commission correct in talcing the anti-detonation information
and frame ling it to the Under Secretary's committee, and then

64
coming into court and saying# “That8s secret; you may not
look at that”# to which our response was, "Excisa the secret
matter; let’s see the environmental information.”
How# I think this ~ I would submit that merely
naming a committee and setting up a committee # whether it
be set up by Dr. Kissinger or anybody else# doesn’t exempt
what goes to that committee from being in the impact statement#
if the law would otherwise require it.
Nor does it exempt it# per se# from the competency
of the courts to have the information# and therefore from the
scope of discovery under Rule 26.
So X think we come to tills issues
be obeyed here?

Should the law

&nd if it is a fact that there is some kind

of a deadline before us# in that we have one hour and 35
minutes# then I think that one hour and 3S minutes should be
used by all of us to consider whether the Commission obeys
the law, and whether# if we do secure the nuclear deterrents
and the equality# whether it's worthwhile securing if we
disobey the laws# and if the Commission is somehow under a
slightly different obligation to obey law than the humblest
citizen getting his license to sell bananas on a pushcarts
Q

Well# this really — this is the third time

you’ve said it# the issue before us is not "should the law
be obeyed?"# is it?

Isn’t that a distorted way of putting

the issue# to state it — to understate it —•

6S
MR. SXVE:

Forgive me, Your Honor, if I’ve been

overly emotional.
Q

Well, —

MR. S2VE:

I think Your Honor is correct.

But when

•the government talces the position that this Court does not
have the time to look at ‘this, and says that unless the
questions which are raised before this Court, and the
questions which we raised in ©very direct manner before th©
two courts below, when those questions cannot be decided
because the time is short, and the time was shortened by the
Commission and the errors of the District Court, and their
executive privilege overruled by th® Circuit Court of
Appeals, then, I submit, the question is whether, in effect,
they are asking for repeal of the law.
X think that ends the notes which X have, and X
don’t know whether I’ve used as much as the seven minutes of
rebuttal time. Your Honor.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. GRISWOLD:

Fine.

May 1 make one *—

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Solicitor General.

The Environmental Protection Agency

did not exist when the original draft of the impact statement
was sent out.

It was created in 1970.

The impact statement

was sent to, and was replied to by officers of HEW and
Interior, which were later incorporated into the Environmental

Protection Agency
Ite, it is perfectly true that there is no official,
signed by Ruckelshaus, statement here, but the HBW and the
Interior agencies were the ones which were responsible for
this when the original draft was circulated,.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you? Mr. Solicitor

General.
Did you have something to add, Mr. Sive?
MR. SIVE:

2 think one suggestion, Your Honor,

that eases the problem before you:

1 would be willing perhaps

to submit, on the papers which Your Honors have, and the
arguments mads, as the petition for certiorari, if that
eases the problem and makes the mechanics simpler.
If that is done, I would ask leave simply to make
several photostats of perhaps two additional briefs, which
I might get done in the next half hour and bring them to the
Court.
But. whether that eases Your Honors5 problems, I do not

know.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will take that into

account.
Thank you, Mr. Sive,
Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at approximately 11s00 a.m. the case
was submitted.)
