ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. ROBERTS, ESQ,,
OK BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS, WINFIELD DUNN, E3? AL
MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may .it please

the Court:

- .
This is m appeal from a Three Judge District

Court in the Middle District of Tennessee at Nashville, which
struck down the durational residency requirements for voting,
as provided by the State Constitution* and Implemented by
statutos of the legislature.
The tiiao fixed in Tonnesee© for durational
residency requirements was one year in the state, and three
months in the county before the person offers himself to
vote.

Now, the question presented is whether or not such

Constitutional and statutory provisions violate the Equal
Protection Clause of the Xkth Amendment of the United States
Constitution, and whether or not, in determining this, the
doctrine of "irrational or unreasonable" or the "Compelling
State Interest*’ doctrine is to be made applicable in this
kind of a case and for the determination of this case,
At the time this case was decided by the District

Court* and so far as this Counsel has any way of ascertaining
now, thirty-three states and three territories fear© durational
residency requirements of at least the one year* as is the
case in Termesso©*

Fifteen states had a sis months

residency requirement, which is double the county residence
requirement provided for

in' the State of Tennessee*

The

remaining two states had* respectfully, on© ninety days and
the other, throe months, durational residency requirementQ,

Mr* Roberto* have there been any studies made

on widespread or oven a national basis to determine how long
It takes to crank up registrations and that sort of thing,
and to check out to feo sure that the voter isn't’voting in
two states?
HR. ROBERTSt

Ho, sir, not to my knowledge.

If

Your Honor' ploaoo, that's where wo think that the District
Court erred in trying to make such a determination based on
the registration cut-off line of thirty days which applies
in Tennessee and
laws*

in

moot of the states that have registration

But it's our insistence that the Court was in error

there because that cut-off period is designed specifically,
and it is very clearly shown in the law, .to be for the
purpose of permitting the county election officials the
necessary time to make the administration acts that they
are required to.
For ozample, they have to take the master

$
registration list, and then break that down precinct by
precinct, and make duplicates_of it to go out to tho precinct*
They’ve got to nan their advertisements in tho paper, notices
of the election, select all of the judges and officers to
hold tho elections at the precinct level, and it’s a countless
number of things.

Nowhere during that period of time can. the

Election Commission in Tennessee, and I think it*a generally
true everywhere ©Iso, use that period of time to purgo an
ineligible votor.
Therefor©, tho durational residency requirement is
necessary, we feel, in order to give some time for which the
Election Commission can get rid of any ineligible voters,
purge them, as tho case might, be, and them the thirty-day
registration cut-off only for administrativo period and
things

alone,

because* somewhere, there’s got to be a period

of time when tho voter knows that ho is going to bo entitled
to go to the polls and vote, and that is what wo think the
thirty days is for.
Q,

Now, so far as —

What’s been the experience with those

administrative problems in connection with the new Federal
statute on election of President end other Federal elections?
MR. ROBERTS:

If the Court please, wo haven’t had

a Presidential Election since thorn*

We don’t know yet quit©

how it’s going to work out, and I don’t think that
Q,

That’s thirty days, isn’t it?

MR. ROBERTS:
Q.

MR.

Sir?

Thirty days roaidoneo?
ROBERTS:

Yes, sir»

Thirty days registration.

cut-off.
Q,

I gather Tennessee is going to have to

accommodato itself to that for the forthcoming Presidential
Election,, isn’t it?
MR, ROBERTS:

Yes, sir.

Well, Tennessee, if Your

Honor please, already had don© this before the 1970 Voting
Rights Act was passed.

That is on© of the things that I

wanted to point out to the Court,
There arc other ways of doing it besides, in effect,
reinterpreting the llyfch Amendment in order to bring it about.
In Tennessee, anybody that moves from, well, within a precinct,
•or anywhere else in the state, has ninety days in which to
qualify himself in the new area, or, until that period of
time, ho can go back and vote where ho had always voted,
either in person or by absentee ballot.

He la never dis**

enfranch!sod»
Well, the same is true so far as the year and the
1

state is concerned, and by act of legislature, ©von before the
1970 Voting Rights et, we provided that, in Tennessee, any
person leaving that state would maintain his domicile -•
which in Tennessee is the same an legal residence

he would

maintain the domicil© until such time as he acquired a new

?
one, no matter what state he went to.

And we think that

r

that is a sensible way of doing it so that you are protecting
the people that usually would have the most Interest.
Xt takes somo little time.

I think the Court can

take notice of the fact that a person who has lived a number
of years in a county, and then he moves, it’s a little while
that ho would prefer to bo identified back where ho had been
for any period of time, as opposed to immediately entering
into the political arena in a now — aah ~~ new place.
Q

.boos Tennessee have criminal penalties for

voting in Tennessee and voting somewhere else, if it could
be accomplished?
HR. ROBERTS:

Yes, sir, we do.

The problem with

this, though, if you or© going to confine it to the
registration deadlines, for example, is determining whether
or not the person really it a bona fide resident of the
state.

How, the District Court, in striking down the year
ihrea months in the county, did indicat

that they felt that the thirty-day registration deadline was
sufficient to accomplish this, and it has boon argued in the
Opposing Counsels’ brief that anybody thatwould go into the
Registrar’s Office and be willing to make an oath that ho’s a
bona lido resident would also bo willing to make an oath as
well about anything

ole© that would bo necessary to do this,

tout that doesn't follow, because it’s a nebulous sort of

8
thing.

The natter of whether a person is a bona fide

resident is also at decided on the matter of intent.

Now,

he could very well leave —
Q,

Is Tennessee preparing soma sorb of procedure

to deal with this problem in next year's Presidential Elect ion?
MR* ROBERTS?
Q,

Yes, sir, as X --

X moan, do they

as I gather, you are going

to have to permit everybody to vote who has boon thirty days
a resident of Tennessee?
HR. ROBERTS;

Yes, sir, if this Court upholds the

Lower Court's decision, that would be true.
Q.

No, no, I!m speaking only of the Presidential

Election, and am X not correct that that statute
wo sustaiaod, I think, last year, did wo not?

which

— now says

you must let, every stato must let everyone vote who has been
thirty days a resident of the state, in tho Prosidontiai
Election?
MR. ROBERTS;
Q,

Yes, sir.

So X gather you are going to have to accommodate,

Tennessee's going to have to accommodate ita whole system. —
MR. ROBERTS;
Q

Yos, air, that's «~

*« in that ’ requirement *

Have you any plans

underway for doing that?
MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, air, they

are already register-

ang thorn. yon sec, under this Three Judge Court order down

9
thoro, after* the thirty days, if they've been there

ever

thirty days end have satisfied the requirements of being a
bona fide resident*

Now -« so we?ve already had an election —»

since *~
Q.

Since the —

MR* ROBERTS:

— since this was changed» yec, air*

The November general election of last year*
q

And did that create any difficulties?

HR* ROBERTS:

Ho, sir.

Me have no way of knowing

how many fraudulent votes arc cast*
Tennessee.

We have this problem in

It’s a little different from most states in that

we are bounded by eight states, three of our large metro­
politan areas are on tho state lines.

In the case of Memphis,

which io our largest metropolitan area, throe states bound
one that one county, Arkansas, Mississippi and Missouri*
How, ever since the roapportionraant decisions and
the breakdown within the county of legislative seats, for
©sample, took place, tho county has divided into these
various legislative seats based on population, of course,
end. it would take a very few votes to change the outcome of
an election in many of those.

Five House seat changes in

Tennessee would change the complete complexion of the
legislature itself, fox* that matter*
The possibility of colonisation is just too great
a risk, w© feel, to go through just to insure somebody the

10
pight to voto

in

one election» at the very most, before he

would have otherwise become qualified to do so.
How, when you start trying to determino who is
i

going to draw that line, all you have to do is just look at
what's happened

in

the U# S. District Courts already in

regard to it to see that the Court's in no position to do it*
The people, acting through their Constitution, wo fool, arc
in a position to do it.
How, since this Court spoke on the question, there's
at least twelve Federal District Court decisions.

Four of them

sustained the full year's ugh —- residency period*

That Haa

Ohio, Illinois, Arizona and Washington.

Three found the one-

year residency requirement unconstitutional, but upheld
shorter periods*

For example, in the Bur^ case, which is

out in Massachusetts, the first one of thorn, X believe., that
was decided, the court there hold that six months in the
county — double our county residence requirement •— was fine.
and said that there had been no showing of a compelling state
interest to justify the additional six months in the state
and that that, therefor©, was discriminatory against someone
that slight live Just across the stato lino, but bad moved in
and boon there more than six months.
So that'© the situations you had.

In fact, one of

the amazing tilings about this case, when it was heard in
Nashville was the fact that the -

right from the bench, tho

11
Court, forall practical purposes, discounted the three months
question

and Just about ruled from the bench that they

weren’t concerned at all with the throe month».
couldn’t see anything wrong with it.

They

They were only concerned

with whether this year was too long or not, end then, to our
amazement, ’when we get to the opinion, they struck down not
only the one year, but the three months in the county provision,
which could not be discriminatory at any — viewed in any
'light.
Q,

tod that is because, Mr* Roberta, under

existing Tennessee law, you can move into another county and
still vote in the old county?
MR. ROBERTS:
reregistered.

Is that it?

Yes, sir, until such time as you got

In other words, there is no such thing as

cutting a person off

from being able to vote.

We’ve got —

The purge is required to take place ninety days before m
election.

You’ve also got the three months — or ninety days,

roughly ~~ to change from one precinct to another, or from
one county to another, and you can still vote back in the
other one.

How, you can go ahead and register in the now

county as soon as you got there, as long as it would be
three months before there would be an election, but —■
Q

tod then you’d have to vote in the new county?

MR. ROBERTS:
Q

Yes, sir, after the ninety days —

If you moved *— if a man moved from Shelby

12
County to Jackson County in -Tennessee, say, he could continue
to vote in Shelby County so long as he hadn’t registered in
Jackson County for a period of at least ninety days?
MR* ROBERT St

Yes, sir.

In, other words, until

such time as ho would have been eligible in the new county
to vote there.
Q,

To be eligible to register?

MR* ROBERTS:

Yoe, sir.

So ho’a never really

cut off.
Q.

And this is —■ that is existing Tennessee law

of longstanding —
MR. ROBERTS;
Q

~r long before this Court decision, you moon.

MR. ROBERTS;
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, yes, air,

And then you also said that a man can move»

away from the State of Tennessee, and continue to vote in
Tennessee for how long?
HR. ROBERTS;

Until such time as ho establishes

domicile In the new state and becomes eligible to vote there•
Q

And becomes eligible to vote there.

MR. ROBERTS:
q

Yea* sir,

By registering, or

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, sir, whatever their procedure *

'You see, there are a few states that don’t have registration
laws.

Q,

You're not talking simply about absentee

ballots, are you?
MR* ROBERT'S:

Ho, sir.

They could come back and

do it in person or by absentee under our law.

They could

return to Tennessee for it.
Q,

But a man can move *»- let’s say his company

sonde him to Missouri, and he doesn’t know hoi; long he is
going to stay there, and

go

he is living in an apartment,

a motel, and doesn’t plan to make that his home*

or

He can

continue to vote in Tennessee even though he is physically
out of the stato and has been, for a period of weeks or months?
MR. ROBERTS:
inside of the state

Yee, sir.

I’m an example of the

intrastate situation of that kind.

I’ve boon in Nashville now seventeen years, and I still vote
in tho Cumberland Mountains of Pickett County.
ay home.

It’s still

It’s where I think of aa my homo- and where I

expect to return.

And so long as that Is established, the

laws in Tennessee permit that, voting that way.
Q

Yea, because that is — that’s different,

though, from what you told me about changing your homo from
Pickett County to Nashville.

If you changed your home, you

could vote in Pickett County only until you’d registered in
Nashville, isn’t that right?
MR, ROBERTS:
Q,

Yes, sir, if I’d — but I ~~

-If you didn’t make Pickett County your home?

MR-. ROBERT'S:

Q

Yes, ais»

If you’d moved# moved your domicil© £2*01*1

Pickett County to — what!a the county at Nashville?
MR. ROBERTS:
Q

Davidson.

Davidson County, you could continue to vote

in Pickett County for ninety days until you became eligible
and registered to vote in Davidson County.
MR. ROBERTS:
Q,

Yes, sir.

Ivon though you had moved, which you tell us

you have not.
MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, sir.

Now, we — traditionally, the purposes of a
residency requirement as set out in most all logei publica­
tions, and the one I have selected to use here is
from Am.' Jvu..

This

is the

reason

•

for it, tot

Insure the purity of the ballot bom through proper
legislation, by protection against fraud through colonisation
and inability to identify persons offering to vote, and

2} to afford some surety that the voter has, in
fact, become a member of the community and that as ouch, ha
has a common interest in all matters pertaining to its
government and, therefore, is likely to exercise his right
more intelligently.
Now, those are the reasons we say that there is a
need for it.

Then it boils down to how much time, and how

13

'

is the state going to show if wo used the "compelling stato
interest" doctrine, how is the state going to possibly show
that thirty»one days is proper as opposod to forty-five days
°** sixty days?

We just insist that it is a thing that can t

be done, and it’s been recognised by this Court, on all
previous occasions, that this is a proper regulation by the
state, end the state residency -<* duration of residency
requirements has been uphold by this Court in cases hereto*»
fore, in every instance that it has been challenged,
How, the first case, for exemplo, in 1904? Pogo
versus Williams, coming out of Maryland, where they had a
six months in the county, and a year in the state, which is
longer than Tennessee?s duration of residency requirement,
this Court uphold those requirements, and, in doing so,
stated that at that time, they had registration already in
Maryland.

They took notice, this Court did, of the feet that

they had registration there end said, "While we might per­
sonally feel that the one year is too long now, in vicr of
having registration, at the same time, we cannot say that
this io a function of the Court, to take it away »«• the
decision away from the state of Maryland and its people, in
deciding this."
Q

Do you feel that Pope against Hill!gins will bo

overruled if this case is affirmed?
MR. ROBERTS*

Yea, air, and so would Dreudring

versus Bovlin 196k ce.es t*ould necessarily be overruled if
this esco is affirmed*

They aro the two that get directly,

md both o:C them, incidentally* are ft1 cm the Stato of Mary­
land, when® th© on© year* in state and six months in county
was involved.
Q,

Now, in addition to that •«
What if th© state said you had to bo a resided

of th© state for thirty years, and a resident of th© county
for fifteen years before you were- eligible to vote?

Don’t

you think that might bo tko bus.inoas of the courts and -«■
MR. ROBERTS:
Q.

Yes, sir, under the «-

— subject to Constitutional adjudication?

MR, ROBERTS:

Yes, sir, and this Court has said

repeatedly in the past that they used the "unreasonable or
irresponsible" rule in determining it.

Well, if that's done,

I don’t think that — surely th© one year in the state or at
least th© throe months in the county could he considered to
be *****
Q,

lot’s consider to justify a long, long period

like that, we could just cay, "We only want oldtimers arouad
here to vote*" •
MR* ROBERTS:

One year is a «*- is more difficult,

of course* to justify thsn

three months, I would agree, but

at tho came time, I think it is v. question of who io to make
that determination,

Ao wo have found here, the courts in

trying to make it, they wont in ©vary direction.

The twelve-

17
different 0. S. District Canute that have triad to decide?
this, none of them have agreed on what it is, or what it
ought to be, not a single one, except for the four that said
the courts had no business in it in the first place, and
upheld the state durational residency requirements.
0,

Tennessee

it sol? has decided that thirty

days is sufficient for registration purposes, hasn’t it,
through its own legislature?
ME. ROBERTS:

Yes, sir, for registration.

That’s

the cutoff for registration, hut the purpose, that’s what I
was attempting to explain awhile ago, the purpose for having
that cutoff was not the same purpose that you obtain from
having a durational residency requirement, because that is
to chock the eligibility of the voters.

If, in that last

thirty days, while you are trying to get an election ready to
go with all the appointment of the officials, the ballot»
prepared, the machines serviced, and everything like that, if
the election commissioners attempted to, at that time, try to
get into the ©llgibllit

voters, many, many vote?:

would probably got disenfranchised because they’d have no
opportunity to overcome it before tho election,

go

that this

matter — excuis© me, sir.
Q,

X was going to ask, is Mr. Blums t ©in attacking

tho thirty day provision also, as well as tho three months
provision here?

16
MR. ROBERTS:

Ho. sir, the District Court

rooogniscd that thirty days was all right, but they didn’t —
Q,

Ho can’t very well attack it, because ho

brought a suit within the thirty dayb of hi a assuming his
rosl&oncy.
Efto ROBERTS:
Q

Yea, sir*

All right *

J'3R* ROBERTS:

We would respectfully insist that the""

all of tha previous cases are on the Appellants» side in
this matter, not only of the cases that X have cited, where
this Court dealt directly with the proposition, but also
in interpreting provisions under the 10th Amendment, and in
other casco, this Court has used, the durational

residency

requirement, or residency power of a state for voting as
examples of state power that is still left to it.
How, that was true in gramor versus Union Free,...
School District, just as late as 1969*

The only thing that

the IT. S* District Court could have gotten their key from
was when this Court granted or noted probable jurisdiction
in Hall versus Beals coming out of Colorado, which lator mo
dismissed as being moot.
How, there1 o no

other law that the Court -«* that

the District Courts could be using other than that.
second-guessing this Court, and that’s all

They arc

all the basis

or authority that they could have for holding the way they

19
have in. this case.
2 just want to say one other things and then I’m
going to close, and that is- in 1970, Mr. Chief Justice in
Walz versus Tax Commissioner 0v the City of Hew York emoted
from an old ~~ tho old Jactaaon case, whore Ms. Justice Holmes
said, "If a thing lias boon practiced for two hundred year a
oj common consent, it will need a strong case for tho

Fourteenth Amendment to affect it."
Wo think that’s what you have hero.

Ycu have all

of tho states fixing residential *•** residency requirements,
and it’s boon that way for a long time, and itfa not
not just antiquated provisions.

it’s

In tho case of Tennessee, X

did want to point this out, that Adversary Counsel insists,

and the Court has even hinted toward it in their opinion,
that tho registration laws took the place of the residency

requirements in Tennessee, end that was its stated purpose,
and that that was a later law.

In

Well, that’s not true.

1953 ie when the people had a chance to relook

at the durational residency requirements in Tennessee and
their Constitution, and they did retain the one year in the
state, but it was at that time that the sin months in the
county was lowered to throe months.

So that it ie not an

antiquated provision, and it’s one that clearly shows that
tho people there want, in their Constitution, some protection
against voter fraud, and that they put it in there after they

20
had registration.

There could be no serious argument that

the registration law and the thirty day cutoff there did a -*«•
does away with any purpose to bo served by durational
residency requirement, because that .just isn’t the case.
X might

have just a abort rebuttal.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Roberts.

Mr. Blumstoin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. BLTJMSTBBl', ESQ.,
033 BEHALF OF COMMON CAUSE, AMICUS CURIAE.
AND HIMSELF, APPELLEE .
MR. ELUMSTEIN5

Mr* "Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
1 think It is important to understand, as a first
measure that this case does not involve the question of
residency.

There is no question In. this case that I

bona fide resident of the state.

:vn

a

The state has conceded this

throughout, and the District Court found this'as a fact.
There in no question that X met the standards of
domicile that Tennessee imposes as its standard of residence.
So the state's argument entirely has been pitched to the
fact that there is a question of residency here.This is not a
question

of

question of residency.

This is a

an additional, separate factor, end that Is, a

calendar waiting period beyond the bona fid© residency
criteria.

There is currently

in

Tennessee — the Law

ax
Revision Comi» a ion of Tennessee ia currently under a mandate
of the legislature to revise the election code, and a specific
section of that tentative draft, the revision, goes to the
question of defining bona fide residence.

Tennessee is

now planning to adopt the standards of New Mexico, setting
out several indicia and criteria of determining bona fidereaidonce.

The duration of residence is a separate category.

It is not within on© of those factors.

So I just want to

mice that perfectly clear at tho outset.
Q.

But, by tho same token, 1 gather, Mr. KLumstein,

you are not asserting that a state is Constitutionally
required to let every single resident who is qualified by
age -?oto, arc you?

Because a per

can toco:

under the law, in loss than twenty-four hours, and bo in the
ition to live elsewhere, and tt
happen within a matter of hours.

Are you contending that tho

Constitution, requires tho stato to permit every resident of
Tennessee who is eighteen years old or over, and otherwise
qualified, to vote?
MR, BLtUMSTEIN?

Me*. Justice Stewart, there are

several points that I can make in response to that.

First,

there is a thirty day cutoff period for registration.
Q

There is, but I ost asking you

a matter of state statute «—
MR. ELUMSTEIN:

Yes, sir.

there is, as

2S
Q,

-* but X om esking you about what your

Const it utional claim is.
MR. BLUMSTBIEf *.

If a parson comes into the

State

of Tennessee, and establishes domicile, according to the
relevant Tennessee standards, you5d look at whether ho has
become a domicil® for tax purposes, you'd look at whether he
beccmeo a dom3.c5.lo for purposes of his driver's license, his
automobile registration, and so forth*

Xf he meets those

criteria, those are separate independent criteria that the
Election Commission and the county registrars are entitled to
investigate*
If, after their Investigation at the time of
registration, it is their conclusion that the new resident
is a bona fid© resident# then it is my contention that there
is a discrimination that this Court must then review under
the "compelling interest" standard.

Just showing of the

discrimination, Tour Honor, is not the answer to the Constitu­
tional question*

At that point, it triggers a strict

Constitutional standard of review, and then wo must go into
the policy questions that the state articulates to support
this discrimination♦
So my answer to your question, then, is, yes, it
does trigger strict review, end no, tho state has not made —
Q,
triggered.

I didn't ask you what kind of review it
I asked you whether your claim is that tho state

23
ic compelled to permit every bona fide resident of Tennessee
who is over eighteen, years old to vote •-

MR, HLUMSTEIN‘
Q,

Unless it’s -«

And I point out that, as a matter of law,

quit© apart from these evidentiary indicia

» driver’s

Justice Stewart’s question that you are attacking the thirty
day provision?
MR* BLUMSTE1H:

No, Your Honor, Justice Blackman,

26
there ia — the thirty-day provision is not discriminatory.
This applies equally to all residents of the state.

The

only issue under attack hero is the discriminatory aspect.
So there is no — this is am administrative period that the
stato has said is necessary to prepare voter lists and do
other administrative matters prior to an election.

It was

this thirty-day period, by the way, that the District Court
rolled upon to deny the preliminary injunction in this case.
The hearing occurred on July the 30th in the
District Court, and the primary election was sot for August
the 6th♦

It was only one week later.

And the Court refused

to interfere, not because it said the thirty days — the three
month period was reasonable, hut becau.se they thought it would
bo judicially improper.
Q.

I'm sorry, but I understood your answer to

one of the questions was that if you moved into Tennessee
today, and bought a house, you could present yourself at the
polling place and vote at 5*00 p,m.
HR* BLUMSTEIH:

Provided that you wore within —

the thirty day — provided the registration books were open,
which only occurs more than thirty days before the election.
"What I'm — Hr. Justice Blackicm, the position that Appellee

statistics.

Yell, this flies in the face of census

Americans aro extremely mobile people.

Over

the course of a very few years, the entire character of a
community may change.

Communities are in no souse stable

in the United States.
Each year, for example, more than thirteen million
people move from one county to another, end of those, more
than seven million move from one state to another,

This

represents en annual interstate migration almost the size of
the City of Hew York.

Moreover, of those, almost four million,

five hundred thousand people of voting age, adults, who move
from one state to another, are disfranchised.

29
'In addition* census figures estimate that the total
disfronchisemant from these residency periods is five million,
five hundred ninety thousand people, throughout the United
States.

This is a staggering figure, and it represents about

7*7 percent of the total vote cast in the 1968 Presidential
Election.
q

Does that figure includo an assumption against

fact, that everybody votos?
MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Your Honor, is it the 7*7 figure?

Yes.

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

That was a percent of the actual

Q,

Well, I'm talking about the people that moved

from state to state.

MR.

BLUMSTEIN:

that assumption.

Ho, Your Honor, that does make

The census refines that figure in. a

questionnaire they asked people who uiero potentially dis­
franchised, who wore not eligible to vote because of these
durational residency requirements, and census figures show
that throe million and twenty-two thousand of those numbers
would have, according to the questionnaire, would have
participated in the election.

The figure is smallor when

you only look at those who would have participated.
Q,

Well, could I go a little smaller than that,

that some people wouldn't admit that they wouldn't vote?

30
What I’m saying is, why stretch those figures no far?
MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Well, it is possible, Your Honor,

as tho Amicus points out, that this might -- that it might
overstate tho actual disfranchisement of those who would
vote.

However, I would like to point out in this regard,

one of the characteristics of the class of now residents are
that they typically have higher education levels.

They tend

to have finished high school more frequently than the normal
than the rest of the population, and that they tend to have
been at least to some college to a significant degree more
than the rest of the population.
There is also evidence to show, Your Honor, that
people who have higher degrees of education, who typically
find themselves in white collar and professional occupations
tend to participate more frequently in the election process,
and, therefore, I think, the figure is not as overstated as
it might seem on its face.

The new residents, 1 think,

typically do participate, as a group, more, because of these
characteristics.
Q

Hr. Blumstoia —

MR. BLUMSTEIHt
Q,

Yes, sir.

You're all registered now, and ready to go,

aren't you, in Tennessee?
MR, BLUMSTEIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

The District

Court order was handed down on September 9th, X9?0, and

31
sine® that time two general elections end one primary
election have been held in the State of Tennessee.

It

might be interesting to add that Tennessee was a major
political battleground in 1970s where former Senator Gore
was defeated by the incumbent Senator Brock.

This was an.

election of nationwide significance, and since th5.s decision
was one of the earliest handed down by the District Courts
involving durational residency, there was no question that
it got widespread dissemination among all the neighboring
states and Tennessee, and there was ample opportunity for
colonization and the other fraudulent devices that the state
refers to, and there was no evidence whatsoever that was
reported to m© of any problems in this regard.
To be sure, the Registrar of Davidson County did
make the statement that she’d have to insert a bicycle rack
in front of her county courthouse, but this is the kind of
armchair assertion that’s not backed up by any data at all.
There was-no evidence whatsoever of fraud, there
were no — there was no data that the state has brought to
boar on this question.
In discussing the Constitutional claim, it Is
essential to look at tho alternatives that the state has
in order to prevent fraud, since w© seem to have focused on
fraud.

The voter registration system was not

fact.

The District Court found this as a

There is no interest that the state is protecting by

duration of residency that cannot be protected in determining
bona f3.de residency at the time of registration.

There is

no additional protection that the period of durational
residency provides at all, and the state, just this morning,
in fact, in discussing the need to purge voters and eo forth,
does not go to the question of why, at the time of registra­
tion, the stato cannot make a determination of bona fide
residence*

This is the role of registration*
In fact, there ore figures to indicate that tha

system of voter registration itself has raised a great
obstacle to voter turnout.

The voter turnout in the last

three Presidential Elections didn't match at all what voter
turnout wan prior to votor registration laws being enacted,
and there’s a study that shows, in the 18805s and 1890’a,
voter participation was at a much higher level than voter
participation is now.
How, Appellee does not argue that voter registration
is an impermissible bar on the franchise, but what Appellee
does assert is that the only justification for this disfran­
chisement is that it doss prevent voter fraud, but that that
is a significant enough price to pay for prevention of fraud,

33
arid that there is no nood to have an additional penalty
ixapoaed, and that is the durational residency previsions.
Moreover, there ar© »*•

There is a specific

provision of the Tennessee Code, Section 2-2209, which makes
colonisation a criminal penalty, a felony, and imposes a
minimum term of two yearn and a maximum term of five years
for bringing in voters from out of state.

There ore similar

provisions, Tennessee Cod© £-161,Lj. makes it a felony to vote

the Tennessee Cod© which make it a misdemeanor to vote when
not legally entitled to veto.

This io another way that the state's interest can bo protooted in this way*
In short, these durational residency requirements
add nothing, nothing in a significant way towards improving
ths state's purity of the election system*

But you're going to overrule it anyway?

MR, BLuMSTEBT:

believe, if it please the Court, that there are certain
factual distinctions which also help distinguish the case*

to distinguish it or to overrule it, either one?
MR, BLUMSTEESs

I

nae just pointing out that there are factual distinctions.
Q

Wall, there always are.

There aro novor two

cases alike, but X wanted to pin down your approach on
Pone v. Williams, whether you felt it could stand to bo

take it it is the latter that you are asking v.n to do,
HR. BLUMSTEBTi

Are you drawing any technical distinction

between the two?
MR. SLuMSTSIK:

Ho, sir» that's a slip on my part.

The Tennessee courts have defined thorn as the same.
Q,

Well, what you're challenging is the right

of Tennessee to say that they want people who aro politically
mature in relationship to the issues and the candidates.

Is

that it?
MR. BLUMSTEBi:

Yea, air.

Tennessee is arguing

that this period, this one year and the three month period
is necessary for becoming knowledgeable about the candidates.
1 think it is interesting to note in this regard, sir, that the
figures that Amicus Curiae brought to bear out Cossaon Cause
in the case, and I think it's recognised that the California
case, in striking down its duration of residency noted that
the campaigns typically now are conducted through the media,
end tho data that Common Cause showed — that within the last
thirty days, candidates spent from between seventy to eightyfive percent of their dollar for advertising, within this

39
last thirty day period*
Q

Is that true on bond issues, for example?

MR* BLUK5TEIN:

The data do not show ~~

Constitutional Amendments, and things of that

kind?
<*

MR* HLUMSTEIN:

Sir, the data do not shew, one way

or another.
Q

I suppose wo could take judicial notice that

money Is not spent that way, generally speaking, .on bond
issue problems that are submitted to the voters,

Would you

agree with that?
MR. BLUMSTEIU:

I’m not sure that I understand

Your Honor’s point.
Q

Well, you were placing a groat deal of weight

Cn someone making a survey that most of the money that a
candidate spends is spent in the last thirty days, on tele­
vision, et cetera.

I was simply asking whether the asm.

thing is true with respect to a bond issue which is being
submitted to the voters.
■MR* BLUM3TE1H:

Oh, as far as ascertaining the

relevant factors behind the bond issue, again, I think that
there’s no indication why a long-time resident Is necessarily
more knowledgeable about the factors Involved than someone
who is a now resident, although 1 don’t have any figures about
the advertising expenditures.

In sum, the state has not shown that its Interest
In this case is compelling that durational residency require­
ments are required to prevent fraud or to insure knowledgeability.

The case falls comfortably within the rationale

that this Court has articulated

In

the Kramer case and within

tho Shapiro against Thompson case as far as interstate travel
is concerned.

Both of those fundamental rights are infringed

in thia case, and, therefore, the strict standard of review
is triggered.

Under this strict standard of review, the

state has not act its burden of showing that its interests'
are compelling.

On© of the things that I wish to point out Is the
distinction that Adversary Counsel has attempted to make
between the time elements of durational residence and saying
that, thirty days, there would fee no &1 ocriraination, but
somehow or other reading into it that ninety days in the
county would bo.
I submit that there is no discrimination there as
found in the Burg case coming out of Massachusetts.
would be applicable to everybody.

This

There is no discrimination

at all in it; anybody whether he'd lived in the state before
or not, after three months In the county where he proposes to
vote, would bo entitled to do so.
How, a little better case could be made out in
behalf of what he has alleged in regard to the one year in
the state, because there you could bo discriminated against
Just by virtu© of the fact that you lived across the state
line, or even though you worked back and forth during the
year, and then moved in for the three months preceding an.
election and satisfied the county requirement, but would not

have satisfied the state requirement •
Now, there was one other thing that I did wish to
pc*~- •'■■■“• to the Court, and that is the obvious intent of
Congress in this matter.

As the Court is aware, the 1970

Voting Rights Act Amendment originally contained ?. provision.
that would have abolished the durational residency require­
ments in all ©lections.
It was Congress* decision to remove that.
rejected this proposal.

They

Yot, despite that, somehow or other,

our District Court, in its opinion,

has read into that an

interpretation that Congress really is supporting th© pro­
position of abolishing residence requirements, when, actually,
they had it in their Bill and then took it out on their own.
At peg© 9 of his brief, the Appellee, in discussing
whether or not the voter wait5.ng period is beneficial in
wooding out ineligible voters, concludes that anyone who is
willing to swear falsely that h© is an eligible voter would
just as readily swear falsely that he had been in th© state
a year, and in the county three months.
Well, that just doesn't necessarily follow at all.
Th© second oath could be proven much more easily than the
other one®

All of th® precinct workers at an election ar©

local to the voting precinct, the judges, and the officers,
and all, are local people.

For purposes of identity, they

can challenge any voter that comes up, even on election day,

if they have an opportunity to know that that person hasn’t
been in the community that long.

They can challenge him,

and the election comission decides itself, then, whether
he really is entitled to cast that ballot, but there’s no
other way except for having a time element involved in a
community, I submit, that for local people to bo able to
pull out the illegal voter.
How, this could be a very serious thing in connection
with tho question of mobility.

That’s a two-edged sword, not

only is there a lot more people moving intrastate and inter­
state as a result of tho type of society that vie now have,
but that also goes the other way, too, and it offers an
opportunity for a type of fraud that heretofore couldn’t have
existed..

X submit that Mr. Ed. Crump in his day in my state .

would havo had a field day out of a thirty-day cutoff deadlino and no other residence requirements for voters.

That’s

just tho way it works.
I had the opportunity, a few years ago, to be
state election coordinator in ay home state, and while that,
I organised a statewide association of county election
commissioners, and I heard ©very kind of complaint, and 1
submit that if there is any way of stealing the elections,
somebody has got a way figured out how» to do it, and every
time we open a gate like this end let fraud, get into our
elections, than the republican form of government that our
