ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in -No. 71-5097, Huffman against Boer sen.
Hr. Exsenstatt, you may proceed whenever you’re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEO EISENSTATT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. EISENSTATT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is on petition for writ of certiorari
from the Supreme Court of the State of Nebraska and involves
in .its essence several questions involving the annulment of
a marriage, a determination of paternity, and the allowance
or granting or the violation thereof, of the right to be
present at trial.
These proceedings now before the Court commenced
by the filing of a petition for annulment in the District
Court of Hall County, Nebraska, Grand Island, approximately
in the middle of the state.

The defendant in that case, the

petitioner here, Harold Eugene Huffman, was at that time
incarcerated in the state penitentiary in Lincoln, Nebraska,
approximately 110 miles away.
Throughout the proceedings, Mr. Huffman appeared
pro jse until the appointment of counsel by this Court in
response to his request for a writ

of certiorari.

The essential facts as we view them Would be that
on March 5. 1969 these two parties, Harold Eugene Huffman
and Faye Boersen, were married in Las Vegas, Nevada.

At that

time the parties had been living in Hamilton County,
adjoining Hall County, in a small town known as Giltner,
Nebraska.
At that time there had been filed by Faye a
petition for divorce from a marriage contracted, according to
the record, with a Richard A. Boersen. and with respect to
whom there were two children at that time of the marriage.
And 1 will get into the facts in a little more detail.
The petitioner's view of the issues in this case
are in two general areas and that is, was the equal protection
of the laws violated with respect to the petitioner by reason
of the dismissal of his appeal in that annulment case by the
Nebraska Supreme Court because he failed to file a seventy-five
dollar cost security bond or cash in lieu thereof?

And,

secondly, ware his rights to be present at the trial violated
when he was incarcerated at the state penitentiary at the
time of the trial?
The facts are not in dispute; and although there
are lengthy pleadings on file, a distillation of those facts,
in our opinion, do not make the facts very complicated.
Before referring to these additional facts, I would
like to footnote Nebraska provisions dealing vfifch the matter

of appeal.
in.

Since its founding,- the State of Nebraska has had

its Bill of Rights a provision guaranteeing the right of

appeal in all civil cases; Article X, Section 24 provides the
right to be heard in all civil cases in the court, of last
resort by appeal or otherwise shall not be denied.

And as

announced by a long line of Nebraska cases, more particularly
as it applies to this case, and we've cited in our brief the
case of Perfaer v„ leise which held that this right of appeal
exists irrespective of the merits or the lack thereof in the
court or in the record.
In other words, they take the position that our
Supreme Court should not consider a case until it has been
properly presented and not try to anticipate whether or not
the appeal is frivolous or has some substance.
Now, the record shows that Faya had been married or
entered into a marriage ceremony with Richard Hoarsen in
June of '64, and she had filed an action for divorce—well,
there were two of them, but the one involved was in February
of '69.

And in that action Boersen had filed a countersuit.

Then on March 5th, as I stated, she married the petitioner
in Las Vegas,

Nevada.

And about a month and a half later,

April 24th, the divorce decree was entered.

In October of

that year, '59, she gave birth to a child, a child which the
petitioner claims paternity and is also one of the issues
involved in this case.

6
In November of 1970. Faye filed the petition for
annulment in the Hall County District Court-

Huffman was

incarcerated in the state penitentiary on November 9th. The
sheriff of Lancaster County, pursuant to our local procedure,
served a summons.

He was allowed in to serve a summons on

the petitioner and service in return was made of that fact.
In the pleadings that followed—-as I said, all filed
by Huffman pro se—by the way, Mr. Huffman is the inmates’
legal assistant at the Nebraska penitentiary.

A review of

the record in this case would indicate some expertise and
knowledge on his part that might not be possessed of an
ordinary layman.
Among the pleadings filed, he raised the issue of
denial of a right to annulment; he raised the issue and
claimed the right to be found the father of his child born in
October of '69; and he also demanded in several pleadings the
right to be present at any trial.

He had also advised the

court that he was without funds and had no counsel.
The record is undisputed that at. about that time
Mr.. Huffman had approximately $114 of resources,, and this has
been stipulated and admitted.
The case, as I said, was filed in November.

In

March of '71. Faye’s attorney ax parte asked the court to set
the case for trial, which was perfectly in line with open
procedure.

The case was set for trial on March 26th.

Huffman

was given notice of that trial again by the Sheriff of
Lancaster County,, who served this upon him on the 22nd day
of March.

On that salts day Mr. Huffman wrote a letter to the

judge, which appears in the appendix on page 48, stating that
he had just received this service, which was four days prior
to the trial, that he had no counsel, and again renewed his
demand to be present.
In a prior document which he filed, called a motion
for appearance, he had advised the court of the same facts
and further advised the court that all it took was a simple
order by the court to have the warden produce Mr. Huffman at
his trial on the annulment in Grand Island.
On March 26th trial took place, and a decree or
order of annulment was entered.

Huffman’s pleadings were

all dismissed, held for naught.

On April 9th Huffman filed

his notice of appeal, and this is all in accordance with
Nebraska procedure? and he paid a twenty-doliar docket fee,
which is also required by our statute.

He also filed

precipes for the preparation of a transcript, preparation of
a bill of exceptions, which were prepared.

The transcript

by the clerk, the bill of exceptions by the court reporter,
and these ell appear in the appendix.
Section 25-1914

of our Nebraska statutes, among

other things, requires that the cost security of $75 be filed.
Our Nebraska statutes have, as I think most states do,

s
requirements which must- be followed in order to lodge an
appeal in the Nebraska Supreme Court,

The notice of appeal

and the twenty-dollar docket fee are denominated as
jurisdictional.
Q

Was there any argument before the Supreme

Court of Nebraska?
MR. EXSENSTATT:
Q

No, Your Honor»

This is all on papers?

MR. EXSENSTATT:
1 wish to withdraw that.

This was all on documents.

Well,

Mr. Dowding did appear at the

argument in the Supreme Court, but Mr. Huffman did not.

He

I haven't gotten to that point,

but iii the Supreme Court the—
Q

Was Boddie v. Connecticut argued to the—

MR. EXSENSTATT:

No, sir.

It was raised, however,

by Mr. Huffman in his pleadings.
As I said, he filed the precipes, he filed the
notice of appeal and the twenty-dollar docket fee.

Statute

requires within 30 days of that date the cost security be
filed.
On May 19th Faye's attorney filed a motion in the
Supreme Court of Nebraska to dismiss the appeal for failure
to file the cost security.
Q

Hr, Eisenstatt, as a matter of practicality,

how much protection is a. seventy-five dollar bond in a

Nebraska practice?

What do the average costs amount to, in

excess of that?
HR» EISENSTATTj
Honor.

Very much in excess of that, Your

In my own personal experience even a small brief .is

over $200 , and most of the time they are three and four hundred
dollars at present prices.

The Supreme Court has a rule which

provides for reimbursement at $2.60 a page, which comes to
$1.35»
Q

Can the appellee tax the cost of his brief on

the Supreme Court of Nebraska?
MR. EISENSTATT:

The winning party in the appeal

gets reimbursement for 75 pages times $2.60, which is taxed
as cost.

Only the appellant, however, must file a cost

security.
Q

And the purpose of the cost inures to the

benefit of the other party, the appellee in this case?
MR. EISENSTATT:

That's right, because statutory

costs as far as the state are concerned in appeal are taken
care of with the twenty-doliar docket fee.
Q

What is the actual cost of printing a brief

per page out in Omaha and Lincoln?
MR. EISENSTATT:

In excess of $3, three and a quarter

and then cut to four, depending on which printer, at least in
Omaha

where 1 practice.
0

As a rule, $2.SO a page is reasonably moderate.

10
MR. EISENSTATT:

Q

Very moderate.

What about the seventy-five dollar statute

which Mr. Justice White raised? how old or new is that
statute?
MR. EISENSTATT:

That statute has been on our books

since the turn of the century.

Q

We have interrupted you.

MR. EISENSTATT:

That's quite all right,

I would

like to respond to the questions as they're raised.
Q

Could I ask one more, then?

Somewhere in

here, I have the impression that there is a statement that
relief from printing cannot be obtained in the Supreme Courtpractice.

Is this a rule in your state?
MR. EISENSTATT:

There is a provision, Your Honor,

in the rules of the Nebraska Supreme Court which, provide that
the—Rule 9a of the Supreme Court, which is quoted on page 5
of our brief provides in part, "All briefs shall be printed
unless otherwise allowed by the Court on good cause shown."
Q

I think perhaps in the opposition’s papers

there was an intimation that at least she had to have her
briefs printed and could get no relief, and I wondered about
the accuracy of that statement.
MR. EISENSTATT:

I agree with that statement, based

upon the background and the experience of our Nebraska Court
to date.

The provision for waiver or some kind of

11
amendment that that refers to, I have no knowledge of any
ease where that has been waived or there has been any change
about, it or even a provision for payment on the installment
plan, for example.

It wouldn’t be for payment on the

installment plan; that would be up to the printer
petition or the. appellant.

in the

But the waiver to provide typed

briefs has not, to my experience, been permitted and in my
own knowledge, as far as the Bar Association is concerned,
we’ve attempted on several occasions to get that rule
amended without success.

That, of course, is outside the

record.
When Faye's attorney filed the motion to dismiss
the appeal for failing to supply the cost security, Huffman
was given notice by mail and he at that time filed an
objection, a document entitled an objection, he filed a motion
to proceed in forma pauperis? he filed an affidavit and also
filed a motion to stay the mandate if the court ruled against
him so he couId. ledge a petition for writ of certiorari in
this Court.
The appeal was dismissed without opinion; just an
order entered in their journal.

And on June 14th there was

a hearing at which Faye’s attorney was present.

And I might

advise the Court that at the time involved, Mr. Huffman had
ordered a brief from the Gant Publishing Company in Lincoln,
Nebraska at a cost of $88.58, which had to be paid in advance.

So, after he paid the twenty-dollar docket fee and after he
he.d paid the printer his $88.58, he had less than $5 left to
his name, which is set forth in his affidavit.
Q

Mr. Eis@nst.att, did the Nebraska decision

indicate that dismissal is automatic upon failure to file the
seventy-five dollar bond, or does the Supreme Court on
occasion exercise some sort of discretion?
MR. EXSENSTATTs

There is no case in the state

where a waiver has been granted,

There are one or two

decisions only, Your Honor, that have ruled on this and other
requirements, and all have bean to the effect that these
are reasonable requirements and that the appeal be dismissed.
Q

So that so far as Nebraska lav/ is concerned,

the failure to file the bond would be an automatic ground
for dismissal?
MR. EISENSTATT:

Yes.

Although it isn't classified

as jurisdictional, as the notice of appeal end the twentydollar docket fee, it has the same effect.

You are dismissed

from your appeal if you do .not comply with it.

And there has

been at least one case where a dismissal has occurred because
of this.

There are very few decisions, one or two at most.
The rule involved in this case, for which petitioner

•seeks redress at this Court, stems mainly from the rule in
Boddie Vo Connecticut decided by this Court in March of last
year.

The Court in Boddie was careful to announce that it

13
was deciding the case only on the basis of the fact that it
was a marital situation, allowance of an indigent to file a
divorce petition.

And because the state exercised control

over the marital relationship and its dissolution, it held
that this case than merited the application of the rule that
had long been effect with respect to criminal cases.

On that

basis alone, we have a similarity here in our Huffman case.
We have an annulment and a matter of determination of
paternity.

The issue, of course, goes one step further, and

that is the matter of appeal, and it is petitioner's opinion
that the rule of Griffin v. Illinois, decided in 1956, is
applicable here and also in the cases which have followed
Griffin.

Griffin held that an indigent in a criminal case

was entitled to have a transcript furnished by the state if
he could not afford it, in order to provide him with an
appeal.
As the Court pointed out, appeal is not required.
But if the state allows appeals as a general practice and
in its rules and procedures, then it cannot as a matter of
equal protection of the law deny the same rights to
indigents.

And there has been a host of cases following

Griffin in the criminal field, and the rule has been amplified.
For example, Williams v. Oklahoma City, decided in '69 by
tills Court extended the Griffin rule to a quasi-criminal case,
which was a violation of a city ordinance, 90-day jail

14
sentence and a small fine»
free transcript»

It also involved the issue of

And then in December of this year, in

Mayer v. Chicago, this Court extended the Griffin rule to a
misdemeanor case which involved a fine only»

And based upon

Boddifif which extended the right of access to the courts in
a marital situation, we feel mandates the application of
Griffin and its progeny to this case»
Q

Do you see any legal significance in what at

least appears to be a factual distinction here, that this
bond is not something that is going to pay for something
that the appellant has but is to reimburse* the other party
for an expense that they have incurred?
MR. EISENSTATT:

I realise that this is a

distinction, but in our opinion this is a distinction without
a difference.

First of all it is state action.

is a minimal protection.

Secondly , it

Thirdly, it makes no difference, as
, i

we see it, whether the cost requirement in the handling •' of
the case is to pay a fee which is state action or to pay a
printer, which again is individual action, or to pay a cost
security.
In Lindsey against Normet which was just recently
decided by this case, I think this Court has answered that
question, and we must keep in mind in Lindsey that there were
Q

Which way did we decide it?

MR. EISENSTATT:

You decided that the double appeal

15
is not valid and as a. matter of equal protection of the law
could not be imposed upon attempt.
Q

h double bond, yes.

MR. EISENSTATT:
Q

Yes.

But didn't we decide that the litigant could be

forced to protect a landlord against loss of rent?
MR. EISENSTATT:
ed

That's right­

To protect the landlord against loss, he would

have to pay money into court to protect the 1andloragainst
the loss—
MR. EISENSTATT:

The court was addressing itself

to protection of property—that is, the tenant was occupying
the—
Q

Oh, it was protecting the landlord against

financial loss from the litigation.
MR. EISENSTATT:

Well, but it did not address

itself*—you're talking about the initial requirement of
paying rent during the pendency of the action.
Q

That's right, in the court, yes.

And the only

reason to do it was to protect the landlord from economic
loss.
MR. EISENSTATT:

But it applied to a particular

situation, Your Honor, and dealt with property that the
tenant was occupying.

This case and the matter of cost are

not opposites, are not consistent with the same.

There you

16
have protection or, as the rule stated, protection of the
property of the landlord or to protect a judgment secured.
You don’t have that here»
Q

You say that it5 a not unconstitutional or

that it's unconstitutional for the state to insist that
litigants proect those whom they sue against the costs the
other parties will—where the plaintiff at least is an
indigent.
MR. BISENSTATTs
access to the courts.
position in Boddie,

That's right, if it denies him

This has already been the Court's
There was no requirement there so far

as protecting the other party.

And here in Beadle there is

a waiver of the filing fees which the state may require as
well as what the sheriff requires.
Q

Do you think the state would also have to

relieve non-indigents from the obligation to pay the other
partyv s costs?
MR. EXSENSTATT:

Not necessarily.

And there is

another thing, Your Honor, I’d like to point out in that
regard.

In the filing of the original petition, the State

of Nebraska does not require a bond to protect the defendant
if the plaintiff loses.
must file this.

In the appeal only the appellant

There is no cost security given to the

appellee,
Q

Isn't that a fairly common practice among all

17
the states though to say that once the litigation has come to
a decision in the trial court that then the burden shifts
in effect so far as securing cost?
MR. EISENSTATT:

Yes, it's very common, and it is

a—and we do not attack the essential validity of that.
agree that this is a valid exercise of state rights.

We

But

when it prevents the indigent from coming into court or getting
their rights of appeal without any regard to the merits, then
it is an invidious discrimination which the Constitution
proscribes.
Q

But couldn't they allow both sides to proceed

on typewritten papers under that rule?
MR. EISENSTATT;

They could, Your Honor.

And

that was suggested by Mr. Dowding in his answer brief.
0

What happens to your argument then?

If they

\

had done that, you wouldn't have your argument, would, you?
MR, EISENSTATT:

Well, then there wouldn’t be a

need for a cost security either.

The only purpose that the

cost security—
Q

That was my whole point,

if you allowed both

sides to proceed on typewritten papers, the problem wouldn't
arise because they wouldn’t dismiss it then, would they?
MR. EISENSTATT:
Q

No, Your Honor.

But they did.

to file to the bar.

They did dismiss it for failure

18
MR. EISENSTATT:

Right.

But the court does not

permit the filing of typewritten briefs in the State of
Nebraska.
Q

1 thought the rules said, under extreme

circumstances or something they would,
MR, EISENSTATT:

I know that the rule says that,

Your Honor, but I know of no case where the court has ever
done it.
Q

My whole point is that the court had a choice,

it seems to me, of exercising its discretion under its own
rules not to print.

And if they exercised that discretion,

then there would be no need for the security bond.
MR. EISENSTATT:

That's right.

The only thing that

the bond protects is the brief printing costs of the appellee.
Q

Did you ask for a waiver?

MR. EISENSTATT:

My client did not, Your Honor,

He

asked to proceed in forma pauperis in a general way without
specifically referring to this provision.
Q

Without specifically asking for a waiver of

the cost bond.
MR. EISENSTATT:

Right.

He asked generally for the

right to proceed in forma pauperis.
Q

Is it possible, then, that this case comes

down to the claim of abuse of discussion of the Supreme Court
of Nebraska rather than the constitutional issue?

MR. EISENSTATTt

1 would say no, Your Honor, on the

basis of the experience of the Nebraska court not ever
varying from its rule requiring printed briefs.
Q

The rules permit them to do it.

MR, EISENSTATT:

They could# yes, Your Honor, they

could.
Q

So that there would be no problem if they had

been asked to exercise their discretion to waive and had
granted the request; is that correct?
MR. EISENSTATT:
is no discretion.

No.

As to the cost bond, there

As to the printing of the briefs, there

would be.
Q

But if there is no printed brief, would they

need the cost bond?
MR, EISENSTATT:

The statute 25-1314 does not give

them that discretion.
Q

What if the motion had been made?

had been there.

Suppose you

You would have made such a motion, X am sure,

And then assume for the moment what we do not know, and that
is that the Supreme Court of Nebraska would grant, the waiver
of printing and you were allowed to file typewritten briefs.
Would you then need a cost bond?
MR. EISENSTATT:
a cost bond.
Q

No, Your Honor, you would not need

The statute does not give that discretion.
The motion is a kind of odd one that we’re

20

talking about.

Basically it would be the appellant moving

that the appellee be permitted to proceed on & typewritten
brief.
MR. EISENSTATTs
Q

Right.

His motion might well be that both parties*—!

had assumed in my hypothetical that your motion would be that
both parties be permitted to do so# first for your client's
problem and second to remove him of the need to file the
bond »
MR. EISEJJSTATTs

Your Honor, the only way that 1

see that the Nebraska Supreme Court could have done that
would have been to have denied the application of a statute.
There is no discretion in that statute.

They would have had

to do it on the basis of constitutional issues—
Q

Are you saying, Mr. Eisenstatt, that even

where they do waive the requirement for printing the briefs,
even where they do that for both parties, the bond would still
have had to be filed even though since they had been filed
not printed, there would be no occasion ever to pay a bond;
is that right?
MR. EISENSTATT;
Q

That’s right.

What is this bond?

Is it a cash bond or what

form does it take?
MR. EISENSTATT;
security in lieu thereof.

It can be a surety bond or a cash

Q

Is it a. bond?

matically collected on?

When you file, is it auto­

Say the appellant files and loses.

What happens then?
MR. EISENSTATT:

Xf the appellant, the losing party

does not pay the brief costs—
Q

So, $75 automatically doesn't go to the

appellee.
MR. EISENSTATT:

Wo, Your Honor.

It's only if it

doesn't pay the taxation of costs that are included in the
mandate.
Q

And you could not tax the cost unless there

was a printing as distinguished from a typewriting.
MR. EX SENS TAT1?:
Q

Right, Your Honor.

Is it not possible to construe that—not for

us but for the Nebraska Supreme Court—to construe its own
statute as meaning that the waiver of printing would permit
the waiver of the filing of the $73 by bond or cash?
MR, EISENSTATT:
court.

I see no discretion allowed the

It’s an absolute requirement.
Q

You mean the statute would require them to

do a useless thing,
MR. EISENSTATT:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

You think the Supreme Court of Nebraska would

probably construe it that way, nearly as you can judge now.
MR. EISENSTATT:

I would assume, sir, that it would

Q

incidentally? it costs to get the briefs

typed as well as printed»
MR. El SENS TATS1:
Q

Yes , Your Honor , I—

Suppose the appellant loses, does the cost

bond go to reimburse the appellee for the cost of typing
when he submits a typewritten—
MR. EISENSTATT:

All that the statute says is that

it is conditioned that the appellant shall pay all costs
adjudged against hixn in the Supreme Court without specifica­
tion .
0

Does Nebraska ever decide in a real close case

that each side shall bear its own costs?
MR. EISENSTATT:
Q

What happens to the $75 then?

MR. EISENSTATT:
Q

Well, no, it's released.

In a surety bond, what's the premium?

MR. EISENSTATT:
G

Then it would not—

The state keeps it, I guess.

MR. EISENSTATT:
'Q

Yes, sir,

It would be a minimum of $20.

For a seventy-five dollar bond?

MR. EISENSTATT:

Minimum.

In some cases there are

some companies that do permit a ten-doliar fee.

But it's a

minimum up to a thousand dollars.
Q

Are there any statutory costs as such to the

Nebraska practice?

23
MR. SISEHSTATTs

None other than the twenty-dollar

docket fee which must be paid in advance.
Q

And he did pay that?

MR. EISENSTATT:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Out of the $114 that you said he had

in his

pocket.
MR. EISBNSTATT:

Ha paid $20 to the state for his

docket fee and $88.58 to the Gant Publishing Company of
Lincoln.
Q

Does the appellee pay a docket fee also?

MR. EISENSTATT:

Mo.

He pays a five-doliar

appearance fee.
Thank you.
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. Eisenatatt.
Mr. Dcwding?
ORAL ARGUMENT OP VINCENT L. DOWDING, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DOWDING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to address myself to two points that
were raised in the questioning.

First of all, the statute

involved, as I read it, does permit discretion.

Page 5 of

respondent's brief quotes this statute, and it says that the
appeal may be dismissed on motion and notice in the Supreme

24
Court if no bond has been given and certified in the
transcript or within such additional time as may be fixed by
the Supreme Court for good, cause

shown.

So that even the

failure to file this bond or undertaking# and ifc can be cash#
would not necessarily be an automatic dismissal.

So# there

is discretion here# but X am assuming, as is Mr. Eisenstatt,
that they did dismiss this simply because the money was not
posted,.
Q

Do you disagree with Mr. Eisenstatt1s

statement that the Nebraska case law indicates that dismissal
will follow virtually automatically?
MR. DGWDING;

I respect his decision on that.

You

can't tell from the record why they dismissed it here# but I
think we're all assuming it was because he didn't come up
With the $75.
I'd like to address myself to a question
Mr. Justice Douglas raised with reference to whether or not
the Boddie case was raised i.n the Nebraska Supreme Court.
My colleague, Mr, BeIfcsser, argued that motion for dismissal
in the Nebraska Supreme Court, and I was informed and it was
our point that the Boddie case is distinguishable herein
because the purpose of this bond statute inures to the
benefit of a private litigant and not to the state.
There was no written opinion issued by the
Nebraska Supreme Court when they dismissed.

X don't know.

25
But that basically was the only argument that was made,
because Mr. Huffman did raise that case very well in his
objections to our motion, to dismiss.
Q

As long as it's state- action, I don’t suppose

that would make any difference what the purpose may have been.
MS, DOWDIMG:

No.

1 really don’t know whether they

went off on that ground or not.

X think, as Mr, Eisensfcatt

said, it’s—
Q

Are there any other decisions of the Nebraska

Supreme Court on this?
MR. BONDING:

No, there isn’t, Your Honor.

St is oar basic contention that the statute which
barred Harold Huffman from an appellate hearing is
constitutional for the basic reason that it gives the
respondent herein, Faye Boersen, financial protection on.
appeal and is therefore not. in violation of the due process
clause and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.
Q

Could I ask you a question?

There is now an

act which has been passed in Nebraska, and if that statute had
been in effect, you wouldn’t be here?
MR. BONDING:
Q

No, it would, cover it.

It has passed..

Would that act be applicable or of any relief

if this case were remanded for reconsideration in the light
of that .statute?
MR. BONDING:

Well, if it were remanded for

26
reconsideration., I would file & motion to proceed pursuant to
that statuto.
it

And then the question would be whether or not

would apply retroactively.
Q

If it was retroactive, here is a ease that

isn't fina1 yet.
MR. DDWDINGs

But the problem is, Your Honor, that

new statute says that before you can proceed in forma
pauperis on appeal, the trial court must say that the appeal,
is taken in good faith.

So, they may not apply it to this

specific case.
Q

That may raise another question but not this

one.
MR. DOWD2KG;

Yes.

Yes, they could apply it, and

we’d certainly ask them to—
Q

Does the statute on its

MR. DOWDING;

face—

It covers it, Your Honor.

It says

that-~
Q

Is that the statute—

MR. DOWDIKGt
Q

Yes, it's in effect now, passed—•

No, is it i:n your brief?

MR. DQWDXNG:

Yes.

It's attached as an appendix

to my brief.
Q

As a matter of fact, the statute was passed

pursuant or as a result of the grant served in this case,
was it not?

MR. DOWDIMG:
was or not.

I don't know, Your Honor, whether it

I wouldn't be surprised.

But it is now in

effect, and we will make every attempt to proceed pursuant
to that statute in order to save the expenses, because my
client is also a pauper.
Q

I suppose the Supreme Court of Nebraska, if

this case were remanded, might in turn remand to the trial
court for appropriate finding as to whether the appeal were
taken in good faith.
MR. DOWDING:

Yes, they certainly could.

VJith reference to the due process clause and its
application here, we attempt to distinguish the Doddie case
and say that it does not stretch to reach this case at bar.
We say this for two basic reasons, and here I am just
attempting to addressmyseIf to the due process clause only.
In the Boddie case the Court was very careful to limit it to
its facts and it was careful to state that it was not holding
that in some cases access to courts would not be denied.
Q

Would you distinguish annulment from divorce

in terms of the basic approach of the Boddie case?
MR. DOWDING:
Q

The state has exclusive control of each?

MR. DOWDING:
Q

No, I do not.

I do not.

I do not -distinguish it—

Do you distinguish the initiation of the suit

in Boddie from the right to an appeal?

28
HR, DOWDIHGs

Yes, that's right,. Your Honor.

It’s

cv:-: theory that the right to appeal is not a fundamental
right, as defined in the Boddie case, under the due process
clause, because as I understand the law, the due process
clause does not require a state to afford an appeal.

And,

therefore, we argue from that that the right to appeal is not
a fundamental right, as defined by Boddie.
Q

But it is a right under the law of Nebraska;

it’s an absolute right.
MR. D0V7DING:

Xt's not a discretionary right.
No, it isn't, but under the Nebraska

law, the right to put some requirements on it is also
specified, and we will further state that the due process-—
Q

Is that specified in the Constitution?

MR. DOWDING:
Q

No, that’s case—

The Constitution says that you have an

absolute right to appeal in a civil case.
MR. DOWDING:

That’s right, Your Honor, it does.

The only way we can distinguish that is to say that we’re
talking about a federal, fundamental right under the due
process clause.

That’s the only way 1 can distinguish that,

I feel.
Q

And how do you distinguish it?

MR. DOWDING:
G
help me.

What?

Just by saying federal due process law doesn't

How do you say that's not a part of the proceeding?

29

MR. DOWDIRQ:

,

I'm sorry Your Honorf I didn’t hear

you „
Q

Isn’t that just as integral a. part of the

proceeding as the original trial where it's a matter of right?
MR. DOWDIKG;

I will concede that except that under

the case law at the time, this particular statutory
requirement had been held to be valid.
Q

Valid under your Nebraska Constitution?

MR. DOWDING:
Q

Yes, that’s right.

The Supreme Court's decisions had said that

the legislature could put conditions on this.
MR. DOWDING:
Q

That's right.

But certainly my Brother Marshall is right in

the implication of his question, is he not, that a domestic
relations action such as this under Nebraska law as it is,
is not final one way or the other until the appeal process
has been made.
MR. DOWDING;

That would then make the right to

appeal in Nebraska a fundamental right under Boddie.

Perhaps

my distinction would not be valid.
Q

What you say is Nebraska says you have an

absolute right to appeal in any civil case if you have $75?
MR. DOWDING;

That's what it amounts to, Your Honor,

in Nebraska; that's right.
Q

And the reason---

That squares with the Federal Constitution?

30

MR. DOWDINGt

We feel that it does.

We feel that

the Saddle case is distinguishable basically because this
particular cost bond requirement is for the benefit of a
private civil litigant and dees not go into the state
coffers.

In the Boddie case, there were two policies set up

by the State of Connecticut, two reasons.

One, to recoup the

costs? and, two, to deter frivolous litigation.
Q

In order to be correct, to recoup part of the

costs.
MR. DOWDIKG:
Q

Yes, that’s right. Your Honor.

Isn’t it adequate protection for other parties

to make sure that the action isn’t frivolous?
MR. DOWDINGs

I agree.

I agree that the policy

behind this statute, one of which is—
Q

Or it isn’t any longer the policy of the state

anyway„
MR. DOWDING:

I feel that it is still one of the

policies for this particular statute to deter frivolous
appeals.

I don’t rest, on that distinction.

1 rest on the

distinction that the state—this is a reasonable purpose,
a constitutional, permissible purpose for state legislatures
to protect civil litigants on appeal such as in Lindsey v.
Normet.
Q

But that isn't the policy of the State of

Nebraska anymore, is it?

31
MR. DOWDING:

Not now under the In form a pauperis.

So that distinguishing Boddie on policy grounds,
we feel that it’s different that the state has power to
protect the private civil litigants on appeal.

K'e feel that

that distinction alone lightens the impact of Boddie as
precedent under the due process clause.
With reference to the equal protection clause—and
that Vs Griffin v. Illinois and the cases that have followed
it—to my knowledge the Griffin case has not been applied
to a civil litigation on the appeal levels

We attempt to go

to some standard tests under the equal protection clause
to determine whether or not this particular legislation is
valid.

Is the purpose of the statute constitutionally

permissible and, two, is the statute rationally set up to
reach that need?
In Lindsey v. Normet the Court said that at least
on its face the standard bond requirement in there was
constitutional.

So, we feel that it is constitutionally

permissible for a state to set up this type of financial
protection in civil litigation.
Q
to give

Do you know of any bonding company in Nebraska

a bond to a prisoner in the state penitentiary?
MR. DOWDING:

No.

I agree that Mr, Huffman was

indigent and was unable to make this bend because of his
poverty.

Q

Suppose the case came into equity court or some

court in Nebraska and it seized all of the money that the
man had, every dollar he had in the bank, his house, his
clothes, his car, and everything.
HR. DOWDING:

And he wanted to appeal.

I think you might have a different

case.

Why?
MR. DOWDING:

1 think you’ve got to judge each

case—when you’re at the appeal level, unlike Boddie, when
you’re at the appeal­
er

My case is that they would agree that they

are in violation of the 14fch Amendment of the Constitution.
The Court gave all of this to the plaintiff in the case and.
left the defendant broke.
all.

The defendant has no redress at

He’s broke.
MR, DOWDING:
Q

That’s right.

That’s exactly right»

And that also squares with the Federal

Constitution?
MR. DOWDING:
draw the line.

This is why I am asking the Court to

I am not going to object to appellate fees

that are set up and going to the state treasury.

I think it’s

a fairly fine line, and I’ll admit that; but I feel that when
you judge: this legislation against the equal protection clause,
that the state does have the right to protect private
litigants.

And I think the state can come. in and say

33
probably that the appellee also has to post a bond on appeal,
Q

They don't say yon post a cost bond.

They just

say a seventy-five dollar bond,

MR. DOWDING:
Q

No, it's cost bond.

If the case involved 14 constitutional points

and $16 million and the brief cost $4000, 75 bucks.

If there

is a very simple point and they require six pages of briefing,
$75.
MR. DOWDING:

That's right.

this statute is not adequate.

In some cases perhaps

Perhaps we need more protection.

But again getting back to the point, that, is the line that
the respondent is asking the Court to establish at this.point.
When we state establishes reasonable financial requirements
to protect private litigants in civil .cases, than it is
constitutional; that's the line we ask you to draw.

And I'm

willing to concede the twenty-dollar docket fee because I
don't think the state's policy—in Boddie the Court pointed
out that the state's policy in recouping part of the cost does
not outweigh this right to access.
Q

Ironically he paid the twenty-dollar docket fee,

MR. DOWDINGs
the printed brief.

Yes, he did.

And he also paid for

I don't know if he were to come in and

move to ask for a typewritten brief whether or not it would
have been granted; but if he could have got a typewritten
brief, then he would have had enough money to make the bond.

/

And that's the problem»

But he just came down to this last

point and couldn’t com© up with the money.
Q

Do you agree that the Nebraska Supreme Court

could not xvaive the filing of the $75 if they waived the
printing brief?
MR. DOWDING:
Q

I think they could waive them both.

You disagree with your friend.

HR. DOWDING:

Yes, well, on the face of the statute

they're both discretionary.
Q

But they just never have.

MR. DOWDINGs
Q

They never have.

And they didn't in this case.

MR. DOWDING:

I defer to Mr. Eisenstatt.

it and I believe it on this point.

He says

He has had more

experience there than I»
Q

Would you say the same thing if a plaintiff

in the trial court—he not only had to pay his docket fee
but he had to file e: cost bond to protect the defendant.
MR. DOWDING:

As Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan

Company, Your Honor; and the question is, Would that case be
decided different today if that plaintiff were broke in that
case?
Q

How would it be decided differently if it wore

& domestic relations—
MR,-. DOWDING:

This is right.

If the Court, of course,

35
follows this line of marital relations being the crucial
line here, of course then-Q

It would be decided differently if it were.

MR. DOWDING:
Q

That's right.

Only the state could determine the status of

a marriage or paternity of a child.
MR. DOWDIMG:

That's basically where we're at on

this.
Q

And you would say the* same thing if the state

required him to post a bond to get into the trial court to
pay the defendant's attorney's fees?
MR. DOWDIMG:

I would.

I think that the state

again, if they're protecting the private civil litigants,
and it has got some reasonable basis in fact to the purpose
they're trying to accomplish.
Q

You would say the same even if admittedly the

case was not frivolous?
MR. DOWDXRG:

Yes, I would.

happen in Lindsey v. Normet..

Here's what would

Suppose that all you had was

the standard bond requirement there and the tenant was
absolutely broke and had a meritorious appeal.

Then you

would have basically the same question you've got here
except that it's outside the scope of domestic relations.
And it wonId be my contention in that case that that
standard bond requirement would be valid, even though it

36
denies access, because it's set up as a valid state purpose
to protect the private litigant*
Q

Do you think it would be an appropriate

solution of this case if the Court were to decide to remand
it to the Nebraska Courts and let them reconsider the whole
problem in the light of the new statute?
• MR. DOWDING;

I do.

1 certainly could not object

because the purpose behind this appeal statute was to give
my client financial protection.

If I were given permission

to file a typewritten brief without coming up with the costs,
I could not complain.

Mr. Huffman would then have a hearing

and my client would have the same protection she had under
this statute,

tod that’s the alternative relief that I

asked.
I do feel, however, that if the Court reverses and
holds this statute unconstitutional, that you have thereby
probably, unless you stick to domestic relations situations,
granted an indigent a free pass on basically all litigation,
because it's a lot tougher, I feel-™it’s easier to say that
the state can afford to absorb the loss, and that's not a
valid purpose to reimburse the state treasury.

But I think

it’s a lot harder to say when you've got two individuals and
the protecting on® in litigation, that that's unconstitu­
tional.

I feel that once you say that, that it's

unconstitutional in this case, I think about all financial

37
requirements are out as far as an indigent is concerned
unless you stick again to the ..domestic relations area.
Q

I suppose your case here is somewhat

stronger because you have had a hearing in the trial court
and it's on appeal than it would be if you simply had a
cost bond requirement in the trial court before there had
been any determination.
MR. BONDINGj

I feel that's right.

Again state

policy, once the litigant is a winner perhaps they are
entitled not to be hauled into appeals court without some
protection(, and that's the basis behind it, which I feel is
a valid statement of purpose.
Q

Mr. Dowding, let me go po the other issue.

You've whet my curiosity.

Doesn't Nebraska ever let a

prisoner out to defend in a trial court of the state an .
action of this kind brought against him?
MR. DOWNING:
that for the record.

Yes, and Mr, Eisenstafct furnished
There's a latter from the warden in

there saying that all they require is an order from the
court directing that he be present and they will deliver
him.
Q

Do you know why such an order was issued in

this case?
MR. BONDING:
overruled it.

No, Your Honor.

The court just

There was no argument on it or anything.

And

38
I felt at that point that all Fay.e Boersen was after was
an annulment, and I felt that the law was clear.

She was

married to Mr. Boersen when she married Mr. Huffman, and
the record in this case is maybe two pages.
Q

Was there any dispute on the facts at all?

MR. DOWDING:
annulment issue.

Hot on the marriage issue, an

There's a dispute on whether or not

Mr. Huffman is foreclosed from determining that he's the
father of Faye's child.
Q

Was that a proper issue in this case?

MR. DOWDING:

I would say it probably was under

Nebraska pleading because Huffman set it up in a cost
petition,

I personally do not feel it was validly

determined, and I am willing to stipulate at any later
litigation that Mr. Huffman can come in and determine it.
I didn’t intend to have that issue determined;
let's put it that way.

Harold filed though a lot of

pleadings, and they weren’t under any description or name
allowed by Nebraska law, and he did raise the paternity
issue in there, and it was rejected.
Q

Isn't that a rather unusual procedural device

to determine a paternity issue in an annulment suit?
MR. DOWDING:

Yes, it is. Your Honor, but our

Nebraska Court has held that either party can raise that
issue in an annulment if it’s alleged that there are issue

39
of the marriage.

And, as far as I'm concerned, that issue

has not been foreclosed.
Q

That's established Nebraska lav?, then.

MR. DOWDING;

I believe it is, Your Honor, and

Mr. Eisenstatt cites a case in his reply brief which
indicates as such.
In closing, then, we contend that the statute
which barred Harold Huffman from access to the appeals court
is constitutional.

If the Court finds that it is not, we ask

for alternative relief to afford us the same financial
protection.
Q

What is that new bill?

Is it legislative

bill 1120?
MR. DOWDING:

Yes.

It's attached to our brief

as an appendix.
Q

But, as I read it, it’s not retroactive.

MR. DOWDING:

This is right, Your Honor.

We'd

probably have to go back in and ask them to apply it? and
if both parties agree, they might.
Q

It doesn't need to be retroactive.

This is

still a live case,
MR. DOWDING:

We might have to go back and ask the

trial court to certify that the appeal was taken in good
faith before the appeal rules applied, because that's what
the statute says.

40
Q

You'd have to do that in every case.

MR. DOWDING:

This is true,

I think the

Nebraska Supreme Court would apply this, if Mr. Eisenstatt
went in and said that, we both want relief under the statute
Q

If they didn't, it would be back.

MR. DOWDING:
c?

Yes.

You say in your brief, as I understand it,

in your argument, that it was not taken in good faith.
MR. DOWDING:
■the annulment issue.

I fesl the appeal is frivolous on
If paternity was decided and validly

against, I think that the
Q

appeal has merit.

You told us today that you concede that the

determination of the paternity question was insufficient,
invalid X think is the word you used..
MR. DOWDING:

Yes, I'm willing to agree that

Mr. Huffman did not have his day in court on the paternity
issue.
Q

And we could say so on a remand?

MR. DOWDING:
Q

Yes.

So stipulate.

But the basic question is the validity of

the marriage, as X read your brief.
MR. DOWDING;
Q

Yes.

It has been decided.

And that is, by your standards, a frivolous

question.
MR. DOWDING:

Yesf because Nebraska law was clear

41
on that point, that if a party is married and they enter
into another marriage contract, then the marriage is void.
But there is a Nevada statute which I didn't offer into
evidence, and so it3® outside the record.

But it. says that

if parties are married when, they enter into marriage in
Nevada, it’s null and void even without an annulment action.
1 feel that. Faye Boarsen is entitled to an
annulment; no question about that.
Q

And if you did introduce on the record a

certified copy of her divorce decree from the first husband
which came after her marriage to this man, Mr. Huffman.
MR. DOWDZNG:
0

Yes.

You think that the issue e£ annulment stands

on a separate ground?
MR. DOWDING:

I feel that it does.

I am willing to

say that the paternity issue was not decided against Harold
Huffman.

1 feel that's the only issue validly decided, and

his appeal in my opinion is frivolous.
Q

Of course, it's all one lawsuit, isn't it?

MR. DOWDING;
Q

Yes, it is.

Wouldn't it be considered so by Nebraska?

There's a complaint and there's a—
MR. DOWDING;

That gets into the pleading laws.

I'm willing to say the man didn't have a fair hearing on
that paternity and ought to be able to litigate it.

42
Q

And that's part of all one lawsuit because

again it's an action for annulment.
MR. DOWDINGs
Q

Yes, it is.

Then you shouldn’t say, as you do in your

brief, that the appeal was frivolous.
MR. DOWDING:
concede that.

All right, Your Honor, I’ll even

If, in fact, the paternity issue was decided.

But I am again willing to open up the courts and remander
anything to help them decide this issue.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Dowding.

If there is any important factor you wish to make,
we'll give you a minute or two.
REBUTTAL BY MR. EISENSTATT
MR. EISENSTATT:
Your Honor.

Just tvro minutes, if we may,

First, you can't in Nebraska stipulate your

jurisdictions as far a3 the paternity issue.
be willing to stipulate it.

He said he'd

I just wanted the Court to know

that a stipulation of counsel will not vest any court with—
Q

Jurisdiction.

MR. EISENSTATT:
Q

-“jurisdiction to hear the matter.

But it may have something to do with whether

or not this appeal is a substantial appeal or a privileged
one.
MR. EISENSTATT:

Right.

And as to one point with

respect, to the Lindsey v. Normat case, I would like to call

43
the Court's attention to the distinguishing characteristic
of that bond or payment provision for rent, pending appeal,
and the Court said there are unique factual or legal
characteristics of the landlord-tenant relationship that
justify special statutory treatment in applicable to other
litigants, and then goes on to refer to the fact that the
landlord is incurring expenses and the tenant would be
getting reoccupation.

So, I reiterate ray statement in my

original presentation that the original or bond covering the
payment of the actual note is distinguishable from this
case.
Q

Do you agree with Mr. Dowding that a remand

to the Nebraska courts would be an appropriate solution to
the problem?
MR. EISENST&TT;

I would hope it would.

I would

want this Court to I think give it a bit of a nudge, Your
Honor; if they could have a chance to interpret this,
contrary to applying LB 1120, they might do it.
Q

You say give them a nudge.

Do you mean by

that to make if clear that we expect Nebraska to solve this
problem?
MR. EJSENSTATT:

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Eisenstatt.

You appeared here by our request and by appointment of the
Court.

And on behalf of the Court I want to thank you for

44
your assistance not only to your client but to our Court.
And thank you, Mr. Dow&ing.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:05 o'clock a.m. the case was
submitted.]
