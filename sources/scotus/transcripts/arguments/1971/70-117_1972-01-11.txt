Mr, Manes, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HUGH R0 MANES
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, MANES:

Me*. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This case involves the constitutionality of the
Federal Use-Immunity Statute, Title 18, Sections 6002 and
6003.

The question presented in this c&3© is whether
Federal Use-Immunity as conferred by Section 6002 is co­
extensive with the Fifth Amendment Privilege against selfincrimination..
This case arises from the imprisonment for civil
contempt of the Petitioners, both of them, by the Federal
District Court for the Central District of California for
refusing to answer questions put to them by the — before the
Grand Jury for violations or alleged violations of the
Selective Service Laws,

The Petitioners were accorded us©-

immunity by the United States Attorney and ordered to answer by
he United States District Court pursuant to that immunity,
ch was conferred under Section 6002, and they declined to
answer the questions in any ©vent, invoking their privilege

k
on th© theory that the immunity offered by 6002 was incomplete.
Petitioner’s contend here that only transactional
immunity will satisfy the Fifth Amendment Privilege*

He take

that position for several reasons.
■ First, the history and development of the privilege
and the logic compel absolute immunity be granted* and
nothing less*
Secondlyj we argue that the so-called "tainted
evidence" rules required for the administration and control
and supervision of the use-immunlty statute are inadequate*
They cannot guarantee the absolute immunity which the Fifth
Amendment demands and requires.
Thirdly* we take the position that the statutory
language of 6003 so limits the court power as to prevent a
fair and reasonable application of use-immunity and*
particularly* to prevent adequate court supervision of the
use of that particular immunity.*.
And finally* we argue that use-immunity conferred
by 6002, coupled with existing statutes, for example* the
Tehks Act, Rule 16 and other provisions, is such as to deprive
the witness of due process and abridge his rights guaranteed
by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and-, particularly, to
render these immunity statutes at bar unfair as against the
subject witness who may become an accused person.
Before I proceed with that argument, I would like to

point out something about this particular statute that we’re
ilihg with which is in na sponso to questions put to prion
counsol*

This* X would respectfully submit, is a use-immunity

statute that has no limitations*

Indeed, it is called a

"general immunity law.”
It is not limited in. its application to simply
multi “defendant cases, nor is it limited in any way to any
particular kind of offense.

It permits immunity to be

granted and the witness to ho compelled to answer in virtually
most, if not all, offenses and certainly as -«* whether the
person is an individual and charged or suspected of only an
individual crime as well as, of course, the multiple-defendant
type of situation*
And we submit that where you have a statute

that

is as broad as the statute at bar, from a prosecution point

of view, If it’s there, it's going to be used, and -«
Q,

It’s limited in its use*

It has to be

approved by somebody here in 'Washington, at least as high as
the Assistant Attorney General level*
MR. MAH ESS

Well, it has to be

yes, air, it has

to be the authority for giving immunity must be approved
either by the Attorney General or bis authorised representative.
But I would submit, Your Honor, that under Section —
Q

¥©11, isn’t it the Attorney General, the

Deputy, or one of the Assistants here in Washington?

Do I

6
read th© statute correctly?
MR, MAKES:
Q

Yes* sir.

tod is that true also with respect to sub­

section III of 6002 when it involves questions before a
committ©© of on© of the Houses of Congress?
HR* MAKES?

Well, Your Honor, I would assume so,

but I’m not addressing myself to the question of scope as •«
Q,

Well, I’m Just Inquiring as to the scope♦

MR* MAKES:

I would assume, Your Honor, that that

would bo true in both oases, but I cannot represent as to its
effect with regard to the House or Congress*

I certainly can

confirm that that would be true as regards immunity before a
Grand Jury, and I would add to that, if the Court please,
that the representation may be made to the court as mere
c oncluslons, as they were below, with regard not only to the
authority, and I would further point out that all that the
Halted States Attorney need show is a conclusionary statement
that it’s in the public interest for the government to grant
immunity and to inquire compulsorily of the witness.
not — he is not required to* show, and the

Ha may

court cannot

demand that he show reasonable cause for intruding on the
privacy, and I think this is a very important thing when we
are talking about a secret proceeding such as the Grand Jury,
«

as in this case*
la any event, what I wanted to *»«••*

7
Q

What does the record in this ease show, if

anything, as to the authority undor the

who did authorize

this and why?
MR * MANES s

All the record shows, Xour Honor, and

that will appear in the Appendix at pages 54 and 60 of the
Appendix — actually, it is 54 through 60«
Q

Right.

MR* MANESi

it simply shows that the United States

Attorney represented that there was a public interest in
having the Petitioners appear before the Grand Jury with useimmunity, that they would invoke the Fifth or, indeed, had
dons so in the case of Kaetigar, and that the privilege was
mad© in good faith with the approval of the Attorney General
of the united States.

That — that is all the showing that

was required, and I want to reiterate that the showing that
is made there is without any detail as to in what respect
there is a reasonable cause.

It’s just a conclusionary

statement on the part of the counsel.
Now, I wanted to urge upon this Court why we take »

why it{s important to us, at least, that transactional
immunity he regarded as the very limit for the Fifth
Amendment as a grant of aay kind of immunity, and I would
;n?ya upon trie Court that it is the government that wants

immunity when we — when we talk, you. know, of giving
hi . , ,..'.it;v butha,v

I would urge this Court to consider that

8

it is the government that is seeking to force a person to
testify against himself, and they are seeking that immunity,,
they are seeking that testimony to compel him to testify
against himself because they want some information, and it
is a convenient method for doing that»
MR» CHIEF’ JUSTICE BURGER:

We will suspend for

an hour.
{Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at 1:00 p.m., the same day.)

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may continue,

Mr. Manes.
MR. MANES:

Wall» X would —

A crown case.

MR, MANES?

— X would like that, but I try to

bo realistic, Your Honor, and assumed that that «•
The first part of your brief deals with that

Q,
problem.

MR» MANE’S:

Yes, sir, it does and °» because we

believe that the Court has never answered the question as
t

whether the Fifth Amendment and its history doesn't enjoin

compulsion and, on that thesis, Your Honor»
Well, I addressed myself to that in the

Q,

dissenting opinion —
MR* MANES:
Q,

Yds, sir*

--as you may remember.

MR* MANES?
Q

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

But nobody except Justice Black agreed with

me»
MR* MANES:

1 know that, Your Honor, and so I’m

taking it from there*
But if the Court please, 1 — there is an argument
that is being snide that the Fifth Amendment protects only
use of

-

ant to address myself to

fa :-.t, just for a : • >m?nt and point out that the Fifth

10
is Court in Ullraann not t
til

...

irit,

is to be construe L li
purposes, and that was the holding, of course, in Spevac

v.

Klein, as well as many other cases,

that there is not just one purpose.

-tod so I would, nets

As this Court has

observed in Murphy, at page 55? and as it observed as long
ago as Boyd v. United States, the Fifth Amendment has many
purposes that have to be considered when you are evaluating
the question of whether use-immunity is sufficient.
For one thing, the Fifth Amendment was designed and
cam© into our Constitution to prevent disclosures by torture
and, while I submit that maybe some may feel that that's hind
of remoto, now, we ’re in a modern age, X would remind this
■Court that it was only 30 years ago when this Court was
forced to deal with the problems of the third. and Brown v.
Mississippi, Chambers v. Florida and a whole series of cases
and only a few years ago when this Court had to hold in
Miranda that it was necessary for an accused to be given a
warning about the effect of his testimony.
So we are concerned with the scop© of that protection
as applied to coercion.

But in addition to that, if the

Court please, X would submit that the Fifth Amendment also
has a policy consideration which has long been the concern
of this Court, and that is the distrust that we have of

11

echoed testimony, the distrust we have of it*
It that

.

v*^ the

X would

d States, which was decided

only a year after Walker v* B?own, this Court made a very
important observation*

It recognised •- at page $h/fs

168 UaS,,, "The human mind, under the pressure of calamity,
is easily seduced and is liable, under the alarm of danger,
to acknowledge indiscriminately a falsehood or a truth as
different agitations may prevail*"

And why X think that

particular quotation is apt here is because the Petitioners
here are put in the position of avoiding jail* not simply
because they've been granted immunity or be held in contempt
but that they are compelled to avoid jail by giving informa­
tion which they think the government may want to hear in
order to avoid prosecution*

Now, that is a tendency, X

would respectfully submit, that is inherent in any use®
immunity statute, and certainly in the one at bar*
But there is another policy consideration here, too,
if the Court please, and that is, that it’s to avoid not
simply a trilemma but a quatrileama, if the Court please, of
self-accusation, perjury and contempt and the possibility of
prosecution*
We submit that Brown v«_Walker deals with that
dil,xT5?/‘. or that quatrilemma, as I prefer to call it, very
succinctly and poignantly, and remember this was in 1096
when the Court there is talking about the policies which gave

12

ris© vo th© Fifth /haenduont»

it observed that if an

aeons d parson bo asked to explain hi a appareat connoction
with a crime under investigation* the ©as© with which th©
question is put to him may as sum© an Inquisitorial character »
th© temptation to proas the witness unduly» to browbeat him
if ha be timid or reluctant» push him into a corner end to
entrap him ~~ to entrap Mm into fatal contradictions» which
is

go

painfully evident In many of the early state trials»

made the system

ho

odious as to give rise to a demand for its

total abolition <In the context of this casa» I would respectfully
submit in response to a question that was posed to Counsel
before me that th© accused her© does not hold exclusively
the keys to his jail door.
.

.0

On th© contrary» it’s like anyone

has money and has a safety deposit box» he shares it with

the lank and

go

here the accused shares the keys with the

government» for while it is true that ha can talk and thus
open the door of contempt» that lias confined him in contempt»
the government holds th© key as to whether his talking may
lead to a desire to prosecute Mm and therefore» 1 submit
that when we are talking about quetrlleramal

when w© are

talking about the policy underlying th© privilege» w© have
to consider' this possibility as well*

Me have to consider

what was a-rid hy this Court in Garriby and other cases.
'b .,: choice Here that th© accused has between th© rock and

13
•; • ■ ■ 3 nhl r 1p o o I,

t :i pi i e & *

And than the?® is another consideration, too, if
pp®

Court please, and that 1b the basic respect which this

society has for the inviolability of the person and his
privacy, as the Court noted in Malloy y. Hogan, as it noted
in Miranda v. Arizona and aa it certainly noted long ago
and, again, the Boyd case, when it observed that any
compulsory discovery by extorting the party’s oath or__
compelling the production of his private books and pap-are
to convict him of a crime or to forfeit his property
certainly is a principle that marges into the Fourth and
the Fifth Amendment«
And another point, wo have here, in our society,
for the prosecutorial system, for the accusatorial
system which places the burden entirely on the government
and not for the inquisitorial process which, I would
respectfully submit, certainly In the context of this case,
it takes placo in the Grand Jury room where the accused is
•without a lawyer, where he has no protection whatsoever,
but where he is faced with a lawyer and I would respectfully
submit that, given the secrecy which attends all Grand Jury
proceedings, and the secrecy which prevails thereafter as
the decisions of this Court have made quite apparent in many
-•aoeo, that it will he extremely «** that the accused will be
vxtrs-mcly kurd put not to feel a sense of entrapment by the

14

circumstances which attend the uae-iaammity situation*
Eat thero is one additional consideration which X
think underscores the Fifth Axaendment, as X road the ce.m&
of this Court and that is the notion of a sense of fair play

which requires the government to let the individual alone
misso it has reasonable cause to justify intruding upon him*
How, as I pointed out earlier in my comments,

this statute gives the accused no opportunity whatsoever,
nor, indeed, the court, to inquire whether there was reasonable

cause to peruse his privacy or, indeed, his defenses and
allows the government to ransack his defenses as the accused
is not permittee! to do with respect to government files»
How, X would respectfully submit that there are
nome other considerations, that, for ©sample, the protection
of th© innocent even though some guilty may benefit inciden­

tally,

That is a choice.

That ie a choice which government

makes in th© contest, at least, of this kind of a statute,
and it is a choice which is mad© upon the circumstance that

if the accused has something that it wants to hav© badly,
then th© government should be put to the choice as it was
put to th© choice in

Rosario

as it was put to the

:h>iee in Aadol achate and in Ooplap. and in a number of other
cases.

It*s got to choose.
If it wants to have information, let it hav© th©

Information but avoid prosecution.

Citation to' the Catena case, Catena v«

in the 449 F2&, page kO and more recently, just

recently, the Sighth Circuit also took the view that the
Kinth Circuit was in error and viewed the underlying policy
considerations of Counselraan as prevailing and 1 refer here
t© United States v* McDaniel 449 F2d 832 at page 638.

That

case, incidentally, is kind of interesting because it
;\d ire awes itself to on© of the questions that was put to

17
ii >1

this morning when. Counsel was asked about

cfiof'/.er he was "overssealous, ” whether Prosecutor
going to 'he t?ov€-pj5eaXous»!?

v:t, :

la that particular case, I

would point out that Counsel there was the federal prosecutor
«
who* because he was informed by his administrativo agencies
that there was a suspicion that a bank president was defal­
cating and esabesaling money, turned the matter over to a
state, to the State of North or South Dakota, and the state
then held

an

iimunity grand jury proceedings, granted

immunity and then, at the request of the United States Attorn©;/,
turned that transcript over to the United States Attorney
for prosecution and indictment followed*
X would say that the court there held that that
was a prima facie evidence of the use of fruits, but I would
also point out that it demonstrates, as does, of course, the
Derger in £95 U.S* and a number of other cases, demonstrates
that prosecutors can bo, at times, oversealous and, particularly
when conferred with such extensive power as appears to be the
case here*
But when I first spoke, I suggested that there
wore other compelling reasons why I believe use-immunity
should not prevail, and one of the most important of those
reasons, of course, is that it :ls inadequate that the rules
/hat are designed to enforce and administer the use-lzamlty
'"<.v?X5i'.gy:; are just simply unable to effectively displace the

Fifth Amendment.
In short, what I contend, what w© contended in
our Briefs, is that «*• that the rules that ape designed to

protect the Fourth and Fifth Amendment in seizure cases and
in the forced confession cases are simply not adequate to
protect or to at least define the limits of the Fifth
Amendment.

In short, what’s happening here, what is being

argued for here, is the use of essentially procedural rules
to define the substantive rights of the witness, and I
submit that that can’t be don® without creating some terrible
problems for an accused who Is questioning whether the
evidence- used against him in a subsequent prosecution isn’t
tainted.
Lot mo suggest some concrete examples of what I
nr.: referring to in this concept*

First of all, California «—

the California Supremo Court decided In People v* Ditson
5"? Cal* 2nd, at page Ip-5 *»**• that was a forced confession
•case and it held there that the fruits of a forced confession
a'o::*o not admissible*

But it went on to hold that the fruit®

of a forced confession may not foe admissible but that the —

Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr* Solicitor General,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL,
ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESd,,
ON BEHALF OF TEE RESPONDENT
MR* GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Court:
The facts of this case are simple and not in
dispute*

Th© Respondent here was ordered to testify under—»

.pursuant to Section 6002 of Title 18 of the United States
Code*

He refused to do so,

The question is whether his

sentence for contempt for falling to comply with that order
,c,.a be sustained consistently with the Fifth Amendment*
Of course, the language of th© Fifth Amendment is
familiar to all of us.

It is one of the shortest and simplest

20

elm
get back to the language*

I don't suggest fox* a moment

bb it It should be construed literally*

On the other hand*

X don't think that it should b© regarded as a take-off
point for a vast, expansion, which has sometimes occurred#
But the language is that?
3i!o person shall be compelled in any criminal
case to be a witness against himself#”
«

And the language of Section 6002, which is Section

201-A of the Organised Crime Control Act of 1970 is that
though the witness Is required to testify under that
statutes
”Ko testimony or other information compelled
under the order or any information directly or

indirectly derived from such testimony or other
information may be used against the witness in
any criminal case *”
She problem arises because of the language in
Cotmaeimm v. Hitchcock of 60 years ago.

The case, it seems

to me, is a sort of jurieprudent i&X case, an. example of the
procos® by which the law grows and develops.

In this car

after rather extended delay*
We now know that there are at least three measures
or varieties of immunity and not two# as we long assumed and
supposed.

There is use-immunity, which was involved In

21
'd- ....Hitchcock
. -• . .
- - and was hold to be inadequate and

...... . ... ....
i.-.vv-a.:t:td►

.,.,'.5

is extended

immmifcy not only

sti
is involved here •

AM, finally, then© ia transactional

i*ai^} giving you amnesty or pardon with respect to any
offenso eovered by the testimony, and that was held to be
sufficient in Broip^and Walker«.
There is complete agreement as to the invalidity
of use-immunity alone and as to the validity of transactional
immunity.

The problem arises and is presented her© with

respect to the validity under the full Amendment «» under the
Fifth Amendment — of full, extended, use-iaaaunity applicable
not only to the evidence given but also to the fruits of
such evidence.

The situation, it seems to me, comes within

the examples with which the common law is filled which are
dealt with in

by Doan Found in his work on jurisprudence.

Volume 111, page £&?., where he says,

"We must distinguish

subsequent judicial rejection of the reasoning by which the
result was reached in a prior case end substitution of
different reasoning leading to the same result from a changed
course of decision.”

And ho concludes, ”Xt cannot be

insisted upon too often that the common law of technique
dobs not make the language authoritative, much less a binding
authority.

It is the result which passos into law.”
Jo one saw the distinction between use-immunity

22

•

and .:hat X would call "extended" or "complete" use^iasaunity

decided.

I thought a lot about the privilege against self-

incriminations some 17 years ago, but X didn't see the
distinction*
called,

Mr» Mayers, in his thought-provoking book,

"Should the Fifth Amendment Be Amended?" published

?
in 1959, did not see it*

Judge Freedley, in his lectures

on "Reconsideration of the Fifth Amendment" published several
years ago, did not refer to it.
Q

The distinction to which you aro now referring

is the distinction between what?
ME. GRISWOLDS

Use and use plus fruits?

Use-iaammity alone, such as was

held invalid in Counselman,/g*_Hitchcock.
Q,

Right

MR, GRISWOLD:

And immunity against the use of the

evidence and all of its fruits, construed as broadly as the
Court feels it should be construed*
The fact was that, for ordinary purposes, the
question was concealed because immediately after Ciounaelman
im13 decided, Congress picked up the swooping
language which Mr* Justice Blatchford has used in a part of
his Opinion there; the statute which Congress enacted was
introduced into Congress 12 days after Counselman against
leeided and Congress provided full transactional
.'i-o..u<j.y every case where 'it required the testimony

23
it gay© only th© narrow usethe Court held that that was invalid..
did this asoaus© it thought it had to do bo*

Congress

It was only

many years 'lator whoa th© Court found, for th© first time*
that the Fifth Amendment applied In 'terms to the states*

In

I961f.j seven and a half years ago, the question rose to the
surface»

It cam© in through the side-door, ao to speak,

because Congress, by its statutory language, had left no
room for it to come before th® Court directly in a federal
criminal case*
How, th© case to which I refer is, of course,
Murphy against the Waterfront Commission, whore the immunity
was granted by a bistate organization*

It was hold that th©

state had no power to grant immunity, transactional immunity,
against a federal prosecution, but the Court sustained th©
statute by holding that under its supervisory power or in
some other way, it isn’t entirely clear, the testimony
obtained in the bistate proceeding could not b© used nor
could its fruits be used in a federal prosecution and that
that complied with th© Fifth Amendment.
The issue was implicit and Mr* Justice Goldberg’s
opinion for the Court in that case, for example, 378 U»S. at
rag©

78

and 79? Justice Goldberg’s statement of Counsolxaan

against Hitchcock
its fruits*

refers several times and only to use and

It was explicit in Me*. Justice White’s

24
concurring Opinion, and in tbs Court's Opinion, the -Opinion
of «justice Goldberg, the conclusion was that the testimony
compelled nu'iosz the oo?ag9liad testimony
its fruits cannot be used in any manner by federal officials
in. connection with the criminal prosecution against him, "
and then he repeated the conclusion that the federal
authorities would not bo allowed to use the evidence or its
fruits and said, "This exclusionary rule, while permitting
the states to secure information necessary for effective law
enforcement, leaves the witness and the Federal Government
in substantially the same position as if the witness had
claimed this privilege in the absence of a state grant of
immunity,11 and the distinction was explicit in the opinion
of Mr. Justice White concurring in that case and it was that
opinion, I think, which brought it all out into the open and
got a lot of people to thinking and resulted in the work by
Professor Dixon of George Washington University.

Incidentally,

he has filed a Brief in tin? Zicarolli case on behalf of the
1 District Attorneys Association which seems to me is
ivi excellent brief and which X hope will be considered in
connection with this case.
Since then, the Court has several times given
Intimations that extended use-» immunity is sufficient.

In

Gardner ,v. ' Broderick, for example in 392 U.S, the Court
said, "Answers may ho compelled regardless of the privilege,

Thus, it oooms to us that the Court has at least
twice decided that extended uee-imaimity meets the requirements
of the Fifth Amendment.

Murphy is not affected by the fact

that two Jurisdictions were involved there*

There were two

jurisdictions but there is only on© Fifth Amendment and it

its non equally applicable throughout the United, States in all

If extended protection against

use of evidence and its fruits is sufficient to sustain the
validity of a state statute, it is sufficient under the same
constitutional provision to sustain the validity of a federal

How, contrary to one of the Counsel

who appeared

this morning, I believe that Counselman against Hitchcock
was rightly decided.

¥e do not ask that it be overruled but

some of its language is now seen to have been too sweeping
and this is one of the ways in which the law develops and
the time has come for this development here,
Q,

Well, Mr* Solicitor General, do you think

we have to have one rule about use of immunity in all
situations?

It seems to me the interest may differ in

various contexts.

For example, the difference between

Spevack v. Klein and Garrity.
MR. GRISWOLD:

I ha not at all sure, Mr. Justice,

that w© need to have it in all situations.

1 do feel

fairly sure that the same rules, whatever they are, should
be applicable both with respect to the application of the
immunity in federal courts and in state courts,
Q,

Yes, but what —

MR* GRISWOLD:

I don’t find any distinction on the

Q

But what If the rule — would you suggest;

that you wore varying the rule if you said that there may
b© state interests or federal interests, say, such as in,
Murghy against Waterfront, which might justify taking a
risk of incrimination that in another context would not be
justified?
HR* GRISWOLD:

Mr. Justice, I certainly would hot

contend for a rigid, fixed rule of any kind.

I don’t think

that there is any distinction on that basis between
Waterfront and this case.

There may well be other eases

such aa the discipline of lawyers end the discharge of
policemen which would present different factors.

I haven’t

given great thought to them and — and don’t now see any
particular distinction, but there may well bo.

I do think

that this situation involving the seeking of the evidence of
a witness for use in connection with criminal matters is not
distinguishable on grounds of special situations from
Murphy against the Waterfront*
Q.

The hazards of.

HR. GRISWOLD:

It seems to me to be exactly the

Court has made sweeping decisions which wore right and has
late?: qualified the language«

The one that first occurred

to re had to do with the taxation of stock dividends where

>

dividends aren’t

C

immediately stepped in and passed a statute saying stock
dividendo are not taxable and it was not possible to raise
any further question under that statute.

It was only

through the side-door, when somebody was ingenious enough
to raise a question with respect to the basis of stock
dividends that the Court intimated that well, maybe some
stock dividends are taxable and in the Kophman ease it was
decided that some stock dividends are taxable and Congress
has now passed a statute,

much as it did here, providing

that certain stock dividends are taxable»
<•¥© have a longstanding constitutional problem in
this country as to the applicability of the nondiscriminatory
tax on the income from state and municipal bonds,

low, that

can't bo raised directly before this Court for the time
being because Congress has enacted that such interest is
not taxable but perhaps it may come up some day and the
Court may find reasons to qualify some of its earlier
positions.

It may come up some day, for example, if Congress

extends the tax on tax preference income.
How, the Court may well be concerned about the
practical effect of a decision along the lines I've indicated
We don't want to whittle away on the basic Fifth Amendment

But that

does not mean that W© should not perfect our understanding
:. its ©ssential
puavotees in full effect, wholly unimpaired* while defining
its limits in such a way as to preserve other values which
are consistent with or are indeed required by the Ocvv 1YY tY;;,..
Now, let mo suggest the following considerations:
As to evidence first discovered after immunity
has been granted, there should be a heavy burden on the
government to show that any such evidence is not the fruit
of a lead or clue resulting from or uncovered by the
compelled testimony»

This should not be a conclusive

presumption because there can be cases where the government
can demonstrate that such evidence was independently derived.
It corno a in the mail, for ©sample, the day after the testimony
was .aiven wad it had boon postmarked in Franco a week before..
The government can show there that the evidence it
has was not a result of the compelled testimony*
Q,

You talked about a presumption, and 1 missed

tho presumption, that you just told us now should not be
conclusive *
MR. GRISWOLD:

I simply cay that — I said burden,

there should b© a heavy burden on the government to show that

its evidence was not derived directly or indirectly

Q,

I don't have the case in mind* but he

referred to some California eases —
MR* GRISWOLDS

Neither do I.

It will bo more rare,

I think, that the government will want to use or should be
able to use evidence which first cam© to its attention after
testimony was compelled and extended-use immunity was granted*
Q,

Well, Mr, Solicitor General, what about- the

situation that on© Counsel in on© of the previous cases
indicated, where the government does compel

a testimony

and the testimony is given and this induces the prosecutor
use the testimony except to launch an investigation
aad by independent moans, wholly unrelated to the testimony
\pt by the fact that it was given, search out, independently ■

32

i-a. CrRISWOLD:

That is a hard question, hut I think
ition was the consequence

of the evidence being' given, that then the evidence is some­
thing which was indirectly derived as a result of the
testimony given*
Q,

Would you —

HR. GRISWOLD;

I would construe

directly and

indirectly quite broadly and I would put the burden on the
government with respect to evidence derived after the
testimony is given.
Q,

So "but for," you put on a "but for" test in

the sense that except for the testimony the government would
never have had it;
HR. GRISWOLD;

Almost,

Justice,

On the other

hand, I hat© very much to give conclusions about purely
hypothetical eases, knowing full well the practical situations

that cap. arise which will make it look differently, but I’m
perfectly free to say that I think there should be a, heavy
burden on the government to show that the evidence it wants
to use was not directly or indirectly derived from the
testimony.
Q

Hr. Solicitor General, would you agree that

r.: tonal, will Initiate an investigation simply because a

MR. GRISWOLD:

Yea —

That and nothing more ««•

MR, GRISWOLD:

that? and let’s 'look up this and see what we can find and
then, surprisingly enough, they do find something —
Q,

valid.

That prosecution is perfectly

On the other hand, once.you have given immunity

under a statute which says that the evidence shall not be
used directly or indirectly in the prosecution, of the
defendant, 1 think there is a heavy burden on the government,
but I want to point out —
Q.

Let mo carry it on© step further.' So

an investigation by a collateral prosecutorial agency is

triggered by the more fact that someone is subpoenaed to
come before a grand jury, before ho ever asks & question,
isn’t that true?
HR. GRISWOLDS
Q,

Yes, that could be,

So that there arc many circumstances which

trigger or set off investigations by law enforcement agencies?
MR. GRISWOLD:
the

There are many circumstances.

0&

which says that

.••■Tidonce compelled shall not bo used directly or indirectly

34
the accused, and 1 think, in a proper construction of
the Fifth- Amendment that that should be

given a broad

interpretation.
But in many cases of the evidence, the government
has empl© evidence before the extended use«iaraunity ia granted*
the government’s need and objective is not to got evidence
against this defendant font rather to get his testimony
against another and usually moro important defendant*

Let

no tal-.ee the example of a man who is arrested red-handed

driving a truck filled with stolen televisions.

They’ve got

fingerprints! they’ve got eyewitnesses who saw every stage of
its they’ve got his signature on a receipt that ho signed
for the goods.

There isn’t any question about their having

sufficient evidence to prosecute him.

Proposal is mad© that

he should plead guilty and testify against his principals
and hop® that he’ll got a lighter sentence, but he refuses»
Still, they want to get testimony against the big operators#
Els testimony may be essential if the ringleaders are to be
brought to justice.
As things were before 1970# his testimony could he
izc.C. only at the price of giving him complete amnesty, although

the government already has plenty of evidence against him.
....-..•deed, why in the -world should he plead guilty end hope for

Another aspect of it —
Q.

Well^ taking your hypothetical oase, what on

earth are you giving this fellow when you give him this
kind of immunity?

You are giving him nothing at all*

MR» GRISWOLD t

You are giving him immunity

against the us© of the evidence which ho gives and its fruits.
Q

But by your hypothesis —»

MR* GRISWOLDS

By ay hypothesis* that will not ««

but that's all the Constitution requires is that he not bo
required to testify against himself, and you're not going to
use any of this testimony*

Incidentally* if you an©

required to give him. transactional immunity* he can simply
go :ua and testify and say,

"Yes, I saw a murder committed*

was standing there." And refuse to say anything

more*

I

He now

hao complete immunity against prosecution for any part of th©
mnrcioa because that was a transaction as to which he testified,
With respect to use-immunity, he will got Immunity
only with respect to what he does testify and thus he will
tost^.xy much more widely and freely under uso-iassxmity than
under ^ransaeta.onal immunity*

Giving him extended us©—

immunity leaves him no worse than ho was before.

It does

independent of the test:!

.

...

&uC can ho used so that this cleanly guilty nan will not

go soot free.
Let mo put the same thing in another way, because
this has a relation to the Sixth Amendment and its
eu:c.8tituticn&lly«guara»teed right that the defendant shall
have compulsory process of witnesses»

How, suppose 'you

were prosecuting A and B, and B says —«* coses to the District
Attorney and says,, "1*21 going to use A as a witness in my
behalf," and A says, "nothing doing, X can’t testify without
showing X was there and that will incriminate mo *"
tc the District Attorney, "Well, give him immunity."
the District Attorney says, "Nothing doing.

B says
And

I can only give

him transactional immunity and I'm not going to lot Mm off#
We know well ho is guilty."
But it the District Attorney can give him ue©«*
immunity, then B can get the benefit of A'e testimony, such
as it is, without A having to be given a pardon or amnesty,
and thus there seems to me that, somewhat as in the Simmons

Xf&OffiMaoMMag»

case, where the Fifth and the Fourth Amendments were pressed
together, wo have here a way in which the allowance of uso~
1-u amity under the Fifth Amendment will help to support the
u.:?uAscry process which is given by the Sixth Amendment*
Xou are not proposing the defense counsel be

37
empowered to give a witness —

Q,

Ho, Ms?. Justice, only the —

*-« use- immuni t y ?

MR# GRISWOLD:

Well, nobody can give immunity

undes? the statute except with the approval of the Attorney
General, th© Deputy Attorney General, or a designated
Assistant Attorney General#
Q,

At that point, Ms?. Solicitor General, there

is no court supervision, however, over the granting of it*

MR* GRISWOLD:

There is, Mr* Justice, there Is no

court supervision and I don't think there should be*

This is

a ~~ this :1s a part of the prosecutor's judgment, but very
narrowly limited.

Incidentally, the other parts of the

statute provide that with respect to administrative agencies,

the Attorney General has an absolute veto*

They can't do it

unless he approves#
With respect to Congressional committees, It

requires a majority of the House of Congress or two-thirds
of a committee and it must be submitted to the Attorney
General for at least 20 days*

He does not have a veto power*

Mow, there are arguments about the use of testimony
to impeach the fact that th© evidence might conceivably
have • some . effect on eros e-examinati on,

My time has expired

but I would suggest that there are problems about waiver

His counsel can. object to the question, at any time

and if the court finds that the question is derived indirectly
by way of using the evidence which was obtained under
compulsion, the court should exclude the testimony and, if
necessary, it could come to this Court for review*
We think that the Court has already established
that what I have called "extended uae-limanity" complies
ifth Amendment.

There are undoubtedly peripheral

problems that will have to be considered over the years, but
as far as this case? is concerned, we think the judgments
below should be affirmed,
Q,

Is there any question in • your mind that this

Statute 6002 would govern the use of any evidence or of its
fruits in any kind of a state proceeding?
Mi. GRISWOLDS

I think as far ac I ha concerned,

ic© — of course, I- am representing the Fedor.
Government and state officers might feel differently *»- but
I think under some decisions of this Court and the supremacy
of power, if federal immunity is granted, it is binding on
the states.
Q,

To the full extent?

To the full extent.

protects against use in criminal cases and that’s all the
Constitution protects against, "No person shall bo compelled

to testify «*» be a witness against himself in any criminal

The second point I want to make and demonstrate

roly upon the rule that the government must show that it
has not discovered —" rather than us© th© discoverable rule»
I would

'point

out to this Court that we are talking about

the rules as they now exist and are followed in the various
circuits and in th© states and therefore if th© Court is of
a Mnd to — to be thinking in terms of use«iztsmmi.ty, it

seems to rae that the very minimum that is required at this
point is to straighten out the rules first before use-immunity
be considered, oven, as within the scope of the Fifth

Amendment,
Th© other point

I

want to make is that, although

the government hero talks about having ampla evidence before —
h© cites that example about the accused that has ample
evidence before he is given immunity, 1 would say to the
government, why don51 they cot a conviction?

Then, when
