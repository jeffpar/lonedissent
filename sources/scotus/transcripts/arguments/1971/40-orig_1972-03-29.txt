ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERMANN ROSENBERGER, II, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFF PENNSYLVANIA
MR. ROSENBERGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, Members of

the Court:
This is an original action initiated by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania between the states to determine
a controversy as to the application of the law set down in
Texas v. New Jersey to instances of intangible obligations
where the debtors' records with varying degrees of frequency
do not indicate the identity or street address of the
creditor.

With specific respect to Western Union, this

action requests a declaratory judgment as to which state
should be assigned priority for purposes of escheatin

dollars of unclaimed debts arising from the sale of

Pennsylvania and the other states, excepting New
York, support a rule which, like that of Texas v. New Jersey.
will give preference to the state where the creditor is
deemed to have last resided and the debt was payable as shown
by the debtor *s records.

This would be the state where

the creditor’s right accrued, the state of purchase where
a draft has not been issued to the sendee, or the state cf
destination where a draft was so issued'but not negotiated.

Such a rule would not only reflect th® underlying realities
of the transaction involved but would bs equitable to the
scheating states and would distribute escheats among the
states in proportion to the commercial activities of its

New York supports a rule which, on the facts of the

respect to money orders and travelers checks, that that
address will be deemed to be in the state of sale.

Sixteen

states, including the four that I just mentioned, implicitly
provide for the same presumption by adopting a state-of-sale
test with respect to money orders and travelers checks.
And the revised uniform disposition of unclaimed property
act which was passed in 1966 and adopted or approved by the
American Ear Association in the same year also provides for
a state-of-sale test with respect to this particular class
of property.
A further reason for the institution of this
action is that Western Union's records reflect two possible
creditors, the sender and the sendee of the telegraph money
order, but do not denominate either as such.

The Special

Master found that the creditor in all instances, save where
a draft is issued to the sendee, is the purchaser.
this finding all parties agree,,

And with

The Master further found

that any rule should foe applicable to all involved
transactions regardless of their dat

origin, before 1958

or after 1950, and with this no party has taken exception.

;e considered a

Jersey, all the states to this litigation, nave Net* Yah;.,
vigorously take exception to his report.

In deciding this

case the Court is bound by neither statute or precedent,
save its decision in Texas v. Mew Jersey,

which was the

first which involved such a controversy between the states.
Pennsylvania’s position today is twofold..

First,

that in Texas v. New Jersey the Court was basically concerned
with the state which should foe given priority for the
purposes of scheat.

And, within that, context, the word,

"address" refers to the state in which the creditor . is
to reside and not his street address.

This is essentially

a matter of semantical interpretation.
Secondly, we would urge the Court that if in fact
"address" did mean street address in the context of Texas v.
New Jersey, then that rule should be modified to fit the
distinctive circumstances concerning the sort of transaction
which we are involved with in a money order situation.
With respect to the first point, the Court
specifically said in Texas v. New Jersey that it was not
concerned with technical concepts of domicile and residence
in determining an interstate controversy.

Western Union's

record and those of other affected enterprises always show
the location and the state where its escheatabla obligations
were purchased.

But in many instances they do not show the

8
creditor's identity or street address.
instances where applications

Even. in those

retained by Western Union do

show identity and street address, the cost of surveying and
reporting the information would be prohibitive in terms of
the funds involved; and even in your Court you said that it
is not feasible to do so.
As far as over-the-counter money orders and
travelers checks are concerned, such records are never
maintained, as they are not required by the business.
The states that have adopted the state-of-sale
test with respect to money orders and travelers checks and
the four states California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina,
and Indiana, which have a presumption right in their
statute that for purposes of this situation where there is
no address, it will be presumed that the purchaser of the
obligation resides in the state of purchase.

We would suggest

to the Court that to up'noId or to determine chat in fact
there was no rational basis for this presumption, to
overturn those statutes and the uniform act as suggested
by New York, would be to destroy that presumption without
any evidence on the record that in fact it. is an invalid
presumption.
In fact, Pennsylvania offered to the Special
Master a 1963 survey conducted by Western Union of all
escheatable items or unclaimed items which totaled 2951 in

9
that particular year.

In 1740 items the address of the

sender was in the same state as the state in which the
application originated„

In 1066 of the items or in more

than one-third; 33-1/3 percent, there was no address given

application.

The sender had not filled in his

a different state than where the application originated.
Thus, in those items, the 1740 items where in fact there
was an address, in 93 percent of the cases the address of the
purchaser and the state

in which the investigation indicated

that he resided coincided.
The Special Master rejects this survey in its
report, stating New York's objection that, one., it was not
properly authenticated; secondly, it is irrelevant because
it pertains to a survey that was done one year after the
last year involved in Pennsylvania’s complaint.

I would

suggest to the Court that for this item of secondary evidence.
that this survey was as revealing, as authenticated and as
relevant as the survey mentioned in the stipulation between
the parties and in the facts in that stipulation several
of which involved years prior to 1961.
But even if in fact the Court does not accept -/this
survey which has been submitted to the Court with the other
papers by the Special Master, the Court can take judicial
notice that the presumption .of the states which have this

Pennsylvania and the other states when it suits its

As I have already advised the Court with respect

to their abandoned property act. with respect to chess
institutions which are incorporated outside of New York and
which issue obligations in New York, New York provides for
custody in that state when those obligations were issu
in New York State.

And presently the Department of Audit

and Control in New York has presented to the Legislature
and it's up for final reading at this time a bill that would
provide for escheat to New York in the case of securities
which have been sold in New York without reference to any
last known address of the 'creditor or in fact where there? is
no last known address but without reference to the question
as to whether or not the broker is incorporated in New York
or not.
Secondly, even if the Court holds that the last
known address rule as stated in Tessas v. New Jersey referred
to street address and was not simply a shorthand for
determining that state which would ba given priority in the
ific instance, the facts of the underlying cl<
transaction in the instant cate justify a modification of

In the former situation the debtor

Do you mean by that, Mr. Rosenberger, that

MR. ROSENBERGERs

Yes, Your Honor, T. think in fact

the test that I am discussing is that the escheat would be
given to the state where the creditor's right was accrued,
namely the state of issue in all cases except where a draft
was issued in' the receiving state.

Western Union's records,

their ledger records, show in each instance the location and
state of purchase, and their records also show where in fact
drafts' have been issued.

So that I do not believe that it

would require anything significant to determine it.
Finally, it would foster certainty because there
are no factual issues left to resolve.

this was another indication that the Court in Texas v, Hew

The question was priorities be;

In that taking, of course, there were -<o if&

However, where there was no address of th: person
entitled thereto shown on the books and records, and re ire
suggesting as a substitution, where there is no indication
on the books and records of the state in which the creditor's
right was incurred, then it was given, and only then—and,
f

e, the Court specified that they presumed this

situation would arise infrequently, with relative
infrequency— then and only then was it given to the state
of Sun Oil’s incorporation» subject to the right of any other
state to recover the property upon proof that the last known

And then finally where the creditor state did not

allowed to recover from the state of incorporation at any
time it subsequently passed such an escheat statute.

New Jersey filed a motion for the Court to modify that
decree, urged that it would result in uncertainty, and the
Court denied the motion.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF F. MICHAEL AHERN, ESQ,,, ON
BEHALF OF INTERVENOR-PX-AINTIFF CONNECTICUT
MR. AHERK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In the interests of brevity and in order to avoid
repetition, the State of Connecticut subscribes to the era!
arguments advanced here this morning by ray colleague from the
State of Pennsylvania.

I would just like to.touch on one

point which has not been mentioned.
Under the recommendation of the 'Special Master in
this case, the State of New York will take all of the
unclaimed money presently held by Western Union.

In. its

oral argument and in its briefs, New .York emphasizes the fact
that under the New York abandoned property law there is no
statute of limitations and therefore the owners of this
property or these monies will be protected, because the
state of New York will not be in a position to .foreclose
their claiming it at any time in the future.

The inference

is that the State of New York will hold these monies ad
infinitum.
However, I submit that there is no prohibition
which I am aware of whereby the State of New

York Legislature

could, not pass amendatory legislation which would provide
tho escheat of these funds to the State of New York.
What i am suggesting to this Court is that whatever states

Justice Rehnquist, but they wouldn't be able to use the
funds.

If they passed an escheat law, they would eventually

be able to use the funds themselves.
Q

But if New York moved in that direction, would

it not be - within the power of this
of some nature on it to be sura that no subsequent legisla­
tion of New York could alter that status?
MR. AHERN;

I would assume the Court could issue

such an order, yes. Chief Justice Burger.
Q

And a state the size of New York, with its

enormous operations, undoubtedly has bank balances many,

MR. AHERN;

That may be true, Mr. Chief Justice,

but with the continuing cry for more revenue by all of the
stater;, X think the State- of New York is seeking this money
for purposes other than, just to hold it eustodially, or they
wouldn't have the fine array of legal talent here

ORAL ARGUMENT Of MRS, WINIFRED L. WENTWORTH,
ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANT FLORIDA
MRS. WENTWORTH s

Mr. Chief Justice„ and may it

please the Courts
The State of Florida, as I think counsel for
Pennsylvania has indicated, now joins that state and the
other parties which are now unanimous in opposition to Net-;
York in this case.

The State of Arisons, which h s also-

coincided with-Florida's position in the case,, also nor
joins in the Pennsylvania position in asking the Court to
reject the conclusion of the Special Master and to clarify
and to apply the creditor address rule adopted in the Texas
case.

We believe that the opinion in -chat case, in

referring to the state of the last known address of a
creditor, according to the debtor's books, did not state and
did not intend that the address must be an address specifically
declared by the creditor for resident purposes but instead
that apparent reference was to a geographic creditor
reference, creditor address, which we believe is what is
shown by Western Union records in this case as to
f :ic

debtor to keep records of the residence or street or
domiciliary address of the creditor.
In addition, there are very few instances when a
purchaser designating a place different from the Western
Onion office would result in a different distribution which
is shown by Pennsylvania's argument in this case.,
Florida’s original argument was based on the same
construction of the Texas case but depended upon in part the
definition of a creditor under our particular statute as
the payee of an obligation, and upon, a different view of the
particular contract involved in this case, in the case of
Western Union money orders.
We now accept the Master’s construction of the
contract and abandon the contention the destination state
would be the proper party for escheat purposes.

The position

was presented for the purpose of attain a full consideration
all of the possible applications of the Texas rule and
to obtain its clarification.

In spite of those questions

that we have raised, we believe that the record and. the
briefs of all the parties in this case will show the greater
virtue of Pennsylvania’s argument, and we now join them
because of the need for a rule that is both reasonable and
of very wide applicability under all types of escheat or
custodial-taking laws and as to a wide variety of intangible
properties0

We urge the Court to apply the Texas decision

21
to preserve the creditor address rule in accord with its
primary intention in that case to give weight to the fact
that the debt is the property of the creditor and not the
debtor9 and to permit the domiciliary escheat only if# in
this case# Western Union's records should in seme isolated
instance fail to show the address of the office where this
money is payable, where the obligation was issued and where
it could be refunded to its creditor, or where the stats
that would have that right has no escheat law.
Thank you.

In Teras against New Jersey* which dealt with
various categories of unclaimed property* including
unclaimed checks, owing to creditors some of whose last
mailing addresses were unknown—and this is stated in the
Court's opinion—the Court granted leave tc
complaint in that case because it had made its determination
in Western Union that only one state could escheat particular
property.

The Court said that since the states separately

were without power to settle the controversy, a rule should
be adopted by tiie Court which "will settle the question of
which state will be allowed to escheat this intangible
property."
Texas in that case argued for the context test.

the question in permanent turmoil and the question should

MR. GREENFIELDS

In the first place. Your Honor,

I think that the place of issuance will frequently differ
from the place of origin, and that as an important concept—
Q

I'm talking about the place where someone

goes in, puts the money on the counter, and gets the money
order, whatever name you want to give that place.
MR. GREENFIELD:

I think that the record in

Western Union against Pennsylvania will perhaps answer that
question best.

In Western Union against Pennsylvania there

was a stipulation between the two parties to that litigation,
Western Union and Pennsylvania, in which they stipulated
that in many cases the state of office of origin did not
coincide with the state of last known address of the
creditor.

And in the jurisdictional statement filed in

that case by Western Union, the following appears.
Q

Of course, that’s because a lot of the factors

in cases of this kind are simply unknowable and the pursuit
to get the details in each instance would be too costly to
determine.

Western Union are maintained in such a fashion that the

It is possible to determine

in many of these cases what the last known address of the
creditor is, and this isn’t merely a matter of the practical
application of a search for those last known addresses,

I

don't think that the question of escheat should depend upon
whether 'or not a particular debtor keeps adequate records.

Cheaper space.

MR. GREENFIELD:

That probably is one of the

reasons„
I would like, Mr. Chief Justice, to refer to the
jurisdictional statement because reference has been made by
Pennsylvania to the fact that there is some kind of
presumption that’s available that the. state of last known
address follows -Idle state of office of origin., and this is
the jurisdictional statement which was made by Western
Union in the Western Union against Pennsylvania case, and I
quote:

"Either as to payees who receive drafts at offices

of the appellant in Pennsylvania there is no showing and
there can be no basis for presuming that they were
residents of Pennsylvania at the time of receipt.”
Q

Isn’t that a fairly likely thing to follow if

MR. GREENFIELD:

The significance of the point 1

made was this, Judge, that Pennsylvania is relying upon
the presumption of the state of origin being the state of
last known address»

The point I’m making is that there is

no proof in this record, there is no basis

for the

presumption in this record before this Court, for such a
determination»

And the only thing that you have to rely

upon is something that is ephemeral
in the situation.

a mobile society and I know that you're fully awa

Q

Mr. Greenfield, in connection with your

reference to that record in Western Union v,. Pennsylvania,
even assuming that the payees are very likely to be away
from home,, is it more likely perhaps that the senders are
closer to home than the payees?
MR. GREENFIELD:

There is that possibility, but I

simply point out to you, Judge, that on the state of the
record before this Court there is no basis for the
presumption urged by Pennsylvania.

You're saying what Justice White suggested to you.

Isn't that a matter that is so commonly related to ordinary

As a fact,

couldn't this Court or the Master judicially notice that
for the most part people send money orders from home base
to some other place, to the son in college, to an impecunious
relative, to friends who wire us for some money, or one of
your children is on a vacation?
MR. GREENFIELD:

presumption.
Q

That there was what?

MR. GREENFIELD;
basis for this presumption.
Q

Then in effect we’re to decide the case

without having that knowledge or any basis for fair
presumptions? is that your position?
MR. GREENFIELD?
the way I would put it.

No, I don’t think that's quite
I think that the Court has an

obvious right to recognise what it considers to ba the
ordinary state of facts.

What I am saying and what I have

continued to say, that in the state of this record there is
no basis for that presumption.

Furthermore, both of the

parties, both Pennsylvania and Western Union, had said, in
the past that there is no basis for such a determination.
In Texas against New Jersey the Court rejected a context;
test theory and adopted the rule that is well known to this
Court, and that .is that as to each item of property, the
property should go to the state' of last known address of the
creditor as

n on the books of the debtor corporation;

and the secondary rule was that the state of domicile of
poration would take if that address was not available,
I think something has been made by Pennsylvania of the fact
that this theory requires that there be a last known street
3

ouch showing but merely requires the.showing that the last
known address of the eraditor was within a particular state.

Mr. Greenfield; in th is connection, how do you

Q

define creditor in that contest?
MR. GREENFIELD;

This has been defined by the

Special Master I think satisfactori ly to everybody involved
in the case.

In the case in which a money order is issued,

the person to whom it is issued is the creditor.

In the

case where a money order is issued to th© payee, he is the
*

creditor.

In the case where a money order is sent for the

benefit of a payee but he doesn’t pick it up, the money
order is cancelled, provision is made for the sender to be
notified that he should pick up the funds*

A draft may be

issued to him under those circumstances, in which event he
is the creditor.

But, to answer your question as concisely

as I can, the sender is the creditor unless a money order
has been issued to the payee, in which event the payee is
the creditor.
Reference was mads to the Special Master’s report
insofar as its requirements concerning the burden of proof.
I would like again to point out that the Special Master
reported that the creditor’s last known address is his
.

■

Initial

c

-

a par icular office of origin might really be a matter of
choice or convenience.

And the Special Master pointed out

too that the sender might have been in that jurisdiction for
1 ur yr for a day.

I don’t think it’s necessary any

longer to respond to the contentions of

vie

the fact that they have now joined the Pennsylvania position.
But X would point to the fact that in his conclusion, the
Special Master determined that the Texas rule is a simple
and workable formula and that it sets an easily
administered standard, preventing multiple claims and giving
all parties a fixed and reliable rule,,

To adopt a rule of

the kind that is now sponsored by Pennsylvania

and its

adherents, it would seam to us it brings us into the kind of
problem that Mr, Justice Stewart referred to in his two
dissents in the Western Union case and in the Texas against
Mew Jersey case—that is, that those cases would cause nova
problems than they solve.

And the point that I'm making

by stating that is that if reliance is to be had upon such
a thing as a presumption of the office of origin being the
state of last known address, then 1 suggest that the Court is
leaving itself in for determinations in every kind of case
hich the factual situation differs from Texas against
New Jersey*
Q

I take it if there wouldn't be any argument

about varying from the Texas rule, if Western Union kept its
records in this case so that the address of the sender was

Mrs. Wentworth said.
We would suggest that in grafting upon the Texas

Mr. Greenfield, you refer to the fact that

New York has an abandoned property custody statute rather
than an escheat statute.

As a practical matter, after a

few years have gone by and there has been no private claim,
isn't the real problem between possible states claiming
escheat rather than the possibility of some unknown claimant
will show up, so far as the great majority of the funds
held, under New York statutes?

making, I assume, is that if the funds are not claimed,
another state can ultimately come in and say this money
belongs to us»

But tills Is exactly what Texas against

Hew Jersey said.

Texas against New Jersey says that when

funds are paid to the domiciliary state in the absence of a
last known address on the books of the debtor corporation,
it is subject to reclamation by another state up an a «bowing
that the last known address wan in that state.
Q

If Mew York has custody of the money and has

the benefit of a rule which prevents any other state from
coming in and showing a superior rule, New York has pretty
well got an escheat, hasn’t it, so far as the benefit of
the money is concerned?
MR. GREENFIELD:

As I said before, Judge, I don’t

think that it is fair to characterise that as an

escheat

because we have a history of considerable amounts of claims
made after property has been paid into cur abandoned property
fund.
Q

What is to prevent the New York Legislature

fro* adopting an escheat statute tomorrow?
MR. GREENFIELD:

There is nothing to prevent the

New York State Legislature from adopting such a statute, but
I would simply call to your attention that the preamble to

know of no movement in the State of New York to turn this
statute into an escheat statute.
I would call the attention of the Court to the
fact, as I did before, that this Court did not close its
eyes as to the Western Union situation when it determined
Texas against New Jersey,

Indeed, I've already noted th:

Court based its determination in Texas that leave should foe
granted to file a complaint because it had held in Western
Union against Pennsylvania that the due process clause
prevented any one state from escheating a given item of
property.

Thus, when the Court decided Texas against New

Jersey, it had already been confronted with the factual
situations with which we are confronted here today.

And,

accordingly, it was thoroughly aware of those facts when it
formulated the unqualified Texas rule for disposition of
intangibles of all kinds.
As I have indicated before, the Pennsylvania
assertion that the predominant right of the state where fcl
transaction or purchase occurred is not really based upon
such statutes as the uniform disposition of unsi

■

act which, it is said, has bean adopted by a number of nt-vba

it is uniform

generally only to' the word "uniform.1’

The uniform statute,»

is a.'dopted by. the V&Z3

the revised uniform disposition, of unclaimed property act,
does not provide for taking by a state, which is the office

of origin*

If provides'for taking by a state in which the

written instruments are issued»

And then significantly

'the uniform act also provides that the state in which that
act is adopted will not claim the money if another state in
which the last known address resides, takes the property
and has a reciprocal provision with the other state».
If the Pennsylvania proposal is to be considered,
then if would seem to us that other and equally and perhaps
more compelling material alternatives should be considered
by the Court.

For example, and I think this is pointed. \ip

by at least one decision by this Court, Connecticut Ail
Insurance against Ward.

Should you not be considering sucl

things as the place of residence of the sender when he

died and the place where the sender was last known to
reside or the place of a proved later or longer residence of

And the test that suggests

that the Court should examine the circumstances surrounding

You

would have perhaps hundreds of cases of this kind before
you.
Consequently, this Court should refuse to adopt
the rule which results in treating this subject on a ease-by
case basis, and. we submit that the rule adopted in Texas
against New Jersey is fully applicable here and that the
proposed decree of the Special Master should be adopted.

Mr., Chief Justice and Members

of the Court:
I will try not to burden you with too much

41
additiona^ ^*-ITiQ'

First of ell, Mr. Greet field indicated ■

the Special Master had. found tl

there was no rational

basis for the presumption which has been incorporated in the
statutes in four states and is implicitly incorporated in the
uniform disposition of unclaimed property act.

In fact, at

page 18 of his report, the Master found—the Master stated,
and I quote:

"Frequently, perhaps usually, this ofrie

and his domicile would coincide, but it is clear that money
orders must frequently be bought away from home.”
I think the record of the '63 survey, which is
before the Court, the Court can consider that, shows that
in fact it is much more than usually that the two offices
coincide and that this comports with common expo.<r.tera*
With respect to the application forms,
Mr. Greenfield indicated that these application forms are
available.

Stipulation indicates or contains as an exhibit

a letter from Western Union in which.it is stated that these
application forms range from poor to fair, condition.

And

as the 563 survey indicated, in at least one-third of the
«

•

cases no address is given on the application forms.
At Exhibit 16

to the stipulation there is a lis

of the records which are available by division, and generally

The application forms are

So that if in fact we are

forced to try to determine the last known address in each
of these situations, there will be a considerable number of
situations where it will not be possible to do so.
any event, it will require needless expense oi

And, in

Arizona, Mr. Justice Blackman, has also abandoned

MR. ROSEHBERGER:

Ho.

They have not officially

the public good and concern.

The question and the

rlue its citizens, but also as a source of public’ revenue.
And the Court very well treated that matter in Texas v.
ftlew Jersey in devising a rule which would equitably distribute
these monies across the country.

It is Pennsylvania’s

position, and New York to the contrary, where they sag there
is a hundred possible situations where we could argue 7777
variance from Texas v% New Jersey.

I still believe tb

are only two basic situations, and that is where the
creditor ordinarily for commercial reasons keeps sis-.
address on his record and the present situation where v~
are dealing with issuers of bearer obligations where there
is absolutely no reason, and the cost would be great if not
prohibitive, to maintain such records.

Because of that

because of the fact there is no equity in New York’s,
position that adoption of the Master's Report in that
respect could not be acceptable to the great majority of the
states, I urge the Court to find consistently with the
