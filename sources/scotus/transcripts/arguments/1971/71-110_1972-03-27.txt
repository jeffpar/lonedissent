MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll hear arguments

next in No. 71-110, Gelbard and Parnas against the United
States.
Mr. Tigar, you may proceed when you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT'OF MICHAEL E. TIGAR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONERS
MR. TIGAR;

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it

please the Court:
I seek in this argument to show on constitutional
statutory premises that the opinion below is an unwarranted
assault upon the settled principles of personal liberty
and would permit the government to violate the law without
paying a price for doing so.

The issue, if the Court please,

is whether a. grand jury witness under compulsion to testify
may prevent the use of wiretap material obtained in violation
of his or her r ights against him or her in the. grand jury
proceeding.
The facts are these.

David Gelbard and Sidney

Parnas were subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury
in Los Angeles in February, 1971.

They became aware that

they had been overheard on a court-ordered'wiretap conducted
under the provisions of the 1968 Omnibus Crime Bill.

The

government conceded that it intended to use the transcripts
of petitioners' overheard conversations to refresh

4
petitioners * recollection and to formulate questions to them
before the grand jury.

Thus, the government admits that it

intended to disclose or cause disclosure of overheard
conversations of these petitioners.
The petitioners claim that the tape were illegal
and refused to answer questions until they were afforded a
hearing at which the legality issue could be determined and,
under what the government terms in its brief in the Egan
case, the constitutional rule of Silver!-.horne, the

government

foreclosed from disclosing this material in questioning
petitioners.

The District Court denied a hearing and ordered

petitioners summarily committed for civil contempt.

The

Court of Appeals affirmed and this Court granted certiorari.
Our argument embraces three points, if the Court
please.

First, if disclosure is permitted before the grand

jury in questioning these petitioners, they will suffer a
harm of which the law can take notice.

Second, there is a

remedy, constitutional, inherent power, and statutory, for
this harm.

And, third, I’d like to deal with the.

implications of the government’s position here.
The government says in its brief that the harm that
one suffers frcn being the victim of a wiretap is ended when
the tap is disconnected.
Q

Is what?

MR. TIGAR:

Is ended?
Is ended when the tap is disconnected.

5

That is, Mr. Justice Stewart, there is no further harm from
disclosing this material, even assuming if was illegally
overheard.

This is not the rule this Court has established.

It is not the rule, for example, of Sllverthorne v. United
States, of Go-Bart Importing Company v. United States and,
although the case rests on statutory premises, Nardone v.
United States, Rea v. United States, and other cases decided
by this Court.

It is not the rule as established in such

an elementary treatise as Prosser on Torts, which identifies
public disclosure of private facts as a crucial element
of the tort law right of privacy.
Q

Mr. Tigar—

MR. TIGAR:
Q

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

—in your case as distinguished from those

that are do follow, was the wiretap authorised by warrant?
MR, TIGAR:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it was.

in

both cases we have court-ordered wiretaps in which a
determination of probable cause was made against other ■'
persons than the petitioners.

The petitioners wandered into

the ambit of these court-ordered wiretap's.
I was just coining to that, Mr. Chief Justice,
because the third kind of harm we're talking about here is
this statutory harm under the very act under which the
warrants were issued.

That is to say, Section 2511 of Title

,18 makes it a federal crime to disseminate information

6

unlawfully obtained by wiretapping and electronic surveillance.
‘iV'u.s, the petitioners would be victims of such a federal
crime before the grand jury.

And, indeed, looking at 2510

or 2520 of Title 18, one can sea that the quid pro quo
which Congress exacted for granting this broad power to tap
and bug was a sat of very detailed limitations upon the
manner in which this material is to be used.
If then there is harm here to the petitioners,
what is the remedy.

The government, if the Court please,

concedes at page 23 of its brief in the Egan case, which it
adopts as its brief in our case, that if there was a pre­
subpoena adjudication that these taps were illegal, the
Court in adjudicating them illegally under what it aptly
terms the constitutional rule of Silverthorne would and could
prohibit the government frora using this illegally obtained
naterial against these petitioners in this very grand jury
proceeding.

That is, petitioners could hire a lawyer, file

a civil suit under the authority of Go-Bart Importing
Company or Rea against United States or the Bivvens case
decided in this Court a short time ago, and invoke a
consistent course of federal decision going back 60 years

to Wise y. Henlc’.e in 220 U« S.

They would claim that the

inherent power of a federal court could be used, reaching
out, the federal equity power, to enjoin the government from
asking use of this material..

7
Of course*- as this Court has heard this morning
ir, argument in the

Tatum case,, the government might claim

ir.. such a civil suit that the case wasn't ripe for an
injunction to issue»

That is, that the petitioners could

not before they received the subpoena demonstrate the kind
of immediate harm that the federal equity power is customarily
used to protect against.

But petitioners' case, if the

Court please, could not be more right.

And that is why it

is incredible to us that the government won't go the last
six inches with us, since they have agreed on just about
everything else, and say that when the petitioners are
standing in the jailhouse door, that surely they have a right
to prevent the use against them of this material.
The petitioners are not like the defendant in the
case of Blue against United States, in the position of a
gratuitous intervener in the grand jury, who merely suspects
that he orshe is being talked about in the secrecy of the
grand jury room and wants to stop the grand jury process.
No, they are standing in the jailhouse door because the
material the government admits is going to be used against
them in the grand jury room.
So, this case is no different from asking a District
Court to sustain any other claim of privilege, any other
claim of privacy protecting privilege, if the Court please,
at the behest of any other grand jury witness in any other

8
grand jury in any federal court in the land»
In this connection, we ask the Court to note, as I
mentioned before, petitioners are after all, if this tap is
illegal, being made the victim of a federal crime in the
* grand jury room.

And so the government asks this Court to

break the promise which this Court made in the Alderman
case in two ways.

First,, by negating what Alderman termed

the constitutional rule that forbids using the fruits of
unlawful tapping against persons who, like the petitioners,
are agreed.

And, second, they want to undermine Alderman

by urging this Court to permit the government to commit
the federal crime detailed in Section 2511 and, in this
Court's words, to let those who flout the rules go unscathed
and to cavalierly disregard the rights of persons under the
act.
So,- this Court can decide this case based on
elementary principles of equity jurisprudence with some
attention to the mandate of the Fourth Amendment in
protecting the right of privacy and some attention to the
inherent power in the words of Wise v. Hankie of the District
Court to protect against abuse of its process by its
officers.

The Constitution surely requires no less.
But there is, as two Courts of Appeals, one of them

on banc, have held a statutory ground decision which is
available to the Court in this case.

The 1968 act,

9
Sections 2510 through 2520 of Title 18, provide for notice of
hearing for suppression at the instance of those who, like
petitioners, are about to be harmed by surveillance against
them.

Section 2515 of the act forbids the use of material

unlawfully obtained in any court or grand jury proceeding.
Section 2518
before

of the act in subdivision nine requires that

material obtained under the act is to be used against

a person, there must be ten days notice given to that person.
By the way, this is one answer to the government’s
contention that our position here is to going to sabotage
grand juries.

The government knew it was going to use the

fruits of this tapping against Mr. Gelbard and Mr. Parnas.
If they had sent ten days before that‘grand jury appearance
1

a letter saying we intend to use it, Mr. Gelbard and Parnas
could come into the District Court, ask the District Judge
to look at the order authorizing the tap, gotten a
threshold determination of legality or illegality.
Q

Mr. Tigar, I think I've'heard you sey several

times something to the effect that the government was going
to use this against them.

Are Gelbard and Parnas the

subject of grand jury inquiry?

Are their activities now

being investigated by the grand jury?
MR. TIGAR:

Their conversations are overheard,

Fir. Chief Justice.
Q

What’s the purpose of the grand jury

10

investigation that’s going on?
MR. TIGARs

The grand jury investigation,

Mr. Chief Justice, has thus far resulted in several
indictments.
gambling.

Those are mostly in the field of interstate

One of the people that has been indicted,

Mr. Jerome Zarowitz, was formerly executive vice president
of a hotel called Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Mr. Parnas

is an accountant who works in New York, for Caesar's Palace.
So, so far as we can determine, there is some connection
between what the grand jury indicted about and what they
want to ask Mr. Parnas about.

...

]

With respect to Mr. Gelbard, the questions asked
that are reproduced in the appendix focus on the allegation,
to put it bluntly, that he was the bag man carrying the
proceeds of illegal interstate gaining between Los Angeles
and Las Vegas.
Q

This sounds as though what Parnas and Gelbard

fear is that they may be exposed to some criminal
prosecution.

Is that what you're telling us?

MR. TIGAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, with respect to

Mr. Parnas, the government informs us in a footnote to its
brief that it intends to seek immunity grant for him if he
should return to the-grand jury.

And the government

represented below arid does here that it has no intention at
this time of prosecuting Mr. Gelbard and Mr. Parnas.

So, I

11
think that—
Q.

If he has any such fear, doesn't the Fifth

Amendment give him rather sweeping protection?
MR. TIGAR:

If he were afraid of a criminal

prosecution, yes, Mr. Chief Justice, he could invoke his
privilege against self-incrimination.
Here he is protecting another right.
Q

Isn't that just what you indicated he was

afraid of?
MR. TIGAR;

Mr. Chief Justice, he is of course

afraid of that, as are all citizens faced with government
scrutiny of this kind.

But he's also seeking in this case,

in this proceeding, to protect another right of his.

The

Fourth Amendment, Mr. Chief Justice, is not designed solely
to protect, guilty criminals and those who fear the government
is going to prove that they are guilty criminals.

And

Mr. Parnas and Mr. Gelbard are seeking an application of
their Fourth Amendment rights in the context of this
proceeding which, will vindicate their right of privacy, a
right which is available to them whether or not they fear
prosecution and whether or not they are granted immunity
from prosecution by the government.

They are thus in no

different a position from any person who invokes a privacyprotecting privilege in front of the grand jury regardless
of whether he. fears prosecution by the government.

12
Perhaps I could use an analogy, if I may.

Let us

assume that the FBI? through stealth, listened in on a
conversation between a penitent and a priest engaged in the
ritual of the confession and that thereafter the government
called the penitent before a grand jury and sought to
interrogate him or her about what had been heard in the
confessional.

In such a case, if the government indicated

an intention to use idle transcript of the FBI

agents'

overhearing to refresh the penitent's recollection about
she or he had told the priest, a fair reading of the
clergyman-penitent privilege, at least as it appears in
such statements as that in the proposed federal rules of
evidence, would, it seems to me, permit the witness to
interpose this privacy protecting privilege.

And so here

where the intrusion is illegal under the 1963 act and the
"f

government, admits that it intends to use it, we say that the
law of the right of privacy protectsand of course we
supplement that by saying that irrespective of any Fifth
i

Amendment problems, the statute forbids this material to be
used in the way that the government plans to use it.
Q

Do I’ understand your position to be that any

person that gets in that situation can never be called before
any grand jury under any time or under any circumstances?
MR. TIGARs
our position.

No, Mr. Justice Marshall, that is not

The government could call Mr. Parnas and

was legal.

~

MR. TT.GAR:

The Congress has recently legislated

with respect to this question and purported to set up a
cutoff date with respect to claims of illegality, but passing
that statutory provision the government would, be obliged in
such a case merely to purify its evidence and to show that
the questions it wanted to ask were either so far removed
from the initial illegality so as, in the words of Wong Sun
to dissipate the taint; or, again in the words of Wong Sun,
derive from .an independent source.

And, of course, the rule

of Wong Sun in this connection has subsequently been applied,
I believe, by its citation in the Alderman situation.
the government is not foreclosed

So,

from ever calling them? it

just can’t violate people’s rights without paying the price,
which is that it can't use the fruits of its illegality.
Q

I. am just trying to find out how much price

did you want them to pay.
MR. TXGAR:

No more than the illegality is worth,

14
Mr. Justice Marshall, which is to say they can't exploit
the wrong that they have done.

That's all the limitation

that we want to put on the government in this case.
To all of this the government replies what?

That

the rule which the prior decisions of this Court and the
plain meaning of the act establish would impose too heavy
a burden on the administration of criminal justice.
are two answers to this contention.

There

First, that it isn't

true; and, second, we invite the Court to think of the
alternative.

act.

persons overheard in these taps the right to be notified of
the fact they have been overheard.

Thus, it requires the

brief that in the remand in the Alderman ease they spent

not the petitioners there had been overheard.
understand that.

1 can

This Court knows from bitter experience

how difficult it was to ferret out taps that the FBI had
conducted and subsequently attempted to hide even from
attorneys in the Justice Department.
all of that is supposed to be over.

But under the ‘68 act,
There are supposed to

be records kept and so the notice-giving function that the
act makes a crucial part of its protection of the rights of

IS
the individual can be adhered to, complied with.
There is second the gratuitous assertion that
these petitioners are not trying to protect their rights,
they’re trying to shield somebody else, that if they were
really concerned about themselves they would invoke the
.Fifth Amendment like good citizens and not worry about all
this privacy argument.

They seek, as I mentioned, before,

to protect their own right of privacy.

As Chief Judge

Soboloff said in the case of Lankford y. Gelston, upholding
the use of the federal equity power to issue an injunction
against illegal search, it would be a. grotesque irony if
our courts protect only against the unlawful search which
uncovers contraband by the exclusionary rule while offering

no relief against an admittedly unlawful pattern and
practice affecting hundreds of innocent home owners.
Thus, we are saying here that the privacy
protecting job of the federal district court isn't limited
to saying that contraband seised from somebody who is
proven guilty by the fact the contraband was

seised ought

not to be received in evidence, that the privacy-protection
function arises any time the citizen is about, to be the
victim of an invasion of privacy directed against him or
her.

The government said in Alderman and it said in this

Court and through the words of the Solicitor General, that
it was concerned about people like petitioners, third parties

16
who wander into taps that have been authorized against
somebody else»

We invite the government in this case to

share that concern that we have about these third parties
under these circumstances.
These are not, if the Court pleasethe times of
the Assize of Clarendon in which grand jurors sat under a
tree and gossiped about breaches of the King's peace.

Grand

jury is a formidable force with the power to call on many
investigative agencies to pull people off the streets and
compel them to testify.

some.

There must be limits

Yes, those limits may slow down the process

As we say in our brief, due process is always slower

than summary process or drumhead process or pisto1-at-thehead process or, as in this case, no process at all.
In conclusion, we say only that a great deal has
been written and more said about the wave of recent
congressional legislation on crime.

Many see in these

statutes an unyielding hostility to civil liberty.

But

however these laws may fair here, when measured against the
Constitution this Court should surely' set its face against
any attempt, as in this case, to read out of those statutes
the precious few concessions to personal freedom which they

17
undisputably contain.

The government's position here, if

the Court please, is sabotage.

It is sabotage of the 1968

act, sabotage of 170 years of this Court’s decision, and
sabotage of the rights of liberty and personal security.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Friedman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
think the starting point in this case should
be the law as it existed prior to the 1968 statute.

Our

position in this case is that prior to that law it was
settled that a witness before a grand jury could not
challenge before being required to give testimony before
that grand jury either the evidence which led the grand jury
to summon him or the evidence which was proposed to be used
before the grand jury in examining him;

And our position,

furthermore, is that Congress cannot be -deemed to have
changed this well settled principle without some clear
expression indicating that it intended to do so in the 1968
act^j And when we look at the I960 act, we think not only
does that act not show any congressional decision to change
it but, on the contrary, it affirmatively shows an intention
to continue that rule and not to permit witnesses before a
grand jury to. challenge the evidence before -the grand jury.

18

Prior to turning to this discussion, however,, I'd like to
respond to one question—
Q

Challenge the evidence or decline to answer

questions?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, decline to answer questions,

Mr. Justice, on the basis of the evidence before the grand
jury.
Q

The grand jury is trying to adduce evidence

by getting this witness to answer questions.

What he was

doing, what these two gentlemen were doing, was refusing to
answer questions; isn't that right?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

They were refusing to—

Challenging evidence—-they were asked to give

evidence.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

They refused to answer questions,

Mr. Justice, fox" two reasons.

First, they said the only

reason the grand jury was led to call them was because of
this electronic surveillance and the information it had
obtained.

And, secondly, they said, as the government

recognized, that the evidence obtained from this electronic
surveillance would be used to refresh their recollection.
That is what they objected to.

They said, "We have a right

net to testify before the grand jury until we can first
determine whether or not the evidence which the grand jury
proposed to use in either examining the witnesses or which

19
te grand jury to call the witnesses was the product of
illegal electronic.surveillance.

They want to litigate out

before testifying the question'whether or not there was
improper electronic surveillance related to them.

And our

basic submission to this Court is that they do not have the
right to do that, that that is an issue they can raise ohly
if and when the- evidence is sought to foe used against them—
against them-—in a criminal proceeding,
Q

What evidence?

I'm a little confused.

You

talk about challenging evidence; they were called in order
to give evidence, and you say that they can challenge it
when the evidence is sought to foe used against them.

Are

you talking now about their own answers?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

May I answer it this way, Mr. Justice?

any information which the government obtained as a result
of a search and seizure that was in violation of the Fourth
Amendment can foe excluded by them if they are ever proceeded
against criminally.

They can exclude that.

But we say they

cannot refuse to answer questions put to them before the
grand jury on the claim—on the claim—that this kind of
evidence was tha reason, for their questioning.

They can

claim personal privilege if they claim that -the answers to
these questions ’would tend to incriminate them.
make that claim.

They may

If they claim that the answer to the question
i

would violate any of the traditional privileges, such as

20
the .lawyer-client privilege.
that ground.

They can refuse to answer on

But we say they cannot refuse to answer on the

ground that there was prior illegal electronic surveillance
which either led the grand jury to call them or on the basis
of which they were to be questioned.

They cannot refuse to

give evidence, in other words, before the grand jury on the
basis—on the basis—-of the factors that led the grand
jury to call them.

That's not, we think, an appropriate

issue to litigate in the context of a grand jury proceeding.
Q

What if there is subsequently a criminal trial

in which neither one of these petitioners, neither one of
these parties, is a defendant, somebody else is a defendant,
but they are called as witnesses in the criminal trial,
witnesses for the government or as on' cross-examination by
the government.

Ce.n they do it then?

HR. FRIEDMAN:

No, Mr. Justice. -They can again

refuse to answer any question that might tend to incriminate.
They cannot refuse—
Q

You're not limiting it to a grand jury.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
in this case.

No.

But that’s the only question

Our basic position is that a witness cannot

refuse to answer a question before a grand jury or before a
court on the ground that this question is somehow the result
of soma illegal electronic surveillance.
Q

Of that very witness.

21
MR. FRIEDMANs

Of that very witness.

That is

correct,
Q
trial.

You say he can't even assert that at a criminal

So, you're not limiting your argument to the grand

jury.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No.

Our argument goes beyond that,

and we think that is what the law has always been, that a
mere witness cannot refuse to answer an otherwise proper
question on the claim that previously there had been some
violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment.

He can

refuse to answer any question in terms of permissible
privilege, a privilege that the law allowed.

But he cannot

refuse—•
Q

Well, that's question begging, what is a

permissible privilege.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

We think the permissible privilege

is a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination
and what I would call the personal privilege, where in
contrast to the giving of the testimony which relates to an
allegedly illegal search and seizure, where the mere giving
of the testimony itself breaches the privilege.

That is in

the case, for example, of the lawyer-client communication,
the privilege is breached at the time the witness is forced
to disclose the confidential communication.
In the search and seizure situation., if there has

22
been illegal electronic surveillance

that has happened a

long time before, the question is whether that can now be
made public,

And basically-—basieally-~in case, for example,

of a criminal trial, if a witness declines to answer a
question, claiming the question results from an illegal
search and seizure, what he is really seeking to do is not
to prevent the introduction of that evidence against him
but to prevent the introduction of that evidence against a
third party, and we think at least though it doesn't
specifically hold that, at least the rationale of the
Alderman decision indicates that that can't be dona.
Q

By hypothesis it was his Fourth Amendment

right that was violated, the witness's, and by asserting
the right not to answer he is trying to—-through him the
sanction is being imposed against violation of his Fourth
Amendment rights.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The Fourth Amendment right has

already been violated, Mr. Justice.
Q

And will be continually, I suppose, if there

is no sanction against its operation.
IiR, FRIEDMAN:

There are sanctions.

For example,

only last term this Court in the Diwans case indicated that
there was a right of action for damages, and under this
1968 statute there is an express right of action for damages
given.

There are also criminal penalties for violation of

23
the law.

We don’t think that a witness in effect can refuse

to give pertinent evidence because he says. "Weil, this would
compound and continue the violation of the Fourth Amendment."
The right to be secure against unreasonable searches and
seizures.

The search and seizures have taken place by

definition long before.
Q.

That's, we think, going to—

That's true in the basic week situation or

map situation, the violation has taken place long before
the trial.
MR, 'FRIEDMAN:

Yes, but .if I may, Mr. Justice, I

think that illustrates the reason why we believe/the courts
have not permitted people like witnesses before a grand
jury to -raise these issues.

In the week situation, in the

map situation, all the cases involving the exclusionary
rule, the question was whether the evidence taken in viola­
tion of the Fourth Amendment rights was to be used against the
defendant.

And the theory, it seems to us, of these cases

is that the right given you by the Fourth Amendment to be
secure in your person and property against unreasonable
searches and seizures would be an empty thing if despite that
the evidence obtained through the search and seizure could he
used against you, could foe used against you.
where a witness is merely being asked

But in the case

questions, where he is

not a defendant in a case, the evidence is not being used
against him.

24
Q

The petitioner raises another point, which is

that, as I -'understand, that under no circumstances would he
have any business with a grand jury»
would he volunteer any testimony.

Under no circumstances

And'under no circumstances

would he give any information unless'forced to do so»
And, two, that there is no way that the government
would have known about it, that he was a witness, except by
this tap.

And, therefore, because the government get this

piece of information which is that he did know something,
if the government hadn’t had that information, they never
would have called him.

And he’s trying to find some way

to get around being a volunteer witness before the grand
jury.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
d

He's not a volunteer witness,

As I understand your position, is that before

the 1958 act there was no way he could question any way
that the government got the evidence; is that right?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Insofar as he was a witness before

the grand jury, that is correct.
Q

Regardless of how unlawful the action of the

prosecutor prior to-—
MR. FRIEDMAN:

With one exception, Mr. Justice',

with one exception, and that is the situation involved in
the Silverthorns case to which reference has been made, and
I'd like to discuss briefly the Silverthorne case, because we

25

think 'chat is

3

different c'ass.

But in the Si 1 verthorae

case , the Siivarthornes had been indicted and'after they
had been indicted and arrested, the government official,
t

without any authority at all, just came into their house and
made e. complete sweep of all their personal property.

They

took all their books and records and brought it in there.
And these people in turn went to the District Court and got
a court order directing the return of this property, the
court holding that the property had been illegally seised
from the government,
After that, a new grand jv.ry was convened which
was investigating other violations of the law by these same
individuals.

And what the new grand jury did was to issue

a subpoena for the identical books and records that had
previously been taken and had been ordered returned.
this Court in a landmark opinion refused to do so.

And
It

refused to do so, I think, not announcing any general
principle that whenever a witness is called before a grand
1

jury he.has the right to contest the way in which the grand
jury called him, but rather on the particular circumstances
of this case,

Silverthorne is a three-page opinion of ,

Justice Holme's written in its usual terse, tight style,

matter of this case.
contention as follows.

He explained the government’s
He said, "The government's contention

is that although,, of course, its seizure was an outrage
which the government new regrets, it may copy the papers,
use the knowledges obtained, and compel production.”
Again, 1 think the S1lverthorne case is the
unusual situation where you just had quite outrageous conduct,
where you had a search that had previously been judicially
determined to be illegal.

And then the government has

turned around and said, "Well, we don't have to pay any
attention to that.

We can undercut, that determination of

illegality by just pulling the records back before another
grand jury under a new subpoena.

And this Court very

properly refused to countenance that.
to us, is the antithesis of that.

This case, it seems

the surveillance was made pursuant to a court order.

that there was anything illegal about the surveillance.
They now claim the surveillance is illegal.

They now

But it seems to us that this is

a very different situation from what you had in Silverthorne«
SIlverthorne is, of course, relied on by both the
petitioners in this case and the respondents in the next,
case as announcing this broad rule.

We think Silverthorne

turns on its particular facts, that Silverthorne does not
announce this broad rule.
The rale has been ordinarily that & grand jury may

27
consider any evidence'it has , however it cams into the
grand jury *possession.

This Court repeatedly has

recognised that: a defendant in a criminal case cannot
challenge the indictment on the ground that improper
evidence was produced before the grand jury»

HR. FRIEDMAN;

I think so.

I have an argument

as to why—
Q

We're assuming that the provisions c£ the

statute were not complied with in authorizing the
interception.

That’s the assumption.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's the assumption of this

argument.
Q

Nevertheless, you say that the statute does

not permit or does not anticipate exclusion at the grand
jury.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
correct.

By a grand jury witness, that is

And I will say—I don't want to interrupt my

argument now—but in the next case I will make an argument
that in fact—in fact—«these allegations are not enough to
establish a violation of the statute, but we assume for
purposes of this; discussion that there has been a violation.
Q

That this was an illegal interception.

MR» FRIEDMAN:

We assume that for purposes of

29
discussion.
Q

And nevertheless you say Congress did not

provide for an exclusionary rule or a rule against the use
of the fruits of that tap.
MR. Friedman;

That is precisely so.

That's

precisely cur submission, Mr. Justice.
Now, when we start with Section 2515, which is
3et forth at page S of the petitioners' brief, this green
document, and it’s captioned:

Prohibition of Use of

Evidence as Evidence of Intercepted Wire or Oral Communica­
tions.

And it says whenever there has been any interception

of an oral or wire communication no part of the contents
of such communication and no evidence derived therefrom may
be received in evidence in any—and then there is a long
group of proceedings, emy trial, any hearing, before any'
grand jury, before any legislative committee ox* any
authority of the United States, efc cetera, at cetera, ifja
disclosure of that information would be in violation

of.this

chapter.
This statute provides the standard.

It contains

the basic prohibition upon the receipt in evidence of
material in violation of the statute.

However, however, it

dees not explain the procedures by which this right is to
be implemented.

And the procedures for implementing this

right, as contained in Section--

30

Q

If that's all you had, on its face it reads

right on this situation, doesn’t it?
MR* FRIEDMAN:
qualification.

It would seem to, with one

X would just like to make the qualification

but: not argue it at length at this point.»

What it

prohibits is the receipt in evidence of such material—
Q

Or any fruits*

MR» FRIEDMAN:

-—or any fruits, if the disclosure

of that information be in violation of this chapter, not
if the interception was in violation of this chapter but
if the disclosure would he in violation of this chapter,
and,I have this argument, which I‘11 make.

It takes a

little time as to why the disclosure would not be.

But it

starts with the prohibition.
However, 25X3, Subparagraph 10, which is contained
at page 20 of the petitioners’ brief, provides the
procedures for motions to suppress.

And the Senate committee

report on this statute—and this is the only pertinent
legislative history on this title because the House committee
report did not deal with the bill in its present form—s.&id
that the prohibitions of 2515, the prohibition upon the
receipt of the evidence, must of course be read in light of
Section 25X8(10} discussed below, which defines the class
entitled to make a motion to suppress.

That is, 2515

itself does not contain any operative provisions as to how

31
the right provided there is to be enforced.
provided by Section 2518(10)«,

That is

And the Senate committee

also said that Section 2518(10) later on when it came to
discuss that, must be read in connection with Section 2515
which it limits.

In other words, the right provided in

Section 2515 is limited by the standing provided in
Section 2518(10), and it also said that this latter section,
Subsection 10, provides the remedy for the right created
in Section 2515.

So that it seems to us that there is a

clear interrelationship between them.
Now, what is the provision of the remedy provided
in 2518(10)?

Well, there are two striking things about it.

The list of proceedings before which a motion to suppress
may foe made is the same as that in 2515, with two striking
exceptions.

There is no provision made in, that for a grand

jury proceeding, and there is no provision for that before
a legislative committee.

And the legislative history we

think shows quite clearly that this emission was not
inadvertent, that in fact Congress intentionally decided
not to permit the making of these motions to suppress in
connection with either a grand jury proceeding or legislative
proceeding„
Q

Are you saying that both with respect to a—

neither at the behest of a witness nor of a person who is
being investigated?

32
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would say that is so,

Mr. Justice, because it seems to us it's sometimes very
difficult to drew the line between someone who is a witness
and someone whc is being—
Q

Sometimes it's easy, though.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Sometimes it's easy.

And even when it's easy, the putative

defendant himself could not either then or later claim that
indictment was

*gal because it rested on an illegal

interception.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct.

He could, of

course, object to the introduction of any evidence at the
trial against him based on an illegal interception.
Q

Right.

But he couldn't challenge his

indictment on it.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's correct, Mr. Justice.

The Senate committee in describing the subsection
stated as follows:

"Because no person is a party as such

to a grand jury proceeding, the provision does not envision
the making of a motion to suppress in the context of such
a proceeding itself.

Normally there .is no limitation on

the character of evidence that may be presented to a grand
jury which is enforceable by an individual, citing Blue
against United States.
■oral rule

There is no intention to change this

the intention of the provision only that

33
when a motion to suppress is granted in another context” —
and that we think is an articulation of the basic principle
that I've discussed announced in Si 1 verfchorne—11 when a motion
to suppress is granted in another context, it still may
include use in a future grand jury proceeding.

Where is

there any intention to grant jurisdiction to federal courts
over the Congress itself?"
Of course, if the petitioners are correct that
this provision permits a witness before a grand jury to
challenge the evidence, then by the same token & witness
before a congressional committee could object to answering
questions put before the committee because he said the
committee called me as a result of evidence obtained through
an illegal wiretap.
The contempt proceeding is, we think, sc closely
connected with the grand jury proceeding that it can fairly
be said to raise the issue, in the language of the committee,
in the context of a grand jury proceeding.

The only way a

witness can be compelled to testify before a grand jury is
to hold him in civil contempt* to get the court to tell the
witness, as the witness was told in this case, that they
must stand committed for the life of the grand jury until
they answer the questions.
Q

It's interesting you don’t cite any of the

Fourth Amendment, cases dealing with a grand jury in your brief.

34
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Justice, we do, I believe, but

they're cited in the brief in the Egan case.
Q

Oh, 'I see.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The Egan case was the case in which

we do cite the grand jury cases and discuss them at pages
14 to 15 of our Egan brief;^we cite a number of Court of
Appeals cases which have declined to permit this type of
motion to be made before a grand jury

Our brief in this

case, because of the fact that in this case—
Q

In the other brief do you deal with the

(Dinotia?) case of the Seventh Circuit?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, I'm afraid not, we don't.

Now, I'd also like to turn to another provision of
the statute which reflects the same intention on the part of
Congress, and that is Subsection 9 in the middle of page 20,
which says, "The contents of any intercepted wire
communication shall not be received in evidence or otherwise
disclosed in a trial hearing or other proceeding unless each
party is given ten days notice thereof."
Two things about the language.

It speaks of trial

hearing or the proceeding, and it speaks of a party.
Ordinarily a witness is not viewed as a party before the
grand jury.

The word "party" as we use it in our lav; means

party to a trial.

Once again the legislative history, the

Senate report, confirms that view, because in speaking of

35
paragraph 9 whst the Senate .committee says is, "Proceeding
is intended to include all adversary type hearings.

It

would include a trial itself, a probation revocation
proceeding, or a hearing on a motion for reduction of
sentence.

It would not include a grand jury hearing,"

citing again Blue against United States.
So, once again if seems to us that the legislative
history of this provision is as clear as can be that Congress.
did not intend by these words to give any rights to a
witness before a grand jury.

The suggestion has been made

both in this case and in the following case that this
statute is so clear on its face that no resort need be had

t.c the legislative history.

It’s clear on its face, they

say, because they look to the definition of aggrieved party
and they say the people who have been overheard come under
the definition of aggrieved party; therefore, that's the
end of the matter.

This is a very complicated statute.

The

text of this title alone occupies 23 or 24 printed pages in
the brief.
its face.

It is a statute that is certainly not clear on
It’s difficult to know what these things mean, and

I think it’s essential in this case to have resort to the
legislative iistory to ascertain precisely what Congress
was seeking to do, precisely what rights Congress was giving
to these people<•-^whether Congress was intending for the first
time to give witnesses before the grand jury the right to

36
challenge the introduction of evidence before ituj
As I have indicated, Congress did not leave
witnesses in this situation without a remedy»
an unusual thing.

Congress provided,

It provided a specific suit for damages

in Section 2520 of the statute.

And this provision would

permit a witness if he has in fact been injured by an
illegal surveillance to recover damages.

Indeed, it’s a

rather unusual provision because it permits

putative

damages, not only actual damages and attorneys’ fees but
putative damage.
With this as far as the 1368 act is concerned,
I’d like to turn to another provision which is a provision
of the second statute, the 1970 statute„

The claim has

been made that even if the 13SB statute perhaps did not
give these witnesses any right, nevertheless the 1970
statute did.

And that is a provision, Section 3504, and

that provision was & reaction to this-—Congressional
reaction- —to this Court’s decision in the Alderman case.
Congress was concerned as a result of the Alderman decision
there would be an enormous increase in the number of hearings
required in court to litigate all of these claims of
illegal electronic surveillance.

Congress attempted to

reduce the number of those hearings.

What Congress did in

this section—-and it can be found on page—the end of our
brief in this case—I'm sorry-—

37

Q

It's not in the .grean brief.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Mr. Justice.

No,, it'.s not in the green brief ,

It is in the government's brief in the next

case.
Q

In Egan.,

MR. FRIEDMAN:

In Egan at pages 33 and 34.

And

this provision contains three subsections» and I'd like,
in order to explain, first to discuss the last two and. then
come to the first one,, because the only one we're relying
oa is the first one.
The last two provisions said as follows:

With

respect to any electronic surveillance taking place before
June 19, 1968—and that was the effective date of Title 3
of the 1968 act*—there shall not be required any hearing
with respect to the validity of that surveillance unless
the information brought to bear may be relevant to the
claim of inadmissibility of the evidence.

That was a

congressional concern that people who made all sorts of
allegations, but there may have been some kind of a taint
and that as a result of that taint the evidence would be
rendered inadmissible.
Then, they went on beyond that and said that in any
event, if there was electronic surveillance before the June,
1968 data and the surveillance occurred more than five years
prior to the conduct that is at issue in the case, there was

38
to ba no consideration.

In other words,, any possible taint

of an electronic surveillance that occurred more than five
years before the time at which the evidence of violation is
involved, that was too attenuated.

That was the basic

purpose of the statute.
Then what it said was that in any trial., hearing,
or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury,
et cetera, et cetera* this language does include the word
"grand jury,"does not include the word "legislative
committee."
And it says, "Upon a claim by a party aggrieved
that evidence is inadmissible because it is the primary
product of an unlawful act"--and unlawful act is defined in
the statute to mean electronic surveillance—"the government
shall affirm or deny that allegation*."
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Friedman.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Tigar?
REBUTTAL BY MR. TIGAR
MR. TIGAR:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, just a few

V7crds of rebuttal, if I may, about the proper meaning to be.
ascribed to these statutory terms to which Mr. Friedman
referred.
The government’s position seams to be that only
if the legislative history is ambiguous need we read the
statute here.

I invite the Court's attention first to

39
Section 2515 of the statute, which is at page 3 of the
appendix of our brief.

That section forbids receiving in

evidence in any trial, hearing or other proceeding in or
before any grand jury certain evidence if disclosure would
be in violation of this chapter.
A part of this chapter, to which that statute
refers, is surely Section 2511 which makes it a criminal
offense to disclose information obtained in violation of
the Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, particularly
Section 2511, Subdivision 1(c), reprinted at page 5 of the
appendix of our brief.

So, there is in 2515 not just a

right but a remedy.
The legislative history, if the Court please, does
say that Section 25.18, Subdivision 10 of the statute, which
has to do with notice and hearing, is not intended to apply
to a grand jury proceeding.

this kind of a case.

White, hecav.se the person who is indicted, that is, who is
loade a defendant, who has never been called before the grand

This conclusion, Mr. Justice White, if the Court

please, that we com© to, rests not just on Silverthorne,
which is a little different from this case, but on Wise v„
Henkle in 220 U. S«, and there this Court said in no
uncertain terms that the district judge has the power to

control the illegal conduct of its officers in the
execution of its process»

The rule of Wise v. Hankie has

not been disturbed by any subsequent decision and nothing
in this statute; or in the legislative history evinces any
congressional intention to disturb it in cases arising under
the 1968 act»

And so Mr. Parnas and Mr» Gelbard tire in no

different a. position before the grand jury than any other
witness who resists the compulsion to testify by invoking

but privacy»
