ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. COFFEY, ESQ»»
ON BEHALF OF THE■PETITIONER
MR. COFFEY:

Mr. Chief Justice,, and may it please

the Court?
This matter is before the Court on a writ of cer­
tiorari» United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit.
The pertinent facts under which this matter arose
are as follows;
On October 1» 1969» the Assembly» one of two Houses
of the State of Wisconsin legislature, passed a resolution
reciting that two days earlier, on September 29, 1969» the
Petitioner led a gathering of people which by its presence
on the floor of the Assembly, during a. meeting, prevented
the Assembly from conducting its business.

The resolution

found that the Petitioner’s conduct constituted disorderly
conduct in the immediate view of the House, and directly tend­
ing to interrupt its proceedings»

The resolution-then cited

the Petitioner for contempt and ordered that he foe imprisoned
in the Dane County jail for a period of six months or for the
balance of the legislative session, whichever was briefer.

4
The Petitioner was given no notice cf the charge
against him and was given no hearing of any kind, either
before the resolution was passed or after the resolution was

passed .
Q

Was the Petitioner taken into custody in the House

itself, where the disorder was —
MR. COFFEYj

No, your Honor, Chief Justice,the

disturbance had occurred two days previously.
Q

What 1 was asking, was there any effort to take

him into custody at the'time he was on the floor?

m.

COFFEYi

None at all.

Hone at all.

At the

time the resolution’ was passed,the Petitioner was in fact
incarcerated in the Dana County jail on a disorderly conduct
charge which had been placed against him, arising out of the
same conduct dealt with in the legislative resolution.
The Petitioner was served with a copy of the resolution and
he was then confined in the Dane County jail pursuant to the
authority of the resolution,

After he was served with a

copy of the resolution he instituted various legal action
contesting the constitutionality of the procedures employed
by the legislature in imprisoning him for six months.
Writs of habeas corpus were denied by the circuit court of
Dane County, and by the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

A petition

for writ of habeas corpus was filed in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin,

A response was filed* and the District Court thereupon releasee
«

the Petitioner on bail*, pending determination of the writ
of habeas corpus.

Bail had been denied to the- Petitioner

by both the Circuit Court of Bane County and by the Wisconsin
Supreme Court.
All of the petitions for habeas corpus filed by
the Petitioner alleged that he had been denied due process
of law in that lie had been denied the right to be represented
by counsel, the right to a trial or a hearing of any kind.
the right to compulsory process, the right to be informed
of the nature and cause of the- accusation against him, the
right to confront his accusers, and the right.to present
his defense to the alleged charges.
On April 8, 1970, the District Court held that the
Legislative Assembly could not summarily impose a jail
sentence for legislative contempt without providing-—without
first providing the Petitioner some minimal opportunity
to appear and respond to the charge,

The Court granted the

writ and ordered the Petitioner released from any further
restraint or custody, pursuant to the resolution.
The Respondent appealed the decision of the Dis­
trict Court* the Seventh''Circuit Court of Appeals, and on
appeal the judgment of the District Court was reversed„
Subsequently the Court of Appeals granted the Petitioner's
request for a rehearing en {janc , and in a four to three

6
decision, affirmed the earlier decision of the Court of
Appeals„
The issues presented on appeal are whether a legis­
lative body can consistent with due process of law, two clays
after alleged contemptuous conduct, ex parte imprison a parson
under its contempt power without giving the person any notice
of the charge against him, or any opportunity whatsoever to
appear before the legislative body and respond to the charges.
The second issue is whether consistent with the
due process clause a person can be found in contempt of a
legislative body when the contempt resolution sets forth mere
conclusions and fails to sot forth any cf the underlying
facts and circumstances which constituted the alleged contempt­
uous behavior.
Petitioner respectfully contends that the Wisconsin
legislature did not have the power to summarily punish for
contempt»
Q

Back to your second point, I notice in the opinion,

the per curiam opinion of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin,
beginning on X09-A of the appendix and the attachment which
begins on 113-A of the appendix, the Supreme Court seems to,
in reciting the facts, foe reciting a fairly detailed statement
of facts.

Where did that coma from?
HR, COFFEY:

Your Honor, that was one of the problems

that was confronted in the matter, in that no record of those

proceedings was made.
Q

1 just wondered where this statement of facts came,

from?
MR. COPP<e.¥:

That was judicial notice taken of

accounts in the mass media, newspaper and television accounts
of what had occurred,
Q

Is that indicated anywhere, that that is the source

of it?
MR, COFFEYs

That is indicated in the opinion-, your

Honor, of the District Court, in that—the actual language
of the District Court I don’t know, but that there had been
no hearing of any kind, anti it was indicated that that was
judicial notice of those facts from these media’ sources,
Q

They do say, 51 We take judicial notice,” and then they

go on with a fairly detailed statement of what happened in the
State Legislature.
MR. COFFEYi

That was the only available source

of those facts and material at that time, because- there had been
no evidentiary hearing, either in a court or a legislative
body; no record made of the proceeding by the legislature,
the only source was the media.
Q

Was there any substantial claim that the Petitioner

did not know with what he was being charged or that these
facto are inaccurate in any way?
MR. COFFEY;

X

don’t believe, Justice, that there is

aily contention that the Petitioner was not, in fact, on the
floor of the Assembly. X think there may he some contention
as to whether or not

the Petitioner personally engaged in

conduct that was disorderly
Q

Of course your point is, I suppose, he was not
/
given any opportunity to make any such contention?
MR. COFFEYs

He was never given such an opportunity

to respond in any way to the charge,,
Q

Bo citizens have the privilege of the floor of the

legislative houses of the Wisconsin legislature?
MR. COFFEYt

In fact during the session, Chief

Justice, it was the presence of the people on the floor of the
Assembly which was in violation of a ruled? the Assembly.
Q

It probably warrants a charge of contempt indepen­

dent of whether it was in fact disorderly, X suppose»

I said

warrants a charge, not a conviction.
MR. COFFEYt

Yes,,

Well, it was in violation of a

rule and they could probably proceed on some basis, but
as we“ve-.; indicated here, we have proceeded throughout these
proceedings? that the legislature of the State of Wisconsin,
like all legislatures, has a contempt power.

The question

is what is the scope of that contempt power and what
procedures must they follow in exercising the contempt power?
Q

I suppose the disorderly conduct charge has neve?

been pursued, is that correct?

MR. COFFEY s No, Chief Justice, as a matter of fact,
the day prior to the passing of this rssoluiion by the Assembly
the Petitioner had in fact been charged, with disorderly
conduct? he in fact after the resolution war issued, had a
jury trial on that charge of disorderly conduct, and after the
jury had deliberated and was unable to return a verdict,
the trial court granted the defendant's motion for dismissal
or judgment of acquittal, which they had taken under advise­
ment at conclusion of all of the case.

He in fact success­

fully defended the criminal disorderly conduct charge.
Now, in regard to the summary contempt powers, courts
have clearly exercised summary contempt powers.

However, the

decisions of this Court have always limited the exercise of
that power to the vary situations where the misconduct is
actually observed by the court, and where immediate punish­
ment was necessary to restore order, and to maintain the
dignity and authority of the court.

Because of the dangers

inherent in the summary contempt power, which has been
described as perhaps nearest akin to despotic power of any
power existing under our form Of government, this Court has
construed it as an exception to the normal requirements of
due process, and has refused to extend it, particularly in
Johnson vs. Mississippi,Mayberry vs. Pennsylvania.
This summary power has never before in the history
of this country, prior to October 1

1969f ever been exercised

10
by a legislative body*

Good reason exist:

that power to the legislature.

for not extending

First, and I think foremost.

courts differ significantly from legislatures. I-i
duty and the business of courts to determine and decide
particular cases free from the exercise of external influence.
As Judge Stevens noted in his dissenting opinion on the

a

banc hearing,"without reflecting adversely on the importance
and dignity of the legislative function, it must be recognised
that legislators are more responsive to the temporary moods
of the body politic than are judges.”
And further in this case, in v
•this Court held that a judge who "was so enmeshed in matters
involving" a defendant "as to make it appropriate for another
judge to sit," and determine the question of his contempt,
and indicate, noting that trial before an unbiased judge
was essential to due process.

In this case, given the

responsiveness of the legislatures to pressures or the par­
ticular political.-stood ’ at the time, and also I don't think
you can view the Wisconsin Asembly at this point as an unbiased
judge.
Q

That argument seems to be going to the proposition

that there.couldn't have been any finding of contempt because
certainly trial by a biased judge is deprivation of due pro­
cess of law, isl and of itself, is • it not?
MR. COFFEYs

Yes. it is, Justice.

J.l

Q

Yesf but you’re not -making that argument, are you?
MR. COFFEYs I ha saying that there must he a. hearing

and I would suggest, that it not be before the legislature,,
0

It couldn’t be before a different legislature very

well, could it?
MR. COFFEY; As in the federal system, Justice
Stewart, matters are referred to the United States Attorney
for prosecution in the judicial process, where the full
panoply of procedural due process rights are observed.
Q

1 didn’t understand that your argument went that

far, at least from reading your brief?

X thought that your

argument was confined to the proposition there had to be
notice and opportunity to respond* and secondly, that the
charges couldn’t be conclusive but that you were not question­
ing the basic right of the legislature to find your client
in contempt. ' This legislature under these circumstances.
MR. COFFEY;

Well, I think that at this juncture

I would say that notice and hearing, even before that legis­
lature, is minimal, but I would think that there is some
consideration to the idea that it should not be before the
Assembly and that other procedures could be available.

0

By being available, you mean by that that con­

stitutionally the State of Wisconsin has to adopt some kind
of, part of federal reference —*
MR. COFFEY: X think, Justice, if it’s been the

position of the respondent that they cannot afford, the peti­
tioner due process, because that world over-’bur dc-n the logi::-lative system and may draw the legislature t:>

a halt, unci I

feel that if the legislature I3 unable to afford due process,
then, yes, X would think that congtitutionally they are .
mandated to adopt some other procedure, whereby due process
will be afforded.
Q

Hay X ask, Mr. Coffey, I think you answered Mr.

Justice Stewart that the facts cited in the Supreme Court
per curiam, page 113-A, you thought were obtained from news
media?
MR. COFFEY: Yes.
Q

I notice on page 61, a proceeding.apparently brought

by the State against Groppi and others, a statement or* rage
62-A that the complaint and affidavit attached to this cane
in substance cites most of the facts stated, the balance
having been supplied by testimony, and what precedes that
on pages 6i~A and 62-A seems to be substantially like that
which appears in the per curi-?m of the Supreme Court at 113-A.
Am I wrong?
MR. COFFEY:

Justice Brennan, to answer your question,

the pages to which you refer are the findings of a circuit
judge, Dans County, who had conducted a hearing or. the
respondent’s motion for temporary restraining order, and then
there was a hearing on tbs preliminary-.

This record, with

this testimony# to my knowledge was not available to f h a
Wisconsin Supreme Court at the time it rendered its decision»
Q

Ohj. 1 see.
MR. COFFEYs

Q

That happened after the decision?
Yes.

There was a deferred plea.

This decision states October 17» 1969.
MR. COFFEYt

Correct» and X believe the action

of the Wisconsin Supreme Court was —
Q

Hearing was October 6.
MR. COFFEYs Yes» and I believe the action of the

Wisconsin Supreme Court in denying—
0

Do we have the hearing of October S?
MR. COFFEY; X do not know? they are not part

of the record» Justice Brennans

the action

of the Supreme

Court in denying the Petitioner the writ of habeas corpus
was October 10.
Q

October 10?
MR. COFFEY: Yes.

Q

Mr. Coffey» in this connection» X think you con­

ceded that there's no issue of fact about Father Groppi being
on the Assembly floor on the day in question?

The Wisconsin

Supreme Court stated that the occupation of the Assembly
by Groppi and the protesters lasted from approximately mid­
day to well toward midnight.

Do you go so far as to concede

that fact?

MR. COFFEY: Yes» I would concede that fact in that

'I know it occurred. Justice Blackman, but it was never estab­
lished in any proceeding that 15m aware of, in the Wisconsin
Supreme Court being aware that there was sworn testi
it was obviously reported in the media»
Wow, in this particular action, the people let
into the Assembly or the people present in the Assembly were
in fact there to object to, or make known their objection
in regard to legislative action in terms of cutting back wel­
fare payments.
0

You don’t contend that they had any right to do that,

of course?
MR. COFFEY: No, X do not, Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

It isn't necessary to your case?
MR. COFFEY* No, it is not, and I only bring that up

because I believe it raises some question as to the ability
of the legislature to sit as a fair and impartial judge
of the contempt.
Secondly, in terms of legislative contempt, the
physical contours of most legislative chambers, along with the
comings and goings of people in the legislature during
the sessions, the absence of transcribed records make it
reasonable, as the District Court found, and as Judge SfcevenS
noted in his dissenting opinion, that there is the room for
error in perception and evaluation of the alleged contemptuous
conduct which is far greater in a legislative body than in a

court, the restricted area in which a court may make a summary
contempt finding*
Additionally, a review of the action raken by th.•
legislature is almost impossible, is extremely difficult if
not almost impossible.
Q

In the instance case—

No review is provided of legislative determinations

of that kind, is there?
MR. COFFEY:

There was none in this case, Chief

Justice Burger, and that is one of the problems, that when
the Petitioner filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus
in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, there was authority here,
there were cases prior to that time in Wisconsin which indicate-*
that in fact the court would not review a finding of the legis­
lature .
Q

Well, to take just that part of your argument about

the contours of the room and the other factors about the
functioning of the legislative body, then it wouldn't have been
feasible on your theory to have

Justice h-v:;: 1 wh-ss

fox* impeachment by the Senate 180 years ago or 170 years
ago, or to have tried President Johnson for impeachment
a hundred year’s ago.
MR. COFFEY: The trial for impeachment, I don’t see
any difficulty.
Q

The contours of the room are the same, are they not?
MR. COFFEY: But the people were there taking part and

they were having a trial, but the suggestion is that the
contours of the legislative body make it difficult to
have uniform perception and evaluation of conduct that is
going on in that large an area.
Q

You are speaking new of members of the legislative»

body, in a sense, as the witnesses who observed the event,
not of the trial of the man for contempt before the body?
MR. COFFEY; That is correct.
Q

I misunderstood your posture.

Would you make the

same arguments with reference to the unfeasibility of
conducting a trial before the body?
MR, COFFEY; Ho, X would not? X clearly believe
a trial could be conducted.

X'd hate to see that forced

onto the legislative machinery, in that obviously it would
cause great disruption of the normal legislative process
and if they would have a full-blown trial, but clearly X think
the chamber would be a sufficient place to have it done,
Q

From your argument X take it the only remedies

the State of Wisconsin has against someone occupying the
legislature for ten to twelve hours is to make a charge of
disorderly conduct, as there was here?
MR. COFFEY;

Yes, they could bring charges under the

ordinary criminal cMe, unlawful assembly sad other sorts
of criminal offenses? but additionally, I believe that they
could certify one, as the Federal Government does to the O.S.

•i 7

Attorney for contempt, or they could in fact have
they could in fact have had a hearing.

c.

hearing—»-

All the District

Court said was constitutionally mandated vra-,3 a. minimal o;opov>ttmity to appear and respond,, and ell the cases cited in the
Respondent's brief of legislative contempt, that is in fact the
procedure that was followed.

The contemnor was just brought

in before the bar of the House or Senate, and advised that
the legislative body viewed certain of his conduct as
contemptuous , what if anything did he have to cay as to
why he should not be held in contempt, and that’s whet the
District Court said was constitutionally mandated.

The

District Court did not conceive of a full-blown trial.
I feel that the Petitioner is entitled to that, at
a minimumand he may well be entitled to more procedural due
process than just that minimal due process.
Q

Mr. Coffey, before you sit down or conclude your

argument, will you work in, for my benefit, your comments as
to the suggestion of mootness of the case?
MR. COFFEE: Yes.
Q

Somewhere along the line?
MR. COFFEY?

In terms of mootness, the Resolution

in addition to holding the Petitioner in contempt, there was
also a second part of the Resolution which pursuant to Section
13*2? of the Statutes of tine State of Wisconsin, referred
the matter to the District Attorney of Dane County.

Section

13«27 of the Statutes of the State of Wisconsin, subparagraph
2, provides that “any p arson who is adjudged guilty” —
I’m sorry, this is on page 24-A of the Petition for Writ,
I’m sorry, it is not in the appendix.

The statute provides

that “any person who is adjudged guilty of any contempt of the
legislature or either house thereof, shall be deemed guilty
also of a misdemenaor, and after the adjournment of such
legislature, may be prosecuted therefor in Dane County and
may be fined not more than $200 or imprisoned not more than
one year in the county jail."
The legislature assembly that held the Petitioner
in contempt adjourned sine die on either January 6 or January
7, 1971,

The prosecution contemplated by the Resolution of

the Assembly has not been, to this date, commenced, but there
is the threat of this prosecution.
I would indicate that I think in terms of collateral
estoppel or double jeopardy, there may be some defenses to
that prosecution, but there is the threat of that, prosecution
which X believe would bring this matter under the doctrine
of this Court in Sidburn v. New York and Calrfriss v. X»e Valle,
(phonetic), and X do not wish to suggest that this matter
is not moot.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Mr. Tinglum.

Thank you, Mr. Coffey.

QRflL ARGUMENT OP SPERET? O.

ESQ,

ON BEHALF* OP THE RESPONDENT
MR. T1NGLUM:

Mr. Chief Justice,, may it please

the Court, my name is Sverre Tinglum, Assistant Attorney
General from Wisconsin, representing the Respondent here today.
Respondent sees the issue before this Court as an
extremely narrow issue, and that issue is whether the legisla­
tive body, that is state legislature, house of the state
legislature or Congress of the United States, or any such
legislative body may exercise its contempt power in a summary
fashion;

that is, in the same manner as courts exercise, their

contempt powers where there has been contumacious conduct
in the immediate presence of the court, tending to obstruct
the court's proceedings.
The question is whether the legislature in the case
of & direct contempt as contrasted with a constructive
contempt, whether it may in the words of the Terry case
cited in our brief, proceed upon its own knowledge of the facts
and punish the offender without further proof and without issue
or trial in any form.
The District Judge who' first considered these issues
acknowledged that the conduct described in the Assembly's
if it
Rasolution/had been committed in open court would justify
summary contempt procedure in court, and then the District
Judge said. "Now we have to look to see if tha legislature has

20

the same power to proceed summarily as any court would.
The District Judge held that the legislature ’ did not have
such power.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit

held that it did, reversing the District Judge.
Q

What*s the problem?

How do you answer my problem,

which is were the same people there the -second day as were
there the day that it happened?
Mfe. ^JINGLUM:
Q

I’m not sure that I understand—

You don*t know do you?

You talk about the body.

MR. TINGLUM: Oh, Z'm sorry? S understand your
question now, Mr. Justice. Marshall.

Q

With a judge, there's one judge, but in this

legislature, how many were there?

How many house members

are there?
MR. TINGLUM? There are a hundred.
Q

Well, do I assui

-s no di?

'from oth<

legislatures, you never have a hundred in two days in a row?
MR. TINGLUMs

There is a presumption of regularity

of the legislative proceedings.
Q

That all on® hundred are there?
MR. TINGLUM? That there were a sufficient number

'

there and that all those who voted, witnessed the contumacious
conduct.
Q

How many were there?
MR. TINGLUM: This is a presumption that

** »!
f- X

has been acknowledged by this Court.
Q

How many were there the day the act occurred?
MR, TINGLUM? X have no idea,

<3

Shouldn't we know?
MR. TINGLUMs If the question had been raised as

a factual question in this habeas corpus* proceeding—-the
District Court made the assumption that was a question of
fact, and he decided that question of fact against the Respond­
ent and it s part of cur appeal to the Seventh Circuit.
We pointedout to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals—
Q

I assume that someone that second day only knew

it happened by hearsay, in that they were not present on the
day it happened, but they did vote?
MR. TINGLUMs I don't think that presumption could
be made.

That would be presuming an irregularity in legis­

lative procedure.
Q

Well, do you consider that regularity means there

are a hundred people there every day?
MR. TINGLUM?
Q

No.

You don't assume that?
MR. TINGLUM: No.

Q

Please don't ask me to assume it*
MR. TINGLUM: All X am saying is that there is a

presumption of regularity of legislative proceedings.
Q

Well, that's not what is before me now, is the

regularity of thst I&gislacio'e proceeding» it*s the regularity
of a contempt asfcioa wMah pats a iuim iu jail.

acknowledged by this court as a presumption of the regularity
of proceedings which would include—

Q

No. Ghat is act what -Mr. Marshall says? presumption

of regularity oartainly doesn’t eabraee the presumption that
every oingla

{fhnfc has nothing to do with the

presumption of regularity.
What is a quorum in Wisconsin?
MR. T1MGL0M* A majority.
0

So 51 could have been there one day and 51 the

next day# and this means of the two days # it would only
possibly have been one person who was there both days.
MR. TINGIiUM: That is possible.
This# as we pointed out to the Court of Appeals#
was not a non-issue of fact? that the District Court assumed
to determine without giving the State an opportunity to
prove in an evidentiary hearing that in fact the legislators
who did vote for the contempt Resolution were# in fact#
present on the day that the contempt took place? were# in
fact# those who voted for the contempt Resolution.
Q

Well# I thought the whole point of the Petitioner’s

second proposition was that until there was a detailed
statement of what the alleged contempt consisted of# people
voting on the contempt would not have known what it was.
The indication of that is that they weren't there, and didn't
see it with their own eyes two days earlier.
MR. TlHGLUMs I don’t understand that to ba Petition­
er’s argument.
Q

That may be what he is driving at,

That is the implication of his argument.
MR, TINGLUM?

I interpret Petitioner’s argument

to be that the Resolution failed to state sufficient probable

24

cause, as this Court has interpreted probable cause, and this
appears in Judge Kiley's dissent in the Court of Appeals.
Q

"It sets forth mere conclusions and fails to

set forth any underlying facts and circumstances which con­
stituted the alleged contemptuous behavior." How I had assumed
that the implication of that whole argument is there work­
people who voted on this who didn’t sea this with their

own eyas? otherwise, the argument doesn't amount to anything.
X thought that point did raise a factual issue.
MR. TINGLUMs
Petitioner's argument.

X.had never understood that to be
There was no such allegation in the

original petition in the District Court.

This sort of reci­

tation of fact as to who voted, and who saw has never appeared,to my knowledge, in any resolution of contempt passed fey any
legislative body at any time, and it has never been required
by any court at any time.
This 1 see as a non-issue. X take it to be conceded,
X believe to foe conceded by the Petitioner, that a legislative
as
foody such/a house of the State Legislature has the power to
punish? it is a house having authority to commit for contempt.
Example precedent for that is in casas cited in both briefs.
I take it to be a non-issue that there have been very grave
and serious abuses of the parliamentary powers of contempt in
the past.

The amicus brief dwells at acme length on this, and

1 am certain if there had been a search made, even more

25
in
the briefs. However, 1 do not see that as an issue in this
case, because what has happened in the pact, this Court ho:::
said that simple abusas of a power are not reason, for denying
its existence.
Another thing that is conceded and is not at issue
in this case is that the contempt power, particularly this
summary contempt power, is an extremely delicate power to be
used sparingly as this Court has said, and is to be exer­
cised with the greatest sense of responsibility.

This is

conceded«,
There is another non-issue in this ease, and that
is the constitutionality of Wisconsin * s legislative contempt
statute, that is the statute which was referred to by counsel,
Section 13.26.

The issue of the constitutionality of that

statute was litigated in a companion ease to this one, the
Proalich case, and there a three-judge District Court ruled
that the statute was constitutional, that it was not vague,
over-broad, that it.did not call for involuntary servitude,
and other issues.

There was no appeal from that decision by

the three-judge District Court.
This case here, incidentally, is a spin-off from
that case.

This case started as a Federal Civil Rights

action for declaratory judgment, and then when the Federal
District Judge ruled that the portion of that action, the

26
request for injunction actually was a request feu habeas
corpus relief

„

t.hen this case# Groppi y« Leslie became a spin

off of Groppi v. Froelich, and proceeded as a habeas case.
Also conceded, and 1 state to be a non-issue in
this case# that a legislative body has other courses it. ray
follow in event of a direct disorderly contempt of its
proceedings. It may refer the matter to the courts.

In the

Watkins case? this Court observed that Congress has rarely
exercised its contempt powers but had preferred, at that time
to refer matters of contempt to the United States Attorney
for prosecution.
Q

There's no issue about this.

Does the legislative body of Wisconsin have a

statute expressly authorising this-MR. TINGLUM:
Q

Yes, it has,

That’s not this 13.27?
MR. TXNGlUMs Yes, that’s what I am referring to.

Q

Well, I thought this applied only to the case

of one actually adjudged guilty by the house?
MR. TINGLUMs Yes# I’m sorry# Mr. Justice Brennan#
what I was thinking of was the disorderly conduct statute.
Yes# disorderly conduct occurring anywhere within the State
may be prosecuted# and the Assembly could have treated this
simply as a case of disorderly conduct­

ed

Under the general statute?
MR. TINGLUMs

Yes# under the general statute.

0

That statute is express, isn't it,, authorises

reference expressly in the cases of contempt found by the
house?
MR. TINGLOM:

Wisconsin has no parallel to that

statute.
Q

Was he in jail for disorderly conduct at this time

or about the same business?
MR. TINGLUM: No.

That arrest was made, as I

remember, made at a later time,
Q

For conduct occurring where?
MR. TINGLUMs

Q

On the Assembly's floor.

The same conduct?
MR. TXNGLUM: Yes, the same conduct,

Q

Your response, I think, was a little confusing.

To be sure that we have it clear, he was at the time of the
contempt citation, he was in custody on a disorderly conduct
charge for the same conduct that the legislature was dealing
with?
MR. TINGLUM: Exactly the same.
Q

That case ended in a mistrial and was followed by

dismissal?
MR. TINGLOMi

That's correct.

I’m sorry-—! didn’t intend to mislead—it was
exactly the same conduct as was tried in the disorderly
conduct case, under the statute

28
Q

He was just under a charge, and he hadn’t been

convicted?
MR. TINGLUM: That’s correct
of disorderly conduct in the court,

He •• ;as never convicted
As Mr* Chief Justice

Burger pointed out, there never was—there was a mistrial
and never any new trial.
Q

He has a charge still hanging over him, though, has

he not?
MR. TINGLUMs

Conceivably there could be a charge

under Section 13.27 of the statutes.
0

There was a. mistrial.

But were the charges dismissed?
MR,, TINGLUMs Yes, it was dismissed,

Q

Well, 13 *3? requires a prior resolution convicting

of contempt?
MR. TXNGLUMj Yen*
Q

So this case isn’t moot?
MR. TINGLUMs The State has never contended that it

is moot.

I would feel that as long as the possibility exists

that someone could prefer charges under Section 13.27, 1
would feel that’/ under Carabis a v. Le Valle {phonetic),
.—^ivtMSiordniMtrj^snsaUauTM

uus

«b''tm*s»A9inivctMU'

that there was sufficient interest left here in the Peti­
tioner and sufficient hazardQ

olved, at least theoretical!

Xs there a statute of limitations applicable to

1^.27?
MR, TINGLUMs X know of none.

■29
Q

But certainly wouldn't

there be almost insurmount­

able double jeopardy problems?
HSU TINGLUM:

Oh# absolutelyr yes,

That is my

opinion? it is not in issue here# but that would foe rayopinion .
Q

Well# if that's so, why isn't it moot?
If wfe sustain this Resolutionr as you want ns to do,

and if there was a problem of double jeopardy# nothing else
could happen anyway.
HR. TINGLUM: That’s correct.
Q. ■ ' So it doe© make it a little bit or? a sort of empty
argument# doesn’t it?
MR. TINGLUM: As X understand Carabiss v. La Valle
(phonetic), and the principles in that case, if there is
a theoretical possibility that a previous judgment# if allowed
to stand# could work to someone’s disadvantage in the future,
then the issue is not
Q

moot.

Well# there would foe no disadvantage# if ha couldn’t

foe tried.
MR. TINGLUM:

But that issue is not before the Court

at this time# and all X can say is that in my personal
opinion# yes# there would be—*
Q

You could argue mootness on that ground.
MR. TINGLUM: I don’t believe under the cases that

have been cited by this Court# that I can.

I am not urging

.

that.
Q

In other wordsf you are

not arguing racotness?

MR. TXNGLOM: X am not.
Q

This is why I raised the question with Mr. Coffey

a little while ago. I want to be sure about your position.
You are not arguing mootness.
MR. TIMGi-UMs That is correct.
It is also a. non-issue in this case that the Assembly
could have taken different courses of action,» as Congress
has the pwer to take different courses of action when in
contempt cases.

The question before this Court is whether

the Constitution requires that a legislative body must take
some different course of action? whether it must refrain and
ignore the contempt altogether, or whether it must rely on gen­
eral criminal statutes, or whether it must somehow refer the
matter to the executive, rely upon executive or upon the
judiciary to vindicate its authority.
It is also a non-issue in this case that if this
had been a case of indirect or constructive contempt, obviously
the procedure followed by the Assembly would have beers invalid.
There are a good manyof tie cases cited in both of the briefs,
in Petitioner’s brief and Respondent’s brief, which refer
to cases of indirect, constructive contempt, where the legis­
lative bodies have

brought the contemner before the bar of the

House or of the Senate, and -there have heard evidence of what

occurred outside the legislative halls,
structive contempt cases? this is not.

These are conThis is a direct

contempt case involving disorderly conduct.
G

Is there anything in. the record to show why the

Resolution was not passed the same day?
MR. T1NGLUMs
Q

None.

Well, there’s an indication in the opinion, the

Supreme Court of the State placed on judicial notice that
the legislature couldn't act that day, there was so much
disruption.
q

*

.

ic

:i._;

, Yes.

P-

f m twelve noon until approxi­
~

mately midnight,'the legislature was in effect ousted from
its own chamber.

Is that not the case in this record?

MR. TINGLUMs

Yes, it appears in the record.

There has been no evidentiary hearing, so it has not been
developed in that fashion.
Q

What happened the next day?
MR. TINGLUMs I’d have to go outside the record to

tell you Mr, Justice Marshall.
Q

I don’t want you to go outside the record. I just

want to know is there anything in the record to show why
it took two days?

We now have one day explained, but there

is no explanation for the next day.
MR. TINGLUMs Nothing.
Q

Nothing at all.

Is there anything in the record to show what was

brought before the House or was it just the Hesolution?
Was there discussion?
MR. TINGLUMs
show the debate.
Ci

There is nothing in the record to

That is not recited in the Resolution,

Were the two days September 29 and October 1 over

a week end?
MR. TIKGLUMs September 29 was a Monday.

That

was the day on which the legislature was to convene in special
session,
Q

So if

was right at the start of a session?

MR, TINGJjUMs Right at the start of the session.
As a matter of fact, 1 can’t say it was at the start of the
session, because the session did not start on the day it
was to have started.
I have talked about the non-issues, and the issue
as X see it again, is a very narrow ones

Does the Constitu­

tion command that a legislative body exercise its contempt
power

different from the manner in which a court is entitled

to exercise the same power?

There are no cases in point,

at least neither of the parties to this action have been able
to find a case precisely in point.

Most eases discussing

incidents of legislative contempt' are tabes; of constructive
or indirect contempt, where, as X said previously, the contemner
is brought before the bar because the House has not seen the
conduct with its own eyes.

In some of the cases discussing

legislative contempt, it is apparent that a summary procedure
was in fact followed, but there has never been any discussion
of that in any of the cases that have arisen.
Q

Would Wisconsin*s position be the same if a lapse

of time, instead of two days, had been two months?

.

MR. TXNGLUM: I think yes, Wisconsin * s case would be
much weaker,
Q

Why would it be weaker?
MR. TXNGLUM:

Because without anything in the. record

to explain the delay, I think there would be—it would be
just that much more difficult to explain a delay of that
magnitude.

Q

X didn't understand that Wisconsin's position was

that you had to explain anything?
MR. TXNGLUM: We don't, not as far as the two days
are concerned.

Q

X don't understand why,if you don't have to explain

two days, you would have to explain two months.
MR. TIHGLUM: X believe in the first place that there
have been instances, decisions by this Court, for example
in the Terry-

case, ex narte Tarry, in re Maurv, which is a

Second Circuit case, that there have been delays, unexplained,
in the record, and this Court has said that short delays
do not have to fee explained.

For example, in the Tarry case.

X believe there was a delay of one day.

The disorderly conduc

34
occurred in open court on one clay ova the contempt citati on

old not «.xxv.n a:t mini. thu runt day.

The Court said this

delay is trivial»
Q

There has been some reference to the procedure

followed by Judge Madina in contempt cases that occurred
during a prolonged trial in Hew York years ago, Now, suppose
hypothetically that the legislature decided deliberateXy to
postpone the action on the contempt until the last day of the
session or the last week of the session, in order to lettempers cool and get a more objective view, wouldn’t that be
a perfectly valid reason for waiting 30 days or 60 days or
90 days, and who is to complain about that kind of delay for
that reason?
MR* TZKf(uL0M{ Wall, if you delay to that extent,
that would seem to undermine the Assembly's position that it
needed protection, that it had the; authority to remove this
source of disturbance.
Q

That’s only on© of the reasons fox the contempt

powers, isn’t it?
MR. TIHGLUM: Yes.
q

it isn’t the whole basis for giving a legislative

body contempt power.
MR. TXWGXiUHg "ft is not,,

There is self "preservation

and there is what has been called by the courts vindication
of the body's authority, which ~~

Q

And to give an example to secr-sone ox n deterrsr.t

to future similar conduct by others•
MR. TINGLUM:

It has never been mentioned in any

case I’ve seen? but I think as a matter of logic and common
sense, yes, deterrence plays a very large part in this.
There was a case where the United States Senate
proceeded summarily in Bx Parte Nugent, cited in Respondent's
brief, where the debate and the deliberations leading up to
the contempt resolution, and the contempt resolution itself,
were conducted in secret.

There again, and the Circuit

Court for the District of Columbia at that time held that
this was a proper procedure, but the precise point that we
have here, that is, whether or not the legislature has any
less power than the courts around the natior, to proceed in a
proper case in summary fashion, has never been expressly
discussed and decided by any court, but the closest decision
that 1 know that comes to it is Marshall v. Gordon.

There

there is some dicta that suggest that the power the courts
have to exercise summary contempt powers proceeds from the same
source, and that both the legislatures and the courts have
identical summary contempt powers.
The District Judge said, all right, there are no
cases, there’s nothing to guide this court. I am going to
look to see if there are any reasons in logic or in the factual
circumstances of the two bodies, that is the court and

36
legislature, to warrant different treatment before the law,
and the nistrict Judge said, well, there .'‘ara so many people
observing disorderly conduct in the legislative charter
that you could have a good deal of confusion of just what
tc& place, whereas in a court you have only one'judge
looking, it*a easier, and you won'*t have that confusio:?.*
The District Judge said also, a second point, that
there is no transcript of the proceeding in a legislative
chamber, whereas there is in court.
On those two points, the District Court held that
the legislature did not have summary contempt powers.
The Seventh

Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and

1

think

rightly so, because if it is true fchatone pair of eyes is
better than several pairs of eyes, then of course one juror
is better than many jurors,

Appellate courts, for example,

would not be able to observe properly, according to the
District Judge's theory, xvouldn't be able to observe

a direc

contempt.
The differences that are pointed out in the
Respondent's brief between courts and legislatures are such
that the legislature should have summary contempt powers at
least equal to those possessed by the courts, because there
are probably upward;; of five thousand judges in this country
who possess summary contempt powers % there are only fifty
legislatures,

when you stop a legislature, there is no other

37
body that can pick up the ball’and run v?it:'h it and do th
work of that iegisI&tw?©;,

It stops.

And a .continual

week by week disturbance in a legislature wetid forever
stop that legislature.
Furthermore, a legislative body when it is pro­
ceeding to act upon a contempt# acts publicly# there is
publicity# there is deliberation,

usually in a two-party

political system you can expect debate before action is taken.
There are certainly similarities between legislatures and
courts that again call for similar treatment, similar power?
of self-preservation.

They have been cited—cases' have been

cited going back to parliamentary times in England, colonial
times in this country, Anderson v. Dunn, up to Marshall v.
Gordon, and Niamey v« BiacCracken,

where this Court has said

that the legislature is just as vulnerable as any court to
attack.and disruption, so this has been acknowledged by this
Court many times that it is essential to preserve the inde­
pendence of a legislative body, and you cannot .force the
legislature to rely upon the sometimes hostile judiciary or
an unfriendly executive, taking those words from 'United States
V-, Johnson.

There is certainly e. need on the part of the legi:
lature as great as in the courts, to continue to function and
to continue the dialogue that takes place in a legislature.
There aren't differences that, warrant denial of this power

to a legis?,'.

.

Lmj

call for and demonstrate that both bodies must have

eq'ial

powers to protect themselves from attack.
The contempt power is a radical power» it's drastic»
it's subject to great abuse and is very properly limited, arid
bask in 1848» the Wisconsin Legislature did very severely
limit the contempt power of the houses of the legislature*
It described a very, very narrow area in which the legislature
could act upon a direct contempt? only where there has been
disorderly conduct on the floor of the house, in the immediate
view of the house, and which directly tends to disrupt
can the legislature act summarily.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

You have four minutes left, Hr. Coffey.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. COFFEY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COFFEYt

Mr. Chief Justice, the inquiry, the

Respondent has conceded that tb© summary contempt power is a
very great power* subject to abuse.

In the instant case,

there ia no way the Petitioner has ever been able to get a
review of the factual basis on which the legislature acted.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court ir. denying the writ of petition
for habeas corpus suggested that some type of judicial review
was available.

We filed a petition for rehearing in the

39
Wisconsin Suprema Court, ari requested, ir. dicated tha : their
opinion indicated such judicial review war. available» while
the authority we had found indicated to the contrary,

Would

the Court please advise, the Petitioner what kind of hearing
was available to him, and grant him that hearing.
But even assuming he could have gotten a hearing at
that time, 1 think we must recognise the hearing comes too
late.

The Petitioner was already in jail pursuant to the

contempt Resolution, and at that point he had been denied
bail and I don't believe he should have his right to a hearing
on factual basis of the contempt after he is already in jail.
X think the hearing should precede the right of anyone to
place him in custody, I suggest that as the District Court
held, that at a very minimum the Petitioner was entitled
to be given notice of the charges against him and be given
an opportunity to respond to them.
Thank you.
Q

Mr. Coffey, do you suggest thet; judicial review

of the legislative contempt

determination would be available,

for example, on the weight of the evidence or just on pro­
cedural regularity?
MR. COFFEYs

X would suggest, Mr, Chief Justice, it

has to be available on both, or there would be no basis on
which to check the arbitrary exorcise of power fey the legis­
lature

40
Q

What you are suggesting, then, is that judicial

branch would have the power to redetermine the facts, as
distinguished from passing merely on prc-cedural regularity
of the contempt process?
MR, COFFEY: X think that is essential, Hr, Chief
Jostle©, or there is no cheek on completely arbitrary incar­
ceration of people that displease the legislative'body
and there has to be a check on that kind of power, yes,
Q

Isn’t that what the Supreme Court of Wisconsin

said is available, page 123-& of the appendis??
MR. COFFEY: It seems to say that's what is available
and the review procedure is not available.
Q

The only issues presented dealt primarily with

procedure, not with the issue of his innocence or with the
merits of any defense, implying that had you presented
problems on the merits, they would have reviewed it.
MR. COFFEY:

They did suggest that, which is con­

trary, as the District Court opinion noted, was contrary to the
existing case law in Wisconsin at the time, and when the
Petitioner asked for that hearing, the motion for rehearing
was denied without hearing and without comment.
Q

Is it not contrary to the general line of authority

of both the English and early American cases also, the review
of the merits?
MR. COFFEY: Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice,

Q

So this probably reasonably fails within the cate­

gory of dicta by the court in the Wisconsin car.:;©- does it not
MR* COFFEY: Either -that, or an overruling of other
authority without expressly doing so, yes*
Q

And where it was not necessary to reach th

point?

MR. COFFEYs Yes.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERf
Coffey.

Thank you, gentlemen.

Thank you, Mr.

Th© case is submitted.

(Whereupon, at 11?02 a„ra. the case was submitted.)
