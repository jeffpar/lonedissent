MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER %

We will hear arguments

next in Mo. 5030, Papachristou against Jacksonville.
Mr, Jacobson, you. may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL S. JACOBSON, ESQ,,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. JACOBSONs

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This case involves the conviction of eight persons
for vagrancy in the Municipal Court in the City of Jacksonville
Florida, under the Jacksonville vagrancy ordinance.
Petitioners, in the trial court and through the
Florida appellate system, contended that the ordinance upon
which they were convicted was facially invalid, and they are
now here on a writ of certiorari to tbs First District Court of
Appeals of the State of Florida, where they.again offered the
same contention,

Q

It is — in your brief you talk both of the

ordinance and, for reasons that 1 think X understand, also of
the State statute,
MR, JACOBSONs
Q

— a very similar one, which is on assimilative

MR. JACOBSON:
that.

Right, I just —

Right,

I just was going to mention

We've treated that on the possibility that the City

might attempt to fall basic, after our brief was filed, on the

4
State statute.

They've not done so, and I don’t think the State

statute is involved in this case,
Q

So it’s common ground now that what’s at issue

her© is the ordinance and only the ordinance?
MR. JACOBSON?
Q

Yes, sir.

Right.

MR* JACOBSON:

They are very similar, so that I

don’t think it makes very much difference.
Q

All right,

MR. JACOBSON?

But there's no question that the

statute is not involved now.
The only contention that we do offer is that the City
Ordinance is, on its face, unconstitutional and invalid.
We contend, at the seme time, that the whole
ordinance is unconstitutional.
We argue that the petitioners in this ease were
convicted generally of vagrancy, and, at the least,, it cannot
be said, at least with regard to seven of theta, that they were
convicted under any specific sub-part of the ordinance in
question; and that, as a result, under this Court’s previous
rulings, that they are able to show that any part of the
general legislation is unconstitutional, then they are
entitled to a reversal and to acquittal.
Because our attack is limited to the facial validity
of the ordinance, I do not propose to go into the statement of

5
facts that were set out by stipulation with the City in the
petitioners' brief, unless there is some question about one
particular ease from any member of the Court.
Q

Yes, I have on© question.

MR. JACOBSONs
Q

On© of the petitioners here is Brown.

MR. JACOBSON?
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Was Brown loitering?

MR. JACOBSON * The evidence was that Brown came out of
a hotel, which was supposed to be of low repute, and that as he
walked out of the hotel he was moving, it was late at night, and
he had something which resembled money in his hand, and that
two police officers who were there were suspicious of him, and
that they than called him over, as he walked down the street.
Unless hia movement down the street could be
considered loitering, 1 don't know that there would be any
evidence of loitering in the case.
Q

Wall, my impression is, and perhaps you can

talk about it later, is that the Brown situation is considerably
different from those of the others?
MR. JACOBSON?

Brown's situation is added to round

out the package of these cases, because we assume that the city
would contend that there were circumstances in which something
like a vagrancy statute or an ordinance would be required for
true offenders or hard-core criminals; and we did want to bring

6
an instance of at least that sort of alleged situation before
the Court.
Q

Welly putting it another way, I think if Brown

ware here alone, his posture would be much more difficult,
comparatively, anyway.
MR, JACOBSONs

X think if Brown were'hors alone, the

case would not be nearly so appealing as the other people,
some of whom have suffered really blatant oppression.
Now, 1 don’t think, however, that the grossness of
Brown’s character and the testimony against him would really
affect the attack on the social validity of the ordinance.
Q

Has a narcotics charge ever been brought against

him?
MR. JACOBSON;
brought against him.

Yes, sir, a narcotics charge was

It was subsequently dismissed because

in the court of proper jurisdiction for that charge, it was
found that the narcotics had been found by reason of an
i

unreasonable search, because of his being stopped on the
occasion and questioned.
Q

Was this ordinance something adopted from one

of the early Colonial ordinances, or from something in England?
MR. JACOBSON;

It goes back farther than any of the

earlier Colonial ordinances, Mr. Chief Justice.

It is very

strikingly similar to an ordinance of 1597 that brought
together the old English legislation up to that date.

It was

7
called the Statute of Elizabeth.
One of the commentators, in fact, pointed out the
very striking similarity between this legislation and that.
Q

When was it adopted in Jacksonville first?

MR. JACOBSONs
I tried to find oat.

I haven’t bean able to ascertain that*

But Jacksonville, like a lot of small

towns f had a devastating fire at one time, and it burned down
the courthouse.
Q

I’v® been.
Isn't there a lawyer in town with an old library?

MR. JACOBSONs

I haven’t been able to find it.

I

checked the City Attorney's office, &nd went back and reviewed
all of the old records.

I could find suggestions to it, I

could say that it cam© into existence in the early part of the
Century.

But precisely when, we just were unable to

ascertain.
Q

It reads like 159?.

Q

It was recently amended, wasn't it, modernised

by eliminating the word "juggling**?
MR. JACOBSONs
Q

Yes, sir.

That’s correct.

But it left "rogues and vagabonds" in.

MR. JACOBSONs And considerably more.
Q

Wall, this man — I’ve forgotten what his name

is — what is this "vagrancy - prowling by automobile"
MR. JACOBSON? We contend that there is no such thing
as "vagrancy ~ prowling by auto85.

Really —

8
Q

Wall, hot*; can you be vagrant if you own an

automobile?
MR. JHCOBSO??2
Florida»

It. doesn’t make any difference in

2 iiaagino the President of the United States, in

the City of Jacksonville, could be a vagrant, if — assuming
that there is any ascertainable standard in this ordinance,
under certain circumstances.
Q

Bow about “persons able to work but habitually

living upon the earnings of their wives"?
MR. J&C03S0Ms That goes to our contention that the
ordinance is just unconstitutionally vague.
Q

That’s not very vague — (laughing) — that’s

not very vague.
MR. JACOBSONs

Well, who is "able to work" and

what is "habitually living on the earnings of their wives
or minor children”?

That’s what we contend — wo thoroughly

contend that that invades a restricted area of privacy that

1

the State is not entitled to go into.
When all is said and don®, it's difficult to under­
stand why this vagrancy concept has persisted for as long as
it has, anyway.

The plain fact of the matter is that it was

born in the peculiar socio-economic naede of Feudal England
and. Elizabethan England, broadened 'over a period of some two
or -three hundred years, all going back four or five hundred
years before now? and really has no application to the current

9
needs of our society, and, more than that, it's offensive to
many of our settled and fundamental notions of democracy.
tod, further than that, it's been criticised almost
universally by the commentators that have treated it# and in
recent years by the State Courts and lower Federal Courts who
have had occasions to consider it on the merits*
Yet# even though the Florida ordinance and the
Jacksonville — the Florida statute and the Jacksonville
ordinance, which is really derived from the Florida statute,
are probably the most archaic of all of the State statutes.
The Florida system has just tenaciously clung to it.
Q

Wall,it9s not a — it’s far from a dead letter,

though.
MR. JACOBSOHs
Q

Not at all a dead letter.

Haven't I read somewhere in these papers that

there are hundreds of arrests under this statute, undor this
ordinance, every year? are -there not?
MR. JACOBSONs

In the City of Jacksonville alone,

in the first ten months of 1971, there were 986 arrests.

I

don't know how many there have been over the State. . In the
last figures published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
the last crime statistics for the nation as a whole,-and
statistics covering approximately 140 million people, there
were over 106,000 arrests*
Q

That was in 1963.

But under various statutes and ordinances?

10
MR. JAGOBSONs Across the country, yes. sir.
Q

Biit under this particular ordinance, which you

tell us is so Archaic, it still seems to be a very actively
utilised piece of legislation.
MR. JACOBSONs Very aggressively utilised.

Not only

are there arrests, there area also substantial convictions.
Q

Yes.

MR. JACOBSON %
Q

With jail time imposed.

It's a Claafe D offense, what's the maximum —

oh, 1 see it now? 90 days.
Q

And $500.

MR. JACOBSON;

At the time of these cases.

Since

then, in order to avoid the Fifth Circuit's rulings with
regard to the right, to counsel in petty offenses, which was
before the Court on Monday, the maximum has been limited to 75
days, with no right df aggregation, though? this is a flat 75day maximum.
•' t-

Q

V

And $450?

MR. JACOBSON;

Yes, sir.

..

That was because ©f some — probable dictum in Fifth
Circuit cases saying that a $500 fine activated the right to
counsel.
We contend that the legislation is invalid on several
constitutional bases.

The first one and the easiest one is

that it9s fraught with vagueness.

II
This Court* going hack as far as SO years ago* in
Conaally vs. General Construction Company* said that legislation
which required that a normal and ordinary person guess as to
its meaning, about which reasonable men might differf was
unconstitution&lly vague,
It would seem to us that the requirement that there

be definiteness in a criminal statute or a statute of this
sort, really is necessary for basically three functions;
one, to provide modus to affected persons? two, to provide
ascertainable standards of enforcement to people who are
charged with enforcement? and, three, to provide a breathing
©pace ©r to eliminate chill of people who wish to exercise
preferred rights or constitutionally guaranteed rights»
The first question, that is, whether this legislation
provides notice, almost answers itself*

It's really

impossible to read the legislation end be able to put any
definite meaning on virtually any one of the various sub-parts.
To begin with, the initial provision, "rogues”.
don't know who can define what a rogue is.

I

And as you move

through it, and even with the provision that Mr. Justice Brennan
spoke of, dealing with able-bodied people who habitually live
on the earnings of their wives or minor children, I don't know
that anybody could put any precise definition on that language.
Certainly it's clear that the ordinance is a good
deal more vague and elusive than the ordinance ©r the statute

12
that was struck down some 30 or 40 years ago by this Court in
Lanaefcta vs. New Jersey, dealing with people who associate
themselves with gangs of more than — throe or more persons*
Q

Are you asking ns to strike it down ’without

more, or just strike it down as it applies to these cases?
MR* JACOBSONj We’re asking you to strike it down
independently of the application in these cases.
Q

Well, I mean no one was convicted of being a

rogus or vagabond?
MR. JACOBSON?
Q

No, sir»

Yet you want us to strike that?

MR. JACOBSON s We contend that —
G

How do these folks come under the statute?

MR* JACOBSON?

Well, in two ways.

In the beginning,

these people were charged flatly with vagrancy.

It is our

contention there is language which appears on the docket
entry which forms the charging instrument in the Municipal
Court.
Q

And that, you suggest, is, in effect, to charge

them with every one of these things?
MR. JACOBSONs

Ho.

We say that that doesn't limit it»

That, for example, as Mr. Justice Marshall pointed out, there
are some of these people who were charged with vagrancy prowling by auto; we say that that's simply an explanatory
statement by the arresting police officer, regarded as

surplusage by the court.

Mot legally limiting to tha charge at

all.
Q

Well, there’s no reference in the ordinance,

is there, of prowling by auto?
MR.JACOBSON s

That9s right.

For which reason we contend that they were, in effect,
charged with vagrancy generally.
Q

Which means, than, every tiling that's in there.

MR. JACOBSON?
Q

Is that right?

MR. JACOBSONt
Q

Correct.

Correct.

Do you contend that no one could ever be

convicted lawfully, constitutionally, for any act under this
ordinance?
MR. JACOBSONs

Very definitely.

We contend that no

on© could ever know what is to be prescribed by this ordinance 0

X don't know what a "common drunkard” is as

distinguished from an uncommon on®, or a habitual one? but
suppose a man's drunk on th© street, and on the sidewalk,
completely in a coma.
ME. JACOBSON;

Could he be arrested under this statute?
Ordinarily he's not.

There's a

specific
Q

Well, but could he ba?

MR. JACOBSON;
to answer

Presumably he could be.

I'm not able

14
Q

Would it be invalid as applied to him?

MR. JACOBSONs

I would saw so, because ho has no way

of knowing, before he get® himself in that state, what a common
drunkard is, and whether he's going to b® subject to the
ordinance? if he puts himself in that position.
Q

What about Jimmy Lee Smith and Milton Henry,

according to this they were charged with •’’vagrancy - vagabonds”,
MR, JACOBSONz

Jimmy Lee Smith is the only one that’s

not in the category that 1 spoke of.

He's charged with some­

thing that is specifically ralafcable to the ordinance.
Q

Now, what about those charged with “vagrancy -

common thief"?

There’s no "common thief" listed there, is

there?
MR. JACOBSON:
Q

No, sir.
».

.

And how about "loitering”f is that in there?

MR. JACOBSONt

No, sir.

One man is charged with "disorderly loitering on the
street"» and there's something in there that relates to
"disorderly people"? but there's nothing on loitering,
Q

I know what "disorderly65 is, but what's

"di^orderly loitering"?

MR. JACOBSONs

surplusage.

And

1 don't know.

It has no basis in the

that's why we contend that it's really

If it was legally limiting in any way, then our

motion to dismiss at trial level would have been required to be

13
granted*
S will say this, at the time the legislation was

i
begun, there was a category in Florida law known as •'■'common
thief”, which persisted up until the early part of the century9

:

providing that anybody who had been convicted of theft

;

i

!

constituting a felony for two times and more became a "common
thief” and war/ subject to 20 years' imprisonment.

j
I

That was in existence at the time this legislation
was passed, and this legislation did not refer to "common
thief89»
Q

Wall, that was just — that was a recidivist

i

statute, wasn't it?
*

MR* JACOBSON ft

ii

A crude one*

Beg pardon?
i

MR. JACOBSONj

A crude one? a crude recidivist

0

Yes, but you're not telling us that somebody

I
:
i
i
i

who had been convicted and served whatever his punishment was,
twice for theft, then could be arrested as a common thief,

;
i

on that charge, are you?
MR.

JACOBSOH$

At that time that was the case, yes,

sir.

,
i
i
i

Q

Well, you — let’s say he’s been convicted and
\

sentenced to five years5 imprisonment, that he had served once
for theft, and then he's guilty of theft again and served his

t

16
sentence of another five years.

Then at any time he walked

around Jacksonville he would be — could be he be arrested as
a “common thief" and charged with it and sent to prison again?

MR. JACOBSON % That was a State statute.
he walked around the State of Florida.

Any time

That statute is no

longer in effect. But we have the same thing being don®, through
a municipal ordinance, in this instance.

He can only ba sent

to jail for 75 days, but if he has been guilty of some sort of
theft, whether he's been convicted of it or not, it might be
contended that he's in the "thief85 category.
■;

Q

'

But your point is you don't have that here,

because it's not that specific, you don't know what it means?
it's too vague.

That's what you:*re arguing, isn't it?

MR. JACOBSONs
"common thief" meant.

My point is that we don't know what
Two of these individuals were charged

with being common thieves? and that has no reference to the
ordinance.
The ordinance does refer to thieves, and the ordinance
would have the effect that you’ve spoken of for people who
might be considered to be in the category of "thief", whatever
that is.

Vagrancy is a continuing offense.

If somebody had

committed a theft or had. been convicted of a theft, or two or
three, whether — however long ago it had been, however minor
it had been, or however much h® had repented, he's still
subject to continuing incarceration in Jacksonville.

17
0

Every day could he fos arrested?

MR, JACOBSONs

He can *t walk the streets of Jackson”

ville without being subject to arrest.

If this legislation is

valid,
He can serve 75 days and, immediately on release, is
subject to re-arrest.
Q

I suppose, then, the more he gets arrested the

easier it is to sustain the charge, because they can identify
him?
MR, JACOBSON:
Q

The more confirmed it is, yes, sir,

That makes it “common" then, by repetition,

1 suppose, in effect,? is that it?
MR, JACOBSONs
Justice.

I’m not able to say, Mr, Chief

Nobody knows, and that9s precisely where the —
Q

2 suppose in the archaic language used in this

ordinance and in the statute that "common* must have meant, at
the tins© it was originally written, "commonly known to foe"
that kind of a person,
MR. JACOBSON:

No — that’s the point, there’s no

reference to "cwammon® in this ordinance, in this legislation.
2a 3QVX& prior legislation that was in existence **Q

Well, there’s "common drunkards".

MR. JACOBSONs
regard to thieves only.
Q

Oh

That’s true.

I’m speaking with

18
MR, JACOBSONt That5s true.
But there there was a legislative definition of what

* cosmon” was.
Q

I don't know.
X suppose what they called a *common drunkard"

in. that day is an alcoholic today, a man constantly getting
drunk.
MR» JACOBSONs Welle x-m can only suppose? that8® my
point»
With regard to the vagueness point, we think that
the matter was capsulised very well by Mr. Justice Frankfurter

in his dissenting opinion in Winters vs. Haw Task in 1940soma thing»

He there pointed out that this legislation ffills,

or this typo of legislation falls in a unique category? that

it's purposely designed to he vagus, and purposely designed,
to be open-ended.
And it's significant that Mr. Justice Frankfurter did
that, and it's further significant that he did it in the
circumstances in which he did, because he was there dissenting
from a majority holding that the legislation was unconstitution
ally vague, and he catalogued the reasons why a court should be
very hesitant to declare legislation unconstitutionally vague,
and h® specified as an exception the area of vagrancy, which
he said was in a unique category and stood by itself, and was
egregiously bad.
In addition to the problem of lack of notice to

1®
affected persons, we have also the problem that’s presented by
lack of any sort of enforcement standards.

There is no way

any police officer or jury or municipal judge or anybody else
can knew what8s intended.

And this, la and of itself, invites

standardless and discriminatory enforcement, especially mien
we have legislation of the open-ended sort we have here, that
can be directed and applied to unconventional or unpopular or
unestablished people, of a sort to invite abuse anyway, from
people who are not willing to be broadminded or tolerant of
them.
Finally, the legislation, because of its breadth and
broadness, necessarily must restrict people in the attempted
exercise or the-desired exercise cf rights that are preserved
to them without question by the Constitution. Certainly the
right of travel is drawn into question by the provision against
wandering fresa placa to place, for example? and we have
enumerated others in our brief, with the suggestion how they
might be similarly affected.
Apart from that contention, we also contend under a
broad grouping that we call abuse of police power, that the
ordinance is constitutionally invalid in other respects.
We contend, first, that insofar as it relate© to people who
are in the category Mr. Justice Brennan spoke of, "living
on the earnings of their wives88 and so on, that it invades the
zone of privacy that was sought to be secured by Griswold vs.

20
Connecticut.
Further, even in the part of the ordinance which
deals with thieves and gamblers and whafc-hava-you, which might
be outside that area, the legislation is still over-broad,
because the completeness of its application, the point that Mr.
i

Justice Stewart was speaking of, where it can be applied
reeurringly over and over again against one individual, so
that he becomes permanently an outcast and permanently subject
,

'■(
*

to incarceration.
In this regard it's significant to not® that the only
justification ordered for that kind of — offered for that kind
of breadth and scope by the City of Jacksonville is crime
control, and it’s significant that there are ample crime
control methods available to the City of Jacksonville or the
State of Florida that can. accomplish the same purposes that
this legislation can accomplish without nearly the oppression
to human and individual rights.
We say also as our third major point, and related to
the abuse of police power, that really the legislation is
no more than a legislative declaration that some people are
suspicions, per se? that soma people are tending to crime,
per se; ape that they must be suppressed at the outset
independently of any act ox commission on their part.
This is amply borne out by the history of the

the

social history of the legislation, by the contention that’s made

21
by the City, expressed in its brief, and by the history of
application, well-documented by

boards such as the President’s

Commission on Law Enforcement, and the American Bar Association’s
Foundation for Criminal Justice, which have all found that the
legislation is used primarily for the arrest of people on
suspicion only, when police officers require a makeweight, and
they can’t find anything else to use as grounds for an arrest.
We say that this pattern and tradition of use has
become an integral part of the statute and in fact it’s resulted
because it was built into the statute or into the ordinance
in the first instance, and is only the inevitable result of
I

it, and will continue unless the legislation is now struck

State of Florida,

The Supreme Court of the State of Florida

has laid down a standard, as specific as you can get in this
type of a situation, as to when this particular type of
ordinance or statute will be enforced„

And has spelled out

that it would be cautiously and sparingly used upon vagrants
that are vagrants of their own volition,

And this has been

reaffirmed by the Supreme Court, after it was first pronounced
in 1965,
This particular case — and„ incidentally, Your
Honors, the Florida Supreme Court has on previous occasions
stricken, or reversed the trial courts for the unconstitutional
application of this particular ordinance,
Q

Has It ever set aside any of these ordinances

cast in archaic terms?
MR, AUSTIN*
per se, Your Honor,

1 know of none that they have stricken,
Justice Ervin, whom 2 consider a very

enlightened jurist on our Supreme Court, has acknowledged that
certain sections of the vagrancy statute, vagrancy ordinance
have simply fallen into disuse, as has been the situation in
hundreds of our State statutes which are now being studied and
being revised by 'our Legislature at the present time,
*H© acknowledges in one of his opinions that gave us
caution and guidance in this area, that if the facts did not
support the conviction that the court should not hesitate to
strike them down as being unconstitutionally applied.

pose or object1’.

1 think the idea of saying that a vagrant

Honor, is not the intention of the Legislature or the legis­
lation.

something is old, Your Honor, that it’s bad. The Constitution

t

24
of the United States is old, and vie want through Black*s
Lav? Dictionary, we went through Webster's Dictionary, and

on words and phrases, and we have no trouble defining who
these people are, and we think that they are advised who they
are.
Now, I thought ~~
Q

How about people that go to their club, their

private club, quote “where alcoholic beverages are sold and
served", are they vagrants?
MR. AUSTIN?
C

No, sir, Your Honor,

It would be —
i

Why not?

HR, AUSTIN?

I think that would foe an unconstitutional

application to statute, and I don't think the court would
hast!tats to strike it down,
Q

X understand your total defense of this statute

to foe that a Supreme Court has told the law enforcement
officials "to foe careful how you us© it".

Is that your

defense?
MR, AUSTIN?
Q

Ho, sir.

No, sir,

What is your defense of this particular ordinance? ’

MU, AUSTIN: There are certain parts of this ordinance
that have — incidentally, Your Honor, our Supreme Court has
tola us that- they consider it unconstitutional, a statute that
made a person explain why they

were at a place, which seems

to foe the modal penal code's approach to it, as violative of

25
the Fifth Amendment,

So we sort of don’t know what to do,

and trie Supreme Court of the State of Florida haa told us that
the best thing we have is the vagrancy statute which has been
upheld in a large number of States, and therefore, "why don't
you use this, since it’s been tried and tested?”
But it didn't delineate or pull out certain words
that should have been omitted,

1 think that the Legislature

and I would be -the first, and candid with the Court, to say
that the Legislature should delete some of these words.
Q

Well, they did take out "juggling”,

MR, AUSTIN3 That was the City Council, Your Honor,
And they should — I will stipulate that some other words
should come out of the ordinance. And I think legislatively
they should come out,

Whether or not the entire ordinance goes

to the police power of the State, the very heart of the police
power of the State and the city, is something else again.
Arid 1 think that it does.
But let me, if I may, say how this case got here.
We went t© the — we have a very fine judge on our Circuit
Court bench that reviewed this case when it was brought over
to him from the Municipal Court.

The only thing that he was

permitted to consider was the constitutionality of the statute
on its face.
Then it went to the District Court of Appeals, and
in the petitioner's brief the only thing he asked for was that

26
they consider the constitutionality of the statute on its face.
At no place did the Florida Court get to look at these facts.
X will be candid with the Court* they have mad©
allegations here that are not even under the ordinance and
should have been reversed* and the first appellate step in the
Florida appellate structure should have been permitted* and
would have* in my opinion, directed the Municipal Court to
straighten -that out.
There were no prosecutors in this court at that time.
And they go in* and it is an unfortunate situation that our
Municipal Courts are rim the way they do.
But Mr. Jacobson makes a big thing out of 900~andsome vagrancy arrests this year.
our community.

We have 550*000 people in

That’s approximately three a day.

And let me

point out that in the State of Florida you cannot make an
ax .lost for many* many of the things that are mentioned in the
statute* unless they are committed in the presence of the
officer;- only a felony.

If it6s a misdemeanor or the violation

of a municipal ordinance* if the officer is thirty seconds late*
he .xs required to go around to a magistrate and get a warrant.
So he does use this* and then the vagrancy ordinance*
and then the charge is changed* as is often the case in the
administration of criminal law justice.
So* out of approximately three arrests a day* many
of them* on the* docket sheet the next morning* would be changed?

27

although the arrest was vagrancy.

Because he was thirty second;?

late in getting to the scene where there's been a brawl„
With the evidence obvious, and the people tailing the — giving
the officer good grounds to make an arrest, except he just
doesn't have time to go get a warrant.
And it’s a very practical,, necessary ordinance for
the maintenance of public order in Jacksonville„ Florida.
Just because it8a old — stipulating that the Legislature should
strike some of the verbiage, just because it*s old would not
necessarily seem to be grounds; for reversing it.
Q

Wallp 1 think the suggestions about the age of

the statute and the ordinance, Mr. Austin, are directed at the
fact that it was using terms which today are labeled archaic
in —
MR. AUSTIN:
Q

Yes, sir.

— dictionaries, and in common understanding.

I don't think anyone is concerned about its age, per se, but
only that it uses language from another age.
MR. AUSTIN:

Your Honor, if this Court opens the

door to the Florida Legislative Redrafting sessions, which
they are now going into, by simply taking it from the first
court, no chance to look at the facts, the District Court of
Appeals, no chance to look at the facts, and this Court starts
looking into rewriting the Florida Code, we will find about
200 statutes that need to have their language updated.

And

28
this is no exception.
1 respectfully
Q

Well, that's true of the United States

Constitution, isn't it?
MR. AUSTIN i

I respectfully submit. Your Honor, that

this is a proper function ~~
Q

It was written in the 18th Century*

MR. AUSTIN:

Yes, sir, Your Honor,

2 respectfully submit that this is a proper
function for the Legislature. They're getting to it.

Amusingly,

they're getting to it right now, while Mr. Jacobson is here.
Toward redrafting and getting our Code, we've even obtained
federal funds for our State Legislature to study our Criminal
Code, and to bring it up to date, and to get rid of this
archaic language.
But 1 submit that ~
Q

But what your Legislature is doing won't get

rid of this Jacksonville Ordinance, though, will it?
MR. AUSTINs

Your Honor, I have absolutely no doubt.

I'm General Counsel for the City, I have absolutely no doubt
that ones soma guidance comes to us from some place that we
will adept proper language.

1 submit that in studying the

model penal code, the draft of 1969, that some vary fin®
scholars drafted, -that it will probably fall from constitutionality because it permits a man to be detained for 20 mirmfe-s

And so, I don’t know

Well, I'm just a little puzzled.

suggesting that the Florida Legislature —

Are you

and we*ve seen some

of this in other cases argued within the last couple of weeks?
apparently they've been very active working on your criminal
code — but that they do something with this provision in the
statute doesn't mean necessarily that Jacksonville is going
to do anything with the ordinance , doss it?
What we have before us is only the ordinance, is it
not?
MR. AUSTIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And in these places

where the archaic language appears, if it is the policy of
this Court, X would stipulate to it being straightened.
that is the policy of this Court.

If

I don't think it's before this

Court, but if that’s the policy of this Court, I’ll stipulate
to the archaic language being stricken.
X think the next case before you is very critical,
the prowling and loitering without a lawful purpose, or, as
our court has said, with an unlawful purpose.

I think that the

power to make the arrest in the places that they are most
normally made — and, incidentally, these are obviously,from
the vast number of cases, the worst possible

factual situations

they could have gotten before this Court? and I submit that
s

the Florida Court would never have let them get here? it would

30
have been reversed immediately by the District Court of Appeals,
because they don’t even charge under the ordinance.

These —

they miss the ordinance,,
And I think this is

guidance of the Florida Supreme Court, that tbs trial judges

t

•

And it’s on these casesif they are properly before you, I
will stipulate that they were unconstitutionally applied.

Well, I’m not sure I understood your observation

about, that the Florida courts would have stricken this had
they had the chance.

Appeals

Q

Mo, sir.

No, sir, Your Honor»

Well, how did this — where did this case come

from, to us?
MR. AUSTIN i From the District Court of Appeals, and
in the petition the petitioner said the only issue before the
Court is the constitutionality of the ordinance on its face.

31
He said that to -’die Circuit Judge , who sat in review
of that in the Municipal Court? he has never asserted that
these facts were unconstitutionalXy applied, which has been
the law of this Court and of the Florida courts, in this area,
in the last few years.
Q

But of course that court —- did it have the

option to reject that argument and say that it was un,constitu­
tion as it applies in this case?
MR. AUSTINs

No, sir, they were not asked to do that,

Your Honor.
Q

But did it have the option to do so?

Could it have don® so?
MR. AUSTIN?

You’re asking if the judge would go

beyond the requested relief by the lawyer when he goes in on

appeal?
Q

Well, this would be on the grounds.

He granted

the relief as tc this particular person or parsons before him, —*
MR» AUSTIN5
Q

That’s not —

then the man wouldn't have any constitutional

claim left, would he?
MR. AUSTIN?

Your Honor, our adversary system in

Jacksonville — and I don’t think in most of the other sections
of the country it works that way — if a lawyer waives all the
points except ona, that's the only one the court will consider.
That's been the policy of this Court? if you don't raise it, you

Now, Your Honor, I submit that that is basically

cases on the merits.

So

And he should have

And Justice Holmes tayss that that's fatal.

And we*Ve

cited that in our brief.
I would like to submit to the Court, and I, in this

34
brief time, certainly can!fc go into a deep-root®d philosophical
discussion, but as old as this statute is, as archaic as some
of the language is,* it is a very important law enforcement
tool.

It goes to the very heart of the police power of our

municipality, and to the police power of the State of Florida.
And if it n<aeds to be revised, this Court has, time
after time, spoken of the

fact that it will not strike- a

statute if it can b© construed to be constitutional, that it
must be,beyond any reasonable doubt, unconstitutional? and the
fact that there's some archaic.language in a statute doesn*t
make it unconstitutional in its total situation.
This Court has, in fact, held that it is the duty —
that it has the duty to uphold the police power measure if it
bears some rational relationship to health, safety, morals,
or general welfare, and the means employed reasonably accom­
plishes the desired results,
The means here ware probably an unconstitutional
application of that statute, but then this ordinance would,

submit to the Court, must be considered to be a valid
exercise of the police power.
And the fact that it is inarticularly drawn is
immaterial, if it goes to the relationship of health, safety,
moral#, and general welfare.

And I respectfully submit that

you can't read this without saying it goes to the general

welfare, the public safety.

I will give you — I could give you a list of
illustrations of the —

You are not suggesting the statute which says

That would be probably just as vague,

MR. AUSTINS Yes, sir.

You don’t think this helps?

MR. AUSTIN; The Civil Rights Act/ as sustained back
in '64, was pretty vague.

Wa talk in terms-of vagueness, Your

Honor, I don’t mean to appear to be flippant, but — and I’m
not, certainly not? I have the deepest respect — but the
guidelines laid down in Roth, for example, and cited in our
brief, the reasonable speed, many words that just defy strict
definition',

And as Justice Frankfurter pointed out on a

number of occasions, that this balance between the maintenance
of public order and criminal conduct, and drawing rules .
and language broad enough to protect the public, and narrow
enough to protect the individual is what it’s all, about,
And it is really — the original handbook on legis­
lative drafting, that this will be constitutional and this will
be not.

This is a tremendously complex, difficult area.

3S
And so 1 will simply submit it on the fact that it
is not unconstitutionally -vagus in view of the many words that
this Court has held to ha constitutional — not constitutionally
vague.
Our brief cites many illustrations- of that.
There must he a place on reasonable application of
the — of this particular ordinance and phases and phrases
within this ordinance where it would be held to he constitu­
tional; therefore, it cannot be stricken on its face, under the
laws and under the rules laid down by this Court.
Because in many provisions of it, which say that? and

city, of the consolidated government of the City of Jacksonville.

If you'll pardon the personal reference, up until a

But to say that they are all bad, or that they are

is manifestly unfair.
Three arrests today in a city of 550,000 people
cannot be a wide, broad use of the statute, when you consider
that it is being applied in order that some arrests can be made
that could not otherwise be made, to protect the public
interest.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL S6 JACOBSON, ESQ,,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, JACOBSON«

I would like, first of all, to respond

to some of the explicit statements made by Mr. Austin.
The contention that we're out of court, because the
writ has been misdirected, we submit is no more than a quibble
that really is not entitled to any standing.
We treated this question at some length in our reply
brief.

The matter was also litigated in connection with the

i

application for a writ of certiorari.
If, in fact, the? City is correct, that the writ was
misdirected, then the simple answer would be for the review
that this Court makes to be of the Circuit Court order, which
can well be dona, and that's the proper remedy.
In connection with the application for certiorari.
we responded to the City's response by saying that we would
be very pleased for the writ to be directed to the Circuit
Court instead of to the First District, if that was the
appropriate choice,

And we think• that/’it makes ©. difference,

42
it's a difference without a distinction for purposes of these
proceeding3.
I'm at a loss to understand the City*8 recurrent
citation of. the Headley vs, Selkowitss language by the Florida
Supreme Court, that the vagrancy statute is not to be used very
liberally by Florida law enforcement officers.
that providas any comfort to the City.

1 don’t sas how

It seems to me that -this

is no more — or no less than an expressed statement that law
enforcement officers are not to make an even-handed applicatior
of the statute, but that they are given license and freedom to
decide for themselves what the standards of an arrest ar© going
to be? which, to us, seems to point up the very vice of the
statute that we complain about.
Mr, Austin says

that it was not intended to apply

just to poor people, and in its application has not had that
effect,

X submit that, while it may not be applied to poor

people alone, that, by and large, the application, is to people
who are email people, people who are in no position to protest
or to make their protest heard.
The keeper of the largest gambling place in Florida,

X believe, is the president of Hialeah Ra<Se Track.

MR. JACOBSONS

Ho, sire? -chat5a not* but the,

Florida statute —
Q

So that it isn't subject to this ordinance, then?

liEo JACOBSON2

Ko, sir.

But tlie largest gambling

place in the City of Jacksonville is the dog track, and I've
never heard —
Q

That is in the city, though?

MR. JACOBSONs

Yes, sir.

And I’ve never heard of either the president of the
board of directors there, or any employees in connection with it
being arrested under this ordinance.
The argument that the only vice to ths statute is
archiac language, this is a serious point.

It's not that the

statute or the ordinance contains language which is archaic.

If

Mr. Austin struck the archaic language, I don't know what he’
would choose to take and what, he would choose to leave.
What would he do, for example, with ''persons neglecting
all lawful business and habitually spending their time by
frequenting houses of ill fame, gaming houses, or places where
V

alcoholic beverages are sold or served, persons able to work
but habitually living upon the ' earnings of their wives or
minor children"?

. .Or of the language "habitual loafers"?
■

*7

.

Or

’’persons wandering or strolling from place, to place without any
lawful purpose or object'"?

There's nothing archaic ©bout that

languaget and it's not that the language of the ordinance is

44
archaic, it's that the thrust, the concept which the ordinance
represents that’s archaicf and is outside the boundaries of
what's considered minimal due process or minimal decency by
our current' standards.
Further, it's not simply.. and I want to make this
point as emphatically as I can, itcs not simp,!;-

mess that

we complain about? as much as that, we complain about the
extent and sweep of the statute.

Kot only is it difficult to

understand who's within it, but when somebody is determined to
foe. within it, they are subject to this recurring and constant
sort of classification? and. our basic complaint is that it's
unconstitutional to deal with these matters by status
proscriptions of the sort that are had here, even if some way
ware found to make the ordinance sufficiently definite to pass
the vagueness test.
Mr, Austin complains that the City has been brought
■\

here without any review on the facts by the Florida system, and
he says that there was no way that the Florida system could
have granted him such review.
Or the contrary, the Florida courts could have, if v
they had wanted to, go beyond the relief or the theory of what
the petitioner sought down there, the same way that this Court
did in Johnson vs. Florida, three years ago, on a similar
vagrancy case.

But the Florida, courts chose nut to,. and I

submit that the reason that they chose not to is that they are

45
BOfc opposed to it, that they approve the application of the
vagrancy concept? and the cruelest manifestation of that lr>
the way in which the Florida Supreme Court responded when this
Court’s order in the Johnson case was sent back to them.

The

peevish, grudging and sort of sarcastic and resentful language
of the Florida Supreme Court’s opinion reflects the attitude
of the Florida courts on these questions.

MR. JACOBSONs

Right.

Finally, I found myself taken aback and a little bit
aghast at two of Mr. Austin's contentions.

First, the

contention that this doesn’t make much difference because only
three people a day, about a thousand people are year, in
Jacksonville are subjected to arrest under this statute.

If

it’s unconstitutional for one person a year, it is too many.
But, regardless of that, the plain fact cf the matter is that
three people a day, more than a thousand persons a year, is an

46
horrendous number to be subjected to the sort of abase that's
handed out, and

Q

Well, X didn't understand Mr* Austin to be

arguing that it was less important because of the numbers. but
merely making the point that there u»as no wide dragnet that

was dragging in thousands of people,

l don't think he h?i;3 a

different view —*
MR. JACOBSONs

Well, X hop® ho didn41 now? X hops

he didn't,*
Q

**- in the abstract than you do*

MR* JACOBSON;

Finally, I’m taken back just as much

by his statement that the vagrancy concept is so important to
law enforcement*

That it goes to the heart of lav? enforcement.

Just two days ago this Court heard someone from the
Attorney General’s office stand here and say that these
victimless crimes are no longer regarded as necessary by Florida,
law enforcement, and are going to tea taken out in the new
revision of the Florida Criminal Code,
We’ve heard the President of the Units! States nay,
that it’s time to clo away with victimless crimes of this sort,
that they are not necessary to law enforcement.
In any ©vent, if by seme stretch they are useful, and
by some stretch they are helpful, I submit that we com© to a
poor pass when it’s contended in this Count that the law has to
foe enforced, by violating the Constitution ;•> and 2 certainly hope

4?
that this Court is sot going to lend any support to any such
contention*
Wa submit that the vagrancy ordinance that 5.8 before
the Court now is a horrible and egregious example of legislative
