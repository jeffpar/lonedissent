MR... CT1EF JUSTICE BURGER;

in Mo. '/O-.IRS, Iowa Eeef Packers against Edward Thompson.
Mr. Solicitor General.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I move that A. Raymond Randolph be authorized to

Mr. Randolph is & member of my staff, a member of the bar of

We*.11 be glad to hear from Mr.

Mr. Goldberg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS S. GOLDBERG, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
There is a motion in this case, as called by the
respondents*..

that5a called a suggestion of the writ having been

improvidentiy granted, and we have a resistance on file to
that,
I understand the rule of the Court, there is to
r,c. nu oral r,raraoni: as to that motion.

MR. CHIRP JUSTICE BORdERs The grant is limited, yes.

MR. GOLDBERG:

On the merits, if I may, at the outset

I would like to present very briefly the three central points
that petitioner believes are critical in this case»
One is that the case invitas a policy decision in the
area of labor-management relations, and we urge that the
decision of this Court in Republic Steel v. Maddox governs this
me.
Ho, 2, the substantive rights involved in this case,
as in Madder, derive simply from the contracts, the collective
bargaining agreements.

There is no such right provided for

in the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Third, that our case is not at all an attack on the
Fair Labor Standards Act»

Our contract does not diminish

rights under the Act, it enlarges rights.
Tor, the facts here are quite simple.

Iowa Beef was

and is engaged in the processing of meats and the shipment of
meat interstate, throughout the country.
'the 14 respondento, who brought 14 separate actions
ir this case, wore employed

—* and some of them still are

employed —by Icr-'a Be-.of • in' the Maintenance and Repair
1 apartment, to Peso tho machinery in operation for production.
vat

vwaoved under a collective bargaining agreement

thick is sat out in the record.

The agreement provides,

w, aw otaaa thinga, for a lunch period.

5

The respondents argue that — did argue in the court
bedew r:r:d they wore sustained by the court below on the facts,
to those facts . argue that because the machinery broke
lorn from ti.ro to tire they ware called upon to do repair work
during their lunchtime, even though they got the lunchtime
later an? or ever when they weren’t actually called upon, that
they 'wore subject to call during their lunchtime, in case there
were a breakdown.
Per those reasons, the respondents argue that there
•was a violation of the collective bargaining agreement by the
petitioner, which, then, they say, gave rise to a cause of
action under the Pair Labor Standards Act.
how, the collective bargaining agreement also
provides for grievance procedures and for arbitration in

wb.ree or fovr stops-

Instead of proceeding through the

grievance procedures, the respondents began these 14 separate
actions directly under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
The Iowa court sustained them on the merits of their,

claim, and we don't challenge that here, although wa don't
agree with the correctness of it.
.•Snt wg did challenge, by answer and by motion» the
point that these respondents should have applied or attempted
the

.rlvvp.io.; and arbitration provisions instead of proceeding

directly to court action under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
That was overruled,

and, incidentally, on the record,

6

on page 4' cf the record, plainly states that, these
respondent ,s admitted that they did not attempt to utilise

grievance ■procedures *
Q

Let’s assume in the ordinary situation under

this contract that a grievance is filed, or that an employee
has v; grievance.

Were the grievance procedures and the

arbitration provisions open to use by an employee alone?
MR. GOLDBERG:
Q

The —

Or did the union have to energise the process?

MR, GOLDBERG;

No, Your Honor.

Either the union or

the employee, the individual employee or the union could
initiate the grievance procedures.
:>

Then could an individual employee, if he was

turned down by the employer in the initial steps,request
arbitrat1on?
AR„ GOLDBERG:

Not directly, no. The union then is

directed to. undertake the further steps.
Q

So the employee could initiate a grievance

procedurei but he couldn’t take it to arbitration?
MR, GOLDBERG?
Q

Not entirely on his own, Your Honor.

Nell, "not entirely", if the union said no

arbitration» that was the end of the process, wasn't it?
MR. GOLDBERG;

No, I would say •— well, it might f

but It would-.:it terminate the employee’s ’.rights.
Q.

Vie 111 it wouldn't terminate his rights, but it

7
would terminato die rights to arbitration?
MR. GOLDBERG;■

Well, 7aca v. Sipesr of course,
l\sui.«wn« r»JfcUiW-u««aB£,r UlVfUaoKV^O

r::.gt'ires the uaiou to «zeroise proper diligence and so forth.
Q

Well, x know, but Vaca v, Sipes also says that

said that ©very time the union refuses doesn't mean that
it’s wrong.
MR. GOLDBERGs Well, that is true, Your Honor,
Q

Now, let5 s assume that a union, at the end of

the grievance procedure, refuses to take the case to arbitration.

Mow, ths employee t X suppose, has then exhausted th©

contract rights, hasn't he?
MR. GOLDBERG? That is right,
Q

And he could go to court under 301?

MR. GOLDBERGi

But, in this case, they didn't even

attempt the first step, Your Honor.
Q

They didn't even attempt to take it to grievance

MS. GCLDSSRG:

Q

That's right, Your Honor.

Mow, let’s assume that they had, and is he

entitled te represent himself, or is the union entitled to
be there at th© grievance procedure?
MR. GOLDBERG: Well, the first step plainly recites,
X believe, in the collective bargaining agreement, that the
individual employee may initiate that first step in the
grievance.
Q

Yes, hut what it says is:

"The employee

8
involved, with a Union representative if he so desires'*.

That3s

the first step, isn't it?
m, GOLDBERG;
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

But evory step after that, apparently, has to be

handled, that is Steps 2 and 3 and up to arbitration in any

event has to be handled by a union representative, doesn't it,
tin these provisions?
MR. GOLDBERG: That is right.

But these employees

and the union knew the effectiveness of these, grievance
procedures because, as the record shows, —•
Q

Well, yes, but apart from that, X gather you

rely, in, any event, on the 14 individual employees did not even
discuss the process of grievance with the immediate supervisor;
is that right?
MR. GOLDBERG; That's right.

They did not attempt

even the first step,

Q

Isn't this all very theoretical, there's no

more union ~MR, GOLDBERG:
Q

I'm sorry, I don't hear very well,

Isn't this all very theoretical, there's no

mere union, the union isn't even in the picture?
MR. GOLDBERG;

No,

That is right.

But that is three

after this case was began, and it was long after

the case had bean decided in the trial court, and the people —
Q

Yes, butt he question -~

Hit. GOLDBERG;

-- were put on notice here by our

answer and by our motion that they were required to utilise
grievance procedures, and didn’t even attempt to do so even
then.
Q

But the present posture of the case is quite

different, isn't it?
HR. GOLDBERG;

Well, I think the individual stil x ricis

the right to initiate grievance procedure, and I would think,
Your Honor, that in the absence of a union there would be no
rule of law, no court would bar him from proceeding on his own
toward the subsequent steps in the grievance procedures and in
arbitration.
Q

But, the only provision that would be required

would bo the provision in the union contract that no longer

MS. GOLDBERG:
'■‘he.

Oho

Pardon raa,

Iowa cci'.rt relisd chiefly on the. Argus-1 les case

on which its decision was opposed to us on our point about

atteaoting grievanca»
stow, these 14 separate actions were started in 1967,
five years ago,

And this is the record that they faced in

beginning these actionss

In 194? Congress enacted the Labor-Management
Relations Act5 declaring grievance procedures as a desirable
method for settling wage disputes between employer and

employee,
'fan years later, Lincoln Mills ruled that grievance
procedures were enforcible at the demand of the union- but
didn't include individual employees at that time.
In 1965e this Court ruled, in Maddox, that the
individual employees ware eligible then and could enforce
grievance procedures and arbitration.
And it8 3 on that basis that v*a present — like to
present our case.
fhe MaidoK case also stressed the comprehensiveness
and tho uniformity of law desirable under the congressional
aandate

the policies as formulated by this Court»

Maddor was not ~~ what was the claim in Maddox?

it for t rsdn&tion pay or for wrongful discharge?
tills- QQX^BB&si t

It was for severance pay- four Honor.

II
Q

Severance pay?

MR, GOLDBERG:
Q

Under the contract.,

Severance pay under the contract.

It wasn81

damages for wrongful discharge- was it?
MR. GOLDBERG;

hod the mine had been closed there

and there was no foreman, and Maddox said that therefore there
was no way to attempt the grievance procedures.

But this

Court, in Maddox, summarily overruled that contention.
Q

And of course in Maddox the only substantive

right he had to severance pay was by reason of the collective
bargaining agreement, isn’t that right?
MR. GOLDBERG:

That is right,

And we say here that

also the only substantive right involved here is lunch period
and the violation of that agreement by the employer.
Q

Well, it’s according to how you lock at this.

Here at least you do have in the background the Pair Labor
Standards Act, which gives overtime for — at pay and a half,
for anything'worked over 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week.
MR. GOLDBERG:

That’s over 40 hours a week.

Our

contract does the same, Your Honor, and they don’t get to
Fair Labor Standards Act status, under the facts of our case,
until, first, the employer has violated the contract right.
It’s the violation of that contract right, not any violation of
the Fair Labor Standards Act requirements.
r. . violation of the contract right then may trigger

12
remedial

rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act*
Q

Well, except the Fair Lator Stiuidards Act gives

more than remedia}., rights,, dcesn*t it '?

It gives substantive

rights to pay and a half over 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week
MR. GOLDBERG; That is right e Your Honor.
Q

And the

So if there were no collective bargaining

agreement here. you would concede that on the a negations of
the plaintiffs’ complaint, they have a causa of action under
the Pair Labor Standards Act,
MR. GOLDBERGi
Q .

Wouldn’t that ba true?

That would be true.

And by contrast, in the Maddox case, if there

hud been, no collective bargaining agreement there could have
c.-m. no cause of action? isn’t that also true?
MR. GOLDBERG;

No, the — there’s this difference,

though, Mr. Justice, that the Fair Labor Standards Act dees
vot require the granting of lunchtime.
Q

1 understand that.

MS. GOLDBERG?

We could have provided for eight

hours* consecutive work without lunchtime.

We’d never have had

thi s p rob 1 am.
Q

Yes.

MR. GOLDBERG: But we did agree to give lunchtime,
We violated Jhat agreement.

So we have a right, purely a

con t r a c t t i g h a, and ?. violation of that contract right that
fcb ij i i rige »rs remedial processes,

And we say this, that the

13
arbitrator ? under the arbitration requirements and under the
decisions, is bound to follow the lav;.

So that t he arbitrator

would have to apply all the ravaedial provisions of the Fair
Labor Standards Act»
And 1 believe that Mr» Justice White, in the
dissenting — in the opinion for four Justices of this Court in
the Argue!les case* emphasized that point, that the arbitrator
could apply all the remedial remedies. And we have four
decisions of the United States Circuit Courts cf Appeals in
Fair Labor Standards Act cases, which they said that arbitration
must be

must precede any court action.
Q

In this case, in this case, Mr. Goldberq,

suppose you were to pi revail, then the employees would have to
go fo&eJc under a grievance procedure under the contract, is that
right?
MR, GOLDBERG:
Q

Probably —

Or would they go directly into arbitration?

MR. GOLDBERG: Well, possibly, Your Honor, under the
Maddox decision, there was just a reversal of the case below.
What happens after that, I don’t know.

What would haopen here

after a — it this Court were to reverse, I don't know, either.
We5 d 'have to leave that to the development of circumstances
under the law.
Q

Well, the first step of the grievance procedure

rr.:.r-vrU>;d. in the contract doesn't set a time limit on grieving.

14
doss it?
MR. GOLDBSRG?

Pardon?

I didn't hear the last,

'm

sorry.
Q

The first step of the grievance procedure pro­

vided for in the contract doesn't set a time limit on
discussing the matter with the foreman or the supervisor?
MR. GOLDBERG:

No, I think not.

There are time

limits on the various —
Q

After that.

ME4 GOLDBERG;
Q

After that there are time limits?
Yes, that's —

On the future steps?

MR. GOLDBERG:, That is right.

And the arbitrator,

he'll toa required to apply all the remedial provisions of the
Standards Acts

the statute of limitation provision? the

penalty provisions for liquidated damages and costs.
As a matter of fact, I'm not at all sure that this
case involves the liquidated damages provision, because there
were no liquidated damages allowed by the court below.
It may well be — well, now, as Mr. Justice Harlan,

in his special concurrence in the Arguelies case, the seaman's
Gc, is very much unlike this because there we had 'a special
statute in which the distinctive doctrines that have been
applied to seamen traditionally since 1790 by the Congress and
by th? court*, the seaman{s case, the Arguelies case applied
to that doctrine, to that vary special statute.

i\nc that

15
statuta made no provision, either,for administrative enforce­
ment ; whereas, tnde-r the Fair Labor Standards Act, the bulb
of the enforcement, as shorn by the reports of the administrato
himself, cited ir. one of the footnotes to the original brief
in this case, indicates that very few actions are brought by
employees, and most of those that are brought by employees are
brought by employees who came after >— who have already ceased
being in the employ of the employer.
So that Mr-. Justice Harlan indicated, plainly, that
i : was his clear understanding that the case of U, S♦ Bulk
Carriers v. Arguelles did not decide simply because — that
there was a statute, that that made all the difference.

The

point was to examine the precise nature of that statute and
see, than, which of the policies, arbitration on the one hand
or direct action on the other, under the statute should apply.
And we respectfully submit here that our statute,
the Fair Labor Standards Act statute, is not the type of
statute that would come within the sweep of the seaman * s case ,
under the Arcmellas doctrine.

Quite the contrary.

We have indicated in our brief that the Fair Labor
Standards Act is not unqualified, and it is not all-inclusive.
Thera we list in our ~~ indicate in our brief at least 37
exceptions under one section of the Act,- and others under other
oeotiocs, so that it ■'c not the policy of the Congress to make
that Act exclusive.

16
And the four cases in the 0« S„ Courts of Appeals?
in Fair Labor Standards Act cases, indicate very plainly tliet
gs# that I think are relevant here;

one# that the

Fair Labor Standards Act does not require a court action? its
just says court action may be brought; and? secondly * that the
arbitrators arc bound to apply the law, apply all provisions
of the Fair Labor Standards Act, in reaching a decision in
arbitration<
I believe that's pointed out? too, in Wilko v. Swan
and Mr, Justice White in the Argnelles case»
«w^MimaM/^'juvwru

I'd like to say this# if I may, Your Honors, that
the briefs of the respondents on the merits and the brief of th
amicus — the amicus brief were delivered to us only — one of
thorn seven days, the other one only five working days before
this day of argument, so we've had no opportunity to file a
reply brief.

We did file a very short reply brief in the

original proceedings for the writ, and I would beg the Court,
if I may# to regard that- reply brief as something of a reply
CO th,e briefs here on the merits«
And I think they are reasonably adequate for that.
purpose»
Among the many differences between the statute in the
Argus!lass case and the statute under the Fair Labor Standards
Act ore thos: i

that the Fair Labor Standards Act makes

provision for enforcement largely by the administrator, and tha

The adm5.nistrafcor can administratively

require payment of wages.

He may also bring court actions to

require the payment ct: wages«

And there • s provision for

injunction by the administrator and also for criminal pro­
ceedings.
I do hope to make it very clear to the Court that
no steps, not even the first step was taken here by the
employees to use grievance procedures.

And the respondents

have admitted on the record -« this is on page 4 of the
record, beginning at line 25

they have expressly admitted

that no steps permitted under the grievance procedures,
provided by those agreements, were taken by the plaintiffs
below, the respondents here.
It6s a rather —

Thera is a footnote in the respondents—

Well, what, then, had the grievance procedure

arbitration if it hadn't been settled?

What would the

Precisely the thing that the court

One. did the contract provide for a lunch

Second, was the lunch period actually furnished?

Was there violation of that contract right?
Q

Well, if that’s so, then, there is a matter cf

construction of application of the contract involved.

There

is an issue for arbitration of the construction and applica­
tion of the contract.
MR. GOLDBERG:
substantive

Q.

Oh, definitely.

I think the entire

right-. depends on the contract.
You just answered Mr. Justice Douglas that

there wasn’t anything.
MR. GOLDBERG; Well, I guess I didn’t understand 'the
purport of the question then.

But we admit, we admit that the

right was given and that, we admit, so far as the record goes,
that xm violated that right, which :Le a substantive contract
right.
Q

Well, does it come down to what is overtime

under the statute?

MR . GOLD
Your Honor,

The ovsrtima under the contract, too.

The contract provided for overtime not only after

•10 hours but also after 8 hours in any one day»
Q

Both use the word "overtime0, is that right?

MR, GOLDBERG:

Oh, yes, Your Honor.

So that a violation of the contract right automatical ,
under the contract, would give them the right to overtime pay„
Q

Do you claim any practice or custom in this

industry that employees should be on call during their lunch
hour?
MR, GOLDBERG:

No, X think not.

These employees were

on call, as a matter of fact? there's no denial of that,

And

it's on that basis that the court below ruled that we violated
the contract, and didn't pay for the overtime involved in
eating*
Even though lunchtime was provided later in the day,
but they were still subject to call there. So that under the
decisions, clearly, we didn’t furnish lunchtime and we should
pay for time and a half during the lunchtime period.
And it's only the violation of that contract right
that triggers the remedial rights under the Fair Labor
Standards let? and they have the same rights under the contract

Well, if you admitted the right ana the violation
c£ tie right, why didn't you just pay them?

arbitrator your opposition to the claim? you would have wanted
to say that you didn’t violate the right?

yon couldn’t introduce in a Pair Labor Standards Act case?

it would have been pretty much the same

evidence?

sxtaattons»
You don't get a jury trial before the

MLR. GOLDBERG?

ORAL ; OdvXIOiT OF A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH, JR., ESQ„,
OH BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. RANDOLPH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I think it's important to get the precise

nature

of the employees' claim in this case into proper focus right*
at the outset.

The employees have never claimed throughout •

these entire proceedings that their employer violated the
collective bargaining agreement.
Their complaint, which is set out on pages A-2 to
A-4 of the Appendix,is related solely tc their rights under the
Fair Labor Standards Act.

They obviously are not seeking a

work-free lunch period for time between. 3.365 and 1967.
time has passed.

That

A work-free lunch period, even if the

employer said, "Yes, you are entitled to it", would not help
them at all.
What they axe seeking is simply wages that they
■claim ware due under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Q

Well, this is a straight — from your point of

22

view it's AAs straight excess of 8 hours and 40 hours, isn't

J5R. RMsDOLPH: The Fair Labor Standards Act only
provides overtime compensation for over 40 hours in the workwees
They claim they worked within the meaning of the
Fair Labor Standards Act for over 40 hours in a workweek,
because they ®rs on call for this 30-minute period each day,
icid.

that they were entitled to pay, and that the employer

violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by s-.ot paying them.
It’s a. standard Fair Labor Standards Act claim.
The point is that even if the contract in this case
said that employees ware not entitled to pay,for on-call time,
that would foe irrelevant, because it’s been held by this Court,
in the throe-decade period after enactment of the Fair Labor
Standards Act, that unions can’t bargain away employees’ rights
under the Act.

Tha .act was set up to create a uniform standard

throughout the country, that’s not to vary from industry to
industry or from employer to employer.
Q

Do you — docs the government challenge the

arbitrability of the matter under the contract?

The government does not challenge that

MR. RhiFDOL’PH s The government will assume that the

Q

Then what5 s the reason for not remitting the

matter to arbitration in the government's view?
ME. RANDOLPH;
reasons»

Well, I think there arc- many, many

1 think chat examining those reasons has to begin wit*

examination of the statute itself,
As I said, these employees sued solely under the Fair
Labor Standards Act, They sued under Sectionl6(b) of the Act,
which is set out in respondents5 brief on page A-2.
Under Section 16(b) an employee is entitled to sue,
and I quote, "in any court of competent jurisdiction, to
recover minimum wages or overtime compensation withheld in
violation of the Act.°
Also under Section 16(b). an employee is entitled to
liquidated damages, in an, equal amount to the wages that were
unlawfully withheld, unless — unless the employer "shows to
the satisfaction of the court that he acted in good faith and
did: not — and had reasonable grounds for violating the Act.”

In

that situation, and 1 quote again,"the court may,

in it? some discretion, order a lesser amount of liquidated
damages.

The government contends that all these are matters
y *ra quite important to enforcement of the
Act, and the forusa where the rights are to he enforced is tied
up with the very rights and remedies of the act.

It’s an

integral part of the statutory structure,.
Indeed f Section 16(b) itself speaks of "the right to
bring an action", and we think that when Congress said
employees have a right to bring an action, they meant just
that; they didn't mean that employees have a right to bring an
action utlem they4 re governed by a collective bargaining
agreement, in which case they have to go through arbitration or
grievance processes first.

Vie think examination, close examination of all these
provisions in the Act, particularly in light of their legis­
lative history, leads to this conclusion.
First of all, let's look at liquidated damages.
Arbitrators, as this Court has pointed out in the
Steelyrrkrrc trilogies, are confined to interpretation of the
collectiva bargaining agreement.

Suppose the Court

Well, even if he could, the point

is that Congress said the court should decide; it said court,
judicial discretion, which is guided by sound legal principles,
io to be exercised in determining whether liquidated damages
should be given.
More important, I've been assuming that the case goes
to arbitration.

But under this collective bargaining agreement,

which is quite typical, after the very first step the union
has control over the grievance.
the point is that the grievance may well be settled
along the way before it reaches arbitration.

Indeed, this

Court has pointed out on many occasions that this is the
preferable way of handling disputes, to get them settled.
Because the grievance process itself is considered part of
c; o 1 le at iv e bxz g a i n i ng ag reams nta.
V ho only trouble is that it's absolutely clear under
che 2&xr faner Standa rds hat that the minimum rates are not to
be thrown on the bargaining table so that the union and
.vh. , j;

bargala over them.

This is something that Congress

26

gaV'v: the employees«.

It !s a minimum standard,, and. it’s not to

be re luced even upon agreement by the employer and the union.
Indeed, in the Schulte case»- which was decided back
in the 1540‘s, and which we discuss in our brief on pages 16 an
17, this Court held that even an individual employee entering
into & settlement, a bona fide settlement agreement over a
claim with his employer, could not fce held to have waived his
right tc liquidated damages.

Still less could a union do it

for him.
Also, the Act, as 2 said before, provides that
employees —

Well, that wouldn’t necessarily prevent admissio
It’s like the NLRB, deferring to arbitration

and they aren't bound by it.

Q

Do you think Congress put any limitations on

the right of these» men, these claimants, to settle fche.tr claim

desrectly with the employer after it had been asserted, either
before or after the pendancy of the lawsuit?

28
MR, RANDOLPH;

Well, this Ccrurt has held that when

there'* b a dispute between the. employer and the anion —« this
is the Schulte case , and involves a question of whether tile Act
in fact covers them — that the only time the employee can be
bound to a settlement agreonent is if the settlement agreement
is upon a stipulated judgment? that settlements outside of
court will not foe upheld.
Well, let’s assume — let's assume that they go

by a stipulation for judgment, do you think your position puts
any barriers in the way of having these matters disposed of
w1thout 11tigation?
HR. RANDOLPH:
Q

Oh, .no, not at all.

You certainly would agree that it's better that

these cases be settled rather than triad.
MR. RANDOLPH;

It's certainly better that the

employer would comply from the outside as — I guess the next
rest thing is that he would comply as scon as the employee
complains.
I certainly would hope that if the employee does

point out the violation, he would comply.

Q

We're not talking about compliance now, that

means giving a hundred cents on the dollar of the total claim,
X m talking about compromise settlement.

Z'o you think therec s any

that the government

otiyene hi. a any interest in putting barriers in the way of
compromiso. a ttlaments of sina 11 cl aims?
ML. •f.'tDOiPH
Thu. reason is this

2

Yes, I think the government does.
that if the employee and the employer

get together and settle a claim for less than the amount that
was due, that gives the employer an advantage over his competi­
tors, who are bound to the minimum standards of the Act.
Suppose, for an example, an individual employee was
only paying hio employees a dollar an hour when he*a supposed
to fee paying them a dollar sixty?
:oyy\

Employees came to him and

“You're violating the fair Labor Standards Act, please

pay us the smiount we're due.**

And they compromise on a dollar

thirty an hour.
Well, that gives the employer an advantage.

And it

also gives the employer who can bargain the hardest with hi©
employees the advantage of getting that increase.

I think

it*« absolutely clear that Congress never intended that.

They

wanted uniform application.
These Ci re the reasons that led the court in the
Schulte case and, indeed, in. the Brooklyn Bank case back in

1943, to hold that settlement agreements were not valid, that
employees could not be bound by them, that they can come into
court and get more.

Q

Mr. Randolphf are you saying that if, after all

30

of the facts

have transpired, and the employees assert a claim

for unpaid wages under the Act, and there * s a fairly debatable
or arguable point, those employees, even if they have advice of
counsel, c .. ct settle with the employer short of fighting it
out in court?
MR, RANDOLPH:

No, X said they car; settle, but I

think the government has an interest in making sure that they
■jet exactly what they*re entitled to under the Act,
But the question whether they can settle over a bona
fide dispute involving the number of hours they should be paid
has never been before this Court,
I don't think it's essential to this case,

I mean,

I think there are many other things under the Act that
indicate that Congress could not have intended them to go
through the grievance process.
For example, the limitations on actions point.
Congress gave these employees two years within which to sue.
Before 1947, State law controlled the statute of limitations.
There were divergent views.

And Congress found in 1947 that

this lack of uniformity had created an undesirable situation
in the United -States.

They therefore set a two-year federal

standard.
%'h
out . - uc.n -

point is they did this not only to get uniformity
they believed employees might not generally know

their rig; hr under the Act, and needed-that long a period of

31
time within which to bring their suit„
Suppose you accept the employer’s claim in this
ease, teat employees are barred from const because they did no
invoke grievance procedures whan they were available?
Well, this would bring about even greater lack of uniformity,
and that*© precisely what Congress legislated against.
X take it that that would mean when the grievance
process was available, they'd be bound by the terms of the
grievance process, which may set its own time limits on when
they could bring the' grievance.
In this ease it sets a ten-day limit.
Mr. Justice White, you asked my colleague here
whether there is any limit on the first step.

As I read the

contract, which is set out on A-23 of the Appendix, it says
yes, ten days.
Q

Where?

Where?

MR, RANDOLPHs

"In the event he does not receive a

satisfactory answer—
Q

Well, that’s the — that isn't the first step.

MR. RANDOLPH?

— “he shall within tan days" —

Q

Wait a minute,,

Q

That isn't the first step.

The first step is

that he has to go. either with or without a union representa­
tive, to his immediate supervisor,
XXX, R&WPOLPH? Well, it's titled Step I in the con-

32
tract, that's what I was referring to»
Q

Yes.

But they didn't even go through that

step hare*
MR. RANDOLPH*

No,

But I think that •—the way X

ro5& it; it says he shaliswbmlt within ten days of knowledge
of the incident.

That certainly means the incident he’s

complaining about.
So after he goes- * to his employer and says e "Look,
you4re doing something wrong under the contractf" then, within

ten days he has to file a written grievance.
Q

And you write out of that sentence, "in the

event he does not receive a satisfactory answer"?
MR. RANDOLPH;

Q

Yes.

You write that out?

MR. RANDOLPH;

No, I don't write that out.

If he

does receive a satisfactory answer, of course, there's no
reason for him to file a written grievance,
But the point is that all collective bargaining
agreements set their own time limits, and that's precisely the
contrary of what Congress wanted.

They wanted a uniform

standard throughout the country, and they didn't want ten
days or 15 days or a year, they wanted two years.
So, a further indication, and 1 think this is quite
important, is that before 1S47 unions could bring actions on
behalf of their own employees.

But in 1947 Congress, under

33

Section 16(b), delated the provision allowing representative
actions,

So that now 16(b) reads that only the employee

himself controls and prosecutes his own action.
Compare that to the grievance process.
the opposite of what Congress said.

It*s precisel

Because in the grievance

processt beyond the very first step where the employee sets
down his written grievance, it's the union that controls the
prosecution of the claims.

That's directly contrary to what

Congress legislated in 1947.
Still further, and I think X have been talking
about this already, the point is that the maximum hours
provision is concerned more with — than with simply helping
the individual — this is the important part — helping the
individual employee bear the burden of having to work over
-50 hours.

It‘s concerned with more than that, because one of

the reasons that Congress set down a limit on maximum hours
is to-spread employment throughout the country by exerting
pressure on employers to hire more people rather than working
the people they have on overtime.
Also, since the minimum standards apply throughout
the country, they have to be applied uniformly.

If they’re

not, one employer gains an advantage over his competitors.
Congress could not possibly have thought that they
could realise — that these goals could be realized through
the grievance process or even through arbitration.

The claims

34
are settled by the union and the*employer along the way, the
lack of uni fortuity is quite obvious.

as in a judicial trial.

Their record is not as complete

There is very limited judicial

review of what they’ve held.

So all these factors are quite important, if you’re
going to have uniform interpretation of what is in fact an
important federal enactment that applies to people throughout
the country.
In addition, finally, Congress, in Section 16(c) and
in Section 1? of the Act, said the Secretary of Labor can
enforce it even when the employee himself is unwilling or unable
to bring the action.
. Now, we think that if the Secretary has direct
access to the court, it makes little sense to say that employees
don't, that they have to go through the grievance process,
where the Secretary can bring an action directly in court, and
that the employees —

The statute doesn't say that.

whether the arbitrator can award liquidated damages.
Q

ME. RANDOLPHS But I'm talking about the remedies
that, he gives after he makes that determination, whether they*
governed by the contract or not, it’s doubtful, at best.
And the point is that this is supposed to be uniform
throughout the country and it shouldn't turn on what the
contract says.
Moreover, in the Republic Steel case, this Court's
decision in the Republic Steel case is quite distinguishable
from here, because Republic Steel dealt only with the question
of contract interpretation.
The point is that neither Congress nor this Court
has ever said that, grievance proceedings in a labor contract
are the preferred method of vindicating an employee's
statutory rights independent of the contract.

■3 RaL AR GuMEMT OF RAYMOND EDWARD FRANCK , ESQ.,
03 BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
os, ERAHCKj

Mr. Chief Justice, ar 1 may it please

the Courts
X am the attorney representing the respondents in
this case.

We are in full agreement with the lav; as expressed

by the government, as a general law.
But we must return to the facts of the instant case
to determine just what the rights of the respondents were»
If.we will refer to the contract which was entered
into by the union and management, the first thing we must
realise is that this is not a contract in any way like the
contract in Bulk Carriers.
The contract in Bulk Carriers provided something to
the effect that the arbitrators had the power to settle any and
all disputes between the employees and the employer.
Vi a must return to the individual contract in this

case.
In the Steelworker cases, and especially the Wheel
case and also in the Warrior & Gulf case, the Court held that
the arbitrator's power came from the contract.

That is why we

must refer to this individual contract that I have before me,
•which is set out in the Appendix.
Tho first thing it does, it defines,by its terms,
what a grievance is

A grievance pertains to the violation

1

of the agreement,

Kc reference to any and all problems between

employer anti employee.

No reference to any federal statutes.

Just a direct reference to this contract.
Secondly, in Section 2 on page 30 the power of the
arbitrator is specifically set out. •’His decision in the
grievance shall be final and binding on the parties, provided
he shall not have authority other than to apply the terms and
conditions specifically set forth in this contract.“
So, let us refer back to our instant case again.
At no point did any of the 14 respondents claim that they
didn’t get a meal break.

No place in their petition, no

place in their reply, no place in the trial of the lawsuit>
•The respondents admit they got their meal break.
*

Under the facts in this case, the contract provides that they’re
entitled to a meal break.

Xt doesn’t provide the length of the

meal break, whether it*3 five minutes or whether it’s an hour.
Now, there isn't any question that the employees got
their meal break.

Under the facts in this case, if they, -**•

five hours after they reported for work, they were on their
meal break, in a special cafeteria set aside, net the general
cafeteria where the other laborers worked, but only the
maintenance men were permitted to use this special cafeteria.
then the-bell rang for a breakdown, if that was during
their lunch period, they left their lunch period, fixed the
break, end came back and they were given their lunch period.

42
So we're not complaining about the fact that we
didn't get a lunch period.

What we5re complaining about is

that we never got paid, under the Fair tabor Standards Act,
for the on-call time.
Q

Mr* Franck„

MR. FRANCK:
Q

Yes?

Au 1 read the majority opinion of the Supreme

Court of lows, in the Appendix at page 17, Judge Uhlenhopp says
that "The present controversy is undoubtedly arbitrable."
Would you concede that the Supreme Court of Iowa at least
resolved this point against you?
MR

FRANCK:

Yes. I would? bat I don't agree with

the Supreme Court of Iowa.
I think we've got to consider that this is a
different case, a much stronger case than either the McKinney
case versus a railroad, or Republie Steel„ or even the case
of Bulk Carriers.
When we look at the McKinney case, we have a remedy,
based upon a contract,

The same is true in Bulk Carriers.

When we oo to the case of Republic Steel, we there have a
contract right; but here we have a statutory right and a
statutory remedy, which the respondents went in court and
requested it. be enforced against the employer.
, insofar as they will admit, and they do admit
in. their brief- that before you can come under the terms of

Artio!3 VII of the contract, yon must

hour

first, establish whether or not tbs mealtimes were subject to
be paid because they wore on call.

There is nothing in this

contract about on-call.
And then if we proceed to the next step- it seems
apparent to me that the government intended that the Fair
Labor Standards Act should be treated differently than other
union regulations, because of this two-year statute of
limitations.
Hew, it appears to me that the union fails in this,
and they take over the matter, and they do not comply with
their statute of limitations, which says, "in the event he
does not receive a satisfactory answer, he shall within ten
days of the knowledge of the incident", not of the discussion
with his employer, "within knowledge of the incident"? he is ,
barred unless he starts his errievance procedure*
'

>

This is going to create a tremendous hardship on
the employees who are represented by the union and give a
great advantage to a person who works in a non-union shop.
For this reasons

under the Act, it provides, the Portal-to-

5'orta.l Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act, that, Ho, 1,
each workweek is a separate incident or a separate cause of
action.
How, if vre proceed, then, to the Portal-to-Portal
Acu, where.- we have the two-year statute of limitations, and a

44
recent amendment to three years, we find that we are penalising
someone who is working in a union «hop? taking away rights
that a man in a non-union shop would have.

And for this

reason we foal that those people should he permitted, No. 1,
irregardlest of any other rule„ that Maddox does not apply
her«, because we do not have the type of contract that would
permit arbitration by its vary terms.
Secondly, in the Bulk Carriers-; case, and the dissent
therein does not apply because Bulk Carriers have this very
wide contractual agreement which said, in effect,, we’re going
to let them arbitrate or settle any problem between an
employer and an employee.
Now, if the Court should decide that this was true
in this case? then there wouldn't be any reason why you
couldn’t require a man who is hurt in the plant, under a State
law, to arbitrate workmen’s compensation.
That is a statutory right.
So I feel that the Supreme. Court of Iowa should be
affirmed, that there isn’t any statutory or congressional
intent which would obviate that reason.

1 would also like to point out that the union
contract is not of existence.

Their union itself is not in

There is nc way for these people to obtain a

never went beyond

,

It

into any formal situation.

The record is not clear as to whether payment was

v -xie or whether it v/asn81 made.

There are statements on both

sides.
However, we must remember that that was a grievance y
according to the record, on a failur e to have a lunch period,
not an on-call lunch period.
And to show the problem that arose:

After these

suits were filed, and a letter was sent out from the company,
■which is & part of the record, instructing these people to use
their grievance procedure and not to answer the bell if it
rang, when they refused to answer the bell the foreman said
to them, "Well, you answer that ball? don't pay any attention
to what. these people say upstairs.

They don't know what's

going on down here,B
3o I think that any attempt to make them do this
would have been futile.
iof therefore, I respectfully urge the Court to
affirm the Supreme Court of the State of Iowa.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LOOTS S. GOLDBERG, ESQ.,
OH BEEALT OF THE PETITIONER
ME,, GOLDBERG;

Mr. Chief Justice, and -may it please

the Court s

The arnicas brief relies most largely for its position
on the Brooklyn Savings Bank case.

As we point out on page 22

of our brief, the Court there said that the Fair Labor Standard.

hot was designed to protect certain groups of the population
from substandard wages due to the unequal bargaining power as
between employer and employee.
We don't have that unequal bargaining power here,
and that5 r. the reason for distinguishing collective bargaining

0

Wall, what*s your answer to the assertion that

the collective bargaining contract.itself did not specifically
give the arbitrator the power to hear a statutory, as compared
with a contractual, claim?
MR. GOLDBERG; Well, Mr. Justice White, our under­
standing is that the operation of the law is just the other
way; that under the — well, in the opinion in Maddox and in
the opinions in the Steelworkers cases, the rule seems to be,
as v;e understand it, laid down that arbitration does apply
unless there is an express exclusion of some subject matter
in the contract.
j

Tell, this provision says that arbitration is

47

limited to the construction and application of the contract.
And if a claim is assarted based on a statute, independent of
any contract, whet business has the arbitrator got in there?
MR. GOLDBERGs

X think that very point was made, Mr.

Justice,, in the Bccklev case in the Ninth Circuit, and it
was rejected for the reason that that becomes just a matter of
semantics.

The basis of the claim there as here was a violatior

of the contract, an agreement to give a lunch period, and a
failure to give if because of the on-call provision.

How, the — that triggers entry into the remedial
provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, but it doesn't
provide the basic right; and that was argued unsuccessfully

by the parties in the Beckley case, and decided our way.
