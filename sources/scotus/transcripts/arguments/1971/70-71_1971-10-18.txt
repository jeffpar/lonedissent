ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER A. PAULEY» ESQ.»
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PAULEYs

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice; and may

it please the Court:
This is a criminal case involving the construction
and constitutionality of a federal gun control statute»
enacted in June of 1068.

The case is her® on writ of

certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit»
which reversed a judgment of conviction under the pertinent
statutes, which are codified in Title 18» United States Code
Appendix» Sections 1201 and 1202.
In view of the issues, I would like to briefly
sketch the provisions of these statutes before stating the
underlying facts.
They Appear at pages 2 to 3 of our brief.

In

Section 1201» the Congress makes various formal bindings, to
the effect that the receipt, possession, or transportation of
a firearm by enumerated classes of persons, including convicted
felons, constitutes Ba burden on commerce or threat affecting
the free flow of commerce? a threat to the safety of the
President and Vic® President ©f the United Statas? an impediment

4
or threat to the exercise of free speech or religion? and a
threat to the continued and effective operation ©f the
Government of th© United State® and of the States.B
Section 1203(a) then defines certain crimes,
including fell© one of which respondent here was convicted.
It provides, and I quote in pertinent parts
®Any parson who has been convicted by a court of th®
United States or of a State or any political subdivision
thereof ©f a felony, and who receives, possesses, or trans­
ports in commarce or affecting commerce, after the date of
eaaetavsnt of this Act, any firearm" shall be guilty of a
federal crime.
The facts of this case ar© 'as follows:

& federal undercover agent went fees respondent's
apartment in th® Bronx, in the latter part of July 1969, to
buy narcotics.

Respondent let him in and directed him down­

stairs , where he made a narcotics purchase from an unknown
individual*
The next day the same agent returned with a radio to
exchange for narcotics, and, one© again, respondent opened
pendent was holding an automatic
pistol in his hand, which he explained he did a® a precaution
because of the large number of burglaries in th® area.
th© two men then consummated a transaction in which
the agent purchased seven bags of heroin from respondent in

5
■r-.xoh, .ng©

the radio, o,o.& ©hs agent: loft,
E© obtained an arrest warrant for respondent and a

.gie&reh warrant for hie apartment and went back on th® next
day.

Shortly after he was admitted on this occasion other

agents, who had remained outside, entered th© premises,
arrested respondent and searched the apartment pursuant to th®
warrant,
They found the automatic pistol hidden under ©
bathtub, and a sawed-off shotgun lying near respondent's
bed.
.Respondent was charged as a previously convicted
.Uels>r*„ u&der Section 1202(a), in two counts:

with possession

of th© automatic pistol and of the sawed-off shotgun; and he
was further charged in a count with carrying a firearm during
■Sl?.vis commission of a federal felony.
The jury acquitted respondent of that count, which
thus is not her® now; but found him guilty under the two
Section 1202(a) counts.
It was stipulated at trial that respondent had been
convicted in th© courts of th© State of Hew York of the felony
of attempted grand larceny in the second degree.
Respond* v*t interposed no factual defense before th©
j rry

>m Section 1202(a) charges,

But following th© verdict

to cwi.de a motion for judgment of acquittal, contending that
the government had failed to either prove or to allege what he

6
contended was an essential element of th© of fans®# namely, that
his possession of the firearm shown to have bean in or to have
effected interstat® commerce.
Th© district judge denied tills motion in an opinion
&et forth at pages 55 to 59 of th© Appendix, holding that, th©
statute properly construed did not require proof of any such
element and that, as so construed, it was constitutional both
raider the commerce clause and as a rational exercise of
Congress9 power to safeguard th© security of the President and
Vic© President»
On appeal, th© Court of Appeals reversed, essentially
adopting respondent’s contantion as to how the statute should
ba construed»
Four Courts of Appeals, the Fourth, Sixth, Eighth,
and Ninth Circuits, have held to the contrary and in accordance
with th© views of th© district court in this case, that the
statute does not require proof of an interstate commerce
element with respect t© a convicted felon's possession of a
firearm.
Because of that conflict, w© sought review by this
Court, and this Court granted certiorari last term.
There are essentially two problemss

th© first is

whether the statute should be construed to eliminate the
necessity for the government to prove in an individual case
that a convicted felon's possesion of firearm had been in or

7
i feats
.v ,/

.

'■

ptrsdsndble ©Korciso of Congress- powers.
obo problem is; construing fehs ©t&ttla arises from

the inclusion of tfc© words ra“- and I one® again invita the
Court's attention fe© pagas 2 to 3 ©£ our brief, where the
statuta is safe forth “«* inclusion ©£ the words "An commerce
or effecting ca®»rceB following the verb “transports*’ in
Section 1202(a).
The court below, looking at this ~~
Q

You mean is this an issue that whatever

Congress constitutionally might have don® in this area, its
etcituta requires as an element of the offense proof of
scRfisfehip.q' Ln commerce ©r affecting commerce? and your argument

is

all that it requires in that regard is proof in cases of

indictment for transporting but not for receiving or
possessing?

Is that it?

MR, PAUhEYs

Yes, Your Honor.

Essentially we

think that, that —
r

q

Well, what I’m trying to get at is?

is there

any constitutional question hare?
MR. PAULEY3

There is a constitutional question,

assuming that you were fe© hold that the Court of Appeals was
wrong, as w© contend it was, in applying the “in commerce or
affecting .comaerc©* language to the receipt and possession
hrsichqs of the statute, you would than have to reach,as four

8
Courts of Appeals have done, the constitutional question of
a statute which eliminates the necessity for proof,
;j . i' , , indivi -iv;--1. case of say such affect, is* within Congress *
powers undc;r the Constitution.
q

Well, didn't w© deal with something like this

in fch© Peres case last term?
MR. PAULEYs

That is correct. Your Honor.

And the

decision below cams before this Court's Peres decision, and it
was written by the judge who had dissented in the Court, of
Appeals .from the affirmance of the conviction in Perez, Judge
Hays.
But I would first like to address myself to the
?f tiie statute
sh ould be.
q

Just further in the pursuance of my brother

Drer:nan's qvrf&ion, you are in agreement here that after the
p(-.tx$iz ■: as3 lent term there was no serious constitutional
question?
That is correct. Your Honor.
Q

Certainly in the Court of Appeals for the

Second Circuit, their construction of the statute was reflected
A

as to any doubt that the constitutionality’was of different
constructioni didn't it?
MS. PAULEYs

Or the constitutionality of —

Yes, it did, Your Honor.

This was —

they did not hold that the statute would be unconstitutional,

9
if o

. ■- ,:i

in

tJ ■ manner. we urged, but they did say that

it; would rcJ.3# *:• seris-113 cons fcitutionftl question, and that —
o

Ho d: ubfc that was part of the motivation for

thorn' v, •; construe the statute as they did»
HE. PAULEY %
q

That is — .

&3 I understand, they or© explicit right there.

MK. PAULEY £

That is correct.

W® will argue at the

appropriate time that not even serious constitutional doubts
in our view wer® raised by this statute, because, as the
Peres opinion indicated -~
q

You don't think on© dissent is enough to raise

substantial constitutional doubt, do you?
MR, PAULEYt

I realise you dissented in that case,

Your honor.? but ~£:<•. nughter. 3
— but as the opinion indicated, the court purported,
the Eighth, to fo© following a long line of cases

•ms,.;-Hting 'Jrtra lifted Sfeates__v« Darby, 312 U.S., and with
respect to statutes constructed in similar fashion as this
©no, v?kere Congrass male®© findings, and then he eliminates
on the basis of them tha necessity for proof in an individual
case, that a particular transaction has affected commerce.
So we think that on the basis of the prior
precedents, the Second Circuit erred in this case, even in
holding that a serious constitutional doubt was ~~

10

:e t whafc I’m talking about, t&’&t brings ns bade
to what X caked you earlier.

You axe arguing# then# that there

arc. no constitutional doubts that "in 'commerce or affecting

vm

c

'

MR. PAULEY:■

1

YThat is correct.

We’re arguing that

•the statute is —
Q

That*s right.

MR. PAULEYs
q

— constitutional.

And that the Second Circuit was wrong in

suggesting that without that modification it would be
cons fci tutional"?
MR. PAULEYs

That’s correct# and in addition I should

say we think there are limits to the doctrine that statutes
should be construed to ©void constitutiora1 doubts, and that
the 1

islctiva history end other features of this statute

.sake z:, -plication of that doctrine by the Court of Appeals
yy ;y

:)jro- Y- late hare, «wen vrara there constitutional doubts..
The Second Circuit reasoned# looking at the text of

Section 1202(a) alone# that sine© the words "in commerce or
affecting cormerce" should be giv©n soma substantive content#
that sine© it seemed to be clear that they applied to the
transportation s&nse# that logic compelled their application
also to the receipt and possession .branches of the statute#
sine® it would have mad© no sens® for Congress to distinguish,
in terms of elements ©£ the crime between receipt and possession

11
of a firearm by & convicted f-s.len on the on© hand, and trans-*
p»rtafcion of a firearm on the other, particularly since
transportation would seam, of necessity, to encompass a convietod felon*a possession of & firearm.
t*ow, -this argument has a certain plausibility,

:',%t!.x>;-vs;h 11

uofc accord with the grassr of th© section,

chen e. ly the word* of 1202(a) ©re looked at.

But we submit

that by cci- .fining its attention to the words of Section 1202(a)
alone the court below neglected to consider several other
indicia of congressional intent, which far outweigh the force
of this argument.
In fch© first place, the court below neglected to
take into account th@ implication to be drawn from Congress8
inclusion of fch© formal findings in Section 1201,

There the

Congress found that the receipt, possession, or transportation
of a firearm by felons constituted a burden on interstate and
foreign cois®rce•
lv',q;K

It would have been an irrational act fox

so to find were its intent merely to follow such a

'"indite by too 3naafc:m\t of the statute which included, as an
olerasno, in the individual prosecution
Q

Well, why is it — that raises the question,

then, why did they put in the modifier at all?
MR. PAULEYs
Q

In 1202(a), you mean, Your Honor?

Yes.

MR. PAULEY s

This

12
Q

Why do they say ein commerce or affecting

commerce", if they meant fcha findings in 1201?
MR, PAULEYS

I don't think there's any sound answer

to that, . Your Honor, other than the legislative history ©f the
statist©, which X was going to come to in a moment, indicates
'■-h- •: i•> cay caw boon put in there as an inadvertence.
Q

This —

In any event, you think it's surplus?

HR. PAULEYs

In any event, we think it should b©

conin-3d,notwithstanding the possible illogic of this position,
solely to the transportation branch of the statute.
The explanation may in part rest''on the fact that
this statute received no scrutiny by any committee in either
house of the Congress? it was introduced in May of 1968 by
Senator Long on the Floor of the Senate as an amendment to
what was enacted iS> the following month as the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.
Senator Long, on two occasions, explained the
ovx>pr ' • of fain: a^3ncte€i!it in such a manner as to mrJca it totally
I. : ;.: •< \v! vMrt vrm intended was a blanket prohibition on the
or receipt of firearms by convicted felons? indeed,
b

ow*■ c;3ion, in a colloquy with- Senator McClellan, which

is sere forth at pages 12 to 13 c-f our brief, Senator Long was
asked toy Senator McClellan:

Under your bill could a convicted

felon have a firearm in hia own home?
The very csss which, on these facts, is now before
i

13

the Court.
Senator Long's response was:

Mo* he could not*

In addition# the Court of Appeals below failed to
tak© into account that sine© 1961 it has been a federal crime
for a convicted felon to receive or transport a firearm in
interstate or foreign commerce,

Those sections which formerly

were codified in Title 15 of the United States Code were
carried forward as Title 4 of the very same Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act t© which Senator Long*s bill was
ix: air- -.draent.

And Title 4 was sponsored by Senator Dodd, who

pertinently inquired of Senator Long on the Floor whether his
!

bill was intended to replace Title 4g and Sejnator Long respor l-nd, Ho# rather that it was intended to add to or to camplemeat that title*
Wow# it is true that ©van if Section 1202(a) were
to bo construed in the fashion that the court below did# so as
to require proof of an interstate commerce element an to a
possession charge# it and Title 4 would not cover exactly the
santi grounds# since* they apply to certain different categories
of persons®
But the principal provision# both in Section 1202(a)
and in Title 4# is its prohibition on the class of persons
\-/ho ox:'

convicted felons from possessing firearms®

And so we

submit that Senator Long’s answer to Senator Dodd# taken in

ccnjurcvlor with fefe© .rest of the legislative history and the

u
inc.V-.oiop, c-f t-r formal findings in 1201, and th© grecsnar of
Section 120-2(a)? mdfc© it abundantly clear that, at least a© to
feta crime of possession ©f a firearm. Congress intended not t©

require proof of an affect on ioterstata commerce in th®
individual prosecution, but, rather, to rely on th© formal
findings.
Turning then to tho constitutiona1 question, if
th©r© are no —
C'

Mr* Pauley, lat as© ask on© question about th©

obstruction aspect.

Th© statute speak® in terms of felon;

how is felon defined?

Is it
Felon is defined -** th© provision is

MR. PAULEY:

Sactica 1202(c) and la'set forth at page 3 of our brief —
C

Yes»

In other words, it takes us to the

several variant definitions of State statutes as well ©s to
■the definition under federal law.
MR. PAULEY I

Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

Just as —

And, hence, what may b© a felony in Missouri

might well not be in California.
MR. PAULEYs

Q

That is certainly true, Your Honor.

Does this disturb you at all?

MR. PAULEY:

1 don't think — this is a point which

respondent has raised in his answering brief, and which both

aidao egret was not reached by fchs court below and thus need
sat tw considered here.

But, were it to b© considered, w© do

IS
not ti'-i.ul

State definitions of

bean exercised many tiruss.

Tor example., in the

assimilative Crimes Act, and would sesm to bo a rations!
means for Congress to legislate.
You1den®t seem to cite this Tot cme decided,
[463]
I think, around 319 O.S. 330, Justice Roberta3 opinion for the
q

Court,

Where there was a presumption that a person who

possessed a firearm has departed interstate commerce.

This

would aasm to b©' but •another way of creating a conclusive
presumption now, isn’t it.?
MR. PAULEY;

No, I don’t think so, Your Honor.

The

yr *••.;•• . / which Congress sought to exercise in Tot was limited to
in which it could

shown that a firearm had been in

:;c- ’.su/2®, and it then sought to reach that result, or at least
to autf.wri :.'.e a jury to find that fact by means of a presumption
flowing from the fact of possession itself.
And what this Court held was that the presumption
was invalid because there was no rational nexus between mere
possession and a finding of — that a firearm had moved in
interstate commerce in an individual case.
What Congress has don® hare, on th© contrary, is to
find that a class of activities, namely the possession of
firearms by convicted felons, in the aggregate affects
intercotmtn commerce, ©ad therefore it is not necessary for

16
ohs govarspRiit, in £»y individual case to prove fcilo existence

involved a statute- making it an offense to engage in extortion
c;;,.»d;u activities, whsre the Congress first mad® formal
findings to the effect that this class of transactions as a
whole had a detrimental impact on commerce, and then enacted
crime-defining section# which eliminated the necessity for
proof in the individual case.
Q

Well, there, Mr. Pauley, however, ware specific

wvrs th.-’hj true.

hccvo — in IhR light ch ia-rnni
It 'would be closer to the facts of
But tfc© essential foatur© of Pera% on

which we rely is the test for assessing the constitutionality
of statutes of -.this species, which the Court in Peres re­
affirmed; and that test is simply whether the findings made by
Congress h&v© a rational basis.
li© lava set. forth in our brief certain of the facts
bsfor® Congress, at th® time of enactment of this statute,
on which we submit that Congress could reasonably conclude

17
that poa@98si.on of firsarme by convicted felons did have a
detrimental impact on

commrae.

In essence» they are that the national cost» in terms
of moneys taken alone from certain crimes» such as burglary,
robbery,and larceny, was, in 1967» much tbs batter part of
$1 billion, and now exceeds that figure, that further
statistics showed that a high percentage of such crimes was
committed with firearm®, and that other statistics showed that
a similarly high percentage was committed by recidivists» by
persons with previous criminal records.

Mid based on the aggregate national cost, the impact
to our economy from the commission of crimes by this class of
persons, we think Congress could rationally conclude that to
put firearms in the hands ©f convicted felons or not to
attempt to punish that, would result in a serious detrimental
affect upon interstate commerce*

And we rely not only on the

amounts taken as a ressult of such criminal conduct, but on
the further fact, m Senator Long noted to his colleagues in
the Senate, that the possession of firearms by convicted
felons would deter large numbers of people from doing business,
which in turn would seriously affect commerce.
In addition to the commerce clause basis of the
statute, v?e also think the statute may be sustained, as the
district judge did, on the basis of Congress' undoubted
powers to safeguard the life of the President; of the United

IS

States.
Th® Court of Appeals below did not discuss this
alternative finding by th© district court, which has been
adopted by the Court of Appeals for th© ftinth Circuit.

This

Court only recently, in the Watts case, had occasion to not©
that th® safety of th® President is of course © matter of
overwhelming national concern.

In view of th© overriding

nature of that interest and in view of th© unfortunate history
in this country of assaults and assassinations by firearms
upon former Presidents and.other high public officials, we
submit that it was not unreasonable for Congress to conclude
that,even though

m

indirect means, it would significantly

further the safety of the President and Vice President to make
it a crime for a convicted felon to possess a firearm.
For those reasons we submit that the judgment of th©
court below should be reversed, and th© cause remanded with
.
r
directions to reinstate th© judgment and sentence of th®
district court.
q

Is th© Second Circuit the only on© that held

as they did?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. HELLERSTEIN, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HELLERSTSINs

Mr. Justice Douglas, may it please

the Courts
It is our position that the Court of Appeals
interpretation i® sound for many, many reasons.
Let me first fire one arrow in my bow, that the
Court of Appeals did not find necessary to even discus®, but
which this Court, in similar situations, has discussed.
Namely, this is a criminal statute.

Its ambiguity is conceded?

in fact, it is so evident by the difference© of opinion among
the district courts and the circuit court® and the government
concede® not only ie it ambiguous, you must, if we and the
government are right, weed out an entire section of the
provision*

20
That wher© ther© is an ambiguity of this dagre© ,
this being a penal statute, it should b® narrowly construed
in favor of a criminal defendantTurning now to the reasons which I think support, the
Court of Appeals decision is, one, th© Court of Appeals was
her© dealing with a statute as again the government concedes
was drafted and passed with the greatest of haste, with an
absence of legislative consultation,, an absence of findings
and hearings The government, on oral argument, has just made a
further concession which is not in its brief and, in fact,
which my brief does not avert to, is, namely, the government
no longer, as I understand their argument, views th© redundancy
argument which it makes at pages 16 and 1? of its brief as
strong as it doss in its brief.

Namely, the argument against

the Second Circuit opinion was that if its interpretation is
adopted, then Senator Long's statute, in essence the entire
section of 1202, on page 1? of th© government's brief they
say it's better to cut out just, the commerce transport section
than it is to make the entire section superfluous.
Jis I understand the government, they now say it
won't be superfluous and enters a very good reason.

And I

apologize to the Court for not really getting into it in my

brief, because the answer is so obvious.
And it is tied to an error in the government's brief.

21
afc page 16, footnote 4 «—• footnote 10, excuse me, on page 16,
Footnote 10 of the government's brief says that
"Title- IV expanded the class of persons who may not possess
weapons — may not ship or transport weapons in interstate
commerce .
That is not so.

That expansion takes place in Title

1 of the Gun Control Act of 1968, which was passed four months
after the Long amendment.
What you had at the time the Long amendment was
passed was old 18, 19, 22, (£) and (©} then transformed into
(g) and (h) of Titi® IV by Title I of the 1968 Act.
At the time of Senator Long's amendment all you had
was a prohibition against the shipment or receipt in Interstate
commerce by a prior felon.

What Senator Long's amendment does

vastly increase the numbers of persons who snay not have
weapons, namely, persons discharged from the armed forces under
dishonorable conditions, mental incompetents, persons

who have

>

/

renounced citizenship, and unlawful aliens.
Also Title IV had an exclusion for white-collar
phonies {?), Title VII, Senator Long's amendment, does net.
Also, Senator Long's amendment adds the offense
of possession, which Title IV deals only with receipt and
shipment.

And I &&y that Title VII, Senator Long's amendment,

does include the terms "transports in commerce*5 or "affecting
' >

commerce.”

*

22
So# ia ©scene©, what th@ Court of Appeals has done
is? on the legislative record before it# taken © statute which
has terms of art that are key constitutional terms? namely,
"affecting commarce".

And ha® interpreted the statute without

further guidance from Congress that (a) avoids the reaching of
•a constitutional determination as to Congress’ power to legis­
late against the mere receipt and possession without proof of
a commerce n©KUs.
It is to that question that the government’s position
•would force this Court.
Now, as I have understood the doctrine concerning
constitutional adjudication, it was applicable not whether
or not the constitutional question was decided favorably for
on© party or the other, but whether or not it need be decided
at all.
Now, certainly, this case does not present the
\

v&erewithal for this "Court, I think, - to approach that question.
I think there are two decisions of this Court which
are so similar in my mind that they form sort of a litigation
model for how X, as respondent’s counsel, suggest resolution
of this case.
I will briefly call Your Honors5 attention to, first,
the case of United States vs. Denmark, which really should be
captioned "United States vs. five gambling devices"," ©pinion
by Justice Jackson.

And then the case last term of Rewis vs.

23
The United States»
In both of thos© cases, all the elements that w© seek
this Court to appreciate here for oar side were present.

You

had two statutes dealing with Congress8 power to affect intra­
state terminations.

In Denmark, it was whether mar© regis­

tration r,y. e?r:ihiing devices that had no connection with inter-»
state transactions was to be requited.
The statute, as the Court wrote, could have been
interpreted either way.

But the legislative history in

Danmark was silent, offered the Court no- guidance as to what
the intendment of Congress was, and the Court said:

(a) tills

;■ V v

is a penal statute;

<h) we don't have enough from Congress to

make this determination; and (c) there were other elements,
namely, that when we're dealing with intrastate matters you
also ar@ d«aling with the sensitivity ©f federal and State
relations, and also, indeed, with the consequences to federal
police enforcement.powers, materiel for expanded congressional
involve vent., federal involvement in the ordinary concepts of
the criminal law normally associated with State police powers.
And in Rewis again, opinion by Mr. Justice Marshall,
without help from Congress, clearly designating what its intent
was, although the statute was susceptible to two constructions
the Court, given the nature of the case as a criminal cas®,
took the narrow construction.
We think that the constitutional issue in the cas© is

24
not as simple as the government, would have it.
1 believe in the prior argumentr Mr. Solicitor
General used the phrase that principals have a tendency to
expand the limits of illogic.
I’d like to borrow that phrase,, because it does
describe what I’ve tried to communicate to the Court in Point
II of our brief.
ks I understand the vast powers of Congress under the
commerce clausa, as this Court has decreed it in recent years,
;it is very vast, but it is not- unlimited, it is a question of
degree.
The Polish,national Alliance ys^JjLRB case, which we
cite in our brief, talks in those terms.
Mow, a question of degree means that you have to
look on a spectrum of conduct in activity, as I see it, to say
when is that question of degree beyond Congress9 powers?
And her© w© think the regulation, based on the haste of the
amendment, absence of findings, although I recognize that the
Court does not require findings on the question of
constitutional powers of Congress, requires us to look at what
conduct, if the government’s interpretation is right. Congress
was really thinking of?

the mere receipt or possession of a

weapon in u man's own home, without more; no requirement
that the weapon was transported in interstate commerce, or
cams interstate commerce

25
Which i<sads m© back again to another interesting
question, the Casey Amendment, which was debated in Congress
at length, after this statute was enacted, talked — the subject
of that amendment was to make it a crime fee commit a crime
with any kind, or the 'weapon that had traveled in interstate
commerce»
So, after you had Congress talking, as the government
would have it, about not requiring a commerce nexus, it
achieved the very result which the government says this
statute achieves, there still was lengthy debate on the
amendment that was defeated.
But, returning t© fell® spectrum of criminal conducts
What you have, essentially, is a passive act — and the word
"act” is even possibly a misnomer — a passive state of
affairs, a weapon in a man's horns?, lying dormant and not
affecting anything.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLASs

We will recess at this time.

recessed, to reconvene at Is00 p.m., the same day»]

AFTERNOON SESSION
D,:00 p.nuj
ME. -JUSTICE DOUGLAS ^

The Chief Justice intends to

sit in the cases argued this afternoon, although he’s necessarily
absent ,
Mr. Hellerstein.
MR. HELLERSTEINs

Mr, Justice Douglas, may it pleas©

the Courts
To pick up where 1 left off, X8d like fc© go back fco
the •.•redundancy question, the redundancy of Title VII with
Title IV, and just add a thought about why I think that even if
there is a slight redundancy in language with respect to
leaving in Title VII the interpretation the circuit put on
it, that essentially it is giving what Congress really would
like to have in Title VII.
I think if you read the legislative history of
Title VII and the provisions in Section 1202(a)CD dealing
with aliens, with mental incompetents, with dishonorably
discharged persons, you will ®ee that the conceptual nature

of Title VII, and I think what Senator Long wanted t© have
enacted and what Congress, I think, believed it was enacting,
ilhait hastily, was essentially an assassin bill.

That up

to the tie;© th« Congress had concerned itself merely with
felons and weapons? but, giving the assassination of President
Kennedy, the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, you can

27
tell from the legislative record# brief as it is# that this is
what was at issue when this bill was passed#

That there was a

feeling by Senator Long of getting to the question of assassins
and people who are irresponsible and proscribing them from
having weapons.
With that in mind# 1 think, of course I must pass to
the constitutional issue to convince Your Honors that it is
serious enough to at least forestall decision on it until the
case presents the necessity for it.

This is not that case.

As I stated earlier, the question is one ©£ degree
of the Congress’ power, and I think the degree must ©£ course
be very far removed for me to convince you that Congress does
not have the power.
But 1 think, as X said on the spectrum of criminal
conduct, the mere possession of a weapons goes to the utmost
of that decree, wherein Congress may not reach, because this is
essentially a passive act, regulated by most of the laws of the
State, ©van when committed by a man with a prior felony*
Fares of course is a tough case, but 1 do not believe
it is indistinguishablei I believe, if anything, it points the
way to resolution in our favor of the issue hers, if that issue
must fc© decided*
As Mr. Justice Blackmun pointed out, with respect to
Mr. Pauley's argument, I think the.thrust of his question was
that:

d .isn't have Persa have within it a replete — replete

28

with interstate conss&rca nexus?
The statute in Consumer Title IX of the Consumer
Credit Protection Act found that organised crime itself was
interstat® and international in character, and that a sub­
stantial part of the income of organised crime was generated
by extortion of credit transactions.
Subdivision 3 of that section found that extortion
ia credit transactions are tied on, fe© a substantial extent,
to interestate and foreign commerce, and through the means and
instrumentalities of such commerce.

And then it talked about

the ancillary group ©£ intrastate loan-sharking activities»
2 read Peres as a traditional commerce clause case
in the sense that Congress has opted to regulate, in bulk,
conduct that was commercial but, in essence, was interstate
in character.

It was no different than Wiokard vaFilfovxn,

where, simply because it was local wheat raising, the entire
scheme of regulation that was interstate in nature could not
include the affect of that intrastate wheat raising.

The same

as I read Perez.
The thrust of the entire Title II of the Consumer
Credit. Protection Act was to regulate organized crime, was to
regulate interstate transactions, and to bring into that
regulation these intrastate activities that were ancillary?
and of course would affect the efficiency and effectiveness
of the total attempt at regulation.

29

Thar® is no such class of activities her©, in terms
of gun possession, mer© gun possession, or receipt by felons.
That is tb/s same, or has*, a corollary to the Consumer Credit
Protection Act, because there is only one class of activity?

and I think that's the k©y phrase in commerce clause litigation.
Here the class of activity is simply the unit of
local possession and receipt,

There is no larger unit of

interstat® regulation in. terms ©f the affect on commerce.
So that Congress, if the government is correct, has
opted to regulate something that is not part of the interstate
regulation scheme, but starts out as intrastate end ends being
intrastate.
And I think that the language Ju.st.ics Stewart
employed in dissent in Peres, although not shared by the other
members? of the Court, is the kind of language that commends
itself to resolution her©? because if this statute would be
sustair.od m a proper exercise of the commerce power, namely,
mere poasesiofc, on the theory that sirs possession would then
prompt an cot and the act ifcs&Af would affect commerce, namely,
the robbery or the larceny•

That Congress can therefor©

regulate the possession.
with that as your common denominator, mer© possession,
what you have is the ability of Congress to regulat® any type
of crime, really any type of crime, so long as the logical

extension is that somewhere beyond the crime commerce will be

30

affected*

f

llmf, once again talking about this expanded logic to
/

an ultimate, y©s, T. could not, on a syllogistic basis, deny that
some man with a gun' might then opt to use that gun to commit
a critae which then might bring itself within th® realm of
statistical material that the government offers to you as s
rational basis *
But that, X think, really extends the commerce
power quite a bit too far*

ted it*© interesting that the

Congress has not yet attempted to regulate the acts of crime
which would directly affect interestate commerce, or even
indirectly affect interstate commerces

a robbery? a larceny.

And yet it has, if the government is correct, opted to jump
over those acts and go right to the mere possession, which
may or may not have any effect at all on interstate commerce.
I thick in that context the Pares decision doe#

not paint the way towards m easy resolution of the constitu­
tional issue in this case, unless it is to say, especially

in ! case where there are no findings, there are no hearings,
that- Congress may simply designat® passive criminal conduct,

and again I use the word "conduct" cautiously?

may simply

designat® that, posit that sines crimes are committed with
weapons, albeit local crimes, that then therefore there is
federal power to so regulate.
had l would submit that before Congress goes that far,

31
it ought to at least tek® th® intermediate step and have the
question presented, whether the regulation of a mare act of
robbery could be properly within th© federal scope.
In this case it does not.

The government’s position,

in short, I submit, is really a conjectural ones
findings or hearings' — well-, finding®

that, absent

there are — but

absent hearings, the statistics which th® government posits
really asa of no help to the Court, ©s I see it.
in a way, prove too much.

Because they,

And I just say that in the sense

that they don’t prove anything at all.

To say that commerce

is affected by large amounts of robberies and larcenies does
not get you to the point where you can simply resolve th©
constitutional question of -she possession of the weapon as
being that connected to commerce.
Absent any kind of explication by Congress of th©
relevancy of mere weapon possession by a very narrow, limited
group of personnel, prior felons, and its connection to ;
commerce, I see very little basis on the record before this
Court, both in this case and th© legislative record, for taking
that serious step of expansion under the commerce clause.
Again 2 say that I don’t think I have', to con vinos
you that th© ©tap ought not foe taken, but that —

2 do

believe that it is unconstitutional for Congress to do this
this far.

But I only seek to convince you that there is a

serious issue, which the construction given th® statute by the

32
Court of Appeals can help you avoid deciding that question on
this particular record in this particular case.
Nov/, the government, in its oral argument but not
in its brief, chose, for the first time, to rely on the power
of Congress to protect the Vies President and the President
as a means for sustaining this statute.

This was a position

taken by Judge Frenkel, although rather cursorily, and the
government did not take it in its brief, it simply referred
the Court to this prong of the findings as merely indicative
of Congress8 intent but not of its powers.
I submit that reading the congressional history,
whatever there is, I think the .court below was correct still
in viewing it as really enacted under the commerce power.
But even if that were not the css®, there were two other prongs,
namely, the power to protect a republican form of government,
the power to protect rights under the First Amendment, and the
third being that of protecting the life of the President and
the Vice President,
I think those three really are in the same category,
namely that they are far removed from what Congress9 power
really is in the premises3 namely, the Watts case, which dealt
with tiis statute enacted to prohibit threats against the life
of-the President, was a considered Act of Congress on a very
narrow issue to take direct action? to say that the mare
possession ©fa weapon in one's home is a threat to the

33
President ox the Vice President, ones again, I think, on a
*

syllogistic scheme of abstract logic, might be defensible,
But in terms of constitutional power, again, I think it falls
short.
Mr. Justice Blackmum torched on the third point in
our brief, which was raised in the courts below but not
decided by the* circuit, in light of their resolution of the
issue.

That is that Section 1202(c) in defining "felony*3 for

the predicate conviction in this case violates the equal
protection clause.
That is because, in defining “felony" to b© a crime
•other than a misdemeanor, punishable by less than two years in
prison, Mr, Justice Biackmun is entirely correct in referring
to vagaries and th© differentials between the statutes of the
various States on crime.
For instance, Mr. Bass, convicted of attempted grand
larceny in the second degree in Hew York, would have only been
>

guilty of a misdemeanor in California and a number of other
States,

And yet, in California, that person, committing the

same act in this case as Mr. Bass, could not have been punished
or prosecuted under this statute.
The isst • is not raised? I raise it before this Court
b^oaus^ it is my understanding, under Unitad States vs, Spector,
that this Court can, if it want® to, decide the equal protection
issue, if it feels there is no necessity for sanding it back

34
to tiie court of appeals, if it affirms on all the other issues
— if it reverses# I should say# on the other issues in the
case.
I would submit that# in the interest of my client#
if this Court were to reverse# I would then ask for remand
back to the circuit for getting its wisdom on the equal pro­
tection issue# since it did not. rule on that issue.
However# just to recapitulate what I think this
case involves is a statute carelessly drawn* quickly drawn#
whatever motivation for drawing there may be# I think it is
not vary frequent that the Congress acts with such hast© in
drafting a statute or enacting a statute which affects matters
never before affected under any federal statute.
Given that# and that is © criminal case where you
normally apply a rule of narrow construction# and an ambiguous
statutes which avoids the constitutional issue# l think that the
approach -taken by the Second Circuit is far superior to that
taken by the other circuits# because the other circuits put the
cart before the horse.
The Eighth and Sixth Circuits saids'

we don't have

any problem with the constitutional question at all# therefore#
we811 decide it and then decide the statute along those lines.
The Eighth Circuit accepted the government's argument
of redundancy.

I think the government no longer tenders it to

you in th® same form it mad® in the Eighth Circuit or in its

35
brief.
I think what the Second Circuit does is to take the
view that all the elements, and even one that I did not — that
I mentioned, but which the circuit didn't rely ©ns
narrow construction rule.

the

Given what is befor® us in this

case on this legislative record, that the hanging of a criminal
conviction, which involves termination of constitutionality on
this particular defendant, makes little sense.
And the commerce clause issue which I would point out
was decidedly avoided by the circuit in this eas© was the same
court, albeit different members of the panel, that did decide
the Peres cas© affirmatively, and was affirmed by this Court.
So the Second Circuit felt that Peres is a valid exercise of
constitutional power, but seem to have greater doubts with
respect to -tills case.
For these reasons, I would respectfully submit that
4

the judgment of the court below be affirmed.
Q

Mr. Hellerstein, may 1 ask on© question on that;

hs 1 recall, the First circuit had a case called
White —

MR. HEILBRSTEINs
0

Yes, Your Honor.

— concerning depressant drugs, and if my

memory serves me, the Eighth Circuit also had a case called
Whit®

that was involved with the same statute.

Do you have

any comment about those decisions, which, as I recall again,

36
were both to feh© same effect, and each upheld the statute.
MR. HELLERSTBINs

Yes, in the White case, which is

cited in the Second Circuit's opinion ~~ because the government
heavily relied on it below — at page 15 of my brief, Mr.
Justices Blackmun, I cite to White, and I view the Whit® case
as the Second Circuit did? that the circuit harmonised White
with this case by noting that, in sustaining Congress" power
to regulate possession of depressant and stimulant drugs,
"itself recognised the distinct problems inherent in the field
of drug regulation," the First Circuit wrote?
"Unlike many other objects of federal regulation,
depressant and stimulant drugs are not an inert, passive
substance, which, aft®?; us®, pass into the realm of consumption.
They exert influence on the consumer."

1 think what the circuit there, with respect to
drugs, was concerned with is that drugs affect people who get
on highways, who take all kinds of action which directly keeps
the interest of regulation going, even though it’s an intra­
state .matter.
Q

You would draw a distinction, then, with

firearms, from drugs; they get on highways too once in a while,
don't they?
MR. HELLERSTSIWs

Yes, but they ©re not ingested by

the petitioner or the defendant.

They are, in a sense, more

inactive than oven drugs, in the sense that they are totally

37
inactive until something else activates them.
And I think that White is a tough case.
Your Honor's question is well put.

I think that

I think that the line of

distinction is quit© narrow„
I would only note., also» that this Court has not»
except for a denial of certain Whits» made any ruling on- that
issue.

But I think again the question in Mbit© with drugs is

the complete flexibility and movement ©£ drugs.

I would

submit even more flexible and more hard to regulate than the
movement in weapons» which this statute already dess provida
for; namely, the receipts and shipment in interstate commerce
of firearms.
I don't think that the drug regulation carries that.
Also that the drug statute is part of a general scheme of
regulations that has interstate qualities to begin with.

And

I -would suggest that, again, it is more along the model of.
"

j

Perez and the Consumer Credit Protection Act than it is With
respect to this 'statute*
<

Q

Kelly the cases as a group come together, and

somewhere there is a watershed, isn't there?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Yes, sir.

I think in this case,

however, all things being equal, the litigation posture of
this case, the record before the Court, the Circuit Court of
Appeals who certainly, I think, had the better of it in
•avoiding the entanglement of those constitutional questions.

38
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS;

Mr. Pauley, you have,. I think,

three minutes left.
MR. PAULEYi

I have nothing further, Your Honor,

unless there are questions.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS:

Thank you.

The case will be submitted.
Mr. Hellerstein, we named you — the Court designated
you as attorney for the respondent, and we want to thank you
for the fine public service you've rendered.
MR. HELLSRSTEINs Thank you, sir.
[Whereupon, at 1:19 p.m., the case was
submitted.1
