MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

ne:::t in the case- No. 71-452, Healy against James.
Mr. Wulf, you may proceed when you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELVIN L. WULF, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WULF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is here on a petition for writ of
certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit.
The question it presents is whether the First
Amendment forbids the president of a State college from refusing
official recognition to a student political organisation,
when the decision is based only upon undifferentiated fear or
apprehension of disturbance.
The facts of the case are that the petitioners in
this case, following the applicable rules of the college,
Central Connecticut State College, submitted an application for
recognition of a local chapter of Students for a Democratic
Society.
The fact of recognition has significant consequences,
because without it a student group cannot meet on campus, it
cannot make use of any of the college's facilities, cannot
sponsor meetings on campus, can't make use of the student

4
newspaper, nor u??e o.f the student bulletin board, nor can make
application for student funds.
Q

Are any of the students still enrolled there?

MR. WULFs Two of them are, sir.

Tastor and Knowles

are still duly enrolled at the college, yes.
The application that they submitted, and I want to
read it in its entirety, because it's really the foundation
of our assertions about their First Amendment claim, said
that they would like to form a local chapter of Students for a
Democratic Society, and they gave three reasons.

They said?

"Because the university is intended to be the arena
of education, where there is an unfettered exchange of ideas,
SDS would provide a forum of discussion and self-education for
students developing an analysis of American society and
institutions, including higher education, and the world
situation in general.”
They said that "SDS would provide an agency for
integrating through with action so as to bring about construc­
tive changes in the university, in American life, and the world.And thirdly they said that ”SDS would provide a
coordinating body for relating the problems of leftist students
and other groups, such as the student body as a whole, the
working class, the black populace or whatever other individuals
or groups in fact or potential^ y in accord with the purposes
of the Central Connecticut State College chapter of SDS,."

5

That application vas submitted to a joint studentfaculty committee called the Student Activities Committee.
And the petitioners came before the committee, who raised a
few questions with them.

They, themselves, the committee, was

concerned about evidence of violent response of the national
SBS organization and local SDS chapters throughout the
country.

And they asked the petitioners 'about what their ties

would be to the national SDS, and the students replied —
this is on page 94 of the Appendix — that "The Chapter does
net affiliate with the national organisation", they said, "We
will be completely independent."
tod when asked why the chapter, why they cared to
use the name of national SDS, they said "Because the name
brings to mind the type of organisation we wish to bring
across, that is a left-wing organisation which will.allow
i

students interested in such to express themselves."
Q

Who were the members of the committee?

Was it

a student~facuity-administration?
MR. WULFs

It’s a joint student-faculty committee.

I don’t know what the —
Q

Just student and faculty?

No members of the

administration, as such?
MR. WOLFr

I think — yes, one of the deans, Judd,

who was later to serve as the Hearing Officer, as a matter of
fact, was a member of that same committee.

Q

.And you don’t know much about the structural

organisational structure of this collage or university, do
we, is it in the record?
MR. WOLFs

No, we don't.

Of the university — well,

we know it's a fairly large university.
Q

Central Connecticut State College —- it's not

a university, I gather?
MR. WOLFj
Q

It’s a college.

It's a wholly State-supported college

But it is a college, 1 mean.

MR. WOLFs

— it does grant a graduate Master's

degree, as a matter of fact*

It has 7,000 — according to its

catalog, which I have here, it has 7,000 full-time day students
and an additional 15,000 evening and summer students.

So it’s

a fairly large place,
Q

Where is it, Hartford, or where?

MR. WOLF;
Q
supported?

New Bedford, sir.

New Bedford, yes.

And it's wholly State-

Tax supported?
MR, WULFi

Wholly State-supported.

It's part of the Connecticut State College System,
yes, sir.

Fully tax supported.
Q

Mr. Wulf, let me get straightened out.

describe the application, they refer to themselves as a
chapter of SDS, am I correct in that impression?
MR. WULF:

They did, yes, sir.

As you

0

Anci yet they disavow any affiliation, according

to your later words,

MR, WOLFs

They originally — in their original

application they described themselves as a local chapter of

SDS„

Although they describe themselves as that, they protested

that they would not have ties to the national SDS organisation,
Subsequently, presumably in order to try to meet the
objections that various people made to the national SDS, they
said that they would call themselves CCSCSDS, which is a ’lot of
initials, but specifieaally withdrawing their description as
being a local cliapter.
Q

Had some of these applicants been members of

other chapters elsewhere?
MR, WULF: The record doesn't show, sir, and I don't
know,
Q

X thought one of them had some Michigan State

affiliations.
MR. WULF: Their faculty advisor had, when he was a
graduate student at Michigan State University, been a member of

SDS out there, and he testified at the hearing for the purpose
of supporting petitioners5 claim that there could be such a
thing as a local SDS chapter that didn't really have any
official, informal, or certainly formal affiliation with national

SDS, that its local chapters could be totally independent.
He said that was the way his chapter had functioned, at Michigan

State University.
Q

i'vho is Barbara Healy?

MR. WULF: She "/as one of the student petitioners,
Your Honor»
Q

and Appendix 81 says “member of Michigan State .

chapter"*
MR. WOLFs

Appendix 81.

Healy is our petitioner student»

Oh, no, I’m sorry, Catherine
Barbara Healy — this is an

excerpt from a hearing of the House Internal Security
Committee, which was introduced at the hearing by the Hearing
Officer, in order to try to show an inevitable relationship
between local SI’S chapters and national SD.S.

And this was a

membership card that the House Committee acquired somehow

03; other, I don’t know how.

But it was one of a number of

there’s one on the preceding page, too.

But she is a

different Miss Healy.
Q

I recall something in the record about questions

relating to the use of violence.

Was there a responsa to the

effect that that would depend on circumstances, whether
violence would be used?
MR. WVJLFs That’s right.
Q

That’s -~

Where is that in here?

MR. WULFs That’s on page 95 of the Appendix, and
it’s part of the same meeting of the Student Affairs
Committee, which I referred to a little earlier»

Anci I was

3

next going to describe that Q and A that took place at that
hearing.
The committee members asked Miss Healy:

13How would

you respond to issues of violence as other SDS chapters have?55
It seems a little garbled, but that's the way it is in the
original transcript.

And her answer was: "Our action would have

to be dependent upon each issue."
"Would you use any means possible?" "No, I can’t say
that; would not know until we know what the issues are."
And question 7 wass
interrupting a class?"

"Could you envision the SDS

"Impossible for ne to say."

But what that comes to, and I’m going to deal with
that later on in my argument, is, notwithstanding the terrible
ambiguity of the questions and the equal ambiguity of the
answers, we would concede that, at moat, it's a refusal to
renounce the use of violence under all circumstances.
But —
Q

Would you think that a trier of facts hearing

that could draw that inference, then?

That they might use

force and violence to interrupt classes, or —
MR. WULF:

No, I don’t think that they could draw the

inference that they might use it.

1 think that they must draw

— that the furtherest inference they car, draw is that these
people are not pacifists, that they would not under all
circumstances renounce the use of violence.

10
Q

Well, they weren’t talking about the Vietnam

Mar here in this college, they were talk.-.ng about violence
on the campus, in the classroom.
MR. WULF;

Precisely.

And the whole thrust of our

argument is, regardless of these answers

regardless of these

answers, and taking into account their 'ambiguity, that the
local chapter had to be recognised because to refuse to do so
is a forbidden prior restraint, and then and only then should
these petitioners engage in conduct which is either illegal
and will be prosecuted or would be misconduct, for purposes
of the .school administration, and could be dealt with as a local
disciplinary problem only until that point, when that point
was reached, if it ever was» reached.

Because this is not a

guarantee, by any means, that they were going to engage in
any illegal or violent conduct; but only that they did not
renounce it.

But if and when they did engage in that forbidden

ccncudt, then sanction could be taken appropriately against
them.
Q

So if the answer to the question had been, Yes,

■we can envision it and we might very well do so? your answer
would be the same?
MR. WLTLFs
Q

Precisely the same, yes, sir.

Well, this is related to a question I've had on

my mind, there is so much in the brief hare, in the record,
bearing on the question of whether or no: this is or is not a

11
local chapter, a bona fide affiliated local chapter of the
SDS.

And in your argument does that make any difference at all?
MR. WOLFs
Q

'Mo, none at all.

X think —

I didn't think so, but that seems to be the

issue throughout here.
MR. WXJLFs

Well, that's the issue as the respondents

and their friends in court make it, be cat se they're trying to
put SDS on trialj and our perspective, of course, is that it's
the petitioners who are before this Court, and not SDS.

And

you will find very little in the record end vary little in
respondents' brief about the petitionerst
But our claim, of course, is that it's the petitioners
who are making the application here.
0

But 1 thought your claim was whether or not, or

let's just assume it's affiliated with the SDS, nonetheless
it was a violation of constitutional rights of your clients
not to be accredited as a campus organisation.
MR. WULF: Surely.
Q
isn't it?

Surely, sir,

But 1 accept —

Well, is that a red herring to your argument or

Thats what X wanted to get at.

Because that

seems to be so much of what the briefs are devoted to.
Both briefs.
MR, WULF:

Well, perhaps I was misled by it being

introduced as a rad herring by the respondents, and X fried to
deal with it

12
Q

Well, if it isn’t, raayhe It isn’t? font I just

want to be sure I understand your argument.

MR. WULF:

Well, I accept ray clients’ claim that they

intended not to have any affiliation with national SBS.
Q

But —

What difference does that make to your argument?

MR. WOLF:

It doesn’t make any different to my

argument, because even if, as initially they said they wanted
to be a local chapter of SD3, and if they were in fact going
to have a formal relationship with SDS, my argument would
still be the sams,
0

That's what I thought.

Q

Mr. Wulf, are there any grounds, than, upon

which you believe that the university or college could refuse
recognition to a group?
MR. WULF:
that would be no.

I think that, on the whole, the answer to
I think that if, on the face of an applica­

tion, the student group wanted to organise for the purpose of
engaging in admittedly illegal acts, students to engage in
bank robbing, for example, I think that they could deny that
kind of an application.

But when the application is for a

bona fide or political organisation, I think that the university
or the college has to look to the individual applicant-to see
what their criteria, what their characteristics ara.

X don’t

think they can look very far, as to what their characteristics

are

Q

Tint it they said, We're a bona fide political

organization, and at times w<s achieve our ends through
violent means? you would say they have to wait for the violence,
or could they, like the bank robbing group, be denied their
application?
MR. WULF:

That if they're predominantly political,

they would have to bo -- the college would have to grant the
»

application, and would have to wait to see whether they in.faet
engage in any illegal conduct.
I don't think that where First Amendment rights are
at issue, that the State can make predictions, even on the
basis of assertions by the citizens themselves that they might
engage in some illegal conduct, that the State cannot predict
that they will,

And that the purpose of the First Amendment,

of course, is to try to discourage peoplo from engaging in
illegal conduct, and it might well be that upon participating
in the political process those who might ba disposed towards
illegal conduct will be discouraged from engaging in illegal
conduct.
Q

Mr. Wulf, suppose that, in this colloquy on

page 7, it had been developed, in response to —
MS. WiJLFs
Q

I'm sorry.

:?age 95, excuse me.

MR. WOLFs

Q

What page, sir?

Yes.

Page 95, where they were discussing the use of

interruption of classf and force and violence, use of force

an‘\ violence, suppose the answer was2

We would reserve the

right to use force and violence to disrupt the classes of all
professors who did not. denounce the Vietnam War and several
other issues that they might identify with?
Would you think that would be enough to refuse to
grant them?
MR. WlfLF:

Did they say they would only, they would

exorcise it or merely reserve it?
Q

Reserve the right to use force and violence.

MR. WULFi
Q
step:

Cannot be denied.

I donEt

*

ftow.then, let's take it the next step, your

that they would use force and violence to disrupt the

classes of all professors who did not do certain things in
agreement with their organizational policies.
MR. WULFs That would be a hard case, Mr., Chief Justice.

Q

It would be easier for sor;e than it would for

others, though, I suspect.
{Laughter.]
MR. WULFs

2 don't know if X would be hare arguing

that case, frankly, Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

What's the -—

MS, WIILF: But if the intention was that inimediatsly
upon recognition they were going to go out and disrupt classes
imminently, immediately go out and disrupt classes, professors

15
who did not agree with their politics, probably it could be
denied.
Q

What’s the difference between reserving the

right to use force and violence and announcing the affirmative
intent to use it?
MR. WOLF: The difference is that they might well be
tallied out of it, between the time that their organisation is
granted recognition and the time that they would otherwise
have engaged in disruptive acts.

And that's, as I said before,

is the whole purpose of the: First Amendment, is to allot? this
free kind of political dialogus and, I’m sure all of us here
hope, results in the abolition of the uso> of force.
Q

Well, v?ouldn’t the trier of facts again, the

triers of fact have a basis for an inference that, yes, we
will not use force and violence if you will agree with us
and adopt our views, but we will use force and violence if
you don’t agree with us.

Zsnt that the thrust of that kind of

an answer?
MR. WOLFs That may be the thru:it, sir, but l still
don' t think it8 ;s an adequate ground upon which to deny a
person, a citizen his right to exercise his First Amendment
rights.

Because that, too, notwithstanding his assertions

that h© might use it, would be a forbidden prior restraint,
because the State cannot make these kinds of predictions,
again, even if th© applicants do not renounce the use of

16
J. mean, there are people who would renounce the use

violencec

of violence, but some circumstances mighu emerge where they
would find themselves in the midst of it and participate in it.
But the point is that in this kind of situation
where it*s the exercise of First Amendment rights being made by
citizens, students in this particular case, the State has no
right, really, to even to catechise them about what their
views are about the use of violence.
Q

Just what First Amendment rights are you referring

to?
ME. mJLFs Wall, her© I’m referring specifically to
the right of speech ml the right of association.

Both of

them are involved in this ease.
Q

And it4 g your submission that a college or

university, once at least it allows soma student organisations
on the campus •"**
MR. WOLF: Which is th© case hare.
Q

*»- which is the case here, cannot bar any, at

least short of the hypothetical situation the Chief Justice
put to you in his question?
MR. NULFs Without reservation, yes, that’s what -•»
Q

y.n other words, the college or university could

say we want no secret societies on this campus, and we want
nc Greek**letter societies on this campus, or we want no
sicietites that discriminate against Jews on this campus? they

17
couldn't do that?
MR» WOLF:

X think it probably could, and probably

has banned organisations which themselves exercise the racial
or religious —
Q

Why?

MR. WULF:
Q

— discrimination»

Why could it, if you’re right?

MR. WULF:

Well, X don’t think that those are

political organizations.
Q

Well, let’s say they are political organizations.

MR. WULF:
Q

Those are essentially —

The Ku Klux Klan, for example?

Let's say the organisation is a neo-Fascist-

organization, we want no Jews, we want only white Arlans.
MR. WULF:

X don’t think that they could be banned at

all, on the same principle that ~~
Q

Uor the Ku Klux Klan?

MR. WULF:
Q

Nor the Ku Klux Klan, of course.

And how about a Greek-letter fraternity that

confines its membership to white Anglo-Saxon pretestants?
MR. WULF: Well, this Court —
Q

Or all Greek-letter fraternities.

MR. WULF: This Court, as a matter of fact, in 1915,
in the —
Q

X thought it had.

MR. WULF:

— Waugh case, said that a ban

In

13
Mississippi upon Greek-letter fraternities at the University of
Mississippi was not unconstitutional.

But there wasn't any

First Amendment claim mad© in that case.

It was an equal

protection claim and the duo process claim.

And I'm net so

sure that there wouldn’t be a different — well, that there
couldn't be a strong First Amendment argument made on behalf
of Greek-letter fraternities here today, compared to 50 or SO
years ago, whatever the case was.
But 1 don’t think that the Wauc-h case really has any
bearing here, because it was decided we!3 before —
Q

Not before the First Amendment .

MR. WUXiFs Well, before this Court articulated the
First Amendment in its modem guise, at all; and I think there
might well be a different decision in Wau.gh.
Q

Wall, XS15 was before the Court had applied the

First Amendment to the States, wasn’t it1
MR. WULFt That’s true, sir, yes;.
Q

Well, don’t you think discriminatory organiza­

tions might be viable because recognition involves the State,
the college extending the use of its own facilities for those
organisations?
MR. WULF:

That has, in fact, 1 think been the

argument to support the forbidding of such organizations on
college campuses.
Q

Because it docs involve recognition in the sense

19

that the State approves them, authorises them, it's an
affirmative authorisation to operate, and it’s making available
of State facilities for meetings and things?
MR. WULFs

Yes.

And it would be easier — although

X *m not so sure that you could press than same argument with
respect to the Ku Klux Klan on a State-supported university,
I think that the State-supported university has a First
Amendment duty to allow the formation on campus of a chapter
of the Ku Klux Klan,, whether it has the same duty to continue
to recognise a Greek-letter fraternity which discriminates
against Jews, blacks„ and every minority group; 1 don't know.
I'm not prepared to argue that case this morning,
Q

Do you think the State could furnish facilities,

furnish the chapter house for a white Anglo-Saxon organisation?
MR. WULF;
Q

Of a Greak-letter social organisation?

Well, whatever you want to Gall it.

MR. WULFs Well, I think there*u a distinction to be
drawn between organisations which are political, as difficult
as that might bo to define.
Q

Well, this is the right of association in the

sense that it*s a discussion organisation? they learn, it's
part of the whole educational process.
MR. WULFs That was the argument Waugh made here,
of course, unsuccessfully in 1915, and perhaps a successor
would make it equally unsuccessful now; but 1 think, without

20
being able right now to draw the distinction, I think there is
an arguable distinction between a group which is arguably
political, like SDS, and a group which in predominantly socialf
like the Greek —
Q

And who is to decide thatV

MR. WOLF:
Q

It's not for us to decide that?

Ml* WJLFt
that,

Well, 1 really ~

—■ I really don't know who would docide

1 really don't know at this time.

1 think this Court

Q

Well, if they're political, they're political.

Q

Well, isn't the right of association extended

tc others than political organisations?
MR. WlfLF:

That is, and that's why 1 feel I'm

getting myself into a thicket by trying to argue the fraternity
case, when it*a really not the case before us.

And because

when 1 say that Waugh, would foe argued differently here, the
&CLU might in fact be the group that would be arguing it here,
because there might well foe enough of an associatione! right
to justify a very strong First Amendment claim on behalf of
Greek-letfeer fraternities.

And although I'm talking in terms
i

of distinctions,, it may be that I might end upibelieving there
aren't any viable distinctions between social and political
groups.
X think the right to associate in social organisations
is no less important- than the right to associate in political

21
organi, sat ions.
Q
say.

40?

about .secret societies?

They just wouldn't

In such a hearing as you had here, they’d say:

We’re

sorry,- we can’t answer any of your questions because we're a
secret society.
MR. WOLF: Well, the petitioners here, begging your
pardon, sir, didn't say that.

But if it were a secret society;

I think that there is probably some duty as —- some initial
duty which the petitioners hers follow, to disclose what the
purpose of the organisation is.
Q

blow, what if they just said, We're against all

force and violence, but beyond that we can’t tell you anything
about our purposes or our reason for existence, because we're
a secret society.
MR. WULF: And they're seeking recognition on a college
campus?
Q

Yes, they are.

And there are many secret

societies on various campuses, as you know.
MR. WOLF:

I think. — wall, I'm really not familiar

with those secret societies on campus which you refer to.
Q

Well, they're secret ? that“s the reason youe re

not.

*

[Laughter. jl
MR. WOLF:
secret
(

I rea-Iy can't believe that they are so

perhaps you're talking about Skull and Bones, of

22
which X have a vague — X don’t know if that8s one of them or
not.

X think Yale has one or two secret societies.

But I

really can’t believe that the officers at Yale don’t know what
those secret societies are up to»

I think they have a right to know.

X don't think

that a student group has the right to official recognition by
a college or university unless they disclose -Q

Well? ell the Greek-”letter fraternities and

sororities have elements of secret societies, if X’m not
mistaken.
MR. WULFt
Q

Yes, but ~,

And many universities haves barred them from

thslr campusesv in recent years.
Q

Mr, Wulf, X’m surprised you haven’t really

challenged this whole process of accrediting.

You don’t

challenge — apparently you haven’t challenged the right of the
State to have rules for recognition, to go through this
procedure.
MR. WULFs
Q

Kof we haven’t.

And you don’t challenge the standards they

use.
MR. VIUXiFg

It’s not challenged in this --- no, no,

it’s not challenged in this case, and we don’t — well, we
don’t challenge the standards here.

Well, there really weren’t

any standards, because that part of the college rule

23
Q

But you. think a State may go through the

procedure of making organisations tell about themselves?
MR. WTJLFs

I don't take the position here that a

university has to give blanket recognition to groups which
want to function as student organizations, which invoke the
-- which use the name of the college on which they’re
organised,

no.

I think there's probably that minimal obliga­

tion by student groups, or minimal right by the universities
for purposes of/regulation, or simply to know ~~ the regulation
really is a time, place, and matter regulation. They have a
right to require these student organisations to be formally
recognized so that they can distribute the limited facilities
of the university on an equitable basis.
Q

incidentally, Mr. Wulf, of course you're talking

only about publicly supported institutions?
MR. WULF:
Q

Yes.

But Connecticut State, as x understand it,

didn't actually prohibit this organization from existing on the
campus, it simply refused to give it affirmative recognition,
didn't it?
MR. WULF:

Ho, in this case, without recognition,

this organisation, and according to the respondents any
organization, simply could not function as an organisation on
the campus.
Q

But the membership in it wasn't a grounds for

24
suspicion or e&plusion from the school, was it?
M2. WOLFs No, bat they simply couldn’t function in

their organisational role on the campus.

They could not meet,

in fact the record reflects a meeting that these petitioners
— these very petitioners held, after the initial district
court decision, in order to discuss what they would do next.
And they met in a campus snack bar.

And they were immediately

served with a. typewritten notice by the dean to disperse,
because they said that they were meeting as the formal SDS
group, and since they were not recognized they could not meet,

even there in the coffee shop.
So denial here -— they could, probably be members of
SDS somewhere else, but that doesn’t serve their purposes as
members of the community of Central Connecticut State College»
They want to be able to function on the campus as a group,
use‘the school facilities, and talk to their fallow students
as an organised political organisation.
Q

Mr. Wulf, X think you mentioned at the outset

that these student organizations had access to some college
cr student funds.

What did you have in mind there?

MR. WULF* Well, the only thing in the record is, at

the first meeting of the Student Affairs Committee, in the
Appendix at page 95, one of the questions is:
funds from Studeat Government?"

"Would you seek

And the answer is “Yes”.

So therefore X assume that recognized organizations are entitled

25
to seek funds from Student Government.

But that's all that

appears .in the record.
Our basic claim is that in this case there is no
reference at all in the hearing, in the record about these
petitioners, it’s all about SDS.

But it’s these petitioners

who are making the claim to function as a political organisa­
tion on this campus.
We think that the refusal on this record was a
prior restraint based entirely on guilt by association.

And

1 must say that the version of the First amendment urged upon
you by the respondents and their friends in court is — would
be so severely radical a departure from normal judicial
standards of First Amendment law as articulated by this Court
over the years, that I urge you to reject their version.
And X would like to save a few minutes for rebuttal,
your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well, Mr. Wulf.
Mr. Ahern.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF F. MICHAEL AHERN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. AHERN3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may if please the

Court:
Under the verbal assault of all the high-sounding
rhetoric of the past several years concerning the First
Amendment rights of students, to wear their hair long, to

28
express their political views, and to demonstrate, 2 fear we
may well be losing sight of the purpose of the educational
process,
And I would like to restate it.

The primary purpose

of educational institutions at all levels, we submit, is to
provide the best education possible to the students, not to
provide a platform for the expression of political views by a
few students.
The faculty members are hired to teach their
academic specialties, not to radicalise and politicize the
students, And the students who voluntarily enter the educational
community should do so to learn and not to attempt to
influence their fellow students to accept their own political
philosophies.
Generally speaking, the vast majority of students
enter the college community with an understanding that the
president and the de&ns are in charge.

And they have the

obligation to exercise their authority, to maintain an
educational climate that is conducive to learning.,

Indeed,

every student is entitled to expect that the administrators
will so operate the college that he will get a full measure,
full educational measure for every dollar of tuition expended.
This moans that any disruption cf classes or interference
with the educational process cannot be tolerated or condoned.
The campus strikes and disruptions of the last few

21
years, which have been led by a small minority of radical

students, are to be deplored, because they cheated the majority
of students out of the opportunity to attend classes, wasted
the examination preparation by the students, because the exams
were never held, and even cancelled or postponed commencement
exercises.
%

And 1 submit that at least this situation was partly
caused by the college administrators refusing or being
unwilling to exercise their authority to quell disturbances
at the outsat.
However, X submit the administrators are not
entirely to blara®.

The rash of decisions of the federal

courts, following the so-called arrival of the Constitution
on the campus, has had a chilling effect on its responsible
administrators? almost ©vary administrative decision which
is made for the purpose of securing order or controlling
student conduct on the campus is immediately challenged in
the courts and becomes the subject of an extensive and timeconsuming legal process before it is resolved.
This case, 2 submit, exemplifies the difficulties
which college officials have faced and continue to face in
attempting to administer the colleges throughout the country.
When ...every administrative decision is escalated into a
constitutional issue, and. a. confrontation between a few
students and the authorities.

28
The petitioners, in the instant case have arrogantly
sought recognition of their local chapter of Students for a
Democratic Society on their terras.

When the president and

his deans refused to accede to those terms, the petitioners
immediately raised the spectre of interference with their
constitutional rights of free speech and free association, and
sought the aid of the federal courts to impose their will on
the adralnistraters.
The precise issue in this case has never bean con­
sidered by this Court previously.

That issue, we submit, is

whether the denial of- official campus recognition to the local
chapter of Students for a Democratic Society at Central
Connecticut State College violated in any v;ay the individual
constitutional rights of the petitioners in this case.

We

submit that it did not.
Without demeaning in the least the importance of
that issue, I submit it pales to insignificance in the light
of the greater issue that is involved here.

That is, who

shall govern the colleges of this country, the students or
the college officials?
As the last Justice Black noted in his dissent in
Tinker

,

it is nothing but wishful thinking to imagine that

young, immatura students will not soon believe it.ia fchsiir
right to control the schools.
And 1 think those words were prophetic.

29
Recognising that there are no legal precedents for
their'position, the petitioners here have advanced the
proposition that a college community is somewhat like a
municipality and should he considered as ouch by the Court
in applying tile protection of the Constitution.

If this

Court accepts the petitioners' theory, it will mean that a
student entering an educational community has an unfettered
right to exercise his First Amendment rights of free speech
and free association on the campus, and —
Q

Mr. Ahern, do you recognise the fact that this

school is governed by the Fourteenth Amendment?
MR. AHERNs

Yes, 1 do, Justice Marshall.

That reasonable — excuse me?

Q

It is my understanding from Mr. Wulf's argument

that he concedes that a college is perfectly free to deny
recognition to all political organisations’, and he says that
if you grant it to one yon must grant it to all; but X would
think, quite consistent with what you're saying, that a collage,
if it didn't want any of this, could deny recognition to all
political organisations.

Mil. AHERN:

X think it could deny political —

campus recognition to all political organisations.

I don't

think they can stop political organisations.
Q

Well —

MR. AHERN* But they don't have to grant official

30
campus recognition to such organizations.
Q

Well, his claim, is, General, that unless there

ia campus recognition, there can't be a meeting a-y place on
the campus, of any such organisation? and Appendix 16 and 17
seems to support that, view, talking about the meeting of
—«* the proposed meeting of November 6.
MR. AHERNf
Q

I think — I think —

To take place in Devils5 Den.

MR. AHERN;

— I think that notice has been

misrepresented to the Court, if it please, Mr. Stewart —
Q

"Such meeting may not take place in the

Devils* Den of the Student Center nor in or on any other
property of the college since the CCSC-SDS is not a duly
recognised college organisation."
MR. AHERN: That’s correct. Justice Stewart, but you
didn’t read the first paragraph of the notice, which says —
or the memorandum which states;

"Notice has been received by

this office of a meeting of the CCSC-SDS on Thursday, November
6 at 7s00 o'clock at the Devils’ Don."
Q

Right.

MR, AHERN; That is altogether different than a casual
meeting of a group of students to discuss the president's
denial of recognition. This is a local chapter being called
to a meeting to discuss the denial by President James of
recognition for them, for their chapter.

31
Well, in their brief, in the brief for the

0

petitioners, it is alleged that official recognition is a
prerequisite to meeting anywhere on campus.
MR. AHSRSf: As an organisation.
Q

Yes.

MR. AHERN: That is correct.
Q

And you don’t deny that, do you?

MR. AHERN:
y

No, I don’t, Your Honor.

So, to that extent at least, First Amendment

rights, as they're called, are implicated, aren't they?
So that in the absence of official recognition this group
couldn’t meet

—

MR. AHERN;
Q

Well, the --

~~ anywhere on the property of the university,

of the college.
MR. AHERN: Well, 1 think there's a distinction,
Justice Stewart, between the organisation meeting as an
organisation and individuals meeting together to have a
discussion, political or otherwise.
This is a prior, a previously announced meeting of
this local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society.
Q

Well, 1 was just referring to that particular

meeting, as seeming to confirm the general statement.

I was

asking you about the general statement.
In the absence of official recognition, no organise

32
fcion has any status, it's just —*
ME. AHERN:
Q

That is correct.

on the campus of this college.

Yes,

MR. AHERN: There is no statute on the campus of the
college.
Q

And cannot meet on the property, on the campus?

MR, AHERN: That’s correct.
Q

As an organization.

So that, if ten people are meeting in the chapel

it's all right?
MR. AHERN: That's correct.
Q

But if ten people are meeting in the chaps1 as

the Students for Mo Action, they couldn’t meet unless they were
approved?
MR. AliEKy ?

You mean a no action organisation?

That's correct, Justice Marshall, that’s —
Q

The same group; they couldn’t meet?

MR. AHERN: That's correct.
Q

Why?

MR. AHERN: For a vary simple reason.

By previously

announcing the meeting of the local chaptered SOS, they’re
not only meeting -- those people who ere interested in
discussing this matter are not only meeting, but they are also
notifying the other 7,000 students on the campus that they will
have an officia:, meeting of an organisation which will discuss
a particular idea

33

Q

Well, the Students for No Action, they don't

like to meet privately, they like to have people around*
MR. AHERN: Well, then, they should seek official
campus recognition.
Q

And if it’s denied, they can’t meet?

MB. AHERN:

Xf it’s denied on the basis that they

are affiliated with a national organisation that advocates
violence and disruption, X think that’s a legitimate prohibition*
Q

Mr. Ahern, —

Q

Apart from the fact that all of them are

members or sons and daughters of the most respectable people
in the world?

Just because the name is a name that the school

doesn't like?
MR. AHERNs

X don't think it’s a question of the

school not liking it, X think it's a question of —
Q

Well, you don't —you don’t see any First

Amendment, problem in the right to associate together, do you?
MR. AHERN: As an organisation, no.

Not in this

instance, in the peculiar aspects of the college campus.
Q

So that v;hen you decided whether or not it’s

an organisation, then that takes it out of the First
Amendment?
MR. AHERN: Well, 1 question whether or not the
SDS national organisation is basically a political organiza­
tion

34
Q

Well,, is the — are they in this case?

MR. AHERNs
Q

Pardon me?

The national organisation in this case?

MR. AESRNs They’re not a party to this case, no.
Q

Is there anything in the record about it?

MR. AHERN: There's something in the record concerning
the national SD£ , yes.
Q

One section which said they wanted to be

affiliated with it, that's all?
MR. AHERN: That's correct.

That’s right, Mr. Justice

Marshall.
Q

And that's enough?

MR. AHERN: Certainly that opens up the area of
Q

No, no, no.

Do you have any other reason not

to let them in?
MR. AHERN:
Q

1 don't follow you.

You mean as

Do you have any other reason not to recognise

this group?
;

MR. AHERN:
Q

Yes.

What's the other reason?

MR. AHERN:

Because the petitioners have never

divulged the purposes and aims of the national, which they
adopt, the organisation.
q

Well, diet they divulge the aims and purposes

of their organisation?

35
MR. AHERN: That’s correct.
Q

And that's who you’re dealing with?

MR. AHERN; That’s who we're dealing with, but the
purposes and aims, as they set forth in their statement of
purpose, have a different perspective when they affiliate them­
selves with a national organisation.
Q

So you’re really keeping the. national organisation

out?
MR. AHERN:

No, we’re keeping a local chapter of

the national organisation out.

Unless it determines and tells

the administrators what aims and purposes of the national
association they adopt for their own.
Q

Suppose they don’t know?

MR. AHERN: Well

,

then, how can they organis®1a group

if they don’t know what their aims and purposes are going to
be?
Q

Ara you looking to the future or are you looking

to the present?
MR. AHERN: We’re looking to the present.
G

Didn’t they tall you what their organisation

was?
MR. AHERN: They told us that they were a local
chapter of the SDS -- the national SDS.
Q

That’s right.

MR. AHERN: So that I think the president of the

36
college could --Q

a hey

ware denied their right to meat together

as a local chapter of SDS?
MR. AHERN;

Q

1 didn't follow that# Mr. Justice —

"hey were denied the right to meet together?

MR. AHERN; As a local chapter of the SDS# that is
correct# on the campus.

Q

And you don't see any First Amendment problem?

MR. AHERN;
Q

Mr. Ahern.

MR, AHERN:

Q

Ho# I do not.

Yes# sir.

Supposing these petitioners# after they had

bean turned down# went to the rooms of one of them# say# in
university housing, and wanted to discuss it, would they have
faced any disciplinary sanction for doing that?
MR. AHERN;

No# they would not# Justice Rehnquist.

As I stated to Justice Marshall# there was a previous notice
of a meeting of the local chapter of SDS at the Devils' Den,
at a particular time on a particular day, and that is the
meeting that Detin Judd and Dean Clow attended# or visited# and
told them they could not meet as a local chapter of SDS on
the campus.
Q

Mr. Ahern# referring to pages 94 and 95 that

we were discussing# after Mr. Wulf focused somewhat on them#
— you'll have, to watch that microphone# it’s very sensitive

37
MR. MESH:
a

Yes, sir.

Was that the only meeting or hearing or inquiry

or were there others of this kind?
MR. MERE?: There were two meetings of the — you're
talking now of the Student Affairs Committee,
Q
MR.
94 I think is

The student committee, yes.
AHERN: There were two meetings, the dateon page
incorrect, I think it was a meeting of October

2nd, 1969, at which the initial application was presented, and
petitioner Healy was questioned.

That meeting was postponed

until a later time, to give the petitioners, as I understand
it, an opportunity to present a statement to the committee
as to their affiliation with the national SDS.
At that latter meeting, a statement was read into
the record, X

believe, stating that although they call them--

selves a local chapter of SDS, they

would not be underthe

dictates or influence of the national organization.
Thereafter, the committee conditionally approved
their application.
We submit that the petitioners5 attempt to •—
Q

Were there any further inquiries about whether

they would or would not follow a policy of disruption or
■violence?
MR. AHERN: There was -—
Q

Was that passage on 95 the only thing in the

38

record about —■
MR, AEERN*

No, the court-ordered administrative

hearing, the minutes of these minutes were introduced into
the record without objection by petitioner Healy or counsel,
and petitioner HeaXy was present at the hearing at the time
they were introduced.
Q

And made no other statement?
MR. AHERNt

Made no other statement, and did not

object to their introduction at that time, as t understand
the record.
Q

So, as the record stands, this is the organise

tions's response to those inquiries, final response to them?
MR. AHERNs That is correct, Justice White.
We submit that the petitioners' attempted treatment
of this case as a prior restraint case is specious.

The

respondents have never restrained the. individual petitioners
in the exercise of their individual rights of free speech or
free association, and the record is devoid of any such
indication.
All they have dene is to refuse to give the
administrative stamp of approval to the local chapter of SDS,
which, we submit, is perfectly proper under the circumstances
of this case.

In each of the federal court cases in which
administrative recognition was required to be given to the

39
American Civil Liberties Union, or a local chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union» that is' the Radford College
ease and the jfoiyerzgity of Southern Mississippi case» both of
which are cited in all of our briefs, the court cited the aim
and purposes of the American Civil Liberties Union, the
national organisation, in considering whether the local
chapters would be disruptive influences on the campus.
So we submit it was reasonable for Dr. James to
considar the aims and purposes of the national SDS in
reviewing the petitioners’ application for a local chapter
of SDS at Central Connecticut State College.
The national SDS and its chapters, in 1968 and 969,
had instigated and participated in violence and disruption on
tha campuses of the country and caused millions of dollars
of damage to property and personal injuries to students,
faculty, and administrators.
In the face of that track record of the national
SDS movement, the petitioners could hardly claim an innocuous
purpose.
Q

On that score, this connection with national

movement, I notice on page 90 and before and after 90 are
these exhibits, committee Exhibit No. 1, et cetera, which
quote leaders of the SDS as saying "We will have to destroy
at times, even violently, in order to and the establishment
power, and that we are going to build a guerrilla force, and

40
we ars engaging in sedition.*
Now, was there presentation of these documents to
the applicants for this recognition?
of the record before that committee?

Were these matters part
«

MR. AHERN? These documents were introduced — no*
these documents we re introduced at the court-structured
administrative hearing, which was conducted by Deem Judd at
the order of the district court judge, Judge Clarie.

So that

this documentation was not before the student-faculty
committee.

It didn't corae into the record until tha court-

structured administrative hearing.
Q

Then this was part of the basis of the district

judge'© decision as distinguished from the faculty of the
SChOOl?

MR. &KERM:

This — initially, when this matter was

heard by the district judge, the judge raised the ambiguity,
which appeared on the face of the application, and sent the
matter back for an administrative hearing, to clear up the
ambiguity.

At that administrative hearing, which the court,

ordered, this documentation was submitted through the Hearing
Officer
Q

Then the applicants had an opportunity to meet

it and explain it, is that it?
MR. AHERN: The applicants, one of the applicants or
one- of the petitioners, llaaly was present at the two

administrative hearings, accompanied by counsel-. by legal

counsel; th
Q

correct, Mr. Chief Justice Burger.
And how close in point of time would that

colloquy which appears on Appendis*: 95, in which some student,
one of the petitioners apparently, said that they would
not know whether they would use violence or not?
MR. AHERN:

I think the Student Affairs Committee

masting was in October of 1969, and the court-structured
administrative hearing took place the following May? so it
would he approximately five months.
As this Court is aware, administrative decisions are
not made in a vacuum, and we submit that Dr. James, who had
the ultimate responsibility for maintaining a peaceful campus,
was also aware of the recent violent history of the SDS, and
very properly took it into consideration in reaching his
determination that the local chapter of SDS would be a harmful
presence on the campus.
At the court-ordered administrative hearing, which
was Intended by the court, to allow petitioners to present
evidence to resolve the ambiguity in their application, the
petitioners consistently refused, on advice of counsel, to
contribute anything constructive to the record, except a
statement that the local chapter would not be affiliated with
the structure of the national SD8.
'.?he statement did not contain those aims and purpose

of fcJie national SDS, which the local chapter adopted as their
ownj nor did it contain a statement disavowing the violent and
disruptive tactics of the national organisation, nor did it
contain a statement that the local chapter would not disrupt
the campus or engage in violence*
On the other hand, the material submitted by the
administration substantiated the fact that under the national
constitution of. the SDS, the national organisation controlled
the chapter.

Also reproductions of local and national'

membership cards clearly evidenced a continuing relationship
between local and national offices, and also indicated
joint membership recordkeeping systems*
In that connection, X have made reference in sny
brief, and I*d like to do so orally here, to the fact that
in printing tho single Appendis a one-page exhibit, Hearing
Officer’s Exhibit G, has been spread over three pages in the
Appendix, and. also the overprint on the membership applications,
indicating which portion of the dual application form was for
national office records and which portion was for local
chapter records, has bean deleted.
So that the effect of that exhibit is lost in its
printing in the Appendix.

2 would therefore urge the Court to look at the
original exhibit in order that the respondents! purpose in
submitting it in evidence can be deduced.

43
Or, if the Court would like, I-will make reproduc­
tions for the use of the Court,,
Q

That might be a little more convenient, if you

will first give a copy to Mr. Wulf.
MR. AHERN: A copy was given to Mr. Wulf at the time
the single Appendis: was printed, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

Well, would you say that if an organisation is

asked, What is your policy about disruption, and the organisa­
tion says, None of your business? that it could bo denied
recognition?
MR. AHERN:

Justice White. I don't think the college

president is required to buy a pig in a poke.
Q

Yes.

So your answer is yes, they could be

denied recognition?
MR. AHERNs

If they don't succinctly state to the

administrator just what —

Q

Disavow —

MR, AHERN:

-- their aims and purposes are, and if

they are affiliated with an organisation that's —
Q

Well, let's assume there's nothing about
*

affiliation.

They just — and the question is;

Do you

anticipate that you would use violence and disrupt classes?
and the answer is, None of your business.
MR. AHERN:
recognition.

I think they can be denied campus

Do you fchirJs this record is equivalent to that?MR* AHERNs

Yes, 1 do, Justice White.

The dissent below cites several eases, indicating
that the clear and present danger rule should be applied in
this case.

But we submit that the analysis of the case and

the issue in the case by the dissent below was erroneous*
Those cases cited

by the dissent dealt with the citizen?* s

relationship to society at large, while her© we are dealing
with the student's relationship in a voluntary community,
composed of students, faculty, and administrators*
The administrator — pardon me, the petitioners
advance the proposition in their brief that this ease gives
the court the opportunity to implant the First Amendment
firmly on the college campus.

We submit that the Constitution

has already been firmly entrenched on the college campus, and
a few radical students have used It, or, rather, abused itf
to spread violence and disruption.
What is needed is more, responsible administrative
leadership on the campus, not further restriction of
administrative authority in the name of constitutional freedom.
As we stated previously, what has caused the problems
on the campuses in prior years, we submit, has been the failure
of the authoriti.es to govern.

It would be indeed ironic if,

in the name of the petitioners* alleged right to administrative
support, of their so-called political program, this Court would

45
announce a rale that deprices school officials with backbone
to face up to their responsibilities, as the respondents in
this case, of any power to govern their institution.
This Court would be upholding the attack by a few
on the rights of academic freedom of the vast majority of
students.

Foe without the power to prohibit a campus

organisation, which he. reasonably believes to be hamful to
the academic climate of his college, the college president
might as well resign.
He would have no authority in the one area where it
really counts, that is, upholding the moral integrity of the
school.

Lacking the essential governing power, he would lack

the authority to protect the majority of students on the campus.
And lacking such support of the administration, those students
would have 210 means, save cumbersome and expensive legal
process, to insure their personal academic freedom.
So we submit that thus, in the name of freedom for the
few, would the freedom of all be compromised.
1 submit that the Court shoudl re-emphasise and re­

state in unequivocal terras the authority of the school
administrators to prescribe and control conduct in the schools,
and that, although the students do not leave their constitutions]
rights at the door, those rights may be curtailed and restricted
by reasonable rules and regulations.

lower federal courts, it is inevitable that a monolithic and
stultifying national uniformity will be judicially imposed
in the name of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Sins® the general terms' of the amendment contain
no concrete standards of decision for the great majority
of such suits, it is^predictable that the federal common law
of school discipline which would develop will reflect nothing
more than an amalgam of the eductional views of diverse
federal judges*, most of whom are suited to the task by neither
disposition nor competence.
It is in this spirit that we ask the Court to affirm
the judgment below.
Thank you.
Q

General Ahem, do you think the same standard

should apply to a college or university that apply to a public
high school?

You kept referring to schools.

We have here a

college.
ME. AHERN: Well, in view of the fact that the partieu
let case decided by this Court reached down, 1 think one of

the boys was eight years old —•
Q

Below the college level.

Down to the primary-

grades »
MR. AHERN:

Right.

— it would seem to me that a

college student has more perspicacity than an eight-year-old
in grammar school.

And, as the petitioners stated in their

brief, the recent decision of this Court, in Tilton, indicates
that college students are more mature and more able to
determine what is good for them.
Q

And you think, in considering the requirements

of the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, there
should be a difference in a college or university which has a
sort of & captive population, which is off somewhere in the
country, where all the students live on the campus, on the
one hand, that a distinction could and should be made between
t hat kind of institution, and an institution where the students
are only at the university for classes and go home and have
plenty of places and time available, off campus, for whatever
associational and speech rights they want to indulge in?
MR. AHERNs

1 don’t think that would be a basis for

distinction, I think the distinction as to the basis of age
would be more desirable.
Q

Yes.

Well, and the distinction would be

on-campus or off-campus, regardless of —
MR. AHERN: Well, off-campus —

48
-Q

Regardless, if

even if you had a situation

where if they wanted to organised at all it had to ba on
campus because the only thing off-campus would be woods and
mountains?

MR. AHERNs Well, the school administrators have no
control\of the students off the campus.
Q

1f.es, but there are campuses which, as I say,

have sort of a captive population,, where everybody lives on
campus, and where# by contrast# there is, as 1 gather this
place may be, in New Britain, Connecticut, where many of the
students live at home or at least off campus — is that
correct?
MR. AHERN: That5s correct# Justice Stewart.
Q

Do you think that — you*re not suggesting

that there should fca any flexibility at all?
MR. AHERN: Well, when you say that lfm not suggesting
any flexibility, I think the college has to make the
reasonable rules and regulations as to activities on the
campus, whether the students are living on the campus or
whether they are day_yhops and come on the campus during the
day.

But their activities on the campus should be the subject

of reasonable rules and regulations, otherwise you’d have
chaos on the campus.
So that X think as far as the First Amendment rights
of student® are concerned,

t

that they want to make a speech.

This position of the State that you’ve just

suggested, would that interfere with the right of the
individuals up before the Court,, and any of their friends,
to pass out leaflets saying "this evening at eight" or "tomorrow
evening at eight we will raeet down at Maury’s place, in the
basement, © £ £ campusts ?
MR* AHERN:

I don’t see how we could stop it.

They’re not using the campus for a meeting place.
Q

They using Maury’s place as off campus?

MR. AHERN: At this point it’s off campus.
Q

Right.

MR. AHERN: And it also allows women in the bar.

Now.

MR. M1ERN:

Now.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Wulf, you have just

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MELVIN L. WOLF, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WULFi

I would just like to close by saying that

Mr. Ahern’s argument confirms our fundamental claim that the

50
respondent is not arguing this case,, he's arguing some other

case .>
•There’s nothing —
Q

Well, Mr» Wulf, assume that your organisation*

when asked about their policies, including the policies with
respect to whether they would engage in violence or disruption
said, lions of your business.
ME. WULFs

I don’t think that would make any

difference, Mr. Justice White.
Q

1 *-~

Well, 1 understood a while ago that you thought

the secret society could be forced to state its purposes.
MR. WULF s

I think that they have & minimal

responsibility to describe the purpose of the organisation —
Q

Well me this, is it your purpose to engage in

violent disruption? None of your business.
MR. WULF;

t£ they have made a prima facie showing

on their application that they intend to engage in protective
political activity, they cannot be asked that question, if
they don’t volunteer it.
volunteer to answer it.

They were asked hero and they did
But if they refuse to answer it, I

think that the fundamental system and the notion still
require that they be granted recognition and that the
administration abide the event, if any, of illegal conduct.

Q

Well, Mr. Wulf, in relation to what Mr. Justice

White has put to you, page 95, 1 think it was, in the Appendi:-;

51
would appear to be an answer. None of your business, 'uttered
in a more circumspect way, would you agree with that?
MR, WOLF:

No, X think that that was a very shorthand

way of expressing a philosophical view that rejects non­
violence .

I dcr 't think that it was a reply that said, None

of your business,

I mean, certainly to try to engage people

in a philosophy of violence in that shorthand kind of way is
never going to fee successful.
But I think — I disagree that it was a response that
said, None of your business,

1 think they answered it.

And

they certainly didn’t say that they didn't believe in violence,
and to that extent they were terribly candid.

They said,

"We can't say under acme conditions that we might not do it."
But that is not ample reason, under First Amendment law,to
prohibit the exercise of their First Amendment rights,
The State has tc wait and see.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very wall, Mr. Wulf.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Ahern.
The case is submitted.
[Whwareupon, at 11:58 o'clock, a.ra. , the case was
submitted.}
