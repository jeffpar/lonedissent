CHIEF JUSTICE BURCERs

Next we will hear argument

in the matter of Oliver T. Fein against the Selective Service
System Bocal Board No. 7.
Mr. Standard, you may proceed.
MR. STANDARD:

I would like to introduce David

Rosenberg, who worked on the brief in this case.
This case is here by writ of certiorari to review
a decision of the Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit which
affirmed the finding of the District Court that it had
consistent with the standards of 10(b) (3) of the Military
Selective Service Act of 1967 no jurisdiction to review
answers of the Selective Service System which removed a
conscientious objector classification given out to petitioner
by his local board.
I should alert the Court at the outset to the
fact that since the briefing in this case on September 28 of
this year Congress has enacted a new statute.

You will find

only cursory reference in our reply brief filed on Friday of
the week just passed to that statute.

That statute will

become, I think, cf considerable prominence as the argument
unfolds.
What Congress has done is to suggest that it is now
its policy that a fair hearing shall be given to a registrant.
I will read the pertinent portion of the brief.

"It is hereby declared to be the purpose of
this section to guarantee to each registrant
asserting a claim before a local or an appeal
board a fair hearing consistent with the informal
and expeditious processing which is required by
Selective Service cases."
It then goes on to recite four particular standards
which it suggests should be the basis for -QUESTION:

What is the citation of that?

MR. STANDARD:

It is Public Law 92-129, Your Honor,

and its effective date is September 28, 1971, just two weeks
ago.
QUESTION:

Public Law —

MR. STANDARD:

Public Lai-/ 92-129 growing out of

H.R. 6531, the same session.
It then recites four particular instances which
shall be standards used by the President or the Selective
Service System to create reasonable rules and regulations.
Two of those standards are of prominence in this case because
in effect it is the enshrining by Congress of the due process
arguments which we have made in our brief.
two.

I will read those

They are brief.
"Each registrant shall be afforded the
opportunity to appear in person before the local
or any appeal

board of the Selective Service

5

System to testify and present evidence regarding his
status„"
The second applicable regulation, statutory division;,
is:
"In the event of a decision adverse to the
claim of a registrant the local or appeal board
making such decision shall upon request furnish
each registrant a brief written statement of the
reasons for its decision."
QUESTION:

Mr. Standard, would you say that that

is --MR. STANDARD:

I am sorry, Your Honor» I said that

cursory mention was made in petitioner's reply brief —
QUESTION:

But not the text as you read it.

MR. STANDARD:

You will find the text, I believe,

on page 2 of the reply brief.

At least, the text of the

provisions I have just read to you.
The facts are simple and they are not in dispute
essentially.

The plaintiff is a doctor of medicine.

In

September of 1967, while occupationally deferred as an intern
at Western Reserve Medical School, holding a 2-A classification,
he wrote to his board and he indicated to his board that
«

moral convictions are empty unless substantiated by moral
acts, and he asked his board to send him a 150 conscientious
objector form

6

QUESTION:

How long has he been an M.D.?

MR. STANDARDs

He completed his internship in June,

1967 -- I am sorry, 1968 in June, and he has been a doctor
since then.

He is now 31 years of age.

QUESTION:
three years.

So he has been a licensed physician for

Am I correct in my impression that prior to

that time he evinced an interest in political science and had
even registered at Columbia some place?
MR. STANDARD:
QUESTION:

Yes, that is correct.

And then reversed his direction and went

to medical school.
MR. STANDARD:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

When would you fix as the time that his

claim ripened?
MR. STANDARD:

Well, I would say it ripened at the

moment when he wrote to his board, although it is quite clear
— and his application makes quite clear in terms of the
length of time that it took him to get to that position —
I would say that the day you would fix it would be the day
when he wrote to his board in 1967 saying my claim has
matured.
No\'7, the history of the registrant in this regard
is quite pertinent.

The registrant has — and it is reflected

in the CO application — a traditional Lutheran background.
QUESTION:

In that connection, which Lutheran

7
church?

There are many.
MR. STANDARD;

Well,, I don't suggest that he has

ever been a formal member of the Lutheran church in recent
years.

I cannot tell you which — I am not a Lutheran, my­

self, Your Honor.

I never thought to inquire, Mr. Justice

Blackmun.
QUESTION:

You don’t know whether it is the Missouri,

Wisconsin, Lutheran Church of America —
MR. STANDARD;

I am sorry, I do not know that, but

the petitioner doesn’t rely on a particular sect that he or
his family may have been a member of in coming to his
conscientious objector position.
He refers to early training by his parents, early
and intensive training by his parents in the church tradition.
He refers to his matriculation at a Quaker college, to his
activity in the civil rights movement, and finally to the
vocation of medicine which for him reflected a vocational
method of acting out his views vtxth regard to nonviolence.
His application in response to the question "Do you
believe in a supreme being” was answered in the affirmative.
In addition to the strict religious basis for his
application, however, he referred to a broader moral standard.
He believes that man lives in the community among men and
one cannot take life under any circumstance.
It is certainly clear, although I do not think it

8
is an issue in this case because the posture of this case at
this moment, as X understand it, is that there is no question
about the propriety of his classification of processing, but
what we are here doing is attacking an appellate regulatory
procedure which is with due process violations.

The application

which he filed with the board, however, between September and
November of 1967 was supported by reference letters from
clergymen, from the dean of the medical school, from colleagues
and from friends, all of them attesting to two things.
First, to his sincerity; and, second, to the nature
of his belief.
In November of 196 7, Fein appeared for an intsrviev?
before his local board.

At that interview, he was canvassed

rather carefully in detail as were his reference letters
with regard to the nature of his religious belief and to
whether he would perform alternative service.
alternative noncombatant service.

That is,

Fein unequivocally took

the position at that time that he would perform any work in
the national interest anywhere in the United States.

Ke

expressed the hope that he might use his capacity as a
physician to aid in some activity, preferably in a ghetto
concentrated area, and in addition, parenthetically, he said,
"My wife is a physician and if we could find a place to work
together that would please us, but it is not necessary.'1
He was then asked about the nature of his religious

9
belief.

Unequivocally he asserted a belief stated in both

traditional supreme being and in what I suppose we would now
call in shorthand in safer terms, relying on the moral
imperative.
The board, in response to the 2-A classification
which the registrant then held, said we would not find you
a conscientious objector at this time.

We will retain you in

your 2-A classification, and it said we will give you a right
to appeal when and if the moment ever comes.
Well, that moment did come.

In February of 1968

the registrant was reclassified 1-A from his 2-A classification
and in timely fashion he asked his board for another personal
interview.

The board granted that interview on May 22.
In anticipation of that, interview,the registrant

filed with the board a series of answers to questions which
appeared to be troubling the board at its early in November
interview, particularly those with regard to the position
of the Lutheran Church.
You will find I believe annexed to Government's
brief at page — I don't have the citation, I am sorry.
The substance of the second meeting before the
board was similar to the first.
perform alternative service.

They asked if he would

He said, "Of course, I would."

They asked the nature of his religious belief and a series of
questions which ha apparently» answered satisfactorily because

10

his board on that day, May 22, 1968, gave him his conscientious
objector classification.
Ten days later the State Director appealed to the
/

New York State Appeal Board.

Prooedurally, what the State

Director did was to notify not the registrant of that fact
but notify the Appeal Board and the Local Board, and it is
the Local Board which in turn notifies the registrant.

As

soon as the registrant became aware that there was an appeal
taken after a finding by this Local Board, that phenomena
which is your friends and neighbors, your community, in
theory if not in fact, the registrant wrote to the Appeal
Board and said, "I don't understand this.

I am not only

bewildered and surprised but I ttfould like an opportunity to
get a statement of reasons from the State Director or from
the Appeal Board.

I don't know what it is that he has in

mind when he in effect reverses all appeals from a finding
of X-A classification.
There was no pertinent response to that letter.
A second letter.

Registrant inquires of the Appeal Board

what are the issues?

What are the reasons?

No pertinent

response from the Appeal Board.
Registrant then says, 8,X would like a chance to
appear before the Appeal Board or at least to rebut somehow
issues which I am in the dark about."

No pertinent response

except for a minute of action dated in July which in effect

II
revoked his conscientious objector classification by
unanimous vote and returned him to a 1-A classification.
Wow by Selective Service regulation a registrant
has no right to appeal to the Presidential Appeal Board
unless there has been a dissent below.

The registrant

nevertheless wrote to the then Selective Service Director,
General Hershey, and described his case and asked the good
offices of General Hershey to ask the Appeal Board to review
this case.
General Hershey did so, although he made no
recommendation of any kind.

Although neither he nor the

Appeal Board -- now the Presidential Appeal Board -- never
stated what issues there were present as a reason for the
appeal, never stated any reasons — that is, the Appeal Board
never stated any reasons.
Following transmission of the file, the Presidential
Appeal Board unanimously stating no reasons found that the
registrant should be retained in a 1-A classification.

It

is important to remember, particularly in terms of the issue
of standing to raise this question, that in this period two
tilings occurred.

In the period of May through October.

No. 1, the registrant was ordered to report for induction.
That notice report for induction, as it must by regulation,
was postponed during the appellate process and eventually
canceled.

In February, 1969 this action was brought in the

12
District Court, Southern District of New York.
never reached the merits of the case at all.

Judge Tyler
He never

reached the question of the constitutionality and due process
terms of the appellate regulatory system.

He expressed

uncertainty to be sure about the findings of this Court in
its procuring opinion in Boyd v. Clark, but said Clark v.
Gabriel controls.

10(b)(3) is a bar.

On appeal to the Court of Appeals there were three
decisions.
below.

Judge Blumenfeld sustained what Judge Tyler did

Namely, he said 10(b)(3) was a bar.

Judge Blumenfeld

suggested that merely because issues were framed in a legal
manner, that that would not permit us to avoid the questions
of classification on processing which he found that we
were attacking.
Let me repeat.

We are not here today, nor have

we been in any court, attacking the question of propriety
of classification in any manner.

We are rather attacking the

method used by this complex Selective Service regulatory
body.

We are attacking the standards -- or the lack of

standards -- in the sense that they never frame any issues.
A registrant is always in the dark.
QUESTION:

Specifically, you are attacking the

due process integrity of the administrative appeal process.
MR. STANDARDs

That is correct.

sure, to a certain result.

That led, to be

It led to a revocation.

13

But we are attacking the process only, not the
finding,

We are not doing what Congress has warned us against.

We are not introducing litigious interruption into the process.
What we are trying to do, in fact, is to avoid litigious
interruption of that process.

What we are trying to do is

to say, as Justice Steele said in the Weiner case where there
was a similar question in the propriety of an appellate
review by a State director, send it back to the Local Board,
let them know the reasons.
In fact, there are perhaps four or five eases in
which issues of similar construction of the appellate
regulatory system have been at issue.

One of them just a

year ago Mr. Justice Blackmun sat in, U.S. v, Cummins.
don't know if Your Honor recalls it.

I

There you concurred in

a finding that there was a violation of procedural due
process,.

The issue in that case is only slightly different

than in this case.

What has happened was that the registrant

had been the subject of an appeal by the State director and
there had been a number of reasons but he had never been
notified on what the State director's position was.
Now, I think that the statement of facts in this
case effectively states the due process argument.

I don't

want to burden the Court with reference to the cases which we
have briefed, which we feel are particularly relevant here.
I think this case can be disposed of on the merits — that

14
is, on the substantive merits

by referring to Simmons and

Gonzales and more general cases regarding due process such
as Goldberg v. Kelly.
Now we come to the procedural question, which is of
some importance.

It is our view that given the new statute

to which I have referred Congress has enshrined in effect
the constitutional standard which we have always argued was
implicit in the 1967 Act and we suggest that this case be
remanded to the Appeal Court, to the Selective Service System,
for processing consistent with the standard which we now know
and which we have always argued but which Congress has now
set as a standard,
QUESTION:

You are not suggesting that that statute

was by its terms or by implication retroactive, are you?
MR. STANDARD:

Well, that is a puzzle, Your Honor.

I can't pretend since the Act was effective on September 28
to have done any thorough research but I can refer Your Honor
to two cases quite apart from the retroactivity with regard
to other Selective Service registrants who are somewhere in
the process.

I don’t refer to them at all.

But with

regard to Fein, it has been — this Court has reflected
in U.S. v. Alabama, which you will find in 362 U.S. and in
Ciffron v. the U.S. which you will find in 318 that where
there is a change in the law between the court of original
jurisdiction's decision and the Appeal Court's decision, that

15
the new law applies, and we suggest that it applies here.
QUESTION;

In this case.

MR. STANDARDS
QUESTION:

In this case.

Even though the statute ■—

MR. STANDARD:

It applies to this petitioner.

There has been a change between —
QUESTION:

This case is still pending.

MR. STANDARD:

That is correct.

I take no position

because I don't pretend to have briefed the question of
retroactivity for others.
Now, should this Court find that the new statute
not apply, and I can't conjure a reason why you might, but
should you find that it doesn't apply, we are back to the
gloss which this Court in Oestereich and Breen placed on
section 10(b)(3).

The Court will recall that in those two

cases, one a case of ministerial exemption and one a case of
student deferment, there was an explicit statutory authorization
given both those classifications, and a Local Board, as a
majority of this Court found in an excess of its authority,
there was a Local Board which in excess of its authority
reclassified an accelerated induction.
Now, if we are back to the old problem of OestereichBreen on the one hand and Clark v. Gabriel on the other hand
and understand that we do not attack classification or
processing here but we are only attacking an appellate

16

regulatory scheme, then I suggest this is clearly within
the Oestereich decision by statute when a Local Board gives
a registrant conscientious objector status by statute that is
filed unless an appeal is authorized by rules and regulations.
Here if you referred back to that appellate
regulatory scheme you find no authorization except the
generally "shall prescribe such rules and regulations."
It seems to me in a ease which touches so clearly
on an area of personal liberty there have to be as in Caton
Brill v. Dulles, there have to be standards which are explicit.
Congress understands that point clearly because in the new
Act it doesn't merely say there is a right to appear before
an Appeal Board, or you have a right to written findings
or written reasons, rather.

What it says pursuant to such

rules and regulations as the President may prescribe, and
then it creates the standards, but nowhere in the 1967 Act
are there any standards which are authorized by Congress.
So I believe that we are in a classic Oestereich situation.
With regard to the burden of the Government’s
arguments which has been that there really is lurking here a
question of classification of processing, I notice that the
Solicitor General finally on page 13 of its brief agrees that
this Court supports our position.

It says this Court is not

now celled upon to determine whether the assigned classification
is wholly without factual basis.

I would point out

17

parenthetically that while we are not asking the Court to
deal with the question of classification, that the Government
seems to suggest although it is silent as to reason that there
was no prima facie case made out here for conscientious
objector classification.

Well, maybe there is something that

I don't know about, although it doesn't appear in the record.
The record is silent in this regard.

The Government has

unequivocally taken the position that there was no statement
given by the State director to the Appeal Board.

If that

is so, X do not understand how it can, as it does in this
Court, contest the validity of the CO classification.

Was

there an oral communication which is not part of the record?
We don't know.

That is precisely why the due process standard

we are urging here is as important as we feel it is.

This

is not however merely a case of prima facie classification.
Here we have a Local Board having come to a conclusion that
a registrant was classifiable as 1-0.

I would suggest that

the Court do eithe^ one of two things, that it apply under
new Public Law 92-129, follow the standards there set, refer
this back to the Selective Service System for review in
light of those standards, and pending that the District
Court reinstate Fein in his 1-0 classification.

That is

No. 1.
Alternatively, although the relief we believe should
be the same, it might apply the standards it has recited as

18
the gloss in Oestereich and Breen to 10(b) (3) of the Act,
that it understand that we are attacking the system of
classification and not classification itself.
Thank you,
QUESTION;

Mr. Standard, before you sit down I

would like to ask you just one question.

Is there any

legislative history on this recent amendment which suggests
that the new provisions are to make explicit what you say
was previously implicit?
MR. STANDARD;

Yes,

Well, I confess, Your Honor,

because of the newness of the statute, that while I have
begun what is now a 2,000-page search to canvass both the
Senate hearings and the House hearings, I find only two
references having gone through the Senate hearings.

The only

testimony which explicitly suggested that these appellate
rights, these procedural due process rights were offered by
Mr. R. E. Nyer of the American Civil Liberties Union,

There

is however — I believe I can give you the citation in a
moment,
QUESTION:

That won't necessarily help us very

much unless Congress adopted the view.
MR. STANDARD:

That is true.

that the search has ended.

I do not pretend

It has just begun, given the

newness of the statute, and I would be glad if the Court
desired to brief that and ask permission to do so.

There is

19

however in the 91st Congress, 1st Session, a study made of
the Selective Service System with recommendations for
administrative improvement that was submitted by the Sub­
committee on Administrative Practice and Procedure to the
Senate Judiciary Committee.

There you will find, and

particularly on pages --- it would be the section running
9 through 11 — you find precisely these recommendations.
Others, of course, not followed nor followed by the conference
report here.

6

For example, one of the issues raised was the
right to counsel at a Local Board appearance.

Congress, in

the conference report, did not adopt the recommendations for
administrative improvement made in the study I just referred
to but rather took the position that it would really impede
the Selective Service classification process and therefore
did not adopt that.

The other four recommendations however

of the Senate Committee were adopted at the conference.
QUESTION:

Mr. Standard, an issue that seemed to

stir up the Court of Appeals a little bit was this problem
of the jurisdictional amount requirement of Section 1331.
MR. STANDARD:
Honor.

I have briefed that question, Your

I will be glad to allude to it briefly in the following

v/ ay:
First, there is a classic and standard answer.
There has been an allegation in this complaint of a $10,000

20
amount in controversy,

1 don't think it can be gainsaid

by anyone that this petitioner can meet that statutory amount,
I think however that there lurks here a constitutional
question of real proportion.

If this action had been begun

in the District of Columbia there would be no $10 „000
jurisdictional amount because Congress doesn't impose that
amount in the District, unlike every other district in the
United States.

More important, and I think the full answer,

the full answer I choose to give was that given by Judge
Edelstein in dissent below in the three-judge court in Boyd
v. Clark.

I don't believe you can exhalt a 19th century

notion of property in cases where substantial Federal rights
are at issue.

I think the Government has acknowledged that

there are substantial Federal rights at issue here and I
don't think that 1331 should be heard to be a bar to the
assumption of jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

You say it is unconstitutional.

MR. STANDARD:
QUESTION:

I would say SO.

You don’t think Congress can

constitutionally exhalt a 19th century notion of property.
MR. STANDARD:
it can.

Let me amend what I said.

I think

I think it is erroneous when it does so.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

Mr. Standard, in the appendix on 89-F

is reproduced an affidavit by you in which you direct comment

21
to a so-called brief, and I put that in quotations, by Miss
Jackylin-Jones intimating that this was some kind of
additional information placed in the file by the Board,

Do

you recede from that position at this point?
MR, STANDARD %

Do I recede from the position that

that is in fact what occurred?
I have never seen that.

No, Your Honor, not at all.

It has been characterized by the

then United States Attorney Martin Soloman as merely a summary
prepared by the clerk to enable the Appeal Board to under­
stand what the issues are.

You will find his affidavit I

believe on the pages following.

You will find it on page

89-1.
I certainly don’t recede.

But that is not the kind

of notice which I think both the Constitution then and always
and Congress not; requires.
QUESTION:

Well, I get from your affidavit that

you are insinuating that there is additional information in
this brief.
MR, STANDARD:

What had. happened was that subsequent

to the argument before Judge Tyler in this case in reviewing
the record I found a letter which was dated June 10 from the
clerk of the Local Board to the Appeal Board and it said,
Tf

"Please be advised that we have already made up the brief on
the above-named subject and is to go into today's meeting."
I therefore submitted a post-argument affidavit,

22

post the argument before Judge Tyler, and I indicated that it
v/as central to the Government's position that nothing else
had happened and now I find that indeed something else had
happened.

There had been some notification.

The Assistant

United States Attorney in response then said there was nothing
which was meritorious, nothing which went to the substance
in that regard, but rather was merely a synopsis by the clerk
to aid the Appeal Board in its process.
QUESTION:

Well, I gather again that you are

insinuating that this is a lawyer's brief that was submitted.
Are you receding from that position or is my statement
incorrect?
MR. STANDARD:

No, I think, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

you misunderstood if you thought I was ever insinuating it
was a lawyer's brief.
colloquial sense.

I used the phrase "brief" in the

It was a synopsis, a placing, if you will,

of what was going to be presented to the Appeal Board, but
it was prepared not by a lawyer but by a clerk, not by anyone
in the State director's office.
QUESTION:

Of that, I am satisfied.

Are you still then dissatisfied with

the Assistant United States Attorney's affidavit, and I
read:
"It is merely a summary of the registrant's
Selective Service file."
MR. STANDARD:

No, I am not dissatisfied idLth that.

23

QUESTION:

Of course, any summary would necessarily

involve editorial judgment and selection.
MR. STANDARD:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Or it may be merely a listing of the

dockets.
MR. STANDARD:

Well, I think if it were a listing

of the docket entries which are ordinarily attached to the
cover sheet, which I understand is an appellate practice that
.would never occur, I think it would have been referred to
as docket entries.
is simple.

I think the use of the English language

When the word ’'brief' is used, it means a brief,

though not necessarily in a lawyer's sense.

If docket

entries were sent up, they would be called docket entries.
QUESTION:

This was just as you say a young lady

who was the clerk of the Board.
MR. STANDARD:

She was the clerk of the Board and

she could have made an error.

We really don't know.

The record silent in that

24

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR. GRISWOLD;

Mr, Solicitor General.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
This case can become quite complicated and I am
going to try, if I can, to present it in a somewhat simple
form.

Insofar as there is a constitutional question in it,

it seems to me to be essentially one of the framework within
which this Court sits.

That is, the separation of powers

and the proper function of this Court with respect to the
functions of specifically Congress in this case.
The case I believe turns on the application of
two relatively simple statutory provisions which are quoted
on pages 2 and 3 of our brief.

First is the jurisdictional

amount provision to which Mr. Standard referred at the close
of his argument and which is discussed at the close of our
brief.

The District Court shall have original jurisdiction

of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy
exceeds the Siam or value of $10,000.

Now, there is not a

trace of evidence in this case that $10,000 or any other
amount is involved.

The argument, made by Mr. Standard in

his brief is in essence that that provision really should not
be taken seriously.

Maybe it is unconstitutional, though

he wasn't willing to say that it was unconstitutional this
morning, and that at any rate it is a 19th century anachronism
and the courts should not really pay much attention to it.

25

Now , it may be wise or it may be unwise —
QUESTION:

There was an allegation however in his

pleading that —
MR. GRISWOLD:

There is an allegation in the

pleading but the nature of the transaction is such that it
is not susceptible to monetary evaluation.

It is like the

question this Court decided a century ago that custody of
a chiId, which can be a crucially important matter, is not
susceptible of monetary evaluation.
QUESTION:

Two years at military pay as contrasted

with two years income as a physician —
MR. GRISWOLD:

Two years of military pay as a

physician is considerably higher than two years military pay
as a first-class private.

This man would have gone in the

Service as a commissioned officer with pay and allowances.
Besides, I am not sure that that is the proper measure in a
case such as this.
QUESTION:

I am not sure either.

MR. GRISWOLD:

I merely suggest if the District

Court did not have jurisdiction, this Court does not have
jurisdiction, and there is something to be said for not giving
advisory opinions on important and difficult questions of
constitutional law in cases in which the jurisdiction is not
established.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor, how about Haige against

26

the CIO?
MR. GRISWOLDi

In that case a majority of the

Court quite plainly made it clear that it was not proceeding
under this section because it felt that the jurisdictional
amount couldn't be there, and it found a way to proceed under
another section which is not available here, so I think that
the Haige case rather supports the position I am talcing.
I wouldn’t want to be misunderstood.

If I were a Member of

Congress, which I am not, it seems to me that this provision
might well be reconsidered with respect to cases of this
type, but it is what Congress has provided and Congress has
not made any change in it and I find it difficult to see
why the Court should not respect it and carry it into
effect.
Now, the other statutory provision is Section
10(b)(3) of the Selective Service Act, xtfhich has been before
this Court in a number of cases and which is quoted at the
bottom of page 3 of our brief.

No judicial review shall be

made of the classification — and here I emphasise the next
two words —• or processing.

Mr. Standard has said he is

talking about the procedures used here.

I suggest that "all

processing" could not be a clearer expression of the intention
of Congress that the procedures shall not be subject to
judicial review of any registrant by a Local Board, Appeal
Board or the President except as a defense to a criminal

27
prosecution after the registrant has responded either
affirmatively or negatively to an order to report for
induction.
The question in this case, it seems to us, is
really the construction and application of Section 10(h)(3)
and let me point out, too, that the ultimate question is
simply one of timing.

If Mr. Standard has substantial

questions to raise on behalf of his client, we do not contend
that there is not a place where they can be raised.

We are

not contending that these questions are forever foreclosed
from judicial review.

Our position is simply that they

cannot consistently with the enactment by Congress and
enactment properly made by Congress in its judgment both
with respect to its power to control the procedures in the
lower Federal courts and with respect to its powers to raise
and maintain armies that Congress has provided that no
judicial review shall be had of the classification or
processing except after either affirmative or negative
response to an order to report for induction.
Wow, obviously, of course, this turns on several
cases which have recently been before the Court, the first
of which — and the one I supposed most relied on by Mr.
Standard — is the Oestereich case.

I would point out that

that case is markedly different from this case.

I would

point out, too, that Justice Stewart wrote a dissenting

28

opinion in that case in which Justices Brennan and White
concurred in which they said that there was no inherent or
inevitable conflict between the statutory provisions which
were before the Court.

The position which was taken by the

Government there was that 10(b)(3) said no judicial review
shall be had but there was another provision in the statute
which said that students of theology "shall be exempt from
training and service under this Act."
In the struggle in my mind which went on in
connection with that case I found those two provisions *
though not necessarily inherently inconsistent, so close to
inconsistent that I found it impossible to support the
literal construction of Section 10(b)(3) in that situation.
The then Director of the Selective Service System was unhappy
about that and he may well have been more far-seeing to see
cases such as this over the horizon,

I recognized that

the conflict was not absolute or literal, as was pointed out
by Mr. Justice Stewart's opinion, but I ascertained that if
this case went forward that the Criminal Division of the
Department of Justice would not institute a criminal
prosecution against a man where the statute provided that
he shall be exempt from service or training under this Act.
It was perfectly clear in my mind that if such a prosecution
were instituted and if it got through to the Solicitor
General's office that I would confess error in such a case

29

and I have little doubt that the Court would support such a
confession in view of the expressed provision of the statute,

*

and referring to an opinion of this Court in a draft case
some 20 years ago where it was said that it itfas unnecessary
to walk up the hill and then march down again, I felt that
the conflict was so close that a construction of Section
10(b)(3) was called for.
I point out that that problem arose only because
there were two statutory provisions at least nearly in
conflict with each other.

There is nothing of that sort

here.
QUESTION:

In the 1971 amendments, was any effort

made to change the rule of that case?
MR. GRISWOLD:

No, Mr. Justice.

The only

substantive amendment in the Draft Act that was made, or at
least the only one that is anywhcire near that, near this
case, is the addition of Section 22 at the end, which contains
these provisions which Mr. Standard referred to and to which
I plan to make reference to a little later in my argument.
QUESTION:

But 10(b)(3) was substantially —

MR. GRISWOLD:

It is entirely unchanged.

There

is no reference to it in the statute.
Now, on the same day that Oestereich was decided
there was also decided Clark against Gabriel, which it seems
to me clearly supports the position that I have taken that

30

Gestereieh turns on the clash in the presence of two
virtually inconsistent provisions — shall I say practically
inconsistent provisions — of the statute.

1 fully agree

they were not literally inconsistent but I felt they were
practically so and the majority of the Court took that
position, too.
Clark against Gabriel involved a pre-induction
effort to enjoin the induction with respect to a claim of
conscientious objection and the Court held that 10(b) (3)
barred that position.

I might also point out that in the

Oestereich case itself, Mr. Justice Harlan concurred in the
judgment on grounds which are very close to the position of
Mr. Standard today.

I think perhaps oversimplifying it it

was on the ground that if it was a question of fact there
couldn't be an injunction but if it was a question of law
there could be.

But that view, though he repeated it in

the Gufcknecht and Breen case, or particularly the Breen
case, was not adopted by any other member of the Court.
And then the case which I think is the closest to
this case was decided only a few weeks later than Clark
against Gabriel, and that is Boyd against Clark.

That is

a decision of the Court, two or three lines long, bypassing
the jurisdictional amount questioned but otherwise simply
affirming the judgment of the court below.
But Boyd against Clark was a pure question of law.

31

There was a question suggested therefore enjoining induction
that there was an unconstitutional discrimination against
non-college students in that they, perhaps because of inadequate
financial support, were subjected to the draft while college
students were deferred.

That contention was denied by a

three-judge District Court which also dismissed for want of
jurisdiction on the jurisdictional amount question.

Appeal

was taken to this Court and this Court affirmed pro curium
without reaching the question under Section 1331 which is
the jurisdictional amount case.
Then finally the construction of 10(b) {3) which I
am urging here it seems to me is confirmed by the Breen case
in 396 U.S.

Both the Oestereich case and the Breen case

arose out of delinquency reclassifications.

The Oestereich

case involved a statutory provision which said that the
individual shall be exempt.

The Breen case involved a

situation where there was no doubt, no contention, that the
individual was. a bona fide full-time student and the statute,
as it then read, said that such student shall be deferred,
and the contention was made before this Court that there
was a difference a deferral and an exemption.

Formally, I

think one can make that difference.
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals upheld it, as I

remember it.
MR. GRISWOLD:

And the Court of Appeals, not in

32

the Breen case —- oh, yes, Mr, Justice, in the Breen case
the Court of Appeals had made that.
QUESTION:

Judge Friendly.

MR. GRISWOLD:

Had made that distinction.

it confusing to keep Gutknecht and Breen separate.

I find
Gutknecht

has nothing directly to do with this because it was a
criminal case, not a 10(b) (3) case, and the Court held that
there was no difference between an expressed staturory
provision by Congress that Oestereich should be exempt and
that Breen should be deferred.

I think perhaps some of the

trouble in later cases has come from shall I say somewhat
broad language in the Oestereich case. The lower courts have
sometimes quoted the words blatantly lawless from the
Cstereich case and we find occasionally that anything that
anybody finds that he can argue was not in accordance with
law becomes blatantly lawless in order that it can be brought
within the Oestereich case.
But the result of these decisions it seems to me
is that Section 10{b)(3) means what it says, should be read
to mean what it says, except in situations where the Court
finds conflicting provisions in the enactments of Congress.
Such conflicting provisions were found in Oestereich.
Such conflicting provisions were found in Breen.

They were

not found in Clark against Gabriel where the underlying issue
was one of fact.

They were not found in Boyd against Clark

33

where the underlying issue is one of law.
And so I suggest that the issue in this case has
in fact been cited by this Court in Boyd against Clark.
QUESTION:

Can you tell us again briefly, Mr.

Solicitor General, what was the underlying legal issue in
that case?
MR. GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

In Boyd against Clark?

Yes, in Boyd against Clark.

MR. GRISWOLD:

It was the question v/ith respect to

discrimination against non-students.
QUESTION:

Yes, thank you.

MR. GRISWOLD:

With economic undertones involved

in it, which is a question of due process and equal protection,
which is not unrelated to the procedural due process which
is referred to here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, do I understand

it that as of today if the State director took an appeal,
as happened in this case, that there would be a notice and an
opportunity for a personal appearance before the State Appeal
Board under the new statute?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Under the new statute, there would.

I hesitated only for a moment because the President had not
issued his regulation under the new statute.
QUESTION:

Let's assume he would have a right to

a personal appearance before the State Appeal Board and then

34
let's assume that today a case came up like this one where he
was denied a personal appearance.

He was not given notice and

he was not given a personal appearance and his classification
was changed to 1-A, as it was in this case, and then he
brought pre-induction review.

Would you say 10(b)(3) in that

situation would bar pre-induction review where the statute
expressly called for a personal appearance but he was
expressly denied it?
MR. GRISWOLDS

Well, Mr. Justice, I haven't had

any chance to think about this in advance but I think I
would.

I think I would say that it was barred by 10(b) (3)

and you might say well, why isn't this also a case of
inconsistent statutory provisions, and I think I would say
well, the inconsistency here relates to procedures, to the
processing, and 10(b)(3) has expressly precluded —
QUESTION:

If it were not barred by 10(b)(3), then

it probably wouldn't be barred in this case either if there
was a constitutional requirement.
MR. GRISWOLD:

I agree, Mr. Justice, and let ms

reiterate that we are not suggesting that Mr. Fine cannot
present his issues before a proper court at a proper time,
a completely impartial court at a proper time.

We simply

say that 10(b) (3) says that he can't present it now.

It

leaves him a difficult alternative, I agree, but that is
the

35
QUESTION:
time.

You mean a proper court at the proper

I gather, Mr. Solicitor General, you are suggesting

it be either habeas or in defense —
MR. GRISWOLD:
prosecution.

Or in defense of a criminal

I agree that is a different place but it is

a full day in court before an impartial judicial tribunal.
These provisions in the statute which was enacted on September
28, there is nothing in the statute to indicate that Congress
intended that they should be in any way retroactive.
effective date on the statute is September 28.

The

The only

provision which varies from that is that the extension of the
draft from July 1, 1971 to July 1, 1973 is expressly provided
to take effect from July 2, 1971.

Apparently July 1 was

included in the previous statute.
I have here conference report, which is Report
No. 92-433, House Report No. 92-433.
made in the Senate.

These amendments were

They were not included in the House bill.

The Senate included a fifth provision which provided for
counsel before draft boards.

The conference committee, the

report reads after extensive discussion the House conferees
agreed to accept the Senate amendments with regard to Items
1, 2, 3 and 4, and Items 1 and 4 are the ones to which Mr.
Standard referred.
QUESTION:

I suppose these are readily available.

MR. GRISWOLD:

I have not tried to find it in your

36

library.

Mr. Reynolds found it for me with a considerable

amount of difficulty, but found it.
The Senate conferees pointed out that under the
language of this amendment these rights would be granted
pursuant to such rules and regulations as the President may
prescribe, and the regulations under which the rights were
granted should be drafted in such a way as to preclude abuses
and obvious delaying tactics.

The Senate conferees pointed

out further that the right to present witnesses is specifically
subject under their amendment to reasonable limitations on
the number of witnesses and the total time allotted.

With

the understanding therefore that the regulations implementing
these provisions will be drafted in such a way as to protect
the orderly and efficient functioning of the Selective Service
System, and not result in an unreasonable burden on local
draft boards, the House accepted the Senate position on
Items 1 to 4 and then the report goes on to say that the
Senate receded from its position with respect to counsel,
and because of concern about two things that it would impose
a serious procedural burden on civilian draft boards and
that it might provide inequities in that some people's
economic status would enable them to have counsel or more
effective counsel than others would have.
QUESTION:

In part the new law I gather is not

very different from prior Regulation 32 of the code, Section

37
1626.12 that you cite on page 40, in the footnote on page
45.

The personal appealing may attach to his appeal a

statement.
MR. GRISWOLD;
to his appeal

Well, the person appealing may attach

in this case it was the State Director of

Selective Service who appealed.

We agree that if he had

attached a statement —
QUESTION:

How could he appeal without making a

statement?
MR. GRISWOLD:

He simply sent a letter to the

Board saying I appeal.
QUESTION:

Without stating any reason?

MR. GRISWOLD:
ever.

Without stating any position what­

This is the way it is usually done.

What that means

is that the file is then transmitted to the Appeal Board and
the Appeal Board treats the file as we lawyers would say as
a trial de novo and considers the whole thing.
QUESTION:

There was no argument?

MR. GRISWOLD:

No argument, no appearance before

either the -QUESTION:

No statement of what the position was?

MR. GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

No statement of position.

That is almost beyond belief.

MR. GRISWOLD:

Well, Mr. Justice, I am afraid I

can't accept that as it must have been done in hundreds
i

38
thousands of casas over the past 25 years and on the whole
has worked pretty well.
QUESTION?

Not even an. assertion that they want -this

reversed?
MR. GRISWOLD?

I take it the affect of the appeal is

to indicate that somebody thinks it ought to be looked into.
I may say it doesn't necessarily mean they want it reversed.
In this particular case, after Mr. Fein lost in the State
Appeal Board, he lost unanimously and under the regulation he
had no right to appeal to the Presidential Board.

He wrote

to the Director of Selective Service and the Director of
Selective Service took an appeal for him.

I have no reason

to believe that the Director of Selective Service thought that
it ought to be reversed.

He apparently thought it ought to

be reviewed, and it seems to me entirely appropriate for the
administrative officer to say to the tribunal lire think this
is a matter which ought to be reviewed, and without putting
any weight as to which way it ought to go.
is just the position here.

I think that that

In any event, it is a part of

the procedure, it is a part of the processing of the
registrant's case and that is precisely what Section 10(b)(3)
says should not be subject to judicial review. We submit
that is in effect what this Court decided in Boyd against
Clark and that this is wholly consistent with the Court's
decisions in Oestereich and Breen.
