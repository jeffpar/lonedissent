Mr. Dwyer, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. DWYER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. DWYERs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;

In this case the Courts' of the State of Washington
have declared themselves to be not bound by this Court's
constitutional definition of obscenity, and they have thrust
it aside to punish a man criminally for exhibiting a motion
picture which is clearly non-obscene and is protected under
the First Amendment guarantee of -freedom of expression.
In the course of doing this the Courts of the State
of Washington have wielded a general obscenity statute of .the
type which typically exists in all 50 States.

And of the type

which this Court has repeatedly made clear can be used only
to pi; ish or suppress material which is obscene under the
test promulgatad in the leading case of Roth vss United States,
As summarised in many cases since then, perhaps most
explicitly in 1 Deck vs, Attorney General in 1966, in order to
convict the State must prove that three elements coalesce.
First, it must be established that the dominant theme
of the material, taken as a whole, is an appeal to prurient

interest in aex and not some other kind of appea.1
fcr. son-3, the material must be patently offensive in
temporary community standards of candor, in.
representing or depicting sasnal matters.
Third, that the material is utterly without redeeming:
social value.

T, manhxon those elements despite their well-known
familiarity to the Court and the counsel in this field, because

oi our belief that it is vital that this definition be honored
and adhered to if freedom of speech is to survive the
application of the obscenity laws in the United States,
If this definition should be weakened or abandoned,
the eral! crack in the wall which is afforded to the general
obscenity laws, ’ as to unprotected speech, would very quickly
become a wide-open door to the punishment of protective
expression.

In Roth, the Court pointed out that it was implicit
in the. history of the First amendment that obscenity was
urv>?viy without xeddeaisig social value.

And that finding, that

belief is the basis for obscenity law as it exists today.
A:; i tt-© Court has repeatedly made clear, both in full-scale
opinions and in per curiam reversals over the last 15 years,
t “b tbofc definition applies so as to protect material which

pi-? t.ou/.d find offensive, disgusting, of little value
purh: os? but the definition must be adhered to in order for

5
the First Amendmont guarantees to be carried out in the actual
day-to-day enforcement of the laws.
Q

What was the actual sentence here?

MR* DWYER;
Q

$600 fine, Mr. Justice Douglas*

Re wasn't to be put away for five years?

MR. DWYER;

He was not sentenced to prison at all,

just a fine.
The sentencing judge remarked, however, that he was
fixing the fine at a level he considered high enough to prevent
such displays of.motion pictures from happening again in that
community.
0

And this motion picture was based on the opera

"Carmen", was it?
MR, DWYER;

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, it is baaed on

the libretto of "Carmen", without the music.
0

And called "Carmen Baby"?

MR. DWYER:
Q

"Carmen Baby", right.

Did it have any more in common with it than the

title?
HU, DWYER;

It did, ©a several witnesses testified

at the trial, the story follows the story line.of the opera
“Carmen", which in turn followed a novel by Merimee, a French
wove .1st.

The character of Carmen is very similar;

an evil

young woman fatalistically headed toward her:- own destruction.

G

How do the- criminal sentences in obscenity

6
cases in Washington State :mn?

MR* DWYER:

Are they very heavy?

In a few cases there have been prison

•sentences i:a the neighborhood of thirty days, as I recall most
recently in Seattle•

In motion picture prosecutions„ prison

sentences have only been meted out in the type of film that * s
shown in places called the Adult Book Store, for example, whic
specialises in erotic materials.
In exhibitions for general consumption, such as the
present case, fines have been the usual penalty on those,
Q

This movie was shown without incidant in other

cities in your State? right?
MR. DWYER:

It was indeed.

It was shown in Seattle,

and it was shown in Yakima, which is not far from Richland,
in eastern Washington.
Q

In a.public theater?

MS.. DWYER:
Q

In public theaters.

And it has been shown throughout all the

United States, hasn’t it?
MR. DWYER:
0

It has.

It’s been reviewed in

Public review in the newspaper?

MB. DWYER: Reviewed in the Mew York Times.

One

witne tv testified in the court below that ha saw it shown at
Oat Ridge, Tennessee, in a situation where it was shown on an
outdoor sere*.:}, and tho sound was piped into the motel for
those; wishing to listen in.

7
9

And, i s fact, there*» nothing in it that can bs

suppressed under the Constitution, and that * s bean decided in
two other courts r was it not?
MR, DWYER;
Marylandr X believe,

It was decided in Haw Jersey and in
tod the opinion in New Jersey, 1' think*

is very eloquent.
Q

. Did it involve drive-sins in Maryland?

ME. DWYER:

No, in neither State, Mr. Justice Marshall,

did it involve drive-ins.
Q

It involved movies, though?

MR. DWYERj

It involved the same movie, but was

■ shown at an indoor theater.

Q

But is there anything, is it true in this

connection that there were houses nearby where somebody could
sit on the pcfcch cud see it?
MR. DWYER s The photographs in the record show that
thero are a■few dilapidated houses at some distance from the
screen, some of which would be able to have a view of the sere
Q

There was nothing to stop a young kid from

standing' there and seeing it?
Bis. DWYER: There 'was nothing to stop anyone of any

age from

53tending

at the fence and looking? that is, there was

no physical obstruction.
Q

Do you see any difference between that and a

clears theaia.v that does not allow children?

8
MR. DWYERs

Q

I'm sorry?

Do you see any difference between that and the

situation in a closed theater that does not admit children?
MR. DWYERs

Yes, 1 do.

1 think the State could

properly —

0.

You do admit the difference?

MR. DWYER;

Yes.

1 think the State could properly

legislate in that area, what has been called the area of
obtrusive display legislation,.
Q

And this Court has said so.

MR. DWYER;

Yes, indeed, it has.

And why the States

have not more clearly picked up that opportunity and acted
upon it before now, I don't know.
Q

A few have.

W© have a —

New York did it.

MR. DWYER:

New York has; Arizona has. But 1 think

it's still a minority of States that have.

Our State could and

should, but hasn't. And that's the fatal defect in the
pres&nct prosecution.
Q

Well, are you conceding then that the State of

Washington could have legislated so as to prevent the showing
of this film in the manner in which it was shown, with the
V

exposure to people outside the drive-in?
MR. DWYER:
hare.

There was nothing shown in the record

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that there was in fact any

exposure to people outside the driver in <•

There was no evidence

9

that anybody out aide the drive-in saw the film or complained
about it or was affected by; it in any way.

But we do concede,

and 1 think there5s no contest, that a State can legislate
in the obtrusive display area by enacting a clearly, narrowly,
specifically drawn statute which could apply to drive-in
motion picture theaters as well as billboards, newsstands,
and other types of displays.
Q

To cover a situation such as your State Supreme

Court found to exist here, where at least the people in these
houses ware exposed?
MR. DOTER?

Ye3.

I believe such legislation could be

enacted, and in the report, of the President's Commission on
Obscenity and Pornography there is even a model statute to
that effect.
Q

Well, then, is your complaint here basically a

Lanzefcfca vs. New Je-

type of complaint, that you weren't

giver, fair warning of what the State intended to punish
criminals as?
MR. DWYERt That is one of our basic complaints, yes,
indeed, it is, because nothing in. the statute gave Mr.
Rabe any notice that he could be prosecuted or any theory for
showing a non-obscens film under certain circumstances, such
as an outdoor exhibition.
Q
complaint?

But then you also — that isn't your only

10

MR.

That'5 s not our only position, but wo

farther contend that in expanding the obscenity statute as it
did, so as to sweep this picture within its ambit, the Washing­
ton Supreme Court has rendered that obscenity statute void for
vagueness in the application.

Because it has punished the

exhibition of a film on the ground of offensiveness or
obtrv.aiveness» words which recur throughout the opinion, with

no definition, no substantive standard whatever to guide either
this defendant or any other exhibitor in the future as to what
he could or could not exhibit at an outdoor theater.
The prise danger of the many dangers we see in the
Washington opinion is that the court there expressly says,

that even though it is enforcing a. general obscenity statute
if does not have to be guided by the Roth definition of
obscenity.
4

'

-

That, we believe, cries out more than any other
single element in the case for a reversal.
The court, in our view, has misread this Court’s
decisions in Ginzburg, Mishkin, and Redrup, and has engrafted
an ill “-defined or completely undefined common law crime
upon the existing obscenity statute, rendering that statute
fatally vague and uncertain.
Q

Mr. Dwyer, if 1 might take you back for a minute.

On page 71, the findings of fact, it says that:

"That said

Park-af Drive in faces a residential area .,. and an overpass

:".r

7iv\v

..2;

iha

screen to residents of the ares

and passing motorists»65

ME. DMYER: There’s not question / Mr. Justice Marshall,
that some residents, had they been home end watching, could
have seen that screen from outside the theater.

There is also

no'question that passing motorists could have seen .the screen.
The Washington Supreme Court eliminated —
Q

Can’t 1 assume that where there’s an. overpass,

there're some people on it?
ME* DWYERs Well, there might or might not be.

I

don't, think such an assumption can be made in a criminal
prosecution, no *

Q

But this is a finding of fact here.,

It says that the overpass is there,‘and it’s clear
enough for them to see it.
MR. DWYER:

Yes.

And that’s true.

There's no

contest about that, that if there was someone there, the scree?,:,
would

he

visible.

G

Well, do you say,, then, that the State legis­

lation must ka so narrowly drawn as to require proof on the
part of: the State that someone was actually on this overpass
or in this house seeing it, rather than the reasonable
probability that it might occur?
MS. DWYER?

2 would think so.

X think that’s required

; v' this Covert' a decision in the Cohen ease last yc~ar, for

12
example.
speak in

And by the language of the Red rap case, both of which
ccl.

arete tar.us of - a actual assault upon privacy as a

•precondition for prosecution under these circumstances*

I

would think it would not be. enough to prove, for the State to
prove that work was displayed under circumstances where it.
might have given offense to someone.
Q
here.

Wall, you don't need to go. that far, however,

There was no such statute of any kind, that's your

point here.
M3. DWYER:
Q

Exactly,

Arad whether, now much power the State might

have under the police power, it could require a drive-in to be
so many feet away from any residences or to put up fences, or
;o put it where the light and the noise and the traffic wouldn't
bother people, or the content of the movie wouldn't bother
people.

Those are all questions that would arise if there

were any such statute here.
Here there's simply no statute, no such statute of
any kind.
MR. DWYER: And that is the fatal defect of the
prosecution, as we see it? yes.
Q
:.tgreeM-:-ent*

Well, baclf to my point, how maybe 1 can get
Ox page 81, i% the opinion of Judge McGovern:

■'Or. both occasions, teenage .and younger children were
observed by the officer to be watching the motion picture from

13
various points outside the theater fence,”
MR. DWYER: That is correct, but the opinion
Q

You agree with that.

MR. DWYER:

Riit the opinion goes on to say that the

presence of those juveniles cannot support the conviction of the
petitioner because, at the time in question, the State had no
statute directed to the protection of juveniles,
Q

I’m just getting the facts for my own self as

to whether that picture was available for children to see.
that’s one point I’m interested in.
MR. DWYER: The answer is that the record shows that
there were people of minority age at that fence watching at
least parts of the picture.
Q

That's correct,

Well, that’s what I was trying to get at.

MR. DWYER: That’s entirely correct,

The Court, in

Judge McGovern’s opinion, gees on to say, though, that
although Washington has since passed a juvenile type statute,
it had none at the time and therefore the presence of those
Ivcveniles cannot support the conviction? that the same analysis
should have been applied to the privacy argument, in our view.
That also should have required a statute.
1 think it’s perfectly clear that this motion picturr
is not obscene under the Roth definition.

It has a predominant

dramatic appeal, a very strong story, a story that’s been
often fold and retold in many different versions.

audiences have mac’s important, many films which are no less
candid than this in the portrayal of sexual matters.

And

indeed in the court below there was no competent evidence,
even, that this film exceeded current standards of concior
in any respect.
As to the third element, redeeming social value,
this film has a moral message, and it has social value
according to at least the sir impressive defense witnesses
who testified at the trial.
I would not tell the Court that this film is one of
the bast films ever made, obviously it's not. But in First
Amendment litigation the tests are almost always made as to
materials which most of us would not prefer to see but which
are nonetheless protected.
Q

Is it here so we could see it?

MR. DWYER;

It's here, Mr. Justice Douglas.

I saw

it is?. the Court's viewing room yesterday for the first time.
Judge Matthews of the Hew Jersey court was correct
in describing it as a "work of art", those.were his words.
The enaction of whether it's a pleasing work'of art is really •
or.s c£ taste, and not of obscenity law.

One man’s vulgarity

ig another *s lyric, as the late Mr. Justice Harlan said for

the o;:v.r1 in bfc.' Cvlsn ees«i.

And that remarks applies, we

believe, to this motion picture,
Stow# here the Washington Court and the prosecution
virtually concede what I've just said? namely, that the film
is non-obscena.

That they claim it was obscene as shown,

because scenes in the movie were, visible front a few nearby
houses, and they postulated that the privacy of the persons
in those houses was necessarily invaded by the visibility of
this motion picture.
The Court goes on to say that it does not have to

jtidgo the material for obscenity vel non one way or the other.
New, ail of this necessarily implies that a differen
standard assists for outdoor theaters as compared to indoor
theaters.

Yet neither the court nor the prosecution has

suggested what, that standard might be.
'The exhibitor is told, in effects

You may be

prosecuted under the obscenity statute for showing a non*»
obscene film, but it’s up to you to guess at which film.
1'f the analysis of the Washington Court were applied
acrons the board to ail motion pictures, many, and 1 believe
moat films could be condemned and their dissemination punished
unde:" the obscenity statutes on the basis of very short
iscl. ..ted single images that may be on the screen for a matter
of seconds,
And. any such rule would be a license to suppress

16
almost any film»
The outdoor theaters are an important medium of
expression in the l'nited States.

One of tha amicus briefs

shows that, about 25 percent of the nation's theaters are out­
door theaters at the present time.
The potential effect of this decision, unless
reversed, on those theaters would be chilling and suppressing-,
to say the very least.
The court’s opinion below, as I say, lapses into
such terms as “offensive displays", "offensive expression”,
"personally distasteful", and.so on.

All of which reveal that

the decision below renders the statute standardless, devoid
of standards.

And 1 believe the State reinforces the truth

of that point in its brief, when it suggests that exhibitors
should he guided by the unofficial industry rating system
in deciding what they should or should not exhibit, on pain of
criminal prosecution.
It’s suggested in the State's brief that the
motion picture production code ratings should put an exhibitor
on notice that if he shows an X-rated film in a manner deemed
obtrusive, he can be prosecuted.

But certainly the invocation

x? an unofficial standard like that, and we’re not even shown
what the standard is, or standards, plural, are in this
record, cannot take the place of a legislatively enacted
standard of criminal liability.

17
The Washington Court has read Gin a burg and Mishkin..
kv&z-up.. and the Fannie Hill case, » Book vs. Attorney General as authori.eing an abandonment of the Roth definition for
obscenity.
That? we suggest, is a patent and obvious misreading
c£ those cases.

In Ginzburg, in ruling that pandering could

nsidered in an evidentiary way as to whether material was
obscene or not, the Court expressly said that this analysis

simply elaborates the test by which the obscenity vel non of
tie material mist he judged.

Is Book vs« .attorney General was to the same effect.
Iliohi.in merely held that, the predominant prurient appeal dan
be addressed to a deviant sexual group rather than the .
majority.
In Radrup, X believe the court has misread, first
of all, in that per curiam decision where the Court reversed
a number of convictions, it pointed out that three elements
.-are not present:

namely, there was not. present a statute

directed to juveniles? there was not present a showing of
invasion of privacy; and there was not present any showing of
pandering under the Ginzburg case.
Ho cl rap, in our view of the case, left it open for the
States to legislate av to juveniles and to legislate for the
protoetion of privacy.

And that invitation to the States had.

teen extended -much earlier.

Jacobellis vs. Ohio contains a

18

aired! ar virtual invitation to the States to legislate as to
• juveniles, but holding, as the Court has often held, that
material cannot be punished under general obscenity laws
because it’s unsuitable for minors.

That was the holding of

Jacobs11is, and the same rule should apply where the argument
is based or, privacy, as distinguished from minors.
We have no doubt that the State can validly legislate

in this area.

But, as the Court pointed out last year in the

Reidal decision, the task of restructuring the obscenity laws
is the task of those who write and amend statutes and
ordinances, and not the task of the courts.
Washington here has bypassed that legislative
procedure, and by treating their obscenity statute as they
have done, they have converted into a statute with indefinite
standards for the restriction of speech and therefore void for
vagueness under Winters vs. New York.
and as the Court held in the Interstate Circuit case
in 1968, the purpose of the statute, which in that case was
the protection of juveniles, doss not mean that the standard of
specificity for First Amendment purposes is relaxed.

Vagueness

is•fatul whither privacy or minors or some other object
is involved.
Just last week in the P.opachristlan vs. Jacksonville
case, the Court held an ordinance void for vagueness, both
because it fails to apprize the citizen and because it invites

13
arbitrary and erratic arrests.

And both of those reasons

jfcon statute here? as itr. ]
by the lower courts into a weapon for punishment of speech.
The second basic reason for reversal? which we cite?
is that this petitioner was given no fair warning that he
could foe prosecuted in this fashion.

There was only one law on

the books? -that was the general obscenity law.

That law

necessarily told him that this picture was constitutionally
protected? and'that it could be exhibited with legal safety.
The statute said nothing at all about anyone’s right
to privacy? and? in fact, our State Supreme Court has not even
recognised a common law right to privacy until the day of
this very decision.
So nothing told Mr. Raba that he could fee prosecuted
for exhibiting a non-obscene film at a drive-in? the screen of
which could ho seen from a distance.
The State? in effect? convicted him of an ex post
facto common law crime.
Cohen vs

And the ruling below runs afoul of

tollfprnia? reversing a conviction in a speech

context. because there wag no statute putting the appellant there,
on notice that certain types of conduct or speech would not be
tolerated in certain settings or times or places.

on the hooks, there was no evidence that the

petitioner ^cmsdoted it in the sense that there was ao showing
icy was in fact invaded.

As the Court held

in tv. • Cohen case, the presumed presence of unwitting viewers
or listeners should not be sufficient to give rise to criminal
liability,

Q

Well, then, you’re saying that the State does,

indeed, have to show that actual persons viewed from outside
th® theater, juveniles or people who didn't want to, in order
to make this a criminal offense?
MR. DWYER:

2 think in order to prove that offense,

yes, that they must first define the offense with particularity

in the statute, and then prove that the statute was violated
by at: actual exhibition which absolutely invaded privacy or
caused offense in that sense,
Q

Well, Mr. Dwyer, since we're talking about a

statute that doesn't exist, I don’t see why you have to take
any position one way or the other as to what it could
constitutionally provide.

Your point is there is no such

statute of any kind, isn't it?

MS. DWYERj
Q

Exactly, Mr. Justice Stewart, that's

You don't need to — it's very possible that

a State could, provide that nobody should have a drive-in

21
sid®nee.

But there is no

statote of

MR. DWYHH:

Yes, that is our point.

And the case

cm be decided without reaching, at all, the questions of
what the States constitutionally could do, because here they've
done nothing.
Q

Right

MR, DWYER*

The third basic reason for reversal,

which we urge to the* Court, is that the petitioner's motion
to suppress the film should have been granted.

The film was

aoisc'd as evidence on the basis of a John Dos type of arrest
warrant.

That warrant..was issued on the basis of the uncross--

en.ssii.ned testimony of one police officer at an &>i parts hearing.
The Eiagisfcrate did not see the film, but merely heard the
polio© officer.
The proximate result of that was that this print
was suppressed for an entire year, through the trial court
otago of the proceedings.
Q

Couldn't your client have gotten another copy of

the film from somewhere?
MR. DWYER;

That is not shown in the record, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist. but I can advise the Court that as a genera.:
rule .it ie not easy at all to obtain a substitute print when
:: print is seised* and particularly in a location like Richland
Washington.

22

Each print- of a motion picture is expensive.

Each

on® is made in a laboratory, and prints are then dispersed
around the .United States for first-run and then second-run.,
and so on.

And at any given time there say be, if it*s a

major motion picture, there may be a few hundred prints in the
country; but each one is committed to exhibition at certain
times and places by contracts between the distributor and the.'
exhibitors.
This motion picture obviously is not a major motion
picture, and it would have been that much harder to get a
prini.„

I think, as a practical matter, he could not have done

so.
c

r words, he wasn't enjoined from

it, he was prevented by the film being out of his possession?
MR, DWYER:

Yes, he was, And our position is that

a seizure for evidentiary purposes, in effect, is identical
to. an injunction and it's suppressing the material to —
Q

Are you claiming violation of the Fourth

Amendment or the First, or both?
MR, DWYER5

Well, we claim both, but the emphasis

in our brief has been on the First Amendment, because, as we

. -bs y, .Sansas, and Marcus v. Search Warrant,
the First Amendment requires, where the materials received are

cc&maicaticna materials as opposed to narcotics or guns or
co-ntsabend, where they’re communications materials, the First

23
Amendment requires an adversary hearing as a precondition of
seiasure.
Q

As compared with other types of materials where

j&.x part® warrants. may issue?MR, DWYER;

Yes.

Exactly.

Upon a showing of

probable cause in other connotations.
Q

But no case here has applied Marcus to a film

yet?
MR. DWYER;

Not yet.

Six Circuit Courts have done

sot and —
Q

Lee didn’t talk about adversary hearings, did it?

MR. DWYER;

Lee did not talk about it.

Lee merely

held that the hearing there did not focus searchingly ora the
question of obscenity.
Q

There was no search warrant at all here, was

there?
'MR. DWYER; There was no search warrant —
Q

It was an arrest warrant.

ME. DWYER;
Q

And the search was incident to the arrest?

MR. DWYER;
Q

Merely an arrest warrant -~

Yes.

This is in the First Amendment sires, and

;.:.srsj.f,.i lav? has to be applied, and the Court has so' held as

to books, in A Quantity of Books v. Kansas.
Ho-;?, it’s been argued that a distinction should be
made between aeisure for purposes of destruction and seiaurefor purposes of evidence, but —
0

But you wouldn’t say that in Marcus that an

adversary hearing would have been required to seise one copy
of a took, of which the distributor had a thousand?
MR. DWYERs

I think so, yes.

Because, in the first

place, how was the fact established that he has a thousand
copies, if there's no adversary hearing?
1 think c:c parte hearings have to be completely

distrusted where communications materials are at stake, and
seizure is the object of the State.
In actual practice at the lower court levels, that
is particularly vital because so many Justices of. the Peace
are ill-informed on First Amendment lav;, and if there's not an
adversary hearing, they tend very readily to authorise the
seisv.re of books and motion pictures just on a showing of
offensivs-noss or disagreeability to them.

.And the only sound

protection, in my view, is the protection of the adversary
hearing.

25
Q

'Sell, yera don't —- yon would sayr if it turns

out that there ware a thousand copies in the store and only one
w£.u f'-luedf the burden on First Amendment rights is .such that
there: should have been a prior adversary hearing?

MR. DWYhRs Well# l think there should have been,
because# to reach that result# the only way to reach it is
either to hold an ess parte hearing# in which case one rims
the appreciable'risk# as the Court said in the Kansas case,
that a de facto prior restraint will occur»
uddersary hearing.

Or to have an

the quantity of duplicates available.
Q

Whit if a policeman on the street in New York

City walks into a store and, sees., is an eyewitness to the sale
by th .. proprietor of the hardest imaginable kind of pornography
Couldn't he just arrest that person on the spot, assuming that
Hew York has a valid criminal statute covering that situation?
MR. DWYER*

I think he should not be able to# Mr,

Justice Stewart# because the policeman's idea of what
constitutes hard-core pornography —
0

Well, I'm assuming it's the — your idea as to

the worst possible thing you could imagine.
MR. DWYERs

I would still say, even if it's roy idea,

a court should determine in an adversary hearing before that
material is seised.

Otherwise, the protections are forfeited.

It's a matter of method and procedure, 1 think# rather than an

26
assumption ip. advance that a certain type of material, or
certain itero of material is obscene and not constitutionally
protected.
As a matter of procedure, the only safe way to
proceed is the adversary hearing method, and I believe it can
be seuared practically with the demands of law enforcement.
Thank you vary much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, Mr. Dwyer.

Mr. Ludwig.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP CURTIS LUDWIG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE RESPONDENT
MR. LUDWIGj

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
The motion picture “Carmen Baby", displayed on a
large outdoor screen, is obscene.

Its dominant them© appeals

to the prurient interest in sex, and the court below has so
held.
How, considering the use, the manner of display, the
Washington State Suprams Court, following © careful review of
the decisions of this Court, properly and justifiably found
this movie obscene.
The Washington state Court —
Q

Had there bean a civil determination prior to

that time?
MR. XjUSWIGs

Ho, - there hadn't, Mr. Justice Douglasy

27
none at all in my juri

agarding this movie or any

other, to my knowledge.
You asked earlier about the standard in Washington
regarding punishment or penalties in general,

X know of no

other reported cases concerning obscenity sustaining a
conviction in our case, in our jurisdiction, other than State
vs . Iiabs.
Q

Mr. Ludwig, I read Justice McGovern*s opinion

as finding the picture only partially obscene.

X didn't read

him as finding it obscene in the traditional sense of an entire
judgment on the whole film.
MR. LUDWIG;

Am I wrong?

X think

Mr. Justice or former Justice

McGovern*s opinion was probably the best written brief submitted,
more or lees, to this Court, in a way.

What he said was that

the dominant theme of that movie appealed to the prurient
interest in sex and in the context of its display it was obscene.
That court, and in their opinion, indicated, or were
obviously not judging the obscenity in the abstract.

The

declaration of obscenity was aided by a specific set of
circumstances involving outdoor display of a movie which, the
opinion says, had a dominant theme appealing to the prurient
interest.

&

Blow, I like to distinguish this —
Q

But the court said, Judge McGovern's opinion

at least said that if we were to apply the strict rules of

Rotht- the film

C'Baby ”

probably would pass the definition

of obscenity te st „
MB. LUDWIGs

Yes, Tour Honor.

I am aware of that,

and 1 was going to try to lea.fi into how X feel he interpreted
thatr or how I interpret than.
M X started to indicater 18d like to make &
fi isstinction between State of Washington vs.Rabo» the opinion
i;n the court below' and this Court’s opinion in & Book vs.
Attorney General.
1 set out Oil page 9 of our brief a short excerpt
from that opinion»

It was expressly indicated by Mr. Justice

Brennan that that material was judged in the abstract, and
that it was expressly pointed out that circumstances of
production, sale, and publicity are relevant to a determination
of obscenity.
The petitioner here has continually referred to the
film aa ncn-obscona.

That’s the language of his brief? that’s

his coamontK to the Court today.

H© suggests in his reply

brief, on page 1, and he suggested to Your Honors today, that
•;o practically concede that non-obscenity.
On the contrary, the respondent urges, and the court
below determined that it is in fact obscene.

Petitioner’s

conviction under the State's obscenity statute rests solely
on that determination»
Mow, what the court below and what Justice McGovern

said in his opinion non simply that in an abstract determina­
tion the film would probably pass the Roth-'Me; «airs definition
of obscenity.

Thu opinion below suggests, in paraphrasing,

that some might find it not utterly without redeeming social

value», o
But in the contents of. its display in the outdoor
theater, foisted off on the nearby residents, it was in fact
obscene.
In. that particular regard, I have noted with interest
the'Morality amicus curiae brief which urges that the "utterly
without redeeming social value** is not part of the test for
obscenity established by Roth.
However, we need not reach that issue here.

In my

view, whether social value is or is not a part of the test'
should be important only in an abstract determination of
obscenity.
I say that because, assuming that Morality is wrong
in their amicus brief, and assuming that’ "utterly without
redeeming social value” is a part of the test, and assuming
for -the moment that "Carmen Baby" has some redeeming social
valu.;-, that social value is certainly going to be lost or
obscured to those unwitting, unwilling viewers of this outdoor
display.
Row, petitioner Rahs completely overlooks that fact.
fuf ho suggests in his’brief, on page 20 that if the house»

30
holder took.time tc watch the entire film, it would presumably

r- ;

■ ho

oc:\ ati bufcional

• protection •

EoWf i'th's really a novel, unique idea.

Picture, if

you will, a homeowner who views an erotic scene, very
offensive to him.

Now, Petitioner would ask him to go ahead

and view the rest of the scene so the petitioner's constitutional
rights would he protected.

!2e views a little bit, but they

ask him to go ahead then and watch more of this offensive
material.
It hasn’t been argued orally today, but it was
quarreled somewhat in the brief that the Washington Court,
if the lower court and the Supreme Court were permitted to
consider this film "Carmen Baby" as the residents, as the
arresting officer outside the screen, or perhaps the younger
children had, without the sound track,

Not-/, if that's the way

it’s being displayed to those people outside the theater,
why should he quarrel with us judging it in that same vein?
If you don't have the sound track, if you're displaying it
without a sound track, then it should be judged without a sound
track.
For these reasons

1

say.,, whether or not social value

is a part of an abstract determination should not be a deciding
factor in this case.
This is an outdoor display of a motion picture with
dominant thorns appealing to the prurient interest in sexs a

31
.•©vie v.-ith erotic sa&aal scenes, respondent urges that such a
set of circumstances is amply sufficient within the guidelines
of this Court to establish the obscenity of this display.
Q

What decisions of this Court do you rely on?

MR. LUDWIG:

Your Honor, we rely on those mentioned

by Justice McGovern, the Ginzburg case, the Mishkin case, the
Redrup case, and numerous other decisions I think of concurring
opinions of Chief Justice Warren, cited in the brief in one
case, wherein he stated that it was not the film that was on
trial but the defendant; it’s not the film but the manner of
use in display.
Q

Well, her© there was no — there's no claim on

your part, as I understand it, no evidence that there was
anything like the so-called pandering that the —
MR. LUDWIG;
Q

No pandering, no, Your Honor.

— Court found in Ginzburg; is that true?

MR. LUDWIGi

Yes, Your Honor, I think the prime

reliance by the Washington Court in the opinion was Redrups
an assv.lt on individual privacy.
Q

What they're assuming is that your statute

doesn't prohibit that.
ME. LUDWIG:

Our statute, Your Honor, prohibits the

snowing of obscene material.
Q

Right.

MR* LUDWIG:

And you —
Within

indicated that this movia had one of what

Q

fchi

.

.

...

MR. LUDWIG; And I think this Coart, Your Honor, in
ail respect, has also hold that in certain nettings fches-e
things may be obscene, whereas they would not otherwise be
obscene in the abstract.
Perhaps some would find social value in Mr. Ginzburg
material, or some social value in Mr. Mishkin's material, or
perhaps, if there was not an obtrusive d i s p 1 a ye so me wou 1 <3
find social value., ■
In an abstract determination, we8 re saying it may
probably pass? but in the context of it s use and.exhibition
it's obscene to those viewers.
Q

Well, you may think so, but as X read the

opinion of Mr. Justice McGovern, or Judge McGovern, he didn't,
ha said there was one ©f the elements, but — well, I've
already read this, it's on page SO of the Appendix.
MR. LUDWIG:
0

Yes, Your Honor.

Said this doesn't meet the criteria of Roth,

didn't he?
MR. LUDWIG5

Yes, and as X understand it, he's

■chinking of Roth judging this film in an abstract setting and
not in the context of its outdoor obtrusive display.
0

And yon don't have any statutes or ordinance

that covers it, —

33
SR. LUDWIG?
0

rn, Your Honor, we do not.

-- whether there are obtrusive displays.

MR. LUDWIG?

We had at that time, and we still have,

we hnd a general obscenity statute.

It has been changed;

the

only -Ti ate rial charge is protection for minors and juveniles.
Q

Mr. Ludwig, is if your contention that when

ycu*i": coaling with people who are unwilling viewers' or with
juveniles that the typo of material which the State may
proscribe .need not necessarily meet all three of the obscenity
tests;?
MR. LUDWIG t

I think this Court has indicated that

in a case for concern of juveniles you need a statute
expressing that limited concern, but I don’t think this Court,
as I've reviewed the opinions and decisions, has said that you
need a special statute to prohibit pandering, that you need a
special statute to prohibit what-. Mr. Mishkin was doing, or
that yea need a special statute to take care of the obtrusive
iisplay that was not present in the cases reversed by Redrup.
There*s no —
Q

Well, let’s assume that this movie was — I

haver.*t soon any movies lately, but «•«*■ ’’Goldilocks and the Three
Dears'*, and that the light and the noise and the traffic
bothered householders? that the showing of the movie bothered
the nearby householders•

Could you get a conviction under this

34
MR. LUDWIG?
Q

Not an obscenity conviction, Your Honor.

Well, you did with this movie, which your court

has found is not obscene.
MR,. LODI’IGs

On the theory that because of the

contextual setting they said, it was —
Q

Because it bothered the nearby residents, you

say, or potentially, or might have.
MR. LUDWIG:

Because, as this Court has said perhaps

in tfc© recent case of Cohan, whatever else may give rise to
the State's broader power to protect or interfere in this
field, it must be in some way erotic.

The lights, the noise,

those are nuisance matters, unless you have —
Q

And I presume that your State could legislate

against those nuisance matters, could it not?
ME.

. WIG;

Don't you think?

Yes, I presume it could, Your Honor, b

I wonder if we buy and accept petitioner's argument wholeheartedly
that we're talking about a fundamental First Amendment guarantee,
if he's right, then how can we restrict a constitutional
guarantee by statute?
Q

I don't think we can.

Well, I don't think there's any claim here that

a constitutional :gtta'r&fltee issues if you show a bright light
in some

idy's window or to make a .lot of noise —
ME, LUDWIG5
Q

No? I'm sorry,

I misunderstood that.

Well, aren’t you saying, Mr. Ludwig, that when

you're dealing with obscenity in the contest of juveniles, or

35
in

cIk.

ssase, in the context of unwilling viewers, it may have

a broader definition?
MR» LUDWIG?

It may have.

Yes, Your Honor, that's

our feeling, that in a blatant# obtrusive display of an erotic
'

:

■

-V

sexual scene, that, maybe all we need is the dominant appeal to
the prurient interest.

Anci I think the other cases have so

indicated.
Perhaps we're her® on a case of first impression, and
we’re pleased to be hare on that basis.
Petitioner here also quarrels, though, with the
•' language of the opinion below in reference to the display as
offensive,
Now, 1 think Using the descriptive term "offensive**
does not depart from the precedents, it does not involve any
change in the law.

She use of the term “offensive" is simply

a further descriptive word.

It is obscene, according to the

opinion of the court below, and obscenity is offensive to most
Americans.
Now, this was recognized in the report of the
Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, we cite it at page 12
of or.r brief.

The. reply brief of petitioner points out that

wa meyfo© didn’t cite it all, and that the Commission also

.••rocon.mended a particular legislation for this., problem»
, that’s very simple, and very • easy to understand
r.aa report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography were

36
simply being consistent.
They further recommended removal of roost obscenity
•■statutes.

Naturally, if we followed their over-all recommenda­

tions , then we wouldn’t even have the general obscenity
statute, and w® would have to legislate a particular statute
to correct this problem of offensive, obscene displays, which
they recognised and found as a matter of fact.
Q

This conviction was under 9.68.010(2), was it?

MS. LUDWIG:

Yes, 3lr. Justice.

Basically, this case, the opinion below relying on
kodrt.o,- I think taking the over-all obscenity ©icture with all
of the cases that wa’v© had before this Court, this case
recognised the right of privacy in a situation where we
shouldn’t have to judge this film in the abstract but judge it
on its effect and its manner of display, the use and conduct
of the exhibitor.
This case presents a problem of protecting the
individual’s right of privacy, not the —
Q

Was this film — did they sell tickets to

children to see this film?

MR. LUDWIG:

It's not in the record, Your Honor.

There is testimony in the r©cord from Mr. Rabe that whan he
had * film there for adults only, ha hired an off-duty policeman to check identification . But, as I reviewed the transcript,
the record before the Court , I can’t say whether he’s testifying

37
about this particular film or s previous one.
Q

But there isn't any evidence# 2 suppose, either#

then, that this film was designed for any other group than
adults?
HR. LUDWIG:

Ko, there is not, Your Honor. The

record is void on that regard.
0

Or any other group than just average adults?

HR. LUDWIG:
Q

That's correct, Mr. Justice.

In the first paragraph of the opinion, on page

81, as I read it, the court states that Rahe was "exhibiting
the notion picture ‘Carmen Baby' and had imposed no age
restriction upon the paying audience.”
How do you construe that?
MR. LUDWIG:
Q

I'm sorry, Mr. Justice, 1 —

This is on page 81 of your Appendix,

the opinion of Judge McGovern.
Q

The third line of the second paragraph.

MR. LUDWIG:

All right.

My recollection is not

accurate,'because I’m sure the Washington Court, in writing this
opinion, had the statement of facts before it, and accepted
that as in the. record.
Q

What page is that?

Q

Pago 81.

MR. LUDWIG:
Q

Page 81 of the Appendix.

And then on page 95 and 97, the same opinion

38
of the court escplicitly refuse-3 and found it impossible to
ground its decision on the fact that this film 'was exhibited to
minors, did it not? ■
M2, LUDWIGs

Yes, Your Honor, because they ware

.relying substantially on..Redrug»r and 2 think Eedrup stood for
the proposition that to protect juveniles you had to have a
specific limited statute? whereas the Washington Court and
respondent feels that Redrup also stood for the fact that you
didn't have to have such a statute where you're concerned with
a blatant and obtrusive display that affects somebody else's
privacy,
Petitioner argued in his brief —

Q

Well, is it your position that this is just as

though they set up in a park downtown, ©cross the street from
an elementary school, and the showing allowed juveniles to
■•«ilk in to see it?

Th&t is, allowing it, showing it in

cirst.i"StGae;fci.:3

juveniles could not be precluded from seeing

it*

Ure you suggesting this showing was inviting them to

see it?
MB. LUDWIGs

I sea no effect one way or the other,

Mr, Chief Justice, if it’s shown outdoors in a manner where
unwitting, unwilling, or even willing youngsters can see it,
’whether it b® in a drive-in theater or in a park, whether they
are admitted by choico or whether they're able to see it
frsa of charge*

1' sec no distinction there.

39
Concerning the right of privacy# petitioner suggests
that that's dependent on statute for its existence, and it
cites our court below as saying that we had not even
recognised the common law right of privacy.
But the opinion goes on to point out# and respondent
submits# that the right of privacy is as fundamental a
constitutional right os any other constitutional right# just
as fundamental as the right of free speech.
Q

Well# of course» the constitutional right of

privacy is assertable only against government# isn't it?
ME. LUDWIG:

X think a strict interpretation of the

ninth Amendment may be.

Q

Well# of the Constitution# of the whole

Constitution# the right of privacy# if it's a constitutional
rlghu# insofar as a constitutional right# it's assertable
ctly against government# State or Federal.

Any other right

of privacy is a matter of tort law# is it not?

And it's a

privato action.
MR. LUDWIG:
Q

A nuisance action# Mr. Justice.

Yes.

ME. LUDWIG:

Perhaps, 1 think the State if they have

a criminal statute prohibiting obscene or obtrusive displays
has a right to protect that right as well as other rights for
the people.

Stanley vs. Georgia# Griswold vs. Connecticut

represent that right# I think#

n

•

■

l-oll ;■

hhat'p v; right against intrusion by

itional tight.
LUDWIG:

I understand that, Your Honor# and I

'jcort that. But I think# in answer to the petitioner's saying
that it's not a right dependent on statute# I think it’s a
•constitutional rightf a common law right he's talking about;
and 1 think the State or the Sovereign State of Washington owe
the protection of those constitutional rights.
In affect# what# it seems to me# is a balancing of
rights? a balancing of the individual’s right of privacy#'the
home-owner's right of privacy against the producer of the
motion picturos * fundamental right of free expression.

The

right, of privacy is just as sacred to the homeowner as the
right of free expression is to the producer.

'And, interestingly# I think this case can be decided
.tv rscognising' that right of privacy# protecting the borne™
owner's right of privacy# without denying or discouraging the
movie maker's right to produce and display what he wishes.
Q

What i.'s the homeowner's right of privacy?

Not

to be disturbed by the -picture* there# the noise# or just what
is it?
MH* LUDWIGs

I think# Mr. Justice Marshall# the

ho /oc-rner's -right of privacy is to be free from obscene#

erotic, sexual scenes.

Q

Where in the world do you get that from?

you can11 do it without the statute.
Mow, what's your answer to that?
MR. LUDWIG;
statute is sufficient.

Your Honor» I think the general obscenity
Mr. Dwyer has been kind enough to tell

:b3 that our general obscenity statute is dated perhaps 1909.
But other people have convicted under general obscenity
statutes, with guidelines and decisions from this Court.
I think the general obscenity statute is neither •
vague nor overbroad, applied to an obtrusive display of a
motion picture, foisted off on residents, if the dominant
theme of that material appeals to the prurient interest in
sax,
Q

Well, why would the motion picture have to have

that dominant theme?If the motion picture, the noise and
light of which bothers householders, why couldn’t you convict
•?omefc'.>&Y under the statute for that kind of invasion of privacy?
iaeavco it’s been found that this movie is not obscene in the
constitutional sense.- .•
MR. LUDWIG;

Well> &r. Justice Stewart, I think noise

and light is other than erotic sexual scenes, and X go back to
Cohen y. California, where —«■ the exact words escape me, but,

Weil,; 7. guess — thank you.

MR. LUDWIG$

Petitioner says that it is a vague, a

guide less and ex post facto decision, that there are no guide­
lines.

Clearly it's i© snore an ©x post facto or retroactive

decision than this Court'@ opinion was in Roth , when it
judicially defined obscenity as material dealing with a prurient

.

—*• or dominant theme appealing to the prurient interest in
SSSo

tod as to guidelines that fail notice, the statute
gives, the notice when it proscribes obscenity.

The previous

rules; of the Court set the standards and convey sufficient
warnings.
1 said in the brief that perhaps the rating may be
the standards-, and that's not accurate? as an afterthought,
X see that that isn't a precise legal guideline. The guideline
should be whether the dominant theme appeals to the prurient
interest in sex.

tod the X-rafcing, perhaps as a practical

matter, would be cf seme further value or notice to the
distributor that it -very well may have a dominant theme which
appeals to the prurient interest.
Q

Why didn't your court also base its judgment

or. perhaps the special appeal of this film to children, or the
special offensiveneas of it to children?
Ml-h- LUDWIGj

Your Honor, 1 think perhaps they could

have.

All right, you amended the statute, but they

.3aid 'dint under the state of the statuteas the statutory law
tfcen was, they could not base it on its effect upon children
nicm 7« the law, the obscenity law wasn’t tailored ' spe eifica.tt
with respect to children»
MR. LUDWIG;

Didn’t express a limited concern for

juveniles, as was suggested by Redrup, and Radrup was a case
that they war© relying on,

Q

Yss, but how could it base its decision on its

affect on adjoining homeowners, when the statute wasn’t
tailored with specific concern to them?
MR. LUDWIG*

Wall, as 2 read Radrup, it didn’t

require a special statutory concern.

It. merely said, in none

of the cases was there a claim that the statute in question
reflected a specific and limited State concern for juveniles.
Q

So you’re suggesting that you don’t agree

with your court, then?
MR, LUDWIG; Wo,. I do, Your Honor.

1 think they

relied on Roc;«ruo, and for this reason; and then it goes on to

says

In none was they® any suggestion of aw

assault upon

In&ividsvel privacy by publication, in a manner so obtrusive
as to sabs it impossible for an unwilling individual to avoid
exposure to it.
On one. situation it required a. statuteP on the other
our court felt it did not in Itedrujp.
Q

about ordinary due process of law?
MR., LUDWIGt
Q

Cole y- Arkansas»

I’m not familiar with Cole, Mr, 'JusticeW»5.

Wall., a variety of the cases that say that, a

criminal statute has to give fair notice both to the citizenry

what it in that’s illegal.
MR* LUDWIG % .7, think w© do give fair notice by our
statute pro .scribing obscenity and then defining obscenity sir.?
material dealing with.~~ having a dominant theme appealing to
the prurient interent ? and then saying that other things are
relevant in the determination of that obscenity.

Q

Well, I’ve just read your statute, and it doesn't

say any of those things,
MR, LUDWIG:

I know. The statute is a general

obscenity statute, Your Honor.
1 have jnst a moment left, and the most important
;>art of t'dio case, as it appeals to a prosecutor and of most
concern to law enforcement agencies, involves the procedure for

-• ■:i:.;;uro of evidence.

This Court• s cases of Marcus and of

■ '•itity of Books, and. Lee Art Theatre are the only cases,

'I think, on, point of seizure of this type of material.

They

are logical and clear* They present no problem. They are
oases which ware decided on the basis of the nature and purpose
of the seizure.

doss net support the proposition that a prior adversary

hearing is necessary? only that a warrant or seizure requires
.ore than a conclusory affidavit of an officer.
The confusion seems to arise in the lower courts
from the failure to recognise a basic distinction, a distinection between seizure and its suppression, as Marcus and

& Quantity ofnBooks in seizure aimed at securing evidence.
Metzger, decided in 1968, prior to Leo Art Theatre,

Interestingly enough,

that was the first Circuit Court case on this point, and
said a prior adversary hearing was necessary.

But that was

a soi;a where they had seized four copies of a film, the same
film, for pro3®cution. And they said you can’t do that.

Four

.'-opieis as distinguished from on® for evidence is quite a
distinction.

The court ordered them to deliver that one.

And front there on out, other courts have followed
feliat, other courts have suggested other alternatives.
