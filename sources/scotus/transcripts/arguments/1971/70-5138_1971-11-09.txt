MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Ws will hear arguments in

5138, Parham against Cortes®.
Mr. Scholl, you may proceed whenever you*rs ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. SCHOLL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT'S
MR. SCHOLL?

Mr. Chief Justice, —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

S?e'll try to complete

tonight, if it's at all possible.
MR. SCHOLL:

Okay.

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Courts
In this case, this is another action which is a class
action, brought by a group of consumers. This la similar, in :
©ffoct, to the Svmrb action, which was also a class action,
instituted in behalf of all of the residents of a State, which
had been subjected to a certain procedure.
For that reason I'd like to refer to the plaintiffs
appellant® as the consumers, although I think that's partially
a misnomer in this case.
The appellees I will refer to as the creditors again,
although, again,-, it's partially a misnomer»
While yhat is in question in this case is tha
Pennsylvania procedure of replevin-with-bond? now the
Pennsylvania procedure of replevin-with-bond is similar in
many ways to the Florid© procedure, which was considered in

4
the Fuentes case.

However, there are

in Pennsylvania.
As was pointed out in the arguments .in the ffeeatae
case* the replevin seisur® in Florida is part of s proceeding
which has already been commenced* which will ultimately
determine the right© .of the parties to the particular geeda
which ar© seised.
That i-e not fch© case in the Pennsylvania replevinwith-bond procedure.

All that a creditor may file in

Pennsylvania to commence a replevin-wifch-bond procedure area
four thingst

on® of these things is an entry of appearance;

the other is an affidavit to what the value of the goods are
that he*s going to go out and have seised; the third thine; is
a bond* th® bond must be in double the value of -She goods that
are being seized; and th© fourth tiling is ms roly a precipe which
is directed to th© prothonotary asking or ordering th© profchono-”
tary to issue a writ of repl©vin-with~bond.
Now* what need fc© included in such a precipe?
really* nothing* except it*s just a. direction.

Well*

The form just

is a direction to the prothonotary to issue th® writ of
replevin.

Th® prothonotary., as X mentioned in th® Swarb case

this morning* is merely a court clerk.

All that the court

clerk does is examine fcb see whether in fact the four pieces of
paper that have to be filed have been filed.

And if they have*

he then ministerially issues th® writ of replavin-with-bond to

th© sheriff^ and the sheriff is required to go out and forcibly
s®iz© the property from the consumor.
Now, this is distinct in ~~ a distinction in the
Pennsylvania procedure, not only from t'h© Florida proendtsm,
which was considered in Puentes, but also «v?a the procedures
in N©w York, which was the subject of the Lapreaaa vs. Raymours
Furniture case, and in California, which was the subject of the.
Blair vs. Pifcchess case.

Both of these cacer held that the

procedures involved there were unconstitutional.
another important feature ©f the Pennsylvania
procedure, ’which is probably distinct from Florida, because it’snot actually the beginning of an ongoing process which is going
to determine the party's rights to the goods, is that for all
practical purposes, when the soisur© is made by the sheriff,
that's feh© end of the proceeding.
Usually nothing further is filed.

How, there are
i

three possible ways in which the consumer can possibly gat
that property back, and these three only.
The first iss

ha can file the .counter-bond, within

72 hours ©f the seizure of the property.
■

"» Q

When is he advised of that?

MR, SCHOLL;

Well, he's never advised of it.

In

fact, in the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure there's a
if

_ ••

form set out, it’s Rule 1354, and it is included in the Appendix
— X believe it's included in our Appendix, Appendix A to our

6
brief.

And the fora has nothing in it which states that the

consumar can file a counter-bond to recovar the property.
Q

So that this part of the Pennsylvania procedure

appears to b@ identical with that in Florida?
MR. SCHOLL*
Q

i think that —

In 12 hours, double the amount ~

MR. SCHOLL*
Q

Y©3„

Seventy-two hours —

— and bond in double: the amount of the property ,

and no notios?
MR. SCHOLL*
Q

That'S right.

X® that it?

MR. SCHOLL*

That's right.

Thar® ar® two other ways that the consumer could
possibly get the property back eventually.

The one is that ha

could file a precipe with the court, which would require the
creditor to coram©nce an action to finally determine the rights
to the goods.

Of course, in the intervening time, until that

complaint is filed, and until it comes t© a hearing, the
consumer is going to b© deprived of the goods »
The only other possible way that the consumer could
get the goods back would be to commence an action of replevinwith-bond himself, and gat the goods back from the creditor.
Of course this is also going to require him to put up the bond.
Q

You said that the profeh *— prothenofcary — how

to you pronounce that?

7

It’s prothanctary.

ME. SCHOLL:
Q

Prothono&ary.

ME. SCHOLL:
Q

You can refer fc© him as the clerk.

Right.
[Laughter,1
— is nothing more nor less than a clerk of the

court.
MR. SCHOLL:
Q

Exactly.

Well, dess that imply that this is filed in a

court?
MR. SCHOLLs

It is filed with the prothonotary f who

is the court clerk: and to that extent it, is filed in a court.
.

Q

. v

In a court, just as anything filed in this

Court is filed with our Clerk.

Is that it?

MR. SCHOLLs That’s right.
■> >'*

Q

•

We don’t call him by that title, it’s probably

because we can’t pronounce it.

/

[Laughter. 1
MR. SCHOLL:

Of course it never goes before a judge,

at any point, in the replevin-vfith-bond procedure.
well, it may never go to a judge.
will.

Until —

In fact, it probably never

But certainly not before? the seizure.
Q

How can it?

MR. SCHOLL:

How can it get there?

Well, the only way it possibly could is

if the consumer doss something, files a precipe and makes the

8
creditor file a complaint,, then that complaint will eventually
get before —
Q

Well, what happens if the consumer files this

double bond?
MR. SCHOLLs
Q

Wall, if ho —

And gets the property bach, then what happens?

MR. SCHOLL:

Well, then th® creditor — it's the

creditor’s move, .so to speak.

The creditor is going to have to

s

do something to get —
Q

And what is "something*1?

MR. SCHOLL* Well, he probably would file — would
follow it up by filing an action? file a complaint at that
point, because then he would have to got the rights to the
goods determined before he would be able to gat the property.
Q

And that thing would get you before a judge?

MR. SCHOLL:

Yes. That would get you before a judge,

so if the consumer can come up with the counter-bond, the
creditor is going to have to go before the judge to get that
property*
But I think fch© problem is, with the counter-bond
proceeding, especially when on© considers the:; appellants in
this record,

w© have two welfare recipients, we have the

Parhams and the Washingtons, Mr©. Washington, both of whom are
welfare recipients*

They aro required to coma up with a counter-

bond within 72 hours or they’re not going to get the property

9
back.
Q

Now, you say — they have three alternatives, vr.

X understood it.

On© was to come up with a counter-bond within

72 hours, —
MR. SCHOLL: That's right.
Q

— and that gives them back th© property.

MR. SCHOLL3
Q

Then they’ll gat th© property back.

Then th© litigation in controversy.

And th©

other was to file a precipe.

MR. SCHOLL:

Yes, but the trouble with a precipe

proceeding is that they won't get th© property back uhf-a they
file th© precipe.
Q

The precipe —

Th© precipe compels the plaintiff to file a

complaint, is that it?
MR. SCHOLL:

Right.

If you file a precipe, th&a

you're back to where Puentes is, you're back to wh©re the
Florid© proceeding is, then —

Q

Where th® Florida proceeding begins.

MR. SCHOLL: Right.
Q

Exactly.

And you con always do that, as of right, by

filing a precipe?
MR. pSCHOLL:
Q

That'a right.

Without filing any bond?

MR, SCHOLL:

Yes, font you have — no, you're not

really — not at any time.

You do have to file the precipe,

10
1 believ© it's within 30 days.
Q

Yeae within a period of tims.

And then the

third alternative is to yourself, is to the defendant himself,
to file a counter replevin»
MR. SCHOLLs
Q

Take fch© offense.

MR. SCHOLL:
Q

That is always permissible*

Y©-s.

MR. SCHOLL:
Q

Right.

X think it would be in any jurisdiction.

Replevin is sort of for personal property what

habeas corpus is for human beings, isn’t it?
MR. SCHOLLi
Q

Well, X never thought of that analogy.

in a manner ©£ speaking,

MR. SCHOLL:

Perhaps it is,

Wow, I think —* we've already had some discussion on
due process, and I think the due process claim her© is relatively
clear.

We sat during the Sniadach cm® and also her© in the'/

Fuantas case.

It is that there is a s@isux® of the property of

the consumer without his having had. any notice or opportunity
t© b© heard prior to the time at which he's deprived of that
property.
Essentially that is the due process claim,
Q

That's so much that ho gats no notice, that

within 72 hours he can file a counter-bond?
MR. SCHOLL: Well, ha doesn't get — ha doesn't get

II
notice of that*
Q

Mo, no, no,

I'm just trying to.got clear ©a it.

You said that your due process claim deals primarily with the
failure to give my notice or opportunity to be hoard before
the property is seised.
MR. SCHOLL:
Q

That's correct, Your Honor.

And not. with the fact that he does not gftt a

notice that he has ?2 hours within' which to file a counterbound?
MR. SCHOLL: That is correct. Your Honor.

Although

I think -tii® fact that h@ doesn't get notic® of the couator"
bend accentuates the fact that the seizure is unlikely to b®
a temporary seizure Q

What would happen if Mr. Cortes© had —

MR. Scholl* Well, he's the profchonota.ry,
Q

I'm sorry,

Mir, Parham had — have I got the

right name?
MR. SCHOLL:
Q

Yes, I think so.

[Laughing.]

If the conditional vend©© had filed this

counter replevin, how long could that process go on?

He files

a bond in double the amount of th© value of th© property „ and
so then th© sheriff seises the property back, and th© original
claimant has 72 hours to get th© ball back in th© other court.
How long does that go on?
MR. SCHOLL:

Well, it could go on, I guess, for any

12
length of tim®.
Q

I would suggest -«■

Q

With the merits of the css® novas: determined?

MR, SCHOLL!

That's right.

1 think it's unlikely

that it would go on past tin© first seizure, fcecatvj® Mr* Parham
being a welfare recipient is not going to be able to coma up
with the bond.
Q

Well, let’s as®use© he has a rich friend.

MU. SCHOLL:
Q
happens.”

But, presuming that —

Who says, "Let's play this game and see what

Then what would happen?
MR. SCHOLL:
Q

It would just keep going indefinitely.

With never any resolution of the merits of the

controversy, is that it?
MR. SCHOLL: That8® correct, Your Honor.
Q

I submit

Q

Have--you ever known this to —

Q

2 submit that's not true, that what happens

then is that the creditor files a legal action and it's tried
out in court.
MR, SCHOLL:
Q

X think Your Honor is right in that

I9m sure.

MR. SCHOLL:

«»- that is exactly what would happen.

But I was answering Justice Stewart's ip;.:st:icn as to what
could possibly happen, and it would b© possible? if the creditor

13
decided to fo© stubborn about it, try to outlast the consumer, ~
0

Well, have you ever known of on instance —

Q

Never heard of such»

Q

that has happened?

HR* SCHOLLi
Q
Q
Q

I have never heard of that happening, no

I've never heard of such as that.
Ha could file a lawsuit# couldn’t he?
Sure*

MR. SCHOLL:

How, the court below recognised that

the case of Sniadach vs. Family Finance Corporation, which of
course concerned a pr®judgment wage garnishment a©isura - in
Wisconsin, which this Court held was violative of due process
because it deprived the consumer in that case of wages prior
to a determination of the eraditor5s rights to it# was closely
analogous to this case-»

And X think that principally the

best way of presenting this case on appeal is fc© discuss what
th© court below said and try to establish how what the court
i4

said did not have support in either.
How, the court relies heavily on the fact that what
\ •

was concerned with in Sni&d&ch, what this Court was concerned
t-i.3» aavue-r?* uu. «<-.'•» >.*

with in Sniadach was whgefe.

The court in fact ruled that

because Snladach concerned wages, therefore Sniadach can’t
possibly have any direct relevance on this case where there’s a
seisure ©f personal property*"
I would submit that there are two rationales by which

14
the reasoning that, fch© court, below suggested can be rebut.ted»
I think the first arises when ©ns considers what what is
challenged here is a procedure by which certain property is
taken.

The taking of the property# of course# is an instance

of the procedure# but it's the taking of the property before
there*s any determination that the party getting it has any
right to it# that is really in question.

Had should it make

any differens® at all# whether it'c wages or whether it's
personal property or whatever it is# that’s being s-3dsod#
prior t© there being any notice and opportunity to ho heard.

I think that this Court's decision in Kelly vs.
Goldberg# which# of course, concerned welfare benefits# and
the Bell va. Burson case# which has already been discussed#
suggests that this Court did not intend the language in
Snladhch to be delimited, or did not intend to delimit its
ruling in the Sniadada case solely to wages.
However# I think there’s an alternative ground on
which th© court's reasoning can be rebutted.

And that, ie that

the property seised here# which is the personal property ©£
poor persons, is equally as specialised as th© wages that were
concerned — that the court was concerned with in Sniadaoh.
a*
CS*w«

What we have her®, in fact in feh® case of the Parhams#
we have a bed# a table and stools# which were simply seined..
Mow, these are things which the Parham®, as welfare recipients,
simply cannot go out and replace.

It would take many months

3.5

o£ saving and a van then 'they parhaps wouldn't bs able to save
enough to replace th© goods that are 'seised.
In the cas® of Mrs. Washington, it’s the clothes
cabinets that her daughter's and her son's clothes had been
kept in that wore seised.

She was forced to simply put the

clothes on the floor, and just not put them in a cabinet.
Q

Now, that's the case, the Washington case

doesn’t involve a conditional sale at all, does it?

That's

an argument between a man and his wife over tha custody.of one.
of their children.

.Is that right?

MR,. SCHOLL?

Weilf. that is right, four Honor» And

I think this points out another flaw in the court’s reasoning!
the court below, in,its discussion of the ssisure, constantly
points to the fact that there's'an extraordinary creditor
interest her©, because the creditor has title and security
interest in the property which is seised.
In the case of the Washingtons, we don't ©von have a
debtor-creditor situation.
Q

That's what 1 thought.

MR. SCHOLL;

So how can the fact that title or

security interest in the goods have any real relevance to how
replevin in Pennsylvania works?
And tha answer is that it doesn’t.

The Pennsylvania

replevin procedure actually permits any person to seize* anything
t

from anybody, as long as they can coma up with th© bond.

IS
For instance, I could probably rap levy this choir
her®, if I had a mind to do it

I might be liable in som® ofch-sr

court for abuse of process amntu&lly ; but certainly the
replevin statutes would permit ms to take it.
Q

But there are a lot of statutes' which, if

abused, can produce these anomalous results that aren't used
that way.

That speculation doesn't get us very far, does it?
MR. SCHOLL:

Well, I would submit that the Washington

case does submit an instance of abuse,

we have, in that case,

and that is the case before this Court -Q

You’re talking about replevin of a piece of

merchandise now.
MR. SCHOLLs

Well, the point that I was making, of

course, is that replevin is not limited to the case of a
seisure ©f merchandise, that it can be used to seise anything;
and in fact on© of*the parties
a case that was not

before the Court was involvedin

a consumer transaction.

It was a case

where a father, who had just been divorced from his wife, took
the child, one of the children, and then attempted to get all
the goods that the child was using in his wife's house.
Interestingly enough, ho was a deputy sheriff and
knew about replevin, end that's how he effectuated it.
I think, though, that even if we can assuraa that

>

well, in -» 1 think

if w© even focus on some of the other

named plaintiffs in

this case, even if we focus upon the case

17
of Mitchell Epps.

Now, he is not an appellant in this case,

bat of coarse his case is part of fell® record below.

We can

see hov/, in other instances, we're presented with the fact that
the replevin procedure in Pennsylvania is not narrowly drawn
in such a way to rarely protect creditor interests.
For instance, w© might have a different case if we
were -**Q

Well, are all but on© of these parties debtor^,

of the named plaintiffs?
1

'

MR. SCHOLL: Well, there are originally three-named
plaintiffs? two of them were debtors and the other one was
Mrs, Washington, who8a not a debtor.
Q

And the two debtors agreed that they were in

default?
MR. SCHOLL:

No.

There's .no —
J

Q

They agreed they weren't

behind in their

payments?
MR. SCHOLL: well, there was no agreement as to
Mitchell Epps regarding his default»

Perhaps 2 ought to ex plain

what happened in the Epps case, because I think it shows another
instance of how replevin procedure can be abused, ©van in the
debtor-creditor context.
Mitchell Epps had two separata accounts.

He had a

revolving account, on which he bought clothes and various other
things, and then he had son® time payment accounts.

Now, what

18
happened is that he foil behind on the revolving account.

Ha was paid up to date with his tints payment account.
So Government Employees Exchange, which won fch®
creditor concerned in his particular case, filed a writ of
replevin and cam© out and seised all. the things that he had
bought on fch© tins© payment account.

Now, there is some question ©a to whether they even
had a security interest in those goods •

liven assuming that

somewhere they could produce & contract which showed that
there was a security interest in goods purchased in fch© time
payment account, for violation.*} in the revolving account,
such a security interest would probably be invalid, because
we have a case right on point, decided in the District of
Columbia Circuit, which indicates that such a security interest
is unconscionable.

That's the case of Williams vs. Walker’--

Thomas Furniture CoBipaav.
So I think that this shows another of the possible
abuses to which the Pennsylvania replevin procedure, because
it is not narrowly drawn, is subject.

That is, that fch©

creditor can define what the security interest is, and what
he thinks the security interest extends to, before he goes out
and replevies the goods.
Q

Well, apparently in Pennsylvania, one of the

incidents of personal property is that it can foa seized by

anybody ©Is© if h© puts up twice the amount of the value sf

19
the property?
MR. SCHOLL;
Q

Yea", I would say it is.

And you say that’s unconstitutional for

Pennsylvania to treat personalty that wry?
MR. SCHOLLs

X think that it is.

.1 think that it

represents a violation of duo process of the citizens of
Pennsylvania, particularly those citizens who’ve been subject
to the seizure of the property without any notice or opportunity
to be heard.
Now, what the court below constantly speaks of is
only the Parham fact situation, and the court talks about how
default is not denied here.

Well, there’s no question that

fch® Parhams ware behind in the payments on their contract.
But, they were making soma payments,

in fact, they had made a

$25 payment in August of .1970? they made a $20 payment in the •
beginning of September 1970; and then a week later Sears,
...

*

Roebuck, who had. accepted the $20 payment, cam© out and
replevied the goods.
By this time they had paid off, I believe, approxi­
mately $200 of the $384 debt that
they originally had.
s

Nov;,

I think that the Parhams„p;’hads 'they had an opportunity to get
into court and raise any defenses that they might have had,
might have been able to establish that in fact Sears, Roebuck
had agreed to accept the $20 payment a month as a payout
schedule, because the only reason that Mr. Parham wasn’t able

20
to 3c©ap up hi© original schedule was because ho lest his job.
So this is the kind of thing, also, that the replevin
procedure is subject to.

Mr. Parham never having an opportunity '

to go to court.
Q

Bo 1 understand you, that whore there’s a note,

without all these provisions in it, that:.• it’s a good defense
to say you can't afford t© pay?
MR. SCHOLL.1
Q

No, what I sia suggesting —

Because you are unemployed?

Is that a good

defense?
*

MR. SCHOLL §

That is not what I meant to suggest.,

Mr. Justice Marshall, and perhaps X ought to explain that.
Q

Well, you said he paid, and the fact that fchoy

accepted less than the payment did something to Sears, Roebuck.
What did that do to Sears, Roebuck?
MR. SCHOLLs
Q

I'm saying that it may have.

Estopped them or something?

MR. scholls

it may have represented that they

accepted a lesser payment schedule from the Parhams, in light
of the fact that they were not working —
Q

Can you give me anything in any lawbook that

comes close to that?
MR. SCHOLL:
Q

Well, X can't cite a particular case —

That' if you agreed to pay $25 a month and you

pay 20, that you're excuse from the five, because the man

21
accepted the 20?
MR, SCHOLLi Well, I think if the man accepts the 20
and doesn't say. anything about it, there's at least an
argument that can be mada,

Q

Yes, that he doesn't owe the five?

MR. SCHOLLs

Not that he doesn’t owe the five, but

that, in fact, the creditor should, desist from taking the
property, as long as the consumer is willing to work out —
Q

No; no, I assume you mean that ha doesn't ©we

the five.
MR, SCROLLs

I don’t, think it could possibly b©

assarted that they didn't ©w© the balance.

And I didn’t mean

to assert that.
Now, in addition to the claim that the due process
rights of the consumers were violated, there is also a

j
t

claim mad© by the consumers in this Court, and it was also made
below, that the Fourth Amendment rights of tea consumers wore
also violated.

Because what ia effect is permitted hare is

an entry into the home of the consumers, and the taking of
their goods without their being any assertion on the part of
fell© creditor that h© has probable cause to enter the hem© and
to seise the particular goods.
Now, feh© court below gets out of. any discussion of
the Fourth Amendment in a very easy manner, they simply say
that the Fourth Amendment doesn’t apply to civil cases, and

22
'this is a civil case? therefora no Fourth Amsmdmant.„
Well, I

don’t

think that that

follows

th© teachings

of this Court as to what the natur® of th© Fourth Amandmcmt is.
the nature of the fourth Amendment is to protect person’s
rights of privacy to their hose.

It's to prevent seizure or

searches of th® hern© find entry into th© homo by State officials
in any instance, whether the official is executing criminal
process, ©r whether he is, as in this easo, executing on
civil process.
Now, 2 think that there ar© several cases that point
to this result.

First of all» the Camara case, th© Sea ©as®,

even this Court's decision in Wymnn vs. Jages, although in that
case it was found that there was no ©©arch and a© seizure,
that case reiterated the holding of th® Camara and the See caster
that in fact the Fourth Amendment is not limited to casco in
which there is a criminal matter that's before the court.,
And I think other cases that support this notion is
the Griswold case, which th© Fourth Amendment was on® of the
ground© given for that decision, and also the Biysng case,
in which ife was permitted, the plaintiff was permitted to
bring m action, civil action, based on the Fourth Amendment.
Nov?, positing that the Fourth Amendment does apply
to civil cases, 1 think it is fairly easy to see that in this
case there is no showing of probable cause before a magistrate
or any parson befor® th© seizure ©£ property is effected.

23
In fact# in Pennsylvania there is no procedure that

■,31V©?: goes before any neutral arbitrator.
Q

But haven’t the parties undertaken to substitute

agreement in advance for these processes?
MR. SCHOLLs

Well, I don’t -*• neither of the contracts

concejmed in this case really say anything about replevin.
Th@ only thing that the contracts — you see, this is putting
aside the Washington cas®, which of course is not a consumar
esse, and ©hows how the Fourth Amendment «— tha Fourth
Amendment invasion on Mrs. Washington, I don’t think that’s
at all relevant tc it.
But even assuming 'that Mrs. Washington is out of the
case for a minute, and we have just the consumers, w® hav® an
agreement that says that the creditor shall retain title to
th© instruments, ©ad the one contract says they may repossess
goods, the other says -they may retake goods.
Well, Title in itself, as th© Uniform Commercial Cod©
points out, merely rnaeas that th© creditor has a security
interest in th© goods,

so to say they have © security interest

and title is probably redundant.
Now, in the «—

But it says you may retake the merchandise,

MR, SCHOLL$ Right,

That deas,

The quota is from th®

Eight*

HR, SCHOLLs
Q

They may retake the merchandise.

Yss,

MR* scroll?

It doesn't

stay, however,

that they

may

— that's the Epps contract, if I'm not mistaken.
Q

It is.

MR. SCHOLLs

That indicat®® — that does not -say that

they may replay the contract, and perhaps — or th© property,
and perhaps th® reasonable interpretation of the Epps contract
is to be interpreted the same way

as the Sears, Roebuck

contract, which merely permits repossession.
Q

By th© creditor.

MR. SCHOLLS
Q

And repossession is not replevin.

Well, you mean that they — you could think that

they were coming there just by self-help and take it?
ME, SCHOLL3 Well, they could attempt to corns there
by self-help, because there's a distinction between repossession
and replevin? is that if Mrs. Washington or Mrs. Parham said
to Sears, Roebuck, or to Mr, Washington, '“You cannot entar my
house? I'a not going to let you com® in to repossess th©
goods.®

Tii© repossession would have t© stop at that point.

And I think that's the important distinction.
Q

You think that’s a fair interpretation of that

language?
MR. SCHOLLs

I think that it is.

X think that's

25
indigenous to retake.
Q

lt9s thera interpretation that Mr. Epps could

stop them from repossessing it?
MS. SCHOLL:

I think a fair interpretation is that

ail retaking is repossession.
Q

Even though h© agrees that they could repossess.

He agreed that they could repossess it, bat you say he could
interpret that agreement that they could repossess it as
giving him the right to stop them from repossessing it?
MR. SCHOLL: Well, that's the definition ©£
repossession.

Repossession has to bo a peaceable taking.

So the minute that Mr. Epps or Mrs. Parham would attempt to
stop Sears from retaking the goods, they would have t© stop
it.

All repossessions, ofcourse, are not nonconsential.

repossession can b© consential.

A

The Parhams may have

decided in fact they couldn't keep up the payments and they
would just as soon have Sears take it back.
Q

Well, I'd assume that's what they meant by

sining that contract.

That any time th© man wanted to

repossess it, he was free to take it.
1 would think that’s what the language says,
MR. SCHOLL:
Q

I would not —

Without replevin.

MR. SCHOLL:

I would not interpret that contract as

permitting forcible seizure, merely because the moaning of

2e
repossession -Q

Welif I didn’t 3©y forcible.

X said X would

interpret that contract to say that if at any time the creditor
wants to repossess it* ha has the right to repossess it.
MR. SCHOLL: Wall, t would agree with Your Honor.
Q

But «•

Well, how doss he have a right if you can stop

it?
MR. SCHOLL:
Q

Well, by definition —

That*® a right without a remedy, I guess.

Yes, I guess that*® what it is.
MR. SCHOLL:

r

Q

Well, it —

He has an abstract right, I ass.

MR. SCHOLL: - Yes, I don't think that Mr. Parham can
be held to any interpretation of repossession other than what
it means in the lav? ordinarily, which is & peaceable taking.
And I don’t see how Mr. Parham, especially — Mr. Parham of
course is not the person that drafted the contract — could
possibly be held to such an interpretation that it would permit
replevin.
Also with respect to the Fourth Amendment, of course,
the agreement is merely between Sears, Roebuck and Mrs. Parham;
it doesn't permit the sheriff to com® in and take ths goods, and
that's the person that takes the goods in this case.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT F. MAXWELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR.MAXWELL?

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please the

Courts
I represent solely Sears, Roebuck in this matter as
an appellee, and — but X do think I should mention one or
two tiling© where I feel there has been son® misunderstanding.
Much is mad© of the Washington case, and the impropriety of
the repossession there, that there was no right to immediate
possession or title.
There was a hearing held in this case by th® lower
court, where Mr. Washington himself was summoned, and s© was
the plaintiff, Mrs. Washington.

Mrs. Washington did not appear,

nor did her attorneys, and the court, after hearing testimony
of Mr. Washington, vacated th© injunction it had previously
issued, and th® order tic return the goods, saying on page 29 of
the record: "St now appears to the court that the representa­
tions upon which the temporary restraining order of September
8th issue were incorrect, both as to allegations contained in
the complaint and representations made by counsel.
"Accordingly we will both vacato the order of
September S —* 18th".
Thus there is a finding in the lower court on the

20
merit* of this controversy, which has navsr been controvtrfced.
Secondlyf I would like to call to the Court's
attention that whil© no ccmplaint is filed in Pennsylvania
replevin procedure, feh© bond itself, signed by the person
making the replevin, and signed by s surety which ranot he an
approved surety by th© court, which is decided by the j ?; less
themselvos not th® prothonotary, there must be a corporate
surety in twice th® amount of the goods, but this bond says
specifically that it — that the plaintiff claims the right
to immediate possession of the goods, and that if ho dc«a not
sustain this, in an action — in th© action, than h® is liable
to the defendant, th© value of th© property, all legal costs,
fees, and damages sustained by reason of the issuance of th©
said writ*
Not?, X would further call to Your Honors * attention
that this procedure is before

that at th© first instance,

be for© a prothonotary of th© court, and his deputy clerks of
the Common Pleas Court.

The fact that a complaint is not filed

at th© beginning is taken car® of, in my opinion, by this
bond where the man binds himself the r@plavin.ing party ana
v
his surety, and say® he has a right, to immediate possession.
But, 'moro than that, the rules are repleto, as is the original
J\cfe of 1705 in Pennsylvania, with immediate action that the
defendant can tali® fco turn away th® writ, th© effect ©f -the
writ

29

True# h© am file © ©aunt^r-boRcl within 79 hours.
If h© does so, them he immediately gets the property heal, but,
as Justice Marshall has indicated, this &:m not
backhand*-forth bond, it requiras, as the: rulei

in a

sjiya, thit '111

actions of this nature shall follow the rules of aasumynit :1a.

Pe&nsyIvanla.
Yher© must be a filing of a complaint immediately at
this time by the plaintiff, there is a right to ssxmtsx,
then it cessas before the court either or. a jury trial or by
mutual waiver of jury trial*
New, second, there is also an immediata right undor
the rules to nov® to adjust the bond, to cancel the bond, to
take over the prothonotary

to say that they can move tu®

court immediately, go immediately into a judge to xaov© th»vfej
the prothonotary's action in issuing this bond is improper^
-A

and to limit the bond, to discharge the bond, et cafcara, ;
So there is really an actual ~~ let’s see, this is
©n© of the rules hare, which are attached# and says specifically
that the tend can be adjusted, and that there can be — it
can b© 'thrown out, in fact, by the court.
*

Now, “**
q

But tills, I gather, is after the possession of

tii@ goods has been taken by the sheriff?

MR. M2&HELL: That’s right? yes, sir.
in other words

;ir-

Q

raid if the result is to dischcrga th© bend, then

what happens?
MR. MAXWELL?

Then, if tii® be.

-’charged, th

goods would immediately revert tp "the defendant, and fch© court
would either enter a final order at that point, or would settle
— sat it; down for ©. future trial.
Q

And adjusting the bond means adjusting the amoiv-.t

that —
MR, MAXWELLS

It would ba adjusting, c

:.~h ;

-itt

cancel the bend, say the bond has-been improvidantly ieentei,
the rule says,
Now, in addition to this situation, a replevin■
action in Pennsylvania is nover dead until a complaint hoe
been filed, served upon the defendant, and judgment entered
either by default after 20 days, or after hearing before the
court,

had there are provisions in the rule stating that

fch© court has the right to givs damages on either aid©,
substantial damages.

It can hear feh© entire case, either

before a judge or before m jury.
Now, l submit that under these facts, that there
has been compliance with constitutional rulings of this
Court throughout its previous history.

I think it has bean

indicated in this Court that a parky, first taking advantage
of a statute, cannot be sought to »

seen to com® in and to

attack th@ .constitutionality of the statute.

And this was in

*n **

J,

the very ««so of Fahey, which Mr. Justice Douglas referr&d fco
as an ©xcart-ion- in. the Siaiadach ease.
' *•'

«oe=r Jf *\"V vw a»w "»

th® Ctourft

finally s&idU ©pd X think hhct

opinio», also wa& —- no* that; was by Mir,.Justice Jackson?

that if yoia taka advantage of a statute, yon cannot attack
1
its constitutionality T
. . .
Now, these people, in gaining thas© goods, &h©
possession (and title of this goods depends on the ©cBtoaasrcin.l
code; and the Goods, sad Sales Act of PenneyIvani.a,
Sheas© forma, the way the form reads, tbs amount of
the — the height of-the type, everything ia provided by thus©
lewss. S'feey got possession of this. goods by ..means of rsws^liano:^
with this Act, but they s-ay that the punitive effect of this
Act, the collecting, of. money for it, or reviewing the
goods, that should he stricken down because! it is unconstitu­
tional t
j.n this action replevin is merely a procedural
rsmsdy to «©force the rights of the creditor given by the
Commercial Cod©., th® right, to self-help, plus the right to
replevy by court action if this is @e de&irad?
And this is how the plaintiff's rights in this case
arose in this propertyf by this very Commercial Cod®, and
certainly you canjiot today just strike down the replevin action,
it would seem to me you would have to «trike down the security
provisions of th® Uniform Commercial Code, which is effective

fa

“ie-.-.:, y;/;r,
m act L< m

>■ ■ eoilev: ax replevin has been proceeded

with in this case.
How, X think the only ©thar thing that this Court
has said over its past history, again in -certain sscccption© hr;
the Sniadach doctrine, that is language that was usod in the
Snl&dacfa doctrine, has indicated that in personal proparty, i£
there is sufficient availability ©f immediate or sishaeqtrxnfc
remedies, sufficiently protecting the party against what a
replevin or action is had, where the property is tabsn ire-.:
him, that this satisfies dus process.
Now, in the specific cases before us, spiking of
the Fourth Amendment, there is certainly —- 1 eta aea no
violation of the Fourth Amendment her®. .'-’There was a peacsabl©
taking certainly in our case, and in all other cases.

And 2

do net see -- again it was by agreement, the right in the
property ©f those plaintiffs passed to them by virtue of the
Uniform Commercial Cod©, by provisions of the; Uniform Commercial
Code, which i@, as X say, in effect in 49 States, and-then it
is said that because it; passed this way, ike other part of the
Uniform Commercial Code, which not only gives rights to these
plaintiffs but gives defects, that this part of the Cod© should

h(B stricken down.
And 1 think —

33

Q

What.5a that holdout State on the Code?

MR.MAXWELL:
Q

pardon?

What is the- holdout State, 'you said only 49 ~~

MR. MAXWELL:

I beliav®, sir, as I understand it,

it .is Louisiana, because of. the French lav.

1 belief© that is

it.
So 1 think that is raally — really I have just in
this cases, really, solely moved for a dismissal on the ground
of the specific case.
:

In our specific case wa gave prior

c

''

notice, four or five prior notices, which are a part of the
record, that w© were going to repossess, that there was default,
and after that we finally did repossess.
And, m X say, this replevin action, as any other
replevin action, is still open. Th© State courts are open to
th©a© people.

In ©very one of these cases they could have

gone to the State court, and a Common Flees judge sitting in
City Hall in Philadelphia would have given an Immediate order,
if they had rights on which they cen.depend, or which they
can ~~ which exist*
I thank you.

Q

Mr. Maxwell, in this case as in an earlier

case today v;© have the Attorney General of the State of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, instead of seeking to uphold
the constitutionality of the legislation passed in his
Commonwealth, respectfully praying that the judgment of the

court b«al®w h® rovorsed, end that thia C mrt renter a judgmorvt
declaring th® Pennsylvania stettrts vnconstitutional on thadr

What's th® history of that?
