MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments next

in 7Q™69, United States against Orito.
Mr. Greenawalt, you xftay proceed whenever you’re ready,.
now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. KENT GREENAWALT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT.
MR. GREENAWALT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This case is on direct appeal from the District Court
for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.
The court dismissed an indictment charging that
appellee had transported 82 reels of obscene film interstate
by means of a common carrier.

The court held that the relevant

statutory provision, 18 U.S.C. 1462, is, on its face,
constitutionally invalid, because it is overbroad in forbidding
the use of common carriers for the non-public transportation,
of obscene materialsT”'
The government appealed directly to this Court
pursuant to the old Criminal Appeals Act.

Like Reidel, 37

Photographs, and the case just argued, this case arises from
an expansive interpretation of Stanley vs. Georgia by district
courts.
The precise issue in this case is the constitutionality
of the statute that prohibits the known use of a common

carrier for tee interstate trs'asportation of obscenfe materials.
We believe that Relde.l and 3? Photographs have
effectively settled the issues raised here.

Indeed, the judge who

decided this case has subsequently sustained the constitutionality
of this section, after those cases were handed down.

That is

not cited in our brief, and the citation for that case is
?

United States vs. Saccer, 332 P. Sup. 833.
Q

833?

MR. GREENAWALT:

833, yes, Your Honor.

In trying to evade the clear import of Reidel and 37
Photographs, appellee makes two different arguments;

One is

that even when transportation is for the purpose of sale,
Congress cannot prohibit the use of common, carriers to transport
obscene materials interstate.
The second argument assumes that commercial trans­
portation may be forbidden, but contends that the statute is
invalid as it applies to non-commercial transportation, and
that this impermissible overbreadth renders the entire section
invalid on its face.
It is the government’s position that the statute is
constitutional in both its commercial and non-commercial
applications.

If, however, it is considered unconstitutional

in sore or all non-commercial applications, it is our position
that the statute should not be declared invalid on its face,
but limited to its permissible application.

5
I turn first to the argument that even transportation
for sale is constitutionally protected.

In Reidol this Court

refused to recognise the constitutional right to distribute
or sell obscene materials, and reiterated the principle of Both
that obscenity and its distribution are outside the reach of
the First Amendment.
In 37 Photographs, six Justices squarely held that
importation of obscenity for commercial distribution is not
constitutionally protected.

Appellee concedes that the First

Amendment would not protect a commercial distributor of obscene
material, whose wish is to import such materials or send them
through the mails.

But he argues that the same commercial

distributor, who wishes to transport materials in interstate
commerce, is constitutionally protected.
Congress’s plenary power to prohibit

noxious

materials from flowing in interstate commerce has long been a
cornerstone of this Court's interpretation of the commerce
clause.
In Givens vs. Ogden, the Court said that Congress's
power over commerce among the States is vested, quote, "As
absolutely as it would be in a single government."
And in the lottery case, as well as many others,
it has- sustained absolute prohibitions against items of commerce
judged harmful,
In Hoke vs. United States, which is cited in our brief,

s
where the Court sustained the White Slave Traffic Act, the
Court assumed the constitutionality of these provisions and
used those as the precise to reach the result in that case.
Congress’s powers over commerce are of course
limited by the First Amendment.

But the First Amendment is

also relevant to what Congress can preclude from the mails or
forbids from being imported.
Appellee cites a number of cases for the proposition
that the government has special powers over mail because it
operates the postal system.

But in this First Amendment context,

at least, these cases have no authority after Blount vs, Riwi
and Lament vs. Postmaster General,
The government can no more exclude protected materials
from the mail on the basis of their content than it can exclude
them from commerce.

And, conversely, if commercial distribu­

tion of obscenity through the mails can be prohibited, so also
can any sort of transportation in interstate commerce for
commercial purposes.
Assuming that Congress may validly prohibit the mof common carriers traveling interstate for the commercial
distribution of obscene materials, the order of the district
court in this case should be reversed, either if transportation
for personal use may also foe prohibited, or if invalidity as
to transportation for personal use does not require striking
down the entire section

7
We believe the statute is constitutional in its non­
commercial as well as its commercial application.

But I consider

the overbreadth point first», because we believe it's fully
supported by 37 Photographs.
First, I'd like to clear up what seems to be an issue
from appellee's brief, but is not really an issue.
We do contend that it is inappropriate to hold the
section invalid on its face, but we do not contend that appellee
lacks standing to make that claim.
Appelle does have standing to make the claim that
invalidity in some applications renders this section invalid
for all applications, whether or not he is a commercial disfcr :*..ou
tor.
If, on the other hand,as we contend, invalidity in
some applications would not reader the statute invalid as tc
all applications, then the district court could determine in
subsequent proceedings in this case the purpose of the trans­
portat ion here.
In neither event is this Court required to determine
appellee's purpose from this record. So that really is not in
issue at this point in th© case.
In 37 Photographs, the same siss Justices who held
that importation for commercial purposes can be prohibited also
held that the district court in that case was wrong to strike
down the entire section in its application to commercial importa-

8
tion, because importation for personal use might be
constitutionally protected,
Mr. Justice White’s majority and plurality opinion
said, quote, ’"She proper approach was not to invalidate the
section in its entirety but to construe it narrowly and hold it
valid in its application to lav/."
And Justices Harlan and Stewart concurred on the same
ground.
As these opinions indicate, a holding of facial
invalidity for overbreadth is not appropriate when a statute
can be clearly narrowed to constititutional applications in a
way that will eliminate virtually all of the possible chilling
effect on effective communication.
Q

In this case, Mr. Grennawa.lt, all we have as far

as the facts go is the indictment which appears 021 pages 1 and
2 of the Appendix? is that right?

MR. GREEKAWALT:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

There is no affidavit or anything?

MR. GREEMAWALTs As to the nature of these materials?
Q

Exactly.

Or as to the -- not only as to the

nataro of the materials, but as to the purpose of the defendant8
tr ansportation?
MR. GREENAWALTj That is correct.
q

We have the indictment and then a motion to dis

miss, and that’s it?

9
MR. GRBENAWALTs

That is right* yes.

As far as the overbreadth point is concerned, the
language of Section 1462 involved in this case is virtually
indistinguishable from the language of Section 1305(a) involved
in 37 Photographs.
Section 1462 involved here forbids the use of common
carriers to transport obscenity interstate without respect to
purpose, just as Section 1305(a) had provided forfeiture for
importation of obscene materials, without respect to purpose.
Section 1462 dates back to 1897, and it is the primary
prohibition against interstate transport of obscene materials
in the federal law.
It is clear that Congress would prefer this section
\

to stand in its valid applications rather than ba declared
invalid on its face.
And this case dees not involve the kind of inter­
related set. of administrative provisions, such as were present
in Blount vs. Rlaal* and Freedman vs» Maryland.

In those kinds

of cases the Court declined to rewrite an administrative setup
as to find certain provisions constitutionally invalid.
But here w® have a straightforward criminal statute
that can be validly applied in certain applications, and plainly
the lower 'court erred in striking down the entire section on
its face.
We believe the court also erred in quite a different

respect, by deciding that interstate transportation of obscenity
for personal use could not constitutionally be proscribed»
We now get back to the territory that*s been covered
in the previous argument., to some extent*
Role!cl arid 37 Photographs made clear, as had Roth,
that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment.

And

congressional power to decide what goods may cross State lines
extends to this unprotected material.
What the plurality said in 37 Photographs with respect
to foreign commerce, a passage that the Solicitor General read
to you in his argument, "Obscene materials may be removed from
the channels of commerce even though intended solely for
private use4’ is equally true of interstate commerce.
The majority opinion in Stanley vs. Georgia, indicator
that the government may not invade a person’s home to asce'rtrc a
if he possesses forbidden material.
Q

1 take it what you’re saying there, that if Mr.

Stanley# for example, wanted to give the material involved in
the Stanley case to someone else, he would be violating the
statute if he sent it through the mails, but could he get in
his car and drive from wherever he lived to some other place
and deliver it to a friend as a gift?
MR. GRSEHAWALTs

Our position would be, as a matter

of constitutional law, that that could be forbidden.

This

section covers only transportation by common carrier, and 1465

11
would be the relevant federal section for that,

1 think that

includes transportation for sale or distribution.
■ Yes.

Now, then., X suppose you'd have a nice

statutory question as to whether, if you give a book to a friend,
that's distribution or not uixsiin the terms of the statute.
But —
Q

The context of that statute would indicate that

it was intended for — to deal with the commercial distribution,
isn't it?
MR. GREENAWALT; That is clear, Your Honor, that that
was the purpose of the statute, and certainly there would be a
strong statutory argument that that would- not be distribution
within the meaning of the statute.
Q

How about a gift to the Library of Congront

MR, GREENAWALTs

Well, for somebody who didn’t

start in the District of Columbia, — well, I would think tlv -'
is not distribution.

It is our position that if it is obscre

material and someone used a common carrier to give the materiel
to the Library of Congress, then unless you read in thestatutory exception for that kind of thing, that that could
constitutionally be covered*
Q

What about in Texarkana, if they handed ths book

across the middle of the street?

You know, in Texarkana,

Arkansas and Texas come down the middle of the main street,
does it not?

12
MR. GREENAWALT:

Yes.

Yes.

We would say that constitutionally could be covered.
For similar reasons that we think that if there was a
town that — which there may be — in which Canada and the
United States would split the border, we think that that could
be covered as well.
Q

Yes, the bridges.

MR. GREENAWALT: Right.
Q

Mr. Greenawalt, earlier in your argument you

gave us a citation, 332 F. Sup. 833, as I got it at least, and
I sent for that, and it's not the correct citation.

Over the

lunch period, could you check that?
Q

Here it is.

Q

Maybe I got the' wrong —

MR. GREENAWALT: Did you find it, Mr. Justice
Douglas?
Q

Just over the lunch period, if you could.

MR. GREENAWALT:

Yes, certainly.

Well, it is our contention that Stanley vs. Georgia
does
Q

No, it's not the right citation.

MR. GREENAWALT:

Oh, I’m sorry.

1 will check that.

— does not require the government to stand aside
while the channels of commerce

are employed by individual a

who are interested in constitutionally unprotected material.

13
Moreover, the government does have a special interest■
in the use of common carriers, which are open to the general
public, and closely regulated in the public interest»

If persons choose to use such carriers, they must do
so in ways not deemed inconsistent with the public interests.
Practically, there are substantial reasons for
•; lowing 1

government to forbid the use of common; carrie-

to transport obscenity, irrespective of purported purpose.
The reasons that we do not believe were applicable in Stanley.
Each State-'. Legislature has the power to set its own
policy with respect to the sale and purchase of -obscene
materials.

One State may forbid the sale'

of all constitution­

ally unprotected material? another may permit their sale, as
Oregon has chosen to do.

If the Federal Government is powerless to atop
transportation across State lines —*

AFTERNOON S2SSION
?1:0G p.ra.]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Greenawalt, you may

continue.
MR. GREENAWALT:

Mr. Chief Justicee and may it please

the Court s
I had mistranscribed one of the page numbers, and
it's 332 P. Sjap. 883.
Q

Thank you.

MR. GREENAWALT:

Instead of 833, as I had said before,

I was in the middle of the argument that this statute
is constitutional as it reaches non-coramercial transportation,
and I had made the basic argument that the material is
unprotected and therefore Congress can prohibit its passage
in interstate commerce.

And I turn to some of the practical

reasons that support that conclusion.
1 had mentioned that State Legislatures may forbid:
constitutionally unprotected material from being sole, hxxt
that other States may permit their sale, such as Oregon ha-.
chosen to do.

And that .if the Federal Government is power loss

to stop transportation across State lines, citizens of a State
that forbids the purchase of pornography Can circumvent the
1

/

policy of that State by buying the material in a more permissive
jurisdiction and bringing it back to their own State.
More significant, perhaps, in terms of actual impact

on prosecution is the fact that if only commercial transporta­
tion. may be stopped , it may sometimes be difficult to prove a
commercial motive, although that is the real reason for the
transportation.

And 1 remind you of the Solicitor Generalea

argument about the difficulties of drawing that particular line.
Also in this situation, a holding of constitutional
protection of private transportation would cast in jeopardy
scores of convictions under 1462, where transportation was in
fact for commercial purposes, but in which the jury determina­
tion of guilt, of- course, did not require a finding to that
effect.
Finally, there is the danger that materials taken by
• common carriers will be seen by other members of the public,
who may be offended.
Q ,

This is —- going back to your last point, you

say there have been scores of convictions under this statute?
MR. GREENAWALT:

I am informed that there are

approximately 25 prosecutions a year under 1462, something
in that range.
Q

And we would be. concerned here, of course, with

people that are still -.serving sentences, I suppose?
we not --

.

Or are

'

MR, GREENAWALT2

Yes, on those problems about

collateral attack of people.
Q

We’re not talking about convictions of thirty

years ago?
ME, GREEWAWALTs

No, except that the Court’s rules

bow about mootness arc rather liberal toward people that have

been convicted of crimes, and their ability to challenge crimes
that may have adverse effects.in some future proceedings.
Q

Collateral challenges?

MR. GREENAWALTs
prison.

Yes.

Even though they're out of

Yes.
Q

You don't know how many — I suppose the typical

prison sentence would be, like — what is the maximum, five
years?
MR. GREENAWALT: For first offenders? there's a
maximum of ten years for second offenders.

But I would guess

that, as I think you're suggesting, that the usual sentence is
not terribly long.
Q

I was just wondering about the practical impact

of the argument you just made.
MR. GREENAWALT:

Yes.

1 don’t know what the average

sentence is, or how many people are still in jail.
The wisdom of trying to stop the transportation for
private us© may be arguable, and in fact the government does
not. prosecute those whom it believes are. transporting for
personal use.
But it is our contention that there is no constitu­
tional bar to such prosecution

17
Because Section 1462 is patently constitutional as to
the use of common carriers to transport obscenity for sale, and
both because its coverage of transportation for personal use is
also constitutional, and because the proper approach, if the
section is unconstitutional in some applications, is tc limit
the section rather than to ,invalidafee it on its face, the
order of the district court in this case should be reversed,
and the indictment should be reinstated.
I*d like to reserve the remainder of my time x:or
rebuttal.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs Very well, Mr. Greenawalt.
Mr. Shallow.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. SHELLOW, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. SEELLOWt

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courtsi
My friend misconceives the thrust of our argument.
We do not seek any derivative rights under Stanley.

We do net

seek any correlative rights under Stanley.
The appellee in this case is charged with the .private
possessory transportation of obscene material.

We assert that

if Stanley holds any meaning, it says that cas cannot be

;n>ecute« for the private possession of obscene material ?
and.that's precisely what’s charged in this case.

Tha private possession of obscene material, and the
First and First and ninth Amendment underpinnings of Stanley
protect the man who is carrying the obscene or pornographic
book, which he is reading, on an airplane, just as it would
protect him if he were reading it in his homey provided that
he doesn’t read it in such a way that he exposes it to persons
who don't want to see it, or who would be offended by it,,
Q

Let me see if 1 follow you.

Suppose, instead

of a book, it was pictures, and he had a suitcase full of them
on the airplane, it's private possession,;. I suppose, in one
sense; would you say that's protected, if it's —
MR. SHELLOWj
Q

Yes.

— 500 of those pictures?

MR. SHELLOWi

Yes.

If he had 500 pictures in his

luggage on an airplane
Q

All the same .picture.

MR. SHELLOWs

Well, the only — 1 submit that the

only inference that can be drawn from 500 pictures, all the
same, is that he's' threatening to go into the business and
do something with these pictures.

And if this Court wishes to

draw the line and say that 1462 applies only to commercial
transportation, then I should think it would be a fairly
easy matter of proof, that in fact this was a commercial
venture»
If, however, he has one picture, or ten pictures,

19
and he has them in his pocket,on the airplane, that he's pro­
tected ,

If he has one picture or ten. pictures in his luggage,

on the airplane, I submit this is protected under the direct
holding of Stanley.
Stanley doesn’t have to be extended.

Stanley was not

actually viewing obscene film at the time the officers arrived
with the search warrant.

Stanley was merely possessing them,

with the intent to, at some future date, view them»
Just as the man on the airplane, whether in his pocket or
in his luggage, is possessing the material with, an intent, at
some future time, to privately enjoy his collection of
erotica.
Similarly, it's no extension of Stanley to protect
the possession in his suitcase on the airplane»

He*s on the

airplane, the suitcase is on the airplane; this is as protected
as it would be if it were in Stanley’s house or in the
traveler8 s pocket»
As we move to more attenuated examples, I think
till confers direct'protection.

The man who moves

from a residence in California to a residence in Wisconsin, and
ships, by cbrhnicn carrier, his collection of pornography.

Where

he is the shipper and the consignee, he's protected, the shipment
is protected,

This is a private use in a private setting.

It’s as protected as if he stayed in his residence in California.
And the man who takes the magazine to his hunting

so
lodge in another State by common carrier.
Each of these are examples of private possessory
transportation.

The key is the possession. There's no distribu­

tion of it.
And we submit that that's precisely the interdiction
of 1462.

1462 permits such persons to be prosecuted,, and flies

directly in the mandate o£ Stanley.
We assert that, to the extent that Stanley or some
of the opinions in Stanley would -- well, there’s only two
opinions in Stanley — would have founded Stanley’s right on a
Fourth Amendment claim, as my friend has asserted that it might
be.

To that extent, our interstate traveler is protected as

well.
In Kata, this Court said that the Fourth Amendment
protects people not places.

In Mancum, this Court said that

the Fourth Amendment protects places where the individual has
a reasonable expectation that it will be free, from governmental
intrusion.
We submit that each of these considerations apply
to the man who has the pornographic picture in his pocket,
the film in his luggage, as he travels from one State to
another,

MR. SHELIOW!

Q

]

■

Would it be fair to say that the position you’re

21
now taking is inconsistent.with the language earlier mentioned
by Justice Marshall in the prior can© from the plurality opinion

in the 37 Photographs case?
MR. SHELLOW:

I don't think so,

I think 37 Photo-

graph3, not only as pure private possessory transportation, but
?

as a case in which Mr. Luros asked the affirmative assistance
of the governmentir in bringing this material into the country,

c
And perhaps the distinction can be' drawn between he who imports
;

privately and seeks to have some government customs agent
authorise his importation;, and the man who seeks nothing from
the government and merely seeks to go to his hunting lodge
in Utah.
That is how I would distinguish it, and that is how
I believe that it doesn't conflict with 37 Photo*
the plurality opinion.
We then corns to the question:

Can this Court, narrowly

construe Section 1462 so that the statute and the ambit of
the statute applies only to commercial, to the distributive
process.

And I'm not certain whether the Court would approach

it from the point of view of the commercial aspect or the
distributive aspect.
Certainly one wouldn't be prosecuted who brought,
in his luggage from Milwauke to Washington , the exhibits
form the basis of his argument.
within the ambit of 1462 as well.

And yet that is, of course,

.

.

I thin)

as to whether or not

this Court can construe the statute narrowly, to exclude
private possessory transportation.
statute.

That’s the words of the

The words of the statute clearly do not have any

reference to commercial or distributive functions, unlike
Section 1465.
We look to the words of the statute, and we remember
?

the recent words of Mr. Justice Stewart in Campo-Sorono„ in
which he stated the principle of strict construction of
criminal statutes demands that some determinative limit be
established, based upon the actual words of the statute.
And there are no determinative limits that can be placed upon
the actual words of this statute.
This statute would not require construction, it would,
require rewriting.
What this Court would be doing would be adding an
additional element to the offense, which was enacted by
Congress, in Section 1462 of Title 18.
The distinctions, of course, between what the
appellee asserts you cannot do in this case, and you did do in
37 Photographs, are that, No. 1, 37 Photographs is not a
criminal proceeding, it's a civil forfeiture proceeding.
Secondly, you don’t have the same kind of severability
clause to work with.

The severability clause which applies to''

Title 19 permits the Court to sever out unconstitutional

applications»

The severability clause, which is.appended to

Title 18» as we recite in oar yellow brief* does not permit the
severing out of unconstitutional applications.

It's a different

kind of severability.
Perhaps more important is a matter that we touched on
tangentially in our brief* and now I would like to elaborate on
in more detail.
The Court will recall that in its opinion in Blount
vs. Risasi * the issue was raised as to whether or not the
legislation there could not be saved by a construction which
would provide for judicial review.

And this Court noted that

that was what the Postmaster sought* he sought to avoid
precisely that.
And so the Court wasn’t free to impose a constitutional
meaning on the section there involved.
In this case* this isn't a case in which Congress
in Section 1462 never considered the commercial applications
of it,

When this statute was first enacted in 1897* the final

clause* which prohibits one who takes from a common carrier
obscene material* was limited to commercial distribution and
it was in that statute that it said whoever takes from a common
carrier with the intent to sell, distribute* or circulate.
That was the way the Act was in 18-97; that was the way it was
reenacted in 190S«

And when it went into the 1907* 1908* 1909

general revision of the penal laws, the Joint Committeef the

24
Joint Committee of the Senate and House, which reported it
out, reported it out changed from the earlier statute in two
material respects.
The first respect, the committee added to the first
clause, the importation clause, that it must be for the purpose
of disposing of the material, that importation would not be
unlawful unless it was for the purpose of disposing? and
retained in the final clause this "with intent to sell,
distribute# or circulate”.
When it cam© to the Floor and was reported out on the
Floor of the House# Congressman Houston amended the Senate
proposal# the Joint proposal, by striking both of those
provisions..

And 1462, for practical purposes# appears now,

at least as far as this aspect is concerned, as it was
amended by Congressman Houston of Tennessee.
Thus Congress on at least three occasions, and rrobabl
four, if you consider the predecessor bill that was passed by
the Senate and not by the House, on

four occasions has address-"

itself to whether the statute should be limited to commercial
activity.
And on at least four occasions

three occasions,

they said1 no.
And so i think that in the face of that kind of
legislative history, we can’t distort the language of the
statute? we can't add an additional element to this offense.

25
We can't — we can'i

Lviduals for offenses which were

not enacted by the Congress*
The construction which would narrow 1462 to commercial
applications would pose all sorts of problems of proof*
As the Solicitor General pointed out in his previous
argument# and my friend pointed out in this argument# to
limit the construction would impose an unreasonable burden or
the government in how you go about proving that it was for
commercial purposes, and will the self-serving declarations of
defendants be sufficient to defeat a prosecution?
Further# should this Court then enact some sort c,£
presumption as•appears in 1465 to make proof easier?

1465# it

is of interest by its terras# would apply also to transportation
by common carriers,
The legislative history of 1465 suggest that it was to
fill the loophole a. .i to permit prosecution of privato carriers
but certainly nothing in the languageyof the statute is that
restrictive.
And so# would this Court then enact a presumption so
that if you had five or more copies of a magazine # or •
copies of one magasine and three of another, that this ia'
presumptive evidence of a commercial purpose?
Also# I submit that the stat

s which are

m

one State to another —
Q

Can you think of any statutes, Mr. Shallow, that

permit a jury to draw inferences of the kind that are involved
in drawing inferences about commercial purposes from the number
that were carried?
MR. SHELLOW:

Oh, certainly.

1 think that 1465, if

they don't have the requisite number to permit the instruction
on the presumption, then I think the jury can'be instructed:
"You may consider, although you do not need to, the number of
magazines possessed by this defendant.16
Q

Well, maybe I misunderstood you.

I thought you

were suggesting that it imposed an impossible or very
unrealistic burden to let a jury decide issues like that.
MR. SHELLOWs

It poses problems, I don't know — I

guess, perhaps that was a little strong.

But, for example,

in the Leary, the post--Leary cases, without the presumption
unlawful importation and knowledge thereof, the prosecutions
have been few and far between.

____ -

And I would submit that it's a difficult problem.
It’s not impossible.
Q

Mr. Shallow.

MR. SHELLOW:
Q

Yes, sir.

Your opposition referred to this recent case

by Judge Gordon.

I haven't read it.

on his changing his position?

Do you have any comment

27
MR, SHELLOW:

Yes,

First, it's an interesting case.

The indictment in Saccor is identical to the indictment in this
case.

That is, that both Sajccer and Orifco were charged with the

same transportation at the same time and the same place.

It

appeared they were both on the same airplane, and it's
difficult to determine in whose luggage it was.
That appears to be the case.
As far as Judge Gordon’s opinion is concerned,
Judge Gordon misses the thrust of our argument, and, to be
perfectly fair, this argument was never made to Judge Gordon,
this concept of possessory transportation.
necessary»

It wasn’t

St wasn’t necessary that it be elaborated in the

detail in which 1 present it to you.

Or it was not necessary

that ho thread his wav through Reidel and Luros* — Reidol and
37 Photographs.
I think that Judge Gordon misconceives the thrust or
our argument, although we did not argue that.

Ha misconceive 3

the thrust of it in that we are hot asking that this Court or
that court extend Stanley one iota.

Saccer and Crito were

engaged in a private possessory transportation.
Bud Stanley protects those who privately possess,
neither of them ware distributing, no inference of distributing
can be drawn.

Their activity is protected by the First and

ninth Amendments•
iks we'thread our way through Reidel and 37 Photo-

graphs, we note but do not rely upon the fact that those who
ship or carry on common carriers in interstate commerce obscene
material do not seal? the affirmative intervention of our
government for their enterprise, for their private enjoyment
of obscenity.
\
\

It may be that the government and this Court can hold
that if you wish to enjoy obscenity in the privacy of your home,
or the privacy of your railroad car, that's all right? but
don't ask us to hslp you with it.
That is, don't seek the affirmative assistance of
the government in permitting you to enjoy your sordid reading

habits.
I submit that, on that basis, some distinction can
be drawn between Raxdel, 3? Photographs, Gable vs. Jenkins,
which, in a sense, there the defendants — plaintiffs, I think,
in that case — there they sought to acquire derivative rights,,
They sought to tfficePStanley and say that because Stanley has
the right to read, we have the right to sell to him.

Because

has the right to possess, we have the right to deliver.
The Court made short shrift of that argument.

I

don’t think that the opinion, the one-sentence opinion in
Gable vs. Jenkins, poses any problems to us.

For we do not

seek any derivative benefit.
W© place ourselves squarely within Stanley.

We

claim that those who possess obscene material, as long as they

29
possess it in a way in which it is unlikely that it will be
exposed to unwilling adults, or exposed to children? c.r foisted
upon a member of the public, as long as they privately possess
it in an.area in which there is this reasonable expectation
of privacy, then they're protected.

They're protected by the

Ninth Amendment and by the First Amendment, and,to the extent
that SJbanXey_ is a Fourth Amendment question, by the Fourth
Amendment as well..
Q

Do you suggest that Stanley would have been

decided in the same way if Mr. Stanley had had 100 or 200 copies
of whatever it was that was involved there?
MR. SHJ3LL0W:

I submit that if Stanley had 100 or 200

copies , and he was prosecuted under the Georgia statute that

,

makes it unlawful to possession for purposes of sale, that the /
i

prosecution could hot have been blocked by the Stanley opinion. *
That is, the Stanley opinion does not extend to those
who possess for purposes of sale, any more than it extends tc:
thcee who possess for purposes of distribution.
Leaving aside for tbs moment the thorny question of
what would this Court do about private distribution, the issue
of "May I send ray obscene book by common carrier to the
Library of Congress”, "May I bring with me in my luggage the
obscene exhibits15 before 1 argue to this Court?
Leaving aside that thorny question, Stanley does not
reach the commercial distributor, Stanley does not reach the one

30
who has not yet engaged in his commercial distribution but is
possessing preparatory to such distribution.
So, I find that is no problem.
What I find as the basis problem here is that 1462
extends to purely private possessory transportation, and the
statute, from its legislative history, from the words that are
use, from the fact that it was amended at the same time that
1465 was enacted, Congress was perfectly aware of the problems
of private possessory transportation.

That the statute can’t

be construed such as to emasculate the clear congressional
intent that it was intended to apply to what this Court has
held to be protected.
j submit that when this statute, which the intent of
the framers clearly and unequivocally demonstrates that the
statute is intended to impose criminal sanction upon protected
conduct, then the statute cannot be permitted to stand.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Mr. Greena.wa.lt, you have a little time left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF R. KENT GREEMAWALT, ESQ,,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT .
MR. GREENAWA1T:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I have only a few very brief comments.
I don’t think this issue was raised by this case, but

X think that the — what may seam to be the troubles with
hypothetical is someone who carries in his pocket one obscene
book.
There is, I think, a question as to whether the
statute covers that person.

The language in the statute before

the 1955 provision, 1 believe, was "deposit with a common
carrier".

And the change in language was designed to extend the

venue provision, so that people could be prosecuted in the
j

jurisdictions which they traveled through as well as
that they put the materials on the carrier.

the place

L- - -

So 1•think there might be an argument that use o£
the common carrier doesn't cover that situation.

I don't say

that that's right.
Q

Wall, Mr. Greenawalt, what if he sends a box

of 25 or 100 books, all different, and all obscene?

Sealed and

sent by common, carrier to his country home.
>

MR. GREENAWALT:

That is, assuming that it's in

another State, the country home --Q

Sure, assume that.

MR. GREENAWALT:

— and that is clearly covered

by the statute, and we think the statute is constitutional in
that application.

We go back to our original argument on

that point.
And, as I — this possible distinction X*m suggesting,
we don't suggest is of constitutional vengeance.

32
Q

Well, suppose the owner,, the sole owner of the

motor carrier, ships by his company the earns way?

The statute

would cover it, wouldn’t it?
MR. GREENAWALTs Well, if the
Q

Sure, it will.

MR. GREENAWALT:

— owner of a common carrier, I

mean, if a guy drives his own bus, whether that’s still a common
carrier, I’m not sure.

So there would be that question as to

whether it's a common carrier.
But putting it the owner of the railroad
Q

Well, no, this —

MR. GREENAWALT:

— owning his own train? then, that's

covered,
Q

No, no, you can’t get out that easy.
[Laughter,]

This one has a certificate from the Interstate
Commerce Commission.

The Stanley Transportation Company.

And they ship a box of 100 of the same — his own books, that
nobody has ever seen but him, to his country home which is
16 inches on the other side of the State line, he has violated
this statute.
MR. GREENAWALT
yes, he has.
Q

If that’s still a common carrier,

And X think it would be.
And you would think the statute would cover the

situation where a man calls up a book store and says, "Please

33
send me over — please mail to me a copy of so-and-so" and it's
mailed to him.
MR, GREENAW^LTs
mail.

There's a separate provision for

1' mean if it's sent by — that's 1461
Q

~

And you would think that would be constitutional?

MR„ ; GREENAWALT:

Oh, absolutely»

I mean Reids1 makes

that clear, I should think.
Q

Well, Reidel was going against the seller, 1 take

it.
MR. GREEHAWALTs

Oh, well

yes, we do think that if

there is not a right to sell, there is also not a right to buy.
And -Q

So that —

MR. GREEHAWALT:

—• we think that prosecution could

be brought against the purchaser in those situations.
q

..... yOU Gay that the statute wouldn't be

invalidated by Stanley if it authorised, seizure of an allegedly
obscene material in the mails, addressed to a user, would have
Stanley rights if he ever got it inside his house?
MR, GREEHAWALT: That is correct.

Yes.

In other words, if you sent off to a book company
asking them to ; :

:l you something, and it was sent to you, we

don't think there's be any constitutional bar to prosecute
the purchase r as wall as the seller.
On the severability point, I'd like to suggest the

language of United States vs._ Jackson,
opinion by Mr. Justice Stewart.
said

the Court said?

390 U«S« 570, an

In a footnote on page 385 he

whatever relevance such an explicit

clause may have in creating a presumption of severability,
the ultimate determination of severability will rarely turn
on the presence or absence of such -a clause.

We think it's

clear that,whatever the specific language of the severability
provision, basically the question is trying to ascertain
congressional intent as to whether it would want the remainder
of the statute preserved or not.
Finally, as to the legislative history that's been
suggested,

seems to me the major defect with the argument

as it*s been made is that the conclusion doesn't follow from
the premise.
It is clearly true that Congress does mean to cover
non-commercial transportation, but it does not follow from
that that if it has to have only commercial transportation or
nothing at all, it would choose nothing at all.

And that

worries the question here on the overbreadth point.
I might mention that, because I think"in a sense this
supports another point we were making, that this provision —
well, first of all, the original 1897 statute did not, if you
deposited the material on the common carrier, there was
Lfoutor
only the person who took the material from the common carrier

35
that had the limit that ray brother has mentioned.
So that was relevant only to the receiver, not to the
person who deposited the material.
Secondly, in 1909, when this change was made, a
similar change was made as to Section 1461, and the
Congressional Record in the House indicates that the reason
that the change was made was because the — it was very diffi­
cult to prove the element that was required in showing the
purpose of the person who was receiving the material from the
common carrier.

So that the words were eliminated to require

— to eliminate a difficult element of proof.
And I think that supports our argument, that to
draw that constitutional distinction does create a difficult
element of proof which Congress has not wished to impose, and
which is not required by any of this Court's decisions.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you, Mr. Graerawalt.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at Is31 o’clock, p.m., the case was
