ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN M. LUCENTE, ESQ,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LUCEMTEs

Mr, Ckisf Justice, and may it please

the Court*
The primary question presented by this case involves
Section 5(3)(f) of th® Interstate Commerce Act,
:

initial provisions -of that section require th©

Inters fcvte OBRsrero* Commission, m. a prerequisite, to approval
of. & raager, to impose protective conditions for the - benefit
o" ft-stlv ~-0.■ affected by the transaction.
The las a sentence, as

alternat ive to imposition

of conditions by th© Commission*; provides that notwithstanding
any other provision of the Act-... an agreement pertaining to the
protection ©f employees away be entered into by any carrier ancl.
the duly authorized representatives of its employees•
At issue her© is th© relationship between th®
Commission’® authority to impose protective conditions and
the right, of repr^n^atatives of carriers and their employees
to &nter into- egr^fuaents coseerniisg that

The claims asserted by the respondents in this case
arise out of t',r; 1364 merger of the Nickel Plate, the Norfolk
and Wes terra, «ad several other carriers.

As a part of that

translation ft ■ Norfolk and Western acquired the Sandusky Line
of the Pennsylvania Railroad.
The respondents wore employed by the Pennsylvania
and worked on tbs Sandusky Lino prior to its sale to the Norfolk
and Western,

These employees seek certain payments which they

contend they are entitled to under the Commission’s order
approving the merger.
When the NfcW sought Commission approval of the merger,
approximately 20 railroad unions intervened in opposition and
asked the Commission to impose protective conditions for the
benefit of employees who might foa affected.
el loving extensive negotiations, however, the
Brothvraaol of Railroad Trainmen, which represented th®
respondiand tiro other unions entered into an employee
prot- otirn

nvt with the Norfolk end Western, dated January

10, 1962.
This agreement,

which recited that it was made

pursuant to the last sentence of Section 5(2) (f), provided a'
type of employs© protection which differed significantly from
that which Section 5(2)(f) requires when th© Commission imposes
protective conditions,

when protective benefits are prescribed

by the Commission, an employee’s pre-merger compensation must

5
be protected for a period of four years or for the number of
years of employment prior to the merger, whichever is less.
There is no guarantee of continued employment and
the protection flows only from the employing carrier.
Whoa the protective benefits are prescribed — but

the IS62 agrcement, however, went far beyond this type of
protection, and constituted, in effect, a lifetime guarantee
ition.

The initial paragraph of the

agreement provided that with respect to Nickel Plate employees
the NSW would take such employees into its employment, and would
guarantee that they would not be adversely affected with
•respect to employment or compensation subsequent to the merger.
Paragraph two of the agreement provided the same
thing for Wabash employees.
Section 3 of the agreement covered the Pennsylvania
erapl -y@es asx th'j Sandusky Line, who were given an option, first,

to trwdn with the Pennsylvania or to become employees of the
N&w.

Section 3 provided, that those electing N&W employment

would not be deprived of employment or placed in a worse
position with respect to compensation except, and I quote,
"that Norfolk & Western shall not be required to. provide
employment to any such, employe© ... of greater duration than
\

'

'

such employee enjoyed on" the Sandusky Lin® in the year prior
to merger.
The written record of the negotiations with respect

6
to this agreement shows that the parties? by this proviso»
intended to m&k© the guarantee for Pennsylvania employees ooextensive with their pre-merger employment experience on the
Sandusky Lina.
In this respect the protection provided by Section 3
differed somawhtt from that provided by Sections 1 and 2„

Under Sections 1 and 2 the employees were protected
on

locis of ttoir full pre-merger earnings while protection y

for Pennsylvania employees was limited to their earnings from

the Sandusky Line*
This reason for this difference lies in the nature of
the transaction.

With respect to the Nickel Plate and Wabash employees
that were covered by Sections 1 and 2, the Pennsylvania — or
the

n&w,

rather» acquired the entire working territory that

these employees held seniority rights over.

The protection

which the NSW provided was accordingly based on their pre­

merger employment -without limitation *
The Pi?.rv-;y!;/a,nia employees? ©a the other hand» who
worked cn the Sandusky Line? also worked on other portions of

the Pennsylvania which were not acquired by "the NSW.
Operations on the Sandusky Lin® were manned by
employees of the Pennsylvania who had seniority rights over
th© entire Toledo Division*
of the Toledo Division*

Tha Sandusky Li».© was only a part

And these employees worked part of the

?
fciui®tilths on the Sandusky Line and part, of the time on other
portions of the Toledo Division.
When the N&W acquired the Sandusky Line it thus
acquired only a portion of the working territory of these
employees, and it offered protection limited to the portion of
the territory acquired.
This type of protection was intended primarily to
discourage an excessive transfer of Pennsylvania employees to
the

y.m

pursuant to the option, which I've already referred to.
If a transfer appeared attractive only to those with

full-time earnings on the Sandusky Line, it was assumed that a
sufficient number of employees would remain with the
Pennsylvania to permit it to man its operations on the
remaining portions of the Toledo Division, and that the number
electing employment with the M&W would be fairly consistent
with the operational needs on the acquired.line.
Despite this purpose, soma employees with limited
earnings on the Sandusky Lino did elect to become EJ&W employees»
Ths respondente in this situation, in this case rather, illus­
trat® the situation. •
Prior to the merger, the respondents her© worked
primarily on other portion» of the Toledo Division, spending
only vary limited time on the Sandusky Line.
Thay nevertheless chose to abandon their former
working territory and to limit themselves to the Sandusky Lina",

8
which had provided only minims1 work opportunities for them»
Had these employees remained with the Pennsylvania,
it is unlikely that the sale of the Sandusky Line would have
had any appreciable effect on their earnings.
To return to the chronology events;
approved the mergar in 1264.

The Commission

Its report referred to the fact

that the employee representatives and the N&W had entered into
an agreement pertaining to employe©, protection, and as to such
employes the Commission found that in view of the agreement
no conditions need be imposed for the protection of those
emplcy?os covered by such agreement.
;.4ow, with respect to employees not covered by the
agresKiont, fchs Commission did prescribe and impose in its
order of approval the traditional four-year income protection,
which Section 5(2){f) requires in those circumstances•
The approved transactions were consummated in
October of 1964.

During the months immediately following, the

NGW and the Brotherhood attempted to compute the protective
benefits due the Sandusky Line employees•

But the NfiW was

able to obtain from the Pennsylvania earnings data pertaining
only to total earnings over the Toledo Division.

It was unable

to obtain, in the initial stages following the merger, a
breakdown shewing wages earned on the Sandusky Line alone.
It was consequently impossible, cm the basis of that
data,

determine the benefits due employees under Section 3,

9
"? ■

.

.

of understanding were entered into.

lefcfcs

The letter of understanding

provided for monetary payments which met the immediate needs
of the employee.

while the implementing agreement, contained a

very detailed formula, with respect to the calculation of
benefits, the agreement very expressly provided that such
benefits were to be determined by taking the total compensation
received by the affected employees for service performed on
the Sandusky Line in the 12 months prior to merger, and dividing
by 12.
Following this disposition of the matter, several of
til© arslb:,:. ros, former Pennsylvania employees, complained to
thoirc union officials that implementing agreement 1-A and the
letter of undsrstending did not provide the payments that they
v/ere entitled to under the 1962 'agreement.
N

t

These employees contended that the 1962 agreement
protected their entire earnings over the entire Toledo Division,
and that implementing rgrecamnt 1-A gives them something less.
Th© Brotherhood officials who had negotiated these
agreements advised th® complaining employees that th<£is? inter­
pretation of the 1962 agreement was wrong, and that implementing
agreement 1-A was fully consistent with the 1962 agreement.
The complaining employees were then afforded a full
hearing before the Brotherhood’s National Board of Appeals,

the qi-CRfcion of tie r^ot-oing of the 1362 agreement, and its
relationship to the implementing agreement i~A, should b©
taken to arbitration, as provided by the agreement.
Th© Brotherhood*© National Board of Appeals, its
'vary highest appellate body, concluded that the position taken
by the employees was without merit and that implementing
agreement 1-A was entirely consistent with the 1362 agreement.
The Board also concluded that ther© was no disagreement between
th© Brotherhood and the NSW as to th© meaning of these
agreements, and it consequently declined to invoke arbitration,
Th© employess then instituted th® present action

GidM. ARGUMENT OF MARTIN M. LUCENTE, ESQ.
MR. luc-acte:

[Resumed]

Mr. Chief Justice, end may it please

th© Courts
l had just described the holdings of the courts
below, and I should now like to discuss the respects in which
we consider those decisions to be wrong.
The basic and primary error of the decisions below
concerns the conclusion that th© Interstate Commerce Commission
is required by Section 5(2)(f) of the Act to prescribe protec­
tion far employees despite the existence of a prior collective
bargaining agreement on this subject.
Th.-j terms of the Act and its legislative history
clc.; srly el.cvr thf-.e Congress intended to preserve for the parties
to a

tho right to resolve employe© protection problems

through collective bargaining.

And that an agreement on the

> be ■&
prescription of conditions by the Commission.

.■
This is apparent

both from thr term*» of the Act and its legislative history.
With respect to the literal structure of the Act,
th© first two sentences require the Commission, as a part of its
approval of a covered transaction, to prescribe conditions for

13
the benefit of affected mo:oloyzsr: .

T.tv:- l::;- -;,

t ■•..

specifically provides that notwithstanding any other provision
of the Act, representatives of the carriers and their employees
may enter into agreements pertaining to protection of employees.
Tha only possible reason for the inclusion of this

notwithetending language was to insure that nothing in the Act
V7ev<ld

: c^nwtrved to limit the right to make agreements and

to requiro any questions in this regard to be resolved in favor
of fha pnrfciec* rights to saak® collective bargaining agreements
pertaining to employee protection.
The only provisions of the Act which relate in any
way to employee protection are the provisions of Section 5(2}(f).
The first two sentences of that section are thus the only
possible source of restrictions on the parties’ rights to agree
to employes protection.

It would seem indisputable, therefore,

that the “nofcwithst anding* clause of Section 5(2) (f) eliminates
«viy rcmtrieid.or..! on tlis col lacti v® bargaining process which

inferred from the first two sentences

rriafi’r? 13 ?L® Commission *s authority and obligations in the

premj.se©,
2'hie

apparent literal meaning is amply confirmed by

the legislative history of. the Section.

This history shows

that Section 5 was the .result of an agreement between labor
and management, and that Congress enacted the substantive
provisions upon which the parties agreed.

The labor spokesmen for the sponsoring' .group stated
that the so-called Washing-ton job protection agreement provided
suitable "protection in the event of a merger and that labor
would not be seeking legislation on the subject at all., wore it
not for the fact that approximately 15 percent of the railroads
were not parties to the agreement.
This spokesman said that if we could get all of the
roads into the.agreement, we would not
as & metier of lev,

fast protecti •

Thus - the requirement that the Commission
■ oyees was intended to-be operative

only in the event that a.voluntary agreement had not been
reached on this subject prior to Commission approval.
The principal congressional spokesman supporting this
legislation stated the purpose of the session as follows, and
i quotee

"The proposed labor clause sets up specific standards
Ivlin.;', . But this pro's Lsi

contains a cisse;
proc • •

that permits the industry, through the

• €■.?. ociisstiva bargaining, to work out its problems in

the Ccvgvov-:can primarily involved in the passage

cion to follow, tot. only wh=-3r® the parties did not resolws
miploymi protection pro):)lams through a vol

15
bargaining agreement.
ThU, tec: al&tivs history reveals that ©vary group that
was active in sponsoring

5(2} (f)

ency­

clic tat® d protection in ©very merger, and was insistent that the
process of collective bargaining be preserved as an alternative
to agency prescription of protective conditions.
Despite this overwhelming evidence of the purpose and
meaning of Section 5|2)if), the courts below construed it to
severely limit the ability of unions and the carriers to enter
into agreements with respect to protection and to require the
Commission to impose protection in ©very instance.

The decisions below effectively eliminate the last
sentence of Section 5(2}(f) as an operative portion of the
statute.
Under thane decisions, 'the Commission is required to

review sgrccucinf s relating to employee protection, to determine
their adequacy, and to impose the terms and conditions which it
considers proper.

The collective bargaining agreement thus

becomes nothing more than a suggestion to the Commission as to
what it might do in the case pending before it.
If the third sentence of Section 5(2}(f) were
eliminated from the statute entirely, no one would question the
right of labor and management to enter into a stipulation,
submit the stipulation to the Commission, suggesting whafc
protective conditions should bo imposed.

16
But under the decisions below that is the sol© function
which is now attributable to the last sentence of Section
>SN.

5(2} {£) .

Six? last sentence thus becomes virtually meaningless

appendage to the-section*
Q

Hell, could I ask you# if the Commission does

incorporate in its order the terms of an agreement entered
into between the union end the company# may the union and the
company e after tha Commission enters its order«arrive at an
agrsrtrnt differett frta what the. Commission has put in its
order?
MR. LUCENTE:

Well# under the decisions belowf Mr.

Justice# they may not.
Q

Well# what's your view?

MR.LUCENTE;

My view of the statute is that if the

Commission has entered an order which imposes certain protecdiva condition;-}, the parties thereafter# under the last sentence
of s.Kf:i ■ 5{2) (£; ,b.itv€: the right to enter into an agreement
contract,able to both —
Q

But setting different terms# then# ~~

Pit, itesp.te:

Which Blight set 'different terms than thcs

prescribed by —
Q

Well# don't you have to win on that point to win

this case?

MR. LUCENTEs

No.

No, Your Honor# we do not.

Because

in this case the agreement upon which we rely principally is the

1?
agreement that was entered Into prior to the Commission's order

of approval.
Q

Exactly.

MR. LUCENTE s

This was arrived at prior to the

Commission's order of approval.
Q

But let's as aura®

that the prior agreement and

the Corar-'i.&sion’s order have terms in them that are different
from the later agreement.
MR. LUCENTE;
Q

Then we have to ~~

Then yonhave

MR. LUCENTE:

to dowhat?

- convince you, Your Honor, that under

Section 5(2} {£} iim parties, subsequent to a merger, may
collectively bargain and adjust the conditions
Q

Right.

MR. LUCENTE:

— to suit what they consider to be

the best interests
—
»
Q

So to win you've got to overturn, then, 1 take it,

or you would Xikv •:;» overturn the construction of the prior
agrwvvut, given to that agreement by feh« district court and
tii© Court of Appeals.
MR. LUCENTE;

But if ws assume, Your Honor, that the

prior agreement was not incorporated in the Commission's order.
Q

That’s one point.

MRa LUCENTE;

Then we need only prove, as X see it,

that under Section 5(2)Cf), the parties have a right to enter

18
into such a prior «agreement, and if a dispute arises as to what
th® prior agreement moans, then there is the process of
arbitration and the other administrative.processes open to
determine that question.
The prior agreement stands then, Your Honor, as an
independent self-sustaining collective bargaining agreement.
Ihid t! 3 party's right with respect to it are the same as with
r^or-3 *t to my other collective bargaining agreement.
Q

Y&c., but do X understand you then to say —

’.urpos-s fcko comnissioa’s order is an order pursuant to the first
two .vsntenees of th© section, and it. becomes operative for a
year, year and a half, and then th© unions and the carrier,
— whafc what carrier would that be?
m. LUGENTE ?
Q

Norfolk and Western.

The surviving carrier.

ME. LUCENTE? Surviving carrier, yes.
Q

— sit down and make brand new agreements, that

then supersedes the Board’s order; is that your position?
ME, LUCENTEs To the extent that it provides for
di o

oc: vdltix res, it would supersede'' the conditions imposed

by statute.
Q

Is that by reason of the proviso or not?

MR. LUCENTEs that’s by reason of the proviso.

Tha

proviso, Your Honor, relates both fco agreements'which are mad©
prior to Commission approval of a merger and it also relates to

19
agreement*:* which ara m4e subsequent to Commission approval cf
a merger.

And in both ins tineas r the "notwithstanding ” language

of that proviso is intended to make it clear that, the parties
may make an agreement pertaining to employee protection
notwithstanding th® other provisions of th© Act.

Which, in effect,

means notwithstanding the first two sentences of that section.
And the first two sentences of that section are the sentences
pursuant to which th© Commission acts when it imposes protective
conditions.
Q

How often do-iss that happen, a subsequent

agreement?
MIC, LUCEKTEs

Thera are many subsequent agreements

made, Your Honor, but it frequently happens that the subsequent
agreements will implement or explain the terms of, or fill in
th© details of more general provisions in th© prior agreement.
So that the process of negotiating with respect to
conditions which arisa after th© merger is consummated is a
very vital and activo one —
Q

Wall, what's been th© practice?

when th©

merger is contemplated, do th© unions and the carriers sit
down and v-.-rk out these preliminary agreements before the
approval cf th®

- .

vh« lUCBiaaB:

That h&3 frequently been th® practice,

Your Honor o
y

Which as been the ~~ is that more generally the

20
casa?
HR. LUCENTEs That is more generally the case, at
least in the last ten years# than having the Commission proscribe
conditions without any prior agreement by the parties.
The more general condition currently is for the parties to sit
down and work out agreements pertaining to employee protection
before the Commission enters its order of approval.
Q

Is there any reference made to such agreements

when they ere completely executed before the approval?
MR. LUCENTE: The Commission —
Q

In the order of approval — is? there any refer-

©nee in the order of approval?
MR. LUCENTE: Th© Commission in its report will refer
As they did in this case, Your Honor.

to those.
Q

In the order of approval, ic there any reference

mads —
MR.

lucentes

Not in the order of approval# in tho

formal order of approval.

But in the report it doss set forth

tho fact that the parties have entered into an agreement and#
as it does in this case# it recites that because the parties
have road© an agreement pertaining to this subject# there is
nothing for us to do under Section 5(2)(f)„
Q

no

first or second sentence provisions at all?

MR. LUCEPTEs Well# in this case# that is right with
respact u ■ employees covered by the agreement; but I should

21
add this additional detail.

That sometimes the agreements which

are sm.de, and do not cover all of the employees? and the
Commission in. its order of approval will then impose terms
and conditions for the employees not covered®
Q

Under the first, two sentences»

HR. LUCENTE:

Under the first two sentences.

But when

an agreement has been mad©? the invariable practice of the
Commission, and this is discussed in detail in the amicus
brief which the United states and the commission have submitted
in,this case? Your Honor.

The invariable practice of the

Commission? where. an agreement has been made, is to recite
that fact in its rc-port and then to proceed to approve the
merger on the grounds that the agreement provides the protection
required by the Act? arid its order need not provide that
protection.
Is it fair to as stare that this custom that you've

Q

described of having the railroads and the union work out these
agreements, is simply a.reflection of the fact that most often
•j

they'd rather

work out their own problems than have sons©

governmental agency impose agreements on them?
MR. LUCENTE8 That is undoubtedly the situation? Your
Honor? and it permits the railroads and the unions to work out
problems that are not only directly relevant to employs©
protection but ere also relevant to other situations which
will arise in connection with the merger.

In the Great Northern-

22
Burlington merger, for example, which was before this Court,
the parties worked out voluminous agreements implementing the
manner in which the various seniority districts would be put
I

together

xnbined properties, the manner in which trains

would be manned, and including among the terms of the agreement
protection for employees*

So it is quite customary when these

agreements are made, as they almost invariably made in current
mergers, for the parties to work out problems of employee
protection and at the same time to work out many other labor
relations problems attendant upon the contemplated merger*
The whole thing fifes together as on© bundle, as it
war®, and as on® of the difficulties of the approach below is
that tli© Court looked at the agreements only for this vary
narrow arcs a of whether it provides full protection for 'four
years based on all earnings and had ignored all of the other
aspects of the agreement, and the respects in which 'the agreement
dealt with ether things and dealt with them on a very favorable
basis, as far as the unions are concerned•
Now, one other further point I would like to make,
in conclusion, is that the lower courts” decisions -are also
wrong because they‘-fail to give appropriate effect to this
Court’s holdings in Republic Steel vs, Maddox, End in Vaca vs*
Sipes, regarding administrative remedies and the necessity of
their exhaustion before judicial remedies can be invoked»
tod I call the Court’s attention again to the amicus

23
brief filed by United States and the Commission which discusses

th~; legislative history, and the Interstate Comm-src® Commission's
interpretation of the statute* and arrives at the conclusions
which I have! stated with respect to what Section 5(25 (f) means,
Thank you.
Q

Mr. Lucente, may I ask one question before you

sit down;
You are adhering to your position on the jurisdictional
issue here* I take it?

MS.LUCENTEs
Q

Yes.

Do you have a comment about the suggestion in

your opponent’s brief* that Norfolk and Western apparently* by
its answer, conceded that the 1962 agreement was incorporated
in the ’64 order?
MS. LUCENTE:

Yes, X do* Your Honor.

In the district

court* Your Honor, when the complaint was filed, it alleged
that fch® plaintiff’s claims were based upon the 1964 order
of the- Commission, -nci in a number of paragraphs it alleged
that the order had been incorporated in — the agreement had'
been incorporated in th© order.
Th® Norfolk and Western first filed a motion to
dismiss, before it filed an answer in the district court.

-The

motion to dismiss * as th© district court judge recognised* at
pages 28 and 29 of the Appendix stated that jurisdiction did not
lie in the district court because the order had n6t been

24
incorporated, the agreement had not been incorporated in the
order, and that the parties were proceeding under the terras of
a collective bargaining agrea&ant not under the terms of the
Commission order.
The lowar court overruled that contention,

it held,

in effect, that under Section 5 {21(f) the parties were not
permitted

* snter into e

to approval,

collective bargaining agreement prior

tod it held, therefore, that the agreement must

be considered to fca part of the Commission's order of approval.
New, subsequent to that, the NSW filed an answer, and
in that answer it admitted the allegations of three or four
paragraphs in a single part of its answer.

And among the

allegations admitted in that answer was the conclusion of
law stated in the complainfc to the effect that the agreement
of 1962 had been incorporated in the Commission's order.
So NSW at test stage of the proceeding. Your

Honor,

was merely acknowledging what had already boon

established as the lav? of the case. '.We did not make any
&c,~d.n.2,3 to w.: -1:. the Commission had done in the premises,
and wz had merely abided by what the district court had already
ruled with respect to whether or myt the agreer.vaht was
incorporated in tho order.

And of course subsequently on

appeal v?o raised the point again that the ordef did not
incorporate the agreement which the parties had made.

Q

X have just one other question, and that is:

25
If you should prevail hare, do these claimants, your opposition,
have ©ay place to go for relief?
MR. LUCENTE; The Commission, Your Honor, has
suggested in its brief, the United States and the Commission
have suggested, that under Section 5<9) of the Interstat®
Commarce Act, and under Section 5(2), that it has some
responsibility to supplement its order if it can be shewn that
supplementation of its prior order is necessary in order to make
fcht order consistant with the public interest.
So I tsk© it that the respondents here, if they have.
a complaint about the adequacy of the protection in the agree­
ment, can go back to the Commission.
Moreover, the respondents her©'have the right to go
to the Adjustment Board with their individual complaint about
what tfee agreements need*

The Adjustment Board does not

require presentation by fch© Brotherhood on behalf of individuals
it can present their com individual claims.

And, accordingly,

they can go to the Adjustment Board for & determination as to
what their rights are in the premises.
Q

So that here's an initial agreement in 1952, and

wc just ignore the Commission's order on the theory of the
case, then we have? a subsequent agreement.

In that subsequent

agreement, it just purports to interpret the prior agreement?
MR. LUCENTE%
Q

Yes.

It does' not tak© the approach that the prior

26

agreement says h, and we are going to change the protections
of this 1962 agreement setupj isn’t that correct?
MR, LUCENTEs That is whet is -- that's a fact in
this situation.
Q

That is what happens in most cases.
Now, would you say that fch® subsequent agreement,

if it took the approach that we*re going to change the protection
in fch© '62 agreement would, nevertheless, be valid?

MR. LUCENTEs
Q

Yes, I would, Your Honor.

Because of the “notwithstanding" clause of the

section —
MR. LUCENTEs The subsequent agreement, Your Honor,
stands on its own feet, as an independent collective bargaining
agreement.
Q

Well, I don't suppose'the statute would have

intended feo giv© such an agreement any validity that it didn’t
otherwise have.
HR. LUCENTEs
Q

What?

MR. LUCENTE:

Q
t\

Yes, I would agree with that, Your Honor.

I 'would agree with that —

So that wholly aside from the statute, you think

union ?mtl an employer may renegotiate downward fch© benefits

of a prior collective bargaining contract?
MR. LUCENTE s

Y©s, I think that under the "notwith­

standing"' clause of the proviso, Your Honor, —
Q

I know, but —

27
MR, LUCENTE;

Oh, independent of the statute, X’sn

sorry.
I would think so. Your Honor, because of general
principles regarding the authority of a collective bargaining
representative,
Q

Yes.

MR. LUCENTE:

And the collective bargaining representa­

tive has the authority to change the terras of a prior agreement»
And —
Q

Subject only, 1 suppose, to Vaca vs. Sipes, —

MR* LUCENTE:
Q

That’s right, Your Honor,

— relations of good faith# or good faith

representation.
MR. LUCENTE;

All we’re contending for here with

respect to these agreements if the recognition of the traditional
principle that the collectiva bargaining representative, in
the absence of Vaca va. Sipes, and doctrines akin to it# has
authority to bind the class that it represents, and it may do
so even though the terms differ from those of the previous
union-nesgofci at@d agreements •
'-Q
more.

L©t me ask you this, and I won't hold you any

Let’s suppose-) we disagreed with you and agreed with the

courts below, that the i960- ~~ the subsequent agreement
actually changed the 1962 agreement, that the 1962 agreement
meant one thing and the *65 agreement meant the other? in short.

28

we disagreed wi th the union and th© company as to whet the
*62 agrusiaent meant.

What should we do then, because both

courts bsilow have given s construction of th© '62 agreement
contrary to your claim,
Nov/, if w© agree with the two courts below, then
affirmance would have t© rest on th© idea that even if the
two parties negotiating had thought there were changing the '62
agreement, they nevertheless would have changed them.

1 am not

sure they would have.
bet*s assume th© *62 agreement had clearly said
earnings are to foe measured by reference to the entire Toledo
Division.

There coulc|h*t have bean say argument about it.

And thw. the two parties sat down.

Do you think they would have,

nevertheless, coma out saying we're going to reduce that pay,
and measure it by the Sandusky service aion©?
*

MR. LUCbhTCs There 'is a possibility, although'!' think
it’s quit© unlikely, but it has happened in mergers and —
Q

Well, it has happened.

What should we do, should
■f

w© assume that, or would we have to remand it?
MR, LUCENTEs

Well, if you could not reach the

question, Year Honor, of whether th© subsequent .agreement
changes the prior agreement, I take it, unless you had first
determined that the Court of Appeals and the district court
were correct in their -Q

Correct, that’s just assuming

MR,-, IHjChkts?
Q

interpretation of Section 5(2) (f) .

Assome '

MR. LUCENTEs

agreed with th®m.
I think that if the Court arrived at

that conclusion, that —- and if the issue could properly be
put to fch© district court as to what the agreements mean, that
there are issues which are properly triable back there as to
what the authorities intended —
Q

I know, but the court ha© already — 'the district

court and the Court of Appeals have already said that the '62
agreement, has been modified by the *65 agreement,
MR. LUCENTEs But they also, the district court,
Your Honor, also

left open certain issues to b© arbitrated

nnd the Court of Appeal© held that those issues should be
resolved instead by the district court.

So there is something

remaining to be dene in the district court.
Q

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERt

Mr. Murray.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. MURRAY, JR., ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MURRAY *

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

the Courts
I would like to respond immediately to the discussion
concerning this post-merger agreement,
We submit, that the holdings of the district court
and the* Court of Appeals are unequivocal, that what the agree-

30

roents themselves show is not that the subsequent agreement

modified or altered the protection given these employees by the
1962 agreement:» but that it abrogated any meaningful protection
that the.' e employees; received*

That was their finding by

simply resuing the two agreements, the pre-merger agreement and
the subsequent agreement.
Just hoi? dramatically the two — the latter agreement
modified the protection which we submit and the courts found
was imposed by the Commission is, I believe, set forth in some
detail in our brief at page 31»

And what we conclude there

in our discussion of that portion of the record is that, in
net effect, what happened to these men three years after the
merger was that they were forced to pay back the limited
benefits which Norfolk and Western said they ware entitled to,

because, having had received unemployment compensation during
the IB-w.ozrhh period immediately after the merger, they,
under the law,

iving, theoretically at least,

i ncora through the subsequent agreement, and since the amounts
that they had received in unemployment compensation for the
most part weren't any greater than what they had received by
way of the subsequent agreements.

They literally were told

— now they're back on their feet and back at work, they were
literally told they had to repay this*
How, I just point this out because it dramatizes in
practical point of fact how seriously th® subsequent agreements

31
abrogated or nullified the protective features of the pre-merger
agreement.

Q

At© you. suggesting a bad faith or breach of

fiduciary duty as in Sipes?
MR. MURRAYs

Mr. Chief Justice, I don’t believe the

record, as it was at the time the court below entered summary
judgment, permitted a sufficient development of the facts in
this case, quite candidly, for mo to comment categorically
as to whether there was bad faith.
I would say this, that there was at the very least a
perfunctory handling of the claims of these small band of
Sandusky men by the union; at the very least, if not bad faith.
But that particular aspect of the case did not develop th®
question of whether or not their union in fact —
Q

Well, that's what I was leading up to.

"If you

'

are suggesting or undertaking to attack the agreement, undermine
it

.uuid, you've got a heavy burden.

Can you undermine

asiass it turns out to be an improvident, undesirable,
unwise vgrt-Triont, having in mind th® rather express provision®
of the statute in the last sentence cf the statute?
MR. MURRAYs

Permit m© to respond to-that question

this way, and I hops responsivelys

We are not her© contending

that subsequent to agreements th© unions and railroads can't
get together and make the, as termed in the industry,
implementing agreements.

Quit© th© contrary, we recognize

32

the fact that implementing agreements are absolutely necessary
to carry out the various features of these mergers.
Our contention here is, and the court below held,
that the very language of the third sentence of Section 5(2)(f),
which says that agreements which pertain to the protection of
the interest of the employee may b® entered into subsequent to
these orders of approval.

That this, at the very least,

requires that all of the protection, all ©£ the meaningful
protection given by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its
order simply can't b© wiped out by an agreement, whether it's
based on bad faith, a mistake *— if the Court please, the
district court and the court of Appeals, we submit,, didn't roach
the question of the motive behind the unions in turning down
the appeal of these men when they appealed to their National
Board of Appeals.
It merely lifted the two agreements and said -this
agreement takes away everything that was given by the agreement
prior to the merger.
And I might, Mr. Chief Justice, add on© further
point in the same vain»

The position of these trainmen was

that th-sir union temporized on their behalf, and we believe
that if w® were permitted, had we been permitted to

develop

tii© evidence in this case, it would have been that more
tempori station and perfunctory handling, or lack of

&

graph of

the complexities of their claim, on the part of that union

33
hierarchy which was responsible for fch-a fact that the union
. its union did not act on their behalf*
Q

t

Conceivably, that might give them causa of action

somefcira© against the union.

That wouldn’t bo the framework of

this situation, would it?
MR. MURRAY:

Ho, Your Honor, it would not*

It has

bean suggested, and if 1 may just attempt to respond to that
question:
During Mr. Lucente’© comments the Court referred to
the -- l believe Mr. Justice White asked him, assuming that the

j ur i« dieticn.»l determination of the court below concerning
i«.corporation is accepted as fact.

Assuming this to be the

case, what would fo© the result?
ted I believe Mr, Justice Blackmun ask-ad the question

of whether — how Mr. Lucente would 'answer the question of the
admission in fch® answer as *to the fact of incorporation.

W©

want to meet this case head on in this Court, not on, any
technical admissions in the answer, and we want to meet it
head on for two reasons.

We submit that as m intensely

practical matter, unless the decisions of the courts below are
affirm0d on the question of jurisdiction, employees who are

doniod protection will have no practicable avenue of redress,
to

co

-3 fc&dk. to Mr. Chief Justice Burger's question•
. the appellee is that

«sraployeds in the position of those trainman could very wall have

sued their own union for bad faith.

That would hav» l-z-an cos

alternative course of action open to them.
And we submit that this, as well as the other
arguable — the avenues of redress which have bean argued are
utterly impracticable’.

These men were out of work, on

unemployment, they were now in a restructured union situation,
and fc© suggest that man in this position should now have to
sue their own union for breach of — assuming that that would
©van be a viable alternative open to them, should have to- sue
their own:;, union ;nd thereby, in effect, have to pay their own
ovg.vir

ction from the unios, dues they were paying in, w©

suggest is manifestly contrary to the explicit intentions of
Section £(2)(f) and itv policy considerations•
.

Q

Mr. Murray.

MR. MURRAY:

Q

Yes, Your Honor?

Is it your view of 5(2) (f) that there must be,

without regard to whether there are prior agreements or not,
at the time of approval, a provision imposed by the ICC under
Sections l and 2?
MR. MURRAYs That is our provision — that is our
position, yes.
Q

And then do you go on from that to say that

"notiiStenduig" clause then is limited in application to

-av:I'.;.:j agreements, that is, agreements which implement
that provi;si on?

35
*

MR. MURRAYS

No, Your Honor.

We concede that, as

has been the practice, that the unions and railroads can
enter into agr^e^.-ants prior to Commission approval with respect
to their own protection, and, Mr. Justice Brennan, let rn©
respond to that —
Q

Well, excuse

MR. MURRAY:
Q

mm

just one minute.

Yes.

I just want to be sure.

Although you -do concede,

I gather this is under the “notwithstanding3 clause, that the
unions and the railroads may enter into agreements before the
merger, pd after the merger, you nevertheless contend that
there must b© Sections 1 and 2 conditions as imposed by the

ICC in tha ordor of approval.

Is that right?
i

MR. MURRAYs

That ie correct.

That i:-j correct.

And we would just — if I may

respond just briefly further.

I believe the ICC, in a very

exhaustive study of the legislative history, has placed its
emphasis

on the

idiaory that if the Interstate Commerce Commis­

sion is not to step aside and disavow any connection or any
obligations wh ire they have met with the unions and the
railroads have agreed to conditions, that the result would be
encroachment upon traditional collective bargaining processes.
And what we’re suggesting here, or attempted to
sugcaa'G, in our brief, is that the important point, the
impaxfaafe foern; in this type ©£ situation should not be at the

36
pre-merger stage? but it should be on the question of how the
employe® who is actually caught up in these mergers in the
aftermath stages is going to enforce them.
And her© is why we think it is not only vital to
these employees, it 1b vital to the railroad industry itself
that, as far as the operation of the Interstat© Commerce Act
itself, the Section 5(11) of that Act be given full play in
-

>.

'

those situations, whether it's £h© employees who com© to court
saying, "Look, we, haven’t been protected as we were promised
agreement", or whether it's the railroad, more
importantly as far as the broader, economic, and social aspects
of this case are concerned, I would think would be the situation
where the railroad comes in and says "We*re trying to get’ this
merger implemented,H
And as happened in fch© Northwestern case, the unions
there took the position that the railroad can’t put this
consolidation into effect without complying with the major
disputes procedure of the Sailway labor Act.

And in that case

th-w overt, we think vary perceptively, held that in fact
exactly like the facts as the court found before it, the facts
before the Court ic. this cans, that the only way that you were
going, mi a practical matter, avoid a situation where the union
could hold the throat of a strike over the railroad as a
condition of masting its post-merger conditions as to how ‘this
agreement, despite what the Interstate Commerce Commission said,

37
how its post-'-Hierger conditions with respect to the consolidation
wara going to foa carried out.
The only way you are going fco protect against this

threat would be if you held that the Interstate Commere® Act
apply.

And in the Northwestern case, where it was the railroad

that cam© into court and said, in cases — in a factually
similar case fco this on®, where the Commission had simply
acknowledged the existence ©f a prior agreement with respect
to merger conditions.
Q

Well, would you be satisfied if it wsr© held

that the Interstat© Commerce Commission did not incorporate
these terms of the contract, that did not have to, but that a
contract made pursuant to this authorization of the federal
statute is enough in itself to present, a federal question,
©nforcib le in the federal courts?
MR, MURRAYs
o

Well, I —

I knew you wouldn't, but. you would like to have

fell© right answer given by the Court? but would you b© satisfied
as far as jurisdiction is concerned?.
Mil, MUERhYs

As far as jurisdiction is concerned, I

feel w© would have established jurisdiction, yes.

There would

be a basis for jurisdiction.
Q

questions.

Yes, and then you would reach these same
May a subsequent agreement modify either a prior

agreement or an order of the Commission?

the phrasing of that,

1 would only, Mr. Justice Whit©# question
w© don’t question that it can modify it.

What wo’re talking about is can it lower ~~
Q

Wall# modify# to reduce it?

MR. MURRAY:
Q

Take away the benefits.

Well, would you say it could reduce it?

MR. MURRAYs
2

Reduce it# yes.

Mo, no, Your Honor. We say that *—

Wall, 'that*© what 2 mean.

May it lower the --

nay a rr.ubsoqnattt agreement lower the benefits?
And you say no.
MR. MURRAYs
Q

w® say it may not lower the benefits.

Wall, you’d, say that whether it's — whether the

prior right you’re claiming is based on the contract or a
Commission order?
t

MR. MURRAY: That is correct.
Q

That is correct.

So those questions are inevitably in the case.

MR. MURRAY s

I would have to say they are.

And the

only
■2
5(2} {£} ■

Well, Mr. Murray, if, m you have said, the
to be; interpreted as saying, yea, you may have a

pricr agreoment but fchnr© must be protective provisions in the
Board’s order of approval•

Suppose you have a prior agreement

that gives leas protection than the provisions in the Board's
order?

Which prevails?
MR, MURRAYs

Well, we would say, Your Honor, that *—

39
if I understand your question correctly, it is our position —
Q

Well,, just let's take this case.

MR. HURRAY s
Q

Yes.

18ra sorry —

Suppose they said earnings were to foe ~ the

Board's order said earnings were to foe based on Toledo service.
But the prior agreement said earnings were to foe computed on
the basis of Sandusky service.

Which would prevail?

Even though the unions and the railroads entered into

the earlier Sandusky basis agreement pursuant to the "notwithstanding" clause.
MR. MURRAY:

Well, we feel. Your Honor, that the

soundest possible decision for the railroad industry and for­
th© employees would be to have this Court hold that Section
5(2)If) imposes an obligation on the Commission to assure
whether, through imposition, ©r through operation of law, a
minimal level of protection up to four years9 compensation
protection.

That, vie feel, would — and the reason I say that

is
Q

Well, what you’re, really saying is that the

Board order and not the prior agreement would be controlling —
the controlling requirement.
MR. MURRAY:

That is correct.

And that assumed facts

that you asked me.
Q

Is that the way the ICC in its amicus brief

conceives that, sine© it may enter supplemental

enter soma

supplemental orders and award supple mantel t«an©fite over and
above any agreement?
MS. MURRAYs

I believe, Your Honor, that tbs Commission

in its brief, as I recall it, took the position that these
employees would b® protected by the feet that the Interstate
Commerce Commission could always com® in and supplement its
order with respect to benefits.

And all that we're saying is

that that’s perfectly commensurate with our position, but so

long as the employees who are politically weakened ©r who sr©
pragmatically weakened by these mergers have at least the
wini?.yrotcefcion.

Because without it they don't have any

redress, as a practical matter.
Q

Thmit in effect, what you*re doing, your

suggestion may hav.s the effect of saying that we must add to
the statute a provision, after the word "employee", "Unless
such supplemental agreement reduces the benefits of the employers.
MR. MURRAY:
add that,

I wouldn't say that you would have to

we feal that
Q

But you*re reading fell® statute as though those

words were in there.
Aren* t ycm, seally?

MUlO.lY:
in ;:.ro

Mr, Chief Justice, I believe this Court,

-s, tho Mrofcharhcod of Maintenance of Way case and
e, in reviewing this legislative

history, hold, with out getting to the question of the effect of

41
a third ernt&ace smrrrmriRt, that tii-a second sentence of Section
5(2) {£) imposes a mandatory minimum duty on the Commission to
impose four years of compensation protection.

It so construed

the first and second sentences.
And what we’re saying here is that? leaving aside
tha question of any technical admission about incorporation of
the agreement, what we’re saying hero is that unless, at the
enforcement stages , employees who are caught up in the type of
situation these men were caught up in have a right to come into
court and invoke the remedial scheme of the Interstate Commerce
Act, which gives them attorney’s fees, cost* unless they have
this practical means of assuring that the protection premised
condition of approval of those mergers, they don't
really have any practical avenue of redress *
Other th-rn suing their own union, which has bean
suggested, the other two alternatives that I believe have been
mentioned, are to go tO'sthet National Railroad Adjustment Board.
This would foe a five-year process, on fch© average.

For men

who desperately'need th© help now, now that the merger has
dislocated them.
In this regard I want to point out something that
should foe stressed about ‘fch© record in this case.

These men's

primary wc-icing connection was with the City of Sandusky.
the

On

rvrr.mr,;. X believe, they had approximately 10 to 20 years’

sanior:- iy at th© time that this merger went into effect.

Th©

42

year prior to ttUU nvrger? their opportunities for employment
at Sarlva.ky had ilivinis.'vsd fcacause of th-3 very fact which gave
reason for the mergar to take place in the first place, so you

had a declining volume of revenue., and traffic at Sandusky.
So that during that period, immediately prior to the
merger, their work opportunities were limited.

But these ware

men that had hemes at Sandusky, and 15 days before this merger
took place, 'they received a notification that they could uproot
/

and go to Toledo and remain with the Pennsy or they could take
employment with the Norfolk and Western Railway Company.
And in that agreement, unequivocally, was stated —
or attached to that agreement, I should say, was the portion of
fch© pro--:.rger ^gz^gmenv? which categorically stated that if

you tabs snploymant with the Norfok and Vlas tern Railway
will have ycrar employment protected, and you will

vv

not fco placed in © worse position with respect to compensation
. during the Norfolk and Wi

e-

claimed the full arguable scope of that protection.

They have

n&v®r claimed that they had a right to a job at Sandusky.
Q

Well, isn't that one of fch© points here as to

what that first agreement means?
more than that?

It's arguable, and ia it any

Provided further none of such employees shall

be deprived of ©sapXoyment or placed in a worse position with

Does that naan just a partial year's

Doss it raooi a full year?

Is it arguable, is what

I'm asking, on this# Mr. Murray?
MR. MURRAY:
road part of Section 3.

Yes.

Mr. Justice Blackman, you just

But attached to that same agreement was

a very simple formula, which is admitted was part of that
agreement.

And it provided that the employee's protection was

to toe supplemented to the extent that it fell below his
average monthly compensation' based upon the lest 12 months in
which he performed service, divided by 12.
And as a practical matter, the only exposure of the
Norfolk end Western at Sandusky, under this pre-merger agreement,
was during the transitional period; and this is alluded to
indirectly by the district court.

Because this particular

merger protection agreement had a built-in protection against
failure of th« merger.

The Court may have noted that there is

a proviso in there that if the Norfolk and Western traffic or
/

?

rw-nusr drclirrc as a result of this merger, these employees
will not be protected.
And all. that means is that neither at — you're at
the nadir of operations, the Pennsylvania is going out of
operation; the Norfolk and Western is coming in. And to the
extent that after this merger the Norfolk and Western's business
declined, from that point on these employees wouldn't have any
protection

The only thing that they're asking, the only thing
that they have asked her®, is for that simple compensation
protection as a renuit of being out of a job at Sandusky after
the a&rgor.

That2s fc'hsj only thing that they have asked.

Q

Doesn't that really add up to where we ware

infers; th-.-.t p&shapc they made an improvident agreement?
i.R. MURRAYs We would concede that if your — Mr.
Chief Justice Burger, that if the union agreed to what Norfolk
and Western claims they agreed here, it w&& at least improvident

And if you look at the — from

Wouldn't it b© a rather dangerous proposition to

— for all contracting parties to urge this kind of relief from
an improvident contract, I suspect that sometimes railroads
make improvident contracts«
because* ©£ that?

Would they be entitled to relief

MR. MURRAYs Wall, all that we would say, Your Honor,
is that where you have a statuta with the clear policy,
underlying policy reasons of the Interstate Commerce Act,
Section 5(2)Cf) has»

Which has, as its full purpose of

existence, employs© protection.
ip say that for any reason, because of political
ir.otiv t or=, because of ignorance of what was in the Interstate
or the Interstate Commerce Commission's order, if

Commores

the railroads can sit down with the representatives of these
employees who are politically and practically disrupted in
their lives by — and can simply abolish out of hand the
protection given by the Interstate Commerce Commission, which
is exactly what happened here, then in this type of case the

protection of the Interstate Commerce Act is a cruel illusion?
end that’s what it turned out to be to these men.
These men ended up literally in a worse position

•than if ■■■■■;■* had never been promised anything under the pre\

merger agreement, as a practical matter.,;.
Q

Mr. Murray.

MR. MURRAY:
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice —

Assuming all you say, in order to give you the

thing you want, don't we have to rewrite the "notwithstanding"
clauss?

ME. MURRAYt

So, Mr. Justice Marshall, 1 would submit

that you really firm51»

As a matter of fact, v;e feel that fch©

"notwithstanding* clause is very much —
Q

You man Sections 1 and 2 among other things?

MR. MURRAY*

Among ~ that is correct.

That there's

nothing really inconsistent between the third sentence of
Section 5(2} (£) &nd the first and second sentences.

We feel

that all that this boils down to is that the Interstate Commerce

Caw :rsic'» Is required to impose conditions whore the parties
can agree upon them,

tod whore the parties agree upon them,

tii© very least that they have to do is make sure that the
employees who arc- going to be most drastically affected in
their employment relationships receive the minimal level of
protection.

That’s all we’re saying.

We have an alternative argument in there, that even
if this Court should hold that the “notwithstanding* clause
relieves the Inters feat# Commerce Commission of any responsibility
whatsoever, with rc-.-?pact to employee protection, that at the
■ as a practical matter, if
\

at the enforcement stages they have a right to the

iho protection afforded by the Interstate
Or by tfo® agreement between the union and

AI
th© railroad at. th; time that the protective conditions were
considered and agreed uponQ

That's © little bit like arguing, though, I

suggest? that the railroad should not have its interest undone
because of improvident agreements made by fchair lawyers? their
advocates.
MR. MURRAYs

Mr, Chief Justice Burger? if I may coas

back to a point that 1 tried to make a moment ago.

As a

practice! matter, it would be far more disastrous for the
railroad industry if this Court should reverse the reasoning

■

ths district court and the Court of Appeals then it would

be for the employees in the position of these plaintiffs.
If I may take a moment to explain why.
The basic holding of this Court is that — of the
courts below, is that Section 5(11) exempts the carriers and
the railroads from the operation of ths Railway Labor Act,
These men are coming here merely saying that under th©
Interstate Commerce Act they have certain rights to protection.
Now, turn that around, if yon would, for th© sake of
a hypothetical illustration.
Suppose, at Sandusky, that th© employees had put their
foot;. do*m through fchair union and said. We*re not going ahead
with ;:Ms; r.arger until you comply with the major dispute
procedures of the Railway Lator Act. That is, we don't like
certain conditions that we agreed upon, and we don't like

c@rta.lr* conditions that th© Interstat® Commerce Commission
imposed her®.

And before yon can go ahead, well strike if

you go ahead and change our contract*
Mow, ©IX that \m're saying her® is that th© same
principles which apply, which the court applied below, that
is, if you’re going to get these mergers into effect and
efficaciously provide employment for the employees,and if
you’re going to absolve the railroad from having th© unions
hold a threat of strike over their heads if they don’t do
something different to the Interstate Commerce Commission
order, as was the case in Northwestern, you’ve simply got
to r&cov.t-.ilc: the. objectives of the Railway Labor Act, which
wo concede require collectivo agreements on all matters.
And the requirements of th© interstate Commerce Act.
And that’s what the court did, and w© suggest that
there’s a real genius in the decisions of the courts below,
a very grsat perception, because in effect it tires out the
disputes related to mergers ©nd makes the Interstate Commerce
Act the applicable law, and obviatos the risk of national
rail strikes in situations where the unions don’t like what
th© Interstat© Commerce Commission requires.
And that isn’t -- we feel that — if I may say in
ccriOlission, wa £e»l that the results, to th© railroad industry
itstIf wculd b& ::&■? aarcs deleterious and far more avers® if
th© ck:.oi::':k':B of th ; courts below were reversed, as reflected i

its aio:. , practical? iri.trrsly practical aspects by the fact,

Just as a hypothetical case# Mr. Murray -~

MR. MURRAY :

Y©s.

-“if th® union and the employees did not like

the conditions that were imposed by the, ICC# and they did
strike# could the strike be enjoined?
MR. MURRAYs

Y©s# it could# Your Honor? yes# it

could.
Q

Why?

MR. MURRAYs

Wall, the — and that’s the# if I may

use the: phrase# the real beauty of the decision below.

Because#

as tbs court, held# the Interstate Commerce Act# and not the

That's ~~ if I may just call your

attention# Mr, Justice Stewart# to 49 USC Section 511# which
exempts the carriers and the employees from the operation of the
Railway Labor Act.
Q

So it would be m illegal strike and could b©

enjoined?
MR. MURRAY;

As it was done in the Northwestern case.

They threatened to strike.

If I may t:-k& just a moment to give Mr» Justice

of the confusion ware the employees.

It. could very well have

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN M. LUCENTE, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LUCENTE %

If the Court please, just with reference

to this last case that Mr. Murray cite®, the holding of the
court in that case is that the arbitration provisions govern
that the employees war® required to arbitrate and could not
maintain a judicial action for the purpose of securing an
interpretation.

It was not the provisions of the Interstate

Commerce Act that asm into play in that decision, but the
fact that arbitration appeared in the underlying document.
That of course is characteristic of the agreement which the'
employees make, also.
I believe that's all I havs,
• 1:1» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1*55 p.ra,, the case was submitted.]
