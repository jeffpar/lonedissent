MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next in Ho. 70-2* United States against 12 Reels of Film.
Mr. Solicitor General,, you may proceed whenever you’re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GRISWOLD;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I’hrs case comes here on appeal from the Central
Dintrice Couru or California, which held unconstitutional an
Act of Congress providing for the forfeiture of obscena
material imported into the United States.
Tha present case, and the one which follows,are
sc-rue Is to the decisions of the Court last term, in United
b® &

y»

Reidel, and united_States against 37 Photograph3.

Those cases involved transmission through the mails and
.importation o?: obscene materials for commercial purposes.
The distinctive feature of this case is that the
importation here is alleged to ba for private use.
Tra present proceeding is an in-line proceeding
against a number of items which were imported by the claimant,
some of those have been returned to the claimant as not
obscene,» the others are on file at the Court.
1 believe it can be. said that if anything is obscene,

4
these items are.

And particularly the printed material.

These, in my view, are not borderline materials
If the Court is disposed to hold that there is nothing that can
be held to be obscena under the Constitution, that will
dispose of this case.

But if obscenity still has any

constitutional meaning, than I believe that these materials
would have to be found to be obscene by any standard which has
ever been suggested by the Court.
When the complaint for forfeiture came on to be heard,
the District Court granted a motion to dismiss, relying on the
prior decision of the same court in the 37 Photographs case,
the one which was reversed last term.
At that time the claimant filed an affidavit stating
that the items were not, and I quote, "were not imported by me
for any commercial purpose but were intended to be used and
possessed by me personally.'*
And in response, the United States Attorney filed a
motion for a stay of the order of dismissal, in which he
stated that the United States had, and again I quote, "noevidence'with which to contradict Mr. Paladini*s affidavit
and therefore does not contest the fact that this was a private
importation.Ei
There are at least two lines of reasoning on which
the government’s case may be rested.

In the first place, if

these materials are obscene, as I have contended, or if they

s
must be regarded as obscene, since the court below has granted
a motion to dismiss without determining the question of .
obscenity, then the materials are not entitled to the protection
of the First Amendment, and that would seem to dispose of the
matter, since no Fourth Amendment question is involved.
Nearly 15 years ago in Roth this Court decided that
obscenity is not. within the area of constitutionally protected
speech or press.
There is nothing in this Court8s subsequent decisions
to indicate that this is not still the law.

Quite the contrary.

In Stanley v. Georgia, which is the basis of the decision of
the court below, this Court said Roth and the cases following
that decision are not impaired by today’s holding.

That was

in 1969.
And last term, in Re id el, the Court; quoted the
language from Roth and said, Roth has not been overruled, it
remains the law in this Court and governs this case.
And in 37 Photographs, decided the same day, Mr.
Justice White, speaking for four members of the Court,
reiterated the statement that obscenity is not within the
scope of First Amendment protection.
If this material is obscene by any standard, at I
have contended, and if obscenity is not protected by the
First Amendment, then it would seem to follow that there is no
eonstitutional basis

G

May I ask, Mr. Solicitor General:

X didn’t find

that there’s any disagreement that these materials are obscene.
Two things were returned, as I understand it; one a sealed
film, and something else.

But X thought there was no disagree­

ment with your submission —
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

-— that the real question —* yes.

MR. GRISWOLD:
obscene.

X think that is correct.

I am simply saying that they are

But —
Q

But I thought the real question here was

whether the fact that they brought in, assuming obscenity,
for personal use rather than commercial use?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

That is the question

but I don't think that question can be escaped by examining the
material and saying it is not obscene; and that is the —
for example, if it were blank pieces of paper, this is not a
feigned issue, this is a real case.
Q

Well, speaking for myself, I had .not thought,

in preparing for this argument, that, as X have felt X had to
in other cases, that I had to examine the material; because I
didn't think any issue of obscenity was contested here.
MR. GRISWOLD:

I think that is accurate, Mr. Justice,

except that X think that these materials are obscene.
G

Well, I don’t have to look at them, do 1?

MR. GRISWOLD:

Not if you assume that they are

obscene»
Q

Well, no one seems to contest it.

MR. GRISWOLDs
relevant in the case.

Or if you say that obscenity is not
It seems to me that it should not be

disposed of on the ground that obscenity has not been
established.
Another approach leads to the same result.

Stanley

v. Georgia held that obscene material seized in a man’s
library in his home, under a search warrant authorizing a
search for evidence of gambling materials, could not be made
the basis of a criminal prosecution for possessing the obscene
item.
I find no basis for objecting to the result, though,

,

as 1 contended last week in Councilman, v. Hitchcock

some of

the language used may have been unnecessarily broad.
As was pointed out by the three concurring Justices
in that case, the decision is perhaps best rested on the
Fourth Amendment as an illegal search, net adequately
supported by the warrant which the officers had obtained.
But on thee basis it is not a First Amendment case,
and has no application here.
This is borne out by the Court's decisions in the
Reidel and 37 Photographs cases.

The Reids1 decision held that

the rationale of Stanley was not sufficient to bar a prosecu­
tion of a person who, on a commercial basis, mailed obscene

8
material to a recipient at his home.

Though Stanley had referred

to the right to receive information and ideas, this right to
receive was not sufficient to allow the recipient to obtain
obscene material through the mails from a'commercial mailer,
as against the right of the United States constitutionally to
forbid its passage through the mails.
And in 37 Photographs, this conclusion was reached
with respect to obscene material, a single set of 37 photo­
graphs, which an individual had acquired abroad and sought to
bring into the United States through customs, with a view to
using them in a commercial publication.
As indicated by my response to Mr. Justice Brennan5s
question, the sole difference between this case and 37
?rotographs is that hare the importation is alleged to be for
the personal use of the importer.

And we have no evidence to

the contrary.
In view of Raids!, however, that would seem to be a
distinction without a difference.

If a person cannot have

things mailed to him without causing the mailer to commit a
crime, it is rather hard to see that he should be able to
bring things into the country himself, as against the broad
and sweeping powers of Congress to regulate foreign commerce
and the traditional comprehensiva power of this and all other
nations over all materials entering the country at the
borders.

This was the view of the four Justices constituting
the plurality in 37 Photographs.

They said, in 3? Photographs,

the trial court erred in reading Stanley as immunizing from
seizure obscene materials possessed at a port of entry for
the purpose of importation for private use.
And then, obscene materials may be removed from the
channels of commerce when discovered in the luggage of a
returning foreign traveler, even though intended solely for
his private use.
And, finally, a port of entry is not a traveler’s
heme v
As X have contended, the First Amendment does not
apply, since the material is obscene or must be taken as
obscene, and it is no less obscene because it is importsd for
private use.
The Court would not hold, I suppose, that a person
could lawfully bring in narcotics or a hand grenade on the
ground that he was going to use the narcotics or the hand
grenade personally.
1 know of no basis on which it can be determined,

either under the First Amendment or otherwise, that personal
use provides some sort of a protection against otherwise
applicable laws.
Kor, X suppose, would the Court hold that as parson
can import a foreign printed book which violates an American

10
copyright, on the ground that he is going to use; the book
himself.
I well remember the ~(Toutenuge?)- editions of
American books, which we used to buy in Europe a generation ago,
and their clear statement that they could not be imported into
the United States under the copyright laws.

X read "A Farewell

to Arms'5 in a Toutenage edition, and took care to have it
finished before X came horn®.
Perhaps this was unnecessary, if the decision below
is sound, but X did not think so then.
Q

Of course that was a little before Stanley was

decided, wasn’t it?
[Laughter.3
MR. GRISWOLD? That was before Stanley was decided,
but it was the same Constitution, Mr. Justice, arte the same
First Amendment.
Congress has sweeping power at our borders, though
its power •— through its peer to regulate foreign commerce.
Not power, of course, to violate the Constitution but power
under the Constitution to regulate foreign commerce in terms
which are not qualified by the Constitutional provision itself.
I can find nothing ..in the terms of the First Amendment
which limits the power of Congress to bar the importation of
obscene materials., even when they are intended for private use.
If, can be done, X suggest, only by erecting a very substantial

11
penumbra around the First Amendment, extending quite fare beyond
its terms and beyond the privacy of the home or the person
which were involved in the Stanley case and in Griswold v«
Connecticut.
Such an extension is not warranted by any constitu­
tional precedent or standard that I know of.

If it were done,

it is hard to tell how the limits of the penumbra could be
determined.
it should be.

It would be, I suppose, whatever this Court thinks
Of course constitutional provisions cannot

always be interpreted literally.

But finding support in the

First Amendment for the result reached by the court below
would carry the Court farther away from the constitutional
language, I submit, than the Court ought to go..

And farther

away from the language than is required or authorized by any
prior decision of the Court.
Finally, let me suggest that any construction that
materials can ba imported for personal use against the rule of
Congress, though not for commercial purposes, is not only
unsupported by anything in the Constitution, but is too
illusory and gossamer a distinction to be erected into
constitutional terms.
How is the fact of personal use to be determined?
Is the importer's statement to be conclusive, either legally
or as a practical matter?
assertion on him?

How binding is the claimant's

How long must the intention last?

Now, what

12
happens when it changes?

How, in the ordinary cate,, can the

government counter the assertion of the importer, that his
importation is for private purposes?
Of course, if he brings in a bale of duplicate
copies, it will look like a commercial importation»
sophisticated will not do that.

But the

With the ready availability

of duplicating machinery these days* a single copy suffices to
make possible wide-scale distribution.
How can the government, as a practical matter, police
this?

What happens if the importer for private use dies?

goes bankrupt?

Or

Can his trustee in bankruptcy sell the

material along with the rest of the bankrupt's valuable
library, on the ground that it was lawfully imported?

Indeed,

constitutionally imported for private use? and if not, why not?
Suppose the importer for private use tires of the
material? Can he give it to a friend?

Or perhaps sell it for «

good price, after a decent interval has elapsed since the
importation?
e

If not, again why not?
Well, I think the "why not" is Reidel, isnb

Reidel v. United States.
MR. GRISWOLD;
Q

it not?

It covered — ?

The seller, the seller of such material.

MR. GRISWOLD;
. Q

That covers the seller, doesn't it?

Yes.

That's squarely covered by the Reidel case, is

13
MR. GRISWOLD:
through the mails.

The Reidel case is to transportation

There is nothing in the Reidel case that

has anything to do with a simple sale or hand delivery.
Q

I didn’t know you. thought it was such a narrow

decision„
MR. GRISWOLD: Well, Reidel involved a prosecution
under a statute which makes it a crime to transmit through the
mails, and as far as I know that’s the only thing that was
there decided.

I don’t know of any federal basis for juris­

diction with respect to a simple transfer between man and man,
of obscene or other material wholly within a State, not
involving interstate commerce or the use of the mails.
Q

Well, the Federal Government has no legitimate -

MR. GRISWOLD:

This, I think, is exactly my point,

that once this material is admitted on the ground that it is for
private use, there is no way that I know of by which that can
bo controlled, or a change in the importer for private use
deciding he’s tired of it and would like to sell it, indeed, or
give it away.
•Q

Except possibly by State law?

MR. GRISWOLD: There might foe under State law, but the
Federal Government would have to rely on State law, and I
suggest that a restriction on such a sale couldn't be found
in the First Amendment# and I don't know where else it would be
found

14
Are we not reading too much into the First Amendment,
when we get into this area at all?

Is it not sounder to say

that the First Amendment has nothing to do with this case,
since, as this Court has said, and reaffirmed not long ago,,
obscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected
speech or press.
The judgment below should be reversed,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General.
Mr. Kuchel.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. KUCHEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. KUCHEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Appearing as a friend of the Court, we would urge that
the statute.in this case is unconstitutional because of overbreadth, because it would seek to deprive one Paladin!, the
cifcisen whose luggage was inspected on his way back to this
country, of the right to receive information and ideas and to
his private possession of that information.
In Stanley vs. Georgia, the Court recognised two
fundamental liberties encompassed within, the First Amendment.
It recognised the right to receive information and ideas
regardless of their social worth, and it recognised the right
of privacy from unwanted government intrusion to films or books

for personal use»
Mr, Chief Justice, whether or not materials
possessed for private use are obscene is completely irrelevant
to the recognition of the fundamental liberties described in
Stanley vs. Georgia,

And 1 quote two sentences from Reidels

"The. personal constitutional rights of those like
Stanley", said this Court, "to possess and read obscenity in
their homes and their freedom of mind and thought do not depend
on whether the materials are obscene or whether obscenity is
constitutionally protected.

Their rights to have and to view

that material in private are independently saved by the
Constitution."

End of quotation.

The right to have —
Q

What about the quotation in 37 Photos?

On page

376, which says Stanley doesn't apply to a search at the
border. Period.

Right?

MR. KUCHELs

There is that language in 37 Photos.

1 would most respectfully urge that —
Q

It sayss "Stanley's emphasis was on the freedom

of thought and mind in the privacy of the home? but a port of
entry is not a traveler's home." Period.

End of quote.

Doesn't that take care of this case?
MR. KUCHEL:

No, sir? it does not.

Q

In the first p3ace,

Q

Only .

for

four people.

16
MR. KUCHEL:
Q

Sir?

That was only for four people *

MR. KUCHELs

Mr. Justice, 1 do want most respectfully

to comment on that particular language in the —
Q

But it was only for four Justices.

MR. KUCHEL;

Yes, sir; but I would not argue from

that’point of view.
Q

Senator, may 1 — getting back to my colloquy

with the Solicitor General, X am right, am I not, that we may
decide this case on the premise that the materials here
involved, by any definition, are obscene?
MR. KUCHEL:

You are.

Yes, Mr. Justice.

The right to have and to view materials in privacy
can be meaningful at all only if all places of privacy are
given equal dignity.

Materials can be possessed privately

outside the home, such as in one's office, something which the
appellant's brief, incidentally, recognizes; in one’s luggage
or in one’s clothing.
If Stanley had a right to possess for private use,
obscenity in his home, surely it would be a rather narrow
constitutional right if, as he stepped off the steps leading
to hi a home, with whatever he had in his. pocket, that at that
point, the protection of the First Amendment would evaporate.
It would be illogical and destructive of privacy to permit
intrusion into the freedom of mind and thought in private places

other than the home.

And it could lead to an absurd result,

that a man could be prosecuted for private possession of
materials when he left his home possessing books on his person
on his way to his office, or to take up another residence, or
to retire to the privacy of a mountain cabin.
The law recognizes that privacy is not restricted to
one's home,

This Court has said that, the law protects people,

and not places.
Stanley vs.' Georgia clearly does not derive its
vitality from the fact that Stanley's home was involved»

The

home is not a searchproof haven for possession of illegal
materials? to the contrary, in Stanley itself a valid search
warrant took both local officers and federal officers into
Stanley's home.

But this Court vindicated Stanley's right

to keep certain articles, and there can be no difference
between the kind of inspection under the Fourth Amendment in
Stanley than the customs inspection which took place with
respect to the luggage of Paladin! as he returned to this
country..
If Stanley had a right of privacy, if he had a right
regardless of the type of materials which he had, to possess
in.his home, should he not have a right to bring similar
materials into this country?

And is it not irrelevant that

£i customs inspection took place?
country.

As he arrived back in this

,18
Q

Senator Kuchel, let me ask you this;

Let's

assume for the, moment that we accept that proposition, that the
right of privacy which attaches to Stanley in his home follows
him wherever he takes that material; that is, if he takes it to
his office, or, as you have said, to his summer place or out in
the park, as long as he's not bothering anyone else with it,
does that necessarily — does it necessarily follow that that
right of privacy attends the bringing into the United States,
at the borders, having in mind the broad powers of government
to deal with importation? or do you not have to carry it one
step beyond?

That’s really what I’m. after,

MR. KUCHEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, 1 would urge — no.

I would urge that Congress hap under the Constitution a broad
power with respect to post officers and post roads.

I would

urge that Congress has a broad power with respect to regulation
of commerce»
But this Court, in determining the power of Congress
in those fields,

must take into consideration the liberties

guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, arid particularly, with
respect to this case, the First Amendment.

That is what makes

a book or a film, Mr. Chief Justice, I most respectfully say,
different from narcotics or a still.

The government of the

United States can obtain the right to search a home in order to
determine whether or not narcotics are possessed by the
individual who lives there and seize them.

19
The difference which makes the film or the print
or the book a greatly different problem is because of the First
Amendment guarantees„
Q

Senator, I take it the Solicitor General's

argument is that since all concede that the material , here was
obscene, and since Roth nays obscenity is not protected by the
First Amendment, that therefore the fact this may have been in
form of book doesn't really make it any different from
narcotics.
What is your response to that line of argument?
MR. KUCHELs

My response would be that this Court,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in Stanley, particularly determined that
Stanley was entitled to possess obscenity in his home for
private use.

That is the decision of this Court.

It was a

First Amendment decision.
I respectfully disagree with the Solicitor General.
It was on the basis of the First and the Fourteenth Amendments
that this Court's opinion was written.
My argument wuld foe that if there is a right under
Stanley for a person to have a right, of privacy in his home to
obscenity, that right does not rest upon the fact that it is
in his home but chat it is protected by the First Amendment.
Q

And 1 suppose, Senator, — or may I ask:

Would

that be your answer also, you know, under the Fourth Amendment,
I think, there have been decisions, largely I guess of Courts

20
of Appeals, certainly in the Ninth Circuit, that for Fourth
Amendment purposes border searches allow more latitude than
would searches elsewhere, particularly searches in the home?
Would your answer be the same, this gets to the colloquy you
were having with the Chief Justice —
MR. KUCHEL;
q

Yes.

-*» you don't make a distinction between border

and other inspections, in light of the greater latitude

that

usually attends under the Fourth Amendment border search?
MR. KUCHELi

Ho, Mr. Justice, it seems to rae that

the customs inspector was performing a function with which he
was clothed by law.

He had a responsibility to make that

search in a reasonable fashion, but the fact that he made that
search should, not interfere with Palad.ini * s right to possess
for private purposes the films that are involved in this case.
What is the difference between Stenaley's right —
Q

Well, what 1 was trying to get to is, X gather

you're saying that Stanley rests the privacy aspect more on
the First Amendment than it does on the Fourth?
MR. KUCHEL:
Q

Yes, sir; yes, Mr. Justice.

So that would be your answer to why there's no

difference that it's a border search or border inspection than
in. a seairue in the home; is that right?
MR. KUCHEL;
Q

Yes, sir.

Stanley's home and the things in it certainly

21
could have been entered and searched by — and were, under a
search warrant.
MR. KUCHEL:
Q

Precisely.

There may have been more rigid standards under

the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments than a border search under
the Fourth Amendment, but in each, it was searchable under the
proper Fourth Amendment standards.

But that did not deter the

Court from saying that he absolutely could not be prosecuted
or convicted substantively because of the First and Fourteenth
Amendments.

Is that your point?

MR. KUCHEL;
Q
seizure

It is, precisely, Mr. Justice Stewart.

I suppose, then, separating the search from the

what you9re really saying is that you don't want to

inhibit their right to search, which is for broad prophylactic
purposes, narcotics, guns, hand grenades? but that what they
find in that search -then falls undor the ban of Stanley
MR. KUCHEL:

That is correct, Mr. Justice, because,

if I read Stanley correctly, it was because of First Amendment
rights that prevented the seizure of the items in the — in
Stanley.
Q

Wasn't Stanley more narrowly a privacy than a

broad First Amendment base?
MR. KUCHEL;
Q

I do not understand, I --

That Stanley was based on the right of privacy

narrowly, rather than upon broad First Amendment rights with

22

respect to materials, publications, and that sort of thing.
MR. KUCHBL:

Mr. Justice, I thought that Stanley

determined that there was a right to receive and a right to
possess, sc long as those rights were exercised in private,
so long as there was no indication of a public distribution,
whether it be commercial or not, I think; so long as those
rights were exercised by the individual himself in private,
that he was protected.

And I read that as an interpretation

of rights accruing to the citizen under the First Amendment.
1 think it also fair to say that Stanley put to rest
any notion that the difficulties in prosecution of commercial
distribution is the reason for denying First Amendment
freedom of individitals to receive information and to be free
from government intrusion.
Q

Senator, what about Reidel, would you say Stanley

— how much of Stanley — what part of your argument about
Stanley can survive Reidel?
MR. KUCHEL:

1 would argue that Reidol represented

a case involving public distribution, commercial distribution,
and
Q

Wall, what about —* let me give you a case;

Suppose a book store owner is charged with selling an obscene
item to a certain customer, and he responds, "Well, it’s sold
for his private use in his home.''

And the government concedes

that that’s quite true, but, nevertheless, says that this was

23
a commercialisation of obscenity, and Keldei permits prosecution
for that?
MR. KUCHEL:

Do wo assume that the book is obscene

under -Q

Oh, yes.

MR. KUCHEL:
Q

Oh, yes.

MR. KUCHEL:
distribution.
Q

— that first definition?

Then it is a sale.

Then it is a public

And that is something entirely different.
So you would say Stanley would permit, even under

your position Stanley would permit prosecutions for selling to
a parson for his private use in his home?
MR. KUCHELs
C

That --

If doesn't bother you at all?

MR. KUCHEL:

1 would, but that is not — that is

not this case.
Q

Not this case.

But what is it *— do you think

your position is inconsistent with that?
MR. KUCHEL:

Not at all.

Not at all.

I think that

I think that your and my rights of privacy, under the First
Amendment, have got to be considered in every question that
comes —
Q

So you would say that you have the right to

possess obscene material in your home, but you have no right
to buy it?

24
In the sense that you donst have — at least you don’t
have such a right to buy it that your seller is immune?
MR. KUCHEL:

You’ve never had a purchaser before this

Court in a lawsuit.
Q

Well, you’ve had sellers, though, and —

MR. KUCHEL:
Q

Indeed you have,,

— so you would say the seller, even if the

purchaser has the right to have it, even if the man has a 'right
to have it in his own home, a seller doesn’t necessarily or
just doesn’t have the right to sell obscene material to him?
MR. KUCHEL:
j

Mr. Justice White, I believe that Roth
*

and Reidel may stand alongside of Stanley and alongside of
the judgment in the District Court in this case.

And I most

respectfully say to you that with respect to Reidel there, I
do not quarrel with the decision in that case? but I do quarrel
with the language which then went on in that case and indicated
that even for private use a parson would be guilty of

What you’re saying, I take it, is that the

individual in Stanley’s posture may go somewhere and buy, or
go abroad and bring it back, and it is protected by the
privacy in the home under Stanley, even though the seller from

whom he acquired it in the United States, if he bought it here,
might be prosecuted for the sale?
MR. KUCHELs

Yes.

I would not urge any rights of the

seller of obscenity in this country.

And there is — the

question of where the material which Paladini in the case at
bar acquired is unanswered.

Presumably he purchased it abroad,

and flew back info this country with it in his luggage.
But I do not believe it is necessary, in order to
vindicate First Amendment rights of privacy, to protect the
seller of obscenity.
Q

Tell: me, Senator, we8ve had a number of cases

that recognise the time and location limitations on the
exercise of First Amendment rights? for example, that someone
couldn't get up here and make a speech in the middle of your
argument from the audience.

Isn’t there something of that

.involved here, a distinction between the home and the exercise
of the right, as you describe it, at the border?
MR. KUCHELs
Q

1" do not believe so.

I believe that ~~

How do you distinguish those cases in which we

have said there are those limitations on the exercise of
First Amendment rights?
MR. KUCHELs
Q

Would you repeat that, Mr. Justice?

X say, how do you distinguish from this

situation those cases in which we have said there are those
limitations on the exercise of First Amendment rights?

28
On time and location, like you couldn't make a. speech in this
courtroom?
MR. KUCHELs

Simply because you are applying a rule

of reason to the rights of free speech, and I think when you
curtailed certain outbursts, it isn't because —
Q

Well, I’m thinking of the speech that certainly

the First Amendment might protect if delivered out on the steps,
but not if it were delivered in this courtroom.
Q

All of those cases, Senator, involve, do they

not, interference with the rights of others, personal or
private?

That is. the use of the streets by the citiasnry, or

the use of a courthouse, as in the Cot case, and go on.
MR. KUCHELs
Q

Yes.

Quite different from this case?

Mi. KUCHELs

Yes.

I misunderstood.

The Solicitor General asked how could a. customs
inspector counter the traveler's claim.,

1 would say that that

is not a basis, a question on which this Court should deny
Paladini his First Amendment rights of privacy.

There are

statutory procedures under which a federal employee, working
in customs, ’may ask questions, may make a determination on his
own as to what the intent may be by which a person brings items
of personal property back into this country? and Stanley
itself went on to says

we are faced with the argument that

prohibition of possession of obscene materials is a necessary

21
incident to statutory schemes prohibiting distribution.
That argument is based on alleged difficulties of
proving an intent to distribute or introducing evidence of
actual distribution.

We are not convinced that such difficulties

exist.
But even if they did, we do not think that they would
justify infringement of the individual's right to read or
observe what he pleases.

Because that right is so fundamental

to our scheme of individual liberty, its restriction may not
be justified by the need to ease the administration of otherwise
valid federal laws.
To sum up, there is no question raised here about
obscenity.

This is a question of the private possession of

obscenity for private use.
We would urge this Court to recognise that a citizen
under this Constitution ought to have a right, in private, to
read and to possess what he pleases. And we would urge that
that right would be unnecessarily and unreasonably constrictae;
if it were made to apply only to his horns.

That right against

governmental thought control ought to follow him when he leaves
his home with whatever kind of material, political or other,
cp.cl goes to his office? and it ought also to accompany him when
he returns from a trip overseas.
Therefore we would
Q

Let me aslc you one question.

To pursue i point

28
that the Solicitor General was making, I think he made the poin
of the difficulty of tracking this type of material ones it
got into the country*
Now, under your submission in this case, suppose two
weeks after he got it safely at home, under your theory that it
was protected to bring it back, he then made 100,000 copies
and began to sail them.

Then, under noth and the other cases,

1 suppose your position would be that the State or the
■federal government -— well, the State can deal with him at
that stage by prosecuting him, if they have an appropriate
statute?
MR, KUCHELs

1 would, indeed,

I think he falsified

his position when he returned to this country®

And he should

not be covered®
There is a statute, 1 believe, in the State of New
York which finds that if there are more than half a dozen
copies of something that an individual has, that is evidence
of the intention of he who possesses it to sell.

There are

many ways that you might creditably judge the intent with which
•a person returns to this country with a book that he may have
purchased abroad.

But, surely, the difficulties involved in

the enforcement of..the law ought not to be used as a basis to
punish the rights of the First Amendment.
• Just one more-sentence and 1 am through®

There

could be a chilling effect, Mr. Chief Justice and the Court

/I

please,

on an American citiaen going abroad.

If he wanted to

buy a book to read and yet wondered whether he would be
subjected to scorn when he returned to this country, because it
might be a borderline case that someone in the government would
determine was obscene, and therefore it would have a chilling
effect on the traveling American,
All in all, we would most respectfully urge that the
judgment of the District Court be affirmed.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Solicitor General, do you have anything further?
Senator Kuchel, before you leave, you appeared in
this case under unusual circumstances, and at our request.
On behalf of the Court, we want to thank you for your assistant”
to us and of course the assistance to the — your unknown
client whom you represented here.
MS. KUCHEL;

Thank you.

Thank you, sir,

I?m honored to be

here.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

The case

is submitted.

[Whereupon, at .11:44 o'clock, a.s., the case was
submitted. 1
