MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERt

We'll hear arguments next

in No. 71-300, Andrews against Louisville 6 Nashville Railroad
Company and others.
Mr. Estes, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW W. ESTES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ESTES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
I represent Thomas L. Andrews, who used to be a
railroad man.
One day Mr. Andrews had an automobile accident,
having nothing to do with his employment, where he was injured
necessitating a medical furlough- which he was duly given.
In due time he regained his health and attempted to return to
work.

Whan he got back and tried to go to work, he found that

he was still on medical furlough and even with a doctor’s
certificate he was not permitted to work, and of course was
not paid either.
The Railroad, of course, in its defensive pleadings,
contended that he was neither fish nor fowl, that he was not
employed and he was not discharged.
Mr. Andrews, in his complaint, originally in the
State court and then removed to Federal District Court,
contends that these acts and other acts amount to a common-law

4
wrongful discharge, which the State of Georgia recognizes as a
common-law action.
What we have today really is a jurisdictional question,
to determine whether or not courts have jurisdiction over a
common~law wrongful discharge action arising out of a discharge
of a union railroad employee? or whether the employee must —
and I use! the term '’exhaust" loosely for the moment

exhaust

his administrative remedies.
I think I can say there that we no longer have an
exhaustion of administrativa remedies, rather, it amounts to
an ©lection of administrative remedies.
The Court has undoubtedly noticed how brief the
petitioner's brief is, because we have a very simple contention.
We rely primarily, almost solely, on the Moore v.
Illinois Central Railway Company, decided by this Court in 1940„
The rationale in that case, of course, was that a railroad
union employee could elect either to pursue his administrative
remedies or could sue in a court of law for a common-law
wrongful discharge.

But we rely squarely on that case.

Mr.

Moero was fired by the Illinois Central Railroad because he
had the audacity to sue them on an FELA case.
Q

Does he want reinstatement or what?

MR. ESTES;

No, Your Honor, he does not; he wants

to sue them for damages.
The Board could, if he made his election — and I

don't call that exhaustion

but if he made his election, the

Board could reinstate him, grant him back pay, and give him his
job.

He doesn't want that, he wants to sue for damages.
This Court has said, by the way, on numerous occasion

and X will quote from the Slocum cases

"A common law or

statutory action for wrongful discharge differs froj^ any
remedy the Board has power to provide, and does not involve
questions of future relations between the railroad and other
employees,"
Of course this general philosophy was stated very
well by Mr. Justice Black in the Arguelies case, which 1 have
cited not, by the way, as authority for this case but because
of the language in that that. X “d like to get to in a minute.
0

If it's taken, what would be the measure of

damages in the lawsuit?
MR. ESTES;
Mr. Justice Brennan.

I think there would be several things,
One, of course, would be the difference

between wages that he would have made with the railroad and
wages he has in tbs past, also prospectively, which -Q

That's right, Your Honor, under a common-

Now, —
So that before the Board, I gather, the Board

could award back pay, finding a wrongful discharge?

s
MR. ESTES:
Q

But nothing in excess of back pay; is that it?

MR. ESTES s'
Q

Yes.

That's right.

Whereas you’re asking damages which would be

more than just back pay?
MR. ESTES:

That's right.

It would be prospective

as well.
Q

Yes.

MR. ESTES:

Although I believe, in rare instances,

the Board can -— I believe this now -- can award attorney’s
fees.
Q

Has it done this?

MR. ESTES s
Q

I think in rare instances it has.

For attorney’s fees, but not

MR.

ESTES: That's true,

Mr.Justice

Brennan.

Yes.
ESTES: Plus reinstatement,

he'd ba working back

with the railroad.
Q

Yes.

But in your lawsuit you’d be asking for

damages — well, would you specify them again?
MR. ESTES:

Well, general damages being — the measure

of damages, of course you’d look to the contract, to see what
his wages would have been had he been employed and what wages
he has earned, the difference being the measure of damages.

That would be retrospective.

And then prospective, os: course,

would be a jury question, to determine what his future damages
might be.
Q

Well, do you think that lie could recover

prospectively the difference between what he's making in
another job and what he would have made with the railroad?
MR. ESTES:

Mr. Justice. White. I certainly do.

1

believe —Q

Even if the railroad said to him, Please come

3:>ack, we'll reinstate you?
MR. ESTES:

Yes, sir, Mr. Justice White, X believe

that could be dons.
Q

You mean he has a choice of not working for the

railroad but, nevertheless, collecting from them?
MR. ESTES:

Georgia recognizes constructive

service, where a man makes himself available for work?under
his employment contract he can remain available and say, ”1'rn
ready to work, and you have to pay me."
Now, of course, if there had been
Q

Well, X know, but the railroad says, "We'll

fca glad to put you back to work", and he says, "No, X want to
keep the other job, but I want you to pay me the difference
between my lower wages on the other job.55
MR. ESTES:

That's a difficult question.

It's decided by Georgia law

I’m not sure that this is a breach of
There’s some question about that.

The Georgia courts have had numerous, numerous cases on wrongful
discharge.

Thera has never been a holding that this is a

matter in breach of contract.
Assuming that would for the moment? that's what Mr.
Moore sued for, breach of contract.

MS. ESTES:

Yes, Mr. Justice White, he does.

MR. ESTES:

Yes, Mr. Justice White, it does.

But, nonetheless, I'm not sure that that makes it

Q

Well, whether it is or not, what’s the governing

law for whether or not you’ve been wrongfully discharged under

MR. ESTES;

I think whether or not there was

Q

There have been a lot of these discharge cases*

haven't there?
MR. ESTES; Wall* yes* Your Honor. There's one ease
that's very critical* in fact there are two cases I'd like to
discuss in this connection. The first is Union Pacific Railroad
Company va_. Price* I'll call that the Price case —
Q

Is that the one I wrote?

MR. ESTES;

I believe so.

This is the case that

really destroys your exhaustion of remedies and makes it an
election of remedies, because here Mr. Price was fired, X think
ha also sued the railroad undor an FELA action.
him because of it.

They fired

He pursued his administrative remedy.

The

Adjustment Board found that he had been properly discharged;
so he said* "Okay* I*ve exhausted my administrative remedies*
I'll go to my court” — and of course the holding in this
Court in that case was that you can't relitigate the same
issues.

u
So we can forget about exhaustion of administrative
remedies, and I think we should, from now on, be discussing
election of remedies.

No case has really undermined the Moore

decision, as the railroad contends, even the case of Walker ypu
Southern Railway.■

That’s a real bugaboo of a case,

unfortunately, because it's had some rule misapplications.
To start with, it’s not a wrongful discharge type case, to
begin with, and should not fit within the particular Meore
exclusion and should not be applied to it.
What it really was was a computation of time case.
Mr. Roy Walker also took sick leave.
notice that he was ill.

Ke gave the railroad

The railroad contended that he had

given it too late, within the 30 days required by the
contract.

Roy Walker contended he had given it in time.

The question, really, there was not wrongful discharge, it
was a case of whether h@ had given this notice in time or
not.

So it’s a time computation case.
And this is —
Q

You called this an election of remedies case?

MR. ESTESt

1 think it is now because of the Price

case, Mr. Chief Justice.
i

Q

tod being an election of remedies case, do you

still contend that you can collect damages for future unemploy­
ment if the railroad tenders the employment to him, as Mr.
Justice Whits suggested?

i, ^

MS. ESTfiS:
Q

X think that's —

Since he elected.

MR. ESTESs

1 think that’s a question to be determined

by Georgia law and by a jury, Your Honor.
I agree that —
Q

By a jury?

MR. ESTES:

Or is that a legal question?

It may be a mixed question of law and

fact, depending on whether or not the offer is believable.
For instance, Mr. Andrews in this case may very well, and 1
will say he probably will, on the trial of the case show by
evidence that

' his wrongful discharge was occasioned by

things other than his illness, and that the illness was a mere
charade, a mare sham, and that.there are other reasons the
railroad wants to dump him, and that the offer is not a real,
genuine or bona fide offer, but is a way to mitigate damages.
Much as is the attack in an. FELA case, where the
railroad argues to the jury:

Well, he’s going to have this

wonderful job, higher earnings and whatnot.

They return a low

verdict, and then he gets fired.
So 1 think it may be a mixed question of law and
fact, and X think it. could, be properly submitted to a jury and
predicated on State law.
Q

t suppose the questions we’ve put to you

address issues really not before us in this case; is that
right?

*

13
MR. ESTES:

No, Mr. Justice Brennan.

As a natter

of fact, I think these are key questions because of the
collateral cases surrounding the original Moore decision, that
have confused the situation so badly.
As 1 first stated, —
Q

Yes, but if we were to overrule Moore —

MR. ESTES:
Q

If you would overrule Moore

—

— and that line of cases, that would mean you

would have to go to the Adjustment Board, isn't that right?
MR. ESTES:

Not only would Mr. Andrews have to go

to the Adjustment Board, Mr. Justice Brennan, you would forever
slam the courthouse door on any other claimants of this
nature.
Q

Well, as 1 recall it, the dissenters in Walker

thought we should follow that question.
MR, ESTES:

Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan, that was true

with several notable exceptions.

Of course the foundation of

the Roy Walker case, it's our contention, is not really well
laid.

1 think, as Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice White

pointed out, you can't really make a jurisdictional determina­
tion on how well or fully some Railroad Adjustment Board is
doing.
It would be patently discriminatory.

What if some

poor fellow up in New York, who has brought his, and they are
way behind because they have a lot of claims; so —

Q

Incidentally, what

MR. ESTESs

— so he gets to sue the guy in Southern

California, where they don’t have many claims, where he has
to go through the Board.
Q

Well, what is -- as I remember, didn’t you say

something in Walker, sometimes it takes ten years to get
through the Adjustment Board?

MR. ESTESs

Well, even less? say four years.

And

in some places one and a half years.
Now, they vary. But of course you can’t have a
variable jurisdiction throughout the country, depending on
how the Board’s doing.
Besides that, what if the Board slows down for five
years now?
through?

Ara they going to let some more Roy Walkers slip
Well, 1 think they couldn’t very well do that, either.

That would fee discriminatory.
It really shouldn't be predicated, though, on how
well the Board is doing.
Q

It’s a matter of jurisdiction,

Now, Mr. Estes, under tha amended statute, unlike

IS
the situation at the time Price was decided, isn't there now
a judicial review of — both ways.

At the time Price was

decided, we said there was judicial review under the then
statutory scheme for the railroad but not for the employee, of
an Adjustment Board decision? isn’t that right?
MR. ESTES: That's right, Your Honor.
Q

But now. under the new statute, there is

judicial review7, isn’t there, both the employee as wall as the
railroad may have it?
MR. ESTES;

Well, may it please the Court, I would

talcs the position that your judicial review is not a review
de novo.

X may be mistaken, but X think that the findings of

fact of the Board would outlaw the case.
Q

But what we said in Price was that there was no

judicial review at all.
MR. ESTES:
Q

Well -»

On the part of — available to the employee.

MR. ESTES:

Perhaps you did, Mr. Justice Brennan,

but it was my —
Q

But now there is some, at least, whatever it

may be.
MR. ESTES:

would not be permitted to relitigate issues already determined,

a factual finding*
There’s another interesting thing about the 1966

amendments, which I respectfully submit were totally overlooked
by the Court in the Roy Walker case; which is that the 1966
amendments should be a clear designation of legislative intent
in this regard.

That is to say, sweeping changes were made,

and some real positive things were done by the Legislature to
speed up the remedies, and also to balance it out a little
bit, too, X think.
But in all of the committee reports and in all of the
legislative committee meetings, and the history of the legis­
lature there, and in the legislation itself, there is not one
single word, not one iota of change as to the scope and the
jurisdiction of the Board, nor the limitation of the Federal or
State courts in these matters.
Now, I don’t know where you can get a much clearer
mandate from the Legislature.
It was a big crisis.
done.

They had their opportunity.

It was a big issue*

They did some procedural things.

Something had to be
And they do not

touch the authority or the scope of the jurisdiction of the
courts.
Q

Isn’t that an argument that in effect they meant

that Moore should continue to be effective in situations where
it might properly be applied?
MR. ESTES:

That certainly is correct, Your Honor,

n
X think this is a perfect opportunity to end this legal battle,
the chipping away and the pecking away at Moore, with the
Koppal decision.
There is another area that we point out to the
Court, which is the real distinguishing characteristic between
what I call Moore type cases, that is to say a purely wrongful
discharge case, and a Slocum type case, or Charley Maddox type
case, that5s Maddox vs. Republic Steel Company.
These are cases where someone — and by the way, the
Slocum type case, Mr. Slocum was the chairman of a railroad
union, two unions were in disputes as to who had jurisdiction
over a certain area of work.

The railroad attempted to file in

State court an action for declaratory judgment to make a
determination, and of course they were required to go by the
• /
arbitration method.
And this was completely distinguished in the Slocum
case from the Moore type case, where this is an ex-employee,
it's not involving rights of other railroad employees, and
he’s suing the railroad just like they ran over his car at a
grade crossing.
The Walker case is like the Slocum case.

The

Charley Maddox case was a case where Charley Maddox had been
properly laid off, and was suing for severance pay under the
contract.
Now, I said that X would corns to the Argue lie a case,

IS
X want to mention that just very briefly, because X think that
can straighten out also some very unfortunate language that
came out of the Roy Walker case.

And that was the language

that the Court of Appeals in the instant case used, even the •. /;
they conceded that all the law was on my side, nonetheless,
their ruling against me was this:

Bthe overruling are is held

so high that its fall is about as certain as the changing
of the season", coming 'from Mr. Justice Black in that case.
Mr. Justice Black, in the ArgueIlea case, made a vary
strong, very fine statement, and I think it reflects the
feeling of this Court, the thrust of this Court, in its
perseverance and continued drive to maintain the courthouse
doors open to the public, to the little mar, where Mr. Justice
Black — and this was consideration, by the way, the Arguelies
case was a seaman suing under a statutory right to elect.
The Court says, in Arguelies, the Legislature clearly preserved
his right to sue, in Section 301 the Legislature clearly has
not taken it away.

So that it would be highly presumptive

for this Court or any court to remove a man's right to litigate
a wrongful discharge, a common-lav; action,in a court without
specific legislative action, and no clear reflection of any
legislative intent toward that direction in any event.

Q

Let's assume your client wanted reinstatement;

could he get it in court?

MR. ESTES:

Could he get a reinstatement in court?

19
Your Honor, I don't believe so»
Q

1 think this -—

Why not?

MR. ESTES:

Well, I don't believe you can force

someone to be employed somewhere.

I don't believe the railroad

could be enforced to make him — well, he was an electrician,
so I’d say that I don't believe you can force a railroad to
let him put together their switchboxes.

They may have to pay

him, they may have to give him damages? but I don't believe
they've got to employ him.
Q

Well, doesn't the Adjustment Board sometimes

give back pay and order reinstatement?
MR. ESTES:
0

Yes, Your Honor, it does, I believe.

Can’t you get the same kind of relief in court?

MR, ESTES:

No, Your Honor, I think damages,

general damages for a common-law wrong are totally —
Q

Why?

MR. ESTES;
Q

Why?

— different damages in nature and kind.
Why couldn’t the court order reinstatement

if the Adjustment Board could?
MR ESTES: Well, perhaps the court could? I don't
believe the railroad or Thomas L, Andrews want reinstatement.
\

1 think the evidence in the case -Q

That isn't my question.

That isn’t my question.

Is there some legal barrier to the court giving reinstatement
or not?

20
MR. ESTES t

Well, Mr. Justice White# in al.1

probability, a court could tell the railroad they either had
to hire him or had to pay him.
0

You don't think the Adjustment Board has

exclusive jurisdiction to order reinstatement?
MR. ESTES:
Q

No.

Is it your position that even if the Adjustment

Board were to order reinstatement, the railroad would be free
to say, "We just don't want this particular man working for
uss we’ll pay him the money, but we don't accept his services"?
MR. ESTES: That’s never been litigated, to my
knowledge, Mr. Justice Rehnguist, but that would be my position,
yes.

That you can't make the railroad put someone in their

machine shop, monkeying around with their equipment, that
they don’t want.
Q

And no court, of course, can order somebody to

work for an employer —
MR. ESTESs
0

That's right, Mr. Justice Stewart.

— if he doesn’t want to, even under contract?

it's been tried.
MR. ESTSS:

Right.

If it please the Court, I would like to reserve the
rest of my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well, Mr. Estes.
Mr. Major.

21
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. MAJOR, ESQ.,,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MAJOR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
I somehow get the feeling that if you argue in favor
of a court trial, that means you're for the working man; and
if you argue in favor of administrative remedies, that that
means you're for the railroad.

And I don't think that's right,

and. I don't think it is reflected in the congressional history
of this Act, and I don't think it Is now the present thinking
of labor and the railroads that that is correct.
1 submit that the Railway Labor Act was an act
sought by both the unions and the owners of the railroads.
That in those days, in 1926, when the Act came into being,
there was a feeling of voluntariness in the eyes of the Congress
that they could simply prod one side and the other side by
means of the Railway Labor Act and achieve the desired results.
And that is what is done in the area of major disputes, those
disputes arising out of anything in the contract, to start off
with, that's where the union has a right to strike when
the prodding doesn’t work, or the railroad has the fight to
lock out.

And that is on a voluntary basis.
On the other side of the coin, in minor disputes,

where you have the interpretation or application of contracts,
both the union and the railroad have been in favor of that

22

administrative remedy.
Mow, I don't know how the case of Moore ever cam® to
ha, in view of the legislative history.

Because if you look

back in the 1534 amendments, which took place of course
shortly after tha passage of the Act, when they find that the
minor dispute area wasn't working because of the fact that it
was voluntary, the unions voluntarily appointing Board of
Adjustment members, and the railroads voluntarily appointing
their membersr and neither side would do it.
that wasn't working.

And they found

And both the unions and the railroads

came back to the Congress and, in effect, said;

It's not

working and we've got to do something about the area of minor
disputes.
Bear in mind, of course, that the word "minor”
disputes is a word of art that the framers of the Act used,
not because they thought the disputes were minor; but to
distinguish them from strike issues, they used that word of art.
As a matter of fact, when the amendment was in tha
committee

now, it was proposed by the Federal Coordinator

of Transportation, an office no longer in existence? but he
said the existence of mandatory Boards of Adjustment would
create naturally

- [inaudible] - interpretation and applica-

tion of contracts.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Major, you'll have

to watch your notes and the microphone? you're making it a

23
little difficult to hear you.
MR. MAJOR;

All right.

And in those committee hearings a man by the name of
George M. Harrison, -who probably has as many credentials as
a union man can have, he was president of the Brotherhood of
Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express, and
Station Employees, and appeared as chairman of the legislative
committee of the Railway Labor Association.

He said this, in

substance s
He said. These areas of minor disputes that we are
looking at in the form of a compulsory adjustment board, they
may very 'well involve a man's seniority, a man's pay for
amount of work done, his promotion rights. And then I quote him
as saying. It may very well concern the separation of the
employee from the service, whether or no he has been unjustly
discharged.
So, as early as 1934, in the congressional hearings,
the union representatives were talking about mandatory boards
of adjustment to take care of the disputes between the railroads
and the working man over matters of promotion, seniority,
rates of pay, including discharge.

And then this Court came

along and decided Moore in spite of that legislative history.
Even more remarkable is the way in which Moore
was decided.

You understand, the Railway Labor Act, in

exhaustion of administrative remedies, was an after-thought in

2«
Moor©.

It wasn't even briefed by the winning side» as a

matter of fact.
Moore came up on the then novel Erie question.
Moore was in the State court» and there were statute of limita­
tion questions involved» whether a one-year statute controlled.»
' was
as Moore's contracfc/oral, or the six-year written contract
with the union.

and it got to this Court on the thinking that

State law controlled.
As a matter of fact» later on, in amplifying Moore
and distinguishing Moore» in the case of Koppa1 this Court
heldi

you must exhaust your administrative remedies in your

Stata» if your State requires the exhaustion of remedies; but
you need not if your State does not require the exhaustion
of remedies.
So you have Moore on the one hand» and Koppal on the
other hand? one of them saying you had to go to the Adjustment
Board» and the other one saying you didn't» depending on the
accident of where you happened to be fired, as it were.
However, this Court, I think, has now fully and
finally solved the question of whether State law or Federal law
applies.

X think, in the case of Textile Workers vs. Lincoln

Millst decided by this Court in 1357» and also the case of
International Association of Machinists •;» Central Airlines»
this Court has ones and forever solved the problem by saying
that anything under the Railway Labor Act involving minor

disputes is controlled by federal law»
Therefore, when we say that this man who has been
discharged doesn't have a remedy that's available to the
little man, as it was expressed, it's contrary to the thinking
of the union, to the thinking of the framers of the bill as it
came through the Congress, and it's contrary, really, to the
thinking of this Court,
It is true that ~
Q

He doesn't have a — he has no power to go the

Adjustment Board himself, does he?
MR, MAJORs
Q

He does, indeed, Mr, Justice Douglas.

He has to go through his union?

MR, MAJOR:

If my understanding of the Act is correct,

he has an absolute right to go himself.
Now, where he may not be able to go himself is to
a public law board.
Q

No, but in terms of Section 3, Second, says that

the request is to be either made by the representative of the
craft or class of employees or by the carrier.
MR, MAJOR;

It is my impression that the '66 amend­

ment to the Act
Q

2*® reading the '66 amendment.

The only thing he has if his union presses the claim
and loses, then he can appeal.
MR. MAJOR:

Reading (j) of the section, it says;

26

"Parties may be heard either in person, by counsel, or by other
representatives, as they may respectively elect."

And X

would assume that that means if a party can be heard in person,
a “party" means an individual rather than the union, I would
guess.
Q

But as I read Section 3, Second, the amendment

in 1966, it receives complaints only by unions or by carriers.
MR. MAJOR?

Mr. Justice Douglas, if that is true,

then my conception of the Railway Labor Act on minor disputes
is erroneous, because it was my definite impression that
not only could it. be done but that it was being done daily,
before the Adjustment Board.
Q

I just wondered how a union -- a union normally

would be the spokesman in a reinstatement, taking care of the
interest of the employee in the future} but if the employee
wants to put this thing behind him and get out of the businessf
and never go back and work again, then the union might not be
a very good representative of him.
MR. MAJOR;

That is always, of course, the

possibility, Mr. Justice Douglas.
In that connection,of course, the criticism that this
Court found of the whole situation, as assumed by Walker v.
Southern Railroad, was one of delay and another of inequity.
The delay that has been referred to, and which is referred to
in that decision, is the delay of the Adjustment Board.

The

27
first division, for instance, had a delay, at that time, of
seven and a half years»
With that in mind, the Congress, in 1966, attempted
to remedy the situation on the question of delay. And again
it's right remarkable, in the committee hearings, just what
happened»
In those committee hearings, there were, oh, days
and days of hearings, and so there's all kind of material in
there? but the remarkable testimony of Mr. Jesse Clark, who
identified himself as president of the Brotherhood of
Signalmen, on behalf of the Railway Labor Executives Associa­
tion and its 22-member union group, testified thusly:
He saids

If the objectives of speedy, fair, and

simplified handling and settlement of contract claims and
grievances in this industry are to be achieved, it would be
done by reducing to a minimum rather than by expanding the
role of the courts in this field.
And so there is a union man himself saying that we,
the union men, are the ones that want, as well as the
railroad men, some way to break this backlog.

And so, in

order to break the backlog, they changed the law, to provide
now for what has been commonly known as public law boards.
A public law board is nothing more than the railroad
appointing one man, the union appointing one man, and they
meet together? and it car. be done within 30 days.

They meet

together and solve the dispute.

If they can't solve the

dispute, they ask the Mediation Board to appoint a neutral
referee, who breaks the deadlock? and they solve it.
tod their decision has the same force.and effect as
if the entire Board of Adjustment met and decided the matter.
Q

What happens if both the Brotherhood and manage­

ment, both decide that this man ought to foe thrown out of his
job?
MR. MAJOR:
Marshall.

Well, he has a contract, Mr. Justice

The Brotherhood, I wouldn't think would have any

more right to throw him out of the job than would the union, —
or the railroad have the right to throw him out of a job.
Be works under a collective bargaining agreementof course.
Q

What is worrying me about that is that there are

some instances where & man is just — he's not loved by
anybody.
MR. MAJOR:

Oh, you mean he gets double-crossed9 as

it were, by this own union? is that what you're referring to?
Well, I think that the answer to —
Q

1 imagine Congress just figured that would be

the exception rather than the rule, I suppose?
MR. MAJOR:

You know, there isn't a prohibition

against him suing his own union.
Q

That's right.

MR. MAJOR:

Obviously.

tod, secondly, 1 don't think

that again there is any problem in that regard, becansa if
he has a contract right, the Adjustment Board can give him
just the same relief as the court can.
Q

And the union can't violate the contract just to

take care of a guy they don’t like?
MR. MAJORs

2 would not believe they could, Mr.

Justice Marshall.
You know, what happened was, when they created these
boards of adjustment, and we attached as a part of our brief
a table of the Report of the National Mediation Board,
which includes the report of the National Railroad Adjustment
Board, and the division

and these divisions are not

geographical, they're by crafts, you'll understand — the
division that Mr* Andrews is in is substantially current.
You will notice from the table that they have only taken in
69 new cases last year, and they disposed of ~~ pardon me,
that’s wrong; 162 cases, and they disposed of over .300 cases,
and they're substantially current.
So there's no reason in the world that Mr. Andrews
could not get a vary speedy hearing before his division of
the Adjustment Board.
Now, as to what he can get when he gets there.
That obviously is one of the key questions. Can he get the
same thing he can get in court?
Under the law of Georgia, it’s highly dubious that a

30
man can go into court and sue for wrongful discharge while at
the same time refusing to take back employment that's been
proffered him by his employer, because of the fact that he
must mitigate his damages.

And the offer of his job back

simply shows that he hasn't suffered any damages in the future
So.- therefore, the only thing that he can get is a
money judgment for such amounts of actual lost wages as he
has accrued.
Now, that's not true, necessarily, before the Adjust
went Board.

Before the Adjustment Board, he can get back pay,

he can get seniority adjustments, he can get attorney's fees
in some instances, and he can also get reinstated. And if they
say he must go back to work, then the railroad must put him
back to work, and the railroad doesn't have any choice.

So

it may be that he can get more than ha can get in court.
I don't think it would be erroneous to say that
perhaps he could get reinstated by a court action.

But

certainly a speedy remedy is readily available for him, to get
just everything that he can get at the courthouse.
St's interesting to me that Moore has been perhaps
explained, rationalized, accepted, it's had everything done to
it but nobody has yet, either fully affirmed it or fully
overruled it? it seems to be sort of an embarrassing stepchild
sitting back there.
And w© say that now, in view of the history of the

31
Act, there * s no longer any reason for Moore to exist.
The fundamental reason, of course, that you have
administrative hearings rather than court hearings in this area,
in the railway labor area, is the fact that in addition to
speed, that you get uniformity of decisions.
As it now stands, if you can sue on these contrasts,
these contracts are highly complex, in that they are part
%

*

written and part custom of the trade, as it were.

Could 1 ask you 3

Assume a railroad worker has

a grievance under the contract, and they try to settle it on
the property and it isn't settled, and neither side takes it
to the Adjustment Board.

Isn't it the only way that it gets

to the Adjustment Board is if somebody takes it there?
MB,. MAJOR:

Yes, sir.

If they can't settle it

themselves', and neither side cares enough about it to carry
it forward, it dies.
Is that your question, Mr. Justice White?
Q

Yes.

But. what I really am askingt

may the railroad and

the worker together waive the Adjustment Board?
MR. MAJOR:

The worker and the railroad together may

enter into a settlement of the problem —
Q

Yes, but they don't settle it.

But the railroad

says, 'Look, we don't want to go to the Adjustment Board: you
don't want to go to the Adjustment Board.

Go to court; we'll

32
settle it in court."
MR. MAJOR: Well, your question, Mr. Justice White,
then is broader than that.

Your question is:

May the parties,

in a situation where —■
Q

That's right.

MR. MAJOR:

— administrative exhaustion of remedies

is required, may they waive the exhaustion of administrative
remedies?
Q
required

Well, exhaustion of administrative remedies
all the Act says is that somebody can take it to

the Board, and if somebody takes it to the Board, the other
party has got to go there too.
MR. MAJOR:

Mr. Justice White, I'm not sura

I'm

fielding your question, but let me express it this way:
1 would seriously doubt that, under the Act as it
presently stands and under your decisions, there's anything to
litigate in the courthouse any mors in connection with a
railway labor case.
Mow, whether you could say the partias waive the Act
and decide to file a private lawsuit over here, I would think
the court would question its own jurisdiction under those
circumstances.

I just don't see any concept of the Railway

Labor Act being anything other than mandatory on both sides.
2 suppose, of course, that you can do anything
almost by agreement, and I suppose that you and I could litigate

in Florida.- although neither one of us live there, unless
the court asks us about it, you know, but, except for that ~~
Q

Well, if the union refuses to go to the Board,

as Mr. Justice Douglas was asking you, if the union refuses to
go to the Board when the employer turns the grievance down,
the worker can't go to court and he can't go to the Board?
i.3 that it?

MR. MAJOR:

I am of the opinion that the individual

himself can go to the Board, and is not dependent on his
union taking him there.
Q

That isn't what the statute says, and your

brief says just the opposite.
MR. MAJOR?

1 was —

The employee representative ca
MR. MAJOR:

• .

X thought that the public: law boards

were limited to the union, but I was always of the impression
that the Board itself was open to an individual without his
union representative.
Q

And that's my conception of the law,

I think there's more in these briefs, 1 read

them some time ago, but there are statistics that show that
there are several cases that have been filed, by individuals,
MR. MAJOR:

Yes, right.

I'm sure the public law

boards —
Q

Well, your brief says the remedy — that's the

1966 remedy **- would provide that either a carrier or employee

34
representative could request of the other the establishment
of a special Board»
MR, MAJORS

Yes, that’s a special Board,

That’s a

so-called public law board.
Q

Yes,

MR. MAJOR: But that’s where one of the® appoints one,
and the other appoints another member.

Q

Yes.

MR. MAJOR;

That’s this public law board, and Your

Honor is eminently correct that that has to fee done by the
union representative.

But to go to the Adjustment Board

itself, I am under the definite impression that an individual
can do it without his union going with him.
Q

But isn’t it the public law board that has

speeded this thing up?
MR. MAJORs The public law boards were exactly the
thing created by the '66 - amendment, for the purpose of speeding
it up, and they have speeded it up,
Q

So if the only way an individual union man can

go is not to the public law board but to the Adjustment Board,
as a whole, he might not get the benefit of the speedy treatment
that was contemplated in 1966?
MR, MAJOR; We think exactly he will get the speedy
treatment, because, by reference to the table in our brief,
Your Honor will readily see that the Adjustment Boards don’t

35
have the backlog of oases they had then.

They are on a

this man's division, for instance, is on less-than-a-year
time schedule.
Now, the first division is where the backlog always
was.

It's not that current, but it looks like, from computing

the figures, that by June of nest year they will be on about
a year-backlog basis.
And that's as quick as you can go to a court trial.
As a matter of fact, this man has been in court for three years
on this case, and he hasn't had a trial yet.
So, obviously, the public law boards are going to
speed it up tremendously? but even if he has to go to the full
Board, it's much faster than if he goes:.to the courthouse.
The uniformity of decision question;

that I was

speaking about has to do with the fact that these Boards
report their casas that they have, and they therefore have
uniformity of decisions.

Whereas if the worker must go to the

courthouse for interpretation of his contract, the Federal
Judge sitting there on the District level has a very awkward
task, before him, because in Atlanta, Georgia, for instance,
the only place where the reports of the Adjustment Board are
on file, as far as we know, is the office of our railroad.
So, if a Federal Judge had one of these cases in Atlanta,
trying to lock for precedents, it would be almost impossible
unless he wants to send his Clerk over to the railroad office.

36

Lest, of coarse, is the question of expertise before
the Boards.

The average man doesn41 get fired just willy-nilly.

Of course, there are cases of that.
This man, for instance, is not fired.
been furloughed because of medical reasons.

This man has

And they say, "Fine.

contract says.

Go to the doctor and
Thatr'fe what the union

That's what the collective bargaining agreement

says.
If the doctor doesn't pass him, then ha's perfectly
free, if ha thinks he's been mistreated, of course, to go to
the Adjustment Board.
So what I'm saying is that the question of
expertise has something to do with it.

For instance, the man

that gets fired for breaking a coupling, the engineer, if ha
gets fired for breaking a coupling, that might sound to be a
right stringent thing to do to him just for breaking a
coupling.

But what the railroad knows is that you don't get

fired for breaking the first coupling, you get fired because
you’ve broken a series of couplings.
of fch:

And it's symptomatic

problem of your being a bad engineer, not the fact that

you broke on© coupling.
Or if he goes through a blow post and doesn’t
blew his whistle.

You don’t get fired for that the first time,

3?
you get fired after accumulation of those kind of offenses.
And when you speak about blow posts and derailers and hydraulic
couplings, the average jurist doesn’t know what you’re talking
about.

It’s something the members of the Board know, they deal

with it every day.
Therefore, the worker gets a degree of expertise
/

before these boards that he doesn't find at the courthouse.
In summary, therefore, we say that the problem that
this Court looked at in the Walker decision has vanished because
of the fact that Congress has amended the Act, and now a speedy
remedy is available.

The inequity that this Court looked at

in the Walker case is gone now because of the fact that the
Congress, in amending the Act in 1956, provided for an appeal
by either side, instead of a de novo appeal, which only the
railroad could taka advantage of, as was previously the law.

Q

What's the employee’s appeal no^^ under the '66

Act?
MR. MAJORs Exactly the same as the railroad's is,
if
Q

.

pe novo?

MR. MAJOR:

It’s not. de novo, Mr, Justice Brennan,

it is limited to fraud or corruption, or a failure of the board
to confine itself within the framework of the Act.
Q

In other words, treating the Board pretty much

as an arbitrator?

38
MR. MAJOR;

Yes. Almost exactly,, on the question of

arbitration, yes, sir.
Q

And is that true on both sides of the review,

of the railroad review or the employee review?
MR. MAJOR:

Xt:s equal on both sides? the review is

exactly the same now.
And so we, therefore, say that Moore has no reason to
exist. It probably doesn't even need to be reversed or over­
ruled, for reasons that new situations have taken place within
the Act that give it a new date.

But necessarily it means

that Moore no longer is the law, and that the administrative
remedy provided by Congress is the correct route for the
employee to go.

I know, but suppose he wants to go the Adjust­

Mr. Justice Brennan, it’s ray impression

Thera’s been no discovery.
Q

Now, the problem that seems to divide you

gentlemen somewhat, and I'm frank to say is confusing to me,
is an important oner it’s something very easy to find out.
Will you each address yourselves to that in a supplemental
memorandum and fell us what Is the fact, what is the practice,
and. what is permitted; whether the employee may go to the
Adjustment Board without the union, or whether he can’t?
Because, as Justice Brennan has just suggested,
that's rather crucial to decision in this case; if not
dispositive.
MR. ESTES;

It might foe dispositive in one respect,

may it please the Chief Justice, but in another respect I
would say — and.the only way it could foe dispositive, I think,
would foe in favor of the petitioner here.
But even finding the other way, I would certainly

41
urge the Court to find that the Moora doctrine is well supported
in rationale, and has not been changed throughout the years.
And that expression by Mr. Justice Black —
Q

But we won’t cross that bridge until we get

your responsas on this score.
MR. ESTES;
Q

Very well, Your Honor.

I think that —

You may argue your point on it, if you wish,

Mr. Estes, but that could be included in your supplemental
memorandum.
MR. ESTES;

I would like to go ahead with it, if I

may.
Q

Very well.

MR. ESTES;

Justice Black expressed the view that

the Labor-Management Relations Act should never be
construed so as to require an individual employee, after hs is
opt of a job, to submit a claim involving wages to grievance
and arbitration proceedings or to surrender his right to sue
his employer in court on the enforcement of his claim.

Why?

Well, again, this is brought out by opposing counsel.
The railroad and the union agree.

He has an action for wrongful

discharge, recognizable in the State courts.

He's free to

pursue it, because of the Moore decision, and really, when we

42
get right down to the final last word on the argument, it's
our position that we’re relying on the Moore doctrine.

It’s

well founded, and it has never been changed, either by
legislative or judicial act.
I present it to your attention.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Estes.
