0 mi. ARGUMENT OF HI CHARD B. STOWE, ESQ. .
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR.. STONEt Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

And may it

please the Courts
This ease, which coatss on a writ of certiorari to
the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,
raises two important questions of statutory interpretation
concerning the scope of the government's liability under the
Federal Tort Claims Act.
Tha issues in this case are closely related to and,
in our

n f virtually controlled by the issues decided by

this Court in the landmark case of Dalehite vs. United States,
decided at 346 U.S.

In that case, of course, the government

was hold not liable under the Tort Claims Act for damage
caused in the disastrous explosion of certain chemical
fertilisers which had been packed and transported by the
gaveroweat for export abroad.

And which explosion virtually

devastated the city of Texas City, Texas.
':hv;tvt:&toly, the factual context of this case is
ghf-thly than that which the Court confronted in
tnlehite.

important at all, but

in the Dalehito case, actually it was not government but privata
contractors who were
MR. ST0NH1 s

That5 a right,

But it had bean carried

out pursuant to a government decision.
But that was the basic issue, that a. private

Q

contractor was implementing a governmental policy to try to
keep Europe from starving.

ME. STOEKs

1 think, for the most part, Mr. Chief

Justice, it. was assumed in the decision that the government
had played a sufficiently close role in the entire process,
including the planning of the -export end the transporting

and packing of the materials, that that issue was — at least
that level of responsibility was assumed in the opinion.

Respondents are residents of Nashville, North
Carolina, which is a rural community of about 1500 inhabitants,
and respondents allege that on several occasions, and
especially on November 14, 1968, their house was damaged by
so-called sonic booms which, put simply, are noisy vibrations
that may occur when aircraft fly overhead at speeds greater
thfin the speed of sound.

5if;upo.idents sought first to recover from the Mr
.

v.'\

vi'

adminitrativa procedures authorized by the

K: Xit&ry Pay Claims Act, and the Air Force regulations
vc-m.ulgated thereunder.

But the Air Force engineer who

investigated their house concluded* in a detailed report..
:

■

ha-

the <

bp re si

.

'

3ent*s home had indeed not been

caused by sonic boom.
■v:

jat; than sued the government in the District

Court under the Federal Tort Claims Act.
In answer to their complaint and supporting
affidavits corroborating the event of the sonic boom and the
relation of the November 14 sonic boom to certain damages
sustained by respondents * homes, the government filed a motion
for aunwary judgment and supporting affidavits.
The government's affidavits acknowledged, indeed,
the Air- Force had conducted a supersonic flight over the
Nashville, North Carolina, area on the alleged data, and that
the aircraft in the flight were attached to the 9th strategic
Faconnaissance Wing of the Strategic Air Command.

That is a

branch or thv. Air Force which is charged with the execution

of ;c-tried? c high-level supersonic training flights.
These flights, I understand, are used for training
pilots for combat missions and are regulated by comprehensive
predetermined flight plans.
; Cczander in Chief of the Strategic Mr Command,
C-*nci-vl Holloway, who ranks, for purposes of this type of
operation, directly below the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated
in hio affidavit that he directed the operational training of

s
.iovers by super tide viighbsf and that the November 14th
flight was, in his

, "eathoriaed by and conducted pursuant

to ray direction*K
Other affidavits filed by high Air Force personnel
also stated that

Ight was at all tiroes on course with

aspect to location and altitude, ■

iissic

Commander in Chief? and this

statement is, X gather, not controverted in any of the
record of this case or in the Court of Appeals opinion, nor
is it alleged at all that the flight plan itself was in any
manner faulty.
The District Court granted the government * s motion
for summary judgment on the authority of the Dalehite case,
on the ground primarily that the planning and execution of
the blights in question was a, quote, "discretionary function

i >r v>hi i the government is specifically exempted from liability
•under Section 2680 (a) of the Tort Claims Act"; and I shall

bidress myself to that discretionary function provision
shortly.
The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's

grant of -summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals held that
the d.loz-v.tier*ary function exemption was inapplicable in this
vase lor reasons which,as 1 say, I shall refer to later*
C": the nsrits of the case, after getting over the
■.

function exemption, the Court held, in direct

7
can'cz nfi ction e

" bvlv-yvv-, to this Court’s holding in Palehite

so

Lgence in the planning os.

of the-, flight, had been alleged, and no wrongful conduct at all
had bmr: al.-egcd, the government could still be liable under
tie tori C3 JLms it:,.'.; under a theory of strict liability for
engaging in ultrahasardous activity,
Lite government believes- that the Court of Appeals
erred in. both aspects of its holding, both with respect to its
refusal to apply the discretionary function exemption and on

the merit© in its imposition of the theory of absolute
liability for the conduct of ultrahazardous activity under tbs
Tort Claims Act.
Ano 1 shall, with the Court’s permission, deal first

rich the merits of the case, that is, the question whether the
Tort clarae Ac. i give a rise to government liability for ultrahaaardou;; artivitioc without a finding of fault or negligence.
l.o x imagine the members of this Court are well aware,
vie ’Jot t ‘JJ aims r.ct ma on acted by Congress in 1946, and

authorised, for the first time in this country * s history, a
very liminei and well-defined range of tort actions which
conic: be brought against the Federal Government.

Van i:;;,,.:; whether the government ought to waive its
vvm

\. -

imacnlty from tort action had been vigorously debated
may Congress since 1919, and ovox 30 bills

i been Lnt rods

extensively discussed in both Houses

Wa attempt to shew throughout our brief in this cast,
ext

the Dalehite case,

ana we have put in our brief her® a summary of the extremely
compioo legislative history of this Act.
As this Court noted in Dalehite y the overwhelming
ocoajorri

of the Coogooos throughout its discussions about

".either to -subject the United States to tort liability was the
need to provide compensation, without resort to the laborious
^recess of private bills, for those who had been injured by the
ordinary common law tortious acta of individual government
employees and agents.

And the chief example of such a

tortious act used literally hundreds of times in the
discussions is the negligent operation of a motor vehicle
drivers by a government employee in the scope of his employ­
ment .
Indeed, the House Report in the 79th Congress,
which ultimately passed the final version of the Tort Claims
Act, noted the need to insure that the Act would "preclude
any possibility that the bill might be construed to authorise

suit for damages growing out of an authorised activity where
-

igciice on the part of any governmental agent, is

si own, and the only ground for suit is the contention that the

ecme conduct by a private individual would be tortious.*8

And that administrative procedure was

And the suit —

At. least it was sought through the Air Porce?

let me get back to the language of the Tort Claims Act

itself.

Evv:U though negligence was the major concern, we of

course acknowledge that the Act was worded, not purely in

of negligence, but rather in terms of injury caused by
r-tglig-<-".h or wrongful act or omission of an employee under

-curt o£ Appeals , the addition

t.r-.c that

is the important word for

purposes of this casa,- mean® that Congress intended to waive

which would bo grounds for a tort suit under the law of the
State where the act in question occurred.
And since a person may be liable in North Caroline
to a tort suit for ulfcrah&zartious activity without any question
of fault, the Court reasons that the government is corres­
pondingly .liable bare*

And disregarding the question of

whether the operation of supersonic flights constitutes an

ultrahasardous activity, which I don’t believe the Court proper!3
cvA'sruinrd, which,- in any event, is what would require a factfinding proceeding of some sort, w® believe the Court was in
very serious error when it read the word, "wrongful" in the
Tort Claims Act to apply to absolute liability for ultrahas ardous activity»
Q

Hell, as 1 get thatMr.- Stone, does it work

like this, then %

applied, nevertheless, under the Military- Pay Claims there

Both --in order for there to be Federal Tort

There has to be a nondiscretionary function by a

federal employee, and there has to be a wrongful or negligent
adt.
0

And neither is ~~ if- either is not present,

t: en you have to go another route?
O. STONE s Than your only remedy is from the Air
Force administrative procedure.
Our essential position in this case is, and I think
it it Hornbook tort

law,

that strict or absolute liability for

the conduct of an ulfcrahaaardous activity is imposed not
because a person has engaged in conduct which is in any way
negligent or wrongful, but merely because the activity is
one which petes a likelihood of damage,’ regardless of the
level of care exercised.
2 .:i m the. commentators, 2 think unanimously, agree,

is the unique characteristics of this type of liability
t it i- irposed net because- of a wrongful act but because
policy judgment that the person who engages in an ultra,

that an net is wrongful because it gives rise to liability
under state law, especially when the underlying assumption of
hat State law is not that the conduct is wrongful but f on the
contrary, that it is deemed to give rise to liability for
policy reasons in spite, explicitly in spite of its riot
being wrongful.
Q

Arc there any private aircraft that create a

sonic boom?
Mr. 8*2CK£«:

To my knowledge, Mr. Chief Justice,

there are not so far? but I don’t know the answer to that.
That’s not in the record.

Excuse me?

It's not

MR. STONEt

1 don’t know.

1 would concludo this portion of the argument by
referring tc the very extensive legislative history of the
Act, which we discuss, for these purposes, at pages 13 to 16
of our brief i which indicate that the word ‘’negligence” was
intended to cover the great bulk of cases brought under the
statute,

v-.x\C

the word "wrongful" was quite explicitly meant

to have c very, very narrow purpose of primarily including
curtain kinds of trespass which were not necessarily
negligent.
hr,cl this Court, in Dalehite, very explicitly
agreed with this reading of the legislative history.

That wouldn't be under the term of intentional

Hri. STONE?

I think that's precisely the kind of

situation which gives rise to strict liability for ultrahazardous activity, where there is a statistical certainty that
;,t acei poi.it,'

if you continue to carry on this activity,

some kind of damage will occur.

But it is considered inherently

„v .abb1- activity to perform, and liability is considered
f.

be Imposed regardless of any fault.

18
Q

!3u... 7o sr- • t it get close to being intentional?

i-.t, ole:,:.2 mil, this is a question that is raised
in ail the corruaentariec with respect to where the strict
li bility ia

intentional tort.

I don’t think that plays

into the Tort Claims Act, in any event, because the except
in the Tort Claims Act are not to intentional torts by
category, but to certain specific torts, all of which are
intentional,
Q

1C take it there’s a difference, too, where

you're talking about an intentional tort, whether you mean
whether the- actor intended to do the particular act or whethe
ha -lid it with coo© sort of bad intent towards the recipient?
MR. STOWE i
Rehnquist.

X think that's right, Mr. Justice

And the mere fact that he intended to do the act,

and knew that it was a statistical probability, indeed a
statistical certainty, that some damage would ultimately
scour, is not, X .think, been considered by any of the/
commentators to be an intentional tort for process and
restatement of touts type categorisation process,
0

And it's not wrongful, either?

quite specifically, in Dalehite, said that activity of this
nature was ;»ofc wrongful *

MR.
Q
was

I .~

You referred to trespass, and my impression

although 1 don't have the text of the State statute

before me ~~ that that's exactly what the State makes this?
that it says that from the point of view of overflying
aircraft a landowner owns all the way up to the heavens,
in the old town law concept, and that an airplane that
invades the airspace above his real estate is guilty of
trespassing.

And any damages involved are damages that

result from trespass«,
And you just conceded that there is Federal Tort
Claim Act liability in the event of trespass, have you not?
MR. STOHE:

Mr. Justice Stewart, I don’t know the

This is a footnote on

page 26 of the petition, and X think that the reason we have
Mot gone into this in detail in North Carolina law is that the
Court of appeals, which held in respondent’s favor, assumed
that the theory of North Carolina law, which it was basing its
holding of 'tort Claims Act liability on, was a strict —

MR. STORE %

— excuse me.

Let me answer that --- 1st

me answer the question by saying that I don’t think that —
I think, that the kind of trespass, even a trespass would have
to be wrongful in some sense,
Q

Well, it is wrongful, just by virtue of the

fact it's a trespass, is it not?

If 1 walk on somebody

else5s property -. forgetting airplanes in this statute
that’s a trespass whether I have an evil intent or not.
MR. STONE;

I think unless there is some element

of fault, even though it can be labeled a trespass,, it's not
necessarily wrongful,
q

Of course if there’s no damage, there's no

line of action; 'it’s still a trespass.

whether North Carolina law specifically would focus on —
Q

I should have thought it might be rather

important in this case»
MF. STONE: Well, it would be rather important —
Q

I can understand the theory on which the Court

of Appeals rested.
Q

That's it.

Do you think Congress used the word "wrongful*

in the Act to mean anything that was a legal wrong under State
law, or do you think it had some narrower definition?
MR. STONE:

Oh, quite

we believe quite certainly

that it had a much narrower definition.

That if it meant

something that would give rise to liability under State law,
different words would have been used. And the Court said in
Dalehite that different words would have been used? and the
Court said in Dalehifce that if wrongful had meant simply
tortious, in the sense of giving rise to liability, that there
are other models for compensation, such as the Maritime Act,
for example, which specify that any act which is considered
tortious gives rice to federal liability.

MR. STONE:

a falling which occurs regardless of

fault, 1 think we would argue is still not compensable
necessarily under the Tort Claims Act.
G

If it fell out of the sky because it was —«

because of a bomb had been placed, on it and exploded, so it
would be a nonnegligent falling, you would say that wasn’t
covered by the Tort Claims Act?
Ml":. STONE: That's right, Mr. Justice White, we would
cay that that was not a wrongful — not a wrongful act by a
federal employee.

I don't recall the Fourth Circuit case, but

there was one perhaps 17 or 18 years ago, shortly after
Dalehite, in which the pilot thought his plane was going to
crash and sc he put it on automatic control and headed it
out to sea, and then he jumped with a parachute, and the
i

automatic pilot wasn't working and the plane circled and
landed on a house in Baltimore..

MI’. STONE t

I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that that's

■i:

'-?;

rrfylvfu case,

ii. cfoqd,-

that case was decided very

shortly after Dalohfua, and thi a Court held that — this Cour

■

orar:

The Pourtli Circuit held that

there was liability. bet one of the theories argued in that
case was the theory of res ipsa loquitur, and that when this

Court denied certiorari, the

srs before the Court emphasis

heavily that the theory of res' Ipsa loquitur was in the case ,
so that in effect negligence was alleged and we have always
assumed that the Court denied certiorari primarily because
there was a problem of negligence and not on an understanding
that Dy. lenite was being quietly reversed four months later

on its holding that there was no absolute liability»
Mr, Justice Stewart, let me add to your question
fcr.afc I simply don't know precisely how North — I have taken
this on the assumption that the Court of Appeals correctly
interpreted North Carolina law, especially since the Court

of Appeals held for respondents on a theory most favorable
to them, and I haven’t looked any further into it.
But X would certainly be happy to make a further
submission about North Carolina law, if the Court deems it
crucial to this case,
C

hat it might be material, since you do see the

A

o

1 Ltv wy hv>;/>y if:

MR. STOP'S2

you

5

did so,

X see 1 have very little time, and I have

yet gotten to the second question, which is whether the
Tort hi :.i:\n Act precludes recovery on the basis of the Section
2680{a) exemption for discretionary — the discretionary
function.
I would say in brief that I think that the fact that
this activity, inherently the planning and operation of this
flight, was inherently a discretionary function within the
meaning of the 2630 exemption, is ««controverted by anyone in
this case. Including respondents and the Court of Appeals.
That the activity was inherently discretionary follows very
much a fortiori from the Palehlte case,
The ground on which the Court of Appeals refused to
apply the discretionary function exception was not that the
activities were not discretionary, but that the discretion was
moved by the Air Force regulation 5534, which is reprinted as
Appendix C to our petition, and that is indeed the regulation
promulgated pursuant to the Military Claims Act, which deals
with procedures applicable to supersonic flights and recovery
for supersonic flights.
And 1 tnink it’s quite clear that that regulation
vhvv: re hr with the discretionary nature of the
activities involved in this case.
Vivo Court cited specifically two aspects of regula-

tier? 5534«,

It first noted that the regulation instructs the
aximu

ilia

in. carrying out the flights."
And from this the Court appears to have reasoned that
if' any damage; to a civilian occurs, the conduct of the flight
in soma way loses its discretionary nature.
Nov;, the short answer to this contention, I think
there arc several other answers also, is that the provision
for maximum protection of civilians is, in its own words, made
applicable only whenever feasible, and, accordingly, flights
are required to avoid populated areas, "as much as possible”?
language, which on its face leaves the Air Force with
nsiderablo discretionary, which is not even alleged to have
been abused in this case.
In addition, of course, 1 don’t think that that
regulation could have changed, widened the scope of government
liability under the Tort Claims Act anyway.
The Court also refused to apply the discretionary
function exemption on the ground that the regulation specifies
that *fche Mu Force must accept responsibility" for damage
caused by sonic boom, and from;*this the Court reasoned that
to

iu no discretion to fly supersonic airplanes without

compensating injured civilians.
I submit to the Court that this aspect of the lower
c.. vet’s holding is really a play on words, because whatever

discretion the ti e Force has under its cvn regulation to pay
to pa;

3amages to injured persons has nothing to do

with the discretionary function provision of the Tort Claires
ict, which relates only to the nature of the activity engaged
in, and not to the obligation to pay a claim.

rn, CHJUSTICE BURGEP;

Mr, Stone, we’ll enlarge

; cur ti.'-.s rive minutes, and give Mr* Allen five minutes.

You

ride it, allocate if.
.

STONE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

And I would add again that 1 don't think Air Force
i

regulations, dealing with repayment of claims, can confer
Tort Claims Act jurisdiction on the federal courts in cases
which are specifically excluded from jurisdiction by that
Act.
When respondents sought relief from the Act, from
the Air Porce, pursuant to this regulation, as I said earlier,
the Air Force engineer who investigated the damaged premises
concluded that the damage was really far smaller in amount
1
v:

a respondents had claimed, and thiat, in any event, it had
v — it va;-i not the type of damage that could be caused

by a -sonic boom.

1 think that one suspects that the court below was
■

case essentially by a feeling that the

nfc. ought to bear the risk of damage caused by its
>£ auj:

.

'■

■ ights.

Indeed, 1 suppose the theory

28

•

.kelihood

ejc:..;i which dans ages was inflicted at all.
has simply not chosen, and very deliberately
not chosen, to undertake this kind of risk.

Prior to 1946,

as I said earlier, ~~
Q

Mr

0-fcbnep could the Air Force decide that "we

will send supersonic pianos over Washington at 1,000 feet’* ~~
’o®cause it would be cheaper?

I’m sure you don’t want to go

all that distance.
MR, STONE

2

I don't want to go all that distance,

of course I don’t have to in this case, Mr. Justice Marshall.
But 1 suppose: if the Mr Force could produce important
governmental considerations which weighed into its decision
to fly supersonic flights a thousand feet over Washington,
that at least on its face the discretionary function exemption
of the Tort Claims Act would apply.

My trouble with Dalehite and the
other is that
.J

you don’t take the position that they don’t have to justify
their regulations?
MR. STONE:
Q

Oh, I think we —

You do not take that position?

MR. STONE;

I think we do,.

I think that precisely

what Dalehite. held, and precisely what the discretionary
function exemption of the Tort Claims Act comes to tell uo is

'

. tort suits ought not to bo the

How, if the regulation is negligibly carried out in
some way, then the Tort Claims Act covers the case, but
precisely what that exemption meant to tell you was that
this is nto the vehicle, the Tort Claims Act is not the
vehicle to review the reasonability of regulations or
high-level government pian­
ti

Well, that's exactly what was implied in ray

brother Marshall's question, as 1 understood it.

The

government doesn't have to show that the regulation, where
it is applied, is reasonable or —
HR. STONE!
Q

No.

— or correct or anything else, but simply that

there they were, that there was a discretionary function
even though the discretion was, arguably, an unreasonable

exercise.
MR. STONE;
O

In fact, that is —

Or unwise.

MR. STONEs

~~ precisely what the — -if you read

Q

Right.

MR. STOiE:

In other words,. Congress has not taken

':1k. risk of Tort Claims suits for improper regulations, and
it has not taken the risk of Tort Claims suits for conduct
that is not wrongful? aad this Court has explicitly said so.
And after this Court read the plain language of the statute

to preclude relief in Dalehifce, Congress, through a very
extensive private relief bill, set up an ad hoc commission
which it author!to compensate the victims of the Texas
City explosion? and throughout all of the debates that
preceded this relief provision, there was: no suggestion
whatsoever of amending the Tort.Claims Act in any way that
would change the holding'of the Dalehite decision, nor has
there been any such discussion since then.
The Act still stands.

It still applies negligence

it still tysccepts liability arising from

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnqulst, the Court

I suppose the

government is not — would not oppose in principle an
c.uyansion of the complaint to fit that ground.
was rather unartfully drawn.

The complaint

It was a home-drawn complaint.

l.oM 1 suppose it could be read fairly broadly to include lots
of claims.

No, I don’t: think this — this kind of

resemblance to takings and 1 think this Court could really

would be hesitant to argue that the

How, let us follow that advice.

This case is not

as difficult as ray good friends on the other side would have
mo believe.

Reduced to its simplest analysis, it is just

this 5

Nelms lives with his family at the foothills in
North Caro Liua in a home, which is not a mansioni that is all

the heme they have.

The Federal Government, conducting

training missions with supersonic planes, front California
to North Caroli

over his house at a distance — I

:::t Iu?.dw y-.uhc tic distance was, but it was close enough for

the ;vcnic ix-ems generated to hit the man’s house like a ton
of bricks,'

They shattered the walls, they broke the windows,

?:«u fat damage -/as so extensive that a building contractor

34
said it would cost sore to repair the house than

.build it,,

IvtlKtt f peeking damagas to rebuild his home, filed
suit in the District Court in North Carolina.

That Court

followed the theories of the government and dismissed the
complaint.
Q

Do all of these allegations of damage appear

in the complaint itself?
MR, ALLENs
that were filed.

Yes, sir? they appear in affidavits

We’ve never had any trial on that issue of

fact.
Nelms was s poor man? too poor to employ counsel, so
the District Court employed —asked local counsel to repre­
sent him.
After the decision was against Helms? he appeals

o the Fourth Circuit at Richmond in propria persona, and when
the case got there Chief Judge Haynsworth asked the Clerk of
the Court to call me'and ask mo if I would represent Nelms in
that Court, saying that he felt it was the type of case that

1 would like.
Of tours© I agreed.

Never have refused the appoint­

ment of a court to represent an indigent person.

Bo I went down to the Clerk's office, examined tho
•record, and there I found myself, 87 years old? sami-retired,
trying to get out of work, in the midst of one of the biggest
questions of the day.

35
Vv-.,:ij. , c f course, the first thing 1' did was to look
tee Federal Tort Claims Act, and of course 3' found that it
provides that fcho government shall bo liable, just as an
individual would be,, under the right circumstances, and liable
according to the law of the place where the act of omission

took place.

Naturali/, then, I

North Carolina law was.
And I found that North Carolina had adopted the
'Uniform Aeronautical Act, which provides for strict liability,
that is, liability without negligence.
The North Carolina Statutes are set out in the
/

Appendix to our responsa to the petition for certiorari, in
the blue paper.

And reference in our brief is”' made to that

Appendis.
Than 1 found another thing, that the Air Pores
itself, which is an arm oftbs Federal Government, which is the
defendant, in this case, had.made regulations which resulted
in the same liability that the Statutes of North Carolina had
made.
Q

Well, are they not limited to cases which are

not covered?

They are set

is mentioned by Judge Butzner in his opinion.

of State law that the- landowner owns the space over the land.

Yes» air.

therefore the Court held, referring to that case, the exact

Slow, according to the argument of the government,
Nelms would have been better off if the Federal Tort Claims

He would have had soma chance to

recover under the Fifth Amendment*
Now, X want to have something to say in passing

about the regulation.

That ths Fifth Amendment would have served.
How, X want to come to that in another connection a
little bit later.
Just a word about these regulations.
A Federal statute authorises the President of the
United States? a Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy? to
nuls regulations for the Army? Navy, and Air Force.

Of course

ha doesn’t actually male© them himself, he delegates that to
respective agencies? in this case? the Air Force.
but when made the Courts hold that they are presumed

of law.
Feeling that X might not have time to complete my
brief? X decided to write a brief on that issue? before I

received the government’s brief.

We found 31 cases? three

from this high Court? that hold that regulations of that type

hav-p -he force of law.

We found one? the Ward case, making

■'

In the Dalehlfce case? there

was no statute involved as a guide to the Court; there was
:ao regulation involved as a guide to the Court; and, according
to the Court’s own meaning the ultrahasardous doctrine•didn't
apply because the Court found that the explosion was the
result of an accident, pure and simple.

Absolutely unforesee­

able by the exercise of the highest degree of care, to say
nothing of the exercise of ordinary care,

I don’t think the case has any control over issues
in this case? and that's what Judge Buissrer said.

Judge

Butzner of the Fourth Circuit.

We might approach this case from another angle.

We

know that the Federal Government has no powers except those
granted in the Constitution, either expressly or by necessary

implication.
Now we have a Federal Statute and a State Statute
on the same subject.

What are we to do?

We are required

by the law to examine those statutes and if they are not
irreconcilably, if they are not wholly irreconcilable, then
we meet let them stand. We must construe the two statutes so
aa to let them both stand if we can.
Now, you have a unique situation here.

The Federal

itchute actually creates the: right of action at the State
level, because it says that, the Federal Government will be

liable if an individual in the State under like circumstances

44
would be liable.

And it says further that the liability must

foe according to the Stats level.
low, you have .the discretionary function in the
Federal Statuto ? chat arc ycu'going to do with that when you
coma to construe these statutes, remembering at all time the
Halted powers of the Federal Government 'and the unlimited
powers of the State Government, except as they are restricted
by the Federal Constitution and its own'Constitution and by
Federal Statute authorized by the Federal Constitution.
You will have to construe the discretionary function
provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act to the effect that
there is no discretion on the part of the Federal Government,
or any agency of the Federal Government or'any person
representing the Federal Government, no discretion to violate
the positive, unambiguous Stats law.

Then both, statutes can

live together.
Now, that construction, in my humble judgment, would
foe more in keeping with the intention of the Congress to spread
the liability over all' the taxpayers instead of requiring the
poor taxpayer who sustained the loss to bear it all.

Q

Mr, Allan, let me put a hypothetical question

to you, which may or may not shed any light on the problem.
Suppose we were engaged in a war, enemy attacks on an
raaricaa establishment, and anti-aircraft guns ware used to
■'■'pi the attack,.

Of course, as we know, anti-aircraft gunfire

v., back re tK.

r re e r;r,

■
and suppose it falls on either people or

.irair, and conn acne Parage*

Do you think

it*3 covered by the Tort Claims Act?
Mil. .ILLorJ;

I don't think that the Federal Government

has any right, even for the benefit in wartimes or any other
times, to destroy property and put the burden of all that damage
on that property owner rather than on all the people through
dates, letting all of the citizens bear it.

X don't think

they would have -a right to do that.
Q

And that would be a highly discretionary

goverumant&I function, would it not, to shoot these enemy —
MR. ALLEN;

Yes, sir; it would. But, in no instance

has the government any discretion to take property or destroy
property without paying for it. They're prohibited by the
Fifth AK-sneoent to the Constitution.
Q

Well, what do you think that exception about

discretionary action means, then?
MR. ALLEN;

Well, —

It would be the highest order of discretion,

would it not, if the ground forces were ordered to repel the

Now* what’s the- difference — it's just a question
of magnitude.

Suppose a government tank runs over a house,

I'11 illustrate this again.
When I first came to the bar* we had a Highway
Commission that was vested with absolute and uncontrollable
discretion to run highways wherever they saw fit to run them.
Be., there was another law which provided that they couldn’t
run a highway through a man's garden or orchard within a
certain distance of his residence,
Well, now* they couldn't exercise that uncontrollable
discretion and violate that other statute.
So, any wry you look at it, you’ve got some rules of
law, and your discretion can't be exercised in violation of
those positive rules.
Now, you had no law in the Dalehite case, you had no
rules of that kind, no statutes saying anything of the kind.
You had nothing but the ultrahazardous act, and of course that
wasn’t applicable in view of the findings of fact that the
Court made.
Just before — after 2 had written our brief in.
this case* a few days before I left horns, there cams across

MR. ALLEN:
J,

Kow, after reading those articles, as

said, I was more convinced than ever of the predicaments

wa are in, the state of confusion we are in on this subject.
•rid X'ra going to offer this solution, which is the only on©
i can think of that will clear up the matter? and will be in
harmony, I think, with the intention of the Congress.
bant is, wherever there is a State statute fixing
b:;\. 1:’...ability. or even a regulation of the Air Ferae, which
is a -part of the government, then they take this discretionary
function provision out of the area of discretion, and tv
goverpmsnt should pay Kow, X believe the rules require me' to indicate to
this honorable Court what action I think it should take, what
:yt;cial r-vlief, I believe is what the rule says.
I think the Fourth Circuit should be affirmed in
on the Federal Tort Claims Act, and the case remanded
