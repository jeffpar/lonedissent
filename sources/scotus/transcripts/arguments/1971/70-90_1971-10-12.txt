CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. O'Toole, you may now

proceed.
MR. O'TOOLE,

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please

the court, I move that James A. Rooney be permitted to
argue

pro hoc v1c1

in this case.

on behalf of the appeal

He is a membe r in good standing of the Bar

of Illinois, but has not been a member for more than three
years .

QUESTION:

Your motion is granted for the purposes

of this case,
You may proceed,
MR. O'TOOLE:

In 1963, the 75th General Assembly

of the State of Illinois revamped our entire bail procedure
and they did this for a two-fold reason.

In the llldin , the

most important one, was to assure that all persons regardless of their financial status would not be unnecessarily
detained awaiting trial ,

As

ansulary blessing

of the system, we have practically eliminated the bondman
system in the State of Illinois,

Basically, what this

l egislation did was to enable a person accused of a crime
to gain his pre-trial freedom in one of three manners,

Under

1102, he could make an application for· release on his own
recognizance.

Under 1108, he cculd post the full amount

of the bond, I mean the bail set by the court in either
cash, stocks, bonds or real estate in double the value, or he

3

could deposit 10% of the fall amount of bail under 1107.
In all, this was very good and it has been ve ry effective.
But in doing so, the:w put in one anachronism,

l'ha t is •

they impose a cost on the individuals who are released
under 1107.

Those that make a deposit of 10% of the full

amount of bail.

In this caoe, John Schilb

those other similarly situate

and all

sought and received their

release under 1107 and they were all charged a 10% bailiff
c ost upon the release or conviction.

Now. we contend that

this impo sit ion of a cost on this one segment is unconstieu•
tional

for all of the people involved here seek

one end,

and that is to be released so they could prepare f or trial
and not be subject to pre-trial incarceration,

Yet they

impose the burden of supporting the entire system on one
segment of that class.
QUESTION:

lf they imposed the 1% on those who

deposit 100%, you would not be here?
MR. O'TOOLE :

Oh no, your Honor.

I think that

as the argument develops, Mr . Justice Blackmun, you will
see that if there was an across the board imposition
of a cost, I would still alledge

that it would be not

proper in that it could never be imposed upon intli~
gents, true j "!d1.,;o~t:s) nor co1fl.d :U: ~ever be :l.mposed

You mean even if it were simply that

everyone released under either of ehe three provisions would
pay $10, still that would be wrong]

aspect,

That is part of our
It is not only this class

We say that one seginent is segregated out and

burdened.

But in addition to that, we also contend that

these people who put up the 10% simply cannot afford the
full amount of bail and are penalized in their request for
justice in contrary to the long line of cases since Griffin
versus Illinois,
QUESTION:

Is that necessarily true?

A man might

be in business and want to keep his cash position

liquid so

instead of buying a bond, he put

very

up the lOo/.

even though he had $100.000 in the bank?
MR. O'TOOLE:

Oh yes, your Honor,

I agree with

you fully that that statement was not meant to be a universal .

5

I think the statistics will bear out, which we have .:Lted
some in our brief, that as the amount of bail goes up the
ability to make the full bond decreases sharply~and
whereas some people might choose to only put up the 10%,
the fact is that he has a choice but what about that large
segment of our population?

Actually, this is .·/moderately

poor, the working man, who just does not have a sufficient
asset to make that choice.

He has no choice.

He has to go

in, make the deposit and then he is subjected to the burden
of supporting the whole system.
QUESTION:

It is not his choice.

But everybody who walks into the

lower amount pays the same amountZ

MR, O'TOOLE:

Yes~ your Honor,

That element,

But then if :!.t is unconstitutional to even impose it on
one person, I think the whole statute is

MR, O'TOCiLE:
QUESTION:

10% of the 10% or a net of 1%.

Going back to a hypothetical someone

posed you before, I would like to get your answer again,
Suppose the statute provided for a $25 fee for everyone for
administrative override whether released on his own
recognuance,

whether released on a bail bond or whether

released on 10% or 100%.
MR. O'TOOLE:

What about that?
I would answer the question the

same manner, Mr, Chief Justice, and that would be that I
think that it would be valid as to all except the true
indigent and except to those th.at are found il".nocent.
QUESTION:

Well, by definition, the ind:1.-

gent for all practical purposes has a waiver,
.assume that

I just

you cannot get blood out of the

turnip as it were.

Then you would say it is invalid as to

the person ultimately found innocent?
MR. 0 1 TOOLE:
QUESTION:

On what theory is that?

MR, O'TOOLE:
QUESTION:

Right,
The theory of that is

Constitutional thaory?

MR. O'TOOLE:

Constitutional theory in that this

court handed a decision in 1966 in Giaccio
vania, in which

a jury in Pennsylvania

versus Pennsyl-

was permitted

after finding a person innocent to impose court costs and

9

that the court in the majority O?inion held that the
statute was vague butthe concurring opinion of Mr. Justice.
Stewart stated

in his opinion. it was a violation of due

process, rudimentary due process, and I think that that is
the law of the land and that should be the law in regard
to this case.

In no manner can anybody impose a cost

attendant to a criminal proceeding on an individual found
innocent.

If there is any qUli!Stion as to whether that is an

integral part of the proceeding, it is probably the most
t

important aspect because it affects a mans family, it affects
the outcome of the trial, it affects the severity of the
sentence, and unduly burdens a mar.,

He looses his job.

And that
QUESTION:

Mr, 0 1 Toole, that was somewhat

different, at least in chronology in the Giaccio

case

because there there was a trial and the jury found the
defendant innocent and then,and only then, was the defendant
required to pay something after he had been found innocent,
But surely there ia a cost, there are many costs imposed
upon people under charges of criminal offenses if not
monetary costs.

There are the costs of, well the possi-

bility of incarceration if he cannot make bail and the
various other social costs and personal and ;,hysiological
costs that go along with just being the target of a
criminal charge even if the person is eventually foJncl 11ot

10

guilty.

There are all sorts of costs and neither the

constitution nor any judges interpreting it or applying it
can really very well avoid those costs.
MR. O'TOOLE:

I agree with you, Mr. Justice Stewart,

that there are other costs that are created by our
Society,
QUESTION;

Just by the leveling of a criminal

charge?
MR. O'TOOLE:
our Society.

Right,

But this is not created by

This is created by our legislature.

MR. O'TOOLE:

A cost attendant to that proc;:eediog.

It would le interesting to note,too,in relation to that cost,
that prior to the enactment of their new act when we had
the bondmen, the clerk performed the same service and
handled the same paper and never oharged anybody anything.
QUESTION:

The clerk did not but the --

MR. O'TOOLE:
QUESTION:

Now, the legislature --

But the expense o~ the point of view

of the defendant, as I gather, was much, much higher until
you got this so-called reform legislation?
MR. O'TOOLE:

That is right, your Honor,

But, basically, I believe the difference here is that we

11

cannot remedy the aspect of the social evil but we can
i:emedy this cost.
QUESTION:

Mr. O'Toole, as you prevail here, do you

anticipate the old bondman system will be revised?

QDESTION:

Mr. O'Toole, what do you think was the

people and the 100% people?
MR, 0 TC.'CW:

'·•~1·,.,,
I '·ue 11eve this was the ide&
n~

13
behind it, is that at the time or prior to the en.actmenc of
legislation under the bondman system an individual could
give the bondman 10%.

The bondm.'.ln,in most cases,,fould

retain the entire 107..
QUESTIONt

You do not think it is feeling that the

101. people would be more likely to jump bond than those
who put down 100%?
MR. O'TOOLE:

I do not believe so, your Honor.

I

believe, basically, it was a question that they felt if these
people were paying a charge to the bondtnan they could pay
a charge to the clerk, a charge which was never imposed on
them before but there was one basic difference in that too.
Our clerk does assume liability for any bail jumping as the
bondman did.

There the cost was justified by a possible

liability.

of Illinois 1 if an individual o~med a large building WOLth

it, he could not pledge that on a real estate bond because
rur statute requires unencumbered property.

He would be

relatively poor as far as that were concerned and he would
have no choice as to whether he was going to deposit full
or 10%.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Rooney, you may proceed

whenever you are ready.
MR. ROONEY:

Chief Justice, may it please the court:

I think that the best way to understand why the Illinois
10% deposit provisions are constitutional is to take a
look at what we had in Illinois before they were passed.
Prior to 1963, when the whole bail procedure in Illinois
was overhauled, we had two ways of g?tting out of jail
once the bail had been set.

First of all, you had a

release on recognizance which was not utilized.
prrhaps cured> perhaps not cured.

Release

That was

on recognizance

doubled in Illinois since the bail reform statute went
through.
QUESTION:
MR. ROONEY:

The number released on recognizance?
It doubled.

It is still not an

extremely large percent but we still have the release on
recognizance,

The only other way you could get out prior

to 1963 was ,methor to have yourself or somebody else for you
pledge the full amount of the bond,

Now, because you had

to pledge the full amount of the bond, there were defacto
three categories of people,

There were the rich who could

111t up the full amount of the bond,

There were those who

could not put up the full amount of the bond but could go
to the bondsman and pay his fee and get out that way.
then, there were really the truly inclig(;!nts who

And

17
just did not have the money even to go to the bondman.
They had to stay in jail pending the trial of their case,
Now, I think there is a difference of opinion as to the
purposes of 1107.

The 10% bail depooit provisions.

They

were. first of all• desig1'.od to get rid of the bail bondman
in Illinois.
QUESTION:
MR. ROONEY:
QUESTIOti:
MR. ROONEY:

What form does that 10% us-..ui;::.~ take?
The 10% usually cash.
What other forms may it take?
The statute says that it is money.

That is all.
QUESTION:
HR. ROONEY:

So, it has to be cash?
It has to be cash,

The other purpose

of the B~il Reform Act, the 1107 was to reduce the financial
imposition on those who had to go to the bail bondman.

The

reason we wanted to get rid of the bail bondman is fairly
obvious.

They have been the villain through all the legal

journals over the last 20 years.

There were all sorts of

abuses including some scimdals that unfornunately involved
judges and assistant states attorneys in Cook County and
throughout the State of Illinois, but that does not mean
that a bail bondman should still be around just because
we have judges and assistant states attorneys involved.
The big problem was that by statute in Illinois, a bail
bondman could charge 10%.

Now, that was supposed to be the

18
maximum limit the bail bondman could charge.

Unfortunately,

in things like this,that become the minumum.

It finally

got to the place where the bail bondman, not the judge,
held the keys to the jail,in many cases, because if you are unable to post the full amount of the bond and you want to see
the bail bondman, he will take a look at you and decide
whether or not you are a good risk.

largaining.

If you are not a good

So~ 10% was the beginning of the

There are other scandals that involved the bail

bondman having judgments vacated and not returning the
pledges to the defendants and,of course, the way they got
the defendants back to the court room if the bond had been
jumpe<l was notorious.

So, what the Illinois legislature

wanted to do was first of all get rid of the bail bondman.
Second,of all, make it a little bit less expensive for those
who are not exercising a constitutional right but exercising
really a statutory right to get out,

When you went to the

bail bondman, you put down the amount of your bail,

way it worked.

That is the

But when you put down that 10%, that is the

last you saw of it no matter whether you were innocent, or

guilty, you forfeited 101. of the amount of your bond.
I think a questio11 was askeo where do we get the l0o/~

Now,

19
and the 1%.
QUESTION:

Hhile you are explaining this, tell us

what you think is the purpose of the 1%?
MR. ROONEY:

The purpose of the 1% is to cover

basically the expenses of the clerk in writing the bonds,
keeping records on the bonds, returning forfeited bond.
It is a big operation in Cook County.
QUESTION:

Why isn I t it char3ed to the man who

puts 100% down?
MR, ROONEY:

It is not charged to the man who puts

100% down because we feel he is exercising a constitutional
right.

We feel the constitutional right is the right to a

reas:inable amount of bond.

Now, the man who gets the

hundred percent bond, he is exercislng a constitutional right
to what

a

reasonable amount would be ,

The man who is

exercising the 10% right is exercising a statutory right
which we feel we are not letting an unreasonable amount of
bond, we are letting him out on 10% of a reasonable amount.
QUESTION:

Isn't it harder to justify those out

on their own recognizance?
HR, ROONEY:

It makes it harder to justify those.
Hhy don't we charge it to them?

Certainly, the cost to the State is

MR. ROONEY:

The cost to the State is across the

board and in the stipulation of facts, when we process a
bond where the stocks or securities or mortgage on a -unmortgaged real estate are put down, there is perhaps a
slightly greater expense to the State than when just cash
is put d c,;m.

do the others do?

Thye charge a flat rate or what'l What
Charge nothing or a flat rate?

MR. ROONEY:

A good example is the Federal 3te.tut~s .

In the Federal statute, it is up to the discretion of the
judge whether he lets you out at 100% or 10%.

Now, there

are all sorts of oth~r conditions he put on your bond.

In

Illinois, the legislation limited the discretion of the
judges to either releasing a man on his recognizance or
setting a dollar wnount of bail.

The legialature has not

vetoed the jud6c with that type of discretion to perhaps
let a man out another 10% or perhaps not.

Once he sets

the amount , it is aut~tic.
QUESTION:

Mr, Rooney, to go back to the 1%,

isn 1 t $1 hundred thousand bond and a $1 thousand bond on
the same kind of paper, take the same amount of time?
Why didn't he just say a flat rate of $10 for each bond?
Is anything in history on that at all?
MR, ROONEY:
history.

Yes, there is something in the

The committee that recommended the legislature

that this Bail Gaform Act be adopted found that >first of
all, there was a 10% oharge

written by bail bondmen

at that ti.u:e, we got a run of

1% of the amount of money.

That is where they chose the

22

1%.
QUESTION:

At any g1von

time, if you kr.ow,

what is the balance or the average balance in all of the accounts
maintained for this 10%?
MR, ROONEY:
QUESTION:

The average balance?
Yes.

MR. ROONEY:

I can tell you how much the State

ends up making each year, which 1s -excuse me.

in Cook County,

In Cook County, we end up making about

$1,250,000 a year.
QUESTION:

In interest?

MR. ROONEY:
QUESTION:

In 1%.
I mean in interest.

This money,

whether it is 100% or 10%, i& put in the bank, I assume,
isn't it?
MR. ROONEY:

I assume so,
And I assume also it is put in a bank

QUESTION:

MR, ROONEY:

Our public officials would be

remiss in their duty if they did not put it in that type of
act.

I do not want the -- I guess the intarest would be

The

total of all 10% deposits is how much?
MR. ROONEY:

$12,500,000 over a year.
QUESTION:

So you have that much money --

MR. ROONEY:

I do not know wh.at t:he cash flow l.s

and how much we do have in the accounts at any given moment.
QUESTION:

Let's assume 4-o/..

Th3t is quite a lot

of money coming in.
MR. ROONEY:

Yes, it is.

But I tried to do some

research on how much it cost the State to process all the
bonds.

It was rather futile.

I could find out that

certain departm~nts that are concerned only with bonds, the
two departments I am talking about are those that,once the
bonds are executed,are responsible for keeping track of them
and that the bond refund section, on those two sections, the
expenses run each year abut
at all

$415,000.

This does not count

the salaries of people who write bonds, and that is

hard to find out,
by policemen.

aome ar.e written at the police station

Some are written by clerks in the courts.

We just could not find any figures on it,

We tried,

Now,

the c1ifference between 1963 and now is that Illinois is
granting a substantial benefit to those some people who
would have to go to the bail bondmen,

The

ind1 gent

would still have to sit in jail but the certain group,
sort of medium group between being able to put up the 100% and

24

going to the bail bondman. they would have had to go to the
bail bondman and pay 10%.

What Illinois has done 1 say

you have a bond set at $100.

The person would put down

$10 and be release~ and the State would charge him $1.
So

what in effect , has happened is the State of Illinois

has loaned him for the period of the case, no matter how
long it took> and,for John Schilb, it took five months,
they loaned him $90 and are charging $1 interest for the
tenn of the case.

No bail bondman can match that.

That

is really the reason the bail bondman vanished from the
Illinois courts.
QUESTION:

Can you make any suggestion whether

the State considers that the fellow who puts up 100% has
provided the State with money £ran which the State earns
in interest enough so that he .makes a contribution not
unlike that of the 1% charge er.cope

t:he fellow who puts

out only 107..?
MR, ROONEY:

Yes > he does.

During the term. the

100% is put up that money is also invested just like the
10%

He is making a contribution.
QUESTION:

I do not know the figures.

He puts up real estate for twice the

value?
MR, ROONEY:
QUESTION:

Correct,
Do you have any information on how many

people put up 100% in money?

25
MR. ROONEY:

Yes,

In the Circuit Court of

Cook County, 90% of the people put up the 10% bond.

About

10% put up the 100%.
QUESTION:

And the 100% might be money or

real estate?
MR. ROONEY:

Money or real estate or bond or

securities.

There are

a lot of rich people who would much rather put up 10% and
have their other 90% working for them because the State

I do not think rich man - poor man makes much difference
here because anybody given the choice,if they think it out,
will put up the 1% for those poor people.The State is

QUESTION:

going to require the people involved to contribute to the

in the appellee •s brief

seems to bear on the answer

to one of the questions that has been asked you.

What are

D,bonds and what are C.bonds?

There are three types of bond in Illinois really.
which are personal recognizance.

I believe that that is the

I do not really underst.::md ~QUESTION:

Those rules are not involved in this

case, are they?
MR, ROONEY:

No.

There was an argument na de

in the Illinois Supreme Court on a petition for re-hearing

that perhaps one of the Illinois Supreoe Court rules would
govern and that 100% should have been boasted rather than
10%, that petition for re•hearing was denied without
coument.
QUESTION:
MR. ROONEY:

I believe that was washed out.
I believe the Illinois Supreme

Court passed and said the 10% was properly applied here.
QUESTION: Are we really back to the original one,
system
that of the three

one that has a 1% charge on it?

No, because we are giving them a

of the reasonable bond.

QUESTION:

Yes, we could,

That is not utilized --

That is what I think is the

argument.
MR. ROONEY:

QUESTION:

I think the difference is that you

take the position that once he reaches the point t·lhere he
:fs not eligible for

his own recognizance, he is in a

different category.

that because he does not haVe to put up 100%,

That i.c youi:

position, isn't it?

The Illinois Supreme Court termed this an

I think as was suggested earlier, there are

some parts of our Society that do n~t function perfectly
and part of it is our criminal justice system.

Of Course,

there are going to be mistakes where an innocent person,

And those people unfortunately

will have to bear this type of cost.

One of the real problems is that John Schilb might have

out and said I will put down the 10%.

J-.nd I think that if

the bond was excessive in his case, it should have been
tested the general way by writ of habious corpus or
motion for reduction of bond.
QUESTION:

What are the State interests that you

assert justify this discrimination among the three classes?

MR. ROONEY:

I think the fact that the State of

Illinois is granting to these people a substantial benefit
which t~y did not have before and also pursuing a valid
purpose in eliminating the bondman from the court system
justifies the imposition of this type of cost on this
class .

They were the ones who had to go to the bondman

before and they were the ones who had to pay 10% before.
We are letting them out on a cost of lo/. and we think that is
sufficient to designate that class as the one to bear the
cost.

MR. O'TOOLE:

May it please the court, I just

wish to make a few observations.

Initially here the

issue is the constitutionality of that cost retention
provision,

This system will go on regardless of what this

discriminatory imposition of a burden on one segment is done
away with.

If I could answer, I believe it was Mr.

Justice Marshall, where did the one percent figure come
fran?

It came from the fact that they got 1% on for

features from bondsmen.

Today they eq~ate very close to that

1% on forfeitures on bail jumping where peoole deposit
10% or they deposit the full amount.
S81m!

l'hey are getting the

amount of money they got before.

The only thing they

are doing today is charging one segment a cost where they
never charged a cost to anybody before.

That is basically

what it is.

MR. O'TOOLE:
your Honor.

That is under the Federal Act,

Now, right after the State of Illinois

enacted our 10%, the Federal Government, &3th Congress,

of the bills was the identical provision that we have here

the Congress pulled out the 10% charge so now there is no
charge in a Federal system which permits a judge to release
a person on less than full bond in his discretion.

Our

system is contra to the Federal system. ·Those are the

only jurisdictj ons I lmow that have any provision for

release on less than full,

In relation to the statistics,

I would just wish to make one observation as to all people
who make deposits.

If you would tum to

their statistics, you would note one thing.I have it
broken down,

Initially, all pecple who have a bond of

$25 or less, this is a minor offense, must post the full
amount.

There isn't any 10% deposit on $25 or less. So

that throt;s the statistics out a little bit.

The second

thing is that, taking a look at this breakdown, in District
No. 1, which is the city of Chicago, where one out of 47
puts up the full amount of bond.

If you take a look at
