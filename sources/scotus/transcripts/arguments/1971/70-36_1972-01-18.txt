ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. O. SHAFER, ESQ, ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHAFER2

Mr. Chief —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
if you'd like.

You may lower the lectern,

It's on the right side therev if you —

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL:

On the other side.

[Adjustment of lectern.1
MR. SHAFER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I usually carry a coke box to take care of that
differential [laughing.]
Petitioners in this case are the president and the
Board of Regents of Odessa College.

A small town in west

Tessas.
The respondent Sindermann was a teacher employed on
a year-to-year contractf which, at its expiration, was not
renewed.

Termination did not occur during the contract term.

Before the term did actually expire, and before official notice
that it would not be renewed, he claimed he was fired for antiadministration activity.
The president of this college also, at about siinultane-

4
ous with the notification of nonrenewal, issued a press release
in which he detailed the activities and, as we read it, disclaims!
that it had anything to do with his discharge.

But it set out

in detail what we consider to be two precise, valid and
legitimate grounds for nonrenewal, which included, one,
persistent, insubordination? and, two, a disruption of harmony
among his colleagues by way of harassment.
Mow, we don’t know of any decision that says that
either of those situations are invalid as grounds for dismissal.
Three days after notification —
Q

Do you concede that there was a dismissal here,

or simply a —
MR. SHAFER:

It is a non-renewal, Mr. Justice, and

I speak in terms of —
Q

And you concede nonrenewal?

MR. SHAFER:

I do hope to make it clear that it was a year-toIt was not renewed at the expiration of the

contract.

It was a failure to rehire, is that right?

Yes, sir.

It is a failure to renew or

These are year-to-year contracts

in what we present here as a nontenure college in a nontenure
State, and with a nontenure professor.
"termination", I mean to say nonrenewal.

And we — if I say

0

Well, you said dismissal*

you were conceding that.
MR. SHAPE JR s
Q

And 1’ wondered if

And I gather you're not.

No, sir.

We fio not.

This was a professor, you say? Full professor?

MR. SHAPER:

Yes, sir.

Well, in — I guess you would say a full professor,
yes, sir. This is a junior college, and the —
Q

A two-year college.

MR. SHAFER:
Q

Yes, sir, a two-year college.

That, was one of the issues about which --

MR. SHAFER: So we don't have chairs and things of
that nature, as you would find in a full university.
I do hope to make that clear, though, that I may
use that tenti.

I don't mean to.

I will try not to.

A few days after he had notice of the nonrenewal,
Sindennann filed a suit in the Federal Court in our area for
$475,000 in damages, and seeking various other relief.
Simultaneously with the filing of the suit, he wrote
a letter asking for a hearing, which was the first indication
or request for any type hearing.

Mo hearing was had.

The case proceeded under the court.•
Q

Does the collega provida for hearing if

requested?
MS. SHAFER:.

Odessa College does not have a tenure

type of statement, although it has adopted, in part, the

s
declaration of policy of the American Association of University
Professors»

And had he requested a hearing, instead of placing

the matter in court, I have no doubt that a hearing would have
been provided him.

But the college got — the president of

the college got the summons to go to court on the same day
he got the letter requesting a hearing.
And of course, I am sure, was paralysed as far as
the college was concerned? and we simply answered in the forum
in which he had chosen to proceed in, and we think that we
should not be condemned for answering in court and proceeding
there»
Wow, upon motion, the trial court entered a summary
judgment for petitioners, on grounds, basically, that
Sinderiaann had neither tenure ndr a contract, and that his
constitutional rights had not been violated.
Now, we will agree that the trial court could have
been somewhat more explicit in its findings, because he made
the broad conclusion that his constitutional rights had not
bean violated.

We think that it is inherent and necessary,

not only permissible but inherent in that finding that he had
to find either, one, that no hearing was necessary, or that
Sindermann waived his right to one when he resorted to the
courts; and that valid grounds for non-renewal were established
go

a matter of law by Sinderraann's own pleading in the

District Court for the* Western District.

7
Now, it is on those bases that we seek affirmance

.

}i the tri;- i court's judgment, and we think that if we can make

our position clear on them, the Court will see why we say they
dictate the affirmance <>
First, about the hearing.

As 1 have explained the

hearing demand arrived with the summons.

But iindermann could

have asked for a hearing, or he could have proceeded in court;
both remedies were open to him.

He chose to do both at the

same time, and, we think, knowing that the court action would
paralyse any action by the Board.
Now, the choice was his.
the college.

He made this election, not

The college responded in the court, where it felt,

it had to answer.

Wow, we don't think they should be condemned

for that.
And we think the court, the trial court, had a right
under those circumstances which appeared in the pleadings, had
a right to say that he had waived his right to a hearing.
Now, probably what is more compelling, from the record
in this case, is that when you look at the basis on which the
case was handled in the trial court, you can see that there is
no necessity for a hearing in this case if the Board was correct
in finding adequate and valid and supporting grounds, without
dispute, already established.
The purpose of a hearing is to determine the
existence of facts.

If there is no dispute about the facts,

then the.-a is *•— it is certainly a useless thing to hold a
hearing to determine facts that are already undisputed and
without any controversy in the case.
In this case, Sindermann, himself, pleaded that he
had been insubordinate and that ha had violated the directions
and instructions of his dean and his president on not one but
on several occasions, and specifically and in detail on two.
Mow, we think he is bound under the rules of any
court by his pleadings, upon which he relies to set forth his
cause of action; and when he pleads them things himself, that
that establishes that fact»
Q

Well, assume that there were valid grounds for

non-renewal revealed in the pleadings, that doesn’t necessarii
mean that those are the grounds the college used; it could be
that they used an invalid ground.
MR. SHAFER;
3

Yom: Honor, I —

That's precisely what he alleged in this

comp1aint, isn't it?
MR. SHAFERs

Yes, sir.

I am going — and X think

if I may be allowed to lay this foundation, briefly —
Q

All right.

MR. SHAFER;

~~ I am going to take issue with the

proposition that where valid, legitimate, honest, full grounds
for dismissal.are established without any dispute in the
evidence and without any controversy, that a concurrent claim

2
of impermissible grounds is not and should not be controlling.
Q

Okay.

MR. SHAFER:

Or require further — if that is the

point you reach upon, X'ra getting to it as fast as I can go.
Q

All right. Thank you.

MR. SHAFER;

Sorry to interrupt you.

Now, I do think it is appropriate here

for me to say that, in Jones vs. Hopper,, the Tenth Circuit,
the Fourth Circuit in Parker vs. the Board of Education, these
cases have held that a nontenured teacher in a nontenured
school and in a nontenured State

end college, upon expiration
/

•

of his contract, has no right to a hearing.

The First Circuit,

I believe, in Drown vs. Portsmouth, may have joined them in that
view, but said he ought to have a statement.
Nov;, we fit squarely under those cases, and if those
cases have correctly declared the law, then our argument is
over, because we are, we fife under that cloak and would be
protected under it.

But we do not think we are, and we are

not here saying that that is enough, because we don't have
to.
Our facts go beyond the holdings in those cases,
and we say that whether it is contractual or not. is not the
point here.

We go beyond, we think we have adequate grounds

under the rule that we propose as being the only possible
rule that the court can adopt, and that colleges and Boards
of Regents in this country can live with.

And this — this

10
rule that we say v/e have to have for survival is that, when
adequate, full and proper grounds that

insubordination.

X*m talking about

X am talking about disruption of harmony

among the colleagues, incompetence, and inefficiency,

Basic

sound grounds.
We say that when those have been established, the
inquiry ie over. And that if there is a concurrent claim made,
of impermissible reasons, that those pale in the contest.
Now, fcha reason for this —

m.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We'll resume there right

after lunch, Mr. Shafer.
[Whereupon, at 12s00 o'clock, noon, the Court was
recessed, to reconvene at .1x00 o’clock, p.m., the same
day. 1

1!
AFTERNOON SESSIOH
[1:00 p„E,]
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Shafer, you may

proceed.
MR. SHAFER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may the Court please

i

It may he best at this point to define the activity
that we are talking about, to clarify the point.
Sindermann asked for and was refused permission to
leave his duty post to go to the State Capital to lobby in
support of certain legislation in which he was interested.
Now, as fas: as Odessa College is concerned, he was
and he is and will forever be free to support any legislation
that he chooses.

What we say that he was not free to do was

to leave his duty post contrary to the instructions and
directions of the chairman of his department, his dean, and
his president, and go some three or four hundred miles away,
at his convenience and at his choice, to lobby in support of
that legislation.
how, whether the free support of legislation is
protected, really, we don’t think is the question.

Here we

think that the critical question is whether he can go three
or four hundred miles away, at a time of his choice, contrary
to instructions of his superiors, and lobby at his convenience
in support of legislation in which he is interested.
0

Docs it make any difference what he’s doing when

12
he's gone that three or four hundred miles?
JR. SHAFER?

He think on balance, may Your Honor pleas

that the compelling job which he has hired out to do, which is
to teach his classes, must outweigh his own convenience in
going wherever he chooses, at his convenience and at a time
which he selects, to lobby in favor of legislation.
Q

Let1 s assume for a moment that he was going

there to listen to some lectures on the very subject he was
teaching. Would that be an excuse for being absent from his
duty post, as you put it?
MR. SHAFER;

I think that would be a decision that

his superiors would have to reach, again on balance, as to the
benefit to the college and the students and as compared to him.
Certainly he would have a constitutional and a protected right
to go.

That would be a matter of his choice.
Jut this Court has said, in Pickering, that this is

a delicate balance, and that care must be used to preserve that
autonomy of the Board to maintain discipline, competency,
efficiency, and at least an orderly administration of the
college.
The problem, Your Honor, is to look at your question
as to one professor.

But suppose, on that same day, 250

professore, or half the faculty, also wanted to go hear the
lecture, and also wanted to go lobby,, at the legislature.
how do you choose?

Each one would have an equal

13
right to gcYou couldn’t say one man had a superior
constitutional right to go to the Legislature and lobby, hut
what are you going to do?

Shut down the college?

No, you

have students who came to get an education? you have professors
who hired out to teach»

And this is the point we make, Your

Honor.
When we say that on balance this is not a matter of
choice of the professor to go to a State Capital, not once,
this perhaps arose some four times.

And on both — he went on

two occasions, testified on the legislation in which he was
interested on neither occasion.
The Fifth Circuit summarily held that this was just
a protected right and really did not discuss the matter? but
we think respondent recognizes the problem quite well, because
in respondent’s brief he classifies it as a gray area, upon
which some balancing is needed.
And when you're in a gray area, if that's what it is,
we think the actions of Sindermann himself may well be
determinative of the importance of the problem.
Now, let’s bear in mind that Sindsrmann himself,
approached his superiors and requested permission to go.
didn’t just leave and go.

He came and asked, realising that

this was an area in which he might be refused permission.
Otherwise, why ask?

He

Why not just go?

they argue in their brief that the Faculty Guide

14

says that all he had <*.. right to expect was? on an unexcused
absence, a reduction of l/100th of his pay.
•■fell., yew. see? we get out of unexcused absences.
This is not just an unexcused absence? this is an absence which
occurs in direct contradiction to his superior,

If he just

taken off and leaves? wa have an unexcused absence.

This man

sought permission? was refused permission? and disregarded it?
and went anyway.
tfellc
Q
College?

How large an institution is Odessa Junior

How many students and how many faculty?
.MR. SHAPES*s

About 2,000 if you count, you must

count the night students? too.
Q

About 2,000?

m. SHAFERs
Q

Yes? sir.

And about how large a faculty?

HR, SHAFER?

Oh? about two? three hundred.

Two or

three hundred«
•3

How large is this department?

What was this?

Social Political Science?
MR. SHAPERs
Q

Yes? sir.

Oh? maybe six or sight.

Yes.

MS. SHAFER” Five or six, something like that? half

a dozen, I'd say.
May I continue ? sir?

15
Mow, I guass what ; : :::e saying is the opposite of
what respondent conte: .'ids that th-a rule should be.

They say

that upon termination or upon non-renewal, if there is a claim
— and hear in mind, Your Honors, I'm talking about a claim.
If there is a claim of impermissible reasons, then you must go
into the matter with a hearing and with full procedural due
process.
Q

Inside the university?

MR. SHAFER:

Yes, sir.

Mow, this is what that contention is.

Now, — and

he finds some support.
Flukey _ vs. hiafcaiaa, by the Fifth Circuit, says that,
fhis case has — very well it might be construed as saying
. ; i cl t «

But let me try to explain why we say that can't
?ork.

You see, if that is true, then it is a matter of job

security for any professor on any faculty, without tenure, to
:;aka ar.;feiac:ministration positions, to offend the administration
in areas of gray or whatever, of black, or white, or green,
because then if he is’aware of his derelictions and he knows
‘iis contract may not be renewed, immediately upon notification,
all he doss is make a claim; it doesn't matter about the
validity of the grounds, because he makes the claim, then we're
Ln the hearing business, and than the courts are in business.
C;

Are you objecting to ~ 1 gather you are —•

16

obj"icy to the

action tn.;,t a person be given the right

to prove a discharge for an invalid reason.

Let's assume the

complaint in this case did not in any way reveal what could
be called a justifiable reason for discharge.

All it did was

say» ”X made some speeches, and 1 was fired for making
speeches“
MR. SHAFERs 'Sail now, I think the trial court is
going to have to hear some testimony.
2

So that either — when he pleads right, it*s

either the court or somebody else who * s going to have to
entertain that claim?
MR..SHAFER:

Yes, if he does not plead valid

grounds, or, Mr. Justice, if he had disputed grounds —Q

All right.

MR. SHAFER:

— I'm talking only about the grounds

established as a matter of law, valid and legitimate grounds.
3

All right.

But you do see, then, that if he

pleads only what would be called an invalid ground, or a
disputed ground, he should have a hearing in court?
MR. SHAFER:

Then we are going to have to have

testimony, yes, sir.
Q

Yes.

All right.

MR. SHAFER:

To determine what we say has already

been pledged, you see.
Q

Well, what do you think the Fifth Circuit meant

17
when it said tsexcept in erne.. inere the. teacher or the
institution refuse to follow these procedures, a court whose
jurisdiction it invoked would ordinarily stay its hand"?
Now, arguably, the court meant:

Well, we think it would be

better for the university to hold its own hearings, but. if it
refuses to do so we'll hold them here in court.
MR. SHAFER:
Q

Yes, sir.

And you concede that at least they'd have to

hold them in court on the right kind of pleading?
MR. SHAFER:

Yes, six*.

1 agree with that.

Where I

tried to distinguish ourselves, and I hope to do so clearly,
because whan I say the facts of the non-renewal on valid,

sound ■—
Q

1

understand.

MR. SHAFER*
Q

Iunderstand that.

MR. SHAFER*
Q

— not foolish grounds.

X

I’m talking sound grounds.

understand.

MR. SHAFER *

Then, I say, the inquiry is over.

And

X say that is the only reason, because —

Q

And you might win — the District Court granted

summary judgment in your favor, didn’t it?
MR. SHAFER:

Yes, sir.

Two motions were filed, and

wo plead what we are now saying to the Court, that the
complaint —

18

Q

And the Court of Appeals disagreed , that this is

not a summary judgment case.
MR. SHAFER:
Q

Right?

The testimony — yes, sir,

You may eventually win, so don't — the only

issue here is whether this is a case proper for summary
judgment, isn't it?
MR. SHAFER:

Yes, sir.

And we say that it was

appropriate remedy in this case, Mr. Justice, simply because
Q

We've been pretty strict, this Court has.

MR. SHAFER:
Q

Oh, yes, sir; I know that.

If there's a First Amendment, possibility of a

First Amendment issue here, there should be a hearing, should;:-'
there?
MR. SHAFER: Well, we do — we say that that should
not occur where valid, solid — and, please, Mr. Justice, I'm
not talking about foolish grounds; I'm talking about basic
grounds, such as involved discipline and competency.
are established as a matter of law, we say:

When those

What is the

necessity of going to have a hearing to see if that ground has
already been established, when it is pled and there's no
dispute about it?
.int this is the reason that we say, Mr. Justice, that
concurrent claim of First Amendment suppression, in the
lace of :

tv

you cat

-/ulid right, is no longer need to be examined, becaus
you'd get into the proposition of where it is a

19
situation of job security.
Q

If we agree with your premise?

MR. SHAFER :
Q

— we agree with your result? of course.

MR. SHAFER:
C

Yes.

Yes? sir.

That it's a valid ground.

I don't imagine this Court will decide.

But that is something
I don't know.

It

would be very difficult? from this tangled record? to sort out
the facts up here for the first time.
MR. SHAFER:

Yes? sir.

We think the pleadings are

there, and the reason we fesl a little more secure than if we
had a record of some testimony or some affidavits? Mr. Justice?
is that in this case we rely on Mr. Sindemann's own pleadings.
C

Well? Mr. —

MR. SHAFER:
Q

But? Mr. Shafer, —-

MR. SHAFER:
G

It isn't a. question about that.

Yes, sir.

y I notice that at that same place in the

opinion to which Mr. Justice White referred you? the Court also
says;

Except — following such procedures would be a needless

waste of time.
And I gather your whole argument is that this is a
case where following hearing procedures would be a needless
waste of time; aren't you?
,-R. SHAFER:

Well? yes? sir.

If I am correct in my

position, which 1

* ~ yon p,«*2, Z am at the opposite end of the

spectrum.
Q

Yes, well, I understand.

Basically, as I

understand, you are arguing that, in effect, Sindezmann has
pleaded himself out of the right to a hearing because he set
up fasts in a pleading which established the legal question,
ancl you don't need a hearing on that.
MS» SHAFER:
Q

Insubordination.

That’s what you say.

MR. SHAFERs
Q

Yes, sir.

'And yet, apparently, the Court of Appeals did

not think this was a case where, following such procedures
would be a needless waste of time?
MR. SHAFER:

U©, sir.

The court — the Fifth Circuit

said that we were guilty of sophistry, I believe is the term,
Your honor

and that whan we

they took the position that a

forbidding of the exercise of First Amendment rights, and
then, after a violation of the instructions, holding that to bo
insubordination, was simply a pretext — oh, not a pretext, but
was sophistry,
Vo don’t agree.

We think that they missed the mark

when they didn’t consider, to some length, the balance of
the problem involved of going, at his convenience — and we
got back to the same problem, of 200 professors going also.
How do you —“ this must, we think, of necessity, be a matter

21
of control.
0

Is there anything in this record to show that

when he went to his superiors, his super or said;

You can’t

go because 199 others will go?
MR. SHAPERs

No, sir.

Q

Well, how does he get in this business?
if
MR. SHAPER; Well, I think/we are setting down on a
principle which is being urged, as was in the Fifth Circuit,
Mr, Justice, that yon have to look at both sides of the
possibility.
Q

If you have followed the rule, of the Fifth

Circuit and gone back to the District Court, this would have
all been over, one way or the other, by now, wouldn’t it?
MR. SHAFER*

Well, I suppose if we'd gone ahead and

You would have had a whole, full record.

So what you’re really pushing for is for us to

support the summary judgment?
MR. SHAPERs
(■

Yes, sir.

1 think it is

That’s all you're saying?

MR. SHAFER;

Yes.

And for the reasons which I hope

to have made clear, because of the question of opposite end

MR. SHAFER.t

I*m sure, with permission of the Court,

no question about it, Mr. Justice.
Q
has.

Mr. Shafer, you've got me confused, or someone

1 thought the issue you were presenting in this case was

the right of some kind of a hearing when a man's one-year
contract is not renewed.

Some kind of a hearing to establish

evidence why it isn't renewed.

Now, that's quite different

from the terms of discharge and termination and so forth, that
we1ve been loosely using.
I thought you had said at one point when you started
that there's no discharge involved here, there's no termination
involved here, it's merely a failure to renew, to extend, to
make a new contract.
MR. SHAPER: That is correct. Your Honor.

And if 2

have responded in other terms, 1 was afraid 1 was going to
use the terms indiscriminately, and I notice that, apologetically
that seme of the Justices have,, too.

So I only responded, as

I’ve tried to — we are talking about a non-renewal.
Q

ORAL LRGiJMBNT OF MICHAEL H. GGTTEOMAN, ESQ. ,
OK BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Mr.Chief Justice, nu.y it please the

Court:
1 think there are more issues in this case than have
actually revealed themselves so far.
But, before trying to define what I think are three
quite separate legal issues posed by this case, I think a
couple of minutes more on the facts can be helpful.
Sindermann was a professor who had been teaching
in the Texas schools for tan years, in Texas colleges.

So that

we don’t have hare what you have in the next case, the Roth
case, a system where there is a tenure after so many years, and
in cases before you on behalf of a probationary teacher who has
been let go.
£indermann had not only been teaching for ten years

in a system which has no tenure, you never gat tenure, but
he .had been the co-chairman of his department, so he was
anything but a probationary employee,
Kow, during his last year of teaching, that is the
year which ended with his non-renewal, he had been active in
two causes which were both very alive before the Texas
Legislature.

25
Q

Well, Mr. {sottee&an, taking a phrase you used,

51 that he was anything but a probationary employee”.

In a non-

'-©nured context, do you have such a thing as probationary
employees hare?
MR. GOTTESM&Us

1 suppose not.

Everybody is one-

year *—
Q

On a one-year appointment?

MR. GOTTESMAN;

That's correct.

But what I meant by that was that where you have a
tenure system, the arguments that are made in tha Roth case for
not providing hearing is that:

Look, we need this time to

look these fellows over, and we do give them the protections
after we've weeded out those that we don't think are going to
cut the mustard here.
And it's really only a short period of time until
they're going to get fhe.tr tenure; it's only seven years, in
most States,
But all of those arguments have no application on,
I'm saying, to its system.

1 haven't gotten to the legal argu­

ment yet.
The only point I wanted to make is fchajfe is no
tenure system, but Sindermann is not somebody who is going
through what we would customarily call a probationary period,
whore they wore trying to decide whether or not he meets the
criteria for some kind of continuing employment.

He had been

teaching there already for ten years, and had been co-chairman
of the department.
Q

Mr. Gottasman, where is Mr. Sinc.ermann now?

MR, GOTTESMAN:

Mr. S inderma.rm has been, for three

years, unable to obtain a teaching job.

And, indeed, he has

for most of that period been unable to obtain any employment
even related to that.
Q

He has been working for a former Senator

Working for what?

MR. GOTTESMAN:

A former Senator from the State of

Texas,,
Q

State Senator?

MR. GOTTESMAN:

No, a U. S.f a former U. S. Senator.

lie has, as an affidavit in our brief reflects,
applied to something like 105 or 110 colleges end universities,
and bean unable to secure another teaching appointment.

And we

suggest there is a relationship between his non-renewal and
that fact, which I’ll come to later.
In any event, Sindexmann was very active in two
causes:
of Texas.

one was an effort to get tenure for the junior college
He was the president of the

association of all of

the; junior college teachers in Texas, some 42 colleges.

And

he had been invited, he had been active throughout this period,
writing letters and preparing speeches and making speeches.
He had also been invited- in his capacity as president of the
Texas Juniori College Teachers Association, to testify whan that

27
- LsXation was ftp foj*

1 efore the Texas Stata Comm it tee

The other cause ha was involved in was a community
effort to turn Odessa College into a four-year college, from a
junior collage.

And most of the people in the consmunity were

supporting that, as was Sindermarm.

But the Board of Regents

of the. college, who would have lost their positions if the
natura of the college had changed, were opposing it.
As a result, on both of these issues, the tenure
issue and the elevation of the college issue, Sindemann wa3
aligned with groups who were supporting legislation which the
college administrators ware violently opposed to.
Both of those bills ©nine up for hearings in the
Texas Legislature, within two or three days of each other;
Sindermann was invited by tbs members of the Texas Senate to
testify on both.
Be went to his superiors and he said, "May I have
permission to go?

The only way I can testify, since the

Legislature only sits during class hours, is if I can go
and get permission to be absent for one day on each occasion."
Ha offered to pay for the substitutes who would fill
in for his classes, and the substitutes who were available
were people who taught precisely the same courses at other
hours in the day, so there’s no question that they were fully
capable of teaching the course.
They had agreed to substitute for him, and he was

28
prepared to pay them for doing so.
and the college said, "No, you can't go.”

And gave

him a long., elaborate letter from the president of the college
explaining why. he couldn't go.
sentence, was:

The first reason, in one

We pay you to teach, nor to go lobbying.

But then they went on with:

This isn't your job?

you ought to have a legislative man in Austin who can do the
testifying for your groups; and we're thinking about giving
tenure, anyway, so there's no reason why you need to go and
testify on it.
Quite plain, I think, that the college didn't want
Mr. Sindermann to be testifying.
He did go, notwithstanding their refusal to grant
permission.

He did provide for substitutes to teach the

classes; and he did offer to pay for the substitutes himself.
Notwithstanding that, a couple of weeks later he
got advice from the college that, he was not to be renewed for
the following year.

And when rendering that advice, they

issued a press release, which they furnished a copy of to him.
The press release did not say he was guilty of
insubordination, it did not say he was guilty of creating
disharmony among his fellow colleagues.

The press release

recited the entire gamit of what we would call his First
Amendment activities that year.

He got involved in the

committee to get tenure-, and that was unfortunate, and it was

29

in opposition to the views of the Board of Regents»
Ha got involved in the effort to elevate the college*,
and that created a lot of dissension in the- community, and that
was unfortunate, and that was in opposition to the position of
the Board of Regents.
In support of the latter cause, his name appeared on
a "disgusting'1’ ad, which appears at the end of our brief, and
which is quite innocent.

But his name was attached to a

"disgusting* ad which supported the effort to elevate the
college.
And though Sinderraann had told the Board of Regents
that his name had been put there without his permission, he
was, nevertheless, responsible on the theory of guilty by
association, because he had associated with the group who did
publish the ad.
And then, at the end of the group, this list of what
1 would call reasons that were being given, they mentioned the

two absences? and then they said:

The Board of Trustees has

been — the Board of Regents has been furnished the above
explanation of Mr. Sinderraann’s activities, and has expressed
its diapproval.
And, indeed, on that same day, though the press
release didn't say it, they voted not to renew him.
Sinderraann then came to court.

I should say, before

he cams to court, immediately upon being notified of his non™

30
renewal, hs requested

e

hearing.

He wrote a letter.

He had,

when he first had inklings that he was in trouble, he 'had
previously requested that he be furnished the procedures which
some internal AAUP documents provide for faculty members.
Those had been refused him.
•He was notified of his non-renewal, and without being
afforded a hearing of any kind he wrote a letter saying,
f5Can 1 have a hearing?“

Ke got no answer to that letter, and

three days later he filed his lawsuit.
How, the lawsuit which, it has been suggested, in
effect, confesses a lack of claim on his behalf, does nothing
of the sort.

The lawsuit recites Sindermann’s active

participation in these t-wo causes.
he was non-renewed.

It recites the fact that

It alleges that the reason he was non-

renewed was that he was taking positions contrary to that of
the Board of Regents, on both pieces of legislation, and it
attaches the press release as reflecting precisely what the
complaint alleged, namely, on its face, the press release and
the way it's written and the way it's structured, suggests
that all of his activities played a part in the decision not
to renev? him.
The university then moved for summary judgment, and
.•it did so on a ground which it is not arguing here today,
it

w«h3

tbs ground_ bn which it sought certiorari.

the college.

The collega said s

I should say

Since his contract has

31

no tenure, we have no obligation to
keep him or to hire him again for another year, and we can
refuse to hire him for any reason whatsoever, including the
exercise of his First Amendment rights,
And for that proposition they cited a. decision of the
Tenth Circuit, which held precisely that.

It’s: the only case

we’ve ever found that held that? but it did, and they cited
that proposition in support of their motion fox summary
judgment
The District Court apparently grantee, summary judgment
for precisely that reason.

Its opinion recites one, two, three,

four, he has no tenure, he has no contract, he therefore has

no right to reemployment, therefore the complaint should be
dismissed.
And the Court of Appeals of course reversed that,
quoting from a long line of decisions by this Court, which
establish the proposition that a teacher or a public employee
or anyone else, for that matter, cannot be denied even a
privilege which the State affords, if the reason for its
denial is that he’s exercised his First Amendment rights.
Q

Now, does this theory also apply to one

employed as a teacher by a private college?
MR. GCTTE8MAN:

I would think not, since the — well,

that depends on whether the finance — the public financing
that r.hv private college gets would make it State action. The

32
theory derivas from the Fourteenth Amendment, vhich of course
requires Stats action.-

And therefore you would have to find

that the collegeSs action constitutes State action before you
can find that it's applicable to a private college»
Q

What, Mr» Gotteaman, if Mr» Sindermann had been

an original applicant for employment by Odessa Junior College,

if he had cc-ho with impeccable academic, intellectual
credentials, with all sorts of fine letters of recommendation
from the dean and the professors at Harvard, where he had
received his graduate degree.
MR» GOTTESMANs
Q

Right.

But if the hiring authorities at Odessa Junior

College had said, Yes, we recognise you're superbly qualified
to be a member of our faculty, academically, professionally,
intellectually, your character also we grant is impeccable?
but you've been making too many speeches on subjects we don't
agree with you on, so we're not going to hire you.
Would he have had a cause of action?
rn. G0TTE8tm$

Well, this Court has held that he

would? I’m not sure I'd want to get involved.
h case called^hltehlXl vs»_ Elkins, 389 U.S. 54, in
which this Court held that an applicant for employment by the

college could not be refused employment because of his prior
exarcdss of his First Amendment rights.

To be more precise,

because he wouldn't rtgn an oath assuring that he had not belong*.-5

33
to certain organisations.
Q

Yes. That's quite a —

MR, GOTTESMAN2

Well, 1 don't want to get into it

too far, because —
C

Well, X do t*ant to get into that, because I

think it tests your position in this case.
MR. GGTTESMAN:
C:

Ye3, I —

My question, XEm not talking about a non-

communist oath or any other kind of oath.
MR. GOTTESMAN;

Yes, X understand.

But this Court

has said that the State cannot condition employment, either
in the first instance or continued employment, upon someone
refraining from exercising his First Amendment rights.
Now, I've got a case where the man's been teaching
for ten years, and they sciid •— we say they said —
Q

That his contract has expired, as it does each

year.
KR. OOTTESMAN:
G

That's correct.

That's correct,

So each year he has to be rehired.

And I'm

asking simply about original employment.
MR. GOTTESMANs
to a teachers

Yes.

I think if a university said

You are someone we would hire, but for the

fact that v.e don’t, like your political views.

Or but for the

fact that you support tenure; or but for the fact that you
organized —

34
Q

That you would like it to be a four-year college

rather than a two-year college.
MR. GOTTESMAN:
right.

Right.

Or — well, yes, that’s

Go —
Q

Therefore’we’re not going to hire you.

MR. GOTTESMANs

Yes.

Let me emphasise that.

Under

Pickoriag, this Court has suggested that there are limits
within which a teacher must confine himself
Q

That was a dismissal case.

That was a dismissal

case.
MR. GOTTESMAN:
Q

Yes, that's right.

What I’m ashing about is, since this is a case

where his employment contract had expired; I’m asking you about
the case of original employment.
MR. GOTTESMAN;

Right.

Well, all I can say is that

this Court has decided three cases.
Q

All right, let me have them.

MR. GOTTESMAN;

Two of them on non-renewals, and a

third oil an application for employment.

The two non-renewal

eases are Keyishian and Shelton v. Tucker, both of which are
cited in our brief.

v. Elkins .■

And the job application case is Whitehill

And though the facts are different and though we

•could argue whether a particular statement of a teacher is
protected by the First Amendment, the principle of those three
cases clearly stated was that the State cannot condition

35
employment* even though it be a privilege, upon a teacher’s
refraining from the exercise of his First Amendment rights,
Mow» the reason I mention Pickering is that Pickering
somov/hat limits the scope of the right* the First Amendment
rights available to a teacher.

There are certain instances#

Pickering at least suggests, where a teacher might not be
allowed to speak and hold his'job# whereas other members of the
society might.

For example, where his criticism would go to

his immediate superior.
Q

But Pickeringas 1 said, was a dismissal case,

MR, GOTTESMANi

Pickering itself was a dismissal case,

that’s right.
Q

That was a dismissal case, and you properly

identified the question on which we granted certiorari in
this case, a question to which Mr. Shafer didn't really address
himself, .?r..d X think that’s the question on which we did grant
certiorari in this case.

And that's the reason I asked my

question about original employment.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Right.

Mowe I can only say these things about it:

No. 1,

every single brief filed in the Roth case, which you're going
to hear nest, which includes the State of Wisconsin, the
State of California, the State of Massachusetts, the City of
New York, and. a brief filed on behalf of, quote, "Almost
all the colleges and universities in the United States3, end

3S
quote, concedes this legal issue.
sayss

Every single one of them

We absolutely concede that a college cannot refuse to

renew a nan-tenured teacher for another year.

Because he

has exercised his First Amendment, rights.
Q

What impact does that concession suggest for us?

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, that concession., I think, did

not bind this Court, obviously, this Court can say they're
all wrong.

What I’m suggesting is a long and continuing,

unbroken line of decisions by this Court had said something
which these briefs all reflect; namely, that even ~~ and,you
know, the person who’s an applicant in the first instance, I
think, is a somewhat different case than this.

This is a man

that’s beer* teaching hare for ten years.
But the cases clearly establish that the man who has
been teaching here for a period of years, on a one-year renew­
able contract each time, may not be told;

This time you shall

not be renewed because we don’t like what you’re saying.
That, for the purposes of determining his protected
rights under the First Amendment, his status is no different
than that of the teacher in Pickering♦
Now, to be sura, that doesn't mean that he can say
anything he wants.

It means

but are we talking about that

area of substantive statements which Pickering says the
teacher is allowed to make?

And our argument is that it has

already been decided by this Court several times, that a teacher

37
can’t be denied renewal for that reason.
Q

Mr. Gottesm&n, —

Q

May I ask you -- go ahead.

Q

~~ conceding that there is a difference, obviously

in fact, between one v;ho has been teaching for ten years but
who teaches on a year-to-year contract, and an original
application? what is the difference, from your point analytically
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, I start with the proposition

that even the applicant can’t, I mean, you know, so
analytically it shouldn’t make a difference.
it seems to me there’s an obvious difference.

But there is a —
If you start

at one end by saying the man who has in fact got tenure
whatever that means —* can’t be dismissed? can’t be dismissed,
as distinguished from non-ranewed,

But the man who is an

applicant in the first instance isn’t — you know, does not
have this same right.

Let’s assume that hypothetically.

lliis man obviously falls somewhere in the middle.
Mow, what is it that has lad this Court to say you can’t be
dismissed for exercising your First Amendment right?
What’s led
this Court to say that is that society
V
has a very important interest in hearing what teachers have
to say about their colleges and universities, and if we were
going to allow colleges and universities to dismiss people
because of what they say, then we’re going to silence the
oyla who can most benefit society by advising us of what's

38
wrong with our collegesf how they can be improved.
Q

Mr. Gottesman —

MR, GOTTESMAN:

Nov;, that consideration is equally

applicable to Mr. Sindermann.
Q

Mr. Gottesman, if we follow yon to the bitter

end, Mr. Sinderraann wins his point, doesn’t he?

i.e* that

you now have tenure in Florida,
MR. GOTTESMAN:
Q

I’m sorry.

i.e. that ~?

You nov; have tenure in Florida.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Oh, absolutely not.

You have the

right not to —
Q

I mean in Texas.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

I mean in Texas.

Excuse me.

You now have the right not to be

fired for exercising your First Amendment rights.
Q

That * s tenure»

MR. GOTTESMAN:

That’s not — I’ve always understood

tenure to be something more than simply giving you what the
First Amendment gives you. Tenure says you can’t be fired for
any reason whatsoever, unless the college undertakes to
establish that you have been guilty of some reach of their
regulations, or rules, or obligations.
2

Weil, is your relief you want a hearing?

KR. G-OTTESMAN:

Does he want a hearing?

Absolutely.

But it’s nett he kind of hearing that would be a tenure hearing,
and. that’s what I’d like to turn to in the remainder of my time.

39
Q
you this;

Before you do that, Mr. Gottesman, let ma ask
We’d both agree, I’m sure, that writing articles

or making speeches are First Amendment rights.
MR. GOTTESMANs
Q

Absolutely.

Suppose when he applies, they send back a letter

•;o him, so that there’s no dispute, to say:

We are impressed

considerably with your academic credentials, but on the
information we have you make too many speeches and write too
nany articles, and for that reason we do not went to employ
'•OU,

Do you think he has got a right to a hearing on that
issue?
MR. GOTTESMAN %
Q

If he’s never worked, there before?

Yss.

MR. GOTTESMAN;

Oh, I think that I#d have to get

into the analysis of the hearing right to explain why I think
ie may not have a right to a hearing on that.
Q

All right.

Mi» GOTTESMAN$

There are, as we see it, two completely

different sources for the right to a hearing of a non-tenured
teacher.

One emanates from the First Amendment, the other from

■.he procedural due process clause.
This case and Roth, both pose, at least arguably,
first Amemlnemtn considerations. They seem to have been
implicated in the decision not to renew.

Shis Court has repeatedly recognised that
^t?x cn «.fife £02

a moment then

-.r w.

- as stone

, it*

.ftfflendaterit right • ' This Court has repeatedly recognised that
academic freedom or the exercise of First Amendment rights
can be chilled if the 'State can come along and wallop somebody
to the point where he knows that can happen, and he says,

"Well

X don't want that td happen to me? I am going to refrain from
the exercise of my rights."
And because of that, this Court has

recognised, as

it sometimes put it, that the freedoms of expression must be
surrounded by necessary bulwarks or buffers, procedural
protections which will eliminate the chilling effect which
would otherwise exist in the exercise of such right.
Mow, in the case of a university teacher who does not
have tenure, if the college has the right to deny him renewal,
with neither a statement of reasons nor a hearing, then every
teacher says to himself?

Well, if I say something they don't

like, all they've got to do is say, Okay, fellow, next year
no contract.
Now, the impact of that on teachers, unless they're
extraordinarily brave and not concerned about whether they
continue their employment or not, the impact of the knowledge
that the college need provide neither a statement of the reason
nor a hearing is that teachers are going to say:

I better not

say anything that they're not going to like, because if.1 do

41
I'm not going to be working here next year.
icv, all of the arnicas briefs in Roth are very sensi­
tive to this point, and they acknowledge that you do need
procedural protection, because otherwise the First Amendment
rights will dry up and vanish.
a. procedural protection,.

But they say, Look, there is

If the college fires the man, and if

he believes that the . reason he was fired was because of things
protected by the First Amendment, he can bring a lawsuit under
Section 1933, and if he wins he'll get bade.
Well, we say, and we*ve briefed this extensively,
that availability of that lawsuit does not remove the chilling
effect.

There are a number of reasons for that.
‘So. 1, if they don't tell the teacher why he’s been

fired, he doesn't know that he’s been fired because of his
freedom of expression.

He’s got to bring a lawsuit just to

In discovery he’ll find out whether or not he’s got

the right to proceed with hie lawsuit.
Q

Well, nov/ are you talking about a case where he

is fired, to use your word, or non-renewal?
MR. G0TTESMA1I:
case.

I’m talking about a non-renewal

And I’m assuming, for the moment, because that’s our

first point, I’m assuming that a non-renewed teacher, if the
reason for his non-renewal is the exercise of his First Amend­
ment right, has in fact suffered a constitutional violation,
and is entitled to reinstatement.

So that the question comes:
protect that First Amendment right?

How do you enforce and
Is it sufficient to say

that after he's fired he can bring a lawsuit?

Dr is it necessary

in order to make those rights meaningful and not to chill
academic freedom, to say that he's got to have a buffer between
his speech and the moment of firing? a procedure in which the
First Amendment considerations will be aired and debated, and
the. facts will be gathered, and he will know that within the
academic community, before the■knife falls on his neck for
what he says, there will have been a hearing in which Us position
will have been heard, and the First Amendment considerations
will have been explored .
How, we suggest, and we've detailed it in the brief,
and I'm not going to have time to go through the full analysis.
We suggest that simply having the right to bring a lawsuit
after you've been fired, when you may not even have been told
why you've been fired, and I used *fired" to mean non-renewqd,
1 have to make the same concession that Mr. Shafer did? when

I used "fired” I mean non-renewed in this case.
Simply having the right to bring the lawsuit after­
ward is not an adequate protection for First Amendment rights.
Teachers will not regard it a3 sufficient protection to
embolden them to speak, when they know that
Q

Well, it would be adequate if they told the

non-renewed teacher that he was fired for exercising his

43
First Amendment right, though?
MR

« ..ii t

sense

GQTTESM&N:

Well, it would be adequate in the

that if the teacher could afford to sue end could afford

to be' unemployed until ha wins, because those are some of the
prospects he faces, it would then be adequate.

But, you see,

the problem —«
Q

But if the university said:

Yes, we fired you

for that reason; we're sticking to it.
His only alternative is to go to court, then.
MR. GGT’fESMftJSI:

That's right.

But the hearing

provides a buffer whereby he may talk them out of it.
For example, in this case there's no evidence whatso­
ever that the college was aware that the First Amendment had
any implications here.

They seem to have proceeded,as the

press release is awfully candid

they seem to have proceeded

without regard to the fact that they might have some
constitutional obligations hero.

What do you think the remedy — what do you think

A trial under the Fifth

We don’t think that's particularly wise.
Well, X knowp but I would think you would be

arguing that the District Court would have to say that your
client s*ay not be terminated until there’s beer a university
hearing,
MR. GQTTESMMJs

Well, the problem is, a hearing at

this point, the hearing doesn’t do Sindermann very much good.
The people who are going to make the decision have already
decided it before they gave him the hearing.
Q

That's right.

MR. GOTTESM&SJ:

Our point is, you’ve got to have a

hearing before they make the decision.
0

Well, then —

MR. GQTTSSMANs

And our point is that since they

denied Sinderraann the hearing to which we say he was entitled,
he's entitled to reinstatement and back pay, and we say in a
large number of casos of this Court.

Without regard of what the facts would show,

for his First Amendment ~~

45
MR. GCTTESMAN
Thia Court ha:

That!s i.*ight.

Thatf s right.

decided a number of cases, of which

i. th ink the most recent is Greene vs. United it ate..-, where there
is

statutory procedure which ha s been violated.

And then

the government says, Well, look, we don't have to put him back.
At least let's go through the procedure now and find out if
wa had substantive grounds to justify what we did.
And this Court has said:

No, you didn’t give him the

hearing when he was entitled to it, and when it. would have been
meaningful; therefore, your action is null and void, and it
must be set aside.

You have to put the man back, and then

if you want to get rid of him, you have to give him the hearing
that he’s entitled to.
Now, I’d like in my remaining five minutes to get to
what is the wholly separate sources that we say are the right
to a hearing.
Cur first point stems from the First Amendment.
This one stems from the procedural due process concepts, which
have been enunciated by this Court in a number of recent
decisions.
This Court has said that where the State proposes to
injure important interests of one of its citizens, it must
first afford them a hearing, or some form of procedural due

Sindermann, X think are clear.

When he!s denied renewal,

Mo. 1, he loses his sole source of income.

This Court has

many times said what the significance of that is.
No. 2, he loses the entire professional relationship
that he's developed with his colleagues at this campus.
No. 3, he confronts a problem which is unique, I
think, to teachers.

Almost invariably, if he wants to stay-

in his career, he's got to move to another city.

Because only

one college, in Odessa, Tar,as, if he's going to teach somewhere
else, he's got to move.

That means lie's got to sell his house,

he's got to move, he's got to buy a new house, make new
friends.

His entire life is changed as a result of a non--

renewal.
And Ho. 4, the evidence —- and we've got it all set
out in our brief — is very substantial that non-renewal just
doesn't mean that yon don't teach at this college? it means
that you don't teach again anywhere.

The fact is when you're non-renewed, your career
very likely may come to an end.

Are you saying, Mr. Sindermann, that there must

be a hearing whenever there is a non-renewal, regardless of
whether reasons are assigned or not?
MR. GOTTSMAN:

Yes.

What we're saying is that you

mu3t do, our concept of the procedure is, if someone is
recommending that you, be not renewed, that you be advised of
the recommendation, and that you be advised that if you wish
you will be told the reasons and afforded an opportunity to be
heard.
Now, one thing I want to emphasize, the main argument
made by all parties in Roth as to what's wrong with this
proceys, is that it9s going to take away the college's
discretion which they now have in making decisions, and that’s
— because they seem to think that the purpose of this hearing
will he to force the college to prove the validity of the
reasons that it has assigned for the decision.
And we want to emphasize that the hearing, as we

conceive it, is not a hearing in which the college must prove

48
the validity of its reasons ,

The purpose of the hearing is

literally vh&t the due process clause says, to give the
teacher an opportunity to be hoard.

That is to say, the

college must tell him in sufficient detail so that he knows
what he's responding to why they propose to non-renew him.

Having told, him that, he then is afforded an oppor­
tunity to present whatever evidence he has for his cause, to
persuade them otherwise,
Mow, there's no evidence of proof here, and no
finding to be made, the college will ultimately make the
decision, just as they would have before.

And wherever they

had discretion, they still have it.
But at least he would have had the benefit of
putting before them those facts and those arguments which he
thinks could persuade them to go the other way.
Q

You wouldn't think that after a hearing such as

that there would bo any room for judicial review in those
cases?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Only as it now exists.

The

Constitution does prescribe certain limited areas where -~
Q

And your client, in fact, he wasn't hired

fired or discharged or not renewed for Reason A, but actually
for Reason 3, which exists now?
MR, GOTTESMAN: That exists now, and it would exist
then.

I might say we filed the yellow brief in the Roth
case, in which we explored,

all the counter arguments, because

that case was accelerated, it was only filed, I think, last

Friday, and the Court may not have had a chance to read it,
but itvs the only document, I think, that systematically tries
to respond to the argument thrown up against hearings as being
burdensome and so am'
And we urge the Court to see that.
Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Gottesman.

Thank you, Mr* Shafer.
