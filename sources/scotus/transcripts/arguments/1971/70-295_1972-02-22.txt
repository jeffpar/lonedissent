MR„ CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next in No. 70-295, First National City Bank against Banco
Nacional De Cuba.
Mr. Barfield, you may proceed whenever you. * re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT' OF HENRY BARFIELD, ESQ» ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BARFIELDs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case brings up for review a decision by a
divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
The Solicitor General said of that decision:

that it seriously

impairs the power of the Executive over the control of foreign
affairs.
The case may be stated very briefly.

The material

facts are not in dispute.
In September 1960, the Petitioner, First National City
Bank, owned and operated 11 branches in Cuba.

On the night of

Friday, September 16, 1960, the Cuban Government seized those
branches.

The "instrumentalities it used were its armed militia

and the Banco Nacional de Cuba, the respondent here.
On the following day, Saturday, there was a radio
announcement that the confiscation of American banks had
occurred by reason of Executive Power Resolution No. 2, issued
under Cuban law 851,

4
On the opening of business on Monday, September 19th,
the respondent in this case was in full possession of
petitioner's foreign branches, and it was the respondent that
served formal notice of confiscation on the resident vice
president of the petitioner, who had been summoned to the
petitioner's former main branch for that purpose.
On the following day the petitioner cabled the
respondent, referring to the seizure of the branches, and stating
We have exercised our rights of lien and offset and closed
your accounts as of September 17th.
Now, among those accounts was a loan account which
had originally been made in 1958, and this was a loan made by
this petitioner to the Government of Cuba here in New York
City,
The borrower was a Cuban Government instrumentality
called Bandes, and collateral for the loan was pledged by
another Cuban Government instrumentality called'Pondo, and
a third Cuban Government .instrumentality, the respondent in
this case, 'acted as the fiscal agent for the government in
connection'with thin.
On September 21 and 22, we’re still operating bn
the five-day compass, the petitioner sold the collateral that
was in New York, and after crediting the respondent the amount
of principal and interest on the loan, there remained on the
petitioner11 s books in New York a balance of just about two

miI1ion do1Xars.
Two months later, in November of I960, the
respondent instituted this lawsuit in the United States Distric
Court for the Southern District of New York to recover that
balancec

Arid as a defense, counterclaim and setoff, petitioner

showed that the value of the confiscated branches exceeded
the amount claimed by the respondent.
X pause here to say that there is no dispute as to
this value.

The parties have stipulated that if the petitioner

is lawfully entitled to the offset claimed by it, the amount
is such that the respondent shall taka nothing in this action.
0

Mr. Barfield, just as a matter of practicality,

suppose that the respondent prevails here, what happens to the
two million dollars?
MR. BARFIELD;

2 take it that the two million

dollars would —- you mean that, in a sense, physically, would
it be remitted to Cuba?
Q

Well, does the Banco Nacional get the two

million?
MS. HARPXELD:

Well, I take it that any recovery by

Banco Nacional would be for the benefit of the Cuban Government
Because Banco Nacional is, at least at this point, completely
integrated into the Cuban monolithic system.
Mow, there is a blocking system as to the —
Q

It is this to which my question is directed.

MR, HARFlBbDs

Yes»

My understanding is that the

judgment — if judo:,;ant were awarded to Banco Nacional de Cuba,
that the amount of that judgment would be subjected to freezing
under Executive Order; that is to say it would be credited to a
blocked account,.preferably to the same bank, until the
government roaches a policy, which it has not yet done, as to
what if anything is going to happen to the blocked Cuban
property.
But 1 believe it is correct that the amount of that
judgment less an allowance for attorney3s fees for the
successful plaintiff, which I am given to understand is allowed,
would be frozen abiding the event ultimately of the dispostion
to Cuba be prepared,,
Q

Well, my next question would be;

respondent fighting sc hard for it?

Why is the

And perhaps that's a

question 1*11 ask Mr. Rabinowits rather than you.
MR. KARFIEX.D:

1 can — there are two million, good

reason why the respondent is fighting — I mean why the
petitioner is fighting so hard.
Well, let me just continue, if I may, because the
time sequence that l?ve been, perhaps, boring you with is, I
believe, important in this case.
The case was submitted on cross-motion for summary
judgment in July of 1961, but was not decided until late June
1967.

Meanwhile,

m €i

this was not indolence on the part of the

D i 81 ri ce Jud ge

- meanwhile, the Sabbatino case had been

decided by this Court,

thereafter the Congress had enacted

the Hiekenloopar eswrclments to the Foreign Assistance Act?
the Sabbatino litigation had gone back to the Southern District
of New Cork,

sub nomina the Banco Hacionul v. Farr» and was

there decided.
And so. consistently with its decision in that Farr
case, the District Court in this case held that Cuba's
confiscation of American property violated international law
and that the petitioner was entitled to its offset.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision in. the
Farr case., explicitly holding that the Cuban confiscations
were in violation of international law, but reversed the
decision in this case

on the grounds that the Act of State

doctrine precluded it from inquiring into the validity or
even the consequences of those same acts.
How,, it was at that stage that the State Department
transmitted to this Court its views that important considera­
tions of foreign policy should preclude the application of the
Act of State doctrine to cases like the instant one*
This Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment,
remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration
in the light of the views of the Department of State.

And

the court below, nevertheless, Judge Hays dissenting, determined
to adhere to its original decision? and this Court granted

9

certiorari on October 12th, 1371.
Nowf I begin with the proposition that the Act of
State doctrine was not to seek as a device to create an
unfair advantage of foreign governments that come into our
courts as suitors.
In this case., to cut off the petitioner’s legitimate
defense would be manifestly unfair.
Moreover, the Executive Branch, and I’m quoting, has
made clear its views that application of the Act of State
doctrine would be inimitable to the significant policy interest
of the United States.
Q

Mr. Harfield, historically, where did the Act

of State doctrine originate?

Did it originate in the courts

or in the
MR. HARPIELD %

It originated in the courts, Mr. Chief

Justice,
Q

On suggestion from what source?

MR. HARFIELD:

I think it was -- it was not precisely

on the suggestion from the Executive, but: it is so interrelated
that
Q

But it's a doctrine of comity*, is it not, as

between the branches?
MR, HARFIELDt

It’s a doctrine of comity as between

branches, as well as between -Q

Governments,

9
MR. EARFXEhDs
Q

— nations? as between governments.

But, internally, within our own framework, it's

a doctrine of comity of the courts giving deference to the
overriding responsibilities of the Executive in relation to
foreign policy? is that not correct?
MR. H&RFIELD:

X believe that's exactly correct.

And X shall, indeed repeat — the reason for repeating
is that X felt very succinctly I should elaborate that fact is,
as X go on, because X think that the extraordinary position we
find ourselves in in this case is that a doctrine which was
conceived, as the Chief Justice says, as between — comity
between branches as well as between nations, and which clearly
was conceived for the benefit of the coordinate branches of
our own government, is now attempted to be used as a weapon
to create divisiveness

among the coordinate branches.

This is perhaps, in my judgment, the singlemost
important issue in the case at this particular stage.

And it

goes beyond simply the recognition of the fact that the
doctrine conceived in coordinate comity is now to be used as a
lethal weapon.

It offends as well — its application in this

case would offend as wall the position of the Legislative
Branch,,

Because, clearly, one of the interests that the United
to
— interests of the United States ,/which the government, our

government has referred in its amicus brief here, is respect
for international law.

10
And our government has repeatedly emphasised that
principle, of international law which says that the right of
a sovereign to expropriate property is coupled with the obliga­
tion to pay for it? to make prompt, adequate, and effective
compensation„
In this case, Cuba has defaulted on that obligation,
and it3s indebted to this petitioner just as surely as if it
had defaulted on a promissory note for a bond.
in the National City Bank v« Republic-of China, this
Court sustained a defense, counterclaim, and setoff, based or
a defaulted obligation of a foreign government that entered our
courts as a suit.
Now, the respondent has argued that the Republic of
China is not an Act of State case, because the words “act of
state" weren’t used.

And besides that, at one point in the

brief, the respondent has pointed out that a mere, a mere default
by a foreign sovereign may not be sufficiently regarded to be
an Act of State.
But if the Republic of China is not an Act of State
ease, then this is not an Act of State case, because what we're
talking about here is the repudiation of an obligation by a
foreign government that thereafter comes in here and attempts
to seek our law, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said, clear of any
defenses? don't listen to those fellows that say they have a
defense.

11
Th& Act o£ Btati doctrine was not intended for that
purpose, and 1 point out that in the area of comity between
nations the Act of state doctrine was devised to avoid a friction
there which would» either because our courts had no power or
because they chose not to exercise their jurisdiction, that might
call in question the validity and the affect of acts fully
executed by a foreign government within its own territory*
But to refuse to apply the Act of State doctrine in
this case does not result in any reversal of any physical
act that took place in Cuba»

It doesn't call in question any

of the security of titles in international trade.

We're

simply talking about an offset.
And the refusal to apply the doctrine would be
consistent with the policy and interest of the United States,
as declared both by the Legislative and the Executive Branches.
The importance of that policy, I suggest, is under­
scored by the so-called Hickenlooper amendments.

These adopt

as the law of'the United States the international law principle
of compensation for the taking of property.

Moreover, they

specify that whan there is a violation of international law,
including but not limited to violation of the principle of
compensation, then the Act of State doctrine shall not be
applicable.
In this ease the respondent asserts this Act of State
doctrine as

e,

defense, as a defense against the petitioner's

counterclaim,

new, if the respondent, has violated the

principles of international law. it is not entitled to assert
that defense in this.; Court.
The Court of Appeals, the court below? in the Second
Circuit reached the same conclusion, the conclusion that Caban
Law 851 was a violation of international law in the Farr case?
and it reached that conclusion in a decision which this Court
left undisturbed.
In this case — even in this case? the court below?
the majority did not question the fact that under Cuban Law
851 Cuba was acting in violation of international law.
So, in view of the fact that Cuba's confiscations had
been held by our courts to be unlawful? the respondent should
not be entitled to defend on that ground the Act of State
doctrine.
Q

Mr. Harfield, under Rule 13, my understanding is

that counterclaims Eire limited to those against opposing
partiesj and here, as 1 understand? Banco Nacional was the
plaintiff and you have asserted a counterclaim that basically,
as 1 understand, goes against the Government of Cuba rather
than Banco Nacional.

And the District Court ruled in your

favor on summary judgment? and the Court of Appeals didn’t
pass on the District Court ruling.
Do you contend here that that was a proper summary
adjudication in the District Court? that they’re one and the

13
same?
MR . ER RF1;?} -D s
Q

Yes, X do , Y'onr HOno r.

On what basis?

MR. HARFIELDs

Well, on two bases.

To begin with,

that on the record before it, and X would contend that there
was more than adequate evidence, the Banco N&cionai had been
totally absorbed into the Cuban Government, so that it was
indistinguishable.

If it ever had been, as the respondent

argues, an autonomous institution, it lost that autonomy
before the events here, because, as the respondent has said,
as Cuba was in the process of changing into a socialist state
it took all the necessary steps to destroy autonomy.
But, most importantly, in this case the role of
Banco NacionaX has at all times bean that of an agent for the
Cuban Government.

And that's why I elaborated as much as I.

did at the outset of my remarks that the collateral, the
proceeds of which are now in suit, was pledged by Fondo,
which was part of the Cuban Government.
The Banco Nacionai, in handling the proceeds of that
loan, and in handling the collateral, was acting for the Cuban
Government.

And you have a perfect opposition, because there

is no doubt that if there is a recovery for the — by the
respondent here, that the sole beneficiary will ba the Cuban
Government.

Unless, as Mr. Justice Blackmvm says, our

government intervenes at some point.

But we must not. antici-

14
pats that.
0

Nall*, what would —

MR. HARP I ELD ?

I think there’s perfect opposition

to the parties.

Q

Let me go back, then,

;o my previous questioni

What is — and I ask this for instruction -» what is the usual
routine when assets are frozen under circumstances of this
kind?

Are claims eventually filed an 3 then, the frozen assets

perhaps allocated among those claims
MR. BARFIELDs

:hat are allowed?

Well, I thin: that there really is no

such thing as a usual procedure.

In this case the offset taken by this petitioner
occurred three years — and this case, this suit was started
about three years before there was any government action
freezing Cuban assets.

So 1 point out in passing that if

this petitioner had not exercise its

right, of offset, then

the response to your question, sir, would have been that the
money had probably gone down to Cuba and been used to pay
Chinese technicians.

>
Because the blocking did not occur until about three
years a f ta rward.
How, at that stage, Cuban assets in this country were
frozen, but they were not vested, they were not seised.

And

thereafter, after the freezing, a system of claim submission
was safe up under the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission.

This was about four years after these transactions.
This petitioner filed its as sim with the Foreign
Claims Settlement Commission, assertir, 3 the taking of its
properties in Cuba, and assigning a veLue to it.

It then

deducted from the amount it was filing as a claim the amount
of its offset in this case.

In other

?ords, credited Cuba with

it.
And the Foreign Claims Sett2 ament Commission has
allowed the petitioner's claim, after deducting from the claim
the amount of this offset.

So, in efface, they have regarded,

the Foreign Claims Settlement Commissi on has regarded this
petitioner as already having recouped bo the extent of its
counterclaim.
Q

But before these funds would be available to

pay people whose claims had been filec and been allowed,
there would have to be a vesting, wouldn’t there?
MR. BARFIELD:
Q

In addition to a ~~

MR. BARFIELD:
Q

That is correct.

In addition to the freeze.

*— to a freeze.

MR. BARFIELD:

And I may say, Mr. Justice White, that

at the time that the freeze was being put on there was
considerable discussion in Congress as to whether the freeze
should be moved to that second step ft r vesting, and the
decision was not. to do it, at least at that time, because to

IS
take that property, that of private paople as well as Cuban
Government people* world have been r- yarded by certain members
of Congress as the same kind of sin c f which Castro had been
guilty.
So there are the two steps shat you mention, and our
government has not yet taken that sec >nd step.
0

Welle of course, lurk;ig in the background are

the other claimants who profess to fcs victims of Cuban
expropriation.- aren't there?
MR. HARP1ELDs
Q

Yes.

And I suppose it’s the .r position that if you

prevail here., City Bank is enjoying £ windfall?
MR. HARPIELDs Well, 1 think that may be a position.
I would certainly say that it is not a position that should be
regarded very well.
Because, as Mr. Justice Whi :e has pointed out, our
government has not yet decided that i ; is going to treat Cuba
as if it were bankrupt estate.
But even if it did, all of
Bankruptcy Act entitles a person who

-.he learning under the
,s secured by reason of

existing relationships, of having col .ateral, having liens,
that person is entitled to a preferen :e by law.

And, surely,

a secured creditor always has a prefe ence over an unsecured
creditor.
But this in a preference wh eh has been certainly

condoned, if not applauded.

And this, if you equate this to

bankruptcy, then we;'re exactly in the position of having
exorcised a setoff which, under Section 68 of the Bankruptcy
law, is solid»
Q

Do you think it makes any difference that this

security that you hold was not part of any security transaction
that relates to the expropriation in Cuba?
MR. BARFIELD:

I would think not.

X think that my

understanding of the law with respect to offsets and counter­
claims is that you simply net the accounts between the parties,
and not, certainly in New York where this offset was exercised,
not for over 100 years has there been the necessity of
parceling this out on a precise basia.

What you do is to —

you don't have to counterclaim, you don't have to offset in
respect of the identical transaction,,
Q

But the Court of Appeals disposed of this case

on another ground, didn't reach this ground and several other
issues.
MR. HARFIELDs

That is correct.

The Court of Appeals
Q

And this issue would only arise if you won this

case on the issue that's here, and we were in the process of
determining whether to decide these other questions here or
remand?
MR. BARFIELDs

Yes.

Or to reinstate the judgment

18
of the District -Court.
I really'have very little to add at this time,

I'd

like to reserve it.
I'm going to make just one last point on the Act of
State doctrine, which is the point t>.t we came here on. the
point that the majority below dealt >/ ,th„
And t suggest that any don>: as to the applicability
of the doctrine to this case» at fchitime, has bear? removed
by the supervening expression of the Executive? and that is an
expression of the Executive as to fchs foreign, policy interest
of the United States.
How, the position of the Ur. .ted States in this case
is crystal-clearp I think there is v.:-- dispute at all as to what
that position is.
But the respondent would, ?:rom his brief, appear to
have this Court believe that the Executive is invading the
province of the Judicial Branch.

An: 1 suggest that precisely

the opposite is true.
Judge.Hays said, in dissent below, the majority of
the court below by applying the Act : I State doctrine, after
an independent evaluation of the merius of the State Depart­
ment's position, is usurping the sams Executive function which
it is the — same Executive prerogati fe, which it is the function
of that doctrine to preserve.
The constitutional mandate

;o the Judicial Branch is

19
to decide casee , and where there is e concern that the

Judicial Branch might transgress on th» exclusive province of
the Exeeutive, in the conduct of foreign affairs, there is an
abstention on the part of the Judicial Branch. find where the
Executive is silent,» than encroachment is presumed, and the
Judiciary tends to abstain,
But here the Executive has £ armally declared that
the foreign policy interests of the United States will be
furthered through the exercise by fchia Court of its normal
function, in the resolution of eases b5fore it.
And in the light of that declaration, X would
suggest that abstention is not neutrality.

It is, as the

Solicitor General has said, a serious impairment of the power
of the Executive to control foreign affairs.
Now, the doctrine of separation of powers can
scarcely be regarded as a requirement of internecine confronta­
tion between coordinate branches of tha same government for
the benefit of an unfriendly government.
•

At feha

t in this case tier© is no doubt that

application of the Act of State doctrine will further the
foreign policy interest of Cuba.

Bui. I suggest to you that it

is inescapably true that it will frustrate the foreign policy
interests of'the United States.
And 1 urge that the doctrine is not applicable to
this case, and it should not be applied to this.ease, and that

20
the judgment of the court below should be .reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Harfield.
Mr» Rabinowits«
ORAL ARGUMENT- OF VICTCIi RABXNOWXTZ, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BAB-fNOWITSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I would like, preliminarily

to address myself to two

questions that ware placed by —» one ? -y Mr. Justice Blackman
and the other by Mr. Justice Relinquish.

And while they are

preliminary and* in a sense, peripheral issues, at least one
of them may be dispositive of the case.
Mr. Justice Blackmun, 1 don't know why the respondent
is fighting so hard in this case.

A1‘.

instructions to fight hard in this' an-:

X know is that 2 have
all of the other cases

which will involve an increase in the amount of the frozen
fundso
Now, those funds were froze? by the Executive Branch
of the government, and unless they arc unfrozen by the Executive
Branch of the government, or perhaps

y Congress, they’re

going to remain frozen and will not g: to Cuba, and there is
no possibility at all of them getting to Cuba, short of an
action by the Executive Branch or the Legislative Branch, and
perhaps that means short of some sett emeat of the general
dispute between the United States and Cuba, which may come at

21
some time in the future•

X assume we all hope that some day

it will corns.
But until that day comes, I think if may be
reasonably certain that those funds will remain frozen.
Q

Perhaps it might be no: unreasonable to ask, then,

if your position is that this is just to go into the pool?
MR. RABXNOWITZs
Q

Of course,

And in that case, then, why is the Cuban Bank

so concerned about this?
MR. RABXN0WXT2 %

We want to argue and speculate —

I’m not authorised to speculate; and, given the general public
interest and the fact that we are dealing with intergovernmental
relations, X prefer not to.

X don’t know, or X could only

guess as to why the Cuban Government is interested in carrying
on this,, .and, as I say, a great deal 3f other litigation.
X think that something may oe said in response to
Justice Bl&ckraun’s request for information a little while ago.
Namely, about vrhat happens to these frozen funds.

And what

1 can tell you is not what will happen in the future, but what
has happened in the past.

It happened with respect to the

Soviet Union, it happened with respect to Yugoslavia, with
«

respect to Romani®, with respect to a half a dozen other
similar situations.
The frozen funds ware collected, they remained in
blocked accounts until one day there was a settlement; and

22
those funds were then used to pay off all creditors.
of course.

In part,

And that is- discussed and is the reason for part

of the decision of the Court of Appeals below, and 1 think the
first Court of Appeals opinion.

And it is a reason, and I

think a perfectly valid reason, for commenting that in this
case the petitioner is seeking a wine:fail — I would prefer
to sail it a preference,

A preference over all other persons

who may have claims, and whose only logical salvage, the only
way in which they might possibly some day get some return, is
through a large frozen fund.
Now, whether my client has that in mind, X do not
know, because 1 haven't been told.

And, as 1 say, I prefer

not to guess about these things.
But at least in factual terns and looking at it
historically, that is what happened in the case of the other
matters that I referred to, the eastern European countries
generally, and 1 suppose that is the theory upon which the
funds were frosen in this case.
Mr. Justice White is right, these funds have not
vested, as a matter of fact there was a law passed in, X think,
1963 vesting the funds, and it was repealed a year later. So
that at present the funds are not vested, they’re just held
in an account. And you can’t get money out of the account
without a license from the Treasury Department? and I assure
you those licenses are not freely granted.

Q

Well, 1 cm. understand your not wanting to

speculate about the policies of your client, because that
but
you care to speculate on why the Court remanded the case to
the Court of Appeals for consideration of the State Department's
views?

m» RABIMOWITZ:

Oh, I'll get to that, Year Honor,

I certainly will got to the State Department's position here,
Shat has nothing to do -with the foreign policy of the United —
of Cuba, it has to do with the foreign policy of the United
States„ and which 2 feel quite free to speculate, since no one
would suggest I'm expressing the views of the government * of
the United States Government.
So I will get to that in just a moment.
S would also like, preliminarily, to say, in response
to Mr, Justice Rehnqulst*s question about this counterclaim
matters

Wa do contend, as was suggested, that Banco Nacional

is an autonomous government agency, much as, 1 think we have
about SO autonomous government agencies here in the United
States»
Ho one, 1 think, would contend that if the ExportImport Bank brought a claim against anyone that he would have
the right to counterclaim against the Government of the United
States.

Even though the funds of the Export-Import Bank all

come ultimately from the Treasury of the United States? even

24
though the Export*»Import Bank has a board of directors and
which is controlled er.elusively by the United States t even though
thv;

j;-;m eated it by sta

id is the sole stock-

holder, nevertheless it is an autonomous government agency,
just as Banco Nacional is an autonomous government agency.
And I think that the record is clear on that, and
while 1 think it is a point which would ba dispositive of this
case, I don't think it's what we’re hera for, to discuss.
I would urge the Court, as 1 have in Point V of my
brief, to decide the case on that point.

It would be a

disposition of the matter in favor of my client.

It would

avoid all of these other difficult international law problems,
and of course my client and I would like it,* and I hops the
Court is so disposed.
But; if it is not, then, obviously, there are other
points which are of much greater consequence.
In the petitioner’s reply brief, at page 2, he
suggests that there are in general two big issues in this case.
And if I may reverse the order of those issues and phrase them
a little less tendentiously, I would agree, and I would formulate
the issues as followst

In the circumstances of this case, does the Act of
State doctrine preclude the Court from considering the
petitioner’s claim that the respondent acted in violation of
international law?

That's the Sabbatino point, really

25
And it's discussed in Points X to IV of respondent's briefa
And point twos

If this is answered'in the negative,

was the nationalisation of petitioner’s property by the
Republic of Cuba a violation of international law?

And this is

treated in Points, I think, VI or V1T of my brief and the
appendix.
Now, the Act of State doctrine has been a part of our
law at least since 1097, Underhill v. Hernandez, and the
Supreme Court, this Court, in Sabbatino, traced the doctrine
back to English precedents, running back 300 years.
The most recent exposition, of course, was the
Sabfoatl.no decision, in 1964, in which this Court, in an 8 to 1
opinioh, upheld the doctrine and discussed, X think, most of
the reasons for the doctrine in great detail.
And X will not repeat the reasons for that decision,
the reasons for the Act of State doctrine, because it would
involve largely extensive quotations from this Court's
opinion in Sabbatino, and X know that the members of the bench
are familiar with it, and there's no point in my doing it.
Except to say that 1 submit that it's a. sound doctrine, which
is designed to keep this Court out of the consideration of the
second question; namely, was there a violation of international
law here.
Not because the second question is hard to decide, this Court gets lots of cases that are hard to decide; and not

26
because it's important, because this Court gets lots of cases
that are important.

But because it necessarily involves

political consideration, political questions which are best
left to the Executive Branch of the government.
And X think some of the implications of this will
appear in the rest of my argument,
Q

Well, hasn’t the Executive Branch indicated

that they would prefer to have the Judicial Branch just go ahead
and decide this lawsuit?
MR, RABINGWXTB:

It has in this case.

Sabbafcino case it said exactly the opposite,

In the

What the next

Administration will say, X do not know,
X£ there is one thing which is certain about our
form of government, and which is not, perhaps, true in many
places in the world today, is that its Administrations change,
and that policies change.

And just as Mr, Deputy Attorney

General Kat&enbach stood at this podium seven years ago and
said?

Do not extend the Bernstein doctrine, we do not want

the Bernstein doctrine extended; it ia embarrassment to our
government to extend the Bernstein doctrine.

So we find the

Solicitor General today expressing a contrary opinion, and
what tomorrow's Solicitor General or legal adviser to the
State Department will say, X don't know.
Now, it is perfectly reasonable and proper for
Administrations to differ in policy.

We expect that.

That’s

2?
why we have elections, and that's why one person rather than
another is elected President and appoints his legal.adviser
and his Solicitor General a
It is quite another thing to expect this Court to
\

follow in the steps of the Administration, in that sense•

This

Court is not equipped to, is not. expected to, and was not
intended by the Constitution to be an instrument of the foreign
policy of the United States, any more than it is an instrument
of the domestic policy of the United States.
This Court is to decide things on the basis of law.
And the law, unless this Court is prepared to reverse
Sabbatino, the law is the Sabbatino case.

And on the basis

of the Sabbatino case, this Court has said, and I can think of
no better way of saying it than the way Mr. Justice Harlan did;
he said?

tha Act of State doctrine has constitutional under­

pinning? it arises out of the basic relationships between
branches of government in a system of separation of powers.
It turns the competency of dissimilar institutions to make and
implement particular kinds of decisions in the area of inter­
national relations.
The doctrine as formalted in past decisions expresses
the strong sense of the Judicial Branch, that its engagement in
the past, of passing on the validity cf foreign Acts of State,
may hinder rather than further this country's pursuit of goals„
both for itself and for the community of nations as a whole

28

the international sphere.
Slow, 1 know that the legal adviser to the State
Department now disagrees with that, and, as a matter of fact,
the next sentence in Mr., Justice Harlan's opinion is:

Many

commentators disagree with this view.
1 know that they disagree with this view.

One of the

persons who disagrees with this view is Mr. Justice White,
but the fact is that the Sabbatj.no decision discussed all of
this, and discussed it in considerable detail, and came to a
conclusion which, I submit, is as sound today as it was in

1964.
Q

I agree with you.

MR. R&BXMGWIT2s

Thank you.

I knew you would, Your

Honori
[Laughter.J
It is not within the competency of this Court, with
all due respect to it, to get involved in complicated and
difficult questions involving the application of the inter­
national policy of the United States.
Now, let me give you an example which is not
hypothetical at all.
in, 1 think, 1960.

The Cuban expropriations here took place
Almost immediately the State Department

issued a statement sayings

these confiscations are violations

of international law.
The State departments always do that in this kind of

29
a situation, and I assume it is done in pursuit of the foreign
policy of the United States.

These confiscations are illegal.

Now, we are here, ten year,* eleven years later —
we could have, under other circumstances, been here sooner.
And one of the issues that is presented to this Court iss
Were those confiscations violations of international law?
Suppose this Court, after consideration of the law,
should be impelled, as I would urge it to do, to hold that it
was not a violation of international law at all.

This Court

would then be placed in a position of having to disagree with
the State Department on a question on which the State Department
had expressed itself, not once but many times.
And 1 submit that this Court should not be placed in
that position. This Court should not be placed in a position
where it may be called upon to express opinion on questions of
international law which are contrary to the opinions expressed
by the Executive Branch in pursuit of its foreign policy,
not this Court’s foreign policy but the Executive Branch’s
foreign policy? because that’s its responsibility.
And; this Court ought not to be placed in a position'
where it has that responsibility which, as 1 say with all
respect to this Court, it is not equipped to account.
Q

Mr. Rabinowitz.

MR. RABINOWITZ?
Q

Yes, sir?

It is my understanding, both from the Courts

30
below and from one of the briefs here, that the Act. of State
doctrine is an exception to the general rule of The Paguete
Habana, that generally courts of the United States do decide
questions of international law, unless the Act of State doctrine
exception applies.
You're not suggesting that the Act of State doctrine
simply swallows up that general rule, are you?
MR, RABXNOW2TJ5s

Oh, no, sir.

Ho, sir,

Q You're limiting it to questions of the validity of
the government — of the laws of foreign governments?
i” V

MR, RABXMOWXT53;

I’m limiting it to the question of

the validity of the acts of a foreign sovereign done within its
territory.
And, as I say, it does seem to ms that the position
that the petitioner here is advocating raises this very serioue:
danger in connection with the separation of power.
Now, this case is exactly — I might,just to dispose
for a moment of this Hickenlooper amendment point, 1 don't know
whether it’s really argued seriously.
The Hickenlooper amendment is drawn in very, very
narrow language. The language is very hard to understand.

And

I'm not going to try to read it hare, it’s going to require
very careful study, and I’ve tried to analyse it ip. my brief,
to fea of assistance to
don© in oral argument.

31
■i!he Court of Appeals held; and here the court was
unanimous, that the Hickenlooper amendment does not apply to
this kind of situation at all, it was never intended to apply
to this situation.

The Court of Appeals for the state of Mew

York has also held that the Hickenlooper amendment is to he
given a very narrow reading, and did not apply to a situation
before it in the French case»
So that the Hickenlooper amendment, X really don't
think has anything to do with this case, and I think this Court,
when it gets to analysing it in detail, will come to the same
conclusion«
What is ranch more important is not the Hickenlooper
amendment but the letter of Mr. Stevenson.
■:

Mr. Rabinowitz, in connection with the Hicken-

looper amendment, if we had a ease here that clearly and
admittedly fell within the scope of the Hickenlooper amendment,
so that, if you can imagine one upon which yon v/oiildn't dis­
agree, would your argument be that, the amendment is
unconstitutional?
MR. RABINOWITZ:
Q

1 have argued so.

Yes. And you must, in order to sustain your

position, you've already stated, X take it —
MR. RABINOWITZ;
Q

Yes.

— because you couldn't accept Congress's

direction for the courts to, as you would put it, invade the

32
sphere of the Executive.
MS. RABIHOWITEs Thank you, Your Honor, you have
expressed it even better than 1 did.
Q

ves.

MR. R&BIN0WIT2:

I agree.

I think the Hickenlooper

amendment is unconstitutional because it's an effort on the p
of Congress to tell this Court what it may or may not do.
G

But if it isn't, then it is rather relevant to

this case, even if it doesn’t apply, I take it?
MR. RABIN0WIT2:

No, sir.

If it doesn't apply, I

don't think it’s relevant.
Q

Well, it's rather a vast fundamental expressioi

by Congress to the relationship between the courts and the
Executive, and what the Judicial job is, for example.
MR. RABIHGWITS;

Well, it is a direction to this

Court which, if constitutional, I suppose this Court has to
follow, that in certain kinds of cases — not this kind, but
other kinds of cases •— the Act of State doctrine shall foe
suspended.
Q

Other cases in which even more severely might

represent some threat to the ■—
MR. RABINGWITZ;
Q

— foreign policy.

MR. RABINOWITZ :

0

Might.

Yes.

I suppose —

/
'

33
MR. RA8IM3WIT2%

— that would be quit*» possible.

NOw# we have here an expression by the legal advisor
to the State Department# which seeks to undercut the Act of
State doctrine.

And while the legal advisor limits his

contention or his letter to counterclaims, X really don't under­
stand why, because all of his arguments go to any kind of
claim.
But once we eliminate the counterclaim element, there
is nothing new about this proposal.

The proposal, in effect,

is a suggestion that the Executive Branch of the government
shall have the right to tell the Court either to apply or not
to apply the Act of State doctrine.
Now, that's not a new proposal.

It was made first

when Mr. Stevenson was chairman of the International Law
Committee of the Bar Association of the City of New York, in
1959« it was repeated by Mr. Stevenson when he was writing
for the American Journal of International Law in about 1963.
It was discussed by the Court in the Sabbata.no case.

It is# as

I read it, a position that is endorsed by Mr. Justice White,
or was in his opinion, in his dissenting opinion? and it was
opposed# it was opposed most vigorously by the — by Mr,
Kafczenbach and by Mr. *— and by the Solicitor General in the
last Administration.

And the Court, in the Sabbafclno case#

disapproved it.
And it disapproved it for reasons that are set forth

34
in the Sabbatino decision.

And nothing new has happened*

except that, whereas the last Administration had said this is
not a business for the Executive Branch or the Court at all,
and we’ll take care of our own foreign policy; we don’t need
the Courts to gat mixed up in it, because who knows how the
Court is going to decide?

It's really uncontrollable.

We don’t know how the Court is going to decide any
particular question, and therefore we would sooner that the
Court stay out.

And it referred over and over again to the

possibility of embarrassment to the Executive Branch because
we don’t know how the Court will decide the case,
Now this Administration differs,

ted while, as X

say, Mr. Stevenson of course is quits consistent, he took this
position while in private practice, he took this position as
editor of the Journal, and he takes this position now; and
it’s quits proper that he should be consistent, and it’s quite
proper that the Administration should change when the Administra
tion changes.
But that is not the problem of this Court.

The

problem of this Court is to apply a doctrine which is 80 years
old at least, in our Courts, and which was most recently
affirmed in 8abbatino, and no new reasons have been suggested
why that doctrine should not be applied at this point.
Now, once we get past, if this Court should decide
that the Act of State doctrine is not to be applied, —

35
Q

Let me ask you one question, Mr. Rabinowitz.

MR, RABINOWITZ :
Q

Surely.

Do you say that Bernstein is inconsistent with

Sabbatino and must have been disapproved by implication in
Sabbatino?
MR. RABINOWITZ;
was a freak.

I think not.

I think that Bernstein

I think the case was a sport.

It arose in a

situation which is very difficult to duplicate.

The facts

were most unusual and it's one of those cases which, because it
involved the Hitler Government, because it involved terrible
excesses against persons of Jewish faith, the seizure of
property under circumstances which we’re all familiar with,
and because the government was no longer in existence, presented
a situation which, as I say, is sui generis.

It’s its own

situation.
And this is exactly — I mean this isn’t my idea?
this is exactly — it’s not only my idea —- this is exactly what
the Solicitor General said in the brief he submitted in
Sabbatino.

He said it’s an exceedingly

narrow situation,

and 1 commend the reading of that brief .to Your Honors.
an exceedingly narrow case.

It’s

It ought not to be extended at all.

It arose out of very unusual facts, which are net duplicated
here? and this Court, the Supreme Court, has never passed on
it.

In effect, let’s let it rest.

Let’s not resurrect it.

And, as I read the Sabbatino opinion, that’s what

36
the Sabbatino court said also.
be extended.

It said Bernstein ought not to

It happened a long time ago, leave it alone? it

gives us no lessons for a different situation.
So that while I think the Sabbatino case is not
inconsistent with Bernstein, at least it says leave Bernstein
alone, don’t extend it any further.
If this Court, for one reason or another, decides
that- it will go into the question of the legality of the Cuban
expropriations, that of course is the question that under
Sabbatino we shouldn't be discussing at all.

I

attempted in

my brief to discuss the nature of international law and what
the practice of nations has been.
International law is supposed to be the practice of
nations, not the practice of the United States and Great
Britain, but the practice of all nations, including the Soviet
Union and Indonesia and China and the whole entity that we in
general terms now call the Third World, or the Developing
Nations, or, as Mr. Justice Harlan said, the capital importing
nations.
And I have attempted in an appendix to do a job
which I hope was as good as I could do, with the facilities
I had, to show that the. practice of nations is by no means
clear.

And again this was not my thought, because that's what

this Court again said in Sabbatino, that there’s wiped out
about whether an expropriation under these circumstances is a

37
violation of international law, because there is grave doubt
as to what is the practice of nations.

Not the morality, not

the Fifth Amendment or the due process legality of these
expropriations but the practice of these expropriations.
q

Did you go into the

give your view of the

legality under international law of discriminatory expropria­
tion?
MR. RABINOWITZt

I don't know that I discussed that,

but,{Your Honor, there is no ~ I’m glad you raised that —
there is no suggestion in this record that this was a
discriminatory expropriation.

Every Cuban bank was expropriated

at the same time as the American — a couple
perhaps — as the American banks were.

of days later

This was part of a

transformation of a government from a —
Q

Would you say the same thing in Sabbatino?

MR. RABINOWITZ:

But — I said the same thing in

Sabbatino, but the Court, at least the Court of Appeals,
disagreed with me.
But the Court of Appeals, if the opinion will ha
read carefully the Court of Appeals — and 1 really think
this was wrong, Your Honor, of the Court of Appeals in that
case.

The Court of Appeals found it discriminatory, and it

said?

Sure, they confiscated not only American property but

Cuban property as well, but there was a difference of two
weeks.

And those two weeks were the — three weeks or a month
perhaps? but it was a difference of a few weeks in time»
And those few weeks were critical, because that was the time of
the sugar harvest; and that is what made it discriminatory,
according to the Court of Appeals in Sabbatino.
Q

Well, anyway, you don't —

MR. RABINOWITSs
Q

But there's no such thing here.

Anyway, you do not address yourself to that

issue Hi your brief here?
MR, RABXNOWITZ;

No, I do not address myself to that

issue.
Q

All right, that's all I wanted to know.

MR. RABXNOWITZs

Quite right.

1 should have, and

next time 'round I'll try to.
[Laughter.]
But I did not and 1 agree that I should have. Your
Honor.
But X don't believe that this was discriminatory,
and I don't believe that any argument can be or has been made
that it was discriminatory.
Now, as I say, the — we are not here discussing the
morality of nationalisation.

The result of any review of the

cases, of the facts, will show enormous diversity.

And. while

it is true that there have been settlements reached and
compensation paid in many of these cases, never, never has it

39
been the result of a judicial ruling, never has it been because
some court said this or that is illegal? it has been the .result
of the way we settle international disputes in this world* by
diplomatic negotiations and not by judicial interpretation,
The suggestion and the reason for the State Depart­
ment's letter in this case is that they want, the State
Department wants to protect foreign investments abroad„
And* if 1 may just have ore minute* 1 think the
Sabbatino court answered that.

If a foreign developing

country is prepared to risk breach of diplomatic relations*
freezing of assets* embargo on trade, embargo on travel* end
of all aid, and a host of other sanctions that the Executive
Branch can make, it seems to be most unlikely that it is going
to be upset by the fact that a court some time, ten years
hence, is going to say that in addition the expropriation was
illegal.
The sanctions have been applied, Cuba will not get
the money, as I pointed out a moment ago, and that ought to
take care of that, in terms of the policy of the United
States.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Rafeinowitz.

Mr. Barfield, you have five minutes left.

40
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP HENRY BARFIELD, ESQ.,
OK BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HARPIELD;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice»

I'd like to begin just by, without attempting to argue
these points, to indicate that at page IS of our reply brief
we pointed out that on October 13, 1960, and that date is
important, this was between the time that the Cuban Government
had confiscated the bank's property in Cuba and after the bank
had asserted its right of offset, which I mentioned to you
was within a matter of days.
That following that, but before the action was
commenced, the Cuban Government dissolved Fondo, which had
been the owner of this collateral that was pledged; and as we
point out, as I say, at page 15 of the reply brief, transferred
the rights of Fondo in the collateral to this respondent.
Then, when that had been done, they started the
lawsuit.
I don’t want to dwell too much on the question of the
autonomy of this respondent.

I think, and I made this point

back in the District Court days, some 11 years ago, there is a
-

■».

pretty good precedent on this, which goes back to Genesis,
and sayss

The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the

hands of Esau.
Now, I think that that is applicable in respect to
the relationship and the transactional relationship between

41
the Government of Cuba and this respondent.
Q
that.

Well, I didn't think there was much doubt about

Hr. Rabinowits sa,id he didn*t want to get into

discussing his client's foreign policy, and I don't assume
banks in Cuba have foreign policies? so I don't think we need to
dwell much on it.
MS. HARFIELD;

Thank you, Your Honor.

As to the argument about the windfall, I would refer
the Court, with respect, to page 10 of our reply brief, where
we've done the bast we can to deal with that argument, and I
won't trespass further on your time.
I want to close simply by doing what is really not my
job to do, and that is talk about the fact that there is a
great deal more that has happened since the Sabbatino case
than a change of Administration, and a great deal more in
respect of what our government has dons.
This Court x*ill surely be aware that in the SabbatAno
case the government made no expression whatsoever, and
protested against a misconstruction of what had been alleged
to be its statement.

Here it has done what it set out to do,

and is, I submit, entirely consistent in its position, as to its
function and its duty with respect to the foreign policy of the
United States and with suggestions to a coordinant branch when
it becomes appropriate to do so, and 1 think the Department has
been perfectly consistent.

42
Now, let

bis

close on this point»

has been, made here comes on two prongs»

The argument that

One of them is that

this Court should apply the Act of State doctrine

,

whether or

not it’s otherwise applicable, because its coordinant branches
of government request it not to do so, and that unless the
Court does this extraordinary thing it's going co find itself
in the position that it has to make a decision as to inter­
national law»
Well, this is the function of the Court, as was
recognised by the late Mr» Justice Harlan in Sabbatino, it's
one of the many functions? and the suggestion that the Court
must shy away from a decision of international law seems to me
perfectly absurd.
Turning then to the question of what is the inter­
national law on this issue, and again I don't want to burden
the Court, but we have a history that goes back as far as there
is any record of government policy and of acceptance by the
Judicial Branch,

The proposition that when a foreign govern­

ment takes somebody's property, particularly if it's the
property of an American, there is an implied obligation to pay
for it.
To recognise that obligation does not involve
characterising the foreign government as being a thief or a
villain? this does not really call into question the validity.
But to the extent that the validity can be called in question,

4-3
as 1 suggest it already has been, under a case which Mr.
Rabinowits agrees the Hickenlooper amendment applies to as,
say, in the Farr case, there can be no doubt.
Q

Wall, evidently — can the motives of a sovereign

ever be called into question in an expropriation?

Is it not

just the value of the property that's involved?
MR. HARFIELDs
Honor.

Well, I think that would be so, Your

Here, as I said, the value is stipulated.

The motives

may be taken into consideration where there is discrimination,
as I believe the finding has been so far of the courts in the
United States.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, Mr. Harfield.

Thank you, Mr. Rabinowitz.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2;06 osclock, p.m., the case was
submitted.]
