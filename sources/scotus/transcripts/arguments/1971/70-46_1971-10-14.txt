ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDS, ESQ,»
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, REYNOLDSs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court *

<■
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the

United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit» to
review the decision of that court reversing a judgment of
conviction by the District Court,
It presents important questions relating to the
manner in which Immigration investigators can, without
infringing on tt© individual right against salf“incrimination

4
under the Fifth Amendment, carry out their statutory
responsibility to determine whether aliens, or persons believed
to be aliens, are lawfully in the United States.
The facts are essentially theses

On the morning of November 19, 1968, approximately
eight agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
?

conducted an investigation of employees of the Rulan
Manufacturing Company in Chicago, Illinois, where it was
suspected that aliens unlawfully in the United States were
working.

\
Some 15 or 16 aliens war® arrested for being in the

country in violation of the Immigration laws, including one
Miguel Rico..

All war® placed in agents* automobiles, and, as

is customary practice, they wore driven to their respective
residences to gather their personal b@longl.rsgs»
Upon arriving at Rico's residence, at approximately
8s45 a*m., Rico and two IMS investigators, Jacobs and Burrow,
i

went to the door of his apartment.

Rico knocked and respondent

opened the door and admitted the -three men.
The agents identified themselves and explained to
respondent in Spanish that Rico had bean arrested and that they
were there to collect his personal belongings.

Mo search was

made of the premises,
Agent Burrow accompanied Rico into his room. Agent
Jacobs remained in the living room with respondent.

bates * inquired in Spanish

spondent9 & citisen-

Respondent replied that he was Mexican, and when asked

about hie alien status he stated that he was a resident alien.
Jacobs then asked for proof# and respondent produced
his alien registration receipt card, which is the identification
card that is issued by the Immigration Service, to all aliens
who have bean lawfully admitted into the country in a permanent
resident status.
Q

Is that what * s called the blues .card?

HE, REYNOLDS! The green card# Your Honor.
Q

Green card.

Q

And the alien is required to have that on him

at all times?
Mg.. REYNOLDSs

At all times# yes# Your Honor# by

statute.
Q

And to display it?

MR. REYNOLDS % The statute does not require that he
display it, the statute requires that he retain it in his
possession at all times.

And the statute does permit

interrogation of the ©lien's status by investigators; it
authorises them to request him to display it, but the statute
does not require that he display it as such.

6

Q

Wh&n you sav in his possession,, do you mean on

his person?
HR, REYNOLDSs
Q

Just like a draft card?

MR. REYNOLDS:
Q

On his person, yes, Your Honor»

Exactly.

Just like a draft card,

Could ha prove his status in sow® other way than

by displaying th® card?
ME, REYNOLDSs

Well, he could prove his statue in

.another way, although not in as direct & way perhaps.
Q

I suppose under the broad interpretation of th©

best~evidenc© rule,, th© card is th® best prima facie evidence
of his status, isn’t it?
MR. REYNOLDSs

Wall, his

is in the government’s possession.

It is information that

And if ha has a passport#

for instance# and can show that he is in th© country# has a
valid passport, and gives his name, you can determine feis statu®
from the alien registration form which is on file with th©
government.
But th® card is# I think# th® most direct way to
establish his- status.
Q

If you know, how long doss it take, as a

practical matter, to execute that, carry out that exercise?
MR. REYNOLDS: Well# X would assum® a relatively

It coul.fi his ascertained, perhaps by am agent making © phone
call, X believe# it could b® determined in a relatively short
period of time.

Q

If he had found that he didn’t have the card,

and admitted that he was illegally there, would the government

have done anything other than deport him?
MR. REYNOLDS: Well; the government could have done
something other than deport him? whether --

Q
of policy?

Would they have done anything @1©® as a matter
What is the policy?

MR. REYNOLDSs

I think as a matter of policy that

they would have done nothing other than deport him. There is
a — it 1b a misdemeanor to foe in the country illegally, and
there A® fch&t possibility.

But, as a matter of policy, the

government would have deported him.

In fact, that is what

the government did with Rico in this case.
B© was in the country unlawfully.

Q

They deported him.

They —

But they didn't in this case.

MR. REYNOLDS:

la this case, this man was indicted,

but he was indicted for possession of a forged ©lien card —
registration receipt card.
0

Weil, he was indicted for registration of a

false document required for entry into the United States.
That's one of the issues in this case, isn't it?

8
MR. REYNOLDSs
Q

For possesion of

i that dOvezcs sil alien registration card?

MR. REYNOLDS:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Jacobs inspected the alien registration receipt card
and also respondent*s social security card, which had been
produced on request.

And he showed both the cards to Agent

Burrow.
The lighting conditions were extremely poor, and on
this viewing the agents found nothing amiss.
They returned the documents to respondent, and than
left the apartment with Rico, who had by then collected, his
personal effects.
Now, respondent raises no objection to this initial
inquiry, and the Court of Appeals found that it did not violate
respondent1s Fifth Amendment privilege.

This initial inquiry

occurred in what the Court of Appeal® characterised as “the
normal immigration Inquiry situation", and thus was permissible,
the court concluded, "since the card served th© non-criminal
purpose of enabling th© government to be aware of th© number
<

of aliens in th© country, and their status.'"'
When the ©gents returned with Rico- to th® car, a
third investigator, Agent White, motioned toward another
individual approaching them, and suggested that h© had acted
suspiciously on seeing th© agents, and should be questioned.
Agent Burrow spoke to this individual, Jose

9
Rodriguez-Orfciz, and inquired as to his citizenship.

Ortiz

produced et alien registration receipt card which, upon
axasain&tion e both Burrow and Whit© found to be altered.
Ortiz was then placed undor arrest.

He was put in Jacobs'

car and given Miranda warnings in Spanish by Jacobs.
H© was ashed if he. wanted to obtain any personal
belongings.

He stated that h© did, and indicated that he lived

in the sssm apartment building from which the Agents had just
emerged with Rico.
Agent® White and Burrow then worst with Ortiz.
Unexpectedly* h® lad them to th® same apartment that was
occupied by Rico and respondent.

Ortiz opened the door with ©

key, and as the three men entered, respondent came out of ©
back room, into th© living roc®.
Ortis in tc his

room

to

collect

While Agant Whit© accompanied
his clothing, Agent Burrow

spoke with respondent in th® living room.
He explained to- respondent in Spanish that Ortis was
under arrest and was being permitted to collect his clothing.

Th&n Agent Burrow, thinking that if Ortiz* card was altered,
there was a possibility that respondent's card, too, was
altered.

And recalling that his earlier inspection of

respondent's card had been in the dimly life living room, asked
to sec- respondent's registration card, alien registration
receipt card again.
Respondent gave hi® the card, and Burrow examined it

second tic-:®*

She card w.® nhmn to Agent white# and both

agents inspected it under a flashlight.
Q

Now# incidentally# Mr. Reynolds# I think you

have already answered this# but I just want to be sure.

The

agent could compel him to exhibit the card?
MR, REYNOLDS:

No# Your Honor. The agent could not

compel him to exhibit the card.
0

Could not*

MR. REYNOLDS:

The agent could appropriately ask for

the card# and in this case he produced the card. But the agent
had no authority to compel him to produce it.

Q

And he might refuse to exhibit it?

MR. REYNOLDSs
C

H© might,

Nothing would follow fro® that?

MR. REYNOLDS:

Well# not directly? no, Your Honor.

Nothing could follow and in these circumstances nothing would'
follow.
Q

1 suppose the agent could draw some inferences

that might b@ to the disadvantage of fch© subject?
MR. REYNOLDS: That# I suppose# could well be# Your
Honor# and might warrant some further investigation on the
part of the agents as to this subject; but in terms of what
•they could do at that time# they had no authority to do
anything more.
Ci

Tbay didn't have authority to arrest him?

11
MR. JffiYNOliDSs
authority to arrest him.
Q

No, Your Honor, th©y did not. have
Now ~-

But they arrested the other-man who didn’t have

a card?
MR* REYNOLDS; Well, Your Honor, the agent’s authority
fc© arrest, under the statute, arises — an Immigration agent.8 &
authority — arises whore h© has reason to believe that the
agent is in the country unlawfully, and that the agent might
try to escape or flee*
Q

The alien*

MR* REYNOLDS;

I’m sorry? the alien.

Excuse as©,

Your Honor.
Q

Then why did they?

MR* REYNOLDSs

Your Honor, in these circumstances,

we submit cmt there was, if — w© are now positing that the
card had not been produced.

There was not reason to believe,

in these circumstances, that respondent was in the country
unlawfully•

Nor was there any reason to believe that he

would try to escape.
Q

Then there's a question on that point*

this sian —* whatever his name is

ihcifc.

If he said that he didn't know

The man had come in and said, "I’ve got Ortis; I just

arrested Ortis, and. I’m going to take him away.- Now let me

12
see your card.®
Don’t you think that that man assumed that he had the
power to arrest him?

Or that h© was under a duty to show it?

MR. REYNOLDSi

Your Honor# as to what the respondent

felt, the record is silent on that.

I don’t think it. is

unreasonable to assume# as you suggest# that he might have
thought that.

But our position is that that is not the test

in terms of whether you need to give Miranda warnings, which,
I believe, is the question you're directing your remarks to.
Q

Well# Mr. Reynolds, hut. dees this all add to

what the government is taking the position that he is not in
custody?
MR. REYNOLDS %

Yes, Your Honor# I believe that that

is right.
Q

And if fee was not in custody# that’s the end of

this case under that theory?
Q

At least it —

MR. REYNOLDSi Well# that — yes# Your Honor?
Q

The circumstances fall short of when Miranda

warning® would be required? that's your position?
MR. REYNOLDS? That’s our position# Your Honor.
0

And it really doesz * t make any difference whether

fcfca docwant is a public record or protected by the Fifth
Amendment or anything else.

MR. REYNOLDSs Well# I believe that if the document is

13
a public record, it cloaca**: stake any difference whether Miranda
warnings — whether the situation was custody or not custody,
Your Honor,
Q

The point is that you can’t ranks them turn it

over.
MR. REYNOLDS: Well, because —
Q

Because the point wouldn’t be whether the

document is protected, but whether he's bean coerced to turn
it over»
And Miranda would b® a — you're forcing him to -I mean if the situation — let me —
MR, REYNOLDS: Well, Your Honor, if it's a public
record, then you are not — if it's © required record, even
if, in th® circumstances hero, you w©r© to say that there was
custody and you therefore ware forcing him to turn it over,
you would not be forcing him to incriminate himself under the

I don't think he needs to answer the

second question.
Q

well, I know, but if he answers it, Miranda

would exclude it.

Do you think that situation is different if you say»
"Do you have a card?"

"Yes."

"Show it to me» pleas©»"

and

he pulls it out of hi® pocket and shows it to you?
MR. REYNOLDS* Wall» I think that is ‘a different
situation than if h@ does show the card, and the card iir a
document which is a required record, such as a driver's

license or —*
Q

Not if he doesn't have to turn it over? and _■

you said he is under no compulsion to turn it over.
Q

You have to turn over to a police officer your

driver's license, don't you?
MR. REYNOLDS*

Wall, Your Honor» I don't think that

it — I think it turns on the state statute as to whether or
not you have to show him, on his request, that you have to
turn over this — your driver's license.

Q

Under the motor vehicle laws;.

MR, REYNOLD!s
Q

But: I think in most. State statutes .

But you eny it is not a crime to refuse to

display your alien card?
MR. REYNOLDS: That's correct, Your Honor.

Q

And there's no compulsion in the law for you

to answer a request to display your card?

MR. REYNOLDSi That's right.
Q

And if you —

Well, isn't this alien in the same position that

I am, if m Immigration Officer comes to me end says, "Let me

sm your alien card," and I simply say, *1 have no alien card,
I'm not an alien, and if I did have on® I wouldn't show it
to you.”

E® doesn't know that the man is an alien by looking

at him, doe® he?
MR. REYNOLDSs Well, no, sir, h® would not know if —*
Q

So, a request for m alien card is not something

which officers throw around carelessly, I would assume.
MR. REYNOLDS;

No.

But our point —» the proposition

of Mr. Justice Whit© is that th® man is in a custodial
■situation, as I understand it.

Because w® are not talking ~ if we have a required

D© you ask the qv@st.ion?
Q

Mr. Reynolds, X tell you what's confused me.

Your position today, 1 think may be inconsistent with that
statement in your brief — I'm reading from page 6 of your
brief:

"It is, rather, a public document, like a driver's

licens® or a selective service card, which must be maintained
by the individual” •*- you said that? but the rest — "and
produced upon request by appropriate governmental agents under
the 'required records' doctrine."
Q

That's the watershed right there.

Q

Well, yon haven't said anything inconsistent,

with that today, that I've heard — maybe X haven't been
listening,,
Q

Maybe I haven't heard, it right.

MR. REYNOLDS:
Q

But —_

ttmt it be produced upon request, or not?

1?
MR. RiYMGLDSs

it may be requested legitimately under

the law, lawfully, by the lawful authorities.

But it — th©r®

is nothing in the law which requires that he produce it at the
time of -that request.
Q

Well, in this case —

MR. REYNOLDS: But Shapiro, Your Honor, I believe,
suggested that if you have a record which is required to be
kept, and it is © required record, that then if an officer
asks for fch© record that the law will assum® that it should h©
produced, under the required record» doctrine.
Q
then

Then you say yes# if it is a public record,

h© must produce it?

Yes.

Q

MR. REYNOLDSs

Yes, Your Honor.

Q

Mr. Reynolds —

Q

So there is an obligation in the law for him

to produco it?
MR. REYNOLDS*
that reepeot, yes.

To tli® — yea, Your Honor. Well, in

1 assumed you were asking whether there

was an obligation under statute to produce it.

But our

position is that if it’s a required record# and it is asked,
then there is an obligation to produce it without the protection ©f the Fifth amendment.
Q
position,

all right.

Now I think 1 understand, in your

Q

Eight.

ME. REYNOLDSt Correct.
Q

— or# in ©ay event, he was not in custody

within the req-air®K©nt of Miranda, and or. that ground Miranda
was inadequate?
MR. REYNOLDS: That is our position.
Q

Mr. Reynolds ~~

MR. REYNOLDS £
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

— my problem is that assuming that you didn't

have any Miranda problems, you go and ask the man, "Are you
an alien or not", solely because of the statute which gives
the agent the right over aliens? right?
MR» REYNOLDS:
Q

That’s right.

If you assume that, does it automatically

follow that the same alien and the same officer is in tills
identical position of no Miranda ruling when the purpose is to
find evidence to convict him of a crime?

Again I com® back to

the difference between deporation and criminal conviction,
MR. REYNOLDSs

Your Honor, I believe that the answer

to that is that when you are talking in. the Miranda area you
are talking of custody.
0

I think that in this respect —

Well, isn't an alien always in the custody of

an Immigration Officer?
MR. REYNOLDSt

Not in the Miranda sons©. Your Honor

19

Q

But can fo© stop him any tiara end ask him imy~

thing he wants f© ask him, mirier any circumstances?
MR. REYNOLDS:

He may stop him, X believe, at any

time and interrogat© him as to whether he is lawfully in the
United states.
Q

Right„

Q

That8® close to custody.

I®. REYNOLDSs Well, Your Honor, I don't believe that.
Miranda defines custody as meaning focus.

X think that what

Miranda said quit© explicitly in that focus in the Escobedo
sens®, under the Sixth Amendment question, that focus means

custody, but that custody does not me&si focus..
Now, our position is that in the first instance, when

h© first was in th© room and asked the initial time, that was
not a custodial situation.
nothing at the a®cone!

And we submit that there is

on the second occasion, if you look

at th© surrounding circumstances of tli® second request, that

would have changed whet wss a clearly non-custodial situation
into a custodial situation.
Now, it may be that there was heightened suspicion

on the part of th© agent, not probable cause but —
0

Was th.© alien free to go?

MR» REYNOLDS* ^ha alien was ~~ well, he war,
Q

Well, he was horn©, wasn*t he?

MR. REYNOLDSs

Ha was in the home. The agent went —

20

n

But he was free to leave horns?

MR. REYNOLDSi
Q

Wall —

People sometimes do»

HR. REYNOLDSs

Yea, Your Honor.

X would have to

submit that he would h&\m been — wall, he was not deprived
fresa freedom of action in aay significant way, which X believe
is the Mirando test.

The agents, after they *w@re given th®

card, went into the kitchen and left the respondent alone in
the living room, while they examined the card.

So I think in

that respect ■—
Q

He could have taken th© chance; is that what

you5 r© saying?
MR. REYNOLDSs

Well, X*« not — I’m not saying that

what I as© saying ie that I believe that if you have a noncustodial situation in th© first instance, that what the agent

wm doing, m~m though there was heightened suspicion in th®
second instance, was still making th© routine request — X
©©an routine interrogation as to whether this alien was lawfully
in th® country.

It was no leas routine because he might have been a
little ©or© suspicious that he had a forged card, he was still
trying to determine whether this alien was lawfully in the
country.

And in our view there is —
Q

p*hitentiary?

He, himself, was not deported, but in the

21
MR* REFOLDS: That; is — that is -the result, the
©ad result. Your Honor*

Q

I think that's right, but —

That's just the point,

what Ie® worrying about

is why it wasn't sufficient to deport him.

That's what I'm

trying to get.

why do you have to put the man in jail before

you d®posrt him?

You're going to deport him when he gets out,

aren't you?
mk.

ehymqlds$

Well, Your Honor, that's a determina**

felon X was not privy to, and —
•

Q

/

Wouldn't you assume so?

-SR* REYNOLDS s

— I'm not — but 1 think that when

you are trying to determine whether there was custody in the
ijiz&ntfis. situation, that is not determined by what subsequently
the decision might b@ as to whether you deport this alien or
you prosecuta him criminally.
Q

X suppose if the man is asked’for his card,

asked to exhibit it, whether ha's heme or on the street, he
might mush rather prefer to do that than being directed to
report to the Immigration Office on the following day at 10
^'clock in the morning, at greater inconvenience to himself;
is that not a reasonable assumption?
MR. REYNOLDSs Well, I think that is a reasonable
assumption, Your Honor.
Q

I agree with that.

&nd h© did not --if he refused to exhibit the

card., would that be the sort of remedy that the Immigration

22
Officer would pursue?

is that on© of the alternatives?

ME. REYNOLDSs
is a possibility.

Well, Your Honor, I think that that

Whether or not. that would be —- the request

for him to report would have to await further investigation,
to determine if there

Q

Is it not a fairly common thing for the holders

of these cards to be requested, by writing or ©thsrwis®, to
report to the Immigration Office, without knowing, at the time,
what they're reporting for?
I thought that was a matter of common knowledge.
MR. REYNOLDS? Well, X think that that dose — that is
a practice.
I would like to say just a word about the public *—

th© required record doctrina.
Our view is that this is a public record, and it is

a record that is required by law to be kept in the possession
of feiie alien for very legitimate regulatory purposes.

And

in that sens® it ie, in 'the most traditional sense, within
th© required records doctrine,

MR. REYNOLDSs
I believe.

I believe that Shapiro was a subpoena*

It just popped

the moment.

I*» not — I don't remember for

I believe it was a subpoena, in connection with

a request for sales records of a wholesaler.
Th© element in Shapiro that is not pressent here is
that Shapiro was addrassad fco what ar© essentially private
records, and h«re we have what are, in th© most tradition®!

24

sen:»a# public records.

And fer that reason, the additional

factor that was yur;g©ct^d i.n

and appeared again in

and GxgW;©.. fchfri is that the record b© of th© kind
etsta&erily "kept, is om that, in our view, has no relevance
here-

That that. -«*
Q

Well, would you say that if in this case the

officer said, "Would you please shew im your alien card?®
and ho said, ':,S$c, 1 will not do so"? and you say, "Well, you ire
obligated under th© law to keep th® card and produce it upon
request.®

K© says, "Sorry, 1 won’t do it®, and then he is

searched end th© card seised.

Is that th© kind of a require**

imnt to produce that you’re talking about?
MR. REYNOLDS* Well, that of course raises Fourth
Amendment questions.

I think that the Davis case would indidate

that that iu essentially th© type of requirement that w©*re
talking ©bout.

Whether or not they could have at that point

searched him, or whether there would have been legal process
required? but that is a type of requirement*

Davis indicates

that in thes© circumstances where you’re dealing with a public
record, the police officer may well, on Fourth Amendment
grounds, be able to go a little further than h® would normally
h® able to go, in terms of obtaining the document.
But x think that is essentially•what we do — what we
&r® talking about.

REYNOLDS%

Well, Your aossrf that*.

what war, troubling the Court of Appeals,

1

think# is

Th® required records

doctrine tineas on the recordkeeping requirement» possession of
a cord; and if that card# under the statute, that possessionkeeping requirement is one that is not aimed at a highly
©electivo group inherently suspect of criminal activity, which
we maintain is ths case her®.

Here you deal with all aliens *

Then fch© fact that, in this particular instance# we
are dealing with a forged card is not — is not — enough to
take this particular case out of the required records doctrina*
You have to look ©t the scheme, the statutory scheme, and
see where the statutory scheme is directed at criminal
activity alone,

I believe that was the thrust of the plurality

opinion in California v. Byqra, last term.

And X 'think that

it's the scheme itself that's important, and if# in this
particular instance, the respondent is maintaining that he
alone, because h® ected in an unlawful manner, would have to
incriminate himself by producing it, that does not take the
document out of the required records, requiring it,
Q

Suppose that it's "required" — to put "required"

in quotation marks — the only thing that required him fc©
produce it was his own desire to pass it off as a valid
document? is that not so?
H© was trying to pass it off as a valid document.

MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.

Mr. Cleary.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. CLEARY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CLEARYz

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas© the

Courts
la response to on© of the questions earlier put
concerning the requirement, I would like to point out to the
Court, in 8 United States Code, Section 1357, subparagraph (a),
subparagraph Cl), it deals with ths right of an Immigration
Officer to interrogate any person, any alien or any person
believed to b© an alien, concerning his citizenship,

There

is not the rajst stop to it that because there's another statute
requiring this individual to carry his alien registration
receipt card, that he must then produce the card.

There are

two separate statutory sections.
One of the problems confronting the defendant in this
case, which of course he felt, was not needed to be raised, is
possibly th© discriminatory inherent defect within this
statute? which means to say that anyone could be -inquired or
interrogated in this fashion.

28
In this caea the defendant contends that the
interrogation conducted £a this eass, under these circumstances,
calls for th© application of the Fifth Amendment.
W© would even contend that it's even stronger than
Miranda, because of the circumstances involving th® nature of
tli© interrogation.
Q

Now, you mention in the introduction of evidence

about the interrogo©*© subsequent criminal trial.
MR. CLEARYs

Yes, Your Honor.
9

Q
client her©?

What was th© evidence introduced against your
Just th© falso card, wasn*t it?

MR. CLEARY:
was his false card.
X4m not sure.

Government*& Exhibit 1 for identification
X think they used a social security card?

They also introduced a statement of Mrs. Diana

Vargas-Garoia concerning her statement requesting another
card because she lost the card? and of course w© have asserted
that this is patent hearsay and a violation of his confronta­
tion, to introduce this statement of another person.

Those

two items were, in essence, the basis of his conviction.

Q

Of hi§f- conviction.

But what evidence,

specifically, was introduced that was secured in violation,
under your submission of the Miranda rule?
MR. CLEARYs

Several.

First, the actual knowledge-

able possession, and that was manifested by "Show xrt© proof of
your citizenship" or,; upon the s@co.nd interrogation, "Produce

29
your card*85

It was no longer —* proof we a the term asked the

first time; the second time* “Produc® your card".

So, by

producing a card, he would then portray a verbal act that fee
had knowledgeable possession of that card.

On© of fch® ©laments

in the offense is knowledgeable possession.
Two, fefe© card itself,

and the result, fch© actual

production of fch® card, turning over fch© card, which was
introduced in evidence against him.
Those w©r© the items that incriminated him.

In other

words, fch<sr© was a combination of both a physical and a verbal
act.

There was ©Is© a statement of this man, that h® was,

and acknowledged the card? and th®ra was one

confession I was

able t© knock out on the grounds of the Valenti or McKabbMallory rule, and fch© District Court did grant that, but fchssy
1st in another one, an earlier statement to the authorities.
At this time, with l®av® of Court, I would like to
ask permission to b@ able to cite two additional authorities
concerning my cas<a„
The first; on© deals with the Court of Military

Appeals, and that is 13- S. vs. Howling — N-o-w-l-i-n-g —
9 United States Court "of Military Appeals 1)0, 1958? and the
other cas'3 I would like to', cite, and that is on fch® issues 1

.and 2 dealing with the Fifth Amendment and the production of
fch® card, on itera 4(c), requirement of defense counsel to b®
allowed to interview witnesses before they're deported, a©

— wall# it's not in the Fed 2d Reports as yeti U. S« vs.
Mendea Rodrigues# 9th Circuit No. 71# 1238# dated 13 July 1971»
Q

What was your first citation in the u. S. Court

of Military Appeals?
MR. CLEARY*
Q

S. „vb. fowling.

Yes# but I mean what's th© volume and page?

MR. CLEARY?

9 U.S.C.M.A. 100»

That case dealt with

— almost head-on with this type of situation that we have
here, in th© sense that —.in accord with the lower court and
certainly not binding on this Court.

It was where an Air Fore®

policeman thought that an airman did not have a proper pass#
a required document possibly by the military service.

He went

up and# thinking that h© might possibly not have an appropriate
pass# said “Produce your pass.8*
The man produced a pass# and the court hold that this
was in violation of Article 31 of the Uniform

Cod® of Military
/

Justice# which is the precursor to th© Miranda position on th©
warning that must be given servicemen.
Q

Are the decisions of that court re viewable

anywhere?
MR. CLEARY:

That's a question that 1 wouldn’t be

able to really respond to# Your Honor.
The question of the interrogation in this case.
has to take & look at th© total circumstances.

This was a

On©

31

ksmk force arrest group of the Immigration and Naturalisation
SorvicQ.

This is a sweep typs of procedure whereby they

apprehend certain aliens.

Xfc was brought out in the transcript

'that they knew of people that they had planned to apprehend»
They apprehended them and then extended t© them the courtesy
of securing their own clothes»
In this case there was an entry - -made into the
apartment the first time.

That time the authority of the

officers was present and it was demanded of the defendant, to
say, "Produce proof of your citizenship,*

He complied,

A

certain production was mad© at that time*
Thereafter they left.

When they left, they arrested

another one on the street, another alien, as they determined,
because this man now had a forged card? the other had not.
With this knowledge, the agent most candidly stated
for the record that KI now5 thought that the other man, when he
entered the apartment, had a forged card•"

He had that

knowledge.
He then, going back into the apartment, entered the
apartment again for the alleged purpose of securing clothes
of their prisoner? but it*s our contention, of course, as
stated in the .brief, that this went beyond the legitimate
ambit of fche.tr entry into the apartment, and then interrogated
tills defendant with the express design of producing that which
would incriminate him.

32
The Court c-f Appeals felt that this was the equivalent
of making a man produce the very evidence of his guilt# which
in fact it was, as clearly demonstrated in this case»
These are the circumstances that would trigger# if
at all, the application of the Fifth Amendment privilege.
It is our contention that the required records
doctrine, as really initiated end formulated in Shapiro, deals;
with a quite different situation.
business records.

In that case there was

In this case w© have a personal card

halonging to the individual.
The Shapiro case was further refined in the language
of Justice Harlan, in Marche-ttl, and h® sets out certain
requirements.

The third on® is the key requirement, and that

is the requirement dealing with the Albertson rule, and that
ia to say, when it focuses in on certain suspect class.

Our

contention is it's not 'even a class, it*s an individual, on®
defendant.

And when that class can be penalised, and here©

the penalty is most obvious.
i

In Miranda, the man only gave a statement of
complicity — excuse tme that was Escobedo.

In Miranda, h©

did give evidence of his guilt, or at least statement® leading
to evidence.'
In this casci it was the whole act was the admission
of guilt.
Isn’t there some relationship in the intensity that

33
would require? for the Anfcarplay of the Fifth Amendment,
©specially when herds' the status of the agents is greatly
enhanced?
For example, if .they were suspecting him of some
ordinary criminal offense, they could not so interrogate him.
With this case, they c&n ask as to citizenship? they can ask
anyone.

And isn*t there possibly a danger when you have a man

who is from a foreign land, does not speak our language, would
not. necessarily be enlightened ©s to our laws or as to his right
to resist, if at all?
Q

Is there anything in the record that shows what

he was arrested for?

Was he arrested for illegal entry, or

arrested for having a forged card?
MR. CLEARYi

Your Honor, you’re touching upon a

matter that was just briefly hit upon in the record, and since
^I served as defense counsel at trial, X have don© my utmost
to secure a deportation order for the defendant, and in the
nature of plea bargaining had spoke with the judge, with of
course the presence of the 0.

s.

Attorney, and almost literally

begged for a misdemeanor violation under 0 U.S.C. 1325.
The Immigration was adamant, their general contention
was h® had fooled an IKS agent on the first time, by the first
go-g.roand, and hence they would enforce what I felt were
Draconian penalties.
Q

The position —

Well, my point is, when he was arrested —

34
MR. CLEARYs

He was arrasfcad for & forged card.

However,
Q

Doss that appear ia the record?

MR. CLEARY &

Yes, it appears in the characterisation

of Judge Lynch, where Judge Lynch said, "At the tiros you
arrested him, you did have him for the forged card, which is
a violation of Title 18."
And their contention was, the Immigration contention
was, "Well, wo had him for that, but really w® don't have to
do anything with him under Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure, because we have him administratively? and
we don't need to bring him before a magistrate.®

And Judge

Lynch discounted that, ©lid said, "No, when you have him for a
federal crime, you roust comply with Rule 5 and bring him before
a magistrate.®
He was not. brought before a magistrate, but was held
a month until counsel was appointed.

And on© of th© arguments
/

we have laid before ia the trial court, in the Court of

1

Appeals, and again before this Court, is th® delay in th©
appointment of counsel.
Th© nature of the interrogation here was unique, it
wa® in th© man's horn®.

The status of the investigators had

been clearly demonstrated by counsel for the — th© Solicitor
General has indicated that they stated their purpose why they
ware ia there.

They readily had apprehended two of his room-

35

mates, and had demonstrated fclieir power

to seise and appre­

hend persons»
The critical point that w© try to raise is that —
trying to understand what the Fifth Amendment was trying to
do, and that is the disparity»

Hex® we have light years of

difference between an alien from a different country ©n foreign
soil, unfamiliar with the laws, unfamiliar with the language,
dealing with a federal investigator, experienced, bi-lingual,
knowledgeable, on his own home ground. There was no place
that was safe from this Immigration examination or questioning.
And somewhere along the line the Fifth Amendment
protects this type of conduct.
We contend that the circumstances here or© for more
coercive, are far more detrimental than those existing in
Miranda.

If anything we would try to draw upon the analogy

in Orosco vs. Texas, to indicate that the Fifth Amendment should
be applied, not in terms of a geographical setting but in tarns
of the rights or privacy of 'the individual.

Isn’t there some .

son© or right of the individual to b© protected, and that
right to be protected against self-incrimination should not
depend upon whether he's in the jallhouse or in his own flat.
But a fortiori that being in his own flat he was entitled to
some deference by the Immigration agents»

Q

Mr. Cleary, do you carry the right of privacy

so far as to say that it’s unconstitutional to require aliens

36

to carry an alien card?
MR. CLEARY $
Q

Ho, air.

In fact# -~

What’s the purpose of the card# then# if no one

can look at it?
MR. CLEARY*

Th® purpose of the card# Your Honor# is

that it is a form of. identification in several respects.

It

can
Q

Just for his benefit?

MR. CLEARY:
mutual benefit:

I would have to ©ay that it's for a

that of the government and that of the

individual.
For example# if the man was an alien and asked to
produce some evidence# bm could only ©how maybe a passport or
a birth certificate# that is not legitimate authority that
h@*s her© in the United States lawfully.

So, hence# he would

have to maybe check with the INS or something like that.

Th®

card would give him that advantage.
The benefit of the government# of course# is tc
regulate the aliens # which was the very basis of th© Act when
it was passed# I believe# in 1941,
Q

is that the primary purpose?

ME. CLEARY:

Primary purpose is to merely identify

and provida & means of authority.

Th© contention of th©

defendant would be that Congress hasn't spoken on this Act#
and the question is# -the card is there.

Congress fait it was

37

appropriate- for theta to produce the card, and I think it should
have mad® legislation to that affect.

There is no such

legislation.
In fast, in the same way that if the man could have
produced other evidence# I'm sure that would have been equally
satisfactory? but that this is © convenient form t© show a
person's legitimate status.
I think the point made by Justice Douglas# and that
considered by the defendant# touches t^pon the matter that when
the inquiry went in the second time it wasn't dealing with the
legitimate alien registration receipt card# it was dealing
with © piece of — for lack of a better term — contraband or
evidence that would be able to prove guilt.
And at that time this defendant was required to
produce that evidence# and it was no longer using# which we
went along with and w© didn't argue with the Court of Appeals#
nor do wo assert in this Court# that the government cannot
make general interrogation, SuljLlvgrojgg...The United States*■
to attack# the right to make neutral inquiries# I think it's
totally permissible» and I think that's fully within and
consistent with the Fifth Amendment.
But to focus in on this type of defendant# I think
it transcends that and the government should not ba able to
u..a a bootstrap statutory right to mate interrogations to
justify this type of seiaare.

the additional arguments in support of our position.

agent walking vtp, thinking that the man has a forged card?
and then asking him to produce it under fch© semblance of his
authority, I ©till feel would violate the Fifth Amendment.

is greatly aggravated by the fact that it took place within
the man's own apartment.
Q

the most fiercest and enthusiastic enforcers of the law, so
it depends upon —
Q

Your testimony on that ie not relevant, Mr,

MR. CLEARY;
Q

Yes, sir.

What about.this gentleman in the Immigration

Office routinely exhibiting his cardi do you think that’s a
violation of the Fifth Amendment?
MR. CLEARY:

i

Your Honor, I would have to eay yes,

in tii© absence of a statute that requires compulsory produc­
tion.

X think the answer lies her® very simply, if the agents

thought that they had probable causa that he had a bad card,
they could have seised him, having probable cause for a valid
arrest, and then taken the card from him, and then they would
have had hi®.
On the other grounds, even in the office, I feel
that, absent a .statute or absent some regulatory scheme to
require production, that the Fifth Amendment would protect him
from this situation.

pointed out, as a matter of convenience he- sight wish to show

Q

Weil, if he had n good forgery, wouldn’t he b©

willing to show it to them?
It depend© on how good the forgery is.
MR. CLEARYs Well, that’s something w® don’t know.
But that in some circumstances, if it was a voluntary situation ?
if it was one where a man could bo shown that he had, so to
speak, knowingly and understandingly tried to perpetrate some
fcyps of fraud on the government agent, then I think we might
run into

problem of a waiver of the Fifth Amendment.
Ho such evidence is present in this record.

All we

have is the demand of the agent, and a demand for the oard.
Q

Well, what’s the purpose of the card?

MR. CLEARY % Tim purpose of the card is to identify

there will be no Fifth Amendment claim, and I believe

X think it was
Q

Are you saying that Shapiro should foe overruled?

MR. CLEARY:

Ho, air.

1 am just saying that, there

was a concurring or dissenting ©pinion in Shapiro, where the
judge said that this case now applies to business records.
However, it can be pushed to its extremes.

It. has been our

experience that given these typ© of opportunities on
statutes, it can fo© pushed t© its limits.
And what I am saying in this case, it's been pushed
to the limits, because it's far beyond the business records
designed to fo© secured in Shapiro.
Q

Well, I thought, Mr. Cleary, you wire taking

the position, anyway, are you not, that because it was forged
it cannot fall within the required records doctrine?
MR. CLEARY$

Well, X would take — yes, definitely.

And in fact I think X made the statement earlier that this is
not the regular inquiry for a card,that we're not dealing with
a contraband item in that -Q

It wasn't a public record because it wasn’t the

44
kind of a card that the law requires him to keep»
MR. CLEARY %
Q

It wasn't — that6» right.

Because the law doesn't require him to keep

forged cards.
MR. CLEARY %

That's right.

Again the logical extreme.
If I could comment briefly on the contentions w®
mad© concerning an equally important point, but a jurisdictional
point, touched upon by Justice Stewart? and that is the
application of 18 U.S.C. 154S to an ©lien registration receipt
card.
The card here served as some type ©£ entry document,
but the document is © re-entry document.

On the card there

is a back portion where aliens leaving the country can re­
enter with the alien registration receipt card.

The

contention made her© is that the statute does not cover this
particular card.

;

The first on® is that entry is distinguishable from
re-entry.

And of course we cite the precedent of this Court,

in the Lau Gw Bev/ case, as interpreted by the McFarland
Second Circuit ©pinion.
The second point that

vm

make is the regulatory

characterization of the card by the Immigration authorities.
There is a. two-categorisation s
©vidsnc© of registration.

registration cards and

This card is secured within thirty

45
days after entry into the United States»

Wot at entry.

That is our contention that the ambit and scope of
3.546 was directed at those who would put ft$rth soma type of
legal documentation to indicat© lawful status in the United
States.

That is to say, false birth certificates or other

items, to give them the aura of legitimacy within th® United
States.

That this was not th© intent of Congress.
Further# it can fc@ easily reviewed by taking a look

at th© regulatory scheme.

Justice Marshall touched upon it

earlier. And that is that there is a scheme of removal of
those unlawfully in the United States# who misconstrue the#
so to speak, poem on the Statute of Liberty# who look for a
batter land as, in this case# this defendant.
And that is first as a voluntary return? no
deportation necasaary.

A person can be returned with

government funds or without government funds to Mexico.
Two, deportation.
Three, th© unlawful entry under 8 U.S.C. 1325#
first offense, 1500# six months% second offense, two years#
$1,000*
Next step, moving on# 1326# th® person who has been
deported unlawfully returns, two years, $2,000.
Then moving on to the more serious on®, 1546# then
we. have the five years? and than 1306(d)# and that is th© on©
who counterfeits the ©lien registration receipt card.

46

The further point, is that within the statutes we
have a patent, inconsistency, and that is, that in the second
paragraph of 1546 there is set forth a statute to deal with
the counterfeiting of documents required for entry.
In 1306 of Title 8, in subparagraph (d), there is
also a like provision dealing with counterfeiting, but this
time specifically dealing with alien registration receipt
cards.

True, this counterfeiting provision does not meet our

situation, where v?e have only possession.

But it is submitted

toy the defendant that if a specific statute deals with alien
registration receipt card® as other than documents required
for entry, in that both of these statutes were enacted as part
of the s&ffia package legislation, the Immigration Nationality
Act; therefor©, giving effect to both statutory sections, there
is an inconsistency.
Applying the principle of leniency, I think the only
answer is that this type of violation
way in most ordinary cases,

and it'© treated that

aggravated cases — is no more

than a misdemeanor under 8 U.S.C. 1325.
The other arguments contended by the respondent in
this case dealt with the search, and that was the aggravating
factor upon the entry into the premises, under Eats vs. The
United States, the Fourth Amendment protects persons not
placo©? and that her© there can be no showing that the
defendant consented to this type of interrogation, even though

the agents might have the right to conduct that interrogation
on the street or at their office.
home* there is no showing of that.

Their going into his own
They gained access by the

us© cf these other prisoners to secure clothing, that did not
give him, the agent, the right to conduct this type of
criminal inquiry.
The hearsay rule was the statement of Miss Diana
Vargas.

W© do not take, so to speak, opposition to the

public records excaption, which the Solicitor General would
contend.
We contend that if it’s statements, like a selective
service file or other public documents, made by the public
official, they can come in as a traditional exception to the
hearsay rule.
However, what w© do take exception with is when there
is a statement of a witness which is made and then becomes a
part of the file, and than the file is introduced, not so much
the whole file but that statement is introduced, and there is
no showing of unavailability of the witness, we contend that
that denies the right of confrontation.
Further, the question of defense counsel*

I was

appointed in this case, X think approximately four days after
the two witnesses, the last of the two witnesses had been
deported back to Mexico, beyond the reach of any type of
subpoena*

In my motion to dismiss the indictment, X alleged

48
this prejudicial delay, because here counsel was unable to
effectively prepare his case by interrogating two key
witnesses who would have very definite information as to the
circumstances surrounding their consent to the IKS agent, to
enter the apartment.
The government cites u. _S. vs. Perlman in their
Reply Brief — which I received only Tuesday — hut in reading
that case, on© can see that it's totally distinguishable.
Because counsel in that case was appointed, or at least
entered hi® appsaranc© in August, and the man wasn't deported
until the following January.
In this case, my appointment followed th© deportation.
Too, in th© Perlman case there was no showing that th®
prosecution was aware of the transportation.

Her© the

prosecutor was present in court when th© court ordered the
man remanded to the IKS for deportation.
So I say that in this case it was prejudicial and
was hot speculative, because it deals with on® of the essential
