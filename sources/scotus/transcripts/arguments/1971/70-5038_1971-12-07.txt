§L
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERr

We will hear arguments

nesst in Ho. 5038, Adams against Illinois.
Mr. Genaon.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD M. GENSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GEMSOMs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleaca the

Court s
The grant of certiorari in the instant case is
limited to the single question of whether Coleman vs. Alabama
is retroactive and applicable to the instant case where,
prior to trial, the defendant objected to the failure- to
provide counsel at a preliminary hearing.
It is our position that the State does not have
standing or right to argue reliance on non-retroactivity in a
case where the error was pointed out to the State by the
defendant prior to the trial of the cause, and the State ignored
the plea, proceeding to trial.
The case of Linklefcter vs. Walker established the
criteria for determining whether a rule should be or should
not be retroactive.

The reasons and the criteria were the

purposes to be served by the new rule, the reliance on the
old rule, and the effect of the new rule, the retroactive
application of the new rule on the administration of justice.
The purpose of the rule in Coleman, as I see it, is

4
tc enhance fell® integrity of the fact-finding process, and

doing

this by providing a lawyer at the preliminary hearing which, in
Illinois, is a very critical stag© of the .proceeding and a very
vital stage of the proceeding in the prosecution of a defendant,
The value of counsel at a preliminary hearing in
Illinois is immeasurable*

The attorney, as pointed out in

Coleman, can use the impeachment tool later at trial.

He can

fashion his tool, and this would be something that would be
impossible to do without an attorney at the preliminary hearing.
&s Justice Schaefer pointed out, in his dissent in
Bonner, —- Bonner is one of the eases in Illinois that
•

"

•

.

;

established the preliminary hearing not to be equivocal stages.
In that case, where there was no counsel, the witness testified
against the defendant in response to leading questions by t^-a
prosecutor in the court,

He was not advised he might call

witnesses in his own behalf; ha did not testify.

He was hot

advised that witnesses could b© excluded or kept separate
during examination.
He was not advised that the preliminary hearing in
Illinois can be used to perpetuate testimony, which is
specific in the statute.
2 differ with the respondent's analogy of Stovall vs.
Deane and Coleman, as I can contemplate a fair lineup without
an attorney present.

But hov might a preliminary hearing b©

fair without an attorney?

This is an adversary proceeding.

In this particular case* in the instant cace, not
one question was agakad by the defendant, not one witness was
called by the defendant.

The insufficiencies, or whatever

insufficiencies that there might have been in the case for the
State,- would have been ~~ were corrected by leading questions
by the State's attorney.

And 2 would submit that, unlike

Stovall, where you can have a fair lineup without an attorney
present, it is not possible to have a fair preliminary hearing
or preliminary hearing which performs the function of a
preliminary hearing in Illinois, without an attorney.
Q

Well, let me test that for a moment.

Suppose

the acts were witnessed by a great many people, and at the
preliminary hearing they bring in two witnesses that are said
to be typical of nine others.

Except for discovery purposes,

what would be done at the preliminary hearing?
MR. GENSONs

Mr, Chief Justice, at the preliminary
i

hearing, those two witnesses would be cross-examined, their
storias would be used to — would be tasted, there would be
impeachment, perhaps, laid for further us© at trial.

At the

preliminary —
Q

Mo, that's discovery now? I said other than that.

MR. GEM30Ms

Mo, for purposes — excuse me, Mr.

Chief Justice, for purposes of —
Q

But you are using it to prepare for trial, you

are using it for discovery.

s
MR. GENSOHi

Well, you are using it also, if it

pla as© the Court, for impeachment.

Because those* statements

are used in fashioning an impeachment tool to be used later
on*
Q

Well, that's still discovery, isn't it?

Preparing

for ferial*
MR. GBKSONs

Wall- Colsaanin its determination of

tli® values of preliminary hearing differs between the fashioning
of impeachment tools through the use of prior — through the
us© of the prior statements at trial, «and discoveries.
Q

Was the Illinois statute —» l*ia not familiar

with, it in detail, or its history — was that shaped as a.
discovery tool?
MR. GS53SOKs The Illinois statute relative to prelim­
inary hearing?

No.

The Illinois statute relative to preliminary hearing
deals specifically with the holding of the preliminary hearing
and the findings of probable cause.

There is nothing in the

statute in Illinois which — that deals with preliminary
hearing, which relates to the use of preliminary hearing for
purposes of either discovery of impeachment.
Q

May the prosecutor, under Illinois statutes,

bypass the preliminary hearing by getting an indictment or
'issuing an Information, if you us© that process?
%

MR, GEHS0H.S

It's an indictment procedure in Illinois,

?
Mr. Chief Justice* but at that time *—* they no longer can -•»
but at that time, at the frtem of the preliminary hearing in
Adams, the prosecutor would have had the option of going
directly to the grand jury.

Under the recant Constitution

which came into affect July 1st, 1971, if an arrest is made and
no indictment is pending, the prosecutor no longer has that
option in Illinois.
Q

He must go to preliminary hearing?

MR. GENSON:

He must go to preliminary hearing

before he can go to indictment.
Q .

If he gets an indictment before he arrests —

MR. GEMSQNs

If he has an indictment before he

arrests, he can bypass the preliminary hearing? but I would
just like to point out that the vast majority of the arrests
‘c

in cases

contemplate or resolve from arrests at. or around the

time the offense is allegedly committed, and indictments are
never — are very rarely sought.

Only in the exceptional cases

do you have an indictment prior to arrest in Illinois.
Q

You are speaking of cases where an arrest is

made right on the scene —
MR. GENSON:
or two later.

Or an arrest is made sometimes a month

It’s an extremely rare situation.

Only in,

perhaps, certain financial crimes, or other crimes of that
type in Illinois, have we seen indictments obtained before the
arrest, sir.

3
In Illinois also, with reference to discovery, the
witnesses can be

the lawyer can get discovery from those

witnesses at the preliminary hearing.
How, under the rules as they were fashioned in
Illinois at that time, the only items that the attorneys were
entitled to were the witnesses ~~ the statements of the
defendant and a list of witnesses.

At the time of the trial

and after testimony, then the statements of the various
witnesses were aval lab 3.©.
Now, if these witnesses testified at trial, of course,
again, in addition to having those statements available for
impeachment or possible impeachment later on, these statements
would also be available for purposes of discovery? and these
would be statements under the discovery rule at that time, which
would not he available at the time of trial.
Under the new rules, these statements are available
at the time or after the bringing of the indictment.

But even

then •*— but even than — under the new rules, the indictments
in Illinois generally don't come until three or four months
after the arrest.
The attorney in Illinois, in addition to the
processes of getting discovery and providing impeachment tools,
can expose weaknesses in the case which might eliminate an
indictment,

And this is very relevant, certainly, under the

new rules in Illinois, because it is ray contention that the

9
Illinois rules provide that ones there has been a finding of
no probable cause f that the only way that this can be brought
again before the court system is for new evidence to be found
and it's brought again before the preliminary hearing judge,
The value of an attorney in Illinois goes to other
aspects of it.

The groat majority of the cases brought in

Illinois are disposed of in prelirainary hearing.- to a reduction
of charges through an acceptance of a plea to a lesser charge,
through an acceptance of a plea on an Information, which is
filed right in the preliminary hearing courtroom*

And, there­

fore, I don't think the respondent can contest the fast that
the vast majority of eases, of eases in the State of Illinois,
that are brought as felony complaints are disposed of at the
preliminary hearing level.
And this is another value, at least in the State of
Illinois, for the retroactive, or th® application certainly of
Coleman, and the retroactive application in this case? because
a lawyer's presence at that preliminary hearing becomes
immeasurable at that time*
>

Q

At that hearing, at that preliminary hearing,

can the sentencing process take place, too, in Illinois?
HR, GEHSON:
Q

The procedure generally —-

On just the plea?

MR. GENSONs

The plea is not — the preliminary

hearing is brought by a felony complaint. The plea is not

entered at that time»

After the preliminary hearing, the

procedure usually follows that the prosecution» in the event of
a weakness9 perhaps„ in their case» or because of whatever
reason they feel is important» would reduce that charge to a
misdemeanor»
The municipal court judge at that time has juris­
diction to receive a plea as to the misdemeanor equivalent, or
the misdemeanor-included offense at that time.

They also have

in Illinois an Information process» wherein, just subsequent
to the preliminary hearing the judge than — or between
conferences — there is a conference that takas place between
the judge, the State’s attorney and. the defense attorneyf
pursuant to a specific Supreme court rule.

And an Information

is filed pursuant to a waiver of indictment, and plea
negotiation takes place.
The pleas usually received at that preliminary
hearing are generally quite a bit less» in the event that
you do partake in those discussions» than those that might be
taken after indictment.
Now, the other — another advantage of an attorney
at the preliminary hearing in Illinois is regarding psychiatric
examination» notwithstanding the fact that there has been no
case cited, and Mr. — and the respondents make the point that
there is no authority tor psychiatric examination in the
State of Illinois

12
Notwithstanding that, there is a municipal court
psychiatric clinic.

And what this means is that a great number

of cases are referred, when there is evidence of some, sort of
psychiatric disorder, to that psychiatric clinic at the
preliminary hearing level.
Now, the value of art attorney in asking for that
again becomes immeasurable, because certainly, if Your Honor
please, th© psychiatric examination takes place one, maybe a
week or two weeks after the alleged commission —

Q

Is the preliminary hearing, throughout th® State,

held in the municipal court?
MR. GENSON%

The preliminary hearing in Cook County

is held in municipal court.
Q

And the psychiatric service you mentioned is

available only in Cook County?

MR. GENSONt As far as I can determine, there is only
this specific psychiatric service available in Cook County.
Q

So as a value, it's a value only in Cook County?

MR. GEM-SON;

In Cook County, yes, sir, Your Honor?

but the fact of the matter is a good many, or I would imagine
a good majority, the vast majority of the preliminary hearings
held in the State of Illinois are held in Cook County.
therefore

1

And

think it*s important to point out to Your Honor

that the psychiatric examination might at this time be held
one week, one week or two weeks, perhaps, after the alleged

commission of the offensas , a lot more value than having an®
ordered subsequent to indictment, which might be four or five
months later»
Another added addition that a. lawyer can perform at a
preliminary hearing —
Q

Well, you're arguing Cook County law to us now?

MR. GENSOH;

I'm arguing regarding that part of it,

regarding the psychiatric examination in Cook County law.

But

there is nothing, Mr. Justice Biackmun, which prevents an
attorney from requesting a psychiatric examination at the
preliminary hearing level under Illinois law.
I am merely saying that the facilities are available
in Cook County, a specific facility designed almost entirely
for this purpose.
Q

Well, we had a case up here a little while ago

from Belleville, down in Saint Clair County.

What would happen

if he wanted a psychiatric examination?
MR» GERSOS? t

He would have to make a request of th©

preliminary hearing judge, and the preliminary, hearing judge
would either not — he would either order it or not order it.
But there's no authority in Illinois allowing or not allowing
him•to order it•

And 2 think the value of a psychiatric examination
is certainly immeasurable when on© considers the fact that
indictments generally follow th® crime by about three or four

months.

X know the prosecution ofton, in its indictment in

„

defenses where insanity is raised would raise the fact that
the • elimination wasn't gotten until substantially after the
offense.
Additionally —
Q

Incidentally,, what you're telling us about

preliminary hearing practices, are these preliminary hearings
before or after the constitutional rules?
MR. GEKSONs The preliminary hearing practices that
I speak to are before.

But after the same rules apply, with,

the additional factor that under new Illinois

under Illinois

law subsequent to the Constitution, the preliminary hearing
is required, as the Constitution reads, unless the person has
been arrested, unless the person is arrested after the
indictment.
Q

Neither the practice nor function has changed

with the new constitutional amendments?
MR. GENSON: The only function is that it has eliminated
whatever direct indictments — with reference fee cases,
specifically murder cases, and certain narcotic offenses,
direct indictments were generally the only way it was proceeded.
They would arrest them, hold the preliminary hearing, the State
would continue the preliminary hearing for a month or whatever,
and during that time they would proceed to indictment.
Again, in my experience again there is no law, and I

14
practice ail through the State, in moat other counties , most
of the other counties forewent or did not practice the direct
indictment procedure.

Almost all the counties, even before,

practiced a system wherein preliminary hearings were gained
before indictments,
The other —
Q

Do you have Informations in your State?

MR, GENSOMs
Q

Yes.

Do you proceed to criminal trial on Informations

in your State at all?
MR. GENSONs

Or is everything by indictment?
It can be proceeded if there io waiver.

Generally, it's very rare that you see an Information unless
it specifically waives; and it’s generally only waived in cases
of pleas of guilty.
The Information proceeding in the last three or four
years is practiced extensively at this preliminary hearing
level, because of a constitutional emendmant passed about
three years ago.

While prior to that constitutional amendment,

the municipal court judge did not have the power to take a
plea on a felony, even by Information,

Since that new, the

new amendment, they’ve been allowed to do this, and therefore
they have been proceeding on this Information at the preliminary
hearing level in great amounts» since — well, in the last two
ox’ three years.

Q

And that's by waiver of the defendant?

15
MR» GENSONs
Q

Yes»

He has a State constitutional right to be

indicted —

MR» GENSONt
Q

Yes, air.

— for a felony, does, he not?

MR, GENSONs

Yes.

The only additional factor that 'I'd like to point
out is that even under the new Constitution the grand jury
can bo eliminated by simple vote of the legislature.

And

this again, assuming that this might be done, would certainly
put greater value on the preliminary hearing if this could bs
done, or were done.
Another function, a very important function of the
lawyer or the attorney in Illinois at a preliminary hearing,
is regarding the motion to suppress.

The motion to suppress!

at the preliminary hearing in Illinois is binding and appealable.
Now, at the time the respondent filed their brief in
the instant cause, legislation was passed by th© State to by­
pass this, and to allow the State to proceed to Indictment
even though the motion to suppress had been sustained by the
preliminary hearing judge.
Since then, that law has been declared unconstitutional,
and th© state of the law in Illinois at this time and at the
time of the instant cause, the Adams case, is that the
preliminary hearing in court makes the final determination on

IS
motions to suppress„

The preliminary hearing# end this is a

binding and appealable oder# and if not appealed by the State#
the State can go no further relative to that evidence.
Q

Why — in Gilbert we said counsel at a lineup?

those decisions , except Stovall# were not —
MR. GENSON%
Q

Yes# sir.

Why — and those two could turn on harmless

error» in the case of preliminary hearings..

How do you

distinguish — why should this be retroactive# when the
requirement of counsel at lineup was determined not to he?
MR, GENSONs
there is a difference.

Because, Mr. Justice# X feel that
In determining retroactivity, the only

test isn’t whether there was counsel or wasn’t? there are
three tests.
But going back to the first test# the purpose of the
rule# it would seem that an attorney at a preliminary hearing
will invariably help the defendant in Illinois.

It is not

invariably in a lineup# as 0. s, vs. Wade# that it would not
help.
Q

Yes# and we did say in Coleman# even if he

doesn't have on© at a lineup# if it is established that the
absence of counsel is harmless error# then the absence of
counsel at a preliminary hearing is different?
MR. GENSON% The point I am trying to make# Mr.
Justice# is that a lineup can be held

a lineup can b© fair

17
without an attorney present.

It is possible.

'A preliminary

hearing, sir, it is say contention, cannot be fair.
Q

X know, but when we said that it might be

harmless error, isn’t it implicit in that that a preliminary
hearing also could be fair, even though there was no counsel
present?
MR. GENSQNs The logic — the logic ~
Q

X mean, on your approach, wouldn't there be any
>

room for harmless error?
MR. GEHSON :
Q

In — in —

In your approach.

MR. GENSGKs

In my approach, if Your Honor please, the

logic of Brennan —» the logic, Mr. Justice Brennan, in Coleman
would not allow for a harmless error remand; no, sir.

And under

my contention, I would think there should be a —
Q

Yes, well, to that extent, wouldn't we have to

.modify or overrule what we said about harmless error in
. v
*
Coleman?

?
*

MR. GENSONs

I think — 1 think that, on®, it is

not necessary to conclude ..because there was a harmless error
remand. that the case should not be retroactive.

I think the
$

determination of whether or not a case should be retroactive
revolves and relies on all three criteria.
Q

Wall, that may — but isn't it rather

;
incon­

sistent to say that it may fee harmless error even in situations
f

i

.18
respectively where €oilman is applied?

And to say that

Coleman, per se, has to foe retroactive?
MR. GENSONs

I'm not saying — wall, no, I cion;t

think so.
Q

Yon don't think so,

Q

Mr. Season, while wo have you interrupted, was

the Illinois court unanimous in its decision here?
MR, GEHSONs

The Illinois court, where there was no

dissent.
Q

All right.

MR. GEN SON s

I do point out, though, that idler© had

been --- there had been ono dissent in the initial finding, the
finding of the People vs. Bonnerg that was by Justice Schaefer*
Q

But he went along in this case, I take it, or

did hs not dissent?
MR. GEKSQNjt
no dissent.

He didn't write a dissent.

There was

It's not — they don't record, as I understand it,

the findings in Illinois if the judge doesn't write a dissent.
The second consideration, in Linkletter, is reliance
of the law enforcement authorities on the old rule.

It is our

position that the State does not have standing to argue
reliance in non-retroactivity and apply it to a ease where that
error was pointed out to them at trial.
It is further our consideration that we are dealing
with different types of lav? enforcement authority.

If by law

19

enforcement authorities we mean the police officers and police
investigative tec!
there.

les, certainly there was no reliance

And I think there’s a far greater argument for

retroactivity, where police investigative techniques, as opposed
court procedures, are involved.
Now, I’d like to point out there thd.ro is a. differ'V

entitatlon in Stovall, because in Stovall we were dealing with
various investigative techniques; that it was our view, at
least, maybe that the police were depending on it at the time
of the Wad® decision.
In this particular case this doesn’t reflect that?
it reflects only the effect on the courts, and I think that's
properly dealt with, the last point, the administration of
justice.
Lastly, relative to the reliance point, I'd like to
point out that the Coleman opinion, as pointed out' by many of
the opinion» in the decision, was certainly foreshadowed by the
decision© that preceded it, and perhaps not relied on by some
of the State Courts? it should have been.

Because of the

different opinions by the Court relative to the right of
counsel»
The third criteria that I'd like to point out, that
Llnkletter points out, is the effect of the new rule, and the
retroactivity of the new rule 021 the administration of justice.
The effect of this case, we feel, is negligible, because we are

20
asking that rule to foe applied and limited to only those cases
where it is raised at trial.
That is, if a man has counsel at trial, and if the
>

counsel does not raise or make issue of the fact that he did
not have an attorney at the preliminary hearing, we are asking
that the Court — that the Court deems this to foe waived, and
not apply retroactively as to those cases.

Where it has been

raised, as it has been raised in this case, we would ask that
it be applied retroactively.
I think the effect on the administration of justice
as to that type of application certainly would be negligible.
Thank you.
MS. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? Thank you, Mr. Genson.
Mr. Gildea,
ORAL ARGUMENT OP E. JAMES GILDEA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TEE RESPONDENT
MR. GILDEA?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Lest X forget to mention this, X would like to, first,
deviat® from my prepared text and in connection with the
questions concerning the Bonner case, and Justice Schaefer's
dissent, 1 would urge Your Honors to consider the fact -that
Justice Schaefer's dissent in that case did not address itself
to the constitutional question.

It addressed itself to a

matter of statutory interpretation as construed by the majority

21
of the Court? statutory interpretation under the Illinois law.
We had a statute that provided that counsel was to
be. appointed at the preliminary hearing if a defendant was
indigent.
We had another statute saying that at the point of
arraignment no plea was to be taken without appointment of
counsel.
The Bonner case construed the two statutes to be
in parj

materia, and held

that the two provisions required

only that counsel be appointed prior to any plea of wherever
interposed.» and Justice Schaefer took umbrage with that, and
took exception, and it was his opinion that the Illinois statute
provided otherwise.
However? ho did not dissent on the basis of any
constitutional question.

As to the factual background of those cases , Your
Honor, this case charged the defendant with the sal© of narcotics,
and it was a, what wa call a controlled sale, in that an
!

informant was used in connection with two police officers.
The defendant was arrested immediately after the
alleged incident? and he appeared in court the following day.
The case was then held on call for one day and continued
variously.
Subsequently there was a preliminary hearing, and
we concede that counsel was not appointed by the judge at the

22
preliminary hearing.

Thera was testimony adducnd at that

point from one witness, on® of the officers, and upon the;
testimony of that officer the judge found probable .cause and
held the defendant to answer to the grand jury; a'&fl indictment
was returned, and it was not until the day that the case was
set for trial that counsel for the defendant filed his
motion in connection with a claim for having his constitutional
rights violated by failure to appoint counsel at th©
preliminary hearing.
In that connection, the motion that was filed was a
motion to quash th® indictment? it wasn’t a motion asking for a
preliminary hearing, and the defendant did not, in his motion,
allege that he was in fact indigent and therefore required the
appointment of counsel.

And, furthermore, the defendant did

not allege that he suffered any prejudice during the course of
that preliminary hearing.
Mow, addressing myself to the principal issues here.
Sine© Linkletter vs. Walker, on down through the resent cases
that the Court pronounced, last year — X*m speaking in tarns of
Williams and Hill and Elkanich — the Court has applied a threefold test in determining whether or not a new constitutional
doctrine should be hsld retroactive.
In that connection, th® Court has stated that in
deciding that issue the Court will look, first of all, to th®
purpose of th© new constitutional doctrine? secondly, to prior

S3
reliance on previous standards? and, thirdly, to the effect
on the administration of justice.
Addressing myself, first of all, to the purpose of the
constitutional doctrine, as pronounced in Coleman vg,
the court stated that the purpose was to secure for a deror-deafc
advantages preparatory to trial, and in that connection the
court mentioned six possible advantages.
Tha Court said that the presence of counsel at a
preliminary hearing might be effective in preventing a possible
bind-over to the grand jury by making effective arguments and
cross-examination and what-not.
Secondly, he could perhaps secure a lower bail or
bail initially, and he would have scene bearing, or would have
some influence on that determination.
Thirdly, by cross-examination he could perhaps create
material for impeachment at trial.

He could discover the

— scats of the State's evidence that would b® used at trial.
He could perpetuate favorable testimony for a later date, and
then he could secure an early psychiatric examination.
How, with connection to the purpose aspect oar the
purpose criterion, the Court said that where the major purpose
of a new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of
the trial that substantially impairs tha truth-finding process
so as to create serious doubt as to the reliability of a
guilty verdict in prior cases, this Court will hold the

24
doctrina retroactive.

In that connection we submit that the purposes
espoused in Coleman for the appointment of counsel at a
preliminary hearing do not go to that degree.

We do not

believe that the functions to be served by counsel at a pre­
liminary hearing have any substantial affect on the truthfinding process at a subsequent trial.
And we do so for the following — we make that
assumption for the following reasons?

Addressing ourselves

point by point to the contended effects to be served by the
presence of counsel at a preliminary hearing, we have, first,
the prospect that the presence of counsel could prevent a
bind-over'to the grand jury by cross-examination and by

!
argument,
And

he "“could secure, perhaps,

a lower bail.

Bearing in mind that the function of a preliminary
hearing is only to establish probable cause, we submit that
those two considerations would have no bearing on the
subsequent trial, and would have nothing, no impact on th#
truth-finding process at a trial% in fact, would be mooted by
a subsequent guilty verdict.
Since the standard proof at a trial is beyond a
reasonable doubt, and standard of proof at a preliminary
hearing is merely probable cause? we submit that, in effect, a
jury finding would overcome any impediment in these two aspects

25
that would be suffered by the defendant by failures to have tho
appointment of counsel.
As to the possibility of securing an early psychiatric
examination and perpetuating favorable testimony, we submit,
first of all, that these two considerations would occur very
rarely in the normal criminal process.
As to the perpetuation of favorable testimony, there
is also this consideration, and that is tillss

Whether or not

defense counsel would in fast want to do so, bearing in mind '
that by perpetuating favorable defense testimony he would have
to, in effect, declare his defense prior to trial.
Now, first of all, preliminary hearings generally
take place, and it is designed to take place, shortly after
arrest.

At that point the defense counsel has had little

opportunity to investigate into the allegations of the State's
case.
So, generally, he has insufficient knowledge to
frame a defense, bearing in mind that he would want to frame
his defense only after h©*s heard the State's case or has
ascertained the State's case, to determine whether or not he
in fact would want to declare and interpose a defense and bind
himself at a subsequent trial.

Q

Well, Mr. Gildsa, aren't you arguing the

Coleman case now?

That's behind us.

MR. GILDE&;

Yes, Your Honor, I am, but 1 am only

26
arguing it in the sens® that I am addressing myself to whether
or not the failure to have counsel at a preliminary hearing
will create any substantial impairment of the truth-finding
process at trial.
And that is why I address myself in that way? and
perhaps X do not understand the Court’s question.

Q

I thought the issue in this case was just

whether Coleman was to be retroactive.
MR. GILDEAz That is correct, Your Honor,
And in answering — in attempting to answer that
question, X proceed on the basis of whether or not the denial
of counsel at the preliminary hearing will have any substantial
effect and will resolve — substantial effect on the truth­
finding process at trial.

And addressing myself to the

functions of counsel, or the purposes -or the advantages to be
secured by counsel at a 'preliminary hearing, as ©spoused by the
Court in Coleman. addressing myself to those specific remarks,
X feel that in that connection, by not having counsel for that
purpose, the defendant would not suffer any substantial
impairment in the truth-finding functions at trial.
Q

Since you say that nothing can be accomplished,

why do lawyers, retained counsel, waste their time at
praliminary he arings?
MR. GILDEA:

Weil, it wasn’t ray intention to say that

nothing can bo accomplished, 1 simply say that —

Well, if you admit that something could fcs

MR. GILDEA j Well, something can be accompli shed ? but
semethin? could also have been accomplished in Miranda, some­
thing could also have been accomplished in Wad.® and Gilbert,

and -Q

Well, we’ve only got Coleman here,

MR. GILDSA:

That's correct.

But I —- in the

resolution of the ~~ whether or not this substantially affects
subsequent trial, the same thing could be said in Wade and
Stovall and Gilbert.

Something could be accomplished, but

does that mean, by mere virtue of the fast that something
could be accomplished by the presence of counsel —
Q

Well, wouldn't the presence of counsel increase

the truth-finding process?
MR. GILDERs

That would be, I think, at the. very

least, a gratuitous speculation.
Q

I don’t think that ~~

But I would say he could also, to the same degree,

MR. GXLDEAs

That's correct.

That's correct.

Isn't that helpful to the truth-finding process?

there alternatives?

Yes, it is helpful, but is that — are

Well, could ha, in Illinois?

MR. GILDEAi

He hars the right to interview witnesses,

he gets —* he has the right, under his pretrial notions»- to
a list of witnesses? he can ascertain the identities of the
witnesses, and he can talk to the. witnesses.
Q

Can he cross-examine them under oath?

MR. GJLDE&:

No, he can’t, Your Honor.

But that need not be critical.

However, he does have

access to their testimony at the preliminary hearing? he does
have access to their testimony before the grand jury.

And he

can frame questions during his cross-examination at trial in
reference to their testimony at these preliminary stages.
I say these, things because the Court has remarked/
in Stovall and I believe in Johnson vs. New Jersev, that the
question of — there's the question of probabilities.

And Mr.

Justice Marshall's remarks are well taken, but 1 would say
that, by the same degree, by the same token, that Griffin vs,
California (sic) could have an effect on the truth-finding
process.
In that connection I would say that Bloom vsIllinois
and Duncan vs. boijdgiana could also have an effect on the
truth-finding process at trial.

And I would also say that

Miranda and Gilbert and Wade could also have an affect on the
truth-finding process.

But could we say, simply by virtu® of

that fact, that it would have a substantial, effect so as to
require that in all cases the rule should be applied retro-

30
actively?
Judged by the standards that wars employed in Gilbert
and Wade and in Miranda # we submit that the defendant would
suffer no greater adversity by the absence of counsel at a
preliminary hearing than he would in most cases.
And, for that reason# that the rule? should no more
be applied retroactively here than it would in Gilbert# Wade#
and Miranda.
Q

Does Illinois concede the possibility# even if

we agreed with you.* that there should not be retroactivity# of
a due process exception as to cases preceding Coleman?
MR. GHjDEAj
Your Honor.

I accedo to ~~ X would agree with that#

As a matter of fact# in Bonner and in the Illinois

cases# the Court has held that where a defendant can show

Has that been / Illinois rule? before Coleman?
MR. GILD2A*
Q

I see,

MR. GILDEA:

And that's been from the time of Morris

Q

At least according to the opinion in this case.

MR, GIXhJE&s

Yes, Your Honor,

Was that based on the doe process clause of the

Fourteenth Amendment or just on Illinois law, or Illinois
constitutional or common law?

Q

But it was based on the Federal Constitution

and not just -MR, GILDEA:

Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

the Illinois law?

isK. 8I&DEAs That is correct. Your Honor,
1' might also say that the preliminary hearing in
Illinois is not particularly suited for the utilisation or
the gaining of the benefits that were intended under the
Coleman rule, because —- for example, that in the State of
Illinois there is no requirement that the preliminary hearing
foe attended by a court reporter, or that a transcript foe made
of the testimony.

The court is only required to hear go

much evidence, as will give rise to conclusion in his mind
that there is probable cause.
That is, that a crime was committed, and that this
particular defendant before the bench committed it.
The presumption is, therefore, that the judge could
hear just testimony from one witness and would not necessarily

32
have to hear defense testimony,
Furthermore,, the testimony at a preliminary hearing
may be based upon hearsay evidence only.

And generally the

rule ia, or the practice is the same as with grand jury matters?
and that is, that the State will only call one witness, generally
a police officer, and he will relate what facts ware revealed
by the process of his investigation.
So, in reality, there is not that great of an
opportunity to secure material for impeachment and to discover
that much about the State’s earns.
As to the second criterion used by the —* or used by
the Court in past practice, in determining whether or not a
c&3Q should be held retroactive, that being the question of

reliability, we submit that the State of Illinois did, in good
faith, rely upon prior standards.
The only cases that were before the court concerning
the question of appointment of counsel were, of course,
Powell vs. Alabama, which concerned itself with the affect of
assistance of counsel at trial, .and I don’t believe that that
bears on the Coleman question.
Other than that we had Hamilton^vg«. Jklabaraa and
Whita vs« Maryland.

HardItonjyg. ^ Mabiang. was a question

concerning the appointment of counsel at an arraignment.
How, in Illinois, counsel is required to be appointed
at arraignment.

And undor Hamilton, of course th® arraignment

33
there differed, we believe, drastically from the preliminary
hearing in Illinois in this respects

In Hamilton vs., Alabama,

of course, the defendant had to assert rights there, such as a
plea in abatement, a challenge to the composition of the grand
jury and the petit jury, I assume, too? or, by not doing no,
he would forever waive those rights.
Now, under Illinois law, as interpreted in People vs,
Bonner, there was;? no binding effect that a defendant could
suffer by not having or by not asserting any rights, or by
not objecting to any evidence at the preliminary hearing.
Indeed, if he testified, that testimony could not be used against
him during a subsequent proceeding? and he was not bound by
the failure to assert any defense.
And of course in Whlfee vs, Mary1and, there there was
a plea of guilty interposed by the defendant at the preliminary
hearing, which was used at his trial.

And that, ipso facto,

did bear upon the truthsfinding process at the trial, so that
it was considered by the trial court.
Now, Illinois has relied on this distinction, as
pointed out in the distinction of People vs, Bonner.

In that

connection I 'would call the Court’s attention to the fact that
we ware not alone in doing so.

There were some 33 other

jurisdictions that also ; ./pointed to that fact, in distinguishing
their preliminary hearings from those in White vs. Maryland and
as against the arraignment proceedings in Hamilton vs. Alabama.

34
And as to

amongst those 33 other jurisdictions,

all of the Federal Courts of Appeals, subsequent to .1963,
did 'themselves hold that where the preliminary hearing was not
such as to bind the defendant at trial, that the requirement
of counsel was not of constitutional dimension.
So we submit there was no clear foreshadowing of the
Coleman doctrine prior to the pronouncement of Coleman, that
i

the Illinois court® could be bound by,
As to the effect on the administration of justice,
the appellant assarts that, it is his contention that this
would not affect, a great number of cases in Illinois, because
of the fact — or a great number of casos anywhere, because
of the fact that it is hie contention that the failure to
interpose an objection on that basis must be considered a

waiver.
And w© believe that that is a misinterpretation of
the law, as stated by this Court in 0*Connor vs. Ohio, where
it said that a defendant could not be deemed to waive an
objection to a constitutional question that was subsequently
pronounced, because it could b© no more binding on him than
it could ba upon the Stata, who could not have anticipated
such a ruling.
So 1 do not believe that he is correct in his say as
to that point,
Q

I gather your Sonner rule, it doesn't matter

33
whether the objection is made, dose; it?
ME, GILDEAs
Q

Ho, Your Honor.

It does not matter*

Whether made or not, if that prejudice is shown,

he*© entitled to relief?
MR, GX1DE&; Where there has been an error — a question
of substantial magnitude, constitutional magnitude, then the
waiver doctrine does not preclude the defendant from making
that assertion that, for the first time, on appeal or in a
collateral proceeding.
As recently as 196S, some two-thirds of the States of
this Union did not provide for the appointment of counsel at a
preliminary hearing.

It was not until 1964 that the Federal

Courts adopted Section 3960 of Title 18, providing for the
appointment of counsel in Federal casos.

So that we submit that

there is a vast number of cases, prior to 1964 and 1965, that
would have to, perforce, be affected by any ruling by this
Court holding the requirement of counsel at preliminary
hearing retroactive,
Furthermore, since in Illinois, and 1 believe in many
other States, a transcript of the preliminary hearing is not
required, it becomes a very difficult question to determine
hew, if the case i® to to© remanded on the basis of Chapman vs,
California, for a determination of whether or net there is
harmless error, how could that be established where there was
no transcript of the preliminary hearing from which anybody can

decide what in fact happened at the preliminary hearing?'
Furthermore » what criteria would be used by the court
to decide whether or not the failure to cross-examine, failure
to object» would have any substantial effect, oh -the truth­
finding process of the trial?

Hew could that determination

fa© made?
We are dealing in a very nebulous area here.

The

problem of finding taint» there would be no standards, no
guidelines that the court could use.

And as to cases going

far back, I question whether or not it could even be
ascertained, at least from the State's point of view, whether
or not the petitioner did have the benefits of counsel or net.
Q

I gather that most of those municipal court

proceedings, no transcripts wore mades no record had been
taken?
MR. GXLDEAs
Q

That’s correct. Your Honor.

What about today?

MR. GXLDEAj

Correct.

Do you make records now?

Well, the rule — it's been changed

drastically, because of the recent opinions? and now they are
compelled to do so, for this very reason.
Also addressing myself to on© or two of the remarks
that were made by ray colleague in his presentation, I might
say that the failure to move to suppress any physical evidence
preparatory to trial does not preclude the defendant from
making such a motion at trial.

Thank Your Honors.
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER2 Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD M. GENSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR.. GENSONs

Just briefly speaking, may it please the

Court, the — Justice Schaefer, in his dissent in Bonner,
deal with constitutional issues.

did

And, as a matter of fact,

stated that if constitutional issues are to be considered —*
in the last two paragraphs of his opinion — the appropriate
constitutional reference, in my opinion, is Escobedo vs.
Illinois, in which it was held that a constitutional right of
counsel was abrogated when the suspect was denied an opportunity
to consult with his retained attorney.
Following that, he points out to

he points out

the different advantages a defendant would have were he to have
had an attorney at trial.

-So Justice Schaefer did, in his
>

concurring opinion — or in his dissenting opinion in Bonner,
did speak to the constitutional issue.
Further, I’d like to point-this outs

that relative

to the motion to dismiss the indictment that was filed, the
motion to dismiss indictment would, in Illinois, have had the
same effect m a motion to request a preliminary hearing.

The

indictment would have bean dismissed, the statute of limitations
wouldn’t have been posed? there would have been no difference.

Thirdly, I’d like to say fchiss

whether, in fact, a

harmless error could bo shown would depend on, t think, the
individual case, and therefore it would become relative whether
the case was a strong or a weak one.

In this cas© the testimony

revolves around the uncorroborated statement, or substantially
uncorroborated statement of an addict informer who allegedly
purchased narcotics ^during substantial periods of time;,

ifoth

the policeman were not present, and a lot of things could have.,
happened.
In Illinois, and on the basis of the different
appellate opinions, a sal® of narcotics to an addict informor
which is substantially uncorroborated would merit reversal.
The Court has, in cases dealing with the right to
counsel, that is in judicial proceedings, has held this to fee
retroactive in the past.

We're contending and asking in the

present case that this be dons hare too.
One more thing I'd like to point out.

The due

process exception in Bonner, alleged due processt there is
nothing in Bonner which specifically statas that a man has a
remedy if ha could show prejudice.

And I think on© of the

differences, and perhaps if this Court in their opinion would
point out the difference, on© of the differences between
Coleman and Johnson — or Stovall and Johnson and Coleman, is
that in Stovall we specifically state that there is a due
process stopgap, in the event — because it's not being held

retroactive
In Johnson, they specifAc&Ily say there’s a due
process stopgap relative to the issue of voluntariness.

The

Bonner case in Illinois dees not set out any test whatsoever
as to whether or not something should devolve or be a violation
of due process.
The only remark In either Bonner or Morris is that in
this case no prejudice was shown.

It does not state specifically

that if prejudice would b© shown, that there would bs any
opportunity for the defendant to raise this in any way.
So X think this is another important difference between Stovall,
between Johnson f and between Coleman, la that in Stovall and
Johnson there is an express exception, a due process exception?
there would be none under Illinois law specifically.
There As nothing An Illinois that leads to it.
The last point I would make is the analogy between —
or the analogies made between Bloom, Duncan, Griffin, relative
to the effect on the fact-finding process.
Coleman, just as — Coleman dealt with the Sixth
Amendment right to counsel, just as -Gideon dealt with the Sixth
Amendment right to counsel? Bloom and Duncan, in order to assume
a lack of fairness, would have had to assume that the judge that
heard the case was prejudiced.
Griffin, concluded that this was a Fifth Amendment
protection.

40
In this ease, Coleman is a Sixth Jta^ndmnt protection
and a Sixth Amendment protection at a judicial preceding? and
this is — and we foal that the exception is bread enough there
to the other cases»

The. differences are clear enough as to

warrant a claim of retroactivity»
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIHP JUSTICE BURGERs Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2i39 p«m.

the case was submitted.)
