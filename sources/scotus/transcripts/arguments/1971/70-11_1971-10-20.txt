MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Melancon, will you proceed ©s soon ,&$ your
friend is fully ready —~ yes# I guess h® is.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LLOYD C. MELANCON> ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MELANCON:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas© the

Court:
Th® matter comes before you today on a writ of
certiorari directed to the Fifth Circuit in connection with its
having reversed a summary judgment granted t© petitioner who
was fch@ defendant in the district court below.
fV

The summary judgment cam© about as a result of a
petition being filed by plaintiff wherein ha alleged himself
to hm a special service employee ©f an independent contractor,
Otis Engineering Company, doing work on, as he allaged, a
fixed and immobile drilling rig off the coast of Louisian©.
K© alleged in his complaint that the accident
occurred December th© 17th, 19§§, and the complaint in
connection with that alleged accident was filed with th© clerk
©a January the 4th, 1968»
In the complaint, the plaintiff sought relief in the
basic tort action alleging recovery under the Longshoreman
and Harbor Workers1 Compensation Act, th© Outer Continental

4
Shelf Lende Act, and otherwise»
Routine discovery transpired, and ultimately it was
conclusively shown that this was a fixed and immobile
structure, an artificial island, on which this alleged accident
was supposed fc© have occurred.

And as a result of that,

Petitioner filed its motion for summary judgment.
It was argued before the court, and the district
judge, in furtherance of th® recent opinion by this Court, in
Rodrigue, held as a matter of law that Chevron was entitled to
its judgment because th® application of the laws of Louisiana
to this tort action were that the plaintiff was compelled to
fil® his suit within © one-year period of time and, not having
done so, the matter had prescribed, or time-barred, — as in
the other States, we use th® term of prescription.
An appeal was sought by respondent fcp th® Fifth
Circuit, and the Fifth circuit, in deciding th© case, notwith­
standing th® very positive» position taken by this Court in
Rodrigue, that the admiralty and maritime law did not apply to
fixed and immobile structures.
Th© Fifth.-Circuit went on to follow its earlier
decision in th© gure Oil vs. Snipes case, and held that, yes,
Admiralty and maritime law did apply, and since it did apply,
then th® admiralty and ia&rifcim© doctrine of laches was applicable
and summarily reversed the district court,»
At least

s
Q

May I ask at that point, did you or did you not

argue laches in th® Fifth Circuit?
MR. MELANCON:

We did not, Your Honor.

The question

of laches was never presented to the district court.

The sole

question presented t© the district court below was the
application of the strict.

civil law doctrine of prescription;

that is, the application of the Louisiana law to the plaintiff's
alleged accident.
There was no —
Q

That was the two-year —

MR. KELANCON:
q

On®~y@ar, if it please the Court.

One-year restriction.

MR. MELANCONs

It was the same as the Longshoremen,

Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, which is on© year; the State
of Louisiana Compensation Act, regular State Act, is ona year.
And of course the historical tort limitation of Louisiana has
b©sn one year, going back to the Civil Code.
So that we don’t have .anything here that was new or
different.

All that Rodrigue said was that this Court was

satisfied that Congress, in having passed the Outer Continental
Shelf Lands Act, was paramountly interested in the minerals
themselves being closely connected fco the States, th® adjacent
States from which they were working; and this Court recognised
that Congress held th® admiralty and maritime law doctrine of
laches otherwise would not apply to fixed and artificial island

6
such as this.
Q

Wall, that means sine© it wasn’t an admiralty

action?
MR. MELANCON:

That’s right.

This is a pure action

brought by plaintiff where we have a diversity situation, where,
if th® accident happened ~~ for argument now? we contend of
course that this accident happened in the territorial waters
©£ Louisiana, which is an area under dispute at this present
time, where the court has appointed a Master to make recommenda­
tions with respect to that coastline of Louisiana.
But —-

Q

Well, is this © — is the district court’s

jurisdiction invoked as a — a whet

MR. MELANCONs
Q

a federal question?

Yes, Your Honor,.

It isn't a diversity case?

MR. MELANCON; Well, there is diversity between th.®
parties --

Q

There is, but it’s really a federal question

under th© —
MR. MELANCONs

Yes, because th®;y sued under th© Outer

Continental Shelf Lands Act.

Yes.

MR. MELANCON; That's right.

MR. MELANCON: And the Fifth Circuit want on, in its
decision in Bus on below, to take a distinction between sub™
stantive and procedural law.

And ©f course with the background

of fch® Fur© Oil vs. Snipes case, where, of course, it was a
very contrary holding to this Court’s holding in Rodrigue,
justified fch© ©xespfclon her© and you had s. real hiatus, s© to
speak, because here in a man we have a personal injury.
roan was not killed.

The

In Rodrigue, bora, the companion cases,

you had death cases.
Now, this Court says, in a death situation the laws
of Louisiana apply, therefore the survivors have one y@ar
within which fc© fil© their claim.
Look afc fch© situation you hava now if the Fifth
Circuit is to be maintained in its contrary opinion.

If a man

is injured offshore, and he lingers ®.or@ than 12 months, and
then subsequently dies without having filed a claim, or hia
survivor®, he is barred under Rodrigue.

Yet, in a personal»

injury action, if this Court maintain® fch© Fifth Circuit,
the individual who lives rosy fil© his lawsuit at any time in

8
th® distant future? ae long as he can show that there is
excusable aeglect on his part, and that the defendant was not
prejudiced by his delays,
It's a totally inconsistent position, Your Honor,
and th® bar in Louisiana, where the greater number of these
cases are pending and have been tried, have been looking to
this Court for sort® resolution of this problem that has arisen
in th® Outer Continental Shelf,
w® fell ought that that had been reached in Rodrigue,
where this Court specifically stated, under no unequivocal
terms; otherwise, it said, admiralty law does not apply.

The

laws of Louisiana ©hall apply, and those laws are as follows,
New, I might mention fco the Court in this connection
that sine© th© decision of Rodrigue and the Huson decision,
tdi® district court in Baton Rouge, which is also in the Eastern
District of Louisiana, in the Guillory cas®, wrote a vary
scholarly ©pinion, holding quite squarely on this question of
prescription, that the on© year applied because this is what
the Supra®.© Court said in Rodrigue.
and just last month, in fact within th© last three
weeks, another panel of the Fifth Circuit, headed by Justices
Tuttle, Wisdom and Ingram, in the Dickerson case, have,
specifically held, following this Court in Rodrigue, that th®
laws ©£ Louisiana shall apply to these accidents occurring on
such structures,

laid they not only went on to apply th® law,

9

but they held multiple phases of the Louisian law to apply,
such as the question of proximat© cause, the calculation of
damages, the application of contributory negligence.

All of

tlies© phases that feh© Fifth Circuit seamed fco be so concerned
©bout, as to having equality and uniformity of decision; yet,
her® is another panel of the Fifth Cix-cuifc saying specifically
Rodrigue is feh® law, we recognise it as the law.
And in connection — the question ©f prescription was
not raised therein, but the court did go on, Judge Tuttle went
©n

who is feh©

augur of fch© court in this opinion — to

observe that while he was not taking issue with the other panel,
which raised this fins distinction of substantive procedural
law, he recognised that this matter was up before the Supreme
Court on writ for ultimate decision.
Q

Thera seems to be some verbal controversy in

fell© briefs that you and your brother have filed, as to whether
or net this Louisiana period of solicitation is a period of
"peremption*5 or whether ife"s a '’prescriptive" right; is that —
Ml. MSLANCON;

K© would confess there, Your Honor,

that
Q

-- does that go to any of fch© basics ©f the

issue?
MR. ME LAN CON s

No, it does not.

Simply this:

In.

Louisiana, fchs tort erfcicl© of 2315 is the article under which
an offense can be assarted in court and recovery sought in a

10
tort action»
In 2315 the Legislature went on to state that where
a death occurs — and this is with respect to feh© survival of
heirs — that these survivors must, within on© year, bring
their action under 2315»
However» in & pur© personal-injury case» the Codss
article» Civil Cod® article of 3536 is applicable thereto?
and that is specifically on® year.
Now, what happened in the court below» that is in the
Court ©£ Appeals, the Fifth Circuit went ©n to take, as I said
before» a distinction between the substantive law ©f 2315»
which it said was absolutely permipfciv©» ©t cetera» with
respect to a death action, but then went on to say» well» now»
3536 is procedural and therefore, being procedural, w®6r© not
going to apply the admiralty and maritime law doctrine of
laches, which was of eours© inconsistent with what had
happened in Rodrigue.

•

• ’

How, going back to this question of the application
of laws:

Certainly under Erie vs. Tompkins, where we have a

forum applying the federal law, th® law outside of the United
States, assuming that —* outside of th© State ©£ Louisian® —
assuming this to be outside of Louisiana, it must of course
apply th© fedsral law, but the law of th© forum, with respect
to prescription, the procedural aspect would b© applied.

And

her® it is, there's no dispute that 3536 limits a personal-

11
iajury action to one year.

And that is precisely what w© have

here.
Now, there is nothing unique or new about the fact
that a tort action must be brought in one year in Louisiana.
This goes back for a hundred years t© the eld Code.
practicing in Louisiana is well aware of this„

Anyone

This is nothing

new or different ©r something brought along.
I mentioned before our State Compensation statute
specifically limits the right of recovery under compensation
to on® year.

The Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act# the

vary Act that the plaintiff has alleged in this lawsuit as
being applicable, which was denied but he still alleged it
being applicable# limits the right ©f recovery t© on© year.
So# therefore# I think that it is quit® obvious
and clear from th® record that plaintiff# having filed hi®
suit in excess of ©a© year from th© date that this occurred#
that h@ has lost his rights.

And these are rights# if he had

them# that he failed to assert.

And they &r© time-berred#

they’re prescribed# perempted, whatever other terminology w®
want to us© in connection with this.
Going back to th© Fifth Circuit's decision# we say
it’s wrong because it was unsoundly brought about.

Where it

held that the district court was an admiralty court; th®
district court was not an admiralty court..
was not applying admiralty and maritime law.

Th® district court

12
The court, the district court was applying the law
of Louisiana, as defined by this very Court in the Rodrigue
decision.
It was thoroughly recognized by Congress and this
vary Court that the adjacent States to these tidelands of the
coastal waters have a vital interest in th© men who work offshore, who they must of course take car® of in instances that
arise; and this was thoroughly recognised by Congress in all
of th© hearings that were held and the discussions of the
different Congressman that war® involved.
We than say that if that is true, little more can be
said, in this case, because ©v©rythiag has been said in
Rodrigue, which is applicable to our situation here.
Th® only basic distinction that you can find, if
that to© a distinction, is th© simple fact that in Rodrigue
there was death, and in Husgn it was a personal injury.
Otherwise the factual situation is identicals

th® fixed

structures and th® relationships of th© parties.
And because of that, unless th© Court has mom®
questions that they would ask of counsel, X would just like t©
keep a short time for rebuttal to answer my brother in this
instance,

But X think this is as clear as any case can fo©„

If Rodrigue is not th© law, then we'r® going to have to go
back all over this situation and find out what it is, because
ymrva got a lot of litigants, you've got a lot of lawyers in

13
Louisiana who don't know what th® lav; is.
Thank Your Honor,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

If you undertake to b©

But

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, GAINSBURGHs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Courts
I think the reason, or one ©f the reasons that my
friend was able to be so brief is that he has the prima' facie
case on his side* namely the .Rodrigue decision.

And I think

it would be less than realistic, as an advocate, if we did
not acknowledge that this is so,
Q

Well, in addition to Rodrigue, I suppose h© also

has the statutory language, doesn't ha?
MR. GAINSBURGH:
Q

He has the statutory language, —-

And that’s what puts the civil end criminal

this statute as declared to be the law of the United States.
MR. GAINSBURGHs This is explicit language, to be
sure, Your Honor,
Q

Judge Brown said don't 1st * e let literalisms

prevent ~ or promote unsound results,
MR. GAINSBURGHs

I think that there perhaps is more

14
than a little merit to Judge Brovm'a observation in this
particular case»
If, for instance, we subscribed to the statement in
Rodrigue

statements, I should say, as I read the decision ~~

that Congress was concerned with the welfare of the offshore oil
worker, th© amphibious oil worker who undoubtedly is subjected
to a rather hazardous environment, in which, albeit on a fixed,
platform called poetically an artificial island, he is
subjected to the vagaries of the sea, of wind, wave and weather?
t o a large extent th© equipment with which he works is affected
by all of these things.
In this particular instance it would be difficult,if
on® took & reasonable view of these circumstances, not to
conclude that the sea played a part in Mr. Huson's injury,
albeit it happened on an artificial island.
If, as the Court suggests in Rodri^iae, Congress was
concerned with the protection of 'these people who undoubtedly
need protection, it struck Judge Brown, apparently, as it
should be apparent, I would think, to anyone who compares fch©
two systems of the law, that under the maritime law — v?hich,
incidentally, for almost e decade prior to Rodrigue," in a number
of cases, several of which certiorari had been denied in —
men such as Mr. Huson were allowed to have the benefits of the
general maritime law when injured in this identical situation.
ted a brief comparison, I think, will do no violence

15
to the Court's schedule.

X would simply suggest that under

Louisiana law, for instance, if a man — and under 'the laws of
most States which have adopted the common law that., unfortun­
ately, in our civil jurisdiction in Louisiana ws have adopted

Assumption of risk is a complete bar to

Under the maritime law, such would not be the case.
Contributory negligence, a complete bar to recovery

under Louisiana law.

Anomalous as ifc may be, a civil law

Contributory negligence, not © complete bar under
maritime law.
Inflexible statutes of limitation, as Judge Brown
points outin this opinion, as opposed to the more equitable
and human© consideration of laches, the doctrina which Judge
Brown allowed Mr. Huson to avail himself of in this case.

This honorable Court declared in earner!c that it was

Q

Well, lt3s the atypical disc syndrome, isn't it?

MR. GM NS BURGH s

Right.

Now, this is the; view of the maritime lew, that a
person who can show these things and who has shown these things
is entitled to have his day in court, and to have the
defendant's legal liability tested for it.

But not under

Louisiana law.
Q

Well, this all suggests that Rodrigue should b©

considered
MR. GAINSBURGH:
Q

Yes, it does? literally.

— and do you also claim that Rodrigue is

inconsistent with the Lands Act?
MR. GAINSBURGH:

Your Honor, our position is that

th© Rodrigue decision places an interpretation on th® Lands
Act v?hich is inconsistent with the general admiralty and mari­
time jurisdiction ©£ this honorable Court,

tod an interpreta­

tion which is not necessary to bring about th® results that
Congress apparently intended.
W© feel, for instance, that the inferences drawn by
the Court in Rodrigue —
Q

Well, you would say though, I suppos® — what

18
you’re really saying is that the admiralty law — you should
really treat th® drilling platforms as vessels, and people
working on them as seamen, and which is

and at least have

the admiralty law available to them?
MR,, GAXNSBURGH;

Yes, Your Honor, but I would not —

1 would particularly seis® upon the opportunity to suggest that
it is not necessary to treat these high-seas structures as
vassals, in order —
Q

Oh, I understand that»

MR. GAXNSBURGHs

Th© general maritime law in th®

Yes?

MR, GAXNSBURGHs

— would serve, I respectfully

submit fcc this Court, would serve to achieve the end© that
Your Honors attributed to Congress in Rodrigue, namely, the
maximum protection of the offshore worker, much better —
Q

Well, what do you d© with th© language ~~ I know

this is a reargument of Rodrigue -MR. GAXNSBURGHi
Q
it?

It certainly is, sir,

— and you either win that or you lose, X take

IS
MR. GAINSBURGH:
Q

That is correct# sir.

And 8© what do you do?

So# accepting it on that

basis# what do you do with the language of the Act and the
legislative history of fch® Congress# which clearly says that
they didn't intend these accidents to be governed by maritime
law?
MR. GAINSBURGH:

I would respectfully suggest to Your

Honor again that the Congress said they did not intend to
treat them as vessels? and we submit, and have attempted to
support our submission in our brief, that it. is not necessary,
that the presences of & vessel is not indispensible to maritima
jurisdiction.
Q

X agree# X agree with you,.

MR. GAINSBURGH:

And therefore we believe that tills

situation is no different, if I may pose this hypothetical
propositions

if you had a national park totally within &

state# an area of exclusive federal jurisdiction# totally within
a State# through which ran a navigable stream, I think that you
could accommodate certainly th© contracts, the other business
activities that went on in the park and apply State law with

no problems.
But let's get something into the stream# let's get
something in the water# let's put something at sea.

And a

tort occurs there# which# traditionally, by locality# would b©
within th® jurisdiction of the admiralty.

20
It seems to me that it does no violence to Rodrigue„
it does no violence to the Lands Act, particularly, to apply
maritime tort principles to what we feel by their very nature
and service ©re maritime and admiralty premises,
And this is th© — really the brunt of our brief;
we realise it's a difficult burden to carry, if we hav© t© get
that far.

W© have urged to this Court, as v?@ did in th©

court below, -that even if Your Honors determine not to reexaminer the Rodrigue decision, that is it inequitable in this
situation, although th® record will not support overt reliance
on Snipes and Oursley and th® pre-Rodrigue decisions? but
it is manifestly unfair to apply this Rodrigue decision
retroactively in this particular case.
At the time this action was filed, the law under
which w® operated and had been operating for almost a decade
in th© Fifth Circuit was that laches applied, not prescription.
There was no compulsion of law, either statutory or case law.
It was all to th® contrary»
No compulsion —
Q

Except the statutory language.

MR. GAINSBURGH: Except the statutory language, which
th® Fifth Circuit had interpreted as intending to apply maritime
law to these platforms.
Of course, as Your Honor knows, th© Fifth Circuit,
in the Snipes case, interpreted the s©me statute which was

21
later interpreted by this honorable Court in Rodrigue. They
just cam® to different conclusions.
But the litigants in the Fifth Circuit, and 1 as sms
elsewhere, certainly would have a right or should have & right
to rely upon the pronouncements of that court, not ©nca but in
at least four different casas? three ©£ which, I think, were
denied, sir, by this honorable Court.
we feel that this is not the only matter of its
kind in the Fifth Circuit.
to some before coming hare.

My brother Mr. Melancon referred
X hav© ascertained that there are

actually three matters pending in the Fifth Circuit in which
the decision is being withheld, dealing solely with cases
fifed before Rodrigue, after the State prescription, dismissed
by tii® district court aftcsr Rodrigue was decided, and now on
appeal fe© the Fifth Circuit.
Perhaps there are others in the district court which
hav® not yet reached that level, but X am unable to canvass
without a great deal of research.

But those th.ro© d© exist, and

along with. Mr. Huson, these people will retroactively lose
their causes of action.

It may foe said by my brother that they

n©v©r had it in the beginning, so they can't lose what they

naver had.
But this is a r@troacti.ve application of a time
limitation, of which there ifas no fair warning or reason given,
in view of Snipes and oursley and the other cases that were

22

decided.
We feel fch&t the — in summary and in conclusion —
that the language, the literal verbiage of the Lands Act does
not compel this Court to hold 'that Congress intended to take
out of maritima jurisdiction what we contend was a part of the
general maritime law of the United States, tort occurring on
the high seas, 80-soma, 80, 90, 125 miles at sea, it seams to

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LLOYD C. MELANCON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OB’ THE RESPONDENT
MR. MELANCON:

Vary briefly, Your Honor,

Thar® is a serious issue, Mr. Justice Brenners, in
connection with the plaintiff’s accident and the delays that
are involved, that have not been presented, but simply to touch
on it vary briefly:
The record doe© establish mid show, in the Appendix,
that there is a serious dispute as to whether this man ever had
an accident on the date alleged, because his superior contends
that they were working in Longview, Texas, on this day, and he

23
knows of no accident happening»

That's in the record.

But —
Q

That doesn't help us when we get to deciding

the issue.
MR. MELANCON:

Mo, that's right.

That was just to

clarify that point that Mr. Justice Brennan raised.
But, secondly, if we are to have equality end
uniformity, as this Court recognised in Rodrigue, this is the
function of Congress.

Congress can pass the lews and make

these men seamen, if they wish? make submersible rigs vessels,
make fixed structures vessels, and otherwise, end clearly
define the prescriptive periods which, even under Huson, the
theory that was advanced by the Court of Appeals, you haw
no uniformity.
You have Mississippi, you have Texas, you have
Louisian®? each have differrent prescriptive periods.
Now, what do you apply?
So the function her® is fch© function of Congress.
1 do not believe, in fairness, that it is the function of this
Court, once it has fairly and clearly recognised Congress1
intent in Rodrigue, to now come and say?'

But wait, death

actions, yes? Rodrigiaa applies.

Personal injuries,

Barred.

no? that’s procedural, and therefore admiralty and maritime
law applies*
