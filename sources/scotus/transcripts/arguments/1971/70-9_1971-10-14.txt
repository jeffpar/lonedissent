MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in No. 9, Younger against Gilmore.
Mr. Nock, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE R. NOCK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. NOCK;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Five years ago last month the Director: of Corrections
of California adopted a new regulation
libraries.

regarding prison law

It was in response to a certain problem he faced.

*

In twelve of the institutions under his control,
there were few» if any law books at all.

In two of them, San

Quentin and Folsom, there had, over the years, accumulated a
rather ragged collection of lav; books, mostly case reports,
and mostly more than ten years old.

Of course, such obsolete

law books were worse than useless, they were potentially
dangerous, because they were misleading.
Nonetheless, despite the poor condition of these
law libraries, inmates at other institutions had the misimpression that they were first-class libraries, and were
deluging the Director with requests for transfers to San
Quentin and Folsom, in order to utilize the library facilities.
The new rules attempted to solve both problems by
standardizing the libraries at all fourteen institutions.

This

4
was to be done by providing a carefully selected list of what
were called basic codes and references, namely —
Q

All these events you're describing are since

this case arose?
MR* NOCK:

Well, the adoption of the regulation,

Your Honor, cams prior to the filing of this complaint.

The

regulation was adopted on September 19th, 1966, and the
complaint was filed in response to the adoption of the
regulation, on October 27th.
Q

Then I mis tinder stood you, Mr. Nock? I thought

you said within the last five months.
MR. NOCK:
certainly in error.
Q
it clear:

Oh,

Oh, I beg your pardon.

If I did, 1 was

Five years.
Well, whichever was the error, now I have

five years.
MR. NOCK:

Thank you, Your Honor.

This carefully selected list of law books contained
the various codes of the State of California defining penal
offenses, the State and Federal Constitutions, a law dictionary,
rules of this Court, the California Courts, the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Inadvertently omitted, and

regrettably so, were the rules for the Federal District Courts
in California.
And also in the list were The Standard Work on
California Criminal Procedure, Mr. Witkin’s work of that title,

5

and a subscription to the Weekly Lav; Digest, a California
publication that summarizes the most recent decisions of this
Court and the California Court, in all areas, including
criminal law.
The response was the filing of this complaint on
October 27th, 1966, by the plaintiffs, a group of inmates.
They challenged the constitutionality of the regulation,
because it provided, as a necessary part of the standardisation
plan, that lav; books, existing lav; books at the two institu­
tions, San Quentin and Folsom, would have to be removed.
Counsel was ultimately appointed, the very able
gentleman on my right; and thereafter, acting at all times
through counsel, the inmates filed an amended complaint
alleging nev; causes of action not related to the instant
appeal, and filing a motion for a three-judge court.
This motion was denied.

But plaintiffs were able

to persuade the single judge to certify the question, as a
propriety of the three-judge court, to the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit; and an interlocutory appeal on that
issue was taken.

The Court of Appeals held that it was a case

for a three-judge court, and reversed the order of the
District Court.
We disagreed, and filed a certiorari petition,
arguing as strongly as we could that it was not a three-judge
court case

6

Opposition was requested arid filed, but certiorari
was unanimously denied.
The case went back to the District Court, where a
three-judge court was convened.

The court met on August 6th,

1969, and requested that the parties isolate the issue suitable
for a three-judge court determination, and specified them
clearly, to aid the court as much as possible in reducing the
issue to those of law.
We complied bv filing lengthy stipulation, a settled
statement of issues, which listed five issues, the first two
of which we consider relevant to the instant appeal, and that
was the constitutionality under, first, the due process clause,
and,second, the equal protection clause of these regulations.
We stipulated suggested relief, which included,
should the court find the regulation unconstitutional, merely
a declaration of its unconstitutionality, and an injunction
against its enforcement.
Q

Mr. Nock, let me ask you one things

in

Regulation 330.041, "There shall be established iR each
institution a standard set of basic codes and references which
shall consist of and be limited to;"

naming 11.

in that list are the United States Reports.

Not included

Does that mean

that if, at my death, I were to bequeath a set of United
States Reports to the State of California for use in the San
Quentin prison that they would not be accepted?

7
MR. NOCK:

Under present regulations they would not

be accepted at San Quentin prison, Your Honor? they vzould be
accepted by the State Library of California to add to its
prisoner collection, which is circulated among the various
inmates, upon request, subject to the availability of the
requested item.
As the regulation shows, some of the State Library
collections are missing, but they do contain all the case
reports that any California prisoner could possibley desire.
Q

Well, what is the policy behind the regulation

which prohibits the existence of all or part of the U. S.
Reports, which, I suppose, are the final authority on
constitutional rights?
MR. NOCK:

Standardization, Your Honor, to give

inmates in all 14 institutions the same access to locally
placed law books.
If Your Honor were to bequeath 14 sets to the State
of California for use in its penal system, there would be no
problem in distributing these 14 sets to these various 14
institutions.
Q

Except that the regulation limits it to the

11 items mentioned, and does not include a set of the U. S.
Reports.
MR. NOCK:

Correct, Your Honor.

The regulation

did not contemplate anyone's bequeathing an extensive collection

8
of law books to the state®

But the regulation is capable of

instant revision by the Director of Corrections, at his
pleasure.
In its present form, of course, it does bar just
that; but it v/ould be revised under appropriate circumstances
to effect the aims of standardization.
Q

What if an inmate purchases one volume of the

United States Reports that he wants, can he buy one?

Let's

assume he has the money and he orders it from the Government
Printing Office.
MR. NOCKs
Q

Yes, he may.

He may —

So anybody with some money can have a fairly

adequate law library available to him alone.
MR. NOCK:
of adequacy.

It depends on your definition, Your Honor,

The regulations stipulate that personal

possession of law books, or any books, is limited to space
available.
(

In San Quentin, for example, —
Q

All right, space available.

But he could buy

a textbook on the preparation of petitions for habeas corpus,
which wouldn't be available in either the prison or the State
Lav; Library, let's say?
MR. NOCKs
Q

That's correct, Your Honor,

He could have it in his cell?

MR, NOCKs

Yes, indeed

9

Q

But he couldn't loan it to anybody?

MR. NOCK;

That's not clear under present regulations.

Lending would be discouraged.
be impossible.

I'm not prepared to say it would

The regulations are fluctuating; I don't have

all of them at hand,
Q

Is there any regulation about hard covers as

distinguished from soft?
MR. NOCK;

Only institutional regulations. San

Quentin allows, as part of its space limitation, ten hard-cover
volumes of whatever description, legal or otherwise, plus
two orange boxes full of unbound materials.
Q

That's for each prisoner?

MR. NOCK;

For each prisoner.

It will vary from

institution to institution, depending on the space available.
The District Court held a second hearing, oral
argument.

At no time had the court given any indication that

it intended to or was even considering granting relief
broader than that asked for in the complaints, or embraced
itfithin the stipulation.

But it did.

#

It held that the list

of law books was unconstitutional, and that the State had an
obligation to furnish either an extensive — and it seems very
extensive — collection of law books, or, alternatively, to
provide lawyers or law students to assist the inmates, or to
provide some unspecified and perhaps not even conceived of
other method of assisting inmates in preparation of their

10

petitions and complaints.
From that order enjoining the enforcement of the
regulation, and mandating new regulations, we have appealed,
and we contend that this Court has jurisdiction to hear the
instant appeal:
That the regulations in question do not deny access
to the courts to inmates; do not deny them equal protection of
the law; and that the mandatory injunction of the District
Court violates the 11th Amendment.
The issue of jurisdiction is one which the parties
have not raised. We are in agreement that this Court has
j urisdiction.
The issue has been raised by the Court itself, in
its order requesting a special memorandum on the issue of the
three-judge District Court's jurisdiction; the order coming
shortly after the filing of the jurisdictional statement, and
in the postponement rather than notation of jurisdiction, in
Feburary of this year.
Q

Mr. Nock, assuming a man that was an inmate

wanted to file a petition under 2255, what book in that list
would you say would help him?
MU. NOCK:

Oh, I'm sorry.

Under 2254, the California

Weekly Digest would be of some value, depending on how far
back it went.

Witkin's book on California Criminal Procedure

would be of greater value, but -—

11

Q

California Criminal Procedure would help him

under 2255?
MR. NOCK;
Q

2255, is that the Federal prisoners?

I mean 54.

MR. HOCK:

54.

The Federal Habeas Corpus.

Yes,

because Witkin's Criminal Procedure contains the applicable
constitutional law, the decisions of this Court, and the other
federal courts, defining constitutional rights.
It would help him in determining what his rights are
so that he can set out the facts which he thinks give rise to
a denial of these rights.

That would be the function of

Witkin’s.
If he wanted to know which court to file in, if he
wanted to know whom to name as respondent, he’s going to have
to rely on vjord of mouth.

I have never heard of an inmate

making a serious error in either of those situations.
But if he wants to gat — to perform the necessary
procedural requisites to getting a petition filed, all he has
to do is fill out the 11-page form provided by the prison,
free of charge, to all inmates, approved by the local district
courts for inmates’ use.
Q

This California thing would help him in doing

that?
MR. NOCK;

It will help him in finding his

substantive rights, yes, indeed

12
Q

That's what X mean.

Q

Let's see, what’s the date of publication of

Witkin's?
MR. NOCK:

The original book goes back to, I think,

1963; it's supplemented annually or bi-annually by pocket
parts or pamphlet supplements, or both.
Q

It's California Criminal Procedures, isn't it?

MR. NOCK:
Q

Yes.

The title doesn't indicate that it has anything

to do with the federal lav/s.
MR. NOCK:

Well, I urge your perusal.

A deep

perusal of it would show that all of the significant cases of
this Court and the Ninth Circuit, with regard to substantive
constitutional rights of prisoners, are there.
Our position on jurisdiction is the simple one of
res judicata:

that the issue has been determined by a final

judgment of the Court of Appeals.
We can't say too much else.
a three-judge court case.
court.

We argued that it wasn't

We lost our argument before this

The judgment became final.

And nov; we can only assert

that it would be terribly inequitable, at this late date, for
the Court to hold that there was no jurisdiction and send the
matter back for a further appeal.
The case is nearly five years old.
If we are still litigating the proper composition

13
of the tribunal to determine it, then the law has failed.
And we think that any discretion reposing in this Court should
be exercised in favor of assuming jurisdiction, and that by
viewing the case, the judgment that the Court of Appeals has
res judicata, there is no discretion, jurisdiction is clear and
must be accepted.
With regard to the question of access to the court,
we do not believe that law books are necessary for access to
the courts.

It's a cliche to say, but it's equally true,

that all an inmate has to do is set out, in reasonably
intelligible form, a statement of the facts in his case.

This

statement might be fairly long, if the facts of this case are
complex.

It might be short, if he's claiming that he pleaded

guilty because he was beaten or because he was promised
something that he didn't get.

But all he has to do is set

them out.
The court will apply the law.

Arguments, citations

of authority are traditionally considered not only unnecessary
but perhaps even improper in habeas corpus petitions them­
selves.

Notwithstanding that lawyers will append a memorandum

of points in authorities in most cases.
Inmates are not well equipped to use law books.
At least they are not well equipped to use the United States
Reports, the California Reports, the Federal Reports, U. s„
Law Week, and the other publications alluded to by the District

14
Court as not being present*
It is questionable of what value, those books would
be to an inmate in helping him to file a Section 2254 petition,
as Mr. Justice Marshall asked, because they do not give, in
any reasonably accessible and understandable form, the rules
for jurisdiction, the venue, that an inmate might have a
little trouble getting.

He gets those from the form, from

Mr. Witkin's book, and from the Weekly Law Digest.
Q

I'm not sure, Mr. Nock, is it the State's

position that there is no duty whatever, constitutionally
required, to supply any lav/ books?
MR. NOCK:

That is our position, Your Honor.

It is

not.
Q

So, therefor®, whatever you provide is a matter

of grace?
MR. NOCK:

Constitutionally, yes.

We believe that

most of the States provide no law books at all.

And this

violation —
Q

But in the issues here, is that the issue here

that we have to decide?
MR. NOCK:

That is one issue, because the court

enjoined the enforcement of the regulation requiring removal
of laV/ books from two institutions.

To get an outright

reversal of that order, we have to contend that there is no
constitutional right at all.

15

We would be happy, of course, with the finding that
if any constitutional right exists, it is mat by this list.
And I might add, there are omissions in the list
which presumably would be rectified, in the event of an
affirmance.

Minor omissions, such as the absence of the

United States Code — the Judicial Code, X should say,
28 U.S.C. -Q

District Court rules?

MR. NOCK:
in there.

District Court rules certainly should be

That was a serious but inadvertent error.
For three volumes, two of them paperback, one of

hard cover, would provide what we think are all the conceivable
omissions; namely, the volume containing 28 U.S.C., Federal
Rules of Appellate Procedure, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
the volume containing the rules for all California and
California federal courts, and Mr, Sokol's book on Habeas
Corpus.
But, with those possible deficiencies, v/e submit
that the list adequately provides for the inmates' needs.
Equal protection has worked its way in here as a
sort of makeweight.

The District Court relied on it, but

the basic thrust of its position was that the restricted
nature of the lav? book list denied inmates access to the
courts«
We think that it's not particularly fruitful to

16

speak of equal protection in this context* because if inmates
are, by their indigency, disadvantaged so greatly that they
are denied access to the courts, then of course equal protec­
tion would be denied.

But you have got no other circumstances.

The mere fact that they are not as well off as a
rich man is not — does not add much to the discussion that
equal protection is really not the major issue.

Although we

will give it some attention in our Reply Brief.
Finally, the 11th Amendment issue is of considerable
importance.

That Amendment has not been much discussed by

this Court in recent years, but it has been given a great deal
of attention in the lower courts, as many lower courts have
acceded to the temptation to order the States to appropriate
money.
Judge Gignoux, in his opinion in Westberry vs.
Fisher, 309 F, Supp. 12, has affectively answered these
contentions.
At this time, with the Court’s permission, I would
reserve the time remaining after lunch for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

[Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was
recessed, to reconvene at 1:QQ p.xn., the same day.]

AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:02 p,mj
MR, CHIEF JUSUCE BURGER:

Mr. Wahl, you may

proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN ESHLEMAN WAHL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. WAHL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is about tools which are necessary for
access to the courts.

In the English-speaking world, in the

common-law countries, the history of development of tools
which are necessary for access to the courts has been a history
wherein the executive has resisted the extension and the
granting of these tools, starting with the great struggle
to achieve the great Writ of Freedom, the Writ of Habeas
Corpus, highlighted by the English statute in 1695, wherein
treason

defendants were allovred to have counsel at their

trials.
Before 1695, neither treason nor felony defendants,
of course, could have counsel.
Then highlighted by our own Sixth Amendment, because
at that time in England even felony defendants could not have
counsel, they did not get the right to counsel until 1836.
Finally highlighted by our great line, your great
line of equal protection cases, granting rights to transcripts

18

and counsel; beginning? perhaps, in 1956 with Griffin vs.
Illinois through Anders vs» California, and so on and so forth.
As I have mentioned, the executive has historically
resisted the making available of tools for access to the
courts, and we believe that the executive branch of the
California Government again does so here, and does so strongly
and does so quite ably, through my brother Nock.
We concur with the Attorney General of California
that this is a proper case to be heard by a three-judge
court, and the three-judge court was properly convened.

We

think the strong interest of the California Government in
resisting the order granting relief, which came from that
three-judge court, shows that this is the kind of case that
Congress had in mind in passing Section 2281 of Title 28.
This regulation, which was promulgated pursuant to
authority granted by the California penal code, by the
California Director of Corrections involves the legislative
policy of California.

Section 5058 of the California Penal

Code allows the Director of Corrections to provide regulations
*

— to establish regulations for the government of the
California prisons and to change them at his pleasure.
And he has done so here, as counsel pointed out.
In September of 1966, five years ago, he promulgated
a regulation limiting law books in prison libraries to 12
named lav? books, with which you're familiar from counsel's

19
argument*
He also, incidentally, in the same transmittal letter
in which he promulgated that regulation, promulgated an
additional regulation ordering all lav; books in inmates'
personal possession removed and destroyed.
Since that time the California Legislature has
enacted California Penal Code Section 2600, which allows
inmates to receive and own lav-; books in their own cells.
But the restriction, and this is the whole aspect
of this regulation which is really onerous:

the restriction

of prison libraries to 12 named law books, we contend, violates
the rights of indigent inmates — and only indigent inmates —
to access to the courts, which is an integral aspect of due
process of law, and their rights to equal protection of the
laws.
Q

Well, on that jurisdictional point on lawbooks,

do you have any comment on the Hatfield case, which is not
cited in your brief?
MR. WAHL:
Justice Blackmun.

Not that was not cited in my brief, Mr.
The Hatfield case I think supports our

position, and is distinguishable from this case, because
Hatfield had to do with the regulations involved in one Oregon
prison.

This regulation applies Statewide to all California

prisons and penal institutions*
Q

And Oregon had only one penitentiary?

20

MR, WAHL:

Well, no, sir; but I believe the regulation

attacked there was a tiros, space, and method regulation in one
particular* Oregon prison.

It was attacked by the inmate of

that prison.
Q

In other words, you would distinguish Hatfield

rather than take the position that it was erroneously decided?
MR. WAHL:

I would — I could argue either way, Mr.

/Justice Blackmun.
Q

As long as you get away from it.

MR, WAHL:

I don't think the case is a good case,

I think the dictum in the case, concerning — or stating that
prison authorities have no obligation to provi.de prisoners
with opportunities to search for legal loopholes is a feeling
type of statement, but I do not think that it reaches the
questions which we reach here; which are, access to the courts
and due process — due process of law, access to the courts,
and equal protection of the lav/s p with regard to indigent
prisoners»
Q

Mr. Wahl, you mentioned a recently enacted

California statute that permits inmates to have law books in
their cells, did you say?
MR, WAHL:

Yes, Your Honor, Justice Brennan, the

Section 2600 was enacted, I believe, in 1969 — am I not
correct, counsel?
*68,

After this case was — after this action was

)

21
filed, and after v/e had obtained a temporary restraining order,
which, although it's almost moot at this point, remains An
effect by stipulation and order, prohibiting California prison
officials from removing books from inmate's cells, and
destroying them.
Q

Well, what quotations are there on that?

I

suppose there must be space limitations of some kind.
MR. WAHL:

Yes, Your Honor,

The inmates may purchase

law books and legal opinions, anything that's allowed to pass
through the United States Post Office, with the exception of
perhaps matter which might be considered obscene or
inflammatory; this is perhaps a gray area in that regard.
But subject only to reasonable limitations concerning space.
Q

Well, do you find any strength for your

position, your equal protection position in that fact?

MR. WAHL:

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

The best tool you can have if you want to go into
court is a lawyer, the best lawyer you can get.

The second

best tool, if you can't afford a lawyer, is access to the law,
access to the opinions, to the substance, to the procedural
writing on the law,
I think the inmate that's very wealthy can retain
counsel.

The inmate that has means, but not quite as much

means, can buy lav; books.
buy nothing

The inmate that has nothing can

22

Q

So he may supplement — he may purchase books,

as X understand it, outside the list of 12 that are available
in the prison library?
MR. WAHL;
Q

Whereas, you say, you suggest the indigent can't?

MR. WAHL;
Q

Yes, he may.

The indigent may not, or cannot? cannot.

Mr. Wahl, in this building, as you know, we have

a splendid library with many thousands of volumes, and the
Department of Justice has a comparable library with many
thousands of volumes.

On a constitutional basis, how can you

stop short of giving every prison the same kind of tools that
we have here to decide the cases, and that the Department of
Justice and the California counterpart has to carry out these
duties?
MR. WAHL:

Chief Justice, I think this is the most

difficult question, but it’s the question which we squarely
meet.

I think that you do not have to give inmates, obviously,

Benedict on Admiralty? this is the extreme.

Obviously they

don't need this.
Q

Well, let's narrow it down to —

MR. WAHL;
Q

But, on the —

— should they have everything that we have

and that the Department of Justice has, that the Attorney
Ceneral in California ha3, on matters relating to criminal
law and habeas corpus and post-conviction memos?

23
MR. WAHL:
not need. this.

No* Your Honor, they should not.

They do

They should have what they need for meaningful

access to the courts on the first round, I might say,
Q

How many volumes is that?

MR. WAHL:
Q

I would say --

Which volumes are — I won't ask you to list

them, but who is going to identify those volumes?
MR. WAHL:

In the argument in the court below, Judge

Zirpoli asked Mr. Nock and myself if we could coordinate on
establishing a list of lav/ books for California prisons.
Q

Did Judge Zirpoli have soma idea that you could

speak for all the inmates of all the prisons in California?
MR. WAHL:

I think he — he only asked the question,

Your Honor, and I said that I would consider this one of the
most weighty responsibilities that anybody could have; but I
i/ould attempt it. Because it would be better than the present
situation.
I think that counsel supports our position that
additional books are needed in his brief.
Q

As a matter of policy but not as a matter of

constitution, I think.

He has a very narrow limitation on

that.
MR. WAHL:

Well, he doesn't say that the constitution

requires it.
Q

He did in oral argument this morning.

In oral

24
argument this morning he said none by the constitution.

As a

matter of policy he was willing to say that it v?as desirable
to have some.

MR. WAHL:

Yes.

I believe, though, that when he

admits in his opening brief, on page 22, that three additional
law books in the prison libraries would give a knowledge of
venue, jurisdiction, proper parties respondent, and exhaustion
of remedies, and perhaps — although he does not say this ~even proper remedies.
For instance, whether it should be a petition for
Writ of error

coram nobis, or petition for Writ of Habeas

Corpus, which, in California, are brought in different courts.
Petition for habeas corpus is brought in the court which has
jurisdiction over the county, in which the prisoner is
incarcerated; petition for writ of error

corem nobi3 is

brought in the court where the petitioner was convicted.
He admits in his brief that three more books would
give these procedural, or this procedural law, make it
available to the prisoners,
Q

But in his argument he said that the court would

resolve these procedural points; all the prisoner has to do
is fill out the form.
MR. WAHL:
for law books.
Q

Well, Your Honor, that is no substitute

If it is, then we should —
No substitute for law books, but. what value do

25
do you place on it?
MR. WAHL;

I put very little value on it.

I think

that —• counsel’s positions is, or, rather, the State's position
is that this -— that all an inmate needs to do is allege'

the

facts on a blank, on these banks forms, and hand them in, so
to speak, and the courts will do everything that's necessary
to insure that the inmate gets a fair hearing.
Well, this is impossible.
that are filed.

By the number of petitions

The inmate who files a post-conviction

petition has a tremendous burden, because he has already had a
trial.

Perhaps he's had an appeal, but, as you know from the

brief of amicus, California does not at this point inform
inmates who have been convicted that they have a right to an
appeal and a right to counsel on appeal immediately after their
appeal.
So, many times, the inmate's first shot at a, in
essence, a substitute for appeal is a petition for writ of
error coram nobis, or a petition for habeas corpus.
Q

Can I ask you, at what stage in a collateral
/

relief proceeding is an attorney appointed in the California
courts?

Or is he ever?
MR. WAHL;

In general, Your Honor, and I can't ©peak

for all proceedings, I have been appointed in one proceeding
myself, and that was in a petition for writ of error coram
nobis.

After the inmate has filed his petition with the court.

26

and the court had decided that this petition was worthy of
appointment of counsel,
Q

Well, counsel isn't automatically assigned in the

collateral proceedings immediately upon the filing of the
petition?
MR. WAHL:

No, he is not.

He .is not.

The inmate

has to —
Q

It's only when the court decides there's some

substance to it?
MR. WAHL:

Only when the court decides there's some

substance.
Q

But then counsel is appointed?

MR. WAHL:
Q

To conduct the proceedings in the lower court?

MR. WAHL:

Q

California?

Right.

And then on appeal?

MR. WAHL:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

And on appeal.

Is that uniformly true in all counties of
Or only in some?

MR. WAHL:

I believe it's true through the State,

Your Honor.
Q

Is that under a statute or court rule, or what?

MR. WAHL;

It is — counsel may be appointed pursuant

to two statutes, part of the California Psnal Code, for trial
court or first-instance proceedings, and for appellate pro-

27

ceedings.

There is one statute that covers first-instance

appointment, and one statute that covers appellate appointment.
Q

Do you think that with some effort that — it

might take you a year, but do you suppose you and someone else
could make up a handbook on habeas corpus with some forms and
some fundamental ground rules that would be adequate in your
terms to guide an indigent prisoner?
MR. WAHL:

I'm sure that somebody could do this, but

it would have to be more than a handbook, it would have to be
perhaps a book with a supplement, and the supplement should —
Q

That's what I mean, a looseleaf thing that

would be kept up to date, —*
MR. WAHL:
Q

Yes.

— on the fundamental rules.

MR. WAHL:

Witkin's Criminal Procedure was cited by

counsel early —
Q

Yes.

MR. WAHL:

— and I was fairly certain, but I checked

curing the noon hour, and it's supplemented every two years.
The latest supplement in your library upstairs is dated -Mr. Witkin's promulgating letter is dated January 15, 1970.
This is insufficient.

I think that it would be

possible, Justice White, to write and publish the kind of book
you're talking about, and I think this is embraced within the
terms of the three-judge court's order.

The three-judge court

28

did not order an extensive augmentation of
libraries, it left the v/hole matter open.

prison lav;
It merely ordered

the State to come up with new regulations prior to September
1st, which a person will see.
Q

Well, let me ask. you another thing.

Was there,

in your petition or in the findings of the three-judge court,
anything to shov; that any of the named plaintiffs had been
disadvantaged themselves with respect to regulations that we
are now talking about?

Namely, did.they — was it alleged that

they had wanted to file or were in the process of filing, and
that they had been denied certain books that they needed.
Is there any showing of any specific impact of these
regulations on these plaintiffs?
MR. WAHL:

I believe that there was, in the original

complaint, not in this — in the original complaints.

There

were four original complaints, three filed from San Quentin
and one from Folsom.
Q

It’s a class action, or —

MR. WAHL:

It is not a true class action, we've

abandoned the class —
Q

So, in other words, we're talking about the

named parties?
MR. WAHL:
Q

Yes, Your Honor, —

And —

MR. WAHL:

— there were —

29
Q

— I just wondered if there was some showing of

the impact of these regulations on these people, these book
regulations»

Aside from the restrictions which apparently

voiced out of the case on -— the regulations prevent the
loaning of legal materials from the hands of one prisoner to
another; or preventing one prisoner to help another»
MR. WAHL:

Justice White, I think you're referring to

the regulations prohibiting inmates from owning, not loaning;
owning personally owned law books.
Q

I see.

MR. WAHL:

Right.

And that all washed out?

Yes, that's washed out.

California

still prohibits inmates from —
Q

NOW

MR. WAHL:
Q

-- from loaning material back and forth.

— is that an issue in this case?

MR. WAHL:

It was an issue in the lower court; we

did not file a cross appeal, because Judge *—
Q

All right.

So that is not an issue in this -—

before us?
MR. WAHL;

Well, only insofar as it's part of the

basic substratum of the whole opinion.

This is not a case just

having to do with law books and —
Q

I understand that, but —

MR. WAHL:

~ this is access to the courts over the

whole gambit of facilities provided by the State.

30

Q

I don't see anything in ths findings of the

District Court showing that these particular plaintiffs had
ever made an effort to get any lav; books if they ever wanted
to file a petition about anything.
MR. WAHL:

I believe, Your Honor — the reason I say

I believe is because I have not read the original complaints
as opposed to the amended complaint for a long time.

But I

believe that they allege specifically that the denial of lav;
books infringed their ability to file post-conviction petitions
and actions under the Civil Rights Act of 1871.

Certainly in

the amended complaint we did so allege.
Q

Well, after all, you know, these particular

plaintiffs might be learned lawyers.
ME, WAHL:
Q

Robert C. Gilmore —

They might be extremely skillful in this matter.

They might know all they need to knov/.
MR. WAHL:
Honor.

Robert 0. Gilmore, Jr., is not, Your

He's — I think he's a three or four-time lose- from —
Q

Well, that might make him very skillful.
[Laughter.]

Right?
MR. WAHL:

I — he may have attained a good knowledge

of law ever the years, but I think even a lawyer — if I were
incarcerated, without the use of lav; books I would hate to
rely on my memory.

Because my memory would stop, for one thing,

31

as of the moment of my incarceration.

I would not know any

continuing cases.
The appellees say they haven't the money to provide
the books.

But, first of all, we haven't decided what books

are necessary.

If, for instance, we go fairly far, and if Mr.

Nock and I were to have this task — if we were to go fairly
far and say the inmates should have all California Reports,
all California Appellate Reports, all United States Reports,
and all Fed Supp and Fed 2d Reports, plus the texts that have
already been allowed, plus the rules of the District Court,
plus Sokol on Federal Habeas Corpus —
Q

How many sets in each prison?

MR. WAHL:
Q

One set perhaps in each prison.

Well, Mr. Wahl, if you prevail, I take it, w@

would have to lay down some kind of a standard, would we not,
of this constitutional right, to provide access to the books.
What would you suggest as a standard?

I heard you say earlier

something about whatever may be adequate to the need.

Just

what: does that mean?
MR. WAHL:

Your Honor, I almost have to go back to

the kind of thinking that was followed by this Court before
?

you overruled Betts vs. Brady.

In each case, where somebody

comes to the court and says, "I cannot file a petition because
there aren't the law books necessary.”

I don't think you run

into that problem, because I think that if you order that, or

32

if you affirm this order, I don't think there will be extreme
difficulty in working out some kind of a library to start out
with.
Q

Does this order suggest a —-I thought the order

did nothing more than say these regulations are no good? come
up with new ones.

Did it provide any standard to guide the

Commissioner of Corrections as to what the new regulations
should provide?
MR. WAHL:

No, Your Honor, it’s not specific

standards, not by saying these reports or those reports or
these books.
Q

It just said the existing list was inadequate?

MR. WAHL:

It said that the existing list was

inadequate and that some regulation should be promulgated which
would provide the first-instance petitioner with enough access
to the law to allow him meaningful access to the courts on the
first time he files his petition.
Q

And none of these — none of these things on

this list would be — could be satisfied except by having it
at the prison?

The State law library would not be enough?

MR. WAHL:

Your Honor, the v/ay the State law library

works —
Q

Well, your answer is that —

MR. WAHL:

No.

No.

The State law library is

completely — it's just not feasible.

Each inmate is allowed

33

to send in a postcard asking for five volumes once a week.
And he usually gets back another postcard saying they're
all out or they’re not in circulation — well,. I don't want to
represent that as a fact usually.

But quite often this

happens.
Q

Mr. Wahl, assuming that this Court should sit

down and list, the books which the prisons in California have
to have, Federal Reports, U. S. Reports, et cetera — oh,
excuse me — once we do that, what do we do with the habeas
petition, year after next, which says that in Federal Supplement they don’t have the project reports in it?
MR. WAHL;

Well, Your Honor, I don’t know the answer

to that, but I think that constitutional law —
Q

Well, you don't want us to be ssupervising the

libraries of the prisons, do you?
MR. WAHL:
Q

No, I don't think that's —

Well, what compromise do you have befc\*/een that

and doing nothing to offer?
MR. WAHL:

I don't think we reach that question,

because I think that the -- the only question here is whether
this order, which requires — which asks for nev; regulations,
should stand or fall.
Q

Or be modified.

Don't you think the State of California was

entitled to the benefit of the wisdom of these three judges
who have this idea on what would satisfy them?

34

MR. WML:
Q

Yes* Your Honor, I do.

Well, did they give any indication of what they

had in mind?
MR. WAHLs

They ordered the State to come up with

new regulations on —
Q

But what books?

MR. WAHL:
Q

What books?

They — they —

If they don't know, how should the Director of

Prisons know?
MR. WAHL: Well, Your Honor, they did not require
books.
Q

Well, what did they require?

MR. WAHL:
Q

They pointed —

As they see it.

MR. WAHL:

*— pointed out — they pointed out three

examples, and the judges said, of course the alternatives are
legion.

Justice White suggested one which has naver been

discussed, below or between counsel and myself.
Q

In any county of the State is there a Legal Aid

Society or a Public Defender or something like that, who is
available at all to a prisoner who wants to file a petition?
MR. WAHL:

There is legislation — there is prospective

legislation which will establish a Statewide post-conviction
or, perhaps not all post-conviction, but appellate defense
corps.

There are Public Defenders now in California, in a

35

number of counties.

But these Public Defenders only represent

on appeal if they decide the appeal is worthwhile.
Q

But there is no Public Defender, the scope of

whose duties extends to answering a call for help from a
prisoner who wants to file a petition for habeas corpus?
MR. WAHL:

Not to my knowledge.

The American Civil

Liberties Union —
6

Well, Mr. Wahl, if there were something like

that, you probably wouldn’t be here asking for books -for the
prison libraries, would you?
MR. WAHL:
Q

That is correct.

If there were a provision

that any inmate

would have the services of counsel.
MR. WAHL:

That is correct.

I think that it would

be cheaper, of course, to provide law books in prison libraries
than to establish a Statewide system of appellate defenders.
But, of course, dollar considerations are not the important
thing.
Q

When you get through with the flood of

petitions, why, maybe it would be cheaper to have lawyers.
Q

Some places have experimented with placing a

Legal Aid lawyer right in the institution.

Has California

done any of that, other than with the student programs?
MR. WAHL:
Q

Not to ray knoitfledg®, Your Honor.

They have had the student programs, have they

36

not?
MR. WAHL: They have had some attempts to take students
out to the prisons.
Q

But you say this proposed legislation looks

toward this very thing?
MR. WAHL: This is my understanding, and I believe it
has not passed even one house yet; I believe it’s pending in the
Senate, I'm not sure.
Your Honors, when you overruled Betts vs. Brady in
1963, in deciding Gideon, a great number of the kinds of
problems which you're touching on here were urged upon you
by the State of Florida, that if you do this you'll encourage
litigation because new tools, in that case counsel, would be
available, be made available to many, many defendants and
inmates; that there‘d b© an enormous burden on the taxpayers
and that the matter would create myriad and complex new
legal questions.
Q

You don't think it has?

MR. WAHL:

I think that the effect of it has been

practically —
Q

Well, from the vantage point that I sit, I don't

know that I can say it hasn't.
MR. WAHL:

Well, the practical effect in this case,

I think, would be therapeutic and educational.

It's much

better to let inmates try to get out of prison using lav; books

37
than in more socially unacceptable ways*

The psychological

effect on a poor man who can't have more than the 12 books
which the executive says he can have, when somebody else in the
next call has 14 lawyers in a New York fix-m working on his case*
is rather profound.
Inmates know what laymen generally know:

effective

access to the courts has to include knowledge of the law,
through some kind of tool.
bar.

Otherwise, there's no need for the

There would just be a need for.the bench.
If you put the duty on the judge for protecting the

rights of the post-conviction petitioner, you make the judge
an advocate.

And I think that the inmate has to have

knowledge of the law to allege facts — I won't touch on that,
more than briefly.

He doesn't know what facts to allege

unless he has knowledge of the law.

He doesn't know how to

allege the facts and which facts are not relevant or material
at all.
Her© you have a situation where California makes
habeas corpus and coram nobis available, but denies their
effective availability to paupers. And this would seem to
violate all your line of equal protection cases.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Q

Thank you —

Mr. Wahl, just before you sit downs

there was

some discussion in the briefs of the various — of the forms

38

that are provided for the use of prisoners wanting to make
application for habeas corpus and other collateral relief.
I don't find any such forms, example forms, in the Appendix
anywhere,
Are there any?
MR. WAHL:

Have I missed it?

I — we didn't ~ I don't believe we put

them in, Justice Stewart, in the Appendix.

There are about

six pages of dittoed eight-and-a-half by elev@n-and-a-ha.lf

having to do with post-conviction relief say:
the facts which you — A question like this:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE EURGERs

Thank you, Mr. Wahl.

Mow, you have ten minutes, Mr, Nock.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE R. NOCK, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. NOCK:

Thank you, Your Honor.

On the point of the forms, raised by Mr. Justice
Stewart, they are indeed in the original record; and, further­
more, we filed an amicus brief in the case of Johnson vs. Avery,
393 U.S. 483, a couple of terms ago,
In connection therewith, we lodged for trie Court ten
sample copies of each of the three forms available.
Q

May I ask again what that case was?

MR. NOCK:
Q

In connection with what case were they furnished?

MR. NOCK:
Q

Beg your pardon?

Johnson vs. Avery, Your Honor.

Oh, yes.

MR. NOCK:
the Hatfield case.

Mr. Justice Blackmun asked Mr. Wahl about
I would only make the observation that,

although I have no personal knowledge as to whether Oregon at
that time had only one penitentiary or more than one, I got
t he distinct impression from reading the opinion that it had

40

more than one , and I felt that the opinion was written upon
that premise.
Perhaps the matter should be investigated before the
case can be held to stand for the authority — to stand for
the proposition that a three-judge court is not required.
Q

Wall, this -- there is no question that this is

a Statewide application, is there?
MR. NOCK:
Q

No question at all.

And it's the order of a single administrator

authorized by statute to propound the regulations?
MR. NOCK:
Q

Indeed.

Aren't there plenty of cases in this Court

recognizing a three-judge court in this situation?
MR. NOCK:
Q

No.

We had one a couple of terms ago involving

Arizona cantaloupes, in which the order of the — the
administrative order affected apparently only one cantaloupe
grower, although it was normally a Statewide application to
have this three-judge court, and we entertained a direct
appeal here.
MR. NOCK:

Well, I missed that one. Your Honor.

I'm

not familiar with any others except Herkness vs. Arlan, which
didn't decide the particular point, and the affirmance of
the Poresky case, which is cited in the earlier certiorari
petition and Mr. Wahl's brief.

41
Mr. Justice Brennan asked about Penal Code Section 2600«
That is the section which is called the inmates® bill of rights.
It doesn’t mention law books.

It just give inmates the right

to purchase, receive and read v/ritten material of all descrip­
tions with certain specific exceptions.
It has been interpreted, and I think correctly, by
the Director of Corrections as requiring that inmates be allowed
to purchase law books up to specified space limitation. But
it's rather ironic in that the full record will show that,
prior to the enactment of this section, prison rules forbade
inmates to own personally owned law books — to possess
personally owned law books.
And the r€;ason for this, and the basis on which we
defended it, was equal protection. The Director did not want
to have the affluent inmate allowed to own more than the — to
own law books not available to the indigent inmate.

And he

was forced to abandon this position because of the conflict
of the statute, and didn't want to litigate in the State
courts the unconstitutionality of the statute upon that ground.
The appointment of counsel in collateral proceedings,
as raised by Mr. Justice White, is detailed in People vs.
Shipman, v/hich is cited in our brief, that's at 62 Cal.2d.
That's S-h-i-p-m-a-n.

Whether in coram nobis, as that case

dealt with, or habeas corpus? when a facially meritorious
petition is presented, then counsel is appointed, normally, to

42
handle the evidentiary hearing.
There is no appeal from habeas corpus proceedings in
California.
Q

You have to re-file them?

MR. NOCK;

You re-file in the higher court; and the

appointment of counsel does not necessarily carry forward.
There is appeal in coram nobis cases.
Q

But if they file a facially adequate petition

in the higher court, counsel is appointed?
MR. NOCK;

Yes, indeed.

And in coram nobis, if counsel was appointed in the
trial court, then, as a matter of practice, counsel is always
appointed automatically in the court reviewing the denial of
coram nobis, as was the case in litigation which Mr. Wahl and
I handled at an earlier stage.
The Chief Justice asked how many sets of these books
were in each prison, and the regulations provide that there will
be sufficient copies to provide regular access on not less than
a weekly basis.

That's Administrative Manual, Section 330.042,

which is set out in both briefs and the Appendix.
Q

Does that mean, then, that in some prisons there

are several sets available?
MR. NOCK:

Well, the regulation has not been fully

implemented, because of this litigation.

But — and I don't

know 'whether there is more than one set in any prison now.

But

43

there will be# to be sure# if they are fully improvised.
Q

There is at least one set?

MR. NOCK;

Indeed, an infinite number of sets, in

theory.
Mr. Justice white also asked if there were any
Legal Aid attorneys or Public Defenders.

There are not for

the purposes of habeas corpus, although in one county,
Solano County# where a major penal institution is located,
the judge automatically appoints counsel — appoints the
Public Defender as counsel whenever an order to show causa is
issued.

Ee does not, however, normally confer with prisoners.
Some county Public Defenders wi11 continue to

represent their clients, their trial clients, on post-conviction
proceedingswhether they're allowed to do so is a matter be­
tween them and their particular board of supervisors.

There

is neither authorization nor prohibition on a Statewide basis.
Q

If a lawyer is appointed for an indigent at a

criminal trial and it results in a conviction, then does he
have the duty under your Stats law to appeal the case if his
client wants him to?
MR. NOCK;

Yes.

He has the duty to file a notice of

appeal, which gets the case up to the appellate court, which
then appoints counsel if the defendant is indigent and he —
Q

The appellate court then appoints counsel?

MR. NOCK;

Appoints counsel. They --

Usually the same

But if he requests it, or

if the client requests it, he’s normally appointed.
Q

And that's to the District Court of Appeals?

MR. NOCK;

It's now denominated simply as the Court

of Appeals, but —
Q

There are various of them in the district?

MR.NOCK;
Q

Yes, there are a number.

And then there's the discretionary petition, then,

to the Supreme Court of California?
MR. NOCK;
Q

Yes.

Court of Appeals, does he have the duty of carrying it. further?
MR. NOCK;
Q

There is

That is, in affirmance of the conviction?

MR. NOCK:

There is no duty to petition for a hearing.

Counsel is appointed to represent the individual in the Court
of Appeals, is authorized to petition for a hearing, and
normally does.

But he's not obliged to do so.

If the California

Supreme Court grants a hearing, it appoints counsel, who is
usually the same counsel appointed in the Court of Appeals, but
not necessarily.

But normally an attorney will, at least if his client

requests it, petition for a hearing.

ten cases they do.

Oh, yes.

Yes, indeed.

In nearly every

I only recall a couple of cases where an indigent filed

his own petition for hearing.

And I know of none where an

attorney has refused to file one upon the request of his
indigent client.

But he will often write the client and say,

"Well, this appeal was frivolous to begin with, and I see no
point in bothering the Supreme Court", and the client will,
often as not, agree.

46

Q

M.r. Mock, I gather, then, this new legislation,

which Mr. Wahl mentioned to us, won't change the situation very
much, or will it?
MR. NOCK:

I am unfamiliar with the legislation, Your

Honor; it’s news to me.
The question was raised as to whether this — or
rather Mr. Wahl indicated that our position was that this would
encourage, the use of law books would encourage litigation.
We take no such position.

I have no idea whether it would

encourage litigation or not.
Personally, I think law books would make no differ­
ence in the volume of litigation or question whether or how
many — the percentage, I should say, of frivolous petitions.
Legal assistance, with lawyers and law students, might cut down
the volume of frivolous petitions somewhat, although that is
speculative; we would have to rely on the experience of States
which have adopted the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedures Act.
From what I can tell by reading the William & Mary
Lav; Review article, 12 William

&

Mary Law Review article on

the subject of The Verdict is Not in Yet, as to how effective
that Uniform Post-Conviction Procedures Act has been, or its
equivalent has been in cutting down the number of frivolous
petitions.
Q

Is that Lav; Review article in your brief?

MR. NOCK:

No, it's cited in the brief of amici,

47
arid it's at 12 William & Mary Law Review, beginning at page
149.

It's a very extensive and thorough survey of post-

conviction remedies, done for the Federal Judicial Institute.
Q

Volume 12, what page?

MR. MOCK:
Q

Page 149.

Thank you, sir.

MR. NOCK:

It runs for about 75 pages.

And I thank Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Nock.
Mr. Wahl, you acted at the appointment of the Court
and at our request, and we want to thank you for your
assistance to the Court and of course the assistance to your
client.
MR. WAHL: Thank you for your appointment, Your
Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:43 p.m., the case was
submitted.]
