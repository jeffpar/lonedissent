We'll hear arguments

first this rooming in Wo. 71-32, Curtis C. Flood against Kuhn
and others.
Mr. Goldberg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBERG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The issue in this case is the legality under B'ederal
v

Antitrust and State statutory and common law of organised
baseball's reserve system.

To paraphrase Judge Waterman’s

opinion in the Court of Appeals, this is a scheme which binds
every American professional baseball player to one team or its
assignee for life» and which compels team owners to boycott
the player property of another team owner and to boycott any
fellow owner, and to boycott the player himself and blacklist
him, who fails to abide by the agreement among the owners to
eliminate competition in the recruitment and retention of
personnel.
The reach of the reserve system extends beyond the
Continental United States and even our new States, beyond the
24 major league clubs, which are defendants in this lawsuit,
to 155 minor league clubs organised in 21 minor leagues, to
the Mexican league, and even to Japan,

An American player

boycotted by organised baseball today is boycotted by Japanese
employers as well.
Perhaps it may be helpful to the Court if X, having
stated, the issue, now review a few of the pertinent facts.
On October 8, 19SS, Curtis C« Flood, then a major
professional ballplayer for the St. Louis Cardinals, was traded,
his contract transferred and assigned to another national
league baseball club, the Philadelphia Phillies, as part of a
multi-player transaction between the two clubs.
As Judge Cooper found in the District Court, and I
paraphrase him, at the time of the trade he was 32 years old,
a veteran of 12 years* service with the Cardinals, co-captain
of the team by election of his teammates, and acknowledged to ba
a player of exceptional and proven ability.
About that the record ie very clear.

In his active

service with the St. Louis Cardinals, he batted around .300;
won several Gold

Gloves competition, which is the competition

for excellent fielding? and was regarded to be a great asset for
that team, as evidenced by the fact that he was being paid
$90,000 a year.
S?oi a salary, as we know from reading the newspapers,
that baseball owners throw away very lightly.
The circumstances surrounding his assignment, or,
as Judge Waterman said in the Court of Appeals, to use baseball
parlance, sale, are rather interesting as part of the background

of this litigation.

Perhaps it explains why he chose to use

the courts to vindicate his rights, although he had deep roots
in St, Louis, Missouri, not only with the ball club, which he
had served faithfully for 12 years, he was also an artist who
had an artist's studio, he had two photographic studios there
and franchises elsewhere; and he had many friends and family
in St» Louis.
I

He was not consulted about the trade.
contrary.

Quite the

He received a form notice and then a telephone call.

The form notice was a very cryptic one.

The record itself does

not really display what it actually is.

It’s a printed form.

And in that printed form there is a checkmark?

Your contract

is renewed? your contract "has been transferred"? you have
been released from service.
Perhaps I might suggest to Your Honors, you might want
to look at the exhibits rather than the cold record, to see
how this form is filled out.
I should say in all fairness to my distinguished
brothers on the opposite side, he also received a telephone
call, after the transaction was completed? not before.
Presumably he had relinquished all of his rights to
any consultation or disposition of his destiny when, at the
age of 15, he signed a contract

the Cincinnati Reds without

the assistance of an attorney, which was the practice in those
days, and until very recently, until the 1970 contracts.

6

He signed his first professional baseball contract
for an average salary of $4«000.

He of course worked his way

up the ladder, and when he was playing last he enjoyed this
very generous salary»
The fact that he was an exceptional player, as Judge
Cooper, found in the District Court and Judge Waterman, speaking
for the Court of Appeals, confirmed that finding, was illustrated
by his batting average.
After he started to play full time in 1962

ha had

been there since 19S8 — with the St. Louis Cardinals, his
batting averages were, in 1962, .296? 1963, .302? 1964, .311?
1965, .310? 19S6, .267? 1967, .335; 1968, .301? 1969, .285.
X!m not a great mathematician, Mr. Chief Justice and
Associate Justices, but this seems to me to foe a batting
average around .300.
He was also the winner of several Golden Gloves awards.
These are awards given to players for"excellent in fielding."
Ee got this notice, this form notice, without advance
consultation, and then he gat the telephone call telling him
he had to uproot himself, his family, his business connections,
and move to Philadelphia.
Oa December 24, 1969, Mr* Flood wrote to the
•»

Commissioner of Baseball, .Respondent Mr. Kuhn, Bowie Kuhn, th©
Commissioner of Baseball, asserting his right' to negotiate with
teams other than Philadelphia and stating — and it’s a rather

7
interesting exchange«

This was his letter, in part, the rela­

tive part;
"Dear Mr. Kuhn:

After twelve years in the Major

Leagues, I do not feel that 1 am a piece of property to he
bought and sold irrespective of my wishes.

I believe that any

system which produces that result violates my basic rights as
a. citizen and. is inconsistent with the laws of the United
States and of the several states.15
The Commissioner of Baseball, Mr. Kuhn, replied:
"Dear Curt:" — this is faintly reminiscent fcc me
of a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court which reversed the
i

Hamilton case because a witness was addressed by her first
name, while other witnesses were addressed by their last names.
Putting that aside, the letter read:
Dear Curt:

While we agreed with the contention that

as a human being you are not a piece of property to be bought
and sold, and this is fundamental to our society, we could not
see its applicability to the situation on hand.
Faced with this sale, which he deemed to be an
impairment of his legal rights, and a denial of his request that
he be made a free agent, at liberty to seek employment with
Other teams, and without subjecting the new employer to boycott
by the team owners, he had no recourse, in his opinion, other
than to mount this lawsuit.
This lawsuit challenges the reserve system, which

permits this to be done
Mr, Flood adhered to his refusal to play for
Philadelphia during the 1970 season, so when Philadelphia sold
its exclusive right to negotiate with Flood to the Washington
Senators, after the 1970 season concluded, financial necessity
compelled him to acquiesce.
So we have the reserve system, not unfamiliar to this
Court, because this Court has passed upon it, I think wrongly,
in two cases, and particularly Toolson.
I think a very accurate description of the reserve
clause is contained both in the District Court opinion and

n

in Judge Waterman's opinion for the majority of the Court of
Appeals, for the whole Court of Appeals? Judge Moore filed a
concurring opinion.
Judge Waterman, in the Court of Appeals, described
the reserve system as a system, and I quote him, "which,
pursuant to a nationwide agreement" *— and X shall say a word
about that ~~ "clubs, baseball clubs, effectively restrict a
baseball player, if he desires to play professional baseball
at all, to contract negotiations with that club in organized
baseball which first employs or 'reserves* him or with that
club's assignee club, and any subsequent assignee clubs, to
which in the parlance" — and I'm quoting Judge Waterman -—
!!he has been 'sold* or 'traded'."
There is a mere extensive treatment of how the reserve

9

system operates, citing the rules which govern, the baseball
rules- in Judge Cooper9s opinion in the District Court.
And while 1 disagree with his conclusion, I do not disagree
that Judge Cooper correctly describes how the reserve system
operates.
Briefly, in addition to Judge Waterman*s pungant and
succinct description, it goes beyond that:
bid for his services, once he signs.
approach any other club.

No other club may

He is not permitted to

That's called the no tampering rule.

A club which violates this rule is subject to boycott
fcy the other clubs.

In fact, any player that plays for another

club which violates this rule is subject to discipline by the
Commissioner of Baseball.
And it also extends beyond what Judge Waterman did
not deal with, clubs, the major league clubs; it extends to the
minor league clubs; it extends to the Mexican League; it
extends even to Japan,

This is uncontradicted in the record.

Nov;, Mr. Flood stayed out in 1970 and pursued this
lawsuit, challenging the reserve system on several grounds.
?irst, that it violates the antitrust laws of the
United States.
Secondly, that it violates the antitrust laws and
common law of the several States.
And, third, that it violates the Thirteenth Amendment
to the Constitution of the United States, prescribing that

10
indentured service, as well aa slavery, should be not permitted.
Now, having stayed out in 1970
confronted with 1971«

,

as 1 have said, he was

At that time Philadelphia, the team that

"owned" him — again 1 quote, paraphrase Judge Waterman*s
opinion

the team that "owns" him sold him to Washington,
He agreed to play for Washington»

He was there for a

few months, and we can all take judicial notice, I think, of
what occurred, laymen, lawyers and I believe this Court,
tried.

He

He had been laid off for a year.
After trying for a few months in spring training and

in the actual season, he was benched? he coulcl not easily regain
his skills, which is not difficult to understand? and he left,
Now, the transfer to Philadelphia — the transfer
from Philadelphia to Washington was accompanied by stipulations
between ourselves and opposing counsel that this would not
prejudice this lawsuit.

I'm well aware, however, that, private

people cannot stipulate a case for this Court, but the transfer
did not moot this case.
In R&dovich, the football case, this Court held that
the success of a bo^rcott did not moot a case.
And, furthermore, he had experienced damages in 1970,
and he had suffered impairment of his career.
Now I turn to the reserve clause —
Q

He indicated in his letter, I noticed in the

record, in his letter in late 1969 to Mr. Kuhn, that Philadelphi

H
had offered him a contract.

What were the terms of that

contract?
MR. GOLDBERGS
Q

They offered him —

Not all the details- but just in terms of

salary.
MR. GOLDBERGs

They offered him an increase, to

$100,000, with salary and other benefits,,
what he was contesting.

But that was not

He was contesting being removed without

his consent and, as his letter states, he didn't want to be
treated as chattel property.
Q

Right.

MR. GOLDBERG: A question of principle.
Q

I just wondered, as to your —

MR. GOLDBERG:
Q

Yes.

what you're now telling us about the lack of

mootness and about his damages in 1970.
MR. GOLDBERG:
Q

Yes.

X mean he was offered a hundred thousand dollars?

MR. GOLDBERG:

Yes, he was offered that.

It i3 not, by the way, new, although X have seen
articles about it which indicate that this high-paid ballplayer
did things, you know, that “why did he do it when other ball­
players ,s

— who, by the way, despite all the stories in the

press in the five years previous, had only averaged a little
over $8,000 a year. s*Why this high-paid ballplayer did this?”

12
He did it, as he simply said, out of principle.
wanted to be treated as chattel property.

Ha no longer

He made that

decision on his own, and although ha has been supported in this
litigation by the Players Association, about which 2 shall later
have reference, this was his decision.

The record is very plain

on that.
In fact he was told by the director, Mr. Miller, that
he had a tough case.

Meverthless, he felt in good conscience

he had to pursue it.
Q

As a practical matter, though, he had no real

chance of remaining in St, Louis and negotiating another
contract with the St. Louis club; he would have had to go to one
of the other teams, even if it hadn't been for the reserve
clatise.
MR. GOLDBERGs That's right, Mr. Justice, provided
this clause is legal.
Q

And I shall say it is not.

But even if it's not legal, if St. Louis is

trading, regardless of the reserve clause, they're not going
to negotiate another contract with him, though.
MR. GOLDBERG;

He said that, what he wanted was the

opportunity, as a free agent, to negotiate his own deal? not
to be traded, as this form that 1 have. referenced, indicates,
without his consent.
Wow, the reserve clause has been in existence 100
years; long antedated any union that the ballplayers formed,

13
which 3: shall talk about in the labor exemption.

With one

important modification.
In 1955, the reserve system was extended for the'
first time to potential new players who had never signed an
agreement with any team, and. typically these are teenagers,
just graduated from high school or who have dropped out of high
school.

This had never been done.

In this category, not in

the minor leagues, they until 665 enjoyed the privilege of
negotiating their first contract.

That:no longer exists.

Tliey have a semi-annual draft.
There is another factor which I shall advert to when
I talk about the so-called labor exemption.

Judge Cooper found

that the baseball's reserve system is not presently collectively
agreed to.

The citation is in my brief.

I shall not burden

you with the citation.
Now, Flood decided to sue.

He challenged, as I have

said, on several grounds.
Q

Mr. Goldberg, may X ask you:

Suppose it had

been collectively agreed to; would your position be any
different?
MR. GOLDBERG:

No.

And X shall discuss that when

I come to the labor exemption.
Q

I hope youpre going to get to that; you’re

talking rather -~
MR. GOLDBERG:

I will move fast

14
[Laughter.}
Because of the shortness of time.
We have these three propositions.

On the first, the

antitrust laws, we are confronted obviously with two decisions
of this Court;

Federal..Baseballf decided in 1922? and Toolson,

decided in 1953.
Q

And they would have to be overruled?

MR. GOLDBERG;
should be overruled.

They would have to be overruled.

They

They should be overruled for very good

reasons,
They should be overruled because — the first one,
Federal Baseball was not, as Judge Friendly has said, "Justice
Holmes’ happiest hour".
Q

Indeed, ~—

But I take it, Mr. Goldberg, those both dealt

with the issue of statutory construction?
MR. GOLDBERG;

Yes.

But even then it showed — I

doubt that Justice Holmes had ever seen a ballgame.
Q

Of course, the Court doesn’t readily overrule

statutory construction cases.
MR. GOLDBERG;

Yes.

But it has, and quite recently,

as 1 shall point out in a moment, in reading from an opinion
written by Justice Stewart for a unanimous Court, in construing
a statute.
?
That is the case that put aside the Collins vs.

Har demarm *

13
The Federal Baseball in fact was abandoned by Justice
Holmes the very next terra, after he had written it.
And Too3.son was a per curiam which merely said that.
Well, we’ve done it, even though we think it's wrong, because
interstate commerce has changed? we ought to leave it to Congress»
And the. Court was troubled at that time with whether or not
prospective rulings could be met.
That problem of course has been settled by this
Court even quite recently.

And I shall mention that.

Now, I say to you very simply, 1 shall not belabor it,
that Federal Baseball was wrong, the development of the law of
what constitutes commerce has proceeded apace, and no one would
doubt that baseball is engaged in interstate commerce.
This Court in Radovich, this Court in Shubert Theater,
this Court in the boxing area have all characterised sports,
if they're so called, as in interstate commerce.

Baseball

indeed is in interstate commerce in a very big way.

It's a

It sends people all over the
It realises enormous revenues from

television.
1 think I saw the other day that in the National
contract television rights, they realised $41 million and then
it’s supplemented by local contracts.
Now, we have hers a question of stare decisis»
Mr. Justice Stewart, when I mentioned that I thought

16
that this had been put to rest involving a statute —
Q

Mr* Goldberg, just before you start on that, do

you think that Federal Baseball and Toolson indicated that the
baseball wasn't engaged in interstate commerce?
labor, labor isn't an article of commerce?

Or is it that

Services isn't a

matter, an article of commerce, as a matter of statutory
construction and the intent of Congress?
But you just say that labor is an article of commerce?
MR. GOLDBERG;
treated.

It depends on the way labor is

Labor should not be an article of commerce.

(?)

says it should not be a commodity.
Q

Well, is Flood different?

MR. GOLDBERG:
Q

Yes,

Why?

MR. GOLDBERG:

Because he's been treated as a commodity,

as everybody is under the reserve rule,

He's not treated as

labor, as we traditionally understand labor people to be
treated.

Free American workers determine their own destiny.
Q

Well, I gather Radovich settled that?

ME. GOLDBERG:

Yes, it did.

The same issue was

raised in Radovich, and decided against the football owners
which brought Radovich — which were involved in the Radovich
decision in this Court.
It was argued in Radovich, and I do not know7 what
prompted this Court to take certiorari.

I had not assumed that

1?
the purpose of the grant, and this necessarily follows, if it
is treated as a labor exemption, which I shall talk about, if
it is decided that the labor exemption, so-called, applies,
then it certainly applies to football.

They have a union.

It certainly applies to hockey.
And the consequences of a decision holding that the
labor exemption applies to baseball necessarily means that it
applies to all other sports, so-called sports.
By the way, it's very interesting, when you read this
record, as X know you have or will, Bowie Kuhn, the Commissioner
of Baseball, does not refer to it as a sport.

He refers to it

as entertainment.
If it’s entertainment, it8s governed by your decision
in Shubert, which says that it7s subject to antitrust regula­
tions.
Tha decision, Justice Stewart, that I mentioned in
the statutory construction, is your own, in Griffin vs.
Brackenridge,

Perhaps I should read only a few sentences.

Whether or not Collins vs. Kardemann, construes the
Civil Eights Act, was correctly decided on its own fact is a
question with which we need not here be concerned.

But it is

clear in light of the evolution of decisional law that has
passed since the cess was decided, that many of the constitu­
tional problems perceived there simply do not exist.
Justice Holmes conceived there was a constitutional

IB
problem»
Little reason remains therefore not to impart to the
words of the statute their apparent meaning»
I move quickly to the next point,

I think it ouqhfc

to be overruled, it’s an anomaly in the lav?? every commentator
has said it5s an anomaly in the law to adhere to TooIson and to
Federal Baseball as improperly decided,
Sow I move quickly to the next point,

And that is

State law.
Peculiarly enough, as Judge Waterman says, they were
on the horns of a dilemma.

If federal lav? did not apply

because it was not interstate commarce, why should not State
law apply?

tod Judge Waterman said, contrary to the District

Court which was preempted, Judge Waterman said that it was —
it interferred with interstate commerce.
I take it this had no foundation whatsoever.

The

decisions of this Court are plenty and ample on the subject
that State laws, which carry out the purposes of the great
federal statute, the Sherman Act, which are not inconsistent
ought to be applied.
And that is the law, Senator Sherman, the author of
the Sherman Act, said that our law is designed to supplement
not displace federal lav?.
or implied.

There is no preemption here, express

There is no conflict, nor has any court found one.

As Waterman says, there's a necessity for uniformity, but there

19
was no inquiry into the State statute to determine whether
there was.
We have listed the State statutes and briefly
summarised —- they are the same as the Sherman Act — those
States that have adopted it.
So the decision, for example, in the Continental Air
Lines case covers that.
Finally —
Q

Has this man left baseball?

HR. GOLDBERG:

Q

Has the petitioner left baseball?

HR. GOLDBERGS
Q

Pardon ?

Yes, he left.

He left now.

Is the case moot, therefore?

MR. GOLDBERG?

No, it. is not, because the '70

season io the season where he he.3 a right to recover damages,
because he returned later? and he also has a right to decide
if he wants to go to the minor leagues or Japan, which are
subject to the same rules.
1 shall say one word, just take a few more minutes
of my time, and cut it off for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your rebuttal time is

used up.
MR. GOLDBERG: About — yes.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

About the —
Excuse me, your time is

completely consumed? but we'll extend it three minutes, and

20

enlarge yours three minutes, Mr, Porter.
MR. GOLDBERG;

There is nothing to the baseball

argument that a new-found affection for the collective
bargaining and the labor act? I share that affection.

»
In fact.„

I shared it for many, many years.
Under the decisions of this Court, this is hard-core
violation of the antitrust laws.
a blacklist.

This is a group boycott, and

All owners under the rules are obligated not to

deal with a player if he is on a reserve list.

He is black­

listed, not only here but in Mexico and in Japan.

And this is

the most obvious restraint of trade known to man.
I put a simple illustration:

as Your Honors well

know, I once represented the Steel Workers.
proposition;

Let rr>© put a

Suppose the Steel Workers Union — it would never

do this — agreed with U. S. Steel that if a man signed up he
had to work for U. S. Steel all his life, and if Bethlehem
employed him, if he left and Bethlehem employed him, U. S.
Steel would not supply parts for their fabricating, or steel
for their fabricating operations.

Is there any doubt in

anybody's mind that that would be a per se violation?

Not at

all.
Finally, so there's nothing to this labor exemption,
as the Court said recently, the Court said in Pennington.»
*

Justice White's opinion, you cannot just say conditions of
employment and wages, you have to interpret the terms.

This

21
purports to be a condition of employment? servitude is not a
condition of employment nor is slavery.
Can you conceive any union being charged with a
failure to bargain because of this?

1 cannot conceive of that.

Furthermore, this goes beyond the bargaining unit,
the opinion, Justice Brennan, that you just wrote confirming
Pennington.

Because if covers the minor leagues, and it

goes beyond that.

So it gets out as a bargaining unit.

And for all of these reasons 1 would say that none

of the arguments have any basis.

Mr. Flood was the victim of

a reserve clause which, in my view, violates all of the anti­
trust statutes.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

Thank you.

Mr. Porter.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL A. PORTER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT KUHN
MR. PORTER %

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
£ wish to take just about five minutes.

I represent

the respondent Bowie Kuhn, the Commissioner of Baseball, who
was a defendant below in only Count One, and that was the
antitrust count.
Mr* Hoynes then will discuss the issues of the case,
including what: we all agree is the central issue, namely, that
this litigation involves basically a labor dispute.

22
Nowthe Commissioner of Baseball serves for a term
of seven years, with broad plenary powers both of administra­
tive and quasi-judicial nature, to preside over the institution
of professional baseball.
His principal and fundamental function is to maintain
the integrity of the sport on the playing field and the public
confidence in the honesty of the game.
He has the authority, under the rules of baseball, to
take whatever action in his judgment is in the best interests
of baseball.

And he is required on frequent occasions to

evaluate under that standard and weigh impartially the
interests of players, the clubs, and the fans alike.
Now, baseball, as it4s been recognised by this Court
again and again, is a unique structure primarily bottomed on
responsible self-government?

the office of the Commissioner,

as we all recognise, beginning with Judge Landis, was established
to police the honesty of the sport?

Since it has developed

into an institutional apparatus, to reconcile many minor and
major issues in the proper administration of the structure as
a whole.
Q

Well, Mr. Porter, does the structure of other

sports differ today?
MR. PORTER;

Football, basketball, hockey?
Not perceptively, Mr. Justice Brennan.

They have copied, including the reserve systems, essentially
the same structure, the pattern as baseball.

23

And yet they come within the application of the

antitrust laws?
MR. PORTERs Well, it has never been challenged
except in Radovich,

They have settled a number of cases, as

Mr* Hoynes will develop.
exemption„

The Spencer Keywood case is a notable

And they have been living on the brink, I think,

had they recognized it
Q

Well, I mean, you're not making an argument for

uniqueness of baseball with respect to its structure?
MR* PORTERs
Q

Oh, indeed, we are.

You are?

MR. PORTERS

Indeed, we are.

Yes, sir.

And 1 could

develop that, if time permitted, where we have spent 25 percent
of our revenues for player development, major league revenues.
Now, the other sports have their farm systems, the
college, and there are many other distinctions.
Nov;, the Commissioner, because of his neutral position,
has no participation in the bargaining that is going on with
respect to the reserve system*

However, he testified in the

District Court that this system was not a fossilised system
engraved in tablet of stone, it was subject to changes and
modifications, and, indeed, it has been changed and modified.
The Commissioner also gave important testimony on two
particular areas that I would direct your attention to;
Ho. 1, that without some continuity of employment

24
between elub-g and players,, the relativa equality of competition
and the honesty of the sport would be seriously impaired.
1 would respectfully direct Your Honors5 attention to the
Commissioner's testimony, which is summarised in our Appendix.

violation of the antitrust laws rather than to coverage?
MR. PORTERi

Well, I think, Mr, Justice White, that

this is a labor dispute, and is a b&rgainable issue, as Judge
Cooper found, and as I think the Second Circuit, as Judge
Cooper said, that all evidence has not been fully exhausted

in the bargaining process,

And, indeed, as Mr. Hoynes will

develop, this issue was on the bargaining table when TooIson
— when this litigation was brought

by the players union.,

Also I would direct your attention, finally, to' the
Commissioner's testimony, the exhibit that he sponsored, which
is Exhibit A, found at page 407 of the Appendix.
Q

But, Mr. Porter, you just said when this litiga­

tion was brought by the players union?
MR, PORTERs

Oh, it was financed by the players

union, indeed, that's conceded in this record.
One final point I would like to make, .in spite of
all the rhetoric *—
C

Are you saying this is their lawsuit not

Flood's?
MR. PORTER: Absolutely, yes, sir.

—

25
And in spite of all the rhetoric that we hear here
about this being a per s® violation, in the prior record below,
with the exception of the petitioner, Mr. Flood, all the
witnesses in support of Mr. Flood's case testified that some
form of reserve system was essential.
I will halt there, I see my time is consumed, Mr.
Chief Justice.

Mr. Hoynos will continue.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE EURGER:

Mr. Koynes.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS L. HOYNES, JR., ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF OTHER RESPONDENTS
MR. KOYHESs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I am counsel for the National League, and 1 here
represent the

major league clubs and the two major leagues.

Tha issues presented here are ■—
Q

Is it your position that baseball is not commerce?

MR. HOYNES:

No, it is not my position that baseball

is not commerce, Your Honor,

I think that has been well

recognised, and, indeed, was recognised by the Toolson decision.
The issues here are much broader than Curt Flood’s
particular situation, which has been described by Mr. Justice
Goldberg.
This is fundamentally, in our view, institutional
litigation concerning tha normal operation of baseball's basic,
fundamental, and historic rules.

And the real protagonists

26
here, as suggested by Mr. Justice Brennan’s question a. few
moment ago, the real protagonists are the players union, the
Major League Baseball Players Association, and the major
league clubs, which I represent.
Q

Does the record show us anything about the union?

MR. HOYNESs The record shows, in very great detail.
Your Honor, as does the opinion of Judge Cooper, he devoted a
good portion of his opinion to it,to tracing the effectiveness
of bargaining, the effectiveness of the union.
Q

Well, 1 mean the scope, its extent, numbers of

players who are members.
MR, HOYNESt

Yes, all the players in major league

baseball, really, are members of the Players Association.

The

association has been recognized by the clubs as the formal
collective bargaining agent for the players; and all of the
terms and conditions of employment of a major league baseball
player are in fact on the table on a more or less constant
basis.
Q

Have there been many NLRB proceedings involving

the relationships between the clubs and this association?
MR. HOYNES; Well, there’s been no dispute over the
propriety of their representation.

However, there have been a

coup!© of unfair labor practice charges that have been brought,
and processed by the NLRB, and the NLRB of course asserted
jurisdiction, and that point is not debated by either side; it's

27
part of the workings of major league baseball as we know it
today and have known it for some time„
Q

Those proceedings you we re referring to were the

ones by the umpires?
MR, HOYNES:

No, I was referring fco proceedings

involving the Major League Baseball Players Association itself.
Q

The players themselves?

MR. HOYNES;

Yes, Your Honor; sorts dispute at the

beginning of this year on the question of the relationship
between television revenues and bargaining on the pension plan.
There was a dispute as to the extent to which we were required
to disclose certain information.

MR. HAYNES;

If the plaintiff were a minor league

Your Honor, I would not be able to say to you that

bargaining, directly representing the minor league players, was
being carried on.

But the Major League Baseball*

Players

Association certainly has bargained with the interest of the
minor league players in mind; indeed, many of the grievances
that have been brought before our —

Yes, but the players aren't — the minor league

players, in terms, aren't settled by the bargaining between

Yes.

MR. HOYNES:

No, there's no direct formal representa­

tion by the minor league players.

It is — that does not mean

Q

So your position would not be the same if this

wore a minor league player?
MR. HOYWES;
Your Honor.

Well, my position would be the same,

I simply would not be able to point to the direct

one-to-one relationship between a formal bargaining representa­
tive and that particular player, as I can with Mr. Flood, who
was clearly represented as a member of the organisation.
But X would still argue, Your Honor, even if a minor
league player were here.

Mr. Hoynes, how far does representation of Flood

For example, did the owner consult with the Players

Association about this?
MR. HOYNES:

You mean as far as the assignment of

Mr. Flood's contract?
Q

Yes, sir.

MR. HOYNES:

No, that contract assignment took place

under the rules, v/hich themselves were the subject of bargaining.

My question was:

how much representation did

Well, no one in the —

As to this trade which is the basis of this

Now, what position .did the union take on that?
Or do you call it a union?
MR. HQYNES:
Q

Mo, I call it a union, Your Honor.

Well, what position did the union take on this?

Did they ever object?
MR. HOYNES:

The union, after the transaction took

place, conferred with Mr. Flood, as 2 understand it, and
ultimately agreed with him to finance the cost of his litigation,
and, as I was about to point out,it is quite transparent, I
believe, from a reading of the record that the Players Associa­
tion, the players union, has in fact controlled this litigation
from beginning to end.
Q

I understood that the union and management, what

they were interested in is non-litigating? is that right?
MR. HOYNES:

We certainly were interested in non-

litigating, Your Honor. We believe that the —
Q

Well, what negotiation was done between this

union that protected Flood?
MR. HOYNES: Well, when the lawsuit began —Q

What, if anything, before the lawsuit?

MR. HOYNES:

No representations by the union were made

30
Q

Is that normal?

MB, HOYNES ;
Q

— seeking any —

Is that normal in union-management relationship?

MR, HOYNES:

Your Honor, I believe it is during the

pendency of a collective bargaining agreement.

These rules

were part of an arrangement, and bargaining was not to take
place until the subsequent period.

The transfer was entirely

in accord with those arrangements,
Q

So you're saying that a union, which says to

management,"You can pick up a man and throw him out the door,”
without any recourse, that that's a union?
MR. HOYNES: Well, Your Honor, I don't believe the
union has ever agreed to that, and I don't think that's what
happened to Mr. Flood.
Q

Well, did the union agree to the bargaining —

that paragraph which is under attack here?
MR. HOYNES:

The reserve clause.

The reserve system is not simply a

paragraph, but a number of interrelated rules, all of which -Q

Agreed to by the union?

MR. HOYNES s
Q

That's hard to believe.

MR. HOYNES:
Q

I believe that's right, Yo\jr Honor.

Beg pardon — with the management.

You mean that in the record it show's that?

MR. HOYNES:

Well, Your Honor, there are the collec­

tive bargaining agreements in the record, and they are the

31
printed documents —
Q

Well, is there anything that shows that the union,

which you call a union -MR. HOYNESs
Q

Yes.

-- agreed to these provisions?

MR. HOYNSS;

Your Honor, a collectively bargained

agreement is an agreement signed, obviously, by the union and
by management and all of the major league rules were encompassed
by that agreement.

I can't think of a plainer way to demonstrate

that.
Q

Well, what good is the union?

MR. HOYNES: Well, the union serves, Your Honor, as I
think,having participated in the bargaining on management's
side for the last several years, has made remarkable gains with
respect to player-club relationships.
Q

What has it done concerning individual players*

re1ation ships?
MR. HOYNES;

Q

Wouldn't you say nothing?

MR. HOYNES:
Q

Wall, the union has bargained —

Wo, we're not saying nothing.

Wouldn't you say under the reserve clause there

was no room for bargaining?
MR. HOYNES;

No, I certainly would not say that.

I

would say that the reserve clause itself, the very core of the
reserve clause is a subject, admitted by both sides, a mandatory

32
subject of bargaining and something about which bargaining was
going on when interrupted by the pendency of the filing of this
lawsuit.
And it is back to that forum, Your Honor, that we
believe this matter should be remitted.
Q

You mean back to the union?

MR. HOYNES:

Back to the collective bargaining table,

Your Honor? yes.
Q

Well, even though the union is not protecting the

individual?
ME. HOYNES: Well, the union is protecting the
individual, Your Honor. This union is very well —
Q

How is the union protecting this individual, the

named petitioner, Curtis C* Flood?
MR. HOYNESs
for future benefits.

Your Honor, the union bargains, obviously,
And what’s at stake here is the shape of:

baseball and its employee relations, really, for the future.
Mr. Flood is, I think there’s no question about that, he is
retired from baseball now; ha's through with baseball.
Q

He —*

You couldn't call it voluntary, would you?

MR. HOYNES: Well, I would call it voluntary retirement
at this point, Your Honor.
Q

Oh, you would?

MR. HOYNES:

He was playing for Washincfton, and felt

that ho no longer could play satisfactorily to his standards.

33
And he had other problems, as we11, and left the country.
We were most eager to have him play during the
pendency of this lawsuit.

We told his counsel repeatedly that

we would make no argument whatsoever that the case had been
mooted, and that we wanted to see Curt Flood play and living
his normal life, and tha litigation could go forward.
They would not hear one word from us? that there was
something inconsistent about him playing and litigating.
made no threats.

We

It was suggested constantly that this be done.

And in 1971 Curt Flood decided he would return to
baseball, and his play was of a caliber that ■— he’s a proud
man? his play was of a caliber that was not satisfactory to
him.

He had other financial and business problems which caused

him to leave both the Washington area and the United States.
We regretted that very much.

We would have been delighted to

see Mr. Flood continue along in a prosperous career.
Q

None of this came out.

MR. HOYNES:
Q

Beg pardon?

Hone of this is in the record?

MR. HGYNES;

None of which is in the record, Your

Honor.
Q

.His playing with Washington or any of his other

business?
MR. HOYNES:

Well, the record was closed before he

began to play with Washington, Your Honor; yes.

I think that

34
Justice Goldberg adverted to it, and Isura you can taka
notice of that fact.
As 1 mentioned before, it is our position that the
players union is entirely in control of this litigation, and
that it is concerned less with remedying any alleged wrong that
may have been performed on Mr. Flood than it is trying to
reorganise the employment relationships in professional baseball.
In other words, the union is after larger game hare.
Mr. Flood's testimony itself was isolated from the
.rest of the case presented on behalf of petitioner.

He testified

that he would like the entire system to be torn apart, and would
like every ballplayer to be free to negotiate with any club
of his choice.

While all of the other witnesses that testified

on behalf of the petitioner limited their testimony to certain
modifications that they suggested in the reserve system, all
assuming that some continuity of player control, some form of
player reserve system, would in fact be necessary.
This testimony represented a repudiation, really, of
Mr. Flood's position, and left him the forgotten man for the
remainder of the case.
In fact, no evidence at all was offered on the
damages which Mr. Flood's complaint indicated he had suffered
to his outside business interests in St. Louis; not a shred
of evidence was ever offered on that matter.
'thus the union, as I've said, was after larger game.

35
It intended to subvert the collective bargaining process in
baseballf to obtain gains which it had not yet achieved at the
bargaining table, outside of the bargaining table; and to
unravel the very fabric of past collective bargaining, all of
which was interwoven intimately with the reserve system.
In order to accomplish this purpose, the petitioner
has attempted to persuade this Court to move radically in two
new directions *

first, to change the law abruptly and totally

by overruling the narrow and well-confined precedents of long
standing, which now indicate that baseball is not subject to
the antitrust laws; and second, to declare illegal., per se
illegal, I believe, according to their briefs, baseball’s
historic reserve system, as the trial court found, the corner­
stone of the game.
tod to act, in effect, as a compulsory arbitrator
in an employee-employer dispute about the terms and conditions
of employment in baseball, in fashioning a new system.
The trial was —
Q

Mr. Hoynes, at this point v7ould you comment as

to why baseball moved to extend the — why did it move into the
draft system in 1965, to the new player?
MR. HOYNESs

Your Honor, the adoption of the draft

system is simply one more step in a number of steps that
baseball has taken over a period of years to try to equalise
competition on the playing field.

Preceding the draft rule,

36

there were rules about bonuses, you may remember this.

If a

bonus of a certain size was awarded to a player, that player
must serve immediately on a major league roster.

All of these

were efforts to prevent the clubs with the largest accumulations
of wealth from being able to attract the most skillful young
ball players.
And none of those systems seemed to —
Q

The bonus system itself didn8t come into effect

until fairly recently, did it?
MR. HOYNES: Beg pardon?
Q

Whan were the first bonuses paid?

MR. HOYNES; Well, I think the first bonuses probably
of large amount ware paid in the Fifties,

Sometime before the

rule of the *65 free agent draft.
I might note on the free agent draft subject, that
all of tiie other sports have free agent drafts; in fact, in the
other sports, the rights to negotiate with a player are
perpetual.

Once an amateur is drafted, he can negotiate

only during his lifetime with the club that drafted him.

In

baseball, the negotiating rights.are only of six months*
duration.

And if a player does not sign with the club that

drafted him, he may be reselected, reselected by another club,
Q

Mr. Haynes, what are the principal differences

between the standard National Football League contract and
the type of contract which Mr. Flood had?

37

MR. HOYNESs

Wall, Your Honor, there are a number of

difbareness in the employment relationship between football and
baseball, and a number of differences in the sport, the character
of the sports themselves.
An obvious difference that receives much publicity
is the option rule in professional football, a system by which
a player can declare at the beginning of the season that he
desires to move to another — other pastures at the end of that
season,

He then plays an option -- they call it playing out the

option.
At the end of that additional year, he is technically
free to seek employment by another club.

The rule has another

provision that says that any other club that signs that player
must compensate the club from which the player came, either in
an amount measured by money,players, draft choices, what-haveyou, satisfactory to that former club? or, if no agreement can
be reached, that the Coramissioner will establish compensation.
The Major League Baseball Players Association has
denounced this 'arrangement as essentially a fraudulent one.
In fact, there has been little or no mobility historically in
football, and if one examines the collective bargaining process
going on in football, one will see that the football players
themselves denounce the arrangemet as being essentially a
cosmetic one and not one that affords them any real freedom of
choice in seeking their employment.

3e

Other differences in the employment relationship in
football and baseball are that in football the management may
establish the rules ©f the game? in baseball our collective
bargaining agreement expressly recognises the duty of the
major league clubs, before enacting any rule involving in any way
player benefits or player rights, to negotiate that rule with
the. players.
Also in baseball' there is a grievance procedure, which
we've agreed to with the Players Association, one that's un­
paralleled by any other sport, which places all grievances
about club and player matters, except; those involving integrity
which are reserved for the Commissioner, but the garden variety
grievance goes before an arbitrator external to the game, a
man, now, named Lewis Gill, former president of the American
Academy of Arbitrators, jointly selected by the union and by
the clubs.

He's handled dozens of grievances in baseball,

and makes final and unappealable decisions with respect to them.
And, finally, with respect to the differences in th©
character of the game, the games themselves, football, for
example, and baseball? football is able to reach out and pluck
from the college campuses players ready to play professional
football, already nationally known and skilled.
Baseball has no such alternative.

Baseball has an

elaborate minor league system in which it develops its own
players, and to which it devotes approximately 25 percent of

39
the major league gross revenue, something over a million dollars
per year per club poured into the minor leagues to keep the
flow of players, to keep this player development flow operating.
There isn’t any sport, any professional sport that has anything
that even approximates that sort of an arrangement of those
sort of expenses and difficulties of player development.
ted for all of these reasons, we believe, and the
Players Association recognises in their bargaining with us, that
the experience in other sports is, while not dissimilar from
baseball, really, nevertheless, neither is it a good guide for
the baseball world.

There are important differences in the

businesses, and we feel and, as I have said, the :players union
feels, too, that we must work out our own relationships in
the light of the realities of the baseball business, not in
the light of what some other sport may do, or some

arid

principles? but on the practical level at the bargaining table
by the people who must live with the results of their labor
with iiljje players and the club owners.
0

Well, why are they paying for this lawsuit?
I »

I'm using youf words, you said that.
MR. H0YEE3 s

Sure, you’re expressing a fact, Your

Honor.
Q

Well.

MR. HOYNHS:

Your Honor, bargaining had just begun

in the core of the reserve system, and, like any labor union,

40
if they think they see an easy way to achieve a position of
predominance, a batter position, more cloud at the-bargaining
table, they seize the opportunity.
1 think there’s little doubt but what the owners'
position here would be something of a shambles, if this Court
• *

ware to rule that the reserve system is, per se, illegal.
As a matter of fact, 1 don’t know how bargaining could
proceed at all.

X don’t know what we would do at the bargaining

table, because, presumably, not only the present system but
every modification thereto, everything that we might work out
in this area with the union would be forbidden by the antitrust
laws,

tod even if only our present system, not speaking of

other systems, were to be declared illegal, still there would
be a third party at the bargaining table, and that would be the
courts.
tod the players union, I think, would be able to
use that extremely effectively.

We would be buying a new

reserve system every time we bargained, and the option would be
that we would be faced with more litigation, and not the
certainty that, or probability, that the arrangements would be
illegal without their acquiescence.
1 think this kind of intrustion into the collective
bargaining process is not something that the courts commonly
do, on something that’s quite inconsistent.
Q

Is this the issue here, whether the reserve

/

41
clause violates the antitrust laws?

I didn’t know that.

1 thought the issue here was whether you were exempt.

MR. HOYNES:

Well, Your Honor, 1 think the only

factual issue presented here, obviously the broader issue is
the Toolson exemption, which we believe reaches to the entire
structure of the game, not only the reserve system.

But Mr.

Flood and the union here are complaining only about the
reserve system, and it’s very difficult to separate the two.
the controversy
Q
But the merits of / were never reached, either
in the District Court or the Court of Appeals'?
MS. HOYNES; Well, the merits of the —
Q

They declined, both courts dellned to reach

the merits because they held that organised baseball was not
subject to either the fedes*al or the State antitrust laws, and
it's 'that issue that’s now before this Court, is it not? And
if we should decided that the Court of Appeals and the District
Court ware wrong in that view, then wouldn’t the normal practice
be; for this Court to remand the case to the District Court for
a trial of the case on the merits?
MR. HOYNES;

I. think it’s quite right, Your Honor,

but I think there are other levels of decision here, too.
labor matter that we’re discussing, and I’m now arguing,
was not —
Q
gather —

Well, that just bolsters your argument, I

The

42
MR. HOYNES:
Q

Yes.

— that this is net a matter for the antitrust

laws.
MR. HOYNES: That's right, Your Honor, it's a separate
and distinct reason for reaching the same results.
Q

Yes.

MR. EOYNES:
Q

I might also comment, as an aside, —

So you could lose ‘eats

that is here on

coverage, and still win on the reasonableness of the reserve
system under the antitrust laws'?
MR. BOYNES:

Yes, I presume we could also lose the

issue here on broad coverage and prevail on the issue that no
suit can appropriately be brought by a member of the collective
bargaining association, 'organisation, in a matter which is
essentially a matter for collective bargaining.
Q

Do you think there's something unique in a union

representing the great range of baseball players, all of them,
being the collective bargaining agent for all of the players
in a unit?
MR. HOYNES:
Q

No, Your Honor, I don't.

When you don't purport to reach the question of

s alary?
MR. HOYNES:

No, The union has made express in its

dealings with us that it doss not wish to bargain except to
set miniraums and other parameters.

It is suggested that we

43
would like to bargain, perhaps9 not only about sninumums of floor,
but perhaps minimuras that relate to the very seniority levels
as well.
But it does not wish to intrude in the individual
negotiations of a contract.
Q

But that5s what unions usually do.

MR. HQYNESs

That’s right, Your Honor, but the range

of —
Q

Then,, why is it — why doesn't it here?

MR. HOYNES:

It certainly could, Your Honor, that •

would he a mandatory subject if the union ware to raise, put
that issue on the bargaining table.

We would have no choice but

to deal with it.
Q

And the same with you, if you put it on the

bargaining table?
MR, KOY&KS;

Yes, if we were to put it on the

bargaining table as well.
I think both sidas, to date, have felt that it was
not in the interest of the individual players or of the process
to —“

Q

That's just because the players are too different,

one from another, for one union to represent them?
MR. HOYNES;
Your Honor?,yes,
solution.

I think that that is part of the answer,

1 think that's part of the answer to a

44
Q

Well, what's the rest of the answer?

MR. H0YNE3: Well, I think the rest of the answer is
that not only are the players different, but their relation­
ships with their clubs may be different as well.
Q

Well, that’s just saying the same thing.

MR. HOYNESs
aspect of the same.

It’s a feature of the same thing; an
There’s a wide range, obviously, of talent,

of desire, and it’s felt that that’s more appropriately
realised in individual bargaining.
Q

But while the union feels that if — and you

tipparently; that you and the union really shouldn't set
salaries, which is usually the subject of collective bargaining,
you should ba able to agree on a reserve system that applies
the same to everybody?
MR. HOYNES: Well, Your Honor, —
Q

Even though the players are different, one from

another, and their relationships to the club were different?
MR. HOYNES:

We don’t think it would be practical to

have a different reserve system reach individual players,
such as you can differentiate salaries.

That does not mean
t

that a reserve system must necessarily monolathically apply
to all players.

There could b© a small number of variations

in the reserve system;
other factor.

again depending upon seniority or some

Those kinds of suggestion® have been made,

and they certainly will continue to be on the table.

But an individual reserve system for each player,
having that negotiated out separately is a little difficult to
understand.

1 think that would not be workable.

That's not to say that individual players and clubs
cannot negotiate such things as long-term contracts and so on,
which go a long way toward modiflying the reserve system.
That can foe done and has been done.
hnd that any player is free to do with his club.
There9 s certainly a precedent for that.
Your Honor, I'd like to briefly refer you to the
Jewel Tea and Pennington decisions, which Mr. Justice Goldberg
referred to.
Q

That's —
Just let’s assume for the moment that both

players and management, as they do, say, pay is out as a
collective bargaining issue, that's going to be left to
individual bargaining? and then the owners, among themselves,
agree on a range, on soma maximums:

We will not pay anybody,

no matter who it is, more than $100,000 a year,
MR. HOYNESs But we simply would not do that, Your
Honor.
Q

Let's just assume you did.
[Laughter,]

Let's assume you did.

Because that’s one of the

suggested alternatives, of course, to a reserve system.
going to have to be some maximums.

There'

46
MR. HOYNES :

Not one that we’ve suggested, Your Honor.

That would be something that we would have to, I believe, say
the maximum, like, say, the minimum is something that would
have to !y» taken up vjifch the Players Association and bargained.
If the Association were to say, No, we don’t care to bargain
on that.
Q

Well, I take it, then, you wouldn’t do that be­

cause you think it would be improper?
MR. HOYNES;

I think it would be improper, Your Honor,

yes.
Q

Not such ss violating the antitrust laws?

MR. HOYNES:

No, improper in terms —

[Laughter.]
Not at all, Your Honor, improper in term3 of the labor

law's.
Q

All right.

Let’s piarsue that.

I just want to

get your position clear.
X£ the owners agreed on a maximum of $.100,000 a year,
against the background where both labor and management have
put it aside as a bargaining issue, that you say that would
not violate the antitrust laws?

Just a joint agreement

among the owners as to what they would pay their players?
MR. HOYNES:

Well, if this were put aside as a

bargaining issue, you can’t make something that’s not a
bargaining issue — that is a bargaining issue not a bargaining

47
issue; but you can agree not to bargain about it.
0
want to;

All right.

Let’s assume — put it the way you

you agreed not to bargain about it.
MR. HGYMESs

We'd agreed not to bargain about it,

and the union, thereby, would have acquiesced in our setting
such raaximums, then 1 believe we would be permitted to do so.
Q

Only because of the labor exemption?

MR. HOYNES: Because of the labor exemption, because
of the union acquiescent’©•

the union could challenge that,

put it on the bargaining table at any time and dispute it.
Q

Well, because of the labor' exemption?

Because

of the basic exemption that baseball comes under ' the antitrust
laws?

Right?
MR. HOYNES;

Of course, that goes without saying,

Your Honos:. That goes without saying.
I'd like to call the Court's attention, if X may,
briefly, to a matter not mentioned in our brief, simply because
it had not been published by that time, and that is the Yale
Law Journal article by Professor Winter and Mr. Jacobs, entitled,
Antitrust Principles in Collective Bargaining by Athletes, at
81 Yale Law Journal, No. 1.

Which agrees completely, I believe,

with the analysis which we have advanced in our brief. And
suggests that the antitrust issues are perhaps even irrelevant
here, that the labor policy and its supervening —
Q

You're just suggesting that this judgment below

48
be upheld on that ground, that.wasn't reached below?
MR. HOYNES:

Your Honor, I'm suggesting that, the

judgment — No. 1, that the judgment below be upheld on the
grounds
Q

Yes.

MR. HOYNES:

— reached below;

but, alternatively,

that there is additional powerful, we think quite correct,
grounds, which the bourts below felt it was not necessary to
roach, to wit, labor policy, which offers an alternative
reason for —
Q

Do you think the record is adequate for that

ground?
MR. EOYNES:
Q

And —

MR. HOYNES:
Q

Well, I think the record is —

— quite adequate.

— you would oppose a remand?

Assume we

r

disagreed with you on the exemption issue, the initial issue
on which it was decided below, would you think it would be —
would you prefer that it would be remanded, the labor exemption
issue, to be dealt with by the courts below first?
MR. HOYNES;

Your Honor, I think it would not be

inappropriate to remand that for such findings as you might
feel would be appropriate and not inconsistent with your
opinion.

I do believe the record has been fully developed on

that point, however.

49
I would mention only briefly that the role of Congress
is one that. 79m sure you are aware, and 1 will not labor the
point? Congress has accepted the invitation, this Court has
repeatedly given, has examined the baseball system repeatedly^
many bills have been introduced, many hearings held.

The

conclusions of those committee reports universally were to the
effect that baseball’s reserve system was something that was
of the substance of the game and needed to be preserved.
Whenever Congress has acted, it has extended an anti­
trust exemption.

It has never, in any way, limited one in

professional sports.
The matter is now under active consideration by
Congress, which has flexible legislative power, it’s not
limited to apply in only the garden-variety antitrust laws;
it can root out evils as it sees them with this flexible
legislative power and deal with them quite precisely.
And if any regulatory policy, governmental regulatory
policy of baseball should be adopted, then Congress, as this
Court has repeatedly observed, is the proper body for adopting
that.
I would like to mention, as well, the doctrine of
stare decisis, this Court has said the last word on stare
decisis in the TooIson and Radovich opinions. Again I need not
repeat what this Court has said, except to note that the baseball
community has continued to operate under those rules, grown and

so
invested more, and that those reliance interests, recognised
in the Fifties, have multiplied, are of even greater weight
now .
Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11;12 o’clock, a.m., the case was
submitted.]
