MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 69-5001, Moore against Illinois.
Mr. Doherty, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES J. DOHERTY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DOHERTYs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In the prosecution for murder, the State concealed
six items cf exonerating evidence and used a weapon that was
not connected with the petitioner Moore or the offense, to
denounce him as a bad man generally? and the jury, that had
been selected in violation of Witherspoon standards, found the
petitioner guilty and fixed his punishment at death.
This case begins at 10:00 p.m, on Wednesday, April
25th, 1902.

A bartender in Lansing, Illinois, ejected a profane

customer from his tavern.

At 10:55 p.m. that customer rushed

back in with a twelve-gauge shotgun and shot him in the heart
and killed him.
Two days later, at a nearby tavern, a man known only
by the nickname ’’Slick" bragged that he had shot the bartender
in Lansing.
Trial was held 25 months later.

Two State witnesses

identified petitioner Moore as the assailant.

Two of his

employers testified that he was at work SO miles north of

Lansing, Illinois» at the Wilmette Country Club, until after
midnight; „
Q

Where is Lansing, what part of the State?

MR. DOHERTY:
Q

Lansing is south, Your Honor.

South of Chicago?

MR. DOHERTY:

Chicago, Riverdala, Dalton, South

Holland, Lansing.

Q

About 50 miles south of Chicago?

MR. DOHERY:

Ch, no, no, no, Your Honor.

I'd say-

about 27, 30 miles.
Q

Yes,

MR. DOHERTYs

0.

And a little bit east.

East.

MR. DOHERTY;

As far southeast as you can get in

Cook County.
And Wilmette is way north.
Q

I know where that is.

MR. DOHERTY; And this was before we had that
Expressway opened up.

Dan Ryan

You couldn’t have got there, 50 miles,

except by going through small side streets, and with nothing
open, of course the outer drive was open.
Now, opposing those two people that said that he
was the assailant were these employers, and verified by the
work records.

He was paid overtime.

midnight that night.

He worked until after

s
The most damaging evidence against this man Moore
was the testimony of State witness Virgle Sanders»

Virgle

Sanders identified the petitioner Moore as the man that he knew,
a man that ha had seen several times before, but knew only by
the nickname "Slick".
He testified that on Friday afternoon, 1:30 p.m. ~~
that's less than 40 hours after this killing -- this man
"Slick" was in a tavern, the Ponderosa Tap, and said to him:
"Hey- Virgle, it's open season on bartenders.

I shot one in

Lansing last Wednesday night."
Now, five of the concealed items of exonerating
evidence involved Virgle Sanders.

They were uncovered in a

post-conviction hearing that took place on January 1967.
Friday night — I mean Friday afternoon, April 27th,
1:30 p.m., that's the bragging incident, real the voluntary
confession of this man "Slick" that he killed the bartender.
The next day, Saturday, the Lansing police are in that Ponderosa
Tap and they're talking to a man named William Leon Thompson.
"Did you hear about it?'5

Oh, yes, he'd heard about it.

"Can you identify Slick?"

"Yes, I can."

Monday, April 30th, 1962, Sanders is in the police
station at Lansing and he's giving a statement.

He tells the

police that he first met Slick about six months ago.

Now, that

would make it November 1, 1961, in Wanda and Del's cavern.
Of course the police wouldn't know the significance

6
of that until six months later? hut that statement is one of
the things that was withheld from the trial lawyers.
.'usmediately after getting his statement, the Lansing
police get their shotguns and automatic weapons and they go and
they raid Wanda and Del’s tavern, looking for the man called
’’Slick*'.

And he wasn’t there.
They talked to the owner, his name it Delbert Jones.

"Do you know him?"

"Yes,"

"Can you identify him?"

"Yes."

And that’s the second thing that these trial .lawyers
knew nothing about.
Q

That’s Jones, Delbert Jones?

MR. DOHERTYS That's right.
Q

The proprietor of Wanda and*Del’s.

MR. DOHERTYs
Yea.

The fact that he could identify him.

Wall, he hung around in his tavern.
Q

And they said, "Do you know Slick?"

MR. DOHERTY:
Q

Yes.

Absolutely.

They didn’t say, "Co you know Lyman Moore?"

MR. DOHERTY:
come into this yet.

Mo, sir.

The name Lyman Moore doesn’t

This is only a man known by the nickname

"Slick".
Q

Right.

MR.DOHERTYs

Thet's all.

Now, the Lansing police, after this raid, let's make

7
it May X.

They have an immediate suspect, James E. Watts?

James E. “Slick" Watts,

Nobody knows about that until right

near the end of the post-conviction hearing, when the State
brings it cut.

And that's January 1967,

Eo that's the third thing that waa withheld from these
trial man.

They didn't know that they had had an immediate

suspect named James E. "Slick" Watts.
Q

Well, where do you -— James E, Watts had the

nickname "Slick"?
MR, DOHERTY;
the Chief of Police,

That's right.

That comas right from

Thfe Chief of Police testified that he

assigned Lieutenant Turbin to look for James E. "Slick" Watts.
Now, where ha looked for him, I don't know.
But they have never found him, not even to this day,
as I stand before you now in 1971 — or '72, excuse me.
That's the third thing.
Now, on May 1st, 1962, the Lansing police -- let's
just recapitulate a little bit — they know three people who
all know each other and who all know a man named "Slick",

And

that's Virgle Sanders, William Leon Thompson, and Delbert Jones,
the owner cf Wanda and Del’s.

Six months later, petitioner Moore is arrested.

And

the Lansing police photograph him, take the photograph over
to William Leon Thompson's home.
the Slick I knew.

"That ain't Slick? that ain't

Doesn't resemble him."

He tells that to

that to anybody.
Oh# excuse me# they do.
prosecutors.

They tell it to the

They don't tell it to the defense lawyer.

And right after they took petitioner Moore into
custody# they get a report# a kickback sheet from the FBI# which
shows that petitioner Moore was in a Federal Penitentiary
from February 18# 1357# to March 4# 1952.

Mow# you put that

together with the statement that he originally gave# and what
do you find out?

That it's impossible for him to be the man

known as “Slick" that Sanders first met in Wanda and Del's
on or about November 1# 1961.
Q

Well# was he in prison at the time of the crime?

MR. DOHERTYi
Q

He got out March 4# 1962.

And when was the crime?

MR. DOHERTY:
Q

No.

April 25# 1962.

And the statement had to have been after that?

MR. DOHERTY:

The statement given by Virgle Sanders

was given cn April 30# 1962# at 8:50 p.ra.
C

Yes?

And he said?

MR. DOHERTY:

Sanders:

And silly, you know, it's repeated, give him a chance
to get off the hook.
Christmas?5

"Are you definite that it was before

"Oh, yes."1

It’s in this record.

So this fellow "Slick" must have been talking

about a different crime, at least?
MR. DOHERTY;
Q

No.

No?

MR. DOHERTY?

Ho.

The man that bragged, the man that

voluntarily confessed to this crime is James E. "Slick" Watts.
Q

Oh, I understand —

MR. DOHERTY2 The man that Chief Brasehler assigned
to look for him and the man that they said at trial was
petitioner Moore.
So, at the time of the arrest, they know from the
kickback sheet from the FBI that it's impossible for this man
to be the man that9 s in Wanda and Del *s on November 1, and
they also, in addition to that, know that William Leon Thompson
has already told them that he’s not the man.
1

As 1 understand it, Mr. Doherty, everything you've

told us so far, you’re telling us is information that was not
available to defense counsel at the time of trial --

10
MR. DOHERTY;
Q

That’s correct.

— and none of this that you’re talking about

got into evidence at the trial itself? is that right?
MR. DOHERTYs

That’s right.

Got it in the post-

conviction•
Q

Yes.

And your argument Is that this was

information * perhaps exculpatory or something of Moore —
MR, DOHERTY;
Q

Correct.

-— and that the prosecution should have made

available to the defense counsel? is that it?
MR. DOHERTY;
Q

That’s right.

Even though -- and you’re also tailing us

defense counsel had

210

knowledge of any of this at the time,

at the time of trial?
MR. DOHERTY:

It's impossible for him to have had

knowledge of four things.
Q

No.

What I want to know is, are you telling us

that defense counsel had no knowledge of any of these things
at the time of trial?
MR. DOHERTY;
Q

That’s right.

All right.

MR. DOHERTY:

This was not developed until January

196? in the hearing at post-conviction, long after the trial.
The trial was on, in the month of May 1964, Your Honor.

Q

Yes

11
MR» DOHERTY:
0

Nov; —

Did you tell us earlier that ~~ you say the

name was Sanders?
MR. DOHERTY: Virgle Sanders.
(}

It x>/as Sanders' testimony that identified Moore

as the "SlickB who committed the murder?
MR. DOHERTY?

That’s right.

That's right.

Exactly.

And that was the most damaging testimony of all.
Q

William Leon Thompson doesn't turn up anywhere

until the post-conviction hearing, is that it?
MR. DOHERTYs

That’s correct, Your Honor.

And neither does Delbert Jones.
At the post-conviction hearing, we show a picture of
James E. Watts to Delbert Jones and William Leon Thompson, and
they both say, "That’s Slick".
C>

And were they both in the tavern at the time of

the alleged crime?
MR. DOHERTY?
C>

No, Your Honor.

No, Your Honor, —

Then tie up their testimony.

MR. DOHERTY:

—* it’s a different tavern altogether

when this confession takes place by a man called '’Slick".
It’?? a different tavern altogether, in a nearby town.
Q

Clear up this , the tie-in between those two

things, if you will, for me.
MR. DOHERTY;

You mean —

12
Q

Between what Thompson said and —

M, DOHERTY;
*3lick”.

Oh.

They*re looking for a man named

They have an immediate suspect, James E. "Slick"

Watts? the Lansing police.

Is that right?

Now, then, six months later, when they arrest
petitioner Moore and take his photograph, they take it over to
the home of William Leon Thompson.

That's the man they talked

to Saturday morning, who said, "Yes, 1 know Slick? yes, 1
can identity Slick.“
On Saturday morning, April 23, 1962.
Now, November 2nd or 3rd, they go over to his home
with a picture of the petitioner Moore.

He says, “That's not Slick.

They say, "Here you

That’s not him."

Now, they didn't tell anybody that.
anybody,

They didn't tell

And then —
Q

How was it this information was in the hands of

the prosecutor as contrasted with the police?
NR, DOHERTY:

Well i>ow, I would say this.

There are

■ 9!

two things that the prosecution knew definitely about, and
one is that incident where William Leon Thompson said, “No,
that's not Slick? doesn't resemble him,"
Lieutenant Turbin testified at the post-conviction
hearing that he told that to the prosecutors.

that

to the prosecutors.

He related that

So they certainly have knowledge of

13
There is another thing that we're cosuing to now that
they had knowledge of, because it took place right in front of
their eyes,
Q

Before you get to this, though, Mr. Doherty, may

I be clear about this: Sanders testified at the trial that he
was present in the tavern where the brag was made that "I killed
somebody in Lansing"? is that right?
MR. DOHERTY:
Q

Yes,

And then, he then identified Moore as that

"somebody" who was in that tavern, bragged that he had killed
k'

someone, in Lansing? is that it?
MR. DOHERTY:

That's right.

That is exactly right.

He said, "I know this fallow; I've seen him a couple of times.
I only knew him by the nickname 'Slick'."

And he said, "Hey,

Virgle, it's open season on bartenders? I shot one in Lansinq
last Wednesday night.”

Wow, this is Friday afternoon.

This

is 33 hours and 35 minutes later.
Sure, his alibi and his work record alibi covered
that.

But who's going to believe it when the man says "I know

him”.

The jury is goinq to believe who?
They're going to believe this man Sanders.
Wow, on post-conviction, when 1 show photographs to

Delbert Jones and Leon Thompson, they say James F. Watts is
the man called "Slick”.

"That's Slick".

Or when I show

the situation, "Arc you sure it was before Christmas?"

"Yes."

14
Yes, he's sure it's before Christmas.
1 say to Sanders:

"Now, look, if you would have

known that this man Moore was in the Federal Penitentiary until
March 4, 1962, would you have identified him as the man that
you knew as 'Slick4?"
And his answer was;

"If he's in jai.~ it would be

impossible to be the same man."
Now, that doesn't take a great deal of genius for me
to do that.

If they would have had that information, the

trial lawyers, they would have done the same thing.

They

could have impeached Virgle Sanders.
And if Virgle Sanders is a material witness as far
as the prosecution is concerned, why is not that evidence that
was withheld —/'?
Q

Well, didn't —

MR. DOHERTY: '

Q

Didn’t Moore's attorney know where he was?

MR. DOHERTY;
C:

— used to destroy the material ~~

Who?

Oh, sure.

Yes, they did.

..Well, they didn't attempt to impeach Sanders?

MR. DOHERTY;

They didn’t get the statement.

That's

what they testified to under oath at the post-conviction
hearing.

Q

All right.

MR. DOHERTY:

q

They didn't get that statement 16.

Well, the statement is what had referred to the

15
first meeting on November 1st, 1961?
MR, DOHERTY:

Not in those words, but yes. “About

six months ago.6'
Q

In other words, when they first interviewed

Sanders, the police took a statement from him some time before
the trial?
MR. DOHERTY:
Q

Right.

How long before the trial?

MR. DOHERTY:

On April 30th, 1962, at 8:50 p.m., and

filed in May 1964, 25 months later.
Q

And you had no access to that statement until

1967, at the post-conviction hearing?
MR. DOHERTY.*

Q

Oh, you mean afterwards?

Yes.

MR. DOHERTY:

Why, certainly I found it.

discovery on these people.
Q

I got

I got everything in the file.

I know, but you didn't happen to --

MR. DOHERTY:

Oh, they didn’t have it; they testified

they didn't see it, the trial lawyers.
o

So the defense counsel did not know that Sanders

had told the police that he, Sanders, had met Slick six months
before?
MR. DOHERTY:

0

Precisely.

Yes.

MR. DOMERTYs

Preeisely.

16
Q

Mr. Doherty, did Moore’s defense lawyers at the

trial cross-examine Sanders on the length of time he had known
the defendant, and that sort of thing?
MR. DOHFRTY:

No, Your Honor, they did not.

And, you

know, that s dangerous.
Q

They might have developed this on their own, I

take it, had they sought to cross-examine.
MR. DOHERTY;

When a man testifies that he knows this

man, that's bad enough, without making it worse and driving it
deeper in by inquiring, S!How long did you know him?"
Q

Well, it's a calculated risk, but some would and

some wouldn’t.

Isn’t that true?

MR. DOHERTY;

Right.

Well, you see, with the

information that I have now, and I had at post-conviction,
then it's sensible cross-examination; but without that informa­
tion, that's the most dangerous thing that I could imagine to
ask, "How long have you known him?"
*

Q

Was there anything at the time of trial.

I'm putting you in the time of trial.

Nov?,

Was there at the time

of trial to bring to the notice of the prosecutor that this
six-month factor was significant?
None of you really knew that until the post-conviction
hearing, did you?
MR. DOHERTY;

Well, — the prosecutor testified at

pott-conviotica that he didn't remember whether statement \6,

17
from the Lansing Police Department * s file, was turned over —
or was in his file.

Now, he never said that he gave it to the

trial lawyers, defense lawyers; but he said;
“I don't recall.
way;

Mr. Doherty, I'll answer you this

if it was in my file, then they saw it, because I showed

them my entire file."
That's how he put it.
Q

Is that your question precisely?

Well, my question goes a little beyond that.

And that is — to put it another way:

Until you developed the

information about this man being in prison until — what time?
MR. DOHERTY;
Q

March 4, 1962.

—• March 4.

Until that evidence came out, the

six-month statement didn't have any particular significance,
did it?
MR. DOHERTY: Well, in my mind it should have, Your
Honor.

It should have had particular significance in November

1962, when they're going over and they're talking to William
Leon Thompson, because by then they had the kickback sheet from
the FBI, and the FBI shows it, and all you've got to do is
just look at it.
1, 1962.

Six months ago, from April, makes it November

And the FBI report shows he didn't get out until

March 4, 1962.
t:

Well, you're speaking now of the police officers

v.'ho had the interview, rather than the prosecutor, are you not?
I'm just trying to get the difference of — between

18

what was known to the prosecutor and what was known to the
police.

v
MR. DOHERTYs
Q

All right.

We don't know yet whether that's important.

MR. DOHERTY; Well, I say that the — that that's
imputable co the police, under the Warden vs. Barbee, that's a
law question.
Q

That's another question.

MR. DOHERTY:

But I won't talk about that.

Let's get to the last thing, and that will help a
lot.

Whan

you know, here they are now.

They know all these

things and yet they don't bring in Virgle Sanders to look at
this man; they don't bring in Delbert Jones.
their eyes for 18 months to the truth.

They just close

And Your Honors have

told us time and again, a trial is a search for the truth.
They closed their eyes to the truth.

When Virgle

Sanders first saw petitioner Moore, the day before he testified
at the trial, he takes a look at him and he says, "The guy that
I knew as Slick looked to be about 30 or <10 pounds heavier
than this guy."
How, that was in the presence of the Lansing police
officers and the prosecutors.

And the Lansing police officers

oaic:, "Well, you knew how those jailhouse beans are,"
‘That is Item 5, and that is actively encouraging
/ire ;.e Sanders to falsely identify the petitioner Moore as the

19
man called "Slick",,
And that was in the presence of the prosecutors.
the prosecutors know now of two things:

So

they know of that

because they were there? and they know about William Leon
Thompson saying, "No, that is not Slick."
At the post-conviction hearing
Q

You think the prosecutor ■— the prosecutor

knew about Sanders' prior statement when they turned the file,
their file., over to the defendant’s trial counsel?
MR. DOHERTY:
Q

1 can’t say that.

What?

MR. DOHERTY:
the defense lawyers?

What — when he turned it over?
That’s in dispute.

To

That's in dispute.

At the —
Q

Well, —

MR. DOHERTY:
that he didn’t.

— post-conviction hearing they said

Acad he — when he testified, he said, ”X don’t

remember if it was in there.”
Q

Well, I know, but did the prosecution turn its

file over or not, at the trial?
MR. DOHERTY:
Q

1 say no.

Well now, you say no, but let’s assume that

that’s not right, that they did turn their file over.
MR, DOHERTY:
Q

Okay, fine.

The fact is that the -- that Sanders’ statement

20
was not in the file.
MR, DOHERTY;

X don’t say that.

It might have been.

It might have been.
Assume — you want to assume that they turned it over
Q

Yes.

MR. DOHERTY;
to stipulate to that.

It might have been.

Perfectly willing

But one thing we know is this:

that’s

all that could have been in there, not the other four things,
oecause they weren't reported.
Q

Oh, I understand that.

I understand that, but

I'm just trying to inquire about this one item.
MR. DOHERTY; The statement?
Q

Yes.

MR. DOHERTY;
Q

I think it was in there.

The prosecution testified that they turned the

file over, didn't they?
MR. DOHERTY;
said, yes.

That’s what they said — that's what he

And the defense lawyers denied it.
Oh, he said he turned it. over to one of the defense

lawyers.
C

Then what did the Supreme Court of -- what did

the State court find on it?
MR, DOHERTY;
Q

They said that -

That the — they said that —

MR. DOHERTY;

— there was no request for suppressed

21
information during trial and the record reflecto that the
prosecutor showed his entire file to — and that's what you're
bound by now.. that finding.
Q

Well, that's — so they did turn their file

over?
MR. DOHERTY;
Q

I don’t say so.

Well, the court found it, that it was --

MR. DOHERTY;

That’s right.

They found it, and they

found that there was no request during trial for the suppressed
information.
Q

Well, there’s no independent evidence anywhere

that the prosecution knew of the statement by Sanders, is there?
How do you knew -MS. DOHERTY;

The prosecution knew cc the statement..

I would have to assume they knew of the statement.
Q

Because it was in their file or not?

MR. DOHERTY;

Well, no.

All you’ve got to do is take

a look at the way in which he questioned Sanders.
prosecutor questioned Sanders.

Actually he put him on and he

cross-examined him, is what he did.

The

And —

So if the file didn’t contain the statement, it

must have bean deliberately withheld?
MR. DOHERTY;
going to nay that.
Honor.

I’m not going to say that.

I'm not

I don’t have to be that extravagant, Your

22
Well, you have — if you’re going to rely on

j

this statement , you have to show —
MR. DOHERTYs

That’s only one of five.

Only one of

five.
Q

Well, 1 understand that, but you're relying on

that as part of the five.
MR. DOHERTY;
Q

That’s right.,

And you are going to have to establish that they

didn’t get it.
MR. DOHERTY:
didn’t.

They didn't.

They testified that they

And the most the prosecutor would testify to at post™

conviction was:

Well, he doesn’t remember if it was in there?

and if it was in there, then they got it.
Now, that’s the record before you now.
Q

Mr. Doherty, your time is running.

When are

you going to get to the gun?
MR. DOHERTY:
All right.

Yes, the gun.

I better get to the gun.

The gun.
Now, they introduced a sixteen-gauge gun.

Particulars, page 2 of the abstract:
this man?*

Bill of

"What hind of a gun killed

"Twelve-gauge."
.Answer by the prosecutor that tried this case:

a

twelve-gauge.
They had in their file at all times a report from the
Chicago Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory by Sergeant Bens,-

that the wadding dug out of the chest of the deceased is from a
twelve-ganga shell.
You know, I have two little pillboxes here., and I
tell you, you can pat a sixteen-gauge shell into a twelve-gauge
chamber, and it's a little dangerous, it's a little loose, you

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. IMMEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, IMMEL;

Honorable Chief Justice, members of the

Court;
I would like to say, as a prosecutor from the State
of Illinois, that if the evidence in this case remotely
resembled the characterisation which has been asset* •* bed to it
by my learned colleague, and my friend, that I wouldn't have
the courage to stand before this Court this morning.
Counsel has been involved in this case for a consider­
able length of time and, in my fair judgment, as an attorney
he has woven a legend.

And for that reason I’m going to take

the liberty of restating the facts as I truly think they are
reflected in the record.
I will return the Court to April 25, 1962, when a
gentleman, who I contend was Lyman Moore, and a companion, who
■ ?ss a dark--haired man, wearing a mustache, went into a tavern

in La-icing

and: where the petitioner, Lyman Moore, was subse-

25
quently ejected for profane language, who returned approximately
one hour later and at that time laid a shotgun across the bar
and terminated Mr. Bernie Zitek.
flow, nbt mentioned this morning at all is the fact
that two people; one, the cocktail waitress, Patricia Hill,
from a distance of six feet, observed this whole incident
twice.

She observed the ejection, she observed the subsequent

shooting an hour later.
was the gunman.

And she said at trial that Lyman Moore

That Lyman Moore was the man ejected an hour

earlier.
Another patron of the tavern, a man by the name of
Henley Powell, was present in the tavern at the time that the
shooting took place.

He is not able to tell us whether

Moore was the man ejected from the tavern, he may not even have
been there at the time.
But Henley Powell was playing pinochle with a few
other gentlemen around a table, and his testimony is — and
it’s pertinent in another point here — playing pinochle, he
suffers the fate of many pinochle players, he can’t bid.

So

he lays his hand down, and he’s sitting out the hand, and he
looks toward the doer, and what does he observe but Lyman
Moore, who he identifies at trial, corae through the door,
carrying a shotgun, walk up to the bar, and kill the bartender,
Mr. 2itek.
Henley Powell pursued Lyman Moore out of that tavern,

26
and was confronted with him in a well-lighted street, whereupon
Lyman Moore told Henley Powell, according to Mr. Powell:

"Gat

back or 1511 kill you too."
How, these two people were not discussed here this
morning. But this was the State's case in chief, this was the
eyewitness to the killing.
How, two days later, in another tavern, called the
Ponderosa Tap, in no way related to the tavern where the
killing takes place, Virgle Sanders is having a beer with a
gentleman who he, at that time, is identifying as "Slick", and
at trial says he knew as "Slick".

And this gentleman says to

him, "It's open season on bartenders? I shot one over in
Lansing."
How, totally unmentioned in any of the petitioner's
briefs, and not mentioned here this morning, in that there
were a couple of other people thee re when that conversation took
place.

One of whom was the bartender, "Skinhead";

"Skinhead"

Joyce.
Mow, Skinhead is standing behind the bar and Virgle
Sanders approaches him and says, "This gentleman would like
to have a ride over to Harvey, can we arrange that?"

And

Mr. Skinhead Moore — Joyce, rather, testified at the trial
that, "Yes’ he arranged for the ride, that Lyman Moore was the
man in the bar conversing with Virgle Sanders.
Mow, —> that he could get a ride for Mr. Moore, so

21
who do they contact?

They contact the owner of the Ponderosa „

who is also in the tavern at the time, and they say, "Can you
arrange for a lift for this fellow here, and his companion" —
who againr by the way, is the dark-haired roan wearing a mustache,
the same description we have of the companion of Moore at the
time he’s ejected from tha tavern.
Okay.

What happens then?

Mr. Fair accommodates these two gentlemen and drives
them all the way to Harvey, in the course of which they stopped
twice, at two different taverns, and enjoyed, themselves as
companions»
How, Mr. Fair testified at trial that Lyman Moore is
the man that he accommodated, that he is the man who was in the
Ponderosa, that he’s the man he drove to Harvey.

And that,

furthermore, in the course of the automobile ride — and by
this fcirae in his testimony he's referring to them as Moore and
Barbee, because they're on a first-name basis at this point,
or a second-name basis, in any event — at this point he says,
During the course of the automobile ride one of them — it’s
not clear

Irrora the record which — said, "If we hadn't had that

trouble with the bartender in Lansing, we wouldn't be in this
spot" or testimony to that effect.
“Well, if we hadn't had that trouble with the
bartender
he said.

In

Lansing, we'd have been all right,"

That’s what

28

Not.,7, Mr» Pair was called to testify at trial, and
he testified that Lyman Moore was the man that went with him
from the Ponderosa, at the request of Joyce, the bartender,
and he's the man that he drove to Harvey.
Now, that tells me that Virgle Sanders' statement
that Lyman Moore was in the Ponderosa with him has been
corroborated.

And that any mis-identification or confusion of

identities of Virgle Sanders is subsequently trapped with,
because it is murky recollections of a phantom named "Slick"
that has yet to be run to ground by anybody, and that the
:

police obviously abandoned once they had three — four eye­
witnesses to the killing, and three witnesses to the brag.
That tells me that Virgle Sanders' testimony is accurate, in
so far as it purports to reflect the conversation that he had
with Lyman Moore.

And it's inaccurate in so far as he purports

to tell us what Lyman Moore and a fellow by the name of "Slick"
are the same people.

They're not.

"Slick" was — if Lyman Moore is "Slick", it's
?

"Slick" is a fellow that this gentleman met in

It's months later that Lyman Moore

31
is arrested.
All right.

Now, I hope that I've made clear to the

Court what transpired in the Ponderosa, because that has never
ever been briefed by petitioner, and certainly wasn’t stated
here this morning.

Those two witnesses to that conversation

have simply escaped the attention of petitioner, and I — I
think it casts an unfortunate cast on the entire case.
How, in October of 1962, soma months later, while
this fruitless search for the ubiquitous “Slick'* has been going
on, and he hasn’t turned up, two Chicago policemen, another
police department, another jurisdiction, are on patrol and
they’re fired upon, or at least shots are fired from a 1957
Ford automobile.
They appjroached the automobile, and two men flee from
the car.

It’s staked out.

The car is searched, a sixteen-

gauge sawed-off shotgun is retrieved from the back seat of the
automobile.

And then — and documents in the car bearing the

signature of Jerry Barbee are found.
Okay.

The car is 3taked out, and in the wee hours of

the morning two men come back and attempt to get into the car,
and at that point they’re apprehended.
apprehended?

All right.

Lyman Moore and Jerry Barbee.

The two men

referred to by name in the testimony of Mr. Fair.
Jerry Barbee wears a mustache, he has dark hair.
He8s never tried for the murder of Bernie Eitek; he wasn’t there

32

Okay.

An interesting thing about this shotgun.

Very interesting thing about the shotgun recovered from that
car.
This arrest in October resulted in two trials for
two different charges.

Moore and Barbee went to trial together

on an armed robbery charge that took place in July.

In the

reported opinion to the Illinois Supreme Court, affirming the
conviction, 35 111.

cited in our brief, this Court denied

certiorari; subsequent litigation in the Federal courts again
wound up in another dismissal —- denial of certiorari by
Year Honors.

The witnesses said there had

In any event, there had been a

previous tie-up, and it had relevance in another context
besides this case.
Q

Well, this gun was used in evidence against the -

MR. IMM32L:
Q

Against Moore twice, for two —

MR. IMMEL:
Q

It was used against Mr, Moore twice.

Two different crimes.

Unrelated offenses.

33
MR. IMMEL;
Q

-Two unrelated offenses.

One of which the gun was used , and the other in

which it was not.
MR. XMMELs
Q

No, it was used in both cases.

No, I mean the gun was used in the commission

of the alleged commission of the holdup.
MR. IMMELs

Could very well have been used in this

crime, as 1 would like to develop.
Q

Ohf I didn't

MR. IMMEL:

I have an answer to Mr. Doherty's

comments about the Bill of Particulars and whatnot.
In any event, we then turn to the defense of this
case, which has been characterised by one dissenting justice
in the Illinois Suprema Court and by the petitioner as
unimpeached.

And that is that the alibi provided by two

witnesses, the first of whom is a gentleman named Alex Koxhaliari
he's a bartender at a suburban country club- and he testifies
that pay records indicate that petitioner was paid for working
as a cocktail waiter that night; and from that he construes that
he must have been there, although he can't testify — on cross,
it's determined that he can't really say that Lyman Moore was
there.

He didn't see him.
On cross-examination he's confronted with the fact

that he had previously made a statement to the police that he
■-jimply had not seen Lyman Moore that night; and I think his

34
testimony, taken for what it9s worth is worth little.
Butf in any event, Herbert Anderson, the manager of
the country club, is then called to testify and he fells us
that their pay records reflect that Lyman Moore was paid for
that evening, and that he didn't see Lyman Moore that evening
because —* but he’s sure he must have been there.
So on — the rest — the bookkeeping entry, which
was not admitted in evidence, the books and records were not
admitted.

That's the alibi.
Wow, the interesting thing about the alibi that ought

to be brought to the attention or the Court.

Inasmuch as it’s

characterised by the defense as unimpeached and invaluable,
and characterised in the dissenting opinion of the Illinois
Supreme Court, which I certainly have to take cognisance of,
as uniiiipeached.
The same alibi was introduced at the armed robbery
trial, which I've just referred to.

Three more eyewitnesses,

in other words, has mis-identified Moore there, for a grand
total of five in this case and three in that.

Establish, I

suppose, once and for all, that Lyman Moore is unidentifiable
in the State of Illinois.
But, in any event, the alibi is presented to the
Illinois Supreme Court, in that case, as an answer to the
conviction.

And the Illinois Supreme Court, in that decision,

was unable to reach the conclusion that the alibi was unimpeach-

35
able.

It was willing to leave it as having been a question for

the jury to decide.
I simply point that out because the same Justice who
dissented in this ease and wrote the majority opinion in that
case —- it5s the same Justice.
It's different handling of the same testimony in two
different, cases.
Q

I don't —* these offenses didn’t occur the same

night?
MR. IMMSL:
Q

No..

It was in the same ---

Then, what do you mean, the same alibi?

MR. IMMSL:

The same, exact alibi testimony was

offered, that Lyman Moore had been at work, and that the work
record reflect — oh, I’m sorry.

They were on different dates,

but the same testimony; that is, the work records reflect that
he was here and he was paid, therefore he must have been here.
Q

The same place in Wilmette?

MR. IMMSL:

Yes.

At the Westmoreland Country Club

up in Wilmette.
I would simply call the Court's attention to the very
last page of the Supreme Court’s opinion, in 35 111. 2d, for
l

that, because it's interesting to compare the characterisation
of unimpeached;in that case it didn’t work, but it's supposed
feo persuade here.

I don't believe it does.

Mow, what transpired at trial, with reference to

36
alleged suppression of evidence, is, I think, highly disputed
in this case.
First of all, let me say this;

On each and every

occasion that a State witness was asked on cross-examination
by the defense whether he had made a statement to the police,
he answered either affirmatively or negatively. and when he
answered in the affirmative the statement was tendered from the
prosecution’s file.
that.

There were three specific instances of

Witness Hill, Witness Powell, and Witness Fair were all

asked if they had made statements, and they all said yes; and
the statements were all tendered.
Virgie Sanders was the only one who was not asked
by defense counsel if ha made a prior statement.
How, please picture, if you will, what's going on
in the courtroom in Illinois in 1962.
have this statement in his file.

The prosecutor doesn’t

The testimony of Virgie

Sanders is put.on by the prosecutors, developed from two
conversations in the Library on the second floor of the
Criminal Court Building, where I used to work.
And that, on the basis of those interviews, and not
any written statement, they weren't in the prosecutor’s file,
Virgie Sanders went on as a State witness.
But, in any event, —
Q

Well, at the post-conviction hearing was it

established that Sanders' statement was not in the file?

3?
How can you say it wasn't?

Is there some testimony

that it wasn't?
MR. IMMSL:

The prosecutor's file was tendered to

the defense attorneys, who never discovered it in the file.
The prosecutor has no recollection of it being in the file,
according to his testimony.
0

Well, did the prosecutor know about the statement

before the — at the time of the trial?
MR. IMMSL:

It's — in my — 1 chink that the record

of his testimony at the post-conviction hearing must be read
to conclude that he simply didn’t know about the statement.
It's perfectly clear from the testimony at the trial and
perfectly clear, I think, from Mr. Fleming's testimony at the
posfc-conviotion hearing, that he put Virgle Sanders on the

stand as a State witness, based on his conversations with him
down in the Library, where we conduct, interviews with, oh,
potential witnesses in a State action in that county.
ilow, Lyman — now, if the same thing had happened
with Virgle Sanders that had happened with fill other witnesses,
that is, that at the time he was cross-examined by defense
counsel he had asked the same question of Sanders that he had
..eked of a/,1 other witnesses, Sanders would have said, "Yeah,
1 gave a statement to the Lansing police.'1
But he was never asked that question at trial, and
I want to make that perfectly clear.

38
Jit, the

first instance ha was asked that question

at the po£h-oonviction hearing., he said, "Yes.*statement was then tendered.

And the

Of course, it had turned up in

the meantime.
My point is simply this?

as a prosecutor in Illinois

a man sitting there, if the defense counsel had asked Virgle
Sanders, "Did you give a statement to the police?" and he said
•Yes."

One of two things would have happened in this case.

Either the prosecutor would have pulled the statement out of
the file, if he had it, or he would have turned, with a
horrible grimace on his face, to the policeman at the table
and said, "Where is this statement?

I have no statement.”

Neither one of those two things happened, because
the question was never asked.
Bo no one ever got put on notice.

But all this

business about the statement and the six months, all of it
could have been cleared up if a routine question, always asked
in Illinois, was simply asked.
Q

It just didn't get asked.

Well, is it routine in Illinois for the prosecutor

to ask his witness if he's made a statement to the police?
Before he puts him on the stand?
MR. IMMEL:

I frequently ask them that — that is

I frequently not ask that.

It’s quite clear that the question

didn't get asked.
Q

You don't think the prosecutor knew that this —

39

wall, how did the prosecutor get him as a witness?
MR. IMMELt
Q

Yes«

MRoIMMEL:
Q

The brag that took place

--

And where did the prosecutor find that out from?

MR. IMMEL;
outsomehow»

How did he get him as a witness?

1 presume the Lansing police found that

X don't know.

I mean, they're in the same

community, and it’s a small community.

I think something like

That

suppose, at every level of society, and there's one there.

And

X think when a comment like that would be made in a bar two
days afterward, it found its way back to the ears of some
police official who followed it up»
Q

My question was as to whether or not the

prosecutor didn't get the information from the police? that's
my question.
MR. IMMEL:

My answer to your question is that there’s

no way to tell from this record — X can't say no and 1 can't
say yes.

I do know that — I know Jim Fleming, and if he had

a statement in his file, he would have given it to them,

X didn't say statement.

MR. IMMEL:

If he had known about it, he would have

Q

Suppose it was verbal?

MS* IMMEL:

Well, if it was verbal, then of course we

don’t have a problem, because this one was a written statement,
and a verbal --■= yes, we presume the man had a conversation with
the police, because it was the police that got him to the
prosecutor.
The prosecutor, though, when he’s interviewing the
man to get ready for trial, isn’t at that point interested in
knowing about statements that he's made to the police.
he’s asking him is:

"What happened?

What

We’re going into the

courtroom in a few minutes.”
You see what l*m getting at, Your Honor?

If just

is not the kind of inquiry which is going to go on at that
stage
Q

I hear what you’re saying.

MR. IMMEL:

--of preparing a man for trial.

So I

don't think that there's any way we can say from this record
that the prosecutor had any kind of prior notice of his
statement.

I wish he had.
Q

We wouldn’t be here today.

Do you have a checks-type rule in oral argument,

Mr. Iramel?
MR. IMMEL:

Yes.

Two cases, Wolf and Moses have

.that.

a prosecutor, in preparing his case,

would find out whether the witnesses he's going to use had
made any statement?
MR. IMMELs

Well, yes, but you see, the thing is,

he might have said to Virgle Sanders:
statement?

"Have you made a

Have you talked to the '£301103?”

And — "Yes."

But at the point that this man -- the first time we
ever know of Virgle Sanders getting together with the prosecutor
is in the Library on the second floor the day before he
testified.
Q

No, hut what I — my question was reallys

I

should suppose it would be ordinary routine when he got together
in the Library with the witness he was going to us®, that he
might expect, since he's going to use him, there'd be some
inquiry whether he had made any statement.
And the prosecutor would like to say to him:
you make any statements?
MR. IMMELs

”Did

Did you sign any?"

As frequently as breakdowns in

communications can occur in a large urban area, it is,
nevertheless, surprising, and I even found myself in this
position many times, how you'll simply pick up what the police

42
give you*

They give you a list of statements of witnesses,

and how easily you slide into the presumption that this is it.
Now, that5s simply a fact of life, ir. a large urban
community, with the heavy trial log.
The situation where you try cases by the seat of your
pants is net uncommon, either? although that wouldn’t have
been the case where youfre seeking the electric chair.
But I’m simply stating to the Court at .this time that
the prosecutor, had he known about, a written statement,
certainly would have pursued the matter and certainly, at that
time, would have been on notice, because by that time he has
Lyman Moore's wrapsheet from the — from the FBI.
that Lyman Moore was in the penitentiary.

He knows

If he has in his

hands a written statement from Lyman Moore [sic] that says he
met the man six months ago, he's certainly going to clear that
up before he lets him go on the stand*
It's clear discrepancy.
Of course, the simple answer to it is that Lyman
Moore is not Slick, and it is not the man that Virgle Sanders
met in Wanda and Del's back in November, or whenever, it was,
in 1961.

It's a simple mistaken identity situation.
Apd to that extent, Virgle Sanders9 testimony is

potentially.impeachable, as to whether or not ha can accurately
recall who it was that, he talked to in the Ponderosa.
And it's material only, really, on the aggravation or

43
penalty phase of this case, if you will, because it was a brag
that's in issue here.

If the brag didn’t take place, Lyffian

Moore can’t be nearly as bad a man as you might presume.
And that is why this would naturally be a relevant
question, but two other people completely rehabilitate, in
the course of this trial, any potential impeachment of Virgle
Sanders* testimony, with reference to who he talked to.
He might have mixed him with with Slick, he might have thought
he met him before.
He may have been — and he might have been

he

obviously is, as far as I'm concerned, completely wrong about
that.

But that he was talking to Lyman Moore is established

beyond any doubt, not a reasonable doubt but any doubt.
And the testimony of ihe people who identified him,
they are Fair and Joyce, the people who spot him in the
Ponderosa and place him there, is not impeached in any way,
shape, or form.
He’s referred to, as I sav, by name in the testimony
of Mr. Fair.
iSow, Henley Powell.

I'd like to touch on this.

•ionley Powell, as you recall, is the gentleman who was playing
cai-ds and who witnesses the shooting.
When the police went out there that night, an officer
' \y t

naiaa of Koppits apparently drew a rough diagram of the

premises„

It's in the record.

He drew a card table, and he

44
placed Mr. Powell at the seat that Mr, Powell said he was
sitting in at the time, which would have placed him roughly
looking toward you , Mr. Justice Blackmun, the door being some­
where over toward my back.
Now, it is the testimony —* the contention of
petitioner that this diagram, which did not come to light until
the post-conviction petition was heard, has a devastating
effect on the veracity of Henley Powell as a witness, in that
it shows that he perjured himself when he said he could see
what was going on over by the door.
And this, to me, is an example of attempting to use
de minimis to simply defeat due process.
Henley Powell's testimony was that he had been
playing pinochle, seated in a position like this, threw his
hand down, because he couldn't bid, and was looking toward the
door when he saw Lyman Moore come in.

But he’s supposed to

have perjured himself, because he was facing ■— he was seated,
facing in that direction.
Wow, this is the kind of character of argument which
was presented to the highest court in the country.

in Illinois and most other jurisdictions that weapons found
in the possession or control of a defendant at the time of his
arrest are admissible to show the circumstances of the arrest.
For that reason alone, at that point.
Okay.
fled the car.

These two gentlemen were in. this car.
They triad to get back into the car.

They

At all

times that they were certainly in that car, they were both in
constructive possession of that shotgun, at the very least.
And if it was Jerry Barbee's car, if ha was driving it, Lyman
Moor® even had better access to the shotgun.
ft

Well, it was a sixfcean-gauge shotgun?

MR. XMMEL:

Yes.

Okay.

But, first of all, just as

to the circumstances of the arrest, cfiiite independent of the
gun’s relevance to the rest of the case.
ft

But the arrest was not in connection with this

murder.
MR. IMMEL:

The arrest was in connection with what was

going on right then, a shooting had taken place? and a gun
was found.
Q

But that's not this murder?

MR. IMMSLs

No.

For that matter, he wasn't arrested

for the other charge he was tried on, either, at that time.

He

46
was arrested, based on what had happened, he fired — a gun
was fired off in the city limits, and two men fled from the car»
But, in any event, as I've described before, of course,
the sawed-off shotgun had a relevance in another context in
another fcria1.
The general rule in Illinois, and most other
jurisdictions, has always been that it's proper to admit into
evidence any weapon which is suitable for the commission of
the crime charged f even though it may — itc s not the contention
of the prosecution that this is the weapon»
Now, there's no question that this weapon is similar
to the weapon that was used.

It3s a shotgun.

The prosecutor tendered a Bill of Particulars, an
answer to a Bill of Particulars, in which he said a twelvegauge shotgun.

That's not evidence.

And a cute incident happened at trial. The defense
attorney tried to call the Assistant State’s Attorney to prove
that it was a twelve-gauge shotgun.
In the record at page 763 through 76 S, the defendant
tried to call the State's Attorney to testify that it was a
twelve-gauge shotgun, .based, on the fact that the Assistant
State’s Attorney had filed this Bill of Particulars.

The

Assistant State's Attorney said that, "If I was called to
testify, 2 would testify that I don't know what kind of gun
was U3ed.n

That was the end of that effort.

47
Then a stipulation was entered into at the close -toward the end of the defense case, not the State’ s case in
chief, that, if a certain crime lab technician were called, he
would testify that in his opinion, that it was a twelve~gauge
shotgun.
There is no

he wasn’t there, and his Qualifications

aren’t in the record, and it’s simply a stipulation that in his
opinion»

So there’s no real hard evidence as to what the

actual gauge of the shotgun ever is,
Now, the State’s Attorney made a gratuitous remark
in his closing argument, to the effect that this probably
wasn’t the gun, and the rule everywhere in the legal —
Q

Mr. Xmmel, wasn't there medical testimony?

MR. XMMEL;

There was medical testimony that a shotgun

killed the man,
Q

Well, didn’t it say the sise?

MR. IMMEL:

Mo.

Specifically, Harold Wagner, the

pathologist, testified that he couldn’t
determine the size.

did not try to

All he had was pellets spread throughout

the body and the wadding.
the police department.

And he turned the wadding over to

That’s the last he saw of it, and he

was — made no effort.
Professor — Dr. Wagner’s testimony, if examined,
reveals that.
C:

Bo there * s nothing in the record to show what

48
size shot?
MR. IMMEL;

There * s no evidence , hard evidence,

introduced by anybody as to exactly what sise the shotgun was.
How
Q

You say “hard evidence”, is there —

MR. 1MMEL:
Q

As I say, —

— is there any "soft evidence”?
[Laughter.]

MR. IMMEL:

Yes.

Yes.

A stipulation that in the

opinion of a technician that, if called to testify, he would
testify that in his opinion it was a twelve-gauge shotgun.
That is the — what is what we have. And we have a Bill of
Particulars, which is not evidence, and which the prosecutor
attempted to slough off as not being his work, really.
And also the —» this gratuitous remark that he made
in his closing argument which, like the Bill of Particulars,
is not evidence that, in his opinion, this probably wasn't the
gun.
And of course it’s not really, as far as 1 can see,
an unfair characterisation to say that Lyman Moore is a man
uses shotguns.

Ha was arrested with one*

tod this was

the type of closing argument ws had? and that the shotgun was
a particularly vicious weapon to use.

That, after ail, it

was a shotgun that Lyman Moore killed the bartender with.
:e believe I *m not going to have an opportunity to

49

address myself to the Witherspoon points.

2 3imply rest on

the brief on that.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Justice Biackmun, would

you like to pursue your Witherspoon question on overtime?
0

Well, I8d like just on® — at least I'd like

one sentence as to your attitude on the Witherspoon issue»
MR. 2MMEL:
to the question

Well, my ™~ let me restrict that sentence

on the use of Witherspoon in the context of

peremptory challenges.
I’m not going to tell the Court about our position
tht Witherspoon helps the prosecution; we don’t want to see it
go away, necessarily, because it’s affected about as many
cases as it’s going to affect, and I think it’s a useful tool
in the prosecutor'0 arsenal.

It certainly hasn't done anything

about the relative death penalties returned.
Sowaver, there’s nothing in the opinion with
reference to whether or not Witherspoon forbids the use of
prosecution peremptory challenges to remove people who,could —
becasue they could not otherwise have been challenged for
cause.
There was an implication in the Anderson opinion
from the California Supreme Court that they, by inference -—
or at least have decided that the court, by inference, has
reached this conclusion, that this is an improper use of
peremptories.

50

My simple statement to the Court would be that it
is a most unusual way to overrule Swain vs. Alabama, that I
could possibly imagine, and could not possibly have been in
the mind of the Court in this case, had the eight jurors who
were arguably removed for cause, and I think some of them
properly “** I mean arguably removed improperly for cause, and
I think some of them properly were.

But, in any event, my

contention would simply be that under present standards and
under present techniques of Witherspoon questioning, most of
those people would have gone off, anyway, because when asked
the second questions
the verdict?"

"Well, does that mean you couldn’t sign

They would say yes.

Our experience teaches

us that, from all across the country, in"our conversations with
prosecutors.
Therefore we still have peremptory challenges to
eliminate the rest, if that's the desire of the prosecutor.
I don't think that the jury that tried this man would have been
composed any differently.

I think that the opinion of the late

Justice Black, in his dissenting opinion, has proved to ba
rather prophetic, in the sense that the composition of the
juries isn’t going to be any different.
Unless, Mr. Justice Blackmun, unless you have further
questions on Witherspoon, X think 1911 stand on the brief
for the rest of it.
Thank you, Your Honors.

Mr. Doherty.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES J. DOHERTY, ESQ.,
OK BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DOHERTY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Your Honorss
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You have one minute left,

but we'll enlarge that to two, in light of the extent of the
time.
MR. DOHERTY;

All right.

I didn't call Robert Fair, because all he said was
that he looked like one of the men.

When Bill Joyce was

called back, and that's on the post™conviction, by stipulation
he testified, "He sure looks different; looks like a minister's
son."

That's what he said.
Nov;, Virgle Sanders knew him, so why bring in the

people that didn't know him?
When one fellow told the police that "he sure looks
different".

That's not in the record, because you can't get

all these in the record.
And the gun.

It's terribly denigrating to the

Chicago Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory, a scientist
said it comas from a twelve-gauge.

All you've got to do is

buy the shooter's bible, or Sports Afield, or anything to
find out the differences? a great deal, 3/32 of an inch between
a twelve-gauge wadding and a sixteen-gauge wadding.

52
It's not a legal argument.

It's an argument based

on the immutable laws of the universe, the exact science of
measurements.
Mr. Anderson stated at trial that in his opinion if
Lyman Moore was missing for any length of time, he ’would have
noticed bin being missing.

He says that these people, if they

were asked to make the statements •— asked to make the
statements?
There was a written motion for all statements given
to the Lansing police.

There was a promise by the prosecutors

on page 8 — excuse me, page 32 of the record:

"We will

give them to him, when the witness has finished testifying on
direct examination, Your Honor."

And they did, with twos

Pat Hill, gave voluntarily; and Henley Powell, gave the
statement voluntarily.
But did not fulfill their promise on Virgle Sanders.
t

Q

Can you suggest a reason v/hy, having asked all

the other witnesses, if that is the case, about their
statements, that Sanders, whom you characterize as the most
damaging witness, was not cross-examined about having given a
statement?
MR. DOHERTY %

That’s after they qot done, up to

Sanders, that's after they got done testifying.

And so when

they asked about the statements, they had the statements in
thair hand and they were cross-examining from them»

And that

S3
as after, not before.

And the record makes that clear.

I stand to answer questions.
Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERz

Thank you, Mr.Doherty.

Thank you, Mr. Imme1.
The case is 'Submitted.
"Whereupon, at 11:45 o’clock, a.i., the case was
submitted.]
