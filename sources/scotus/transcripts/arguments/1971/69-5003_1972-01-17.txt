MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Amsterdam, yott may proceed whenever you*re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM, ESQ » #
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. AMSTERDAMs

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

One thing I perhaps should make clear is our position
on the question asked by Mr. Justice Stewart as to whether,
if there wore shown to be any legitimate legislative basis ''for
a punishment, that would itself end the Eighth Amendment claim.
The answer, in ray judgment, is unmistakably no.
The argument about whether there is a legitimate
base for legislative judgment has a very, very small part in
our brief, as I am sure the Court has noticed.

We have

essentially simply pointed out that one of the reasons why a
court need not hesitate to strike down a rare and harsh
punishment like capital punishment is that it's not taking
away anything that3s very important to the States, both in the
sense that the only thing that is really in issue here is
whether, instead of killing 20 or 15 people randomly selected
a year, they’re going to keep them in prison? and the impact
of that from all available determiners is inconsequential.
But we don’t urge chat a legislature could not «—
.

.v:.:i9v. urge in this form at this time that the legislature

4
could not find that there is a basis for boiling in oil»

That,

1 think, really presents the question very squarely.
Mr. George said, and I think the States generally
take the position, that if boiling in oil came before this
Court, even though it had a legitimate legislative base, even
though the legislature might find that boiling in oil was a
deterrent, that somehow the Court could say that that was a
cruel and unusual punishment because it was, quote, "unnecessar­
ily cruel", close quote.
1 want to simply point out to the Court who is arguing
subjective standards here and who is arguing objective
standards.
How could this Court say, or how could Mr. George say
that boiling in oil is unnecessary, if a legislature finds that
in order to deter some particularly serious crime that the
whole broad concept of being boiled in oil is the way that we
do it?
I thin?,: that it is the respondents and not the
petitioners who are urging the Court to react at that visceral

level.

'

Om: proposition, I think, is aimuch more objective
c«3.

1t looks not•to what society says'but to what it does.

■ :.-i we don’t reject the fact that 41 States have it on their
statute, but there must ba a phenomenon with which one must
start.

Wall, one must also ask:

What do they do with it?

Now, let’s look at this thing, if we may, for a
moment, in the world picture*
and Liechtenstein•

We're not talking about Mozambique

Wo are talking about a progressive trend

which has brought virtually every nation in the Western
Hemisphere, with the possible exception of Paraguay and Chile,
to abolish the death penalty*
We are talking about a progressive trend which has
caused all of the English-speaking nations of the world, except
some of the American States and four States in Australia, to
abolish the death penalty*
We are talking about -Q

How did they do it?

By what process did they

do it in most of these places, Mr. Amsterdam?
MR. AMSTERDAMs

It is different in different places*

In many places the legislatures have abolished it.

And in

many places exactly the same thing has happened as has
happened in the United States.

That it has simply ceased being

applied in fact.
And we think that, the fact that —
Q

It isn’t a process which is generally one done

by courts in these countries, is it?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Wo, no.

No.

Unquestionably not*

And in most countries, of course, Your Honor, courts don’t have
the kind of constitutional supervision.
h

But —

Now, if the Court undertakes to accept your

6
general proposition on the cruel and unusual aspect, couldn’t
a court make exceptions to it for certain crines, or would a
court be obliged to follow an al1-or-nothing approach?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

If — Mr. Chief Justice, if Your

Honor means, could the Court find that the death penalty is
unconstitutional for some crimes and not for others, I believe
that it could rationally, although I do not, think it should or
can on the indicators available to the Court in
Q

this country»

But could the Court, for example, make an excep­

tion as to homicides committed by life-term prisoners, either
of a fellow prisoner or of a guard?
MR. AMSTERDAM:
Q

On that —

I'm talking about that kind of a narrow

exception, as a legislature could»
MR. AMSTERDAM?

Yes.

Well, that, it seems to me,

is a different question, whether the legislature could.
don't think the Court could under a general statute*

I

I don't

think that the Court could take a statute like in California,
which says:

any first-degree murder incurs a death penalty.

Or a statute like Georgia's, which says:

any murder, the

death penalty may be imposed.
•

*

And so why do they apply it in some cases and not
in others?
But I do think that ia different question would be
presented if a different and narrower statute were presented.

7
There5s no doubt about that.
Q

You9re well aware, of course, that a great many

opponents of capital punishment, among them James Bennett?
the former Director of the U. S. Prison Bureau? was very strong.!*,
against capital punishment as a matter of policy, but preferring
to retain it for homicides of a fellow prisoner or of a orison
guard.

I'm sure you've covered that in some of the briefs.
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Well, I have no doubt that a statute

of that sort would present a different question to the Court.
Because what we have is a general statute which prescribes
death as a penalty for murder or in subsequent cases, right.
How, we've had historical experience with that.

We

know *—
Q
a statute?

But isn't it true that in New York there is such,
That's restricted to killing a prison guard.

MR. AMSTERDAM;

Oh, yes.

As a matter of fact? there

are several different statutes, Mr. Justice Marshall, in
different States.

California has a mandatory death penalty

statute for killing by life-termers.

It's not only a guard

but it's any non™inmate.
There are five States, though? that have statutes
such as the Chief Justice suggests, which limits the death

penalty to killings of guards in the course of their duty, and
that sort of thing.

Now, —“

Q

Do you think we then could accept your general

argument and still find such a statute, one that did not
offend the Constitution?
MRc AMSTERDAM?
drawn.

Your Honor, X think a line might be

X don't urge that it be drawn.

X see no occasion in

these cases, because no such statute is presented.
The problem with those statutes is that we've had
insufficient experience with them.

The essence of our sub-»

mission here X think is perfectly plain, that we have had a
very considerable experience with general statutes punishing
the crime of murder or the crime of rape with death.
And what we find when those statutes are applied,
actually applied by juries in particular cases, is that almost
never is the penalty of death in fact inflicted.
I think that is not an exaggeration.

Now, one

doesn't know what juries would do with a different kind of a
/

statute.

But one very well knows what the testimony of

public opinion, of an enlightened public opinion in this
country is with regard to general statutes punishing murder
with death.
The — what juries do, we're in a little disaqreemen
with, I think, the respondents on the significance of that.
Tc ■■•'cart with, as we've pointed out, juries really only do
return about 100 'death verdicts a year.
New, to understand how small that is, you have to

9

compare it with the number of crimes punishable by death•
'a very difficult thing to do.
of the appendices to our brief.

It's

Wa attempted to. do it in one
And what you find out is that

juries don*t apply the death penalty in perhaps more than one
out of 12 or 13, at the very most, cases in which they could.
And only a half or a third of those people are actually
executed»
Now, notice the non-acceptance, indeed the repudiations
which this implies.

We have a country in which 43 jurisdictions

have the death penalty on the books, in which hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people are prosecuted for
crimes and convicted of crimes, in which that penalty is
available,
Under the best of circumstances for capital punish­
ment, where what is involved in an execution is a secret,
clandestine one, which the jury doesn't perceive or clearly
understand, where the people who get the death penalty are
disproportionately the priors, the poor, and racial minorities
— a point I want to cone back to in one second

*— and where,

in addition, the juries are death-oualifled, they have
qualified, the juries are returning a hundred death verdicts
a year.
Q

Mr. Amsterdam, you said that one out of perhaps

12 : r 13 death verdicts are returned as to what might be
returned«.

In each of the 12 or 13 were those cases in which

10
the prosecution had asked for death? or was it just that death
could have been returned under the statute if the prosecution
had asked for it?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

It is impossible to know in what

percentage of cases the prosecution asked for it.

It is,

however, perfectly clear in a number of jurisdictions that, the
prosecution has no control over the matter.

In a number of

jurisdictions it is entirely up to the jury, the prosecutor
cannot waive it —• the prosecutor cannot ask for it.
It's simply a matter of the jury's discretion.
1 think no figures are available an the question of
whether the prosecutor asked for it. Although I will say that
even the prosecutor's decision not to ask for it is a reflection
of the sentiment of the total community.

So that 1 wouldn't

discount those cases, even if I knew how many there were.
But the point —Q

Also, your statistics -- you can't tell, even

from those fragmentary statistics, whether, as you put it,
juries era imposing the -death sentence in only one out of
every 12 defendants? or does it mean that only one out of every
12 juries is imposing the death sentence?
You don't know which is the •—* you don't know which
is the constant and which is the variant factor?
MR. AMSTERDAM:
n

Or both?

No.

11
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Bat that's

that *& certainly

true, Your Honor.

Q

And, Professor Amsterdam, is —* are your most

recent remarks also directed to judge-imposed penalties?
MR. AMSTERDAM;
discriminate.

The figures that are available do not

So that the one out of 12 or 13 figure is a

total figure that doesn't discriminate between judge sentencing
or jury sentencing or where prosecutors, however, have not
asked.
All we know is that cut of that number of capital
cases, that's the number of death sentences that are in fact
imposed by the sentencer.
One important factor is that the figures we have,
the figures I'm talking about, 100 a year, run through 1368,
when Witherspoon was decided.

So what we are talking about is

the number of sentences imposed principally by juries, because,
although there are some judge-sentences in. there, most, of these
are plainly jury-sentences.

By juries from whom all persons

against capital punishment have been excluded.
Sow, this is the group that Mr. George wants us to
take as tlie indicators of public sentiment.

They have already

That's the maximum.

12
Q

Professor Amsterdam, in that connection, how man

States have- penalties of this kind imposable by a jury as
contrasted with those imposable by a judge?
MR. AMSTERDAM:
Q

Do you know?

Ah — in how many jurisdictions?

In how many jurisdictions does the judge impose

sentence as contrasted with how many where the jury imposes
sentences. Do you Jc-rjsw?
ME. AMSTERDAM:

To my knowledge there are two

jurisdictions, Maryland and Illinois, where the imposition of
the death penalty requires the concurrence of the judge with
the jury.

That is, the jury’s verdict is either advisory,

where the judge must concur in the jury’s verdict before it
can be imposed.
In all other jurisdictions it ip the jury which makes
the sentencing decision, unless the jury is waived.
Q

Well now, this is not true in my home State.

MR. AMSTERDAM:

Oh.

I'm then quite misinformed.

I had understood that it was.
This was rather thoroughly canvassed in the briefs
in -Maxwell vs. Bishop» and I think the statutory sections are
set out there, if the Court should want to refer to them for
reference.
I had understood that it was true in all States,

that the jury made the determination except those two.
there may be local differences that X*m not aware of.

But

13
Q

Except where the jury is waived, in which eventf

as you said, a judge may be able to impose a death penalty
in some States*?
MR. AMSTERDAM:
Q

I'm sorry, Mr. Justice White?

Except in those States where -— or except where

a jury is waived, in which event, I suppose in some States at
least, the judge could impose the death penalty?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Oh, it is ~~ since United States v.

Jackson, it is common that if the jury is waived the judge
may impose the death penalty, ye3.

That’s certainly true.

The jury is still the primary sentencing instrument in practice,
because generally the jury is not in fact waived.

Q

Is there anything in the Georgia record that

indicates what kind of people Georgia
MR. AMSTERDAM:

executes?

There are again judicially noticeable

figures on this, there is nothing in the record, there is no
evidence that was presented. But the figures are perfectly
plain from the National Prisoner Statistics:

Georgia executes

black people, in Georgia, I'd say.

1 ought to make some reference as to the state of
the record generally, because there's an awful lot of talk
here about facts, about what the Los Angeles Police Department
says, about deterrents, about who gets the death penalty;
unpublished figures from the Georgia Bureau of Prisons;
mipv.bilshcd figures from the California Department of Correction

I make very plain that we have been asking for an
evidentiary hearing on all of these facts in a lot of courts
for a long time.

No one has ever given one to us.

The California Supreme Court judgment in Aiken;;; rests
upon a record in which the California Supreme Court decided
that case on authority of a case in which we had asked for
such a hearing and it hadn't been given to us.
fie are very far from satisfied with the nature of the
factual evidence presented here,

But we think from the

factual evidence that is judicially noticeable, which does not
include Corrections Departments5 reports in an unpublished
form, that enough appears so that the Court can call the death
penalty cruel and unusual punishment,
Now* if, however, the Court has any concern with any
of these factual questions, ranging from deterrents to who
gets the death penalty, any of these things, an evidentiary
hearing would be the proper way to resolve that matter. And
in th© Mkens case, at least, the case can be disposed of in
such a way as to get that hearing.
From the —* I return to this subject of rarity and
discrimination.

Because the significance of both rarity and

the question of who gets the death penalty is twofold.
First of all, when a nation this size, with a going

critas scare, burgeoning population, sentencing as few people to
death as are in fact sentenced to death, and executes even fewer

15
of them, and does this against the background, where the
ideological debate, where the content ofthe debate about
capital punishment, makes unmistakably clear why this is
happening historically, because capital punishment is regarded
as indecent, as inconsistent with civilised standards today.
Then that manifests a repudiation quite different
from what is manifested by the maintenance of statutes on the
books.

And that8a the second aspect of it.
The vary fact that capital punishment comes to be as

rare and as infrequently and as discriminatoriiy imposed as it
is takes the pressure off the legislature, quite simply, to do
anything about it.
The one reason why the Eighth Amendment must be
measured not only by the legislative disapproval but by popular
disapproval in terras of what juries and judges and prosecutors
do in fact, is that there are in fact more than one way to
skin a cat.

And that a penalty can be repudiated by public

opinion every bit as tthorough by legislatures making ifc
optional and then nobody ever applying if as by the legislature’s
repeal of it,
And this goes back to the Chief Justice’s question:
how has it been done internationally?

In some places it’s

fooen done by legislative repeal; in other places what has
happened is exactly what, happened in -this country, it simply
falls into disuse.

And when It falls into disuse, when there are only a
very, very few people, and those predominantly poor, black,
personally ugly and socially unacceptable f there simply is no
pressure on the legislature to take it off.
Q

Mr. Amsterdam, I should have asked you in the

last case, but how many are there
MR. AMSTERDAM:

or

Death Row in California?

How many in Death Row?

10S on

Death Row in California, to'my knowledge at the moment.

Q

At the time, the last time the legislature

refused to abolish the death penalty, how many were on Death
Row?
MR. AMSTERDAM:
Q

Oh, about, I would say 85 to 90.

Well, how can you say that because there are so

few, if you take the State of California?

1970 was a strange year in California.

Because the last

published rational figures show that out of 59 people on Death

Mr. Amsterdam, you were speaking of pressures

Your Honor, is 697.
Q

Well, 700 people on Death Row would foe quite an

enormous pressure on public opinion, would it not?
MS. AMSTERDAM:

No, 1 don’t think so.

I think, as a

matter of fact, pit lie opinion has been lulled in a very
significant way by the failure of executions in recent years<>
X think the public has, in large measure, stopped thinking
about the problem.
Q

I think that if it is —

Well, I was addressing myself, at least

suggesting the possibility that if you didn’t prevail here

they don’t think about it.

I think that it would cost, and I think it would be
a constitutionally intolerable cost, the resumption of
executions, to activate any kind of public sentiment.

But even

if you have that public sentiment activated, the point
essentially

remains that it is not, you are not capable of

generating the kind of legislative or public disapprobation of
a penalty which is cast in form so as to be applied, and which
is in fact applied to very, very few; and to essentially
ugly, minority group members, as you are to a generally
applicable penalty.

MR. AMSTERDAM:

If I may read for a moment from

Loci EXlenfoorough , speaking in the House of Lords in 1813*. on
a bill for abolishing the death penalty for the crime of
privately stealing the amount of five shillings from a shop.
Lord Sllenfoorough, after saying,3lHow but by the enactments of
this capital punishment are the cottages of the industrial
poor to be protected?

What other security has a poor peasant#

when he and his wife corns home, that his clothing will be safe
other than the death penalty?" goes on to say;
"Your Lordships are told what is extremely true,
that the number of people actually put to death for stealing
five shillings from a shop is very small.

And this circumstatio

is urged as the reason for the repeal of the law.

But before

Your Lordships are induced to consent to such repeal, I beg
to call to your consideration the number of innocent persons
who might have been plundered of their property or destroyed

by midnight murderers if the law now sought to foe repealed
had not bees in existence? a law upon which all the retail

trade of this commercial country depends? and which I, for one,
will not consent to be put in jeopardy."
Nevertheless, the bill making it a capital offensa

I think that all of the available evidence which is
judicially noticeable makes it perfectly plain that a judicial
ruling by this Court, applying the Eighth Amendment in the
way in which we believe it is meant to be applied, and in

ment would take from the States nothing to which they are
entitled*

MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well, Mr. Amsterdam.
C

Before you sit down, Mr. Amsterdam, I just

want to be sure that 1 understand your ultima te argument.
Is it this:

that even assuming that retribution is

a permissible ingredient of punishment, even assuming that
rational people could conclude that tha death sentence is the
maximum deterrent with the minimum unnecessary cruelty, death
in the electric chair, oven assuming we're dealing with somebody

who is not capable of being rehabilitated and an incorrigible
person ? even assuming that rational people can conclude that
this punishment under these circumstances is the most efficient
and the most inexpensive and the most — and it assures the
complete isolation of the convicted man from ever getting
:

into society,' even assuming all of those things which are

22

the basic arguments made by your brothers and sister on the
other side , you say it is still violative of the Eighth
Am X right in my understanding of that?

Amendment *

MR. AMSTERDAMs

That is correct, Your Honor»

The

Eighths Amendment we see as a limitation somewhat like the

Fourth; it is a limitation on means.

It says that the legis­

lature.' may not use cruel penalties, crueal and unusual
penalties, even though they may serve a legitimate goal.
Just as they may not engage in unlawful searches and seizures,
even though there may he a purpose for them.
Now, we're — I don't find that we're limited to
that on this record, because of this irreparable fact that we
can't get an evidentiary hearing on all of the issues Your
Honor raises.

I think, on evidence v/hich could be presented,

we could show that none of the judgments Your Honor supposes
could rationally be made.
,Q

Well, maybe so.

ME. AMSTERDAM:

3ut -~

But on this record, it is our submis

sion that, accepting each and every one of those propositions,
the death penalty is a cruel and unusual punishment.
G

That's what I understood to be your argument,

MR. CHIEF .JUSTICE BURGEE:

Mrs. Beasley

23

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HRS. DOROTHY T. BEASLEY,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MRS. BKu&L-EYs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The question in these eases, and particularly in the
case now before the Court, that is Furman vs. Georgia, involves
th® Fourteenth Amendment first.
1 think that petitioner has, in all of these argu­
ments in all of these cases, given way -to the proposition that
the Fourteenth Amendment has anything to do with these cases,
and the argument is made simply that it is cruel and unusual
punishment to deprive a man of his life.

Due process of law

is not really looked at at all.
However, as it affects the State, that's exactly
the most important point.
The Fourteenth Amendment provides that life, liberty
— that no St it# may deprive any person of life, liberty, or
property without due process of law.
-Sow, that was written in 1863, long after the Eighth
and the Fifth Amendments were written.

So that when the

restriction was made on the States by way of the Fourteenth
hmoncbtienf, the death penalty was already recognized and the
res

“.on on the States was only that they not deprive a man

of his life or liberty or property without due process of law.
• ni. X would submit that if the Court .in these

24
rules that the death penalty is cruel and unusual

instances

puni shsaenfc and may not be imposed by the States, then it would
take a constitutional amendment

because the Fourteenth

Amendment, as well as the Fifth

would be rewritten *

So that

you would have the proposition that no State may deprive any
person of life, nor may any State deprive any person of
liberty or property without due process of law.
Q

Could the State boil them in oil?

MRS. BEASLEY:

I think not, Your Honor.

Because the

terms cf "due process of law" and the "taking of life or
property'1 does not include corporal punishment of that type.
The State may not deprive him of life, liberty, or property
without due process of law.

But what we had at the beginning

of our country was the understanding that if may not impose
torture, and that of course would be torturous, as would horsewhipping, as Mr. Justice Stewart mentioned.
Those things were taken out of the realm of punish­
ment: at the hery beginning, with the Constitution being enacted,
and the Bill of Rights.
0

fthafc is the standard that you use to determine

whether any part of the Bill of Rights is applicable to the
States si?
MRS. BEASLEY;

I think whether it is, the standards

that have been used by this Court in so many cases in applying
the due process clause;

Xs it a matter of fundamental fairness?

Xs it a concept of our ordered liberty?
That * s where cruel
ceases'- in, I think,

that ’ s where punishment t period ,

and whether it is cruel and unusual

punishment comes into the concept of ordered liberty, of
fundesaantal fairness. And I think that so long as the State
utilises fundamental fairness in dealing with its penal system
in imposing penalties, that those penalties may -be used.
Particularly since the States were specifically permitted by
the Fourteenth Amendment to utilize the taking of life, so long
as it was done with due process of law.
And I think that's one of the basic fallacies in
most of the arguments that are made by petitioners, because
he talks about rarity and discrimination.

Well, obviously,

tlien it is not with due process of law, if it's arbitrary.
And that is the limitation on the States, not par.- se as to the
penalty„
Q

Mrs. Beasley, didn't the Francis case take into

cognizance that the State could not impose unnecessary
pain?

The Francis case,
MRS. BEASLEY*
Q

of this Court.
Yes, sir, I’m familiar with that case.

So they recognized a little more than just cue

process, didn81 they?
MRS. BEASLEY; But that was —
Didn't this Court, in that case, recognise that
Eighth Amendment was a part

was applicable to the States?

MRS. BEASLEY;
Q

Yes, insofar as ~~

And you' re now saying it * s not?

MRS. BEASLEYs

Q

No, sir; 15in not saying that at all,

Oho

MRS. BEASLEY: What I’m saying is that it comes into
the restrictions or the States by way of the due process
clause? not that in and of itself, and apart from any consider
lion of due process, is it applicable to the States.

That's

very clear, because without the Fourteenth Amendment, the
i

Eighth Amendment wouldn't• be applicable to the States at all.
Because that's not how it was written.
So that in the concept of due process is whore the
considerations of how we deal with punishments come in.

And

1 would submit that a State may impose a punishment so long as
it is riot outside of what we regard in — as our concept of
ordered liberty, the fundamental fairness.
And I think that's exactly where the standards come
in.

The. standards are not so close to line that you can

measure them by

polls taken today or by the number of people

executed within the last ten years.

That's too close to the

line as far as cur concepts of ordered liberty are concerned.
Moreover, 1 think that the standards that are to be
used are the ones that the courts have used throughout the
country in recognising what cruel and unusual punishment means
And the cases •that corne out, of the -State courts and out of the

2?
lower Federal courts and of this Court indicate that it means
barbarous or uncivilised or torturous, and that type of thing.
And certainly the penalty of death# per se, does not come
within that prohibition or that understanding.
Mr. Justice Marshall, you asked about whether the
meaning of "unusual" has changed.
not.

I would submit that it has

The meaning of "unusual" has not changed from the time

that the Eighth Amendment was written, but the application of
it, perhaps, has.
An& 1 think, as I said before, that the death
penalty itself is outside of a consideration of that nature
because it's specifically reserved to the States in the
Fourteenth Amendment.
However, if we are going to measure whether in our
contemporary society the death penalty is to be regarded as
cruel and unusual punishment, I think petitioners are using
the wrong guidelines.

I think there are three basic ones that

are compelling with respect, to what is the current standard of
decency with regard to punishment.
Now, he talks about the world community, hut we
don't know why these countries did away with the death
penalty, we don't know, for example, whether it was the legis­
lature or the judiciary; but, even more, we don't know whether
it. was because they regarded it as cruel and unusual punish-'
meat, or for some other, varied reasons.

28

cor v,t,;.v;. ;:hc crimes were, nor what, tbs punishment for
the crimes has been displaced with*

For example, if it *s

displaced with life imprisonment, is the death penalty so much
more severe that, in and of itself. it's grossly disproportion-

ate?

It9s a matter of degree»
Let me go back to •— I mentioned that there ware

three areas I thought should control insofar as measuring
standards of decency»
Q

Juries —

Where does this standard of decency come from?

MRS. BEASLEY:

I. think it comes primarily from Trop

vs. Dulles, that being the last pronouncement in this area.
Q

There was no opinion by the Court in that case?

MRS. BEASLEY;

No, there was not.

That is correct.

But I think a standard, of course, would have to come
into play.

1 don't think it'a that far removed from fundamental

fairness, which, to me, is the basic standard that is to be
used in these cases.

Q

Would you say a State statute that allowed the

death sentence to be imposed except on those people who make
more than $50,000 a year, would that be —
MRS. BEASLEY:

I think that would be discriminatory.

That's not looking at the crime; that's looking at the circum­
stances of the criminal.
Q

Do you think that ‘'cruel and unusual" carries

with it a connotation of non-discrimination?

29
MRS< BEASLEYs

Oh, yes, indeed»

It should be

applied in a Ron-discriminatory manner.
Q

Are there any statistics as to what kind of

people Georgia executes?
MRS. BEASLEY:

Mr, Justice Douglas, we submitted in

our brief a chart that I — obviously it's made up front the.
statistics which vre were able to gather from the Department of
Corrections, showing those people now under death oenalty ~~
Q

Yes, I've read that.

MRS. BEASLEY:

— in Georgia.

And I don't think that you could say that there’s
any one class, or that that class had been discriminated
against.
Moreover, even if there was shown to be discrimina­

tion, and Vie submit that there is not shown to be discrimina­
tion, that that wpuld not invalidate the death penalty per so,
but it would be a violation of the egual protection clause,

not the Eighth Amendment.
In other words, you may have discrimination in the
sentencing in larceny that only black people get the maximum
for larceny. Well, obviously, that would be discriminatory.
But that wouldnlt mean that you couldn't sentence anybody to
twenty years' imprisonment for larceny; it would simply mean
that in those cases where there was discrimination, those
sentences' were invalid.

30
Q

That’s a case-by-case discrimination•

MRS. BEASLEY;

Yes, indeed.

And I think their proof

falls far short of making out the kind of a prima facie case
that this Court has considered in cases like Whitns with
regard to discrimination by virtue of race.
But even if — I say, ev’en if they could make it
out,- it would not invalidate the death penalty because the same
thing would apply to any other punishment; but it doesn’t
make the death penalty any more cruel and unusual than life
imprisonment or twenty years in jail, or even one day in jail,
if it“s arrived at in a discriminatory manner.
Of course that then goes back to the due process >
clause, that obviously it has to be arrived at in proceedings
which accord due process.
Q

Has your court ever considered the question of

the discriminatory aspect of the death sentence as applied in
Georgia?
MRS. BEASLEY;

I think not, because I don*t think that

it's had the opportunity to do so.

Mr. Amsterdam suggested it

has not had the opportunity, he has not had the opportunity to
present statistics to our courts. But that certainly is not
t.-cue in these two cases.

There was no effort made to bring

any statistics, or make any argument, as a matter of fact.
in Furman, the argument wasn*fc even made in the lower
-jonrtf it

ply was stated but no argument was made.

And there

31
was a very, very short argument, as wa pointed out in our brief?
in the brief to the Supreme Court of Georgia, citing merely
the bald statistics of how many white people and how many
black people had been executed since 1930» up to 1968.
Well, that doesn’t prove that the death penalty is
cruel and unusual punishment.
Moreover, those statistics which talk about, the period
of time between 1930 and 1968 in Georgia’s case are the old
statistics that any State failed to take account of the vast
changes in criminal justice that has taken place under
decisions of this Court, as well as the decisions of State
courts.
So that we are safeguarding not only criminals
generally, but people who are subject to the death penalty, with
greater due process. So that when we do arrive at a consideration
that they are ready to be executed, we are sure that they are
that it was arrived at in a manner comporting with due
process.
And I think'that's one of the great fallacies in
utilizing the statistics with regard to the number of
executions that there have been.
Hew many of them have not been executed because of
jury discrimination, or scrupled jurors or illegal confessions
or illegal search and seizure or something else that, has
nothing to do with the penalty that was imposed by the jury.

32

But.# again# let me just return for a moment to what
2 regard as the measurements of what the standards should he»
vflo standards of fundamental fairness and the standards of
an ordered society.
for one»

As I said# I think it should be the juries,

The juries across the country are still imposing the

death penalty, and certainly they are representative of the
community.
As was said in Williams vs. JSew York, by Mr. JusticeMurphy# in his dissents

In our criminal courts the jury sits

as the representative of the community.

Its voice is that of

the society against which the crime was committed.

Its verdict

is a community expression,
Witherspoon also refers to the jury speaking for the
community# and so does Trop.y3. Da11es.

And I think that it

cannot be overlooked that the juries are still imposing the.
death penalty and did in the 660 or however many cases
resulted in persons now under the death penalty in this
country,
They express the community feeling and standards#
and that was .recognized in Trop.

They speak for the community.

If we are going to look at what the standards are
here:

in the two cases which Georgia has pending before the
\

Court# as a matter of fact in Furman, which is the case right
now before the Court# there was only one person out of the
total panel of 48 —- which meant one out of 49 because one had

to be' added

- who said that, they were so against the death

penalty that they could never impose it in any case, and that
it would affect their determination of guilt*

One out of 49*

So that can*t show that there is an overwhelming —
these, people are selected at random.

And, moreover, their feet

are put to the fire.
There was some question in one of the earlier
arguments about. Well, juries are perhaps just imposing the
penalty now because they know it's not going to be imposed.
I would submit that if it’s supposed to be the
overwhelming repudiation of the death penalty that petitioners
talk about, then why would jurors take the unpopular stand
in imposing a penalty which the world has repudiated?
And, secondly, how can we presume that a juror,
sitting in the place of judgment, is going to take a chance on
a penalty not being imposed, when he knows that he’s expressing
the will of the community?
I would submit that no one with a conscience would do
so, and we certainly can't indulge in a presumption of that
sort.
Secondly, we speak also of the second measurement
then, of what or of who measures the standards?

And 1 would

say the judiciary.
And it is particularly appropriate to look there

because fch< judiciary is measuring the death penalty in terms

34
of whether it is cruel and unusual punishment, not whether it
is wise or not whether it is efficient ox* root whether we can
do without it? but is it cruel, and unusual punishment.
And reading all of the recent cases from around the
country, I find almost none —* I found none, there probably
are some — but none where the courts have declared that it is
cruel and unusual punishment.

And I'm talking of the State

high courts and the lower Federal courts, so that we have the
judiciary taking this very question of whether it is cruel and
unusual punishment and giving it consideration, and saying,
in our opinion, and applying the constitution, we consider that
it is not.
So certainly they, too, express the standard of
decency.

We talk in other situations of the conscience of

the court, that is, for example, the test that's used in
effective assistance of counsel, at least in the Fifth
Circuit.

Does it shock the conscience of the court?

That's

what we're talking about with regard to standards, not something
ao close to the line that it can be measured as 51 percent
today and 49 percent tomorrow.

And that certainly is not the

way in which our Constitution is to be utilized or to be
construed.
Again, it's a question, 1 think, for the legislature

to•determine.

Certainly, in Witherspoon, the Court noted that

dr: rower of a State to execute a defendant sentenced to death

35

by a jury does not bear — has no bearing in what the Court
does with respect to whether the State can so execute a person,
so long as it is done with due process.
And also X would like to point out that there is,
in many of the eases before this Court, Allied Stores of
•y.

a

Ohio vs. Barry1s, the license tax cases which ware in 1866, and
cases since then, a presumption of regularity and a presumption
of constitutionality of legislative enactments.

And that

has been overlooked, X think, in the petitioner's argument
and position.

He has the burden to show that the legislative

enactment is unconstitutional» and X think that he has not done
bos

not with respect to the death penalty per se, in the

abstract, which is what he contends should be declared
unconstitutional.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, Mrs. Beasley.

Mr* Amsterdam, you have three minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. AMSTERDAM: Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice.
May it please the Courts
On one point I essentially don’t disagree with Mrs.
Beasley.

X think juries are, in many ways, the conscience

of the" community? although I think that other organs of
government, prosecutors and judges, are as well.

36
•

/

/

Our whole case rests on what juries and prosecutors
and the other agencies of government have done, and what they
have done is to refuse to impose the death penalty.
The question then arises. Well,, why don’t we leave
them that way?
step in?

If they're refusing to, why should this Court

Why shouldn’t it just die of its own weight?
The answer to that is a case like Furman vs, Georgia,-

where what you have is a regular, garden variety burglarymurder.

Unintended killing? somebody shot through the door»

The case was submitted on the theory that it was an unintended
killing.

There are thousands of these.

with death.

And the jury comes back

The defendant is black? the victim is white,

That’s all the aggravation in the case.
The Stats which distinguishes between torture and the
mere extinguishment of human life can't se® that this case is
different from the aggravated cases. But the jury is allowed
in every case to return the death penalty.
There are Georgia figures in this record.

I don't

think they’re judicially noticeable but they’re in this records
33 people on Death Row? 27 of them black, 6 white.
The reason why juries can't be permitted to go on
doing v;hat they have done and slowly, inexorably do away with
the death penalty themselves is that in individual and
particular cases there are going to be regressions, depending
largely on

fc-r.3-

color of the defendant’s skin and the ugliness

37
of his person»

And it is that kind of collectiveness which we

think that the death penalty forbids*
Hew, 1 read the lower court cases somewhat differently
than Mrs* Beasley does*

x would say that the rule developed

in the Eighth Amendment area throughout this century has been
very plainly the development in the prison cases, which this
Court just recognised in Haines v. Kern»
What has happened there is that the Eighth Amendment
has been taken and given a. whole new meaning to respond to a
new problem and new conditions.
Well, what we have in the capital punishment area is
exactly the same thing.

And our point 1 repeat again, with

regard to race, is not, or poverty is not discrimination? we
haven’t proved it.

On these records we couldnSf prove it.

What I are saying is that exactly what is happening
in capital punishment, though rare, arbitrary, usually
discriminatory, but unprovably discriminatory infliction of a
punishment, escapes all other constitutional controls: due
process, equal protection.

Andescapes the public pressure

that keeps legislatures acting decently unless there is
something in the Constitution that forbids it.
Q

Mr. Amsterdam, you have mentioned a couple of

times, and I think Mrs. Beasley also mentioned, a comparison
between the type of statistics that you have used in your
brief and the type of statist! ess the States have used. And

38
you state in your brief and you’ve stated here that yours are
judicially noticeable, choreas yea feel the States' are not.
I couldn’t find in your brief, though perhaps I’m
insufficlently familiar with it,, anything other than just the
statement to that effect. Do you. cover in your brief what you
say is judicially noticeable?
MR. AMSTERDAM?

Ho, w® don't.

of it cun be fairly simply stated.

But I think the basis

The Court —> the concept

of judicial notice is essentially that when a writing is put
cut there in the public domain, which people may rebut, which
people may study and answer, that it becomes judicially
noticeable because its availability for a professional criticism
makes it reliable.
Mow, when the State takes figures out of the State
Department of Correctiona record, which have never been
printed anywhor®, which is new, Lb unascertainable, whose
significance is not subject to criticism; that's not judicially
noticeable.

But when you have

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
