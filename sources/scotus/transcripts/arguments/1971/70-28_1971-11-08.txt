MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

first tills morning in No- 28, United States against Edna
Ganeras and Allen Generes,
Mr. Sinn, you may proceed tfhenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. 2INN, ESQ.,

OSS BEHALF OF THE EBTJTZONER
MR. ZXNNs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court %

This federal income tax csss is hors on writ of
certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
It raises a question with which this Court is familiar'? whether
a shareholder, in a closely held corporation is entitled to
business or non-business bad debt dedxietic-n if h© is unable
to collect a debt owed him by his corporation.
The difference between a business and non-business
bad deofc deduction is critical, sine© -the former is deductible
against ordinary income and may be carried back as part of a
net operating loss.

Whereas the latter is deductible only ae

a short-term capital loss and may not be carried back to offset
the ordinary income of prior years.
This Court9s decision in Whipple v. Commiasioney, in
15*63, settled the question whether merely investing in a
corporation is a trad® or business.

The Court held it. it not

ana consequently a mar© investor in a corporation, who is

4

nailable to recover his advances to the corporation, in entitled
only to nonbusinass bad debt treatment.

On the other hand, since the rendering of services to
a corporation for remuneration constitutes -a trade or business ,
an employee who advances funds to his corporation it order to
protect his job and salary and who is unable to collect the
debt owed him by his corporation is entitled to a business bar
debt deduction.
The problem in this case arises whore a taxpayer bears
the dual relationship of shareholder and employee to the
corporation.

If he were merely a shareholder , then, es X ha vs

said, he 'would be entitled only tc nonbusinesr, bad debt treat­
ment.

but if he were only an employee who -advanced funds to

protect his job and salary, he would h& entitled to business
bad debt treatment.
In the dual status situation which arises hers,
however, where the taxpayer is motivated both by a desire to
protect his job and salary and by a desire to protect his
investment, the Internal Revenue Code makes no provision for
allocating loss in part to business and in part to nonbusinasa„
The loss must be characterised in its entirety as business or
nonbusiness in nature, even though the shareholder employee
was motiv^f&d by both, business and nonbusineea considerations,
to make a loan or guarantee his corporation' s debts»
Section 166(d) of the Cede is the relevant statute.

s
and it is set. out on page 36 of our brief.

It provides that

the term "nonbusinees debt17 means a debt other than a debt
created or acquired in connection with the trade or business of
the taxpayer, or a debt the loss from the worthlessness of which
is incurred in the taxpayer's trad® or business.
The pertinent regulations ara sot out on pagos 36 and
3? of our brief, and,insofar as they are relevant here, they
provide, as explicated in Whipple, that s debt will be considered
a business bad debt if the loss resulting from the debts
becoming worthless is proximstely related to maintaining the
taxpayer's trade or business.
The position of the United States in this case is
that in a dual status situation the test is satisfied only if
the dominant motivation for the taxpayer? o undertaking wa ■ to
protect his business interest as an employee, rather than' his
nonbusiness interest as & stockholder.
The position o<2 the respondent that a taxpayer is
entitled to business bad debt treatment ©van if his dominant
motivation was to protect his investment, so long as h@ was
significantly motivated by his business interest as an employe®.
With this background, 1st me turn to the feet© of the
case.

Mr. Generes, the respondent, and his son-in-law, William

Kelly, each owned 44 percent of the seek of the Kelly-Gensrea
Construction Company, a corporation engage! in heavy construc­
tion work, principally for governmental authorities.

6
Ths* remainder of 'fch© stock vvm owned by a son end
another son-in-law of Mr* Generes*
The corporation had been formed in 1954 as successor
to a partnership in which Mr* Generes and Mr* Kelly had be©h
equal partners.

Mr. Kelly was 'the vice president of fch©

corporation,, was in the charge of its day-to-day opsrsticss ,
and received a salary of $15,000 a year fcr his services.
Mr. Generes was president, was principally responsible for
obtaining bank financing and securing performance and bid bonds
on construction jobs undertaken by the corporation, and was paid
a salary of $12,000 a year.
Mr . Generes * principal employment was as president of
a savings and loan association,, for which ha worked full time
and received an annual salary of $19,000 a year.
At a pretrial deposition, Mr. Generes testified that
h® devoted about on®'hour a week to the affairs of fch® Kelly-Generes Construction Corporation.

At trial he testified that

he spent six to «sight hours a weak on the corporation's affairs.
Mr. Generes* original investment .in .fch® corporation
was $38,900.

In addition, he advanced funds to the corporation

from time to time, when it was short of working capital, and
also guaranteed the corporation's bank lo&na to enable the
corporation to purchase, machinery and equipment.
In 1962, when -the corporation was in serious financial
difficulty, ha advanced it $158,000.

7
The corporation was required to furnish performance
ana payment bonds in connection with its construction business,
which was largely performed for governmental authorities.
Most of these bonds ware written by the Maryland Casualty.
Company *

From 1954 to 1958 Casualty, es & matter of courso,

required Mr. Generes to indemnify it with respect to -sach bond
issued to the corporation.

Bonds were issued ©a

individual

job basis.
Late in 1958,. to obviate the: .need for individual
bonds on each construction job, Mr. Generes and Mr. Kelly,
acting for themselves individually and also ,foi the corporation
signed a blanket indemnity agreement with Maryland Casualty.
Under this agreement. Casualty agreed to act as surety for
the corporation for up to a million and a half dollars on any
one job, and $2 million over-all.
Mr. Generes and Mr. Kelly in turn agreed fco indemnify
Casualty for any loss it might suffer as surety.
In 1962, ths corporation defaulted on two contracts.
Maryland Casualty mads good on ths defaults, and Mr. Generes
was called upon

fco respond under his indemnity agreement®

indemnified Casualty for $162,000, which he was

hi® to

recover from fcfe© corporation because of its bankruptcy.

He

was also unable to collect the $158,000 that, he had advanced
to the corporation in 1962 in direct loans.
In his income tax return for 1962, Mr. Generes

He

3
treated the loss on the direct loans as a nonbusineass bad
debt, a:uci the Commissioner allowed that loss, and it is not hare
in dispute.

However, he treated his indemnification loss ©f

$162,000 as a business bad debt.

The proper treatment of that

$162,000, as business or nonbusiness, is the sols issue before
this Court.
The case was triad before a jury in Kaw Orleans.

Ths

trial lasted one clay.
Mr. Generes testified, and X refer now to page 5? of
the record, that the only reason he signed the indemnity
agreement with Maryland Casualty was to protect his part-time
job with the corporation.
In response to the question whether he had given any
thought at all to hi© investment in the corporation, in
guaranteeing

and his investment, I might point out,

consisted both of his stock interest end his direct loan© to
the corporation — ha testified, and X quota?

flNo, X never

once gave it a thought.”
And 2 quote again from page 69 of the record,

“To

tell you the truth about it, I nover gave that, a thought? X
never gave my investment a thought."
Q

record?

MR. SINN s

I think we alight have been in th© Court of

Appeals on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to
support the verdict? but we wouldn't he here.
My point was, Mr. Chief Justice, that it's difficult
for ma to believe that the jury would have found for the
taxpayer, under the dominant standard.
q

But then you'd have a very different one© her®.

MR. SINN:

y

with th® instruction, aren't you?
MR. SINNs That's correct, sir.

Only with th©

instruction.
After getting the significant motivation instruction,
to which th© Chief Justice has referred, th® jury went out

11
shortly after five o'clock, at the close of this one-day trial,
and it stayed out nearly two hours.

It returned shortly after

7sO0 p.m., seeking clarification of the signifi
instruction.

ifcivati

And I refer the Court to page 129 of the record,

at which th© jury put the following question to th© trial .hedge.,,
and 1 quote:
“Is the question given fco us intended for os to
decice whether he signed the indemnity agreement solely for
•the protection of his salary, investment, or could it he both?"
The jury, it seems clear to us, was somewhat confused
as to how fco apply the so-galled significant motivation
instruction.
After coming back this first time, at shortly after
a©van o'clock, th® jury went out for another 40 minutes, and
it returned again for clarification of the instruction; and I
refer the Court now to page 130 of the record, and again, at
this point, the jury asked, and I quote:
"Would you pleas© re-read your answer to our question
and possibly interpret.*it further?"
And the trial judge undertook fco do that.
The jury went back to deliberate for the third time,
and reached a. verdict favorable to Hr. Generes♦

The government's

motions for judgment n>o-.v. and alternatively for e'n®w trial
were denied.

And on the government's appeal, th© Fifth

Circuit, by a divided vote, held that th© jury had been properly

12
instructed.
Was the ©sly direct evidence on the issue of

what his motivation had been what you've referred us to on
pages 67 and 60 of his own. testimony?
MR. 2IHN«

Yes.

There is other testimony* Mr. Jostles

Stewart, that he had some hope of getting dividends, bast he
was trying to build up an estate for bis children, and so fori».
But that, I think, is the critical ©videnpa that he did not
give his investment a thought.
And that he testified that his solo purpose —

MR. SlKNs
Q

That's correct.

—* in signing this indemnity agreement was to

protect his job and his salary from the job?
MR. aiMN* Right.

Of course, if the only purpose is

that purpose, we wouldn’t be here. The whole, basis of this ease
is that there is a duality of purpose.

And a single-purpose

case we think is fairly clear under this Court's decision in
Whipple, where the single purpose is investment purpose, and
under the Trent ease, which w@ do not disagree with, where the
man is solely an employes, Second Circuit decision, and in

On that basis, why would he do it to protect

MR, SIMMs

© $200,000 investment, and also he

had other motivations, we think.

After all, it was his son-in-

law who was running this business, and I think another scn-inlaw was working in the business, the stock was owned by him
individually, by two of his sons-in-law and by a son.

And so wa

think ha had significant personal motivations here —
Q

Yes? u'ight.

MR. SIMMs

— as well as nonbusineso motivations.

Our position that bus

s bad del

foe allowed in & dual status situation, only where tha dominant
motivation for the aidsrtakiiv:;
rests on four considerations.
The first :>f these arises simply from the fact that
we are faced with a situation here where we must characterise a

bad debt in its entirety as business or nonhuaihess in nature,
even though the taxpayer vm motivated by two considerations to

16
guarantee his corporation’s debts.
Now, the. Internal Rowans Cod© might have. provided
in such circuiasfesucsu that half of the c!.tibh should tt trautet
as a business bad debt and naif should be br©~,t>sd

s a nonn'Kcmt :::■'■

bad debt? but that's not what it does provide.‘ ’ A chcice has to
be made.

Either it’s all business or it's all nonbu^in&so»

And we submit that» purely from the standpoint of logic and
in the absence of any overriding policy consideration» it is
far more logical to have the character of the debt dOfcercinsid by
reference to the weight of your consideration rather than by
reference to a lesser consideration.
Secondly, v?e have referred in our briaf fco several
analogous situations, in which the tar consequences are
determined by reference to the weight of your consideration,
in situations where an all-or-nothing choica must be made, just
as here,

ted the first involves the business bad debt provision

itself.
Prior to 1942, as Mr, Justice White pointed out. in
his opinion in Whipple, there was no such thing as business and
nonbusiness bad debts, they war© simply bad debts; and whether
they were business, nonbusiness, or otherwise, if they went
unrapaid, they were deductible against ordinary income,
h substantial 'loophole developed in the .Internal
Revenue Cs-de, where loans would be made to family members and
go unrepaid and taxpayers would claim an ordinary deduction

against — for these loans.
So on© ©f 'th© primary purposes of Congress * enactment
of the business/honbusih*^'dichotomy in 1942 teas to closa up
this loophole.
of

Now, you could hav® a situation whore, instead

as w© hav© here for th© most party we're talking about

a nonbusiness investment consideration ©gainst a business
consideration ~~ where yen have primarily a nonbuaimss psroanK.X
consideration against a business consideration.
Mow, under the, tests that respor%
significant test, a business bad debt would b© allowed svea
if th© weight of your consideration were the personal considera*»
♦

tion.

And we submit this would be aquaraly contrary to th®

congressional intent in 1942.
Similarly, as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out in the
Futnara case, on© of the purposes of th© 1942 legislation was
to put nonbusiness investments in the form of leans, on the
l
i

footing with nonbusiness investments in th® form of stocks.
And the courts hav© haId that where corporate stock is purchased,
both for business reasons and investment reasons, th®
dominant motivation is controlling in characterising that loss.
Again, to put th® two on an equal footing, only th®
dominant standard can be applied.
Finally, w© refer to the fact that in the legislative
history of Section 166 there ar® references to applying 'th®
same test as is applied aaear Section 165, in determining whether

18
m

expense is incurred or a loss- is incurred in a trad© or

business# or in a transaction entered into for profit*

And md®j;

Section 165 it is clear that tho dominant standard controls.
And thirdly# a point that I referred to in answering
Mr. Justice Stewart# wa think th® dominant standard is far
easier to apply by a jury than the significant, .standard# and
wa think it's necessary only to th© point# to what happened
in this particular case# and th® difficulty that the jury
encountered.
And lastly# we rely on the opinion in the whirls
case.

The gist of th© opinion# it soems to

m,

is that a

presumption exists against the allowance of business bad debt,
treatment to stockholders whose interests are not subordinates
to the interests of other stockholders.
And this is just as it should be# because it's a
rare case in which an employe© with no other interest in a
corporation would undertake to advance substantial funds to#
or guarantee the debts of this corporation *
significant standard#

\tm

Application of the

believe# would go a long wey,toward

overcoming. the pres option in the Whipple case # a© can b© seen
from this case itself# a taxpayer may be able to overcome it
simply by testifying that h-j didn't give his investment a thought.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. NATHAN s

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleases

the Courts
May l say that that is not the only error that the
government has mad® in this case.

I submit that they are

attempting to mislead tills Court, not only as to the basic
facts that are involved, but also a© to proper interpretation
of the statute.
I think it might be beat, if I started out by pointing
out that Mr. Allen Generes was not a mere investor, m that

it h@re

Thar© is no dispute wkatSo-sver that Allan H. Geaeree

We stipulated

that he had "serving the corporation and receiving a salary"

Where do we find that in the record?

I'd like

to see the scope of the stipulation.

MR. NATHAN?

That's in the pretrial order, Your lienor,.

MR. NATHAN *

On pag® 9, X think.
We've also agreed, the government has

stipulated with us, that the taxpayer may have more than ons
trad® or business, as Mr. Genares did have.

He was the

president of Central Savings and loan Association, for which
he also received a salary.
The point here is that he rendered services to this
corporation, he received a salary of gore $12,000 a year, he
was not a majority shareholder, he only owned 44 percent of
the stock in the corporation, and no conclusions, X submit,
can be drawn from the fact that hie brother-in-law — a son-inlaw, I'm sorry, happened to be alec an owner of 44 percent of

MR. NATHANs

Q

That’s correct.

MR, NATHAN«

Yes# but w© acknowledged that that was

22

the proper value,

re never

practical matter*
What you really got down to here is that over a n^mo-or
of years this company was in the contracting business, and
you're talking about a very unique kind of business.

You'**

talking about a business that was engaged in municipal public
works contracts , for which they had to have payment end
performance bonds,

And I bad testimony introduced by the

vie© president of Maryland Casualty Company, by a local
insurance agent, all of them testified?

wa will not grant

payment and performance bonds to small corporations without
the personal endorsements of the principal officers of *h
corporations..
As a result of this, Alien Generas and his son-in-»

I think 'that significant motivation is

workable test under the statute, and that, what the government
is asking — what the Solicitor General is asking you to do is
to rewrite Section 166 of the internal Sevenua Code, ns they

The 1939 Code said the. debt must bs incurred

in the trade or business.
Then, in 1954, you have Section X66 amended, and you
hav© a new section added.

The old language, that © debt which

is incurred in the taxpayer's trad© or business, is kept, and a
new test is also given.

And that is at page 36 of the

Petitioner*® brief, where the statute is cited, which says —■

But you’r© — 1 guess you’re contending that if

But you’re relying on. —

You're relying on the statute rather than the

regulation?
MR. NATHANi

Well, Your Honor* I submit the regula­

tions are correct, because the regulations say that, they
interpret "in connection with" to mean there must be a proxi­
mate relationship.

Yes, but the Treasury interprets its own

regulations and says that "proximato" means primary.

My point her© is that "proximat®% .as this Court has
inferentialiy approved it, X -think is perfectly proper.
the question is;

Then

what do you mean by '’proximate1'?

And X would say that a significant relationship would
be proximate.

And that’s the basis of the argument.

You've got a statute which, if congress had s?o
intended, it might easily have said "a debt created ©r acquired
primarily in connection with a trade or business•R

That would

2 could not be her® arguing the

significant motivation test, if Congress had said that.
What the Solicitor General is attempting to do is to
amend the statute by inserting e word that Congress itself did
not put. in.
Q

You think, as a matter of law, "in connection

with a trade or business” means that, it must be a business bad
debt if it's incurred for two reasonss

one, a business reason?

and one, a nonbusiness reason?
MR. NATHAN;

Provided the business reason bears —-

is a significant relationship, yes.
Q

Well, let’s say that they're 50/50.

MR, NATHANS

Then —

Q

You think t3:lr? connection with* necessarily "asa$&

that it’s a business bad debt?
MR. NATHAN;
Q

1 do# Your Honor.

Even though 50 parcent of the reason is that it

is not in connection with a business?
MR, NATHANt

That is correct.

But I‘ v7ouId submit if

there is a significant relationship in the business relationship
area# then that gives rise to a business bad debt.

And if

Congress did not intend that result# ail Congress had to do was
say ’'primarily in connection with*# and that would have ended
the matter,
■'And they have done that in other sections of the Cede.
This Court has interpreted other sections of the Cod© as# for
example# with capital assets# where you talk about "primarily
for sale# in the ordinary course of business"; the Court has
f

interpreted the word "primarily*# and that would have put/ an
end to the matter her®.

But when they say "in connection with"#

the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued its own regulations
and used the word "proximate".
I said that's what is meant here# a proximate
relationship; and then# of course, they get annoyed when courts
look at the wore "proximate" and# as the Second Circuit' did#
gad as 'the Fifth Circuit did# they see that there is an analogy
in the tort law — they haven't drawn on the tort law? but we
know that you may have more than on© proximate cause.

And all

that you're talking about there iff a certain nearness, a certain
importance? and I think that the point here is that this will
not give rice to baseless deductions'.

You cannot claim a

business bad debt unless theses is ft significant. relationship
between the loss or the debt and the employee’s trad© ox

business.
And I would submit that that test is just as easy,
if not easier, to apply by jury, and 1 think it’s more flexible.
it is fairer t© the taxpayer, it is fairer to everyon©.

Mr. Justice Marshall, if I may, I guess

1 would have to depart from the record, but this man had to g©
out and mortgage everything h© owned —
Q

Wall, 1 mean, —

MR. NATHAN:

-- to coma up with this money at the

Q

■** I’m not interested in going outside the

30
record, X'ra interested in whet's in the record.

That this

man has a $12,000 a year interest, jobwisc, and fee's willing
to put $200,000 up for that.
MR. MW:

Your Honor, that may b® somewhat mis­

leading, because what happened was that in 1962, at the ©nd
of tlx© game, really, this corporation, which had been having
millions of dollars of business every year, in 1962 they
seriously underbid two major contracts! and the corporation
became defunct. They defaulted on those contracts, end Maryland
stepped in.

In order to try to bail out ths corporation and to

salvage the operation., then in 1962 Mr. (Seneres made loans to
the corporation of a vary substantial amount,

you're right.

He tried to salvage the corporation at a time when it was going
under.
tod I submit that's a big difference.

Thor© you're

talking about loans to the corporation, and Mr. Generes
deducted those &u nonbusinoss bad debts, because ho loaned them
to thorn in the last year, at a time when rite corporation was
going under.
" what we're talking about in this esse is not a loan
to the corporation, it never was.

tod it's misleading in we

try to think ©£ it as a loan to the corporation.

This was an

agreement to a bonding company to personally indemnify that
bonding company if the bonding eompaay would writ© bonds for
the corporation.

31

in othar words,, you started b?%ek yasxs earlier, in
order to stay in business and.is order to hav© a going business,
you needed bonds as a fact of life in the construction business•
Kelly-Ganeres Construction Company could not get jobs if it
couldn't get payment and performance bonds.

And it couldn't

gat payment and performance bonds without the personal
endorsements of Mien H. Generes and William F« Kelly? and,
as a result, Generas and Kelly both agreed to Maryland, we’ll
personally indemnify*

That is not a loan to the corporation.

And the issue in the css© was in executing _ the
i

agreement to indemnify the bonding company, what was Geneses *
motivation?
Now, the trial judge charged this jury that there are
a number of facts, that they should consider, and only on® was
the motivation,

But the test,'.-.as now boiled down and gotten

to this Court ist

when ho executed that indemnity agreement

agreeing to indemnify Maryland so'that the corporation could
get bonds and go as a going concern, he was significantly
motivated by the desire fco protect his trade or business as

& salaried officer.
Q

What is the rule with — assume this buQii7.es®

That raises some vary sticky points, and X apologis®
for this, but th© case arises from Louisiana? and we have the
civil law system and not the common law, which do©© create some
problems that I would rather not — X would ba happy to discuss
th© partnership law in Louisiana.

But we make distinctions

that are not mad© in the other States•
Q

Mr. Nathan, l*m ® little intrigued by

comparative values hera»

As I read these briefs, there is a

good bit of talk about th© value of the investment on th© on©
hand and the salary on tile other.

And always th© latter is

referred to as $12,000,
Th© difficult 1 have is that th© investment consists
of taxpaid dollars; the salary consists of pretax dollars.
And hence my inquiry of Mr, Zinn as to trying to get some feel
for th© tax bracket in which this man was.

33
Actually he's not protecting the $12,000 net salary,
hmfe protecting the $12,000 gross salary an vm^: n:oproach,
which I assume, in actual dollars# as.ana something fan? l&ss
than that to hint? maybe $7,000 or so.
MR. KATHANs

World you agree?

I think that that's correct# Your Honor.

But, again, im don't have all of Mr, Generes*@ tar. returns in
the record.

His salary —» his total income aggregated about

$40,000 per year.

The man had formed Central Savings and Loan

Association in the 1930'a and had always bean the president and
general manager, and h© always had a good salary from that.
He had been in the contracting business long before
he ever set up Kelly-Generes Construction Company.

experience in it.

He started

H© had mmy years of

Then he- formed a partnership with his :• on-in-

law in the 1940 sa, during World War II, and then only in 1954
did they actually incorporate.

And at that point did he

become the owner of 44 percent, at that stag® of the game the
investment in the corporation was $30,900.
And X think in order to find out what the value of
that investment was, eight years later, you would have to look
at all of the corporate returns and s®@ what income the corpora­
tion had generated and so forth? it would .require a massive
amount of work# which we have not gotten into at this point.
Q

Well, my inquiry is directed to the other side Of

the seal©, and I think what I'm saying is that the $12,000

34
salary * if on© arc

litti® misleading* it’s southing far less than that.
Am 1 not correct?
MR. NATHANs

In fell® sense -that h® would hav© to bah©

into consideration that he would pay ordinary income tax an
his salary, I think that, is correct.
Q

so I think the balance, if there is one, is the

investment, on the ona hand, against maybe $7,000 pre-Stst©
income taxes on the other? do you have an income tss in
Louisiana?
MR* N&TH&N:
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, we do, Your Honor.

So it*s even loss than ray figures»

MR. NATHANs , B$t it’s a very nominal income tax? it’s
about 2 percent or 4 percent.
q

i suppose if we take that approach, Mr. Nathan,

«rail, v?a*d have to figuro this on what would be the cost of a
single premium annuity that, would produce 07,000 a year at the
' ^

given age of this man.

You said he was ©round, or sera®on© said

ha was around 70»
MR. NATHAN:

H© was 82 at the time of the trial.

So you would find it a very high premium, I submit,
Your Honor.
Q

Yes, well

MR. NATHAN:

But the main point is that the initial

investment was only $38#900 —-

Q

I suggest to the contrary# Mr. Nathan; it would

bo quite a low premium for -an annuity.

A high premium for

life insurance? but a lov? premium for an annuity.
Q

That's correct.

ME. NATHANs

There’s actually no way of knowing the

exact amount of the investment as of 1962, but the point, it?
that you’ve got a continuing indemnity agreement.

I might

submit that that would cast soma light on this, that, starting
at the outset in 1954# at the time the initial investment was
made, the bonding companies were then requiring personal
endorsements.

And that what happened was that ©vary time

.Kelly-Gen©res got a bond, a bid on a job, and they had a job
available to it and they needed a bond# Allen Generes and Bill
Kally went to Maryland Casualty and got a band, and they
personally agreed to indemnify Maryland Casualty Company.
Xfc was found that that was vary inconvenient, and,as
a result, in 1958 a blanket indemnity agreement was executed,
so that you didn't have to keep going to Maryland with each
job that was bid.
But the corporation did haw; assets, we can’t deny it,
there is testimony in the record that would give some indication
there that there were sane substantial assets, but that these
wore mortgaged up to the hilt.
Q

Dees this record show, Mr. Nathan, the comparative

yield to this gentleman out. of the carpor at ;7xo by way of
dividends and salary?
MR, NATHANs

It doss.

There ware no dividends paid.

This corporation never paid a dividend in its history*
Q

So that his only staka, in that sense, was the

ccnfcinu&d existence of the corporation, to continue fcn-? «alary.
MR. NATHAN: That33 correct.

It was a closely held

corporation, he did have his son-in-law, then there were other
sons-in-law who had about 12 percent, I think it is, of t>.3
stock of the corporation; but throughout its history the
corporation never paid a dividend.
But it did pay hi® salary, and it paid th© salary
every year, and there ware some years when the tax — the

They had, I think, over a $40,000

that even under a dominant motivation test, as the government
argues, that Allen H. Generes was predominantly motivated

But 1 think that the important question
Q

Well, wa wouldn't decide that question.

MR. NATHANj

That's correct, Your Honor.

But I would

submit that the important point for this Court is the interpreta­
tion of Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Coda, and there is
where you get down to the question of whether the significant
motivation is the proper test or whether the dominant motivation
is the proper test, 'and, for the reasons set forth in our
brief, primarily because Congress itself did not say "primarily

and they would know tin at.

X think it would fc®. just act easy to

determine between significant and insignificant motivations
as it may be to try to weigh on ® scale the difference between
a dominant motive and a loss dominant motive.
For those reasons, I submit to this court that the
trial judge’s charge to the jury was eminently fair and was
eminently appropriate, and that ties decision of th® Court of
V

Appeals was proper? and I urge the affirmance of th® Court of

q

Until this amm? the leading case in this field

MR. NATHAN:

Court, Your Honor.
I might say that they have split the saa.3 way tho
circuits have; but, again, they've gone 2 to 1, saying that the.
Generes case was properly decided by the courts below.
Q

Mr. Nathan, 1 noticed you’ve used several times

the phrase "in connection with", and perhaps 14m looking at the.
wrong paragraph.

Ware you paraphrasing — oh, I see,

Mr.

Justices Brennan has» just pointed it out "in connection with”»
"in the courses of" is the paragraph X was looking at.
Do you see a difference between the language ‘:in
connection with" and "in the course of"?
MR. NATHANs

Oh, yes, X think there would be —'2

would say there would b© a significant difference between the
two.

"In the course of", I think shows a directness that- "in

connection with® does not have.
you ha vs; an (a) and a {to) .

Just as hare in Section 166

The (to) says "a debt ... which is

,12

incurred in".

When you have an "incurred is;!, tfeora is a

directness that I think is not fcha sene as when you ©ay "a debt
created or acquired in connection with a trad® or business* •
I submit that that — that by doing that,. Congress is saying it
does not have to be directly incurred in the businessthe
relationship, as the Commissioner interpreted that, must b®
proximate.
And then the question is, the commissioner did not
define "proximate", and we have to come along and define it*
•That’s basically what the trial judge charged the jury on,
that there must be a proximate relationship.

And X would nubmit

that, just as in tort law, whore there may be more then oas
proximate cause, her© -there may be more than on® motivation»
And what you’re looking at is the significant- motivation,
I think, and if the business relationship between tha taxpayer’s
act, the debt and the loss, if there is a significant
relation**
»
ship between that debt and the trade or business of the tax­
payer, then I submit that under 166, as written, the taxpayer
is entitled to a business bad debt deduction.
So that if the commissioner of Internal Revenue
approves of that, he wants them to have the predominant teat
or fch© dominant motivation, then they should go to Congress and
get Congress to amend Section 166 and say "a debt created or
acquired (as the case may be) primarily in connection with a

I would not have the nerve to argue a significant motivation
test to the Court if Congress had put in the word "primarily",
as they have in many other sections of the Code.

But they

didn't put it in, and the Solicitor General w&^ts you to put
it in for them.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Nssfchan.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. ZZNH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ZIUlii

Thank you, Mr, Chi®f Justice.

I should like to respond first to the principal
argument which respondent makes hero.

It was the principal

argument in his brief, which focuses on subsection(A)of Section
166(d)(2), the "in connection with** language.
There is •»- as I understand the argument of
respondent, he conceives that subsection (B) would not be
sufficiently broad to allow a significant motivation standard.
Now, first of all, let me point out to the Court
that the term "proximate”, as it appears in the regulations
that w© have quoted on page 37, applies only to subsection (B).

That regulation was these long before the Cod© was ©mended i.t?
1954 f fco add s insect ion (A) »
Now, we have pointed out, on page 15 of our brief in
footnote 7, what Congress8 purpose waa in enacting subsection

(h) and it*© really quite simple.
Under the law as it existed before 1954, a taxpayer,
who acquired a debt when he was in a trade or business ar.d than
went out of a trade or business before a final dotowsn.n® hian »?&*.•;
made as to the worthlessness of the debt, was entitled only to
a nonbusiness bad debt.
The sole purpose of subsection (A), as we have stated
in footnote 7, was to make it clear that if a taxpayer went
out of business after haying acquired a debt in the course of
a trad© or business and than th© debt became worthless, h©
would got a business bad debt.
For this Court to read into that addition of sub­
section (A) all that, respondent urges, it seems to us, would
ba making an awful lot out of a little.

And 1 urge the Court

to read the legislative history of subsection (A)♦
short.

It is very

And that is the sole purpose of the addition.
As far as the absence of the word "primarily", X

would tank® two points:

First, it seems to us that just as we're

trying to read th© word "primarily" into th® statute, th©
respondent is trying to read the word ^significantly" into th©
statute.

W© think there's a gap there that this Court has to

fill, and it's not a one-sided gap, it has to to filial ©no w«iy
or tiie other.

Congress simply didn’t contemplata this dtvil

status cae® whan it..enacted this statist®.
Q

Would you agree, than, Mr* Sinn, that if

Congress had put the word “primarily" before th® words "in
connection with", the whole task would bo a great deal
simplified?

ME* SINN:
Justice.

1 don’t think we’d be here, Mr. Chief

But 1 think if they had put the word "aignifleetly“

in, we wouldn’t fo© here either*
Share’s & gap there, and this Court --

Q

2hey have need this term "primarily” in rr.-ny,

many other contexts, haven’t they?
MR. SINN:

Yes, they have, but under Section 165(c)

(2), which appear© an page 35 of our brief, it’s referred to
there as whether a loss is incurred in the transaction entered
into for profit.

And tbs very same Second Circuit, which held

adversely to fch© government; in Weddle, has held that loss
incurred in

a

transaction entered into for profit, you have fco

look for feh@ primary motivation of the taxpayer.
We have cited the Austin case in our brief to that
effect.

The taxpayer there purchased a residence, both for

personal purposes and to make

a

profit.

It was found that the

primary purpose was personal, and that waa the and of the case

had I guess i needn't point out? except in passing*
that tiie considerations that have expanded notions of proximata?,
cause are wholly different from those that this Court her: tt
take into account in deciding this case.
One final point.

Mr. Nathan would have this Court

draw a sever© distinction between loans and guarantees.

But

we don't think that's permissible under th© dsicisicn of this
Court in th© Putnam case.

Mr. Justice Brennan* there writing

for th© Court, held loans and guarantees are to be considered
tlie sarea, for purposes of interpretation e£ th© bad debt pro-»vision of th© Code.
For these reasons, then, we urge reversal of th©

j udgment below.
Q

Could I ask yous

It is accepted on both sides

that a loss from a debt incurred just to protect an investment
isn't a business debt, isn't a business loss?

MR. SIMMs

Well, that wouldn't bs — we, of course-

4?
agre© with that.

I assume that —

Well, I know, bat that5s ~~

MR. 2IKN:

Just comrson ground, I believe -•-»

— just common ground »-

MR. SIMMs

And w© agree, Mr,, Justice White®, tb&t the

Txont case was correctly decided.

That Is, where» the parson

is solely an employe© and is required as a. condition ©£
continuing employment to make a loan or guarantee his
corporation's debts, we would agree that that is incurred in a
trad©, or business.

Q

And a loss of the kind I was asking you about,

wouldnit ba a deductible loss either, would it?

I mean, if

you **- just the loss of an investment is not a deductible loss?
MR. SIMMs

Q

Yes,

MR. SIMMs

Q

It is deductible as a capital loss, ~™

but not as an ordinary loss,

Even *— and it’s not a transaction entered into

for profit?

MR. ZSEJNs

It; is a transaction, but — ar© you talking

about a stock investment?
