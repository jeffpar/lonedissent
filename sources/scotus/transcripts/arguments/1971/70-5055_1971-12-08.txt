We will hear arguments

MR. HUBSARTs

Mr. Chief Justics, and may it please

the Courts
I move that Nelson Bailey be permitted to argue

He is

a member in good standing of the bar of the State of Florida,
buit he's been a member for less than three years.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your Motion will be

granted.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILLIP A. BUBBART, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HUEBART:

This case is here on a petition for

writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida to review a
decision upholding the constitutionality of the '''wandering"
section of Florida's vagrancy statute against an attack made
and considered by the Florida Supreme Court and rejected, that
violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for
vagueness and overbreadth.
In this particular case, the petitioners were charged
in the Criminal Court of Record in and for Dade County, Florida,
fcv an Information filed by the State Attorney, charging the
defendants, and tracking the exact language of the statute.

856.02, which is before this Court for review, charging that
the petitioners were “vagrants by wandering and strolling
around from plane to place without any lawful purpose or object".
To this charge the petitioners entered a plea of not
guilty, and waived trial by jury.
At the time of the trial the defense counsel made an
oral motion to dismiss this particular charge cn the grounds
that the statx.it© was void for vagueness, and consequently
violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
That motion was denied and the trial judge made a
specific finding that the statute in question was, quote,
"crystal clear",
He furthermore entered a written order in which he
found that the statute was "constitutional within the meaning
of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Onited States Constitution".
A motion for new trial was filed in this case,
attacking the statute not only on the grounds that it was too
vague but also on the grounds of overbreadth; and that motion
was denied, and again the trial court specifically ruled the
statute was constitutional within the meaning of the due
process clause.
The question has been raised as to whether or not the
broadness issue was properly raised in the Florida courts.
That was contended on the motion for new trial and specifically

5
rejected by th© trial judge*
*

On appeal, the Supreme Court of Florida, in a S-to-2
decision, upheld the constitutionality of the* sstatute and
specifically considered and rejected, in the opinion, the
petitioners’ dual contentions -- the dual contentions made
before this Court — that th© statute was "so broad and vague
in nature as to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment" *
•The court has granted certiorari on the question
phrased in th® petition for writ of certiorari? namely, whether
the "wandering" section of the statute in question is so broad
and vague in nature as to violate the due process clan
Fourteenth Amendment*
Now, in resolving that issue, I think it's important
to examine, first, the exact language of the statute, it*s
legislative history, and the construction given to it by the
Florida courts*
Q

The statute provides -•»
What were the proofs?

MR» HUBBARTi

In this particular ease. Your Honor,

■the State presented one witness, who was a guard employed by
th® Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, and he testified that he was
patrolling this area in Bade County about Is30, 8 o*elocSc at
night.

He saw a car -- or he was in & car, and he saw the two

petitioners, along with a third party, walking along in the
roadway, on the public street,

Ha passed them. When he turned

6

'

around the corner he saw them go into a warehouse area, ©uui ha
saw them go behind a boxcar which belonged to the Seaboard
Coast Lin© Railroad»

He want up to the boxcar»

He didn't

see them, but he heard some noises from behind the boxcar, and
he saw one of the petitioners, smith, running from that area.
He went over and placed him under arrest — wall, first, he
called for some help from the Hialeah Police Department.

And

the petitioners were then placed under arrest.
The petitioners testified in this case that they were
never in the railroad yard, the warehouse yard, rather? that
they never attempted to break and enter any railroad car? that
they were walking along the street, going to see a friend.
Those were the proofs.
Q

Mr. Hubbart, do you think that the State of

Florida, could validly legislate and. make it an offense to wander
.. around a railroad yard when one has no business taking- him
there?
MR. HUBBART:

1 think they have a -- certainly a

legislative power to proscribe trespassing, Your Honor.

And

if the statute in question was a trespass statute, that is,
going on the property of another party, a railroad company,
without permission, I think it’s pretty clear that they could
make it a crime to do that.
Q

In their claim that they were just out walking,

did they concede that they were walking on railroad property?

7
MR. HUBBARTs

Ho»

Mo.

In fact there was — their

testimony explicitly was that they were on the public street
at all times.
Q

Then what's the argument that they were "without

any lawful purpose or object”?
MR. HUBBARTs Wall , I3ir. really at & less to answer that,
Your Honor, b@cau.se oar whole contention is that the statute
lacks an ascertainable standard of criminal conduct,
0

2 just wondered what was the State’s —

MR. HUBBARTs The State’s theory?

Q

Hew the proof established that they wore"without

any lawful purpose or object".
MR. HUBBARTs The State did not, really, offer any
argument in the lower courts•

The defense counsel offered an

argument, but th© State did not.
How, in resolving the —
Q

Well, counsel, weren’t there two counts here?

MR. HUBBARTs

Yes,

The second count was, charged

with —■
Q

What was the first count?

MR® HUBBARTs The first count was vagrancy? the second
count was attempted breaking and entering a railroad car.
Q

And we're talking about count one?

MR, HUBBARTs That’s correct,

Q

Well, the State's proof certainly want to count

8
— on count two certainly was rather explicit as to what they
claimed an "unlawful purpose" was.
MR. HUBBARTs

Yes, sir.

There’s no question that

the evidence was sufficient if believed by the trial judge,
which it was,
Q

To prove an unlawful purpose.
1
/

MR. HUBBART:

Not to prove an unlawful purpose, but

to prove attempted breaking and entering a railroad car, which
is subject -Q

You think that's something different?

MR. HU3BARTs Well, it's a separate statute.
Q

By the way, was there — was there a sentence

under count two?
MR. HUBBARTs
Q

Yes.

For .16 months?

MR, HUBBARTs

For 36 days on count one, credit for

time served? and the second count was six months in the county
jail and on® year’s probation.
Q

And to run concurrently?

MR, HUBBARTs That's correct,
0

And has he been serving?

MR, HUBBARTs
G

He served his sentence? correct.

And so there ware concurrant sentences?

MR. HUBBARTs That's correct.
Q

And you don't challenge count two?

ME» HOBB&RTs

Sof we don’t.

I mean,,
mean c they ware

convicted under a valid statute, no question about that.
Breaking and entering a railroad car.
Q

Well, why should we reach the constitutionality

of the statute under which count one is —•
MR. HOBSARTs

Wall, 1 era not — X have not appealed

count two at all; that’s not before the Court,
0
current.

The only —-

Well, X understand, but the sentences were con­

Do you think that your failure to —> your not

appealing count two prevents us from following our concurrent»'
sentence rule?
MR. HUBBARTs

Wall, Your Honor, as long as a person —

as X understand the law, as long as a person has a conviction
against him ho has standing to object to it.

And there5 a a.

conviction in this case against the defendant for vagrancy.
Wow, wa did appeal the other portion to the District
Court of Appeals, Third District, and they affirmed.
Q

X understand that.

But you don’t see any

problem her© about concurrent sentences?
MR. HUBBART4

Wo, I don’t.

As long as the petitioner

had the conviction against him, it seems to me we have standing
to object to it.
The statute provides "persons wandering ox strolling
around from place to place without any lawful purpose or
object" shall be deemed vagrants.

And punished according to

10
another statute, which provides a maximum punishment of a $200
fine and six months in the county jail.
The statute itself, of course, condemns 20 other
varieties of vagrants, which are before the Court, 1 believe,
in a comparable case of the Jacksonville ordinance just argued.
Professor Arthur Sherry of the University of
California Law School, in a survey of State vagrancy laws, has
referred to the Florida Act as "distinctly Elizabethan" and
"seems to have been selected at random from the Statute of
Elisabeth as it was enacted in 1597-98.'”
It is based on a .long line of English vagrancy
statutes dating back to the Fourteenth Century, which
constituted some of the most oppressive pieces of class legis­
lation ever enacted by the English Parliament.
in the words of Stephen, in. his History of Criminal
Law of England, these vagrancy laws constituted "the criminal
aspect of the poor laws", the purpose of which was to confine
the laboring population in England to stated places and fixed
places of abode where they were required to work at fixed
wages „
Furthermore, the legislation prohibited wandering
around in England.

And that was exclusively applied, of course,

against the laboring classes in England.
Mow, the Florida courts have given some construction
to the statute, and in line with the decisions of this Court,

11
that the court is hound by the State Court in the construction
of the statute, it's important to examina several cases.,
The leading easa is Hanks vs. State, Third District
Court of Appeals decision.

In that case the Third District

Court interpreted the terns “persons wandering or strolling
around from place "to place” to .mean by any mode of travel,
whether on foot or in a vehicle.

In that particular case the

petitioner contended that he was not in violation of the statute
because he was arrested in a sthionary automobile , and the
court held that the mode of travel was immaterial and that
one could “wander and stroll55 even in a- stationary automobile*
On remand, in Johnson

Statss after this Court

reversed in Johnson vs« Florida. f the Supreme Court of Florida
reluctantly held that the statute had no application, to a
parson sitting on a bus bench.

That was not “wandering and

strolling".
And finally the terms “without arty lawful purpose or
object" has been construed in the Hanks case to mean “without
good or sufficient reason", which, we submit» is even vaguer
than the statuta itself:

"without good or sufficient reason".

And, finally, the Supreme Court of Florida, in
Headley v. Selkowlta, has hold that this statute cannot be
applied against any person unless they are "vagrants of their
own volition and' choice65»
NOW,

12
Q

Could I just ask you again, to make it clear,

just to go back a little —
MR, HUBBARTs

MR. HUBBARTs

He served both of them.

consequences of — not in terms of losing your right to vote

X s@®,

MR. HUBBART:

In the court below, the Supreme Court
I

of Florida interpreted the statute and construed it as being
derived from 85the genre of vagrancy law® which have long been
upheld as necessary regulations to deter vagabondage and
prevent crimes and the imposition upon society of able-bodied
irresponsibles who of their own volition become burdens upon
others and particularly on their families for support.”

Mow, w© submit that this section of the statute, as

i

13
construed by the Florida coiurts, in \mccmtitutional on its
face» in violation of the cue- process- clause». of the Fourteenth
Amendment „ for two reasons 2
First, the statute is so vague that a person of covreron
intelligence cannot know what is forbidden, thereby inviting
arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement :j£ the statute by
State authorities.
And, secondly, the statute is so broad that it abridges
rights protected by the United States Constitution, to wit:
the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures
*

and the right to travel.
The law in this area, of course, is pretty clear.
It has been stated by this Court in the Connally case, that the
"terms of a penal statute creating a new offence- must be
sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it
what conduct oil their part will render them liable to this
Court’s penalties", and "a statute which either forbids or
requires the doing of an act in termo so vague that men of
common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and
differ as to its application violates the first essential of
due process of law".
In the Lan.aetta case, this Court held that a vague
criminal statute is void on its face, regardless of the facts
of the case, and regardless 3 of the details of the offense

charged

14
Now, the Supreme Court, in this particular case,
has interpreted this statute to be a necessary regulation "to
prevent crimes, to deter vagabondage, to prevent people from
living off other people®.

New, this construction of .the

statute, we submit, is a frank concession that the law does
not even purport to prohibit specific acts of criminal
conduct, but instead prohibits a vaguely defined way of life,
which is thought in the future to lead to crime,
But it’s clear that the construction of the statute
is that it's not aimed at any specific acts of criminal
conduct„
And Mr* Justice Frankfurter, who took a narrow view
of -the void-for-vagueness doctrine in the Winters ease,
pointed this out precisely when he said that these vagrancy
"statutes are in a class by themselves, in view of the familiar
abuses to which they are put."
"Definiteness is designedly avoided so as to allow
the net to be cast at .large, to enable man to be caught
who are vaguely undesirable in the eyes of police or prosecution,
although not chargeable with any particular offense* In short,
these 5vagrancy statutes* and laws against 'gangs’ are not
fenced in by the text of the statute or by the subject matter
so as to give notice of conduct to be avoided."
And that is exactly how the Florida court hass inter­
preted this statute, namely, it’s designed to prevent -.crimes

IS
and not to act on any specific acts of criminal conduct*

And

the Attorney General, v.?ith commendable candor in this ease,
has conceded that this statute is designed to prevent csis

,

not to punish crime but to prevent it before it even happens.,
It’s aimed at this vaguely defined way of life?
vagabondage, and wandering around.
This Court, in Lansetta vs. New Jarsov, considered a
statute which is rather similar to this case.

Xt was an anti*-

gangster statute• The purpose of the statute, according to the
Supreme Court of New Jersey and the Attorney Genaral of New
Jersey, was exactly the purpose as urged here 'in this statute5
namely, it was designed to prevent crime before it happened.
And in that particular case, there was a New Jersey statute
which made it a crime for any person "not engaged in any
lawful occupation, known to be a member of a gang consisting of
two or more persons'5, and this Court held that the term "gang"
was too vague to withstand any type of constitutional test.
Now, we contend that the term "without any lawful
purpose or object", which means, according to the Florida court,
"without good or sufficient reason5' is too vague to withstand
constitutional test.
Q

Wall, th«s$re isn't any question, though, is there,

counsel, that someone was — who, if you believed the police
officer in this case, there was an attempt to break in a freight
car.

Now, no one would have any doubt but what "without lawful

16
purpose" would apply to this particular case»
MR. HUBBART:
Q
they?

It didn’t have it --

I mean anybody would understand that * wouldn't

If it means anything, it means you shouldn't be around

with the purpose of robbing a freight oar„
MR. HUBBARTs

If Ycur Honor please# he certainly had

notice that this activity violated the burglary statute.
Q

And not notice —

MR. HUBBART; But he did not have notice —
Q

Why?

MR. HUBBART:

— that it violated ‘the vagrancy

statute.
Q

Why?

"Without lawful purpose”?

MR. HUBBART;
Q

No,

Why?

MR. HUBBART;

I mean# it's impossible for a person

of common intelligence to know what this means.
Q

To know that being on the street for the purpose

of robbing a freight oar is not covered by that statute?

He

wouldn't know that?
MR, HUBBARTt

Mo.

No.

I mean it's impossible for a

parson of common intelligence to — now# of course# that type of
activity might violate another statute.
Q-

Well# I understand that,

MR. HUBBART;

But as the way it’s interpreted by the

.1?
Florida courts is "without good and sufficient reason".

How,

X submit there’s no —Q

He knows it unlawful to rob a freight car, doesn't

ha?
MR. HUB8ART:
Q

Yes.

He knows that.

MR. BUB3ARTs Attempting to,

Q

Or to attempt it.

And you suggest that he would

not know that that statute that says he shouldn’t be on the
street with an unlawful purpose includes being on the street
for the purpose of robbing a freight car?
MR. HUBBAR7s Well, if Your Honor please, our position
is that the statute is vague on its face, that it’s not necessary
to get into the facts of the case at all.

If the statute lacks

an ascertainable standard of criminal conduct, as 1 understand
the law, ~
Q

Well, I know, but —

MR.KUBBART§

~ it's not necessary to oven consider

the facts of the ease.
Q

Why, I understand that.

But hers the facts

are that — you know, a lot of vague statutes are vague in
some applications and not in other®.
MR. HUBBARTs Well, it’s cur position that there is no
conceivable set of facts., -Q

That any intelligent person —

18
MR, HUBBART;
constitutionally applied.

that this statute could be
Yes, sir,

A person of common Intelligence is not placed on
notice as to what a good or sufficient reason for wandering or
strolling might he? what is a good and sufficient reason to one
parson may not appear so to another.

The statute, for instance,,

gives no notice as to whether or not aimless wandering or
strolling —■
Q

Well, what about robbing a freight car?

MR. HUBBARTs Well, Your Honor, that is, we submit,
too vague, to let a person know exactly what he is not

•

supposed to do.
Now, there is no question that Your Honor is alluding
to the fact that this man was violating a specific statute on
the Florida books, which was the attempted burglary statute.
Which I think illustrates the really non-essentialnese of
these — of this type of legislation,
Q

That isn't the question, what is essential;

the question is whether it's constitutional.
MR. HUBBARTs That's correct.
Q

And in this case.

MR. HUBBARTt Well, as I understand — now, perhaps
I'm misreading some of the cases in this area, but as I understand the law, it is that if the statute lacks an ascertainable
standard of criminal conduct, that is, if we look at the

19
statute on its face, and we see no real ascertainable standard
of criminal conduct, then the statute is unconstitutional,
regardless of what the facto of the .case may be.
In other words, the facts of the case do not save
the statute. '
The' statute gives no notice, for instance, as to
whether or not aimless wandering or strolling around from
place to place is without good and sufficient reason.

If so,

I suppose most of Florida5s tourists and retirees who have
cora© to Florida and wander around, sort of aimlessly, in the
resort areas and on the beaches of our State, and. in shopping
areas, arguably would be in violation ©f the statute.
h person- of common intelligence is also not placed
on notice as to whether or not he’s to give a good or sufficient
reason for his wandering and strolling whan stopped by an
inquiring police officer,, or whether his silence on the subject
would automatically mean he did not have a good and sufficient
reason for wandering and strolling.
Also the statute gives no notice as to whether or not
the inquiring police officer must be satisfied that the reason
given fey the person was good and sufficient reason for wandering
and strolling.
Q

What if it was 3 o’clock in the morning, would

that make any difference as distinguished from, let us say,
3s©0 in the afternoon?

20
MR. HUBBART:

Your Honor, 1 think there5a a differ­

ence between suspicious conduct and a violation of the statute.
There8s no question that if a police officer saw a man at
3 o'clock in the morning wandering around in a place, in a
dark area, that ho would be on inquiry to investigate that
man.

But I submit, as Mr, Justice Stewart pointed out in his

concurring opinion in Palmar, that the government has no
constitutional authority to make that suspicious circumstance a
criminal offense,
0

What does the police officer do when he stops

him at 3 o'clock in the morning and makes the inquiry?

What

inquiry does he make, constitutionally, in your view?
MR. HUBBART:

In Terry vs„ Ohio? I think it's pretty

clear — it's fairly clear as to what his constitutional
authority is.

If he has any facts tc v/hich he can point to,

which are really less than probable cause, that the man is armed
and dangerous and a threat to either him or people in the
vicinity, he may conduct a carefully limited search of .his
outer clothing to determine whether or not lie has any weapons.
Certainly there is no constitutional prohibition
against any police officer asking oae.-what he8 s doing in the
area, without getting into the question of whether or not the
parson has to answer the question.
Q

Are you then conceding that there is an obliga­

tion to give an account of yourself?

I

21
MR, HUBBARTs
Q

NOT I'm not.

Then what's the good in saying the policeman can

ask him, if he —
MR. HUBBART t Because 1 think that may stop any
potential criminal conduct.
Q

If the officer is there.

Do you want us to speculate that police inquiries

will have a therapeutic effect on crime?
MR. HUBBART:

Ho, I’m not at all.

But I do think

that -~
Q

Well, isn’t it a little bit abstract to say that

the police may inquire if, in the next sentence, you say that
he need not answer?
MR. HUBBARTs Wall, without reaching that question;
1 don't knot? whether this Court has over really resolved that
issue, of whether or not It is possible for a person to be
detained and require soma answers.
But X am saying *—
Q

Wall, the stop-and-frisk statutes have some

relationship to this, do they not?
MR. HUBBART;

Yes, I think they do»

’Certainly»

And

2 think the Terry case, in the concurring opinion by Mr. Justice
White, a suggestion was mad® that they should have the power
of — the police, in addition to stopping and frisking, also
of inquiring.
Mow, the vagus and —

Q

Excuse ms.

MR. HUBBRRTs
Q

Yes, sir.

If this statute ware worded the way the

respondent would have us read it» and you can understand that
this is on the basis of respondent's brief? we haven't heard
hi®, argue yet — as though it said, as though it made it
unlawful for a person to wander from place to place with a
criminal purpose, with a criminal purpose? would you still
think it would ba unconstitutionally vague?
MR. HUBSART;

Q

I believe .so.

You’d have a weaker argument —

MR. HOBB&RTs

I'd have a weaker argument, 2 think,

yes.
Q

— on that,

MR. HUB8AHTs

There is some case law interpreting

mens re a, what, mans rea means is criminal intent, but even
that, that body of law refers to intent to do something.

In

other words, the concept of a criminal act, as I understand it,
is a combination of intent and an act.

The wandering is

certainly not anti-social.
0

But wandering with a criminal purpose is.

MR. HUBBART?

I deny that the government has the

constitutional authority to punish a man for what he’s thinking.
And to walk around, thinking that you're going to commit a
crime is one thing, but doing it is something else.

23
Q

Certainly the crime of attempt has been upheld

,

and the crime of conspiracy has been upheld —
MR* HUBBART: That’s right,
Q

— even though the object of conspiracy is never

realised.
MR. HUBBART2 That’s correctf but the attempt 1aw, as
1 understand it? is that mere preparation to commit an offense
is nob an attempt. There must be an overt act toward commission
of that, offense.
In other words? to think about committing the offense
yourself? X mean not in conspiracy with anyone else? but to
think about it? and even make some arrangements to commit it?
is not an attempt to commit it.

There must be an overt act

toward •— designed to accomplish that.
So X would deny that the government has the
constitutional authority to punish somebody for thinking about
committing a crime.
Q

Well', this is —-

MR. HUBBART:
G

The fellow was walking,

-- walking towards an apartment building —

MR. HUBBART$ The fallow was walking.
Q

in order to rob an apartment in that building.

MR, HUBBARTt

That’s right.

There’s no question

that is a suspicious circumstance* which- & police officer may
want to inquire about? but. X don’t think that that’s sufficient

24
in itself to punish him for committing an offense.
Q

Is the construction of this phrase "without any

lawful purpose or object" contained in the case of Hanks v„
State'

—
MR. HUBBART; That's correct.
Q

of those words

— the only one, the only judicial construction
-

MR. HUBBARTs That’s correct.
Q

— in Florida, in the Florida cases?

MR. HUBBARTs

That's correct.

And the construction

is "without good or sufficient reason".
0

Yes, I just read it.

0

what would you say to a man wandering around the

streets, day or night, with the object in his mind that "if I
see a car with keys in it, I'm going to steal it"?
MR. HUBBART?

I don't think the government has the

constitutional authority to prohibit that.

If he i© in the

process of doing it, though, or commits an act towards
accomplishing that, that's something «alsa.
Q

Well, what provision in the Constitution says

the State can't do that?
1 gather, what Justice Marshall suggested, to gat a
specific statute that you're wandering around with the purpose
in mind of stealing a car if you find keys in it.
that's the phrasing of the statute.

1 gather

25
Why is it

*— what provision of the Constitution says

the State can’t snake that a crime?
MR. HUBBARTs Well, I would say the due process clause,
I don’t know if that fully answers Your Honor’s question.

The

due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, 1 submit, limits
the power of the State to punish certain types of acts of
crimes,
l suppose this goes to —
Q

1 would think that's an independent ground that

you could argue here, because this, the most this law says is
you can’t bo on the streets with an unlawful purpose,
MR. HUBBARTs But the "unlawful purpose" means "without
good and sufficient reason®,
Q

Well, all right

Q

The same thing,

Q

that’s the same thing,

MR, HUBBARTt Well, not really the same thing.

It’s

got a little vagueness.
Q

Well, why don’t you make your due processr*

argument, then, that the States — the criminal law just may
not be interposed in this system dealing with due process?
MR, HUBBARTs That’s right.

That’s my position, that

it is a violation of the due process
Q

Which is substantive.

MR. HUBBARTs

Yes, I guess it does make it sub-

26
aitantive due process,
Q

That is not a vagueness concept.

MR, HUBBARTs

Well, that’s correct, 2 think we are

getting into a substantive argument.
The vagueness point, however, is still valid, it
seems to me, if it does not apprise a person as to what an
"unlawful purpose" is,

I mean, it’s one thing, as the

respondent argues, that a person should, know in his heart of
hearts what's unlawful.
Well, it seems to me that’s the function of a criminal
statute, to say exactly what’s unlawful.

And it doesn’t.

It simply doesn’t.
Q

You’d have to be pretty subnormal, though, not

to realise that robbing a freight car is unlawful.
MR. HUBBART;

But, Your Honor, if there was a

statute saying you shall not commit an unlawful act, and the
evidence was that this man had broken and entered a railroad
car, I don’t think there5d be any question the statute woulds
be struck down &a void-for-vagueness.
Q

Well, if a State may, constitutionally, make

being on the street for an unlawful purpose a crime* the fellow
is there for the purpose of robbing a freight car, 7. suggest
that he knows he’s violating that statute.
MR. HUBBART: Well, I don’t agree.
G

I know you don't!

Because —

27
(Laughter.}

Q

May X ask, before you sit down —

MR. HOBBART:
Q

Yes, sir.

Getting back to what Justice White asked you

earlier?

This conviction under this statute, he got 36 days,

you said.

What might have been the punishment?
MR. HOBBART?
Q

Pardon me?.

What might have been the

what's the maximum?

MR. HOBBARTs Six months.
Q

Six months.

Under Florida law, may that

conviction be used in a recidivist situation, do you know?
MR. HOBBART:

1 don't believe so, no.

The

recidivist statutes are on felonies only.
Q

Gould it be used on impeachment, if he took the

stand, —
MR. BUBB&KTt
Q

— in some later case?

MR. HUBBARTs

Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, it could.

Eithsr in civil or criminal process?

MR. HOBBART2

Let me answer it this ways

A violation

of a State statute, whether it ba felony or misdemeanor, may be
used to impeach the man, the defendant, if he takes the stand
as a witness.
Q

It's violative *-■»
That's in either civil or criminal case?

MR. HOBBARTs That's correct

SB
Q

Yes.

MR, HUBBART:

i
Now, if he:? violates a municipal

ordinance, he can't he impeached for that,
Q

Well now, is there any other disability from

this conviction that might follow?
i

1 mean it doesn't —
MR, HUBBART•

ii

Legal disabilities?
t

Q

Yea.

It doesn't affect his right to vote, you

t

say?
MR, HUBBARTs

No, it does not affect his right to

vote,
Q

How about employment?

In the State —
t

MR. HUBBARTg Well, employment, certainly.

It would

prohibit him from being -•*
Q

What do you mean?

But 2 couldn't ■— I really can’t

cite you any statutes on that.

I'm inclined to tiling there ar®,

though,
Q

Well, X'ra just wondering why they

why isn’t

the case moot?
MR. HUBBARTj Well, I don’t think the case is moot by
virtue of the fast that he has a conviction on his record, and
•this is going to affect him —*
Q

Yea, but he served his time.

And I think that

sometimes has considerable effect, if there's no real
disabilities that follow from —
MR. HUBBARDS Wall, X think Your Honor has already
mentioned one.
Q

A legal one.
On impeachment —

MR. HOBBARTt
Q

On impeachment.

— that's the one you suggested.

MR. HUB8ARTs Wall, I’m also suggesting a social
disability would follow, I mean it's difficult, certainly? and
I think the stigma which comas from conviction cf any crime
is a very heavy one in this society.
Q

But what about the stigma of two,instead of one,

convictions?
MR. HUBBART:

That’s correct, yes.

You have two

30
convictions.
Q

Why, do you think people Measure that?

MR. HUBBART;

I think they certainly do.. The longer

the record, the worse it becomes.
Q

You’re speculating, though, aren’t you?

MR. HUBBARTs

No, I don’t think I'm speculating at all,

from what I've seen trial judges do? the longer the record, the
bigger the sentence.
Q

Well, if a person says, *1 will not hire a man

convicted of breaking into a boxcar, especially since he was
also convicted of disorderly conduct”, do you think that’s
normal?
MR, HUBBARTs
you phrase it, no.

No,

No —» (laughing)

There's no question about it.

not the way
It wouldn't.

But —

Q
have here?

Well, isn’t that pretty close to the situation you
Justice Marshall's hypothesis,

MR. HUBBARTs

X don’t think so, because I think some

employers might want to take a chance with somebody with just

one conviction.

If the second one is as a vagrant, they may

consider him to be an irresponsible type of person, who just is
not going to be able to be rehabilitated,
X don’t know*
lot of it, in this area.

1 guess we're speculating, really,- a
But it seems to me, as almost a given,

that any conviction of any crime, of whatever variety it is, is

31
bound to hurt a person living in this country.
It certainly can't help him, that’s for sure.
Thank you*
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER2

Mr. Bailey.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NELSON E. BAILEY, ESQ.t
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BAXLEY;
the

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

members of the Courts
There* e only one section of the Florida vagrancy

statute that5& at issue her®, and that is the section which
proscribes the act of "wandering or strolling around from place
to place without any lawful purpose or object".
Q

Mr» Bailey, may I ask, is it the practice in

Florida to make — what you have 'hero is the same conduct,
isn’t it?
ME. BAILEY;
Q

That is correct.

And as to this — two or one petitioners?

Two.

As to these two, the identical conduct is made the subject of
two offences.
MR, BAILEY;
0

That is correct,

Is that a practice that you follow up in Florida?

MR. BAXLEY;

The State of Florida docs not recognise

the same-transaction concept of double jeopardy.
<
you're asking —
Q

1 don’t mean this —

That’s what

39
MR. BAILEY?

Wall , then, perhaps I misunderstand

your question,
Q

I*m asking whether -- what happened here was the

identical conduct was made the subject of two different counts?
MR. BAILEY * That's correct.
Q

And he was convicted on both?

MR, BAILEY:

Different elements of the same incident,

yes.
Q

Different e lemenfcs ?

MR. BAILEYs

Yes.

Q

The essential element, I gather, was the

What?

unlawful purpose element of this statute, was satisfied by the
Attempt to break info the boxcar?
MR, BAILEYs
Q

That is correct,

That's what you relied on?

MR. BAILEY: That’s correct»
Q

And without that, would you have convicted him?

MR. BAILEY:
Q

Without that proof?

MR. BAILEY:
Q

We would have ~
Under that'statute?

Not under this statute»

All right?

so you mad® the same conduct, the

identical conduct, attempting to break into the boxcar, the
subject of two — of prosecution for two offenses?
MR. BAILEYs

Well, the being abroad for that purpose

supports this conviction here.

The actual attempt itself —

33
Q

' x£ you didn't have the proof that ha attempted

to break into the bosscar, you could never have convicted him.
MR. BAILEYs
Q

There would have been no case, yes.

That's right.

So you did take attempting to

break into the boxcar and made it the subject of two offenses.
You gave him two convictions and two separate sentences.
MR. BAILEY? Well, let me put it this ways

We could

have arrested them before they got to it, and attempted to
break in.
Q

That's what you did,

I'm talking about what

happened, in this case, if I understand it correctly.
MR. BAILEYs

Yes, well, I don't understand what the

nature of your question is, then.
Are you suggesting it's objectionable to charge him
with two charges?
Q

I asked you what the

practice was in Florida?

is that what you do?
v

MR. BAILEY?

This is not a general practice, that I

know of, no.
How, there are other types of cases, where we do
charge two or three charges, where, in other States, that would
not be proper, because of their double jeopardy concepts, you
s@©.
But in this
Q

I thought that was a federal question.

34
MR. BAILEYt
Q

Referring to what?

Double jeopardy.

MR. BAILEYs .Yes.

No, what I’m saying is that in

some States our statute would not be used in many situations
where it is used or could be used in -the State of Florida.
I believe the State of New York and under federal crimes, the
single-transaction concept applies, so that in many instances
it would not be proper to charge a man for being abroad for
that purpose, if you charged him for actually attempting or
doing the criminal act.
Q

You're talking about federal law, though?

MR. BAILEY s
Q

Yes.

Not Florida law?

MR. BAILEY:

Wo.

What I'm saying is there is no

federal law that I know of that prohibits, or that requires
the State of Florida to recognise the single-transaction concept.
Q

How you are arguing the case that's about feo

be argued hero later.
MR. BAILEY;

Okay,

But let me continue, then, because

this does not cover every situation, that issue, anyway.
/

Q

Mr. Bailey, let ms follow through on Justice

Brennan's questions v Do you bring the two charges because you're
not sure how far your evidence will take you?
MR, BAILEYs

There are situations where you could

feel, as a prosecuting officer, that you could have proved he

35
was abroad with that intent; but you might feel that you would
not have sufficient evidence to prove that he actually
perpetrated the act,
Well, you had no eyewitness hare of the act, I

Q
take it?

MR. BAILEY*

Wo.

The only eyewitness saw him going

to and coming from, and he heard the noises while they were at
the boxcar.

The seal of the boxcar was broken.

The type

noises that this officer heard were the type noises made in
breaking a seal of the boxcar.
Q

That made out the offense? didn’t it?

MR. BAILEY5
Q

Yes? it is.

And you got the conviction.

So you got the

conviction for the lesser included offense and the «*MR. BAILEY:

No, it’s not a lesser included offense?

it's an entirely separate act.
Q

You don’t think it’s a lesser included offense'!

MR. BAILEY3
0

Ho? I don’t believe so.

Do you agree that the same facts make or are

essential to ~MR, BAILEY %

— support both convictions in this

c&sa?
Q

Yes.

ME. BAILEY*

We could have convicted him on — we

could have convicted these two petitioners? conceivably, for

36
being abroad with the unlawful purpose, without them aver
actually having gotten there and committed the act.
Does that answer your question?
Q

How could you prove their intent?

MR. BAILEY: Well; that’s a problem of circumstantial
proof.

Suppose they had lived in Tampa, Florida, and they had

told 15 friends of theirs that they were going to go over —
Q

That's not this case.

MR. BAILEYs

No, but I'm saying you could prove

Intent before they actually got there and committed the act.
And you could arrest, them in the process or going abroad for
the purpose of committing that crime.
Q

Here the only way you can prove the intent was

the observation of the officers of the coming-and-going, and
hearing the noises

isn81 that right?

MR. BAILEY2

In this particular case, that was the

circumstantial evidence that supported proof of their intent,
yes.
Q

And that supported the other offense, too, did

it not?
MR, BAILEYj That is correct.
Q

Mr. Bailey, do 1 understand you, that if a man

says to 15 people ~ I think was your number ~ that he is
going over to rob a boxcar, and he goes down the street and
goes to church, he can get convicted?

37
MR. BAILEY;

It'3 a problem of circumstantial proof.

You could have the testimony of those 13 people, pitas his acts
of going abroad.

If he was going abroad in the direction of

the boxcar,, if he was walking down the railroad property —”
Q

But you don't, know what was on his mind when ho

was walking down the street, and you can't prove what was on
his mind as he was walking down the street.
MR. BAILEYt

If you can't prove it, you have no case

©gainst the man.
Q

That's right.

MR. BAILEY *
Q

There are circumstances —

So how can you convict him?

How can you convict him?
MR, BAILEY2 Well, in that example —
Q

How can you convict him or» what'8 in his mind?

MS. BAILEY: The same way you can —
Q

Wall, let me put it this way:

How do you get it

out of his mind and into the record?
MR. BAILEYs

By circumstantial evidence, the same way

you convict a man for
Q

Just a minute.

Mow, we've got circumstantial

evidence on top of. an ambiguous statute.

Where will that lead

us?
MR, BAILEY: Well, there's nothing ambiguous about this
statute, Your Honor, that would be our position.

And as far as

38
proving a man's intent, we would —
Q

How do you know, when you se& a man walking down

the street, that he's violating the statute?
MR. BAILEYi

You have to have soma reason, some

circumstantial evidence, or atoms statements by him, or other
reasons for having probable cause to believe that he is
violating the statute.
Q

Find a lot of help in the old cases on

constructive treason.
Q'

My second point les

when the concurrent sentence

came up, you knew ha was going to get a concurrent sentence,
difn61. you?
Didn't you?
MR. BAILEYz
Q

Well, that was rather —

Why didn't you drop count one?

Why did you

leave it in there?
MR. BAILEY? Why should we drop it. Your Honor?
was guilty of that crime.

He

It is a crime in the State of Florida,

and we proved it and w® convicted him ©n it.
Q

Well, why do you need to have his conviction?

For what purpose?
MR. BAILEYs

Well, as a practical matter, to be honest

with you, this would be a secondary charge if you failed to
prove the actual perpetration of the attempt.
lesser included offense, it's a separate act.

It's not a

33
Q

But, even after that* why did you insist on

leaving both charges in at the end?
It was because you wanted him to be

have soma

effect on his future,, didn’t you?
MR. BAILEY *

Your Honor, I didn't prosecute the case,

1 rather imagine the only reason --Q

Well, you represent the State of Florida, that’s

—«• the State of Florida prosecuted, didn’t it?
MR* BAILEY:

Ye©, the State of Florida prosecuted.

1 have not talked to the people who made the decision on why
to prosecute these particular charges.
Q

And isn’t it the reason that yon wanted him to

have two strikes on him?
MR, BAILEYs
at all. Your Honor,

X rather doubt that that's the case
It would aesm rather apparent to me that

the objective was, if they failed to prove the actual
perpetration of an act towards accomplishing this intent on
the boss car itself, an actual attempt to — attempt to break
and enter, then they would still convict him for being abroad
with that intent.
Because he went there with that purpose, and the
evidence established that,
Q

What evidence?

MR. BAILEY:
Q

The evidence of his acts, in this case,

That’s what I'm talking about.

40
MR. BAILEYs

Right.

Wall, in other cases yon could

have the evidence from the police at point of action.
Q

Well, we8re talking about this one.

MR* BAILEY; ■ 1 see the problem, you're getting to*
Q

Don't you see how he suffers by having these two

convictions, more than he would by one conviction?

And. I get

the impression, up to now, that you want him to have two for
some reason.

And you haven’t satisfied m® that there isn't

some reason for having the two.
MR. BAILEY; Well, if there is, I*m not aware of if.
But ©van if there is a reason, it would he my position to state
that Florida has the authority under this statute to do so*
Q
Florida.

Because that's the law of Florida?

The law of

But what is the federal law on that?
MR. BAILEYs
Q

Federal law —

Double jeopardy.

MR. BAILEYs Because of the nature of the evidence in
this case, I suppos® if the man had not been convicted, if he
had been acquitted, of an attempt, and there was no other
evidence other than his attempt to establish his intent, then,
there would have been no evidence to support this charge.
Q

Which?

Two or one?

Count two or count one?
MR. BAILEY;

There would have been no evidence to

support count one, the vagrancy charge.

41
Q

But, as it was, your point is that under Florida

law he was guilty, found guilty of two separate offenses.
MR. BAILS?: Right.
Q

It’s not an offense and a lesser included

offenser it's two separate offenses.
MR. BAILEYt That is exactly right,
0

Going on the same basic transaction.

That * s a.

perfectly rational and legitimate position to take, it seems to

me.
Q

Do you also have a trespass statute?

MR. BAILEY*

Yes.

Yes, we do have a trespass

statute.
Q

Why didn't you charge him with that, too, while

you. were at if?
MR, BAILEY:
Q

Well, I don't know why the reason is -«

Well, is it possible under Florida law you could

have got him convicted on all three counts?
MR, BAXLEY:
Q

And you see nothing wrong with that?

MR, BAILEY:
acts.

X presume it would foe, yes.

Mo, 1 do not.

They are all separate

Separate crimes.
Q

You mean they are called separate crimes?

MR. BAILEY*

He could have committed any one of those

crimes without committing the other two, let's put it that way.
Mow

42
Q

May I asks

does the State have a reason not to

urge on us that we ought not reach the constitutional question
here on concurrent sentences?
MR* BAILEY % Because of the mootness issue, also?
Q

On concurrent sentences*

MR. BAILEY:
0

No, Your —

And he served the one.

MR, BAILEY;

Yes.

No,Your Honor, if I had a good

argument there, it would he basically just that 1 missed it.
I also am inclined to urge this Court to go ahead and
decide the case*
Q

Well, --

MR, BAILEY?

We're not going to rely on mootness, if

we have the position, because the State of Florida is in the
process, and has been for a while, of redrafting its vagrancy
statutes.

We know other States also are in the process.

There is some confusion among State Legislatures because of
recent opinions by this Court, and they need some guidelines.
And this is the time when they're redrafting the vagrancystatutes .
Q

Kow can we decide it and avoid the constitutional

question?
MR. BAILEY?

I'm not sure I understand your question.

The constitutional question is the only one that's —
Q

Well, apparently, if the concurrent-sentence

43
doctrine applies here# we can avoid decision on the constitu­
tional question.

You’d rather wa not avoid it, but decide it

even if you could have urged concurrent sentences?
MR, BAILEY?

Yes.

I

mean if you’re going to turn

around and say that the single-transaction concept is required
by constitutional law, in those States —
Q

I didn’t say that.

You have concurrent

sentences here, don’t you?
MR. BAILEYt

Yes.

Q

And he served one of them —

Q

Both of the».

MR. BAILEYs
Q

Oh, both of them, he served both of them?

MR. BAILEY %
Q

Both of them, yes.

Both are completed, that’s correct.

All right.

MR. BAILEYs

I’m not prepared to urge upon you that

there are no consequences upon this man that do not give him
standing to raise it.

As I understand State law, there are

certain positions in State Government he probably could not
obtain because of his conviction.

A police officer, for

©scamp le.
Q

Well, you mean even on count one? '

MR. BAILEY3
Q

On count one, well, I’m not sure.

That’s the only one we're talking about.

MR. BAILEYs

Yes.

That’s true

44
Q

Well, are you sure or not?

MR. BAILEYs

Q

18m not positive, no, Your Honor.

In other word3, doesn't whatever disqualification

he has flow from count two, and nothing more from count one?

MR, BAILEY:

I do not know, to be honest, Your Honor.

Let’s go back to the wording of the statute, the
statutory provision at bar.
The Florida statutory provision, the one under
consideration, on its face refers only to the "lawful" versus
the "unlawful"* nature of one’s purpose or object for being
abroad.
It cannot be stated that there is no ascertainable
standard of conduct right on the face of the statute, because,
honestly, there is.

It refers only to the lawfulness or

unlawfulness of the purpose or object for being abroad.
The question was raised whether or not a person would
foe required in Florida to give a satisfactory response to
police officers upon inquiry, under suspicious circumstances.
In Headley v. Selkowits, I believe *65 or 86? opinion of the
Florida Supreme Court, they held unconstitutional a Miami City
ordinance that required a reasonable ■ explanation for suspicious
circumstances to be given to a police officer.
So, under Florida law, there is no requirement that
yon explain the circumstances to a police officer, and there
Coin bs no such requirement.

45
Now, Chief Justice, or rather Justice Ervin of the
Florida Supreme Court, in Johnson v. State, at 202 Sc, 2d,
stated a

The statute does not purport to make it an offense for
■\

a person merely to stroll or loiter about without being able
to explain to the satisfaction of an arresting officer, or a
judge, or a jury, why he was strolling or loitering.
Now, this is the measure of the Florida law.

The

police officer must have probable cause to believe that a
parson is abroad with an unlawful purpose % with a criminal *
intent, in other words.
Q

Well, that’s not the way that language has been

construed by the only court that has construed it* as we're
told* in the intermediate appellate court in Hanks v, State,
which said that "without any lawful purpose or object" simply
meant "without good or sufficient reason". That’s quite
different from saying ran unlawful purpose".
MR. BAILEY:

Yes, that is a substantial difference.

That -Q

That is, it’s not what we take or have to take,

we have no choice but to take the construction of a State
statute given to it by the State courts, as the authoritative
construction.
MR. BAILEY*

Your Honor, the term used there by the

Third District is, in itself, vague.

If the statute said

that, I’d be in a very bad position before this Court.

But

46
the —
Q

Well? the point is —

MR, BAILEY;
Q

-- statute on its face —

—■ but that’s what the statute does say, you

see.
MR, BAILEYi Do they explain what they're talking
about?
Q

They do,

Mil, BAILEY* Well, the statute does,
Q
$

They tell us that’s what the statute says',

MR, BAILEY;

Well, if you're going to take that as

the meaning of the statute, and the only meaning, then I would
be in a very rough position here,
l*m telling you that the statute, right on the face
of it, refers only to the lawful versus the unlawful nature
of the conduct.
Look also at Chief Justice Ervin’s concurring
opinion in the Florida Supreme Court —
Q

In Johnson?

MR. BAILEY %

Right, in Johnson v. State, and I think

you’ll find a; clear indication there that that is not a correct
interpretation.
Also in the instant-case, the Florida Supreme Court
referred to Justice Ervin’s concurring opinion, and said that
it was a well-considered concurring opinion,

t

think this

4?
further indicates that the position taken by Chief Justice
Ervin is the position of the Florid® Supreme Court with
respect to this law. .
That it relates only to unlawful intent for being
abroad.
Now, referring again briefly to proving on©*s
intent.

A man can be convicted for what the state of his mind

is, when he is committing « certain act.

You can convict a

man of breaking and entering with an intent to commit rape.
And his state of mind at the time of breaking and entering is
& condition on fch© basis of his intent#
Q

And 'there are all sort;? of federal criminal laws,

are there not, whore the criminality depends upon a man's
purpose when he travels interstate?
ME. BAILEY*
correct? very correct.

That in correct, Your Honor. That is
His intent at the time of crossing

State lines, and so forth.
Q

Right, yes.

HR. BAILEY*

And it's strictly the state of a man's

mind what .he is thinking, his purpose which supports criminal
conviction.
Q

Right, his purpose or intent.

MR. BAXLEY*

Q

That is correct.

Mr. Bailey, do you know of any case that's made

it a crime for someone to have a mesis ran, period?

48
ME# BAILEYs

No#

In every case? including this oaa,

it takes some act in perpetrationf actually, of that mens raa.
Q

I see.

MR, BAXLEYs

And the act here is walking'?

"

Going abroad, moving from place to

place, that is correct, sir.
Q

Well, yon agree that’s walking?

MR* BAILEY:
0

Among other things e yes.

And certainly a person has the right to walk?

MR, BAILEYs That is true.
Q

And so the crime is really what3s in his mind?

MR. BAILEYs That is correct.
Q

And you see nothing wrong with that?

MR. BAILEY s

I see nothing wrong with that.

If you

can convict him of breaking and entering a house with an intent
to rape, then you also can convict him for walking towards that
house, with that intent, if you can prove your case*
Q

Well, I would submit that committing the crime

of rape is in a different legal status from right to walk down
the street*
MR, BAILEY s

Clearly the crime of rape is in a

different legal status from breaking and entering* also.
Q
the street#

And those are both different fror.3 walking down
Which this man is convicted of,

MR. BAILEYi

He's convicted of walking down the

street with criminal intent.

Thera * a a difference.

I can walk

49
down the street with latent other than criminal,, and I'm doing
nothing of danger to society.
Q

Yes, but some other people can't.

And it's up

to the policeman as to whether he lets you go or arrests the
other person, in the hope that later he can prove what was in
his mind.
MR. BAILEYs

Your Honor ~~

When he arrests him, he doesn't know what's in

his mind, do you agree on that?
MR. BAILEYs

Your Honor, there is nothing in our

statutes that authorises arrest on loss than probable cause.
Other vagrancy statutes, which you have either stricken down or
determined inapplicable in certain situations, authorise arrest
on less than probable cause.

And that was part of the problem

with fehs statutes.
Now, the police officer here must have probable
cause to believe that person is abroad with a criminal intent,
In the Palmer case, Palmer v, Clty of Euclid, you had
a statute which required explanation, reasonable explanation,
to be given to the police officer.

Now, we don't have that

here.
In Headley v. Selkowita, the Florida Supreme Court
specifically said that standard cannot be applied in the
State of Florida*

You cannot require, by statute or ordinance,

that a person give a reasonable explanation to a police officer,

50
So we don't have that problem.
There must be probable cause to support the police
officer’s believing they are abroad with a criminal intent.
It should be noted that the Florida statute does not
relate to loitering in an unusual manner, or it does not
authorize an arrest under unusual circumstances % neither does
it require one to dispel a policeman’s suspicion, even though
his suspicions may bs based upon a reasonable suspicion under
the circumstances.
The Florida vagrancy statute does not allow arrest •
on anything loss than probable cause, and neither does it make
arousing a policeman’s suspicions a crime.
Much of the problem with the vagrancy statute is a
fear by many people and many judges that a law enforcement
officer, when he can’t think of anything to charge a man with,
is just going to say, "You're under arrest for vagrancy."
And there is a fear by many that this will be abused.
It will authorise arrests where there is no proper grounds for
arrest.
Looking at the provision under consideration, not the
rest of the vagrancy statute, but the very provision under
consideration, there is nothing in the wording of that that
authorizes a police officer to arrest you simply because he
can’t think of anything to charge you with.

There’s nothing

there that authorises an arrest on anything less than probable

51
cause? to believe you are abroad with a criminal intent, and
\

he must have knowledge of circumstantial evidence to that
effect.
Unless there are any further questions from the
Court, I -Q

On your — perhaps 1 missed it.

Do you think

your State has the constitutional power to prohibit a person
to be on the street with a — for the wrong reason, or to foa
on the street with, say, a criminal intent?
MR, BAXLEYs

My position is that this is a11 the

wording of this statute authorises, is an arrest whan they
are on the street, going from place to place, with a criminal
intent,
Q

Well, ifct's

MR. BAILEYs
Q

and the State does have that power.

How, even though he hasn't committed any crime

yet, he hasn't attempted to commit any crime yet —
MR. BAILEY?
Q

That’s correct.

—» but he intends to.

Do you think that’s

enough?
MR. BAXLEY %

I think that’s enough.

It’s a very

difficult problem of proof, in many cases, naturally.
Q

Well, I understand that, but what about ~~ do

you think the State’s police power reaches back that far into
the incubation of a crime?

52

MR. BAXLEY 3

Whan a person sets out with the purpose

of committing the crime, yea.
What could be a more appropriate crime prevention
statute?

I used an example in ray brief.

A police officer

is informed that John Smithp let's say, is going to rob a
liquor store,

lie's going to rob it.

he robs it tomorrow night.
"case the joint53.

He's going to armed when

Tonight he's going to go there and

He's not going to do anything, he's just

going to case it, to see how the customers come in. and out,
and set up his robbery.
What is there in constitutional law that should stop
the officer from arresting the man tonight, when he's unarmed,
or wandering and strolling around with an unlawful purpose,
rather than waiting until the man comes armed tomorrow night
and either try to stop him before he gets in, or stop him
when he's in perpetration of 'the act?
Q

Well, this challenge hasn’t been made to this

statute, anyway, has it?

MR. BAILEY %

In this case?

Well, that issue is not raised in the

petitioners' position.
Q

Yes.

MR. BAILEY %

I'm saying there are many positions,

many situations when this is a perfectly proper crime prevention
s t&tute,
Q

Th© only challenge to the statute that's been

53
made in this case is vagueness» i/s that right?
Q

And oVerbre&dth.

Q

.and ©verbreadth.

HR. BAILEY? Well» my position is that he only raised
-die vagueness issue and preserved it for this Court.
How* starting at page 3 of the Appendix to this case»
his oral motion in court refers only to the vagueness of the
statute» not to its overbreadth.

And the trial court made a

written order attempting to put on record this oral motion
and his denial of it.
And 115 s from there that this case comes before this
Court.
How» it's my position that only the vagueness and
not the overbreadth is involved.
Q

But, in that case you just gave, your hypothetical»

is a man about to rob a bank the next day,

MR. BAILEES
Q

Yes» sir.

Terry_y. Ohio says you could arrest him, but

they didn't say you could convict him from being out on the
street.
MR. BAILEYs What would you arrest him for?
Q

For what he was arrest in. Terry» for carrying a

gun.
MR. BAILEY?

No» no» no.

there casing the joint» unarmed.

The night before he is

54
Q

Well, he has a right to question him.

MR. BAXLEY;
Q

That’s all ha has a right to do.

Pat him down,, then.

MR. BAILEY %

And if that police officer is sitting

there, knowing that man is walking around with an intent to
commit that crime -Q

Well, if you say it’s a great prevention of

crime, why not look up all those people?
trials or anything.
MR. BAILEY %
Q

That would prevent it, too, wouldn't it?
Your Honor, —

Put them in a camp soma place.

MR. BAILEY:
Q

And don't give them

Your Honor, —»

2 don’t think you have to go that far to win

your point? that's my view.

X don’t think you have to go that

far,
MR, BAILEY:
Q

At what point --

Your point is that in this statute if the

State can prove that you had the intent, you can get convicted.
That’s all you have to argue.
MR, BAILEY: Well, actually, there are two elements:
they have to prove that he was abroad, going from place to place,
with that intent.
0
abroad?
for him

Well, how could he get arrested unless he was

The police are not going to go in his house and look

55
MR. BAILEYs

Wo.

Well, my point is, if he's sitting

in his house just thinking about it, that’s no crime under
Florid© statutes.
Q

Well, all right, he has to prove he's abroad.

Your argument is if you can prove his intent, then he's
violated the statute? '
MR. BAXLEY;
Q

Under your position.
That's correct.

You don't say you just pick him up on general

princi.pl©®.
MR. BAILEY?
Q

Mo, no.

You're not arguing that, I hop®.

MR. BAILEY?

Mo, and yon can't pick him up just

because of unusual circumstances, either.
Q

That's all I'm saying.

MR, BAILEYt

Okay.

Thank you.

That shall conclude, then.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BORGES?

Thank you, Mr,, Bailey.

Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2s11 p.m., the case was submitted.)
