A parallel

Q.

And you’re also claiming that the union labor

organisation did not compel members to make the contribution
to the

upato organisation?
..A, AHlPEER;

That is correct.

You’ve brought me

right to a very important question that we have here, the
court construction on the question of law that it wasn’t
necessary that a contribution fee voluntary.

In other words,

they said that it didn’t make any difference whether the
contribution was voluntary or not voluntary but in the trial
below, the Listedet Court,so;:.’.chow the government just didn’t

Q

Well, except as 3®p* Justice Brennan has

suggested, v.'hat the statute prohibits is the making of a
vr...hr..ratiov bp a labor organisation and if the contribution
was by the labor organisation, there is a violation, of the
vlrtut© regardless: of rkore those funds of the labor organisa­
tion!: cam iron*

How, if X gave your union $50>000 as a

•present last OIrcietmo, right to the union., it would be a
violation of the statuto to stake a political contribution
with that 150,000, even though my gift was wholly voluntary*
MR. SHENK8R:

and, a:> 1 say, wo don’t have to reach that.

but the people that worked on those jobs, some of them did

that.

Ho, no, they contributed more than

They’d contribute as much as $2 a day ~~ a day.

In

other wordy, a contributor started off at $1 a day and it
finally went to $2 a day*

But it was all voluntary and the

evidence showed that many of them testified that many of
them didn’t contributo at all and it did not affect their jobs

The whole trial was’ based on the question of whether

this was c. bona fide political fund where people were raising

obligations that they thought they had to pay
to bo union, because of the union1 a economic power*

This

was tho whole theory of the case and much of the testimony
looked in this direction.

I*d like» if I may, to refer four
