ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRED 1« PARKER, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OP THE PLAINTIFF
MR. PARKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This original jurisdiction suit is a suit by the
Stata of Vermont against the neighboring State of New York and
against a citizen of that Stata, namely the International Paper
Company*
It is a’controversy over a sludge bed which is sitting
on the bottom, of Lake Champlain, which lies over the interstate
congruent between the two States.
We have alleged in our bill of complaint that that
sludge bed constitutes a public nuisance, that it also
constitutes a continuing trespass because it has encroached
over the State line onto the lands of the State of Vermont.
That it is giving rise to an interstate boundary question,
0

because its presence is causing a shift of the channel in the
direction of the State of Vermont, and that it is depriving
and has deprived Vermont citizens of their right to freely
use Lake Chaplain

4
It is iv:,y inteixti on i '■ spend sofee portion of the
original part of this argument in discussing the facts? which
I think are very important, and a very short time on the legal
issues which 1' think are simple to comprehend, although they
might be difficult to administer.
The States of Vermont and New York? as I said? are
neighboring States,

Lake Champlain lies along the boundary

between the two States,

It is a 107-mile long lake? a very

narrow one? 12 miles wide at its widest point,

And it flows

in a northerly direction.
The situation that we describe,, the sludge bed situa­
tion, is one which exists in the southerly portion of the lake,
almost at whet would be the headwaters if you were viewing
this long lake as a stream,

Q

Would you give me, for my benefit at least? a

little better? more -complete picture of the geography of the
total size of Lake Champlain?

What are its"dimensions?

Yon

said 12 miles at its widest part, is that correct?
MR, PARKER:

Yes? Your Honor.

It's — the length is

107 miles long; 12 miles at its widest part? which is about the
midpoint of that 107-mile stretch? and it narrows down in the
southerly portion? at the. place that wo*re describing? to about
a mile.

And it narrows down in the northerly portion, where it

joins? crosses the Canadian border? to about a mile,

and I’d

say that it fairly regularly narrows? that is, it starts about

s
a mile wide, expands to 12 miles, and then comes back to about
a mil© wide„
Q

Well, I recall that, driving in that part of

the country, it has the characteristics of a river rather than
a lake? but 1 would like to get the true 'picture.

How much of

that total is affected directly by the sludge?
MR*PARKER;

The evidence that was presented in. the

interstate conference that was held on this matter indicated
that the sludgefoed itself was approximately 300 acres, and
that the water that it then affected was about 1600 acres.
Now, at that time there was a continuing discharge
from the International Paper Company plant, which has since
ceased.

And I expect that now the waters being affected are

somewhat less than they were at that time, because of the
discontinuance of the discharge.
At the place where the sludgebed exists, there is a
stream which is coming from New York, Ticonderoga Creek, which
runs between Lake George and runs into Lake Champlain.

And

that stream, while the lake is running in a north-south
direction, water flowing northerly, the stream joins the lake
in a southeasterly direction? so that the waters of the stream
run into the lake and buck the current that exists there in
the lake.

And, as a result of that, the

well, let ma back

up for just a second.
The International Paper Company has been operating a

6
a paper-producing rail! and a pulp mill on Tiecndaroga
Ire? -

to

1

■

■

It has discharged waste

from those papermaking operations for t hat period into the
stream.
The discharges have deposited out along the stream,
and especially at the place where the stream joins the lake
to such a point that it has formed this; luce SGO-ecre sludge-■
bed which consists of organic and inorganic materials that are
in a state of septic decay»
Q

Now, that operation is now finished, is it?

Isn’t that plant now closed?
MR. PARKER:

Yes, Your Honor, it has.

it chut down

partially in December of 1970, after this suit was instituted,
and fully shut down in April of 1971.
Q

But the

And a new plant has been built a few miles away?

MR. PARKER: That’s correct.
Q

Is it on the lake,the new plant?

MR. PARKER?

The new plant is on the lake, and it

contains a treatment system.

At this point in time we haven’t

seen measurable degrading effects from the new plant, although
we are monitoring that situation.
Q

And so, as of now, there's no complaint against

the operation of this new plant?
MR. PARKER? That's correct, Your Honor.
The situation that does exist —

I3 the new plant discharging anything into the

Q
lake?

MR. PARKERJ
from the plant.

Yes, it discharges £ treated effluent

Both the domestic sewage in the plant and the

waste from the papermaking operation are treated and an
effluent is discharged.

We do see some discoloration, bud sc

far we haven't measured detrimental effects.
The sludgebed, however, remains on the bottom of the
lake and it is sitting on land of the State of Hew York.

We

believe that that sludgebed constitutes a continuing nuisance,
in that it will continue• to decay and take oxygen from the
waters? it will continue in its decay to give off gaseous
emissions causing a severe smell in that area; it will continue
to constitute an interference with navigation.

The situation

is there that the sludge! has actually filled in to depths of
12 feet to a point, at low water, in much of that area, you
can *t bring a boat through there.
And the situation has existed for many years that, as
this sludgebed decays, the gases formed in the sludgebed cause
•rage mats of this sludge to rise to the surface and the
prevailing westerly winds cause them to float on the water to
the Vermont shore.

We believe that this condition wiii. continue.

We also believe that there will be a continuing
trespass.

We have measured, using older maps that showed the

midpoint of the deepest channel in the lake, which constitutes»

the boundary.

We find that that de

bans si has bean filled

in, such that the deepest channel now has moved toward the
Vermont shore, and that the sludge sitting there constitutes a
trespass and, in addition, it gives rise to a question of where
the boundary will be.,
The existence of that sludgebed over the years, and
its continued existence in the water, deprives Vermont citizens
of their right to fish in the water; the fish life there has
been seriously depleted by virtue of the oxygen “-robbing qualitie
of the sludge, and —

Q

Is that admitted, Mr. Parker?

MR. PARKER;

It's admitted in part and denied in part.

I think that the posture of
defendants.

I cion81

mean to speak to the

I think the defendants5 posture at this point is

that the continuing effect of the sludgebed will have no
detrimental effect, as I understand their position.
Q

Well, was there some action taken with a gill net

recently, which produced results?
MR. PARKER; As I understand it, the studies of the
defendants in this case indicate that the conditions in that
area have improved, and our own studies indicate that the
conditions have improved greatly since the discharge has
ceased.
But our experts inform us that we can expect a
continuation of the prior circumstances, based upon the fact

9
that the recent studies that were done were dene last summer a
a time whan the water was unusually high down there, and the
temperatures did not rise as much as they have in the past.,
We expect that, given a situation where the water is
lower and gets heated up, as it has in past years, that we*11
return to the situation that existed over the past years, and
probably not as severe because of the discontinuance of the
discharges.
0

Mr. Parker, why can't the State of Vermont get

relief as against International Paper, putting to one side
the question of the State of New York, in their own courts,
for the type of wrong that you *ve just described?
MR. PARKER; Well, if it turns out, in the proof of
this case# that the remedy, the best remedy is removal of the
sludge, then of course we may end up with incomplete relief,
because New York is now taking the position that, to remove the
sludge would constitute a threat to the ecology of the lake.
New York has control over those waters, and New
York owns that land.

I assume that New York could prevent

International Paper Company from removing the sludge from its
land,

ted —
Q

Under the Federal Act, you got as far as the

Attorney General?
MR. PARKER:
Q

No, we didn’t get that far, Your Honor.

How far did you get?

10
MR, PARKER?

We got through two conferences f and a

letter from the Secretary of the Interior suggesting action on
the part of the State of New York.

And then the then Secretar

of Interior Hickel left and then the powers of the Interior
were transferred to SPA, and we have requested action from EPA,
but their response has been negative at this point? we haven’t
seen any action.
Q

Have they declined to act, or just not answered

your inquiry?
MR. PARKER;

We invited them to join this suit, and

they said they were very concerned about it, but didn't care
to act at this point.

And I understand that there — and

attached to the latest brief of the State of New York are
indications that the State has corresponded with EPA,
indicating that their recent studies show that nothing further
should be done.
Q

Well, as 1 read Section 10 of the Federal Act,

subdivision (g) , EPA may request the Attorney General to bring
a suit on behalf of the United States to secure abatement.
MR. PARKERs That's correct, Your Honor.
Q

That's —

There's no — that hasn't been changed to a must,

or — it's purely discretionary?
MR. PARKER;

That’s right.

That’s ths frustrating

business of attempting to deal through these conferences and
with the Federal Government is that we have no way of getting

them to act if they don't care to.
tod 1 have no way of knowing whether the Federal
■
has declined to act.
Q

j : i n or for
But they have not gone forward.

In this respectf Mr. Parker# unlike in the —

what does Vermont feel that Mew York should do that it hasn't
done at this point in the State?
MR. PARKER: We feel that that sludge either should be
removed from the water or should be. covered over so that it
doesn't affect the water quality in the future.
Q

Covered over# the entire 300 acres.

Does the

record show what kind of coverage would be required to be
adequate?
MR. PARKER:

I’m not sure that the record shows, this,

but the federal conferences that were held in this case, the
Corps of Engineers did a study which suggested that a sand
cover could be laid over the sludge.

There's a disadvantage in

that remedy# because we already have a problem with navigation
which of course wouldn't be solved by leaving the sludge there.
Q

Well# that's why I put that question# if you —

I don't know whether it's six inches or six feet of coverage
that would be required; anything you put in would be a further
interference with navigation# unless the interference with
navigation is in such a small part that you could have a
dredging operation first.

MJU PARKER:

Welly I think that's one possibility, is

a combination of the two remedies, to dredge some and to cover
someo

But. 1 think that if this Court does take jurisdiction,

those will bs one of the problems that we'll be trying to work
out in trying this case.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We'll suspend until after

13
AFTERNOON SESSION
[Is00 p.m.]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr. Parker, you may

continue, yon have IS minutes remaining in all.
MR. PARKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
I indicated just prior to recess that we were seeking
as remedies in this case either the removal of the sludgebed
or its covering, whichever seemed most appropriate at the time
when the remedy — when we received the remedy.

And, in

addition, 1 should indicate that we do have a claim in this
bill of complaints for money damages.

,

We have sought, over the years, alternative relief
to litigation.

Early in the I9608s, in. the New England

Interstate Water Pollution Control Compact, the State of Vermont
began negotiations which lasted over & period of ten years
with the State of New York, seeking some remedy of the situation
which existed in Lake Champlain,

ted, as I recited earlier,

under the Federal Water Quality Act we have — there have been
held two Federal conferences at the request of the State of
Vermont„
In the first conference, held in 1968, it was
determined that there was a problem in that area of the lake,
and in between the two conferences studies were conducted by
the Army Corps of Engineers and by the Water Quality Administra-

14
tior*, which studies dealt with the question of how best to
remedy the situation.

One of them concluded that a major

portion of the sludgebed did come from the International Paper
Company plant? the other studies concluded that the best remedy
was cessation of the discharge and removal of the sludge.

And

a technical committee of that conference concluded that .the
continued existence of the sludgebed in the lake would consti­
tute a continuing problem.
The defendants of course disagree with that conclusion
and that points up the reason why we have to litigate this
case.
The legal issues involved, as we see them, the
primary legal issue is whether -•
Q

.

Just before you move to that, do I understand

that the sludgebed is on the bottom of the lake on the New York
side of the boundary? right?
MR. PARKER:
Your Honor.

It is now on both sides of tha-boundary,

It emanates from the New York side, and is spilling

over onto Vermont land.
Q

Yes.

And there’s something in the record to the

effect that it’s been building up over many years, and that
there are other contributors to it in addition to — many other
contributors in addition to the paper company, this paper
company.

Is that — do you find that the paper company is the

sole cause of it?

IS
MR. PARSERS

I don't think that we'll be able to

prove that they are the sole cause,, but they're certainly the
major contributor to it. And I think we can prove that.

The

paper company alleges that others are also involved, but they
don’t set out —
Q

Yes.

MR. PARKER;

the quantities.

The Federal study

done in pursuance of the first conference concluded that the
major source of the bed was from the paper company plant.
Q

And this is way down at the southern tip of the

lake, is it?
MR. PARKER; That’s right, Your Honor.
Q

Down around Fort Henry?

MR. PARKER; South of there, at Ticonderoga.
Q

Ticonderoga is not — is Ticonderoga on the lake?

MR. PARKER:

It’s just off the lake and, yes, the

city of — the Ticonderoga boundary does have land along the
lake.

But the city of Ticonderoga and the place where the mill

is is on Ticonderoga Creek, which is a tributary running into
Lake Champlain.
Q

How far from the lake?

MR. PARKER:
Q

About a mile, 1 believe.

Thank you.

MR. PARKER: As we see it, the major legal issue is
whether jurisdiction is exclusive in this Court, and contributing

16
to the —- to that Issue is whether we hav e an alternative forum
or whether the principles of Ohio vs, Wyandotte apply»

In

addition, there is the legal question, :just recently briefed,
asked by the Court as to what law applies.
Wa think all of those legal issues turn on and are
controlled by the question of whether*Mew York is properly a
party to this complaint.

The defendants’ claim that wa are

simply alleging maladministration of New York law in failing
to control this situation over the years.

That is not the cast•

If we were to assume that there were no New York laws
on this subject, we would still have a situation existing where
the sludgebed lies on New York land. And New York has control
over that land and over that situation.

They are permitting

and have permitted over the years the continuation of a nuisance
which is causing us harm,

tod we think that once that question

is resolved then the others fall into line.

The jurisdiction

is exclusive in this —
Q

What is your cause of action against New York?

MR. PARKERs

Maintenance of a public nuisance, Your

Honor.
Q

You're saying New York is doing that?

MR. PARKER; That's correct.
Q

By permitting the sludge to accumulate on its

lake bottom?
MR. PARKERs That's correct.

On its property.

I?
Q

That's a Federal common law in this?

MR. PARKERs

Yes, if we litigate for this Court, it

will be a question of Federal common law.

And that’s the

position that we took in the recently submitted memorandum.
Q

Could you get into a Federal District Court?

MR. PARKER;

I don’t think we; can, because the State

of Vermont is not a citizen for purposes of diversity. And
the - both the 28 0. S. Code, Section 1251, provides that this
forum is the exclusive forum where we can litigate State versus
State.

So that so long as New York is a party to this

litigation, this is the only place that we can bring the suit.
Q

Well, if it is a Federal, if we just assume,

for purposes of argument, that it is a federal common-law
nuisance, could you litigate in the District Court?
MR. PARKER;

I don’t think ~ as I understand the

law, the District Court does not have jurisdiction to permit a
suit between States.
Q

But you’ve got two suits here;

you’ve got

one against International Paper Company and one against the
Stats.

I mean, at least you’ve got two parties.
MR. PARKER;
Q

Yes, Your Honor, and —

And you are -~

MR. PARKER;

— we are viewing them as joint

tort-feasors,
Q

You would agree that you could litigate against

18
the International Paper Company in the District -Court?
MR,PARKERs
Q

Yes, Your Honor, we could.

And the Federal law would control it?

1£ you5 re right.
MR,. PARKER: Well, I think that — that’s the problem,
if we conclude that State versus State, we look to federal
common law in this Court; and if we treat this as a case of
joint tort-feasors, both litigated here, then X think that this
Court would apply federal common law against both defendants.
Q

Let’s.assume you hadn'fc named Hew York at all.

And you sued them in the Federal District. Court, sued Inter­
national Paper in the Federal District Court.
MR. PARKER?
Q

Yes, Your Honor,

You would be asking for the application of the

same law that you would be asking here? correct?
MR. PARKER:

I don’t think so, Your Honor.

I think

at that point, then, the substantive lax* which controls would
be State law.
Q

Well, why is that?

MR. PARKER; The choice of law rules would have to
apply»
Q

Why is that?
MR. PARKER:

Erie Railroad vs. Tompkins.

Q

All right.

Q

That's a diversity case.

By definition, you said

19
the Stats is not a citizen of another State? it wouldn*t and
couldn't be e diversity case.

And the Erie Railroad rule is

applicable to diversity cases.
MR. PARKERS

Well. 1 was assuming — 1 think it

would have to be a diversity case in order to get there, and
that's why we can't go there.
Q

Why , you would be --

q

Well, that presupposes a decision by this Court

that you would — that you are governed by the federal common
law nuisance.

And we've never so held. Have we?

MR. PARKER;

In cases involving State versus other

States, the Court has consistently held that —
Q

Plight.

MR. PARKER:

— these kind of cases are governed by

interstate common law or federal common law nuisance.

In suits

between States and citizens of ther States, when a State was
not involved, to me the law is unclear.

I can't find any clear

holdings of the Court.
Q

Well, what would you say if you were suing

International Paper alone in this Court, and, surely, that
would be a case within our jurisdiction? and you were claiming
that this sludgebed was a nuisance.
MR. PARKER:
Q

Yes.

You would be asking for the invocation of

federal law, wouldn't you?

MR. PARKERt
Q

1 would be, yes.

But 1 would

Why would you think that any different law would

apply if you were suing in the Federal District Court, which
has concurrent jurisdiction in that kind of a case?
MR. PARKER:

Because,, as I understand it — well,

the only way I could understand to get into a Federal District
Court
Q

You’re asking for a federal — you’re just suing

on a federal questionr as a matter of federal law.
MR, PARKERs

I had never understood that to be the

case.
Q

Well, of course, it hasn't really been decided.
?

Are you acquainted with the Pancke case from the Tenth Circuit?
MR, PARKERs

Yes, I am acquainted with it. Your Honor.

2 don't fully understand it.
Q

1 guess that's a safe assertion.

MR. PARKERi
Q

It seems to stand alone in **-

Yes.

Well, let's assume that in — you’re suing in

this Court International Paper Company alone,, and this Court
decided federal law applies.

And then in an identical suit

on the facts, between a State and another company, the suit is
brought in the Federal District Court.

Wouldn't you think the

same law would apply?
MR. PARKER:

I think if I were plaintiff in that

suit in the Federal Court, I would urge that was the case? but

21
I don't find that to be the law at this point in time.

1*m

afraid that the Federal District Court wouldn't let you
litigate, and therefore you'd foe without a forum.

You'd end

up in State Court in your own State
Q

But they didn't

MR. PARKER:

in Pancke, did they?

Yes, they did, Your Honor. And that's

the only one, so far as I know.
Q

Well, it's the only way — there isn’t anything

against it, either, is there?
MR. PARKER;
Q

1 would -~

Mo, there are no holdings on —

Well, the only authority there is Paneke,is that

it?
MR. PARKER; That’s correct.
Q

What did Wyandotte have to say on the subject,

if anything?
MR. PARKER: Well, as I understand Wyandotte, that
case said go back to the State Court.

It did not direct the

plaintiff in that case to go to the Federal District Court.,
Q

But perhaps that's explanable on the basis that

the court understood that the State of Ohio was asserting an
Ohio causa of action under the Ohio nuisance law.
MR. PARKER; That's possibly the case.

And we may

have there here in this case, if this Court does not take
jurisdiction, wa may very well end up back in a State Court
in Vermont. But in that case we'd only be against International

Paper Company, and 1 don't believe that we could get complete
relief»
And that is ray argument.
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr» Parker.

Mr» Weinberg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP WEINBERG, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF DEFENDANT STATE OF NEW YORK
MR. WEINBERGs

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
To accept this case would be to undercut precisely
what this Court held in Wyandotte, where the relief sought by
the plaintiff was virtually identical? namely, an injunction
against the alleged pollution of water of an interstate lake
and damages therefor.
And it seems to us that Wyandotte is completely
dispositive here, the Court there properly held that in a ease
such as that involving complex issues of fact and bottomed of.
local law, in which the factual questions were sharply
contested, and in which, in this Court's phrase, novel scienti­
fic issues were involved, that, although concededly there was
jurisdiction in this Court, it was precisely the sort of
question that the Court should not get entangled in.
Q
there not?

There's one very great big different, though, is
Jh Wyandotte there was no State who was a defendant.

It was not a controversy between two States,

Therefore, this

Court, while jurisdiction existed in this Court, it was not
exclusive jurisdiction.

A controversy between two States is

exclusively within this Court’s jurisdiction, is it not?
MS. WEINBERGS

It certainly is, Mr. Justice Stewart,

and it's precisely our point, that there is no genuine
controversy between two States here.
Q

Well, that is a separate point, but this — that,

on its race, is what differentiates this case from Wyandotte,
among others.
MR. WEINBERGs
Q

That's certainly true.

Yes.

MR. WEINBERGs

Once we go beyond the surface

representation that two States are involved and look at the
realities of the case, however, that, it seems to me, just falls
apart because, in fact, New York was injected -— X don't want
to characterise why New York was injectedi but certainly the
only reason for the presence of New York here is to obtain
some sort of a possible jurisdiction in this Court, when, in
fact, everything that Vermont wants they want from International
Paper.
It’s conceded on this record here that New York
didn't contribute one scintilla of pollution to the lake;
New York had no mere to do with creating this slu&gebed than
China did. And that's beyond dispute.

The sludgebad was

created by International Paper and perhaps by other private

24
parties as well.
Q

Except China had no authority to made Inter­

national stop?
MR, WEINBERGs

That's certainly true# Mr. Justice

Marshal1.
Q

There’s an assumption, though# in what I read

in the quote from page 3 of your brief#from Wyandotte#that
the State Court would decide the case under the same common
law of nuisance on which our determination has to rest,

That

wouldn’t be true if this is a federal common law nuisance#
would it?
MR,. WEINBERG %

It would only be a federal common law

of nuisance case# under our view of the law, if the State were
a proper party, and if the genuine claim for relief existed
as against New York.
Now# the answer, it seems to me, is that in contrast to
other situations, such as the previous case that was argued
this morning involving Milwaukee, New York has been more :han
diligent, it's actually been aggressive in dealing with this
problem.

We force International Paper to clean up the

pollution that it'was causing in Lake Champlain.
to court. The case is cited in our original brief.

We took them
We obtained

a consent decree, consent judgment of injunction directing
International Paper to cease its active pollution, arid it’s
conceded now that there is no longer any active pollution from

25
this source at all,
And following that, we represented to the enforcement
conference, at which Vermont;, .Hew York.,
were all parties.

the Federal agencies

We represented to them that we would take

whatever steps were necessary or appropriate to abate the
pollution caused by the sludge bed.

And pursuant to that v?e

entered into a pilot study in which Vermont originally
participated prior to their kicking over the traces and,
subsequent to that, a study in which New York engaged a highly
respected, independent consultant. And the conclusion based
on that study, which has never been controverted by anyone
except by Vermont in this lawsuit, not by any Federal agency,
not by any New York agency, and not by anyone else except
Vermont, was that the pollution, the active pollution had now
completely ceased, that whatever damage the sludgebed was
causing was case to the active pollution of the lake, and that,
in fact, the problem was dissipating and the sludgebed itself
was stabilising.
The report, a copy of the summary of which is appended
to our supplemental brief, plainly indicates that fish are now
returning to that portion of the lake, and that of the various
alternatives, by far the safest one, by far the most practical,
and by far the most realist!cal from an envlfonm®h£al standpoint,
is to simply leave the sludgebed alone.

Because what’s

happening now is a natural process of stabilisation, under

which fish and other marine life are returning to the lake;
the pieces of mat and so on, and the babbling which are
complained of
Q

—
That really goes to the merits of the municipal

remedy, doesn’t it?
MR. WEINBERGs

Yes, sir, it does. But it's simply

unavoidable to discuss it, it seems to me, in the context of,
as this Court said in Wyandotte, whether in prudence or in
discretion it ought to accept this ease,
Q

Well, Mr. Weinberg, doesn’t it also go to why

Hew York may be — Hew York State may be a necessary party?
This sludgebed is largely on the subsurface of the lake on the
Mew York side of the line, and it's Vermont’s contention that
the 'way to abate this nuisance and get rid of it is to remove
the sludgebed. ted New York strenuously says:

Mo, that’s

absolutely the wrong thing to do.
So if the Court should order the paper company to
remove the sludgebed, and then Hew York would just step in and
say, I’m sorry, we enjoin you from removing this sludgebed? it*
on our territory.
Isn’t that a reason why New York is a necessary
party, to clean up these factual issues

in this litigation?

To negotiate the remedy,
MR, WEINBERG?

The first answer to that, it seems to

me, Mr. Justice Stewart, is that these are issues which the

State Court or perhaps even the Federal District Court could
address itself to.

And if'International Paper ware ordered by

the State Court of either Vermont or New York to remove the
sludgebed, then at that point it would be under an injunction,
and it would have to do so.

And if New York wanted to step

in, New York could do so in its courts.
Q

It could enjoin the removal of this sludgebed?

MR. WEINBERG:

Well, it could, and that question

would then be litigated in the State Court —
Q

Where?

MR. WEINBERG:

— of either Vermont or New York,

that's one answer to it.
A second answer to it is that Vermont alleges in its
own complaint that part of the sludgebed is on its own
territory.

Now, Vermont has had as much to do with putting

that sludgebed there as New York did.* namely, nothing.
Q

Perhaps you didn't understand me.

1 was addressing

myself to the -**- questioning the reason why New York State
might be a necessary party as of course it could not be in
either a State or Federal Court, except for this Court.

Is

that right?
MR. WEINBERG:

That's certainly true.

But it's highly speculative, I think, to assume that
New York would, attempt to block an injunction if Vermont could
obtain one in its own courts or in New York State Courts.

28
Q

You certainly strenuously assart in your brief,

and you3ve just begun now to assert orally, that the removal of
the sludgebed is exactly what would be the wrong thing to do»
MR. WEINBERG;

Yes, but this is something that could

be litigated as between Vermont and International Paper in the
State Courts.

&\id if New York wanted to become a party, New

York could certainly be free to intervene, as New York has
done as a plaintiff or a defendant in numerous occasions in
its own courts; and I don't see any reason why it couldn’t do
it in the Vermont courts as well.

?
It seems conceivable under Texas v. Pancke that there
is some sort of federal cause of action here.

In any event,

there are certainly two and possibly three forums where all
these difficult factual questions could be resolved.

*

And if

New York wanted to -Q

But not with New York as a defendant?

MB, WEINBERG;

No* but there’s no ■— I don’t see the

reason for making New York a defendant here, when —
Q

Well, I just suggested a possibility.

MR, WEINBERG;

If New York wanted to interpose,

assuming that an injunction were granted, a mandatory
injunction requiring the sludgebed to’be removed, if at that
point New York elected to step into the case, it could move
to intervene.

And if it didn’t, then it would have waived

whatever objection"' is has ,

29
So it seems to me that that's not a reason for having
this Court hear the case in the first instance#
0

Well, Mr. Weinberg, does New York concede that

if Vermont sued International Paper either in the Federal Court
in Vermont or in the State Court

Xn

Vermont, without New York

being a party or an intervenor, and Vermont got a decree of
final relief calling for the abatement of the sludgefoed, that
the State of New York would bs bound by that decree so that if
couldn't interfere with carrying it out?
MR. WEINBSRGs

In situations like that,Mr, Justice

Rehnquist, which I personally have been involved in, New York
has simply executed a consent under which the private partycan remove whatever it- is.

We had a case like that involving

pollution of the Hudson by the Marathon Battery Company.
The case was heard in the Southern District Court.
brought by the United States Attorney.

It was

New York was made a

party defendant solely to that purpose, or intervened, I
believe it was, solely to that purpose, and we simply executed
a consent permitting the defendant, under the consent decree,
to go on the underwater land and remove what was allegedly
causing the disturbance.
I think the point to remember here in regard-to all
of this is that whan one talks about a State owning underwater
land or owning the water of a lake, any water pollution, whefche
it's don© by a municipality or by any sort of an industry,

30

could be with the same logic that Vermont is asserting here* be

blarasa on the State, just as Ohio sued the Wyandotte Chemical
Company and the other defendants in that case, it could have
sued the State of Michigan or the Province of Ontario?, if it
wanted to, using the same logic, that they were depositing
toxic material into Lake Erie and that, consequently, it was
the responsibility of the State»
And had that happened, we would have had the same
situation we have here; namely, the spurious injection of the
State in order to provide some sort of a bootstrap jurisdiction
for this Court'which, in fact, is improper.
And every one of the reasons why this Court, in the
exercise of its prudence and discretion, rejected the suit
in Ohio v. Wyandotte are applicable here.
There are many State bodies, including the Potomac
right here, as well as all of the Great Lakes, the Hudson
River, the Delaware River, and others, where the same sort of
logic would apply.

Obviously, all the lands on one side or

the other of those interstate boundaries, the underwater land
is owned by one State or the other.
And using the reasoning which Vermont is using here,
you could name the State as a, party defendant and have any on®
of those plethora of cases litigated in this Court.
How, in contrast to what we heard earlier in Case Ho.
49, where there was a history of, I believe itSs fair to say,

31
failure to grapple with serious pollution problems in Lake
Michigan on the part of the municipal authorities there, Sew
York has aggressively acted and,, as I indicated, took the State
of Vermont — took the International Paper Company to court.
Thereafter we had the study, the summary of which is
appended to my brief, and, with the Court's permission, I’d
like to hand up, by giving to the Clerk, at the conclusion of
my argument, a copy of the full report,
Vermont attempted to steer around the Wyandotte ease,
saying, in effect, that it is clear that the sludgebad must be
removed.

But, in fact, no agency with jurisdiction over the

sludgebed has ever said so.

The Army Engineers has plenary

jurisdiction over the State waters, navigable waters, and they
have never so much as suggested that it was any interference
with what little navigation may exist on this part of the lake.
New York has been in constant communication with the Department
of the Interior, and after that with the EPA.
There is a letter from New York State.' s

Commissioner

Diamond to Secretary Hickel, annexed to International Paper's
first brief? there’s a subsequent latter to Mr. Ruckelhaus.
Thera was never any reply to any of those letters, which
indicated the slightest displeasure on the part of the federal
authorities of the course that New York's been taking, and
New York has kept them apprised continually.

There just isn’t

t he problem here that Vermont insists there is.

32
q

I understood the Corps of Engineers has authority

only over permits to make new discharges into navigable waters»
That’s from a rather recent inquiry of them.
MR, WEINBERG:

Yes, sir. But they certainly have

authority to abate any impediments in navigation, such as
Vermont alleges there is there.

But their objection doesn’t run to navigation,

ME. WEINBERGs
certainly alleges both.

Well, I don’t want — Vermont
We submit that there's no merit to

33
either claim. , And in direct contrast to every other pollution
case this Court has ever accepted, including Georgia v.
Tennessee Copper, and Michigan v. Illinois;, and all the rest,
where there were the most serious dangers of epidemic and largescale pollution of interstate waters and so on, there*s nothing
of the sort involved here.
What we have here is a sludgebed which is rapidly
stabilising itself in any event, which is only less than a
half a square mile in else, and in fact there's an existing
suit, which is referred to in our brief, —
Q

You make it sound that, in practice,every State

should have one.
[Laughter.1
MR. WEINBERG;

I'm not suggesting that it’s attrac­

tive, I’m simply suggesting that there’s nothing to the
massive course of action here that Vermont insists there is.
And that we have to put the case in its proper context, in
contrast to Georgia v. Tennessee Copper and other cases, nearly
all of which, in any event, antedated the whole arsenal of
statutory remedies which are available in a situation like this.
Any water pollution, by definition, that’s in an
interstate body of water is on some State’s underwater lands,
and if there is any sort of sediment or anything, that is
going to fall on lands owned by one State or the other. And
to hold that this Court had jurisdiction solely on that basis

34
would be to effectively overrule Wyandotte in any case involving
an interstate body of water, and to simply permit the plaintiff
State to elect to name the other State which it. shares the body
of water with as a party defendant.
And for these reasons we maintain that Vermont has
an cample forum in the courts of either State, and its motion
for leave to file this complaint should be denied.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, Mr. Weinberg.

Mr. Whipple.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TAGGART WHIPPLE, ESQ.,
' OK BEHALF OF DEFENDANT INTERNATIONAL PAPER CO.
MR. WHIPPLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court s
I represent, International Paper Company.

Our

position in this litigation is, 1511 say at the outset, three­
fold.
We agree with Vermont that the complaint does not
state a real justiciable claim against the State of New York,,
Secondly, that this Court should refuse to exercise
jurisdiction, as it did in Wyandotte.
And thirdly, that as far as governing law goes,
the governing law in the State of Vermont*s claim against New
York is federal law? but, as far as Vermont's claim against
the International Paper Company goes, it should be State law.
Before 1 get into the law, l*d like to perhaps

amplify slightly on some of the factual questions that were
asked this morning.
With respect to your question, Mr. Chief Justice,
about the area involved and so on.

I've visited the area, I've

tramped through the two mills, one of which is closed and the
new mill which is now open.

I think you should try to visualise

this part of the lake as & very narrow, almost like the
closing mouth of a funnel.

If you fly over the latter part of

the lake, you will see that the latter part of the lake,
Including Ticonderoga and Crown Point, is muddy throughout.
As the lake broadens, it gets to be clear and much different.
The sludgebed itself, which, lies at the mouth of
Ticonderoga Creek, which empties into Lake Champlain, covers
some 300 acres.

Seme of it is covered by marsh grass.

In.

fact, it amused me when I was there to see that one of the
colored postcards that's sold, at Fort Ticonderoga shows the
view over the sludgebed.

So there's no aesthetically difficult

proposition hare.
The area involved, in contrast to the whole area of
Lake Champlain is a very limited area, indeed.
Finally, Mr. Justice Stewart and, I believe, Mr.
Justice Blackmun talked about the new mill.

I'd like to say

a word about that.
The paper company has long been concerned about; the
discharge problem in the old mill*

Over five years ago it

36
planned this h&w mill.

It cost $76 million.

It contains the

most modern water treatment facilities that were availabler
which cost between three and four million dollars.

And the

State of Vermont said this morning there5 s no problem about
the discharges from that mill.
In fact, you can drink the water when it comes o
those treatment facilities? and people have done it.
As to fish life, which is a legitimate ecological
concern, we disagree with the statement this morning by Mr.
Parker, that while fish life has improved substantially since
the discharge has stopped from the old mill, as they did
complete in April 1971, that there9s going to be a reversion
to a minor and poor fish life.

In fact it's not true, as I

understand it, that conditions this summer, when the tests
were conducted by a firm of consultants were unusually favorable.
The temperature of the water rose to high levels
sooner than it normally did, and stayed there for a longer time.
1 want to emphasize what Mr, Weinberg said.

There

is a long-standing dispute as to the best way to deal with
this debt.

Mr. Chief Justice, you mentioned the possibility

of covering it.

There are at least three possibilitiess

one is to leave it hwere it is, cover it or not in some way?
the second is to remove it, and if you remove it, what happens?
1 want you to visualize this bed as a light and feathery
substance, as Mr. Diamond's letter to Mr. Ruckelhaus, attached

37
to the Blew York State’s supplemental brief, points out.
not a thick, heavy bed.

It’s

hay attempt to dredge and remove this

operation, we are told, would destroy the ecological balance
of the lake in a most harmful fashion, indeed.
And there8s another question, too*,

if you remove

it, where do you put it, and what happens?
Certainly it would have to be removed to some place
fairly near the lake, and if it were done, the best evidence
from the scientists is that a lot of it will leash back into
the lake.

So removal does not seem to foe a realistic alternative.
Wow, as to the law, I don’t mean to add anything, I

think, to Mr. Weinberg’s position, which is basically that
the complaint states a cause of action for maladministration
against New York of its own laws.
However, as to whether this Court should exercise
the jurisdiction, we don’t dispute the Court has “jurisdiction.
We contend that reasons of policy and principle militate aguiue».<
the exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction.
Even insofar as Vermont's claim against New York is
concerned, the State against State claim, the way the law has
developed, as w© understand it, even though the jurisdiction
was given to this Court of State against State cases is
exclusive, it is not mandatory.

In many cases this Court has

refused to exercise jurisdiction for strong and compelling
reasons ©f policy»

38
la Wyandotte, while that was a State against citise»
case,- and obviously wa are distinct here in the sens2 that Slew
York is a party as well as the paper company, we contend that
the same considerations which militated against the exercise
of this Court's jurisdiction in Wyandotte should lead this
Court to refuse to exercise jurisdiction her®.
These factors are familiar , but I would like to just
recite them in relation to the facts of our case.
la Wyandotte, the Court pointed out that the Court
would be plunged into a morass of novel, difficult, scientific,
technical problems.

The existence and the manner of treating

this sludyefeed, sc- far as we know, are entirely novel.

That

is why we tried to get the best engineering experts - we could
last summer to lock at it, and advise us and advise the State
of New York as well what ought to be done about it.
The mere differences that have come out this rooming
between Mr. Parker * s statement and Mr, Weinberg's illustrate
and underline the difficulty of these problems.
I think it's beyond any argument that if this Court,
were to take the case, the master would be plunged into an
extremely difficult problem of fact-finding and recommending.
And 1 don't think, as Vermont might suggest later on, to say
that £ master can do it all, because, as we understand it,
ever, after the roaster does it, as Mr. Justice Stone pointed
out in Georgia v« Pennsylvanias

Thors still remains in this

39
Court the duty of independently examining the evidence itself.
Moreover s it seems to us that, the Court would be
entering into an area that Congress has expressly refused to
pre-empt and* rather* has left to the States.

The policy

course we think would be great if this Court ware to bs drawn
off into the morass of tort litigation arising from water
pollution at the expense of its ability to deal with the everbroadening range of problems - that come before this Court in
massive numbers and are federally oriented.
If you were to take this case* it’s difficult for us
to see how you could pick and choose between other pollution
cases which would be sure to come here* and with the
environmental concerns that surround the country now* we
think it's inevitable they would coxae here? we therefore
suggest this case should be resolved at the lower level.
We suggest that the proper course of action is for
the Court to refuse to take this case, and to remit Vermont
to the type of procedure that the Court has said again and.
again should prevail in these matters* and that is conference*
concessions* cooperation at the lower level* where these
things could and should bs resolved.
Q

Mr. Whipple.

MR. WHIPPLEs
Q

Yes* sir.

Do you concede that International Paper is

amenable to service of process in Vermont?

5

40
MR, WHIPPLE;

We. contend. Your Honor, and I was just

about to get to that, that we are suable In Vermont, we5re
suable in New York, we're ready to stand suit there, there's
no question about that.

This is the really available alternative

that the State of Vermont has against us insofar as remedy gees.
There's no doubt about that.
And I'll put to one side for a moment, but 1 want to
just avert to it. in a word;

the availability of the administra­

tive remedies which we contend Vermont has failed to exhaust,
and I would suggest to this Court respectfully that in
deciding whether to escercise the Court's discretion to take a
case of this nature, one should look long and hard to the
question as to whether the State that brings the case or seeks
to bring the case here has in fact exhausted its administra­
tive remedies in the circumstances,
Q

Isn't that a sort of a primary jurisdiction

argument, or —
MR, WHIPPLE;

Well, I don’t know, I would characterise

it as an exhaustion of administrative remedies, Mr. Justice
Stewart.

I think you could call it primary jurisdiction, toes.

It might be both. They might well be.
But my point here is I don’t think that the State
should corae in here and call upon the really extraordinary
remedy of original jurisdiction, which this Court has said time
and again should be sparingly exercised, and. only in unusual

41
circumstances, when it is refused,

that the State of Vermont

refused in the fall ©f 1970 to proceed with engineering studies
which Mr* Weinberg related to the Court, the door was slammed?
and it seems to me an anomaly for a State to stand before
this Court and try to try to invoke the original jurisdiction
which should be sparingly exercised, and which, when it8s been
called into play in water pollution cases, has raised a host
of difficulties.
Mr. Justice Holmes spoke about this as early as
1900, 72 years ago.

And it's certainly not any easier today

than it was then.
So 1 would suggest that an element, and a strong
element, in this Court's discretion should be not only the
availability of' alternative litigating forum, and we are
subject to suits in Vermont.

We never have questioned it.

Also in Mew York.
But also that the State has mads a positive and a
genuine effort to exhaust their administrative remedies.
And I contrast this case against soma other cases
argued here this morning.

MR. WHIPPLE:

No, I don’t.

I thought about that a

good deal, and I’ve looked at some of your decisions, and you
talked about the DaSilva yesterday, and in Commissioner ?, Steam
which is not cited in our brief, at 3S7 U.S., this Court stated:
Uniformity is not always the policy.
And it pointed out, in the Bankruptcy Act for example,
the validity of a transfer of property in Florida v«. Creditors
is governed by the laws of the State, and it added that
could have 50 different laws governing.

X

don’t see a real inconsistency.

1 will admit,

when I first thought about this case, the notion of a uniform
federal common law, blanketing all the rivers in the country,
seemed appealing. But X think when you think about it, and
you realise that what this Court would be doing would be
evolving a new federal common law and laying a tier of new
federal common law nuisance on top of the existing State laws,
tha result would be not to hinder and help this pressing problem
of pollution that ride® the back of the country, but it would
be years before people could know what the federal common law

Company in this case.
The discharges into Lake Champlain occurred for 45
years.

For many» many years there ware no suits whatsoever.
It was several years after Vermont began pushing

New York before any litigation was initiated» and never before
was any litigation ever sought of preliminary inji \ ki
In fact» what happened in each case was that International
Paper Company would come forward with its schedule :s to
abatement» and Hew York would agree with it,

And that there

were delays and there were numerous changes of deadlines until
such time as the paper company finally did construct and begin
operation in its new mill, at which point the question of
lawsuit became moot.

Unless there are some quasi:ions» I have nothing
further.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
