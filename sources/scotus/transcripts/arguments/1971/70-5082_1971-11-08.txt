ORAL ARGUMENT OF JON D. NOLAND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TUB APPELLANTS
MR. NOLANDs

Mr. Chief Justice» and may it pleas© fch©

Court?
This case is here on direct appeal from a judgment
of a three-judge District Court for the Southern District of
Indiana, -which dismissed appellants8 complaint for failure of
federal j urisdiction.
Th©

issues involved &re jurisdictional questions

pertaining both to the jurisdiction of this court to hear the
appeal under Section 1253 of the Judicial Code and to the
jurisdiction of the three-judge district court*
Th© plaintiffs in this action were mothers of
dependent children who, at the time of filing their complaint
in th© district court, had been denied either the right to file
an application for Aid to Families with Dependent Children or
had been denied assistance under that progr«am.
Th© jurisdiction below was founded on Sections
1343 (3) and (4) of th© United States Code, and fch© action was
brought under Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871.
Plaintiffs brought the action on their own behalf and

4
as a class action on behalf of other mothers similarly
situated»

The Social Security Act defines a dependent child as
a needy child who has been deprived of parental car© or support
by reason of the continued absence from the home of a parent»
Plaintiffs allege that they were entitled to assistance
under this provision because their husbands and .the fathers of
their children had deserted the home.
Plaintiffs also alleged in their complaint that aid
under this provision was denied pursuant to Indiana Regulation
2-402(b), which is set forth at the bottom of page 5 of
Appellants Brief»

This regulation states?

"When the continued absence is due to desertion or
separation, the absence shall have been continuous for a period

of at least six months prior to the date of application for
assistance .*. except that under exceptional circumstances of
need and where it is determined that the absence of a parent is
actual snd bona fide an application may be filed and a child
may be considered immediately eligible upon a special finding
©£ the county department of ... welfare .»."

h three-judge court was convened to hear the
plaintiffs5 allegations that this regulation was not only
unconstitutional but was also contrary to the provisions ©£
the Social Security Act.
Q

Is -this a class action?

.

MR. NOLAND;

Yes* it was brought as a class action*

Your Honor.
• Q

The class being parento whose spouses had

been absent for six months or more?
MR. NOLAND; That is right.

Mothars who had been

denied welfare benefits under this regulation because the
husbands had not been away from the horn® for a period of six
months.
Following th© convening of fcha three-judge court*
each of th© two appellees* -the county department of public
welfare and th® State department of public welfare, filed
motions to dismiss the complaint.
primarily upon two grounds;

These motions were based

on©* & failure on fell© part of

the plaintiffs to exhaust their State administrativa remedies;
and* secondly* th© failure of th® complaint to raise substantial
constitutional questions.
The three-judge panel then convened a combined hearing,
both on the motions to dismiss and on the merits of the case.
Evidence was heard from approximately 16 witnesses, and at that
point the court adjourned the hearing and granted the motions
to dismiss.
Th© court's entry appears at page 210 of the Appendix,
and on page 212 of th© entry, th® entry demonstrates that th©
decision of the court was based (1) upon th© court's finding
that each of th© plaintiffs had failed to exhaust her State

6
administrative remedies; and, secondly, the court held;

Wa

have examined the pleadings before us and find no substantial
federal question involved, nor do w@ find federal jurisdiction
under 28 U.S*C. Sections 1343(3} and (4)*
xfc is apparent to the appellants from this entry
•’chat the district court resolved none of the conflicts in
testimony which became evident during the course of the hearing»
Rather, it mad© its sole finding that the plaintiffs had failed
to exhaust State administrative remedies and then, on the
basis of the pleadings, and solely on the basis of the pleadings,
it found that no substantial federal questions war© presented
for decision»
Before turning to the correctness of the decision of
the district court, the appellee, the State department of public
welfare, has raised a threshold question in this case pertaining
to this Court's jurisdiction under Section 1253 of the Judicial
Coae»

As we understand the argument, the appellee's contention

is that in failing to find substantial federal questions the
three-judge panel, in effect, dissolved itself, and that
therefore -the final entry should be construed as having been
the decision of a single district judge.
In support of that position, the appellee relies
primarily upon two per curiam

decisions of this Court,

Mengelkoch vs. Wilson — Mengelkoch _ vs. Indus trial Me1fare
Commission and Wilson vs* Port Lavaca

?
Without repeating all of the argument set forth in
Appellants Reply Brief, v/e believe that this case is
significantly different from those decisions, in that here
there was no express finding by the three-judge panel that it
had been improperly convened,.

The final decision* in fact, was

entered by all three judges»
In addition, it is apparent from the entry that, in
large part, the decision of the district court was based upon
a failure to exhaust State administrative remedies.

And as we

read this Court's decision in Idlewild biguor Corporation vs.
Bpstain, that ia a consideration which could be properly made
only by the three-judge court and not by a single district
j udge.
Furthermore, tha court here convened a hearing on the
merits as well as on tha motion to dismiss, and took
extensive evidence from approximately 16 witnesses.

Again

we submit that this is a procedure which could be followed only
by the three-judge court.
Q

Couldn't that also mean that having heard 16

witnesses, conceivably they considered that there was no
problem for a three-judge court?

I ha not suggesting it. was,

but could that not also be an explanation?
MR. NOLAND;

It's certainly conceivable, Mr. Chief

Justice, that the three-judge panel could have heard witnesses
and decided on the basis of the testimony adduced that the

8
complaint failed to raise substantial constitutional questions
and dissolved, itself, and then left tho final judgment for a
single district judge.
By not doing so, we believe the district court here
recognized the fact that it was not making a determination
within the meaning of, for example, I'x parte Poresky, that the
complaint failed to raise substantial constitutional questions%
but made that decision on the basis of a finding of a failure
to exhaust State administrative remedies.
We submit that what has happened here is the district
court aas taken this Court’s decision in King vs. Smith and
turned the. formula around and said, in this case substantial
constitutional questions are not raised because there was a
failure to exhaust State administrative remedies.
And we s12bm.it that that is a determination which could
be made only by the three-judge court:.
In support of appellants* position cm this point,
we believe the recent decision of this Court, on October 12th
of this year, in the case of Hicks vs. Pleasure House, Inc., is
instructive.

For in that decision the Court: characterized the

Wilson decision and the Mengaikoch decision as holding that
an appeal may lie to a court of appeals from certain action of
a single district judge in a case required to be heard by
three judges; and again here we hav© no action of a single
district judge, but a final appealable judgment entered by the

s
three-j udge court.
Q

Well, what if the three-judge court is convened

and they examine the pleadings and than dismiss and say that
the constitutional issues in this case arc frivolous?
MR. NOLAND:

We believe that this Court has jurisdic­

tion over that direct appeal# Your Honor.
Q

You say that that’s appealable here?

MR. NOLAND: As we understand the decisions of this
Court# following Wilson and Mengelkoch# there are four decisions
cited in Appellants Reply Brief in which that procedure was
followed and in which tills Court took jurisdiction on direct
appeal,
Q

But there era also cases where the three judges

found that there wasn’t a substantial federal question,
dissolved itself# and then one judge rendered opinion# all on
the same clay.
MR, NOLANDs

"hat is the Mengelkoeh case# Mr.

d us fci c© Marsha 3,1
Q

Well# I was thinking of another on©# but 1 mean

that was not — that one was a single-judge action,
MR, NOLAND: The three-judge court found —
Q

Dissolved its©1f.

MR, NOLANDs Dissolved itself# and final judgment was
rendered by a single district judge.
Q

And all joined in the same proceeding.

10
MR» NOLANDs That is correct.
Turning now to the precise nature of the attacks on
the regulation below* appellants have attacked the regulation
at the bottom of page 5 of their brief* both on constitutional
and statutory grounds.

Two attacks are made* on the basis that

tbs regulation is unconstitutional on its face.
The first attack relates to the requirement that where
the separation has been for a period of less than six months *
exceptional circumstances of need must be shewn in order to
secure a waiver.
W© se© no rational basis for saying that if the
separation had been for loss than six months* a child must be
exceptionally needy; while if feh® separation has been for more
than six months, mere need is sufficient.
Therefore* w© argued below that this particular
provision of the regulation constituted a denial of equal
protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.
We do not believe that this question is rendered
insubstantial or frivolous by the Court6s decision in Dandridgg
vs. Williams.

We have an entirely different factual situation*

a different type regulation in this cases, a regulation under
which the appellants and other applicants have been denied all
aid,.

We. do not have here a maximum-grant type regulation Where

the families are already receiving some type of assistance* and

a maximum level is established

11
Secondly, the appellants have attacked the regulation
.on its face as granting a standardises and arbitrary discretion
to the Administrator.
As pointed out, in order to secure a vmivar of the
sir-month requirement, a special finding must be made by the
county department of public welfare.
Two of the plaintiffs in this case alleged in the
complaint that no investigation had been made into their
circumstances, upon which such a special finding could be based.
On this basis w© believe the Administrator has
discretion as to whether to conduct an investigation in any
particular case, a discretion which is not- guided by any
standard.
Furthermore, where there ie a failure to conduct an
investigation, the regulation in effect enacts a conclusive
presumption that an absence for less than sir months cannot be
a: continuous absence.

In these particular cases, therefore,

w© have a rigid six-month waiting period, and the sarae type of
regulation or statute which was involved in the Damico case
and in the Minnesota case of Doe vs. Hursh.
Q

What were the periods in those cases?

MR. NOLAND:

Both of those periods were three-month

periods, Your Honor.
Q

Both were shorter than six months, then.

MR. NOLANDS

Both statutes were struck down as being

contrary to the Social Security Act, although aech court
conceded that the constitutional claims raised were substantial
Q

You're not claiming that any tir:c, period would

necessarily he violative of the statute or the Constitution,
would you?
MR. NOLAND: We believe that any fciiao period —
Q

I ©©an* conceivably, a roan could leave in the

morning at 7:30 and three or four hours later his wife cculd go
in and apply for assistance, saying, ”My husband la.fr. thin
morning and, for all I know, he’s not going to coma back."
MR. NOLAND: That is correct, Your Honor.
situations will vary.

Obviously

In some cases the Administrator may be

-able to reach a determination that an absence is continued two
or three days after the husband departs.

In other casco it. may

tak© longer to arrive at that determination.
Q

W© do believe

Are you suggesting that 30 days would be

unconstitutional?
MR. NOLAND:

I am suggesting -- no-, Your Honor, that

it would not be unconstitutional, but. anything above that
would oe a violation of the Social Security Act.
Q

At least so far as it were an almost conclusive

presumption?
MR. HOIAND; That is correct.
Q

Is that what you mean?

Ml. NOLAND; That is correct.

<*

13
I think our primary problem with this regulation is
relating the exceptional circumstances of need requirement to a
durational requirement.

We can see no rational basis for saying

that even though it may be- difficult fco arrive at a determina­
tion ©f continued absence, that a waiver will be granted only
if exceptional circumstances of need are present.

We ballav®

that violates the Social Security Acte which speaks of needy
children and not exceptionally needy children.
In addition, the appellants have alleged in their
complaint that there is a Statewide policy and practice under
this regulation of requiring applicants to file for legal
separation or divorce in order to secure a waiver of the sixmonth period.
The testimony before the three-judge panel on this
question was directly conflicting.

There was evidence on

behalf of plaintiff that such a practice had been engaged in,
•at least in their casas, and in other case®.

The Administrators,

on the other hand, denied the existence of any such practice.
As w© think is apparant from the court's entry, the
court made no fact-finding as to whether this practice did or
did not exist.

It apparently assumed the existence of this

practice and yet, nevertheless, found that the constitutional
issues raised were insubstantial.
Appellants urge that such practice, if it exists as
alleged, constitutes denial of the First Amendment, and the

14
equal protection clausa of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Turning now to the question of exhaustion of
administrative ranedies, we think this is the primary basis for
the decision of the district court.

As appellants have read

the prior decisions of this Courts there is an absolute exemption
from any exhaustion requirement for actions brought under the
Civil Rights Act.
This has been established both by Damico vs.
California and King vs. Smith.
We submit that there is important policy justifica­
tion for such an exemption.
Cases such as this under the Civil Rights Act, and
particularly welfare cases, involve essentially or primarily
questions of federal law, whether it be constitutional law or
statutory law.
We see no need, therefore» for the State Administra­
tors to consider Stair.© law, to make any fact-finding based on
th© record before an administrative agency, or to apply their
expertise or discretion.

The regulation hare is being attacked

both on its face and as applied, and we believe these issues
can properly ba determined by a federal court without.
exhaustion.
In addition, if exhaustion is tiv bo required in
certain cases, we submit that this 1*3 not such a caee, because
the administrati'v© remedy is inadequate.

There is no identical

15
administrativ& remedy in Indiana.
individual in nature.

That remedy is solely

There is no class action procedure

before the administrativo agency *
In addition, an administrative appeal does not
result in any decision of general applicability throughout the •
state.
Now, the appellee, tine state department in this case,
has devoted a large portion of its brief to arguing that full
discovery rights are available in administrative proceedings in
Indiana.

The appellants do not dispute that proposition as a

matter of statute book law.

However, the very record in this

case demonstrates that any pursuit of discovery before the
administrative agency would be entirely futile.
The plaintiffs below filed both subpoenas and motions
to produce, to obtain copies of case files and other . documents
pertaining to the application of the challenged regulation.
Both the State department and the county department resisted
any motion to produce on the basis that the records requested
were confidential in nature.

And, in a letter to the court

and to counsel, dated November 5, 1970, the State welfare
department stated;

"I specifically request that you obtain a

court order to require Mr. Sterrett to produce these files at
the time of hie proposed examination."
The county welfare department said essentially the
same thing in an affidavit filed in support of their objection.

That it is essential in a case such as this that, the plaintiffs
have access to the documents in order to establish their
constitutional allegations that this regulation has been applied
in such a manner as to he contrary to the equal protection
clause.
Yet the appellees have told us in this very c&sv that
they will require a court order in order to produce the docu~
ia©nts requested.

Appellants know of no procedure in Indiana

whereby a court order can be obtained without filing a lawsuit.
Therefor®» we submit» we're back right where we started from;
the appellants would receive non® of the documents in an
administrative proceeding and would be required to file the
very lawsuit which is now before Your Honor©.
An additional basis for the decision of the district
court appears to have been a reliance upon Mr, Justice Stone’s
distinction mad® in Hague, vs. C. 1.0.» that no jurisdiction lies
under the Ci.vil Rights Act where the complaint raises only ;
questions relating to property rights and not to personal
rights incapable of valuation.
W@ believe that, the prior decisions of tills Cssurt
have» satisfied this question» -that jurisdiction dees lie under
Section 1343(3)» where there is a denial of welfare benefits»
since it has been recognised that such a denial does involve
important aspecte of personal liberty.
Therefore» we urge that the district court erred in

17
dismissing tho complaint on this ground.
Q

Does your — 2 «an understand your argument about

thr©©~judge; court jurisdiction, but how about federal jurisdic­
tion at ail?

How about jurisdiction of ‘the federal courts?

Are you under 1933, is that what you’re —
MS* NOLAND:

Yes# the action was brought undor

Section 1983»
Q

And 13«3C4)?

MR* NOLAND:

1343(3) and (4)# both, were invoked to

support the jurisdiction*
Q

And in terms of federal jurisdiction at all.» the

other side simply claims 1983 deem * t reach this kind of ouit?
MR. NOLAND: That claim was made in brief filed
before the district court, Your- Honor, primarily upon the b&aizof the case of McCall va, Shapiro.
Q

Well, the lower court ruled that- it didn't

have jurisdiction under 1343(3} or (4), and I wonder what tha
basis for that three-judg© court's ruling was.

MR„ NOLAND:

We find the entry to be rather opaque

on that ground, Your Honor.
Q

Could it have been the Hague finding?

MR. NOLAND:

As far as we are able to-determine,

-

that is the only ground it could have bean, Mr. Justice
Brennan.

The Hague issue was briefed to the court.
Q

It's in the Second Circuit cases that followed,

18
then»

MR. NOLAND:

McCall va. Sh/avlrv was the primary csss

relied upon by the defendants below.

At that time tbs Second

Circuit —
Q

Is -that in the Second Circuit?

MR. NOLAND: That is e, Second Circuit case which took Q

Was that here?

MR. NOLAND:
Q

I do not believe so.

It was not?

MR. NOLAND: The Second circuit ia that case took a
very restrictive position in applying the Hague

vs»

€.I.0.

distinction.
Sine© then, for exaiaple in the Risen case, Mr. Justice
Friendly has recognised that welfare actions do involve
important aspects ©£ personal liberty —
Q

That was in dissent# wasn't it?

MR. NOLANDs
Q

Judge Friendly was not in dissent?

MR. NOLANDs
Q

Q

1 do not believe so.

What's that citation?

MR. NOLAND:
in 421 Feci 2d.

No, sir.

That's the Eisor. case# Risen vs. Eastman

Certiorari was denied in 4.30 U.s.
Thank you.

MR. NOLAND;

In addition, another three-"judge panel

in the Second Circuit# in Johnson vs. Harder, in 438 Fed 2d,

19
did recognise that jurisdiction doss ax ist undor Section .1343

in welfare actions.
Q

Which one Was that?

MR. HOL&NDs That was Johnson vs. Bardarc# Hr. Justice
Brennan# in 438 Fed 2d.
Q

That's also in the Second.

You have them both

cited?
MR. NOLANDS

Yes, sir.

W© see no other fossis for the district court's
decision on the 1343 point other than the Hague vs. C.X.O.
distinction.
On thee© grounds# therefore# we believe that this
Court properly has jurisdiction over this ..appeal under Section
1253# that the complaint did raise substanti al constitutional
questions which were neither frivolous nor patently absurd on
the basis of thin Court's prior decisions# that the plaintiffs
were not required to exhaust their State administrative
remedies and that the district court had jurisdiction under
Section 1343.
For these reasons we urge that fell© decision ©£ the
lower court foe reversed and that the cos© fo© remanded for a
full trial on the merits.

I would like to reserve any remaining time for
rebuttal# Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Peden.

20
OEM, AHGUCTIT OF MARK PED3N, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE STSERET^
MR. PEDENs

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it. please the

Court5
W® believe that this appeal belongs in the Seventh
Circuit*

Ifliat happened in this esse was that the single judge

convened a three**judge panel, who heard the case, and
dismissed it entirely •

There was nothing remaining to fee. dor,®

by a single judge in this case,.
We rely on the two cases discussed by Mr* Noland,
ffilson vs» City of Pert Lavaca, and Mangelkooh vs.^Industrial
Commission *
In those two cases the three-judge panel dissolved
the case and sent it bach to the sing.1© — dissolved their own
panel arid sent it back to the single district judge for
resolution *

In those cases the single judge dismissed the case

and this Court held that the appeal properly went to the
Seventh circuit — or to the Circuit Court of Appeals?.
Q

Well, are you arguing that this, then, waa in

fact — the action was legally the action of a single, judge
even though three purported to take part in it?
MR. PEDENs
Q

Yes, sir,.

It’s our opinion that- fclis

How would you identify which one of those three

judges, than, waa the single judge?
I'm not sure that's crucial here.

21
MR. PBDBNs

Wo wouldn't b© able to.

Tbs feet that

wo are going on her© is that to remand this back to ct single
district judge would bo a pedantic and useless sat, a pointless
formality, wh@r© there's nothing left to be don© by a single
judge.

The three*»judge court has dismissed the case in its

entirety»
Q

Well, that was a judgment, was it not, by the

three-judge court, cm the merits of the case?
MR. PEDENs

It was a judgment that they had no

jurisdiction.
Q

Yes, that’s on the merits.

MR. PEDEN:

And where a three-judge court dismisses

for want of jurisdiction, tha appeals court —
Q

Well, they may have been correct, and they may

have been incorrect.

But, in any event, it was? a judgment on

the merits of the complaint, was it not?

By the three-judge

court.
MR. PEDEN;

Yes, as was the judgment in WlIson and

Mengalkoch, and more recently in —
Q

In that case there was a seiand to the single-

judge court; that is the difference.
MR. PEDENs That's n factual difference.
Q

You say it's just a technical difference?

ME. PEDEN:

I think it's a difference without any

consequence, and to make the jurisdiction of this Court under

22
Section 1253•depend on a simple formality in gratuitous —
Q

Well, - Congress may have dona exactly that.

St’s not for us to stale® the jurisdiction, Congress did it.
said

it

gave us jurisdiction of direct appeal frost an action of

e three-judge court.
MR. PEDEM5
Q

¥@s, it did.

Certain actions of a three*»j udge court.

MR. PEDEM$

And that arose because in 1875» after

federal courts were given jurisdiction over this type; of a c&rso,
were given the power to enjoin Stats statute, federal judges
quite freely exercised

this injunctive power; and public

resentment reached quite a peak» especially after the decision
of this Court in Ex parte Young in 1908» where the powers of
federal judges to enjoin State regulatory schemes was upheld.
The injunctions were often granted simply on a basis of
affidavits in ex part© proceedings•
/

The public resentment was «uch that Congress in 1910
passed the three-judge Act» so that it now requires three
judges before a State statute can bs struck down.

And they

further protected the State interests by providing -that any
appeal should go direct to the Supreme court.

So that the

whole impetus for the three-judge Act was to protect State
interest© from interference by the injunctive power of federal
courtso

It was not to protect parties such as the plaintiff

in this casa
Q

Well, they gave

a

direct spp@al to this Court

from a judgment of a fchre^-judge court, oibbvr granting or
denying an injunction, didn’t fchoy?
MR. PBDBN*

Yes, an order granting or denying.

It is

mutual in that sense. But w© submit that the thrust of the tot.
did not encompass situations of this typo*
Q

Suppose the order had said fefea motion of the

defendant to dismiss this complaint is hereby granted.

Would

that he all right?
And signed by the three judges*
MR. P.EDEN;

I state, Your Honor, that that would be

close to what happened here.
Q

Well, would that hs all right?

The only thing I left out was "for failure of a
federal jurisdiction55 ? that’s all 15va left out.

But you

apply for an injunction and they grant, dismiss your complaint,
th©y thereby d©ny your injunction
MR. PEDENs
Q

Well, —

— and you say that that is not grounds for

appeal to this Court?
MR. PE DEN s

Your Honor, in a recent, case, Goldstein

vs. Cox, this Court held that where a motion for summary
judgment was denied, the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment
was denied, even though they had asked for an injunction, the

24
appeal still! lay to the court, of appeals.

Shat was c^Xcutgin

vso Cox,
Q

Well, that's not this on©.

with how many witnesses?

16 witnesses•

They had a hearing
That’s nob summary

judgraent*
MR. PEDEMs Well, the hearing was held for toe purpcas
of determining jurisdiction,
Q

And that was the case, wasn’t it?

MR. PEDEM *

Yes, they determined they did not turn;

jurisdiction, and they —
Q

No, they said the complaint is dismissed for

failure of federal jurisdiction.

Why isn’t that an effective

order of a three-judge court?
MR. PEDENs
Q

Why isn’t the effective —?

Why isn't that just as effective as granting an

injunctio», and find the jurisdiction and granting an- injunction?
MR. PEDEM?
Q

Well, Section —

But; maybe you’d better got along to the merits of
your argument.
MR. PEDSK? ffe believe that the Indiana «sir-month
requirement is not violativ© of equal protection because it's
founded in rationality.

In the previous case the court had

difficulty in distinguishing between the college student and
the vocational student» but there can ho no 'doubt that undor
a, six-month requirement the standard of the continued absence
is going to be © lot more clear the longer th© parent is absent
from the house,
Th© six-month requirement in founded in the commonsans» belief that when a father leaves a family it will ba vary
likely that the standard of need» soon after the father leaves.,
is not as great as it will be later.
The regulation also contains a clause- which states
that in casas of exceptional circumstances, aid may ba avail­
able.

This clause means that when — since the standard —

the evidence below indicated that the standard of need that
would qualify a family for aid after six months'was th© sam®

as used by welfare departments in a determination of «rho met
exceptional circumstances before six months.

The basis cf

th® ruling is that when a man leaves the house there will be

a length of time, and that it*s necsssaxy* in ordar to prevent
fraud, is* order to insure that fcha continusd absence is real «
How, it* a our position that this doesnTt violata
equal protection,, because, under fcbe Dandridge esse, hbo Court
noted that the test of such a regulation 'is whether or not it*»
reasonable, and whether or not it4s free from invidious
discrimination„
Th-s AFDC progress was described a;s a program of
cooperative federalism•

The States have leeway, and under

th© statutory argument, aside from the equal protection
argument, it's our position that 405, as a 'definition, is not
mandatory and binding upon the States.

This was already brought

out in the last case to quit© a bit of extent,
w© feel that the requirements that are binding upon

th<& States, as suggested by the Soiled tor General, ara in
Section 402,

These requires»©»ts have been saddled with

effective date®, whereby, in order to meet the®© requirements,
th© states have to comply by a certain data.

Whereas Section

406, the definitional section, there are no effective dates.
This envisages, then, that the real requirements of
th© Act, the one® which would require the States to perhaps
enact legislation that will enable the® to meet the require#»»ta, that Section 402' is the section which actually
establishes binding requirements on the state.

The legislative

history of: this Act fully supports? this*,

Ail th® ramarko in

the Senate Reports, cited by the Solicitor General's brief in
this case, amply supports the view that Section 406 eotsblishcr.
th© outer boundaries of State participation, for which federal
funding will be available.

And that Section 402 is fcha only

section of the Act which is mandatory upon the States.
Section 402 (b) states that the Secretary will Approve

any plan which complies with that section, meaning 402, and
the requirements in 402(a) ♦

It does not aay that the Secretary

will refuse to approve plans because they fail to mmt the
definitional requirements of Section 406,
So w© submit that on the basis of th© Dandxidge eas©
K.wwwj-aw3K3Sitt tiil

aXSO-

there is no conflict with equal protection under this six-month
rule, and that upon the basis of the legislative background,
and th© Internal consistency of tho Social Security Act, there
is no conflict with that Act either.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W, GEODES, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF APPELLEE STANTCM
MR. GEDDESs

Mr. Justice Bougies'., and may it please

the Courts
With- the limited time, l*d like to make it. perfectly

clear to the Court that appellee Wayne Stanton, hie position is
that w© shouldn*t bs in th© federal court? period.
Hot whether or not we should be in this? Court so much
but whether or not w© should be in the federal court* if the
doctrine of abstention or the doctrine of exhaustion of
administrative remedies has any meaning under this type of ensi'
With respect to the merits of. this case, itss fully
covered in our briefs, it's fully covered with case law,

Thar©

were charges in there that the applicants or the claimants ooy;s
we could not file an application unless wo sued for divorco,
unless w© file for legal separation,

The evidence is clear,

in fact two of the claimants alone r©c©iv?scl benefits lass
than three months after their husbands separated, and thoy
never filed for divorce.
There was © witness Smith, she testified that she
filed her application immediately and within a month she
received aid? she never filed for divorce,
There was a witness Biankenbackler, she received aid
in two months after separation, and never filed for divorce.
So, as far as this sir-month requirement under
Indian© regulation, all the six months i.s Is a guideline* in
other words, after elk months there's a conclusive presumption.
But if the need is there, and th© absence is •actual and bona
fide, th© regulation say© that the person can receive aid
immediately.

That distinguishes this case from th® Damico and

30
all the others, where it was

k

thrce-mc;.th ■ ituaticn,

or

starve.
Q

Hw, did the district court hold what you've

just told us?
ME, GEDDES: The district court held, Your Honor, Mr*
Justice, that there was no substantial federal Question, end
the claimants did not exhaust their administrative remedies,
and therefor© they said there was no federal jurisdiction»
Q

They hold that on the pleadings there was no

substantial federal question.
MR. GEDDESs
Q

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.

Now, certainly the pleadings, the complaint

alleged the existence of this six-month rule, did it not?
MR» GEDDESs The pleadings alleged the regulation
which say© six months or —
Q

Yes,

MR, GEDDESs

—• unless there's an exceptional

circumstance.
Q

You mean in the absence of exceptional

circumstances?
MR. GEDDESs That is correct, Your Honor,
tfhht the court did, at least in my opinion, -they had
■idle pleadings in front of them, they had the motion to dismiss
and they heard 16 witnesses to determine whether the court
should take jurisdiction to hear fefca case — fully hear the ease

31

wu. the sisiits»
involved.

Tnex*© yjuin about ton hours 33 testimony

And after concluding that, and after hearing the

evidence, then they made their conclusion;

no subs

. federal question on the pleadings, and the parties failed to
exhaust administrative remedies.
But this —■ excuse me, Your Honor.
Q

They didn't refer, however, to the evidence,

except insofar as the failure to exhaust administrative
remedies?
MR. GEDDRS; That is correct, Mr. Justice.
Q

They didn’t in any way - decide: that this alleged

six-month rule really didn’t exist, or I moan really wasn't an
arbitrary or conclusive presumption, did they?
MR, GEDDES:
Q

No, Your Honor.

They didn’t decide that.

MR. GEDDES: No, Mr, Justice, they did not.

Q

All right,

MR. GEDDES:

This case is the only case I could find

and the only case I know of where this Court is faced now with
e^.i© decision to make, with respect to administrative remedies.
Now, the appellants have cited King, they have cited
have cited Houghton, McNesso, but each of these
cases,if you look at the merits of those cases, the administrative remedy involved there was either not adequate, it was not
speedy, or it would have been futile.

32
For example, in HcJteggs, I believe th© parties would
have to go back and get ~~ it was a segregation case, they
would hare to get ten percent of the vote# or-so many people,
and then ~Q

But did what the court said in Mgfearif turn on

those facts?
ME* GEDDES:

No# Your Honor.

They jur-f. said th«it

there was — that under 1983 you did not have to -exhaust
administrativo remedies»
What has been causing confusion with th© federal
courts is whether this ~~ the confusion is if you xnak® a claim
under 1933# does that give you an absolute right to bypass
all administrative remedies; and that’s really the question
before this Court today.

Q

But l gather, for what it's worth# what MCNeesse

said indicated that that was th© case, that you need not if
you had a 1983 to exhaust State administrative remedies? was
it not?
ME. GEDDLSs That is correct, Mr. Justice.
Q

So, really, I gather what you're suggesting is

that we ought to review McNeese?
MR. GEDDESt

No.

McBaeae

MeMeese did say this,

though, they did say in there, and I forget the exact words,
but they said more or less that if th© administrative remedy
there is futile or if it wouldn’t do any good, you don’t have

to exhaust adiainis trstiv© remedies.
Q

Meaning that the iiapl.icsfc.ion was that if it was

sn adaquate administrative review, then you did have to?
MR. GEDDESs That i& my opinion, ifour Honor, and oar
opinion.
q

What specific administrativa review would allow

you to raise» the question of the unconstitu&ionality of that
statute as being in violation of the equal protection, clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment?
MR. GEDDESs
that question:

All right, tovur Honor, in answer to

The administrative procedure set up in

Indiana lias a number of means under which you can appeal.
Administratively you —
q

Where can he raises that question and have 'it

decided by a competent body?
MR, GEDDESs

Well, it says — on© of the means —

it says if the applicant believes his civil or constitutional
rights have been violated, he can appeal administrativelyj
and under Indiana —
Q

Where does he first run into a lawyer to

decide his question?
MR. GEDDESs All right. Th© Administrative Procedure
Act in Indiana provides that ho may have anybody represent
him —>

Q

Ho, no.

1 mean, who decides it?

*

v.y- m

MR* GJSDDES:

Cj, whc; decides this?

Thi'3 is a we 1 far

adrainie fcrator, the parson —
Q

Is ha a lawyer?

MR. GEDD&S:
Q

No, he is not.

Well, how can he decide fch® constitutionality of

an Indiana statu':.©?
MR» GEDDES:
Q

That it’s constitutional?

MR* GEODES s
Q

How?

MR. GEDDE5 s
Q

H© can mak© a finding whether —

Could he make a finding that ifc*s unconstihu&ior.

MR. GEDDESs
Q

He can make a finding —

Yes, h© can.
Under his oath*
Pardon?

Doesn11 h© take ah oath to support fch® lev/s of

Indiana?
MR. GEDDESs

I d©n9t know what oath h© takes, Mr*

Justice, but under fch© regulation if fch© parson believes his
constitutional or civil rights have been violated, he cars
appeal administratively.
Mow, if the Indiana regulation was a flat sir-month
rule, where there was no leeway for aid immediately, then I
would say that any decision «Q

well, h® doesn't raise that.; he just says the

statute is unconstitutional as in violation of the Fourteenth

itesndmenfc

of d@cid.ing that.?
MR. GEDDESs The administrative agency cannot mnsfc©
that decision.
Q

Well,, isn’t that the one point he’s asking for

in this casts?
ME. GEDDESs

Yes, ha is.

But when h® filed hi®

complaint with the federal court on that# the federal court,
as I interpret the entry, says there is not a substantia
constitutional question raised by this regulation and therefore
the parties must exhaust their available or administrative
«%

remedies,
Q

Well, that’s what we’re passing on now, aren’t

we?
MR. GEDDESs That is correct# Mr. Justice.
It‘s our position that what they haver alleged, the
applicants alleged hero, there*s an entire administrative
process established in Indiana to handle it,

For example, one

of them# if the application is denied, you can administratively
appeal it.

If it’s not acted upon in a reasonable- time, you

can administratively appeal it.

If your aid is revoked or

modified, you can administratively appeal it.
If you go to a caseworker and he refuses to accept
your application, you can administratively appeal it.
Q

Is that decision subject to a court review?

36
MR* GEDDESa

The first step, Mr. Jits tic©.. io the

State department of public walf&ra, —•

Q

Yes.

MR. GEDDESs

— and if fchsi party is still dissatisfied,

then it's reviewed by th© State board of public welfare vrcn
his request.

And than the applicant can go into either the

State or the federal court, depending on his own choice.

Q

How long does that --

Q

Which court?

MR. GEDDESs
Q

Which court?

The State court?

Either? of hi» own choice.

Well, if h@ birings a new action, is it de novo,

is it a review on an administrative record?
MR. GEDDESI

It's our opinion, Your Honor, with the

available discovery, the entire record can bo brought into the
federal court or th® State court.
Q

X know, but would th© State court bo limited

to th© administrative record, or would it be de novo?
MR. GEDDES s

Q

Mo, it would be da novo* ® now trial *

And similarly in th© federal court?

MR. GEDDES s That is correct, Mr. Justice.
Q

Wall, that doesn't sound like much of mi

administrative proceeding, then, doas it?

If you really aren't

reviewing the* administrative decision or. the administrativo

record
MS. GEDDES:

It could b@ both, Mr. Justice.

In

Indiana

w© adopt the federc! Rules of Civil Procedures on
So you have your request for admission# your

Discovery,.

depositions, your interrogatorias, everything,

You could obtain

your entire record administratively by the way which would only
take five weeks? and with the request for admissions aions you
would establish a record which the federal court could review
and possibly avoid a two, throe, four-weak trial.
Q

What's til© history of the tiro© it tab*;:;; to

complete th© administrative review ymrvs described for us?
MR, GE13DES:

it takes three weeks — two to fcfare©

weeks to have a hearing, once you've asked for appeal, tod
then there's two weeks for a decision,
Mow, one important thing about, this administrative
review is one© th® applicant file© hi® appeal or asks for
appeal, there's nothing formal about it, it's all informal,
the county is mandated — mandated — to review the situation.
In other words, if you8vs got a disgruntle! welfare applicant
who says "they won't accept my application”* which they said
here, but which was incorrect; if that happen®, all h© has to
do is informally ask for appeal end thy county lias to
review it,
Q

At that time wouldn’t it be moot?

Wouldn’t it

take six months to get there?
MR. GEDDESs
Q

No.

If the *»**

I thought you said five months a minute ago

MR. GEDDESs
Q

No.

I'm sorry, Mr. Justice, «—

Wall, vh&n do you exhaust your administrative

MS. GEDDES s
Q

Five weeks•

How long doss it take to exhaust all the way up

through that *— two State boards?
MR. GEDDESj

No.

Five weeks entirely, from the --

you go to the State board of public welfare — you go to the
State first? that takes five weeks, and then —
Q

You mean you can get a complaint all the way

through this Department and to the final agency in the> Stake of
Indiana in five weeks?
MR. GEDDESs
Q

Yes, Mr, Justice,' that is correct.

life l

That is correct, Mr.,. Justice*

— if you're really saying that

rather strange way of writing a regulation, of putting in a

saying ifc doesn't mean anything.
MR. GEDDESs

No.

You still have fee show need,

MR. GEDDBSs Before six months, if it's shown fchr.t

And that's all that the Social Security

Act requires.
Q

Well# maybe this doesn’t ~~ what is involved

her© is perhaps not technically exhaustion of administrative
remedies# but rather your claim that in -tho actual administra*”
tion of this rule it doesn't moan what it seems to mean.
that what you're saying?

Is

42
That in the actual adminietrafcic::» of welfare in
Indiana, or in Marion County, Indiana, that this sias-month rule
is not administered so as to make it mean what it aaams to mean.
Is that what you*re telling kb?
MR. GEODES:
Q

Possibly that could be correct.

tod therefore, had they proceeded to &&elt relief

undor the administrative procedures available they would hav-o
found that this rule was no barrier.

Is that it?

MR. GEDDESs That is correct, Mr, Justice.
Here we have the situation where it’s a built-in
administrative procedure, and if you can bypass it. here, and
under any 1963 claim, then what you’re having happen is the:
federal courts in reality are becoming the welfare administra­
tors to review every welfare claim.
Q

Is the evidence of 16 witnesses in the record

here, do you know?
MR. GEDDESs

Yes, there is? that is correct, Mr.

Justice.
Q

Well, are you suggesting — these 16 witnesses,

ware they all welfare claimants?
MR. GEDDESs
Q

Ho.

Part of the witnesses —

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. NOLAND:
Q

How about this?

MR. NOLAND:

Is that the fast?

No, the fact is, Mr, Justice Brennan,

that several of the witnesses did testify that they received
©id within the six-month period.
of the claimants — excuse me.

Two of the witnesses —■ two
One of the claimants or

plaintiffs, and one witness were denied aid until the full
expiration of the six-month period.
This is set forth on page 8 of appellants brief.
The claimant Bowman filed four applications —
Q

And this, X gather, is a class action?

MR. NOLAND: That is correct,
Q

So X suppose your position is that if one of

them — tiie am® as to on® is that sh© was denied for six
months, that gives you standing in the-; class action then.
MR. NOLAND: That would b© our position, ’Sfotir Her-or.
Q

And did she get — did that on© get aid after

its;

six months?

MR» NOLANDs Tha plaintiff Bewmtn hid receive sj.ic
after six months*

Th® witness Lake was denied aid for six

months and she began receiving assistance automatically upon
the expiration of the six-month periode
Q

In other words# if the administrative P/« "vdihvhJ ding;;

had not been completed in six months, then they’re bound ta

get their payment?
MR. NOLftNDs

Unless circumstances have changed*

On© of -tha witnesses, for example, had found a job in the
interim period and did not pursue it any further after the
six-month period»
Q

That was an eligibility question.

MR. NOLAWDs That is correct®
With respect to th© time requirement for th©
administrative proceedings, as brought out by Mr. Justice
Marshall, the record is vary spars® on this question.

There

is no doubt but what th® statute end regulations require there
hearings to© handled very expeditiously.
However, the two-week period, oven from the limited
evidence in this record, is obviously not followed.

On page

28 of th© Appendix, for example, in response to an interroga»
tory, Mr. Sterrett, 'the State administrator, stated that an

released on April 9t 1970? substantially more than a two-wee--

46

i

period.
Similarly, tho only witness who took i: ii .!;! drai ». i a tr&.h i ve
review testified, at page 110 of the Appendix, that the decision
was rendered by the State on December 29 — or September 29
1970, and fchs hearing was held on August 27, 1970*

&$ain

substantially more than two weeks.
Q

What would happen if the statute said that there-

had to be a showing that the spouse had left without any i&aa
of ever returning, period?

Would there be anything wrong with

that statute?
MR. NOLAND:

If Congress desired to enact such a

statute, we would find no quarrel with it.
Q

The point is —

But I do sea some msr.it in the argument that

this is really not six months, that if you go in there and say
that "My husband left last night with a one-trip ticket to —
a one-way trip ticket to Moscow,a sho'd be eligible.

That's

what I understand is the State's position.
MR. NOLANDs

1 would think the State or the

administrator would find that to foe a continued absence.

Q

Well, what's your problem now?

Is it that you

just object to showing it?
MR. NOLAND:

Mo, Your Honor.

W© object to showing

exceptional circumstances of need, which we believe constitute"
a denial of equal protection and also contrary to th© Social
Security Act.

Q

2b it really

you have to nhow the need e'sn

after six months.
ME. NOLAND»

That is correct.

But you do not have

to show *—
Q

So in other words -

MR. MOLANDs
Q

•— exceptional circumstances of n?r

That’s right.

i«

But that’s where you are on that

one —
MR. NOLAND:

whatever that requirement means, ft

certainly must mean more than plain nead.
Q

Yes. I understand.

MR. NOLANDs And we object to it on that ground.
Furthermore, with respect to the doctrine of
exhaustion of administrative remedies, appellants would again
urge that the administrative remedy in this case wan not
adequate,

lie heard talk again of discoveryP and yet th©

record in this vary case shows that any discovery effort
the administrative level would be futile because th© state
department has already told us that we must obtain a court
order in order to obtain the documents requested.
If, as stated in Monroe vs. Pape, and fcha KcNc^oe
cease, Section 1983 does truly constitute a remedy supplementary
to any state remedy, than w© believe that that must be
construed as granting an exemption from exhaustion either of
administrative or of State judicial remedies.
