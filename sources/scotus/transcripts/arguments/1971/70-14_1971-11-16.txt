ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H, ROBERTS, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS, WINFIELD DUNN, EE Ah
I®. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

'
This is an appeal from a Three Judge District

Court in the Middle District of Tennessee at Nashville, which
struck down the durational residency requirements for voting,
as provided by the State Constitution, and implemented by
Statutes of the legislature.
The time fixed in Tennessee for durational
residency requirements was one year In th© state, and three
months in the county before the person offers himself to
vote.

Now, the question presented is whether or not such

Constitutional and statutory provisions violate the Equal
Protection Clause of the lij.th Amendment of the United States
Constitution, and whether or not, in determining this, the
doctrine of "irrational or unreasonable" or th© "Compelling
Stats Interest" doctrine is to be mad© applicable in this
kind of a case and for the determination of this case.
At the time this case was decided by the District

Court, and so fax' as this Counsel has any way of ascertaining
now, thirty-three states and thro© territories have durational
residency requiramsnts of at least the one year, as is the
case in Tennessee.

Fifteen states had a six months

residency requirement, which is double the county residence
requirement provided fox'

in the State of Tennessee.

The

remaining two states had. respectfully, one ninety days and
A*

the other, three months, durational residency requirement *
Q

Mr* Roberts, hate there been any studies made

on widespread or even a national basis to determine how long
it takes to crank up registrations and that sort of thing,
and to check out to be sure that the voter isn't voting in
two states?
MR. ROBERTS:

Ho, sir, not to my knowledge*

If

Your Honor’please, that's where we think that the District
Court erred in trying to make such a determination based on
the registration cut-off line of thirty days which applies
in Tennessee and in most of the states that have registration
laws*

But it's our insistence that the Court was in error

there because that cut-off period is designed specifically,
and it is very clearly shown in the law, to bo for the
purpose of permitting the county election officials the
necessary time to make the administration acts that they
are required to.
For example, they have to take the master

5
registration, list* and then, break that down precinct by
precinct, end make duplicatos of it to go out to the precinct#
They’ve got to run their advertisements in the paper, notices
of the election, select all of the Judges and officers to
hold the elections at the precinct level, and it’s a countless
number of things.

Nowhore during that period of time can. the

Election Commission in Termesso©, and I think it’a generally
true everywhere else, use that period of time to purge an
ineligible voter.
Therefor©, the durational residency requirement is
necessary, we feel, in order to give soma time for which the
Election Commission can got rid of any ineligible voters,
purge them, as the case might be, and then the thirty-day
registration cut-off only for administrative period and
things alone, because somewhere, there’s got to be a period
of time when the voter knows that ho is going to bo entitled
to go to the polls and vote, and that is what wo think the
thirty days is for.
Q,

Now, so far as —

What’s boon the experience with those

administrative problems in connection with the new Federal
statute on election of President and other Federal electione?
MR. ROBERTSi

If the Court please, we haven’t had

a Presidential Election since then.

We don’t know yet quit©

how it's going to work out, and I don’t think that —
Q,

That’s thirty days, isn't it?

o
MB. ROBERTS:
Q,

Sir?

Thirty days residence?

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, sir.

Thirty days registration

eut“Off»
Q,

I gather Tennessee is going to have to

accomodate itself to that for the forthcoming Presidential
Election* isn't it?
MR. ROBERTS;

Yes, sir.

Well, Tennessee, if Your

Honor please, already had done this before the 19?0 Voting
Rights Act was passed.

That is one of the things that X

wanted to point out to the Court.
Thors are other ways of doing it besides, in effect,
reinterpreting the llj.th Amendment in order to bring it about*
Xn Tonnesseo, anybody that moves from, well, within a precinct
or anywhere ©Is© in the stato, has ninety days in which to
qualify himself in tho net* area, or, until that period of
time, ho can go bach and vote whore he had always voted,
either in person or by absentee ballot.

Ho is nover die—

onfranch!eed•
Well, the asm© is true so far as the year and'the
state la concerned, and by act of legislature, even before tho
X9?0 Voting Eights ct, we provided that, in Tennessee, any
person leaving that .state would maintain his domicile •«*

which in Tennessee
maintain

the

ia the Game as legal residence — he would

domicile

until such time as he acquired a

new

one, no matter what state he went to*

And w© think that

that la a sensible way of doing it so that you ore protecting
the people that usually would have the most interest*
It takes some little bhae-.

I think the Court can

take notice of the fact that a person who has lived a number
of years in a county, and then he moves, it's a little while
that he would prefer to bo identified back where he had been
for any period of time, as opposed to immediately entering
into the political arena in a new *»«> aah — now place.
Q,

Does Tennessee have criminal penalties for

voting in Tennessee and voting r- ■

-here else, if it could

bo accomplished?
MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, sir,

*

The problem with

this, though, if you are going to confine it to the
registration deadlines, for example, is determining whether
or not the person really io a bona fid© resident of the
state.

Mow, the District Court, in striking down the year

in the state and throe months in the county, did indicate
that they felt that the thirty-day registration deadline was
sufficient to accomplish this, and it has been argued in the
Opposing Counsels’ brief that anybody that would go into the
Registrar?s Office and be willing to make an oath that he’s a
bona fide resident would also he willing to make an oath as
well about anything

else that would be necessary to do this,

but that doesn’t follow, because it’s a nebulous sort of

8
Stewart*

How, viewing the oath as a whole, we think that it

is a promissory oath of constitutional support which requires
action in the future.

Now, the portion, which requires one

to ‘’oppose or overthrow" is ac-orrolatlve of the first portion
which requires one to support sad defend the federal and
state Constitutions.

For to support the Constitutions is, at

the same time, to oppose the overthrow of the Constitutions*
The second portion therefore clarifies the first portion and
delineates the employee’s obligatione under it.

.And the

second portion can also be said to tost whether the first
portion of the oath was taken without .mental reservation or
for purposes of evasion.
Q

an it

Lot mo ask you, Hr. Kayo, under this oath

is phrased with reference to defending, a person could

have a privato belief, a philosophical and political belief
in communism and. still conscientiously take this oath to
defend against those the overthrow of the government, could
he not?
MR. MAYO:
Q,

That's correct, Me*. Chief Justice.

So that this is. in that part of the oath, it

is not a case involving belief.
Hi. MAYO:

Is that right?

That is correct, and we would maintain

that the second portion of the oath likewise.

There is no

question, of belief which enters into the do termination,
this point.

on

But there is certainly no question of belief in.

9
th© first portion of the oath*
low, whatever nay bo the contentions on the
vagueness question, and even assuming those questione to be
colorable, as did Mr. Justice Harlan, when the case was her©
on prior appeal, wo think that an examination of the effect
of the oath on First Amendment freedoms dispels

sny doubt

that any of the plaintiff * s freedoms under the First
Amendment are infringed by the oath.
First of all, the oath is far different from those
oaths which have boon struck down by this Court in Baggett
and in Elfbrandt and in Or am».

Hew, the oaths in the© eases

required specific disclaimers of affiliation with so-called
"subversive
thing.

organizations," and tho instant oath is no such

In our view, it is a forward-looking promissory oath

of Constitutional support.

It does not require a statement of

belief, which is the crucial distinction between this oe.se
and the Connell case decided by thlo Court last torsi.

Ip

statement as to one's beliefs at the time ho is asked to
take the oath i s required, and tho oath does not proscribe
freedom of association so tho employee is free to join what­
ever organizations or political parties ho desires.
The oath docs not prohibit membership in any
organization or political party, nor does tho oath, infringe
on anyone’s religious beliefs or associations.

For instance,

if an employee is prohibited by .reason of hie religious

10
scruples from bearing arms* bo might qualify the oath in that
regard*

And I might add that such a qualification was

approved by the Attorney General of Massachusetts in 196? in
this respect*
In short, wo think that none of the plaintiff:e
First Amendment rights are infringed by this oath.
How, plaintiff's attack in this case seems in
the main to be concentrated on very speculative and conjectural
possibilities concerning speech and association in the event
of a possible overthrow of the government.
Q,

Is it clear to you that the phrase, "By force,

violence ox* by any illegal or unconstitutional method,11
modifies "overthrow" rather than "oppose?"

As a matter of

pure grammar, you could read this as saying that he will
oppose the overthrow, and

he'll oppose it by force, violence,

or fey any illegal or unconstitutional method.
MR. MAYO*

Ho, 2 think, Mr. Justice Stewart, the

language modifies tho word "overthrow" and not the word
"oppose."

It’s tho overthrow

by force, violence or any

illegal or unconstitutional method.
Q,

As a matter of grammar, would you agree that

it could be read the other way?

That ho has an obligation

to oppose the overthrow by force, by violence or by any
illegal or unconstitutional method, any way,as to oppose

tho overthrow of the government?
KH. MAYO1

No, I could not agree, as a rule of

grammar, that it would modify the word ’’oppose,,f because
I don’t think that an employee would use an illegal or an
unconstitutional method to oppose the overthrow»

I don’t

believe that would bo permitted*
The Comonwealth of Massachusetts does not believe
that remote conjecture can suffice to invalidate the oath on
constitutional grounds.

Now, what is required in this case

to reach such a determination ia a readily apparent constitu­
tional infirmity.

In other words, it must be clear beyond

per adventure that the oath will restrict the plaintiff’s
First Amendment freedoms, and a precise identification of
those freedoms must bo made.
The Court must be able to say that the inhibiting
effect on speech or association ia real, not illusory, and
we submit that such an inhibiting effect cannot he gleaned
from the estreacly remote possibilities as to what plaintiff
may bo required to say or do in the future.
Plaintiff goes on to argue that the due process
clause invalidates the oath because it requires a summary
dismissal without a hearing, citing the Connell case decided
last term.

Again, the crucial distinction between the two

caeca la that the Florida oath, which was considered by this
Court in Connell, contained the word "believe,”

”! do not

12

believe in the overthrow of tho government,"

And the

opinion of thin Court requires Florida to hold a hearing to
ascertain, we suppose, whether tho beliefs are firmly held
prior to a final discharge of the employees.
In tho case at bar there is no necessity for such
a hearing because there is no factual inquiry to he madoj
since the oath involves only promises of future action, a
hearing in this regard would bo meaningless.
takes the oath or ho doesn't.

'Either a person

Essential determination can

easily be reached without a hearing.
In this caso, I would note that tho Court is
confronted with a record that is absolutely barren of any
threat of prosecution for perjury, or any hint that plaintiff
would bo discharged for a failure to live up to tho terms of
tho oath and, in fact, since the oath was enacted in 19)4.9,
no prosecutions have resulted, and no public employes has
been discharged for failure to perform his obligations under
tho oath.

And therefor© wo think tho plaintiff's fears as to

the infringement of her First Amendment rights, undor the
circumstances, aro

simply without foundation.

We think that tho case can bo succinctly summarized
In the words of Hr. Justice Harlan, who said, when tho case
was hero on the earlier appeal,

Thank you, Mr. Mayo.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN H. OLESKEX, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF APPELLEE, LUCRETIA PETEROS RICHARDSOU
MR, OtESSEY:
Q,

Mr. Chief Justice ~

Do you agree, Hr* Oleskoy, with the response

that Mr. Mayo gave to my hypothetical question — perhaps
not hypothetical ~~ that a person could be a philosophical
believer in communism end yet take the oath that he would —*
conscientiously

take the oath he would oppose the overthrow

of the government by force, violence, and so forth?
MR, OLESKEY:

Well, I'm not sure that I do agree,

Mr, Chief Justice,
Q

Do you think he might not be a very conscien­

tious communist, perhaps?
MR* OLESKEY:

I think that's one possibility.

I

thought originally that your question was addressed to clause
one of tho oath.

If, in fact, wo are referring to clause

two, tho oppose the overthrow, I think, clearly, it could be
much more difficult, not only for a communist, but for an
anarchist or anyone else who believed that under certain
circumstances tho violent overthrow of the government ought
to be brought about to take that portion of tho oath In

good conscience*
Q,

Well# does that second part of the oath deal

with belief pop so#

op

does it deal with a pledge with respect

to future conduct?
MR. OLBSKEY:

There is no reference, as there was

in the Comoll case, concededly,

to belief.

It is a

straightforward promissory oath of future intent.

However,

I would argue, and do argue-that —
Q

Future conduct, isn’t it, rather than intent?

MR, OLESKEY:
oppose."

Well, the oath specifies "I will

I would argue that that requires an affirmation

at the time the oath is taken, the instant that the potential
employee utters It, just as someone about to take the witness
stand in a trial will bo required to swear to the truth of
what he's about to say, that he intends from that time for­
ward to act in conformity with the words which ho has
repeated.

Otherwise, the oath can’t have any moaning.
k

ho you see much distinction between the oath —

the first part of the oath before the conjunctive "end" and
the oath that you took, for example, when you were admitted
to the Bar of this Court?

That you — I think the language

almost tracks, except the oath here doesn’t includo the
State of Massachusetts, of course.
MR. OLESEBY:

I must confess with some•slight

embarasaaont, since I’m appearing pro hac vice, being three

days short of eligibility fox* admission to the Bar* of the
Court, so I have not yet taken that oath.

Wella

Q.

then lot's pose that In terms of the

oath that you will take three days hence, or thereafter.
YouHfe heard the oath in this Courtroom, of course»
MR* GLES&EYs

X have not, Hr. Chief Justice, in

fact.
Q,

Well, X think it is essentially the same as

the first part of the oath that you take out in Massachusetts,
so moving to just tho second, the second is really a conduct,
a pledge of future conduct, isn’t it?
I®. OLSSKEY:

Well, X have tried to suggest that I

foci it is more than conduct, insofar as it does require —
if the oath is to bo taken as more than an amenity, and,
clearly, there are those who, like my brother, nr. Mayo* feel
that it is only an amenity

but if it is to bo more than an

amenity, it's got to comport with your belief at that time
as to how you govern your futuro conduct, and, course, it
reaches belief in that sense.

How could you, consistent with

a belief in violent overthrew under some circumstances, take
the oath, part two, as required by Massachusetts?

And I

suggest that **->
Q

It works on the same theory, I suppose, that

lawyers might disagree with m opinion of a court, and yet,
as officers of the court, be

bound, to uphold it.

16
MR* OLESKEY:

Yes, X agree to a bound to uphold a

court in a judicial system, but wa are not required, as this
oath suggests, on on© interpretation to necessarily undertake
arms or take any other action to physically or even verbally
oppose tho overthrow of the state cr federal government,
which is what part two purports to say,
Of course, 1 recognise that on© of the difficulties
here in talking about, wlmt part two does purport to require
or say, is that no one can really provide a satisfactory
t

definition of that language.

Mr* Justice Stewart, I think,

has hit upon a very basic grammatical problem which I’ve never
been able to resolvo to my own satisfaction, which is whether
or not tho reforone© to force, violence, illegal, unconstitu­
tional method modifies the words ’’oppose” or the word
.’•overthrow*”

I think this is just one example of the vagueness

found in tho second portion of tho oath, the nor© fundamental
problem being exactly what do those elusive words "oppose
tho overthrow” moan?

And tho very fact that the Commonwealth

of Massachusetts, in three years of arguments, brief, and
again today before this Court, is basically unable to offer
a satisfactory example of what that language means, X think,
suggests how very vague and elusive it does — it is

and,

therefore, does bring it within the purview of such casos as
y '■ ett v. Bul3.itt and Cr s
•

...... r

■

>

...

............

which wore struck down similarly for vagueness.

...............

17
I would lllx© to roeponti, If X may, to the
Commonwealth position that the Appolloo’s arguments with
regard to First Amaaidmont freedoms are ‘bpeculativ© and
conjectural."

I think th© Court, this Court, has clearly

faced that problem many times before.
Mr. Justice White addressed himself to that
rathor forcefully in Baggett and Bullitt, particularly at
page 373, when he talked about the dangers of conduct which
might be deterred by vague oaths, the control which such
oath gives a prosecutor who might wish to deter speech,
association, and the like.
I suggest that Mrs* Richardson or any other
employe a of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts -« and the
1970 census indicates that approadmatoly on© hundred and
sixty thousand such employees would have boon exposed
sometime during the period of their employment to the
requirement to take this oath — they have no roal way to
find out whether or not those fours about First Amendment
freedoms and prosecution for violation of the injunction
of the oath are "speculative” or "conjectural" except to
go ahead and take th© oath and take the risk, and that is
exactly why this Court has quite properly struck down such
oaths in th© past.
*j?he other alternative is, of course, the one that
Mrs. Richardson, in this case, chose.

It has caused her, to

18
date, a three^year wait since aha was fired in November of
1968 for refusing to take the oath, but that is, to refuse
to teke the oath at all*

Of course, in such eases as

Wtemau and Usdoggaff* and later cases, this Court has said
that however you stylo government employment, whether you
considor it a benefit, a privilege, or what, you oannot
justify either exclusion * or punishment because of such an
oath, whore it is unduly vague or overbroad*.
Q,

What if it wore perfectly clear here, the

second part of the oath, that the oath reads that to obey
the oath, you had to affirmatively to speak out against
violent overthrow on the one hand and, secondly, physically
to oppose violent overthrow?

Suppose both of those things

were specified?
HR. OLESKIsYs

I agree that that would clarify, but

I feel it would be equally unconstitutional, clearly .following
the lino of such casos as Barnette and West Virginia Board
of Education, where it was said that, consistent with those
schoolchildren1 o beliefs in another Diaty, another

Just suggested —Q,

Well, you don't need vagueness then, do you?

MU OLSSKEY!

Well, in my reading of the cases» I

think this Court has frequently talked about both of them as
different sides'of the sane coin, that coin being, basically,
First Amendment freedoms, particularly speech and association
and the deterrence which very frequently results when o:a
employee like Mrs. Richardson or anyone else is faced with
the necessity of taking ouch an oath*

Bo you think “oppose" is any clearer than

HR* OLFSKEYS

Well, the district court suggested

"oppose" from "actively oppose," that is, to do something,
to merely refraining from some conduct oneself, which, again

ME. Gb&SKEXi

which are both par curiam affirmances, don’t really discuss

think that the only real and fair

think it is Article VS, Section 3, has a general requirement

And I think if* in fact* as

Hr* Kayo appears to argue at on© point in his brief* if tho

But it doesn’t say,

think, being "will" moaning not only is Mrs. Richardson

Supreme Judicial Court, in its closest pronouncement *'* the.
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts -- several years ago
suggested that in construing a teacher’s oath, which was not
too dissimilar, it would prefer to leave such ultimate
constitutional questions, interestingly enough, rather than
pronounce upon it itself,

Q

Mr, Oleskey, suppose the Oath; said, ’’I’m

against the overthrow of the government”?

I’m trying to

use seme plain english«

MR* OXjESKEY:

Th© entire oath, or the second

portion?
Q

After the ’’and,”

"And that x am against the

overthrow of the government,” et cetera.
MR* GLESKY:

I think that would clearly conflict

with "believe," Mr, Justice Marshall,

Q

Why?

MR, OLBSKY:

Because the person might or might not

in fact be against the overthrow, consistent with decisions
oi this Court, including the Bar admission cases decided

£4
last term*
It says that "as of this moment, " which means
that, immediately after I’ve taken, my oath, 1 might change
my mind, doesn't it?
ME, OLESKEY:

But It does require and compel,

egression of belief as of that moment, which I don’t think Q,

Consistent with one moment»

MR. OLESKEY:

Yes, which I don’t think consistent

with the First Amendment can be compelled»
Q,

May I ask, Mr. Oleskey, if the purpose of

this — Mr3, Richardson now asks to take the oath stopping
it «« the word Massachusetts.

Would the state violate the

injunction that the district court granted?
ICC. OLESKEY:

X believe that it would, It?. Justice

Brennan, because X believe that the injunction and the
decision both go to the entire oath.
Q,

Well, if the — the decision, the opinion,

seems to treat the two parts separately, and indicates that
the first part at least, on the authority of Knight, is
constitutional, and that the vice is in the ,TI will oppose*'
part —•
MR. OLESKEY!
Q,

But, the

—« as far as the course of the injunction,

is concerned the preparatory judgment was, you are quite right,
there the whole oath is invalid, the section is invalid, and

the injunction is against prohibition based upon her
refusal to take the oath required by the section, but if
the Massachusetts were to my, '‘Well, wo won't ask her to
take the oath required by the section, but only an oath
ending up with the word Massachusetts," do you still think
that would violate the injunction?
MR. OLESKEY:

1 think it would, because of the

specific language, first of all, in the judgment and
injunction, that section Ilf. of 26i|, violates the First
?
Amendment In odd section Hr., clause 2 of the oath and
q

Yes, but if Massachusetts was reinforced, it

would no longer be the oath required by section lij., but a
different on©.
HR. GLESKEY:

If the legislature reenacted ouch czi

oath, it is conceivable that — it's obvious that
Mrs. Richardson could bo at least asked to do it*
0,

I guess what wo are saying is that the

injunction is theirs.
Q,

Do you think there is any impediment to a

court amending the oath?
MR* OLESSEY:

1 think, first of all, this oath, as

I suggested, is not clearly severable♦

Secondly, there is

no indication *—
Q,
legislature -

You mean that that's a matter of Massachusett

£6
MR. 0LE3KEY:
Q

And

Yob.

therefore, it cannot be treated, a a

severable?
MR. OkESKEY:

Yea.

I

think the most proper course,

if you5 re going to sustain the judgment of the three-judge
court, as I hope you would, and the injunction would he again
to affirm striking down the entire oath, and let the
legislature in Massachusetts do with this oath, or any other
oath, what It chooses, in light of the decision.

I think

it should he made clear that the second portion of this oath,
which,

1

suggest, is tied firmly to the first portion, is

constitutionally defective,

I would like
freedom of as o ociation

to

make

which*

speculativo and conjectural.

on© more point with regard to
again, say brother suggests is
I think, clearly, within the

problems created by part two of the oath, someone like
Mrs. Richardson, any state employee in Massachusetts, might,
well wish to join any group, oven a so-called ”funH group..
which had as its stated purposes something very innocent,
like preserving forests in Massachusetts.

One of the other

alms of this group could obviously be violent overthrow of
the government.

Under decisions of this Court, as X under­

stand them, Kirs. Richardson could not be convicted of
attempting the violent overthrow of the government unless
there was scienter pro sent and unless she her self had the

27
actual inti sat to overthrow the government.

But, X think, in

terns of part two of the oath, the ,!I will oppose,” sho
could clearly be deemed in conflict by a prosecutor at any
tine, notwithstanding what ray brother

says, the twenty-year

history of non-prosooution in Massachusetts*
The test is not, I thick, lack of prosecution., it
is deterrence of First Amendment conduct, and I think that’s
the crucial issue hero.
Q

But it’s put purely in. personal terras.

It Is

not put at all in associations! or membership terms, just
as tho first part of the oath is put, purely in personal
terms, and in the future
MR* OLHSKEY:

tense*
X ogre© that it’s personal and futur Aw 5

but I don’t think there’d bo any bar to a prosecutor going
after

Mrs. Richardson for a violation of, at least, the

second portion, If she wore found to be a member of a group
like the one X suggested, which, In fact, had as one of its
tenets, though she might be unaware of it, or although she
might bo a. passive or inactive member and not oven in favor
of It, as the Court suggested in tho United States and Bohol,
decided several years ago, she could still bo prosecuted.
Thor©’a additional —
Q,

You say thoro'e come cases holding that?

VJhat ’ b your authority for that?

Because it seems to me quit©

far afield from th© words of this particular oath.

MR. OLESKirf:

My proposition is only

that in

terms of the words of the oath, requiring a futuro promise
of opposition,
Q

What she will do in the future?

HR, OLESKBY!
Q,

Yes,

What sh© personally will do»

MR. OLES&ET:

Yes.

A future association, or even

an association of the time she took the oath, which was
inconsistent because of some aim of that group, which was,
in fact, in favor of the violent overthrow of the government,
or, by illegal,, unconstitutional methods, a Massachusetts
prosecutor could prosecute lice. Richardson under the oath,
and I think that ehe would not, oven though she might be
sustained by this Court or some other court, eventually, she
would not be in a very effective position to argue,* as my
brother has suggested, that, well, after all, the oath in
only an amenity.

It didn't man. very ranch*

The stato con-

eiders it only an amenity, eo I don’t really have an obliga*tion to live up to the terms of that future promise,

If the

cath — this oath, or any other oath, is going to mean any­
thing in this country, then I think they have to be clear,
not vagtio, not broad, and straightforward, and this one isn’t.
Q,

What would you suggest?

What language would

yo.\, *u*=,gesv uq moot, that might meet your standards of
clarity, and lack of vagueness, and lack of breadth?

29

MR. OLESKEY:

The only standards which it would

appear would bo conelatent with what this Court has said,
would b© the language of the Connell oath, part one, or the
language required by the Constitution, ‘'support and uphold.11
Q,

This says, 'uphold and defend.1' Do you think

those words have any more precise meaning than the word
"oppose"?

HR* OLESKEY: Well -«
Q,

"Uphold and defend* "

HR. OLESKEY!
Q,

I think that "support" —

Well, that's not in this —

Ml* OLESKEYs

Or "uphold" have come to be traditional

words associated with a kind of minimal residuum of loyalty
Which wo have decided under the Constitution, in fact, in
Article YZ> Section 3? fms tho very beginning, wo've allowed,
under tho Constitution, to bo exacted from public employees
and public officers and tho like.
Something beyond that creates, clearly, on tho
decisions of this Court In "the- past, questions of unccmstitu»
tiDuality..
Q

Well, just as a matter of words, do you think

the words "uphold

and defend” or "uphold or defend" are *~

have more definitive and precise content than the word
"oppose?"

X grant you they're antonyms, but is one more

precise than tho other?

?

30
HR*

OLESKEY!

I

think

that ‘'uphold or support,"

which have boon read by the court below and by this Court,
I think, as roughly synonymous, have this historical context.
What you are saying is that you believe in the system for
which you are working, under which you live.

q

Well,

now, that,

1

thought you bold

uo,

would

be very constitutionally inv&lidafcive, if you are inquiring
about somebody’s beliefs.
MR * 0LSSKE5T;
Q

Well —

This is not doing that.

MR* OLESKEYs

If the question were open to mo for

the first time today, I think I would make a strong argument
that"support and uphold" certainly requires some affirmation
of belief.

However, I think this Court’s recent pronounce­

ments, including Connell and Higginbotham, leave that question
closed*

Q,
about "oppose ”

That doesn’t bother you at all in arguing
You think "oppose" is just in a different

world.

HR. OLESKEY:

1

think, in terms of future conduct,

and in terms of the number of variants of required conduct,
which the state itself has suggested in three yeara of this
case, that "oppose" appears to be much more elusive for all
of us than "support" or "uphold*"
Q,

Let me try another one on you, then., Mr. Oleakey.

31
What would you think of tho oath,

"That I do solemnly owesgc*

that, ao eat Attorney and Counselor of this Court, I will
conduct raysolf uprightly and according to law and that I
will support tho Constitution of the Unit ad States"?

v>o

you think that’ s any loss vague than ~~
MR* OLES&EY:

At least the last part of that,

"That

X will support the Constitution of tho united States clearly
doesn’t go any farther than, the Connell language cs* the
Constitutional language which we?ve bean discussing*
q

How about the language,

"I will conduct myself

uprightly"?
ME, CLE8KEY:

It seems to me that’s a. simple promi so

of conduct consistent with being on officer of a bar that
doesn’t necessarily go into ultimate philosophical or
political beliefs about the utility of this Court or any
other court.
Q,

If this doctor, your client,

wore

required

talc© that oath, would you have any trouble with it?
MR# OLESKEY:
Q

Would X, or would she?

You’re arguing the case.

MR» OLESSEY:
tho oath.

I would -- X personally would take

I don’t fool it’s inconsistent with, as X say,

with ultimate beliefs.
Cl

Would you

difficulty about taking

advise

her

that

there

that oath, to conduct

was any

herself

to

32

uprightly as a physician and surgeon, 02? whatever she may be?
HR. OLESKEY:
some*

I don't think that’s really trouble­

X think that goes to your conduct in a particular

profession, the rules of tho game#

If Massachusetts wan

suggesting hero that they’re trying to regulate all employees
because of setae security sensitivity involved, as tho
Federal government and other state governments have argued
in other cases, it would be a different situation, but there’s
no suggestion, by tho Commonwealth, today •— I don’t find any
in Ms brief

that such a broad oath, across the board,

affecting all employees, is necessary for security sensitivity,
or for the effective, orderly working of state government or
any other compelling state interest.

The record that the

Commonwealth has made seems to bo peculiarly bare of any
suggestion of the compelling state interest for this oath.
In fact, they suggested it is an amenity, as I say.

Strange

that they’d require it in that case.
Q

Let me try another oho on you.

What is your

reaction to an oath to this effect, "That I will, to the
boat of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend tho
Constitution of the Halted States

*

"Preserve, protect,

end defend *Si
MR. OLESKEY:

Well, I think that, clearly, in light

of our discussion in the last half-hour, that becomes a
narrower case, particularly with the uao of the word

"defend. 13

33
I gsq vagueness difficulties there, as 1 do with the word
’’defend" in clause one of the Massachusetts oath, hut —
Q,

You do see vagueness difficulties?

MR. OLESKEY:
q

In the word "defend."

Would it disturb you if -I told you that I was

reading from Article

Z

MR, OLBSKEY;

of tho Constitution?
I think X would allude now to my

previous conversation with Mr* Justice White and say that
there are contain oaths or general terms of support which
have boon with us since the beginning —*>
q

And that’s certainly not tho only vague

provision in tho Constitution, is it?
MR. OLES&EY:
Q

Ho, it’s not.

Justice Blackm.ua was reading tho oath that

the Constitution requires tho President of tho United States
to take, as you perhaps recognised.
MR* OLESKEYt

I can. only suggest again that, in

all honesty, the range of moaning a for "oppose," when set
aside, as it la here, in clause two, and not linked by
implication with ” support and uphold,*f as in tho Presidential
Oath that you road , does create much greater difficulties,
both in terms of vagueness and in terms of broadness of
deterring
Q

both speech end association.
So you

if it’s just an oath that says,

”X

will defend the Constitution, ” you have no great problems

34
on that?
HR. QLK3KEY;

Q,

I think

At this point?

MR. QLESKEYs

X think an oath that says ,fX will

defend the Constitution" is quite close to an oath that
simply says, HI will support the Constitution." They really
are similar.
Q.

And you would find trouble .if you said, "I

will defend the Constitution of the tMited States against
all enemies and against its overthrow by force and violence”?
MR. OLESKEiTt
Q,

Yes.

Then you’d have trouble with "defend"?

HR. OLESKEY:

Yes, because 1 think that we imported

more languagej we’ve imported, as in. this case, the govern-»
ment of Massachusetts, the United States government, force,
violence, illegal, unconstitutional methods, all of which
in a connection like the present one, moan that someone like
Mes. Richardson, as X say, not only has to assess her mm
conduct, but has got to make an assessment of somebody
else5a conduct, and action, and speech*
Q

Bo really, it's the context in which the word

"defendis used.
MR. OLESKEY:

Yes,

It ear?, bo, and X think it is

in this oath, although it ispartieularly the words "oppose
the overthrow " with which we find fault in this oath, not

the word ''defend
Q.

!l

You’re not suggesting that the Article 2 oath

because unconstitutional by the adoption of the First
Amendment?

MR* OLESSEY:
Q

Ho, Your Honor, I*m not*

All right*

MR* OLESSEY:

Very briefly, we male© in our brief

and I would make today, two other arguments.

One I hare, I

think, touched on, essentially, the vagueness argument, and
the difficulty, for ©sample, where Mrs. Richardson or any
other employ©© is faced with a sit-in by militants at the
St at ©house in Massachusetts, or at the Federal Courthouse,
or the Federal Building in Boston, which has happened
frequently in the years past.
How docs oh© know?

Is this an attempt at overthrow

Is she required to act?

to go and get a policeman?

Is oho required

Just what is she supposed to do?

I think the vagueness problems are clear enough to need, I
hope, no further exposition*
Eh© final point is that the statute violates duo
croceos as the Connell case construed it last tom, in that
it provides for no hearing for Mrs* Richardson or any other
employe© to show why she refuses to take the oath, no
opportunity to make a record to show that she la. merely, let
us say, a scrupulous, conscientious woman who feels, because
of the vagueness and ovorbroadth problems in this oath, that

36
sho can’t

in
q

good conscience* take it.
Was that raised and litigated in the three®

judge court?
MR. OLSSSEY:
Q

The particular problem of —-

Ho hearing?

ME* OLESKYi

Ho hearing, I don’t think it was*

Your Honor.
Q,

Yes.

q,

js there provision, either explicit or

Implicit, under this statute, for somebody to ~® somebody
who objects to taking oaths generally, to affirm, rather
than to take an oath?
MR. OLESKY:

The only provisions in the oath arc

those found in the oath, and it does say, in the first
sentence,

"I do solemnly swear or affirm."
Q

"dr affirm” bo there’s not —‘ that’s not an

issue in tho case.
MR. OLES&EY:
rather than a swearing.

Ho.

It could too an affirmance

Nonetheless, as I see it, tho

double penalty under the Massachusetts statute, both for
prosecution for perjury, which Section 14. explicitly refers
to, and, under Section l£ of the somo Chapter 26k for viola­
tion of the terms of tho oath, whatever that may bo, still
romsd.ru
Thank you*
