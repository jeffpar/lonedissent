P R O C E E D I H G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We Ml hear arguments next

in No. 71-5445, Shadwick against City of Tampa.

Mr. Reaneck.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL A* RE2NECK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. REZNECK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court?
This is an appeal from a decision of the Supreme
Court of Florida.

The court below upheld the constitutionality

of certain Florida statutes which authorise clerks of the
municipal court of the City of Tampa to issue arrest warrants
for parsons who are accused of violations of municipal
ordinances.
Q

It raises the issue ~~
Mr. Reaneck, let me know at the start, has Mr.

Shadwick ever been tried and convicted?
MB. REZNECKs
0

No, sir.

Well, do we have a final judgment here, then?

MR. REZNECK?

I believe that you do.

In the first

place, I think that counsel for the city, as I understand it,

at page 2 of his brief, does characterize this as a final
judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida.

I think that it is

a final judgment under State law, but —
Q

Is it a final judgment under federal statute?

MR. REZNECKx

I believe that it is.

This was

4
commenced as an independent proceeding by way of common-law
certiorari in- the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, which is
i

a court of general jurisdiction, to review .the decision of the
Municipal Court of Tampa# refusing to quash the "warrant in this
case.

And it was

the, writ;

of certiorari was denied and

that was affirmed by the District Court of Appeals and by the
•

•

;

c.

Florida Supreme Court, so that this common-law certiorari
proceeding, which is an independent and inseparable proceeding
under Florida law, is at an end.

And I think that that does

make this final for this Court5s purposes, as well.
In other words, it‘a not a part of the pending
criminal proceeding»
I would, in that connection, Your Honor, refer you to
this Court’s decision in Camara v. Municipal Court, the case
involving administrative searches in this Court, which involved
a writ of prohibition in advance of a trial for violation of a
municipal ordinance? and th© case came all the way to this
Court on the writ of porhibition without any factual record
or without any trial of the issue? and it was decided by this
Court and thereby deemad final.
So that 1 do think that under the test this Court
ha® laid down that you do have a final judgment under the
Judicial Code,
Q
Mr. Resneck?

Was that passed upon specifically

in Camara,

MR. REZNECKs

0

That particular issue?

Ye§.

MR. RB'SNSCKi

I do not believe that it was raised

and that the issue was litigated as to whether it was final
judgment or not; but since that.

X

suppose,, would be deemed a

jurisdictional matter for this Court, I think the fact that
this Court went on to decide fch® case does decide the
jurisdictional issue, at least by implication.
The appellant here was arrested in March of 1969 on
a warrant which charged him with violation of a Tampa ordinance
careless driving of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol
or a drug.

This warrant was applied for by a police officer

of the City of Tampa and it was issued by a deputy clerk of
the City of Tampa, who had been designated as a Clerk of the
Municipal Court.
The affidavit and the warrant appear at pages S and
7 of the Joint Appendix here.
This offense is triable in the Tampa Municipal Court
and it carries a penalty of not loss than five days nor more
than six months in jail, or a fine of not less than $230 or
more then $500, or both.
As I indicated, there was a motion to quash the
arrest warrant in the Municipal Court, which was denied, and
then the con

Law certiorari proceeding was brought in the

Circuit Court; it was denied there; affirmed by the Circuit

6

Court of Appeals and by the Florida Supreme Court,
The Florida Supreme Court opinion is at pages 41 to
43 of the Appendix, and the Florida Supreme Court held that
clerks and deputy clerks of the Municipal Court are author! 53 ed
under Florida law to issue arrest warrants,

and

it further

held that such clerk's:', are neutral and detached magistrates
under tha Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and X. asi quoting,
"by virtue of the Florida Statutes fixing their powers and
duties to issue arrest warrants♦"
Q

Tell me, Mr. Resnack, are these clerks permitted

sometimes to substituto for the judge, as an acting judge in
the trials of —
MR. REZNECKz

No, I don't believe so.

All trial

jurisdiction is lodged in tha Municipal Court judges.
Q

Only in tha judges?

MR. REENECKs

Q

Yes»

Of course, 1 know in my own State tha local

polleo magistrates, clerks, could, by statute, exercise
judicial powers of the police judges in certain instances,
when the police judge himself was absent? but that's not bo
In Florida?
MR. REZKECKj

SIo, as X understand the Florida laws,

the only judicial function which is provided to the clerk is
issuance of the arrest warrants..

For example, he does

uot ©van have the authority to issue a search warrant. That

7

is confined solely to the Municipal Court judges and of course
to other judges of the State of Florida; but it is —
Q

That's by virtue of the limitation that the

Florida Legislature imposed, is it not?
MR. REZNECK:
Q

Yes.

That’s correct.

In other words, they gave a limited quasi­

judicial power to the clerk?
MR. REZNECK:
Q

Yes, that is presicely right.

How is that very much different from what’s

done in the federal system?
MR. REZNECK:

Well, 1 think it is very much

different because the arrest warrant powers are lodged in
only — first of all, it must be lodged in a judicial officer
ia the federal system, and that moans either a federal judge
or a United States magistrate.

Those are the only officers

who constitute judicial officers for purposes of executing
processes in the federal system.
Q

How about commissioners, when we had commissioners

MR. REZNECK:
officers at that time.
Q

Well, the commissioners v;ere judicial
They operated under the —

Was there a time when the United States

Commissioners were not required to be lawyers?
MR. REZNECK: They were not required to be lawyers
until the United States Magistrates Act was passed in 1968.
Q

So that until 1988, would you say that the posfcur*

of a United States Commis si oner was very different from that
of the clerk exercising these functions in this case?

MR. EEZNECKs

Yes,

X

would say that it was, because

ha was clearly a judicial officer.

He was responsible solely

to the courts, he had a specified term of office, and in that
sense he had a guaranteed tenure.

It is true that soirra of them

were not lawyers, but that is only part of our argument here.
We do not rest this case at all on ~~
Q

Well, to whom is the clerk of the court

responsible, Mr. Resnack?
MR. RESNECK; Well, I think that it is not at all
clear from the Florida statutory structure, you have a kind of
mixed situation here.

He is actually a deputy city clerk,

and he is appointed by the city clerk who is the administra­
tive officer? he. has membership in the city civil service,
and in that sense he really is an administrator or an
executive officer.

Ha is designated by the city clerk to work

in the Municipal Court as a deputy Municipal Court clerk.
In that sense he is responsible or answerable, X suppose,
to the Municipal Court judges in his duties, but he also is
responsible to the city clerk, to whom he is a deputy.
So that you do not have, it seems to ms, a clear chain
of command here.» such as you do in the 0. s. Magistrates
aystem, and as you did under the 0. S. Commissioner system of
responsibility by the officer, solely to a judicial authority.

9
Q

You don't fchink this clerk is responsible solely

to judicial authority when he is performing quasi-judicial
duties?
MR. REZNECK: Well, what 1 meant was that in terms of
his job, the appointive power, his responsibilities also run
to the clerk who appointed hira.

I have no doubt that his

decisions on an arrest warrant could be reviewed, and in
fact an effort v/as sought to review them in this proceeding
before the municipal judge, after the fact, after the warrant
had been issued.
But what we are concerned about, I think, are his
status and his independence in exercising the j\idgment to
issue the warrant in the first instance.
In. other words, 1 don't think it's sufficient that
his decisions can be reviewed later on by way of quashing the
warrant before a municipal court judge.

I don't think that

that's what this Court contemplated when it spoke of an
independent judicial officer or-a neutral and detached
magistrate

issuing the warrant in the first instance.
Q

Well, is there anything that says he's not

r

neutral?
MR. REZNECK; Is there anything that says he's not
neutral?

No.

Pxid I don't fchink that

Q

Is there anything that says he’s not detached?

He's certainly not connected with the police deepartment?

10
MR. RSZNECKs

No, we're not alleging that he's

connected with the police department.

But we So not think that

this case ought to turn on an inquiry into whether a particular
clerk or deputy clerk is impartial or neutral or detached
or capable as an individual9 of having those qualities»

I

think that the problem about the Florida procedure here is not
personal, really, but it's institutional in the sense that the
clerk has not bear, given the kind of status, independence,
there are:.:no qualifications for the office which would allow
him to exercise these

powers in the manner contemplated by

this Court.
Q

Well, I doubt that the Florida statute has any

limitation on the ability of a magistrate.
MR. RE2NECK2 Well, the magistrate is clearly a
judicial officer.
Q

But they don’t say what he has to be.

MR. REZNECKs
Q

Well —

‘they don’t say he has to be detached, does it?

MR. REZNECK: No, but I think that the assumption of
detachment or the inference ~~
Q

Well, what does the statute say about detachment?

MR. RE2NECK:

It doesn’t deal with the point of

detachment in those words, but I

Q

■—

If it did, it would be different from any State

I’ve ever heard of

Ii
MR. REZNECK;

Mo, I think the inference of detachment

entirely arises from the fact that he is clearly a judicial
officer.

Xn other words, he has a guaranteed tenure in

office, for example, a municipal court, judge has a four-year
terra in office.

He is a judge*

He does perform judicial

functions.
Q

Well, how long does the clerk have?

ME. REZNECK:
0

Pardon me?

How long does the clerk have?"'-—.

MR. REZNECK: The clerk is under —is a civil service
employee.

As a municipal court clerk in terras of exercising

this arrest warrant function he does not have a specified
tenure in office.

In other words, ha is a civil service

employee who has been given this particular function to
exercise.
Q

Well, I still don't see the tie-in between him

acting as a magistrate and acting as a clerk.
MR. REZNECK: Well, his primary duties are clerical
duties, and they are the usual duties that one would associate
with a clerical job.

He has been given this one particular

judicial function.
Q

Well, suppose Florida says that the deputy cleric

of any county may also act as magistrate?
MR. REZNECK: Xn effect that's what Florida has dona
here.

That's what the Florida Supreme Court did.

Giving him

12
the title of magistrate without giving him any of the status
of a judge, without changing his essential status from that
of a clerical officer —
Q

You keep saying "the status of a judge'5,, the

magistrates are not judges.
MR. RE2NECK: They do not have the name of judges,
J*

they do not have the title of judges, but they —
Q

And they don't have the authority of judges.

MR. REZNECK:

Wall., 1 think that they exercise

judicial authority, they have a guaranteed tenure in office,
there are limitations as to the power of removal over them —
Q

Is that true in Florida?

MR. REZNECK:

Yes, the magistrates, such as the

municipal court judges, have a four-year term.

They are

elected and have a four-year term? justices of the peace —•
Q

But no

MR. REZNECK:

qualifications required?
In Tampa they have to be members of the

bar.
Q

Magistrates?

MR. REZNECK:

Yes.

Municipal court judges.

Q

That’s in advance.

Q

Does Florida law require that all magistrates

with authority to issue warrants must be lawyers?
MR. REZNECK:

No,

Under a new constitution which is

going to go in, which has been approved in Florida and will

13
become effective several years from now, all judges with the
exception of county judges,: in counties with small population,
below a specified limit, will have to be members of the bar.
That's ~~

j
i

Q

___

Who issues warrants in felony cases in Florida?

Or does it vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction?
MR. RBKNECK t

Under the Florida rules of criminal

procedure, as 1 understand them, either a felony or a miss'

demeanor warrant may be executed, may be issued by one who is
defined as a committing magistrate under the rules, and
committing magistrates include all the judges and magistrates
of the courts of Florida, down to and including municipal
court judges, and the justices of the peace.
However, they do not include court clerks for this
purpose, so you have rather a paradoxical situation here.
Therefore a felony or for a misdemeanor warrant,which is a
far more serious offense, there, would have to be an independent
judicial determination by a judge or magistrate.

In other

words, by an officer in whom the Florida Constitution vests
judicial power, but only for a violation of a municipal ordin­
ance is a deputy clerk or a clerk of the court, who is not a
judicial officer and does not have judicial power under the
Florida Constitution, only for that kind of warrant can he
act to issue it, and as I said he could not do it for a search
warrant either.

So .it seems to ms that you have a rather strange and
anomalous situation here where, for more serious offenses and
for search warrants , Florida clearly does carry out the purpose
of this Court’s decision and provides for an independent
judicial determination before any such warrant should issue.
But for municipal ordinances they part from it and in this
one instance they do authorize the clerk to do it.
Q

Mr. Re3neck, for Fourth Amendment purposes,

if a police officer had looked over the facts here and thought
that there was probable cause to arrest and went out and
arrested without a warrant at all, whatever the situation
might be under Florida law, what about the Fourth Amendment?
MR. RE2NECK; Well, X think that would involve the
question, what —
Q

Let’s both assume for the moment that there

was clearly probable cause.
MR. REZNECK:

Yea.

He could not do that under Florida

law.
Q

I’m not ““ how about the Fourth Amendment?

MR. RE53NECK:

Yes«

Well, 1 think that v/ould require

the decision by this Court, which 1 don’t believe has been
made as to what the probable cause requirements of the Fourth
Amendment are with respect to municipal ordinances.

I think

at common law it would be that, where you’re dealing with an
offense of that character, that the- arrest power of an officer

IS
without a warrant would be limited to a situation where It was
committed in his presence»
Q

Well, that was at common law, what about the

general proposition of the police being able to arrest without
a warrant, when there is probable cause?
MR. REZNECK:

X think that there is legislative

authority in some situations, certainly, and X know it has been
exercised here in the District of Columbia, to give the police
the authority to arrest on probable cause for certain
mis dame ano rs.
Q

What about the States?

MR. REZNECK;

1 assume that there are similar

statutes in the State, and X think that that power would
Q

Well, would you say that that's unconstitutional?

MR. REZNECK:

Mo.

No, I don't think so.

1 think

that there would be a power in the Legislature to define a
reasonable search or seizure to that extent; but X would point
out we're not dealing with that here, because Florida hasn't
purported to do that.
Q

In other words, it —

Well, it's purported to say that a clerk can

determine probable cause and authorise an arrest.
MR. REZNECK;

Yes, but it requires a 'warrant.

In

other words, this is an arrest warrant which is required here
under the State law.
Q

But you would say Florida could authorise the

police® the Florida Legislature could authorise police thernsalv
to determine probable cause and make an arrest?
MR. RS2NECKf For this kind of offense. I'm not sure
that I would want to concede that, because I don't think that
we're dealing with this kind of offense that you have this sort
of necessity that might justify that practice, even for a
serious misdemeanor.
Q

For a felony, you would

MR. RE2NECK: Well, for a felony, I think it's clear
under the common-law and under the Fourth Amendment which
incorporated the common law rule that a police officer can
arrest on probable cause without a warrant for a felony.
Q

But, he may not clo so for a less serious,

municipal offense?
MR. RE2JNECK:

Well, certainly at common law he

I think there might foe a legislative power to vary

could not.

the common law rule in the instance of certain misdemeanors,
whether, when, you get down to the municipal ordinance level,
that power would also extend, I don't think it's really
necessary to decide here.

As I say? Florida has not purported

to do that.
In other words, here you are dealing with an arrest
warrant.

It's a Fourth Amendment warrant.
Q

The Florida court here has said that under

Florida law the clerk is sufficiently independent to perform

17
this function, as a matter of Florida law, I gather.
MR. REZNECRj
Q

In their opinion? anyway.

MR. RE8MECKs
Florida

Well, X think that that is —

That is a conclusion, drawing from the

Supreme Court.
Q

Yes *

Yes•

MR. REZNECKs

X don't believe that it's possible to

point to anything in the Florida statutory structure which
anything objective, which would give the clerk the kind of
independence that a judge has.
0

There’s nothing in the statute that indicates he

isn’t, either, or that the Florida Supreme Court is wrong, as
a matter of judicial judgment, in vesting this clerk with some
independence?
MR. RE2NECK; Well, I think that you have here a
supervening federal question, it seems to me, under the Fourth
Amendment, as to who is a neutral and detached officer for
Fourth Amendment purposes,
Q

Yes.

MR. REZNECK: And that's a federal question.

X

don't think that the Florida Supreme Court can decide that.
In effect, they have given their opinion.

They are satisfied

that he is a neutral and detached magistrate? but X don’t
think it’s possible to point to anything in the Florida
statutes here that would give him this kind of independence and

IS
stature that a United States Magistratef for example, has? or
that other judicial officers in Florida have, or that judicial
officers elsewhere in the United States who issue warrants have,
Q

Well, tell me again, then, what is the source

of his authority to be issuing a warrant?

From what does it

derive?
MR. REZNECK?

From the statutes of Florida; one

statute of general applicability, which gives clerks of the
Municipal Court the authority to issue warrants in municipal
ordinance cases.

And then from two specific statutes

applicable in Tampa, which are part of the Tampa City charter.
Q

Well, isn't that a legislative decision that

these are proper officers, as Justice White suggested?
MR. REZNECK:

Oh, absolutely, we are dealing with a

legislative act hare, we do not deny that, and we are
challenging the constitutionality of that statute on its face,
the grounds that it isn't sufficient for the Legislature
just to say that somebody who is a clerical person is, ipso
facto, a neutral and detached magistrate because we've chosen
to give him the power to issue arrest warrants and have said
that ho is a neutral and detached magistrate.
In other words, that's really all that you have here.
You have a statute that has confided to function but has not
confided or conferred any of the protection that we would
normally associate with the holding of judicial office.

It’s

19
giving him only this one judicial function, it isn’t as if it
had given him a whole range of judicial functions.

It cer­

tainly has not called him a judge or a magistrate.

And while

I would not suggest that the title is dispositive, I would
point out, Your Honor, that one of the reasons why the term
U. S. Commissioner was changed by Congress to '0. S. Magistrate
was because the title of U. S. Magistrate connoted that he was
a judicial officer and they were conferring judicial authority
on him.
Florida hasn't done any of these things, nor has
the Florida Supreme. Court.

They have simply said, “We're

satisfied that ha is a neutral and detached magistrate."
Q

As you say, Mr. Resneck, you're not, of course

you're not, relying on the title,;.oru label of clerk, but
you're rather relying on the nature of this man's job and
duties and position.
MR. REZNECK:
Q

.
Yes.

Where does that appear in the record?

I've

looked for it, and 1 ~MR. REZNECK:
Q

Well, ~

1 gather that what yon say is correct, that

this is the only — that this authority to issue arrest
warrants for violations of municipal ordinances is the only
power, the only duty ha has in his job to perform any tasks
that have traditionally been considered judicial tasks. But

20
do wo have anywhere here what the job content is?
MR. RBSNECK:

Yes..

It's not in the record before yon,

1 believe, it is contained in various places in the City Code,
in the City Charter of Tampa, and various civil service
regulations,

And his functions are predominantly, and, I would

say, in fact entirely clerical, with the exception of this
one function.
Q

Well, does he file papers and keep track of

them?
MR, REZNECK:
Q

He receives papers for filing and —

Or does he attend in the courtroom and act as

a bailiff?
MR. REZNECKs Some of them do that,, yes.
Q

Or what does he do?

MR. RE3NECX:

He receives fines, for example, and

gives receipts for fines in traffic cases; he prepares the
dockets and the records; he issues the commitment once a judge
has ordered, has imposed a sentence on someone, the deputy
clerk makes out the commitment papers, and —
Q

The equivalent of a clerk's office in any —~

MR. REZNECK:
Q

Yes, in any court.

~~ court, this Court or any court?

MR. RESNECK:

Yes.

And more specifically, I would

say, in any police court or any municipal court in the
country that you will find —

21
Q

The fact of fines paid, and disbursements, and

MR. RESWECKs

He will note if the case is continued

for trial, and so on»
Q

Is he in charge of the payroll for the court?

MR. REZNECK: That I don't know.

1 think the City

Clark probably would have that function, 1 don't believe that
this —
Q

Does he issue subpoenas?

MR. REZNECK:

Yes.

He is, X believe, entitled to

issue subpoenas.
Q

Mr. Resneck, if Florida, by legislation, could

authorise a policeman to arrest if their® were in fact probable
cause in this situation without a warrant, and if in fact there
is probable cause, in this case, do you have really a Fourth
Amendment point, simply because the policeman has taken a
warrant issued by a clerk that made a finding of probable
cause?
MR. REZNECK: Well, I think that you do, because I
think that Florida has utilised the arrest warrant procedure
here, and it has made a determination that it's not proper
for a policeman to arrest simply on probable causa for offenses
not committed in their presence.
In other words, -Q

That's a State law point, isn't it?

MR. RESNSCK:

Yes.

Well, not entirely. For example,

in the Brophy case, as I recall, Br ophy vWi scons 1 n , which
dealt with the right to a change of venue in a misdemeanor case...
I think this Court said that it was not passing on the question
as to whether he would have had, for example, a jury trial
right as an original matter? but they said that the State had
provided a jury trial right, and once they did that, that that
invoked the partial trial guarantee of the Federal
Constitution through the Fourteenth amendment, and therefore
they could not provide for such a transfer of venue in a
felony case, but not in a misdemeanor case.
So 1 think it is of significance that the State has
elacted to utilise the familiar arrest warrant procedure.
In other words, you really are dealing here with what I would
call, frankly, an ordinary garden variety arrest warrant.
There is no, nothing innovative that Florida has done here,
in the sense of deciding that they will extend the common law
arrest powers of police.

They have directed the policemen,

as would be true all over this country, to go and got a warrant
in this kind of situation.
We would submit that that is sufficient to make it
a Fourth Amendment warrant, and to invoke the decisions of
this Court which do require that, as I understand them, he foe
a judicial officer,
Q

Mr, Eezneck, how would you categorise the

power to issue a warrant — a subpoena, rather, as distinguished

from a warrant?
I think that that would be called

MR.

a ministerial power, it would not be classified as a judicial
power, because you do not have the elements of discretion and
judgment that enter into the warrant decision.

Certainly

it is not a Fourth amendment type of decision where this
Court, has made it clear that where you're dealing with the
question of probable cause -to arrest a person -Q

Well, then, when we consider the traditional

language of the subpoena, it usually has the archaic form of
speakings

"You, the undersigned, are directed to appear

before a particular court at a time and. place, laying aside
all other business", and sometimes it will recite "on pain of
penalties of the law for failure to appear".

Row, you seem

to dismiss that as a ministerial duty?
MR. REZNECKs

No, I don't dismiss it.

In fact, if

Florida has provided for such a system here, to wit, a summons
or subpoena system, I don't think we would be her© today,
because I don't think we would have the same problem.

In other

words, that does not effectuate an arrest, that is a summons
or subpoena to appear.

It does not result in the defendant

being bodily taken into court.

He, of course, has got the right

to come in? he has the option to come or not to come, but he
can come in and try to challenge the process.
In other words, if what you had here was utilized as

24
simply a summons or subpoena procedure issued by the clerk,
I think you would have an entirely different case, because then
you would not have an arrest of the person.

It’s the fact that

t his is an arrest warrant which authorized the police officer
to take the defendant immediately into custody and with all
that that implies, in terms of loss of liberty, having to post
bail, possible embarrassment or humiliation in terras of
employment and his family, and of course an arrest record.
All those consequences flow from what happened here, because
it was an arrest warrant rather than a summons or a subpoena
procedure»
So that I think that the subpoena or summons procedure
— particularly where you’re dealing with municipal ordinances?
in other words, these are not emergency situations, these are
not serious crimes in the sense of felonies, where you can
dispans© with the warrant altogether.

1' think that’s really

the proper v?ay to proceed»
In that connection, I would like to direct Your Honors
attention to the decision of the Supreme Court of Minnesota in
the Paulick case, which we’ve cited both in our brief and in
our reply brief, and the Court there -took precisely that •
position:
through

e.

that the proper way to proceed in these cases was
summons procedure, if it was too burdensome on the

judges to issue arrest warrants, but that it' would not be
constitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments for

25
a deputy clerk in. Minnesota to issue arrest warrants*
Q

Mr* Resneck, if this Florida statute — X'm

looking at your brief at page 3 — in that third line , after
where it says "and may issue a warrant" —
MR. RE25NECKs
Q

Yes*

Is that where — and had in there, "and may

on a finding of probable cause issue a warrant”, what would
your position be?
MR. RESPECK:
Q

As far as the clerk is concerned?

Yes o

Just change this statute by adding "on a finding of
probable cause"?
MR. RESNECK:

Well, our position would be exactly

the same, because the Florida courts have read in a requirement,
and I think this case does it, that the clerk must find
probable cause*

I think it would clearly be unconstitutional

if :lfc made it a ministerial duty, where he had to issue the
warrant.

X don’t understand Florida as going quite that far.
But that wouldn't make any difference, because our

point would be that a clerk does not have the status of a
judicial officer to make that determination.
Q

And 1 take it your position would be the same if

the statute said only that the "clerk may exercise the powers
of the local magistrate insofar as he may administer an oath,
take an affidavit" and so forth, "and issue a warrant".; what

26
would you think of that?
MR* REZNECKs
oath.

Oh, 1 think he could administer the

1 think if it*s simply —
Q

Uof but if the statute said that the ‘’clerk may

exercise the powers of a local magistrate” in these respects?
MR. RE2NECK:
different.

Then I don't think it would be any

I think it would be the same case.
Q

You would still be here?

MR. RE2NECK;

Yes.

That they would be confiding

to the clerk a judicial determination of probable cause,
without giving him any of the status or qualifications of an
independent judicial officer.
Q

And that they could not do that.

You mean they'd have at least to go so far as to

say “the clerk, in the absence of the magistrate, may perform
the functions of the magistrate", period?
MR. RE2NECK: Well, if the functions of the magistrate
extended to issuing arrest warrants or search warrants, 1
would say the clerk could not do that, could not be given the
power, and —
Q

lie couldn't be designated an acting magistrate

in the absence of, either?
MR, REZNSCKs

Not without more? not if he remained,

simply a clerk and was not given any additional status, any
additional protections in office.
the label

That would simply be changing

Q

As X suggested earlier# if that3s right# then

that whole system in New Jersey is —
MR. RE2NECKj Well# New Jersey is one of the few State
X might say# that does authorise its clerical personnel to
issue arrest warrants *

There would only be a relatively few

States, X think no more than si» or seven# that authorise this,,
Q

Well, New Jersey still goes as far as you

suggested, to permit the clerk to actually function as the
magistrate in the absence of?
MR. REZNECK:

yes, I believe they do.

But, of course

the New Jersey statute, with respect to the warrant procedure,
t

goes quite far in a number of respects.

For example, it

authorizes the issuance of arrest warrants by police chiefs,
police officers in charge of police stations.

In other words,

■the parts that 1 think are already invalid in the light of
this Court's decision in Coolidge vs. New Hampshire, this
isn't adding very much to that, in our view.
As X said, there really is a paradoxical situation
here, where, for the municipal — violation of a municipal
ordinance, which is presumably the least serious of offenses
in the State, that here a deputy clerk of the Municipal Court,
which is the court at the bottom of the judicial pyramid, is
authorised to issue the arrest warrant? but for any other
offense, no other clerk in Florida is authorized to do so.
And I think what that suggests is that you do not

28
have a very fundamental State policy here in favor of the
issuance of such warrants by clerical personnel.
If I have any time left, Your Honor, X would like to
reserve it for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think you've consumed it

all, but we'll see what the situation is, Mr. Re2neck.
MR. RE2NECK:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bee.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD H. BEE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. BEE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
First X would like to go to the appellant's argument
concerning, in the very last portion of his brief and on
argument here, as concerns this appellant in relationship to
the issuance of a summons to come to court? in other words, am
invitation.
In this sense, the appellant in this case of course
was charged, he has not b^en tried, was only charged, and then
immediately the proceedings commenced.

So he has not been

tried or convicted.
Q

What was the offense?

MR. BEE: The offense was under the ordinance called
generally "careless driving while drinking", which is a phrase
they use, but more specifically "careless driving while his

ability to drive is impaired by the use of alcohol or a drug83»
But they shortened that and call it "careless driving while
drinking"„
Now, this is a violation of, and one of the more
serious violations of our municipal ordinances.

In other

words, we’re covering an area here, and you have to realise
it’s all the way from a parking ticket, speeding, stop light,
all the way on through up to the more serious offenses, such
as this one.

Q

In Tampa, do you have to get a — does the

policeman have to get a warrant to issue a parking ticket?
MR. BBSs
features.

No, sir.

That is one of the distinguishing

Of course, if a parking ticket is issued and the

fine is not paid, then they are summoned to court.

There is a

difference here between this typo of offense and ones that
are less offensive, those that do not outwardly, what you would
call, jeopardise life and property.
Summons.

The appellant was arrested on this

particular offenso, and if you accept what appellant is saying
here, that he should be summoned rather than arrested on the
street, that is, invited to court, what we are concerned here
with is a situation where last year, throughout the entire
United States, 28,000 deaths occurred by reason of drunken
drivers.
Now, that is not to mention the ones that were maimed

30
and injured» , 28,000 deaths caused by drinking drivers.
Now, that’s a small city annihilated.
Now, if you accept appellant's argument that he
should h& summoned and invited rather than arrested in this
particular case, what you’re really saying is that if the
officer sees the man driving the automobile down the road,
cars going every which-way, the drunken driver weaving from
side to sice, he pulls the man over, he stops him.
opens, the man falls out.

The door

He writes down a summons, fears

it off and says, "Here is your summons, now you go home, sober
up, and appear in court tomorrow morning*”
In effect, this is saying if you use a summons
system, not in the parking ticket kind of situation, —
Q
door, and the

Well, what is clone in Tampa?
man falls out.

MR. BEBs
Q

The man opens the

Yes.

Then what does the policeman do in Tampa?

MR. REE: Then what he does is ho picks him back up
and they call the paddy wagon. Your Honor, and they take him
down and they put him in a drunk tank for approximately four
hours, if ha is unable to manipulate himself whatsoever.
Q

Well, that’s not at issue hare at all, is it?

MR. BEE:

Q

Ko, sir.

Well, where do you get this idea about him,

going out and keep on driving?.

31
MR. BEEs Well? because appellant has argued, and in
aid gi

man a summons rather

than arrest him on fchs street, because by arresting him on the
street what you are doing, the appellant says, ~~
Q

I thought appellant's position was that you

couldn’t that warrant unless you got it from a judicial
officer.

Period.
MR. BESi

Yes, sir, that is his issue.

There is no

I am only stating, starting with the

question about that.

summons portion, that this type of offense, you just can’t
use a summons, Your Honor, because this way you don't physically
arrest him and leave him in jeopardy on the street.
Q

We.11, why can’t you give him a summons when he

gets out of the tank?
MR. BEE ; Why can you not?
Q

Yes, sir.

MR, BEEs Well, sir, because once you physically
place a person under custody, when the police officer takes
that man and puts him in custody, that, technically, is an
arrest, even though he doesn't say "You are under arrest” or
even if the man doesn’t understand it.
Q

Once a police officer •—

If I understand you correctly, this man was put

in the tank —
MR. BEEs

No, air; I'm not saying that this particu

lar man was put in the tank

Q

Well, didn’t you say any drunken driver is put

in the tank?
MR. BEE j

X am saying if he is so inebriated that he

can’t control himself, he’s put in the drunk tank.
Q

All right.

MR. BEE i

If he is not, he is not put in the tank,

sir.
Q

If he is, and he's put in the tank, you say you

go get a warrant from the deputy clerk and. arrest him after
that.

Right?
MR. BSE:
Q

No, sir.

I am saying

Well, you couldn't go get the arrest warrant

while the man was laying Out in the street, could you?
Let's get this straight now-.
MR. BSE:

Yes, sir.

What do you do?
If the man is there, he is

arrested, on the street.
Q

Right.

• MR. BEE:

He does not go back, because the officer

has observed the offense with his own five senses.

Therefore,

it is a warrantless arrest.
Q

And then he never gets a warrant after that?

MR. BEE:

No, Your Honor, but he doe3 write up a

complaint, where he puts down the various factors that he has
observed.

To answer your question:

there on the street

Yes, sir, he is arrested

S3
Q

Well* then the point is that what vre’re talking

about is where it’s not in the policeman’s presence?

Is that

what we’re talking about in this ca.se?
MR* BEE:

I’m not saying that in this case, because

in this case we don’t know from the record what it is.

This

case, I wish 2 did know and I wish I could answer your
question, Your Honor, but, on the record, and the original
record as filed here, commences as the appellant started this
case, which is a motion to quash the original affidavit and
warrant.
Q

Well, pursuing brother Marshall’s questions,

in what kind of cases is this applicable?

When a policeman

hears and sees and/or smalls and touches, is using his five
senses, knows that an offense is committed in his presence,
then he arrests the person and this procedure ia not applicable
at all, as I understood your answers to Justice Marshall’s
questions.

Is that right?
&nd that this warrant procedure is applicable only

where there’s a complaining witness or something like that who
comas to a policeman *»MR. BEEs
Q

Yes, sir.
or comes to the deputy clerk? is that it?

MR. EEE: What you are saying is true, unless the man
is incarcerated, posts bail.

officer does ;

Then the police

t, another complaint, and he goes

down and makes out a re-arrest warrant, suqh as involved in
this case it the man is immediately re-arrested, but in the
original arrest it was the violation on the street initially
that was really the arrest.
So it can have —

Q

And there was no warrant at all in that?

MR. BBS:

No, there was no warrant for that at all,

no, sir.
So f the answer to your question can be in two ways %
.

’.j

•

•

a warrant can issue as a re-arrest, but —
Q

Or as an original arrest, if it was not —

MR. BEE;

Or as an original arrest if it was not in

the officer's presence.
Q

Right.

Q

Incidentally, who is the marshal under?

office is that?

What

The marshal.

MR. BEE:
Q

Right.

Yes, sir.

Does he —

MR. BSE:

168.04, which is the general statute, I

think that you are referring to, is in two severable parts.
The first part dealing with the clerk, and the second part
dealing with the "marshal may issue a warrant in the absence

35
of the cleric and the mayor".
Q

Yes, hut who is the marshal under?

MR. BEE:

Now, in Tampa, we do not have a marshal.

We have a chief of police.
police.

This is the general law.

We have, by our — a chief of

The marshal dees not — wall, we simply don’t have a

marshal in Tampa.
Q

Well, isn't the marshal a policeman wherever

they have a marshal?
MR. BSE:

Yes, sir.

But the general law which

provides that runs throughout for all the municipalities of
the State of Florida, whether they be in population of, say,
200 people.

In that case, obviously, the Legislature has to

take care of the small municipalities as well as the I’arger
ones „
Q

Well, this statute, then, means that not only

the clerk, but,in the absence of the cleric and the mayor, then
the police officer may issue a warrant for the arrest of the
person complained against; is that right?
MR. BEE:

Yes, sir.

That is true under the general

law.
Now, the point is this, and this is a point that
bothers me also.

This particular statute is in two parts,

and the obvious intent of the Legislature, in passing that
second sentence, involving the marshal, is the fact that oftentimes in your small towns, not always, the town may only have

\
36
a mayor, one clerk, and one marshal; and it v?ould not he
unusual for the mayor and the clerk to be gone at the same
time in one day.

Now, you just can’t let law enforcement fall

down for the one day that the clerk happens to be gone or the
mayor's out of town.
Q

But the clerk issued the one here, didn't he?

MR. BEE:
clerk.

But

that’s it.

This case involves the

In any event, if the Court goest to that second

sentence, involving a marshal,and would by dictum hold it
unconstitutional or whatever, it is severable from the first
sentence which deals with the Clark, which is the case here.
Now, the State of Florida, as has been referred to
before, has passed a revision of its judicial article, its
Article V, consolidating its judiciary especially in the trial
court system to more adequately keep up with caseload.
But tho point is that this question may become moot by 1977«
It provides in that Article that the municipal courts shall be
abolished by the year 1977.

The City of Tampa has filed v?ith

Chief Justice Roberts, Supreme Court of Florida, a resolution
of intent? a resolution of intent to abolish its municipal
courts by the end of this year.

That would be January 1st of

1973.
What, in effect, I am saying is simply this:

that

all these municipal courts and their clerks will be abolished
by 1977? Tampa is moving to do so by 1973.

Q

That wouldn't affect the applicability of the

statute to other parts of Florida, though, would it?
MR, BBS:

No, sir, it would not.

But 1 felt, in

justice, this should be pointed out to the Court and brought
to the Court's attention, that Tamp© is moving in this direc­
tion, and that the clerks —
Q

You mean abolished or renamed?

MR. BEE: They will be —
Q
court there.

Certainly you're going to have a municipal
Well, where are you going to try the traffic

violations?
MR. BEEs
Q

Ho, sir, —

You're going to give them up?

MR. BEE:

No, sir.

What will happen, when X say

abolish the municipal court, they will be transferred to what
is called —
Q

Well, that's what 1 thought.

ME. BEE:

Yes, sir.

They will be transferred to

what's called a county court, and these municipal judges will
then become State judges, and these clerks will then become
State clerks.
Now, there is — there are same issues that ware
raised as side issues in the appellant's brief concerning
the conclusory terms of the affidavit, its forum, the rubberstrap arguments, and simply the insufficiency of the affidavit.

I would merely show the Court, if it looks at the
original motion to quash and the order of the first municipal
judge, that what appellant originally attacked in this case
is the constitutionality of these particular statutes, vesting
the power in the cleric to issue these warrants.
Furthermore, there was never a question of;
determine probable cause?

did he

The question attacked the power of

the clerk in the first instance.

If you look at the order in

the municipal court, you will find that it was submitted,
really, as a question of law to the court.

The appellant

did not produce or question probable cause or the conclusory
terras or form.

There was no testimony of Officer Larder, the

arresting officer? there was no testimony given by the
appellant; there was no testimony of the clerk; and there was
no testimony taken of any other witness in this cause.
In other words, the question of the affidavit or
*'dicl he determine probable cause?n was never an issue.
.This is borne out on certiorari to the Circuit Court
which was the next step.

And again there were four specific

places that the appellant put directly in question the issues
that were raised and are here.

And on page 8 of my brief, I

show the Court that this position said, and the position
taken by appellant;
*’The position taken by the petitioner in the origina
brief is that the City Charter did not authorise the Clerk to

39

issue'an arrest warrant.K
Then on page 14 ■— this is on page 14 of the Appendix
the appellant says again:

"So we are here today solely on the

question of the constitutionality of both statutes*"
Appellant says again on page 14 of the Appendix:
BXt is the contention of the Petitioner that a Clerk of the
Court is an administrative officer and not empowered to
*

exercise any discretion.”
And then he goes on again to re-emphasize to that
Circuit Judgef quote, ,5Wa are dealing here with whether or not
a particular officer can exercise judicial functions."
Q

Mr. Bee, in this connection, do you agree with

Mr. Rezneek that we have a final judgment in this case under
1257 of Title 23?
MR. BEE:

Q

You do?

MR. BSE:
Q

Yes, sir, I think —

I do.

And you do so on the ground that this common

law writ of certiorari you have In Florida equates with the
writ of prohibition or something of this kind?

MR. EES:

Yes, Your Honor, I think that would be

sufficient to bring it un in the cause determined by the
Supreme Court of Florida, in particular dealing with the
issues, that it would be classified as a final judgment.
Q

And yet Mr. Shadwick may be acquitted in his

40
case?
MR. BEE:

Very — he could be.

He could be.

What,

in essence, is this, this is not an appeal from a conviction
of Mr. Shadwick.

Mr. Shadwick was arrested, then immediately

the motion was filed with the Municipal Court, then certiorari,
then appeal to the District Court of Appeals, and then to the
Supreme Court of Florida.
Q

Well, suppose it were a motion to suppress

evidence, made in advance of trial? what happens in your
system? .Do yon have a common law writ of certiorari there?
MR. BEEz

Yes.

In the State of Florida, the essential

requirements of law, or if the defendant feels that the court
has not performed within the essential requirements of lav;,
ha has a right to common law writ of certiorari to the Circuit
Court? from there he can fake it to the District Court of
Appeals, and then to the Supreme Court of Florida.
Q

Isn’t this a handy State way to avoid our usual

barrier of the finality of judgment?
MR. BEE;

Yes, sir, it is usually a way to avoid that

in the finality of judgments: that’s true.

This is one of

the
Q

I’ll confess•' 'that I, for one, arn bothered by

this issue in your case,

It’s really your opponent’s problem,

not yours.
MR. BEE:

Yes, air, 2 understand.

In the record

itself, in the Appendix, you will find, when I argued before
Judge Sell McMullen, at the Circuit Court level, on certiorari,
I argued the wrong remedy.

That was

1 do not have the page

in the Appendix, because it was not in my brief —
Q

That’s all right.

MR. BEE:

but it is, X did argue the remedy

problem, that it should not go up by certiorari originally.
Q

Mr. Bee, supposing that Mr. Shadwick had not

wanted to file a special writ of certiorari, end had simply
gone to trial, would he, at some time during the trial
proceedings, have had an opportunity to raise the validity of
the warrant as a part of those proceedings?
MR, BEE:

Yes, Your Honor.

In other words, once he

has raised this and it is in his record and he has the order
of denial, this goes with him up the scale.

Be can —• if he

is convicted, sea, ha will never appeal to the Circuit Court,
and the only way ha’s going to use the appellate proceduresof the Circuit Court is if ho is convicted.
Nov;, suppose Mr. Shadwick filed the regular motions
ho did her®, they were denied, he went to trial, he vjas
convicted, then he would use the appellate procedure to fch®
Circuit Court, and ha would have in his appeal the assignments
of error, that being, l.e., the denial of his motion in the
lower court.

Q

Mr. Bee, assuming that attack is made on the

search warrant in Florida, could you take that all the way up
here, the same way, before trial?
MR. BEE 2

I believe the normal approach of attacking

validity of the search warrant and the affidavit, that if the
motion is filed and the judge denies it ~~
Q

No, my hypothetical is using the exact same

♦

proceedings used in this case.
Is that possible?

In Florida.

MR. EESt’* X would —- Your Honor, that's a hard
question' to answer.

I think — I think it would be. And the

reason X say °1 think" —
Q

Well, my question is:

if we rule with the

petitioner in this case, then every preliminary motion in any
criminal case comes right straight up here, before the man is
ever brought to trial?
MR. BEE:

It could possibly very vrell do that way

by common law writ of certiorari? if the appellant claims that
the essential requirements of law have not been followed, than
he can go by writ of certiorari and on up to this Court.
Q

Like my brother Blackmun, I've got problems, too.

MR. BEE:
Q

Yes, sir.

Well, this is, however, an independent action,

as X understand it, under Florida law, equivalent or roughly
similar, at least, to action for a declaratory judgment, and
an injunction, or for a pretrial habeas corpus, which is

43
historically veil known,
MR. BBS;

You’re talking about the writ of

certiorari?
Q

Yes „

MR. BBS;
Q

Yes, sir.

And this is a final judgment and an independent

action, is it not?
MR. BBSs

1 would call it a final and independent.

It definitely affects the rights of the appellant, whoever
that appellant may foe, or the one petitioner taking the risk.
Q
it?

It’s not part of the criminal prosecution, is

It’s an independent action to
MR. BEE: That’s correct.
Q

independently to test a provision of Florida

law?
MR. BEE;
Q

Yes, Your Honor, it is independent action.

Well, as I say, at least similar to an action

for a declaratory judgment, an injunction, —
MR. BEE:
Q

Yes, sir; that’s correct.

— or for an equivalent in other ways to a

pretrial habeas corpus?
MR, BEE;

It’s another avenue of approach, outside of

the avenue of appeal.
Q

Right.'

MR. BEE;

Q

Do you have declaratory judgment procedure in

Florida?
MR. BBSs
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Could this issue have bean tested there?

MR. BEE:
in the civil field.

I believe not, I believe that would be more
They would not ask for a declaratory

judgment, as such? and I have not heard it ~~ it has not arisen
as such out of our municipal courts, let me put it that way.
Your Honor.
But we do In civil cases.
Q

Mr. Bee, was there a seizure as a result of

the — a seizure of evidence as a result of the arrest in this
case?
MR» EEE:

No, Your Honor, there is no question of

seizure in this case, to my knowledge.
Q

Hell, does that mean, Mr. Bee, that if you lose

up here, all you do is go to the clerk’s boss and get a new
arrest warrant and start this procacution all over again?
MR. BBSs' Would I go get another warrant for him?
Q

If you lose hare, on the ground that this arrest

was invalid, then what do you do with the case?
MR. BEE: Well, Your Honor, 1 would certainly not
prosecute it if 1 lose, or request that it be prosecuted at
this level, it would probably be nolle pressed.

Q

But you could.

The issue is whether you could.

45

Q

Why?

MR. BEE?.
Q

Yes.

MR. BEEs

Whether we could continue prosecution?

Yes, sir.

Why not?

He is always

His case has been — factually, his

case has just bean continued until the disposition of this,
and then a trial date will bo set down.
Q

Wall, is h© on bail or something?

MR. BEE?

is that it?

Yso, sir?, originally he was out on bail,

&3 I understand it.
Q

So the determination ofthis issue

up here

will

have virtually nothing to do with his trial on the merits?
MR. BE2:

Hot on the merits, no, sir.

X can’t see

that — let me say this, the disposition ofthe case here would
have something to do, and that would have to happen after
the determination of what this Court arrives at.
Q

But if Mr. Rezneek should prevail here, and this

Court should simply hold that»?-;/ Ji matter of the Fourth and
fourteenth Amendments, Florida could not constitutionally

confer this power upon a deputy clerk, my brother is correct
in saying that has nothing to do with the merits of his *—
whether or not he committed this offense» nothing to do with
his trial for this offense, and, absent a statute of limitations
or something like that# you would just have him arrested under

All that's in issue before us here is the

validity of Florida's law that confers upon this person the

Yes, sir? that's correct.

And if we hold that Mr. Re2neck is correct, and

that Florida acted unconstitutionally in conferring —
MR. BEE:

He would not be —
this power upon a deputy clerk, it has

nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not the petitioner
committed this offense.

And has nothing whatsoever to do with

his trial, and has nothing whatsoever to do. with whether or
not he cannot, after this Court’s decision, be validly arrested
under a warrant issued by a magistrate? does it? • Unless there
is a statute of limitations problem.
MR, BEE:

It would have nothing to.do with his

trial, no, sir, whatsoever? this is true.

Q

Nor with his guilt, nor with anything —

ME. BEEs
Q

Nor with his guilt or innocence.

— nor with any evidence that might .come into

that trial, or anything else.
MR. BBS: That’s true.
Q

1 agree.

So why wouldn’t your answer to my brothers

White and Rehnquist's questions fee:

Yes, we would go ahead,

presumably, and have this man arrested and — re-arrested if
this arrest was invalid, have him re-arrested and then go to
trial?
Q

If he's still around.

Q

There may be a statute of limitations problem,

but if there isn't, I don’t .see why your answer wouldn’t be
"Yes, of course we would.”
ME. BBS;

Well, yes, of course we would proceed

with the prosecution, but not — if this particular warrant
type of situation is held unconstitutional, then we certainly
wouldn't come back and use the same type of warrant to go out
and arrest him.
Q

No, but you’d go before a judge and get a

warrant.
MR. BBS;

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

That's correct.

The real, what appellee feels is the real jugular
vein of this case is the fact that the appellant, when you take
the Fourth Amendment and you say "no warrant shall issue but

48
upon probable cause, supported by oath and affirmation”, there
axre two things that must happen here.
The appellant is saying he wants to change the test
that cans® out of: Giordenello and Johnson cases, that is a
neutral anti detached magistrate.

Now* when you take the Fourth

Amendment and you Ieoh at it, nothing there says who is it that
shall issue this warrant.
I submit to the Court that the appellant wants to
change this test from, a neutral and detached magistrate to that
of a strictly judicial officer» that is, a judge who
adjudicates.
Now, even so, the.second thing under the Fourth
Amendment, where it says "no warrant shall issue but upon
probable cause supported by oath or affirmation”, nothing is
said of what kind of a function this is.
Now, that, 1 contend, is the jugular vein of this
case is what the function is.
broad spectrum.

And this function is like a

You have over here strictly judicial functions,

in the middle you have the quasi*»judicial functions, and over
■ '

«...the • end aro. the ministerial, which are those involving

clerks.
We are simply saying, by virtue of these statutes,
that the Legislature has delegated to this clerk a quasi**
judicial power.

He has moved him from his normal clerk’s

— he still does the ministerial duties of a clerk» but they

49
have moved him into the middle field where these quasi-judicial
tance, many civil service boards issuing
subpoenas end doing, and giving out quasi-judicial acts*
That is all this statute has done.
Q

Well, could the Legislature do'that with the

prosecuting attorney and all of his deputies?
MR. BEE? No, sir, under -Q

Just saying that:

we know his normal duties ars

to prosecute cases, but we're going to give him this little
sliver of judicial power, and allow him to issue arrest
warrants and oven search warrants.
MR. BEE:
Q

Could it do that?

Ho, sir.

Why not?

MR. BEE:

My answer to that is simply this:

As I

recall the Coolidee case, the test, and the reason why he
cannot, a State’s Attorney or a prosecutor, is because he is
so enveloped with law enforcement, and the test of this of
course is a neutral'.and detached magistrate, must be interposed
between law enforcement and the public.

Yet, if you have a

prosecutor who is there driving his case home, or a State8 s
Attorney, or this type, then 2 would say that he does not
fulfill the neutral and detached magistrate test,
Q

Or a policeman?

MR. BEEs
0

Or a policeman does not,

Well, under your statute, you told me earlier,

so
in the absence of the judge and mayor, or the mayor and clerk,
lets the policeman issue the warrant.
MR. BBSs
Q

Ho, sir, we do not have that system,

The statute says so?

ME. BEE:

Yes, sir, the statute says that, but the

special acts do not, in the City of Tampa.

We do not have

marshals.
What I am saying to the -.Court,. if you're looking at
that issue —
Q

You mean in.Tampa if the mayor and clerk are

absent, then no one can issue it?
MR. BEK:
clerks there.
Q

No. we have many clerks.

There are many

What 1 —
You have many clerks of the court?

MR. BEE: There are many deputy clerks, yes. Your Honos
In other words, it's not the situation of the small town.
The point is, this Court has ruled, in Ocampo, and
has stated specifically that the function of determining
probable cause for an arrest is only quasi-judicial,in the
middle, and not a strictly judicial function or one for a judge
to adjudicate sentence and find innocent'.
Hew, as to the neutral and detached magistrate, the
clerk of that Municipal Court is appointed by the City Clerk,
he is not appointed by & chief of police, ho does not wear a
uniform, he does not have powers of arrest, he is not a sworn

51
police officer# he doesn't wear a uniform# he doesn't carry a
badge# and he doesn't carry a gun.

And he certainly doesn't

prosecute cases.
Ha is assigned to the judicial department of the
City of Tampa. What 7. am saying is# under the broad definition
that X pointed out,in my brief# the magistrate — the clerk
does fit the broad definition of the magistrate that this
Court held in Compton vs.. State of Alabama.

And Florida has

also followed that in Miller vs. McLeod case.
So X submit feo the Court# in conclusion# and pray
the Court to affirm final judgment on appeal of the Supreme
Court of Florida.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you# Mr, Bee.
You've run out of time, Mr. Rssneck, but we'll give
you two minutes or three minutes# if you think you need it.
There may bo soma questions to you also,

MR. REZNECK;

X think that's for the State of Florida

they want to proceed from here.

Q

Well# X know# but so far as -- if you win, what's

52

HR. REZNECKs Well, t think that’s a decision that
they will have to make? but that —
Q

But there is nothing to prevent their making it,

because you win?
MR. REZNECK:

I believe that's correct.

Q

We've got to assume? if it's relevant at all,
u
that they will do so? isn't that true?
MR. REZNECK:

1 don't think we can assume on way or

another.
Q

But they have the power?

MR. REZNECK:

I believe that they do? provided that

they comply with constitutional standards in how they do it.
i would like to spend the brief time that I have on this
question of finality, since it is obviously of some concern
to the Court.
>The test, as was laid down most recently in the
\
'?
Mercantile National ..Bank vs. haxtg&o case, this is at 371 U.S.
555, as 'X understand it is whether the order is a separate and
independent matter anterior to the merits and not enmeshed
in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff's
cause of action.
Q

Was that from the federal courts or the State

courts?
MR. REZNECK:

State.

Here from the Stata court, yes.

S3
And my understanding is that that is the test in this
Court for appellate jurisdiction under 1237(2), and we would
submit that we have met that.
There are some other cases I think I could cite in
that connection.

I believe this Court, in Mills vs. hi abasia,

at 384 U.S. 214, upheld appellate jurisdiction over the denial
of the demurrer by a State Supreme Court, even though the
State Supreme Court had remanded the case for trial.

So that

the separability doctrine has been applied in a number of cases
I believe also in the old Ku Klux Klan case,
State ex rai, Bryant vs, Simmerman, that came to this Court,
1 believe, on habeas corpus in advance of trial and was
decided by this Court in the exercise of its appellate juris<

diction, even though there had been no trial on the merits,
and the case was still awaiting trial in the State court.
I did. also cite the Camara case, which I think is close to
this one.
Q

Of course, in Mills, didn’t the Court say; that

the ruling on the demurrer was, for all practical purposes, a
determination of the litigation, that a remand was just going
to result in a formality —
MR. REZNECK;
raised by the defendant.

Well, there were other issues being
I would suggest that with respect

to this particular issue-that’s before the Court hare, namely,
the constitutionality of the Florida arrest procedure, that

54
there’s nothing further to bo clone, there’s nothing more to be
said on that point, and a further proceeding would not
illuminate that point at all.

And I would think that that would

meet the point that the Court was getting at in Mills.
In other words, there’s nothing further to be raised
on' that particular point.
Q

But in Mills they were talking about the merits,

nothing further could be done on the merits, —
MR. REZNECKs
Q

Yes.

— but here the merits were a criminal

prosecution, not an abstract -MR. REZNECK:

Yes, 1 understand there is that

distinction. But I do think, in terras of the issue, I would •—
0

Mr. Rezneck, suppose in this case when you filed

your action they had gone and gotten a warrant from the chief
judge of the court; would you have been here?
MR. REZNECK:
Q

And have re-arrested him?

Yes, sir.

MR» REZNECK:

I would suppose that we would not —

would not ba here then; that would have mooted the case.

But

they didn't do that.
I just want to make one final point on the State
law.

I think that, contrary to Mr. Bee’s statement that it is

not at all clear that this issue could ba preserved in the
State court at trial, and this common law certiorari pleading

may well have been required as a method of preserving this
point, there is one Florida case that I would like to give
the Court the citation to, because I think it does bear out,
it's a case called Campbell vs. County of Dade, at 113 So<.2d,
708.

Xt*s a District Court of Appeals decision, not a Supreme

Court decision in Florida.
But it does deal with the question of challenging th
validity of an arrest.

At the trial itself, and 1 think that

in view of that decision that appellant here was really quite
justified and perhaps required under Florida law to resort to
this independent proceeding? and it is an independent
proceeding under State law.

And I do think that you have

appellate jurisdiction hers.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Resneck.
Thank you, Mr. Bee.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:58 o'clock, a.m., th® case was
