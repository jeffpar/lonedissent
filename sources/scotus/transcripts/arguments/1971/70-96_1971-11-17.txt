The defendant seasonably objected to that, on the
ground that he had ®r absolute constitutional right to be

That, as far a & the record indicates-,

was his sole basis for objection at- that particular time.
That, motion was; directed to Chiof Justice Tauro of
ili-3 Massachusetts Superior Court, who is presently the Chief
preme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of
M&ssachusefcfcs.
® Chief Justice was asked, under the provisions of
Laws Chapter 277, Ssetion 19, which reads ad follbws.,
to make: fch-y substitution:

HR. IRWIN:

What- he has done in this instance, and

You don't have any ^gaal protection problem.

MR. IRWINs

Well, I would respectfully suggest to ths

Court that traditionally the type of evidence that ic present?.!
to the grand jury is not; a matter for cur inquiry, and I would
cite Costalla vy Tht* United States,

I think the Court is well

aware that the grand jury is able to receive hearsay evidence,
is sbl® to receive virtually any typs of evidenco.

And we do

act leal bahxi'c the sufficiency of ;-c indictment by way of
mining what evidence was necessarily pr seated

agree with you,
MR. IRWIN;

No, 1 do not, Mr., Justice Marshall.

Q

Thank you.

Q

Mr. Irwin, I suppose that the 5 sus Ik whether

this/, particular individual is the one wham the grand jury
intended to indict.

Wouldn’t the grant j try have to ha vs some

kind of evidence that the perpetrator of the murder was a rasa®,
fivs-feefe- covers, fcla.ck^kaired, or eomafching of that effect,
so that you could say, yes, obviously, you didn’t have his name
■■at this if tfov individual who r.\ ,;i fi< •■ that

cripfion?

16
MR. IRWIN:

Yes.

your point is well taken,

Mr. Justice Brennan, I think that
1' think that — obviously it

troubles roe, but it seems that the evidence that has been
presented tc the grand jury is something that we just can’t
necessarily look behind all these times.
X think that the court below put great ©tress on the
fact that had there been a more adequate description of the
defendant# such as you just suggested# that it would have been
easier for the court to find that this was not violative of
the equal protection clause# and that he would — the court
below would not necessarily have had the misgivings that they
did have about this particular ease.
Q

What I had in mind was# hov? could Chief Justice

Tauro conclude that this is the man that the grand jury
intended to indict?

Unless he# at least# had some idea of
;

what the person looked like that the grand jury had in mind,
ilow could h©?
MR. IRWIN: Well# again# and tills is probably not a
vary satisfactory answer# but I would suggest that the record
is bound# with reference to what evidence was before Chief
Justice Tauro# for him to —
Q

What went before the grand jury.

MR. IRWIN:

Yes, it is.

And again# as X suggest#

this, is probably not a very satisfactory answer# but I would
represent that the law ha© bean explicit# that where the grand

jury ©peaks, we assume that: what the grand jury has don© is
sufficient.

We do not look to the sufficiency of it.

And

therefore —
Q

But ©van though w© do» I thought, the issue here

was whether Chief Justice Tauro complied with what you tell us
is the requirement of the Suprema Judicial Court, decisions,
that ha must be satisfied that th© person whose name is new to
be put on th® indictment is th® person whom the grand jury
intended to indict.
MR. IRWIH:
Q

18 that net the law?
Yea ~~ yes, it isr Mr. Justice Brennan*

I den * t see on this record how we can

how wo

can know on® way or the other when he did.
MR. IRWINs Well, this Is again the reaeon why we
suggest that th© exhaustion remedy would have hmn more
appropriate.

It seems to m© that th© vary point that you make

required the court below, on th© comity, th© theory, and on the
exhaustion of remedies doctrine, to remand this case to th®
stata court for the appropriate procedu

determine exactly

what yon said.
It B&mm to me that we have to take the position in
advancing an argument before this Court that the judge, in
making this determination, is in fact an agent of th® grand
jury, and once h© seta down on paper that he is satisfied'that
th© true nam© is that of James J. Connor, the respondent,
we'r© in an analogous situation where we - would b© trying to

18
examine why & grand jury indicted somebody, and it would seem
fee ass that the suggestion that you made points up the argument
that we make in our brief with reference to the exhaustion
situation,

Q

Th© court quoted inconsiderate exhaustion, and

they checked it, didn’t they, on
MR, ZRHZHt
Q

Yes, vary, very summarily in —■

15 v© forgotten on what ground.

MR. ZKHZN:

I think it was a suggestion that the

controlling legal principles were before the* court and therefore
that th© court sua sponte could have raised the federal issue,
and therefor© there is no exhaustion situation before the
court be1ow.
Q

As I read the opinion of the First. Circuit, it

was an attitude that it didn't make any difference what the
proceedings and procedures were in the Massachusetts courts,
it was constitutionally «*MR. 1RVJXN:

Q

— impermissible.

MR. IRWIN:
Q

In fringed.

Exactly.

That’s why, at l®ast X read it, that’s why h®

didn’t send it buck to the

‘Massachusetts State courts to let

them aay what they had done,

KR* IBHINI Exactly.

And, Mr. Chief Justice, I

would suggest to the Court that w* of course do not agree at

19
all with that particular conclusion by that court.
- co: f

As a

i' s inburasting ..o noto it thu decision below

that the court does not in any way discuss the fact that the
court, the Massachusetts trial court stands between the
prosecutor and the accused with reference to making the
substitution.

And I think if the court had recognized that,

it would in fact, recognise -that at least part of its equal
protection objection would be dissipated, and that if there
was a further problem with reference to it, the situation that
Justice Brennan suggests would be appropriate to exhaust the
matter in the State court.
Q

Do you think there might be some due process

problem» if it developed, and -this is a hypothetical, if it
developed, that the judge made this amendment to the indictment
solely because the District Attorney of Massachusetts came in
and said, '’This is our man”?
MR. IRWIN:

Nothing more.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I would suggest

that there could be ® due process problem at that particular
point»
Q

Mr. Irwin, ~-

Q

That petition for certiorari — I mean for

habeas corpus, as I read on page 19; it says that all the
prosecutor said was to give the direct quote,

Is that correct

or not?
MR. IRWIN:

Yes. But that was only when- the

20

respondent and his counsel were present.

This particular matter

was initially heard by the Chief Justice on the motion ex parte.
Q

without the defendant being present?

MR. IRWINs
Q

That'& right.

Then whan the party challenged, with his lawyer,

MR. IRWIN: When he raised his objection on his
arraignment,
Q

So nothing was done except this statement that

"We now know who it is"?
MR. IRWIN;
Q

That’s right.

No problem.

MR. IRWIN; That’s right. And I think it's
significant to point out, though, that there was -- again this
is in connection with our argument that the justice under 27719 serves as an ©gent for the grand jury.

I think it's

significant to point out that there was a prior hearing, even
though it was ex parte —
Q

I have great trouble with this judge being an

agent of the grand jury? I have great problem with that.
MR. IRWIN:
Q

Well, —

In Massachusetts, isn’t it true that the judge

empanels the grand jury?
MR. IRWIN:

He instructs them, he empanels the

grand jury.
Q

So he’s an agent of what he has empaneled?

21
MF, IRWXEs vvell, he is to this? extent, that the
M<s^sachueetts grand jary has. available to it the Justices of
the Superior Court not only .for their advice with reference
t-- the. proceedings they

conducting, but also for their

assistance, for the court*'® assistance in the event that the
grand jury M'eds thorn*

so I would suggest that at least on

that analogy that they are serving in this capacity as an
agent for the grand jury.
Where is there, in the record in this case, that

Q

there was a hearing held, ex parte or other than <ax parte?
MR. IRWIN; The Appendix «shows that there was a
hearing held on August the 9th, 1965, where the prosecutor
presented this motion.

And that apparently —

Well, you said there was a hearing before then,

q

You «aid there was an ex parte hearing before the motion wv-$
made; I thought that’s what you said.
MR. IRWIN: Before the arraignment, Mr. Justice
Marshall.

The arraignment was subject — subsequent to the

time of the substitution of the name.
q

well.. is there, '-anything in the record to show

chat the judge ever heard anything prior to that hearing ex
parte?
MR, IRWINs

No, there is not, because the record is

bound with reference to that.

But the docket, the court

docket indicates that a motion was presented by the prosecutor

22
to the Chief Justice on August fch® 9th.
Q

That’s what * s on page 192

Is that a correct

statement oft page 19 of the petitioner's habeas corpus?

Is

that an accurate statement?
MR. IRWIN:

That's accurate to this extent, that

the arraignment, at the arraignment the defendant, through his
counsel, raised an objection to the substitution of his name.
And at -that particular time the Court made that appropriate
remark.
Q

And that’s all that the prosecutor said?

MR. IRWIN:
Q

That’s ail.

Was that "I find out that John Doe is James J.

Connor"?
MR. IRWIN:
ment.

That's all that was said at the arraign­

And I think the Chief Justice's comment was that this

was not an uncommon procedure.
Q

Mr. Irwin, does — well, has a formal indictment

ever been returned against Mr. Connor?
MR. IRWIN:
Q

No, it has not, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

You don't have this practice in Massachusetts,

that who:.: identity is determined, of perhaps a subsequent
indictment?
MR. IRWIN:

No.

But I wouldn’t want the Court to

conclude from that that that is not feasible or practicable.

X would assume that it can be and has been done in the past.

23
Q

Is there any limitations problem lurking in the

background here?

This is a murder charge# isn't it?

MR. IRWIN:
Q

Do you have a statute of limitations on murder?

MR. IRWIN;
Q

Yes# it is.

No, we do not, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

Do I understand, Mr. Irwin, that your position

is that in any event tills petitioner never submitted this
equal protection claim to any Massachusetts court?
MR. IRWIN: That is exactly correct.
0

And for the first time it was raised in the

federal habeas proceeding?
MR. IRWIN: Exactly.
Q

He raised some federal constitutional ground

but never specifically anything to be called an equal protec­
tion claim?
MR. IRWIN:
Q

Never# Mr. Justice Blackmun.

Mr. Irwin# do you know how many other States

have this procedure?
MR. IRWIN:

If any.
I would assume that there are very few.

I do not knew exactly, Mr. Justice Stewart.

I do know that

a great many States -- on pag® 20 of our brief we make some
reference to it, but I would assume that probably 35 States

information procedure, so I would assume that maybe

«omvv/he;:s between 14 and 15 have a variation of this —■

HR. IRWIN:

Yes.

Do 1 understand yea do .not uae the in.'o.oraticn

procedure in Massechtssetfcs?
MR. IRWIN: We do not, Mr. Justice Blackmua.
Q

I suppose there could be John Dos information,,

couldn’t there?
MR. IRWIN:

Q

I would suggest that there could be, yes.

But you haven’t — you just don't know how many

States have this John Doe
MR. IRWIN:
Q

—-

No, I do not, Mr. Justice Stewart,

Can a man be charged in Massachusetts on &

capital charge, on a murder charge, without a grand jury?
MR, IRWIN:

No, he cannot, Mr. Chief Justice.

Q

All right.

Q

You have indictments generally for all felonies,

don *h you?■
MR. IRWIN:

Yea, we do, Mr. Justice Stewart.

In summary, then, I would just like to conclude by
stating that the Commonwealth, for the reasons that it has
asserted in its brief and in its argument before the Court,
feels that the court below, if it thought that there was
indeed an equal protection problem, should have, under the

comity doctrine and the exhaustion doctrine, referred the case
back to the State court so that the- State court, for the first
lime, would be able to view its statute with reference to

25

it was a valid Stata procedure in light, of the
constitutional claims made under the equal protection clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Thank you vary much, Mr. Chief Justice,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERj Very well, Mr. Irwin.
Mr. Tvohig.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES J. TWOHIG, ESQ.,
OK BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. TWOHIGs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

the Court:
In this case, involving a homicide that occurred in
the early morning hours of May 1st, 1965, the indictment was
handed down by a grand jury that was. in session during the
entire summer of 1965,. and X believe was ©van in session during

May 1965, md throughout August 1965.
On August 4th, a Wednesday X believe, this particular
indictment was handed down, and the indictment, besides naming
a man named Donald Landry, also stated that another man was
involved, John Doe, and that they had no description of this
man, and no other name.
Now, that is the way the indictment read, and I
believe ites stated in full on page.74 of the Appendix.
This information was attested-,
grand jury, and signed by the foreman.
J.&yB

ffsr this?' f3c-‘-o"tXXsd indictment, of John Doe, which is not

26
a fictitious name in my belief under the Massachusetts statute;
in ray belief that statuta is intended to indicate a man who is
known to the police only by a nickname* part of a name* or a
fictitious or assumed name.

Q

But aren’t there a lot of people whs commit

criminal acts* whose identity is not known for quite some time?
MR. TMOKIG:

Not even any name. Your Honor? I will

agree to that. But in those cases the statute provides that
there shall be a practicable description before indictment.
Q

You mean by that © certain height* a certain

color of hair* end so on?
MR. TWOHIGs

Yes.

And in this case* Connor was

five-feet-seven* had black hair* and was of very slight build.
But there was no description of any kind in this indictment.
All ihs grand jury did was to indicate that it did not know
any way of identifying the second man involved in 'the homicide.
Mow* on August 6th* Landry * s wife was moving from her
apartment in Boston and some friends had gone there to help heir.
Connor and his girlfriend were at that apartment.

Connor was

arrested when the police visited the apartment* with another
loan* of about the same description.

This other man had been

in jail on May 1st* so Connor was held.

Boston, and thereafter, on the 9th of August, fch© following

went to Sussex Superior Court for the purpose of representing

that I was in the courtroom.
myself to the court.

But it was called, and I presented

I had supplied the court with a copy of
a

that session that morning.
shortly after the court recognised me, the Assistant
District Attorney in charge of the case, — and Mr. Irwin was
not there* the Attorney General's office has had nothing to
do with this case until it was in the federal courts.

But the

Assistant District Attorney presented a motion for an amendment
to the indictment.
The only information, evidence, or anything of any
kind that the court «aver had was a bald statement by the
prosecutor:

Since the indictment has been returned, we — and

'

i

he did not identify who he meant by "we” — we have ascertained
the name of the defendant.

We did not know it at the time of

the indictmenti
No statement was made as to any other means of
identification.
I objected to this, although I was taken by surprise,
and ' h y accepted tbs allowance of the amendment.

And went

into it in detail, stating that there was no indication that
Connor was the man intended to be indicted by the grand jury,

\

28

or indeed that, they ever intended to indict any specific
person, and that consequently the indictment had no application
to Connor whatsoever.
Q

Mr. Twohig, is there any -** la that a transcript

of that hearing in fell© Appendix?
MR. TWOHIG:

I have supplied one for the Court, Your

Honor.
Q

Is it in the Appendix?

MR. TWOHIG:
Honor.

Xt*s not in the Appendix, no, Your

It is with the voluminous record of the —
Q

In the original record?

MR. TWOHIGi

— pretrial proceedings, and the

evidence in the case.
Q

Thank you.

The amendment was allowed.
not. sanctioned by the Gadsittm case.

How, the amendment was
The procedure in the

Godsiurn case was in accordance with what, the Gedzium case
said the statute intended.

The procedure in the Gedsium case

was that the amendment was not to apply.

There was not to be

any amendment; that the indictment was, in effect, sacred,
and could not he touched.

And this is in accordance with the

doeisv.'on in Commonwealth^ vs. Mahay in Massachusetts, which I
believb h«iS never hmm overruled, and which states that no
amendment' can be made to an indictment in a capital case.
The Gedzium case said that when the true name of

fcfcvi non accused .1«

the indictsaent vncer the name of John Do®

is discovered, it can be entered in the record and thereafter
the defendant will be referred to by that name.

And that8s

what the statute says, which Mr. Irwin has just read.
But that presupposes that John Do® is actually a
fictitious name and that no other practicable description is
necessary, and 1 submit that the statute does not mean that.
But even if it did, it would be unconstitutional, because it
would deprive the defendant not only of equal protection but
also of du© process.
Q

What would you do, Mr. Twohig, about an accused

who is indicted under this statute by the John Doe identifica­
tion and thereafter, when he*s apprehended, he refuses fee* give
any narae, of any kind and they are unable to find his true name?
Can he frustrate the process, or what would be the next step
under this Massachusetts statute?
MR. TWOHIGs

He could be tried under the practicable

description, Your Honor, and the name John Doe.

But there

must bo, under the statute, a practicable description.

He must

have been indicted by seme identification by the grand jury.
Q

By "practicable description" do you mean, again,

E1 approximately five-feat-seven, approximately 140 pounds, and
approximately 40 years of age63, something of that kind?
MR. TWOHIG:

Sf'io»thing of that kind, or by photographs

or by fingerprints, or by sorts* birthmark.

Some description of

30

any kind —
Q

well, at the tin» of the grand jury there may be

no way of getting either a photograph or a fingerprint.
MR. TWOHIG;
Q

I grant that, Your Honor.

That may not be available until

MR. TWOHIG!

And in such a case the culprit would

never b© discovered, I suppose.
Q

No.

But, in this particular, **-

No, I*m assuming, Mr. Twohig, just to get

this illustration, I'm assuming that after the indictment by
this procsss he is apprehended and identified, and the witnesses
who testified before the grand jury identify him as the person
th,r%t they were speaking about to the grand jury, but the name
is hot disclosed, and he refusas, he stands on Fifth Amendment
grounds to refuse to give his name.
MR. TWOHIGs

Now —■

They do not need it.

Witnesses can

go before the grand jury again. Your Honor, and they can
identify the man as the man whom they failed to identify before,,
Q

Well, I've not made myself clear.

In my

hypothetical they have identified him. They said he was fivefoot-seven, approximately 40 years of age, black hair, swarthy
complexion; and that they saw him shoot someone with a pistol,
and run.

And that's all.

He hasn't been apprehended at -the

time they *re before the grand jury.
They describe these events. There is a dead person.
And th© grand jury returns a John Doe indictment.

31
Now, when he is thereafter apprehended, he is
identified in custody by the same witnesses who had testified
to the grand jury, who again say# "This is the man we were
talking about*"

So you have a clear identification of — for

indictment purposes, I suppose you would agree?
MR. TWOHIG?
Q

y©S.

Now’, you say they must go back to the grand jury

again and do what?
MR. TWOHIG:

No, they don’t have to go back this

time, because they had previously identified him by a
practicable description.
Q

How do you go ahead under this statute with the

trial, then?
MR. TWOHIG:

You go ahead with the indictment as it

stands, because it cannot be amended under Massachusetts lav?,
in my opinion*
Q

He is tried as John Doe?

MR* TWOHIGs

John Doe, and the description.

Yes,

Your Honor.
Q

But the statute doesn’t say John Doe and the

description; it says "or" —
MR. TWOHIG:
Q

Or.

— he may bo described by a fictitious name or

by any other practicable description.
MR. TWOHIGs

Yes, Your Honor

That is it.

We're dealing hare with the constitutional

question and not with the statute.
MR, TWOHIG:
Q

Mo.

Mr. Twohig, may I ask:

Did you haw any method

of reviewing the amendment after it was allowed, over your
objection?

Under State law.

MR. TWQHIG:

On many occasion® I've brought up the

question of the 13-legality —~ I claimed it was illegal and
unconstitutional«

of the amendment over your objection without first going t©

Q

Do we have the trial proceedings, are they before

MR. TWQHIG:
Q

The complete record is here,

Well, were there any witnesses who testified,

at the trial who identified Connor as one of the —
MR* TWQHIG:

Y@s, and I'm coming to that.

33

Q

All right.

Q

And when you get to it, would you say, too,

whether any of them said they had also identified him before
the grand jury?
MR. TWOHIG: They said they had not, Your Honor,
Q

Well, the witness Betty Moore, if that was her

name, changed her story.

She told one story first to the grand

jury, and then she changed it.
MR. TWOHIG:

Y@s.

She had testified twice, Your

Honor, -~
Q

Right.

MR. TWOHIG;

before the grand jury.

And it's my

impression that she said — she gave different stories each

time.
Q

Yes.

MR. TWOHIG;

But on no occasion had she identified

Connor, although she had known Connor for several years.
Q

Well, because of the holdup ~~

MR. TWOHIGs
Q

Right.

— at her place of employment —

MR. TWOHIG:

No, before that.

No, not because of

the holdup.
Q

Yes.

MR. TWIHIGs

Connor was not involved in the holdup.

Connor was, I believe, in jail at the time of the holdup, and

34
released tho day of the holdup.
Q

Yes.

MR. TWOKIG: But two days later he became eligible
to be charged in the murder by virtue of being at large.

The

witnesses, the two witnesses did not identify Connor before the
grand jury.

And that was their testimony at. the trial.

And

since one of them admitted at the trial, in order to testify at
tho trial, that she committed perjury on the occasions when
&h© testified before the grand jury, although this grand jury
was the same one, still in session, at the time whan Connor was
brought before the court, it was impractical for the
prosecutor to go back to the grand jury with the same two
identifying witnesses for seme reason, and that is the reason
and it was on that ground that I asked repeatedly for the grand
jury minutes, because if there was any evidence in that
transcript that was favorable to Connor, I felt that 1 was
antitlad to have it, as stated in Brady v. Maryland.
The itientification must have been favorable, to Connor,
if any there were. And X don't believe there was any bwfera
•>

ary.

But there might have been other evidence that

they gave relating to the events of the robbery two days
before the murder, and relating to th® events that night before

fch© murder or the homicide or whatever it was.
There might have been something there which was

35

favorable to Cernor.

I believe that I was entitle# to have that,

and I Wets denied that, of course, repeatedly, right up to the time and
during trial.
The court, then having adopted the amendnant on the 13th,
on the 13th there was another action taken by the court, this time
without any infomati.cn whatsoever.
attention of the Clerk.

It was just brought to the

I suppose the statute had .been read more

carefully in the meantime by 'She prosecutor.

That an entry should

be made in the record in accordance with the statute, to the effect
hat the true name of the man indicted • was Janes J. Conner,

.And,

•in fact, the copy of the amendment which was served upon Connor when
/

he was in jail, after appearing in court en the 13th,

«contained Ms

name.
Now, 'the indictment, of course, handed down by the grand
jury did not contain his name.

That was not the indictment which van

served \g?on him in the jail.
So the, in my view, not only the Constitution of Massachu­
setts and the Constitution of the United States were violated by this
procedure., but the law itself, the statutory law of Massachusetts was
violated, and he was denied due process, on the grounds, I suppose,
stated in G^ daium. that when a miscreant conceals his identity during
commission of a crime, he has no right to complain if he is
arrested on a general warrant.
This is of course contrary to all the previous traditions
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the history, Hie- judicial

36
history that preceded the establishment, of the Caiaorjivraalth.
Q

Of course we're not concerned here with whether or

not the statutory or canmosi law of Massachusetts was violated in this
case, that — it was determined by the Supreme Judicial Court of
Massachusetts that it was not# that this was in crsnformifcy with the
lav; of Massachusetts.

the grand jury minutes were withheld frcra me, at any
rate, although them were, X think; several constitutional grounds
on which I was-entitled to them.

And this policy of secrecy and

the withholding of evidence material to the defense was applied to
the matter of interviewing the trtie identifying witnesses.
I had never even seen the identifying witnesses up to
the time of the trial; esccept on one occasion whan I visited the
oourthousa bade in, I believe., the end of August, 1965, when I

OJ EEHAD? OF THE PETITIONER
MR. IRWINs

Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Courts

By way of rebuttal, I would only reiterate that it's
the Comonwealth's position that the constitutional matter before
•this Court on this hearing is whether or not the respondent, James
J.

Connor, was deprived of any constituticnal guarantees,

specifically the equal protection of the fourteenth Amendment of
the Constitution,
With respect to the argument that ms made by the

ct

'Ce tHXCiV

revhh

cx i

case, that is cited in the

0:x.x:.xx->xJ.xh

' brief, with the dissent, vail indicate that the Massachusetts
Sapr-uc

w>& not presented with the ccnstitaticnal azguraerit,

and that the Justices, in deciding that case, were concerned solely
with determining whether or not Hurtado v. Californici was still
"

strong enough to support the doctrine of Jonas v. Rc&islns in the
Canraonwealth of Massachusetts, and no other issue.
And getting back bo the position that the Ccnroonwealth
taloss in its brief and its argument, X would respectfully suggest
to the Court that this particular vehicle. General Laws Chapter
277, Section 19, is strictly a procedural vehicle by which a
grand jury.-, which has a valid interest in seeing to it that there
are on occasion John Doe indictments returned, had the power to
indict, somebody and then require, later, a substitution cn a shewing
of cause, quote, unquote.
It scans to me that in that situation, that if /the
court wanted to determine whether or not there had been an'equal
protection violation, that the proper thing to do would be to
rema-sd the. case to the State courtf the appropriate State court
for a hearing, consistent with those particular claims.
Thank you, Mr. Grief Justice.
MR, GsISF JUSTICE BIJKSRs
Thank you, Mr. Twchig.

Thank you, Mr, Irwin.
The case is submitted,

(thereupon, at 11*06 sum., the case was submitted..)
